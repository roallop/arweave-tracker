{"id": "XddbzgzijKVjfqbfSV1TU1z2YRhZV6-N-KeWNgyT6vY", "title": "Cash on Cash vs IRR", "body": "The two most used measures of a venture fund’s performance are the “cash on cash” return and the “internal rate of return” (IRR). One measures how much an investor got back divided by how much they put in (cash/cash). The other measures what the effective rate of return is on the investor’s money.\n\nYou might think these measures go hand in hand, but that is not the case.\n\nI was reminded of that last week when I was reviewing USV’s second-quarter reports that we will send to our investors soon. Three of our most mature funds showcase how these numbers can behave differently.\n\nOur 2008 vintage early-stage fund has generated about 5x cash on cash but only generated a 22.5% IRR.\n\nOur first Opportunity Fund, raised two years later in 2010, has generated only 3.9x cash on cash but generated a 58.6% IRR.\n\nAnd our second Opportunity Fund, raised in 2014, has generated 7.3x cash on cash but only 46.7% IRR.\n\nOur Opportunity Funds invest in the later stage rounds of our top-performing portfolio companies plus a few later-stage investments in companies that are new to USV. The average holding period of these investments is materially shorter than our early-stage funds and so they typically produce higher IRRs for a given cash on cash performance. That explains why our 2010 Opportunity Fund has a lower cash on cash return but a much higher IRR than our 2008 early-stage fund.\n\nBut even for the same strategy, you can get materially different numbers. Our 2014 Opportunity Fund has a higher cash on cash return but a lower IRR than our 2010 Opportunity Fund. That is because our 2010 Opportunity Fund had a few very fast material exits and our 2014 Opportunity Fund had a more typical holding period for its material exits.\n\nVenture capital funds do not take down the entire capital commitment upfront. They take it down over time, often over four or five years. And the money comes back over time as well. So the timing of the cash in and cash out has a very big impact on IRR, but zero impact on cash on cash.\n\nSo if these two measures behave differently, what is the more important number? For me, it is cash on cash. I care less about how quickly the money goes in and comes out of a fund and more about the total return of the fund. Our early-stage funds can often take 15-20 years to be fully liquidated but they can also produce much higher total returns.\n\nI have found that patience is often rewarded in early-stage investing. If you want to make 5-10x on your money, you need to be prepared for long holding periods. That reduces the IRR but generates high cash on cash returns.\n", "timestamp": 1627383085, "digest": "lJ_o3svT6GzP8lqRQnOv3gMyu5rlqpZd9sJEGN40wIc", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

This post is a meta-outline of the visual techniques and considerations used to express a number of themes, including: \n\n- juxtaposition of human vs geological / social scales;\n- physical vs digital;\n- the otherworldly nature of this technology;\n- the symbiotic relationship between a community and what it builds, the machine that builds the machine.\n\nEach section below follows this format: **Title** (Page Number).

Here you will find discussion of the graphic elements, as well as points on What It Means.\n\nPlease note that the interpretations here describe possibilities, but are by no means \"official.\" Make your own narratives, your own meanings. Let's begin!\n\n---\n\n### Back and Front Covers\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/60f7317b-2d3c-4dad-bf26-a4c1dbe4fa32.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n*Left: back cover / Right, front cover*\n\n1. A fully suited astronaut stands in almost complete darkness, arm outstretched to their left side. The only illumination comes from three pure white orbs  hovering over the open hand, casting a faint glow onto the arm and torso. Overlaying the orbs are three phrases: \"Beacon Book,\" \"Stateful Works,\" and \"Genesis Edition.\" \n2. This anonymous character simultaneously represents the researchers and implementers, as well as the supporting community that has followed the Beacon Chain since Serenity.\n3. This is a physical book, with a front and back cover. It can be held, paged through and bent. It's a reaction against the almost exclusively digital experience of crypto communities. This is an artifact you can hold in your hands, a material representation of the researchers you follow. It materializes the ephemeral nature of community participation. Your book contains their stories, and your ownership of the book makes you part of the larger story: Ethereum's story.\n\n### Internal Cover (i-ii)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c24b7ff3-869b-429c-aec5-50455038e5ed.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. The first page of content is almost completely white, save for the three circles from the cover reproduced in the same position. However, here they are negatives, punching through the white page to reveal a bright red landscape beneath. The edge of the voids cast a sickle-shaped shadow  onto the landscape below. Sitting on the landscape under the shadow are the same three phrases from the cover.\n2. A dotted black line cuts across the page at the same angle of the shadows, intersecting two smaller white circles. These two circles cast the same shadow as the three voids. Let's call this \"the sundial.\"\n\n### Provenance (1-2)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9623c93b-a2f5-4deb-8552-b90bf3a09b38.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. The majority of this spread is the red landscape: texture and colors emerge. A floating white tablet hovers over it, punched through with a ring, casting shadows. A diagonal line passes over and under the white components, graphic elements which are repeated on subsequent pages.\n2. Relative to the previous spread, the cast shadow shifts, almost imperceptibly. This pattern will be maintained on each successive page throughout the rest of the book. \n3. Some time has passed, and the sundial rotates to match the shift in the cast shadow.\n4. The right page contains space for unique provenance attributes. The upper portion has space to mark the edition, eg. 1/100. The bottom half of the tablet contains a grid for book owners to write a personally meaningful transaction hash to make this copy truly theirs. At the bottom, a set of lines for marking other edition information. \n\n### Introduction (3-4)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ca961ed1-e0f1-4d81-95c3-3d44464811da.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. This is the first spread which contains copy, introducing the participating characters and outlining the vision for the book.\n2. A semicircular void is cut out of the white background, again revealing the tones of the red soil beneath. This repeats in several variations throughout the rest of the book. \n3. On the right page, a new graphic element: a space-suited hand extends into the frame to present a white tablet filled with text.\n4. This is the hand of the astronaut mirroring your own as you hold the book. This is the community, the researchers, the developers, and you as coequal participant. This is human agency shaping immaterial infrastructure. In turn, their book of profiles frames your story. \n\n### \"Continuations\" (7-8)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fab9171b-5e8f-4536-8d8b-3059c779e72f.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> We've always been moving. There is no neat beginning, only a point when we become aware of our place the stories, our story.\n\n*This spread is available to [mint as an NFT](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA) within the Beacon Book text.*\n\n1. This is the first of the NFT series launched with the digital text. We see the same red landscape as in previous spreads. Floating traincars, covered in vents and antennae, loaded with large wooden crates move slowly along the dry, hot landscape. Walking alongside the vehicle is the same character from the cover, plus four more. Their footprints leave a faint imprint in the crunching surface. The figures cast a long, crisp shadow, almost in line with their path of travel, which is incidentally the same angle as the diagonal lines on the previous two spreads.\n3. A white frame sits at on the outer edge of the pages, casting the same angle of shadow as the landscape contained within. The shadow falls on the landscape without differentiation relative to the objects, as if it were the flat surface of a print. Are we witnessing the scene as external observers? Or is this a record of our collective past and future? Historic, cinematic, participatory. \n4. Within the frame are a series of text objects. In the top left, a 0x  hash sequence with 64 characters. This is the 0 slot block root from the start of the Beacon Chain on Dec 5th, 2020. This pattern repeats on each of the subsequent graphic spreads. On the right side is an unidentified alphanumeric string.\n5. The astronauts are us, the researchers, the community: one and the same. Anonymous to the observer, confident in their purpose, comfortable in their unfamiliar environment. Our vantage point shows the small human details of their stride, their posture, their humanity. They are on a journey which has always being ongoing.\n\n### \"Caravans\" (11-12)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0a8e0318-b74b-48cc-8fa0-66cd176108a8.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Resources, effort, coordination, logistics. The material realities to ensure the success of a venture. Careful contingency planning over the years.\n\n*This spread is available to [mint as an NFT](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA) within the Beacon Book text.*\n\n1. The border frame zooms out even further, allowing us to see a broader view of the resources needed to complete the journey. In addition to large and small crates, there are large reels of cable, and frames holding linear tube. Most of the astronauts continue alongside the train on foot, resolutely maintaining their diagonal intent. \n2. The shadow growing from the feet of the characters shortens again as the sun climbs higher in the sky. Is this the same day? Are days hundreds of hours on this planet? Time is a poor yardstick - after all, we are here to see the journey through to the end.\n3. At the top left of the frame, the first slot hash from the Beacon Chain, with its block graffiti in the lower right: \"Mr F was here.\" On the left side is another unidentified string.\n\n### \"Discovery\" (17-18) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/351270ba-5f51-402f-a1db-47b0707e036e.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Found objects. Breakthroughs and productive interference are a happy pair. Planned and unexpected deviations from the spec.\n\n1. Our frame steps back slightly, the characters occupying less of the frame. They have happened upon a previously constructed foundation, crowned with rusted rebar. \n2. The deposit contract has been located. Satisfied with its soundness, it's time to build. \n3. The top right of the frame has the text of the second slot hash, the left another string, the bottom right the grafitti \"BTCS Zug validator.\"\n\n###  Edgington - Beekhuizen (19-20) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e1e05826-b129-45d0-a469-e9fe43ef4691.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. Another recurring graphic element are hands reaching in from out of frame: an echo of the introduction spread. Including the cover, there are seven occurrences of different hands.\n2. At this point, the Sundial is rotated nearly 45° below horizontal, with the shadow angles to match. \n\n### \"Build - Maintain\" (23-24) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f8c26d5f-0bfa-4863-be42-accf5bfbfea9.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> The shape of what we're crafting appears, bit by bit. The continued application of effort yields progress. Vision and belief form narratives.\n\n1. Our vantage point continues its steady progress backwards, encompassing a sprawling construction site. The trains have stopped and are being unloaded, materials staged next to the deposit contract foundation. The community has poured a new concrete base on top, and added the first section of the tower: two Ethereum logos peek out from within the struts. Additional wires are added to stabilize the structure. \n2. The acts of building and maintaining are two sides of the same coin, in a similar relationship as what builders offers to their community.\n3. The top right of the frame has the text of the third Beacon Chain slot hash, and an string of text to the right.\n\n### \"Seen and Seeing\" (29-30) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aae769df-9b10-4577-9fa7-5a2e8cbe94e1.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Anticipation builds, the community gathers to witness transition. Grassroots infrastructure emerges from a fertile soil.\n\n1. Construction continues apace, with 2 more tower sections added and anchored by stay wires. As it nears completion, the participants gather to witness. The trains are emptied of their goods and put to the side - there's not much else to do but wait until the appointed time. Six Ethereum logos occupy the center of the unfinished tower. \n2. The success of the Beacon Chain launch was due in no small part to the grassroots community of passionate validators. This spread is an homage to their observations, reports, bug-fixes, tests and claimed POAPs.\n3. The frame contains a strong to the left, the fourth slot hash, and that slot's graffiti: \"🐠 Welcome to the New Beginning\"\n\n### \"Traditions\" (35-36) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f1a0f7ab-4779-46f8-a016-9fbc81e67acc.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Bated breath, ticking forward into change. There is joy in the shared collective experience of a milestone reached, challenges conquered.\n\n1. Participants and observers have gathered to witness the massive accomplishment of the Beacon finally being operational! After many years of research, scrapped roadmaps, implementations, testing: the first milestone is complete. \n2. Continuing its steady clockwise drift, the shadow seems to pause and resolves into an Ethereum logo.\n3. A regular tradition of the Ethereum community is watch parties for upgrade transitions. The Beacon Chain launch had  the entire community sitting in nervous anticipation, waiting  to step past the threshold of a years-long journey. It was finally here, and worth celebrating.\n4. Validator 18675 missed their appointed slot; as such there is no slot hash. One text string sits on both the left and right.\n\n### \"Onward\" (57-58) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/84962b5b-471d-4953-9733-35d1052c4508.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> We've always been moving. There is no clear end, only the continuous challenge to make our work accessible to those outside our orbit. We're aware of the story, and now we write the next chapter.\n\n1. Our frame of reference takes one final step back to reveal our broadest view of the landscape. To close out the book, we're presented with a fractal loop between society and human agency. Our protagonists pass through the hand of society, beginning to engage. This is the same hand that held the orbs on the cover, and held our stories throughout the book. This is the context we build within and for, the physical places we occupy. \n2. The sun has dropped low into the horizon, beckoning the group forward.\n3. The narrative arc of Progress >> Resolution was resolved within \"Traditions,\" but it's important to remember that we don't build in a vaccum, and the journey is far from over. We still need to pursue The Merge, statelessness, data and execution sharding, VDFs, ZKPs - not to mention making these powerful tools operable for those outside our niche.\n4.  Our final frame has the 6th slot hash from the Beacon Chain, as well as its graffiti: \"poapcRzSC/a0Ns7TJ6jGWhRJGqBMLKEB.\" A final string of letters and numbers sits to on the left of the frame.\n\n---\n\nThank you for reading this graphic explication of the Beacon Book, we hope it was interesting to learn about the graphic themes and narratives expressed throughout.

The community has poured a new concrete base on top, and added the first section of the tower: two Ethereum logos peek out from within the struts. Additional wires are added to stabilize the structure. \n2. The acts of building and maintaining are two sides of the same coin, in a similar relationship as what builders offers to their community.\n3. The top right of the frame has the text of the third Beacon Chain slot hash, and an string of text to the right.\n\n### \"Seen and Seeing\" (29-30) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aae769df-9b10-4577-9fa7-5a2e8cbe94e1.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Anticipation builds, the community gathers to witness transition. Grassroots infrastructure emerges from a fertile soil.\n\n1. Construction continues apace, with 2 more tower sections added and anchored by stay wires. As it nears completion, the participants gather to witness. The trains are emptied of their goods and put to the side - there's not much else to do but wait until the appointed time. Six Ethereum logos occupy the center of the unfinished tower. \n2. The success of the Beacon Chain launch was due in no small part to the grassroots community of passionate validators.

This is the context we build within and for, the physical places we occupy. \n2. The sun has dropped low into the horizon, beckoning the group forward.\n3. The narrative arc of Progress >> Resolution was resolved within \"Traditions,\" but it's important to remember that we don't build in a vaccum, and the journey is far from over. We still need to pursue The Merge, statelessness, data and execution sharding, VDFs, ZKPs - not to mention making these powerful tools operable for those outside our niche.\n4.  Our final frame has the 6th slot hash from the Beacon Chain, as well as its graffiti: \"poapcRzSC/a0Ns7TJ6jGWhRJGqBMLKEB.\" A final string of letters and numbers sits to on the left of the frame.\n\n---\n\nThank you for reading this graphic explication of the Beacon Book, we hope it was interesting to learn about the graphic themes and narratives expressed throughout.

This post is a meta-outline of the visual techniques and considerations used to express a number of themes, including: \n\n- juxtaposition of human vs geological / social scales;\n- physical vs digital;\n- the otherworldly nature of this technology;\n- the symbiotic relationship between a community and what it builds, the machine that builds the machine.\n\nEach section below follows this format: **Title** (Page Number). Commentary is paired with 11 of the 30 spreads from the book. The seven two page spreads were minted as NFTs within the original text, and can be viewed [here](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA). Where applicable, there are short descriptions that were minted as part of the NFT metadata: \n\n> NFT descriptions are in this formatting\n*Primary minting availability is noted in italics.*\n1. Commentary is in numbered point form.\n2. Here you will find discussion of the graphic elements, as well as points on What It Means.\n\nPlease note that the interpretations here describe possibilities, but are by no means \"official.\" Make your own narratives, your own meanings. Let's begin!\n\n---\n\n### Back and Front Covers\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/60f7317b-2d3c-4dad-bf26-a4c1dbe4fa32.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n*Left: back cover / Right, front cover*\n\n1. A fully suited astronaut stands in almost complete darkness, arm outstretched to their left side. The only illumination comes from three pure white orbs  hovering over the open hand, casting a faint glow onto the arm and torso. Overlaying the orbs are three phrases: \"Beacon Book,\" \"Stateful Works,\" and \"Genesis Edition.\" \n2. This anonymous character simultaneously represents the researchers and implementers, as well as the supporting community that has followed the Beacon Chain since Serenity.\n3. This is a physical book, with a front and back cover. It can be held, paged through and bent. It's a reaction against the almost exclusively digital experience of crypto communities. This is an artifact you can hold in your hands, a material representation of the researchers you follow. It materializes the ephemeral nature of community participation. Your book contains their stories, and your ownership of the book makes you part of the larger story: Ethereum's story.\n\n### Internal Cover (i-ii)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c24b7ff3-869b-429c-aec5-50455038e5ed.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. The first page of content is almost completely white, save for the three circles from the cover reproduced in the same position. However, here they are negatives, punching through the white page to reveal a bright red landscape beneath. The edge of the voids cast a sickle-shaped shadow  onto the landscape below. Sitting on the landscape under the shadow are the same three phrases from the cover.\n2. A dotted black line cuts across the page at the same angle of the shadows, intersecting two smaller white circles. These two circles cast the same shadow as the three voids. Let's call this \"the sundial.\"\n\n### Provenance (1-2)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9623c93b-a2f5-4deb-8552-b90bf3a09b38.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. The majority of this spread is the red landscape: texture and colors emerge. A floating white tablet hovers over it, punched through with a ring, casting shadows. A diagonal line passes over and under the white components, graphic elements which are repeated on subsequent pages.\n2. Relative to the previous spread, the cast shadow shifts, almost imperceptibly. This pattern will be maintained on each successive page throughout the rest of the book. \n3. Some time has passed, and the sundial rotates to match the shift in the cast shadow.\n4. The right page contains space for unique provenance attributes. The upper portion has space to mark the edition, eg. 1/100. The bottom half of the tablet contains a grid for book owners to write a personally meaningful transaction hash to make this copy truly theirs. At the bottom, a set of lines for marking other edition information. \n\n### Introduction (3-4)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ca961ed1-e0f1-4d81-95c3-3d44464811da.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. This is the first spread which contains copy, introducing the participating characters and outlining the vision for the book.\n2. A semicircular void is cut out of the white background, again revealing the tones of the red soil beneath. This repeats in several variations throughout the rest of the book. \n3. On the right page, a new graphic element: a space-suited hand extends into the frame to present a white tablet filled with text.\n4. This is the hand of the astronaut mirroring your own as you hold the book. This is the community, the researchers, the developers, and you as coequal participant. This is human agency shaping immaterial infrastructure. In turn, their book of profiles frames your story. \n\n### \"Continuations\" (7-8)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fab9171b-5e8f-4536-8d8b-3059c779e72f.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> We've always been moving. There is no neat beginning, only a point when we become aware of our place the stories, our story.\n\n*This spread is available to [mint as an NFT](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA) within the Beacon Book text.*\n\n1. This is the first of the NFT series launched with the digital text. We see the same red landscape as in previous spreads. Floating traincars, covered in vents and antennae, loaded with large wooden crates move slowly along the dry, hot landscape. Walking alongside the vehicle is the same character from the cover, plus four more. Their footprints leave a faint imprint in the crunching surface. The figures cast a long, crisp shadow, almost in line with their path of travel, which is incidentally the same angle as the diagonal lines on the previous two spreads.\n3. A white frame sits at on the outer edge of the pages, casting the same angle of shadow as the landscape contained within. The shadow falls on the landscape without differentiation relative to the objects, as if it were the flat surface of a print. Are we witnessing the scene as external observers? Or is this a record of our collective past and future? Historic, cinematic, participatory. \n4. Within the frame are a series of text objects. In the top left, a 0x  hash sequence with 64 characters. This is the 0 slot block root from the start of the Beacon Chain on Dec 5th, 2020. This pattern repeats on each of the subsequent graphic spreads. On the right side is an unidentified alphanumeric string.\n5. The astronauts are us, the researchers, the community: one and the same. Anonymous to the observer, confident in their purpose, comfortable in their unfamiliar environment. Our vantage point shows the small human details of their stride, their posture, their humanity. They are on a journey which has always being ongoing.\n\n### \"Caravans\" (11-12)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0a8e0318-b74b-48cc-8fa0-66cd176108a8.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Resources, effort, coordination, logistics. The material realities to ensure the success of a venture. Careful contingency planning over the years.\n\n*This spread is available to [mint as an NFT](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA) within the Beacon Book text.*\n\n1. The border frame zooms out even further, allowing us to see a broader view of the resources needed to complete the journey. In addition to large and small crates, there are large reels of cable, and frames holding linear tube. Most of the astronauts continue alongside the train on foot, resolutely maintaining their diagonal intent. \n2. The shadow growing from the feet of the characters shortens again as the sun climbs higher in the sky. Is this the same day? Are days hundreds of hours on this planet? Time is a poor yardstick - after all, we are here to see the journey through to the end.\n3. At the top left of the frame, the first slot hash from the Beacon Chain, with its block graffiti in the lower right: \"Mr F was here.\" On the left side is another unidentified string.\n\n### \"Discovery\" (17-18) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/351270ba-5f51-402f-a1db-47b0707e036e.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Found objects. Breakthroughs and productive interference are a happy pair. Planned and unexpected deviations from the spec.\n\n1. Our frame steps back slightly, the characters occupying less of the frame. They have happened upon a previously constructed foundation, crowned with rusted rebar. \n2. The deposit contract has been located. Satisfied with its soundness, it's time to build. \n3. The top right of the frame has the text of the second slot hash, the left another string, the bottom right the grafitti \"BTCS Zug validator.\"\n\n###  Edgington - Beekhuizen (19-20) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e1e05826-b129-45d0-a469-e9fe43ef4691.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. Another recurring graphic element are hands reaching in from out of frame: an echo of the introduction spread. Including the cover, there are seven occurrences of different hands.\n2. At this point, the Sundial is rotated nearly 45° below horizontal, with the shadow angles to match. \n\n### \"Build - Maintain\" (23-24) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f8c26d5f-0bfa-4863-be42-accf5bfbfea9.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> The shape of what we're crafting appears, bit by bit. The continued application of effort yields progress. Vision and belief form narratives.\n\n1. Our vantage point continues its steady progress backwards, encompassing a sprawling construction site. The trains have stopped and are being unloaded, materials staged next to the deposit contract foundation. The community has poured a new concrete base on top, and added the first section of the tower: two Ethereum logos peek out from within the struts. Additional wires are added to stabilize the structure. \n2. The acts of building and maintaining are two sides of the same coin, in a similar relationship as what builders offers to their community.\n3. The top right of the frame has the text of the third Beacon Chain slot hash, and an string of text to the right.\n\n### \"Seen and Seeing\" (29-30) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aae769df-9b10-4577-9fa7-5a2e8cbe94e1.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Anticipation builds, the community gathers to witness transition. Grassroots infrastructure emerges from a fertile soil.\n\n1. Construction continues apace, with 2 more tower sections added and anchored by stay wires. As it nears completion, the participants gather to witness. The trains are emptied of their goods and put to the side - there's not much else to do but wait until the appointed time. Six Ethereum logos occupy the center of the unfinished tower. \n2. The success of the Beacon Chain launch was due in no small part to the grassroots community of passionate validators. This spread is an homage to their observations, reports, bug-fixes, tests and claimed POAPs.\n3. The frame contains a strong to the left, the fourth slot hash, and that slot's graffiti: \"🐠 Welcome to the New Beginning\"\n\n### \"Traditions\" (35-36) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f1a0f7ab-4779-46f8-a016-9fbc81e67acc.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Bated breath, ticking forward into change.

If you had a month to work on it surrounded by beautiful nature, creative collaborators, and blazing fast wifi, what could you accomplish?\n\nThe [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) residency is designed to help people answer these questions. **The next cohort will run from August 23rd - September 19th and applications are open now!** \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/047089c0-327c-4a9e-8c83-0945f258c03b.jpeg?height=2000&width=4000)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cf0f590d-65b0-49ba-952d-29ffc773ec10.png?height=878&width=2308)\n\n\n## Submitting a Proposal\n\n**We are accepting proposals from July 27th (now!) until August 2nd (at 11:59 pm PT).**\n\nSubmitting a proposal couldn’t be easier:\n\n1. Write and share a thread on Twitter explaining who you are and what you'd do with a month at the cabins\n2. Tag [@creatorcabins](https://twitter.com/creatorcabins) #Cohort2 in the first tweet\n3. Confirm that you are: vaccinated against COVID-19, able to attend for the entire duration of the cohort, and able to focus full-time on the residency program\n\nWe’ll gather these threads and coordinate a vote among our members to determine the four creators to be selected for the cohort. Voting will open for $CABIN holders from August 3rd - August 6th, at which time the four proposals with the most votes will be selected to participate in the cohort. \n\n\n## What to Include in Your Proposal\n\nUse this as an opportunity to be creative. It would be good to introduce yourself to the community and share some of your past work. We would also love to see some rough, initial thoughts on how you would like to spend the time in Texas. You don’t need to provide a fully fleshed-out plan. Just the kernel of a promising idea that’s been bouncing around your head.\n\nA good proposal will include:\n\n* An introduction to who you are and what you do\n* Some past work samples\n* An idea for how you’d like to spend your time while at the cabins\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ZFleischmann/status/1405588160365596680\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mnirPRJCTS/status/1405620335253278720\n\n\n\n\n## The Cohort\n\nIf your proposal is accepted, you’ll receive a free 1-month stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) in the Hill Country of Texas outside Austin (valued at $2,800). You will have your own private bedroom, bathroom, and workspace in the [Residency Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/cabins), with access to a communal workspace, living room, dining room, and kitchen. The cabins also have a fire pit, floating pool, and 28 acres to roam around on.\n\nA Camp Counselor will be there to coordinate the logistics of your stay, including getting to the cabins from the airport, group outings, and grocery runs.\n\n**Most importantly, you’ll have one month of uninterrupted time to bring a project into the world.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/422c55ba-cf7e-4f48-a33f-f20f3aa011e5.jpg?height=2400&width=3600)\n\n## FAQs\n\n### What is Creator Cabins?\n\n[Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) is an online and IRL community committed to helping independent online creators. We operate a residency program run by a [DAO (decentralized autonomous organization)](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw).\n\nThe DAO brought together people from across the internet to fund [12 month-long residencies for creators](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ). We have an active [token-gated discord community](https://discord.gg/N6hVmFygjR) and bring people together IRL at the Creator Cabins location in the Texas Hill Country outside of Austin, TX:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710) \n\n\n\n### What are the requirements to apply?\n\nWe ask that all residents be:\n\n1. Vaccinated against COVID-19\n2. Able to attend for the entire duration of the cohort\n3. Able to focus full-time on the residency program\n\nBeyond that, the program is open to anyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders. \n\nIf you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n\n### What skills are we looking for?\n\nCreativity, collaboration, dedication, and diversity. We love the idea of bringing people from wildly different backgrounds together and seeing what happens. What will the conversation be like around the firepit? How will people end up collaborating and supporting each other?\n\n\n### How do I know I should apply?\n\nThe little voice inside of you telling you your idea is great and you can do it. Believe that voice. Channel it into a Twitter thread for a chance to spend a month working on that project you’ve been itching to build.\n\n\n### What’s included?\n\nThe residency program includes the following:\n* A free, 1-month stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) (valued at $2,800) with your own private bedroom, bathroom, and workspace\n* A 0.25 ETH stipend for food and other essentials\n* Access to a Camp Counselor to coordinate logistics of your trip\n* One month of uninterrupted time to create with a community of collaborators to support you\n* Your own $CABIN tokens and membership in the CabinDAO community\n\n\n### Can I work on other work (e.g. remote work) while I’m there?\n\nThe goal of this residency program is to unlock the time and space to work on projects you wouldn’t otherwise be able to focus on. We want to support people who will be spending most of their time focused on these projects. While we understand that people may have other commitments, if you aren’t able to dedicate a month to independent creative work, this program is probably not the right fit.

We operate a residency program run by a [DAO (decentralized autonomous organization)](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw).\n\nThe DAO brought together people from across the internet to fund [12 month-long residencies for creators](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ). We have an active [token-gated discord community](https://discord.gg/N6hVmFygjR) and bring people together IRL at the Creator Cabins location in the Texas Hill Country outside of Austin, TX:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710) \n\n\n\n### What are the requirements to apply?\n\nWe ask that all residents be:\n\n1. Vaccinated against COVID-19\n2. Able to attend for the entire duration of the cohort\n3. Able to focus full-time on the residency program\n\nBeyond that, the program is open to anyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders. \n\nIf you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n\n### What skills are we looking for?\n\nCreativity, collaboration, dedication, and diversity. We love the idea of bringing people from wildly different backgrounds together and seeing what happens. What will the conversation be like around the firepit? How will people end up collaborating and supporting each other?\n\n\n### How do I know I should apply?\n\nThe little voice inside of you telling you your idea is great and you can do it. Believe that voice. Channel it into a Twitter thread for a chance to spend a month working on that project you’ve been itching to build.\n\n\n### What’s included?\n\nThe residency program includes the following:\n* A free, 1-month stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) (valued at $2,800) with your own private bedroom, bathroom, and workspace\n* A 0.25 ETH stipend for food and other essentials\n* Access to a Camp Counselor to coordinate logistics of your trip\n* One month of uninterrupted time to create with a community of collaborators to support you\n* Your own $CABIN tokens and membership in the CabinDAO community\n\n\n### Can I work on other work (e.g. remote work) while I’m there?\n\nThe goal of this residency program is to unlock the time and space to work on projects you wouldn’t otherwise be able to focus on. We want to support people who will be spending most of their time focused on these projects.

We operate a residency program run by a [DAO (decentralized autonomous organization)](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw).\n\nThe DAO brought together people from across the internet to fund [12 month-long residencies for creators](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ). We have an active [token-gated discord community](https://discord.gg/N6hVmFygjR) and bring people together IRL at the Creator Cabins location in the Texas Hill Country outside of Austin, TX:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710) \n\n\n\n### What are the requirements to apply?\n\nWe ask that all residents be:\n\n1. Vaccinated against COVID-19\n2. Able to attend for the entire duration of the cohort\n3. Able to focus full-time on the residency program\n\nBeyond that, the program is open to anyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders. \n\nIf you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n\n### What skills are we looking for?\n\nCreativity, collaboration, dedication, and diversity. We love the idea of bringing people from wildly different backgrounds together and seeing what happens. What will the conversation be like around the firepit? How will people end up collaborating and supporting each other?\n\n\n### How do I know I should apply?\n\nThe little voice inside of you telling you your idea is great and you can do it. Believe that voice. Channel it into a Twitter thread for a chance to spend a month working on that project you’ve been itching to build.\n\n\n### What’s included?\n\nThe residency program includes the following:\n* A free, 1-month stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) (valued at $2,800) with your own private bedroom, bathroom, and workspace\n* A 0.25 ETH stipend for food and other essentials\n* Access to a Camp Counselor to coordinate logistics of your trip\n* One month of uninterrupted time to create with a community of collaborators to support you\n* Your own $CABIN tokens and membership in the CabinDAO community\n\n\n### Can I work on other work (e.g. remote work) while I’m there?\n\nThe goal of this residency program is to unlock the time and space to work on projects you wouldn’t otherwise be able to focus on. We want to support people who will be spending most of their time focused on these projects. While we understand that people may have other commitments, if you aren’t able to dedicate a month to independent creative work, this program is probably not the right fit. We trust the members of this community to use their best judgment based on the goal of this program.\n\n\n### When will I know if I was selected?\n\nVoting will close on August 6th, at which point we will reach out on Twitter and/or via email to make sure you meet the requirements and can accept the residency.\n\n\n### Is this just for US citizens?\n\nNo, this is open to anyone who can travel to the US and will be vaccinated at the start of the program.\n\n\n### Do I have to submit on Twitter?\n\nWe would prefer applications to be submitted through Twitter so that the broader community can provide feedback. If you don't have Twitter or are not able to submit your proposal there, [you may send the DAO your proposal via this form](https://forms.gle/d53Uba5kvjtcUWGn8).", "timestamp": 1627404354, "digest": "sO5Z4YfAY3zRNsGdKUINrcRYbzLIcKFOjlN0gC2ZsFU", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

It would be good to introduce yourself to the community and share some of your past work. We would also love to see some rough, initial thoughts on how you would like to spend the time in Texas. You don’t need to provide a fully fleshed-out plan. Just the kernel of a promising idea that’s been bouncing around your head.\n\nA good proposal will include:\n\n* An introduction to who you are and what you do\n* Some past work samples\n* An idea for how you’d like to spend your time while at the cabins\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ZFleischmann/status/1405588160365596680\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mnirPRJCTS/status/1405620335253278720\n\n\n\n\n## The Cohort\n\nIf your proposal is accepted, you’ll receive a free 1-month stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) in the Hill Country of Texas outside Austin (valued at $2,800).

{"id": "BNuEIdllmMjin5mtpNXbTnm5je5daK680Hcb0b9kgpw", "title": "Beacon Book: Graphics & Narratives ", "body": "**This post is an exploration of the graphics and narratives used throughout the Beacon Book,a collection of perspectives from 46 researchers and implementers that worked on the Ethereum Beacon Chain.**\n\n*The full text of the Beacon Book went live on Tuesday, July 6th, alongside a series of 7 NFTs taken directly from the book. We're opening the auction for the 100 physical Genesis Editions soon. Sign up below to be notified when the auction begins and is close to ending.*\n\n*→ [Read and Mint here](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA)*\n\n*→ [Sign up to be notified](https://forms.gle/TsGyb5gUpXwN9FEt8)*\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nAt its core, the Beacon Book is a dual tribute to both the Beacon Chain builders and the Ethereum community. This post is a meta-outline of the visual techniques and considerations used to express a number of themes, including: \n\n- juxtaposition of human vs geological / social scales;\n- physical vs digital;\n- the otherworldly nature of this technology;\n- the symbiotic relationship between a community and what it builds, the machine that builds the machine.\n\nEach section below follows this format: **Title** (Page Number). Commentary is paired with 11 of the 30 spreads from the book. The seven two page spreads were minted as NFTs within the original text, and can be viewed [here](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA). Where applicable, there are short descriptions that were minted as part of the NFT metadata: \n\n> NFT descriptions are in this formatting\n*Primary minting availability is noted in italics.*\n1. Commentary is in numbered point form.\n2. Here you will find discussion of the graphic elements, as well as points on What It Means.\n\nPlease note that the interpretations here describe possibilities, but are by no means \"official.\" Make your own narratives, your own meanings. Let's begin!\n\n---\n\n### Back and Front Covers\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/60f7317b-2d3c-4dad-bf26-a4c1dbe4fa32.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n*Left: back cover / Right, front cover*\n\n1. A fully suited astronaut stands in almost complete darkness, arm outstretched to their left side. The only illumination comes from three pure white orbs  hovering over the open hand, casting a faint glow onto the arm and torso. Overlaying the orbs are three phrases: \"Beacon Book,\" \"Stateful Works,\" and \"Genesis Edition.\" \n2. This anonymous character simultaneously represents the researchers and implementers, as well as the supporting community that has followed the Beacon Chain since Serenity.\n3. This is a physical book, with a front and back cover. It can be held, paged through and bent. It's a reaction against the almost exclusively digital experience of crypto communities. This is an artifact you can hold in your hands, a material representation of the researchers you follow. It materializes the ephemeral nature of community participation. Your book contains their stories, and your ownership of the book makes you part of the larger story: Ethereum's story.\n\n### Internal Cover (i-ii)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c24b7ff3-869b-429c-aec5-50455038e5ed.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. The first page of content is almost completely white, save for the three circles from the cover reproduced in the same position. However, here they are negatives, punching through the white page to reveal a bright red landscape beneath. The edge of the voids cast a sickle-shaped shadow  onto the landscape below. Sitting on the landscape under the shadow are the same three phrases from the cover.\n2. A dotted black line cuts across the page at the same angle of the shadows, intersecting two smaller white circles. These two circles cast the same shadow as the three voids. Let's call this \"the sundial.\"\n\n### Provenance (1-2)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9623c93b-a2f5-4deb-8552-b90bf3a09b38.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. The majority of this spread is the red landscape: texture and colors emerge. A floating white tablet hovers over it, punched through with a ring, casting shadows. A diagonal line passes over and under the white components, graphic elements which are repeated on subsequent pages.\n2. Relative to the previous spread, the cast shadow shifts, almost imperceptibly. This pattern will be maintained on each successive page throughout the rest of the book. \n3. Some time has passed, and the sundial rotates to match the shift in the cast shadow.\n4. The right page contains space for unique provenance attributes. The upper portion has space to mark the edition, eg. 1/100. The bottom half of the tablet contains a grid for book owners to write a personally meaningful transaction hash to make this copy truly theirs. At the bottom, a set of lines for marking other edition information. \n\n### Introduction (3-4)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ca961ed1-e0f1-4d81-95c3-3d44464811da.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. This is the first spread which contains copy, introducing the participating characters and outlining the vision for the book.\n2. A semicircular void is cut out of the white background, again revealing the tones of the red soil beneath. This repeats in several variations throughout the rest of the book. \n3. On the right page, a new graphic element: a space-suited hand extends into the frame to present a white tablet filled with text.\n4. This is the hand of the astronaut mirroring your own as you hold the book. This is the community, the researchers, the developers, and you as coequal participant. This is human agency shaping immaterial infrastructure. In turn, their book of profiles frames your story. \n\n### \"Continuations\" (7-8)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fab9171b-5e8f-4536-8d8b-3059c779e72f.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> We've always been moving. There is no neat beginning, only a point when we become aware of our place the stories, our story.\n\n*This spread is available to [mint as an NFT](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA) within the Beacon Book text.*\n\n1. This is the first of the NFT series launched with the digital text. We see the same red landscape as in previous spreads. Floating traincars, covered in vents and antennae, loaded with large wooden crates move slowly along the dry, hot landscape. Walking alongside the vehicle is the same character from the cover, plus four more. Their footprints leave a faint imprint in the crunching surface. The figures cast a long, crisp shadow, almost in line with their path of travel, which is incidentally the same angle as the diagonal lines on the previous two spreads.\n3. A white frame sits at on the outer edge of the pages, casting the same angle of shadow as the landscape contained within. The shadow falls on the landscape without differentiation relative to the objects, as if it were the flat surface of a print. Are we witnessing the scene as external observers? Or is this a record of our collective past and future? Historic, cinematic, participatory. \n4. Within the frame are a series of text objects. In the top left, a 0x  hash sequence with 64 characters. This is the 0 slot block root from the start of the Beacon Chain on Dec 5th, 2020. This pattern repeats on each of the subsequent graphic spreads. On the right side is an unidentified alphanumeric string.\n5. The astronauts are us, the researchers, the community: one and the same. Anonymous to the observer, confident in their purpose, comfortable in their unfamiliar environment. Our vantage point shows the small human details of their stride, their posture, their humanity. They are on a journey which has always being ongoing.\n\n### \"Caravans\" (11-12)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0a8e0318-b74b-48cc-8fa0-66cd176108a8.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Resources, effort, coordination, logistics. The material realities to ensure the success of a venture. Careful contingency planning over the years.\n\n*This spread is available to [mint as an NFT](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA) within the Beacon Book text.*\n\n1. The border frame zooms out even further, allowing us to see a broader view of the resources needed to complete the journey. In addition to large and small crates, there are large reels of cable, and frames holding linear tube. Most of the astronauts continue alongside the train on foot, resolutely maintaining their diagonal intent. \n2. The shadow growing from the feet of the characters shortens again as the sun climbs higher in the sky. Is this the same day? Are days hundreds of hours on this planet? Time is a poor yardstick - after all, we are here to see the journey through to the end.\n3. At the top left of the frame, the first slot hash from the Beacon Chain, with its block graffiti in the lower right: \"Mr F was here.\" On the left side is another unidentified string.\n\n### \"Discovery\" (17-18) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/351270ba-5f51-402f-a1db-47b0707e036e.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Found objects. Breakthroughs and productive interference are a happy pair. Planned and unexpected deviations from the spec.\n\n1. Our frame steps back slightly, the characters occupying less of the frame. They have happened upon a previously constructed foundation, crowned with rusted rebar. \n2. The deposit contract has been located. Satisfied with its soundness, it's time to build. \n3. The top right of the frame has the text of the second slot hash, the left another string, the bottom right the grafitti \"BTCS Zug validator.\"\n\n###  Edgington - Beekhuizen (19-20) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e1e05826-b129-45d0-a469-e9fe43ef4691.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. Another recurring graphic element are hands reaching in from out of frame: an echo of the introduction spread. Including the cover, there are seven occurrences of different hands.\n2. At this point, the Sundial is rotated nearly 45° below horizontal, with the shadow angles to match. \n\n### \"Build - Maintain\" (23-24) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f8c26d5f-0bfa-4863-be42-accf5bfbfea9.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> The shape of what we're crafting appears, bit by bit. The continued application of effort yields progress. Vision and belief form narratives.\n\n1. Our vantage point continues its steady progress backwards, encompassing a sprawling construction site. The trains have stopped and are being unloaded, materials staged next to the deposit contract foundation. The community has poured a new concrete base on top, and added the first section of the tower: two Ethereum logos peek out from within the struts. Additional wires are added to stabilize the structure. \n2. The acts of building and maintaining are two sides of the same coin, in a similar relationship as what builders offers to their community.\n3. The top right of the frame has the text of the third Beacon Chain slot hash, and an string of text to the right.\n\n### \"Seen and Seeing\" (29-30) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aae769df-9b10-4577-9fa7-5a2e8cbe94e1.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Anticipation builds, the community gathers to witness transition. Grassroots infrastructure emerges from a fertile soil.\n\n1. Construction continues apace, with 2 more tower sections added and anchored by stay wires. As it nears completion, the participants gather to witness. The trains are emptied of their goods and put to the side - there's not much else to do but wait until the appointed time. Six Ethereum logos occupy the center of the unfinished tower. \n2. The success of the Beacon Chain launch was due in no small part to the grassroots community of passionate validators. This spread is an homage to their observations, reports, bug-fixes, tests and claimed POAPs.\n3. The frame contains a strong to the left, the fourth slot hash, and that slot's graffiti: \"🐠 Welcome to the New Beginning\"\n\n### \"Traditions\" (35-36) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f1a0f7ab-4779-46f8-a016-9fbc81e67acc.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Bated breath, ticking forward into change. There is joy in the shared collective experience of a milestone reached, challenges conquered.\n\n1. Participants and observers have gathered to witness the massive accomplishment of the Beacon finally being operational! After many years of research, scrapped roadmaps, implementations, testing: the first milestone is complete. \n2. Continuing its steady clockwise drift, the shadow seems to pause and resolves into an Ethereum logo.\n3. A regular tradition of the Ethereum community is watch parties for upgrade transitions. The Beacon Chain launch had  the entire community sitting in nervous anticipation, waiting  to step past the threshold of a years-long journey. It was finally here, and worth celebrating.\n4. Validator 18675 missed their appointed slot; as such there is no slot hash. One text string sits on both the left and right.\n\n### \"Onward\" (57-58) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/84962b5b-471d-4953-9733-35d1052c4508.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> We've always been moving. There is no clear end, only the continuous challenge to make our work accessible to those outside our orbit. We're aware of the story, and now we write the next chapter.\n\n1. Our frame of reference takes one final step back to reveal our broadest view of the landscape. To close out the book, we're presented with a fractal loop between society and human agency. Our protagonists pass through the hand of society, beginning to engage. This is the same hand that held the orbs on the cover, and held our stories throughout the book. This is the context we build within and for, the physical places we occupy. \n2. The sun has dropped low into the horizon, beckoning the group forward.\n3. The narrative arc of Progress >> Resolution was resolved within \"Traditions,\" but it's important to remember that we don't build in a vaccum, and the journey is far from over. We still need to pursue The Merge, statelessness, data and execution sharding, VDFs, ZKPs - not to mention making these powerful tools operable for those outside our niche.\n4.  Our final frame has the 6th slot hash from the Beacon Chain, as well as its graffiti: \"poapcRzSC/a0Ns7TJ6jGWhRJGqBMLKEB.\" A final string of letters and numbers sits to on the left of the frame.\n\n---\n\nThank you for reading this graphic explication of the Beacon Book, we hope it was interesting to learn about the graphic themes and narratives expressed throughout.

B@C currently consists of 32 officers and 5 board members with over 200 community participants across New York City.\n\nHere are some activities, responsibilities, and roles that B@C has facilitated:\n\n1. Fostering education and discussion of decentralized organizations and digital assets. This is done by teaching [free courses](https://github.com/BlockchainAtColumbia/BlockchainsAndCryptocurrencies) on campus and hosting regular events of various sizes on Columbia University’s campus for NYC students (weekly discussions, speaker events, and larger conferences such as our annual [Ledger Fest](https://ledgerfest.info/) conference). B@C members have also been involved in setting the curriculum for new blockchain-related courses on campus.\n2. Facilitating technical blockchain R&D internally and rewarding grants to NYC students doing so. This includes academic papers and open source development/contributions.\n3. Voting on proposals as a delegate to DAOs, such as Uniswap and Compound.\n4. Producing educational content and thought leadership on various web3 related concepts and technologies.\n5. Providing a space for students to communicate and build relationships with others interested in distributed ledger technology.\n\n## Launch Purpose\n\nAs a student organization in a school that isn’t prioritizing blockchain tech, we currently get a maximum budget of $600 a semester from the university itself. We are setting up a DAO to leapfrog the tedious and constraining process of incorporating.\n\n**Goals and Responsibilities:**\n\n1. Rewarding R&D grants to NYC students focused on distributed ledger technology (blockchains, cryptocurrencies, DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, etc.).\n2. Spending treasury funds to host speakers and plan larger events and conferences as well as sponsor new courses and educational content.\n3. Voting on changes/improvements to the B@C constitution and managing yearly board elections.\n4. Voting on proposals raised by larger DAOs of which B@C is a delegate. Our current voting history can be seen [here](https://www.withtally.com/voter/0xdc1f98682f4f8a5c6d54f345f448437b83f5e432/governance/uniswap).\n\n## LION Token\n\nAnyone in the community interested in supporting Blockchain@Columbia/Lion DAO is welcome to participate in our LION token launch. Only whitelisted current members and alumni will be able to vote in our [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/blockchaincolumbia.eth/settings) proposals. Current Members will be able to vote in day-to-day matters, such as events, treasury expenditure, grant applications, executive board elections etc. as well as more general matters like our participation in governance and changes to our constitution. While alumni will be able to vote in more general matters like our participation in governance and changes to our constitution. The B@C board will be responsible for whitelisting voter addresses. Non-members or alumni will be included as supporters (with permission) on our website, at conferences, and be given free admission to any conferences/events we have.  \n\nB@C will take 30% of the LION tokens from the sale, allocating these tokens to new members of the organization each semester. This will be custodied by the B@C board.\n\nAssets in the Lion DAO treasury and delegated voting rights for various protocols will be held by [Gnosis Safe multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xdD24e3EBbB0c326D95c8e4Af31Df3cB9022537e5/balances) (0xdD24e3EBbB0c326D95c8e4Af31Df3cB9022537e5) with the current president [Alex Toberoff](https://twitter.com/Alextoberoff), vice president [Adrian Zembsch](https://twitter.com/AZembsch), and advisor [Nir Kabessa](https://twitter.com/nir_III) as the signatories, subject to expansion.

I'm a 22-year-old graphic designer and creative entrepreneur from the Philippines. That's in South East Asia, like Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia.\nHere's what I've been up to with my life.\n\n---\n\n### School\n\nI took up Organizational Communication in college, which is like a mix of public relations, branding, and knowing how organizations work. I don't even know if I'm giving justice to my course with this definition, LMAO. IT'S BEEN A WHILE.\n\nI stopped a year before I was supposed to do my thesis. I thought that a diploma wasn't worth it anymore, and am still questioning the value of a diploma. What does it mean that a person has a diploma, even from one of the Top 4 universities in the country, especially for a creative? I care more about branding and visual identities (we're talking beyond logos), and for those disciplines, the only way I was going to be good at it is through practice. Don't get me wrong, I value education and loved my major subjects. I found them super interesting even though they were hard. But I don't understand why the educational system is what it is. (add more on that or delete)\n\nI have been on a Leave of Absence since mid-2019, and have no intention of returning, even though I have earned enough money to sustain myself AND pay for my education.\n\nUnofficial College Dropout. Do I aspire to be the next Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates? Fuck no! I'll be the only Gian Ferrer!\n\n### Creative Businesses\n\nWhile in college (I was 19 this time), I made my first brand called estitiks, which makes fun of what's *#aesthetic*. I usually sell stickers, taking note of graphic design trends like gradients and duotones and mixing them up with crass or witty statements. It's me thinking \"Will people buy this even if the statement is so stupid or mean, because it's pretty?\"\n\nBefore the pandemic, I joined over 40 events (everything from small indie gigs, art conventions, to music festivals), about 10 stores (some even inside malls), and a handful of pop-ups, selling my stuff.\n\n![My small area in a pop-up store inside a known mall. I have my stickers and my \"baket\" Hat (\"Bakit\" is \"Why\" in Filipino). Made 5-figures in sales because it was the holiday season.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/02ff9198-a216-4f87-8237-554cb534c544.jpeg?height=731&width=1440)\n\nThese days I spend a lot of time asking myself whether I've outgrown this type of branding and whether I should move on. It's been a few years since I started doing this, and I feel like I've matured... at least a little. IDK...\n\nDuring my time building estitiks, I also organized a few events, usually small gatherings for creatives. This led to me making another brand, HOHOL Events.\n\n![The crowd during my first big event, \"Powerpoint Party\". Imagine if you went to a TEDx Talk where the speaker must take shots or chug a bottle of beer BEFORE giving their talk on some insanely random topic.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b1937cd2-db5c-4266-a5c5-19b0de6a601c.jpg?height=812&width=1600)\n\nWe launched in late 2019, so we haven’t been able to do a lot of stuff yet. But during our short run we had over 200 attendees at our three events.\n\n### Freelancing\n\nDuring my last months in school, I started freelancing! This is while I had the sticker business as well. My first freelance gig was in publishing, where I created the featured images for the magazine’s blog posts and other social media content. At the same company, I did the layout for two magazines that were distributed to about 10,000 people at two of their events. I left after 6 months to work at a boutique integrated marketing agency where I wrote social media posts for a small fast food chain. During this time, I was still working on the sticker business, AND ALSO running my small event organizing group. I left the agency in December 2019.\n\nThinking about it now, I feel like I prefer being my own boss AND client, rather than being a part of a bureaucratic or hierarchical organization.\n\nThe first few months of 2020, I thought that I deserved a break from continuously going to school, then work, while making two small businesses. That break went too long because of the pandemic. But maybe I needed it. I got back to work last October 2020 and have been working for multinational advertising agencies since.\n\n### The Road Less Traveled\n\nA recurring theme in my life is that I choose the road less traveled. From unofficially dropping out of school — giving me less of a chance of getting a high-paying job locally —, building my own brands from scratch instead of being a part of one, to even getting myself into this wild world of Web3 / Crypto where outsiders just talk shit and not even try to understand it by getting their feet wet.\n\nIt's always been a lonely road, even if I meet partners or new friends that are there to support me. I just feel like nobody understands me fully, being an LGBT+ graphic designer from the Philippines, who's just trying to sustain myself, create stuff, and help others along the way. Writing this paragraph just made me realize that there's more to me, even though I don't feel it (yet?) Maybe I'm asking too much from people. IDK.\n\n![I saw this GIF and got me a little bit emotional because this is a great visual of what I feel. Anyway, stream \"Dark\" on Netflix. That show is g o o d  s h i t .](https://media1.tenor.com/images/1b398a6be179c96c990564e8e260413c/tenor.gif?height=800&width=1580)\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have various friend groups that I all love, but I feel like I haven't found my tribe yet. Will I find them in the world of Web3? I don't know. But anyways...\n\nHello, people of Web3! I'm Gian, and it's nice to meet you!\n\n---\n\n*If you like what you just read, feel free to collect this post as an NFT!

She is not what she once was. She is in ruins. Destroyed and empty. Barren. \n\nOnce thriving, the world of Elektra cultivated its energy through sound — through the creative energy of music. The trees and winds and oceans depended on it.\n\nBut changes came. Ugly ones. Visions of profit and efficiency, of toiling the land for selfish ideals. Excavating everything possible. And the world that once was fell into darkness. The music leaked out of this world. And was no longer replenished by the artists who lived here. They were put to work for profit. \n\nThen came the *Great Night* — as the energy of music leaked out of the world, so too did its greenery and sun. The planet became covered in a sand-like wind, a bleak flattened land of ruins and ash. \n\n**We have arrived here in a moment of absolute urgency. There is little time left to save this planet from extinction.** \n\nIf you own a Portal Ticket and $ELEKTRA tokens, [join in now](https://elektra.camp/#/).\n\n**For those who have already started Level 2 on the Elektra Discord, [be sure to get your vote in](https://snapshot.org/#/elektradao.eth/proposal/QmTYymfZNn2o5JqsBPmzsq38ZjmvKydoFSFXG1uibAHarx) on where we should go next by Thursday July 29 at 6pm ET.** \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/58333e77-cf9c-4559-8c76-e7c28c118b28.png?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n## The Future Is Upon Us\n\n**We are in the very early days of a creative revolution.** \n\nTechnology moves art forward. The advent of photography moved painters away from portraits and into impressionist work. Recording technologies moved musicians into novel domains of performance, giving rise to entirely new genres of music. \n\nToday we are seeing technologies reshape creativity from every angle. The ability to create art digitally — be it visual or sonic — is becoming easier and less expensive by the day. A technology like TikTok is giving rise to new forms of creation, [giving remixing a whole new meaning](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/seA6j67Jc0mm8vqGe1zTuXC7O0h95XlmazSQXDlrd24). We are also just beginning to glimpse the universe of creativity that will pour out of virtual and augmented reality.\n\nAll of this fittingly coincides with the proliferation of technologies that we have packaged into the term *Web 3.0*. \n\nThe Web 3 tech stack is still in its infancy. But it is pointing to a world where we can create complex systems of coordination, attribution, monetization and ownership — while abstracting a lot of that complexity away from the end user. \n\nThis means that in time — and through a lot of experimentation and iteration — we will become a whole lot better at working with each other on highly complex and creative work. \n\nIn short, **we will get very good at building worlds together.** \n\nhttps://twitter.com/js_horne/status/1418809259442286595\n\n*Songcamp Elektra* is an early experiment to this end. Together, we are building *Elektra* — an interactive world with music at its core. Through audiovisual artwork and songs, we are telling the story of a world called *Elektra*, which depends on music for its survival. \n\n### The Elektra DAO Experiment\n\nThrough the use of NFTs and a fungible token in $ELEKTRA, **we are able to collectively monetize and own the world we are building together**. \n\nTwo weeks ago, we [launched a crowdfund](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc) here on Mirror to fund the Elektra project. Backers received both a Portal Ticket NFT and $ELEKTRA. These tokens allow them to participate in the interactive elements of the *Elektra* world — which work a lot like an escape game on Discord and the [elektra.camp](https://elektra.camp/#/) website. \n\nA 75% share of the $ELEKTRA token was retained by the project, the majority of which will go towards the camp participants working to create *Elektra*. Once *Phase 1* of the Elektra project is complete in mid-August, these tokens will be airdropped to creators based on their contributions — and the Elektra DAO will be born.\n\n**The DAO’s mission is to continue to develop and steward the artwork and intellectual property created in building *Elektra***. This framework for collective decision making will allow for a distributed group of contributors with dynamic skin in the game to have a voice on how this world continues to grow and realize value. \n\nThe power that comes from collective ownership is what will fuel the creative revolution we are now peering into. It will afford us the ability to create and inhabit the imaginative landscapes we want, and find new avenues to sustainability in our creative work. \n\nIn time, it will not be Hollywood that makes our most popular movies. We will make our own. \n\n[Log 1: Welcome to Elektra](split://0xd6C9247A551e4a8e4eDd0c3e15b6b040C3BA71e2?network=mainnet)", "timestamp": 1627422469, "digest": "HaQAd8PInTpf-I7EUzqDh03JVpwJX3oQmZzBpAZcKqo", "contributor": "0xfC4852B5e3aF65058CdfE1D1dce26946c0C1975f"}

{"id": "om50nXYTIpEOThhWZdL5XFl1Qr0FX0yZS2ADvj0Gptk", "title": "Beacon Book: Graphics & Narratives ", "body": "**This post is an exploration of the graphics and narratives used throughout the Beacon Book,a collection of perspectives from 46 researchers and implementers that worked on the Ethereum Beacon Chain.**\n\n*The full text of the Beacon Book went live on Tuesday, July 6th, alongside a series of 7 NFTs taken directly from the book. We're opening the auction for the 100 physical Genesis Editions soon. Sign up below to be notified when the auction begins and is close to ending.*\n\n*→ [Read and Mint here](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA)*\n\n*→ [Sign up to be notified](https://forms.gle/TsGyb5gUpXwN9FEt8)*\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nAt its core, the Beacon Book is a dual tribute to both the Beacon Chain builders and the Ethereum community. This post is a meta-outline of the visual techniques and considerations used to express a number of themes, including: \n\n- juxtaposition of human vs geological / social scales;\n- physical vs digital;\n- the otherworldly nature of this technology;\n- the symbiotic relationship between a community and what it builds, the machine that builds the machine, the garden that tends itself.\n\nEach section below follows this format: **Title** (Page Number). Commentary is paired with 11 of the 30 spreads from the book. The seven two page spreads were minted as NFTs within the original text, and can be viewed [here](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA). Where applicable, there are short descriptions that were minted as part of the NFT metadata: \n\n> NFT descriptions are in this formatting\n*Primary minting availability is noted in italics.*\n1. Commentary is in numbered point form.\n2. Here you will find discussion of the graphic elements, as well as points on What It Means.\n\nPlease note that the interpretations here describe possibilities, but are by no means \"official.\" Make your own narratives, your own meanings. Let's begin!\n\n---\n\n### Back and Front Covers\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/60f7317b-2d3c-4dad-bf26-a4c1dbe4fa32.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n*Left: back cover / Right, front cover*\n\n1. A fully suited astronaut stands in almost complete darkness, arm outstretched to their left side. The only illumination comes from three pure white orbs  hovering over the open hand, casting a faint glow onto the arm and torso. Overlaying the orbs are three phrases: \"Beacon Book,\" \"Stateful Works,\" and \"Genesis Edition.\" \n2. This anonymous character simultaneously represents the researchers and implementers, as well as the supporting community that has followed the Beacon Chain since Serenity.\n3. This is a physical book, with a front and back cover. It can be held, paged through and bent. It's a reaction against the almost exclusively digital experience of crypto communities. This is an artifact you can hold in your hands, a material representation of the researchers you follow. It materializes the ephemeral nature of community participation. Your book contains their stories, and your ownership of the book makes you part of the larger story: Ethereum's story.\n\n### Internal Cover (i-ii)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c24b7ff3-869b-429c-aec5-50455038e5ed.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. The first page of content is almost completely white, save for the three circles from the cover reproduced in the same position. However, here they are negatives, punching through the white page to reveal a bright red landscape beneath. The edge of the voids cast a sickle-shaped shadow  onto the landscape below. Sitting on the landscape under the shadow are the same three phrases from the cover.\n2. A dotted black line cuts across the page at the same angle of the shadows, intersecting two smaller white circles. These two circles cast the same shadow as the three voids. Let's call this \"the sundial.\"\n\n### Provenance (1-2)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9623c93b-a2f5-4deb-8552-b90bf3a09b38.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. The majority of this spread is the red landscape: texture and colors emerge. A floating white tablet hovers over it, punched through with a ring, casting shadows. A diagonal line passes over and under the white components, graphic elements which are repeated on subsequent pages.\n2. Relative to the previous spread, the cast shadow shifts, almost imperceptibly. This pattern will be maintained on each successive page throughout the rest of the book. \n3. Some time has passed, and the sundial rotates to match the shift in the cast shadow.\n4. The right page contains space for unique provenance attributes. The upper portion has space to mark the edition, eg. 1/100. The bottom half of the tablet contains a grid for book owners to write a personally meaningful transaction hash to make this copy truly theirs. At the bottom, a set of lines for marking other edition information. \n\n### Introduction (3-4)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ca961ed1-e0f1-4d81-95c3-3d44464811da.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. This is the first spread which contains copy, introducing the participating characters and outlining the vision for the book.\n2. A semicircular void is cut out of the white background, again revealing the tones of the red soil beneath. This repeats in several variations throughout the rest of the book. \n3. On the right page, a new graphic element: a space-suited hand extends into the frame to present a white tablet filled with text.\n4. This is the hand of the astronaut mirroring your own as you hold the book. This is the community, the researchers, the developers, and you as coequal participant. This is human agency shaping immaterial infrastructure. In turn, their book of profiles frames your story. \n\n### \"Continuations\" (7-8)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fab9171b-5e8f-4536-8d8b-3059c779e72f.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> We've always been moving. There is no neat beginning, only a point when we become aware of our place the stories, our story.\n\n*This spread is available to [mint as an NFT](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA) within the Beacon Book text.*\n\n1. This is the first of the NFT series launched with the digital text. We see the same red landscape as in previous spreads. Floating traincars, covered in vents and antennae, loaded with large wooden crates move slowly along the dry, hot landscape. Walking alongside the vehicle is the same character from the cover, plus four more. Their footprints leave a faint imprint in the crunching surface. The figures cast a long, crisp shadow, almost in line with their path of travel, which is incidentally the same angle as the diagonal lines on the previous two spreads.\n3. A white frame sits at on the outer edge of the pages, casting the same angle of shadow as the landscape contained within. The shadow falls on the landscape without differentiation relative to the objects, as if it were the flat surface of a print. Are we witnessing the scene as external observers? Or is this a record of our collective past and future? Historic, cinematic, participatory. \n4. Within the frame are a series of text objects. In the top left, a 0x  hash sequence with 64 characters. This is the 0 slot block root from the start of the Beacon Chain on Dec 5th, 2020. This pattern repeats on each of the subsequent graphic spreads. On the right side is an unidentified alphanumeric string.\n5. The astronauts are us, the researchers, the community: one and the same. Anonymous to the observer, confident in their purpose, comfortable in their unfamiliar environment. Our vantage point shows the small human details of their stride, their posture, their humanity. They are on a journey which has always being ongoing.\n\n### \"Caravans\" (11-12)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0a8e0318-b74b-48cc-8fa0-66cd176108a8.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Resources, effort, coordination, logistics. The material realities to ensure the success of a venture. Careful contingency planning over the years.\n\n*This spread is available to [mint as an NFT](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA) within the Beacon Book text.*\n\n1. The border frame zooms out even further, allowing us to see a broader view of the resources needed to complete the journey. In addition to large and small crates, there are large reels of cable, and frames holding linear tube. Most of the astronauts continue alongside the train on foot, resolutely maintaining their diagonal intent. \n2. The shadow growing from the feet of the characters shortens again as the sun climbs higher in the sky. Is this the same day? Are days hundreds of hours on this planet? Time is a poor yardstick - after all, we are here to see the journey through to the end.\n3. At the top left of the frame, the first slot hash from the Beacon Chain, with its block graffiti in the lower right: \"Mr F was here.\" On the left side is another unidentified string.\n\n### \"Discovery\" (17-18) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/351270ba-5f51-402f-a1db-47b0707e036e.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Found objects. Breakthroughs and productive interference are a happy pair. Planned and unexpected deviations from the spec.\n\n1. Our frame steps back slightly, the characters occupying less of the frame. They have happened upon a previously constructed foundation, crowned with rusted rebar. \n2. The deposit contract has been located. Satisfied with its soundness, it's time to build. \n3. The top right of the frame has the text of the second slot hash, the left another string, the bottom right the grafitti \"BTCS Zug validator.\"\n\n###  Edgington - Beekhuizen (19-20) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e1e05826-b129-45d0-a469-e9fe43ef4691.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n1. Another recurring graphic element are hands reaching in from out of frame: an echo of the introduction spread. Including the cover, there are seven occurrences of different hands.\n2. At this point, the Sundial is rotated nearly 45° below horizontal, with the shadow angles to match. \n\n### \"Build - Maintain\" (23-24) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f8c26d5f-0bfa-4863-be42-accf5bfbfea9.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> The shape of what we're crafting appears, bit by bit. The continued application of effort yields progress. Vision and belief form narratives.\n\n1. Our vantage point continues its steady progress backwards, encompassing a sprawling construction site. The trains have stopped and are being unloaded, materials staged next to the deposit contract foundation. The community has poured a new concrete base on top, and added the first section of the tower: two Ethereum logos peek out from within the struts. Additional wires are added to stabilize the structure. \n2. The acts of building and maintaining are two sides of the same coin, in a similar relationship as what builders offers to their community.\n3. The top right of the frame has the text of the third Beacon Chain slot hash, and an string of text to the right.\n\n### \"Seen and Seeing\" (29-30) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aae769df-9b10-4577-9fa7-5a2e8cbe94e1.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Anticipation builds, the community gathers to witness transition. Grassroots infrastructure emerges from a fertile soil.\n\n1. Construction continues apace, with 2 more tower sections added and anchored by stay wires. As it nears completion, the participants gather to witness. The trains are emptied of their goods and put to the side - there's not much else to do but wait until the appointed time. Six Ethereum logos occupy the center of the unfinished tower. \n2. The success of the Beacon Chain launch was due in no small part to the grassroots community of passionate validators. This spread is an homage to their observations, reports, bug-fixes, tests and claimed POAPs.\n3. The frame contains a strong to the left, the fourth slot hash, and that slot's graffiti: \"🐠 Welcome to the New Beginning\"\n\n### \"Traditions\" (35-36) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f1a0f7ab-4779-46f8-a016-9fbc81e67acc.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> Bated breath, ticking forward into change. There is joy in the shared collective experience of a milestone reached, challenges conquered.\n\n1. Participants and observers have gathered to witness the massive accomplishment of the Beacon finally being operational! After many years of research, scrapped roadmaps, implementations, testing: the first milestone is complete. \n2. Continuing its steady clockwise drift, the shadow seems to pause and resolves into an Ethereum logo.\n3. A regular tradition of the Ethereum community is watch parties for upgrade transitions. The Beacon Chain launch had  the entire community sitting in nervous anticipation, waiting  to step past the threshold of a years-long journey. It was finally here, and worth celebrating.\n4. Validator 18675 missed their appointed slot; as such there is no slot hash. One text string sits on both the left and right.\n\n### \"Onward\" (57-58) \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/84962b5b-471d-4953-9733-35d1052c4508.png?height=2500&width=3000)\n\n> We've always been moving. There is no clear end, only the continuous challenge to make our work accessible to those outside our orbit. We're aware of the story, and now we write the next chapter.\n\n1. Our frame of reference takes one final step back to reveal our broadest view of the landscape. To close out the book, we're presented with a fractal loop between society and human agency. Our protagonists pass through the hand of society, beginning to engage. This is the same hand that held the orbs on the cover, and held our stories throughout the book. This is the context we build within and for, the physical places we occupy. \n2. The sun has dropped low into the horizon, beckoning the group forward.\n3. The narrative arc of Progress >> Resolution was resolved within \"Traditions,\" but it's important to remember that we don't build in a vaccum, and the journey is far from over. We still need to pursue The Merge, statelessness, data and execution sharding, VDFs, ZKPs - not to mention making these powerful tools operable for those outside our niche.\n4.  Our final frame has the 6th slot hash from the Beacon Chain, as well as its graffiti: \"poapcRzSC/a0Ns7TJ6jGWhRJGqBMLKEB.\" A final string of letters and numbers sits to on the left of the frame.\n\n---\n\nThank you for reading this graphic explication of the Beacon Book, we hope it was interesting to learn about the graphic themes and narratives expressed throughout. Your role as a participant is crucial to the soul of what we're building together.\n\n---\n\n*The full text of the Beacon Book went live on Tuesday, July 6th, alongside a series of 7 NFTs taken directly from the book.

They are sold at a specific time (where you can mint them) and they act as a gateway to being part of a community. An algorithm creates a randomized NFT by combining attributes such as background, clothes, or accessories. These traits have unequal distribution, so certain avatars are favored above others. People are always looking for the rarest and most aesthetic avatars because these made the best profile pictures (PFP).\n\nThe number of unique users who acquired the NFTs and the price floor define the early success of the collectible project. Users don’t know what NFT they will receive until they purchase it through the website. Buyers' behavior mimics that of gamblers, who place bets in the hopes of winning an avatar with unique characteristics. Collectors are often compelled to buy multiple items to boost their chances of obtaining the best-looking NFT to multiply their initial value.\n\n**How it all started?**\n\nThis whole trend began in 2017 with CryptoPunks, one of the first NFT collectibles. Larva Labs hit all the right notes with their concept's simplicity, laying the groundwork for future projects. CryptoPunks has gone a long way since its humble beginnings in a remote corner of the internet and is now the top-grossing NFT collection. The punks' strength stems in part from being the first avatar collection craze at the time, but blaming it on this merely undervalues the creativity of the concept. Collectibles have been around since kids traded sports cards, but turning them into an avatar to be used as a symbol of identity was a brilliant move. As a profile photo, the CryptoPunk identified people as part of a bigger whole that stood for something and revolted against centralized finance.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11934913-5f8c-44f4-89a0-e8ed9497ded1.png?height=630&width=1200)\n\n**How did they become mainstream?**\n\nWhen the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched in early May 2021, it built on the foundations laid down by CryptoPunks. BAYC became the first true NFT-club by combining the fundamentals of avatarisation and community-building with a layer of exclusivity. They have several perks like BAYC-radio and members-only goods. The enigmatic promise that the apes will \"unlock digital doors for you\" makes it even more exclusive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1e6beb7a-552c-4332-84d6-57940004aad3.png?height=666&width=1000)\n\nAfter the initial boom, they kept pioneering the space when they gifted a dog companion (Bored Ape Kennel Club) to every ape owner, raising the ape value and adding a new dog NFT worth 1.5 ETH (around $3,000) before it was revealed.\n\n**What are the most popular projects out there?**\n\nThere are more than 50 projects out there, and the numbers are rapidly increasing each week.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d459dd1a-8d67-480c-b1bd-99a2b1045f60.png?height=748&width=1479)\n\nApart from the two previously mentioned projects, other great contenders to become the new best NFT collectible project are (in no order):\n\n- Cool Cats\n- Gutter Cat Gang\n- Meebits\n- VeeFriends\n- The Wicked Craniums\n- DeadHeads\n- GoatZ\n- The Alien Boy\n- … and many more\n\n**What the future holds?**\n\nSince BAYC, several projects followed that path and launched their collectible project. Some of them have a lower (Gutter Cat Gang with 3,000) or a higher collection (The Wicked Craniums with 10,762), and others have added new mechanisms like forging 2 NFTs into 1 (The Forge by GoatZ).\n\nTo grasp the current scale, you must look at the sales figures. For instance, Mike Tyson just spent $10,000 on a cartoon cat avatar.\n\nCommercial Rights, which are transferred with the token, could also bring to the owners some profit from their asset. There are talks of a movie being made with DeadHeads, which could give a flow of payments to asset holders whose PFPs are used in the film.\n\nA new utility for holding these avatars is being announced each passing week. From exclusive merch to airdrops, breeding, or a place in the metaverse for the community.\n\nWe're still months or years away from true acceptance, but when more built-out 3D virtual environments like Decentraland and Sandbox are used, NFT PFP holders will be able to utilize their PFPs as a 3D avatar in the metaverse world. This will give the assets more shape and utility.\n\nDisclaimer: We are proud owners of several of these NFT collectibles, so we’re looking forward to seeing how this space evolves and what it can bring to holders.\n\n## DAOs\nby Awisemaninmotion\n\nDAOs are to 2021 what Defi was to 2020.\n\nAs is natural with any trend, you're going to get all kinds of takes on what it is and what it isn't. \nEarly adapters are going to go through experimental growing pains, and those who are paying attention to the ecosystem at large are poised to make the best strides going forward. \n\nIn other words, these are the nascent days of DAOs. To be part of one is to be part of an ongoing experiment that will (hopefully) change the way the world interacts and collaborates. \n\nHowever, like with any new and exciting idea, it can be easy to loose the forest from the trees.\n\nThe people who can speak to running a DAO are outnumbered by those who have questions about running one.\n\nSome of the most common comments I've heard so far regarding DAOs and Web3 have been:\n\nShould I start a DAO on Discord or Telegram? Is Slack still a thing? \n\nWhen/how should I mint a token? \n\nWhat web3 wallet should I use? \n\nWhat's a test network/sub chain?\n\nAre DAOs just places to talk about NFTs and Crypto?\n\nIf you've been part of a DAO for awhile, the questions get more granular:\n\nWhere is that article/tweet/meme someone posted the other day?\n\nWhere do I find (insert question here)?\n\nWhen are we going to mint our token?\n\nShould we be voting on everything?\n\nWhat do we do with users who just hang around and don't want to actively participate? \n\nThe Discord and the Discourse are in Disarray and I'm at a loss for what to Do.\n\nDAOs have many things to work through, but one of the most pressing things I see is how to scale one from an operations point of view. Discord may be the chat platform of choice at the moment, but it wasn't made for the kind of dynamic collaboration DAOs strive to become. \nMore activity and more members come at the expense of lost links and buried knowledge. \n\nUnless you have a background in project management, or worked in operations, you're likely to overlook this problem until you can't ignore it. The truth is that if you're all in on DAOs, or collaboration in the web3 world you WILL eventually have this problem. \n\nSince we are currently in a web 2.5 world, and will realistically be in this hybrid state for at least few years, what tools can you use to get ahead of this problem? \n\nTo answer this, you have to ask yourself a few questions:\n\n- [ ]  Are you a web3 maximalist that is opposed to a web2 solution?\n- [ ]  Are you willing to solve for now, and figure out how to transition to something thats on chain in the future?\n- [ ]  Are you putting community or technology first?\n\nOnce you honestly answer those questions then you can look for a solution that fits your view. Although, depending on how you answered, not all of these questions have clear solutions. \n\nTo clarify, it's not that there aren't tools to solve aspects of these problems, but each comes with their own issues, and not all play nicely with each other. \n\nRemember, you're a glorified beta tester in an experimental ecosystem. A vast majority of the roads are still under construction ⚠️ and gaps are the norm. \n\nHowever, if you currently run a DAO, one of the most important questions to ask yourself is: \nCan you afford to wait it out for a solution that doesn't currently exist?  \n\nScaling is a natural part of growth and success. There's only so long one can wait on technology, and the more you grow and take on, the less time you likely have to wait. \nI'd rather solve for now and adapt accordingly. As Shiny starts to take its next form in the web3 world, I was adamant on implementing a solution that can work alongside Discord. I didn't want to replace it, but I also didn't want to rely on it.\n\nThat meant building a solution that can currently: \n\n- [ ]  Let those who want to participate have their own space to see what they're responsible for.\n- [ ]  Let teams see a top-level view of the projects they're part of, and see progress in real-time.\n- [ ]  Let people work asynchronously\n- [ ]  Let contributors see what team meetings they're part of, as well as community meetings they would like to be a part of.\n- [ ]  Allow for meetings to be properly documented \n(This means having the ability to get a high-level overview of what was discussed, including access to an audio recording of the meeting if one was recorded)\n- [ ]  Let users assign tasks during a meeting, and have those tasks automatically show up inside participants dashboards.\n\nThis Mirror post was conceived on call and then devised and completed on such a setup. It allowed us to do all of the above in a fluent way. \n\nIf organizing and distributing tasks and bounties are pain points your DAO is currently experiencing, reach out.\n\n## No-code\nby Dykso\n\n**What does the word NoCode mean to you?**\n\nIf you had to explain it to your family, could you summarize it in one sentence? I say maybe since the NoCode space can be broken down into multiple solution verticals. Sometimes I think we try to stuff too much meaning into the NoCode term and marketing teams love to overuse the word.  To us, NoCode is enabling solutions to be implemented by non-coders that are usually implemented by development teams.  The complexity of the solution being implemented can vary drastically and some NoCode tools are targeted at developers that are looking to expedite the implementation of solutions.\n\nAs someone new to the NoCode space, you might find it difficult to determine what effort you will need to invest and become proficient in implementing solutions using NoCode tools. In this short write-up, we will discuss the web application builders vertical to give you an idea of the effort it could take to get comfortable with these tools.\n\nSo what type of NoCode tool falls into the web application builder category? It’s a tool that allows you to build the front-end user interface of your website application at the minimum but it could go way beyond that in the features you’re provided with.  This category is very busy and it keeps evolving every week as seen in our discord NoCode channels at Shiny.\n\nWe feel the best way to present this information is through a matrix that rates the website builders in a few key areas on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is the high score. This will allow you to make a decision where to start with your next website project.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8005153e-34e9-43e4-846f-cc6a23992a5d.jpeg?height=381&width=632)\n\nOur evaluations are really based on first impressions from an end-user perspective, we assume you are not a professional website designer or builder.  We also wanted to give you some idea of how well these products support you as you start your journey with these tools.  Some of these tools will require you to have familiarity with connecting to 3rd party data sources that host your website databases.  We call them data integrations and this will require an additional investment of time on your part to learn.  \n\nThat's it for now but if you read this far thank you for your attention!\n\nWe appreciate everyone who's working hard to bring more people into these spaces and look forward to helping!\n\nShiny Object SC", "timestamp": 1627480988, "digest": "rw7-SaSszEVHtoOFW9T9d8KdxZeq1CTRkhYmDxEVKDw", "contributor": "0x54681ac94D4e3C8F58F54B576B654DC2D1950ae0"}

These internet native, fully distributed organizations are what the internet was designed for and with new Web3 tooling, we're sitting at the cusp of an entirely new era.\n\n**That said we have 2 core missions:**\n\nFirstly, discover, share and help others learn about the most exciting technologies and trends that are reshaping the world we live in. \n\nThis could range from links being shared in Discord, to Live Workshops, Quests, Bounties, Events, Credentials, or spending time inside Shiny HQ in the Metaverse.\n\nSecondly, build and help others build useful and exciting things with these technologies that help people advance their missions.\n\nIf you're an Individual Creator, DAO, Collective or Traditional Organisation looking to bring more Automation, explore NFTs, launch a Token Gated Discord or build a Headquarters in the Metaverse, then we can help you do it. \n\nEither we work with you to post a Bounty for Members to complete, or we find you the people who can help.\n\nSome of the services we currently offer in-house or via partners are:\n\n- Automation\n- No-code / Low-code Apps\n- Token Gated Discord Design\n- Notion Design and Consulting (DAO Specific)\n- Treasury Creation (DAO Specific)\n- Branding and Positioning\n- Social Token Design\n- NFTs\n- Augmented Reality Strategy + Filters\n\nIf you're a Creator, Start-up, or DAO looking for help with any of the above please get in touch here.\n\nMore than anything else we want everything we do to be exciting so whether that's chatting away in Discord or partnering up with a couple of members \n\n**Structure**\n\nThe Shiny Object Social Club is operating as a Social and Service DAO with a shared Treasury using a Gnosis Safe and will be launching a Social Token which will act as a core part of how the community operates into the future.  All systems and projects completed are created by members of the community and we're always on the lookout to add more talented people with the shiniest of skillsets!\n\nCurrently, we're looking for people with skills in:\n\n- Content Curation\n- Solidity\n- Visual Design\n- 3D Design\n- Unity\n- Voxel Art\n- Game Design\n- GraphQL\n- Experience Design\n\nIf you have mad skills in any of the above and would love to help build some Shiny Objects then get in touch on Discord here.\n\n[Mirror Mag #001](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=85)\n\nNow some contributions from the community on the areas we cover.\n\n## NFTs\nby Danidr\n\n**What are they?**\n\nNFT collectibles are similar to traditional collectibles - think of childhood trading cards - except they're digital things that are scarce thanks to blockchain technology. They are sold at a specific time (where you can mint them) and they act as a gateway to being part of a community. An algorithm creates a randomized NFT by combining attributes such as background, clothes, or accessories. These traits have unequal distribution, so certain avatars are favored above others. People are always looking for the rarest and most aesthetic avatars because these made the best profile pictures (PFP).\n\nThe number of unique users who acquired the NFTs and the price floor define the early success of the collectible project. Users don’t know what NFT they will receive until they purchase it through the website. Buyers' behavior mimics that of gamblers, who place bets in the hopes of winning an avatar with unique characteristics. Collectors are often compelled to buy multiple items to boost their chances of obtaining the best-looking NFT to multiply their initial value.\n\n**How it all started?**\n\nThis whole trend began in 2017 with CryptoPunks, one of the first NFT collectibles. Larva Labs hit all the right notes with their concept's simplicity, laying the groundwork for future projects. CryptoPunks has gone a long way since its humble beginnings in a remote corner of the internet and is now the top-grossing NFT collection. The punks' strength stems in part from being the first avatar collection craze at the time, but blaming it on this merely undervalues the creativity of the concept. Collectibles have been around since kids traded sports cards, but turning them into an avatar to be used as a symbol of identity was a brilliant move. As a profile photo, the CryptoPunk identified people as part of a bigger whole that stood for something and revolted against centralized finance.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11934913-5f8c-44f4-89a0-e8ed9497ded1.png?height=630&width=1200)\n\n**How did they become mainstream?**\n\nWhen the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched in early May 2021, it built on the foundations laid down by CryptoPunks. BAYC became the first true NFT-club by combining the fundamentals of avatarisation and community-building with a layer of exclusivity. They have several perks like BAYC-radio and members-only goods. The enigmatic promise that the apes will \"unlock digital doors for you\" makes it even more exclusive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1e6beb7a-552c-4332-84d6-57940004aad3.png?height=666&width=1000)\n\nAfter the initial boom, they kept pioneering the space when they gifted a dog companion (Bored Ape Kennel Club) to every ape owner, raising the ape value and adding a new dog NFT worth 1.5 ETH (around $3,000) before it was revealed.\n\n**What are the most popular projects out there?**\n\nThere are more than 50 projects out there, and the numbers are rapidly increasing each week.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d459dd1a-8d67-480c-b1bd-99a2b1045f60.png?height=748&width=1479)\n\nApart from the two previously mentioned projects, other great contenders to become the new best NFT collectible project are (in no order):\n\n- Cool Cats\n- Gutter Cat Gang\n- Meebits\n- VeeFriends\n- The Wicked Craniums\n- DeadHeads\n- GoatZ\n- The Alien Boy\n- … and many more\n\n**What the future holds?**\n\nSince BAYC, several projects followed that path and launched their collectible project. Some of them have a lower (Gutter Cat Gang with 3,000) or a higher collection (The Wicked Craniums with 10,762), and others have added new mechanisms like forging 2 NFTs into 1 (The Forge by GoatZ).\n\nTo grasp the current scale, you must look at the sales figures. For instance, Mike Tyson just spent $10,000 on a cartoon cat avatar.\n\nCommercial Rights, which are transferred with the token, could also bring to the owners some profit from their asset. There are talks of a movie being made with DeadHeads, which could give a flow of payments to asset holders whose PFPs are used in the film.\n\nA new utility for holding these avatars is being announced each passing week. From exclusive merch to airdrops, breeding, or a place in the metaverse for the community.\n\nWe're still months or years away from true acceptance, but when more built-out 3D virtual environments like Decentraland and Sandbox are used, NFT PFP holders will be able to utilize their PFPs as a 3D avatar in the metaverse world. This will give the assets more shape and utility.\n\nDisclaimer: We are proud owners of several of these NFT collectibles, so we’re looking forward to seeing how this space evolves and what it can bring to holders.\n\n## DAOs\nby Awisemaninmotion\n\nDAOs are to 2021 what Defi was to 2020.\n\nAs is natural with any trend, you're going to get all kinds of takes on what it is and what it isn't. \nEarly adapters are going to go through experimental growing pains, and those who are paying attention to the ecosystem at large are poised to make the best strides going forward. \n\nIn other words, these are the nascent days of DAOs. To be part of one is to be part of an ongoing experiment that will (hopefully) change the way the world interacts and collaborates. \n\nHowever, like with any new and exciting idea, it can be easy to loose the forest from the trees.\n\nThe people who can speak to running a DAO are outnumbered by those who have questions about running one.\n\nSome of the most common comments I've heard so far regarding DAOs and Web3 have been:\n\nShould I start a DAO on Discord or Telegram? Is Slack still a thing? \n\n- When/how should I mint a token? \n- What web3 wallet should I use? \n- What's a test network/sub chain?\n- Are DAOs just places to talk about NFTs and Crypto?\n\nIf you've been part of a DAO for awhile, the questions get more granular:\n\n- Where is that article/tweet/meme someone posted the other day?\n- Where do I find (insert question here)?\n- When are we going to mint our token?\n- Should we be voting on everything?\n- What do we do with users who just hang around and don't want to actively participate? \n- The Discord and the Discourse are in Disarray and I'm at a loss for what to Do.\n\nDAOs have many things to work through, but one of the most pressing things I see is how to scale one from an operations point of view. Discord may be the chat platform of choice at the moment, but it wasn't made for the kind of dynamic collaboration DAOs strive to become. \nMore activity and more members come at the expense of lost links and buried knowledge. \n\nUnless you have a background in project management or worked in operations, you're likely to overlook this problem until you can't ignore it. The truth is that if you're all in on DAOs, or collaboration in the web3 world you WILL eventually have this problem. \n\nSince we are currently in a web 2.5 world, and will realistically be in this hybrid state for at least few years, what tools can you use to get ahead of this problem? \n\nTo answer this, you have to ask yourself a few questions:\n\n- [ ]  Are you a web3 maximalist that is opposed to a web2 solution?\n- [ ]  Are you willing to solve for now, and figure out how to transition to something thats on chain in the future?\n- [ ]  Are you putting community or technology first?\n\nOnce you honestly answer those questions then you can look for a solution that fits your view. Although, depending on how you answered, not all of these questions have clear solutions. \n\nTo clarify, it's not that there aren't tools to solve aspects of these problems, but each comes with their own issues, and not all play nicely with each other. \n\nRemember, you're a glorified beta tester in an experimental ecosystem. A vast majority of the roads are still under construction ⚠️ and gaps are the norm. \n\nHowever, if you currently run a DAO, one of the most important questions to ask yourself is: \nCan you afford to wait it out for a solution that doesn't currently exist?  \n\nScaling is a natural part of growth and success. There's only so long one can wait on technology, and the more you grow and take on, the less time you likely have to wait. \nI'd rather solve for now and adapt accordingly. As Shiny starts to take its next form in the web3 world, I was adamant on implementing a solution that can work alongside Discord. I didn't want to replace it, but I also didn't want to rely on it.\n\nThat meant building a solution that can currently: \n\n- [ ]  Let those who want to participate have their own space to see what they're responsible for.\n- [ ]  Let teams see a top-level view of the projects they're part of, and see progress in real-time.\n- [ ]  Let people work asynchronously\n- [ ]  Let contributors see what team meetings they're part of, as well as community meetings they would like to be a part of.\n- [ ]  Allow for meetings to be properly documented \n(This means having the ability to get a high-level overview of what was discussed, including access to an audio recording of the meeting if one was recorded)\n- [ ]  Let users assign tasks during a meeting, and have those tasks automatically show up inside participants dashboards.\n\nThis Mirror post was conceived on call and then devised and completed on such a setup. It allowed us to do all of the above in a fluent way. \n\nIf organizing and distributing tasks and bounties are pain points your DAO is currently experiencing, reach out.\n\n## No-code\nby Dykso\n\n**What does the word NoCode mean to you?**\n\nIf you had to explain it to your family, could you summarize it in one sentence? I say maybe since the NoCode space can be broken down into multiple solution verticals. Sometimes I think we try to stuff too much meaning into the NoCode term and marketing teams love to overuse the word.  To us, NoCode is enabling solutions to be implemented by non-coders that are usually implemented by development teams.  The complexity of the solution being implemented can vary drastically and some NoCode tools are targeted at developers that are looking to expedite the implementation of solutions.\n\nAs someone new to the NoCode space, you might find it difficult to determine what effort you will need to invest and become proficient in implementing solutions using NoCode tools. In this short write-up, we will discuss the web application builders vertical to give you an idea of the effort it could take to get comfortable with these tools.\n\nSo what type of NoCode tool falls into the web application builder category? It’s a tool that allows you to build the front-end user interface of your website application at the minimum but it could go way beyond that in the features you’re provided with.  This category is very busy and it keeps evolving every week as seen in our discord NoCode channels at Shiny.\n\nWe feel the best way to present this information is through a matrix that rates the website builders in a few key areas on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is the high score. This will allow you to make a decision where to start with your next website project.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8005153e-34e9-43e4-846f-cc6a23992a5d.jpeg?height=381&width=632)\n\nOur evaluations are really based on first impressions from an end-user perspective, we assume you are not a professional website designer or builder.  We also wanted to give you some idea of how well these products support you as you start your journey with these tools.  Some of these tools will require you to have familiarity with connecting to 3rd party data sources that host your website databases.  We call them data integrations and this will require an additional investment of time on your part to learn.  \n\nThat's it for now but if you read this far thank you for your attention!\n\nWe appreciate everyone who's working hard to bring more people into these spaces and look forward to helping!\n\nIf there is anything you think you'd like to build or need help with then please let us know on build@shinyobjects.gg.\n\nShiny Object SC", "timestamp": 1627482018, "digest": "rw7-SaSszEVHtoOFW9T9d8KdxZeq1CTRkhYmDxEVKDw", "contributor": "0x54681ac94D4e3C8F58F54B576B654DC2D1950ae0"}

We also wanted to give you some idea of how well these products support you as you start your journey with these tools.  Some of these tools will require you to have familiarity with connecting to 3rd party data sources that host your website databases.  We call them data integrations and this will require an additional investment of time on your part to learn.  \n\nThat's it for now but if you read this far thank you for your attention!\n\nWe appreciate everyone who's working hard to bring more people into these spaces and look forward to helping!\n\nIf there is anything you think you'd like to build or need help with then please let us know on build@shinyobjects.gg.\n\nShiny Object SC", "timestamp": 1627483016, "digest": "rw7-SaSszEVHtoOFW9T9d8KdxZeq1CTRkhYmDxEVKDw", "contributor": "0x54681ac94D4e3C8F58F54B576B654DC2D1950ae0"}
