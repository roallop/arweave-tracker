One year after *[*our first talk*](https://medium.com/@Benjamin_Prune/plumes-with-attitude-1-interview-with-anne-laure-le-cunff-69cedd6f2aac)*, Anne-Laure had written more than two hundred articles that brilliantly illustrate how writing can transform one’s life. Her company *[*Ness Labs*](https://nesslabs.com/)* has become an impressive library documenting her many experiments between creativity, productivity and neuroscience. The good news is that you’re all invited to learn more about her journey.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1424/1\\*GcqUIPoP0gA4CBxoq6T25Q.png)\n\n**Hi Anne-Laure and thank you for agreeing to come back for the first anniversary of the newsletter. A year ago, you chose to put writing back at the center of your life, between the creation of your **[**Maker Mind newsletter**](https://nesslabs.com/newsletter)** and almost daily publications for your company blog Ness Labs. So to start, can you tell me more about the benefits this new habit has brought to your life?**\n\nWhen I started in July 2019, I published one article a day during the workweek — taking the weekend off to rest. Since November 2019, when I reached my goal of [100 articles in 100 days](https://nesslabs.com/100-articles-100-days), I have been writing three articles and one newsletter per week. I have seen changes on three levels, starting with an effect on my creativity. It has completely changed the way I produce content. Today, I write as soon as I find an interesting idea to exploit, whereas it used to take me several weeks to research and rework topics. Writing has become a very important tool to develop my ideas and share them. It has also opened the doors to several communities and inspired me to create one of my own. Beyond a newsletter with 20,000 subscribers, Maker Mind now connects more than [600 curious minds](https://nesslabs.com/membership), trying like me to understand how the human brain works. Writing is how all these encounters happened, and how I connected with people I never imagined I would have access to one day. Which brings me to my last point: the many professional opportunities and collaboration requests I have received around themes that I am passionate about.\n\n**I will come back later on to the community aspect of Maker Mind. Before that, I want to know more about the links you do between writing and creativity. Can you explain to me how this synergy between the two materialized for you?**\n\nWhen you have a certain number of articles a week to produce, you can’t count on a whimsical muse to inspire you on demand. So to avoid the blank page syndrome, I had to set up creative systems. The first version was simply to get into the habit of writing down on a mobile app any idea I might have during the day. It’s like planting a seed of creativity every time you hear or read something interesting. And it worked very well for me for several months. Only I felt like I didn’t go far enough after a while: I took each idea separately, so I was leaving a lot of creative opportunities on the table.\n\n**And that’s when you discovered Roam Research!**\n\nExactly. I discovered [Roam](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research) in January 2020 and immediately thought it was the perfect tool to take things to the next level. Beyond allowing you to list your ideas in a linear fashion like a classic note-taking application, Roam proactively helps you connect them together. This principle of generating new and original ideas from the combination of several ideas has a name: [idea sex](https://nesslabs.com/inspiration-to-idea-sex) (or “combinational creativity”). That’s when I realized that my previous creativity system didn’t work as well, and I switched all my notes to Roam.\n\n**I’ve always wanted to try Roam, but I think its apparent complexity intimidated me for a while. Can you explain to me how you use it on a daily basis?**\n\nI know that the concept of combinational creativity may seem intimidating at first sight, but there is really nothing complicated about my use of Roam. First of all, I still jot down all my ideas on the fly in my mobile app when I’m on the go. Then, I set aside some time each day to open Roam and create a page for each idea — which I will detail as much as I can so that I can remember them accurately over the long term. Then I’ll take time to think about the potential links between my new ideas and the ones I’ve already noted. One of Roam’s key features is the ability to create links between all your ideas — which its algorithm can also suggest to you. Not only does it push you to follow interesting thinking trails, but the tool will also lead you to uncover surprising connections you wouldn’t have thought of otherwise. Finally, I also use Roam for what is called [interstitial journaling](https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling). It consists of taking a moment to document your thoughts between tasks. For example, I’ll go to Roam after our conversation and write down everything that came to mind during the interview. It’s basically a continuous [brain dump](https://nesslabs.com/productive-cognitive-load). It allows me to not worry about forgetting random insights when it’s not the priority of the moment, and to be able to come back to these later. So I use Roam as both a tool for creativity and productivity. In fact, it’s by far the tool that has had the most significant impact on my life, both for my professional work and personal well-being.\n\n**Well, I really need to give it a try then (laughs). And so, you’ve written over two hundred articles and about fifty editions of your newsletter in the last year thanks to your creativity system. Then I was wondering how you go about choosing the order in which you’re going to write particular topics. Basically, do you have an editorial schedule defined beforehand that follows a certain logic?**\n\nAbsolutely not. My creative system encourages me to proactively take notes, write and connect ideas every day. Beyond that, I don’t try to control anything else. There’s really an experimental part to it, in the sense that I never know in advance what I’m going to write about — and therefore the order in which I’m going to tackle the ideas in my creativity inbox. Rigid schedules are not my thing. I like to keep the flexibility to let ideas emerge at any time and to be able to follow the trail whenever one of them piques my curiosity.\n\n**That reminds me of your recent publication on **[**the different types of note-taking applications**](https://nesslabs.com/how-to-choose-the-right-note-taking-app)** grouped into three types of approaches: those of the architect, the librarian and the gardener.**\n\nDefinitely. In this case, I have more of a gardener’s approach. There are two classic mistakes I’ve identified when talking to other people about these note-taking tools. The first one is to choose a system that doesn’t fit your creative style. If you have messy style, with ideas that come from all over the place, you don’t need to force yourself to adopt an architect’s approach. And all the more so because there is no system that is superior to another. There’s no problem with not being very orderly in your way of thinking, quite the contrary. In this situation, the gardener’s approach can help you make the most of your creative style. The second mistake is to think that you can’t deviate from the category you are in. Personally, I find myself to be more comfortable in a gardener’s system, but I also have affinities with the librarian’s approach. Depending on the situation, I’ll borrow from one or the other. Sometimes I even ask architects for advice to help me solve a problem that lends itself to it. So there’s nothing absolute: what is so great in this metaphorical classification is that it consists in knowing yourself better, so that you can build a system that is truly yours and can evolve with you.\n\n**I have this feeling that you truly live and experience what you write about. This is as true when you talk about the concepts and practices resulting from your creative system or when you openly share certain vulnerabilities. As if Maker Mind was a very intellectual approach to the diary exercise. So I was wondering: what was the biggest discovery you’ve made about yourself since you resumed writing?**\n\nFirst, you’re right about the experimental aspect of my work. That’s why I called my company Ness Labs: it’s my little lab and Maker Mind is my research diary. To come back to your question, I used to think I found my home in the tech world’s hustle and bustle. But in the past year, I realized that I really enjoyed the research and reflection process as well. I love working in a team, but I rediscovered the pleasure of being alone, digging into complex topics, and connecting ideas. When I was a child, my parents could leave me alone with my nose in the books all afternoon without me moving an inch. Writing somehow reconciled me with my inner bookworm (laughs).\n\n**That’s so nicely put (laughs)! We’ve covered the topics of creativity and productivity, and now I’d like to talk about what I consider the third pillar of Maker Mind: mental health. How has writing impacted this aspect in your life?**\n\nNote-taking and especially interstitial journaling allow me to identify warning signs of burnout. I experienced burnout in the past and the problem is that I could resist for a very long time without breaking down until it was too late. Today, I am able to act upstream by making decisions and adapting new strategies to prevent it from happening again.\n\n**I had just read **[**in your interview with Dan Shipper from Superorganizers**](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-anne-laure-le-cunff-wrote-200)** that burnout was a real starting point in the creation of Maker Mind. And I just wanted to ask you if you felt you had “cracked the code” of your personal balance or if you still felt at risk despite everything you put in place?**\n\nI don’t think it’s possible to “crack the code” like you say. On the other hand, I now have a much healthier relationship with my mental health. In particular, I have learned to accept that there are external stressors over which I have no control. Like many people, the lockdown has been a trying time for me. Even though I have found a system that works, I am no more able than anyone else to thrive without leaving my home for months. Twice this year, I announced to my readers that there would not be a weekly newsletter following difficult personal moments. Taking care of one’s mental health also means listening to oneself and knowing how to reconsider one’s priorities, with the guiding principle: “be kind to yourself”.\n\n**This year is also special in the sense that we have never talked about mental health as much as in 2020. Did the lockdown and all the news around Covid-19 influence your way of writing on the subject?**\n\nI have always talked about “mindful productivity” to put the emphasis on fulfillment rather than only focusing on goals and performance indicators. Among my readers, there are a lot of very ambitious, very passionate people who tend to work a lot. And indeed, this year’s context has made me insist in my articles on the idea that it’s more important than ever to accept that it’s not always possible to be productive, to also learn how to take the time to breathe and to reconcile with the idea of letting go.\n\n**During the confinement, you went further in this respect by creating a \\[paid] community around Maker Mind. What motivated you to go in that direction?**\n\nTo be very transparent with you, I started the community at a time when I was looking to generate recurring revenue with Ness Labs. It’s a healthy business model for the company, aligned with my values and the ones of my readers. It gives them the opportunity to meet each other, help each other, and move forward together in achieving their life goals. For my part, it allows me to focus on creating high value-added content and to get to know my community better.\n\n**Personally, I have the impression that building a community is more difficult to evaluate in terms of time invested than creating content. Since we were talking about burnout earlier, how do you make sure that it doesn’t become a time-consuming activity next to everything you already do with Maker Mind and Ness Labs?**\n\nTo tell the truth, I didn’t have to set any strict rules and there is nothing stressful about running this community. I’m fortunate to be surrounded by very emotionally intelligent members, some of whom have been following me for a while. I participate every week but I don’t have to force myself to do it. In fact, no one expects me to be available 24 hours a day to answer their questions. It’s a very calm community, not in the sense that nothing happens but because everyone respects each other’s time. I am very happy to see the members interact with each other without having to ask for my permission. For example, I think it’s great to see some members organizing working or writing sessions every day.\n\n**Paid communities are becoming more common for content creators to monetize their projects. Do you think it’s become a must to make a living from your writings?**\n\nThere are many counter-examples, with very high quality paid publications without a community component behind them. So I would say… not necessarily. Still, starting a community opens up many opportunities to better understand your audience and their needs. Personally, I’m very happy to have chosen to take Ness Labs in this direction. While I don’t see it as a prerequisite, I tend to encourage content creators to explore this path.\n\n**In addition to having a community to run and your fast pace of publishing, you also went back to school for a Master’s degree in Neuroscience. What was your initial goal and how did it evolve with the development of your activity?**\n\nWhen I started, I really saw the Master’s degree as a personal need. I wanted to study the inner workings of the human brain. In a way, writing about it helped me consolidate my learning. What I studied in class was often the starting point for reflections in my articles. What I didn’t expect was for this personal curiosity to quickly turn into a real business with Ness Labs.\n\n**I’ve learned that your longer-term vision for Ness Labs is actually a school. I guess going back to class must have inspired you in that respect as well. In fact, I feel like the pieces of the puzzle are coming together very quickly, between everything you’ve got on Roam, all the educational content published this year, and a fast-growing paid community. So when you think about it, Ness Labs already looks a lot like a school. What are the priorities you want to develop for the future?**\n\nI’m fascinated by new models of education. I also find that there are a lot of topics that are not covered in a traditional school and that I think should be covered in a traditional school. Today, nothing that is taught in schools is adapted to the level of demand, self-reflection, flexibility, and also stress that the new work models bring about. That’s why I want to create an alternative education model, with a flexible and decentralized system that would allow everyone to enrich their way of thinking, creating and working. Today, there is already a lot of material on Ness Labs and you can actually dig into many subjects on your own. But I want to create a collection of courses that would explore these topics in depth over several weeks. These would cover topics like developing your creativity or managing your mental health at work, all based on neuroscience. This kind of curriculum is the brick that Ness Labs is currently missing and that I want to add to the edifice.\n\n**What are the new educational models that inspire you the most?**\n\nThere is of course Lambda School, which a lot of people have been following closely over the last few years. More recently, I’ve been particularly interested in On Deck, which brings education and community together better than anyone else. It’s a system of cohorts divided into several fellowships for founders, angels, but also writers and podcast hosts. And what is very powerful in this model is all the possible encounters, synergies and collaborations between individuals, cohorts and fellowships. A member of the writing fellowship will be able to help his cohort’s entrepreneurs with content strategy; these entrepreneurs will be able to receive investments from angels from previous cohorts; and so on. I am very curious to see how these community-based educational models will evolve.\n\n**For your part, you’ve already created a lot of educational content that covers a wide range of topics. Is there a particular one you haven’t written about yet that you would like to explore further?**\n\nOne topic I’ve already touched on but I’m very keen to explore further is ideation; where do ideas come from and how do they form in our brains? It’s all the more fascinating because there are several research streams. Some people have a rather analytical approach to ideation, approaching a problem from all angles to develop new ideas. Others have more of an “aha” moment or [shower thoughts](https://nesslabs.com/mind-wandering). I really want to understand what is going on in the brain at this level and to know if there are ways to increase our capacity for ideation. Right now, I am reading a fascinating and accessible [research paper](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.northwestern.edu/dist/a/699/files/2015/11/The-cognitive-neuroscience-of-insight-1jie1hg.pdf) on the subject by John Kounios, a neuroscience researcher. It’s a topic I’m looking forward to writing about.\n\n**And I’m already looking forward to reading it! We’re coming to the end of this new interview that I’ve been waiting for a long time. And what a journey since our first conversation! I’m both admiring and impressed by your evolution and that of Ness Labs. I will continue to follow all this closely, and probably also get into Roam for good (laughs). So thanks again to you Anne-Laure.**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1\\*feAC0AW5qV57-aYtpOroyA.gif)\n\n## 5 concepts worth exploring, according to Anne-Laure:\n\n*   [The Dunning–Kruger effect](https://nesslabs.com/dunning-kruger-effect)\n*   [Thinking in maps](https://nesslabs.com/thinking-in-maps)\n*   [Mind garden](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden)\n*   [The planning fallacy](https://nesslabs.com/planning-fallacy)\n*   [Thinking inside the box](https://nesslabs.com/systematic-inventive-thinking-inside-the-box)\n\n*If you love this interview, feel free to share it with people who might enjoy it too!

What I didn’t expect was for this personal curiosity to quickly turn into a real business with Ness Labs.\n\n**I’ve learned that your longer-term vision for Ness Labs is actually a school. I guess going back to class must have inspired you in that respect as well. In fact, I feel like the pieces of the puzzle are coming together very quickly, between everything you’ve got on Roam, all the educational content published this year, and a fast-growing paid community. So when you think about it, Ness Labs already looks a lot like a school. What are the priorities you want to develop for the future?**\n\nI’m fascinated by new models of education. I also find that there are a lot of topics that are not covered in a traditional school and that I think should be covered in a traditional school. Today, nothing that is taught in schools is adapted to the level of demand, self-reflection, flexibility, and also stress that the new work models bring about. That’s why I want to create an alternative education model, with a flexible and decentralized system that would allow everyone to enrich their way of thinking, creating and working. Today, there is already a lot of material on Ness Labs and you can actually dig into many subjects on your own. But I want to create a collection of courses that would explore these topics in depth over several weeks. These would cover topics like developing your creativity or managing your mental health at work, all based on neuroscience. This kind of curriculum is the brick that Ness Labs is currently missing and that I want to add to the edifice.\n\n**What are the new educational models that inspire you the most?**\n\nThere is of course Lambda School, which a lot of people have been following closely over the last few years. More recently, I’ve been particularly interested in On Deck, which brings education and community together better than anyone else. It’s a system of cohorts divided into several fellowships for founders, angels, but also writers and podcast hosts. And what is very powerful in this model is all the possible encounters, synergies and collaborations between individuals, cohorts and fellowships. A member of the writing fellowship will be able to help his cohort’s entrepreneurs with content strategy; these entrepreneurs will be able to receive investments from angels from previous cohorts; and so on. I am very curious to see how these community-based educational models will evolve.\n\n**For your part, you’ve already created a lot of educational content that covers a wide range of topics. Is there a particular one you haven’t written about yet that you would like to explore further?**\n\nOne topic I’ve already touched on but I’m very keen to explore further is ideation; where do ideas come from and how do they form in our brains? It’s all the more fascinating because there are several research streams. Some people have a rather analytical approach to ideation, approaching a problem from all angles to develop new ideas. Others have more of an “aha” moment or [shower thoughts](https://nesslabs.com/mind-wandering). I really want to understand what is going on in the brain at this level and to know if there are ways to increase our capacity for ideation. Right now, I am reading a fascinating and accessible [research paper](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.northwestern.edu/dist/a/699/files/2015/11/The-cognitive-neuroscience-of-insight-1jie1hg.pdf) on the subject by John Kounios, a neuroscience researcher. It’s a topic I’m looking forward to writing about.\n\n**And I’m already looking forward to reading it! We’re coming to the end of this new interview that I’ve been waiting for a long time. And what a journey since our first conversation! I’m both admiring and impressed by your evolution and that of Ness Labs. I will continue to follow all this closely, and probably also get into Roam for good (laughs). So thanks again to you Anne-Laure.**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1\\*feAC0AW5qV57-aYtpOroyA.gif)\n\n## 5 concepts worth exploring, according to Anne-Laure:\n\n*   [The Dunning–Kruger effect](https://nesslabs.com/dunning-kruger-effect)\n*   [Thinking in maps](https://nesslabs.com/thinking-in-maps)\n*   [Mind garden](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden)\n*   [The planning fallacy](https://nesslabs.com/planning-fallacy)\n*   [Thinking inside the box](https://nesslabs.com/systematic-inventive-thinking-inside-the-box)\n\n*If you love this interview, feel free to share it with people who might enjoy it too!

Her company *[*Ness Labs*](https://nesslabs.com/)* has become an impressive library documenting her many experiments between creativity, productivity and neuroscience. The good news is that you’re all invited to learn more about her journey.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1424/1\\*GcqUIPoP0gA4CBxoq6T25Q.png)\n\n**Hi Anne-Laure and thank you for agreeing to come back for the first anniversary of the newsletter. A year ago, you chose to put writing back at the center of your life, between the creation of your **[**Maker Mind newsletter**](https://nesslabs.com/newsletter)** and almost daily publications for your company blog Ness Labs. So to start, can you tell me more about the benefits this new habit has brought to your life?**\n\nWhen I started in July 2019, I published one article a day during the workweek — taking the weekend off to rest. Since November 2019, when I reached my goal of [100 articles in 100 days](https://nesslabs.com/100-articles-100-days), I have been writing three articles and one newsletter per week. I have seen changes on three levels, starting with an effect on my creativity. It has completely changed the way I produce content. Today, I write as soon as I find an interesting idea to exploit, whereas it used to take me several weeks to research and rework topics. Writing has become a very important tool to develop my ideas and share them. It has also opened the doors to several communities and inspired me to create one of my own. Beyond a newsletter with 20,000 subscribers, Maker Mind now connects more than [600 curious minds](https://nesslabs.com/membership), trying like me to understand how the human brain works. Writing is how all these encounters happened, and how I connected with people I never imagined I would have access to one day. Which brings me to my last point: the many professional opportunities and collaboration requests I have received around themes that I am passionate about.\n\n**I will come back later on to the community aspect of Maker Mind. Before that, I want to know more about the links you do between writing and creativity. Can you explain to me how this synergy between the two materialized for you?**\n\nWhen you have a certain number of articles a week to produce, you can’t count on a whimsical muse to inspire you on demand. So to avoid the blank page syndrome, I had to set up creative systems. The first version was simply to get into the habit of writing down on a mobile app any idea I might have during the day. It’s like planting a seed of creativity every time you hear or read something interesting. And it worked very well for me for several months. Only I felt like I didn’t go far enough after a while: I took each idea separately, so I was leaving a lot of creative opportunities on the table.\n\n**And that’s when you discovered Roam Research!**\n\nExactly. I discovered [Roam](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research) in January 2020 and immediately thought it was the perfect tool to take things to the next level. Beyond allowing you to list your ideas in a linear fashion like a classic note-taking application, Roam proactively helps you connect them together. This principle of generating new and original ideas from the combination of several ideas has a name: [idea sex](https://nesslabs.com/inspiration-to-idea-sex) (or “combinational creativity”). That’s when I realized that my previous creativity system didn’t work as well, and I switched all my notes to Roam.\n\n**I’ve always wanted to try Roam, but I think its apparent complexity intimidated me for a while. Can you explain to me how you use it on a daily basis?**\n\nI know that the concept of combinational creativity may seem intimidating at first sight, but there is really nothing complicated about my use of Roam. First of all, I still jot down all my ideas on the fly in my mobile app when I’m on the go. Then, I set aside some time each day to open Roam and create a page for each idea — which I will detail as much as I can so that I can remember them accurately over the long term. Then I’ll take time to think about the potential links between my new ideas and the ones I’ve already noted. One of Roam’s key features is the ability to create links between all your ideas — which its algorithm can also suggest to you. Not only does it push you to follow interesting thinking trails, but the tool will also lead you to uncover surprising connections you wouldn’t have thought of otherwise. Finally, I also use Roam for what is called [interstitial journaling](https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling). It consists of taking a moment to document your thoughts between tasks. For example, I’ll go to Roam after our conversation and write down everything that came to mind during the interview. It’s basically a continuous [brain dump](https://nesslabs.com/productive-cognitive-load). It allows me to not worry about forgetting random insights when it’s not the priority of the moment, and to be able to come back to these later. So I use Roam as both a tool for creativity and productivity. In fact, it’s by far the tool that has had the most significant impact on my life, both for my professional work and personal well-being.\n\n**Well, I really need to give it a try then (laughs). And so, you’ve written over two hundred articles and about fifty editions of your newsletter in the last year thanks to your creativity system. Then I was wondering how you go about choosing the order in which you’re going to write particular topics. Basically, do you have an editorial schedule defined beforehand that follows a certain logic?**\n\nAbsolutely not. My creative system encourages me to proactively take notes, write and connect ideas every day. Beyond that, I don’t try to control anything else. There’s really an experimental part to it, in the sense that I never know in advance what I’m going to write about — and therefore the order in which I’m going to tackle the ideas in my creativity inbox. Rigid schedules are not my thing. I like to keep the flexibility to let ideas emerge at any time and to be able to follow the trail whenever one of them piques my curiosity.\n\n**That reminds me of your recent publication on **[**the different types of note-taking applications**](https://nesslabs.com/how-to-choose-the-right-note-taking-app)** grouped into three types of approaches: those of the architect, the librarian and the gardener.**\n\nDefinitely. In this case, I have more of a gardener’s approach. There are two classic mistakes I’ve identified when talking to other people about these note-taking tools. The first one is to choose a system that doesn’t fit your creative style. If you have messy style, with ideas that come from all over the place, you don’t need to force yourself to adopt an architect’s approach. And all the more so because there is no system that is superior to another. There’s no problem with not being very orderly in your way of thinking, quite the contrary. In this situation, the gardener’s approach can help you make the most of your creative style. The second mistake is to think that you can’t deviate from the category you are in. Personally, I find myself to be more comfortable in a gardener’s system, but I also have affinities with the librarian’s approach. Depending on the situation, I’ll borrow from one or the other. Sometimes I even ask architects for advice to help me solve a problem that lends itself to it. So there’s nothing absolute: what is so great in this metaphorical classification is that it consists in knowing yourself better, so that you can build a system that is truly yours and can evolve with you.\n\n**I have this feeling that you truly live and experience what you write about. This is as true when you talk about the concepts and practices resulting from your creative system or when you openly share certain vulnerabilities. As if Maker Mind was a very intellectual approach to the diary exercise. So I was wondering: what was the biggest discovery you’ve made about yourself since you resumed writing?**\n\nFirst, you’re right about the experimental aspect of my work. That’s why I called my company Ness Labs: it’s my little lab and Maker Mind is my research diary. To come back to your question, I used to think I found my home in the tech world’s hustle and bustle. But in the past year, I realized that I really enjoyed the research and reflection process as well. I love working in a team, but I rediscovered the pleasure of being alone, digging into complex topics, and connecting ideas. When I was a child, my parents could leave me alone with my nose in the books all afternoon without me moving an inch. Writing somehow reconciled me with my inner bookworm (laughs).\n\n**That’s so nicely put (laughs)! We’ve covered the topics of creativity and productivity, and now I’d like to talk about what I consider the third pillar of Maker Mind: mental health. How has writing impacted this aspect in your life?**\n\nNote-taking and especially interstitial journaling allow me to identify warning signs of burnout. I experienced burnout in the past and the problem is that I could resist for a very long time without breaking down until it was too late. Today, I am able to act upstream by making decisions and adapting new strategies to prevent it from happening again.\n\n**I had just read **[**in your interview with Dan Shipper from Superorganizers**](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-anne-laure-le-cunff-wrote-200)** that burnout was a real starting point in the creation of Maker Mind. And I just wanted to ask you if you felt you had “cracked the code” of your personal balance or if you still felt at risk despite everything you put in place?**\n\nI don’t think it’s possible to “crack the code” like you say. On the other hand, I now have a much healthier relationship with my mental health. In particular, I have learned to accept that there are external stressors over which I have no control. Like many people, the lockdown has been a trying time for me. Even though I have found a system that works, I am no more able than anyone else to thrive without leaving my home for months. Twice this year, I announced to my readers that there would not be a weekly newsletter following difficult personal moments. Taking care of one’s mental health also means listening to oneself and knowing how to reconsider one’s priorities, with the guiding principle: “be kind to yourself”.\n\n**This year is also special in the sense that we have never talked about mental health as much as in 2020. Did the lockdown and all the news around Covid-19 influence your way of writing on the subject?**\n\nI have always talked about “mindful productivity” to put the emphasis on fulfillment rather than only focusing on goals and performance indicators. Among my readers, there are a lot of very ambitious, very passionate people who tend to work a lot. And indeed, this year’s context has made me insist in my articles on the idea that it’s more important than ever to accept that it’s not always possible to be productive, to also learn how to take the time to breathe and to reconcile with the idea of letting go.\n\n**During the confinement, you went further in this respect by creating a \\[paid] community around Maker Mind. What motivated you to go in that direction?**\n\nTo be very transparent with you, I started the community at a time when I was looking to generate recurring revenue with Ness Labs. It’s a healthy business model for the company, aligned with my values and the ones of my readers. It gives them the opportunity to meet each other, help each other, and move forward together in achieving their life goals. For my part, it allows me to focus on creating high value-added content and to get to know my community better.\n\n**Personally, I have the impression that building a community is more difficult to evaluate in terms of time invested than creating content. Since we were talking about burnout earlier, how do you make sure that it doesn’t become a time-consuming activity next to everything you already do with Maker Mind and Ness Labs?**\n\nTo tell the truth, I didn’t have to set any strict rules and there is nothing stressful about running this community. I’m fortunate to be surrounded by very emotionally intelligent members, some of whom have been following me for a while. I participate every week but I don’t have to force myself to do it. In fact, no one expects me to be available 24 hours a day to answer their questions. It’s a very calm community, not in the sense that nothing happens but because everyone respects each other’s time. I am very happy to see the members interact with each other without having to ask for my permission. For example, I think it’s great to see some members organizing working or writing sessions every day.\n\n**Paid communities are becoming more common for content creators to monetize their projects. Do you think it’s become a must to make a living from your writings?**\n\nThere are many counter-examples, with very high quality paid publications without a community component behind them. So I would say… not necessarily. Still, starting a community opens up many opportunities to better understand your audience and their needs. Personally, I’m very happy to have chosen to take Ness Labs in this direction. While I don’t see it as a prerequisite, I tend to encourage content creators to explore this path.\n\n**In addition to having a community to run and your fast pace of publishing, you also went back to school for a Master’s degree in Neuroscience. What was your initial goal and how did it evolve with the development of your activity?**\n\nWhen I started, I really saw the Master’s degree as a personal need. I wanted to study the inner workings of the human brain. In a way, writing about it helped me consolidate my learning. What I studied in class was often the starting point for reflections in my articles. What I didn’t expect was for this personal curiosity to quickly turn into a real business with Ness Labs.\n\n**I’ve learned that your longer-term vision for Ness Labs is actually a school.

Tens of billions in new capital were locked into smart contracts. The next generation of crypto-natives began scrambling towards participation and ownership within this new financial stack.  \n\nAs a result, two problems emerged:\n\n1. Protocols had more difficulty than ever finding and attracting the best on-chain users and participants;\n2. Users had a hard time understanding how best to apply their skills to the right protocols.\n\nRabbitHole solves this problem by becoming the premier on-chain platform for participant acquisition.\n\nSince our launch in December, we’ve worked with dozens of teams like Matcha, OpenSea, Gnosis, Aave, mStable, Perpetual Protocol, ENS and PoolTogether to help these protocols start spending treasury money on tailored community discovery. Here are some of our recent highlights:\n\n* 10,000+ addresses have completed a task on RabbitHole;\n* $100,000+ in rewards have been distributed by projects to users who completed tasks;\n* RabbitHole increased PoolTogether’s user base on Polygon by 300%\n\n### Today, RabbitHole helps projects increase participation and find contributors\n\nRabbitHole has created the infrastructure to help launch any token to find the right stewards for a network -- here’s how we do it:\n\n* A loyal user-base who is looking for new projects to use and contribute to.\n* The ability to track actions for any smart contract, powered by The Graph.\n* Distribute tokens and NFTs to users for completing on-chain tasks (Called “quests”).\n* Built-in sybil-resistance with the ability for protocols and users to filter by skills like *Lending*, A*sset Management*, *NFT Creator*, and more.\n* Full analytics and case study breakdowns of how RabbitHole users are contributing towards the protocol over time.\n\nCompared to less sophisticated customer acquisition campaigns -- like retroactive airdrops -- RabbitHole requires users to interact and engage on-chain with each protocol, satisfying pre-defined KPIs before token rewards are granted.\n\nIn addition, RabitHole’s fee for providing these services is paid in the form of a project’s token, which RabbitHole intends to use to become a key voice in governance, with a focus on increasing user participation over short-term price maximization.  \n\nLearn more about our [commitment to governance.](https://www.notion.so/RabbitHole-s-Pledge-to-Governance-ba241051b30d42999288aae9fee89137)\n\n### Tomorrow, your wallet will be your résumé -- powered by RabbitHole.  \n\nWe’re not stopping there. At RabbitHole, we also believe Web3’s core building blocks can be organized in a way to fundamentally reshape the future of work and talent organization. By curating an on-chain graph of a user’s prior achievements, RabbitHole can develop a system of verifiable credentials. \n\nIn the future, you might be classed as a Protocol Politician on RabbitHole, so long as you pass a proposal in a well-known protocol that requires a high quorum. Or maybe RabbitHole will identify you as an Advanced Asset Manager if you achieved a specific ROI/TVL threshold in an on-chain fund with Enzyme.\n\nProjects can then use these credentials on RabbitHole to locate the best future participants and contributors.\n\nWeb3’s future is one of interoperable reputation. Powered by RabbitHole, your wallet will be your résumé. \n\n### Become a Pathfinder and help build the future of work with RabbitHole.\n\nRabbitHole’s north star is to decentralize into a DAO -- with a mission to help networks grow on-chain users and contributors over the life of each project. To do so, we  will begin to progressively decentralize the process of creating quests. \n\nToday -- quests are broken down into four core parts: proposal creation, subgraph development, quest rewards, and content creation. Soon, RabbitHole will decentralize each core part of the quest lifecycle to four unique roles called “Pathfinders”. The four roles are as follows:\n\n1. “**Stewards**” - These are governance proposal writers rewarded for creating proposals on other protocols to bring in new RabbitHole quests.\n\n2. “**Navigators**” - These are developers rewarded for creating subgraphs on The Graph to track completions of different tasks on specific protocols RabbitHole works alongside.\n\n3. “**Craftsman**” - These are NFT creators rewarded for creating trophies that are distributed to users for completing specific quests.\n\n4. “**Pioneers**”- These are content creators rewarded for creating content specific to individual tasks, guiding users down the nebulous rabbit hole.\n\nThese roles are critical to the success of RabbitHole as it begins its transition into a decentralized platform. Importantly -- while we’re not ready to unveil the full details of the Pathfinder Program just yet, we’re starting to gather interest from those in the community who might be interested in becoming a Pathfinder, and contributing towards the future of work. \n\nIf you’re interested in becoming a Pathfinder, you can find more details and [apply here.](https://www.notion.so/Introducing-the-Pathfinder-Program-ca5a1fdd96cd49868c98a2163c75edc0)\n\n### New round of funding to bring more participation to crypto\n\nWe’re excited to bring on new partners to RabbitHole to help us accomplish our mission of bringing more participation to the crypto ecosystem. We welcome Electric Capital, ParaFi Capital, Framework Ventures, Edge & Node, Chapter One, and Late Checkout. We also welcome new angels including Balaji Srinivasan, Larry Sukernik, and MonetSupply. We’re also excited to have many of our original investors back with us again -- including Collab+Currency, Slow Ventures, and Tony Sheng.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nWe’re building toward a future of truly distributed, merit-based protocol work and ownership. \n\nWant to join the movement full-time?

Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7d3957a8-dae1-43c0-927c-a8f17a3c2510.png?height=601&width=725)\n\n\n\n**Nice to meet you Li, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! It’s a real honor to have you as a guest for my newsletter, which I started a little over a year ago, a few weeks before you gave life to the amazing concept of “passion economy”. To start, can you tell us more about the context in which you published your first article on the subject?**\n\nWorking in venture capital, I had the opportunity to meet many founders building marketplaces in a wide range of verticals. We were particularly interested in how entrepreneurs connect supply and demand in a given market. When I started in venture in 2016, the prevailing model was the “Uber for X,” approach applied to all types of services, whether in education, tourism, or health. The idea was to turn a given service into an on-demand convenience. The consequence of that design is a standardized offering, which commoditized suppliers thus drove prices down.\n\nAs a result, it was difficult for providers to build a career and have upside on these marketplaces. Many individuals stay on these platforms temporarily and don’t view it as a long-term career. And so, a big challenge for these companies is to retain the supply side. But during the last couple of years, I saw a shift where more entrepreneurs addressed markets with more complex or higher-stakes transactions. Their marketplaces served customers looking for more nuanced services and who valued the individuality of the suppliers. The key to the success of these start-ups was richness and diversity of service providers — which I thought was very empowering and aligned to a model of work that I believe will become more prevalent in the future.\n\n**Did you have a specific key moment that proved decisive in the development of your thesis?**\n\nOne of the “aha” moments was a meeting with Amir Nathoo, cofounder and CEO of [Outschool](https://outschool.com/). Outschool is an educational platform that allows teachers to offer live online group classes to kids in K-12. A key element of the platform is that teachers have total freedom in the development of their curriculum, and so you can find a huge range of creative courses, like a class about seasons taught through *Frozen *characters.\n\nWhat stuck with me was that the founder mentioned that Outschool was one of the only ways for their suppliers to earn income flexibility by leveraging their creativity and education. I found it really interesting that the marketplace not only prioritized the needs of the demand side, but also delivered a unique value proposition to the supply side. It was from this meeting that I began to think about the foundations of what became the passion economy and ways to monetize non-commoditized skills.\n\n**Why did you choose the word “passion*”* to illustrate this new economy?**\n\nI chose the term “passion economy” very specifically: passion comes from the latin word “pati,” which means “to suffer”. This is apt because people often confuse passion with happiness — in contrast, I don’t believe being a successful passion economy entrepreneur means being happy all the time. Creators that I’ve spoken to don’t enjoy every moment of what they do; there is a degree of suffering and sacrifice. Passion means continuous effort and work, but feeling that the painful moments are worthwhile because there is a deep-seated sense of fulfillment. I think this is a notion that inspires us and something that we all want in our lives.\n\n**Somehow the passion economy borrows a lot of ideas from the art world, **[**which you seem to be familiar with**](https://li-jin.co/art/)**. Has art influenced your thesis?**\n\nVery likely! What we typically think of as creative industries — art, writing, music — are full of people who are passionate about their work. And in the art world in particular, many people are putting their passion for their craft over financial compensation.\n\nThe biggest commonality is the expression of a person’s imagination and creativity. There is something unique and individual in the products and services you find in the passion economy, whether it’s a video course, a podcast, a newsletter, or other services. Just as a work of art reveals the personality of its creator, these passion economy creations reflect the personality of the people that made them. This is in direct contrast to the “Uber for X” approach, which treats providers as a fungible commodity.\n\n**In your writing on the passion economy, you focus on the supply-side. But I tend to think that passion is equally important to consider on the demand-side. Can we then consider passion as a kind of currency at the center of this new economy?**\n\nEvery successful consumer company has to provide something of value to the consumers at the end of the day — it needs to be an improvement over something that already exists on some dimension. For creator-led offerings, that could be lower cost (because of a different cost structure), greater trust with their consumers, or something else. I wrote about this in a blog post about the links between the passion economy and [disruption theory](https://li.substack.com/p/how-the-passion-economy-will-disrupt). Passion economy models will be most successful in domains where there is an unmet or over-served consumer need.\n\n**I think this is in line with the concept of **[**aspiration economy**](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/veblen-is-wrong-the-new-aspiration-economy-765c3d5456d)** coined by Ana Andjelic, which I find very complementary to your analysis. You’ve also explored how the passion economy enables us to shift to a society in which **[**work is being unbundled from employment**](https://www.atelierventures.co/content/unbundling-work-from-employment)**. What effects do you think we can expect on the identity of individuals?**\n\nWork is still one of the most influential identity markers in our lives. For instance, in tech, there are certain values that are conveyed from the company that employs us; when someone says they work at Google, Facebook, Airbnb, or another company, a certain image comes to mind.\n\nWith the passion economy and the unbundling of work from employment, I imagine a return to a more pre-industrial notion of identity, namely one in which we derive our sense of identity more from what we create, who our customers are, and who our loose association of peers and collaborators are, rather than from a single employer.\n\n**These are ideas that can be found in the software craftsmanship movement too. I have the feeling that the passion economy will keep blurring the lines between the personal and the professional, between private life and public image. What are the main potential risks on the mental health of creators, according to you?**\n\nI think that the personal and professional identities of creators will increasingly merge. This is both a source of fulfillment — that one’s life is one’s work and feels meaningful and is what we choose to do with our time — but it also comes with risks. I recently watched an interview with David Dobrik, where he mentioned that he constantly obsesses over what he’s going to film for his next video on YouTube. As soon as he posts a new video, he is already consumed with thinking about the next one. The prospect of not filming anything interesting is a huge source of anxiety for him. I don’t think this lifestyle is suited for everyone — some people want more balance and separation in their lives.\n\n**If the passion economy becomes a disruptive innovation in Christensen’s sense, then it will have a societal impact that goes far beyond creators. What are the conditions for the passion economy to remain accessible to all and not just become a new “winner-takes-all” system?**\n\nThe key for it to not be “winner-take-all” is that there needs to be heterogeneity in consumer preferences. For example, a newsletter considered by some people as “the best” on a given subject may not suit the expectations and tastes of other readers. If there’s heterogeneous consumer preferences, that implies a long tail of successful creators, with many products/services that are popular among a large number of audience segments.\n\nI would add that an independent creator only needs a relatively small number of customers to make a living. This is the point of my [“100 true fans”](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/) blog, inspired by Kevin Kelly’s concept of [1,000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/): one can be successful with a smaller base of fans, because the internet removes intermediaries and connects creators directly to fans.\n\nFor me, this is the potential of the passion economy I am most excited about: one in which millions of people can participate and earn a living, not just a rarified tier of internet celebrities.\n\n**The first blog post in which you coined the term “passion economy” was a huge success and established you as a thought leader in this new ecosystem. Since then, I imagine that your articles are much more anticipated. Would you say that this has had an impact on your writing?**\n\nI’ve always had a really high bar for my writing. I want to make sure that my writing is worthy of my readers’ interest and attention. Time is our most valuable resource, and every minute spent reading my writing comes at the expense of something else. I always ask myself if what I write offers new insights that will be useful for founders, and am always trying to push forward into something new, interesting, and surprising.\n\n**For me, writing is without a doubt one of the most powerful vectors of serendipity on a lifetime scale. For your part, what were the most memorable events that happened to you following the article you wrote one year ago?**\n\nThe article definitely catalyzed a few interesting things. It led me to meet Adam Davidson, who is a journalist, author, and podcaster (he cofounded NPR’s Planet Money). Earlier this year, he published a book called [*The Passion Economy: the New Rules for Thriving in the Twenty-First Century*](https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Economy-Thriving-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0385353529), which is a more human-centered account of how various individuals are thriving in their careers by leveraging their passions. We’ve become close collaborators. And, in a way, I also jumped into the passion economy myself by founding [Atelier](https://www.atelierventures.co/). I also become more active in creating content: I’m part of the [Everything](https://everything.substack.com/) bundle, and co-host a weekly talk show called [Means of Creation](https://meansofcreation.substack.com/). I’ve also been writing more [in my personal newsletter](https://li.substack.com/) and take more time to paint and create art!\n\n**You actually fit perfectly the definition of a multi-potential person, with highly developed passions that occupy an important place in your life. How do you balance all your various passions with your life and career choices?**\n\nWhen I was a child, my mother told me that time is like a sponge — you can always squeeze more out for what you want to prioritize. That has guided me a lot in my choices. People often ask me how I can have time for all of my projects. I just prioritize and focus my time on what gives me energy rather than what drains it.\n\n**I’ve actually read **[**this advice**](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1131207138418630657)** from Justin Kan in the past and I couldn’t agree more. That being said, I know people who don’t have a real passion in their lives or who don’t even find meaning in what they do. What would you personally recommend them to do in this situation?**\n\nI don’t think that we are born with a certain passion. I believe passion is mostly the result of your education, experiences, and the time you’ve invested in developing various interests. I wouldn’t be as passionate about art had I not studied painting from age 5–18. Even my interest in the passion economy and the future of work is very much influenced by my personal experience as an immigrant, moving from China to the US when I was 6 years old and watching my parents pursue the American Dream. I don’t see a miracle recipe for finding one’s passion other than searching for it — that could be delving into one’s personal history, cultivating your curiosity, or exploring new interests.\n\n**I can’t think of a better way to end this wonderful interview. It was a great pleasure to be able to ask you all these questions about your fascinating journey.

Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1446/1\\*I4a6OzoG6vGyA-\\_-E3BJQg.png)\n\nMax Nussenbaum created the On Deck Writer Fellowship from scratch\n\n**Nice to meet you Max, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! Let’s start with your background: you’ve been alternatively a startup operator, a founder and a freelancer in product, design and software engineering. You’ve also been the coauthor of a business book, **[***Oversubscribed***](https://oversubscribed.club/)**. So I was wondering: why writing? And how did it come to your life among so many interests?**\n\nI’ve been interested in writing for as long as I can remember, even before I have conscious memories. I still have stories I wrote when I was in second grade. Then I went to school for writing and I was a creative writing major. I also wrote a musical in college, and later a book of short stories. So I really thought I was going to be a writer.\n\nBut when I graduated, I realized that becoming a full-time writer didn’t necessarily look the way I’d have imagined. The fact is, I didn’t want to work alone and I wanted my job to be as collaborative as possible. So I ended up making a really sort of unexpected jump into startups. I worked in the tech industry and I started a real estate company that had a classic Silicon Valley rise and fall. But writing was still a big part of my life, mainly through side projects.\n\nI also found that a lot of the skills I was drawing on as a founder were, in some way or another, related to writing. A lot of what I was doing was telling stories, whether it was telling our customers the story of our product, selling our vision to investors or crafting the story of our company. Eventually, I was offered the opportunity to join On Deck and build out the Writer Fellowship last year.\n\n**Such a dream job for you! How did this opportunity happen?**\n\nThis actually ties to my practice of writing. I’ve been friends with [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg), the founder of On Deck, for almost a decade. We both started our careers in Detroit and we bonded over writing. We did a little bit of a writing group together and we both attended a book club that was infamous for only lasting one meeting (laughs). We stayed friends over the years and kept in touch through writing online. When he was thinking about launching the Writer Fellowship, he asked if I wanted to be involved and I eventually said yes.\n\nThis perfectly illustrates one of the reasons why I think that ambitious people should write online. Thanks to my writing, Erik was still able to sort of follow my journey from afar. And when he reached out to me, it wasn’t like we had to spend hours catching up on all the stuff that had happened.\n\n**I agree with you: writing creates a special bond with your readers, which can definitely bring serendipity into your life. And I have the feeling that this is exactly what On Deck is about. So let’s talk about it further! I tend to consider On Deck as an elite program since the endgame is to train the next generation of world-class talents in areas like entrepreneurship, angel investing, content creation, along with healthcare and climate. However, you seem committed to the idea of making your programs accessible to all, as initiatives like your **[**Access Fund**](https://www.beondeck.com/post/access-fund)** show it. But beyond that, how do you balance selectivity and diversity?**\n\nWe have two missions that could seem contradictory at first. One is broadening access and believing that talent can come from anywhere. And as you mentioned, the second is to build a community of world-class talent.\n\nSo the first layer of what we’re doing to expand access is to create a global remote-first community — what some people call the “Silicon Valley in the cloud”. Our goal is to move away from the days when you needed to be living in a specific place to be part of a certain community.\n\nThe second angle is about the journey at On Deck. Every program may be competitive, some are definitely harder to get into than others. For instance, the Founder Fellowship is one of the most difficult to get into. But there’s more than one path to join On Deck. Suppose you might want to start a company someday but don’t necessarily have an idea yet. Well, the Writer or Podcaster Fellowships are more accessible programs that will help you start honing and developing your ideas in the public sphere. And since you’ll be an On Deck Fellow for the rest of your life, it’ll likely be easier to join the Founder Fellowship when you’re ready. If your company takes off, you’ll then have the opportunity to send your employees into other programs such as the First 50 or the Chief of Staff Fellowships.\n\nWhen selecting our future fellows among applicants, we’re asking ourselves two things. First, can we help this person succeed according to their own goals? Second, would this person be a great community member according to our [guiding values](https://www.beondeck.com/guiding-values)? Beyond the programs, On Deck is about giving back, whether it’s with time, knowledge or support. This is why community is a core part of what we’re building.\n\n**I love this “choose your own adventure” approach between the different programs! Can you tell me more about how the different Fellowships communicate with each other?**\n\nWe’re very intentional about making sure that every fellowship has a connection to the others so that they overall make the whole network stronger. Our vision has always been about enabling entrepreneurship. And we view entrepreneurship as something that’s defined much more broadly than this very narrow slice of Silicon Valley that too many people often focus on.\n\nWe tend to forget that writers and podcasters do build products, connect with an audience and create communities. They’re entrepreneurs too! Having a successful writing practice actually involves a lot of skills other than just putting words together. Beyond writing, you need to understand the basics of growth, branding and distribution for instance. And I think it’s much more stimulating to learn all these things within a community of peers than on your own. This is a big part of the thesis behind the Writer Fellowship.\n\nAlso, we are building *one* global community, not just siloed fellowships. And so we do a number of things to enable the fellows from different programs to interact. In February, we’ll have our first ever Global Build Weekend. The goal is to make people from different fellowships collaborate on teams. For instance, I’m looking forward to seeing the next cohort of writers learn the fundamentals of visual branding from the design fellows. In return, they will have the opportunity to teach them some storytelling and copywriting techniques.\n\n**I assume that a program such as the Writer Fellowship must be very tied to your own personality. How did you bring it to the curriculum?**\n\nThat’s a great question! The Writer Fellowship was basically the first program launched after the Founder Fellowship. So I’ve helped a lot of the other program directors who have been launching new fellowships after me.\n\nOne of the things I’d really emphasize is that your program just inevitably takes on your own personality. When your product is an interactive experience within a community, there’s such a direct emotional connection between you and the “customers”. As program directors, we are lucky to have a lot of freedom to shape our curriculum as we wish. And my personal belief is that it’s all about the small things, from the music I choose when introducing a speaker to the dumb jokes I make in my presentations.\n\nOur approach is very bottom-up and not “one size fits all”. It’s not a ten-step writing course where everyone has to do the exact same things in the exact same order. You don’t have to write a specific essay during the program or anything like that. We aim at independent and entrepreneurial people who already have specific goals and ambitions. And we want to be in a position where we have a broad curriculum that can support all of that.\n\n**Plus, having a “one size fits all” program would result in growing an army of clones writing about the same things with the same style. Can you tell me more about how you ensure to adapt to each person’s personality and authenticity?**\n\nThe truth is, a big part of the program is about psychology. Like most creators, our fellows face common issues such as procrastination, lack of motivation, imposter syndrome or being scared to show their work publicly. Some of them don’t really need to be taught how to write as they are already great at this, even though there’s always room for improvement. Their most urgent need is support, so that they can get over their fears and have the courage to write about that topic that scares them.\n\nI like to draw the comparison with the Founder Fellowship, as it’s very uncommon for an entrepreneur to start a company and then the startup fails because they just procrastinate and don’t get any work done. But that’s comparatively a very common failure mode among creators, even for experienced writers. A huge part of what we’re doing at On Deck is to create a comfortable environment for people to do what they’re good at.\n\nWe also want the program to be a really exploratory space. The fact that we’re not pushing everyone towards one defined outcome is actually a great opportunity to explore. I love nothing more than seeing someone who comes into the program to develop their blog, let’s say about the great economic competition between the US and China, and eventually decides to start an essay about their experience raising a family after seeing some other fellows writing very personal stuff. It doesn’t mean they’re going to stop writing about economics, but it’s a way to be able to stretch their wings and kind of get their creative juices going.\n\n**At the moment, the curriculum is mainly designed for people who are building an audience. But I guess that you could extend it to a lot of areas such as publishing, screenwriting, journalism, or even music. How would you personally want to see the Writer Fellowship evolve?**\n\nIt’s definitely something that we think about. The good news is that we’ve attracted people working on several of these areas among our fellows. It’s very likely that within a year or two we’ll have dedicated programs for some of these topics.\n\nThe only thing is that we want to create programs that can legitimately help a lot of people succeed. I’ll take an example from my background as an aspiring fiction writer to illustrate what we wouldn’t do. So I’ve taken a lot of writing workshops in my life. Last summer, I was attending one in New York. Everyone in this workshop was trying to become a novelist. But when I looked around, I couldn’t help but think that no one here was ever going to be a published author. I’m not making any judgments but I’ve had the feeling that what these workshops are really selling is the opportunity to believe in the dream for a few hours a week.\n\nSo, would we ever start an On Deck fellowship to help people try to get a publishing deal? Well, almost certainly not since publishing is kind of a dying industry. Actually, one of the best ways to get published these days is to grow an audience and then leverage that into a book deal. But having a program focused on succeeding in traditional publishing would be like selling a pipe dream that the vast majority of people couldn’t achieve. It would be unethical taking people’s money knowing that the vast majority of them are never going to get there.\n\nOne interesting fact about our fellows is that they haven’t joined On Deck because they think that we’ll help them build a paid publication that will provide them 100% of their income. Rather, they see the fellowship as an opportunity to explore, to supercharge their career by writing about the topics they’re interested in, to connect with a broader network to boost their personal brand, and sometimes to make some money on the side. But those are all very achievable goals we can help them with.\n\n**That’s a very honest approach. I was simply curious about this possible evolution when I’ve noticed that you have someone in the first cohort who writes poetry.**\n\nYou’re referencing [Alysia Harris](http://alysiaharris.com/), a fellow who’s an award-winning poet and an incredible artist. She helped us learn a fantastic lesson during the first cohort. The vast majority of people in the program are primarily writing nonfiction. Yet we had several creative workshops, one or two about poetry, and what we actually realized was that even if you’re primarily writing nonfiction, you can get a ton of value out of doing a poetry workshop. You’re probably not going to just start being a poet. But they can be a great way to think more creatively and kind of get out of your rut. And the responses we got to these creative workshops have been very enthusiastic!\n\n**You’re preaching to the converted (laughs). I’m personally convinced that diversifying what you read and write on is key to find and sharpen your own style. Your ideas made me think of **[**another interview I had with Li Jin**](https://medium.com/@Benjamin_Prune/pioneering-the-passion-economy-a79fcbafc00f)** last October. **[**Her thesis**](https://www.atelierventures.co/thesis)** on the passion economy is essential to figure out what’s to come for creators. So I was wondering: how do you envision the future of writing?**\n\nI think we’re at a really interesting inflection point for writing. While many of the traditional industries and mediums are suffering, people read and write today more than ever before. This is really exciting, with both a lot of opportunity and peril.\n\nFirst, I think that people are too often too quick to view writing or other forms of creation with a binary viewpoint: either they’re trying to make it a full-time job or it’ll just be a hobby. But there’s a lot of space in between. For instance, I know someone who works in grocery logistics and writes a blog about the industry, which helped him get better career opportunities that he couldn’t have had otherwise.\n\nAlso, I’m a huge believer in Li’s approach of the passion economy. But like most things on the Internet, I think it’s going to end up forming a power law distribution. Substack is a great opportunity for independent writers, yet most people are never going to be able to support themselves entirely through a paid publication. I believe that many writers will follow the trajectory a lot of musicians have taken. The latter have started to think of themselves as products and monetized features like live touring, merchandising, private events, crowdfunding, etc. What I’d advise writers is to take a holistic view and figure out how they can bundle or unbundle what they have to offer. So the question is not about whether going full-time but about having multiple sources of income.\n\nIn some ways, that can be a depressing vision when you think that there was a much larger group of people making a living as full-time writers in 1960 than there is now. But let’s not forget that these people were pretty much all white men who came from elite universities.\n\n**And this is a very important point. But the new platforms have yet to prove that they can reverse this situation. To end up on a more personal touch: what are your writing projects right now?**\n\nI write a weekly email newsletter called [My Super Secret Diary](http://mysupersecretdiary.com/). I present it as a publication about “startups, literature, philosophy, American history, sex & drugs, and how to be alive,” but it’s really just about whatever I feel like writing about. It keeps me practicing and sharing my thoughts with what I like to call my “minimum viable audience”. I’m positive that it won’t be my only writing project for long, but for now running the On Deck Writer Fellowship is a pretty busy dream job (laughs).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*efXaixTZEeM7BIhHS5Y7eQ.gif)\n\n## **5 resources on writing curated by Max:**\n\n*   [**George Orwell’s Six Rules for Writing:**](https://infusion.media/blog/george-orwells-six-rules-for-writing/) “Classic tips from a master from his essay *Politics and the English Language*”.\n*   [**What I Did Not Learn About Writing in School, by Eugene Wan:**](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-did-not-learn-about-writing-in-school/) “A bunch of excellent tips, including some great advice on figuring out what to write about — *you don’t find your niche; your niche finds you*.”\n*   [***On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft*, by Stephen King:**](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816) “I’m not even really much of a Stephen King fan, but this is one of the best books about writing ever written.”\n*   [**Five Short Stories by Lydia Davis:**](https://fivedials.com/fiction/five-short-stories/) “These are works of (very) short fiction, not articles “about” writing, but Lydia Davis is a master of the craft and you’ll learn a ton about what’s possible from reading her.”\n*   [**Julian Shapiro’s Writing Handbook**](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro)**:** “It’s amazing that one person can write so many useful guides about so many different topics, but somehow Julian Shapiro’s done it.”\n", "timestamp": 1624552632, "digest": "9GZm-IGk-oL_OmxsLHl_fEApuZd3a5NkaITLS7jJ3ck", "contributor": "0xb18501548Eeb4660c2348A75515e2740041999F6"}

You’ve also been the coauthor of a business book, **[***Oversubscribed***](https://oversubscribed.club/)**. So I was wondering: why writing? And how did it come to your life among so many interests?**\n\nI’ve been interested in writing for as long as I can remember, even before I have conscious memories. I still have stories I wrote when I was in second grade. Then I went to school for writing and I was a creative writing major. I also wrote a musical in college, and later a book of short stories. So I really thought I was going to be a writer.\n\nBut when I graduated, I realized that becoming a full-time writer didn’t necessarily look the way I’d have imagined. The fact is, I didn’t want to work alone and I wanted my job to be as collaborative as possible. So I ended up making a really sort of unexpected jump into startups. I worked in the tech industry and I started a real estate company that had a classic Silicon Valley rise and fall. But writing was still a big part of my life, mainly through side projects.\n\nI also found that a lot of the skills I was drawing on as a founder were, in some way or another, related to writing. A lot of what I was doing was telling stories, whether it was telling our customers the story of our product, selling our vision to investors or crafting the story of our company. Eventually, I was offered the opportunity to join On Deck and build out the Writer Fellowship last year.\n\n**Such a dream job for you! How did this opportunity happen?**\n\nThis actually ties to my practice of writing. I’ve been friends with [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg), the founder of On Deck, for almost a decade. We both started our careers in Detroit and we bonded over writing. We did a little bit of a writing group together and we both attended a book club that was infamous for only lasting one meeting (laughs). We stayed friends over the years and kept in touch through writing online. When he was thinking about launching the Writer Fellowship, he asked if I wanted to be involved and I eventually said yes.\n\nThis perfectly illustrates one of the reasons why I think that ambitious people should write online. Thanks to my writing, Erik was still able to sort of follow my journey from afar. And when he reached out to me, it wasn’t like we had to spend hours catching up on all the stuff that had happened.\n\n**I agree with you: writing creates a special bond with your readers, which can definitely bring serendipity into your life. And I have the feeling that this is exactly what On Deck is about. So let’s talk about it further! I tend to consider On Deck as an elite program since the endgame is to train the next generation of world-class talents in areas like entrepreneurship, angel investing, content creation, along with healthcare and climate. However, you seem committed to the idea of making your programs accessible to all, as initiatives like your **[**Access Fund**](https://www.beondeck.com/post/access-fund)** show it. But beyond that, how do you balance selectivity and diversity?**\n\nWe have two missions that could seem contradictory at first. One is broadening access and believing that talent can come from anywhere. And as you mentioned, the second is to build a community of world-class talent.\n\nSo the first layer of what we’re doing to expand access is to create a global remote-first community — what some people call the “Silicon Valley in the cloud”. Our goal is to move away from the days when you needed to be living in a specific place to be part of a certain community.\n\nThe second angle is about the journey at On Deck. Every program may be competitive, some are definitely harder to get into than others. For instance, the Founder Fellowship is one of the most difficult to get into. But there’s more than one path to join On Deck. Suppose you might want to start a company someday but don’t necessarily have an idea yet. Well, the Writer or Podcaster Fellowships are more accessible programs that will help you start honing and developing your ideas in the public sphere. And since you’ll be an On Deck Fellow for the rest of your life, it’ll likely be easier to join the Founder Fellowship when you’re ready. If your company takes off, you’ll then have the opportunity to send your employees into other programs such as the First 50 or the Chief of Staff Fellowships.\n\nWhen selecting our future fellows among applicants, we’re asking ourselves two things. First, can we help this person succeed according to their own goals? Second, would this person be a great community member according to our [guiding values](https://www.beondeck.com/guiding-values)? Beyond the programs, On Deck is about giving back, whether it’s with time, knowledge or support. This is why community is a core part of what we’re building.\n\n**I love this “choose your own adventure” approach between the different programs! Can you tell me more about how the different Fellowships communicate with each other?**\n\nWe’re very intentional about making sure that every fellowship has a connection to the others so that they overall make the whole network stronger. Our vision has always been about enabling entrepreneurship. And we view entrepreneurship as something that’s defined much more broadly than this very narrow slice of Silicon Valley that too many people often focus on.\n\nWe tend to forget that writers and podcasters do build products, connect with an audience and create communities. They’re entrepreneurs too! Having a successful writing practice actually involves a lot of skills other than just putting words together. Beyond writing, you need to understand the basics of growth, branding and distribution for instance. And I think it’s much more stimulating to learn all these things within a community of peers than on your own. This is a big part of the thesis behind the Writer Fellowship.\n\nAlso, we are building *one* global community, not just siloed fellowships. And so we do a number of things to enable the fellows from different programs to interact. In February, we’ll have our first ever Global Build Weekend. The goal is to make people from different fellowships collaborate on teams. For instance, I’m looking forward to seeing the next cohort of writers learn the fundamentals of visual branding from the design fellows. In return, they will have the opportunity to teach them some storytelling and copywriting techniques.\n\n**I assume that a program such as the Writer Fellowship must be very tied to your own personality. How did you bring it to the curriculum?**\n\nThat’s a great question! The Writer Fellowship was basically the first program launched after the Founder Fellowship. So I’ve helped a lot of the other program directors who have been launching new fellowships after me.\n\nOne of the things I’d really emphasize is that your program just inevitably takes on your own personality. When your product is an interactive experience within a community, there’s such a direct emotional connection between you and the “customers”. As program directors, we are lucky to have a lot of freedom to shape our curriculum as we wish. And my personal belief is that it’s all about the small things, from the music I choose when introducing a speaker to the dumb jokes I make in my presentations.\n\nOur approach is very bottom-up and not “one size fits all”. It’s not a ten-step writing course where everyone has to do the exact same things in the exact same order. You don’t have to write a specific essay during the program or anything like that. We aim at independent and entrepreneurial people who already have specific goals and ambitions. And we want to be in a position where we have a broad curriculum that can support all of that.\n\n**Plus, having a “one size fits all” program would result in growing an army of clones writing about the same things with the same style. Can you tell me more about how you ensure to adapt to each person’s personality and authenticity?**\n\nThe truth is, a big part of the program is about psychology. Like most creators, our fellows face common issues such as procrastination, lack of motivation, imposter syndrome or being scared to show their work publicly. Some of them don’t really need to be taught how to write as they are already great at this, even though there’s always room for improvement. Their most urgent need is support, so that they can get over their fears and have the courage to write about that topic that scares them.\n\nI like to draw the comparison with the Founder Fellowship, as it’s very uncommon for an entrepreneur to start a company and then the startup fails because they just procrastinate and don’t get any work done. But that’s comparatively a very common failure mode among creators, even for experienced writers. A huge part of what we’re doing at On Deck is to create a comfortable environment for people to do what they’re good at.\n\nWe also want the program to be a really exploratory space. The fact that we’re not pushing everyone towards one defined outcome is actually a great opportunity to explore. I love nothing more than seeing someone who comes into the program to develop their blog, let’s say about the great economic competition between the US and China, and eventually decides to start an essay about their experience raising a family after seeing some other fellows writing very personal stuff. It doesn’t mean they’re going to stop writing about economics, but it’s a way to be able to stretch their wings and kind of get their creative juices going.\n\n**At the moment, the curriculum is mainly designed for people who are building an audience. But I guess that you could extend it to a lot of areas such as publishing, screenwriting, journalism, or even music. How would you personally want to see the Writer Fellowship evolve?**\n\nIt’s definitely something that we think about. The good news is that we’ve attracted people working on several of these areas among our fellows. It’s very likely that within a year or two we’ll have dedicated programs for some of these topics.\n\nThe only thing is that we want to create programs that can legitimately help a lot of people succeed. I’ll take an example from my background as an aspiring fiction writer to illustrate what we wouldn’t do. So I’ve taken a lot of writing workshops in my life. Last summer, I was attending one in New York. Everyone in this workshop was trying to become a novelist. But when I looked around, I couldn’t help but think that no one here was ever going to be a published author. I’m not making any judgments but I’ve had the feeling that what these workshops are really selling is the opportunity to believe in the dream for a few hours a week.\n\nSo, would we ever start an On Deck fellowship to help people try to get a publishing deal? Well, almost certainly not since publishing is kind of a dying industry. Actually, one of the best ways to get published these days is to grow an audience and then leverage that into a book deal. But having a program focused on succeeding in traditional publishing would be like selling a pipe dream that the vast majority of people couldn’t achieve. It would be unethical taking people’s money knowing that the vast majority of them are never going to get there.\n\nOne interesting fact about our fellows is that they haven’t joined On Deck because they think that we’ll help them build a paid publication that will provide them 100% of their income. Rather, they see the fellowship as an opportunity to explore, to supercharge their career by writing about the topics they’re interested in, to connect with a broader network to boost their personal brand, and sometimes to make some money on the side. But those are all very achievable goals we can help them with.\n\n**That’s a very honest approach. I was simply curious about this possible evolution when I’ve noticed that you have someone in the first cohort who writes poetry.**\n\nYou’re referencing [Alysia Harris](http://alysiaharris.com/), a fellow who’s an award-winning poet and an incredible artist. She helped us learn a fantastic lesson during the first cohort. The vast majority of people in the program are primarily writing nonfiction. Yet we had several creative workshops, one or two about poetry, and what we actually realized was that even if you’re primarily writing nonfiction, you can get a ton of value out of doing a poetry workshop. You’re probably not going to just start being a poet. But they can be a great way to think more creatively and kind of get out of your rut. And the responses we got to these creative workshops have been very enthusiastic!\n\n**You’re preaching to the converted (laughs). I’m personally convinced that diversifying what you read and write on is key to find and sharpen your own style. Your ideas made me think of **[**another interview I had with Li Jin**](https://medium.com/@Benjamin_Prune/pioneering-the-passion-economy-a79fcbafc00f)** last October. **[**Her thesis**](https://www.atelierventures.co/thesis)** on the passion economy is essential to figure out what’s to come for creators. So I was wondering: how do you envision the future of writing?**\n\nI think we’re at a really interesting inflection point for writing. While many of the traditional industries and mediums are suffering, people read and write today more than ever before. This is really exciting, with both a lot of opportunity and peril.\n\nFirst, I think that people are too often too quick to view writing or other forms of creation with a binary viewpoint: either they’re trying to make it a full-time job or it’ll just be a hobby. But there’s a lot of space in between. For instance, I know someone who works in grocery logistics and writes a blog about the industry, which helped him get better career opportunities that he couldn’t have had otherwise.\n\nAlso, I’m a huge believer in Li’s approach of the passion economy. But like most things on the Internet, I think it’s going to end up forming a power law distribution. Substack is a great opportunity for independent writers, yet most people are never going to be able to support themselves entirely through a paid publication. I believe that many writers will follow the trajectory a lot of musicians have taken. The latter have started to think of themselves as products and monetized features like live touring, merchandising, private events, crowdfunding, etc. What I’d advise writers is to take a holistic view and figure out how they can bundle or unbundle what they have to offer. So the question is not about whether going full-time but about having multiple sources of income.\n\nIn some ways, that can be a depressing vision when you think that there was a much larger group of people making a living as full-time writers in 1960 than there is now. But let’s not forget that these people were pretty much all white men who came from elite universities.\n\n**And this is a very important point. But the new platforms have yet to prove that they can reverse this situation. To end up on a more personal touch: what are your writing projects right now?**\n\nI write a weekly email newsletter called [My Super Secret Diary](http://mysupersecretdiary.com/). I present it as a publication about “startups, literature, philosophy, American history, sex & drugs, and how to be alive,” but it’s really just about whatever I feel like writing about. It keeps me practicing and sharing my thoughts with what I like to call my “minimum viable audience”. I’m positive that it won’t be my only writing project for long, but for now running the On Deck Writer Fellowship is a pretty busy dream job (laughs).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*efXaixTZEeM7BIhHS5Y7eQ.gif)\n\n## **5 resources on writing curated by Max:**\n\n*   [**George Orwell’s Six Rules for Writing:**](https://infusion.media/blog/george-orwells-six-rules-for-writing/) “Classic tips from a master from his essay *Politics and the English Language*”.\n*   [**What I Did Not Learn About Writing in School, by Eugene Wan:**](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-did-not-learn-about-writing-in-school/) “A bunch of excellent tips, including some great advice on figuring out what to write about — *you don’t find your niche; your niche finds you*.”\n*   [***On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft*, by Stephen King:**](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816) “I’m not even really much of a Stephen King fan, but this is one of the best books about writing ever written.”\n*   [**Five Short Stories by Lydia Davis:**](https://fivedials.com/fiction/five-short-stories/) “These are works of (very) short fiction, not articles “about” writing, but Lydia Davis is a master of the craft and you’ll learn a ton about what’s possible from reading her.”\n*   [**Julian Shapiro’s Writing Handbook**](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro)**:** “It’s amazing that one person can write so many useful guides about so many different topics, but somehow Julian Shapiro’s done it.”\n", "timestamp": 1624552488, "digest": "9GZm-IGk-oL_OmxsLHl_fEApuZd3a5NkaITLS7jJ3ck", "contributor": "0xb18501548Eeb4660c2348A75515e2740041999F6"}

The good news is that you’re all invited to learn more about her journey.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1424/1\\*GcqUIPoP0gA4CBxoq6T25Q.png)\n\n**Hi Anne-Laure and thank you for agreeing to come back for the first anniversary of the newsletter. A year ago, you chose to put writing back at the center of your life, between the creation of your **[**Maker Mind newsletter**](https://nesslabs.com/newsletter)** and almost daily publications for your company blog Ness Labs. So to start, can you tell me more about the benefits this new habit has brought to your life?**\n\nWhen I started in July 2019, I published one article a day during the workweek — taking the weekend off to rest. Since November 2019, when I reached my goal of [100 articles in 100 days](https://nesslabs.com/100-articles-100-days), I have been writing three articles and one newsletter per week. I have seen changes on three levels, starting with an effect on my creativity. It has completely changed the way I produce content. Today, I write as soon as I find an interesting idea to exploit, whereas it used to take me several weeks to research and rework topics. Writing has become a very important tool to develop my ideas and share them. It has also opened the doors to several communities and inspired me to create one of my own. Beyond a newsletter with 20,000 subscribers, Maker Mind now connects more than [600 curious minds](https://nesslabs.com/membership), trying like me to understand how the human brain works. Writing is how all these encounters happened, and how I connected with people I never imagined I would have access to one day. Which brings me to my last point: the many professional opportunities and collaboration requests I have received around themes that I am passionate about.\n\n**I will come back later on to the community aspect of Maker Mind. Before that, I want to know more about the links you do between writing and creativity. Can you explain to me how this synergy between the two materialized for you?**\n\nWhen you have a certain number of articles a week to produce, you can’t count on a whimsical muse to inspire you on demand. So to avoid the blank page syndrome, I had to set up creative systems. The first version was simply to get into the habit of writing down on a mobile app any idea I might have during the day. It’s like planting a seed of creativity every time you hear or read something interesting. And it worked very well for me for several months. Only I felt like I didn’t go far enough after a while: I took each idea separately, so I was leaving a lot of creative opportunities on the table.\n\n**And that’s when you discovered Roam Research!**\n\nExactly. I discovered [Roam](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research) in January 2020 and immediately thought it was the perfect tool to take things to the next level. Beyond allowing you to list your ideas in a linear fashion like a classic note-taking application, Roam proactively helps you connect them together. This principle of generating new and original ideas from the combination of several ideas has a name: [idea sex](https://nesslabs.com/inspiration-to-idea-sex) (or “combinational creativity”). That’s when I realized that my previous creativity system didn’t work as well, and I switched all my notes to Roam.\n\n**I’ve always wanted to try Roam, but I think its apparent complexity intimidated me for a while. Can you explain to me how you use it on a daily basis?**\n\nI know that the concept of combinational creativity may seem intimidating at first sight, but there is really nothing complicated about my use of Roam. First of all, I still jot down all my ideas on the fly in my mobile app when I’m on the go. Then, I set aside some time each day to open Roam and create a page for each idea — which I will detail as much as I can so that I can remember them accurately over the long term. Then I’ll take time to think about the potential links between my new ideas and the ones I’ve already noted. One of Roam’s key features is the ability to create links between all your ideas — which its algorithm can also suggest to you. Not only does it push you to follow interesting thinking trails, but the tool will also lead you to uncover surprising connections you wouldn’t have thought of otherwise. Finally, I also use Roam for what is called [interstitial journaling](https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling). It consists of taking a moment to document your thoughts between tasks. For example, I’ll go to Roam after our conversation and write down everything that came to mind during the interview. It’s basically a continuous [brain dump](https://nesslabs.com/productive-cognitive-load). It allows me to not worry about forgetting random insights when it’s not the priority of the moment, and to be able to come back to these later. So I use Roam as both a tool for creativity and productivity. In fact, it’s by far the tool that has had the most significant impact on my life, both for my professional work and personal well-being.\n\n**Well, I really need to give it a try then (laughs). And so, you’ve written over two hundred articles and about fifty editions of your newsletter in the last year thanks to your creativity system. Then I was wondering how you go about choosing the order in which you’re going to write particular topics. Basically, do you have an editorial schedule defined beforehand that follows a certain logic?**\n\nAbsolutely not. My creative system encourages me to proactively take notes, write and connect ideas every day. Beyond that, I don’t try to control anything else. There’s really an experimental part to it, in the sense that I never know in advance what I’m going to write about — and therefore the order in which I’m going to tackle the ideas in my creativity inbox. Rigid schedules are not my thing. I like to keep the flexibility to let ideas emerge at any time and to be able to follow the trail whenever one of them piques my curiosity.\n\n**That reminds me of your recent publication on **[**the different types of note-taking applications**](https://nesslabs.com/how-to-choose-the-right-note-taking-app)** grouped into three types of approaches: those of the architect, the librarian and the gardener.**\n\nDefinitely. In this case, I have more of a gardener’s approach. There are two classic mistakes I’ve identified when talking to other people about these note-taking tools. The first one is to choose a system that doesn’t fit your creative style. If you have messy style, with ideas that come from all over the place, you don’t need to force yourself to adopt an architect’s approach. And all the more so because there is no system that is superior to another. There’s no problem with not being very orderly in your way of thinking, quite the contrary. In this situation, the gardener’s approach can help you make the most of your creative style. The second mistake is to think that you can’t deviate from the category you are in. Personally, I find myself to be more comfortable in a gardener’s system, but I also have affinities with the librarian’s approach. Depending on the situation, I’ll borrow from one or the other. Sometimes I even ask architects for advice to help me solve a problem that lends itself to it. So there’s nothing absolute: what is so great in this metaphorical classification is that it consists in knowing yourself better, so that you can build a system that is truly yours and can evolve with you.\n\n**I have this feeling that you truly live and experience what you write about. This is as true when you talk about the concepts and practices resulting from your creative system or when you openly share certain vulnerabilities. As if Maker Mind was a very intellectual approach to the diary exercise. So I was wondering: what was the biggest discovery you’ve made about yourself since you resumed writing?**\n\nFirst, you’re right about the experimental aspect of my work. That’s why I called my company Ness Labs: it’s my little lab and Maker Mind is my research diary. To come back to your question, I used to think I found my home in the tech world’s hustle and bustle. But in the past year, I realized that I really enjoyed the research and reflection process as well. I love working in a team, but I rediscovered the pleasure of being alone, digging into complex topics, and connecting ideas. When I was a child, my parents could leave me alone with my nose in the books all afternoon without me moving an inch. Writing somehow reconciled me with my inner bookworm (laughs).\n\n**That’s so nicely put (laughs)! We’ve covered the topics of creativity and productivity, and now I’d like to talk about what I consider the third pillar of Maker Mind: mental health. How has writing impacted this aspect in your life?**\n\nNote-taking and especially interstitial journaling allow me to identify warning signs of burnout. I experienced burnout in the past and the problem is that I could resist for a very long time without breaking down until it was too late. Today, I am able to act upstream by making decisions and adapting new strategies to prevent it from happening again.\n\n**I had just read **[**in your interview with Dan Shipper from Superorganizers**](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-anne-laure-le-cunff-wrote-200)** that burnout was a real starting point in the creation of Maker Mind. And I just wanted to ask you if you felt you had “cracked the code” of your personal balance or if you still felt at risk despite everything you put in place?**\n\nI don’t think it’s possible to “crack the code” like you say. On the other hand, I now have a much healthier relationship with my mental health. In particular, I have learned to accept that there are external stressors over which I have no control. Like many people, the lockdown has been a trying time for me. Even though I have found a system that works, I am no more able than anyone else to thrive without leaving my home for months. Twice this year, I announced to my readers that there would not be a weekly newsletter following difficult personal moments. Taking care of one’s mental health also means listening to oneself and knowing how to reconsider one’s priorities, with the guiding principle: “be kind to yourself”.\n\n**This year is also special in the sense that we have never talked about mental health as much as in 2020. Did the lockdown and all the news around Covid-19 influence your way of writing on the subject?**\n\nI have always talked about “mindful productivity” to put the emphasis on fulfillment rather than only focusing on goals and performance indicators. Among my readers, there are a lot of very ambitious, very passionate people who tend to work a lot. And indeed, this year’s context has made me insist in my articles on the idea that it’s more important than ever to accept that it’s not always possible to be productive, to also learn how to take the time to breathe and to reconcile with the idea of letting go.\n\n**During the confinement, you went further in this respect by creating a \\[paid] community around Maker Mind. What motivated you to go in that direction?**\n\nTo be very transparent with you, I started the community at a time when I was looking to generate recurring revenue with Ness Labs. It’s a healthy business model for the company, aligned with my values and the ones of my readers. It gives them the opportunity to meet each other, help each other, and move forward together in achieving their life goals. For my part, it allows me to focus on creating high value-added content and to get to know my community better.\n\n**Personally, I have the impression that building a community is more difficult to evaluate in terms of time invested than creating content. Since we were talking about burnout earlier, how do you make sure that it doesn’t become a time-consuming activity next to everything you already do with Maker Mind and Ness Labs?**\n\nTo tell the truth, I didn’t have to set any strict rules and there is nothing stressful about running this community. I’m fortunate to be surrounded by very emotionally intelligent members, some of whom have been following me for a while. I participate every week but I don’t have to force myself to do it. In fact, no one expects me to be available 24 hours a day to answer their questions. It’s a very calm community, not in the sense that nothing happens but because everyone respects each other’s time. I am very happy to see the members interact with each other without having to ask for my permission. For example, I think it’s great to see some members organizing working or writing sessions every day.\n\n**Paid communities are becoming more common for content creators to monetize their projects. Do you think it’s become a must to make a living from your writings?**\n\nThere are many counter-examples, with very high quality paid publications without a community component behind them. So I would say… not necessarily. Still, starting a community opens up many opportunities to better understand your audience and their needs. Personally, I’m very happy to have chosen to take Ness Labs in this direction. While I don’t see it as a prerequisite, I tend to encourage content creators to explore this path.\n\n**In addition to having a community to run and your fast pace of publishing, you also went back to school for a Master’s degree in Neuroscience. What was your initial goal and how did it evolve with the development of your activity?**\n\nWhen I started, I really saw the Master’s degree as a personal need. I wanted to study the inner workings of the human brain. In a way, writing about it helped me consolidate my learning. What I studied in class was often the starting point for reflections in my articles. What I didn’t expect was for this personal curiosity to quickly turn into a real business with Ness Labs.\n\n**I’ve learned that your longer-term vision for Ness Labs is actually a school. I guess going back to class must have inspired you in that respect as well. In fact, I feel like the pieces of the puzzle are coming together very quickly, between everything you’ve got on Roam, all the educational content published this year, and a fast-growing paid community. So when you think about it, Ness Labs already looks a lot like a school. What are the priorities you want to develop for the future?**\n\nI’m fascinated by new models of education. I also find that there are a lot of topics that are not covered in a traditional school and that I think should be covered in a traditional school. Today, nothing that is taught in schools is adapted to the level of demand, self-reflection, flexibility, and also stress that the new work models bring about. That’s why I want to create an alternative education model, with a flexible and decentralized system that would allow everyone to enrich their way of thinking, creating and working. Today, there is already a lot of material on Ness Labs and you can actually dig into many subjects on your own. But I want to create a collection of courses that would explore these topics in depth over several weeks. These would cover topics like developing your creativity or managing your mental health at work, all based on neuroscience. This kind of curriculum is the brick that Ness Labs is currently missing and that I want to add to the edifice.\n\n**What are the new educational models that inspire you the most?**\n\nThere is of course Lambda School, which a lot of people have been following closely over the last few years. More recently, I’ve been particularly interested in On Deck, which brings education and community together better than anyone else. It’s a system of cohorts divided into several fellowships for founders, angels, but also writers and podcast hosts. And what is very powerful in this model is all the possible encounters, synergies and collaborations between individuals, cohorts and fellowships. A member of the writing fellowship will be able to help his cohort’s entrepreneurs with content strategy; these entrepreneurs will be able to receive investments from angels from previous cohorts; and so on. I am very curious to see how these community-based educational models will evolve.\n\n**For your part, you’ve already created a lot of educational content that covers a wide range of topics. Is there a particular one you haven’t written about yet that you would like to explore further?**\n\nOne topic I’ve already touched on but I’m very keen to explore further is ideation; where do ideas come from and how do they form in our brains? It’s all the more fascinating because there are several research streams. Some people have a rather analytical approach to ideation, approaching a problem from all angles to develop new ideas. Others have more of an “aha” moment or [shower thoughts](https://nesslabs.com/mind-wandering). I really want to understand what is going on in the brain at this level and to know if there are ways to increase our capacity for ideation. Right now, I am reading a fascinating and accessible [research paper](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.northwestern.edu/dist/a/699/files/2015/11/The-cognitive-neuroscience-of-insight-1jie1hg.pdf) on the subject by John Kounios, a neuroscience researcher. It’s a topic I’m looking forward to writing about.\n\n**And I’m already looking forward to reading it! We’re coming to the end of this new interview that I’ve been waiting for a long time. And what a journey since our first conversation! I’m both admiring and impressed by your evolution and that of Ness Labs. I will continue to follow all this closely, and probably also get into Roam for good (laughs). So thanks again to you Anne-Laure.**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1\\*feAC0AW5qV57-aYtpOroyA.gif)\n\n## 5 concepts worth exploring, according to Anne-Laure:\n\n*   [The Dunning–Kruger effect](https://nesslabs.com/dunning-kruger-effect)\n*   [Thinking in maps](https://nesslabs.com/thinking-in-maps)\n*   [Mind garden](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden)\n*   [The planning fallacy](https://nesslabs.com/planning-fallacy)\n*   [Thinking inside the box](https://nesslabs.com/systematic-inventive-thinking-inside-the-box)\n\n*If you love this interview, feel free to share it with people who might enjoy it too!

The term was first coined by Li Jin in a now famous blog post. Since then, she developed her investment thesis and founded her own venture firm, [Atelier](https://www.atelierventures.co/), to help entrepreneurs build the future of the passion economy. I had the pleasure to have her as a guest for my newsletter. Here is our interview. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7d3957a8-dae1-43c0-927c-a8f17a3c2510.png?height=601&width=725)\n\n\n\n**Nice to meet you Li, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! It’s a real honor to have you as a guest for my newsletter, which I started a little over a year ago, a few weeks before you gave life to the amazing concept of “passion economy”. To start, can you tell us more about the context in which you published your first article on the subject?**\n\nWorking in venture capital, I had the opportunity to meet many founders building marketplaces in a wide range of verticals. We were particularly interested in how entrepreneurs connect supply and demand in a given market. When I started in venture in 2016, the prevailing model was the “Uber for X,” approach applied to all types of services, whether in education, tourism, or health. The idea was to turn a given service into an on-demand convenience. The consequence of that design is a standardized offering, which commoditized suppliers thus drove prices down.\n\nAs a result, it was difficult for providers to build a career and have upside on these marketplaces. Many individuals stay on these platforms temporarily and don’t view it as a long-term career. And so, a big challenge for these companies is to retain the supply side. But during the last couple of years, I saw a shift where more entrepreneurs addressed markets with more complex or higher-stakes transactions. Their marketplaces served customers looking for more nuanced services and who valued the individuality of the suppliers. The key to the success of these start-ups was richness and diversity of service providers — which I thought was very empowering and aligned to a model of work that I believe will become more prevalent in the future.\n\n**Did you have a specific key moment that proved decisive in the development of your thesis?**\n\nOne of the “aha” moments was a meeting with Amir Nathoo, cofounder and CEO of [Outschool](https://outschool.com/). Outschool is an educational platform that allows teachers to offer live online group classes to kids in K-12. A key element of the platform is that teachers have total freedom in the development of their curriculum, and so you can find a huge range of creative courses, like a class about seasons taught through *Frozen *characters.\n\nWhat stuck with me was that the founder mentioned that Outschool was one of the only ways for their suppliers to earn income flexibility by leveraging their creativity and education. I found it really interesting that the marketplace not only prioritized the needs of the demand side, but also delivered a unique value proposition to the supply side. It was from this meeting that I began to think about the foundations of what became the passion economy and ways to monetize non-commoditized skills.\n\n**Why did you choose the word “passion*”* to illustrate this new economy?**\n\nI chose the term “passion economy” very specifically: passion comes from the latin word “pati,” which means “to suffer”. This is apt because people often confuse passion with happiness — in contrast, I don’t believe being a successful passion economy entrepreneur means being happy all the time. Creators that I’ve spoken to don’t enjoy every moment of what they do; there is a degree of suffering and sacrifice. Passion means continuous effort and work, but feeling that the painful moments are worthwhile because there is a deep-seated sense of fulfillment. I think this is a notion that inspires us and something that we all want in our lives.\n\n**Somehow the passion economy borrows a lot of ideas from the art world, **[**which you seem to be familiar with**](https://li-jin.co/art/)**. Has art influenced your thesis?**\n\nVery likely! What we typically think of as creative industries — art, writing, music — are full of people who are passionate about their work. And in the art world in particular, many people are putting their passion for their craft over financial compensation.\n\nThe biggest commonality is the expression of a person’s imagination and creativity. There is something unique and individual in the products and services you find in the passion economy, whether it’s a video course, a podcast, a newsletter, or other services. Just as a work of art reveals the personality of its creator, these passion economy creations reflect the personality of the people that made them. This is in direct contrast to the “Uber for X” approach, which treats providers as a fungible commodity.\n\n**In your writing on the passion economy, you focus on the supply-side. But I tend to think that passion is equally important to consider on the demand-side. Can we then consider passion as a kind of currency at the center of this new economy?**\n\nEvery successful consumer company has to provide something of value to the consumers at the end of the day — it needs to be an improvement over something that already exists on some dimension. For creator-led offerings, that could be lower cost (because of a different cost structure), greater trust with their consumers, or something else. I wrote about this in a blog post about the links between the passion economy and [disruption theory](https://li.substack.com/p/how-the-passion-economy-will-disrupt). Passion economy models will be most successful in domains where there is an unmet or over-served consumer need.\n\n**I think this is in line with the concept of **[**aspiration economy**](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/veblen-is-wrong-the-new-aspiration-economy-765c3d5456d)** coined by Ana Andjelic, which I find very complementary to your analysis. You’ve also explored how the passion economy enables us to shift to a society in which **[**work is being unbundled from employment**](https://www.atelierventures.co/content/unbundling-work-from-employment)**. What effects do you think we can expect on the identity of individuals?**\n\nWork is still one of the most influential identity markers in our lives. For instance, in tech, there are certain values that are conveyed from the company that employs us; when someone says they work at Google, Facebook, Airbnb, or another company, a certain image comes to mind.\n\nWith the passion economy and the unbundling of work from employment, I imagine a return to a more pre-industrial notion of identity, namely one in which we derive our sense of identity more from what we create, who our customers are, and who our loose association of peers and collaborators are, rather than from a single employer.\n\n**These are ideas that can be found in the software craftsmanship movement too. I have the feeling that the passion economy will keep blurring the lines between the personal and the professional, between private life and public image. What are the main potential risks on the mental health of creators, according to you?**\n\nI think that the personal and professional identities of creators will increasingly merge. This is both a source of fulfillment — that one’s life is one’s work and feels meaningful and is what we choose to do with our time — but it also comes with risks. I recently watched an interview with David Dobrik, where he mentioned that he constantly obsesses over what he’s going to film for his next video on YouTube. As soon as he posts a new video, he is already consumed with thinking about the next one. The prospect of not filming anything interesting is a huge source of anxiety for him. I don’t think this lifestyle is suited for everyone — some people want more balance and separation in their lives.\n\n**If the passion economy becomes a disruptive innovation in Christensen’s sense, then it will have a societal impact that goes far beyond creators. What are the conditions for the passion economy to remain accessible to all and not just become a new “winner-takes-all” system?**\n\nThe key for it to not be “winner-take-all” is that there needs to be heterogeneity in consumer preferences. For example, a newsletter considered by some people as “the best” on a given subject may not suit the expectations and tastes of other readers. If there’s heterogeneous consumer preferences, that implies a long tail of successful creators, with many products/services that are popular among a large number of audience segments.\n\nI would add that an independent creator only needs a relatively small number of customers to make a living. This is the point of my [“100 true fans”](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/) blog, inspired by Kevin Kelly’s concept of [1,000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/): one can be successful with a smaller base of fans, because the internet removes intermediaries and connects creators directly to fans.\n\nFor me, this is the potential of the passion economy I am most excited about: one in which millions of people can participate and earn a living, not just a rarified tier of internet celebrities.\n\n**The first blog post in which you coined the term “passion economy” was a huge success and established you as a thought leader in this new ecosystem. Since then, I imagine that your articles are much more anticipated. Would you say that this has had an impact on your writing?**\n\nI’ve always had a really high bar for my writing. I want to make sure that my writing is worthy of my readers’ interest and attention. Time is our most valuable resource, and every minute spent reading my writing comes at the expense of something else. I always ask myself if what I write offers new insights that will be useful for founders, and am always trying to push forward into something new, interesting, and surprising.\n\n**For me, writing is without a doubt one of the most powerful vectors of serendipity on a lifetime scale. For your part, what were the most memorable events that happened to you following the article you wrote one year ago?**\n\nThe article definitely catalyzed a few interesting things. It led me to meet Adam Davidson, who is a journalist, author, and podcaster (he cofounded NPR’s Planet Money). Earlier this year, he published a book called [*The Passion Economy: the New Rules for Thriving in the Twenty-First Century*](https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Economy-Thriving-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0385353529), which is a more human-centered account of how various individuals are thriving in their careers by leveraging their passions. We’ve become close collaborators. And, in a way, I also jumped into the passion economy myself by founding [Atelier](https://www.atelierventures.co/). I also become more active in creating content: I’m part of the [Everything](https://everything.substack.com/) bundle, and co-host a weekly talk show called [Means of Creation](https://meansofcreation.substack.com/). I’ve also been writing more [in my personal newsletter](https://li.substack.com/) and take more time to paint and create art!\n\n**You actually fit perfectly the definition of a multi-potential person, with highly developed passions that occupy an important place in your life. How do you balance all your various passions with your life and career choices?**\n\nWhen I was a child, my mother told me that time is like a sponge — you can always squeeze more out for what you want to prioritize. That has guided me a lot in my choices. People often ask me how I can have time for all of my projects. I just prioritize and focus my time on what gives me energy rather than what drains it.\n\n**I’ve actually read **[**this advice**](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1131207138418630657)** from Justin Kan in the past and I couldn’t agree more. That being said, I know people who don’t have a real passion in their lives or who don’t even find meaning in what they do. What would you personally recommend them to do in this situation?**\n\nI don’t think that we are born with a certain passion. I believe passion is mostly the result of your education, experiences, and the time you’ve invested in developing various interests. I wouldn’t be as passionate about art had I not studied painting from age 5–18. Even my interest in the passion economy and the future of work is very much influenced by my personal experience as an immigrant, moving from China to the US when I was 6 years old and watching my parents pursue the American Dream. I don’t see a miracle recipe for finding one’s passion other than searching for it — that could be delving into one’s personal history, cultivating your curiosity, or exploring new interests.\n\n**I can’t think of a better way to end this wonderful interview. It was a great pleasure to be able to ask you all these questions about your fascinating journey. So many thanks Li!**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1\\*zBOt4bFsh58E3roVZPLi6A.gif)\n\n## 5 books that touched Li’s life:\n\n*   ***Rebecca* — Daphne du Maurier:** *“Sent me down a rabbit hole of Gothic literature during my teen years.”*\n*   ***Jane Eyre* — Charlotte Brontë:** *“Contains some of the most beautifully romantic passages in the English language.”*\n*   ***The God of Small Things* — Arundhati Roy:** *“Prose that borders poetry.”*\n*   ***How Will You Measure Your Life* — Clay Christensen:** *\"During my first year after college, I lived in New York City and went through a major existential crisis about work and the meaning of my life.

I had a great time talking about the future of writing with such a charismatic polymath.*\n\n*Here is our interview. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1446/1\\*I4a6OzoG6vGyA-\\_-E3BJQg.png)\n\nMax Nussenbaum created the On Deck Writer Fellowship from scratch\n\n**Nice to meet you Max, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! Let’s start with your background: you’ve been alternatively a startup operator, a founder and a freelancer in product, design and software engineering. You’ve also been the coauthor of a business book, **[***Oversubscribed***](https://oversubscribed.club/)**. So I was wondering: why writing? And how did it come to your life among so many interests?**\n\nI’ve been interested in writing for as long as I can remember, even before I have conscious memories. I still have stories I wrote when I was in second grade. Then I went to school for writing and I was a creative writing major. I also wrote a musical in college, and later a book of short stories. So I really thought I was going to be a writer.\n\nBut when I graduated, I realized that becoming a full-time writer didn’t necessarily look the way I’d have imagined. The fact is, I didn’t want to work alone and I wanted my job to be as collaborative as possible. So I ended up making a really sort of unexpected jump into startups. I worked in the tech industry and I started a real estate company that had a classic Silicon Valley rise and fall. But writing was still a big part of my life, mainly through side projects.\n\nI also found that a lot of the skills I was drawing on as a founder were, in some way or another, related to writing. A lot of what I was doing was telling stories, whether it was telling our customers the story of our product, selling our vision to investors or crafting the story of our company. Eventually, I was offered the opportunity to join On Deck and build out the Writer Fellowship last year.\n\n**Such a dream job for you! How did this opportunity happen?**\n\nThis actually ties to my practice of writing. I’ve been friends with [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg), the founder of On Deck, for almost a decade. We both started our careers in Detroit and we bonded over writing. We did a little bit of a writing group together and we both attended a book club that was infamous for only lasting one meeting (laughs). We stayed friends over the years and kept in touch through writing online. When he was thinking about launching the Writer Fellowship, he asked if I wanted to be involved and I eventually said yes.\n\nThis perfectly illustrates one of the reasons why I think that ambitious people should write online. Thanks to my writing, Erik was still able to sort of follow my journey from afar. And when he reached out to me, it wasn’t like we had to spend hours catching up on all the stuff that had happened.\n\n**I agree with you: writing creates a special bond with your readers, which can definitely bring serendipity into your life. And I have the feeling that this is exactly what On Deck is about. So let’s talk about it further! I tend to consider On Deck as an elite program since the endgame is to train the next generation of world-class talents in areas like entrepreneurship, angel investing, content creation, along with healthcare and climate. However, you seem committed to the idea of making your programs accessible to all, as initiatives like your **[**Access Fund**](https://www.beondeck.com/post/access-fund)** show it. But beyond that, how do you balance selectivity and diversity?**\n\nWe have two missions that could seem contradictory at first. One is broadening access and believing that talent can come from anywhere. And as you mentioned, the second is to build a community of world-class talent.\n\nSo the first layer of what we’re doing to expand access is to create a global remote-first community — what some people call the “Silicon Valley in the cloud”. Our goal is to move away from the days when you needed to be living in a specific place to be part of a certain community.\n\nThe second angle is about the journey at On Deck. Every program may be competitive, some are definitely harder to get into than others. For instance, the Founder Fellowship is one of the most difficult to get into. But there’s more than one path to join On Deck. Suppose you might want to start a company someday but don’t necessarily have an idea yet. Well, the Writer or Podcaster Fellowships are more accessible programs that will help you start honing and developing your ideas in the public sphere. And since you’ll be an On Deck Fellow for the rest of your life, it’ll likely be easier to join the Founder Fellowship when you’re ready. If your company takes off, you’ll then have the opportunity to send your employees into other programs such as the First 50 or the Chief of Staff Fellowships.\n\nWhen selecting our future fellows among applicants, we’re asking ourselves two things. First, can we help this person succeed according to their own goals? Second, would this person be a great community member according to our [guiding values](https://www.beondeck.com/guiding-values)? Beyond the programs, On Deck is about giving back, whether it’s with time, knowledge or support. This is why community is a core part of what we’re building.\n\n**I love this “choose your own adventure” approach between the different programs! Can you tell me more about how the different Fellowships communicate with each other?**\n\nWe’re very intentional about making sure that every fellowship has a connection to the others so that they overall make the whole network stronger. Our vision has always been about enabling entrepreneurship. And we view entrepreneurship as something that’s defined much more broadly than this very narrow slice of Silicon Valley that too many people often focus on.\n\nWe tend to forget that writers and podcasters do build products, connect with an audience and create communities. They’re entrepreneurs too! Having a successful writing practice actually involves a lot of skills other than just putting words together. Beyond writing, you need to understand the basics of growth, branding and distribution for instance. And I think it’s much more stimulating to learn all these things within a community of peers than on your own. This is a big part of the thesis behind the Writer Fellowship.\n\nAlso, we are building *one* global community, not just siloed fellowships. And so we do a number of things to enable the fellows from different programs to interact. In February, we’ll have our first ever Global Build Weekend. The goal is to make people from different fellowships collaborate on teams. For instance, I’m looking forward to seeing the next cohort of writers learn the fundamentals of visual branding from the design fellows. In return, they will have the opportunity to teach them some storytelling and copywriting techniques.\n\n**I assume that a program such as the Writer Fellowship must be very tied to your own personality. How did you bring it to the curriculum?**\n\nThat’s a great question! The Writer Fellowship was basically the first program launched after the Founder Fellowship. So I’ve helped a lot of the other program directors who have been launching new fellowships after me.\n\nOne of the things I’d really emphasize is that your program just inevitably takes on your own personality. When your product is an interactive experience within a community, there’s such a direct emotional connection between you and the “customers”. As program directors, we are lucky to have a lot of freedom to shape our curriculum as we wish. And my personal belief is that it’s all about the small things, from the music I choose when introducing a speaker to the dumb jokes I make in my presentations.\n\nOur approach is very bottom-up and not “one size fits all”. It’s not a ten-step writing course where everyone has to do the exact same things in the exact same order. You don’t have to write a specific essay during the program or anything like that. We aim at independent and entrepreneurial people who already have specific goals and ambitions. And we want to be in a position where we have a broad curriculum that can support all of that.\n\n**Plus, having a “one size fits all” program would result in growing an army of clones writing about the same things with the same style. Can you tell me more about how you ensure to adapt to each person’s personality and authenticity?**\n\nThe truth is, a big part of the program is about psychology. Like most creators, our fellows face common issues such as procrastination, lack of motivation, imposter syndrome or being scared to show their work publicly. Some of them don’t really need to be taught how to write as they are already great at this, even though there’s always room for improvement. Their most urgent need is support, so that they can get over their fears and have the courage to write about that topic that scares them.\n\nI like to draw the comparison with the Founder Fellowship, as it’s very uncommon for an entrepreneur to start a company and then the startup fails because they just procrastinate and don’t get any work done. But that’s comparatively a very common failure mode among creators, even for experienced writers. A huge part of what we’re doing at On Deck is to create a comfortable environment for people to do what they’re good at.\n\nWe also want the program to be a really exploratory space. The fact that we’re not pushing everyone towards one defined outcome is actually a great opportunity to explore. I love nothing more than seeing someone who comes into the program to develop their blog, let’s say about the great economic competition between the US and China, and eventually decides to start an essay about their experience raising a family after seeing some other fellows writing very personal stuff. It doesn’t mean they’re going to stop writing about economics, but it’s a way to be able to stretch their wings and kind of get their creative juices going.\n\n**At the moment, the curriculum is mainly designed for people who are building an audience. But I guess that you could extend it to a lot of areas such as publishing, screenwriting, journalism, or even music. How would you personally want to see the Writer Fellowship evolve?**\n\nIt’s definitely something that we think about. The good news is that we’ve attracted people working on several of these areas among our fellows. It’s very likely that within a year or two we’ll have dedicated programs for some of these topics.\n\nThe only thing is that we want to create programs that can legitimately help a lot of people succeed. I’ll take an example from my background as an aspiring fiction writer to illustrate what we wouldn’t do. So I’ve taken a lot of writing workshops in my life. Last summer, I was attending one in New York. Everyone in this workshop was trying to become a novelist. But when I looked around, I couldn’t help but think that no one here was ever going to be a published author. I’m not making any judgments but I’ve had the feeling that what these workshops are really selling is the opportunity to believe in the dream for a few hours a week.\n\nSo, would we ever start an On Deck fellowship to help people try to get a publishing deal? Well, almost certainly not since publishing is kind of a dying industry. Actually, one of the best ways to get published these days is to grow an audience and then leverage that into a book deal. But having a program focused on succeeding in traditional publishing would be like selling a pipe dream that the vast majority of people couldn’t achieve. It would be unethical taking people’s money knowing that the vast majority of them are never going to get there.\n\nOne interesting fact about our fellows is that they haven’t joined On Deck because they think that we’ll help them build a paid publication that will provide them 100% of their income. Rather, they see the fellowship as an opportunity to explore, to supercharge their career by writing about the topics they’re interested in, to connect with a broader network to boost their personal brand, and sometimes to make some money on the side. But those are all very achievable goals we can help them with.\n\n**That’s a very honest approach. I was simply curious about this possible evolution when I’ve noticed that you have someone in the first cohort who writes poetry.**\n\nYou’re referencing [Alysia Harris](http://alysiaharris.com/), a fellow who’s an award-winning poet and an incredible artist. She helped us learn a fantastic lesson during the first cohort. The vast majority of people in the program are primarily writing nonfiction. Yet we had several creative workshops, one or two about poetry, and what we actually realized was that even if you’re primarily writing nonfiction, you can get a ton of value out of doing a poetry workshop. You’re probably not going to just start being a poet. But they can be a great way to think more creatively and kind of get out of your rut. And the responses we got to these creative workshops have been very enthusiastic!\n\n**You’re preaching to the converted (laughs). I’m personally convinced that diversifying what you read and write on is key to find and sharpen your own style. Your ideas made me think of **[**another interview I had with Li Jin**](https://medium.com/@Benjamin_Prune/pioneering-the-passion-economy-a79fcbafc00f)** last October. **[**Her thesis**](https://www.atelierventures.co/thesis)** on the passion economy is essential to figure out what’s to come for creators. So I was wondering: how do you envision the future of writing?**\n\nI think we’re at a really interesting inflection point for writing. While many of the traditional industries and mediums are suffering, people read and write today more than ever before. This is really exciting, with both a lot of opportunity and peril.\n\nFirst, I think that people are too often too quick to view writing or other forms of creation with a binary viewpoint: either they’re trying to make it a full-time job or it’ll just be a hobby. But there’s a lot of space in between. For instance, I know someone who works in grocery logistics and writes a blog about the industry, which helped him get better career opportunities that he couldn’t have had otherwise.\n\nAlso, I’m a huge believer in Li’s approach of the passion economy. But like most things on the Internet, I think it’s going to end up forming a power law distribution. Substack is a great opportunity for independent writers, yet most people are never going to be able to support themselves entirely through a paid publication. I believe that many writers will follow the trajectory a lot of musicians have taken. The latter have started to think of themselves as products and monetized features like live touring, merchandising, private events, crowdfunding, etc. What I’d advise writers is to take a holistic view and figure out how they can bundle or unbundle what they have to offer. So the question is not about whether going full-time but about having multiple sources of income.\n\nIn some ways, that can be a depressing vision when you think that there was a much larger group of people making a living as full-time writers in 1960 than there is now. But let’s not forget that these people were pretty much all white men who came from elite universities.\n\n**And this is a very important point. But the new platforms have yet to prove that they can reverse this situation. To end up on a more personal touch: what are your writing projects right now?**\n\nI write a weekly email newsletter called [My Super Secret Diary](http://mysupersecretdiary.com/). I present it as a publication about “startups, literature, philosophy, American history, sex & drugs, and how to be alive,” but it’s really just about whatever I feel like writing about. It keeps me practicing and sharing my thoughts with what I like to call my “minimum viable audience”. I’m positive that it won’t be my only writing project for long, but for now running the On Deck Writer Fellowship is a pretty busy dream job (laughs).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*efXaixTZEeM7BIhHS5Y7eQ.gif)\n\n## **5 resources on writing curated by Max:**\n\n*   [**George Orwell’s Six Rules for Writing:**](https://infusion.media/blog/george-orwells-six-rules-for-writing/) “Classic tips from a master from his essay *Politics and the English Language*”.\n*   [**What I Did Not Learn About Writing in School, by Eugene Wan:**](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-did-not-learn-about-writing-in-school/) “A bunch of excellent tips, including some great advice on figuring out what to write about — *you don’t find your niche; your niche finds you*.”\n*   [***On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft*, by Stephen King:**](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816) “I’m not even really much of a Stephen King fan, but this is one of the best books about writing ever written.”\n*   [**Five Short Stories by Lydia Davis:**](https://fivedials.com/fiction/five-short-stories/) “These are works of (very) short fiction, not articles “about” writing, but Lydia Davis is a master of the craft and you’ll learn a ton about what’s possible from reading her.”\n*   [**Julian Shapiro’s Writing Handbook**](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro)**:** “It’s amazing that one person can write so many useful guides about so many different topics, but somehow Julian Shapiro’s done it.”\n", "timestamp": 1624552704, "digest": "9GZm-IGk-oL_OmxsLHl_fEApuZd3a5NkaITLS7jJ3ck", "contributor": "0xb18501548Eeb4660c2348A75515e2740041999F6"}

She is also the author of my all-time favourite newsletter, [*Check Your Pulse*](https://www.checkyourpulse.co/). I had so many questions for her about her excellent taste for curation, her specific approach of knowledge management and her views on the future of the Internet. Just follow the white rabbit at your own pace, I’ll see you through the looking-glass. Here is our conversation. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d752de5f-45e2-409a-b46c-3109c708f776.png?height=478&width=724)\n\n\n**Hi Sari, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time and it’s a real pleasure to have you as a guest for my newsletter. I discovered your work a couple of years ago through the fantastic Check Your Pulse, that you describe as “a tech and startup newsletter designed to make you feel more human”. How did it all start?**\n\nI am a voracious consumer of information. I have always loved to discover new things, take screenshots of everything and fall down Internet rabbit holes… Prior to having a newsletter on Substack, I used to post recaps of what inspired me every week on Instagram. But it’s not a medium that encourages reflection.\n\nAll you do is scroll through an endless feed, so there was no room for reading in-depth articles, let alone thinking about their context. Then I kept the idea of sharing the things that inspired me but switched to a newsletter format. If you go back to the early issues, you’ll notice that it was mostly just curated links from all over the Internet.\n\nI also wanted to add that I was born and raised in Colombia. English is my second language and I had a bit of insecurity around my writing. I never thought of myself as a writer and I’m grateful that the curation work invited me to share some of my own ideas.\n\n**How did the thesis behind Check Your Pulse evolve?**\n\nI have developed this feeling over time that a lot of the tech writing is for the sake of technology. There is this assumption that everything we build with code is progress. But can drones be called progress? Who truly benefits from them? Even for topics like crypto, a lot of the media coverage is not from a human perspective. And yet, the most important part is how these technologies are going to affect our lives, and the nuances around that. So I wanted my newsletter to start conversations about technology that were less intimidating and more accessible because they put humans at the center of the conversation.\n\n**That may explain why I’m a big fan of your curation game! Check Your Pulse is by far the newsletter I click the most links. I believe that taste is the central element in the exercise of curating things. And in my opinion, you have the very best of the Internet. How have you been cultivating it over time?**\n\nFirst of all, thanks for such a great compliment! I share things that resonate with me and it’s always wonderful to know that they resonate with others. I am committed to the idea of respecting readers’ time and I have a very high bar for anything I share. When it comes to curation, I believe that “less is more”. I’m obsessed with the question of what I should remove while most media is focused on what else to add. The traditional business model for writing incentivizes people to share a bunch of stuff, not incredible gems. That’s why it’s so important for me to not be beholden to a schedule. I don’t want to worry about not finding enough things that meet the bar, which would be the case if I was on a weekly cadence. I don’t want that kind of pressure.\n\n**It makes me think of this **[**fantastic presentation**](https://projector.com/story/8fa326cf-ddd7-4ef4-972a-a7430feb8e00)** in which you remind people that it’s OK not to have anything to publish sometimes.**\n\nI’m reminded of the quote that says the job of a journalist is to “write faster than I can think”… unfortunately, even though we’ve made great strides in publishing advancements, the business model of emerging subscription-based media encourages consistent writing and leaves out millions of people that have a lot to share but don’t see themselves as writers — or aren’t going to share things on a weekly basis. But what if the one-off writer had an incentive to share? We need a new business model designed to fund one-off quality writing online. I’m running an experiment soon that explores a potential solution here.\n\n**I can’t wait to learn more about it! I saw that you also entered **[**the $WRITE race on Mirror.xyz**](https://dev.mirror.xyz/vZxxUIeGMQK9NNLcrT0eDYZ6wXhXVr6vTQzztj1DaEA)**. Do you think that this model could be the future of publishing?**\n\nThe team behind Mirror.xyz is building a user-owned alternative to Substack in which publishers and readers have an incentive to grow the platform. The project is still very early. As far as I understand, you earn tokens based on the value that you deliver to the network. Then as the platform grows, so does the value of the token. The comparison with Substack is interesting since it takes 10% of a publication’s revenue and can’t prevent writers from leaving for a cheaper alternative. But if there was a Substack token, then the people who joined years ago would still be incentivized to stay and help the platform grow. I am personally convinced that the fundamental promise of crypto is to be able to share and exchange value in very granular ways with your community — and that is a huge unlock.\n\n**That makes me think of **[**this tweet**](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1308430095460134912)** by Balaji Srinivasan from last year. He said that investing could be the most prevalent skill of the 21st century. And between the thriving crypto ecosystem, the WallStreetBets movement and the current NFT craze, it actually makes total sense.**\n\nIt’s fascinating because I do think that we’re living in a world where everything is financialized. These days, you can purchase anything that is consumable online: a tweet, a piece of digital art, etc. I’m a little bit concerned about this because I think it’s very hard to make money. If you think about the value proposition of these tokens, you know, I would say financial or economic upside is one of them. Then there’s governance and access. But beyond that, there’s an interesting concept of Patronage+ (coined by Jesse Walden) which is just this feeling of supporting a creator, with potential upside. It’s hard to see it as a financial instrument alone — I personally don’t see it. Packy McCormick wrote[ a newsletter](https://www.notboring.co/p/software-is-eating-the-markets) on this phenomenon of Angel Investing and how it’s less about the financial return and more about the social capital that comes with it. And I think something similar happens with cryptos and NFTs.\n\nIt’s all about the status. What does it mean to own it, to have invested in this company? What does it say about me? What does it signal about me? And I think investors have a similar dynamic where they don’t mean, we’ll get rich off of it. Many of them have already. But I think it’s more about the cultural value. When I was growing up in Colombia, I would sometimes come to the U.S. in the summers and I would buy a cool pair of shoes that they didn’t sell in my home country. And I would be excited to go back to school and kind of show off my shoes.\n\nAnd so the equivalent of that dynamic from the physical world now applies online, since posting a picture on Instagram for the whole world to see has a bigger reach than just showing up with a new pair of shoes in my school. And so I think NFT is a little bit of that. If the balance is shifting to digital, then how do I flex my taste online?\n\n**The **[**CryptoPunks**](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)** kind of summarized this with their owners adding the avatars of the NFTs they purchased as their Twitter profile pictures. Same for the **[**laser eyes**](https://decrypt.co/58302/elon-musk-bitcoin-advocates-have-laser-eyes-on-twitter-heres-why)** with the Bitcoin bullish. It’s a kind of statement, a signal that you belong to a cultural movement. I guess these different trends inspired you while building your latest project **[**Startupy**](https://startupy.world/)**. You describe it as what would happen “if Roam, Wikipedia, Substack and Product Hunt had a baby”. How did the idea of Startupy come to you?**\n\nAs I said, I spend a lot of time reading online. And just like everyone, I tend to forget a lot of what I read. Then it’s hard for me to get compound interest on the things that I read if they’re not properly stored for later use. And so for example, I would often meet with a founder who was building a marketplace business. And I was like, oh, you should be reading this thing or that thing. Or like a lot of these things I was reading, I was like, I wish I could share them with you. But even just going back and finding them was really hard.\n\nSo I basically started cultivating my own database or mini Google. Initially, it was this very simple architecture, storing content and companies that I was tracking and making them searchable. And then, it dawned on me one day that this was a fundamentally different information architecture than where we’re used to consuming information. In most places online, we only consume information recreationally. You go on Twitter and yes, there are incredible ideas that are shared. But if you don’t store them for later use, when you’re thinking about it at the right time, it’s hard to actually take action on them or have them actually affect our real world activities or undertakings.\n\nAnd so I kind of started dreaming of kind of like, what would be the ideal way for me to consume this information? I wanted it to be findable. I wanted it to be serendipitous. I wanted it to be associative so that it would take me down these context rich pathways. So for instance, if I’m interested in the future of restaurants, I could start with a podcast episode by Patrick O’Shaughnessy, and then find the guest of that podcast, see what else he’s written, find a company he invested in, understand more about that company, etc. Eventually you start to develop combinatorial creativity, which is how you combine things from another industry and apply them to yours.\n\nAnd I think it’s very hard to do that with the information architectures that exist today. We basically have interruption technologies. We don’t have tools for thought. It’s a cliche term but for me, it’s about how we transition from information being an interruption to information being a tool to reflect.\n\nThe fundamental problem is information abundance (which requires curation), and information structure (which requires a better architecture to consume information). And so Startupy is what I call a community-curated knowledge network. That will enable us to not have to subscribe to one hundred newsletters and have them interrupt our days, but rather find things as we need them. I also want Startupy to inspire us with serendipity, because I’ve always believed that one of the biggest underutilized assets in the world is people’s time spent uninspired\n\n**I can’t help but think of Dumbledore’s **[**Pensieve**](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pensieve)** in Harry Potter (laughs). The only difference is that Startupy is community-curated. Can you tell me more about how it works?**\n\nThe MVP for Startupy was a database I built on Airtable. What I’m developing now is a multiplayer environment. The next step is to onboard people who want to participate in this curator collective. Then, we’ll work together to curate this database over time. My dream for this is to build a digital place the community both works on and is collectively rewarded for.\n\nAnd that’s why the case for user ownership online is so interesting. If you think about Twitter, they rely on people’s creative labor and they just sell advertising on the back of that. But what if you create a win-win situation where the curators are benefiting from their work instead of being exploited? I think that curation has never been given the kind of love, honor and attention that it deserves. After all, curators are a class of creators. And for me, curation is not just about link sharing. It’s not just, hey, here are ten new links this week. It’s about context. What does this specific link tell me about broader cultural or technological trends? What is important about this piece? There is so much value that has been stripped from curators because we call so many things curation. For instance, newsletters with hundreds of links are not the kind of curation that I envision for Startupy.\n\n**Have you started to work with some curators yet?**\n\nThe product is still in development. I think it’ll be ready in a couple of months and we’re going to launch our first curator cohort soon. So the hope is that we start with this cohort model to set the tone and to really cultivate this community. I’m kind of questioning the status quo across a lot of things with this product. And one of the things that we’re trying to do differently lies in the fact that most platforms these days have zero friction to publish or create. Anyone can post on Twitter. Anyone can write on Medium. And so I almost want to flip that on its head and wonder, what is a healthy amount of friction? On Twitter, 90% of tweets are created by 5% of the accounts. Then why don’t we build a product for those 5%? Startupy isn’t designed for people who just want to lurk. We are reimagining a lot of those things from the ground up. The first kind of friction that I need to decide is precisely around *who* is going to curate.\n\n**That’s fascinating! And how do you intend to qualify, select, and somehow… curate curators?**\n\nIt’s funny because you mentioned taste earlier in the conversation. The fact is, we’ve been working on the application process by focusing on identifying good taste. I guess that our definition of what good taste means for us will evolve over time, along with the kind of signals that we’re looking for. So far we’ve been asking questions like, what pieces of writing have changed your life? What is the latest rabbit hole you went under? We’re trying to find people that have a knack for finding and contextualizing non-obvious, thoughtful, nuanced, hidden gems. I’m less interested in Startupy becoming a place where you can see what Ben Thompson has curated, but rather a place where we can breed a new class of curators who have great taste but aren’t necessarily well-known. And so we have to find the best way to strike a balance.\n\n**You mentioned several times the term of “rabbit hole”, which is at the core of the Startupy brand. But isn’t it a kind of contradiction with what you said about respecting people’s time on the Internet?**\n\nFirst of all, it’s a great question! To me, the main difference between wasting your time on the Internet and engaging in a rabbit hole is about whether you’re in a flow state. When I’m on Twitter, I feel entertained, I feel inspired, but my thought process is constantly disrupted. It’s very different from the rabbit holes I want to encourage with Startupy. Let’s take an example I’m very familiar with. So these days, I’ve been thinking a lot about what it means to create a healthy community with strong content moderation. And so the idea is to start your research on Startupy looking for what has been curated around the history of censorship, social networks and moderation. The difference is that I do have this intention in mind, that of answering a question. Then I do want to expose myself to so many different things around this one topic. It’s rather about research with serendipity than entertainment with interruptions. Social platforms that promote viral content, blind engagement and inflammatory information stripped of context haven’t been designed to enhance your reflection. But going down a rabbit hole on a knowledge database that encourages flow state, concentration and the development of new ideas is a healthy approach in my opinion.\n\n**Definitely! I just wanted to play devil’s advocate here (laughs). Since we started the interview, you mentioned several toxic habits like the endless scrolling on social media, our unconscious tolerance for being interrupted and all these uninspired moments we spend online. So I was wondering, what would you recommend for a healthy Internet diet?**\n\nOn the Internet, you’re always encouraged to engage with still more content. But time is a scarce resource, not information. What I’d recommend is to switch from a consumer mindset to a creator mindset. Having projects puts you in a position where you’re not constantly just absorbing other people’s thoughts, but thinking about how to manifest your own. For instance, I switched to Hey for my emails and all the newsletters I follow go directly into a folder that I only open once or twice a week. This way, I’m not interrupted when I work and my inbox is super empty. Also, I set up an auto-reply that says that I’m trying to spend most of my time thinking and not responding to emails, and then that I’m not going to be able to respond super quickly.\n\nIn the era of Clubhouse, we’ve grown accustomed to doing everything immediately because of the instantaneity of such products. But I actually believe that everything on the Internet should be accessible on demand whenever you need it. I don’t want another product that will prevent me from spending time with my family. People shouldn’t have FOMO when they miss a Clubhouse room or have yet to read the newsletter that everyone has been talking about on Twitter. This is the main thesis behind Startupy: capturing the gems and storing them so that they’re available for later use. I believe that most problems online are completely solvable by design. And I’m confident that we’ll see more product designs with digital wellness in mind.\n\n**Speaking about the future of the Internet, I’d like to close this interview with your views on this huge topic. So among all the current trends, what do you think is here to stay for the next decade?**\n\nFirst, I believe that something to not be underestimated is that a bigger part of the value that we generate is going to happen digitally. The number of people that have made a single dollar online is still very minor when you think globally. But that’s going to shift. We would have never thought that teenagers streaming games on Twitch could make a living of it. Or that creators like Jake Butcher would make six-figure revenues by sharing online courses — and more recently selling graphics as NFT. I believe that the young generation will create all kinds of things on the Internet that we cannot even fathom. Then the nature of the job market is going to change dramatically.\n\nThe second part of my answer is about online friendship. The first wave of the Internet was very much about taking your IRL friends to Facebook and connecting online with people you already knew. But that’s such a limited understanding of the potential of the Internet. What’s more interesting is to make friends after meeting online. For instance, we met on Twitter and our ideas resonated with each other. You reached out and eventually we did this interview. And you may live in Paris while I am based in Miami, you definitely have more in common with me than I do with a lot of my friends that I went to school with and grew up with in Colombia. And I believe that tapping into that to help people make friends and create things based on their mutual interests is going to be a fascinating area to watch. The potential for the Internet as a bigger engine of serendipity and friendship is only at the very beginning.\n\nEventually, the most important aspect is how we make sure that more people benefit from all of the wealth and value created online? During the last decade, most of our interactions on the Internet were transactional: a company would do something for us and we would pay for it. Now, that relationship is a lot more complex because the user is not only a consumer but also a creator. For instance, I’m a consumer of Twitter. But since I tweet, I also add value to the network. I’m very excited about what it means to reimagine from first principles what new business models will look like in a world where the lines keep blurring between providers and users, medias and platforms, consumers and creators, etc. The reality (and beauty) of the Internet is much more nuanced and sophisticated, and so the rewards for value creation should be.\n\n**This seems to me to be a perfect conclusion to this interview. Sari, I owe you a big THANK YOU! It was even better than I could have imagined — and yet my expectations were already high (laughs). I’ll be following Startupy very closely and can’t wait to see what you have in store for us.

Packy McCormick wrote[ a newsletter](https://www.notboring.co/p/software-is-eating-the-markets) on this phenomenon of Angel Investing and how it’s less about the financial return and more about the social capital that comes with it. And I think something similar happens with cryptos and NFTs.\n\nIt’s all about the status. What does it mean to own it, to have invested in this company? What does it say about me? What does it signal about me? And I think investors have a similar dynamic where they don’t mean, we’ll get rich off of it. Many of them have already. But I think it’s more about the cultural value. When I was growing up in Colombia, I would sometimes come to the U.S. in the summers and I would buy a cool pair of shoes that they didn’t sell in my home country. And I would be excited to go back to school and kind of show off my shoes.\n\nAnd so the equivalent of that dynamic from the physical world now applies online, since posting a picture on Instagram for the whole world to see has a bigger reach than just showing up with a new pair of shoes in my school. And so I think NFT is a little bit of that. If the balance is shifting to digital, then how do I flex my taste online?\n\n**The **[**CryptoPunks**](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)** kind of summarized this with their owners adding the avatars of the NFTs they purchased as their Twitter profile pictures. Same for the **[**laser eyes**](https://decrypt.co/58302/elon-musk-bitcoin-advocates-have-laser-eyes-on-twitter-heres-why)** with the Bitcoin bullish. It’s a kind of statement, a signal that you belong to a cultural movement. I guess these different trends inspired you while building your latest project **[**Startupy**](https://startupy.world/)**. You describe it as what would happen “if Roam, Wikipedia, Substack and Product Hunt had a baby”. How did the idea of Startupy come to you?**\n\nAs I said, I spend a lot of time reading online. And just like everyone, I tend to forget a lot of what I read. Then it’s hard for me to get compound interest on the things that I read if they’re not properly stored for later use. And so for example, I would often meet with a founder who was building a marketplace business. And I was like, oh, you should be reading this thing or that thing. Or like a lot of these things I was reading, I was like, I wish I could share them with you. But even just going back and finding them was really hard.\n\nSo I basically started cultivating my own database or mini Google. Initially, it was this very simple architecture, storing content and companies that I was tracking and making them searchable. And then, it dawned on me one day that this was a fundamentally different information architecture than where we’re used to consuming information. In most places online, we only consume information recreationally. You go on Twitter and yes, there are incredible ideas that are shared. But if you don’t store them for later use, when you’re thinking about it at the right time, it’s hard to actually take action on them or have them actually affect our real world activities or undertakings.\n\nAnd so I kind of started dreaming of kind of like, what would be the ideal way for me to consume this information? I wanted it to be findable. I wanted it to be serendipitous. I wanted it to be associative so that it would take me down these context rich pathways. So for instance, if I’m interested in the future of restaurants, I could start with a podcast episode by Patrick O’Shaughnessy, and then find the guest of that podcast, see what else he’s written, find a company he invested in, understand more about that company, etc. Eventually you start to develop combinatorial creativity, which is how you combine things from another industry and apply them to yours.\n\nAnd I think it’s very hard to do that with the information architectures that exist today. We basically have interruption technologies. We don’t have tools for thought. It’s a cliche term but for me, it’s about how we transition from information being an interruption to information being a tool to reflect.\n\nThe fundamental problem is information abundance (which requires curation), and information structure (which requires a better architecture to consume information). And so Startupy is what I call a community-curated knowledge network. That will enable us to not have to subscribe to one hundred newsletters and have them interrupt our days, but rather find things as we need them. I also want Startupy to inspire us with serendipity, because I’ve always believed that one of the biggest underutilized assets in the world is people’s time spent uninspired\n\n**I can’t help but think of Dumbledore’s **[**Pensieve**](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pensieve)** in Harry Potter (laughs). The only difference is that Startupy is community-curated. Can you tell me more about how it works?**\n\nThe MVP for Startupy was a database I built on Airtable. What I’m developing now is a multiplayer environment. The next step is to onboard people who want to participate in this curator collective. Then, we’ll work together to curate this database over time. My dream for this is to build a digital place the community both works on and is collectively rewarded for.\n\nAnd that’s why the case for user ownership online is so interesting. If you think about Twitter, they rely on people’s creative labor and they just sell advertising on the back of that. But what if you create a win-win situation where the curators are benefiting from their work instead of being exploited? I think that curation has never been given the kind of love, honor and attention that it deserves. After all, curators are a class of creators. And for me, curation is not just about link sharing. It’s not just, hey, here are ten new links this week. It’s about context. What does this specific link tell me about broader cultural or technological trends? What is important about this piece? There is so much value that has been stripped from curators because we call so many things curation. For instance, newsletters with hundreds of links are not the kind of curation that I envision for Startupy.\n\n**Have you started to work with some curators yet?**\n\nThe product is still in development. I think it’ll be ready in a couple of months and we’re going to launch our first curator cohort soon. So the hope is that we start with this cohort model to set the tone and to really cultivate this community. I’m kind of questioning the status quo across a lot of things with this product. And one of the things that we’re trying to do differently lies in the fact that most platforms these days have zero friction to publish or create. Anyone can post on Twitter. Anyone can write on Medium. And so I almost want to flip that on its head and wonder, what is a healthy amount of friction? On Twitter, 90% of tweets are created by 5% of the accounts. Then why don’t we build a product for those 5%? Startupy isn’t designed for people who just want to lurk. We are reimagining a lot of those things from the ground up. The first kind of friction that I need to decide is precisely around *who* is going to curate.\n\n**That’s fascinating! And how do you intend to qualify, select, and somehow… curate curators?**\n\nIt’s funny because you mentioned taste earlier in the conversation. The fact is, we’ve been working on the application process by focusing on identifying good taste. I guess that our definition of what good taste means for us will evolve over time, along with the kind of signals that we’re looking for. So far we’ve been asking questions like, what pieces of writing have changed your life? What is the latest rabbit hole you went under? We’re trying to find people that have a knack for finding and contextualizing non-obvious, thoughtful, nuanced, hidden gems. I’m less interested in Startupy becoming a place where you can see what Ben Thompson has curated, but rather a place where we can breed a new class of curators who have great taste but aren’t necessarily well-known. And so we have to find the best way to strike a balance.\n\n**You mentioned several times the term of “rabbit hole”, which is at the core of the Startupy brand. But isn’t it a kind of contradiction with what you said about respecting people’s time on the Internet?**\n\nFirst of all, it’s a great question! To me, the main difference between wasting your time on the Internet and engaging in a rabbit hole is about whether you’re in a flow state. When I’m on Twitter, I feel entertained, I feel inspired, but my thought process is constantly disrupted. It’s very different from the rabbit holes I want to encourage with Startupy. Let’s take an example I’m very familiar with. So these days, I’ve been thinking a lot about what it means to create a healthy community with strong content moderation. And so the idea is to start your research on Startupy looking for what has been curated around the history of censorship, social networks and moderation. The difference is that I do have this intention in mind, that of answering a question. Then I do want to expose myself to so many different things around this one topic. It’s rather about research with serendipity than entertainment with interruptions. Social platforms that promote viral content, blind engagement and inflammatory information stripped of context haven’t been designed to enhance your reflection. But going down a rabbit hole on a knowledge database that encourages flow state, concentration and the development of new ideas is a healthy approach in my opinion.\n\n**Definitely! I just wanted to play devil’s advocate here (laughs). Since we started the interview, you mentioned several toxic habits like the endless scrolling on social media, our unconscious tolerance for being interrupted and all these uninspired moments we spend online. So I was wondering, what would you recommend for a healthy Internet diet?**\n\nOn the Internet, you’re always encouraged to engage with still more content. But time is a scarce resource, not information. What I’d recommend is to switch from a consumer mindset to a creator mindset. Having projects puts you in a position where you’re not constantly just absorbing other people’s thoughts, but thinking about how to manifest your own. For instance, I switched to Hey for my emails and all the newsletters I follow go directly into a folder that I only open once or twice a week. This way, I’m not interrupted when I work and my inbox is super empty. Also, I set up an auto-reply that says that I’m trying to spend most of my time thinking and not responding to emails, and then that I’m not going to be able to respond super quickly.\n\nIn the era of Clubhouse, we’ve grown accustomed to doing everything immediately because of the instantaneity of such products. But I actually believe that everything on the Internet should be accessible on demand whenever you need it. I don’t want another product that will prevent me from spending time with my family. People shouldn’t have FOMO when they miss a Clubhouse room or have yet to read the newsletter that everyone has been talking about on Twitter. This is the main thesis behind Startupy: capturing the gems and storing them so that they’re available for later use. I believe that most problems online are completely solvable by design. And I’m confident that we’ll see more product designs with digital wellness in mind.\n\n**Speaking about the future of the Internet, I’d like to close this interview with your views on this huge topic. So among all the current trends, what do you think is here to stay for the next decade?**\n\nFirst, I believe that something to not be underestimated is that a bigger part of the value that we generate is going to happen digitally. The number of people that have made a single dollar online is still very minor when you think globally. But that’s going to shift. We would have never thought that teenagers streaming games on Twitch could make a living of it. Or that creators like Jake Butcher would make six-figure revenues by sharing online courses — and more recently selling graphics as NFT. I believe that the young generation will create all kinds of things on the Internet that we cannot even fathom. Then the nature of the job market is going to change dramatically.\n\nThe second part of my answer is about online friendship. The first wave of the Internet was very much about taking your IRL friends to Facebook and connecting online with people you already knew. But that’s such a limited understanding of the potential of the Internet. What’s more interesting is to make friends after meeting online. For instance, we met on Twitter and our ideas resonated with each other. You reached out and eventually we did this interview. And you may live in Paris while I am based in Miami, you definitely have more in common with me than I do with a lot of my friends that I went to school with and grew up with in Colombia. And I believe that tapping into that to help people make friends and create things based on their mutual interests is going to be a fascinating area to watch. The potential for the Internet as a bigger engine of serendipity and friendship is only at the very beginning.\n\nEventually, the most important aspect is how we make sure that more people benefit from all of the wealth and value created online? During the last decade, most of our interactions on the Internet were transactional: a company would do something for us and we would pay for it. Now, that relationship is a lot more complex because the user is not only a consumer but also a creator. For instance, I’m a consumer of Twitter. But since I tweet, I also add value to the network. I’m very excited about what it means to reimagine from first principles what new business models will look like in a world where the lines keep blurring between providers and users, medias and platforms, consumers and creators, etc. The reality (and beauty) of the Internet is much more nuanced and sophisticated, and so the rewards for value creation should be.\n\n**This seems to me to be a perfect conclusion to this interview. Sari, I owe you a big THANK YOU! It was even better than I could have imagined — and yet my expectations were already high (laughs). I’ll be following Startupy very closely and can’t wait to see what you have in store for us.

The term was first coined by Li Jin in a now famous blog post. Since then, she developed her investment thesis and founded her own venture firm, [Atelier](https://www.atelierventures.co/), to help entrepreneurs build the future of the passion economy. I had the pleasure to have her as a guest for my newsletter. Here is our interview. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7d3957a8-dae1-43c0-927c-a8f17a3c2510.png?height=601&width=725)\n\n\n\n**Nice to meet you Li, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! It’s a real honor to have you as a guest for my newsletter, which I started a little over a year ago, a few weeks before you gave life to the amazing concept of “passion economy”. To start, can you tell us more about the context in which you published your first article on the subject?**\n\nWorking in venture capital, I had the opportunity to meet many founders building marketplaces in a wide range of verticals. We were particularly interested in how entrepreneurs connect supply and demand in a given market. When I started in venture in 2016, the prevailing model was the “Uber for X,” approach applied to all types of services, whether in education, tourism, or health. The idea was to turn a given service into an on-demand convenience. The consequence of that design is a standardized offering, which commoditized suppliers thus drove prices down.\n\nAs a result, it was difficult for providers to build a career and have upside on these marketplaces. Many individuals stay on these platforms temporarily and don’t view it as a long-term career. And so, a big challenge for these companies is to retain the supply side. But during the last couple of years, I saw a shift where more entrepreneurs addressed markets with more complex or higher-stakes transactions. Their marketplaces served customers looking for more nuanced services and who valued the individuality of the suppliers. The key to the success of these start-ups was richness and diversity of service providers — which I thought was very empowering and aligned to a model of work that I believe will become more prevalent in the future.\n\n**Did you have a specific key moment that proved decisive in the development of your thesis?**\n\nOne of the “aha” moments was a meeting with Amir Nathoo, cofounder and CEO of [Outschool](https://outschool.com/). Outschool is an educational platform that allows teachers to offer live online group classes to kids in K-12. A key element of the platform is that teachers have total freedom in the development of their curriculum, and so you can find a huge range of creative courses, like a class about seasons taught through *Frozen *characters.\n\nWhat stuck with me was that the founder mentioned that Outschool was one of the only ways for their suppliers to earn income flexibility by leveraging their creativity and education. I found it really interesting that the marketplace not only prioritized the needs of the demand side, but also delivered a unique value proposition to the supply side. It was from this meeting that I began to think about the foundations of what became the passion economy and ways to monetize non-commoditized skills.\n\n**Why did you choose the word “passion*”* to illustrate this new economy?**\n\nI chose the term “passion economy” very specifically: passion comes from the latin word “pati,” which means “to suffer”. This is apt because people often confuse passion with happiness — in contrast, I don’t believe being a successful passion economy entrepreneur means being happy all the time. Creators that I’ve spoken to don’t enjoy every moment of what they do; there is a degree of suffering and sacrifice. Passion means continuous effort and work, but feeling that the painful moments are worthwhile because there is a deep-seated sense of fulfillment. I think this is a notion that inspires us and something that we all want in our lives.\n\n**Somehow the passion economy borrows a lot of ideas from the art world, **[**which you seem to be familiar with**](https://li-jin.co/art/)**. Has art influenced your thesis?**\n\nVery likely! What we typically think of as creative industries — art, writing, music — are full of people who are passionate about their work. And in the art world in particular, many people are putting their passion for their craft over financial compensation.\n\nThe biggest commonality is the expression of a person’s imagination and creativity. There is something unique and individual in the products and services you find in the passion economy, whether it’s a video course, a podcast, a newsletter, or other services. Just as a work of art reveals the personality of its creator, these passion economy creations reflect the personality of the people that made them. This is in direct contrast to the “Uber for X” approach, which treats providers as a fungible commodity.\n\n**In your writing on the passion economy, you focus on the supply-side. But I tend to think that passion is equally important to consider on the demand-side. Can we then consider passion as a kind of currency at the center of this new economy?**\n\nEvery successful consumer company has to provide something of value to the consumers at the end of the day — it needs to be an improvement over something that already exists on some dimension. For creator-led offerings, that could be lower cost (because of a different cost structure), greater trust with their consumers, or something else. I wrote about this in a blog post about the links between the passion economy and [disruption theory](https://li.substack.com/p/how-the-passion-economy-will-disrupt). Passion economy models will be most successful in domains where there is an unmet or over-served consumer need.\n\n**I think this is in line with the concept of **[**aspiration economy**](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/veblen-is-wrong-the-new-aspiration-economy-765c3d5456d)** coined by Ana Andjelic, which I find very complementary to your analysis. You’ve also explored how the passion economy enables us to shift to a society in which **[**work is being unbundled from employment**](https://www.atelierventures.co/content/unbundling-work-from-employment)**. What effects do you think we can expect on the identity of individuals?**\n\nWork is still one of the most influential identity markers in our lives. For instance, in tech, there are certain values that are conveyed from the company that employs us; when someone says they work at Google, Facebook, Airbnb, or another company, a certain image comes to mind.\n\nWith the passion economy and the unbundling of work from employment, I imagine a return to a more pre-industrial notion of identity, namely one in which we derive our sense of identity more from what we create, who our customers are, and who our loose association of peers and collaborators are, rather than from a single employer.\n\n**These are ideas that can be found in the software craftsmanship movement too. I have the feeling that the passion economy will keep blurring the lines between the personal and the professional, between private life and public image. What are the main potential risks on the mental health of creators, according to you?**\n\nI think that the personal and professional identities of creators will increasingly merge. This is both a source of fulfillment — that one’s life is one’s work and feels meaningful and is what we choose to do with our time — but it also comes with risks. I recently watched an interview with David Dobrik, where he mentioned that he constantly obsesses over what he’s going to film for his next video on YouTube. As soon as he posts a new video, he is already consumed with thinking about the next one. The prospect of not filming anything interesting is a huge source of anxiety for him. I don’t think this lifestyle is suited for everyone — some people want more balance and separation in their lives.\n\n**If the passion economy becomes a disruptive innovation in Christensen’s sense, then it will have a societal impact that goes far beyond creators. What are the conditions for the passion economy to remain accessible to all and not just become a new “winner-takes-all” system?**\n\nThe key for it to not be “winner-take-all” is that there needs to be heterogeneity in consumer preferences. For example, a newsletter considered by some people as “the best” on a given subject may not suit the expectations and tastes of other readers. If there’s heterogeneous consumer preferences, that implies a long tail of successful creators, with many products/services that are popular among a large number of audience segments.\n\nI would add that an independent creator only needs a relatively small number of customers to make a living. This is the point of my [“100 true fans”](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/) blog, inspired by Kevin Kelly’s concept of [1,000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/): one can be successful with a smaller base of fans, because the internet removes intermediaries and connects creators directly to fans.\n\nFor me, this is the potential of the passion economy I am most excited about: one in which millions of people can participate and earn a living, not just a rarified tier of internet celebrities.\n\n**The first blog post in which you coined the term “passion economy” was a huge success and established you as a thought leader in this new ecosystem. Since then, I imagine that your articles are much more anticipated. Would you say that this has had an impact on your writing?**\n\nI’ve always had a really high bar for my writing. I want to make sure that my writing is worthy of my readers’ interest and attention. Time is our most valuable resource, and every minute spent reading my writing comes at the expense of something else. I always ask myself if what I write offers new insights that will be useful for founders, and am always trying to push forward into something new, interesting, and surprising.\n\n**For me, writing is without a doubt one of the most powerful vectors of serendipity on a lifetime scale. For your part, what were the most memorable events that happened to you following the article you wrote one year ago?**\n\nThe article definitely catalyzed a few interesting things. It led me to meet Adam Davidson, who is a journalist, author, and podcaster (he cofounded NPR’s Planet Money). Earlier this year, he published a book called [*The Passion Economy: the New Rules for Thriving in the Twenty-First Century*](https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Economy-Thriving-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0385353529), which is a more human-centered account of how various individuals are thriving in their careers by leveraging their passions. We’ve become close collaborators. And, in a way, I also jumped into the passion economy myself by founding [Atelier](https://www.atelierventures.co/). I also become more active in creating content: I’m part of the [Everything](https://everything.substack.com/) bundle, and co-host a weekly talk show called [Means of Creation](https://meansofcreation.substack.com/). I’ve also been writing more [in my personal newsletter](https://li.substack.com/) and take more time to paint and create art!\n\n**You actually fit perfectly the definition of a multi-potential person, with highly developed passions that occupy an important place in your life. How do you balance all your various passions with your life and career choices?**\n\nWhen I was a child, my mother told me that time is like a sponge — you can always squeeze more out for what you want to prioritize. That has guided me a lot in my choices. People often ask me how I can have time for all of my projects. I just prioritize and focus my time on what gives me energy rather than what drains it.\n\n**I’ve actually read **[**this advice**](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1131207138418630657)** from Justin Kan in the past and I couldn’t agree more. That being said, I know people who don’t have a real passion in their lives or who don’t even find meaning in what they do. What would you personally recommend them to do in this situation?**\n\nI don’t think that we are born with a certain passion. I believe passion is mostly the result of your education, experiences, and the time you’ve invested in developing various interests. I wouldn’t be as passionate about art had I not studied painting from age 5–18. Even my interest in the passion economy and the future of work is very much influenced by my personal experience as an immigrant, moving from China to the US when I was 6 years old and watching my parents pursue the American Dream. I don’t see a miracle recipe for finding one’s passion other than searching for it — that could be delving into one’s personal history, cultivating your curiosity, or exploring new interests.\n\n**I can’t think of a better way to end this wonderful interview. It was a great pleasure to be able to ask you all these questions about your fascinating journey. So many thanks Li!**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1\\*zBOt4bFsh58E3roVZPLi6A.gif)\n\n## 5 books that touched Li’s life:\n\n*   ***Rebecca* — Daphne du Maurier:** *“Sent me down a rabbit hole of Gothic literature during my teen years.”*\n*   ***Jane Eyre* — Charlotte Brontë:** *“Contains some of the most beautifully romantic passages in the English language.”*\n*   ***The God of Small Things* — Arundhati Roy:** *“Prose that borders poetry.”*\n*   ***How Will You Measure Your Life* — Clay Christensen:** *\"During my first year after college, I lived in New York City and went through a major existential crisis about work and the meaning of my life.

If your DAO wasn’t mentioned, you probably missed [this tweet.](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1407458878246121475?s=20*)*\n\n## What is a DAO?\n\nA DAO is a commitment to share value with a community.\n\nDAOs seek to:\n\n- Provide members with a voice through governance.\n- Flatten hierarchy and create fluid workstreams.\n- Allocate resources to achieve a core mission.\n\nA Telegram group with 10 members and 1 ETH is a DAO.\n\nA DeFi protocol with $1B+ of assets governed on-chain by 10,000+ token holders is a DAO.\n\n**Regardless of size, DAOs look to solve core missions - evolving a group chat into a success-driven community.**\n\n## DAO Landscape\n\nToday, there are more than 100 DAOs managing over $10B in assets.\n\n![DAO Landscape 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5d496d8a-8119-4a79-ad40-fe6a754903b5.jpeg?height=2880&width=5120)\n\n### DAO Operating Systems\n\nThe first chapter of DAOs are the operating systems used to create them.\n\nThese projects offer different templates, frameworks and tools for communities to pool resources and start their first DAO.\n\nThey commonly offer smart contracts and interfaces to facilitate on-chain actions for decentralized communities.\n\n**DAO Operating Systems make it easy for anyone to start a DAO with limited technical skills.**\n\n### Grants DAOs\n\nThe first real use case for DAOs were grants.\n\nCommunities donate funds and use a DAO to vote on how that capital is allocated to various contributors in the form of governance proposals.\n\nGovernance of Grants DAOs was originally conducted through non-transferable shares, meaning participation was largely motivated by social capital over financial returns.\n\n**Grants DAOs show that niche communities are [more nimble](https://molochdao.medium.com/moloch-2019-year-in-review-eb6f53dc035) in capital allocation than formal bodies.** \n\n### Protocol DAOs\n\nProtocol DAOs transition power from a core team into the hands of the community, spawning a new way for projects to issue fungible tokens into the market.\n\nWhereas the first chapter of DAOs featured non-transferable shares, Protocol DAOs were the first to issue transferable ERC20 tokens with a secondary market value.\n\nThese tokens are commonly used to govern protocols, meaning tokenholders have the sole authority to propose, vote on and implement changes to the underlying mechanics of the network.\n\nProjects commonly vote on how to distribute tokens, thus opening the doors to liquidity mining, yield farming, fair launches and everything in between.\n\n**Protocol DAOs provided a framework for any network to issue a token that was (hopefully) owned and operated by its community.**\n\n### Investment DAOs\n\nWith Protocol DAOs bringing new tokens into the world, it only seemed logical that groups band together to invest in them.\n\nAfter a long period of non-profit DAOs, investment clubs flipped the switch for members to focus on generating a return.\n\nWhile these DAOs come with a lot more legal restrictions than a Grants DAO, they showed that any group of individuals could come together to invest larger amounts of capital with low barriers to entry.\n\n**Investment DAOs allow members to pool capital and invest in projects at their earliest stages.**\n\n### Service DAOs\n\nWith so many tokens coming into the world, projects need talent. Service DAOs are talent allocators, using on-chain credentials to funnel and allocate resources from one DAO to another.\n\nService DAOs create decentralized working groups for individuals to work for the open internet - essentially acting as crypto-native talent agencies.\n\nFrom legal to creative, governance to marketing, development to treasury management, Service DAOs create funnels to contract web3 mercenaries. Work is often rewarded with ERC20 tokens - providing ownership over the value created for a network.\n\n**Service DAOs explore the future of work, and what employment looks like in crypto-native world.**\n\n### Social DAOs\n\nWhat does it mean to be a member of a DAO?\n\nIn an industry dominated by speculation, Social DAOs focus on social capital over financial capital. Social DAOs are the natural evolution of group chats, where friends become co-workers. \n\nWhere social media turned everybody into a media company, Social DAOs turn every group chat into a digital business.\n\nThey challenge what it means to be a part of a community and offer ways to lean into becoming a part of a digitally-native tribe.\n\n**Social DAOs show that there is more to crypto than making a quick buck, and that the internet is the best place to meet people with similar interests.**\n\n### Collector DAOs\n\nNFTs. You’ve heard of them - and for a while, you couldn’t ignore them.\n\nOn the back of mainstream adoption, Collector DAOs popped up to collect them.\n\nCurator groups act as the underlying glue behind a specific artist, platform or series to help establish longevity.\n\n**Collector DAOs seek to curate which NFTs have long-term value.**\n\n### Media DAOs\n\nIn an age when information is globally accessible, ownership of the narratives through which they are distributed should be, too.\n\nMedia DAOs give that power back to those who consume the content. \n\nThey break down the way in which writers, streamers, and readers engage with the content they release. Whether it be media mining programs to incentivize contributions or governance over which topics make the front page, Media DAOs turn consumption into a two-way street.\n\n**Media DAOs share an outlet’s open agenda to spread awareness and news.**\n\n## DAO Tools\n\nAcross the board, a suite of tools are acting as the defacto standard for most DAOs today.\n\n*[Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/)* - Multisig wallets commonly used to manage community treasuries.\n\n*[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/)* - Off-chain voting platform for easy token-based governance.\n\n*[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)* - Forum commonly used to discuss governance proposals.\n\n*[CollabLand](https://collab.land/)* - Bots providing token-gated access and tipping to community chat groups.\n\n*[Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/)* - Coordination game to determine which contributors(s) deserve token rewards.\n\n*[Parcel](https://parcel.money/)* - Treasury management to easily track and send payments.\n\n*[SoureCred](https://sourcecred.io/)* - Instance to track community participation and reward active members.\n\n*[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/race)* - Finance creative projects through tokenized crowdfunds.\n\n*[Tally](https://www.withtally.com/)* - Governance dashboard to track on-chain voting history across different protocols.\n\n*[Boardroom](https://app.boardroom.info/)* - Governance hub for tokenholder management to empower key decision making.\n\n*[Sybil](https://sybil.org/#/)* - Create and track on-chain governance delegation.\n\n*[RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg/)* - Reward tokens for completing specific on-chain tasks.\n\nTogether, this stack allows anyone to spin up a treasury, introduce governance, reward key contributions and engage communities in ongoing discussions.\n\nNot bad!\n\n## How DAOs Evolve\n\nDAOs live on a spectrum.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/73d3af5f-c315-420f-b2e5-d6dddbe47ecc.jpeg?height=2880&width=5120)\n\nThe lightest DAOs are social-first with off-chain governance. The goal is to create active discussion and communal belonging - more than to generate a profit.\n\nThe heaviest DAOs have tremendous amounts of capital at stake, requiring on-chain governance to execute and ratify proposals.\n\nWhat we’re currently witnessing is a shift from very heavy protocols to extremely light micro-economies.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1392975646108778498\n\nCommunities are creating social DAOs in real-time, rather than being restricted to on-chain structures to get started.\n\nFor the heavier DAOs, on-chain proposals are creating and empowering lighter, off-chain working groups. This is best highlighted by the recent growth around Grants DAOs, allowing trusted community members to move faster with funds, rather than having to meet quorum to execute simple payments.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/uniswapgrants/status/1407429123664928772?s=20)\n\nAs DAOs gain momentum, it’s common to see [Treasury Diversification proposals](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-ldo-treasury-diversification-part-2/506). These events allow the wider community to contribute directly to a DAO treasury in exchange for its native token(s).\n\nThis shift signals that fundraising can apply to a community-wide treasury, rather than being managed solely by a core team.\n\nOnce runway is secured, DAOs need to figure out how to put it to work. The evolution of working groups and subcommittees is one I’m deeply fascinated by, and something we’re watching play out in real-time.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/alexxzzhang/status/1404536836274393090?s=20)\n\n## DAO Mercenaries\n\nDAOs mature on the back of community-driven services and governance.\n\nAs treasuries grow in size and communities grow in quality, core contributions become more and more important to keep the ball rolling.\n\nThrough [Fire Eyes DAO](https://www.fireeyes.xyz/), I’ve been lucky enough to pass on-chain proposals on protocols like Aave, Balancer, Rocket Pool and Gitcoin.\n\nGovernance will become increasingly more important, and feature a much wider design diamond of possibilities. With this, so will the number of teams working to put capital to work through on-chain proposals.\n\nFrom grants to payroll, token swaps to M&A - expect the next wave of mercenaries to show why web3 governance is a complete paradigm shift. (more on this topic to come in my next post).\n\nVery soon, we could see a world where **DAOs are the new LLCs.**\n\nIt feels inevitable that tokens will eventually replace equity, and with it - so will the legacy legal structures that underpin them.\n\n## Just DAO It\n\nThis post was published in June, 2021.\n\nBelow is a growing list of resources to keep up with DAOs, their growth and the key people to watch.

She is also the author of my all-time favourite newsletter, [*Check Your Pulse*](https://www.checkyourpulse.co/). I had so many questions for her about her excellent taste for curation, her specific approach of knowledge management and her views on the future of the Internet. Just follow the white rabbit at your own pace, I’ll see you through the looking-glass. Here is our conversation. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d752de5f-45e2-409a-b46c-3109c708f776.png?height=478&width=724)\n\n\n**Hi Sari, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time and it’s a real pleasure to have you as a guest for my newsletter. I discovered your work a couple of years ago through the fantastic Check Your Pulse, that you describe as “a tech and startup newsletter designed to make you feel more human”. How did it all start?**\n\nI am a voracious consumer of information. I have always loved to discover new things, take screenshots of everything and fall down Internet rabbit holes… Prior to having a newsletter on Substack, I used to post recaps of what inspired me every week on Instagram. But it’s not a medium that encourages reflection.\n\nAll you do is scroll through an endless feed, so there was no room for reading in-depth articles, let alone thinking about their context. Then I kept the idea of sharing the things that inspired me but switched to a newsletter format. If you go back to the early issues, you’ll notice that it was mostly just curated links from all over the Internet.\n\nI also wanted to add that I was born and raised in Colombia. English is my second language and I had a bit of insecurity around my writing. I never thought of myself as a writer and I’m grateful that the curation work invited me to share some of my own ideas.\n\n**How did the thesis behind Check Your Pulse evolve?**\n\nI have developed this feeling over time that a lot of the tech writing is for the sake of technology. There is this assumption that everything we build with code is progress. But can drones be called progress? Who truly benefits from them? Even for topics like crypto, a lot of the media coverage is not from a human perspective. And yet, the most important part is how these technologies are going to affect our lives, and the nuances around that. So I wanted my newsletter to start conversations about technology that were less intimidating and more accessible because they put humans at the center of the conversation.\n\n**That may explain why I’m a big fan of your curation game! Check Your Pulse is by far the newsletter I click the most links. I believe that taste is the central element in the exercise of curating things. And in my opinion, you have the very best of the Internet. How have you been cultivating it over time?**\n\nFirst of all, thanks for such a great compliment! I share things that resonate with me and it’s always wonderful to know that they resonate with others. I am committed to the idea of respecting readers’ time and I have a very high bar for anything I share. When it comes to curation, I believe that “less is more”. I’m obsessed with the question of what I should remove while most media is focused on what else to add. The traditional business model for writing incentivizes people to share a bunch of stuff, not incredible gems. That’s why it’s so important for me to not be beholden to a schedule. I don’t want to worry about not finding enough things that meet the bar, which would be the case if I was on a weekly cadence. I don’t want that kind of pressure.\n\n**It makes me think of this **[**fantastic presentation**](https://projector.com/story/8fa326cf-ddd7-4ef4-972a-a7430feb8e00)** in which you remind people that it’s OK not to have anything to publish sometimes.**\n\nI’m reminded of the quote that says the job of a journalist is to “write faster than I can think”… unfortunately, even though we’ve made great strides in publishing advancements, the business model of emerging subscription-based media encourages consistent writing and leaves out millions of people that have a lot to share but don’t see themselves as writers — or aren’t going to share things on a weekly basis. But what if the one-off writer had an incentive to share? We need a new business model designed to fund one-off quality writing online. I’m running an experiment soon that explores a potential solution here.\n\n**I can’t wait to learn more about it! I saw that you also entered **[**the $WRITE race on Mirror.xyz**](https://dev.mirror.xyz/vZxxUIeGMQK9NNLcrT0eDYZ6wXhXVr6vTQzztj1DaEA)**. Do you think that this model could be the future of publishing?**\n\nThe team behind Mirror.xyz is building a user-owned alternative to Substack in which publishers and readers have an incentive to grow the platform. The project is still very early. As far as I understand, you earn tokens based on the value that you deliver to the network. Then as the platform grows, so does the value of the token. The comparison with Substack is interesting since it takes 10% of a publication’s revenue and can’t prevent writers from leaving for a cheaper alternative. But if there was a Substack token, then the people who joined years ago would still be incentivized to stay and help the platform grow. I am personally convinced that the fundamental promise of crypto is to be able to share and exchange value in very granular ways with your community — and that is a huge unlock.\n\n**That makes me think of **[**this tweet**](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1308430095460134912)** by Balaji Srinivasan from last year. He said that investing could be the most prevalent skill of the 21st century. And between the thriving crypto ecosystem, the WallStreetBets movement and the current NFT craze, it actually makes total sense.**\n\nIt’s fascinating because I do think that we’re living in a world where everything is financialized. These days, you can purchase anything that is consumable online: a tweet, a piece of digital art, etc. I’m a little bit concerned about this because I think it’s very hard to make money. If you think about the value proposition of these tokens, you know, I would say financial or economic upside is one of them. Then there’s governance and access. But beyond that, there’s an interesting concept of Patronage+ (coined by Jesse Walden) which is just this feeling of supporting a creator, with potential upside. It’s hard to see it as a financial instrument alone — I personally don’t see it. Packy McCormick wrote[ a newsletter](https://www.notboring.co/p/software-is-eating-the-markets) on this phenomenon of Angel Investing and how it’s less about the financial return and more about the social capital that comes with it. And I think something similar happens with cryptos and NFTs.\n\nIt’s all about the status. What does it mean to own it, to have invested in this company? What does it say about me? What does it signal about me? And I think investors have a similar dynamic where they don’t mean, we’ll get rich off of it. Many of them have already. But I think it’s more about the cultural value. When I was growing up in Colombia, I would sometimes come to the U.S. in the summers and I would buy a cool pair of shoes that they didn’t sell in my home country. And I would be excited to go back to school and kind of show off my shoes.\n\nAnd so the equivalent of that dynamic from the physical world now applies online, since posting a picture on Instagram for the whole world to see has a bigger reach than just showing up with a new pair of shoes in my school. And so I think NFT is a little bit of that. If the balance is shifting to digital, then how do I flex my taste online?\n\n**The **[**CryptoPunks**](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)** kind of summarized this with their owners adding the avatars of the NFTs they purchased as their Twitter profile pictures. Same for the **[**laser eyes**](https://decrypt.co/58302/elon-musk-bitcoin-advocates-have-laser-eyes-on-twitter-heres-why)** with the Bitcoin bullish. It’s a kind of statement, a signal that you belong to a cultural movement. I guess these different trends inspired you while building your latest project **[**Startupy**](https://startupy.world/)**. You describe it as what would happen “if Roam, Wikipedia, Substack and Product Hunt had a baby”. How did the idea of Startupy come to you?**\n\nAs I said, I spend a lot of time reading online. And just like everyone, I tend to forget a lot of what I read. Then it’s hard for me to get compound interest on the things that I read if they’re not properly stored for later use. And so for example, I would often meet with a founder who was building a marketplace business. And I was like, oh, you should be reading this thing or that thing. Or like a lot of these things I was reading, I was like, I wish I could share them with you. But even just going back and finding them was really hard.\n\nSo I basically started cultivating my own database or mini Google. Initially, it was this very simple architecture, storing content and companies that I was tracking and making them searchable. And then, it dawned on me one day that this was a fundamentally different information architecture than where we’re used to consuming information. In most places online, we only consume information recreationally. You go on Twitter and yes, there are incredible ideas that are shared. But if you don’t store them for later use, when you’re thinking about it at the right time, it’s hard to actually take action on them or have them actually affect our real world activities or undertakings.\n\nAnd so I kind of started dreaming of kind of like, what would be the ideal way for me to consume this information? I wanted it to be findable. I wanted it to be serendipitous. I wanted it to be associative so that it would take me down these context rich pathways. So for instance, if I’m interested in the future of restaurants, I could start with a podcast episode by Patrick O’Shaughnessy, and then find the guest of that podcast, see what else he’s written, find a company he invested in, understand more about that company, etc. Eventually you start to develop combinatorial creativity, which is how you combine things from another industry and apply them to yours.\n\nAnd I think it’s very hard to do that with the information architectures that exist today. We basically have interruption technologies. We don’t have tools for thought. It’s a cliche term but for me, it’s about how we transition from information being an interruption to information being a tool to reflect.\n\nThe fundamental problem is information abundance (which requires curation), and information structure (which requires a better architecture to consume information). And so Startupy is what I call a community-curated knowledge network. That will enable us to not have to subscribe to one hundred newsletters and have them interrupt our days, but rather find things as we need them. I also want Startupy to inspire us with serendipity, because I’ve always believed that one of the biggest underutilized assets in the world is people’s time spent uninspired\n\n**I can’t help but think of Dumbledore’s **[**Pensieve**](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pensieve)** in Harry Potter (laughs). The only difference is that Startupy is community-curated. Can you tell me more about how it works?**\n\nThe MVP for Startupy was a database I built on Airtable. What I’m developing now is a multiplayer environment. The next step is to onboard people who want to participate in this curator collective. Then, we’ll work together to curate this database over time. My dream for this is to build a digital place the community both works on and is collectively rewarded for.\n\nAnd that’s why the case for user ownership online is so interesting. If you think about Twitter, they rely on people’s creative labor and they just sell advertising on the back of that. But what if you create a win-win situation where the curators are benefiting from their work instead of being exploited? I think that curation has never been given the kind of love, honor and attention that it deserves. After all, curators are a class of creators. And for me, curation is not just about link sharing. It’s not just, hey, here are ten new links this week. It’s about context. What does this specific link tell me about broader cultural or technological trends? What is important about this piece? There is so much value that has been stripped from curators because we call so many things curation. For instance, newsletters with hundreds of links are not the kind of curation that I envision for Startupy.\n\n**Have you started to work with some curators yet?**\n\nThe product is still in development. I think it’ll be ready in a couple of months and we’re going to launch our first curator cohort soon. So the hope is that we start with this cohort model to set the tone and to really cultivate this community. I’m kind of questioning the status quo across a lot of things with this product. And one of the things that we’re trying to do differently lies in the fact that most platforms these days have zero friction to publish or create. Anyone can post on Twitter. Anyone can write on Medium. And so I almost want to flip that on its head and wonder, what is a healthy amount of friction? On Twitter, 90% of tweets are created by 5% of the accounts. Then why don’t we build a product for those 5%? Startupy isn’t designed for people who just want to lurk. We are reimagining a lot of those things from the ground up. The first kind of friction that I need to decide is precisely around *who* is going to curate.\n\n**That’s fascinating! And how do you intend to qualify, select, and somehow… curate curators?**\n\nIt’s funny because you mentioned taste earlier in the conversation. The fact is, we’ve been working on the application process by focusing on identifying good taste. I guess that our definition of what good taste means for us will evolve over time, along with the kind of signals that we’re looking for. So far we’ve been asking questions like, what pieces of writing have changed your life? What is the latest rabbit hole you went under? We’re trying to find people that have a knack for finding and contextualizing non-obvious, thoughtful, nuanced, hidden gems. I’m less interested in Startupy becoming a place where you can see what Ben Thompson has curated, but rather a place where we can breed a new class of curators who have great taste but aren’t necessarily well-known. And so we have to find the best way to strike a balance.\n\n**You mentioned several times the term of “rabbit hole”, which is at the core of the Startupy brand. But isn’t it a kind of contradiction with what you said about respecting people’s time on the Internet?**\n\nFirst of all, it’s a great question! To me, the main difference between wasting your time on the Internet and engaging in a rabbit hole is about whether you’re in a flow state. When I’m on Twitter, I feel entertained, I feel inspired, but my thought process is constantly disrupted. It’s very different from the rabbit holes I want to encourage with Startupy. Let’s take an example I’m very familiar with. So these days, I’ve been thinking a lot about what it means to create a healthy community with strong content moderation. And so the idea is to start your research on Startupy looking for what has been curated around the history of censorship, social networks and moderation. The difference is that I do have this intention in mind, that of answering a question. Then I do want to expose myself to so many different things around this one topic. It’s rather about research with serendipity than entertainment with interruptions. Social platforms that promote viral content, blind engagement and inflammatory information stripped of context haven’t been designed to enhance your reflection. But going down a rabbit hole on a knowledge database that encourages flow state, concentration and the development of new ideas is a healthy approach in my opinion.\n\n**Definitely! I just wanted to play devil’s advocate here (laughs). Since we started the interview, you mentioned several toxic habits like the endless scrolling on social media, our unconscious tolerance for being interrupted and all these uninspired moments we spend online. So I was wondering, what would you recommend for a healthy Internet diet?**\n\nOn the Internet, you’re always encouraged to engage with still more content. But time is a scarce resource, not information. What I’d recommend is to switch from a consumer mindset to a creator mindset. Having projects puts you in a position where you’re not constantly just absorbing other people’s thoughts, but thinking about how to manifest your own. For instance, I switched to Hey for my emails and all the newsletters I follow go directly into a folder that I only open once or twice a week. This way, I’m not interrupted when I work and my inbox is super empty. Also, I set up an auto-reply that says that I’m trying to spend most of my time thinking and not responding to emails, and then that I’m not going to be able to respond super quickly.\n\nIn the era of Clubhouse, we’ve grown accustomed to doing everything immediately because of the instantaneity of such products. But I actually believe that everything on the Internet should be accessible on demand whenever you need it. I don’t want another product that will prevent me from spending time with my family. People shouldn’t have FOMO when they miss a Clubhouse room or have yet to read the newsletter that everyone has been talking about on Twitter. This is the main thesis behind Startupy: capturing the gems and storing them so that they’re available for later use. I believe that most problems online are completely solvable by design. And I’m confident that we’ll see more product designs with digital wellness in mind.\n\n**Speaking about the future of the Internet, I’d like to close this interview with your views on this huge topic. So among all the current trends, what do you think is here to stay for the next decade?**\n\nFirst, I believe that something to not be underestimated is that a bigger part of the value that we generate is going to happen digitally. The number of people that have made a single dollar online is still very minor when you think globally. But that’s going to shift. We would have never thought that teenagers streaming games on Twitch could make a living of it. Or that creators like Jake Butcher would make six-figure revenues by sharing online courses — and more recently selling graphics as NFT. I believe that the young generation will create all kinds of things on the Internet that we cannot even fathom. Then the nature of the job market is going to change dramatically.\n\nThe second part of my answer is about online friendship. The first wave of the Internet was very much about taking your IRL friends to Facebook and connecting online with people you already knew. But that’s such a limited understanding of the potential of the Internet. What’s more interesting is to make friends after meeting online. For instance, we met on Twitter and our ideas resonated with each other. You reached out and eventually we did this interview. And you may live in Paris while I am based in Miami, you definitely have more in common with me than I do with a lot of my friends that I went to school with and grew up with in Colombia. And I believe that tapping into that to help people make friends and create things based on their mutual interests is going to be a fascinating area to watch. The potential for the Internet as a bigger engine of serendipity and friendship is only at the very beginning.\n\nEventually, the most important aspect is how we make sure that more people benefit from all of the wealth and value created online? During the last decade, most of our interactions on the Internet were transactional: a company would do something for us and we would pay for it. Now, that relationship is a lot more complex because the user is not only a consumer but also a creator. For instance, I’m a consumer of Twitter. But since I tweet, I also add value to the network. I’m very excited about what it means to reimagine from first principles what new business models will look like in a world where the lines keep blurring between providers and users, medias and platforms, consumers and creators, etc. The reality (and beauty) of the Internet is much more nuanced and sophisticated, and so the rewards for value creation should be.\n\n**This seems to me to be a perfect conclusion to this interview. Sari, I owe you a big THANK YOU! It was even better than I could have imagined — and yet my expectations were already high (laughs). I’ll be following Startupy very closely and can’t wait to see what you have in store for us.

{"id": "T-Uanzds1FRdOWzw6GaMDWDGnraBHQsKgQLrs-HoQ0s", "title": "Building a new school for the mind — my interview with Anne-Laure Le Cunff", "body": "> **This interview was first published in [Plumes With Attitude](https://plumeswithattitude.substack.com/) ( 🇫🇷 ), my personal newsletter on the benefits of writing, on September, 2020.**\n\n*One year after *[*our first talk*](https://medium.com/@Benjamin_Prune/plumes-with-attitude-1-interview-with-anne-laure-le-cunff-69cedd6f2aac)*, [Anne-Laure](https://twitter.com/anthilemoon) had written more than two hundred articles that brilliantly illustrate how writing can transform one’s life. Her company *[*Ness Labs*](https://nesslabs.com/)* has become an impressive library documenting her many experiments between creativity, productivity and neuroscience. The good news is that you’re all invited to learn more about her journey.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1424/1\\*GcqUIPoP0gA4CBxoq6T25Q.png)\n\n**Hi Anne-Laure and thank you for agreeing to come back for the first anniversary of the newsletter. A year ago, you chose to put writing back at the center of your life, between the creation of your **[**Maker Mind newsletter**](https://nesslabs.com/newsletter)** and almost daily publications for your company blog Ness Labs. So to start, can you tell me more about the benefits this new habit has brought to your life?**\n\nWhen I started in July 2019, I published one article a day during the workweek — taking the weekend off to rest. Since November 2019, when I reached my goal of [100 articles in 100 days](https://nesslabs.com/100-articles-100-days), I have been writing three articles and one newsletter per week. I have seen changes on three levels, starting with an effect on my creativity. It has completely changed the way I produce content. Today, I write as soon as I find an interesting idea to exploit, whereas it used to take me several weeks to research and rework topics. Writing has become a very important tool to develop my ideas and share them. It has also opened the doors to several communities and inspired me to create one of my own. Beyond a newsletter with 20,000 subscribers, Maker Mind now connects more than [600 curious minds](https://nesslabs.com/membership), trying like me to understand how the human brain works. Writing is how all these encounters happened, and how I connected with people I never imagined I would have access to one day. Which brings me to my last point: the many professional opportunities and collaboration requests I have received around themes that I am passionate about.\n\n**I will come back later on to the community aspect of Maker Mind. Before that, I want to know more about the links you do between writing and creativity. Can you explain to me how this synergy between the two materialized for you?**\n\nWhen you have a certain number of articles a week to produce, you can’t count on a whimsical muse to inspire you on demand. So to avoid the blank page syndrome, I had to set up creative systems. The first version was simply to get into the habit of writing down on a mobile app any idea I might have during the day. It’s like planting a seed of creativity every time you hear or read something interesting. And it worked very well for me for several months. Only I felt like I didn’t go far enough after a while: I took each idea separately, so I was leaving a lot of creative opportunities on the table.\n\n**And that’s when you discovered Roam Research!**\n\nExactly. I discovered [Roam](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research) in January 2020 and immediately thought it was the perfect tool to take things to the next level. Beyond allowing you to list your ideas in a linear fashion like a classic note-taking application, Roam proactively helps you connect them together. This principle of generating new and original ideas from the combination of several ideas has a name: [idea sex](https://nesslabs.com/inspiration-to-idea-sex) (or “combinational creativity”). That’s when I realized that my previous creativity system didn’t work as well, and I switched all my notes to Roam.\n\n**I’ve always wanted to try Roam, but I think its apparent complexity intimidated me for a while. Can you explain to me how you use it on a daily basis?**\n\nI know that the concept of combinational creativity may seem intimidating at first sight, but there is really nothing complicated about my use of Roam. First of all, I still jot down all my ideas on the fly in my mobile app when I’m on the go. Then, I set aside some time each day to open Roam and create a page for each idea — which I will detail as much as I can so that I can remember them accurately over the long term. Then I’ll take time to think about the potential links between my new ideas and the ones I’ve already noted. One of Roam’s key features is the ability to create links between all your ideas — which its algorithm can also suggest to you. Not only does it push you to follow interesting thinking trails, but the tool will also lead you to uncover surprising connections you wouldn’t have thought of otherwise. Finally, I also use Roam for what is called [interstitial journaling](https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling). It consists of taking a moment to document your thoughts between tasks. For example, I’ll go to Roam after our conversation and write down everything that came to mind during the interview. It’s basically a continuous [brain dump](https://nesslabs.com/productive-cognitive-load). It allows me to not worry about forgetting random insights when it’s not the priority of the moment, and to be able to come back to these later. So I use Roam as both a tool for creativity and productivity. In fact, it’s by far the tool that has had the most significant impact on my life, both for my professional work and personal well-being.\n\n**Well, I really need to give it a try then (laughs). And so, you’ve written over two hundred articles and about fifty editions of your newsletter in the last year thanks to your creativity system. Then I was wondering how you go about choosing the order in which you’re going to write particular topics. Basically, do you have an editorial schedule defined beforehand that follows a certain logic?**\n\nAbsolutely not. My creative system encourages me to proactively take notes, write and connect ideas every day. Beyond that, I don’t try to control anything else. There’s really an experimental part to it, in the sense that I never know in advance what I’m going to write about — and therefore the order in which I’m going to tackle the ideas in my creativity inbox. Rigid schedules are not my thing. I like to keep the flexibility to let ideas emerge at any time and to be able to follow the trail whenever one of them piques my curiosity.\n\n**That reminds me of your recent publication on **[**the different types of note-taking applications**](https://nesslabs.com/how-to-choose-the-right-note-taking-app)** grouped into three types of approaches: those of the architect, the librarian and the gardener.**\n\nDefinitely. In this case, I have more of a gardener’s approach. There are two classic mistakes I’ve identified when talking to other people about these note-taking tools. The first one is to choose a system that doesn’t fit your creative style. If you have messy style, with ideas that come from all over the place, you don’t need to force yourself to adopt an architect’s approach. And all the more so because there is no system that is superior to another. There’s no problem with not being very orderly in your way of thinking, quite the contrary. In this situation, the gardener’s approach can help you make the most of your creative style. The second mistake is to think that you can’t deviate from the category you are in. Personally, I find myself to be more comfortable in a gardener’s system, but I also have affinities with the librarian’s approach. Depending on the situation, I’ll borrow from one or the other. Sometimes I even ask architects for advice to help me solve a problem that lends itself to it. So there’s nothing absolute: what is so great in this metaphorical classification is that it consists in knowing yourself better, so that you can build a system that is truly yours and can evolve with you.\n\n**I have this feeling that you truly live and experience what you write about. This is as true when you talk about the concepts and practices resulting from your creative system or when you openly share certain vulnerabilities. As if Maker Mind was a very intellectual approach to the diary exercise. So I was wondering: what was the biggest discovery you’ve made about yourself since you resumed writing?**\n\nFirst, you’re right about the experimental aspect of my work. That’s why I called my company Ness Labs: it’s my little lab and Maker Mind is my research diary. To come back to your question, I used to think I found my home in the tech world’s hustle and bustle. But in the past year, I realized that I really enjoyed the research and reflection process as well. I love working in a team, but I rediscovered the pleasure of being alone, digging into complex topics, and connecting ideas. When I was a child, my parents could leave me alone with my nose in the books all afternoon without me moving an inch. Writing somehow reconciled me with my inner bookworm (laughs).\n\n**That’s so nicely put (laughs)! We’ve covered the topics of creativity and productivity, and now I’d like to talk about what I consider the third pillar of Maker Mind: mental health. How has writing impacted this aspect in your life?**\n\nNote-taking and especially interstitial journaling allow me to identify warning signs of burnout. I experienced burnout in the past and the problem is that I could resist for a very long time without breaking down until it was too late. Today, I am able to act upstream by making decisions and adapting new strategies to prevent it from happening again.\n\n**I had just read **[**in your interview with Dan Shipper from Superorganizers**](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-anne-laure-le-cunff-wrote-200)** that burnout was a real starting point in the creation of Maker Mind. And I just wanted to ask you if you felt you had “cracked the code” of your personal balance or if you still felt at risk despite everything you put in place?**\n\nI don’t think it’s possible to “crack the code” like you say. On the other hand, I now have a much healthier relationship with my mental health. In particular, I have learned to accept that there are external stressors over which I have no control. Like many people, the lockdown has been a trying time for me. Even though I have found a system that works, I am no more able than anyone else to thrive without leaving my home for months. Twice this year, I announced to my readers that there would not be a weekly newsletter following difficult personal moments. Taking care of one’s mental health also means listening to oneself and knowing how to reconsider one’s priorities, with the guiding principle: “be kind to yourself”.\n\n**This year is also special in the sense that we have never talked about mental health as much as in 2020. Did the lockdown and all the news around Covid-19 influence your way of writing on the subject?**\n\nI have always talked about “mindful productivity” to put the emphasis on fulfillment rather than only focusing on goals and performance indicators. Among my readers, there are a lot of very ambitious, very passionate people who tend to work a lot. And indeed, this year’s context has made me insist in my articles on the idea that it’s more important than ever to accept that it’s not always possible to be productive, to also learn how to take the time to breathe and to reconcile with the idea of letting go.\n\n**During the confinement, you went further in this respect by creating a \\[paid] community around Maker Mind. What motivated you to go in that direction?**\n\nTo be very transparent with you, I started the community at a time when I was looking to generate recurring revenue with Ness Labs. It’s a healthy business model for the company, aligned with my values and the ones of my readers. It gives them the opportunity to meet each other, help each other, and move forward together in achieving their life goals. For my part, it allows me to focus on creating high value-added content and to get to know my community better.\n\n**Personally, I have the impression that building a community is more difficult to evaluate in terms of time invested than creating content. Since we were talking about burnout earlier, how do you make sure that it doesn’t become a time-consuming activity next to everything you already do with Maker Mind and Ness Labs?**\n\nTo tell the truth, I didn’t have to set any strict rules and there is nothing stressful about running this community. I’m fortunate to be surrounded by very emotionally intelligent members, some of whom have been following me for a while. I participate every week but I don’t have to force myself to do it. In fact, no one expects me to be available 24 hours a day to answer their questions. It’s a very calm community, not in the sense that nothing happens but because everyone respects each other’s time. I am very happy to see the members interact with each other without having to ask for my permission. For example, I think it’s great to see some members organizing working or writing sessions every day.\n\n**Paid communities are becoming more common for content creators to monetize their projects. Do you think it’s become a must to make a living from your writings?**\n\nThere are many counter-examples, with very high quality paid publications without a community component behind them. So I would say… not necessarily. Still, starting a community opens up many opportunities to better understand your audience and their needs. Personally, I’m very happy to have chosen to take Ness Labs in this direction. While I don’t see it as a prerequisite, I tend to encourage content creators to explore this path.\n\n**In addition to having a community to run and your fast pace of publishing, you also went back to school for a Master’s degree in Neuroscience. What was your initial goal and how did it evolve with the development of your activity?**\n\nWhen I started, I really saw the Master’s degree as a personal need. I wanted to study the inner workings of the human brain. In a way, writing about it helped me consolidate my learning. What I studied in class was often the starting point for reflections in my articles. What I didn’t expect was for this personal curiosity to quickly turn into a real business with Ness Labs.\n\n**I’ve learned that your longer-term vision for Ness Labs is actually a school. I guess going back to class must have inspired you in that respect as well. In fact, I feel like the pieces of the puzzle are coming together very quickly, between everything you’ve got on Roam, all the educational content published this year, and a fast-growing paid community. So when you think about it, Ness Labs already looks a lot like a school. What are the priorities you want to develop for the future?**\n\nI’m fascinated by new models of education. I also find that there are a lot of topics that are not covered in a traditional school and that I think should be covered in a traditional school. Today, nothing that is taught in schools is adapted to the level of demand, self-reflection, flexibility, and also stress that the new work models bring about. That’s why I want to create an alternative education model, with a flexible and decentralized system that would allow everyone to enrich their way of thinking, creating and working. Today, there is already a lot of material on Ness Labs and you can actually dig into many subjects on your own. But I want to create a collection of courses that would explore these topics in depth over several weeks. These would cover topics like developing your creativity or managing your mental health at work, all based on neuroscience. This kind of curriculum is the brick that Ness Labs is currently missing and that I want to add to the edifice.\n\n**What are the new educational models that inspire you the most?**\n\nThere is of course Lambda School, which a lot of people have been following closely over the last few years. More recently, I’ve been particularly interested in On Deck, which brings education and community together better than anyone else. It’s a system of cohorts divided into several fellowships for founders, angels, but also writers and podcast hosts. And what is very powerful in this model is all the possible encounters, synergies and collaborations between individuals, cohorts and fellowships. A member of the writing fellowship will be able to help his cohort’s entrepreneurs with content strategy; these entrepreneurs will be able to receive investments from angels from previous cohorts; and so on. I am very curious to see how these community-based educational models will evolve.\n\n**For your part, you’ve already created a lot of educational content that covers a wide range of topics. Is there a particular one you haven’t written about yet that you would like to explore further?**\n\nOne topic I’ve already touched on but I’m very keen to explore further is ideation; where do ideas come from and how do they form in our brains? It’s all the more fascinating because there are several research streams. Some people have a rather analytical approach to ideation, approaching a problem from all angles to develop new ideas. Others have more of an “aha” moment or [shower thoughts](https://nesslabs.com/mind-wandering). I really want to understand what is going on in the brain at this level and to know if there are ways to increase our capacity for ideation. Right now, I am reading a fascinating and accessible [research paper](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.northwestern.edu/dist/a/699/files/2015/11/The-cognitive-neuroscience-of-insight-1jie1hg.pdf) on the subject by John Kounios, a neuroscience researcher. It’s a topic I’m looking forward to writing about.\n\n**And I’m already looking forward to reading it! We’re coming to the end of this new interview that I’ve been waiting for a long time. And what a journey since our first conversation! I’m both admiring and impressed by your evolution and that of Ness Labs. I will continue to follow all this closely, and probably also get into Roam for good (laughs). So thanks again to you Anne-Laure.**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1\\*feAC0AW5qV57-aYtpOroyA.gif)\n\n### 5 concepts worth exploring, according to Anne-Laure:\n\n*   [The Dunning–Kruger effect](https://nesslabs.com/dunning-kruger-effect)\n*   [Thinking in maps](https://nesslabs.com/thinking-in-maps)\n*   [Mind garden](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden)\n*   [The planning fallacy](https://nesslabs.com/planning-fallacy)\n*   [Thinking inside the box](https://nesslabs.com/systematic-inventive-thinking-inside-the-box)\n\n\n### Read my other interviews:\n\n\n- **[Following the right rabbit holes, with Sari Azout](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/VclwDqX-nSxzQTeJnJCTyMkzsvP_IJxwomzUaOYmq1k)**\n- **[Choose your own writing adventure, with Max Nussenbaum](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/9GZm-IGk-oL_OmxsLHl_fEApuZd3a5NkaITLS7jJ3ck)**\n- **[Pioneering the Passion Economy, with Li Jin](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/cKbvFpq0mV_-E0gM4GKmk8w-CYrKZF8ByC1nN2xm07E)**\n", "timestamp": 1624563586, "digest": "GD03ufsBOrDkKjO9psSLro0PEqC64So_t_uC39N20Hs", "contributor": "0xb18501548Eeb4660c2348A75515e2740041999F6"}
{"id": "6CtplLOrHFh18awzbGz3k-jNSAoeWcfVfUlvE5-n0i4", "title": "DAO Landscape", "body": "DAOs have taken center stage.\n\nEver since 14% of the entire ETH supply was locked in [The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)) in early 2016, we’ve spent the last five years distilling what it means to coordinate digital working groups.\n\n**DAOs are internet communities with a shared cap table and bank account.**\n\nMembers work together to create, distribute and capture value relative to a shared mission. Ownership shares economic, social and political components, creating best practices for digital coordination.\n\nIn this post, we’ll break down the DAO landscape and examine the relationship between financial and social capital.\n\n![DAO Landscape Cover](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ed6f1c94-5204-4eca-95d4-804f189f3ed3.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n*The DAOs mentioned in this post are non-comprehensive. I definitely missed some. If your DAO wasn’t mentioned, you probably missed [this tweet.](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1407458878246121475?s=20*)*\n\n## What is a DAO?\n\nA DAO is a commitment to share value with a community.\n\nDAOs seek to:\n\n- Provide members with a voice through governance.\n- Flatten hierarchy and create fluid workstreams.\n- Allocate resources to achieve a core mission.\n\nA Telegram group with 10 members and 1 ETH is a DAO.\n\nA DeFi protocol with $1B+ of assets governed on-chain by 10,000+ token holders is a DAO.\n\n**Regardless of size, DAOs look to solve core missions - evolving a group chat into a success-driven community.**\n\n## DAO Landscape\n\nToday, there are more than 100 DAOs managing over $10B in assets.\n\n![DAO Landscape 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5d496d8a-8119-4a79-ad40-fe6a754903b5.jpeg?height=2880&width=5120)\n\n### DAO Operating Systems\n\nThe first chapter of DAOs are the operating systems used to create them.\n\nThese projects offer different templates, frameworks and tools for communities to pool resources and start their first DAO.\n\nThey commonly offer smart contracts and interfaces to facilitate on-chain actions for decentralized communities.\n\n**DAO Operating Systems make it easy for anyone to start a DAO with limited technical skills.**\n\n### Grants DAOs\n\nThe first real use case for DAOs were grants.\n\nCommunities donate funds and use a DAO to vote on how that capital is allocated to various contributors in the form of governance proposals.\n\nGovernance of Grants DAOs was originally conducted through non-transferable shares, meaning participation was largely motivated by social capital over financial returns.\n\n**Grants DAOs show that niche communities are [more nimble](https://molochdao.medium.com/moloch-2019-year-in-review-eb6f53dc035) in capital allocation than formal bodies.** \n\n### Protocol DAOs\n\nProtocol DAOs transition power from a core team into the hands of the community, spawning a new way for projects to issue fungible tokens into the market.\n\nWhereas the first chapter of DAOs featured non-transferable shares, Protocol DAOs were the first to issue transferable ERC20 tokens with a secondary market value.\n\nThese tokens are commonly used to govern protocols, meaning tokenholders have the sole authority to propose, vote on and implement changes to the underlying mechanics of the network.\n\nProjects commonly vote on how to distribute tokens, thus opening the doors to liquidity mining, yield farming, fair launches and everything in between.\n\n**Protocol DAOs provided a framework for any network to issue a token that was (hopefully) owned and operated by its community.**\n\n### Investment DAOs\n\nWith Protocol DAOs bringing new tokens into the world, it only seemed logical that groups band together to invest in them.\n\nAfter a long period of non-profit DAOs, investment clubs flipped the switch for members to focus on generating a return.\n\nWhile these DAOs come with a lot more legal restrictions than a Grants DAO, they showed that any group of individuals could come together to invest larger amounts of capital with low barriers to entry.\n\n**Investment DAOs allow members to pool capital and invest in projects at their earliest stages.**\n\n### Service DAOs\n\nWith so many tokens coming into the world, projects need talent. Service DAOs are talent allocators, using on-chain credentials to funnel and allocate resources from one DAO to another.\n\nService DAOs create decentralized working groups for individuals to work for the open internet - essentially acting as crypto-native talent agencies.\n\nFrom legal to creative, governance to marketing, development to treasury management, Service DAOs create funnels to contract web3 mercenaries. Work is often rewarded with ERC20 tokens - providing ownership over the value created for a network.\n\n**Service DAOs explore the future of work, and what employment looks like in crypto-native world.**\n\n### Social DAOs\n\nWhat does it mean to be a member of a DAO?\n\nIn an industry dominated by speculation, Social DAOs focus on social capital over financial capital. Social DAOs are the natural evolution of group chats, where friends become co-workers. \n\nWhere social media turned everybody into a media company, Social DAOs turn every group chat into a digital business.\n\nThey challenge what it means to be a part of a community and offer ways to lean into becoming a part of a digitally-native tribe.\n\n**Social DAOs show that there is more to crypto than making a quick buck, and that the internet is the best place to meet people with similar interests.**\n\n### Collector DAOs\n\nNFTs. You’ve heard of them - and for a while, you couldn’t ignore them.\n\nOn the back of mainstream adoption, Collector DAOs popped up to collect them.\n\nCurator groups act as the underlying glue behind a specific artist, platform or series to help establish longevity.\n\n**Collector DAOs seek to curate which NFTs have long-term value.**\n\n### Media DAOs\n\nIn an age when information is globally accessible, ownership of the narratives through which they are distributed should be, too.\n\nMedia DAOs give that power back to those who consume the content. \n\nThey break down the way in which writers, streamers, and readers engage with the content they release. Whether it be media mining programs to incentivize contributions or governance over which topics make the front page, Media DAOs turn consumption into a two-way street.\n\n**Media DAOs share an outlet’s open agenda to spread awareness and news.**\n\n## DAO Tools\n\nAcross the board, a suite of tools are acting as the defacto standard for most DAOs today.\n\n*[Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/)* - Multisig wallets commonly used to manage community treasuries.\n\n*[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/)* - Off-chain voting platform for easy token-based governance.\n\n*[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)* - Forum commonly used to discuss governance proposals.\n\n*[CollabLand](https://collab.land/)* - Bots providing token-gated access and tipping to community chat groups.\n\n*[Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/)* - Coordination game to determine which contributors(s) deserve token rewards.\n\n*[Parcel](https://parcel.money/)* - Treasury management to easily track and send payments.\n\n*[SoureCred](https://sourcecred.io/)* - Instance to track community participation and reward active members.\n\n*[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/race)* - Finance creative projects through tokenized crowdfunds.\n\n*[Tally](https://www.withtally.com/)* - Governance dashboard to track on-chain voting history across different protocols.\n\n*[Boardroom](https://app.boardroom.info/)* - Governance hub for tokenholder management to empower key decision making.\n\n*[Sybil](https://sybil.org/#/)* - Create and track on-chain governance delegation.\n\n*[RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg/)* - Reward tokens for completing specific on-chain tasks.\n\nTogether, this stack allows anyone to spin up a treasury, introduce governance, reward key contributions and engage communities in ongoing discussions.\n\nNot bad!\n\n## How DAOs Evolve\n\nDAOs live on a spectrum.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/73d3af5f-c315-420f-b2e5-d6dddbe47ecc.jpeg?height=2880&width=5120)\n\nThe lightest DAOs are social-first with off-chain governance. The goal is to create active discussion and communal belonging - more than to generate a profit.\n\nThe heaviest DAOs have tremendous amounts of capital at stake, requiring on-chain governance to execute and ratify proposals.\n\nWhat we’re currently witnessing is a shift from very heavy protocols to extremely light micro-economies.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1392975646108778498\n\nCommunities are creating social DAOs in real-time, rather than being restricted to on-chain structures to get started.\n\nFor the heavier DAOs, on-chain proposals are creating and empowering lighter, off-chain working groups. This is best highlighted by the recent growth around Grants DAOs, allowing trusted community members to move faster with funds, rather than having to meet quorum to execute simple payments.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/uniswapgrants/status/1407429123664928772?s=20)\n\nAs DAOs gain momentum, it’s common to see [Treasury Diversification proposals](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-ldo-treasury-diversification-part-2/506). These events allow the wider community to contribute directly to a DAO treasury in exchange for its native token(s).\n\nThis shift signals that fundraising can apply to a community-wide treasury, rather than being managed solely by a core team.\n\nOnce runway is secured, DAOs need to figure out how to put it to work. The evolution of working groups and subcommittees is one I’m deeply fascinated by, and something we’re watching play out in real-time.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/alexxzzhang/status/1404536836274393090?s=20)\n\n## DAO Mercenaries\n\nDAOs mature on the back of community-driven services and governance.\n\nAs treasuries grow in size and communities grow in quality, core contributions become more and more important to keep the ball rolling.\n\nThrough [Fire Eyes DAO](https://www.fireeyes.xyz/), I’ve been lucky enough to pass on-chain proposals on protocols like Aave, Balancer, Rocket Pool and Gitcoin.\n\nGovernance will become increasingly more important, and feature a much wider design diamond of possibilities. With this, so will the number of teams working to put capital to work through on-chain proposals.\n\nFrom grants to payroll, token swaps to M&A - expect the next wave of mercenaries to show why web3 governance is a complete paradigm shift. (more on this topic to come in my next post).\n\nVery soon, we could see a world where **DAOs are the new LLCs.**\n\nIt feels inevitable that tokens will eventually replace equity, and with it - so will the legacy legal structures that underpin them.\n\n## Just DAO It\n\nThis post was published in June, 2021.\n\nBelow is a growing list of resources to keep up with DAOs, their growth and the key people to watch.

The term was first coined by Li Jin in a now famous blog post. Since then, she developed her investment thesis and founded her own venture firm, [Atelier](https://www.atelierventures.co/), to help entrepreneurs build the future of the passion economy. I had the pleasure to have her as a guest for my newsletter. Here is our interview. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7d3957a8-dae1-43c0-927c-a8f17a3c2510.png?height=601&width=725)\n\n\n\n**Nice to meet you Li, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! It’s a real honor to have you as a guest for my newsletter, which I started a little over a year ago, a few weeks before you gave life to the amazing concept of “passion economy”. To start, can you tell us more about the context in which you published your first article on the subject?**\n\nWorking in venture capital, I had the opportunity to meet many founders building marketplaces in a wide range of verticals. We were particularly interested in how entrepreneurs connect supply and demand in a given market. When I started in venture in 2016, the prevailing model was the “Uber for X,” approach applied to all types of services, whether in education, tourism, or health. The idea was to turn a given service into an on-demand convenience. The consequence of that design is a standardized offering, which commoditized suppliers thus drove prices down.\n\nAs a result, it was difficult for providers to build a career and have upside on these marketplaces. Many individuals stay on these platforms temporarily and don’t view it as a long-term career. And so, a big challenge for these companies is to retain the supply side. But during the last couple of years, I saw a shift where more entrepreneurs addressed markets with more complex or higher-stakes transactions. Their marketplaces served customers looking for more nuanced services and who valued the individuality of the suppliers. The key to the success of these start-ups was richness and diversity of service providers — which I thought was very empowering and aligned to a model of work that I believe will become more prevalent in the future.\n\n**Did you have a specific key moment that proved decisive in the development of your thesis?**\n\nOne of the “aha” moments was a meeting with Amir Nathoo, cofounder and CEO of [Outschool](https://outschool.com/). Outschool is an educational platform that allows teachers to offer live online group classes to kids in K-12. A key element of the platform is that teachers have total freedom in the development of their curriculum, and so you can find a huge range of creative courses, like a class about seasons taught through *Frozen *characters.\n\nWhat stuck with me was that the founder mentioned that Outschool was one of the only ways for their suppliers to earn income flexibility by leveraging their creativity and education. I found it really interesting that the marketplace not only prioritized the needs of the demand side, but also delivered a unique value proposition to the supply side. It was from this meeting that I began to think about the foundations of what became the passion economy and ways to monetize non-commoditized skills.\n\n**Why did you choose the word “passion*”* to illustrate this new economy?**\n\nI chose the term “passion economy” very specifically: passion comes from the latin word “pati,” which means “to suffer”. This is apt because people often confuse passion with happiness — in contrast, I don’t believe being a successful passion economy entrepreneur means being happy all the time. Creators that I’ve spoken to don’t enjoy every moment of what they do; there is a degree of suffering and sacrifice. Passion means continuous effort and work, but feeling that the painful moments are worthwhile because there is a deep-seated sense of fulfillment. I think this is a notion that inspires us and something that we all want in our lives.\n\n**Somehow the passion economy borrows a lot of ideas from the art world, **[**which you seem to be familiar with**](https://li-jin.co/art/)**. Has art influenced your thesis?**\n\nVery likely! What we typically think of as creative industries — art, writing, music — are full of people who are passionate about their work. And in the art world in particular, many people are putting their passion for their craft over financial compensation.\n\nThe biggest commonality is the expression of a person’s imagination and creativity. There is something unique and individual in the products and services you find in the passion economy, whether it’s a video course, a podcast, a newsletter, or other services. Just as a work of art reveals the personality of its creator, these passion economy creations reflect the personality of the people that made them. This is in direct contrast to the “Uber for X” approach, which treats providers as a fungible commodity.\n\n**In your writing on the passion economy, you focus on the supply-side. But I tend to think that passion is equally important to consider on the demand-side. Can we then consider passion as a kind of currency at the center of this new economy?**\n\nEvery successful consumer company has to provide something of value to the consumers at the end of the day — it needs to be an improvement over something that already exists on some dimension. For creator-led offerings, that could be lower cost (because of a different cost structure), greater trust with their consumers, or something else. I wrote about this in a blog post about the links between the passion economy and [disruption theory](https://li.substack.com/p/how-the-passion-economy-will-disrupt). Passion economy models will be most successful in domains where there is an unmet or over-served consumer need.\n\n**I think this is in line with the concept of **[**aspiration economy**](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/veblen-is-wrong-the-new-aspiration-economy-765c3d5456d)** coined by Ana Andjelic, which I find very complementary to your analysis. You’ve also explored how the passion economy enables us to shift to a society in which **[**work is being unbundled from employment**](https://www.atelierventures.co/content/unbundling-work-from-employment)**. What effects do you think we can expect on the identity of individuals?**\n\nWork is still one of the most influential identity markers in our lives. For instance, in tech, there are certain values that are conveyed from the company that employs us; when someone says they work at Google, Facebook, Airbnb, or another company, a certain image comes to mind.\n\nWith the passion economy and the unbundling of work from employment, I imagine a return to a more pre-industrial notion of identity, namely one in which we derive our sense of identity more from what we create, who our customers are, and who our loose association of peers and collaborators are, rather than from a single employer.\n\n**These are ideas that can be found in the software craftsmanship movement too. I have the feeling that the passion economy will keep blurring the lines between the personal and the professional, between private life and public image. What are the main potential risks on the mental health of creators, according to you?**\n\nI think that the personal and professional identities of creators will increasingly merge. This is both a source of fulfillment — that one’s life is one’s work and feels meaningful and is what we choose to do with our time — but it also comes with risks. I recently watched an interview with David Dobrik, where he mentioned that he constantly obsesses over what he’s going to film for his next video on YouTube. As soon as he posts a new video, he is already consumed with thinking about the next one. The prospect of not filming anything interesting is a huge source of anxiety for him. I don’t think this lifestyle is suited for everyone — some people want more balance and separation in their lives.\n\n**If the passion economy becomes a disruptive innovation in Christensen’s sense, then it will have a societal impact that goes far beyond creators. What are the conditions for the passion economy to remain accessible to all and not just become a new “winner-takes-all” system?**\n\nThe key for it to not be “winner-take-all” is that there needs to be heterogeneity in consumer preferences. For example, a newsletter considered by some people as “the best” on a given subject may not suit the expectations and tastes of other readers. If there’s heterogeneous consumer preferences, that implies a long tail of successful creators, with many products/services that are popular among a large number of audience segments.\n\nI would add that an independent creator only needs a relatively small number of customers to make a living. This is the point of my [“100 true fans”](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/) blog, inspired by Kevin Kelly’s concept of [1,000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/): one can be successful with a smaller base of fans, because the internet removes intermediaries and connects creators directly to fans.\n\nFor me, this is the potential of the passion economy I am most excited about: one in which millions of people can participate and earn a living, not just a rarified tier of internet celebrities.\n\n**The first blog post in which you coined the term “passion economy” was a huge success and established you as a thought leader in this new ecosystem. Since then, I imagine that your articles are much more anticipated. Would you say that this has had an impact on your writing?**\n\nI’ve always had a really high bar for my writing. I want to make sure that my writing is worthy of my readers’ interest and attention. Time is our most valuable resource, and every minute spent reading my writing comes at the expense of something else. I always ask myself if what I write offers new insights that will be useful for founders, and am always trying to push forward into something new, interesting, and surprising.\n\n**For me, writing is without a doubt one of the most powerful vectors of serendipity on a lifetime scale. For your part, what were the most memorable events that happened to you following the article you wrote one year ago?**\n\nThe article definitely catalyzed a few interesting things. It led me to meet Adam Davidson, who is a journalist, author, and podcaster (he cofounded NPR’s Planet Money). Earlier this year, he published a book called [*The Passion Economy: the New Rules for Thriving in the Twenty-First Century*](https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Economy-Thriving-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0385353529), which is a more human-centered account of how various individuals are thriving in their careers by leveraging their passions. We’ve become close collaborators. And, in a way, I also jumped into the passion economy myself by founding [Atelier](https://www.atelierventures.co/). I also become more active in creating content: I’m part of the [Everything](https://everything.substack.com/) bundle, and co-host a weekly talk show called [Means of Creation](https://meansofcreation.substack.com/). I’ve also been writing more [in my personal newsletter](https://li.substack.com/) and take more time to paint and create art!\n\n**You actually fit perfectly the definition of a multi-potential person, with highly developed passions that occupy an important place in your life. How do you balance all your various passions with your life and career choices?**\n\nWhen I was a child, my mother told me that time is like a sponge — you can always squeeze more out for what you want to prioritize. That has guided me a lot in my choices. People often ask me how I can have time for all of my projects. I just prioritize and focus my time on what gives me energy rather than what drains it.\n\n**I’ve actually read **[**this advice**](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1131207138418630657)** from Justin Kan in the past and I couldn’t agree more. That being said, I know people who don’t have a real passion in their lives or who don’t even find meaning in what they do. What would you personally recommend them to do in this situation?**\n\nI don’t think that we are born with a certain passion. I believe passion is mostly the result of your education, experiences, and the time you’ve invested in developing various interests. I wouldn’t be as passionate about art had I not studied painting from age 5–18. Even my interest in the passion economy and the future of work is very much influenced by my personal experience as an immigrant, moving from China to the US when I was 6 years old and watching my parents pursue the American Dream. I don’t see a miracle recipe for finding one’s passion other than searching for it — that could be delving into one’s personal history, cultivating your curiosity, or exploring new interests.\n\n**I can’t think of a better way to end this wonderful interview. It was a great pleasure to be able to ask you all these questions about your fascinating journey. So many thanks Li!**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1\\*zBOt4bFsh58E3roVZPLi6A.gif)\n\n### 5 books that touched Li’s life:\n\n*   ***Rebecca* — Daphne du Maurier:** *“Sent me down a rabbit hole of Gothic literature during my teen years.”*\n*   ***Jane Eyre* — Charlotte Brontë:** *“Contains some of the most beautifully romantic passages in the English language.”*\n*   ***The God of Small Things* — Arundhati Roy:** *“Prose that borders poetry.”*\n*   ***How Will You Measure Your Life* — Clay Christensen:** *\"During my first year after college, I lived in New York City and went through a major existential crisis about work and the meaning of my life.

This is both a source of fulfillment — that one’s life is one’s work and feels meaningful and is what we choose to do with our time — but it also comes with risks. I recently watched an interview with David Dobrik, where he mentioned that he constantly obsesses over what he’s going to film for his next video on YouTube. As soon as he posts a new video, he is already consumed with thinking about the next one. The prospect of not filming anything interesting is a huge source of anxiety for him. I don’t think this lifestyle is suited for everyone — some people want more balance and separation in their lives.\n\n**If the passion economy becomes a disruptive innovation in Christensen’s sense, then it will have a societal impact that goes far beyond creators. What are the conditions for the passion economy to remain accessible to all and not just become a new “winner-takes-all” system?**\n\nThe key for it to not be “winner-take-all” is that there needs to be heterogeneity in consumer preferences. For example, a newsletter considered by some people as “the best” on a given subject may not suit the expectations and tastes of other readers. If there’s heterogeneous consumer preferences, that implies a long tail of successful creators, with many products/services that are popular among a large number of audience segments.\n\nI would add that an independent creator only needs a relatively small number of customers to make a living. This is the point of my [“100 true fans”](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/) blog, inspired by Kevin Kelly’s concept of [1,000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/): one can be successful with a smaller base of fans, because the internet removes intermediaries and connects creators directly to fans.\n\nFor me, this is the potential of the passion economy I am most excited about: one in which millions of people can participate and earn a living, not just a rarified tier of internet celebrities.\n\n**The first blog post in which you coined the term “passion economy” was a huge success and established you as a thought leader in this new ecosystem. Since then, I imagine that your articles are much more anticipated. Would you say that this has had an impact on your writing?**\n\nI’ve always had a really high bar for my writing. I want to make sure that my writing is worthy of my readers’ interest and attention. Time is our most valuable resource, and every minute spent reading my writing comes at the expense of something else. I always ask myself if what I write offers new insights that will be useful for founders, and am always trying to push forward into something new, interesting, and surprising.\n\n**For me, writing is without a doubt one of the most powerful vectors of serendipity on a lifetime scale. For your part, what were the most memorable events that happened to you following the article you wrote one year ago?**\n\nThe article definitely catalyzed a few interesting things. It led me to meet Adam Davidson, who is a journalist, author, and podcaster (he cofounded NPR’s Planet Money). Earlier this year, he published a book called [*The Passion Economy: the New Rules for Thriving in the Twenty-First Century*](https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Economy-Thriving-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0385353529), which is a more human-centered account of how various individuals are thriving in their careers by leveraging their passions. We’ve become close collaborators. And, in a way, I also jumped into the passion economy myself by founding [Atelier](https://www.atelierventures.co/). I also become more active in creating content: I’m part of the [Everything](https://everything.substack.com/) bundle, and co-host a weekly talk show called [Means of Creation](https://meansofcreation.substack.com/). I’ve also been writing more [in my personal newsletter](https://li.substack.com/) and take more time to paint and create art!\n\n**You actually fit perfectly the definition of a multi-potential person, with highly developed passions that occupy an important place in your life. How do you balance all your various passions with your life and career choices?**\n\nWhen I was a child, my mother told me that time is like a sponge — you can always squeeze more out for what you want to prioritize. That has guided me a lot in my choices. People often ask me how I can have time for all of my projects. I just prioritize and focus my time on what gives me energy rather than what drains it.\n\n**I’ve actually read **[**this advice**](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1131207138418630657)** from Justin Kan in the past and I couldn’t agree more. That being said, I know people who don’t have a real passion in their lives or who don’t even find meaning in what they do. What would you personally recommend them to do in this situation?**\n\nI don’t think that we are born with a certain passion. I believe passion is mostly the result of your education, experiences, and the time you’ve invested in developing various interests. I wouldn’t be as passionate about art had I not studied painting from age 5–18. Even my interest in the passion economy and the future of work is very much influenced by my personal experience as an immigrant, moving from China to the US when I was 6 years old and watching my parents pursue the American Dream. I don’t see a miracle recipe for finding one’s passion other than searching for it — that could be delving into one’s personal history, cultivating your curiosity, or exploring new interests.\n\n**I can’t think of a better way to end this wonderful interview. It was a great pleasure to be able to ask you all these questions about your fascinating journey.

I had a great time talking about the future of writing with such a charismatic polymath.*\n\n*Here is our interview. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1446/1\\*I4a6OzoG6vGyA-\\_-E3BJQg.png)\n\n**Nice to meet you Max, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! Let’s start with your background: you’ve been alternatively a startup operator, a founder and a freelancer in product, design and software engineering. You’ve also been the coauthor of a business book, **[***Oversubscribed***](https://oversubscribed.club/)**. So I was wondering: why writing? And how did it come to your life among so many interests?**\n\nI’ve been interested in writing for as long as I can remember, even before I have conscious memories. I still have stories I wrote when I was in second grade. Then I went to school for writing and I was a creative writing major. I also wrote a musical in college, and later a book of short stories. So I really thought I was going to be a writer.\n\nBut when I graduated, I realized that becoming a full-time writer didn’t necessarily look the way I’d have imagined. The fact is, I didn’t want to work alone and I wanted my job to be as collaborative as possible. So I ended up making a really sort of unexpected jump into startups. I worked in the tech industry and I started a real estate company that had a classic Silicon Valley rise and fall. But writing was still a big part of my life, mainly through side projects.\n\nI also found that a lot of the skills I was drawing on as a founder were, in some way or another, related to writing. A lot of what I was doing was telling stories, whether it was telling our customers the story of our product, selling our vision to investors or crafting the story of our company. Eventually, I was offered the opportunity to join On Deck and build out the Writer Fellowship last year.\n\n**Such a dream job for you! How did this opportunity happen?**\n\nThis actually ties to my practice of writing. I’ve been friends with [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg), the founder of On Deck, for almost a decade. We both started our careers in Detroit and we bonded over writing. We did a little bit of a writing group together and we both attended a book club that was infamous for only lasting one meeting (laughs). We stayed friends over the years and kept in touch through writing online. When he was thinking about launching the Writer Fellowship, he asked if I wanted to be involved and I eventually said yes.\n\nThis perfectly illustrates one of the reasons why I think that ambitious people should write online. Thanks to my writing, Erik was still able to sort of follow my journey from afar. And when he reached out to me, it wasn’t like we had to spend hours catching up on all the stuff that had happened.\n\n**I agree with you: writing creates a special bond with your readers, which can definitely bring serendipity into your life. And I have the feeling that this is exactly what On Deck is about. So let’s talk about it further! I tend to consider On Deck as an elite program since the endgame is to train the next generation of world-class talents in areas like entrepreneurship, angel investing, content creation, along with healthcare and climate. However, you seem committed to the idea of making your programs accessible to all, as initiatives like your **[**Access Fund**](https://www.beondeck.com/post/access-fund)** show it. But beyond that, how do you balance selectivity and diversity?**\n\nWe have two missions that could seem contradictory at first. One is broadening access and believing that talent can come from anywhere. And as you mentioned, the second is to build a community of world-class talent.\n\nSo the first layer of what we’re doing to expand access is to create a global remote-first community — what some people call the “Silicon Valley in the cloud”. Our goal is to move away from the days when you needed to be living in a specific place to be part of a certain community.\n\nThe second angle is about the journey at On Deck. Every program may be competitive, some are definitely harder to get into than others. For instance, the Founder Fellowship is one of the most difficult to get into. But there’s more than one path to join On Deck. Suppose you might want to start a company someday but don’t necessarily have an idea yet. Well, the Writer or Podcaster Fellowships are more accessible programs that will help you start honing and developing your ideas in the public sphere. And since you’ll be an On Deck Fellow for the rest of your life, it’ll likely be easier to join the Founder Fellowship when you’re ready. If your company takes off, you’ll then have the opportunity to send your employees into other programs such as the First 50 or the Chief of Staff Fellowships.\n\nWhen selecting our future fellows among applicants, we’re asking ourselves two things. First, can we help this person succeed according to their own goals? Second, would this person be a great community member according to our [guiding values](https://www.beondeck.com/guiding-values)? Beyond the programs, On Deck is about giving back, whether it’s with time, knowledge or support. This is why community is a core part of what we’re building.\n\n**I love this “choose your own adventure” approach between the different programs! Can you tell me more about how the different Fellowships communicate with each other?**\n\nWe’re very intentional about making sure that every fellowship has a connection to the others so that they overall make the whole network stronger. Our vision has always been about enabling entrepreneurship. And we view entrepreneurship as something that’s defined much more broadly than this very narrow slice of Silicon Valley that too many people often focus on.\n\nWe tend to forget that writers and podcasters do build products, connect with an audience and create communities. They’re entrepreneurs too! Having a successful writing practice actually involves a lot of skills other than just putting words together. Beyond writing, you need to understand the basics of growth, branding and distribution for instance. And I think it’s much more stimulating to learn all these things within a community of peers than on your own. This is a big part of the thesis behind the Writer Fellowship.\n\nAlso, we are building *one* global community, not just siloed fellowships. And so we do a number of things to enable the fellows from different programs to interact. In February, we’ll have our first ever Global Build Weekend. The goal is to make people from different fellowships collaborate on teams. For instance, I’m looking forward to seeing the next cohort of writers learn the fundamentals of visual branding from the design fellows. In return, they will have the opportunity to teach them some storytelling and copywriting techniques.\n\n**I assume that a program such as the Writer Fellowship must be very tied to your own personality. How did you bring it to the curriculum?**\n\nThat’s a great question! The Writer Fellowship was basically the first program launched after the Founder Fellowship. So I’ve helped a lot of the other program directors who have been launching new fellowships after me.\n\nOne of the things I’d really emphasize is that your program just inevitably takes on your own personality. When your product is an interactive experience within a community, there’s such a direct emotional connection between you and the “customers”. As program directors, we are lucky to have a lot of freedom to shape our curriculum as we wish. And my personal belief is that it’s all about the small things, from the music I choose when introducing a speaker to the dumb jokes I make in my presentations.\n\nOur approach is very bottom-up and not “one size fits all”. It’s not a ten-step writing course where everyone has to do the exact same things in the exact same order. You don’t have to write a specific essay during the program or anything like that. We aim at independent and entrepreneurial people who already have specific goals and ambitions. And we want to be in a position where we have a broad curriculum that can support all of that.\n\n**Plus, having a “one size fits all” program would result in growing an army of clones writing about the same things with the same style. Can you tell me more about how you ensure to adapt to each person’s personality and authenticity?**\n\nThe truth is, a big part of the program is about psychology. Like most creators, our fellows face common issues such as procrastination, lack of motivation, imposter syndrome or being scared to show their work publicly. Some of them don’t really need to be taught how to write as they are already great at this, even though there’s always room for improvement. Their most urgent need is support, so that they can get over their fears and have the courage to write about that topic that scares them.\n\nI like to draw the comparison with the Founder Fellowship, as it’s very uncommon for an entrepreneur to start a company and then the startup fails because they just procrastinate and don’t get any work done. But that’s comparatively a very common failure mode among creators, even for experienced writers. A huge part of what we’re doing at On Deck is to create a comfortable environment for people to do what they’re good at.\n\nWe also want the program to be a really exploratory space. The fact that we’re not pushing everyone towards one defined outcome is actually a great opportunity to explore. I love nothing more than seeing someone who comes into the program to develop their blog, let’s say about the great economic competition between the US and China, and eventually decides to start an essay about their experience raising a family after seeing some other fellows writing very personal stuff. It doesn’t mean they’re going to stop writing about economics, but it’s a way to be able to stretch their wings and kind of get their creative juices going.\n\n**At the moment, the curriculum is mainly designed for people who are building an audience. But I guess that you could extend it to a lot of areas such as publishing, screenwriting, journalism, or even music. How would you personally want to see the Writer Fellowship evolve?**\n\nIt’s definitely something that we think about. The good news is that we’ve attracted people working on several of these areas among our fellows. It’s very likely that within a year or two we’ll have dedicated programs for some of these topics.\n\nThe only thing is that we want to create programs that can legitimately help a lot of people succeed. I’ll take an example from my background as an aspiring fiction writer to illustrate what we wouldn’t do. So I’ve taken a lot of writing workshops in my life. Last summer, I was attending one in New York. Everyone in this workshop was trying to become a novelist. But when I looked around, I couldn’t help but think that no one here was ever going to be a published author. I’m not making any judgments but I’ve had the feeling that what these workshops are really selling is the opportunity to believe in the dream for a few hours a week.\n\nSo, would we ever start an On Deck fellowship to help people try to get a publishing deal? Well, almost certainly not since publishing is kind of a dying industry. Actually, one of the best ways to get published these days is to grow an audience and then leverage that into a book deal. But having a program focused on succeeding in traditional publishing would be like selling a pipe dream that the vast majority of people couldn’t achieve. It would be unethical taking people’s money knowing that the vast majority of them are never going to get there.\n\nOne interesting fact about our fellows is that they haven’t joined On Deck because they think that we’ll help them build a paid publication that will provide them 100% of their income. Rather, they see the fellowship as an opportunity to explore, to supercharge their career by writing about the topics they’re interested in, to connect with a broader network to boost their personal brand, and sometimes to make some money on the side. But those are all very achievable goals we can help them with.\n\n**That’s a very honest approach. I was simply curious about this possible evolution when I’ve noticed that you have someone in the first cohort who writes poetry.**\n\nYou’re referencing [Alysia Harris](http://alysiaharris.com/), a fellow who’s an award-winning poet and an incredible artist. She helped us learn a fantastic lesson during the first cohort. The vast majority of people in the program are primarily writing nonfiction. Yet we had several creative workshops, one or two about poetry, and what we actually realized was that even if you’re primarily writing nonfiction, you can get a ton of value out of doing a poetry workshop. You’re probably not going to just start being a poet. But they can be a great way to think more creatively and kind of get out of your rut. And the responses we got to these creative workshops have been very enthusiastic!\n\n**You’re preaching to the converted (laughs). I’m personally convinced that diversifying what you read and write on is key to find and sharpen your own style. Your ideas made me think of **[**another interview I had with Li Jin**](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/cKbvFpq0mV_-E0gM4GKmk8w-CYrKZF8ByC1nN2xm07E)** last October. **[**Her thesis**](https://www.atelierventures.co/thesis)** on the passion economy is essential to figure out what’s to come for creators. So I was wondering: how do you envision the future of writing?**\n\nI think we’re at a really interesting inflection point for writing. While many of the traditional industries and mediums are suffering, people read and write today more than ever before. This is really exciting, with both a lot of opportunity and peril.\n\nFirst, I think that people are too often too quick to view writing or other forms of creation with a binary viewpoint: either they’re trying to make it a full-time job or it’ll just be a hobby. But there’s a lot of space in between. For instance, I know someone who works in grocery logistics and writes a blog about the industry, which helped him get better career opportunities that he couldn’t have had otherwise.\n\nAlso, I’m a huge believer in Li’s approach of the passion economy. But like most things on the Internet, I think it’s going to end up forming a power law distribution. Substack is a great opportunity for independent writers, yet most people are never going to be able to support themselves entirely through a paid publication. I believe that many writers will follow the trajectory a lot of musicians have taken. The latter have started to think of themselves as products and monetized features like live touring, merchandising, private events, crowdfunding, etc. What I’d advise writers is to take a holistic view and figure out how they can bundle or unbundle what they have to offer. So the question is not about whether going full-time but about having multiple sources of income.\n\nIn some ways, that can be a depressing vision when you think that there was a much larger group of people making a living as full-time writers in 1960 than there is now. But let’s not forget that these people were pretty much all white men who came from elite universities.\n\n**And this is a very important point. But the new platforms have yet to prove that they can reverse this situation. To end up on a more personal touch: what are your writing projects right now?**\n\nI write a weekly email newsletter called [My Super Secret Diary](http://mysupersecretdiary.com/). I present it as a publication about “startups, literature, philosophy, American history, sex & drugs, and how to be alive,” but it’s really just about whatever I feel like writing about. It keeps me practicing and sharing my thoughts with what I like to call my “minimum viable audience”. I’m positive that it won’t be my only writing project for long, but for now running the On Deck Writer Fellowship is a pretty busy dream job (laughs).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*efXaixTZEeM7BIhHS5Y7eQ.gif)\n\n### **5 resources on writing curated by Max:**\n\n*   [**George Orwell’s Six Rules for Writing:**](https://infusion.media/blog/george-orwells-six-rules-for-writing/) “Classic tips from a master from his essay *Politics and the English Language*”.\n*   [**What I Did Not Learn About Writing in School, by Eugene Wan:**](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-did-not-learn-about-writing-in-school/) “A bunch of excellent tips, including some great advice on figuring out what to write about — *you don’t find your niche; your niche finds you*.”\n*   [***On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft*, by Stephen King:**](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816) “I’m not even really much of a Stephen King fan, but this is one of the best books about writing ever written.”\n*   [**Five Short Stories by Lydia Davis:**](https://fivedials.com/fiction/five-short-stories/) “These are works of (very) short fiction, not articles “about” writing, but Lydia Davis is a master of the craft and you’ll learn a ton about what’s possible from reading her.”\n*   [**Julian Shapiro’s Writing Handbook**](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro)**:** “It’s amazing that one person can write so many useful guides about so many different topics, but somehow Julian Shapiro’s done it.”\n\n\n### Read my other interviews:\n\n\n- **[Following the right rabbit holes, with Sari Azout](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/VclwDqX-nSxzQTeJnJCTyMkzsvP_IJxwomzUaOYmq1k)**\n- **[Pioneering the Passion Economy, with Li Jin](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/cKbvFpq0mV_-E0gM4GKmk8w-CYrKZF8ByC1nN2xm07E)**\n- **[Building a New School for the Mind, with Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/edit/GD03ufsBOrDkKjO9psSLro0PEqC64So_t_uC39N20Hs)**\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1624564190, "digest": "9GZm-IGk-oL_OmxsLHl_fEApuZd3a5NkaITLS7jJ3ck", "contributor": "0xb18501548Eeb4660c2348A75515e2740041999F6"}

And we view entrepreneurship as something that’s defined much more broadly than this very narrow slice of Silicon Valley that too many people often focus on.\n\nWe tend to forget that writers and podcasters do build products, connect with an audience and create communities. They’re entrepreneurs too! Having a successful writing practice actually involves a lot of skills other than just putting words together. Beyond writing, you need to understand the basics of growth, branding and distribution for instance. And I think it’s much more stimulating to learn all these things within a community of peers than on your own. This is a big part of the thesis behind the Writer Fellowship.\n\nAlso, we are building *one* global community, not just siloed fellowships. And so we do a number of things to enable the fellows from different programs to interact. In February, we’ll have our first ever Global Build Weekend. The goal is to make people from different fellowships collaborate on teams. For instance, I’m looking forward to seeing the next cohort of writers learn the fundamentals of visual branding from the design fellows. In return, they will have the opportunity to teach them some storytelling and copywriting techniques.\n\n**I assume that a program such as the Writer Fellowship must be very tied to your own personality. How did you bring it to the curriculum?**\n\nThat’s a great question! The Writer Fellowship was basically the first program launched after the Founder Fellowship. So I’ve helped a lot of the other program directors who have been launching new fellowships after me.\n\nOne of the things I’d really emphasize is that your program just inevitably takes on your own personality. When your product is an interactive experience within a community, there’s such a direct emotional connection between you and the “customers”. As program directors, we are lucky to have a lot of freedom to shape our curriculum as we wish. And my personal belief is that it’s all about the small things, from the music I choose when introducing a speaker to the dumb jokes I make in my presentations.\n\nOur approach is very bottom-up and not “one size fits all”. It’s not a ten-step writing course where everyone has to do the exact same things in the exact same order. You don’t have to write a specific essay during the program or anything like that. We aim at independent and entrepreneurial people who already have specific goals and ambitions. And we want to be in a position where we have a broad curriculum that can support all of that.\n\n**Plus, having a “one size fits all” program would result in growing an army of clones writing about the same things with the same style. Can you tell me more about how you ensure to adapt to each person’s personality and authenticity?**\n\nThe truth is, a big part of the program is about psychology. Like most creators, our fellows face common issues such as procrastination, lack of motivation, imposter syndrome or being scared to show their work publicly. Some of them don’t really need to be taught how to write as they are already great at this, even though there’s always room for improvement. Their most urgent need is support, so that they can get over their fears and have the courage to write about that topic that scares them.\n\nI like to draw the comparison with the Founder Fellowship, as it’s very uncommon for an entrepreneur to start a company and then the startup fails because they just procrastinate and don’t get any work done. But that’s comparatively a very common failure mode among creators, even for experienced writers. A huge part of what we’re doing at On Deck is to create a comfortable environment for people to do what they’re good at.\n\nWe also want the program to be a really exploratory space. The fact that we’re not pushing everyone towards one defined outcome is actually a great opportunity to explore. I love nothing more than seeing someone who comes into the program to develop their blog, let’s say about the great economic competition between the US and China, and eventually decides to start an essay about their experience raising a family after seeing some other fellows writing very personal stuff. It doesn’t mean they’re going to stop writing about economics, but it’s a way to be able to stretch their wings and kind of get their creative juices going.\n\n**At the moment, the curriculum is mainly designed for people who are building an audience. But I guess that you could extend it to a lot of areas such as publishing, screenwriting, journalism, or even music. How would you personally want to see the Writer Fellowship evolve?**\n\nIt’s definitely something that we think about. The good news is that we’ve attracted people working on several of these areas among our fellows. It’s very likely that within a year or two we’ll have dedicated programs for some of these topics.\n\nThe only thing is that we want to create programs that can legitimately help a lot of people succeed. I’ll take an example from my background as an aspiring fiction writer to illustrate what we wouldn’t do. So I’ve taken a lot of writing workshops in my life. Last summer, I was attending one in New York. Everyone in this workshop was trying to become a novelist. But when I looked around, I couldn’t help but think that no one here was ever going to be a published author. I’m not making any judgments but I’ve had the feeling that what these workshops are really selling is the opportunity to believe in the dream for a few hours a week.\n\nSo, would we ever start an On Deck fellowship to help people try to get a publishing deal? Well, almost certainly not since publishing is kind of a dying industry. Actually, one of the best ways to get published these days is to grow an audience and then leverage that into a book deal. But having a program focused on succeeding in traditional publishing would be like selling a pipe dream that the vast majority of people couldn’t achieve. It would be unethical taking people’s money knowing that the vast majority of them are never going to get there.\n\nOne interesting fact about our fellows is that they haven’t joined On Deck because they think that we’ll help them build a paid publication that will provide them 100% of their income. Rather, they see the fellowship as an opportunity to explore, to supercharge their career by writing about the topics they’re interested in, to connect with a broader network to boost their personal brand, and sometimes to make some money on the side. But those are all very achievable goals we can help them with.\n\n**That’s a very honest approach. I was simply curious about this possible evolution when I’ve noticed that you have someone in the first cohort who writes poetry.**\n\nYou’re referencing [Alysia Harris](http://alysiaharris.com/), a fellow who’s an award-winning poet and an incredible artist. She helped us learn a fantastic lesson during the first cohort. The vast majority of people in the program are primarily writing nonfiction. Yet we had several creative workshops, one or two about poetry, and what we actually realized was that even if you’re primarily writing nonfiction, you can get a ton of value out of doing a poetry workshop. You’re probably not going to just start being a poet. But they can be a great way to think more creatively and kind of get out of your rut. And the responses we got to these creative workshops have been very enthusiastic!\n\n**You’re preaching to the converted (laughs). I’m personally convinced that diversifying what you read and write on is key to find and sharpen your own style. Your ideas made me think of **[**another interview I had with Li Jin**](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/cKbvFpq0mV_-E0gM4GKmk8w-CYrKZF8ByC1nN2xm07E)** last October. **[**Her thesis**](https://www.atelierventures.co/thesis)** on the passion economy is essential to figure out what’s to come for creators. So I was wondering: how do you envision the future of writing?**\n\nI think we’re at a really interesting inflection point for writing. While many of the traditional industries and mediums are suffering, people read and write today more than ever before. This is really exciting, with both a lot of opportunity and peril.\n\nFirst, I think that people are too often too quick to view writing or other forms of creation with a binary viewpoint: either they’re trying to make it a full-time job or it’ll just be a hobby. But there’s a lot of space in between. For instance, I know someone who works in grocery logistics and writes a blog about the industry, which helped him get better career opportunities that he couldn’t have had otherwise.\n\nAlso, I’m a huge believer in Li’s approach of the passion economy. But like most things on the Internet, I think it’s going to end up forming a power law distribution. Substack is a great opportunity for independent writers, yet most people are never going to be able to support themselves entirely through a paid publication. I believe that many writers will follow the trajectory a lot of musicians have taken. The latter have started to think of themselves as products and monetized features like live touring, merchandising, private events, crowdfunding, etc. What I’d advise writers is to take a holistic view and figure out how they can bundle or unbundle what they have to offer. So the question is not about whether going full-time but about having multiple sources of income.\n\nIn some ways, that can be a depressing vision when you think that there was a much larger group of people making a living as full-time writers in 1960 than there is now. But let’s not forget that these people were pretty much all white men who came from elite universities.\n\n**And this is a very important point. But the new platforms have yet to prove that they can reverse this situation. To end up on a more personal touch: what are your writing projects right now?**\n\nI write a weekly email newsletter called [My Super Secret Diary](http://mysupersecretdiary.com/). I present it as a publication about “startups, literature, philosophy, American history, sex & drugs, and how to be alive,” but it’s really just about whatever I feel like writing about. It keeps me practicing and sharing my thoughts with what I like to call my “minimum viable audience”. I’m positive that it won’t be my only writing project for long, but for now running the On Deck Writer Fellowship is a pretty busy dream job (laughs).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*efXaixTZEeM7BIhHS5Y7eQ.gif)\n\n### **5 resources on writing curated by Max:**\n\n*   [**George Orwell’s Six Rules for Writing:**](https://infusion.media/blog/george-orwells-six-rules-for-writing/) “Classic tips from a master from his essay *Politics and the English Language*”.\n*   [**What I Did Not Learn About Writing in School, by Eugene Wan:**](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-did-not-learn-about-writing-in-school/) “A bunch of excellent tips, including some great advice on figuring out what to write about — *you don’t find your niche; your niche finds you*.”\n*   [***On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft*, by Stephen King:**](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816) “I’m not even really much of a Stephen King fan, but this is one of the best books about writing ever written.”\n*   [**Five Short Stories by Lydia Davis:**](https://fivedials.com/fiction/five-short-stories/) “These are works of (very) short fiction, not articles “about” writing, but Lydia Davis is a master of the craft and you’ll learn a ton about what’s possible from reading her.”\n*   [**Julian Shapiro’s Writing Handbook**](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro)**:** “It’s amazing that one person can write so many useful guides about so many different topics, but somehow Julian Shapiro’s done it.”\n\n\n### Read my other interviews:\n\n\n- **[Following the right rabbit holes, with Sari Azout](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/VclwDqX-nSxzQTeJnJCTyMkzsvP_IJxwomzUaOYmq1k)**\n- **[Pioneering the Passion Economy, with Li Jin](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/cKbvFpq0mV_-E0gM4GKmk8w-CYrKZF8ByC1nN2xm07E)**\n- **[Building a New School for the Mind, with Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/edit/GD03ufsBOrDkKjO9psSLro0PEqC64So_t_uC39N20Hs)**\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1624564059, "digest": "9GZm-IGk-oL_OmxsLHl_fEApuZd3a5NkaITLS7jJ3ck", "contributor": "0xb18501548Eeb4660c2348A75515e2740041999F6"}

She is also the author of my all-time favourite newsletter, [*Check Your Pulse*](https://www.checkyourpulse.co/). I had so many questions for her about her excellent taste for curation, her specific approach of knowledge management and her views on the future of the Internet. Just follow the white rabbit at your own pace, I’ll see you through the looking-glass. Here is our conversation. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d752de5f-45e2-409a-b46c-3109c708f776.png?height=478&width=724)\n\n\n**Hi Sari, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time and it’s a real pleasure to have you as a guest for my newsletter. I discovered your work a couple of years ago through the fantastic Check Your Pulse, that you describe as “a tech and startup newsletter designed to make you feel more human”. How did it all start?**\n\nI am a voracious consumer of information. I have always loved to discover new things, take screenshots of everything and fall down Internet rabbit holes… Prior to having a newsletter on Substack, I used to post recaps of what inspired me every week on Instagram. But it’s not a medium that encourages reflection.\n\nAll you do is scroll through an endless feed, so there was no room for reading in-depth articles, let alone thinking about their context. Then I kept the idea of sharing the things that inspired me but switched to a newsletter format. If you go back to the early issues, you’ll notice that it was mostly just curated links from all over the Internet.\n\nI also wanted to add that I was born and raised in Colombia. English is my second language and I had a bit of insecurity around my writing. I never thought of myself as a writer and I’m grateful that the curation work invited me to share some of my own ideas.\n\n**How did the thesis behind Check Your Pulse evolve?**\n\nI have developed this feeling over time that a lot of the tech writing is for the sake of technology. There is this assumption that everything we build with code is progress. But can drones be called progress? Who truly benefits from them? Even for topics like crypto, a lot of the media coverage is not from a human perspective. And yet, the most important part is how these technologies are going to affect our lives, and the nuances around that. So I wanted my newsletter to start conversations about technology that were less intimidating and more accessible because they put humans at the center of the conversation.\n\n**That may explain why I’m a big fan of your curation game! Check Your Pulse is by far the newsletter I click the most links. I believe that taste is the central element in the exercise of curating things. And in my opinion, you have the very best of the Internet. How have you been cultivating it over time?**\n\nFirst of all, thanks for such a great compliment! I share things that resonate with me and it’s always wonderful to know that they resonate with others. I am committed to the idea of respecting readers’ time and I have a very high bar for anything I share. When it comes to curation, I believe that “less is more”. I’m obsessed with the question of what I should remove while most media is focused on what else to add. The traditional business model for writing incentivizes people to share a bunch of stuff, not incredible gems. That’s why it’s so important for me to not be beholden to a schedule. I don’t want to worry about not finding enough things that meet the bar, which would be the case if I was on a weekly cadence. I don’t want that kind of pressure.\n\n**It makes me think of this **[**fantastic presentation**](https://projector.com/story/8fa326cf-ddd7-4ef4-972a-a7430feb8e00)** in which you remind people that it’s OK not to have anything to publish sometimes.**\n\nI’m reminded of the quote that says the job of a journalist is to “write faster than I can think”… unfortunately, even though we’ve made great strides in publishing advancements, the business model of emerging subscription-based media encourages consistent writing and leaves out millions of people that have a lot to share but don’t see themselves as writers — or aren’t going to share things on a weekly basis. But what if the one-off writer had an incentive to share? We need a new business model designed to fund one-off quality writing online. I’m running an experiment soon that explores a potential solution here.\n\n**I can’t wait to learn more about it! I saw that you also entered **[**the $WRITE race on Mirror.xyz**](https://dev.mirror.xyz/vZxxUIeGMQK9NNLcrT0eDYZ6wXhXVr6vTQzztj1DaEA)**. Do you think that this model could be the future of publishing?**\n\nThe team behind Mirror.xyz is building a user-owned alternative to Substack in which publishers and readers have an incentive to grow the platform. The project is still very early. As far as I understand, you earn tokens based on the value that you deliver to the network. Then as the platform grows, so does the value of the token. The comparison with Substack is interesting since it takes 10% of a publication’s revenue and can’t prevent writers from leaving for a cheaper alternative. But if there was a Substack token, then the people who joined years ago would still be incentivized to stay and help the platform grow. I am personally convinced that the fundamental promise of crypto is to be able to share and exchange value in very granular ways with your community — and that is a huge unlock.\n\n**That makes me think of **[**this tweet**](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1308430095460134912)** by Balaji Srinivasan from last year. He said that investing could be the most prevalent skill of the 21st century. And between the thriving crypto ecosystem, the WallStreetBets movement and the current NFT craze, it actually makes total sense.**\n\nIt’s fascinating because I do think that we’re living in a world where everything is financialized. These days, you can purchase anything that is consumable online: a tweet, a piece of digital art, etc. I’m a little bit concerned about this because I think it’s very hard to make money. If you think about the value proposition of these tokens, you know, I would say financial or economic upside is one of them. Then there’s governance and access. But beyond that, there’s an interesting concept of Patronage+ (coined by Jesse Walden) which is just this feeling of supporting a creator, with potential upside. It’s hard to see it as a financial instrument alone — I personally don’t see it. Packy McCormick wrote[ a newsletter](https://www.notboring.co/p/software-is-eating-the-markets) on this phenomenon of Angel Investing and how it’s less about the financial return and more about the social capital that comes with it. And I think something similar happens with cryptos and NFTs.\n\nIt’s all about the status. What does it mean to own it, to have invested in this company? What does it say about me? What does it signal about me? And I think investors have a similar dynamic where they don’t mean, we’ll get rich off of it. Many of them have already. But I think it’s more about the cultural value. When I was growing up in Colombia, I would sometimes come to the U.S. in the summers and I would buy a cool pair of shoes that they didn’t sell in my home country. And I would be excited to go back to school and kind of show off my shoes.\n\nAnd so the equivalent of that dynamic from the physical world now applies online, since posting a picture on Instagram for the whole world to see has a bigger reach than just showing up with a new pair of shoes in my school. And so I think NFT is a little bit of that. If the balance is shifting to digital, then how do I flex my taste online?\n\n**The **[**CryptoPunks**](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)** kind of summarized this with their owners adding the avatars of the NFTs they purchased as their Twitter profile pictures. Same for the **[**laser eyes**](https://decrypt.co/58302/elon-musk-bitcoin-advocates-have-laser-eyes-on-twitter-heres-why)** with the Bitcoin bullish. It’s a kind of statement, a signal that you belong to a cultural movement. I guess these different trends inspired you while building your latest project **[**Startupy**](https://startupy.world/)**. You describe it as what would happen “if Roam, Wikipedia, Substack and Product Hunt had a baby”. How did the idea of Startupy come to you?**\n\nAs I said, I spend a lot of time reading online. And just like everyone, I tend to forget a lot of what I read. Then it’s hard for me to get compound interest on the things that I read if they’re not properly stored for later use. And so for example, I would often meet with a founder who was building a marketplace business. And I was like, oh, you should be reading this thing or that thing. Or like a lot of these things I was reading, I was like, I wish I could share them with you. But even just going back and finding them was really hard.\n\nSo I basically started cultivating my own database or mini Google. Initially, it was this very simple architecture, storing content and companies that I was tracking and making them searchable. And then, it dawned on me one day that this was a fundamentally different information architecture than where we’re used to consuming information. In most places online, we only consume information recreationally. You go on Twitter and yes, there are incredible ideas that are shared. But if you don’t store them for later use, when you’re thinking about it at the right time, it’s hard to actually take action on them or have them actually affect our real world activities or undertakings.\n\nAnd so I kind of started dreaming of kind of like, what would be the ideal way for me to consume this information? I wanted it to be findable. I wanted it to be serendipitous. I wanted it to be associative so that it would take me down these context rich pathways. So for instance, if I’m interested in the future of restaurants, I could start with a podcast episode by Patrick O’Shaughnessy, and then find the guest of that podcast, see what else he’s written, find a company he invested in, understand more about that company, etc. Eventually you start to develop combinatorial creativity, which is how you combine things from another industry and apply them to yours.\n\nAnd I think it’s very hard to do that with the information architectures that exist today. We basically have interruption technologies. We don’t have tools for thought. It’s a cliche term but for me, it’s about how we transition from information being an interruption to information being a tool to reflect.\n\nThe fundamental problem is information abundance (which requires curation), and information structure (which requires a better architecture to consume information). And so Startupy is what I call a community-curated knowledge network. That will enable us to not have to subscribe to one hundred newsletters and have them interrupt our days, but rather find things as we need them. I also want Startupy to inspire us with serendipity, because I’ve always believed that one of the biggest underutilized assets in the world is people’s time spent uninspired\n\n**I can’t help but think of Dumbledore’s **[**Pensieve**](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pensieve)** in Harry Potter (laughs). The only difference is that Startupy is community-curated. Can you tell me more about how it works?**\n\nThe MVP for Startupy was a database I built on Airtable. What I’m developing now is a multiplayer environment. The next step is to onboard people who want to participate in this curator collective. Then, we’ll work together to curate this database over time. My dream for this is to build a digital place the community both works on and is collectively rewarded for.\n\nAnd that’s why the case for user ownership online is so interesting. If you think about Twitter, they rely on people’s creative labor and they just sell advertising on the back of that. But what if you create a win-win situation where the curators are benefiting from their work instead of being exploited? I think that curation has never been given the kind of love, honor and attention that it deserves. After all, curators are a class of creators. And for me, curation is not just about link sharing. It’s not just, hey, here are ten new links this week. It’s about context. What does this specific link tell me about broader cultural or technological trends? What is important about this piece? There is so much value that has been stripped from curators because we call so many things curation. For instance, newsletters with hundreds of links are not the kind of curation that I envision for Startupy.\n\n**Have you started to work with some curators yet?**\n\nThe product is still in development. I think it’ll be ready in a couple of months and we’re going to launch our first curator cohort soon. So the hope is that we start with this cohort model to set the tone and to really cultivate this community. I’m kind of questioning the status quo across a lot of things with this product. And one of the things that we’re trying to do differently lies in the fact that most platforms these days have zero friction to publish or create. Anyone can post on Twitter. Anyone can write on Medium. And so I almost want to flip that on its head and wonder, what is a healthy amount of friction? On Twitter, 90% of tweets are created by 5% of the accounts. Then why don’t we build a product for those 5%? Startupy isn’t designed for people who just want to lurk. We are reimagining a lot of those things from the ground up. The first kind of friction that I need to decide is precisely around *who* is going to curate.\n\n**That’s fascinating! And how do you intend to qualify, select, and somehow… curate curators?**\n\nIt’s funny because you mentioned taste earlier in the conversation. The fact is, we’ve been working on the application process by focusing on identifying good taste. I guess that our definition of what good taste means for us will evolve over time, along with the kind of signals that we’re looking for. So far we’ve been asking questions like, what pieces of writing have changed your life? What is the latest rabbit hole you went under? We’re trying to find people that have a knack for finding and contextualizing non-obvious, thoughtful, nuanced, hidden gems. I’m less interested in Startupy becoming a place where you can see what Ben Thompson has curated, but rather a place where we can breed a new class of curators who have great taste but aren’t necessarily well-known. And so we have to find the best way to strike a balance.\n\n**You mentioned several times the term of “rabbit hole”, which is at the core of the Startupy brand. But isn’t it a kind of contradiction with what you said about respecting people’s time on the Internet?**\n\nFirst of all, it’s a great question! To me, the main difference between wasting your time on the Internet and engaging in a rabbit hole is about whether you’re in a flow state. When I’m on Twitter, I feel entertained, I feel inspired, but my thought process is constantly disrupted. It’s very different from the rabbit holes I want to encourage with Startupy. Let’s take an example I’m very familiar with. So these days, I’ve been thinking a lot about what it means to create a healthy community with strong content moderation. And so the idea is to start your research on Startupy looking for what has been curated around the history of censorship, social networks and moderation. The difference is that I do have this intention in mind, that of answering a question. Then I do want to expose myself to so many different things around this one topic. It’s rather about research with serendipity than entertainment with interruptions. Social platforms that promote viral content, blind engagement and inflammatory information stripped of context haven’t been designed to enhance your reflection. But going down a rabbit hole on a knowledge database that encourages flow state, concentration and the development of new ideas is a healthy approach in my opinion.\n\n**Definitely! I just wanted to play devil’s advocate here (laughs). Since we started the interview, you mentioned several toxic habits like the endless scrolling on social media, our unconscious tolerance for being interrupted and all these uninspired moments we spend online. So I was wondering, what would you recommend for a healthy Internet diet?**\n\nOn the Internet, you’re always encouraged to engage with still more content. But time is a scarce resource, not information. What I’d recommend is to switch from a consumer mindset to a creator mindset. Having projects puts you in a position where you’re not constantly just absorbing other people’s thoughts, but thinking about how to manifest your own. For instance, I switched to Hey for my emails and all the newsletters I follow go directly into a folder that I only open once or twice a week. This way, I’m not interrupted when I work and my inbox is super empty. Also, I set up an auto-reply that says that I’m trying to spend most of my time thinking and not responding to emails, and then that I’m not going to be able to respond super quickly.\n\nIn the era of Clubhouse, we’ve grown accustomed to doing everything immediately because of the instantaneity of such products. But I actually believe that everything on the Internet should be accessible on demand whenever you need it. I don’t want another product that will prevent me from spending time with my family. People shouldn’t have FOMO when they miss a Clubhouse room or have yet to read the newsletter that everyone has been talking about on Twitter. This is the main thesis behind Startupy: capturing the gems and storing them so that they’re available for later use. I believe that most problems online are completely solvable by design. And I’m confident that we’ll see more product designs with digital wellness in mind.\n\n**Speaking about the future of the Internet, I’d like to close this interview with your views on this huge topic. So among all the current trends, what do you think is here to stay for the next decade?**\n\nFirst, I believe that something to not be underestimated is that a bigger part of the value that we generate is going to happen digitally. The number of people that have made a single dollar online is still very minor when you think globally. But that’s going to shift. We would have never thought that teenagers streaming games on Twitch could make a living of it. Or that creators like Jake Butcher would make six-figure revenues by sharing online courses — and more recently selling graphics as NFT. I believe that the young generation will create all kinds of things on the Internet that we cannot even fathom. Then the nature of the job market is going to change dramatically.\n\nThe second part of my answer is about online friendship. The first wave of the Internet was very much about taking your IRL friends to Facebook and connecting online with people you already knew. But that’s such a limited understanding of the potential of the Internet. What’s more interesting is to make friends after meeting online. For instance, we met on Twitter and our ideas resonated with each other. You reached out and eventually we did this interview. And you may live in Paris while I am based in Miami, you definitely have more in common with me than I do with a lot of my friends that I went to school with and grew up with in Colombia. And I believe that tapping into that to help people make friends and create things based on their mutual interests is going to be a fascinating area to watch. The potential for the Internet as a bigger engine of serendipity and friendship is only at the very beginning.\n\nEventually, the most important aspect is how we make sure that more people benefit from all of the wealth and value created online? During the last decade, most of our interactions on the Internet were transactional: a company would do something for us and we would pay for it. Now, that relationship is a lot more complex because the user is not only a consumer but also a creator. For instance, I’m a consumer of Twitter. But since I tweet, I also add value to the network. I’m very excited about what it means to reimagine from first principles what new business models will look like in a world where the lines keep blurring between providers and users, medias and platforms, consumers and creators, etc. The reality (and beauty) of the Internet is much more nuanced and sophisticated, and so the rewards for value creation should be.\n\n**This seems to me to be a perfect conclusion to this interview. Sari, I owe you a big THANK YOU! It was even better than I could have imagined — and yet my expectations were already high (laughs). I’ll be following Startupy very closely and can’t wait to see what you have in store for us.

{"id": "iGBcUbPZA0EMrCrYffsa94WRl8g7756CmQzqlQ3hmMw", "title": "The emerging Internet Renaissance — my interview with Patrick Rivera", "body": "> **This interview was first published in [Plumes With Attitude](https://plumeswithattitude.substack.com/) ( 🇫🇷 ), my personal newsletter on the benefits of writing, on May, 2021.**\n\n*[Patrick Rivera](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera) is one of the most forward-thinking creators I've ever got to talk to. As a software engineer at [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), he works — [and writes](https://p.mirror.xyz/) — at the intersection of crypto and the creator economy. Here is our interview. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0d2dca56-4239-445e-aea9-6a2029060f72.png?height=516&width=844)\n\n\n**Hi Patrick, thanks a lot for accepting this interview! I have been following your writings for some time and I have SO many questions to ask you. In my opinion, you’re the creator who puts the most effort into making technical topics like crypto, Web3, and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) much more accessible. And this is precisely what I wanted to do with this interview. How about starting this conversation by defining and comparing these three terms using your own words?**\n\nThat’s a great starting point! First, I view crypto as an ecosystem of people who use technology to build a new way of organizing humans. In the past, countries were created with laws, religions with sacred texts, corporations with legal documents. [Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) are an example of structures you can build with crypto today. From a more technical perspective, I view crypto as the next computing platform. The interesting thing lies in some of its major differences from current and past models. One of them is money. There is no currency associated with a computing platform like an iPhone, as it needs to integrate with offline banking and the financial infrastructure. However crypto comes with a technology that allows you to create your own currency. There is also this new paradigm brought by smart contracts relying on a transparent model with guarantees on how the whole open system works. So crypto is a new way of organizing humans along with a new computing platform that has money baked into it.\n\nNow before talking about Web3, let’s start with Web1. It was the Internet of the 90s, characterized by static websites, marketplaces for physical goods, and limited bandwidth. Then Web2 arrived and marked the arrival of social networks, mobile phones, dynamic websites, and broadband connection that allows video streaming. Web3 is the next evolution of the Internet in which people own their data and assets instead of having to rely on centralized corporations or governments. In Web3, you’re not limited to the scope of a social platform when you want to share content.\n\nThen you have NFTs, which are essentially files living on the blockchain. That's kind of a simplistic way of looking at it but that makes it easier to understand. The fact is: you get a few interesting things happening when something is on the blockchain. First, you own it. Then you get to decide how this thing works. You can trade it, hold onto it, or program that whenever it gets traded and sold, you receive a royalty fee. It’s still really early, a lot of things are broken at the moment and there is a lot of speculation. But the promise is that, instead of uploading a file to Instagram servers and having it controlled by Facebook, you have it secured by your private key. And you can program its economics since you are the one who owns it and sets the rules.\n\n**Thanks a lot for such a rich introduction! I often have this feeling that getting into Web3, crypto, and NFTs requires you a certain mindset switch because of high technical and cultural barriers. What do you recommend to the people who want to follow these topics more closely but have no idea where to start?**\n\nI agree with the fact that these topics are not very accessible today. But once you understand the fundamentals, the system becomes much easier to reason about. And I think that it’s actually much more accessible than understanding how the existing financial system works. The best way to learn is to play around: buy cryptocurrencies, set up your wallet on platforms like Metamask, try not to lose your private keys. You’ll soon realize that it’s easier and faster than ever to send and receive money, earn compound interests, get a loan or buy art. I like to compare it to the early days of the dial-up Internet when you had to wait for a few minutes just to load a video. And just like the Internet got better over time, the progress in terms of convenience and accessibility will be exponential in the coming years.\n\nAt the moment, you need to switch your mindset from the habit of efficiency to experimentation. Youtube, Whatsapp, and Twitter are great to be entertained and communicate with friends. But if you want to see what things look like at the bleeding edge of technology and social apps, you should try swapping tokens on Uniswap, buy NFTs on Foundation, or fund a project on Mirror.\n\n**Your answer makes me think of something I’ve heard from Sari Azout [in our interview](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/VclwDqX-nSxzQTeJnJCTyMkzsvP_IJxwomzUaOYmq1k) last month. I asked her about her approach to a healthier content diet on the Internet. She recommended switching from a consumer mindset (i.e. passively absorbing content without purpose) to a creator mindset (i.e. purposefully searching for content). In [one of your articles](https://p.mirror.xyz/pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo), you wrote that you wanted to build software for creative people like writers, musicians, or visual artists. Why them specifically?**\n\nI consider myself a creative person. But I've also been in jobs and industries where I was learning things that weren't very fulfilling. Some people say that life isn't just about working. Still, I am convinced that being in a job you don't like does impact the other parts of your life. I want to help people make a living doing their best work in a path they truly enjoy.\n\nI am energized by the idea of building things to empower more people to express themselves and create art that empowers others and makes them feel good. I used to consider that only artists were creative people but that’s not what I believe anymore. I now think that anybody who is expressing themselves, whether it’s through writing, community speaking, code, or anything else, can be considered as creatives in their own way. And I believe that the next wave of artists will be those who give people the tools to turn their creative passion into their lives’ projects. We trust the people we watch on YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok. The new generation trusts MrBeast, not Fox News, the BBC, or the New York Times. And this changes everything in terms of education and empowerment.\n\n**Your ideas on empowerment resonate a lot with [a fantastic article recently published by Packy McCormick](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game) about the infinite games of the Internet. And the fact is: you joined one of the most exciting Web3 projects mentioned in his analysis, Mirror. Can you describe how it works in your own words?**\n\nWe're trying to build the tools for people to create crypto-native businesses similar to how people create e-commerce stores with Shopify. There are major differences though since crypto tools enable you to create a global corporation from day one. You can create your own currency, you can redistribute the wealth created through decentralized governance. The end game is to help the creators build their own economies. And there are a few different components for that. First, there is the financing: how do you raise money? Then we launched tokenized crowdfunding. The second is about defining the business model that will enable you to earn revenue. So we created features for minting NFTs and having auctions. We have a lot more ideas that will go further in this direction. The third component is about reinvesting. For once you have the financing, the business model, recurring revenues, and even treasury, where can you allocate those funds? This is why we are building the tools to help people reinvest in projects and people from the Mirror community. So the plan is to create an operating system for people to create global corporations using crypto tools.\n\n**Wow! I actually thought it was limited to writers or the publishing industry.**\n\nWriting is a central skill in the creator economy. You can use it in TikTok videos, stories, and memes, you can build communities and media around it. And it’s still a prominent tool for communication between people. So we thought writing was the ideal starting point and a natural first step for Mirror. Eventually, we would love for any group chats to be able to have a business model. We want any group of friends to be able to create a token, raise money, mint NFTs, earn revenue, and redistribute the funds in a decentralized and transparent way. And of course, we want it to be as simple as creating a group chat.\n\n**This is massive! I had absolutely no idea about your long-term plan beyond writing (laughs). You’re truly at the forefront of the coming shift between Web2 and Web3. Since you’re mentioning the creator economy, I wanted to clarify something with you. In [a presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sUpk0gbvRQelH0MUIOqjNeGe8nwRH4mhrhDHmI6qh4M/edit) you created for On Deck, you wrote that “most people on the Internet are curators, not creators”. What are the differences between these two terms, according to you?**\n\nBy definition, a creator adds new information into the network by creating new content. Well, this is actually the case for curators too. Compiling the ten best Twitter threads on any topic is an act of creation. So my take is not a perfect analogy since the lines are very blurred between creation and curation. However, I see a big difference on a larger scale. Contrary to creators, there is no good business models for curators today. It’s hard for them to make a living, showcase their work, and get discovered.\n\nI believe that NFTs have the potential to change this. The article you mentioned by Packy [McCormick] actually goes in that same direction. Social apps are going to look much more like video games with NFTs becoming similar to in-game items for the entire Internet. I think that in the future, pretty much all social interactions like retweets, likes, shares, or comments are going to be NFTs by default.\n\nWe actually have a project around content curation at Mirror. Imagine you want to collect essays by Sari [Azout] as NFTs. The idea is to enable her to create three different pricing tiers: for instance a common version costing something like fifty cents, a basic one for five dollars, and a gold bundle at one hundred dollars. Eventually, you could have your own digital bookshelf with all the essays you have collected from your favourite creators. Then you could access rewards like status badges and enjoy a whole new experience around collecting, trading and curating. It would be the game mechanics similar to that of Pokémon cards, but applied to any kind of digital content.\n\n**It makes me think of [a tweet by Ryan Hoover](https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1385998796107108358?s=20) telling that “people don't realize how much [video] games have influenced Millennial and Gen Z entrepreneurs and creators”. And this goes way beyond gamification in my opinion.**\n\nIf you think about it, trading cards are nothing more than intellectual property. They are just stories people created content around. Then you can do the same with any digital content. Why couldn’t you collect MrBeast’s videos or Sari’s essays then? So I believe that the social networks of tomorrow will be crypto-native platforms that enable you to collect, trade and get rewards based on when you bought an asset and how long you hold onto it. With Web3, the frontiers between creators, curators, and collectors will continue to blend.\n\n**You recently compared the current booming crypto ecosystem to an “[Internet Renaissance](https://p.mirror.xyz/pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo)”. This is a very interesting choice of words when you take into account the fact that it describes rebirth and marks a transition between a dark time and a period of enlightenment. It’s hard not to think about the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and all the hopes around the vaccines being deployed. Some renowned observers even talk about [the new Roaring Twenties](https://medium.com/positiveslope/8-themes-for-the-near-future-of-tech-410dbb0b1afb). So I was wondering: how do you connect all these elements together? And what are the main characteristics of this Internet Renaissance?**\n\nI think it applies to a very specific corner of the internet right now. The Renaissance happening is about creators finally getting paid what they're worth. In the past, the people that extracted the most value from creative work were the executives and shareholders at the biggest companies in industries like arts, media, and tech. Intermediaries like Facebook and Universal Music Group could build network effects since they had the relationships and the money. They had a complete monopoly over creators. You didn’t get your song played on the radio unless you signed with the right label. In the ideal perspective, the creators are going to have more ownership, leverage, and transparency on their future contracts. They will be paid more and reinvest in their communities.\n\nI’m a firm believer in the importance of making education, job training, and opportunities accessible to all. Yet I don't think we can rely on governments and institutions to provide them. Can you imagine having the best teachers in the world create compelling online courses that are free and accessible for all? They could do that with a business model that monetizes the top one percent that is ready to pay for premium content, collect digital assets, pay for consulting services, or attend in-person experiences. And I can see this new kind of modern business model being deployed not only in education but across so many industries. I truly believe that we are about to witness the most productive years of human history.\n\n**I can’t think of a more positive and optimistic way to conclude this fascinating interview. Thanks a lot Patrick for your enthusiasm and your willingness to make all these exciting topics accessible to still more people.

{"id": "9AyEZHTjkn1slh9fq58IOQ9TucAnojykq0EWpGa2Z6g", "title": "Pioneering the passion economy — my interview with Li Jin", "body": "> **This interview was first published in [Plumes With Attitude](https://plumeswithattitude.substack.com/) ( 🇫🇷 ), my personal newsletter on the benefits of writing, on October, 2020.**\n\n*October 2020 marked the first anniversary of the “passion economy”. The term was first coined by Li Jin in a now famous blog post. Since then, she developed her investment thesis and founded her own venture firm, [Atelier](https://www.atelierventures.co/), to help entrepreneurs build the future of the passion economy. I had the pleasure to have her as a guest for my newsletter. Here is our interview. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7d3957a8-dae1-43c0-927c-a8f17a3c2510.png?height=601&width=725)\n\n\n\n**Nice to meet you Li, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! It’s a real honor to have you as a guest for my newsletter, which I started a little over a year ago, a few weeks before you gave life to the amazing concept of “passion economy”. To start, can you tell us more about the context in which you published your first article on the subject?**\n\nWorking in venture capital, I had the opportunity to meet many founders building marketplaces in a wide range of verticals. We were particularly interested in how entrepreneurs connect supply and demand in a given market. When I started in venture in 2016, the prevailing model was the “Uber for X,” approach applied to all types of services, whether in education, tourism, or health. The idea was to turn a given service into an on-demand convenience. The consequence of that design is a standardized offering, which commoditized suppliers thus drove prices down.\n\nAs a result, it was difficult for providers to build a career and have upside on these marketplaces. Many individuals stay on these platforms temporarily and don’t view it as a long-term career. And so, a big challenge for these companies is to retain the supply side. But during the last couple of years, I saw a shift where more entrepreneurs addressed markets with more complex or higher-stakes transactions. Their marketplaces served customers looking for more nuanced services and who valued the individuality of the suppliers. The key to the success of these start-ups was richness and diversity of service providers — which I thought was very empowering and aligned to a model of work that I believe will become more prevalent in the future.\n\n**Did you have a specific key moment that proved decisive in the development of your thesis?**\n\nOne of the “aha” moments was a meeting with Amir Nathoo, cofounder and CEO of [Outschool](https://outschool.com/). Outschool is an educational platform that allows teachers to offer live online group classes to kids in K-12. A key element of the platform is that teachers have total freedom in the development of their curriculum, and so you can find a huge range of creative courses, like a class about seasons taught through *Frozen *characters.\n\nWhat stuck with me was that the founder mentioned that Outschool was one of the only ways for their suppliers to earn income flexibility by leveraging their creativity and education. I found it really interesting that the marketplace not only prioritized the needs of the demand side, but also delivered a unique value proposition to the supply side. It was from this meeting that I began to think about the foundations of what became the passion economy and ways to monetize non-commoditized skills.\n\n**Why did you choose the word “passion*”* to illustrate this new economy?**\n\nI chose the term “passion economy” very specifically: passion comes from the latin word “pati,” which means “to suffer”. This is apt because people often confuse passion with happiness — in contrast, I don’t believe being a successful passion economy entrepreneur means being happy all the time. Creators that I’ve spoken to don’t enjoy every moment of what they do; there is a degree of suffering and sacrifice. Passion means continuous effort and work, but feeling that the painful moments are worthwhile because there is a deep-seated sense of fulfillment. I think this is a notion that inspires us and something that we all want in our lives.\n\n**Somehow the passion economy borrows a lot of ideas from the art world, **[**which you seem to be familiar with**](https://li-jin.co/art/)**. Has art influenced your thesis?**\n\nVery likely! What we typically think of as creative industries — art, writing, music — are full of people who are passionate about their work. And in the art world in particular, many people are putting their passion for their craft over financial compensation.\n\nThe biggest commonality is the expression of a person’s imagination and creativity. There is something unique and individual in the products and services you find in the passion economy, whether it’s a video course, a podcast, a newsletter, or other services. Just as a work of art reveals the personality of its creator, these passion economy creations reflect the personality of the people that made them. This is in direct contrast to the “Uber for X” approach, which treats providers as a fungible commodity.\n\n**In your writing on the passion economy, you focus on the supply-side. But I tend to think that passion is equally important to consider on the demand-side. Can we then consider passion as a kind of currency at the center of this new economy?**\n\nEvery successful consumer company has to provide something of value to the consumers at the end of the day — it needs to be an improvement over something that already exists on some dimension. For creator-led offerings, that could be lower cost (because of a different cost structure), greater trust with their consumers, or something else. I wrote about this in a blog post about the links between the passion economy and [disruption theory](https://li.substack.com/p/how-the-passion-economy-will-disrupt). Passion economy models will be most successful in domains where there is an unmet or over-served consumer need.\n\n**I think this is in line with the concept of **[**aspiration economy**](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/veblen-is-wrong-the-new-aspiration-economy-765c3d5456d)** coined by Ana Andjelic, which I find very complementary to your analysis. You’ve also explored how the passion economy enables us to shift to a society in which **[**work is being unbundled from employment**](https://www.atelierventures.co/content/unbundling-work-from-employment)**. What effects do you think we can expect on the identity of individuals?**\n\nWork is still one of the most influential identity markers in our lives. For instance, in tech, there are certain values that are conveyed from the company that employs us; when someone says they work at Google, Facebook, Airbnb, or another company, a certain image comes to mind.\n\nWith the passion economy and the unbundling of work from employment, I imagine a return to a more pre-industrial notion of identity, namely one in which we derive our sense of identity more from what we create, who our customers are, and who our loose association of peers and collaborators are, rather than from a single employer.\n\n**These are ideas that can be found in the software craftsmanship movement too. I have the feeling that the passion economy will keep blurring the lines between the personal and the professional, between private life and public image. What are the main potential risks on the mental health of creators, according to you?**\n\nI think that the personal and professional identities of creators will increasingly merge. This is both a source of fulfillment — that one’s life is one’s work and feels meaningful and is what we choose to do with our time — but it also comes with risks. I recently watched an interview with David Dobrik, where he mentioned that he constantly obsesses over what he’s going to film for his next video on YouTube. As soon as he posts a new video, he is already consumed with thinking about the next one. The prospect of not filming anything interesting is a huge source of anxiety for him. I don’t think this lifestyle is suited for everyone — some people want more balance and separation in their lives.\n\n**If the passion economy becomes a disruptive innovation in Christensen’s sense, then it will have a societal impact that goes far beyond creators. What are the conditions for the passion economy to remain accessible to all and not just become a new “winner-takes-all” system?**\n\nThe key for it to not be “winner-take-all” is that there needs to be heterogeneity in consumer preferences. For example, a newsletter considered by some people as “the best” on a given subject may not suit the expectations and tastes of other readers. If there’s heterogeneous consumer preferences, that implies a long tail of successful creators, with many products/services that are popular among a large number of audience segments.\n\nI would add that an independent creator only needs a relatively small number of customers to make a living. This is the point of my [“100 true fans”](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/) blog, inspired by Kevin Kelly’s concept of [1,000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/): one can be successful with a smaller base of fans, because the internet removes intermediaries and connects creators directly to fans.\n\nFor me, this is the potential of the passion economy I am most excited about: one in which millions of people can participate and earn a living, not just a rarified tier of internet celebrities.\n\n**The first blog post in which you coined the term “passion economy” was a huge success and established you as a thought leader in this new ecosystem. Since then, I imagine that your articles are much more anticipated. Would you say that this has had an impact on your writing?**\n\nI’ve always had a really high bar for my writing. I want to make sure that my writing is worthy of my readers’ interest and attention. Time is our most valuable resource, and every minute spent reading my writing comes at the expense of something else. I always ask myself if what I write offers new insights that will be useful for founders, and am always trying to push forward into something new, interesting, and surprising.\n\n**For me, writing is without a doubt one of the most powerful vectors of serendipity on a lifetime scale. For your part, what were the most memorable events that happened to you following the article you wrote one year ago?**\n\nThe article definitely catalyzed a few interesting things. It led me to meet Adam Davidson, who is a journalist, author, and podcaster (he cofounded NPR’s Planet Money). Earlier this year, he published a book called [*The Passion Economy: the New Rules for Thriving in the Twenty-First Century*](https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Economy-Thriving-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0385353529), which is a more human-centered account of how various individuals are thriving in their careers by leveraging their passions. We’ve become close collaborators. And, in a way, I also jumped into the passion economy myself by founding [Atelier](https://www.atelierventures.co/). I also become more active in creating content: I’m part of the [Everything](https://everything.substack.com/) bundle, and co-host a weekly talk show called [Means of Creation](https://meansofcreation.substack.com/). I’ve also been writing more [in my personal newsletter](https://li.substack.com/) and take more time to paint and create art!\n\n**You actually fit perfectly the definition of a multi-potential person, with highly developed passions that occupy an important place in your life. How do you balance all your various passions with your life and career choices?**\n\nWhen I was a child, my mother told me that time is like a sponge — you can always squeeze more out for what you want to prioritize. That has guided me a lot in my choices. People often ask me how I can have time for all of my projects. I just prioritize and focus my time on what gives me energy rather than what drains it.\n\n**I’ve actually read **[**this advice**](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1131207138418630657)** from Justin Kan in the past and I couldn’t agree more. That being said, I know people who don’t have a real passion in their lives or who don’t even find meaning in what they do. What would you personally recommend them to do in this situation?**\n\nI don’t think that we are born with a certain passion. I believe passion is mostly the result of your education, experiences, and the time you’ve invested in developing various interests. I wouldn’t be as passionate about art had I not studied painting from age 5–18. Even my interest in the passion economy and the future of work is very much influenced by my personal experience as an immigrant, moving from China to the US when I was 6 years old and watching my parents pursue the American Dream. I don’t see a miracle recipe for finding one’s passion other than searching for it — that could be delving into one’s personal history, cultivating your curiosity, or exploring new interests.\n\n**I can’t think of a better way to end this wonderful interview. It was a great pleasure to be able to ask you all these questions about your fascinating journey.

I had a great time talking about the future of writing with such a charismatic polymath.*\n\n*Here is our interview. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1446/1\\*I4a6OzoG6vGyA-\\_-E3BJQg.png)\n\n**Nice to meet you Max, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! Let’s start with your background: you’ve been alternatively a startup operator, a founder and a freelancer in product, design and software engineering. You’ve also been the coauthor of a business book, **[***Oversubscribed***](https://oversubscribed.club/)**. So I was wondering: why writing? And how did it come to your life among so many interests?**\n\nI’ve been interested in writing for as long as I can remember, even before I have conscious memories. I still have stories I wrote when I was in second grade. Then I went to school for writing and I was a creative writing major. I also wrote a musical in college, and later a book of short stories. So I really thought I was going to be a writer.\n\nBut when I graduated, I realized that becoming a full-time writer didn’t necessarily look the way I’d have imagined. The fact is, I didn’t want to work alone and I wanted my job to be as collaborative as possible. So I ended up making a really sort of unexpected jump into startups. I worked in the tech industry and I started a real estate company that had a classic Silicon Valley rise and fall. But writing was still a big part of my life, mainly through side projects.\n\nI also found that a lot of the skills I was drawing on as a founder were, in some way or another, related to writing. A lot of what I was doing was telling stories, whether it was telling our customers the story of our product, selling our vision to investors or crafting the story of our company. Eventually, I was offered the opportunity to join On Deck and build out the Writer Fellowship last year.\n\n**Such a dream job for you! How did this opportunity happen?**\n\nThis actually ties to my practice of writing. I’ve been friends with [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg), the founder of On Deck, for almost a decade. We both started our careers in Detroit and we bonded over writing. We did a little bit of a writing group together and we both attended a book club that was infamous for only lasting one meeting (laughs). We stayed friends over the years and kept in touch through writing online. When he was thinking about launching the Writer Fellowship, he asked if I wanted to be involved and I eventually said yes.\n\nThis perfectly illustrates one of the reasons why I think that ambitious people should write online. Thanks to my writing, Erik was still able to sort of follow my journey from afar. And when he reached out to me, it wasn’t like we had to spend hours catching up on all the stuff that had happened.\n\n**I agree with you: writing creates a special bond with your readers, which can definitely bring serendipity into your life. And I have the feeling that this is exactly what On Deck is about. So let’s talk about it further! I tend to consider On Deck as an elite program since the endgame is to train the next generation of world-class talents in areas like entrepreneurship, angel investing, content creation, along with healthcare and climate. However, you seem committed to the idea of making your programs accessible to all, as initiatives like your **[**Access Fund**](https://www.beondeck.com/post/access-fund)** show it. But beyond that, how do you balance selectivity and diversity?**\n\nWe have two missions that could seem contradictory at first. One is broadening access and believing that talent can come from anywhere. And as you mentioned, the second is to build a community of world-class talent.\n\nSo the first layer of what we’re doing to expand access is to create a global remote-first community — what some people call the “Silicon Valley in the cloud”. Our goal is to move away from the days when you needed to be living in a specific place to be part of a certain community.\n\nThe second angle is about the journey at On Deck. Every program may be competitive, some are definitely harder to get into than others. For instance, the Founder Fellowship is one of the most difficult to get into. But there’s more than one path to join On Deck. Suppose you might want to start a company someday but don’t necessarily have an idea yet. Well, the Writer or Podcaster Fellowships are more accessible programs that will help you start honing and developing your ideas in the public sphere. And since you’ll be an On Deck Fellow for the rest of your life, it’ll likely be easier to join the Founder Fellowship when you’re ready. If your company takes off, you’ll then have the opportunity to send your employees into other programs such as the First 50 or the Chief of Staff Fellowships.\n\nWhen selecting our future fellows among applicants, we’re asking ourselves two things. First, can we help this person succeed according to their own goals? Second, would this person be a great community member according to our [guiding values](https://www.beondeck.com/guiding-values)? Beyond the programs, On Deck is about giving back, whether it’s with time, knowledge or support. This is why community is a core part of what we’re building.\n\n**I love this “choose your own adventure” approach between the different programs! Can you tell me more about how the different Fellowships communicate with each other?**\n\nWe’re very intentional about making sure that every fellowship has a connection to the others so that they overall make the whole network stronger. Our vision has always been about enabling entrepreneurship. And we view entrepreneurship as something that’s defined much more broadly than this very narrow slice of Silicon Valley that too many people often focus on.\n\nWe tend to forget that writers and podcasters do build products, connect with an audience and create communities. They’re entrepreneurs too! Having a successful writing practice actually involves a lot of skills other than just putting words together. Beyond writing, you need to understand the basics of growth, branding and distribution for instance. And I think it’s much more stimulating to learn all these things within a community of peers than on your own. This is a big part of the thesis behind the Writer Fellowship.\n\nAlso, we are building *one* global community, not just siloed fellowships. And so we do a number of things to enable the fellows from different programs to interact. In February, we’ll have our first ever Global Build Weekend. The goal is to make people from different fellowships collaborate on teams. For instance, I’m looking forward to seeing the next cohort of writers learn the fundamentals of visual branding from the design fellows. In return, they will have the opportunity to teach them some storytelling and copywriting techniques.\n\n**I assume that a program such as the Writer Fellowship must be very tied to your own personality. How did you bring it to the curriculum?**\n\nThat’s a great question! The Writer Fellowship was basically the first program launched after the Founder Fellowship. So I’ve helped a lot of the other program directors who have been launching new fellowships after me.\n\nOne of the things I’d really emphasize is that your program just inevitably takes on your own personality. When your product is an interactive experience within a community, there’s such a direct emotional connection between you and the “customers”. As program directors, we are lucky to have a lot of freedom to shape our curriculum as we wish. And my personal belief is that it’s all about the small things, from the music I choose when introducing a speaker to the dumb jokes I make in my presentations.\n\nOur approach is very bottom-up and not “one size fits all”. It’s not a ten-step writing course where everyone has to do the exact same things in the exact same order. You don’t have to write a specific essay during the program or anything like that. We aim at independent and entrepreneurial people who already have specific goals and ambitions. And we want to be in a position where we have a broad curriculum that can support all of that.\n\n**Plus, having a “one size fits all” program would result in growing an army of clones writing about the same things with the same style. Can you tell me more about how you ensure to adapt to each person’s personality and authenticity?**\n\nThe truth is, a big part of the program is about psychology. Like most creators, our fellows face common issues such as procrastination, lack of motivation, imposter syndrome or being scared to show their work publicly. Some of them don’t really need to be taught how to write as they are already great at this, even though there’s always room for improvement. Their most urgent need is support, so that they can get over their fears and have the courage to write about that topic that scares them.\n\nI like to draw the comparison with the Founder Fellowship, as it’s very uncommon for an entrepreneur to start a company and then the startup fails because they just procrastinate and don’t get any work done. But that’s comparatively a very common failure mode among creators, even for experienced writers. A huge part of what we’re doing at On Deck is to create a comfortable environment for people to do what they’re good at.\n\nWe also want the program to be a really exploratory space. The fact that we’re not pushing everyone towards one defined outcome is actually a great opportunity to explore. I love nothing more than seeing someone who comes into the program to develop their blog, let’s say about the great economic competition between the US and China, and eventually decides to start an essay about their experience raising a family after seeing some other fellows writing very personal stuff. It doesn’t mean they’re going to stop writing about economics, but it’s a way to be able to stretch their wings and kind of get their creative juices going.\n\n**At the moment, the curriculum is mainly designed for people who are building an audience. But I guess that you could extend it to a lot of areas such as publishing, screenwriting, journalism, or even music. How would you personally want to see the Writer Fellowship evolve?**\n\nIt’s definitely something that we think about. The good news is that we’ve attracted people working on several of these areas among our fellows. It’s very likely that within a year or two we’ll have dedicated programs for some of these topics.\n\nThe only thing is that we want to create programs that can legitimately help a lot of people succeed. I’ll take an example from my background as an aspiring fiction writer to illustrate what we wouldn’t do. So I’ve taken a lot of writing workshops in my life. Last summer, I was attending one in New York. Everyone in this workshop was trying to become a novelist. But when I looked around, I couldn’t help but think that no one here was ever going to be a published author. I’m not making any judgments but I’ve had the feeling that what these workshops are really selling is the opportunity to believe in the dream for a few hours a week.\n\nSo, would we ever start an On Deck fellowship to help people try to get a publishing deal? Well, almost certainly not since publishing is kind of a dying industry. Actually, one of the best ways to get published these days is to grow an audience and then leverage that into a book deal. But having a program focused on succeeding in traditional publishing would be like selling a pipe dream that the vast majority of people couldn’t achieve. It would be unethical taking people’s money knowing that the vast majority of them are never going to get there.\n\nOne interesting fact about our fellows is that they haven’t joined On Deck because they think that we’ll help them build a paid publication that will provide them 100% of their income. Rather, they see the fellowship as an opportunity to explore, to supercharge their career by writing about the topics they’re interested in, to connect with a broader network to boost their personal brand, and sometimes to make some money on the side. But those are all very achievable goals we can help them with.\n\n**That’s a very honest approach. I was simply curious about this possible evolution when I’ve noticed that you have someone in the first cohort who writes poetry.**\n\nYou’re referencing [Alysia Harris](http://alysiaharris.com/), a fellow who’s an award-winning poet and an incredible artist. She helped us learn a fantastic lesson during the first cohort. The vast majority of people in the program are primarily writing nonfiction. Yet we had several creative workshops, one or two about poetry, and what we actually realized was that even if you’re primarily writing nonfiction, you can get a ton of value out of doing a poetry workshop. You’re probably not going to just start being a poet. But they can be a great way to think more creatively and kind of get out of your rut. And the responses we got to these creative workshops have been very enthusiastic!\n\n**You’re preaching to the converted (laughs). I’m personally convinced that diversifying what you read and write on is key to find and sharpen your own style. Your ideas made me think of **[**another interview I had with Li Jin**](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/cKbvFpq0mV_-E0gM4GKmk8w-CYrKZF8ByC1nN2xm07E)** last October. **[**Her thesis**](https://www.atelierventures.co/thesis)** on the passion economy is essential to figure out what’s to come for creators. So I was wondering: how do you envision the future of writing?**\n\nI think we’re at a really interesting inflection point for writing. While many of the traditional industries and mediums are suffering, people read and write today more than ever before. This is really exciting, with both a lot of opportunity and peril.\n\nFirst, I think that people are too often too quick to view writing or other forms of creation with a binary viewpoint: either they’re trying to make it a full-time job or it’ll just be a hobby. But there’s a lot of space in between. For instance, I know someone who works in grocery logistics and writes a blog about the industry, which helped him get better career opportunities that he couldn’t have had otherwise.\n\nAlso, I’m a huge believer in Li’s approach of the passion economy. But like most things on the Internet, I think it’s going to end up forming a power law distribution. Substack is a great opportunity for independent writers, yet most people are never going to be able to support themselves entirely through a paid publication. I believe that many writers will follow the trajectory a lot of musicians have taken. The latter have started to think of themselves as products and monetized features like live touring, merchandising, private events, crowdfunding, etc. What I’d advise writers is to take a holistic view and figure out how they can bundle or unbundle what they have to offer. So the question is not about whether going full-time but about having multiple sources of income.\n\nIn some ways, that can be a depressing vision when you think that there was a much larger group of people making a living as full-time writers in 1960 than there is now. But let’s not forget that these people were pretty much all white men who came from elite universities.\n\n**And this is a very important point. But the new platforms have yet to prove that they can reverse this situation. To end up on a more personal touch: what are your writing projects right now?**\n\nI write a weekly email newsletter called [My Super Secret Diary](http://mysupersecretdiary.com/). I present it as a publication about “startups, literature, philosophy, American history, sex & drugs, and how to be alive,” but it’s really just about whatever I feel like writing about. It keeps me practicing and sharing my thoughts with what I like to call my “minimum viable audience”. I’m positive that it won’t be my only writing project for long, but for now running the On Deck Writer Fellowship is a pretty busy dream job (laughs).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*efXaixTZEeM7BIhHS5Y7eQ.gif)\n\n### **5 resources on writing curated by Max:**\n\n*   [**George Orwell’s Six Rules for Writing:**](https://infusion.media/blog/george-orwells-six-rules-for-writing/) “Classic tips from a master from his essay *Politics and the English Language*”.\n*   [**What I Did Not Learn About Writing in School, by Eugene Wan:**](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-did-not-learn-about-writing-in-school/) “A bunch of excellent tips, including some great advice on figuring out what to write about — *you don’t find your niche; your niche finds you*.”\n*   [***On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft*, by Stephen King:**](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816) “I’m not even really much of a Stephen King fan, but this is one of the best books about writing ever written.”\n*   [**Five Short Stories by Lydia Davis:**](https://fivedials.com/fiction/five-short-stories/) “These are works of (very) short fiction, not articles “about” writing, but Lydia Davis is a master of the craft and you’ll learn a ton about what’s possible from reading her.”\n*   [**Julian Shapiro’s Writing Handbook**](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro)**:** “It’s amazing that one person can write so many useful guides about so many different topics, but somehow Julian Shapiro’s done it.”\n\n\n### Read my other interviews:\n\n- **[The emerging Internet Renaissance, with Patrick Rivera](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/BoEyMiW_B2DoUZlFNKdfXRn59goHfrsPwvdM8KiLhb4)**\n- **[Following the right rabbit holes, with Sari Azout](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/VclwDqX-nSxzQTeJnJCTyMkzsvP_IJxwomzUaOYmq1k)**\n- **[Pioneering the Passion Economy, with Li Jin](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/cKbvFpq0mV_-E0gM4GKmk8w-CYrKZF8ByC1nN2xm07E)**\n- **[Building a New School for the Mind, with Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/edit/GD03ufsBOrDkKjO9psSLro0PEqC64So_t_uC39N20Hs)**\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1624564922, "digest": "9GZm-IGk-oL_OmxsLHl_fEApuZd3a5NkaITLS7jJ3ck", "contributor": "0xb18501548Eeb4660c2348A75515e2740041999F6"}

Just follow the white rabbit at your own pace, I’ll see you through the looking-glass. Here is our conversation. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d752de5f-45e2-409a-b46c-3109c708f776.png?height=478&width=724)\n\n\n**Hi Sari, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time and it’s a real pleasure to have you as a guest for my newsletter. I discovered your work a couple of years ago through the fantastic Check Your Pulse, that you describe as “a tech and startup newsletter designed to make you feel more human”. How did it all start?**\n\nI am a voracious consumer of information. I have always loved to discover new things, take screenshots of everything and fall down Internet rabbit holes… Prior to having a newsletter on Substack, I used to post recaps of what inspired me every week on Instagram. But it’s not a medium that encourages reflection.\n\nAll you do is scroll through an endless feed, so there was no room for reading in-depth articles, let alone thinking about their context. Then I kept the idea of sharing the things that inspired me but switched to a newsletter format. If you go back to the early issues, you’ll notice that it was mostly just curated links from all over the Internet.\n\nI also wanted to add that I was born and raised in Colombia. English is my second language and I had a bit of insecurity around my writing. I never thought of myself as a writer and I’m grateful that the curation work invited me to share some of my own ideas.\n\n**How did the thesis behind Check Your Pulse evolve?**\n\nI have developed this feeling over time that a lot of the tech writing is for the sake of technology. There is this assumption that everything we build with code is progress. But can drones be called progress? Who truly benefits from them? Even for topics like crypto, a lot of the media coverage is not from a human perspective. And yet, the most important part is how these technologies are going to affect our lives, and the nuances around that. So I wanted my newsletter to start conversations about technology that were less intimidating and more accessible because they put humans at the center of the conversation.\n\n**That may explain why I’m a big fan of your curation game! Check Your Pulse is by far the newsletter I click the most links. I believe that taste is the central element in the exercise of curating things. And in my opinion, you have the very best of the Internet. How have you been cultivating it over time?**\n\nFirst of all, thanks for such a great compliment! I share things that resonate with me and it’s always wonderful to know that they resonate with others. I am committed to the idea of respecting readers’ time and I have a very high bar for anything I share. When it comes to curation, I believe that “less is more”. I’m obsessed with the question of what I should remove while most media is focused on what else to add. The traditional business model for writing incentivizes people to share a bunch of stuff, not incredible gems. That’s why it’s so important for me to not be beholden to a schedule. I don’t want to worry about not finding enough things that meet the bar, which would be the case if I was on a weekly cadence. I don’t want that kind of pressure.\n\n**It makes me think of this **[**fantastic presentation**](https://projector.com/story/8fa326cf-ddd7-4ef4-972a-a7430feb8e00)** in which you remind people that it’s OK not to have anything to publish sometimes.**\n\nI’m reminded of the quote that says the job of a journalist is to “write faster than I can think”… unfortunately, even though we’ve made great strides in publishing advancements, the business model of emerging subscription-based media encourages consistent writing and leaves out millions of people that have a lot to share but don’t see themselves as writers — or aren’t going to share things on a weekly basis. But what if the one-off writer had an incentive to share? We need a new business model designed to fund one-off quality writing online. I’m running an experiment soon that explores a potential solution here.\n\n**I can’t wait to learn more about it! I saw that you also entered **[**the $WRITE race on Mirror.xyz**](https://dev.mirror.xyz/vZxxUIeGMQK9NNLcrT0eDYZ6wXhXVr6vTQzztj1DaEA)**. Do you think that this model could be the future of publishing?**\n\nThe team behind Mirror.xyz is building a user-owned alternative to Substack in which publishers and readers have an incentive to grow the platform. The project is still very early. As far as I understand, you earn tokens based on the value that you deliver to the network. Then as the platform grows, so does the value of the token. The comparison with Substack is interesting since it takes 10% of a publication’s revenue and can’t prevent writers from leaving for a cheaper alternative. But if there was a Substack token, then the people who joined years ago would still be incentivized to stay and help the platform grow. I am personally convinced that the fundamental promise of crypto is to be able to share and exchange value in very granular ways with your community — and that is a huge unlock.\n\n**That makes me think of **[**this tweet**](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1308430095460134912)** by Balaji Srinivasan from last year. He said that investing could be the most prevalent skill of the 21st century. And between the thriving crypto ecosystem, the WallStreetBets movement and the current NFT craze, it actually makes total sense.**\n\nIt’s fascinating because I do think that we’re living in a world where everything is financialized. These days, you can purchase anything that is consumable online: a tweet, a piece of digital art, etc. I’m a little bit concerned about this because I think it’s very hard to make money. If you think about the value proposition of these tokens, you know, I would say financial or economic upside is one of them. Then there’s governance and access. But beyond that, there’s an interesting concept of Patronage+ (coined by Jesse Walden) which is just this feeling of supporting a creator, with potential upside. It’s hard to see it as a financial instrument alone — I personally don’t see it. Packy McCormick wrote[ a newsletter](https://www.notboring.co/p/software-is-eating-the-markets) on this phenomenon of Angel Investing and how it’s less about the financial return and more about the social capital that comes with it. And I think something similar happens with cryptos and NFTs.\n\nIt’s all about the status. What does it mean to own it, to have invested in this company? What does it say about me? What does it signal about me? And I think investors have a similar dynamic where they don’t mean, we’ll get rich off of it. Many of them have already. But I think it’s more about the cultural value. When I was growing up in Colombia, I would sometimes come to the U.S. in the summers and I would buy a cool pair of shoes that they didn’t sell in my home country. And I would be excited to go back to school and kind of show off my shoes.\n\nAnd so the equivalent of that dynamic from the physical world now applies online, since posting a picture on Instagram for the whole world to see has a bigger reach than just showing up with a new pair of shoes in my school. And so I think NFT is a little bit of that. If the balance is shifting to digital, then how do I flex my taste online?\n\n**The **[**CryptoPunks**](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)** kind of summarized this with their owners adding the avatars of the NFTs they purchased as their Twitter profile pictures. Same for the **[**laser eyes**](https://decrypt.co/58302/elon-musk-bitcoin-advocates-have-laser-eyes-on-twitter-heres-why)** with the Bitcoin bullish. It’s a kind of statement, a signal that you belong to a cultural movement. I guess these different trends inspired you while building your latest project **[**Startupy**](https://startupy.world/)**. You describe it as what would happen “if Roam, Wikipedia, Substack and Product Hunt had a baby”. How did the idea of Startupy come to you?**\n\nAs I said, I spend a lot of time reading online. And just like everyone, I tend to forget a lot of what I read. Then it’s hard for me to get compound interest on the things that I read if they’re not properly stored for later use. And so for example, I would often meet with a founder who was building a marketplace business. And I was like, oh, you should be reading this thing or that thing. Or like a lot of these things I was reading, I was like, I wish I could share them with you. But even just going back and finding them was really hard.\n\nSo I basically started cultivating my own database or mini Google. Initially, it was this very simple architecture, storing content and companies that I was tracking and making them searchable. And then, it dawned on me one day that this was a fundamentally different information architecture than where we’re used to consuming information. In most places online, we only consume information recreationally. You go on Twitter and yes, there are incredible ideas that are shared. But if you don’t store them for later use, when you’re thinking about it at the right time, it’s hard to actually take action on them or have them actually affect our real world activities or undertakings.\n\nAnd so I kind of started dreaming of kind of like, what would be the ideal way for me to consume this information? I wanted it to be findable. I wanted it to be serendipitous. I wanted it to be associative so that it would take me down these context rich pathways. So for instance, if I’m interested in the future of restaurants, I could start with a podcast episode by Patrick O’Shaughnessy, and then find the guest of that podcast, see what else he’s written, find a company he invested in, understand more about that company, etc. Eventually you start to develop combinatorial creativity, which is how you combine things from another industry and apply them to yours.\n\nAnd I think it’s very hard to do that with the information architectures that exist today. We basically have interruption technologies. We don’t have tools for thought. It’s a cliche term but for me, it’s about how we transition from information being an interruption to information being a tool to reflect.\n\nThe fundamental problem is information abundance (which requires curation), and information structure (which requires a better architecture to consume information). And so Startupy is what I call a community-curated knowledge network. That will enable us to not have to subscribe to one hundred newsletters and have them interrupt our days, but rather find things as we need them. I also want Startupy to inspire us with serendipity, because I’ve always believed that one of the biggest underutilized assets in the world is people’s time spent uninspired\n\n**I can’t help but think of Dumbledore’s **[**Pensieve**](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pensieve)** in Harry Potter (laughs). The only difference is that Startupy is community-curated. Can you tell me more about how it works?**\n\nThe MVP for Startupy was a database I built on Airtable. What I’m developing now is a multiplayer environment. The next step is to onboard people who want to participate in this curator collective. Then, we’ll work together to curate this database over time. My dream for this is to build a digital place the community both works on and is collectively rewarded for.\n\nAnd that’s why the case for user ownership online is so interesting. If you think about Twitter, they rely on people’s creative labor and they just sell advertising on the back of that. But what if you create a win-win situation where the curators are benefiting from their work instead of being exploited? I think that curation has never been given the kind of love, honor and attention that it deserves. After all, curators are a class of creators. And for me, curation is not just about link sharing. It’s not just, hey, here are ten new links this week. It’s about context. What does this specific link tell me about broader cultural or technological trends? What is important about this piece? There is so much value that has been stripped from curators because we call so many things curation. For instance, newsletters with hundreds of links are not the kind of curation that I envision for Startupy.\n\n**Have you started to work with some curators yet?**\n\nThe product is still in development. I think it’ll be ready in a couple of months and we’re going to launch our first curator cohort soon. So the hope is that we start with this cohort model to set the tone and to really cultivate this community. I’m kind of questioning the status quo across a lot of things with this product. And one of the things that we’re trying to do differently lies in the fact that most platforms these days have zero friction to publish or create. Anyone can post on Twitter. Anyone can write on Medium. And so I almost want to flip that on its head and wonder, what is a healthy amount of friction? On Twitter, 90% of tweets are created by 5% of the accounts. Then why don’t we build a product for those 5%? Startupy isn’t designed for people who just want to lurk. We are reimagining a lot of those things from the ground up. The first kind of friction that I need to decide is precisely around *who* is going to curate.\n\n**That’s fascinating! And how do you intend to qualify, select, and somehow… curate curators?**\n\nIt’s funny because you mentioned taste earlier in the conversation. The fact is, we’ve been working on the application process by focusing on identifying good taste. I guess that our definition of what good taste means for us will evolve over time, along with the kind of signals that we’re looking for. So far we’ve been asking questions like, what pieces of writing have changed your life? What is the latest rabbit hole you went under? We’re trying to find people that have a knack for finding and contextualizing non-obvious, thoughtful, nuanced, hidden gems. I’m less interested in Startupy becoming a place where you can see what Ben Thompson has curated, but rather a place where we can breed a new class of curators who have great taste but aren’t necessarily well-known. And so we have to find the best way to strike a balance.\n\n**You mentioned several times the term of “rabbit hole”, which is at the core of the Startupy brand. But isn’t it a kind of contradiction with what you said about respecting people’s time on the Internet?**\n\nFirst of all, it’s a great question! To me, the main difference between wasting your time on the Internet and engaging in a rabbit hole is about whether you’re in a flow state. When I’m on Twitter, I feel entertained, I feel inspired, but my thought process is constantly disrupted. It’s very different from the rabbit holes I want to encourage with Startupy. Let’s take an example I’m very familiar with. So these days, I’ve been thinking a lot about what it means to create a healthy community with strong content moderation. And so the idea is to start your research on Startupy looking for what has been curated around the history of censorship, social networks and moderation. The difference is that I do have this intention in mind, that of answering a question. Then I do want to expose myself to so many different things around this one topic. It’s rather about research with serendipity than entertainment with interruptions. Social platforms that promote viral content, blind engagement and inflammatory information stripped of context haven’t been designed to enhance your reflection. But going down a rabbit hole on a knowledge database that encourages flow state, concentration and the development of new ideas is a healthy approach in my opinion.\n\n**Definitely! I just wanted to play devil’s advocate here (laughs). Since we started the interview, you mentioned several toxic habits like the endless scrolling on social media, our unconscious tolerance for being interrupted and all these uninspired moments we spend online. So I was wondering, what would you recommend for a healthy Internet diet?**\n\nOn the Internet, you’re always encouraged to engage with still more content. But time is a scarce resource, not information. What I’d recommend is to switch from a consumer mindset to a creator mindset. Having projects puts you in a position where you’re not constantly just absorbing other people’s thoughts, but thinking about how to manifest your own. For instance, I switched to Hey for my emails and all the newsletters I follow go directly into a folder that I only open once or twice a week. This way, I’m not interrupted when I work and my inbox is super empty. Also, I set up an auto-reply that says that I’m trying to spend most of my time thinking and not responding to emails, and then that I’m not going to be able to respond super quickly.\n\nIn the era of Clubhouse, we’ve grown accustomed to doing everything immediately because of the instantaneity of such products. But I actually believe that everything on the Internet should be accessible on demand whenever you need it. I don’t want another product that will prevent me from spending time with my family. People shouldn’t have FOMO when they miss a Clubhouse room or have yet to read the newsletter that everyone has been talking about on Twitter. This is the main thesis behind Startupy: capturing the gems and storing them so that they’re available for later use. I believe that most problems online are completely solvable by design. And I’m confident that we’ll see more product designs with digital wellness in mind.\n\n**Speaking about the future of the Internet, I’d like to close this interview with your views on this huge topic. So among all the current trends, what do you think is here to stay for the next decade?**\n\nFirst, I believe that something to not be underestimated is that a bigger part of the value that we generate is going to happen digitally. The number of people that have made a single dollar online is still very minor when you think globally. But that’s going to shift. We would have never thought that teenagers streaming games on Twitch could make a living of it. Or that creators like Jake Butcher would make six-figure revenues by sharing online courses — and more recently selling graphics as NFT. I believe that the young generation will create all kinds of things on the Internet that we cannot even fathom. Then the nature of the job market is going to change dramatically.\n\nThe second part of my answer is about online friendship. The first wave of the Internet was very much about taking your IRL friends to Facebook and connecting online with people you already knew. But that’s such a limited understanding of the potential of the Internet. What’s more interesting is to make friends after meeting online. For instance, we met on Twitter and our ideas resonated with each other. You reached out and eventually we did this interview. And you may live in Paris while I am based in Miami, you definitely have more in common with me than I do with a lot of my friends that I went to school with and grew up with in Colombia. And I believe that tapping into that to help people make friends and create things based on their mutual interests is going to be a fascinating area to watch. The potential for the Internet as a bigger engine of serendipity and friendship is only at the very beginning.\n\nEventually, the most important aspect is how we make sure that more people benefit from all of the wealth and value created online? During the last decade, most of our interactions on the Internet were transactional: a company would do something for us and we would pay for it. Now, that relationship is a lot more complex because the user is not only a consumer but also a creator. For instance, I’m a consumer of Twitter. But since I tweet, I also add value to the network. I’m very excited about what it means to reimagine from first principles what new business models will look like in a world where the lines keep blurring between providers and users, medias and platforms, consumers and creators, etc. The reality (and beauty) of the Internet is much more nuanced and sophisticated, and so the rewards for value creation should be.\n\n**This seems to me to be a perfect conclusion to this interview. Sari, I owe you a big THANK YOU! It was even better than I could have imagined — and yet my expectations were already high (laughs). I’ll be following Startupy very closely and can’t wait to see what you have in store for us. Talk to you soon!**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1\\*lzVQCrlh5Tmhw-\\_k2-wkeQ.gif)\n\n### **5 under-the-radar projects to watch, curated by Sari :**\n\n*   [**SourceCred:**](https://sourcecred.io/) *“A tool for communities to measure and reward value creation.

Her company *[*Ness Labs*](https://nesslabs.com/)* has become an impressive library documenting her many experiments between creativity, productivity and neuroscience. The good news is that you’re all invited to learn more about her journey.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1424/1\\*GcqUIPoP0gA4CBxoq6T25Q.png)\n\n**Hi Anne-Laure and thank you for agreeing to come back for the first anniversary of the newsletter. A year ago, you chose to put writing back at the center of your life, between the creation of your **[**Maker Mind newsletter**](https://nesslabs.com/newsletter)** and almost daily publications for your company blog Ness Labs. So to start, can you tell me more about the benefits this new habit has brought to your life?**\n\nWhen I started in July 2019, I published one article a day during the workweek — taking the weekend off to rest. Since November 2019, when I reached my goal of [100 articles in 100 days](https://nesslabs.com/100-articles-100-days), I have been writing three articles and one newsletter per week. I have seen changes on three levels, starting with an effect on my creativity. It has completely changed the way I produce content. Today, I write as soon as I find an interesting idea to exploit, whereas it used to take me several weeks to research and rework topics. Writing has become a very important tool to develop my ideas and share them. It has also opened the doors to several communities and inspired me to create one of my own. Beyond a newsletter with 20,000 subscribers, Maker Mind now connects more than [600 curious minds](https://nesslabs.com/membership), trying like me to understand how the human brain works. Writing is how all these encounters happened, and how I connected with people I never imagined I would have access to one day. Which brings me to my last point: the many professional opportunities and collaboration requests I have received around themes that I am passionate about.\n\n**I will come back later on to the community aspect of Maker Mind. Before that, I want to know more about the links you do between writing and creativity. Can you explain to me how this synergy between the two materialized for you?**\n\nWhen you have a certain number of articles a week to produce, you can’t count on a whimsical muse to inspire you on demand. So to avoid the blank page syndrome, I had to set up creative systems. The first version was simply to get into the habit of writing down on a mobile app any idea I might have during the day. It’s like planting a seed of creativity every time you hear or read something interesting. And it worked very well for me for several months. Only I felt like I didn’t go far enough after a while: I took each idea separately, so I was leaving a lot of creative opportunities on the table.\n\n**And that’s when you discovered Roam Research!**\n\nExactly. I discovered [Roam](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research) in January 2020 and immediately thought it was the perfect tool to take things to the next level. Beyond allowing you to list your ideas in a linear fashion like a classic note-taking application, Roam proactively helps you connect them together. This principle of generating new and original ideas from the combination of several ideas has a name: [idea sex](https://nesslabs.com/inspiration-to-idea-sex) (or “combinational creativity”). That’s when I realized that my previous creativity system didn’t work as well, and I switched all my notes to Roam.\n\n**I’ve always wanted to try Roam, but I think its apparent complexity intimidated me for a while. Can you explain to me how you use it on a daily basis?**\n\nI know that the concept of combinational creativity may seem intimidating at first sight, but there is really nothing complicated about my use of Roam. First of all, I still jot down all my ideas on the fly in my mobile app when I’m on the go. Then, I set aside some time each day to open Roam and create a page for each idea — which I will detail as much as I can so that I can remember them accurately over the long term. Then I’ll take time to think about the potential links between my new ideas and the ones I’ve already noted. One of Roam’s key features is the ability to create links between all your ideas — which its algorithm can also suggest to you. Not only does it push you to follow interesting thinking trails, but the tool will also lead you to uncover surprising connections you wouldn’t have thought of otherwise. Finally, I also use Roam for what is called [interstitial journaling](https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling). It consists of taking a moment to document your thoughts between tasks. For example, I’ll go to Roam after our conversation and write down everything that came to mind during the interview. It’s basically a continuous [brain dump](https://nesslabs.com/productive-cognitive-load). It allows me to not worry about forgetting random insights when it’s not the priority of the moment, and to be able to come back to these later. So I use Roam as both a tool for creativity and productivity. In fact, it’s by far the tool that has had the most significant impact on my life, both for my professional work and personal well-being.\n\n**Well, I really need to give it a try then (laughs). And so, you’ve written over two hundred articles and about fifty editions of your newsletter in the last year thanks to your creativity system. Then I was wondering how you go about choosing the order in which you’re going to write particular topics. Basically, do you have an editorial schedule defined beforehand that follows a certain logic?**\n\nAbsolutely not. My creative system encourages me to proactively take notes, write and connect ideas every day. Beyond that, I don’t try to control anything else. There’s really an experimental part to it, in the sense that I never know in advance what I’m going to write about — and therefore the order in which I’m going to tackle the ideas in my creativity inbox. Rigid schedules are not my thing. I like to keep the flexibility to let ideas emerge at any time and to be able to follow the trail whenever one of them piques my curiosity.\n\n**That reminds me of your recent publication on **[**the different types of note-taking applications**](https://nesslabs.com/how-to-choose-the-right-note-taking-app)** grouped into three types of approaches: those of the architect, the librarian and the gardener.**\n\nDefinitely. In this case, I have more of a gardener’s approach. There are two classic mistakes I’ve identified when talking to other people about these note-taking tools. The first one is to choose a system that doesn’t fit your creative style. If you have messy style, with ideas that come from all over the place, you don’t need to force yourself to adopt an architect’s approach. And all the more so because there is no system that is superior to another. There’s no problem with not being very orderly in your way of thinking, quite the contrary. In this situation, the gardener’s approach can help you make the most of your creative style. The second mistake is to think that you can’t deviate from the category you are in. Personally, I find myself to be more comfortable in a gardener’s system, but I also have affinities with the librarian’s approach. Depending on the situation, I’ll borrow from one or the other. Sometimes I even ask architects for advice to help me solve a problem that lends itself to it. So there’s nothing absolute: what is so great in this metaphorical classification is that it consists in knowing yourself better, so that you can build a system that is truly yours and can evolve with you.\n\n**I have this feeling that you truly live and experience what you write about. This is as true when you talk about the concepts and practices resulting from your creative system or when you openly share certain vulnerabilities. As if Maker Mind was a very intellectual approach to the diary exercise. So I was wondering: what was the biggest discovery you’ve made about yourself since you resumed writing?**\n\nFirst, you’re right about the experimental aspect of my work. That’s why I called my company Ness Labs: it’s my little lab and Maker Mind is my research diary. To come back to your question, I used to think I found my home in the tech world’s hustle and bustle. But in the past year, I realized that I really enjoyed the research and reflection process as well. I love working in a team, but I rediscovered the pleasure of being alone, digging into complex topics, and connecting ideas. When I was a child, my parents could leave me alone with my nose in the books all afternoon without me moving an inch. Writing somehow reconciled me with my inner bookworm (laughs).\n\n**That’s so nicely put (laughs)! We’ve covered the topics of creativity and productivity, and now I’d like to talk about what I consider the third pillar of Maker Mind: mental health. How has writing impacted this aspect in your life?**\n\nNote-taking and especially interstitial journaling allow me to identify warning signs of burnout. I experienced burnout in the past and the problem is that I could resist for a very long time without breaking down until it was too late. Today, I am able to act upstream by making decisions and adapting new strategies to prevent it from happening again.\n\n**I had just read **[**in your interview with Dan Shipper from Superorganizers**](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-anne-laure-le-cunff-wrote-200)** that burnout was a real starting point in the creation of Maker Mind. And I just wanted to ask you if you felt you had “cracked the code” of your personal balance or if you still felt at risk despite everything you put in place?**\n\nI don’t think it’s possible to “crack the code” like you say. On the other hand, I now have a much healthier relationship with my mental health. In particular, I have learned to accept that there are external stressors over which I have no control. Like many people, the lockdown has been a trying time for me. Even though I have found a system that works, I am no more able than anyone else to thrive without leaving my home for months. Twice this year, I announced to my readers that there would not be a weekly newsletter following difficult personal moments. Taking care of one’s mental health also means listening to oneself and knowing how to reconsider one’s priorities, with the guiding principle: “be kind to yourself”.\n\n**This year is also special in the sense that we have never talked about mental health as much as in 2020. Did the lockdown and all the news around Covid-19 influence your way of writing on the subject?**\n\nI have always talked about “mindful productivity” to put the emphasis on fulfillment rather than only focusing on goals and performance indicators. Among my readers, there are a lot of very ambitious, very passionate people who tend to work a lot. And indeed, this year’s context has made me insist in my articles on the idea that it’s more important than ever to accept that it’s not always possible to be productive, to also learn how to take the time to breathe and to reconcile with the idea of letting go.\n\n**During the confinement, you went further in this respect by creating a \\[paid] community around Maker Mind. What motivated you to go in that direction?**\n\nTo be very transparent with you, I started the community at a time when I was looking to generate recurring revenue with Ness Labs. It’s a healthy business model for the company, aligned with my values and the ones of my readers. It gives them the opportunity to meet each other, help each other, and move forward together in achieving their life goals. For my part, it allows me to focus on creating high value-added content and to get to know my community better.\n\n**Personally, I have the impression that building a community is more difficult to evaluate in terms of time invested than creating content. Since we were talking about burnout earlier, how do you make sure that it doesn’t become a time-consuming activity next to everything you already do with Maker Mind and Ness Labs?**\n\nTo tell the truth, I didn’t have to set any strict rules and there is nothing stressful about running this community. I’m fortunate to be surrounded by very emotionally intelligent members, some of whom have been following me for a while. I participate every week but I don’t have to force myself to do it. In fact, no one expects me to be available 24 hours a day to answer their questions. It’s a very calm community, not in the sense that nothing happens but because everyone respects each other’s time. I am very happy to see the members interact with each other without having to ask for my permission. For example, I think it’s great to see some members organizing working or writing sessions every day.\n\n**Paid communities are becoming more common for content creators to monetize their projects. Do you think it’s become a must to make a living from your writings?**\n\nThere are many counter-examples, with very high quality paid publications without a community component behind them. So I would say… not necessarily. Still, starting a community opens up many opportunities to better understand your audience and their needs. Personally, I’m very happy to have chosen to take Ness Labs in this direction. While I don’t see it as a prerequisite, I tend to encourage content creators to explore this path.\n\n**In addition to having a community to run and your fast pace of publishing, you also went back to school for a Master’s degree in Neuroscience. What was your initial goal and how did it evolve with the development of your activity?**\n\nWhen I started, I really saw the Master’s degree as a personal need. I wanted to study the inner workings of the human brain. In a way, writing about it helped me consolidate my learning. What I studied in class was often the starting point for reflections in my articles. What I didn’t expect was for this personal curiosity to quickly turn into a real business with Ness Labs.\n\n**I’ve learned that your longer-term vision for Ness Labs is actually a school. I guess going back to class must have inspired you in that respect as well. In fact, I feel like the pieces of the puzzle are coming together very quickly, between everything you’ve got on Roam, all the educational content published this year, and a fast-growing paid community. So when you think about it, Ness Labs already looks a lot like a school. What are the priorities you want to develop for the future?**\n\nI’m fascinated by new models of education. I also find that there are a lot of topics that are not covered in a traditional school and that I think should be covered in a traditional school. Today, nothing that is taught in schools is adapted to the level of demand, self-reflection, flexibility, and also stress that the new work models bring about. That’s why I want to create an alternative education model, with a flexible and decentralized system that would allow everyone to enrich their way of thinking, creating and working. Today, there is already a lot of material on Ness Labs and you can actually dig into many subjects on your own. But I want to create a collection of courses that would explore these topics in depth over several weeks. These would cover topics like developing your creativity or managing your mental health at work, all based on neuroscience. This kind of curriculum is the brick that Ness Labs is currently missing and that I want to add to the edifice.\n\n**What are the new educational models that inspire you the most?**\n\nThere is of course Lambda School, which a lot of people have been following closely over the last few years. More recently, I’ve been particularly interested in On Deck, which brings education and community together better than anyone else. It’s a system of cohorts divided into several fellowships for founders, angels, but also writers and podcast hosts. And what is very powerful in this model is all the possible encounters, synergies and collaborations between individuals, cohorts and fellowships. A member of the writing fellowship will be able to help his cohort’s entrepreneurs with content strategy; these entrepreneurs will be able to receive investments from angels from previous cohorts; and so on. I am very curious to see how these community-based educational models will evolve.\n\n**For your part, you’ve already created a lot of educational content that covers a wide range of topics. Is there a particular one you haven’t written about yet that you would like to explore further?**\n\nOne topic I’ve already touched on but I’m very keen to explore further is ideation; where do ideas come from and how do they form in our brains? It’s all the more fascinating because there are several research streams. Some people have a rather analytical approach to ideation, approaching a problem from all angles to develop new ideas. Others have more of an “aha” moment or [shower thoughts](https://nesslabs.com/mind-wandering). I really want to understand what is going on in the brain at this level and to know if there are ways to increase our capacity for ideation. Right now, I am reading a fascinating and accessible [research paper](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.northwestern.edu/dist/a/699/files/2015/11/The-cognitive-neuroscience-of-insight-1jie1hg.pdf) on the subject by John Kounios, a neuroscience researcher. It’s a topic I’m looking forward to writing about.\n\n**And I’m already looking forward to reading it! We’re coming to the end of this new interview that I’ve been waiting for a long time.

It is their job or at least part of their job. But I am also dismayed regularly by how poorly many elected officials and regulators understand the technologies they are talking about.\n\nIn particular, I am deeply concerned with how poorly many elected officials and regulators understand blockchains, smart contracts, and decentralized applications and organizations. They assume that these things are run by companies and people and can be regulated with traditional corporate regulatory activities.\n\nWhat people need to understand is that blockchains, smart contracts, and decentralized applications and organizations are not companies. They are software. And they can and do run without any company operating them.\n\nLet’s look at Bitcoin. There is no Bitcoin Inc. There is no company to sue. The founder is unkown and may not exist. So she can’t be sued either. There is nobody to call before Congress. There is no entity to make regulatory filings.\n\n[AMMs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) are smart contracts. These smart contracts operate liquidity pools that allow for decentralized trading of assets without any company operating them, controlling them, or managing them. Once these software programs are published on a decentralized blockchain, they just keep running without any intervention by anyone.\n\nI could go on and on, but I expect you get the point.\n\nSo when someone says that one or many of these decentralized software applications needs to be regulated or, god forbid, shut down, I wonder the heck they are talking about. I don’t even know what that means.\n\nOf course, using this decentralized technology could be deemed illegal in places and I fully expect that we will see that happen. But we won’t see it happen everywhere. And the places that embrace these new technologies will benefit immensely from them. So, like the criminalization of alcohol and gold, those approaches will eventually fail and will harm those regions that try it relative to the regions that embrace it.\n\nI believe the more productive path for regulators and elected officials is to take the time to understand how this stuff actually works and think about new ways that society can mitigate the risks while gaining the benefits. That’s a harder path but a better path.\n", "timestamp": 1624566034, "digest": "p805FeWO2O_E4zBG5vmXokvJc57EPl7ZCkzmCB_FGTo", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

As a software engineer at [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), he works — [and writes](https://p.mirror.xyz/) — at the intersection of crypto and the creator economy. Here is our interview. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0d2dca56-4239-445e-aea9-6a2029060f72.png?height=516&width=844)\n\n\n**Hi Patrick, thanks a lot for accepting this interview! I have been following your writings for some time and I have SO many questions to ask you. In my opinion, you’re the creator who puts the most effort into making technical topics like crypto, Web3, and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) much more accessible. And this is precisely what I wanted to do with this interview. How about starting this conversation by defining and comparing these three terms using your own words?**\n\nThat’s a great starting point! First, I view crypto as an ecosystem of people who use technology to build a new way of organizing humans. In the past, countries were created with laws, religions with sacred texts, corporations with legal documents. [Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) are an example of structures you can build with crypto today. From a more technical perspective, I view crypto as the next computing platform. The interesting thing lies in some of its major differences from current and past models. One of them is money. There is no currency associated with a computing platform like an iPhone, as it needs to integrate with offline banking and the financial infrastructure. However crypto comes with a technology that allows you to create your own currency. There is also this new paradigm brought by smart contracts relying on a transparent model with guarantees on how the whole open system works. So crypto is a new way of organizing humans along with a new computing platform that has money baked into it.\n\nNow before talking about Web3, let’s start with Web1. It was the Internet of the 90s, characterized by static websites, marketplaces for physical goods, and limited bandwidth. Then Web2 arrived and marked the arrival of social networks, mobile phones, dynamic websites, and broadband connection that allows video streaming. Web3 is the next evolution of the Internet in which people own their data and assets instead of having to rely on centralized corporations or governments. In Web3, you’re not limited to the scope of a social platform when you want to share content.\n\nThen you have NFTs, which are essentially files living on the blockchain. That's kind of a simplistic way of looking at it but that makes it easier to understand. The fact is: you get a few interesting things happening when something is on the blockchain. First, you own it. Then you get to decide how this thing works. You can trade it, hold onto it, or program that whenever it gets traded and sold, you receive a royalty fee. It’s still really early, a lot of things are broken at the moment and there is a lot of speculation. But the promise is that, instead of uploading a file to Instagram servers and having it controlled by Facebook, you have it secured by your private key. And you can program its economics since you are the one who owns it and sets the rules.\n\n**Thanks a lot for such a rich introduction! I often have this feeling that getting into Web3, crypto, and NFTs requires you a certain mindset switch because of high technical and cultural barriers. What do you recommend to the people who want to follow these topics more closely but have no idea where to start?**\n\nI agree with the fact that these topics are not very accessible today. But once you understand the fundamentals, the system becomes much easier to reason about. And I think that it’s actually much more accessible than understanding how the existing financial system works. The best way to learn is to play around: buy cryptocurrencies, set up your wallet on platforms like Metamask, try not to lose your private keys. You’ll soon realize that it’s easier and faster than ever to send and receive money, earn compound interests, get a loan or buy art. I like to compare it to the early days of the dial-up Internet when you had to wait for a few minutes just to load a video. And just like the Internet got better over time, the progress in terms of convenience and accessibility will be exponential in the coming years.\n\nAt the moment, you need to switch your mindset from the habit of efficiency to experimentation. Youtube, Whatsapp, and Twitter are great to be entertained and communicate with friends. But if you want to see what things look like at the bleeding edge of technology and social apps, you should try swapping tokens on Uniswap, buy NFTs on Foundation, or fund a project on Mirror.\n\n**Your answer makes me think of something I’ve heard from Sari Azout [in our interview](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/VclwDqX-nSxzQTeJnJCTyMkzsvP_IJxwomzUaOYmq1k) last month. I asked her about her approach to a healthier content diet on the Internet. She recommended switching from a consumer mindset (i.e. passively absorbing content without purpose) to a creator mindset (i.e. purposefully searching for content). In [one of your articles](https://p.mirror.xyz/pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo), you wrote that you wanted to build software for creative people like writers, musicians, or visual artists. Why them specifically?**\n\nI consider myself a creative person. But I've also been in jobs and industries where I was learning things that weren't very fulfilling. Some people say that life isn't just about working. Still, I am convinced that being in a job you don't like does impact the other parts of your life. I want to help people make a living doing their best work in a path they truly enjoy.\n\nI am energized by the idea of building things to empower more people to express themselves and create art that empowers others and makes them feel good. I used to consider that only artists were creative people but that’s not what I believe anymore. I now think that anybody who is expressing themselves, whether it’s through writing, community speaking, code, or anything else, can be considered as creatives in their own way. And I believe that the next wave of artists will be those who give people the tools to turn their creative passion into their lives’ projects. We trust the people we watch on YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok. The new generation trusts MrBeast, not Fox News, the BBC, or the New York Times. And this changes everything in terms of education and empowerment.\n\n**Your ideas on empowerment resonate a lot with [a fantastic article recently published by Packy McCormick](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game) about the infinite games of the Internet. And the fact is: you joined one of the most exciting Web3 projects mentioned in his analysis, Mirror. Can you describe how it works in your own words?**\n\nWe're trying to build the tools for people to create crypto-native businesses similar to how people create e-commerce stores with Shopify. There are major differences though since crypto tools enable you to create a global corporation from day one. You can create your own currency, you can redistribute the wealth created through decentralized governance. The end game is to help the creators build their own economies. And there are a few different components for that. First, there is the financing: how do you raise money? Then we launched tokenized crowdfunding. The second is about defining the business model that will enable you to earn revenue. So we created features for minting NFTs and having auctions. We have a lot more ideas that will go further in this direction. The third component is about reinvesting. For once you have the financing, the business model, recurring revenues, and even treasury, where can you allocate those funds? This is why we are building the tools to help people reinvest in projects and people from the Mirror community. So the plan is to create an operating system for people to create global corporations using crypto tools.\n\n**Wow! I actually thought it was limited to writers or the publishing industry.**\n\nWriting is a central skill in the creator economy. You can use it in TikTok videos, stories, and memes, you can build communities and media around it. And it’s still a prominent tool for communication between people. So we thought writing was the ideal starting point and a natural first step for Mirror. Eventually, we would love for any group chats to be able to have a business model. We want any group of friends to be able to create a token, raise money, mint NFTs, earn revenue, and redistribute the funds in a decentralized and transparent way. And of course, we want it to be as simple as creating a group chat.\n\n**This is massive! I had absolutely no idea about your long-term plan beyond writing (laughs). You’re truly at the forefront of the coming shift between Web2 and Web3. Since you’re mentioning the creator economy, I wanted to clarify something with you. In [a presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sUpk0gbvRQelH0MUIOqjNeGe8nwRH4mhrhDHmI6qh4M/edit) you created for On Deck, you wrote that “most people on the Internet are curators, not creators”. What are the differences between these two terms, according to you?**\n\nBy definition, a creator adds new information into the network by creating new content. Well, this is actually the case for curators too. Compiling the ten best Twitter threads on any topic is an act of creation. So my take is not a perfect analogy since the lines are very blurred between creation and curation. However, I see a big difference on a larger scale. Contrary to creators, there is no good business models for curators today. It’s hard for them to make a living, showcase their work, and get discovered.\n\nI believe that NFTs have the potential to change this. The article you mentioned by Packy [McCormick] actually goes in that same direction. Social apps are going to look much more like video games with NFTs becoming similar to in-game items for the entire Internet. I think that in the future, pretty much all social interactions like retweets, likes, shares, or comments are going to be NFTs by default.\n\nWe actually have a project around content curation at Mirror. Imagine you want to collect essays by Sari [Azout] as NFTs. The idea is to enable her to create three different pricing tiers: for instance a common version costing something like fifty cents, a basic one for five dollars, and a gold bundle at one hundred dollars. Eventually, you could have your own digital bookshelf with all the essays you have collected from your favourite creators. Then you could access rewards like status badges and enjoy a whole new experience around collecting, trading and curating. It would be the game mechanics similar to that of Pokémon cards, but applied to any kind of digital content.\n\n**It makes me think of [a tweet by Ryan Hoover](https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1385998796107108358?s=20) telling that “people don't realize how much [video] games have influenced Millennial and Gen Z entrepreneurs and creators”. And this goes way beyond gamification in my opinion.**\n\nIf you think about it, trading cards are nothing more than intellectual property. They are just stories people created content around. Then you can do the same with any digital content. Why couldn’t you collect MrBeast’s videos or Sari’s essays then? So I believe that the social networks of tomorrow will be crypto-native platforms that enable you to collect, trade and get rewards based on when you bought an asset and how long you hold onto it. With Web3, the frontiers between creators, curators, and collectors will continue to blend.\n\n**You recently compared the current booming crypto ecosystem to an “[Internet Renaissance](https://p.mirror.xyz/pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo)”. This is a very interesting choice of words when you take into account the fact that it describes rebirth and marks a transition between a dark time and a period of enlightenment. It’s hard not to think about the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and all the hopes around the vaccines being deployed. Some renowned observers even talk about [the new Roaring Twenties](https://medium.com/positiveslope/8-themes-for-the-near-future-of-tech-410dbb0b1afb). So I was wondering: how do you connect all these elements together? And what are the main characteristics of this Internet Renaissance?**\n\nI think it applies to a very specific corner of the internet right now. The Renaissance happening is about creators finally getting paid what they're worth. In the past, the people that extracted the most value from creative work were the executives and shareholders at the biggest companies in industries like arts, media, and tech. Intermediaries like Facebook and Universal Music Group could build network effects since they had the relationships and the money. They had a complete monopoly over creators. You didn’t get your song played on the radio unless you signed with the right label. In the ideal perspective, the creators are going to have more ownership, leverage, and transparency on their future contracts. They will be paid more and reinvest in their communities.\n\nI’m a firm believer in the importance of making education, job training, and opportunities accessible to all. Yet I don't think we can rely on governments and institutions to provide them. Can you imagine having the best teachers in the world create compelling online courses that are free and accessible for all? They could do that with a business model that monetizes the top one percent that is ready to pay for premium content, collect digital assets, pay for consulting services, or attend in-person experiences. And I can see this new kind of modern business model being deployed not only in education but across so many industries. I truly believe that we are about to witness the most productive years of human history.\n\n**I can’t think of a more positive and optimistic way to conclude this fascinating interview. Thanks a lot Patrick for your enthusiasm and your willingness to make all these exciting topics accessible to still more people.

{"id": "K4KtInTFTbl6QI6_wcKQyeghIlFrAGrMF94vQj3j1sc", "title": "Inter-chain and Intra-chain MEV", "body": "Maximal/miner extractable (MEV) value is the topic du jour in crypto.\n\nIt's a phenomenon whose ramifications have [been](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/mining_CCS.pdf) [theorized](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/2d84yv/miners_frontrunning/) for years. It's become [observable at a large scale](https://explore.flashbots.net/) within the last year or two, in part thanks to the DeFi explosion of 2020.\n\nIt affects projects at all parts of the stack and there's been a rush over the last few months to form opinions about it across the ecosystem. This rush has created a simplicity in thinking that hides a lot of nuance. \n\nIt's probably not just the case that 'MEV good' or 'MEV bad.' Or even 'all MEV inevitable' or 'all MEV mitigable.'\n\nI've been spending a lot of time in the weeds recently and want to explore the nuance today. I posit that the sloppiness/oversimplification of thought around MEV has to do with conflation of two 'types' of MEV. MEV that exists 'inter'-chain and MEV that exists 'intra'-chain.\n\nInter-chain MEV is largely inevitable and the best we can do for decentralization of the systems we're building is to democratize the profits from it. Intra-chain MEV, on the other hand might be mitigated considerably and it's worth our time to spend effort researching mitigation.\n\n## inter vs. intra\n\nIntra-chain MEV is what we talk about most of the time we talk about MEV. It's the opportunities that exist within a single synchronous block in a single chain. Things like atomic sandwich arbs on Uniswap.\n\nInter-chain MEV is anything captured between two synchronous chains. So rollup-to-rollup MEV, rollup-to-L1 MEV, and L1-to-L1 MEV. It's defined by situations where there are >1 transaction inclusion/ordering mechanisms that an entity needs to interface with to extract profit.\n\nI assume that we're headed to a multi-chain world. This was less clear 3 years ago than it is today. One shared, synchronous blockspace is not going to be gas-cost-effective for all things that want to decentralize.\n\nIt's worth thinking about the future of MEV as an interplay between intra-chain and inter-chain opportunities.\n\n## democratize inter-chain MEV\n\nWhy even talk about inter-chain MEV? It seems like the fundamentally 'less interesting' category. It feels analogous to opportunities one has being a market maker on multiple centralized exchanges.\n\nThe main argument that MEV is 'inevitable' has to do with the subjectivity of 'fairness' in what people call fair ordering protocols (link to chainlink research). To be honest, I hate the word 'fairness' here. It suggests that there's some global, moral notion of a correctness. A better phrase might be *deterministic random* ordering.\n\nAnyways, it's totally feasible that in a multi-chain world we'll have different deterministic random orderings on different chains. Thus there will be MEV opportunities available between these chains.\n\nA similar principle carries over to 'privacy' oriented MEV mitigation techniques, like timelock encryption. Not every chain that exists in the future will want the cost/latency tradeoff that comes with these techniques and so there will (likely) always be *some* inter-chain MEV to pick up between those that don't.\n\nInter-chain MEV truly is inevitable because the factors defining mitigation within a chain are very chain-subjective. Thus, if we want our systems to stay decentralized, we should work to democratize the extraction of it.\n\n## mitigate intra-chain MEV?\n\nSo what about intra-chain MEV? Will it all be mitigated? How does it compare to 'inter-chain' MEV in terms of its effect on user experience? The answer isn't as clear cut here.\n\nIntra-chain MEV feels 'more interesting' than inter-chain because any MEV opportunity here can be captured atomically, within a single block. If an entity has a monopoly on creating a block at some point in time, there is no sliver of time in which another entity can stop them from capturing an opportunity in that block.\n\nFlash mints and flash loans are tools you can use when capturing an intra-chain MEV opportunity (and not for inter-chain ones).\n\nIt's also less obvious to me that there's the same inevitability here that exists with inter-chain MEV. There are a number of chains that seem likely to adopt some level of mitigation.\n\nThe aforementioned 'privacy' flavor of mitigation could *entirely* mitigate MEV from a chain, but at a latency cost.  Deterministic ordering mechanisms will also [make their way](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/269.pdf) into chains.\n\nEfforts to mitigate intra-chain MEV seem well-worth researching to completion and well-worth consideration by the governing structure/process of any chain.\n\n## democratize inter, mitigate intra?\n\nThe two predominant narratives about MEV today are that we should democratize it all or we should mitigate it all.\n\nAs I've covered here, there's a little more nuance here. I currently believe that we should democratize inter-chain MEV extraction while developing ideas and technology to mitigate intra-chain MEV.", "timestamp": 1624565988, "digest": "5_rSZXH3Iq7KVqby81mqD-1FS8EZh8T6oQ1oWB4ofxw", "contributor": "0xed625c9ABa1245Fa8e22eb1f1825881517A9DCE7"}

I asked her about her approach to a healthier content diet on the Internet. She recommended switching from a consumer mindset (i.e. passively absorbing content without purpose) to a creator mindset (i.e. purposefully searching for content). In [one of your articles](https://p.mirror.xyz/pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo), you wrote that you wanted to build software for creative people like writers, musicians, or visual artists. Why them specifically?**\n\nI consider myself a creative person. But I've also been in jobs and industries where I was learning things that weren't very fulfilling. Some people say that life isn't just about working. Still, I am convinced that being in a job you don't like does impact the other parts of your life. I want to help people make a living doing their best work in a path they truly enjoy.\n\nI am energized by the idea of building things to empower more people to express themselves and create art that empowers others and makes them feel good. I used to consider that only artists were creative people but that’s not what I believe anymore. I now think that anybody who is expressing themselves, whether it’s through writing, community speaking, code, or anything else, can be considered as creatives in their own way. And I believe that the next wave of artists will be those who give people the tools to turn their creative passion into their lives’ projects. We trust the people we watch on YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok. The new generation trusts MrBeast, not Fox News, the BBC, or the New York Times. And this changes everything in terms of education and empowerment.\n\n**Your ideas on empowerment resonate a lot with [a fantastic article recently published by Packy McCormick](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game) about the infinite games of the Internet. And the fact is: you joined one of the most exciting Web3 projects mentioned in his analysis, Mirror. Can you describe how it works in your own words?**\n\nWe're trying to build the tools for people to create crypto-native businesses similar to how people create e-commerce stores with Shopify. There are major differences though since crypto tools enable you to create a global corporation from day one. You can create your own currency, you can redistribute the wealth created through decentralized governance. The end game is to help the creators build their own economies. And there are a few different components for that. First, there is the financing: how do you raise money? Then we launched tokenized crowdfunding. The second is about defining the business model that will enable you to earn revenue. So we created features for minting NFTs and having auctions. We have a lot more ideas that will go further in this direction. The third component is about reinvesting. For once you have the financing, the business model, recurring revenues, and even treasury, where can you allocate those funds? This is why we are building the tools to help people reinvest in projects and people from the Mirror community. So the plan is to create an operating system for people to create global corporations using crypto tools.\n\n**Wow! I actually thought it was limited to writers or the publishing industry.**\n\nWriting is a central skill in the creator economy. You can use it in TikTok videos, stories, and memes, you can build communities and media around it. And it’s still a prominent tool for communication between people. So we thought writing was the ideal starting point and a natural first step for Mirror. Eventually, we would love for any group chats to be able to have a business model. We want any group of friends to be able to create a token, raise money, mint NFTs, earn revenue, and redistribute the funds in a decentralized and transparent way. And of course, we want it to be as simple as creating a group chat.\n\n**This is massive! I had absolutely no idea about your long-term plan beyond writing (laughs). You’re truly at the forefront of the coming shift between Web2 and Web3. Since you’re mentioning the creator economy, I wanted to clarify something with you. In [a presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sUpk0gbvRQelH0MUIOqjNeGe8nwRH4mhrhDHmI6qh4M/edit) you created for On Deck, you wrote that “most people on the Internet are curators, not creators”. What are the differences between these two terms, according to you?**\n\nBy definition, a creator adds new information into the network by creating new content. Well, this is actually the case for curators too. Compiling the ten best Twitter threads on any topic is an act of creation. So my take is not a perfect analogy since the lines are very blurred between creation and curation. However, I see a big difference on a larger scale. Contrary to creators, there is no good business models for curators today. It’s hard for them to make a living, showcase their work, and get discovered.\n\nI believe that NFTs have the potential to change this. The article you mentioned by Packy [McCormick] actually goes in that same direction. Social apps are going to look much more like video games with NFTs becoming similar to in-game items for the entire Internet. I think that in the future, pretty much all social interactions like retweets, likes, shares, or comments are going to be NFTs by default.\n\nWe actually have a project around content curation at Mirror. Imagine you want to collect essays by Sari [Azout] as NFTs. The idea is to enable her to create three different pricing tiers: for instance a common version costing something like fifty cents, a basic one for five dollars, and a gold bundle at one hundred dollars. Eventually, you could have your own digital bookshelf with all the essays you have collected from your favourite creators. Then you could access rewards like status badges and enjoy a whole new experience around collecting, trading and curating. It would be the game mechanics similar to that of Pokémon cards, but applied to any kind of digital content.\n\n**It makes me think of [a tweet by Ryan Hoover](https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1385998796107108358?s=20) telling that “people don't realize how much [video] games have influenced Millennial and Gen Z entrepreneurs and creators”. And this goes way beyond gamification in my opinion.**\n\nIf you think about it, trading cards are nothing more than intellectual property. They are just stories people created content around. Then you can do the same with any digital content. Why couldn’t you collect MrBeast’s videos or Sari’s essays then? So I believe that the social networks of tomorrow will be crypto-native platforms that enable you to collect, trade and get rewards based on when you bought an asset and how long you hold onto it. With Web3, the frontiers between creators, curators, and collectors will continue to blend.\n\n**You recently compared the current booming crypto ecosystem to an “[Internet Renaissance](https://p.mirror.xyz/pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo)”. This is a very interesting choice of words when you take into account the fact that it describes rebirth and marks a transition between a dark time and a period of enlightenment. It’s hard not to think about the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and all the hopes around the vaccines being deployed. Some renowned observers even talk about [the new Roaring Twenties](https://medium.com/positiveslope/8-themes-for-the-near-future-of-tech-410dbb0b1afb). So I was wondering: how do you connect all these elements together? And what are the main characteristics of this Internet Renaissance?**\n\nI think it applies to a very specific corner of the internet right now. The Renaissance happening is about creators finally getting paid what they're worth. In the past, the people that extracted the most value from creative work were the executives and shareholders at the biggest companies in industries like arts, media, and tech. Intermediaries like Facebook and Universal Music Group could build network effects since they had the relationships and the money. They had a complete monopoly over creators. You didn’t get your song played on the radio unless you signed with the right label. In the ideal perspective, the creators are going to have more ownership, leverage, and transparency on their future contracts. They will be paid more and reinvest in their communities.\n\nI’m a firm believer in the importance of making education, job training, and opportunities accessible to all. Yet I don't think we can rely on governments and institutions to provide them. Can you imagine having the best teachers in the world create compelling online courses that are free and accessible for all? They could do that with a business model that monetizes the top one percent that is ready to pay for premium content, collect digital assets, pay for consulting services, or attend in-person experiences. And I can see this new kind of modern business model being deployed not only in education but across so many industries. I truly believe that we are about to witness the most productive years of human history.\n\n**I can’t think of a more positive and optimistic way to conclude this fascinating interview. Thanks a lot Patrick for your enthusiasm and your willingness to make all these exciting topics accessible to still more people.

The term was first coined by Li Jin in a now famous blog post. Since then, she developed her investment thesis and founded her own venture firm, [Atelier](https://www.atelierventures.co/), to help entrepreneurs build the future of the passion economy. I had the pleasure to have her as a guest for my newsletter. Here is our interview. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7d3957a8-dae1-43c0-927c-a8f17a3c2510.png?height=601&width=725)\n\n\n\n**Nice to meet you Li, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! It’s a real honor to have you as a guest for my newsletter, which I started a little over a year ago, a few weeks before you gave life to the amazing concept of “passion economy”. To start, can you tell us more about the context in which you published your first article on the subject?**\n\nWorking in venture capital, I had the opportunity to meet many founders building marketplaces in a wide range of verticals. We were particularly interested in how entrepreneurs connect supply and demand in a given market. When I started in venture in 2016, the prevailing model was the “Uber for X,” approach applied to all types of services, whether in education, tourism, or health. The idea was to turn a given service into an on-demand convenience. The consequence of that design is a standardized offering, which commoditized suppliers thus drove prices down.\n\nAs a result, it was difficult for providers to build a career and have upside on these marketplaces. Many individuals stay on these platforms temporarily and don’t view it as a long-term career. And so, a big challenge for these companies is to retain the supply side. But during the last couple of years, I saw a shift where more entrepreneurs addressed markets with more complex or higher-stakes transactions. Their marketplaces served customers looking for more nuanced services and who valued the individuality of the suppliers. The key to the success of these start-ups was richness and diversity of service providers — which I thought was very empowering and aligned to a model of work that I believe will become more prevalent in the future.\n\n**Did you have a specific key moment that proved decisive in the development of your thesis?**\n\nOne of the “aha” moments was a meeting with Amir Nathoo, cofounder and CEO of [Outschool](https://outschool.com/). Outschool is an educational platform that allows teachers to offer live online group classes to kids in K-12. A key element of the platform is that teachers have total freedom in the development of their curriculum, and so you can find a huge range of creative courses, like a class about seasons taught through *Frozen *characters.\n\nWhat stuck with me was that the founder mentioned that Outschool was one of the only ways for their suppliers to earn income flexibility by leveraging their creativity and education. I found it really interesting that the marketplace not only prioritized the needs of the demand side, but also delivered a unique value proposition to the supply side. It was from this meeting that I began to think about the foundations of what became the passion economy and ways to monetize non-commoditized skills.\n\n**Why did you choose the word “passion*”* to illustrate this new economy?**\n\nI chose the term “passion economy” very specifically: passion comes from the latin word “pati,” which means “to suffer”. This is apt because people often confuse passion with happiness — in contrast, I don’t believe being a successful passion economy entrepreneur means being happy all the time. Creators that I’ve spoken to don’t enjoy every moment of what they do; there is a degree of suffering and sacrifice. Passion means continuous effort and work, but feeling that the painful moments are worthwhile because there is a deep-seated sense of fulfillment. I think this is a notion that inspires us and something that we all want in our lives.\n\n**Somehow the passion economy borrows a lot of ideas from the art world, **[**which you seem to be familiar with**](https://li-jin.co/art/)**. Has art influenced your thesis?**\n\nVery likely! What we typically think of as creative industries — art, writing, music — are full of people who are passionate about their work. And in the art world in particular, many people are putting their passion for their craft over financial compensation.\n\nThe biggest commonality is the expression of a person’s imagination and creativity. There is something unique and individual in the products and services you find in the passion economy, whether it’s a video course, a podcast, a newsletter, or other services. Just as a work of art reveals the personality of its creator, these passion economy creations reflect the personality of the people that made them. This is in direct contrast to the “Uber for X” approach, which treats providers as a fungible commodity.\n\n**In your writing on the passion economy, you focus on the supply-side. But I tend to think that passion is equally important to consider on the demand-side. Can we then consider passion as a kind of currency at the center of this new economy?**\n\nEvery successful consumer company has to provide something of value to the consumers at the end of the day — it needs to be an improvement over something that already exists on some dimension. For creator-led offerings, that could be lower cost (because of a different cost structure), greater trust with their consumers, or something else. I wrote about this in a blog post about the links between the passion economy and [disruption theory](https://li.substack.com/p/how-the-passion-economy-will-disrupt). Passion economy models will be most successful in domains where there is an unmet or over-served consumer need.\n\n**I think this is in line with the concept of **[**aspiration economy**](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/veblen-is-wrong-the-new-aspiration-economy-765c3d5456d)** coined by Ana Andjelic, which I find very complementary to your analysis. You’ve also explored how the passion economy enables us to shift to a society in which **[**work is being unbundled from employment**](https://www.atelierventures.co/content/unbundling-work-from-employment)**. What effects do you think we can expect on the identity of individuals?**\n\nWork is still one of the most influential identity markers in our lives. For instance, in tech, there are certain values that are conveyed from the company that employs us; when someone says they work at Google, Facebook, Airbnb, or another company, a certain image comes to mind.\n\nWith the passion economy and the unbundling of work from employment, I imagine a return to a more pre-industrial notion of identity, namely one in which we derive our sense of identity more from what we create, who our customers are, and who our loose association of peers and collaborators are, rather than from a single employer.\n\n**These are ideas that can be found in the software craftsmanship movement too. I have the feeling that the passion economy will keep blurring the lines between the personal and the professional, between private life and public image. What are the main potential risks on the mental health of creators, according to you?**\n\nI think that the personal and professional identities of creators will increasingly merge. This is both a source of fulfillment — that one’s life is one’s work and feels meaningful and is what we choose to do with our time — but it also comes with risks. I recently watched an interview with David Dobrik, where he mentioned that he constantly obsesses over what he’s going to film for his next video on YouTube. As soon as he posts a new video, he is already consumed with thinking about the next one. The prospect of not filming anything interesting is a huge source of anxiety for him. I don’t think this lifestyle is suited for everyone — some people want more balance and separation in their lives.\n\n**If the passion economy becomes a disruptive innovation in Christensen’s sense, then it will have a societal impact that goes far beyond creators. What are the conditions for the passion economy to remain accessible to all and not just become a new “winner-takes-all” system?**\n\nThe key for it to not be “winner-take-all” is that there needs to be heterogeneity in consumer preferences. For example, a newsletter considered by some people as “the best” on a given subject may not suit the expectations and tastes of other readers. If there’s heterogeneous consumer preferences, that implies a long tail of successful creators, with many products/services that are popular among a large number of audience segments.\n\nI would add that an independent creator only needs a relatively small number of customers to make a living. This is the point of my [“100 true fans”](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/) blog, inspired by Kevin Kelly’s concept of [1,000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/): one can be successful with a smaller base of fans, because the internet removes intermediaries and connects creators directly to fans.\n\nFor me, this is the potential of the passion economy I am most excited about: one in which millions of people can participate and earn a living, not just a rarified tier of internet celebrities.\n\n**The first blog post in which you coined the term “passion economy” was a huge success and established you as a thought leader in this new ecosystem. Since then, I imagine that your articles are much more anticipated. Would you say that this has had an impact on your writing?**\n\nI’ve always had a really high bar for my writing. I want to make sure that my writing is worthy of my readers’ interest and attention. Time is our most valuable resource, and every minute spent reading my writing comes at the expense of something else. I always ask myself if what I write offers new insights that will be useful for founders, and am always trying to push forward into something new, interesting, and surprising.\n\n**For me, writing is without a doubt one of the most powerful vectors of serendipity on a lifetime scale. For your part, what were the most memorable events that happened to you following the article you wrote one year ago?**\n\nThe article definitely catalyzed a few interesting things. It led me to meet Adam Davidson, who is a journalist, author, and podcaster (he cofounded NPR’s Planet Money). Earlier this year, he published a book called [*The Passion Economy: the New Rules for Thriving in the Twenty-First Century*](https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Economy-Thriving-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0385353529), which is a more human-centered account of how various individuals are thriving in their careers by leveraging their passions. We’ve become close collaborators. And, in a way, I also jumped into the passion economy myself by founding [Atelier](https://www.atelierventures.co/). I also become more active in creating content: I’m part of the [Everything](https://everything.substack.com/) bundle, and co-host a weekly talk show called [Means of Creation](https://meansofcreation.substack.com/). I’ve also been writing more [in my personal newsletter](https://li.substack.com/) and take more time to paint and create art!\n\n**You actually fit perfectly the definition of a multi-potential person, with highly developed passions that occupy an important place in your life. How do you balance all your various passions with your life and career choices?**\n\nWhen I was a child, my mother told me that time is like a sponge — you can always squeeze more out for what you want to prioritize. That has guided me a lot in my choices. People often ask me how I can have time for all of my projects. I just prioritize and focus my time on what gives me energy rather than what drains it.\n\n**I’ve actually read **[**this advice**](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1131207138418630657)** from Justin Kan in the past and I couldn’t agree more. That being said, I know people who don’t have a real passion in their lives or who don’t even find meaning in what they do. What would you personally recommend them to do in this situation?**\n\nI don’t think that we are born with a certain passion. I believe passion is mostly the result of your education, experiences, and the time you’ve invested in developing various interests. I wouldn’t be as passionate about art had I not studied painting from age 5–18. Even my interest in the passion economy and the future of work is very much influenced by my personal experience as an immigrant, moving from China to the US when I was 6 years old and watching my parents pursue the American Dream. I don’t see a miracle recipe for finding one’s passion other than searching for it — that could be delving into one’s personal history, cultivating your curiosity, or exploring new interests.\n\n**I can’t think of a better way to end this wonderful interview. It was a great pleasure to be able to ask you all these questions about your fascinating journey. So many thanks Li!**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1\\*zBOt4bFsh58E3roVZPLi6A.gif)\n\n### 5 books that touched Li’s life:\n\n*   ***Rebecca* — Daphne du Maurier:** *“Sent me down a rabbit hole of Gothic literature during my teen years.”*\n*   ***Jane Eyre* — Charlotte Brontë:** *“Contains some of the most beautifully romantic passages in the English language.”*\n*   ***The God of Small Things* — Arundhati Roy:** *“Prose that borders poetry.”*\n*   ***How Will You Measure Your Life* — Clay Christensen:** *\"During my first year after college, I lived in New York City and went through a major existential crisis about work and the meaning of my life.

Just follow the white rabbit at your own pace, I’ll see you through the looking-glass. Here is our conversation. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d752de5f-45e2-409a-b46c-3109c708f776.png?height=478&width=724)\n\n\n**Hi Sari, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time and it’s a real pleasure to have you as a guest for my newsletter. I discovered your work a couple of years ago through the fantastic Check Your Pulse, that you describe as “a tech and startup newsletter designed to make you feel more human”. How did it all start?**\n\nI am a voracious consumer of information. I have always loved to discover new things, take screenshots of everything and fall down Internet rabbit holes… Prior to having a newsletter on Substack, I used to post recaps of what inspired me every week on Instagram. But it’s not a medium that encourages reflection.\n\nAll you do is scroll through an endless feed, so there was no room for reading in-depth articles, let alone thinking about their context. Then I kept the idea of sharing the things that inspired me but switched to a newsletter format. If you go back to the early issues, you’ll notice that it was mostly just curated links from all over the Internet.\n\nI also wanted to add that I was born and raised in Colombia. English is my second language and I had a bit of insecurity around my writing. I never thought of myself as a writer and I’m grateful that the curation work invited me to share some of my own ideas.\n\n**How did the thesis behind Check Your Pulse evolve?**\n\nI have developed this feeling over time that a lot of the tech writing is for the sake of technology. There is this assumption that everything we build with code is progress. But can drones be called progress? Who truly benefits from them? Even for topics like crypto, a lot of the media coverage is not from a human perspective. And yet, the most important part is how these technologies are going to affect our lives, and the nuances around that. So I wanted my newsletter to start conversations about technology that were less intimidating and more accessible because they put humans at the center of the conversation.\n\n**That may explain why I’m a big fan of your curation game! Check Your Pulse is by far the newsletter I click the most links. I believe that taste is the central element in the exercise of curating things. And in my opinion, you have the very best of the Internet. How have you been cultivating it over time?**\n\nFirst of all, thanks for such a great compliment! I share things that resonate with me and it’s always wonderful to know that they resonate with others. I am committed to the idea of respecting readers’ time and I have a very high bar for anything I share. When it comes to curation, I believe that “less is more”. I’m obsessed with the question of what I should remove while most media is focused on what else to add. The traditional business model for writing incentivizes people to share a bunch of stuff, not incredible gems. That’s why it’s so important for me to not be beholden to a schedule. I don’t want to worry about not finding enough things that meet the bar, which would be the case if I was on a weekly cadence. I don’t want that kind of pressure.\n\n**It makes me think of this **[**fantastic presentation**](https://projector.com/story/8fa326cf-ddd7-4ef4-972a-a7430feb8e00)** in which you remind people that it’s OK not to have anything to publish sometimes.**\n\nI’m reminded of the quote that says the job of a journalist is to “write faster than I can think”… unfortunately, even though we’ve made great strides in publishing advancements, the business model of emerging subscription-based media encourages consistent writing and leaves out millions of people that have a lot to share but don’t see themselves as writers — or aren’t going to share things on a weekly basis. But what if the one-off writer had an incentive to share? We need a new business model designed to fund one-off quality writing online. I’m running an experiment soon that explores a potential solution here.\n\n**I can’t wait to learn more about it! I saw that you also entered **[**the $WRITE race on Mirror.xyz**](https://dev.mirror.xyz/vZxxUIeGMQK9NNLcrT0eDYZ6wXhXVr6vTQzztj1DaEA)**. Do you think that this model could be the future of publishing?**\n\nThe team behind Mirror.xyz is building a user-owned alternative to Substack in which publishers and readers have an incentive to grow the platform. The project is still very early. As far as I understand, you earn tokens based on the value that you deliver to the network. Then as the platform grows, so does the value of the token. The comparison with Substack is interesting since it takes 10% of a publication’s revenue and can’t prevent writers from leaving for a cheaper alternative. But if there was a Substack token, then the people who joined years ago would still be incentivized to stay and help the platform grow. I am personally convinced that the fundamental promise of crypto is to be able to share and exchange value in very granular ways with your community — and that is a huge unlock.\n\n**That makes me think of **[**this tweet**](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1308430095460134912)** by Balaji Srinivasan from last year. He said that investing could be the most prevalent skill of the 21st century. And between the thriving crypto ecosystem, the WallStreetBets movement and the current NFT craze, it actually makes total sense.**\n\nIt’s fascinating because I do think that we’re living in a world where everything is financialized. These days, you can purchase anything that is consumable online: a tweet, a piece of digital art, etc. I’m a little bit concerned about this because I think it’s very hard to make money. If you think about the value proposition of these tokens, you know, I would say financial or economic upside is one of them. Then there’s governance and access. But beyond that, there’s an interesting concept of Patronage+ (coined by Jesse Walden) which is just this feeling of supporting a creator, with potential upside. It’s hard to see it as a financial instrument alone — I personally don’t see it. Packy McCormick wrote[ a newsletter](https://www.notboring.co/p/software-is-eating-the-markets) on this phenomenon of Angel Investing and how it’s less about the financial return and more about the social capital that comes with it. And I think something similar happens with cryptos and NFTs.\n\nIt’s all about the status. What does it mean to own it, to have invested in this company? What does it say about me? What does it signal about me? And I think investors have a similar dynamic where they don’t mean, we’ll get rich off of it. Many of them have already. But I think it’s more about the cultural value. When I was growing up in Colombia, I would sometimes come to the U.S. in the summers and I would buy a cool pair of shoes that they didn’t sell in my home country. And I would be excited to go back to school and kind of show off my shoes.\n\nAnd so the equivalent of that dynamic from the physical world now applies online, since posting a picture on Instagram for the whole world to see has a bigger reach than just showing up with a new pair of shoes in my school. And so I think NFT is a little bit of that. If the balance is shifting to digital, then how do I flex my taste online?\n\n**The **[**CryptoPunks**](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)** kind of summarized this with their owners adding the avatars of the NFTs they purchased as their Twitter profile pictures. Same for the **[**laser eyes**](https://decrypt.co/58302/elon-musk-bitcoin-advocates-have-laser-eyes-on-twitter-heres-why)** with the Bitcoin bullish. It’s a kind of statement, a signal that you belong to a cultural movement. I guess these different trends inspired you while building your latest project **[**Startupy**](https://startupy.world/)**. You describe it as what would happen “if Roam, Wikipedia, Substack and Product Hunt had a baby”. How did the idea of Startupy come to you?**\n\nAs I said, I spend a lot of time reading online. And just like everyone, I tend to forget a lot of what I read. Then it’s hard for me to get compound interest on the things that I read if they’re not properly stored for later use. And so for example, I would often meet with a founder who was building a marketplace business. And I was like, oh, you should be reading this thing or that thing. Or like a lot of these things I was reading, I was like, I wish I could share them with you. But even just going back and finding them was really hard.\n\nSo I basically started cultivating my own database or mini Google. Initially, it was this very simple architecture, storing content and companies that I was tracking and making them searchable. And then, it dawned on me one day that this was a fundamentally different information architecture than where we’re used to consuming information. In most places online, we only consume information recreationally. You go on Twitter and yes, there are incredible ideas that are shared. But if you don’t store them for later use, when you’re thinking about it at the right time, it’s hard to actually take action on them or have them actually affect our real world activities or undertakings.\n\nAnd so I kind of started dreaming of kind of like, what would be the ideal way for me to consume this information? I wanted it to be findable. I wanted it to be serendipitous. I wanted it to be associative so that it would take me down these context rich pathways. So for instance, if I’m interested in the future of restaurants, I could start with a podcast episode by Patrick O’Shaughnessy, and then find the guest of that podcast, see what else he’s written, find a company he invested in, understand more about that company, etc. Eventually you start to develop combinatorial creativity, which is how you combine things from another industry and apply them to yours.\n\nAnd I think it’s very hard to do that with the information architectures that exist today. We basically have interruption technologies. We don’t have tools for thought. It’s a cliche term but for me, it’s about how we transition from information being an interruption to information being a tool to reflect.\n\nThe fundamental problem is information abundance (which requires curation), and information structure (which requires a better architecture to consume information). And so Startupy is what I call a community-curated knowledge network. That will enable us to not have to subscribe to one hundred newsletters and have them interrupt our days, but rather find things as we need them. I also want Startupy to inspire us with serendipity, because I’ve always believed that one of the biggest underutilized assets in the world is people’s time spent uninspired\n\n**I can’t help but think of Dumbledore’s **[**Pensieve**](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pensieve)** in Harry Potter (laughs). The only difference is that Startupy is community-curated. Can you tell me more about how it works?**\n\nThe MVP for Startupy was a database I built on Airtable. What I’m developing now is a multiplayer environment. The next step is to onboard people who want to participate in this curator collective. Then, we’ll work together to curate this database over time. My dream for this is to build a digital place the community both works on and is collectively rewarded for.\n\nAnd that’s why the case for user ownership online is so interesting. If you think about Twitter, they rely on people’s creative labor and they just sell advertising on the back of that. But what if you create a win-win situation where the curators are benefiting from their work instead of being exploited? I think that curation has never been given the kind of love, honor and attention that it deserves. After all, curators are a class of creators. And for me, curation is not just about link sharing. It’s not just, hey, here are ten new links this week. It’s about context. What does this specific link tell me about broader cultural or technological trends? What is important about this piece? There is so much value that has been stripped from curators because we call so many things curation. For instance, newsletters with hundreds of links are not the kind of curation that I envision for Startupy.\n\n**Have you started to work with some curators yet?**\n\nThe product is still in development. I think it’ll be ready in a couple of months and we’re going to launch our first curator cohort soon. So the hope is that we start with this cohort model to set the tone and to really cultivate this community. I’m kind of questioning the status quo across a lot of things with this product. And one of the things that we’re trying to do differently lies in the fact that most platforms these days have zero friction to publish or create. Anyone can post on Twitter. Anyone can write on Medium. And so I almost want to flip that on its head and wonder, what is a healthy amount of friction? On Twitter, 90% of tweets are created by 5% of the accounts. Then why don’t we build a product for those 5%? Startupy isn’t designed for people who just want to lurk. We are reimagining a lot of those things from the ground up. The first kind of friction that I need to decide is precisely around *who* is going to curate.\n\n**That’s fascinating! And how do you intend to qualify, select, and somehow… curate curators?**\n\nIt’s funny because you mentioned taste earlier in the conversation. The fact is, we’ve been working on the application process by focusing on identifying good taste. I guess that our definition of what good taste means for us will evolve over time, along with the kind of signals that we’re looking for. So far we’ve been asking questions like, what pieces of writing have changed your life? What is the latest rabbit hole you went under? We’re trying to find people that have a knack for finding and contextualizing non-obvious, thoughtful, nuanced, hidden gems. I’m less interested in Startupy becoming a place where you can see what Ben Thompson has curated, but rather a place where we can breed a new class of curators who have great taste but aren’t necessarily well-known. And so we have to find the best way to strike a balance.\n\n**You mentioned several times the term of “rabbit hole”, which is at the core of the Startupy brand. But isn’t it a kind of contradiction with what you said about respecting people’s time on the Internet?**\n\nFirst of all, it’s a great question! To me, the main difference between wasting your time on the Internet and engaging in a rabbit hole is about whether you’re in a flow state. When I’m on Twitter, I feel entertained, I feel inspired, but my thought process is constantly disrupted. It’s very different from the rabbit holes I want to encourage with Startupy. Let’s take an example I’m very familiar with. So these days, I’ve been thinking a lot about what it means to create a healthy community with strong content moderation. And so the idea is to start your research on Startupy looking for what has been curated around the history of censorship, social networks and moderation. The difference is that I do have this intention in mind, that of answering a question. Then I do want to expose myself to so many different things around this one topic. It’s rather about research with serendipity than entertainment with interruptions. Social platforms that promote viral content, blind engagement and inflammatory information stripped of context haven’t been designed to enhance your reflection. But going down a rabbit hole on a knowledge database that encourages flow state, concentration and the development of new ideas is a healthy approach in my opinion.\n\n**Definitely! I just wanted to play devil’s advocate here (laughs). Since we started the interview, you mentioned several toxic habits like the endless scrolling on social media, our unconscious tolerance for being interrupted and all these uninspired moments we spend online. So I was wondering, what would you recommend for a healthy Internet diet?**\n\nOn the Internet, you’re always encouraged to engage with still more content. But time is a scarce resource, not information. What I’d recommend is to switch from a consumer mindset to a creator mindset. Having projects puts you in a position where you’re not constantly just absorbing other people’s thoughts, but thinking about how to manifest your own. For instance, I switched to Hey for my emails and all the newsletters I follow go directly into a folder that I only open once or twice a week. This way, I’m not interrupted when I work and my inbox is super empty. Also, I set up an auto-reply that says that I’m trying to spend most of my time thinking and not responding to emails, and then that I’m not going to be able to respond super quickly.\n\nIn the era of Clubhouse, we’ve grown accustomed to doing everything immediately because of the instantaneity of such products. But I actually believe that everything on the Internet should be accessible on demand whenever you need it. I don’t want another product that will prevent me from spending time with my family. People shouldn’t have FOMO when they miss a Clubhouse room or have yet to read the newsletter that everyone has been talking about on Twitter. This is the main thesis behind Startupy: capturing the gems and storing them so that they’re available for later use. I believe that most problems online are completely solvable by design. And I’m confident that we’ll see more product designs with digital wellness in mind.\n\n**Speaking about the future of the Internet, I’d like to close this interview with your views on this huge topic. So among all the current trends, what do you think is here to stay for the next decade?**\n\nFirst, I believe that something to not be underestimated is that a bigger part of the value that we generate is going to happen digitally. The number of people that have made a single dollar online is still very minor when you think globally. But that’s going to shift. We would have never thought that teenagers streaming games on Twitch could make a living of it. Or that creators like Jake Butcher would make six-figure revenues by sharing online courses — and more recently selling graphics as NFT. I believe that the young generation will create all kinds of things on the Internet that we cannot even fathom. Then the nature of the job market is going to change dramatically.\n\nThe second part of my answer is about online friendship. The first wave of the Internet was very much about taking your IRL friends to Facebook and connecting online with people you already knew. But that’s such a limited understanding of the potential of the Internet. What’s more interesting is to make friends after meeting online. For instance, we met on Twitter and our ideas resonated with each other. You reached out and eventually we did this interview. And you may live in Paris while I am based in Miami, you definitely have more in common with me than I do with a lot of my friends that I went to school with and grew up with in Colombia. And I believe that tapping into that to help people make friends and create things based on their mutual interests is going to be a fascinating area to watch. The potential for the Internet as a bigger engine of serendipity and friendship is only at the very beginning.\n\nEventually, the most important aspect is how we make sure that more people benefit from all of the wealth and value created online? During the last decade, most of our interactions on the Internet were transactional: a company would do something for us and we would pay for it. Now, that relationship is a lot more complex because the user is not only a consumer but also a creator. For instance, I’m a consumer of Twitter. But since I tweet, I also add value to the network. I’m very excited about what it means to reimagine from first principles what new business models will look like in a world where the lines keep blurring between providers and users, medias and platforms, consumers and creators, etc. The reality (and beauty) of the Internet is much more nuanced and sophisticated, and so the rewards for value creation should be.\n\n**This seems to me to be a perfect conclusion to this interview. Sari, I owe you a big THANK YOU! It was even better than I could have imagined — and yet my expectations were already high (laughs). I’ll be following Startupy very closely and can’t wait to see what you have in store for us.

I had a great time talking about the future of writing with such a charismatic polymath.*\n\n*Here is our interview. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1446/1\\*I4a6OzoG6vGyA-\\_-E3BJQg.png)\n\n**Nice to meet you Max, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! Let’s start with your background: you’ve been alternatively a startup operator, a founder and a freelancer in product, design and software engineering. You’ve also been the coauthor of a business book, **[***Oversubscribed***](https://oversubscribed.club/)**. So I was wondering: why writing? And how did it come to your life among so many interests?**\n\nI’ve been interested in writing for as long as I can remember, even before I have conscious memories. I still have stories I wrote when I was in second grade. Then I went to school for writing and I was a creative writing major. I also wrote a musical in college, and later a book of short stories. So I really thought I was going to be a writer.\n\nBut when I graduated, I realized that becoming a full-time writer didn’t necessarily look the way I’d have imagined. The fact is, I didn’t want to work alone and I wanted my job to be as collaborative as possible. So I ended up making a really sort of unexpected jump into startups. I worked in the tech industry and I started a real estate company that had a classic Silicon Valley rise and fall. But writing was still a big part of my life, mainly through side projects.\n\nI also found that a lot of the skills I was drawing on as a founder were, in some way or another, related to writing. A lot of what I was doing was telling stories, whether it was telling our customers the story of our product, selling our vision to investors or crafting the story of our company. Eventually, I was offered the opportunity to join On Deck and build out the Writer Fellowship last year.\n\n**Such a dream job for you! How did this opportunity happen?**\n\nThis actually ties to my practice of writing. I’ve been friends with [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg), the founder of On Deck, for almost a decade. We both started our careers in Detroit and we bonded over writing. We did a little bit of a writing group together and we both attended a book club that was infamous for only lasting one meeting (laughs). We stayed friends over the years and kept in touch through writing online. When he was thinking about launching the Writer Fellowship, he asked if I wanted to be involved and I eventually said yes.\n\nThis perfectly illustrates one of the reasons why I think that ambitious people should write online. Thanks to my writing, Erik was still able to sort of follow my journey from afar. And when he reached out to me, it wasn’t like we had to spend hours catching up on all the stuff that had happened.\n\n**I agree with you: writing creates a special bond with your readers, which can definitely bring serendipity into your life. And I have the feeling that this is exactly what On Deck is about. So let’s talk about it further! I tend to consider On Deck as an elite program since the endgame is to train the next generation of world-class talents in areas like entrepreneurship, angel investing, content creation, along with healthcare and climate. However, you seem committed to the idea of making your programs accessible to all, as initiatives like your **[**Access Fund**](https://www.beondeck.com/post/access-fund)** show it. But beyond that, how do you balance selectivity and diversity?**\n\nWe have two missions that could seem contradictory at first. One is broadening access and believing that talent can come from anywhere. And as you mentioned, the second is to build a community of world-class talent.\n\nSo the first layer of what we’re doing to expand access is to create a global remote-first community — what some people call the “Silicon Valley in the cloud”. Our goal is to move away from the days when you needed to be living in a specific place to be part of a certain community.\n\nThe second angle is about the journey at On Deck. Every program may be competitive, some are definitely harder to get into than others. For instance, the Founder Fellowship is one of the most difficult to get into. But there’s more than one path to join On Deck. Suppose you might want to start a company someday but don’t necessarily have an idea yet. Well, the Writer or Podcaster Fellowships are more accessible programs that will help you start honing and developing your ideas in the public sphere. And since you’ll be an On Deck Fellow for the rest of your life, it’ll likely be easier to join the Founder Fellowship when you’re ready. If your company takes off, you’ll then have the opportunity to send your employees into other programs such as the First 50 or the Chief of Staff Fellowships.\n\nWhen selecting our future fellows among applicants, we’re asking ourselves two things. First, can we help this person succeed according to their own goals? Second, would this person be a great community member according to our [guiding values](https://www.beondeck.com/guiding-values)? Beyond the programs, On Deck is about giving back, whether it’s with time, knowledge or support. This is why community is a core part of what we’re building.\n\n**I love this “choose your own adventure” approach between the different programs! Can you tell me more about how the different Fellowships communicate with each other?**\n\nWe’re very intentional about making sure that every fellowship has a connection to the others so that they overall make the whole network stronger. Our vision has always been about enabling entrepreneurship. And we view entrepreneurship as something that’s defined much more broadly than this very narrow slice of Silicon Valley that too many people often focus on.\n\nWe tend to forget that writers and podcasters do build products, connect with an audience and create communities. They’re entrepreneurs too! Having a successful writing practice actually involves a lot of skills other than just putting words together. Beyond writing, you need to understand the basics of growth, branding and distribution for instance. And I think it’s much more stimulating to learn all these things within a community of peers than on your own. This is a big part of the thesis behind the Writer Fellowship.\n\nAlso, we are building *one* global community, not just siloed fellowships. And so we do a number of things to enable the fellows from different programs to interact. In February, we’ll have our first ever Global Build Weekend. The goal is to make people from different fellowships collaborate on teams. For instance, I’m looking forward to seeing the next cohort of writers learn the fundamentals of visual branding from the design fellows. In return, they will have the opportunity to teach them some storytelling and copywriting techniques.\n\n**I assume that a program such as the Writer Fellowship must be very tied to your own personality. How did you bring it to the curriculum?**\n\nThat’s a great question! The Writer Fellowship was basically the first program launched after the Founder Fellowship. So I’ve helped a lot of the other program directors who have been launching new fellowships after me.\n\nOne of the things I’d really emphasize is that your program just inevitably takes on your own personality. When your product is an interactive experience within a community, there’s such a direct emotional connection between you and the “customers”. As program directors, we are lucky to have a lot of freedom to shape our curriculum as we wish. And my personal belief is that it’s all about the small things, from the music I choose when introducing a speaker to the dumb jokes I make in my presentations.\n\nOur approach is very bottom-up and not “one size fits all”. It’s not a ten-step writing course where everyone has to do the exact same things in the exact same order. You don’t have to write a specific essay during the program or anything like that. We aim at independent and entrepreneurial people who already have specific goals and ambitions. And we want to be in a position where we have a broad curriculum that can support all of that.\n\n**Plus, having a “one size fits all” program would result in growing an army of clones writing about the same things with the same style. Can you tell me more about how you ensure to adapt to each person’s personality and authenticity?**\n\nThe truth is, a big part of the program is about psychology. Like most creators, our fellows face common issues such as procrastination, lack of motivation, imposter syndrome or being scared to show their work publicly. Some of them don’t really need to be taught how to write as they are already great at this, even though there’s always room for improvement. Their most urgent need is support, so that they can get over their fears and have the courage to write about that topic that scares them.\n\nI like to draw the comparison with the Founder Fellowship, as it’s very uncommon for an entrepreneur to start a company and then the startup fails because they just procrastinate and don’t get any work done. But that’s comparatively a very common failure mode among creators, even for experienced writers. A huge part of what we’re doing at On Deck is to create a comfortable environment for people to do what they’re good at.\n\nWe also want the program to be a really exploratory space. The fact that we’re not pushing everyone towards one defined outcome is actually a great opportunity to explore. I love nothing more than seeing someone who comes into the program to develop their blog, let’s say about the great economic competition between the US and China, and eventually decides to start an essay about their experience raising a family after seeing some other fellows writing very personal stuff. It doesn’t mean they’re going to stop writing about economics, but it’s a way to be able to stretch their wings and kind of get their creative juices going.\n\n**At the moment, the curriculum is mainly designed for people who are building an audience. But I guess that you could extend it to a lot of areas such as publishing, screenwriting, journalism, or even music. How would you personally want to see the Writer Fellowship evolve?**\n\nIt’s definitely something that we think about. The good news is that we’ve attracted people working on several of these areas among our fellows. It’s very likely that within a year or two we’ll have dedicated programs for some of these topics.\n\nThe only thing is that we want to create programs that can legitimately help a lot of people succeed. I’ll take an example from my background as an aspiring fiction writer to illustrate what we wouldn’t do. So I’ve taken a lot of writing workshops in my life. Last summer, I was attending one in New York. Everyone in this workshop was trying to become a novelist. But when I looked around, I couldn’t help but think that no one here was ever going to be a published author. I’m not making any judgments but I’ve had the feeling that what these workshops are really selling is the opportunity to believe in the dream for a few hours a week.\n\nSo, would we ever start an On Deck fellowship to help people try to get a publishing deal? Well, almost certainly not since publishing is kind of a dying industry. Actually, one of the best ways to get published these days is to grow an audience and then leverage that into a book deal. But having a program focused on succeeding in traditional publishing would be like selling a pipe dream that the vast majority of people couldn’t achieve. It would be unethical taking people’s money knowing that the vast majority of them are never going to get there.\n\nOne interesting fact about our fellows is that they haven’t joined On Deck because they think that we’ll help them build a paid publication that will provide them 100% of their income. Rather, they see the fellowship as an opportunity to explore, to supercharge their career by writing about the topics they’re interested in, to connect with a broader network to boost their personal brand, and sometimes to make some money on the side. But those are all very achievable goals we can help them with.\n\n**That’s a very honest approach. I was simply curious about this possible evolution when I’ve noticed that you have someone in the first cohort who writes poetry.**\n\nYou’re referencing [Alysia Harris](http://alysiaharris.com/), a fellow who’s an award-winning poet and an incredible artist. She helped us learn a fantastic lesson during the first cohort. The vast majority of people in the program are primarily writing nonfiction. Yet we had several creative workshops, one or two about poetry, and what we actually realized was that even if you’re primarily writing nonfiction, you can get a ton of value out of doing a poetry workshop. You’re probably not going to just start being a poet. But they can be a great way to think more creatively and kind of get out of your rut. And the responses we got to these creative workshops have been very enthusiastic!\n\n**You’re preaching to the converted (laughs). I’m personally convinced that diversifying what you read and write on is key to find and sharpen your own style. Your ideas made me think of **[**another interview I had with Li Jin**](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/cKbvFpq0mV_-E0gM4GKmk8w-CYrKZF8ByC1nN2xm07E)** last October. **[**Her thesis**](https://www.atelierventures.co/thesis)** on the passion economy is essential to figure out what’s to come for creators. So I was wondering: how do you envision the future of writing?**\n\nI think we’re at a really interesting inflection point for writing. While many of the traditional industries and mediums are suffering, people read and write today more than ever before. This is really exciting, with both a lot of opportunity and peril.\n\nFirst, I think that people are too often too quick to view writing or other forms of creation with a binary viewpoint: either they’re trying to make it a full-time job or it’ll just be a hobby. But there’s a lot of space in between. For instance, I know someone who works in grocery logistics and writes a blog about the industry, which helped him get better career opportunities that he couldn’t have had otherwise.\n\nAlso, I’m a huge believer in Li’s approach of the passion economy. But like most things on the Internet, I think it’s going to end up forming a power law distribution. Substack is a great opportunity for independent writers, yet most people are never going to be able to support themselves entirely through a paid publication. I believe that many writers will follow the trajectory a lot of musicians have taken. The latter have started to think of themselves as products and monetized features like live touring, merchandising, private events, crowdfunding, etc. What I’d advise writers is to take a holistic view and figure out how they can bundle or unbundle what they have to offer. So the question is not about whether going full-time but about having multiple sources of income.\n\nIn some ways, that can be a depressing vision when you think that there was a much larger group of people making a living as full-time writers in 1960 than there is now. But let’s not forget that these people were pretty much all white men who came from elite universities.\n\n**And this is a very important point. But the new platforms have yet to prove that they can reverse this situation. To end up on a more personal touch: what are your writing projects right now?**\n\nI write a weekly email newsletter called [My Super Secret Diary](http://mysupersecretdiary.com/). I present it as a publication about “startups, literature, philosophy, American history, sex & drugs, and how to be alive,” but it’s really just about whatever I feel like writing about. It keeps me practicing and sharing my thoughts with what I like to call my “minimum viable audience”. I’m positive that it won’t be my only writing project for long, but for now running the On Deck Writer Fellowship is a pretty busy dream job (laughs).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*efXaixTZEeM7BIhHS5Y7eQ.gif)\n\n### **5 resources on writing curated by Max:**\n\n*   [**George Orwell’s Six Rules for Writing:**](https://infusion.media/blog/george-orwells-six-rules-for-writing/) “Classic tips from a master from his essay *Politics and the English Language*”.\n*   [**What I Did Not Learn About Writing in School, by Eugene Wan:**](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-did-not-learn-about-writing-in-school/) “A bunch of excellent tips, including some great advice on figuring out what to write about — *you don’t find your niche; your niche finds you*.”\n*   [***On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft*, by Stephen King:**](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816) “I’m not even really much of a Stephen King fan, but this is one of the best books about writing ever written.”\n*   [**Five Short Stories by Lydia Davis:**](https://fivedials.com/fiction/five-short-stories/) “These are works of (very) short fiction, not articles “about” writing, but Lydia Davis is a master of the craft and you’ll learn a ton about what’s possible from reading her.”\n*   [**Julian Shapiro’s Writing Handbook**](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro)**:** “It’s amazing that one person can write so many useful guides about so many different topics, but somehow Julian Shapiro’s done it.”\n\n\n### Read my other interviews:\n\n- **[The emerging Internet Renaissance, with Patrick Rivera](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/BoEyMiW_B2DoUZlFNKdfXRn59goHfrsPwvdM8KiLhb4)**\n- **[Following the right rabbit holes, with Sari Azout](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/VclwDqX-nSxzQTeJnJCTyMkzsvP_IJxwomzUaOYmq1k)**\n- **[Pioneering the Passion Economy, with Li Jin](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/cKbvFpq0mV_-E0gM4GKmk8w-CYrKZF8ByC1nN2xm07E)**\n- **[Building a New School for the Mind, with Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/GD03ufsBOrDkKjO9psSLro0PEqC64So_t_uC39N20Hs)**\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1624566960, "digest": "9GZm-IGk-oL_OmxsLHl_fEApuZd3a5NkaITLS7jJ3ck", "contributor": "0xb18501548Eeb4660c2348A75515e2740041999F6"}

Her company *[*Ness Labs*](https://nesslabs.com/)* has become an impressive library documenting her many experiments between creativity, productivity and neuroscience. The good news is that you’re all invited to learn more about her journey.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1424/1\\*GcqUIPoP0gA4CBxoq6T25Q.png)\n\n**Hi Anne-Laure and thank you for agreeing to come back for the first anniversary of the newsletter. A year ago, you chose to put writing back at the center of your life, between the creation of your **[**Maker Mind newsletter**](https://nesslabs.com/newsletter)** and almost daily publications for your company blog Ness Labs. So to start, can you tell me more about the benefits this new habit has brought to your life?**\n\nWhen I started in July 2019, I published one article a day during the workweek — taking the weekend off to rest. Since November 2019, when I reached my goal of [100 articles in 100 days](https://nesslabs.com/100-articles-100-days), I have been writing three articles and one newsletter per week. I have seen changes on three levels, starting with an effect on my creativity. It has completely changed the way I produce content. Today, I write as soon as I find an interesting idea to exploit, whereas it used to take me several weeks to research and rework topics. Writing has become a very important tool to develop my ideas and share them. It has also opened the doors to several communities and inspired me to create one of my own. Beyond a newsletter with 20,000 subscribers, Maker Mind now connects more than [600 curious minds](https://nesslabs.com/membership), trying like me to understand how the human brain works. Writing is how all these encounters happened, and how I connected with people I never imagined I would have access to one day. Which brings me to my last point: the many professional opportunities and collaboration requests I have received around themes that I am passionate about.\n\n**I will come back later on to the community aspect of Maker Mind. Before that, I want to know more about the links you do between writing and creativity. Can you explain to me how this synergy between the two materialized for you?**\n\nWhen you have a certain number of articles a week to produce, you can’t count on a whimsical muse to inspire you on demand. So to avoid the blank page syndrome, I had to set up creative systems. The first version was simply to get into the habit of writing down on a mobile app any idea I might have during the day. It’s like planting a seed of creativity every time you hear or read something interesting. And it worked very well for me for several months. Only I felt like I didn’t go far enough after a while: I took each idea separately, so I was leaving a lot of creative opportunities on the table.\n\n**And that’s when you discovered Roam Research!**\n\nExactly. I discovered [Roam](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research) in January 2020 and immediately thought it was the perfect tool to take things to the next level. Beyond allowing you to list your ideas in a linear fashion like a classic note-taking application, Roam proactively helps you connect them together. This principle of generating new and original ideas from the combination of several ideas has a name: [idea sex](https://nesslabs.com/inspiration-to-idea-sex) (or “combinational creativity”). That’s when I realized that my previous creativity system didn’t work as well, and I switched all my notes to Roam.\n\n**I’ve always wanted to try Roam, but I think its apparent complexity intimidated me for a while. Can you explain to me how you use it on a daily basis?**\n\nI know that the concept of combinational creativity may seem intimidating at first sight, but there is really nothing complicated about my use of Roam. First of all, I still jot down all my ideas on the fly in my mobile app when I’m on the go. Then, I set aside some time each day to open Roam and create a page for each idea — which I will detail as much as I can so that I can remember them accurately over the long term. Then I’ll take time to think about the potential links between my new ideas and the ones I’ve already noted. One of Roam’s key features is the ability to create links between all your ideas — which its algorithm can also suggest to you. Not only does it push you to follow interesting thinking trails, but the tool will also lead you to uncover surprising connections you wouldn’t have thought of otherwise. Finally, I also use Roam for what is called [interstitial journaling](https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling). It consists of taking a moment to document your thoughts between tasks. For example, I’ll go to Roam after our conversation and write down everything that came to mind during the interview. It’s basically a continuous [brain dump](https://nesslabs.com/productive-cognitive-load). It allows me to not worry about forgetting random insights when it’s not the priority of the moment, and to be able to come back to these later. So I use Roam as both a tool for creativity and productivity. In fact, it’s by far the tool that has had the most significant impact on my life, both for my professional work and personal well-being.\n\n**Well, I really need to give it a try then (laughs). And so, you’ve written over two hundred articles and about fifty editions of your newsletter in the last year thanks to your creativity system. Then I was wondering how you go about choosing the order in which you’re going to write particular topics. Basically, do you have an editorial schedule defined beforehand that follows a certain logic?**\n\nAbsolutely not. My creative system encourages me to proactively take notes, write and connect ideas every day. Beyond that, I don’t try to control anything else. There’s really an experimental part to it, in the sense that I never know in advance what I’m going to write about — and therefore the order in which I’m going to tackle the ideas in my creativity inbox. Rigid schedules are not my thing. I like to keep the flexibility to let ideas emerge at any time and to be able to follow the trail whenever one of them piques my curiosity.\n\n**That reminds me of your recent publication on **[**the different types of note-taking applications**](https://nesslabs.com/how-to-choose-the-right-note-taking-app)** grouped into three types of approaches: those of the architect, the librarian and the gardener.**\n\nDefinitely. In this case, I have more of a gardener’s approach. There are two classic mistakes I’ve identified when talking to other people about these note-taking tools. The first one is to choose a system that doesn’t fit your creative style. If you have messy style, with ideas that come from all over the place, you don’t need to force yourself to adopt an architect’s approach. And all the more so because there is no system that is superior to another. There’s no problem with not being very orderly in your way of thinking, quite the contrary. In this situation, the gardener’s approach can help you make the most of your creative style. The second mistake is to think that you can’t deviate from the category you are in. Personally, I find myself to be more comfortable in a gardener’s system, but I also have affinities with the librarian’s approach. Depending on the situation, I’ll borrow from one or the other. Sometimes I even ask architects for advice to help me solve a problem that lends itself to it. So there’s nothing absolute: what is so great in this metaphorical classification is that it consists in knowing yourself better, so that you can build a system that is truly yours and can evolve with you.\n\n**I have this feeling that you truly live and experience what you write about. This is as true when you talk about the concepts and practices resulting from your creative system or when you openly share certain vulnerabilities. As if Maker Mind was a very intellectual approach to the diary exercise. So I was wondering: what was the biggest discovery you’ve made about yourself since you resumed writing?**\n\nFirst, you’re right about the experimental aspect of my work. That’s why I called my company Ness Labs: it’s my little lab and Maker Mind is my research diary. To come back to your question, I used to think I found my home in the tech world’s hustle and bustle. But in the past year, I realized that I really enjoyed the research and reflection process as well. I love working in a team, but I rediscovered the pleasure of being alone, digging into complex topics, and connecting ideas. When I was a child, my parents could leave me alone with my nose in the books all afternoon without me moving an inch. Writing somehow reconciled me with my inner bookworm (laughs).\n\n**That’s so nicely put (laughs)! We’ve covered the topics of creativity and productivity, and now I’d like to talk about what I consider the third pillar of Maker Mind: mental health. How has writing impacted this aspect in your life?**\n\nNote-taking and especially interstitial journaling allow me to identify warning signs of burnout. I experienced burnout in the past and the problem is that I could resist for a very long time without breaking down until it was too late. Today, I am able to act upstream by making decisions and adapting new strategies to prevent it from happening again.\n\n**I had just read **[**in your interview with Dan Shipper from Superorganizers**](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-anne-laure-le-cunff-wrote-200)** that burnout was a real starting point in the creation of Maker Mind. And I just wanted to ask you if you felt you had “cracked the code” of your personal balance or if you still felt at risk despite everything you put in place?**\n\nI don’t think it’s possible to “crack the code” like you say. On the other hand, I now have a much healthier relationship with my mental health. In particular, I have learned to accept that there are external stressors over which I have no control. Like many people, the lockdown has been a trying time for me. Even though I have found a system that works, I am no more able than anyone else to thrive without leaving my home for months. Twice this year, I announced to my readers that there would not be a weekly newsletter following difficult personal moments. Taking care of one’s mental health also means listening to oneself and knowing how to reconsider one’s priorities, with the guiding principle: “be kind to yourself”.\n\n**This year is also special in the sense that we have never talked about mental health as much as in 2020. Did the lockdown and all the news around Covid-19 influence your way of writing on the subject?**\n\nI have always talked about “mindful productivity” to put the emphasis on fulfillment rather than only focusing on goals and performance indicators. Among my readers, there are a lot of very ambitious, very passionate people who tend to work a lot. And indeed, this year’s context has made me insist in my articles on the idea that it’s more important than ever to accept that it’s not always possible to be productive, to also learn how to take the time to breathe and to reconcile with the idea of letting go.\n\n**During the confinement, you went further in this respect by creating a \\[paid] community around Maker Mind. What motivated you to go in that direction?**\n\nTo be very transparent with you, I started the community at a time when I was looking to generate recurring revenue with Ness Labs. It’s a healthy business model for the company, aligned with my values and the ones of my readers. It gives them the opportunity to meet each other, help each other, and move forward together in achieving their life goals. For my part, it allows me to focus on creating high value-added content and to get to know my community better.\n\n**Personally, I have the impression that building a community is more difficult to evaluate in terms of time invested than creating content. Since we were talking about burnout earlier, how do you make sure that it doesn’t become a time-consuming activity next to everything you already do with Maker Mind and Ness Labs?**\n\nTo tell the truth, I didn’t have to set any strict rules and there is nothing stressful about running this community. I’m fortunate to be surrounded by very emotionally intelligent members, some of whom have been following me for a while. I participate every week but I don’t have to force myself to do it. In fact, no one expects me to be available 24 hours a day to answer their questions. It’s a very calm community, not in the sense that nothing happens but because everyone respects each other’s time. I am very happy to see the members interact with each other without having to ask for my permission. For example, I think it’s great to see some members organizing working or writing sessions every day.\n\n**Paid communities are becoming more common for content creators to monetize their projects. Do you think it’s become a must to make a living from your writings?**\n\nThere are many counter-examples, with very high quality paid publications without a community component behind them. So I would say… not necessarily. Still, starting a community opens up many opportunities to better understand your audience and their needs. Personally, I’m very happy to have chosen to take Ness Labs in this direction. While I don’t see it as a prerequisite, I tend to encourage content creators to explore this path.\n\n**In addition to having a community to run and your fast pace of publishing, you also went back to school for a Master’s degree in Neuroscience. What was your initial goal and how did it evolve with the development of your activity?**\n\nWhen I started, I really saw the Master’s degree as a personal need. I wanted to study the inner workings of the human brain. In a way, writing about it helped me consolidate my learning. What I studied in class was often the starting point for reflections in my articles. What I didn’t expect was for this personal curiosity to quickly turn into a real business with Ness Labs.\n\n**I’ve learned that your longer-term vision for Ness Labs is actually a school. I guess going back to class must have inspired you in that respect as well. In fact, I feel like the pieces of the puzzle are coming together very quickly, between everything you’ve got on Roam, all the educational content published this year, and a fast-growing paid community. So when you think about it, Ness Labs already looks a lot like a school. What are the priorities you want to develop for the future?**\n\nI’m fascinated by new models of education. I also find that there are a lot of topics that are not covered in a traditional school and that I think should be covered in a traditional school. Today, nothing that is taught in schools is adapted to the level of demand, self-reflection, flexibility, and also stress that the new work models bring about. That’s why I want to create an alternative education model, with a flexible and decentralized system that would allow everyone to enrich their way of thinking, creating and working. Today, there is already a lot of material on Ness Labs and you can actually dig into many subjects on your own. But I want to create a collection of courses that would explore these topics in depth over several weeks. These would cover topics like developing your creativity or managing your mental health at work, all based on neuroscience. This kind of curriculum is the brick that Ness Labs is currently missing and that I want to add to the edifice.\n\n**What are the new educational models that inspire you the most?**\n\nThere is of course Lambda School, which a lot of people have been following closely over the last few years. More recently, I’ve been particularly interested in On Deck, which brings education and community together better than anyone else. It’s a system of cohorts divided into several fellowships for founders, angels, but also writers and podcast hosts. And what is very powerful in this model is all the possible encounters, synergies and collaborations between individuals, cohorts and fellowships. A member of the writing fellowship will be able to help his cohort’s entrepreneurs with content strategy; these entrepreneurs will be able to receive investments from angels from previous cohorts; and so on. I am very curious to see how these community-based educational models will evolve.\n\n**For your part, you’ve already created a lot of educational content that covers a wide range of topics. Is there a particular one you haven’t written about yet that you would like to explore further?**\n\nOne topic I’ve already touched on but I’m very keen to explore further is ideation; where do ideas come from and how do they form in our brains? It’s all the more fascinating because there are several research streams. Some people have a rather analytical approach to ideation, approaching a problem from all angles to develop new ideas. Others have more of an “aha” moment or [shower thoughts](https://nesslabs.com/mind-wandering). I really want to understand what is going on in the brain at this level and to know if there are ways to increase our capacity for ideation. Right now, I am reading a fascinating and accessible [research paper](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.northwestern.edu/dist/a/699/files/2015/11/The-cognitive-neuroscience-of-insight-1jie1hg.pdf) on the subject by John Kounios, a neuroscience researcher. It’s a topic I’m looking forward to writing about.\n\n**And I’m already looking forward to reading it! We’re coming to the end of this new interview that I’ve been waiting for a long time. And what a journey since our first conversation! I’m both admiring and impressed by your evolution and that of Ness Labs. I will continue to follow all this closely, and probably also get into Roam for good (laughs). So thanks again, Anne-Laure!**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1\\*feAC0AW5qV57-aYtpOroyA.gif)\n\n### 5 concepts worth exploring, according to Anne-Laure:\n\n*   [The Dunning–Kruger effect](https://nesslabs.com/dunning-kruger-effect)\n*   [Thinking in maps](https://nesslabs.com/thinking-in-maps)\n*   [Mind garden](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden)\n*   [The planning fallacy](https://nesslabs.com/planning-fallacy)\n*   [Thinking inside the box](https://nesslabs.com/systematic-inventive-thinking-inside-the-box)\n\n\n### Read my other interviews:\n\n- **[The emerging Internet Renaissance, with Patrick Rivera](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/BoEyMiW_B2DoUZlFNKdfXRn59goHfrsPwvdM8KiLhb4)**\n- **[Following the right rabbit holes, with Sari Azout](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/VclwDqX-nSxzQTeJnJCTyMkzsvP_IJxwomzUaOYmq1k)**\n- **[Choose your own writing adventure, with Max Nussenbaum](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/9GZm-IGk-oL_OmxsLHl_fEApuZd3a5NkaITLS7jJ3ck)**\n- **[Pioneering the Passion Economy, with Li Jin](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/cKbvFpq0mV_-E0gM4GKmk8w-CYrKZF8ByC1nN2xm07E)**\n", "timestamp": 1624566786, "digest": "GD03ufsBOrDkKjO9psSLro0PEqC64So_t_uC39N20Hs", "contributor": "0xb18501548Eeb4660c2348A75515e2740041999F6"}

However, investing—like many of today’s societal systems—often overlooks underrepresented communities that deserve the capital, resources, and support they need to participate in the development and economic prosperity of new industries and technologies like crypto.\n\nBut what if underrepresented communities and their allies could more easily organize human and financial capital to invest in projects and people that mattered to them and the diverse world we live in? What if by investing more capital into underrepresented communities, we could dramatically accelerate progress in diversity, inclusion, and equity globally?\n\n**We believe that this is the future: underrepresented communities and their allies will be able to more easily coordinate human and financial capital to invest in building the world we all live in—and in the process, economically empower their communities in ways that today’s societal systems are failing to do at scale.**\n\nAnd all of this will be enabled at scale across the internet by DAOs.\n\n## Seeking Mission-Driven Investors\n\nWe’re pioneering state-of-the-art Decentralized Finance (DeFi), DAO, and cryptosocial technologies at Syndicate, and we’re applying them to democratize investing and bring radical new models for investing to the world that are fundamentally more open, free, and fair.\n\nIf you’re an mission-driven investor who wants to back underrepresented founders and communities, [reach out to us](mailto:hello@syndicateprotocol.org), as we’re working with a diverse network of pioneers to reshape our world, for all.\n\n[Follow Us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SyndicateDAO)\n[Sign Up for the Private Beta](https://syndicateprotocol.org)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3174)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3631)\n\n", "timestamp": 1624568601, "digest": "xeRR8PJUnGr-mUlwLJppFHe65WPpyyULFBiz89K1qfI", "contributor": "0x66B340673fcE10bd3bFbbe59997Ae188a16b6710"}

I had a great time talking about the future of writing with such a charismatic polymath. Here is our interview. Enjoy the read!*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1446/1\\*I4a6OzoG6vGyA-\\_-E3BJQg.png)\n\n**Nice to meet you Max, and a huge thank you for accepting this interview! Let’s start with your background: you’ve been alternatively a startup operator, a founder and a freelancer in product, design and software engineering. You’ve also been the coauthor of a business book, **[***Oversubscribed***](https://oversubscribed.club/)**. So I was wondering: why writing? And how did it come to your life among so many interests?**\n\nI’ve been interested in writing for as long as I can remember, even before I have conscious memories. I still have stories I wrote when I was in second grade. Then I went to school for writing and I was a creative writing major. I also wrote a musical in college, and later a book of short stories. So I really thought I was going to be a writer.\n\nBut when I graduated, I realized that becoming a full-time writer didn’t necessarily look the way I’d have imagined. The fact is, I didn’t want to work alone and I wanted my job to be as collaborative as possible. So I ended up making a really sort of unexpected jump into startups. I worked in the tech industry and I started a real estate company that had a classic Silicon Valley rise and fall. But writing was still a big part of my life, mainly through side projects.\n\nI also found that a lot of the skills I was drawing on as a founder were, in some way or another, related to writing. A lot of what I was doing was telling stories, whether it was telling our customers the story of our product, selling our vision to investors or crafting the story of our company. Eventually, I was offered the opportunity to join On Deck and build out the Writer Fellowship last year.\n\n**Such a dream job for you! How did this opportunity happen?**\n\nThis actually ties to my practice of writing. I’ve been friends with [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg), the founder of On Deck, for almost a decade. We both started our careers in Detroit and we bonded over writing. We did a little bit of a writing group together and we both attended a book club that was infamous for only lasting one meeting (laughs). We stayed friends over the years and kept in touch through writing online. When he was thinking about launching the Writer Fellowship, he asked if I wanted to be involved and I eventually said yes.\n\nThis perfectly illustrates one of the reasons why I think that ambitious people should write online. Thanks to my writing, Erik was still able to sort of follow my journey from afar. And when he reached out to me, it wasn’t like we had to spend hours catching up on all the stuff that had happened.\n\n**I agree with you: writing creates a special bond with your readers, which can definitely bring serendipity into your life. And I have the feeling that this is exactly what On Deck is about. So let’s talk about it further! I tend to consider On Deck as an elite program since the endgame is to train the next generation of world-class talents in areas like entrepreneurship, angel investing, content creation, along with healthcare and climate. However, you seem committed to the idea of making your programs accessible to all, as initiatives like your **[**Access Fund**](https://www.beondeck.com/post/access-fund)** show it. But beyond that, how do you balance selectivity and diversity?**\n\nWe have two missions that could seem contradictory at first. One is broadening access and believing that talent can come from anywhere. And as you mentioned, the second is to build a community of world-class talent.\n\nSo the first layer of what we’re doing to expand access is to create a global remote-first community — what some people call the “Silicon Valley in the cloud”. Our goal is to move away from the days when you needed to be living in a specific place to be part of a certain community.\n\nThe second angle is about the journey at On Deck. Every program may be competitive, some are definitely harder to get into than others. For instance, the Founder Fellowship is one of the most difficult to get into. But there’s more than one path to join On Deck. Suppose you might want to start a company someday but don’t necessarily have an idea yet. Well, the Writer or Podcaster Fellowships are more accessible programs that will help you start honing and developing your ideas in the public sphere. And since you’ll be an On Deck Fellow for the rest of your life, it’ll likely be easier to join the Founder Fellowship when you’re ready. If your company takes off, you’ll then have the opportunity to send your employees into other programs such as the First 50 or the Chief of Staff Fellowships.\n\nWhen selecting our future fellows among applicants, we’re asking ourselves two things. First, can we help this person succeed according to their own goals? Second, would this person be a great community member according to our [guiding values](https://www.beondeck.com/guiding-values)? Beyond the programs, On Deck is about giving back, whether it’s with time, knowledge or support. This is why community is a core part of what we’re building.\n\n**I love this “choose your own adventure” approach between the different programs! Can you tell me more about how the different Fellowships communicate with each other?**\n\nWe’re very intentional about making sure that every fellowship has a connection to the others so that they overall make the whole network stronger. Our vision has always been about enabling entrepreneurship. And we view entrepreneurship as something that’s defined much more broadly than this very narrow slice of Silicon Valley that too many people often focus on.\n\nWe tend to forget that writers and podcasters do build products, connect with an audience and create communities. They’re entrepreneurs too! Having a successful writing practice actually involves a lot of skills other than just putting words together. Beyond writing, you need to understand the basics of growth, branding and distribution for instance. And I think it’s much more stimulating to learn all these things within a community of peers than on your own. This is a big part of the thesis behind the Writer Fellowship.\n\nAlso, we are building *one* global community, not just siloed fellowships. And so we do a number of things to enable the fellows from different programs to interact. In February, we’ll have our first ever Global Build Weekend. The goal is to make people from different fellowships collaborate on teams. For instance, I’m looking forward to seeing the next cohort of writers learn the fundamentals of visual branding from the design fellows. In return, they will have the opportunity to teach them some storytelling and copywriting techniques.\n\n**I assume that a program such as the Writer Fellowship must be very tied to your own personality. How did you bring it to the curriculum?**\n\nThat’s a great question! The Writer Fellowship was basically the first program launched after the Founder Fellowship. So I’ve helped a lot of the other program directors who have been launching new fellowships after me.\n\nOne of the things I’d really emphasize is that your program just inevitably takes on your own personality. When your product is an interactive experience within a community, there’s such a direct emotional connection between you and the “customers”. As program directors, we are lucky to have a lot of freedom to shape our curriculum as we wish. And my personal belief is that it’s all about the small things, from the music I choose when introducing a speaker to the dumb jokes I make in my presentations.\n\nOur approach is very bottom-up and not “one size fits all”. It’s not a ten-step writing course where everyone has to do the exact same things in the exact same order. You don’t have to write a specific essay during the program or anything like that. We aim at independent and entrepreneurial people who already have specific goals and ambitions. And we want to be in a position where we have a broad curriculum that can support all of that.\n\n**Plus, having a “one size fits all” program would result in growing an army of clones writing about the same things with the same style. Can you tell me more about how you ensure to adapt to each person’s personality and authenticity?**\n\nThe truth is, a big part of the program is about psychology. Like most creators, our fellows face common issues such as procrastination, lack of motivation, imposter syndrome or being scared to show their work publicly. Some of them don’t really need to be taught how to write as they are already great at this, even though there’s always room for improvement. Their most urgent need is support, so that they can get over their fears and have the courage to write about that topic that scares them.\n\nI like to draw the comparison with the Founder Fellowship, as it’s very uncommon for an entrepreneur to start a company and then the startup fails because they just procrastinate and don’t get any work done. But that’s comparatively a very common failure mode among creators, even for experienced writers. A huge part of what we’re doing at On Deck is to create a comfortable environment for people to do what they’re good at.\n\nWe also want the program to be a really exploratory space. The fact that we’re not pushing everyone towards one defined outcome is actually a great opportunity to explore. I love nothing more than seeing someone who comes into the program to develop their blog, let’s say about the great economic competition between the US and China, and eventually decides to start an essay about their experience raising a family after seeing some other fellows writing very personal stuff. It doesn’t mean they’re going to stop writing about economics, but it’s a way to be able to stretch their wings and kind of get their creative juices going.\n\n**At the moment, the curriculum is mainly designed for people who are building an audience. But I guess that you could extend it to a lot of areas such as publishing, screenwriting, journalism, or even music. How would you personally want to see the Writer Fellowship evolve?**\n\nIt’s definitely something that we think about. The good news is that we’ve attracted people working on several of these areas among our fellows. It’s very likely that within a year or two we’ll have dedicated programs for some of these topics.\n\nThe only thing is that we want to create programs that can legitimately help a lot of people succeed. I’ll take an example from my background as an aspiring fiction writer to illustrate what we wouldn’t do. So I’ve taken a lot of writing workshops in my life. Last summer, I was attending one in New York. Everyone in this workshop was trying to become a novelist. But when I looked around, I couldn’t help but think that no one here was ever going to be a published author. I’m not making any judgments but I’ve had the feeling that what these workshops are really selling is the opportunity to believe in the dream for a few hours a week.\n\nSo, would we ever start an On Deck fellowship to help people try to get a publishing deal? Well, almost certainly not since publishing is kind of a dying industry. Actually, one of the best ways to get published these days is to grow an audience and then leverage that into a book deal. But having a program focused on succeeding in traditional publishing would be like selling a pipe dream that the vast majority of people couldn’t achieve. It would be unethical taking people’s money knowing that the vast majority of them are never going to get there.\n\nOne interesting fact about our fellows is that they haven’t joined On Deck because they think that we’ll help them build a paid publication that will provide them 100% of their income. Rather, they see the fellowship as an opportunity to explore, to supercharge their career by writing about the topics they’re interested in, to connect with a broader network to boost their personal brand, and sometimes to make some money on the side. But those are all very achievable goals we can help them with.\n\n**That’s a very honest approach. I was simply curious about this possible evolution when I’ve noticed that you have someone in the first cohort who writes poetry.**\n\nYou’re referencing [Alysia Harris](http://alysiaharris.com/), a fellow who’s an award-winning poet and an incredible artist. She helped us learn a fantastic lesson during the first cohort. The vast majority of people in the program are primarily writing nonfiction. Yet we had several creative workshops, one or two about poetry, and what we actually realized was that even if you’re primarily writing nonfiction, you can get a ton of value out of doing a poetry workshop. You’re probably not going to just start being a poet. But they can be a great way to think more creatively and kind of get out of your rut. And the responses we got to these creative workshops have been very enthusiastic!\n\n**You’re preaching to the converted (laughs). I’m personally convinced that diversifying what you read and write on is key to find and sharpen your own style. Your ideas made me think of **[**another interview I had with Li Jin**](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/cKbvFpq0mV_-E0gM4GKmk8w-CYrKZF8ByC1nN2xm07E)** last October. **[**Her thesis**](https://www.atelierventures.co/thesis)** on the passion economy is essential to figure out what’s to come for creators. So I was wondering: how do you envision the future of writing?**\n\nI think we’re at a really interesting inflection point for writing. While many of the traditional industries and mediums are suffering, people read and write today more than ever before. This is really exciting, with both a lot of opportunity and peril.\n\nFirst, I think that people are too often too quick to view writing or other forms of creation with a binary viewpoint: either they’re trying to make it a full-time job or it’ll just be a hobby. But there’s a lot of space in between. For instance, I know someone who works in grocery logistics and writes a blog about the industry, which helped him get better career opportunities that he couldn’t have had otherwise.\n\nAlso, I’m a huge believer in Li’s approach of the passion economy. But like most things on the Internet, I think it’s going to end up forming a power law distribution. Substack is a great opportunity for independent writers, yet most people are never going to be able to support themselves entirely through a paid publication. I believe that many writers will follow the trajectory a lot of musicians have taken. The latter have started to think of themselves as products and monetized features like live touring, merchandising, private events, crowdfunding, etc. What I’d advise writers is to take a holistic view and figure out how they can bundle or unbundle what they have to offer. So the question is not about whether going full-time but about having multiple sources of income.\n\nIn some ways, that can be a depressing vision when you think that there was a much larger group of people making a living as full-time writers in 1960 than there is now. But let’s not forget that these people were pretty much all white men who came from elite universities.\n\n**And this is a very important point. But the new platforms have yet to prove that they can reverse this situation. To end up on a more personal touch: what are your writing projects right now?**\n\nI write a weekly email newsletter called [My Super Secret Diary](http://mysupersecretdiary.com/). I present it as a publication about “startups, literature, philosophy, American history, sex & drugs, and how to be alive,” but it’s really just about whatever I feel like writing about. It keeps me practicing and sharing my thoughts with what I like to call my “minimum viable audience”. I’m positive that it won’t be my only writing project for long, but for now running the On Deck Writer Fellowship is a pretty busy dream job (laughs).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*efXaixTZEeM7BIhHS5Y7eQ.gif)\n\n### **5 resources on writing curated by Max:**\n\n*   [**George Orwell’s Six Rules for Writing:**](https://infusion.media/blog/george-orwells-six-rules-for-writing/) “Classic tips from a master from his essay *Politics and the English Language*”.\n*   [**What I Did Not Learn About Writing in School, by Eugene Wan:**](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-did-not-learn-about-writing-in-school/) “A bunch of excellent tips, including some great advice on figuring out what to write about — *you don’t find your niche; your niche finds you*.”\n*   [***On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft*, by Stephen King:**](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816) “I’m not even really much of a Stephen King fan, but this is one of the best books about writing ever written.”\n*   [**Five Short Stories by Lydia Davis:**](https://fivedials.com/fiction/five-short-stories/) “These are works of (very) short fiction, not articles “about” writing, but Lydia Davis is a master of the craft and you’ll learn a ton about what’s possible from reading her.”\n*   [**Julian Shapiro’s Writing Handbook**](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro)**:** “It’s amazing that one person can write so many useful guides about so many different topics, but somehow Julian Shapiro’s done it.”\n\n\n### Read my other interviews:\n\n- **[The emerging Internet Renaissance, with Patrick Rivera](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/BoEyMiW_B2DoUZlFNKdfXRn59goHfrsPwvdM8KiLhb4)**\n- **[Following the right rabbit holes, with Sari Azout](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/VclwDqX-nSxzQTeJnJCTyMkzsvP_IJxwomzUaOYmq1k)**\n- **[Pioneering the Passion Economy, with Li Jin](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/cKbvFpq0mV_-E0gM4GKmk8w-CYrKZF8ByC1nN2xm07E)**\n- **[Building a New School for the Mind, with Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/GD03ufsBOrDkKjO9psSLro0PEqC64So_t_uC39N20Hs)**\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1624606183, "digest": "9GZm-IGk-oL_OmxsLHl_fEApuZd3a5NkaITLS7jJ3ck", "contributor": "0xb18501548Eeb4660c2348A75515e2740041999F6"}
{"id": "n-H7ih9aVz7oKcYpilF9dVw_5Wvxne-UO4eNCZMPHys", "title": "Introducing KYVE", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/95b85d5b-1bd6-472d-8049-103981333919.png?height=2160&width=3840)\n\nAfter some intensive programming, integrating, and testing, we are super excited to introduce KYVE!\n\nKYVE is a decentralized archiving and caching solution that allows modern blockchains and decentralized applications (dApps) to store and serve data reliably. Our mission is quite ambitious but necessary: as fierce advocates of Web 3.0, we want to help projects reach infinite scalability by reliably and permanently storing their data.\n\n## Why is data causing scalability issues?\n\nWhile working on different projects in the blockchain industry, we realized that the current state of infrastructure had limitations, especially when it comes to data retrieval.\n\nRetrieving long sequences of data can be burdensome, mainly when elements are computationally dependent on each other or when a stream requires significant computing power and, therefore, is not easy to handle. Synchronization times are a growing point of concern when nodes first enter blockchain networks. For example, synchronizing a full archival node on Ethereum [takes weeks](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/101567/QIAN-THESIS-2018.pdf), as it requires recomputing the entire history of transactions. Without intervention, syncing threatens to become a multi-year endeavor.\n\nAfter analyzing the currently available solutions and consulting many Layer 1 projects, we realized that there was no out-of-the-box solution to solve these problems in a unified manner, even though data is a crucial element of any project. In other words, there were no projects that provided flexible and structured data access on different blockchains without requiring custom development work.\n\n## What is KYVE, and how is it solving these issues?\n\nWith our decentralized archival framework, we offer a unified solution for all blockchain data needs. We standardize, validate, and permanently store any generated data stream. By leveraging Arweave, our solution secures the scalability, immutability, and availability of these resources over time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7052bd29-6e23-45a8-b807-27e82d6fa403.png?height=2204&width=4556)\n\nKYVE is a fully decentralized protocol that can store any kind of data on Arweave\n\nData providers can seamlessly store and verify their data streams by setting up their archiving pool. Each pool is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) powered by [SmartWeave](https://arweave.medium.com/introducing-smartweave-building-smart-contracts-with-arweave-1fc85cb3b632), the Arweave smart contracting language.\n\nUploaders and validators secure the validity of the data inside each pool:\n\n*   Uploaders fetch data from a source and can perform computational work before storing it on Arweave.\n*   Validators determine the integrity of the data and have the ability to vote on the slashing of an uploader’s stake if terms are not respected.\n\nOnce data is stored it can easily be retrieved using KYVE’s query interface, or by accessing it directly in Arweave. KYVE’s validation and Arweave’s immutability, combined, guarantee data integrity towards downstream users.\n\nA pool is funded with $KYVE tokens. By staking and slashing $KYVE tokens, the system ensures participants behave in harmony with the pools’ objectives, punishing misbehavior and rewarding valid entries.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/23f237ad-21ac-447e-a419-980d61d9ac8b.png?height=2051&width=4345)\n\nWith KYVE, anyone can participate in the storage initiatives by funding the pools and depositing $KYVE tokens\n\n## What comes next?\n\nWe reached our first milestone when we successfully launched the Alpha testnet. Therefore, the exciting road to mainnet has started, and we cannot wait to achieve more in the upcoming months. Our roadmap is divided into three major sections:\n\n**Product Refinement**\n\nOur primary focus is to gather as much data and feedback as possible from our users and iterate until obtaining a stabilized and scalable testnet. We want to build the most efficient decentralized middleware of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. We are product-first and we are committed to continuously improving our technology and user experience.\n\n**New partnerships**\n\nWe have successfully partnered with major blockchains such as Cosmos, Polkadot, and Solana, just to name a few. We want to continue to integrate more Layer 1s and Layer 2s throughout the blockchain ecosystem.\n\n**Project Awareness**\n\nHaving a strong community of advocates for open-source technology and decentralization, blockchain developers, and people passionate about the Web 3.0 space is our highest priority for the upcoming months. To achieve it, we will collaborate with our partners to co-create marketing initiatives like Hackathons, Bounties, and other actions that will strengthen the community.\n\n## Want to know more about KYVE?\n\nJoin the discussion on [Telegram](https://t.me/kyvenet) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kD8TBmVBzf), or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KYVEnetwork)!\n", "timestamp": 1624623447, "digest": "GRMirQgr0r8yDeVJ_RKcpZLM8LpljUw2IW8Rdvmu8Jo", "contributor": "0x72Ff7D1dF7D1e4B86886D68605f55ce42ef74624"}
{"id": "96eRBVOfZlSiuhdB5ZhrgKNv35DTJXjoBzIx9I9WyBo", "title": "Why we chose Arweave to support KYVE", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5a8f5208-d400-4022-8e73-6ccc6cbe7ae2.png?height=2000&width=4000)\n\nA few weeks ago, we [introduced](https://kyve.mirror.xyz/GRMirQgr0r8yDeVJ_RKcpZLM8LpljUw2IW8Rdvmu8Jo) KYVE and were genuinely humbled by the fantastic feedback we have received. A common question from the readers was: what is Arweave, and why did we choose this technology as our core infrastructure. Since our community is a unique composition across the many different blockchains that we have integrated, we would love to explain why we decided to go for Arweave as our data storage layer.\n\n## A brief intro of Arweave\n\nArweave developed a unique way for permanently storing data based on their [blockweave](https://arweave.medium.com/what-is-arweave-explain-like-im-five-425362144eb5) technology. When using Arweave as a storage solution, users pay once, and the data stays forever. Arweave bets on storage price: relying on Moore’s Law-style declining data storage costs, the payment essentially allows the data to be stored permanently. For every block mined, a Proof of Access (PoA) process is executed to check that a randomly selected piece of previously stored data is still accessible.\n\nThe Arweave community has also developed its native smart contract framework: SmartWeave. SmartWeave is a client-side system, a major distinction from any other type of smart contract architecture, including the EVM. In short, that frees nodes from validating the code, offloading that burden to each user. The result is that users interacting with smart contracts only have to pay fractions of a cent to use them, though they must re-execute the computations every time. Compared to Ethereum, this is a much less strict limitation.\n\n## Arweave, the backbone of KYVE\n\nDue to its scalability, immutability, and availability, Arweave is the go-to solution for data storage. We believe that our two technologies are complementary: we provide data validity, while Arweave provides us with data availability. Thanks to Arweave, the data can’t disappear, and with KYVE, the stored data can’t be incorrect.\n\n## How KYVE solves the SmartWeave scalability issue\n\nAlthough SmartWeave is highly decentralized, it comes with a significant disadvantage. Its client-side execution leads to scaling issues in the long term. Imagine a contract that has thousands of interactions. Every time a client wants to compute the latest state of a contract, they need to go through every single interaction that has happened before. For huge contracts, this process alone can sometimes take several minutes.\\\nKYVE nodes can compute the latest state for the client and make it available for other users. Securing the uploaded state with staked $KYVE tokens guarantees security and maintains decentralization. Furthermore, this process allows users to retrieve the latest state of any smart contract within seconds.\n\nBesides having innovative and performing technology, the Arweave community is the most supportive, engaging, and passionate community. We have been involved in the Arweave ecosystem for some time now, working on different projects, such as [Verto](https://verto.exchange/app) (a decentralized token exchange protocol) and [ArVerify](https://arverify.org/) (an identity verification solution). These past experiences have strengthened our decision to use Arweave as our data storage layer.

With a healthy dose of skepticism and criticism, the discussion dissected not only how artists can leverage NFTs to gain more ownership over their careers, but also the significant cultural, financial and ethical risks associated with this emerging infrastructure that tend to get overlooked in mainstream music-industry conversations.\n\nThe full recording of the panel is [available on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=451919682566367&ref=watch_permalink), but we also wanted to publish a text recap of the key themes and takeaways here on Mirror.

The word “simulacra” in particular — which refers to the presence of signs and symbols in place of reality — was [popularized first by sociologist Jean Baudrillard](https://web.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html) in the 1980s, then [by the Wachowskis in their renowned film franchise *The Matrix*](https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation).\n\n“Over the last few years, I started to notice signs and symbols replacing all of my realities, which was certainly exacerbated by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic,” said Davies. “But rather than stay with the more dystopian approach that the Wachowskis did with The Matrix, I was more interested in a utopian approach — in building and imagining utopias and new futures, specifically for the music industry.”\n\nThe rapid rise and fall of music NFT hype is a perfect example of people conflating signs and symbols with reality — not just in the literal sense of viewing a JPEG tied to a digital token as equally “authentic” and “real” as the physical world, but also in the metaphorical sense of perpetuating certain myths about how NFTs work and how the artist-fan relationship should look that don’t always line up with the reality of how artists and the music industry operate.\n\n**VÉRITÉ** is an independent artist who has been active in crypto in recent months — most recently selling a portion of master recording royalties for her single “by now” to a fan [in the form of an NFT](https://zora.co/verite/2720). That said, due to current limitations around royalty payments, that revenue split had to be implemented off- rather than on-chain through traditional legal agreements, with the NFT merely acting as an authenticated “purchase receipt” of sorts on top of the song. Other auctions like [Jacques Greene’s “Promise” NFT](https://foundation.app/jacquesgreene/promise-640) and [Lil Dicky’s “Save Dat Money” NFT](https://auctions.royaltyexchange.com/auctions/nft-lil-dickys-save-dat-money-publishing-royalties/) had a similar limitation — i.e. auctioning royalty shares through NFTs, but actually implementing those share agreements through traditional music-industry processes that pay out royalties more slowly.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/2720)\n\nOn this note, during our panel, VÉRITÉ pointed to how two simultaneous conversations were emerging within the music NFT community: “The idealism of what NFTs can be, and the pragmatic and practical reality that we still have to be in relationship with more antiquated systems, especially within the music industry to make that work.” The way in which royalties are collected in particular is a “50-year-old clunky system with a black box that definitely benefits the holders of that black box,” she said.\n\nA sense of pragmatism needs to be considered not only for issues like fractionalized royalty payments, but also for the realities of fan behavior and how everyday people do (or don’t) value culture.\n\nFirst things first: “The masses do not value digital assets,” said VÉRITÉ. “They do not value the MP3. The idea that we’re going to raise the price of a stream beyond 0.004 cents — I don’t believe that is going to happen.” Crypto is also still inaccessible enough such that the vast majority of VÉRITÉ’s fans are not active in that community: “I have probably five fans participating in these things. Until I’m able to issue NFTs with a fiat option and a credit card onboarding ramp, so I can give my fans the experience of owning a digital asset and having them internalize that [experience], they’re not coming over.”\n\nA related misconception in the crypto world is that there is a critical mass of fans who want to act as financial investors in their favorite artists. **Michail Stangl** — who works at [Zora](http://zora.co/) (the protocol that powers Mirror), curates the CTM festival and formerly served as host and lead programmer for Boiler Room — pushed back on this idea that the artist-fan relationship should be financialized in this way by default.\n\n“A future in which every interaction between audiences and musicians is a financial transaction is dystopian to me,” said Stangl. “A lot of spaces that are designing [crypto] technology assume a certain relationship between fans and artists … if your reality is staring at crypto charts all day, you might think my relationship to my favorite artist is one of an investor. But 99% of fans don’t want to handle cultural investment portfolios, tracking which ‘blockchain track’ is the hottest that might create revenue for them if they sell their fractional share. That is not the way we engage with culture.”\n\nIt will take several years to reverse the widespread devaluation of music consumption, which VÉRITÉ suggested is a necessary side effect of overall “market saturation” in music and the fact that “the creation and distribution of music is now fully democratized.” That said, it’s still common knowledge that fans value music in at least some way, even if it’s not reflected in streaming economics.\n\n“They are lovers and consumers of art, and they do want to support the artist — we just need new ways to enable them to give that support,” said VÉRITÉ. “We can add these additional value layers, whether that’s membership to a community, or providing people with an experience that’s bigger than just clicking on something and listening to it.” In this process of devising new means of artist-fan support, this is where it’s important to “center voices who have a pure idealism about what we can build.”\n\n## The myth of NFTs’ speculative value\n\nIndependent artist **Zola Jesus** was one of the more critical voices in our discussion when it came to the current state of crypto in music. In a [previous interview with *Pitchfork*](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/), she had expressed her frustration with the financialization of music NFTs, arguing that the market would only become fair for artists once “the art is being purchased for the merit of what it expresses, rather than what profit it could yield in the future. I don’t want people to bet on me like a racehorse.”\n\n[Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/)\n\nDuring our panel, Zola Jesus expressed similar sentiments. Initially, she said, her impression of NFTs was positive; she had viewed the technology as an antidote for the corporatization of the music industry — particularly for the “disillusionment” she’d experienced while having to navigate “endless corporate structures,” forcing her to “play a game outside of music itself … [Crypto] was a whole new way to create art, and to be able to find homes and support for that art.” \n\nHowever, she quickly became suspicious of the intentions of the buyers of her art, and concerned that her art was just becoming “a means of profiting off speculation.” Rather than representing any real challenge or alternative to mainstream culture, she felt that NFTs in their most hyped-up, auctioned form were simply “further enmeshing us in financial contracts and capitalist frameworks,” with artists being “traded like stocks.” \n\n**Chloe Alexandra Thompson**, who is First Nations (Cree), drew a deeper historical connection between the “cash-grab, transactional rhetoric” around NFTs and “movements around resource extraction and the emergence of new physical colonies on Indigenous land, like mineral mining” (an analogy that is especially relevant given the environmental concerns around proof-of-work blockchains). The end result is an environment where art is merely being “objectified,” rather than “supported and engaged with in a caring way.”\n\nFortunately, the speculative value of NFTs is largely a myth, anyway. For one, the five- to seven-figure auction model has largely fallen out of fashion for music NFTs. According to [research spearheaded by Water & Music](https://www.patreon.com/posts/music-nft-and-2m-46187290), monthly music NFT sales plummeted by 80% from April to May, and is projected to plummet by another 60% to 70% month-over-month in June. Moreover, according to an [economics paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00647.pdf) published by researchers across the U.S. and Europe, under 10% of NFTs that generated a primary sale since 2017 ended up generating a secondary sale within a week, and only 22% generated a secondary sale within a year.\n\n[Music NFT and social token database](https://www.patreon.com/posts/music-nft-and-2m-46187290)\n\nArtist and researcher **Mat Dryhurst** suggested that mainstream media incentives had a lot to do with NFTs’ rise and subsequent fall. In search of sensationalist news, mainstream media outlets automatically navigated towards the six- to eight-figure sales coming out from only a small handful of platforms and actors in the NFT market, even if those outlets had only a rudimentary understanding of how NFTs actually worked. At one point, [even SNL got on board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrNOYudaMAc&ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive).\n\n“Even in a decentralized ecosystem, you don’t get to decide when people choose to pay attention to things,” he said. “Now, everyone associates ‘web3’ with ridiculous valuations for things that are quite clearly entangled in some dodgy stuff.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest example of this dodginess that seems to have gone over many people’s heads is that the buyer of Beeple’s [$69 million NFT on Christie’s](https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/first-open-beeple/beeple-b-1981-1/112924) — Vignesh Sundaresan, a.k.a. [MetaKovan](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/07/buyer-of-69-million-dollar-beeple-art-metakovan-on-nfts.html) — had a clear conflict of interest. Sundaresan himself is working on his own NFT platform called [Metapurse](https://www.metapurse.fund/), which offers fractionalized investment opportunities in bundles of NFT artworks. The company makes “B20 tokens” available for fans and investors to purchase and trade themselves to represent a stake in the fund. The kicker: Metapurse gave Beeple 2% of B20’s entire token supply shortly before purchasing the artist’s record-breaking NFT. As Ben Davis [wrote for *Artnet*](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/beeple-buyers-metakovan-twobadour-1953418), “This means that Beeple essentially owns 2 percent of the fund that purchased his work at auction.” Of course, the value of the B20 token then went up 13x in the days following the Christie’s sale.\n\n[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/07/buyer-of-69-million-dollar-beeple-art-metakovan-on-nfts.html)\n\n“Someone will drop like $30 million on an NFT, which of course sounds like an insane amount of money — but then when you follow the price of the token that they own, a billion dollars in value gets added to the company,” said Dryhurst. “That’s a marketing campaign. It’s what marketing is: You invest money in order to get returns later. Of course, the media loves these kinds of big-ticket narratives, and bought into it — meanwhile, protocols like Zora and many others are quietly building something which is at odds with that mentality and those objectives.”\n\nThis media miscommunication probably led a lot of investors to lose their money on NFT sales, creating a general disillusionment in the market that led to a 90% dip in month-over-month sales in May. Once again, though, the media was incentivized to cover the downfall of the hype that they themselves created. “I think there’s been a bit of a sabotage campaign between the highly coordinated actors pushing for a very specific vision of how [NFTs] work, and a media that is very, very thirsty to write about bad news,” said Dryhurst.\n\nStangl agreed, elaborating that the notion of NFTs as “provenance” or as artificially scarce digital collectibles is “only half the story.” Instead, in Zora’s case, Stangl explained that the protocol is even more about redefining and redistributing value than merely about capturing more of it. “Our goal is build an open-source infrastructure that allows anyone to use NFTs to make two fundamental decisions: A, what has value — it can be monetary or something more abstract, social and participatory — and B, how do you distribute that value?” said Stangl. “That allows you to create a matrix where anything from maximizing your personal wealth and selling your asset at the highest value possible, to new models of collective co-creation and redistribution, are possible.”\n\nThis brings us to the next section… \n\n## Reconciling the tension between the highly individualized, libertarian origins of crypto and more collective practices in music\n\nOne major gap in a lot of music-industry conversations about crypto, Web3 and smart contracts is that these technologies aren’t just about creating new ways to sell more stuff. At scale, they’re about creating entirely new ways of governing and constituting societies. (Light stuff, we know.)\n\n“You’re moving on a constitutional level, where you provide rule sets on how one should constitute oneself, in a social system that is utilizing smart contracts to constitute, govern and process itself,” said Stangl. “The question then is, what do you center in terms of your definition of societies? That is the really exciting thing — ultimately what you are creating are blueprints.”\n\nThe crypto platforms that have gotten the most mainstream media coverage to date tend to center a more libertarian view of sovereignty, self-ownership and individual autonomy as opposed to collective action. Cherie mentioned [BitClout](https://bitclout.com/) as one of the most extreme versions of this philosophy in practice, where someone’s individual value is investable, tradable and entirely tethered to their social clout — an extension of the individualism rampant in influencer and “creator” culture.\n\nImportantly, though, the whole point of decentralization is *not* to ask people to conform to a singular view of society. “If you look at societies that center solidarity or neutrality in the way that they constitute themselves … you can now put those principles into a smart contract and make it part of the blueprint,” said Stangl. “It’s not just a box that you tick at checkout, like, ‘here’s your 1 euro of solidarity if you want it.’ It can be part of the deeper technological blueprint, so that anything you do in the system is rooted in solidarity.”\n\nA big source of current music/crypto tensions, then, is what Stangl calls “a cultural clash, where a lot of crypto and blockchain is coming from a particular sociodemographic group with a particular view on how society works” (read: libertarianism). This is arguably in conflict with the more collective ways in which many artist and fan communities organize and interact with each other — a conflict that the artists clearly voiced during our panel.\n\nZola Jesus was particularly critical of crypto models that seemed to wring creative control and authority away from artists. “That’s something I don’t want to feel like I have to negotiate with my fans … like they have some sort of authority over what music I make or what direction I take as an artist,” she said. “I guess I’m a little more punk in that way, where I don’t want to feel that level of financial tether to a fan base. I don’t want to just become a stock, or feel like I’m getting further embedded into a financial structure that is going to only limit or suppress wherever I want to take my art and my passion. That’s been my biggest concern.” Zola Jesus does have an [active Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/zolajesus) with around 700 members, but she said that that experience has made her feel more protected from the isolation and the “sea of competition and market performance in the music industry … I feel supported in a way that breeds charity, compassion and breeds community.”\n\nThompson was similarly interested in an implementation of crypto that better reflected the collaboration and interdependence of creative communities. “What I’m more interested in around 3.0 and decentralization is not so much this replication of, ‘I’m a popular artist or I’m getting discovered in the crypto community, thus I get much money,’” said Thompson. “It’s about how we can collectivize and create independent agencies which allow for group safety and redistribution of resources — thinking about the past record-label model not in the problematic way where artists have been excluded … but how advances were made at varying tiers of people’s careers to help bring them up and support their practice, and how that supports mixing engineers, producers and all these different people who are part of making work.”\n\nVÉRITÉ more openly acknowledged the notion that, yes, her fans are investing multiple kinds of resources into her work and community “all the time — whether it’s listening to my music, coming to my tour, buying my merch,” she said. Hence, crypto at large could be a valuable tool for her to “give fans an incentive to participate and become a meaningful part of the community, and raise the community’s overall value. And then it’s actually really easy to weed out bad actors, because if you’re just buying my NFT as a speculative thing, you’re probably not going to contribute value into the fan community because that takes a lot of heart, time and effort.”\n\nThe point, though, is that the value of the community is self-sustaining, and is something that exists beyond just the individual artist — which VÉRITÉ suggested could act as a safeguard from the kind of mercenary profiteering that artists like Zola Jesus understandably have reservations about. “My Discord server exists without me,” said VÉRITÉ. “I’ve built a community of people who like to hang out and can entertain themselves while I go away for a month. That becomes the goal, where the community isn’t fully dependent on me as this pillar and this center, but where you’re building something that has a greater meaning than just yourself.”\n\n## Letting artists control not only the flow of money, but also the incentives\n\nMoving a bit beyond just NFTs, much of the panel discussion focused on the value of protocols and DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) at large for giving artists the control and ownership they’ve been demanding from centralized platforms for decades.\n\n“Spotify and Instagram were designed with one thing in mind: To profit the bottom lines of the people who designed them,” said Stangl. “All of the functions and business outcomes were in essence predefined, to benefit those who designed the systems.” (Investor Li Jin posted a [lengthy Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1408103654863814657) this week with the same argument: “Without ownership … Creators, by working, are strengthening platform owners’ domination over their ability to work.”)\n\n[Li Jin](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1408103654863814657)\n\nSimilarly, one of the main reasons big-ticket NFT auctions seem like the “only” outcome of the NFT ecosystem is because a small handful of platforms have largely been responsible for driving the now-mainstream media narratives. “We have to give artists the tools to make those design decisions in an informed way, and then benefit from the outcome of those decisions,” said Stangl. “A lot of these things don’t need mitigation or third parties that inject themselves into a particular revenue stream. They can still participate, of course, and still create a value proposition, but that value cannot be justified just by injecting yourself into the part where money passes from one hand to another.”\n\nOne such way to give artists control over their own platforms is through protocols that allow them to code their own economics into their creative works. For instance, Bas Grasmayer [wrote last year](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2020/12/01/music-streaming-as-a-protocol-why-i-was-wrong-about-audius/) about how companies like Audius are trying to let artists use smart contracts to set their own per-stream rates for consumption of their music online. Protocols like Zora — and the platforms that run on them, like Mirror and [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/) — give artists the ability to bring in multiple collaborators to share revenue on a given creative work, or even [wire funds instantaneously to public goods](https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw). During our panel, Cherie mentioned that this could lead to a greater diversity of artists getting rewarded for their work — instead of merely “incentivizing repeat consumption” as the dominant DSPs do, which arguably gives an advantage to pop artists while disadvantaging artists who work in less “bingeable” modes like classical, jazz or experimental music.\n\nMusic- and creator-focused DAOs like the [Song That Owns Itself (STOI)](https://stoi.org/), [Seed Club](https://seedclub.xyz/) and [herstoryDAO](https://foundation.app/blog/herstorydao-manifesto) are also becoming increasingly popular for aligning incentives among artists, creative collaborators, fans and industry partners, financially or otherwise. On our panel, Zola Jesus questioned whether DAOs are in any way different from a corporation; Dryhurst offered that the main difference was that “you could see the smart contract as the CEO,” and that “there’s nothing inherent in DAO tools that forces you to see them as a financial vehicle.” (That said, Wyoming recently [passed legislation](https://www.coindesk.com/wyoming-dao-llc-law-passed) that would allow DAOs to register themselves as LLCs.)\n\nStangl emphasized that the appeal of DAOs for underground music communities might be less about financial gain outright, and more about facilitating and managing already-blurred relationships and responsibilities among members. “In the value creation of underground music cultures, the distinction between who is the consumer, vs. who is the artist or marketing person, is often very blurred,” said Stangl. “When you talk about event promotion, in 99% of the cases, that promoter is not a promoter — they’re someone who’s so engaged with the music community that they put their own money into populating the culture … We negotiate that all the time in terms of what audiences contribute, what festivals contribute, what cultural institutions contribute — it’s not as clear-cut as it is in the mainstream music industry.” DAO infrastructure can allow these grassroots communities to “renegotiate those power relationships” with fans and audiences in a transparent and open way.\n\n## Critique and transparency are tools for change\n\nLast but not least, an important theme in our panel discussion was that the critique around music NFTs should not be interpreted as an excuse to shut down the system for good. Rather, voicing concerns at such a formative stage of this technology’s development will allow active stakeholders to shape the role they want it to play within culture and society in the long term. In Thompson’s words: “We’ve seen so much critique of these NFT platforms … and I want to make clear that I think critique is a form of care.”\n\nDavies added that, in an ironic way, the rapid-fire media frenzy around NFTs is also leading to productive conversations more quickly compared to other kinds of technology in recent music history. “It took 10 years for the mainstream to be critical of Spotify, but it took three months for the mainstream to be critical of NFTs,” said Davies. “This criticism is good because it’s getting things more out in the open.”\n\nDryhurst added that the core reason why so many people have become so critical of music NFTs so quickly is also because of the technology's greatest selling point: Transparency.\n\n“I don’t think crypto alone is creating financialization around culture,” said Dryhurst. “I think crypto is putting that on-chain, and making it all visible, guts and all … And one of the pros and cons of decentralization is that there is no ‘one thing’ in this space. If someone is interested in web3, the good news is that there is no central actor telling you how to interact with it. The bad news is that there’s no central actor to impede somebody else from doing something you don’t like. That’s the kind of bargain you enter into when participating in crypto.”\n\nMany crypto community members and researchers are already wielding this transparency for more productive use, in terms of better understanding the power dynamics and economics around NFTs, social tokens, DAOs and other applications of the technology. It’s only because of this transparency, for instance, that we’ve been able to pin down that monthly music NFT sales are down by 80%; that figure is practically impossible to pin down in any other sector of the music business, due to data silos across multiple centralized platforms and companies. Others have also published helpful graphics visualizing [token distribution for various blockchains](https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1394283802009145348), exposing the blockchains that contradict themselves by having mostly centralized ownership (i.e. majority-owned only by the founders and/or investors).\n\nUltimately, this transparency can be a \"net positive\" in that \"we might be able to develop some fluency as to how culture is currently working and is currently traded, and how most people see culture as a vehicle for social capital or even capital-C Capital,” said Dryhurst. “And then from there: What are the protocols that we as an individual, community, label, magazine — what do we want to put in place now? That, to me, is a net positive.” ✯\n\n-----------\n\n*ICYMI: If you enjoyed the above recap and want to support its contributors, you can send tips in ETH that will be evenly distributed among CO:QUO, all the panel speakers, the co-authors of this article and two organizations dedicated to helping marginalized artists navigate the crypto world, namely The Mint Fund and herstoryDAO.*\n\n[CO:QUO panel recap](split://0x9B30a3D0a6577059eBE1f5D674Ecf34FCb0716CA?network=mainnet)", "timestamp": 1624649709, "digest": "EuLRP_H7cSqn48Ypp1UrJ77--rMLrkmF15FaUuoOS3U", "contributor": "0x03e9206f2A1234fEFaD2C0B07A86B1E0f5cB8d0D"}

The word “simulacra” in particular — which refers to the presence of signs and symbols in place of reality — was [popularized first by sociologist Jean Baudrillard](https://web.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html) in the 1980s, then [by the Wachowskis in their renowned film franchise *The Matrix*](https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation).\n\n“Over the last few years, I started to notice signs and symbols replacing all of my realities, which was certainly exacerbated by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic,” said Davies. “But rather than stay with the more dystopian approach that the Wachowskis did with The Matrix, I was more interested in a utopian approach — in building and imagining utopias and new futures, specifically for the music industry.”\n\nThe rapid rise and fall of music NFT hype is a perfect example of people conflating signs and symbols with reality — not just in the literal sense of viewing a JPEG tied to a digital token as equally “authentic” and “real” as the physical world, but also in the metaphorical sense of perpetuating certain myths about how NFTs work and how the artist-fan relationship should look that don’t always line up with the reality of how artists and the music industry operate.\n\n**VÉRITÉ** is an independent artist who has been active in crypto in recent months — most recently selling a portion of master recording royalties for her single “by now” to a fan [in the form of an NFT](https://zora.co/verite/2720). That said, due to current limitations around royalty payments, that revenue split had to be implemented off- rather than on-chain through traditional legal agreements, with the NFT merely acting as an authenticated “purchase receipt” of sorts on top of the song. Other auctions like [Jacques Greene’s “Promise” NFT](https://foundation.app/jacquesgreene/promise-640) and [Lil Dicky’s “Save Dat Money” NFT](https://auctions.royaltyexchange.com/auctions/nft-lil-dickys-save-dat-money-publishing-royalties/) had a similar limitation — i.e. auctioning royalty shares through NFTs, but actually implementing those share agreements through traditional music-industry processes that pay out royalties more slowly.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/2720)\n\nOn this note, during our panel, VÉRITÉ pointed to how two simultaneous conversations were emerging within the music NFT community: “The idealism of what NFTs can be, and the pragmatic and practical reality that we still have to be in relationship with more antiquated systems, especially within the music industry to make that work.” The way in which royalties are collected in particular is a “50-year-old clunky system with a black box that definitely benefits the holders of that black box,” she said.\n\nA sense of pragmatism needs to be considered not only for issues like fractionalized royalty payments, but also for the realities of fan behavior and how everyday people do (or don’t) value culture.\n\nFirst things first: “The masses do not value digital assets,” said VÉRITÉ. “They do not value the MP3. The idea that we’re going to raise the price of a stream beyond 0.004 cents — I don’t believe that is going to happen.” Crypto is also still inaccessible enough such that the vast majority of VÉRITÉ’s fans are not active in that community: “I have probably five fans participating in these things. Until I’m able to issue NFTs with a fiat option and a credit card onboarding ramp, so I can give my fans the experience of owning a digital asset and having them internalize that [experience], they’re not coming over.”\n\nA related misconception in the crypto world is that there is a critical mass of fans who want to act as financial investors in their favorite artists. **Michail Stangl** — who works at [Zora](http://zora.co/) (the protocol that powers Mirror), curates the CTM festival and formerly served as host and lead programmer for Boiler Room — pushed back on this idea that the artist-fan relationship should be financialized in this way by default.\n\n“A future in which every interaction between audiences and musicians is a financial transaction is dystopian to me,” said Stangl. “A lot of spaces that are designing [crypto] technology assume a certain relationship between fans and artists … if your reality is staring at crypto charts all day, you might think my relationship to my favorite artist is one of an investor. But 99% of fans don’t want to handle cultural investment portfolios, tracking which ‘blockchain track’ is the hottest that might create revenue for them if they sell their fractional share. That is not the way we engage with culture.”\n\nIt will take several years to reverse the widespread devaluation of music consumption, which VÉRITÉ suggested is a necessary side effect of overall “market saturation” in music and the fact that “the creation and distribution of music is now fully democratized.” That said, it’s still common knowledge that fans value music in at least some way, even if it’s not reflected in streaming economics.\n\n“They are lovers and consumers of art, and they do want to support the artist — we just need new ways to enable them to give that support,” said VÉRITÉ. “We can add these additional value layers, whether that’s membership to a community, or providing people with an experience that’s bigger than just clicking on something and listening to it.” In this process of devising new means of artist-fan support, this is where it’s important to “center voices who have a pure idealism about what we can build.”\n\n## The myth of NFTs’ speculative value\n\nIndependent artist **Zola Jesus** was one of the more critical voices in our discussion when it came to the current state of crypto in music. In a [previous interview with *Pitchfork*](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/), she had expressed her frustration with the financialization of music NFTs, arguing that the market would only become fair for artists once “the art is being purchased for the merit of what it expresses, rather than what profit it could yield in the future. I don’t want people to bet on me like a racehorse.”\n\n[Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/)\n\nDuring our panel, Zola Jesus expressed similar sentiments. Initially, she said, her impression of NFTs was positive; she had viewed the technology as an antidote for the corporatization of the music industry — particularly for the “disillusionment” she’d experienced while having to navigate “endless corporate structures,” forcing her to “play a game outside of music itself … [Crypto] was a whole new way to create art, and to be able to find homes and support for that art.” \n\nHowever, she quickly became suspicious of the intentions of the buyers of her art, and concerned that her art was just becoming “a means of profiting off speculation.” Rather than representing any real challenge or alternative to mainstream culture, she felt that NFTs in their most hyped-up, auctioned form were simply “further enmeshing us in financial contracts and capitalist frameworks,” with artists being “traded like stocks.” \n\n**Chloe Alexandra Thompson**, who is First Nations (Cree), drew a deeper historical connection between the “cash-grab, transactional rhetoric” around NFTs and “movements around resource extraction and the emergence of new physical colonies on Indigenous land, like mineral mining” (an analogy that is especially relevant given the environmental concerns around proof-of-work blockchains). The end result is an environment where art is merely being “objectified,” rather than “supported and engaged with in a caring way.”\n\nFortunately, the speculative value of NFTs is largely a myth, anyway. For one, the five- to seven-figure auction model has largely fallen out of fashion for music NFTs. According to [research spearheaded by Water & Music](https://www.patreon.com/posts/music-nft-and-2m-46187290), monthly music NFT sales plummeted by 80% from April to May, and is projected to plummet by another 60% to 70% month-over-month in June. Moreover, according to an [economics paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00647.pdf) published by researchers across the U.S. and Europe, under 10% of NFTs that generated a primary sale since 2017 ended up generating a secondary sale within a week, and only 22% generated a secondary sale within a year.\n\n[Music NFT and social token database](https://www.patreon.com/posts/music-nft-and-2m-46187290)\n\nArtist and researcher **Mat Dryhurst** suggested that mainstream media incentives had a lot to do with NFTs’ rise and subsequent fall. In search of sensationalist news, mainstream media outlets automatically navigated towards the six- to eight-figure sales coming out from only a small handful of platforms and actors in the NFT market, even if those outlets had only a rudimentary understanding of how NFTs actually worked. At one point, [even SNL got on board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrNOYudaMAc&ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive).\n\n“Even in a decentralized ecosystem, you don’t get to decide when people choose to pay attention to things,” he said. “Now, everyone associates ‘web3’ with ridiculous valuations for things that are quite clearly entangled in some dodgy stuff.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest example of this dodginess that seems to have gone over many people’s heads is that the buyer of Beeple’s [$69 million NFT on Christie’s](https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/first-open-beeple/beeple-b-1981-1/112924) — Vignesh Sundaresan, a.k.a. [MetaKovan](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/07/buyer-of-69-million-dollar-beeple-art-metakovan-on-nfts.html) — had a clear conflict of interest. Sundaresan himself is working on his own NFT platform called [Metapurse](https://www.metapurse.fund/), which offers fractionalized investment opportunities in bundles of NFT artworks. The company makes “B20 tokens” available for fans and investors to purchase and trade themselves to represent a stake in the fund. The kicker: Metapurse gave Beeple 2% of B20’s entire token supply shortly before purchasing the artist’s record-breaking NFT. As Ben Davis [wrote for *Artnet*](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/beeple-buyers-metakovan-twobadour-1953418), “This means that Beeple essentially owns 2 percent of the fund that purchased his work at auction.” Of course, the value of the B20 token then went up 13x in the days following the Christie’s sale.\n\n[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/07/buyer-of-69-million-dollar-beeple-art-metakovan-on-nfts.html)\n\n“Someone will drop like $30 million on an NFT, which of course sounds like an insane amount of money — but then when you follow the price of the token that they own, a billion dollars in value gets added to the company,” said Dryhurst. “That’s a marketing campaign. It’s what marketing is: You invest money in order to get returns later. Of course, the media loves these kinds of big-ticket narratives, and bought into it — meanwhile, protocols like Zora and many others are quietly building something which is at odds with that mentality and those objectives.”\n\nThis media miscommunication probably led a lot of investors to lose their money on NFT sales, creating a general disillusionment in the market that led to a 90% dip in month-over-month sales in May. Once again, though, the media was incentivized to cover the downfall of the hype that they themselves created. “I think there’s been a bit of a sabotage campaign between the highly coordinated actors pushing for a very specific vision of how [NFTs] work, and a media that is very, very thirsty to write about bad news,” said Dryhurst.\n\nStangl agreed, elaborating that the notion of NFTs as “provenance” or as artificially scarce digital collectibles is “only half the story.” Instead, in Zora’s case, Stangl explained that the protocol is even more about redefining and redistributing value than merely about capturing more of it. “Our goal is build an open-source infrastructure that allows anyone to use NFTs to make two fundamental decisions: A, what has value — it can be monetary or something more abstract, social and participatory — and B, how do you distribute that value?” said Stangl. “That allows you to create a matrix where anything from maximizing your personal wealth and selling your asset at the highest value possible, to new models of collective co-creation and redistribution, are possible.”\n\nThis brings us to the next section… \n\n## Reconciling the tension between the highly individualized, libertarian origins of crypto and more collective practices in music\n\nOne major gap in a lot of music-industry conversations about crypto, Web3 and smart contracts is that these technologies aren’t just about creating new ways to sell more stuff. At scale, they’re about creating entirely new ways of governing and constituting societies. (Light stuff, we know.)\n\n“You’re moving on a constitutional level, where you provide rule sets on how one should constitute oneself, in a social system that is utilizing smart contracts to constitute, govern and process itself,” said Stangl. “The question then is, what do you center in terms of your definition of societies? That is the really exciting thing — ultimately what you are creating are blueprints.”\n\nThe crypto platforms that have gotten the most mainstream media coverage to date tend to center a more libertarian view of sovereignty, self-ownership and individual autonomy as opposed to collective action. Cherie mentioned [BitClout](https://bitclout.com/) as one of the most extreme versions of this philosophy in practice, where someone’s individual value is investable, tradable and entirely tethered to their social clout — an extension of the individualism rampant in influencer and “creator” culture.\n\nImportantly, though, the whole point of decentralization is *not* to ask people to conform to a singular view of society. “If you look at societies that center solidarity or neutrality in the way that they constitute themselves … you can now put those principles into a smart contract and make it part of the blueprint,” said Stangl. “It’s not just a box that you tick at checkout, like, ‘here’s your 1 euro of solidarity if you want it.’ It can be part of the deeper technological blueprint, so that anything you do in the system is rooted in solidarity.”\n\nA big source of current music/crypto tensions, then, is what Stangl calls “a cultural clash, where a lot of crypto and blockchain is coming from a particular sociodemographic group with a particular view on how society works” (read: libertarianism). This is arguably in conflict with the more collective ways in which many artist and fan communities organize and interact with each other — a conflict that the artists clearly voiced during our panel.\n\nZola Jesus was particularly critical of crypto models that seemed to wring creative control and authority away from artists. “That’s something I don’t want to feel like I have to negotiate with my fans … like they have some sort of authority over what music I make or what direction I take as an artist,” she said. “I guess I’m a little more punk in that way, where I don’t want to feel that level of financial tether to a fan base. I don’t want to just become a stock, or feel like I’m getting further embedded into a financial structure that is going to only limit or suppress wherever I want to take my art and my passion. That’s been my biggest concern.” Zola Jesus does have an [active Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/zolajesus) with around 700 members, but she said that that experience has made her feel more protected from the isolation and the “sea of competition and market performance in the music industry … I feel supported in a way that breeds charity, compassion and breeds community.”\n\nThompson was similarly interested in an implementation of crypto that better reflected the collaboration and interdependence of creative communities. “What I’m more interested in around 3.0 and decentralization is not so much this replication of, ‘I’m a popular artist or I’m getting discovered in the crypto community, thus I get much money,’” said Thompson. “It’s about how we can collectivize and create independent agencies which allow for group safety and redistribution of resources — thinking about the past record-label model not in the problematic way where artists have been excluded … but how advances were made at varying tiers of people’s careers to help bring them up and support their practice, and how that supports mixing engineers, producers and all these different people who are part of making work.”\n\nVÉRITÉ more openly acknowledged the notion that, yes, her fans are investing multiple kinds of resources into her work and community “all the time — whether it’s listening to my music, coming to my tour, buying my merch,” she said. Hence, crypto at large could be a valuable tool for her to “give fans an incentive to participate and become a meaningful part of the community, and raise the community’s overall value. And then it’s actually really easy to weed out bad actors, because if you’re just buying my NFT as a speculative thing, you’re probably not going to contribute value into the fan community because that takes a lot of heart, time and effort.”\n\nThe point, though, is that the value of the community is self-sustaining, and is something that exists beyond just the individual artist — which VÉRITÉ suggested could act as a safeguard from the kind of mercenary profiteering that artists like Zola Jesus understandably have reservations about. “My Discord server exists without me,” said VÉRITÉ. “I’ve built a community of people who like to hang out and can entertain themselves while I go away for a month. That becomes the goal, where the community isn’t fully dependent on me as this pillar and this center, but where you’re building something that has a greater meaning than just yourself.”\n\n## Letting artists control not only the flow of money, but also the incentives\n\nMoving a bit beyond just NFTs, much of the panel discussion focused on the value of protocols and DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) at large for giving artists the control and ownership they’ve been demanding from centralized platforms for decades.\n\n“Spotify and Instagram were designed with one thing in mind: To profit the bottom lines of the people who designed them,” said Stangl. “All of the functions and business outcomes were in essence predefined, to benefit those who designed the systems.” (Investor Li Jin posted a [lengthy Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1408103654863814657) this week with the same argument: “Without ownership … Creators, by working, are strengthening platform owners’ domination over their ability to work.”)\n\n[Li Jin](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1408103654863814657)\n\nSimilarly, one of the main reasons big-ticket NFT auctions seem like the “only” outcome of the NFT ecosystem is because a small handful of platforms have largely been responsible for driving the now-mainstream media narratives. “We have to give artists the tools to make those design decisions in an informed way, and then benefit from the outcome of those decisions,” said Stangl. “A lot of these things don’t need mitigation or third parties that inject themselves into a particular revenue stream. They can still participate, of course, and still create a value proposition, but that value cannot be justified just by injecting yourself into the part where money passes from one hand to another.”\n\nOne such way to give artists control over their own platforms is through protocols that allow them to code their own economics into their creative works. For instance, Bas Grasmayer [wrote last year](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2020/12/01/music-streaming-as-a-protocol-why-i-was-wrong-about-audius/) about how companies like Audius are trying to let artists use smart contracts to set their own per-stream rates for consumption of their music online. Protocols like Zora — and the platforms that run on them, like Mirror and [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/) — give artists the ability to bring in multiple collaborators to share revenue on a given creative work, or even [wire funds instantaneously to public goods](https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw). During our panel, Cherie mentioned that this could lead to a greater diversity of artists getting rewarded for their work — instead of merely “incentivizing repeat consumption” as the dominant DSPs do, which arguably gives an advantage to pop artists while disadvantaging artists who work in less “bingeable” modes like classical, jazz or experimental music.\n\nMusic- and creator-focused DAOs like the [Song That Owns Itself (STOI)](https://stoi.org/), [Seed Club](https://seedclub.xyz/) and [herstoryDAO](https://foundation.app/blog/herstorydao-manifesto) are also becoming increasingly popular for aligning incentives among artists, creative collaborators, fans and industry partners, financially or otherwise. On our panel, Zola Jesus questioned whether DAOs are in any way different from a corporation; Dryhurst offered that the main difference was that “you could see the smart contract as the CEO,” and that “there’s nothing inherent in DAO tools that forces you to see them as a financial vehicle.” (That said, Wyoming recently [passed legislation](https://www.coindesk.com/wyoming-dao-llc-law-passed) that would allow DAOs to register themselves as LLCs.)\n\nStangl emphasized that the appeal of DAOs for underground music communities might be less about financial gain outright, and more about facilitating and managing already-blurred relationships and responsibilities among members. “In the value creation of underground music cultures, the distinction between who is the consumer, vs. who is the artist or marketing person, is often very blurred,” said Stangl. “When you talk about event promotion, in 99% of the cases, that promoter is not a promoter — they’re someone who’s so engaged with the music community that they put their own money into populating the culture … We negotiate that all the time in terms of what audiences contribute, what festivals contribute, what cultural institutions contribute — it’s not as clear-cut as it is in the mainstream music industry.” DAO infrastructure can allow these grassroots communities to “renegotiate those power relationships” with fans and audiences in a transparent and open way.\n\n## Critique and transparency are tools for change\n\nLast but not least, an important theme in our panel discussion was that the critique around music NFTs should not be interpreted as an excuse to shut down the system for good. Rather, voicing concerns at such a formative stage of this technology’s development will allow active stakeholders to shape the role they want it to play within culture and society in the long term. In Thompson’s words: “We’ve seen so much critique of these NFT platforms … and I want to make clear that I think critique is a form of care.”\n\nDavies added that, in an ironic way, the rapid-fire media frenzy around NFTs is also leading to productive conversations more quickly compared to other kinds of technology in recent music history. “It took 10 years for the mainstream to be critical of Spotify, but it took three months for the mainstream to be critical of NFTs,” said Davies. “This criticism is good because it’s getting things more out in the open.”\n\nDryhurst added that the core reason why so many people have become so critical of music NFTs so quickly is also because of the technology's greatest selling point: Transparency.\n\n“I don’t think crypto alone is creating financialization around culture,” said Dryhurst. “I think crypto is putting that on-chain, and making it all visible, guts and all … And one of the pros and cons of decentralization is that there is no ‘one thing’ in this space. If someone is interested in web3, the good news is that there is no central actor telling you how to interact with it. The bad news is that there’s no central actor to impede somebody else from doing something you don’t like. That’s the kind of bargain you enter into when participating in crypto.”\n\nMany crypto community members and researchers are already wielding this transparency for more productive use, in terms of better understanding the power dynamics and economics around NFTs, social tokens, DAOs and other applications of the technology. It’s only because of this transparency, for instance, that we’ve been able to pin down that monthly music NFT sales are down by 80%; that figure is practically impossible to pin down in any other sector of the music business, due to data silos across multiple centralized platforms and companies. Others have also published helpful graphics visualizing [token distribution for various blockchains](https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1394283802009145348), exposing the blockchains that contradict themselves by having mostly centralized ownership (i.e. majority-owned only by the founders and/or investors).\n\nUltimately, this transparency can be a \"net positive\" in that \"we might be able to develop some fluency as to how culture is currently working and is currently traded, and how most people see culture as a vehicle for social capital or even capital-C Capital,” said Dryhurst. “And then from there: What are the protocols that we as an individual, community, label, magazine — what do we want to put in place now? That, to me, is a net positive.” ✯\n\n-----------\n\n*ICYMI: If you enjoyed the above recap and want to support its contributors, you can send tips in ETH that will be evenly distributed among CO:QUO, all the panel speakers, the co-authors of this article and two organizations dedicated to helping marginalized artists navigate the crypto world, namely The Mint Fund and herstoryDAO.*\n\n[CO:QUO panel recap](split://0x9B30a3D0a6577059eBE1f5D674Ecf34FCb0716CA?network=mainnet)", "timestamp": 1624649700, "digest": "EuLRP_H7cSqn48Ypp1UrJ77--rMLrkmF15FaUuoOS3U", "contributor": "0x03e9206f2A1234fEFaD2C0B07A86B1E0f5cB8d0D"}

The word “simulacra” in particular — which refers to the presence of signs and symbols in place of reality — was [popularized first by sociologist Jean Baudrillard](https://web.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html) in the 1980s, then [by the Wachowskis in their renowned film franchise *The Matrix*](https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation).\n\n“Over the last few years, I started to notice signs and symbols replacing all of my realities, which was certainly exacerbated by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic,” said Davies. “But rather than stay with the more dystopian approach that the Wachowskis did with The Matrix, I was more interested in a utopian approach — in building and imagining utopias and new futures, specifically for the music industry.”\n\nThe rapid rise and fall of music NFT hype is a perfect example of people conflating signs and symbols with reality — not just in the literal sense of viewing a JPEG tied to a digital token as equally “authentic” and “real” as the physical world, but also in the metaphorical sense of perpetuating certain myths about how NFTs work and how the artist-fan relationship should look that don’t always line up with the reality of how artists and the music industry operate.\n\n**VÉRITÉ** is an independent artist who has been active in crypto in recent months — most recently selling a portion of master recording royalties for her single “by now” to a fan [in the form of an NFT](https://zora.co/verite/2720). That said, due to current limitations around royalty payments, that revenue split had to be implemented off- rather than on-chain through traditional legal agreements, with the NFT merely acting as an authenticated “purchase receipt” of sorts on top of the song. Other auctions like [Jacques Greene’s “Promise” NFT](https://foundation.app/jacquesgreene/promise-640) and [Lil Dicky’s “Save Dat Money” NFT](https://auctions.royaltyexchange.com/auctions/nft-lil-dickys-save-dat-money-publishing-royalties/) had a similar limitation — i.e. auctioning royalty shares through NFTs, but actually implementing those share agreements through traditional music-industry processes that pay out royalties more slowly.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/2720)\n\nOn this note, during our panel, VÉRITÉ pointed to how two simultaneous conversations were emerging within the music NFT community: “The idealism of what NFTs can be, and the pragmatic and practical reality that we still have to be in relationship with more antiquated systems, especially within the music industry to make that work.” The way in which royalties are collected in particular is a “50-year-old clunky system with a black box that definitely benefits the holders of that black box,” she said.\n\nA sense of pragmatism needs to be considered not only for issues like fractionalized royalty payments, but also for the realities of fan behavior and how everyday people do (or don’t) value culture.\n\nFirst things first: “The masses do not value digital assets,” said VÉRITÉ. “They do not value the MP3. The idea that we’re going to raise the price of a stream beyond 0.004 cents — I don’t believe that is going to happen.” Crypto is also still inaccessible enough such that the vast majority of VÉRITÉ’s fans are not active in that community: “I have probably five fans participating in these things. Until I’m able to issue NFTs with a fiat option and a credit card onboarding ramp, so I can give my fans the experience of owning a digital asset and having them internalize that [experience], they’re not coming over.”\n\nA related misconception in the crypto world is that there is a critical mass of fans who want to act as financial investors in their favorite artists. **Michail Stangl** — who works at [Zora](http://zora.co/) (the protocol that powers Mirror), curates the CTM festival and formerly served as host and lead programmer for Boiler Room — pushed back on this idea that the artist-fan relationship should be financialized in this way by default.\n\n“A future in which every interaction between audiences and musicians is a financial transaction is dystopian to me,” said Stangl. “A lot of spaces that are designing [crypto] technology assume a certain relationship between fans and artists … if your reality is staring at crypto charts all day, you might think my relationship to my favorite artist is one of an investor. But 99% of fans don’t want to handle cultural investment portfolios, tracking which ‘blockchain track’ is the hottest that might create revenue for them if they sell their fractional share. That is not the way we engage with culture.”\n\nIt will take several years to reverse the widespread devaluation of music consumption, which VÉRITÉ suggested is a necessary side effect of overall “market saturation” in music and the fact that “the creation and distribution of music is now fully democratized.” That said, it’s still common knowledge that fans value music in at least some way, even if it’s not reflected in streaming economics.\n\n“They are lovers and consumers of art, and they do want to support the artist — we just need new ways to enable them to give that support,” said VÉRITÉ. “We can add these additional value layers, whether that’s membership to a community, or providing people with an experience that’s bigger than just clicking on something and listening to it.” In this process of devising new means of artist-fan support, this is where it’s important to “center voices who have a pure idealism about what we can build.”\n\n## The myth of NFTs’ speculative value\n\nIndependent artist **Zola Jesus** was one of the more critical voices in our discussion when it came to the current state of crypto in music. In a [previous interview with *Pitchfork*](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/), she had expressed her frustration with the financialization of music NFTs, arguing that the market would only become fair for artists once “the art is being purchased for the merit of what it expresses, rather than what profit it could yield in the future. I don’t want people to bet on me like a racehorse.”\n\n[Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/)\n\nDuring our panel, Zola Jesus expressed similar sentiments. Initially, she said, her impression of NFTs was positive; she had viewed the technology as an antidote for the corporatization of the music industry — particularly for the “disillusionment” she’d experienced while having to navigate “endless corporate structures,” forcing her to “play a game outside of music itself … [Crypto] was a whole new way to create art, and to be able to find homes and support for that art.” \n\nHowever, she quickly became suspicious of the intentions of the buyers of her art, and concerned that her art was just becoming “a means of profiting off speculation.” Rather than representing any real challenge or alternative to mainstream culture, she felt that NFTs in their most hyped-up, auctioned form were simply “further enmeshing us in financial contracts and capitalist frameworks,” with artists being “traded like stocks.” \n\n**Chloe Alexandra Thompson**, who is First Nations (Cree), drew a deeper historical connection between the “cash-grab, transactional rhetoric” around NFTs and “movements around resource extraction and the emergence of new physical colonies on Indigenous land, like mineral mining” (an analogy that is especially relevant given the environmental concerns around proof-of-work blockchains). The end result is an environment where art is merely being “objectified,” rather than “supported and engaged with in a caring way.”\n\nFortunately, the speculative value of NFTs is largely a myth, anyway. For one, the five- to seven-figure auction model has largely fallen out of fashion for music NFTs. According to [research spearheaded by Water & Music](https://www.patreon.com/posts/music-nft-and-2m-46187290), monthly music NFT sales plummeted by 80% from April to May, and is projected to plummet by another 60% to 70% month-over-month in June. Moreover, according to an [economics paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00647.pdf) published by researchers across the U.S. and Europe, under 10% of NFTs that generated a primary sale since 2017 ended up generating a secondary sale within a week, and only 22% generated a secondary sale within a year.\n\n[Music NFT and social token database](https://www.patreon.com/posts/music-nft-and-2m-46187290)\n\nArtist and researcher **Mat Dryhurst** suggested that mainstream media incentives had a lot to do with NFTs’ rise and subsequent fall. In search of sensationalist news, mainstream media outlets automatically navigated towards the six- to eight-figure sales coming out from only a small handful of platforms and actors in the NFT market, even if those outlets had only a rudimentary understanding of how NFTs actually worked. At one point, [even SNL got on board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrNOYudaMAc&ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive).\n\n“Even in a decentralized ecosystem, you don’t get to decide when people choose to pay attention to things,” he said. “Now, everyone associates ‘web3’ with ridiculous valuations for things that are quite clearly entangled in some dodgy stuff.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest example of this dodginess that seems to have gone over many people’s heads is that the buyer of Beeple’s [$69 million NFT on Christie’s](https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/first-open-beeple/beeple-b-1981-1/112924) — Vignesh Sundaresan, a.k.a. [MetaKovan](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/07/buyer-of-69-million-dollar-beeple-art-metakovan-on-nfts.html) — had a clear conflict of interest. Sundaresan himself is working on his own NFT platform called [Metapurse](https://www.metapurse.fund/), which offers fractionalized investment opportunities in bundles of NFT artworks. The company makes “B20 tokens” available for fans and investors to purchase and trade themselves to represent a stake in the fund. The kicker: Metapurse gave Beeple 2% of B20’s entire token supply shortly before purchasing the artist’s record-breaking NFT. As Ben Davis [wrote for *Artnet*](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/beeple-buyers-metakovan-twobadour-1953418), “This means that Beeple essentially owns 2 percent of the fund that purchased his work at auction.” Of course, the value of the B20 token then went up 13x in the days following the Christie’s sale.\n\n[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/07/buyer-of-69-million-dollar-beeple-art-metakovan-on-nfts.html)\n\n“Someone will drop like $30 million on an NFT, which of course sounds like an insane amount of money — but then when you follow the price of the token that they own, a billion dollars in value gets added to the company,” said Dryhurst. “That’s a marketing campaign. It’s what marketing is: You invest money in order to get returns later. Of course, the media loves these kinds of big-ticket narratives, and bought into it — meanwhile, protocols like Zora and many others are quietly building something which is at odds with that mentality and those objectives.”\n\nThis media miscommunication probably led a lot of investors to lose their money on NFT sales, creating a general disillusionment in the market that led to a 90% dip in month-over-month sales in May. Once again, though, the media was incentivized to cover the downfall of the hype that they themselves created. “I think there’s been a bit of a sabotage campaign between the highly coordinated actors pushing for a very specific vision of how [NFTs] work, and a media that is very, very thirsty to write about bad news,” said Dryhurst.\n\nStangl agreed, elaborating that the notion of NFTs as “provenance” or as artificially scarce digital collectibles is “only half the story.” Instead, in Zora’s case, Stangl explained that the protocol is even more about redefining and redistributing value than merely about capturing more of it. “Our goal is build an open-source infrastructure that allows anyone to use NFTs to make two fundamental decisions: A, what has value — it can be monetary or something more abstract, social and participatory — and B, how do you distribute that value?” said Stangl. “That allows you to create a matrix where anything from maximizing your personal wealth and selling your asset at the highest value possible, to new models of collective co-creation and redistribution, are possible.”\n\nThis brings us to the next section… \n\n## Reconciling the tension between the highly individualized, libertarian origins of crypto and more collective practices in music\n\nOne major gap in a lot of music-industry conversations about crypto, Web3 and smart contracts is that these technologies aren’t just about creating new ways to sell more stuff. At scale, they’re about creating entirely new ways of governing and constituting societies. (Light stuff, we know.)\n\n“You’re moving on a constitutional level, where you provide rule sets on how one should constitute oneself, in a social system that is utilizing smart contracts to constitute, govern and process itself,” said Stangl. “The question then is, what do you center in terms of your definition of societies? That is the really exciting thing — ultimately what you are creating are blueprints.”\n\nThe crypto platforms that have gotten the most mainstream media coverage to date tend to center a more libertarian view of sovereignty, self-ownership and individual autonomy as opposed to collective action. Cherie mentioned [BitClout](https://bitclout.com/) as one of the most extreme versions of this philosophy in practice, where someone’s individual value is investable, tradable and entirely tethered to their social clout — an extension of the individualism rampant in influencer and “creator” culture.\n\nImportantly, though, the whole point of decentralization is *not* to ask people to conform to a singular view of society. “If you look at societies that center solidarity or neutrality in the way that they constitute themselves … you can now put those principles into a smart contract and make it part of the blueprint,” said Stangl. “It’s not just a box that you tick at checkout, like, ‘here’s your 1 euro of solidarity if you want it.’ It can be part of the deeper technological blueprint, so that anything you do in the system is rooted in solidarity.”\n\nA big source of current music/crypto tensions, then, is what Stangl calls “a cultural clash, where a lot of crypto and blockchain is coming from a particular sociodemographic group with a particular view on how society works” (read: libertarianism). This is arguably in conflict with the more collective ways in which many artist and fan communities organize and interact with each other — a conflict that the artists clearly voiced during our panel.\n\nZola Jesus was particularly critical of crypto models that seemed to wring creative control and authority away from artists. “That’s something I don’t want to feel like I have to negotiate with my fans … like they have some sort of authority over what music I make or what direction I take as an artist,” she said. “I guess I’m a little more punk in that way, where I don’t want to feel that level of financial tether to a fan base. I don’t want to just become a stock, or feel like I’m getting further embedded into a financial structure that is going to only limit or suppress wherever I want to take my art and my passion. That’s been my biggest concern.” Zola Jesus does have an [active Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/zolajesus) with around 700 members, but she said that that experience has made her feel more protected from the isolation and the “sea of competition and market performance in the music industry … I feel supported in a way that breeds charity, compassion and breeds community.”\n\nThompson was similarly interested in an implementation of crypto that better reflected the collaboration and interdependence of creative communities. “What I’m more interested in around 3.0 and decentralization is not so much this replication of, ‘I’m a popular artist or I’m getting discovered in the crypto community, thus I get much money,’” said Thompson. “It’s about how we can collectivize and create independent agencies which allow for group safety and redistribution of resources — thinking about the past record-label model not in the problematic way where artists have been excluded … but how advances were made at varying tiers of people’s careers to help bring them up and support their practice, and how that supports mixing engineers, producers and all these different people who are part of making work.”\n\nVÉRITÉ more openly acknowledged the notion that, yes, her fans are investing multiple kinds of resources into her work and community “all the time — whether it’s listening to my music, coming to my tour, buying my merch,” she said. Hence, crypto at large could be a valuable tool for her to “give fans an incentive to participate and become a meaningful part of the community, and raise the community’s overall value. And then it’s actually really easy to weed out bad actors, because if you’re just buying my NFT as a speculative thing, you’re probably not going to contribute value into the fan community because that takes a lot of heart, time and effort.”\n\nThe point, though, is that the value of the community is self-sustaining, and is something that exists beyond just the individual artist — which VÉRITÉ suggested could act as a safeguard from the kind of mercenary profiteering that artists like Zola Jesus understandably have reservations about. “My Discord server exists without me,” said VÉRITÉ. “I’ve built a community of people who like to hang out and can entertain themselves while I go away for a month. That becomes the goal, where the community isn’t fully dependent on me as this pillar and this center, but where you’re building something that has a greater meaning than just yourself.”\n\n## Letting artists control not only the flow of money, but also the incentives\n\nMoving a bit beyond just NFTs, much of the panel discussion focused on the value of protocols and DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) at large for giving artists the control and ownership they’ve been demanding from centralized platforms for decades.\n\n“Spotify and Instagram were designed with one thing in mind: To profit the bottom lines of the people who designed them,” said Stangl. “All of the functions and business outcomes were in essence predefined, to benefit those who designed the systems.” (Investor Li Jin posted a [lengthy Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1408103654863814657) this week with the same argument: “Without ownership … Creators, by working, are strengthening platform owners’ domination over their ability to work.”)\n\n[Li Jin](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1408103654863814657)\n\nSimilarly, one of the main reasons big-ticket NFT auctions seem like the “only” outcome of the NFT ecosystem is because a small handful of platforms have largely been responsible for driving the now-mainstream media narratives. “We have to give artists the tools to make those design decisions in an informed way, and then benefit from the outcome of those decisions,” said Stangl. “A lot of these things don’t need mitigation or third parties that inject themselves into a particular revenue stream. They can still participate, of course, and still create a value proposition, but that value cannot be justified just by injecting yourself into the part where money passes from one hand to another.”\n\nOne such way to give artists control over their own platforms is through protocols that allow them to code their own economics into their creative works. For instance, Bas Grasmayer [wrote last year](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2020/12/01/music-streaming-as-a-protocol-why-i-was-wrong-about-audius/) about how companies like Audius are trying to let artists use smart contracts to set their own per-stream rates for consumption of their music online. Protocols like Zora — and the platforms that run on them, like Mirror and [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/) — give artists the ability to bring in multiple collaborators to share revenue on a given creative work, or even [wire funds instantaneously to public goods](https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw). During our panel, Cherie mentioned that this could lead to a greater diversity of artists getting rewarded for their work — instead of merely “incentivizing repeat consumption” as the dominant DSPs do, which arguably gives an advantage to pop artists while disadvantaging artists who work in less “bingeable” modes like classical, jazz or experimental music.\n\n[Music X](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2020/12/01/music-streaming-as-a-protocol-why-i-was-wrong-about-audius/)\n\nMusic- and creator-focused DAOs like the [Song That Owns Itself (STOI)](https://stoi.org/), [Seed Club](https://seedclub.xyz/) and [herstoryDAO](https://foundation.app/blog/herstorydao-manifesto) are also becoming increasingly popular for aligning incentives among artists, creative collaborators, fans and industry partners, financially or otherwise. On our panel, Zola Jesus questioned whether DAOs are in any way different from a corporation; Dryhurst offered that the main difference was that “you could see the smart contract as the CEO,” and that “there’s nothing inherent in DAO tools that forces you to see them as a financial vehicle.” (That said, Wyoming recently [passed legislation](https://www.coindesk.com/wyoming-dao-llc-law-passed) that would allow DAOs to register themselves as LLCs.)\n\nStangl emphasized that the appeal of DAOs for underground music communities might be less about financial gain outright, and more about facilitating and managing already-blurred relationships and responsibilities among members. “In the value creation of underground music cultures, the distinction between who is the consumer, vs. who is the artist or marketing person, is often very blurred,” said Stangl. “When you talk about event promotion, in 99% of the cases, that promoter is not a promoter — they’re someone who’s so engaged with the music community that they put their own money into populating the culture … We negotiate that all the time in terms of what audiences contribute, what festivals contribute, what cultural institutions contribute — it’s not as clear-cut as it is in the mainstream music industry.” DAO infrastructure can allow these grassroots communities to “renegotiate those power relationships” with fans and audiences in a transparent and open way.\n\n## Critique and transparency are tools for change\n\nLast but not least, an important theme in our panel discussion was that the critique around music NFTs should not be interpreted as an excuse to shut down the system for good. Rather, voicing concerns at such a formative stage of this technology’s development will allow active stakeholders to shape the role they want it to play within culture and society in the long term. In Thompson’s words: “We’ve seen so much critique of these NFT platforms … and I want to make clear that I think critique is a form of care.”\n\nDavies added that, in an ironic way, the rapid-fire media frenzy around NFTs is also leading to productive conversations more quickly compared to other kinds of technology in recent music history. “It took 10 years for the mainstream to be critical of Spotify, but it took three months for the mainstream to be critical of NFTs,” said Davies. “This criticism is good because it’s getting things more out in the open.”\n\nDryhurst added that the core reason why so many people have become so critical of music NFTs so quickly is also because of the technology's greatest selling point: Transparency.\n\n“I don’t think crypto alone is creating financialization around culture,” said Dryhurst. “I think crypto is putting that on-chain, and making it all visible, guts and all … And one of the pros and cons of decentralization is that there is no ‘one thing’ in this space. If someone is interested in web3, the good news is that there is no central actor telling you how to interact with it. The bad news is that there’s no central actor to impede somebody else from doing something you don’t like. That’s the kind of bargain you enter into when participating in crypto.”\n\nMany crypto community members and researchers are already wielding this transparency for more productive use, in terms of better understanding the power dynamics and economics around NFTs, social tokens, DAOs and other applications of the technology. It’s only because of this transparency, for instance, that we’ve been able to pin down that monthly music NFT sales are down by 80%; that figure is practically impossible to pin down in any other sector of the music business, due to data silos across multiple centralized platforms and companies. Others have also published helpful graphics visualizing [token distribution for various blockchains](https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1394283802009145348), exposing the blockchains that contradict themselves by having mostly centralized ownership (i.e. majority-owned only by the founders and/or investors).\n\nUltimately, this transparency can be a \"net positive\" in that \"we might be able to develop some fluency as to how culture is currently working and is currently traded, and how most people see culture as a vehicle for social capital or even capital-C Capital,” said Dryhurst. “And then from there: What are the protocols that we as an individual, community, label, magazine — what do we want to put in place now? That, to me, is a net positive.” ✯\n\n-----------\n\n*ICYMI: If you enjoyed the above recap and want to support its contributors, you can send tips in ETH that will be evenly distributed among CO:QUO, all the panel speakers, the co-authors of this article and two organizations dedicated to helping marginalized artists navigate the crypto world, namely The Mint Fund and herstoryDAO.*\n\n[CO:QUO panel recap](split://0x9B30a3D0a6577059eBE1f5D674Ecf34FCb0716CA?network=mainnet)", "timestamp": 1624649808, "digest": "EuLRP_H7cSqn48Ypp1UrJ77--rMLrkmF15FaUuoOS3U", "contributor": "0x03e9206f2A1234fEFaD2C0B07A86B1E0f5cB8d0D"}

The word “simulacra” in particular — which refers to the presence of signs and symbols in place of reality — was [popularized first by sociologist Jean Baudrillard](https://web.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html) in the 1980s, then [by the Wachowskis in their renowned film franchise *The Matrix*](https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation).\n\n“Over the last few years, I started to notice signs and symbols replacing all of my realities, which was certainly exacerbated by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic,” said Davies. “But rather than stay with the more dystopian approach that the Wachowskis did with The Matrix, I was more interested in a utopian approach — in building and imagining utopias and new futures, specifically for the music industry.”\n\nThe rapid rise and fall of music NFT hype is a perfect example of people conflating signs and symbols with reality — not just in the literal sense of viewing a JPEG tied to a digital token as equally “authentic” and “real” as the physical world, but also in the metaphorical sense of perpetuating certain myths about how NFTs work and how the artist-fan relationship should look that don’t always line up with the reality of how artists and the music industry operate.\n\n**VÉRITÉ** is an independent artist who has been active in crypto in recent months — most recently selling a portion of master recording royalties for her single “by now” to a fan [in the form of an NFT](https://zora.co/verite/2720). That said, due to current limitations around royalty payments, that revenue split had to be implemented off- rather than on-chain through traditional legal agreements, with the NFT merely acting as an authenticated “purchase receipt” of sorts on top of the song. Other auctions like [Jacques Greene’s “Promise” NFT](https://foundation.app/jacquesgreene/promise-640) and [Lil Dicky’s “Save Dat Money” NFT](https://auctions.royaltyexchange.com/auctions/nft-lil-dickys-save-dat-money-publishing-royalties/) had a similar limitation — i.e. auctioning royalty shares through NFTs, but actually implementing those share agreements through traditional music-industry processes that pay out royalties more slowly.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/2720)\n\nOn this note, during our panel, VÉRITÉ pointed to how two simultaneous conversations were emerging within the music NFT community: “The idealism of what NFTs can be, and the pragmatic and practical reality that we still have to be in relationship with more antiquated systems, especially within the music industry to make that work.” The way in which royalties are collected in particular is a “50-year-old clunky system with a black box that definitely benefits the holders of that black box,” she said.\n\nA sense of pragmatism needs to be considered not only for issues like fractionalized royalty payments, but also for the realities of fan behavior and how everyday people do (or don’t) value culture.\n\nFirst things first: “The masses do not value digital assets,” said VÉRITÉ. “They do not value the MP3. The idea that we’re going to raise the price of a stream beyond 0.004 cents — I don’t believe that is going to happen.” Crypto is also still inaccessible enough such that the vast majority of VÉRITÉ’s fans are not active in that community: “I have probably five fans participating in these things. Until I’m able to issue NFTs with a fiat option and a credit card onboarding ramp, so I can give my fans the experience of owning a digital asset and having them internalize that [experience], they’re not coming over.”\n\nA related misconception in the crypto world is that there is a critical mass of fans who want to act as financial investors in their favorite artists. **Michail Stangl** — who works at [Zora](http://zora.co/) (the protocol that powers Mirror), curates the CTM festival and formerly served as host and lead programmer for Boiler Room — pushed back on this idea that the artist-fan relationship should be financialized in this way by default.\n\n“A future in which every interaction between audiences and musicians is a financial transaction is dystopian to me,” said Stangl. “A lot of spaces that are designing [crypto] technology assume a certain relationship between fans and artists … if your reality is staring at crypto charts all day, you might think my relationship to my favorite artist is one of an investor. But 99% of fans don’t want to handle cultural investment portfolios, tracking which ‘blockchain track’ is the hottest that might create revenue for them if they sell their fractional share. That is not the way we engage with culture.”\n\nIt will take several years to reverse the widespread devaluation of music consumption, which VÉRITÉ suggested is a necessary side effect of overall “market saturation” in music and the fact that “the creation and distribution of music is now fully democratized.” That said, it’s still common knowledge that fans value music in at least some way, even if it’s not reflected in streaming economics.\n\n“They are lovers and consumers of art, and they do want to support the artist — we just need new ways to enable them to give that support,” said VÉRITÉ. “We can add these additional value layers, whether that’s membership to a community, or providing people with an experience that’s bigger than just clicking on something and listening to it.” In this process of devising new means of artist-fan support, this is where it’s important to “center voices who have a pure idealism about what we can build.”\n\n## The myth of NFTs’ speculative value\n\nIndependent artist **Zola Jesus** was one of the more critical voices in our discussion when it came to the current state of crypto in music. In a [previous interview with *Pitchfork*](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/), she had expressed her frustration with the financialization of music NFTs, arguing that the market would only become fair for artists once “the art is being purchased for the merit of what it expresses, rather than what profit it could yield in the future. I don’t want people to bet on me like a racehorse.”\n\n[Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/)\n\nDuring our panel, Zola Jesus expressed similar sentiments. Initially, she said, her impression of NFTs was positive; she had viewed the technology as an antidote for the corporatization of the music industry — particularly for the “disillusionment” she’d experienced while having to navigate “endless corporate structures,” forcing her to “play a game outside of music itself … [Crypto] was a whole new way to create art, and to be able to find homes and support for that art.” \n\nHowever, she quickly became suspicious of the intentions of the buyers of her art, and concerned that her art was just becoming “a means of profiting off speculation.” Rather than representing any real challenge or alternative to mainstream culture, she felt that NFTs in their most hyped-up, auctioned form were simply “further enmeshing us in financial contracts and capitalist frameworks,” with artists being “traded like stocks.” \n\n**Chloe Alexandra Thompson**, who is First Nations (Cree), drew a deeper historical connection between the “cash-grab, transactional rhetoric” around NFTs and “movements around resource extraction and the emergence of new physical colonies on Indigenous land, like mineral mining” (an analogy that is especially relevant given the environmental concerns around proof-of-work blockchains). The end result is an environment where art is merely being “objectified,” rather than “supported and engaged with in a caring way.”\n\nFortunately, the speculative value of NFTs is largely a myth, anyway. For one, the five- to seven-figure auction model has largely fallen out of fashion for music NFTs. According to [research spearheaded by Water & Music](https://www.patreon.com/posts/music-nft-and-2m-46187290), monthly music NFT sales plummeted by 80% from April to May, and is projected to plummet by another 60% to 70% month-over-month in June. Moreover, according to an [economics paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00647.pdf) published by researchers across the U.S. and Europe, under 10% of NFTs that generated a primary sale since 2017 ended up generating a secondary sale within a week, and only 22% generated a secondary sale within a year.\n\n[Music NFT and social token database](https://www.patreon.com/posts/music-nft-and-2m-46187290)\n\nArtist and researcher **Mat Dryhurst** suggested that mainstream media incentives had a lot to do with NFTs’ rise and subsequent fall. In search of sensationalist news, mainstream media outlets automatically navigated towards the six- to eight-figure sales coming out from only a small handful of platforms and actors in the NFT market, even if those outlets had only a rudimentary understanding of how NFTs actually worked. At one point, [even SNL got on board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrNOYudaMAc&ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive).\n\n“Even in a decentralized ecosystem, you don’t get to decide when people choose to pay attention to things,” he said. “Now, everyone associates ‘web3’ with ridiculous valuations for things that are quite clearly entangled in some dodgy stuff.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest example of this dodginess that seems to have gone over many people’s heads is that the buyer of Beeple’s [$69 million NFT on Christie’s](https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/first-open-beeple/beeple-b-1981-1/112924) — Vignesh Sundaresan, a.k.a. [MetaKovan](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/07/buyer-of-69-million-dollar-beeple-art-metakovan-on-nfts.html) — had a clear conflict of interest. Sundaresan himself is working on his own NFT platform called [Metapurse](https://www.metapurse.fund/), which offers fractionalized investment opportunities in bundles of NFT artworks. The company makes “B20 tokens” available for fans and investors to purchase and trade themselves to represent a stake in the fund. The kicker: Metapurse gave Beeple 2% of B20’s entire token supply shortly before purchasing the artist’s record-breaking NFT. As Ben Davis [wrote for *Artnet*](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/beeple-buyers-metakovan-twobadour-1953418), “This means that Beeple essentially owns 2 percent of the fund that purchased his work at auction.” Of course, the value of the B20 token then went up 13x in the days following the Christie’s sale.\n\n[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/07/buyer-of-69-million-dollar-beeple-art-metakovan-on-nfts.html)\n\n“Someone will drop like $30 million on an NFT, which of course sounds like an insane amount of money — but then when you follow the price of the token that they own, a billion dollars in value gets added to the company,” said Dryhurst. “That’s a marketing campaign. It’s what marketing is: You invest money in order to get returns later. Of course, the media loves these kinds of big-ticket narratives, and bought into it — meanwhile, protocols like Zora and many others are quietly building something which is at odds with that mentality and those objectives.”\n\nThis media miscommunication probably led a lot of investors to lose their money on NFT sales, creating a general disillusionment in the market that led to a 90% dip in month-over-month sales in May. Once again, though, the media was incentivized to cover the downfall of the hype that they themselves created. “I think there’s been a bit of a sabotage campaign between the highly coordinated actors pushing for a very specific vision of how [NFTs] work, and a media that is very, very thirsty to write about bad news,” said Dryhurst.\n\nStangl agreed, elaborating that the notion of NFTs as “provenance” or as artificially scarce digital collectibles is “only half the story.” Instead, in Zora’s case, Stangl explained that the protocol is even more about redefining and redistributing value than merely about capturing more of it. “Our goal is build an open-source infrastructure that allows anyone to use NFTs to make two fundamental decisions: A, what has value — it can be monetary or something more abstract, social and participatory — and B, how do you distribute that value?” said Stangl. “That allows you to create a matrix where anything from maximizing your personal wealth and selling your asset at the highest value possible, to new models of collective co-creation and redistribution, are possible.”\n\nThis brings us to the next section… \n\n## Reconciling the tension between the highly individualized, libertarian origins of crypto and more collective practices in music\n\nOne major gap in a lot of music-industry conversations about crypto, Web3 and smart contracts is that these technologies aren’t just about creating new ways to sell more stuff. At scale, they’re about creating entirely new ways of governing and constituting societies. (Light stuff, we know.)\n\n“You’re moving on a constitutional level, where you provide rule sets on how one should constitute oneself, in a social system that is utilizing smart contracts to constitute, govern and process itself,” said Stangl. “The question then is, what do you center in terms of your definition of societies? That is the really exciting thing — ultimately what you are creating are blueprints.”\n\nThe crypto platforms that have gotten the most mainstream media coverage to date tend to center a more libertarian view of sovereignty, self-ownership and individual autonomy as opposed to collective action. Cherie mentioned [BitClout](https://bitclout.com/) as one of the most extreme versions of this philosophy in practice, where someone’s individual value is investable, tradable and entirely tethered to their social clout — an extension of the individualism rampant in influencer and “creator” culture.\n\nImportantly, though, the whole point of decentralization is *not* to ask people to conform to a singular view of society. “If you look at societies that center solidarity or neutrality in the way that they constitute themselves … you can now put those principles into a smart contract and make it part of the blueprint,” said Stangl. “It’s not just a box that you tick at checkout, like, ‘here’s your 1 euro of solidarity if you want it.’ It can be part of the deeper technological blueprint, so that anything you do in the system is rooted in solidarity.”\n\nA big source of current music/crypto tensions, then, is what Stangl calls “a cultural clash, where a lot of crypto and blockchain is coming from a particular sociodemographic group with a particular view on how society works” (read: libertarianism). This is arguably in conflict with the more collective ways in which many artist and fan communities organize and interact with each other — a conflict that the artists clearly voiced during our panel.\n\nZola Jesus was particularly critical of crypto models that seemed to wring creative control and authority away from artists. “That’s something I don’t want to feel like I have to negotiate with my fans … like they have some sort of authority over what music I make or what direction I take as an artist,” she said. “I guess I’m a little more punk in that way, where I don’t want to feel that level of financial tether to a fan base. I don’t want to just become a stock, or feel like I’m getting further embedded into a financial structure that is going to only limit or suppress wherever I want to take my art and my passion. That’s been my biggest concern.” Zola Jesus does have an [active Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/zolajesus) with around 700 members, but she said that that experience has made her feel more protected from the isolation and the “sea of competition and market performance in the music industry … I feel supported in a way that breeds charity, compassion and breeds community.”\n\nThompson was similarly interested in an implementation of crypto that better reflected the collaboration and interdependence of creative communities. “What I’m more interested in around 3.0 and decentralization is not so much this replication of, ‘I’m a popular artist or I’m getting discovered in the crypto community, thus I get much money,’” said Thompson. “It’s about how we can collectivize and create independent agencies which allow for group safety and redistribution of resources — thinking about the past record-label model not in the problematic way where artists have been excluded … but how advances were made at varying tiers of people’s careers to help bring them up and support their practice, and how that supports mixing engineers, producers and all these different people who are part of making work.”\n\nVÉRITÉ more openly acknowledged the notion that, yes, her fans are investing multiple kinds of resources into her work and community “all the time — whether it’s listening to my music, coming to my tour, buying my merch,” she said. Hence, crypto at large could be a valuable tool for her to “give fans an incentive to participate and become a meaningful part of the community, and raise the community’s overall value. And then it’s actually really easy to weed out bad actors, because if you’re just buying my NFT as a speculative thing, you’re probably not going to contribute value into the fan community because that takes a lot of heart, time and effort.”\n\nThe point, though, is that the value of the community is self-sustaining, and is something that exists beyond just the individual artist — which VÉRITÉ suggested could act as a safeguard from the kind of mercenary profiteering that artists like Zola Jesus understandably have reservations about. “My Discord server exists without me,” said VÉRITÉ. “I’ve built a community of people who like to hang out and can entertain themselves while I go away for a month. That becomes the goal, where the community isn’t fully dependent on me as this pillar and this center, but where you’re building something that has a greater meaning than just yourself.”\n\n## Letting artists control not only the flow of money, but also the incentives\n\nMoving a bit beyond just NFTs, much of the panel discussion focused on the value of protocols and DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) at large for giving artists the control and ownership they’ve been demanding from centralized platforms for decades.\n\n“Spotify and Instagram were designed with one thing in mind: To profit the bottom lines of the people who designed them,” said Stangl. “All of the functions and business outcomes were in essence predefined, to benefit those who designed the systems.” (Investor Li Jin posted a [lengthy Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1408103654863814657) this week with the same argument: “Without ownership … Creators, by working, are strengthening platform owners’ domination over their ability to work.”)\n\n[Li Jin](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1408103654863814657)\n\nSimilarly, one of the main reasons big-ticket NFT auctions seem like the “only” outcome of the NFT ecosystem is because a small handful of platforms have largely been responsible for driving the now-mainstream media narratives. “We have to give artists the tools to make those design decisions in an informed way, and then benefit from the outcome of those decisions,” said Stangl. “A lot of these things don’t need mitigation or third parties that inject themselves into a particular revenue stream. They can still participate, of course, and still create a value proposition, but that value cannot be justified just by injecting yourself into the part where money passes from one hand to another.”\n\nOne such way to give artists control over their own platforms is through protocols that allow them to code their own economics into their creative works. For instance, Bas Grasmayer [wrote last year](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2020/12/01/music-streaming-as-a-protocol-why-i-was-wrong-about-audius/) about how companies like Audius are trying to let artists use smart contracts to set their own per-stream rates for consumption of their music online. Protocols like Zora — and the platforms that run on them, like Mirror and [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/) — give artists the ability to bring in multiple collaborators to share revenue on a given creative work, or even [wire funds instantaneously to public goods](https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw). During our panel, Cherie mentioned that this could lead to a greater diversity of artists getting rewarded for their work — instead of merely “incentivizing repeat consumption” as the dominant DSPs do, which arguably gives an advantage to pop artists while disadvantaging artists who work in less “bingeable” modes like classical, jazz or experimental music.\n\n[Music X](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2020/12/01/music-streaming-as-a-protocol-why-i-was-wrong-about-audius/)\n\nMusic- and creator-focused DAOs like the [Song That Owns Itself (STOI)](https://stoi.org/), [Seed Club](https://seedclub.xyz/) and [herstoryDAO](https://foundation.app/blog/herstorydao-manifesto) are also becoming increasingly popular for aligning incentives among artists, creative collaborators, fans and industry partners, financially or otherwise. On our panel, Zola Jesus questioned whether DAOs are in any way different from a corporation; Dryhurst offered that the main difference was that “you could see the smart contract as the CEO,” and that “there’s nothing inherent in DAO tools that forces you to see them as a financial vehicle.” (That said, Wyoming recently [passed legislation](https://www.coindesk.com/wyoming-dao-llc-law-passed) that would allow DAOs to register themselves as LLCs.)\n\nStangl emphasized that the appeal of DAOs for underground music communities might be less about financial gain outright, and more about facilitating and managing already-blurred relationships and responsibilities among members. “In the value creation of underground music cultures, the distinction between who is the consumer, vs. who is the artist or marketing person, is often very blurred,” said Stangl. “When you talk about event promotion, in 99% of the cases, that promoter is not a promoter — they’re someone who’s so engaged with the music community that they put their own money into populating the culture … We negotiate that all the time in terms of what audiences contribute, what festivals contribute, what cultural institutions contribute — it’s not as clear-cut as it is in the mainstream music industry.” DAO infrastructure can allow these grassroots communities to “renegotiate those power relationships” with fans and audiences in a transparent and open way.\n\n## Critique and transparency are tools for change\n\nLast but not least, an important theme in our panel discussion was that the critique around music NFTs should not be interpreted as an excuse to shut down the system for good. Rather, voicing concerns at such a formative stage of this technology’s development will allow active stakeholders to shape the role they want it to play within culture and society in the long term. In Thompson’s words: “We’ve seen so much critique of these NFT platforms … and I want to make clear that I think critique is a form of care.”\n\nDavies added that, in an ironic way, the rapid-fire media frenzy around NFTs is also leading to productive conversations more quickly compared to other kinds of technology in recent music history. “It took 10 years for the mainstream to be critical of Spotify, but it took three months for the mainstream to be critical of NFTs,” said Davies. “This criticism is good because it’s getting things more out in the open.”\n\nDryhurst added that the core reason why so many people have become so critical of music NFTs so quickly is also because of the technology's greatest selling point: Transparency.\n\n“I don’t think crypto alone is creating financialization around culture,” said Dryhurst. “I think crypto is putting that on-chain, and making it all visible, guts and all … And one of the pros and cons of decentralization is that there is no ‘one thing’ in this space. If someone is interested in web3, the good news is that there is no central actor telling you how to interact with it. The bad news is that there’s no central actor to impede somebody else from doing something you don’t like. That’s the kind of bargain you enter into when participating in crypto.”\n\nMany crypto community members and researchers are already wielding this transparency for more productive use, in terms of better understanding the power dynamics and economics around NFTs, social tokens, DAOs and other applications of the technology. It’s only because of this transparency, for instance, that we’ve been able to pin down that monthly music NFT sales are down by 80%; that figure is practically impossible to pin down in any other sector of the music business, due to data silos across multiple centralized platforms and companies. Others have also published helpful graphics visualizing [token distribution for various blockchains](https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1394283802009145348), exposing the blockchains that contradict themselves by having mostly centralized ownership (i.e. majority-owned only by the founders and/or investors).\n\nUltimately, this transparency can be a \"net positive\" in that \"we might be able to develop some fluency as to how culture is currently working and is currently traded, and how most people see culture as a vehicle for social capital or even capital-C Capital,” said Dryhurst. “And then from there: What are the protocols that we as an individual, community, label, magazine — what do we want to put in place now?

With a healthy dose of skepticism and criticism, the discussion dissected not only how artists can leverage NFTs to gain more ownership over their careers, but also the significant cultural, financial and ethical risks associated with this emerging infrastructure that tend to get overlooked in mainstream music-industry conversations.\n\nThe full recording of the panel is [available on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=451919682566367&ref=watch_permalink), but we also wanted to publish a text recap of the key themes and takeaways here on Mirror.

The word “simulacra” in particular — which refers to the presence of signs and symbols in place of reality — was [popularized first by sociologist Jean Baudrillard](https://web.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html) in the 1980s, then [by the Wachowskis in their renowned film franchise *The Matrix*](https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation).\n\n“Over the last few years, I started to notice signs and symbols replacing all of my realities, which was certainly exacerbated by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic,” said Davies. “But rather than stay with the more dystopian approach that the Wachowskis did with The Matrix, I was more interested in a utopian approach — in building and imagining utopias and new futures, specifically for the music industry.”\n\nThe rapid rise and fall of music NFT hype is a perfect example of people conflating signs and symbols with reality — not just in the literal sense of viewing a JPEG tied to a digital token as equally “authentic” and “real” as the physical world, but also in the metaphorical sense of perpetuating certain myths about how NFTs work and how the artist-fan relationship should look that don’t always line up with the reality of how artists and the music industry operate.\n\n**VÉRITÉ** is an independent artist who has been active in crypto in recent months — most recently selling a portion of master recording royalties for her single “by now” to a fan [in the form of an NFT](https://zora.co/verite/2720). That said, due to current limitations around royalty payments, that revenue split had to be implemented off- rather than on-chain through traditional legal agreements, with the NFT merely acting as an authenticated “purchase receipt” of sorts on top of the song. Other auctions like [Jacques Greene’s “Promise” NFT](https://foundation.app/jacquesgreene/promise-640) and [Lil Dicky’s “Save Dat Money” NFT](https://auctions.royaltyexchange.com/auctions/nft-lil-dickys-save-dat-money-publishing-royalties/) had a similar limitation — i.e. auctioning royalty shares through NFTs, but actually implementing those share agreements through traditional music-industry processes that pay out royalties more slowly.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/2720)\n\nOn this note, during our panel, VÉRITÉ pointed to how two simultaneous conversations were emerging within the music NFT community: “The idealism of what NFTs can be, and the pragmatic and practical reality that we still have to be in relationship with more antiquated systems, especially within the music industry to make that work.” The way in which royalties are collected in particular is a “50-year-old clunky system with a black box that definitely benefits the holders of that black box,” she said.\n\nA sense of pragmatism needs to be considered not only for issues like fractionalized royalty payments, but also for the realities of fan behavior and how everyday people do (or don’t) value culture.\n\nFirst things first: “The masses do not value digital assets,” said VÉRITÉ. “They do not value the MP3. The idea that we’re going to raise the price of a stream beyond 0.004 cents — I don’t believe that is going to happen.” Crypto is also still inaccessible enough such that the vast majority of VÉRITÉ’s fans are not active in that community: “I have probably five fans participating in these things. Until I’m able to issue NFTs with a fiat option and a credit card onboarding ramp, so I can give my fans the experience of owning a digital asset and having them internalize that [experience], they’re not coming over.”\n\nA related misconception in the crypto world is that there is a critical mass of fans who want to act as financial investors in their favorite artists. **Michail Stangl** — who works at [Zora](http://zora.co/) (the protocol that powers Mirror), curates the CTM festival and formerly served as host and lead programmer for Boiler Room — pushed back on this idea that the artist-fan relationship should be financialized in this way by default.\n\n“A future in which every interaction between audiences and musicians is a financial transaction is dystopian to me,” said Stangl. “A lot of spaces that are designing [crypto] technology assume a certain relationship between fans and artists … if your reality is staring at crypto charts all day, you might think my relationship to my favorite artist is one of an investor. But 99% of fans don’t want to handle cultural investment portfolios, tracking which ‘blockchain track’ is the hottest that might create revenue for them if they sell their fractional share. That is not the way we engage with culture.”\n\nIt will take several years to reverse the widespread devaluation of music consumption, which VÉRITÉ suggested is a necessary side effect of overall “market saturation” in music and the fact that “the creation and distribution of music is now fully democratized.” That said, it’s still common knowledge that fans value music in at least some way, even if it’s not reflected in streaming economics.\n\n“They are lovers and consumers of art, and they do want to support the artist — we just need new ways to enable them to give that support,” said VÉRITÉ. “We can add these additional value layers, whether that’s membership to a community, or providing people with an experience that’s bigger than just clicking on something and listening to it.” In this process of devising new means of artist-fan support, this is where it’s important to “center voices who have a pure idealism about what we can build.”\n\n## The myth of NFTs’ speculative value\n\nIndependent artist **Zola Jesus** was one of the more critical voices in our discussion when it came to the current state of crypto in music. In a [previous interview with *Pitchfork*](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/), she had expressed her frustration with the financialization of music NFTs, arguing that the market would only become fair for artists once “the art is being purchased for the merit of what it expresses, rather than what profit it could yield in the future. I don’t want people to bet on me like a racehorse.”\n\n[Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/)\n\nDuring our panel, Zola Jesus expressed similar sentiments. Initially, she said, her impression of NFTs was positive; she had viewed the technology as an antidote for the corporatization of the music industry — particularly for the “disillusionment” she’d experienced while having to navigate “endless corporate structures,” forcing her to “play a game outside of music itself … [Crypto] was a whole new way to create art, and to be able to find homes and support for that art.” \n\nHowever, she quickly became suspicious of the intentions of the buyers of her art, and concerned that her art was just becoming “a means of profiting off speculation.” Rather than representing any real challenge or alternative to mainstream culture, she felt that NFTs in their most hyped-up, auctioned form were simply “further enmeshing us in financial contracts and capitalist frameworks,” with artists being “traded like stocks.” \n\n**Chloe Alexandra Thompson**, who is First Nations (Cree), drew a deeper historical connection between the “cash-grab, transactional rhetoric” around NFTs and “movements around resource extraction and the emergence of new physical colonies on Indigenous land, like mineral mining” (an analogy that is especially relevant given the environmental concerns around proof-of-work blockchains). The end result is an environment where art is merely being “objectified,” rather than “supported and engaged with in a caring way.”\n\nFortunately, the speculative value of NFTs is largely a myth, anyway. For one, the five- to seven-figure auction model has largely fallen out of fashion for music NFTs. According to [research spearheaded by Water & Music](https://www.patreon.com/posts/music-nft-and-2m-46187290), monthly music NFT sales plummeted by 80% from April to May, and is projected to plummet by another 60% to 70% month-over-month in June. Moreover, according to an [economics paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00647.pdf) published by researchers across the U.S. and Europe, under 10% of NFTs that generated a primary sale since 2017 ended up generating a secondary sale within a week, and only 22% generated a secondary sale within a year.\n\n[Music NFT and social token database](https://www.patreon.com/posts/music-nft-and-2m-46187290)\n\nArtist and researcher **Mat Dryhurst** suggested that mainstream media incentives had a lot to do with NFTs’ rise and subsequent fall. In search of sensationalist news, mainstream media outlets automatically navigated towards the six- to eight-figure sales coming out from only a small handful of platforms and actors in the NFT market, even if those outlets had only a rudimentary understanding of how NFTs actually worked. At one point, [even SNL got on board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrNOYudaMAc&ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive).\n\n“Even in a decentralized ecosystem, you don’t get to decide when people choose to pay attention to things,” he said. “Now, everyone associates ‘web3’ with ridiculous valuations for things that are quite clearly entangled in some dodgy stuff.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest example of this dodginess that seems to have gone over many people’s heads is that the buyer of Beeple’s [$69 million NFT on Christie’s](https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/first-open-beeple/beeple-b-1981-1/112924) — Vignesh Sundaresan, a.k.a. [MetaKovan](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/07/buyer-of-69-million-dollar-beeple-art-metakovan-on-nfts.html) — had a clear conflict of interest. Sundaresan himself is working on his own NFT platform called [Metapurse](https://www.metapurse.fund/), which offers fractionalized investment opportunities in bundles of NFT artworks. The company makes “B20 tokens” available for fans and investors to purchase and trade themselves to represent a stake in the fund. The kicker: Metapurse gave Beeple 2% of B20’s entire token supply shortly before purchasing the artist’s record-breaking NFT. As Ben Davis [wrote for *Artnet*](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/beeple-buyers-metakovan-twobadour-1953418), “This means that Beeple essentially owns 2 percent of the fund that purchased his work at auction.” Of course, the value of the B20 token then went up 13x in the days following the Christie’s sale.\n\n[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/07/buyer-of-69-million-dollar-beeple-art-metakovan-on-nfts.html)\n\n“Someone will drop like $30 million on an NFT, which of course sounds like an insane amount of money — but then when you follow the price of the token that they own, a billion dollars in value gets added to the company,” said Dryhurst. “That’s a marketing campaign. It’s what marketing is: You invest money in order to get returns later. Of course, the media loves these kinds of big-ticket narratives, and bought into it — meanwhile, protocols like Zora and many others are quietly building something which is at odds with that mentality and those objectives.”\n\nThis media miscommunication probably led a lot of investors to lose their money on NFT sales, creating a general disillusionment in the market that led to a 90% dip in month-over-month sales in May. Once again, though, the media was incentivized to cover the downfall of the hype that they themselves created. “I think there’s been a bit of a sabotage campaign between the highly coordinated actors pushing for a very specific vision of how [NFTs] work, and a media that is very, very thirsty to write about bad news,” said Dryhurst.\n\nStangl agreed, elaborating that the notion of NFTs as “provenance” or as artificially scarce digital collectibles is “only half the story.” Instead, in Zora’s case, Stangl explained that the protocol is even more about redefining and redistributing value than merely about capturing more of it. “Our goal is build an open-source infrastructure that allows anyone to use NFTs to make two fundamental decisions: A, what has value — it can be monetary or something more abstract, social and participatory — and B, how do you distribute that value?” said Stangl. “That allows you to create a matrix where anything from maximizing your personal wealth and selling your asset at the highest value possible, to new models of collective co-creation and redistribution, are possible.”\n\nThis brings us to the next section… \n\n## Reconciling the tension between the highly individualized, libertarian origins of crypto and more collective practices in music\n\nOne major gap in a lot of music-industry conversations about crypto, Web3 and smart contracts is that these technologies aren’t just about creating new ways to sell more stuff. At scale, they’re about creating entirely new ways of governing and constituting societies. (Light stuff, we know.)\n\n“You’re moving on a constitutional level, where you provide rule sets on how one should constitute oneself, in a social system that is utilizing smart contracts to constitute, govern and process itself,” said Stangl. “The question then is, what do you center in terms of your definition of societies? That is the really exciting thing — ultimately what you are creating are blueprints.”\n\nThe crypto platforms that have gotten the most mainstream media coverage to date tend to center a more libertarian view of sovereignty, self-ownership and individual autonomy as opposed to collective action. Cherie mentioned [BitClout](https://bitclout.com/) as one of the most extreme versions of this philosophy in practice, where someone’s individual value is investable, tradable and entirely tethered to their social clout — an extension of the individualism rampant in influencer and “creator” culture.\n\nImportantly, though, the whole point of decentralization is *not* to ask people to conform to a singular view of society. “If you look at societies that center solidarity or neutrality in the way that they constitute themselves … you can now put those principles into a smart contract and make it part of the blueprint,” said Stangl. “It’s not just a box that you tick at checkout, like, ‘here’s your 1 euro of solidarity if you want it.’ It can be part of the deeper technological blueprint, so that anything you do in the system is rooted in solidarity.”\n\nA big source of current music/crypto tensions, then, is what Stangl calls “a cultural clash, where a lot of crypto and blockchain is coming from a particular sociodemographic group with a particular view on how society works” (read: libertarianism). This is arguably in conflict with the more collective ways in which many artist and fan communities organize and interact with each other — a conflict that the artists clearly voiced during our panel.\n\nZola Jesus was particularly critical of crypto models that seemed to wring creative control and authority away from artists. “That’s something I don’t want to feel like I have to negotiate with my fans … like they have some sort of authority over what music I make or what direction I take as an artist,” she said. “I guess I’m a little more punk in that way, where I don’t want to feel that level of financial tether to a fan base. I don’t want to just become a stock, or feel like I’m getting further embedded into a financial structure that is going to only limit or suppress wherever I want to take my art and my passion. That’s been my biggest concern.” Zola Jesus does have an [active Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/zolajesus) with around 700 members, but she said that that experience has made her feel more protected from the isolation and the “sea of competition and market performance in the music industry … I feel supported in a way that breeds charity, compassion and breeds community.”\n\nThompson was similarly interested in an implementation of crypto that better reflected the collaboration and interdependence of creative communities. “What I’m more interested in around 3.0 and decentralization is not so much this replication of, ‘I’m a popular artist or I’m getting discovered in the crypto community, thus I get much money,’” said Thompson. “It’s about how we can collectivize and create independent agencies which allow for group safety and redistribution of resources — thinking about the past record-label model not in the problematic way where artists have been excluded … but how advances were made at varying tiers of people’s careers to help bring them up and support their practice, and how that supports mixing engineers, producers and all these different people who are part of making work.”\n\nVÉRITÉ more openly acknowledged the notion that, yes, her fans are investing multiple kinds of resources into her work and community “all the time — whether it’s listening to my music, coming to my tour, buying my merch,” she said. Hence, crypto at large could be a valuable tool for her to “give fans an incentive to participate and become a meaningful part of the community, and raise the community’s overall value. And then it’s actually really easy to weed out bad actors, because if you’re just buying my NFT as a speculative thing, you’re probably not going to contribute value into the fan community because that takes a lot of heart, time and effort.”\n\nThe point, though, is that the value of the community is self-sustaining, and is something that exists beyond just the individual artist — which VÉRITÉ suggested could act as a safeguard from the kind of mercenary profiteering that artists like Zola Jesus understandably have reservations about. “My Discord server exists without me,” said VÉRITÉ. “I’ve built a community of people who like to hang out and can entertain themselves while I go away for a month. That becomes the goal, where the community isn’t fully dependent on me as this pillar and this center, but where you’re building something that has a greater meaning than just yourself.”\n\n## Letting artists control not only the flow of money, but also the incentives\n\nMoving a bit beyond just NFTs, much of the panel discussion focused on the value of protocols and DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) at large for giving artists the control and ownership they’ve been demanding from centralized platforms for decades.\n\n“Spotify and Instagram were designed with one thing in mind: To profit the bottom lines of the people who designed them,” said Stangl. “All of the functions and business outcomes were in essence predefined, to benefit those who designed the systems.” (Investor Li Jin posted a [lengthy Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1408103654863814657) this week with the same argument: “Without ownership … Creators, by working, are strengthening platform owners’ domination over their ability to work.”)\n\n[Li Jin](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1408103654863814657)\n\nSimilarly, one of the main reasons big-ticket NFT auctions seem like the “only” outcome of the NFT ecosystem is because a small handful of platforms have largely been responsible for driving the now-mainstream media narratives. “We have to give artists the tools to make those design decisions in an informed way, and then benefit from the outcome of those decisions,” said Stangl. “A lot of these things don’t need mitigation or third parties that inject themselves into a particular revenue stream. They can still participate, of course, and still create a value proposition, but that value cannot be justified just by injecting yourself into the part where money passes from one hand to another.”\n\nOne such way to give artists control over their own platforms is through protocols that allow them to code their own economics into their creative works. For instance, Bas Grasmayer [wrote last year](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2020/12/01/music-streaming-as-a-protocol-why-i-was-wrong-about-audius/) about how companies like Audius are trying to let artists use smart contracts to set their own per-stream rates for consumption of their music online. Protocols like Zora — and the platforms that run on them, like Mirror and [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/) — give artists the ability to bring in multiple collaborators to share revenue on a given creative work, or even [wire funds instantaneously to public goods](https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw). During our panel, Cherie mentioned that this could lead to a greater diversity of artists getting rewarded for their work — instead of merely “incentivizing repeat consumption” as the dominant DSPs do, which arguably gives an advantage to pop artists while disadvantaging artists who work in less “bingeable” modes like classical, jazz or experimental music.\n\n[Music X](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2020/12/01/music-streaming-as-a-protocol-why-i-was-wrong-about-audius/)\n\nMusic- and creator-focused DAOs like the [Song That Owns Itself (STOI)](https://stoi.org/), [Seed Club](https://seedclub.xyz/) and [herstoryDAO](https://foundation.app/blog/herstorydao-manifesto) are also becoming increasingly popular for aligning incentives among artists, creative collaborators, fans and industry partners, financially or otherwise. On our panel, Zola Jesus questioned whether DAOs are in any way different from a corporation; Dryhurst offered that the main difference was that “you could see the smart contract as the CEO,” and that “there’s nothing inherent in DAO tools that forces you to see them as a financial vehicle.” (That said, Wyoming recently [passed legislation](https://www.coindesk.com/wyoming-dao-llc-law-passed) that would allow DAOs to register themselves as LLCs.)\n\nStangl emphasized that the appeal of DAOs for underground music communities might be less about financial gain outright, and more about facilitating and managing already-blurred relationships and responsibilities among members. “In the value creation of underground music cultures, the distinction between who is the consumer, vs. who is the artist or marketing person, is often very blurred,” said Stangl. “When you talk about event promotion, in 99% of the cases, that promoter is not a promoter — they’re someone who’s so engaged with the music community that they put their own money into populating the culture … We negotiate that all the time in terms of what audiences contribute, what festivals contribute, what cultural institutions contribute — it’s not as clear-cut as it is in the mainstream music industry.” DAO infrastructure can allow these grassroots communities to “renegotiate those power relationships” with fans and audiences in a transparent and open way.\n\n## Critique and transparency are tools for change\n\nLast but not least, an important theme in our panel discussion was that the critique around music NFTs should not be interpreted as an excuse to shut down the system for good. Rather, voicing concerns at such a formative stage of this technology’s development will allow active stakeholders to shape the role they want it to play within culture and society in the long term. In Thompson’s words: “We’ve seen so much critique of these NFT platforms … and I want to make clear that I think critique is a form of care.”\n\nDavies added that, in an ironic way, the rapid-fire media frenzy around NFTs is also leading to productive conversations more quickly compared to other kinds of technology in recent music history. “It took 10 years for the mainstream to be critical of Spotify, but it took three months for the mainstream to be critical of NFTs,” said Davies. “This criticism is good because it’s getting things more out in the open.”\n\nDryhurst added that the core reason why so many people have become so critical of music NFTs so quickly is also because of the technology's greatest selling point: Transparency.\n\n“I don’t think crypto alone is creating financialization around culture,” said Dryhurst. “I think crypto is putting that on-chain, and making it all visible, guts and all … And one of the pros and cons of decentralization is that there is no ‘one thing’ in this space. If someone is interested in web3, the good news is that there is no central actor telling you how to interact with it. The bad news is that there’s no central actor to impede somebody else from doing something you don’t like. That’s the kind of bargain you enter into when participating in crypto.”\n\nMany crypto community members and researchers are already wielding this transparency for more productive use, in terms of better understanding the power dynamics and economics around NFTs, social tokens, DAOs and other applications of the technology. It’s only because of this transparency, for instance, that we’ve been able to pin down that monthly music NFT sales are down by 80%; that figure is practically impossible to pin down in any other sector of the music business, due to data silos across multiple centralized platforms and companies. Others have also published helpful graphics visualizing [token distribution for various blockchains](https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1394283802009145348), exposing the blockchains that contradict themselves by having mostly centralized ownership (i.e. majority-owned only by the founders and/or investors).\n\n\"Ultimately, we might be able to develop some fluency as to how culture is currently working and is currently traded, and how most people see culture as a vehicle for social capital or even capital-C Capital,” said Dryhurst. “And then from there: What are the protocols that we as an individual, community, label, magazine — what do we want to put in place now? That, to me, is a net positive.” ✯\n\n-----------\n\n*ICYMI: If you enjoyed the above recap and want to support its contributors, you can send tips in ETH that will be evenly distributed among CO:QUO, all the panel speakers, the co-authors of this article and two organizations dedicated to helping marginalized artists navigate the crypto world, namely The Mint Fund and herstoryDAO.*\n\n[CO:QUO panel recap](split://0x9B30a3D0a6577059eBE1f5D674Ecf34FCb0716CA?network=mainnet)", "timestamp": 1624650056, "digest": "EuLRP_H7cSqn48Ypp1UrJ77--rMLrkmF15FaUuoOS3U", "contributor": "0x03e9206f2A1234fEFaD2C0B07A86B1E0f5cB8d0D"}

I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn’t meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you’d think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend’s living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn’t just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it’s not just a technology. It’s a philosophy. It’s a belief system. It’s a way of viewing the world. It’s about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you’re batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood. I remember the “aha moment” when I wrote my first smart contract. With just a few lines of code and a private key, I was able to transfer an internet-native currency anywhere in the world in seconds. \n\nI didn’t have to sign up for Stripe. I didn’t have to use the Plaid API to connect a bank account. I didn’t have to check if TransferWise supported payments for a specific country. There was no centralized party. Just a peer-to-peer cryptonetwork called Ethereum. It was pretty damn mindblowing.\n\nAfter the first few weeks at Dharma, I was confident that DeFi and crypto were the future. But I also got the itch to work on some of my own ideas. I wanted to build software for creative people. Writers. Artists. Musicians. Online teachers. I strongly believe our world depends on these types of people having the tools they need to serve their communities as best they can.\n\nFrankly, I also thought it would take a couple years before the crypto industry had the infrastructure in place for a mainstream consumer app to be built.\n\n\nSo I ended up leaving Dharma to take some time off and explore a few startup ideas. But a couple months ago I read a [manifesto](https://cryptomedia.wtf/) by [Zora](https://zora.co/) that changed how I thought about crypto.\n\nIt described a world where crypto could be used to give any digital media file (eg an image, a song, an essay, digital art, etc.) property rights. It explained how cryptonetworks could turn digital media into liquid financial assets, secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts.\n\nAlthough the individual ideas weren’t new, they were combined and articulated in a way that just made sense. And not just to me.\n\n[Digital artists](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9), [athletes](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html), [social media influencers](https://cryptoslate.com/logan-paul-nfts-sell-3-5-million-worth-on-first-day-of-release/), [tech executives](https://scottbelsky.medium.com/the-furry-lisa-cryptoart-the-new-economy-of-digital-creativity-6cb2300ea081), [media executives](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI), and [journalists](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1366554892035219462) that never took the crypto weirdos seriously, seem to be taking notice.\n\nBut let’s be real. Is this latest NFT craze a bubble? Probz. Yet, is there at least a kernel of value in the idea of ownership over creative work? I think so.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell, there’s been a lot of talk about high transaction fees and lack of scalability in these systems. Although I do think these problems should and will get fixed, a lack of technical scalability is kinda the point.\n\nCryptonetworks trade off technical scalability for social scalability.\n\nFacebook is technically scalable because it’s a social network that processes millions of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is socially scalable because it’s a trillion dollar economic network without a centralized authority.\n\nCrypto isn’t just a technological revolution. It’s also a revolution in capital formation and human coordination. How creative projects are funded. How groups of people are incentivized. How organizations are structured.\n\nYears from now, when I’m old and senile, I believe we’ll look back at this period as an [Internet Renaissance](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1343210395704541189) of sorts. \n\nA time where we dared to fight back against systems that have been designed for centuries to elevate certain groups and keep others disenfranchised.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe all this crypto stuff really is just an intellectual ideal that’ll never work in practice. Regardless, I think it’s at least worth trying.", "timestamp": 1624665511, "digest": "pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}
