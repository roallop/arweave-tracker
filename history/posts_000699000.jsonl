But the ghosts of the civic and religious organizations that were once the core organizing principle of American communal life. You can see them in the fading signs for men’s fraternities and women’s leagues that no longer meet, the labor halls renovated for restaurants and condos, and the community centers for ethnic and immigrant groups that have long since decamped for the suburbs. You can see those ghosts in the statues of beloved (often dubious) heroes that were erected by the regiments (or descendants) of veterans of various wars, the money painstakingly raised through membership subscription. Most of all, you can see them in the old churches, each for a subtly different but vigorous denomination, once the pride of their parishioners, now usually empty. \n\nIn his famous 1995 essay, “[Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital](http://mktgsensei.com/AMAE/Consumer%20Behavior/bowlingalone.pdf),” Robert Putnam chronicled the remarkable depth and diversity of the communal groups of the United States. Tracing the trajectory from the earliest colonists of the United States, he showed how Tocqueville’s observation that, “Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all minds” were “constantly joining together in groups,” was even more true following the waves of immigration of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These newcomers, faced with difficult circumstances and often hostile neighbors, banded together for mutual support and status. They paid their dues, sat on committees, went to banquets, and advocated for collective causes. And because even long-settled Americans were migrants as they moved West, similar ‘joining behaviors’ spread to the newer cities and towns. \n\nBut beginning with the end of World War II, this trend began to sharply reverse. Secularization, smaller families, the automobile and new housing patterns, changing professional expectations, the rising equality of women and the impact of television are all likely causes. The Baby Boomers drove massive social movements, but they didn’t join voluntary membership associations, organizations and churches like their parents and grandparents did. And their kids even less. \n\n> The effects have been profound.\n\nAmerican communities founded on intense associational activity now have a civic participation vacuum. Associations once mobilized their constituents for specific improvements but now only local governments -- often elected by tiny numbers of voters, or self-appointed small business groups -- serve as public custodians. While there have always been good reasons for certain groups of Americans to fear and distrust the government, the lack of faith or even interest in our local institutions is now universal. It’s so endemic we don’t notice it. It’s hard to imagine how it might be different.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we hear reminders concerning the importance of local newspapers and media. Opinion pieces shout about how communities facing political corruption or economic collapse are helpless without journalistic watch-dogs. But this is asking far too much from a newspaper. The problem is vastly deeper. Even when enterprising reporters uncover local scandals or promote essential reforms, it is clear that without well-organized, funded and representative citizen groups, there’s almost no effect. *Financial support for local media without a revolution in civic engagement is probably pointless.*\n\nBut is a revolution in civic engagement, even a small one, possible? We think so. Especially if we start small and focus on issues of relevance to people’s daily lives. And we think smart contracts and token ownership will ultimately play a decisive enabling function, block by block. \n\n**A New DAO: Local ~~News~~ Services**\n\nLet’s imagine something much smaller than a city, smaller than a neighborhood. An activity whose purpose is to bring the community together in a participatory manner in order to drive value, civic engagement and trust: the street fair. \n\nIn this scenario, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is formed for a particular street or business district. All participants in the fair ‘zone’ are awarded tokens by proving that they’re residents of the community (ie. a real address, or some other verification, a certain number per adult, a certain number per kid). Everybody automatically gets more every week. And like many DAOs, residents also earn more tokens for doing listed service actions. \n\nMerchants would rent booths from the DAO on a competitively auctioned basis. Community members would be rewarded in cash or tokens for helping out The Fair, like setting up and taking down booths, picking up trash or providing entertainment. But community members would also receive tokens for DAO management tasks. These tasks are differentiated in that they are focused on influential decisions for community decisioning like screening and voting on proposals (mainly, which services are needed and what the payment is, what merchants are approved, etc.). \n\nAs the street fair (hopefully) becomes nicer and better attended, booth prices will rise -- after all, more visitors, more value to the merchants. Tokens could also be bought from other owners, but voting is proportioned using the [quadratic governance model](https://medium.com/eximchain/quadratic-voting-smart-contracts-powerful-governance-model-b8efa4ddeef1) - where additional tokens only provide decreasingly additional incremental voting power. If the model worked, more neighborhoods could adopt it. When there are enough street fair DAOs, an index fund could be created allowing investors to own a diverse basket of neighborhood fairs and generating more liquidity for token owners. Essentially, street fair DAOs turn streets into a community’s economic asset.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2ad92527-53e6-49ae-a877-7503cd60587e.png?height=366&width=546)\n\n**But why do we need tokens or a DAO to do any of this?**\n\nThese are all things that local non-profits already manage. At least in some places, it’s true that in some ‘healthy’ communities, existing institutions can run and grow successful events. But the management and organizational ‘overhead’ of traditional associations often exceeds the will and ability of potential participants. If you’ve ever been part of a community or school group, you understand the often prohibitive burden. It’s not only the time commitment of planning meetings — it’s the social dynamics where a few very active members dominate and others are ignored and relegated to less important tasks. But by moving to a DAO model, these issues become easier. \n\nOne way to think about on-chain governance is that it combines many of the best aspects of online communities with those of more traditional organizations. Unlike local associations, local message boards, chat rooms and Nextdoor or Facebook Groups allow citizens to share their opinions. People can do this at any time without leaving their homes, and with the comfort of anonymity if they choose. And unlike an in-person meeting, users can be involved in only the specific issue they find motivating, instead of having to sit through an entire meeting on a variety of topics (including the always delightful adoption of the minutes of the previous meeting.)\n\nDespite these advantages, the drawbacks of online communities for local organizing are significant and familiar. The low barrier to entry, the anonymity, the ease of interaction all leads to trolling and flame-wars, often over the smallest of disagreements. The lack of organizational structure leads to talk without action. Even when an online community does sprout real-world activity, the manifestation tends to be disorganized, diffuse and difficult to sustain.\n\nDAOs have strong answers to both sets of problems--\n\n- **traditional, in-person organizations**: smart contracts motivate participation by rewarding broader engagement, utilize online asynchronous interaction modes, and automate much of the drudgery of group decision-making. (You don’t need to approve the minutes for a blockchain-based entity.)\n- **online communities**: DAOs add the structure necessary for determining real-world action and the real money, the practical means of aggregating and allocating it, to fund that action in the real world. (Chat rooms don’t have bank accounts.)\n\nSo let’s now zoom one step out. In addition to something like a street fair, other local entities might also issue tokens, from loyalty programs for small businesses, to support systems for parks and schools, to membership NFTs for performance spaces, to community-run traffic safety projects to anti-corruption campaigns. An active citizen might own tokens in dozens of local efforts, some in which they are a major participant, others in which they are more a casual observer. We can see how owners would work to market their projects to each other. We can imagine an entire ‘stock market’ for a city, asset prices reflecting the growth and success of different communal projects and efforts. We can envision how such liquidity dynamics would dramatically reduce the ‘cost of capital’ for any local ‘social’ entrepreneur and venture.\n\nIn this context, the mission of local news and information takes on an entirely new dimension. Instead of holding it responsible for all civic failures, the local news site becomes a portal to projects. Here could be hosted reviews of their progress, and perhaps even the marketplace where the tokens are promoted, tracked, bought, sold and traded. And of course, that local news site would itself be collectively owned, organized as a DAO and managed via tokens. \n\n*Consider how significant this change would be*. The newspaper emerged in the context of intensely active civic associations and local enterprises. It both reported on those organizations, including their many disputes, and acted as one itself. Small towns and immigrant communities alike supported thriving news concerns. Their pages were filled with advertisements and articles about community events and causes. Every dot on the railroad map had a local paper. At one point in the early 20th Century, New York City had six competing Yidddish dailies. The Statue of Liberty itself was a newspaper fundraising campaign. But as civic engagement declined, and as a response to the media's most dominant business models, the newspaper departed from its natural focus and pushed towards scale. It had to compete with television. More scale meant a broader focus on the content itself (outside of the community) and a larger opportunity to monetize through advertising or subscriptions. But it backfired. \n\nWhy? Because scale is the antonym of local. It’s the opposite. A scaled approach means removing community needs and participation from the forefront of value, which means an emphasis of *reporting on* communities versus *reporting of* those communities. Business models drive product strategy, and while we can’t retroactively return to how the local newspapers used to be structured, we can introduce new models that will drive its evolution into the next phase of value, moving from news broadcaster to civic engagement funnel. \n\nAs a platform that was incentivized to drive healthy ownership and engagement in local efforts, the local news DAO would be constantly innovating new ways to drive awareness of the best projects and caution of the risky ones. As members of the DAO, token holders (community residents) of the news site would be empowered to make influential decisions as to what gets covered, where assets are attributed to and what information would best service the community at large. In this way, the news site and the underlying civic associations become a virtuous circle, interest driving ownership and thus more engagement.\n\n**But are these innovations enough to reverse the decades-long decline of local civic associations?**\n\nYour answer to that question depends on what you believe to be the source of that decline. We look back with amazement at the sheer number of local associational relationships our grandparents and great-grandparents had, their involvement with churches and synagogues, with charities, lodges and clubs, commitments that occupied vast amounts of their time and lasted their whole lives. But this actually understates how differently earlier generations saw their place in the world. For them, especially if they were immigrants, there was no ‘choosing’ to be part of these communities. Their belonging was an unchanging fact of reality as they understood it. They couldn’t opt-out. The only question was how selflessly and successfully they would participate. \n\nFor most Americans today, this worldview is unimaginable. In their 2010 paper, [The Weirdest people in the world?](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.proquest.com/openview/196dc885b5d6d0ac0f53ac71b45caf76/1?pq-origsite%3Dgscholar%26cbl%3D47829&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1622635032822000&usg=AOvVaw3Tbe9TmXyDwlyRBLBjvrBi), Joseph Henrich, Ara Norenzayan and Steven J. Heine described how Western social scientists have routinely under-estimated how unusual modern American psychology is compared to the rest of the world. Using the acronym ‘WEIRD’ (Western, educated, industrial, rich and democratic), they noted how a whole corpus of psychology tests once believed to reveal universal human traits, having used American college students as their test subjects, were actually unique to specific Western populations. Now seen in contrast to tests done with Asians or Africans, it became evident how contemporary Westerners ground their worldviews in the radical notion of the individual. Subsequent experiments revealed how immigrants to the West transition from the ‘traditional’ communal or tribal perspectives to this WEIRD psychology within one or two generations. From these discoveries, it seems clear that our great-grandparents brought their communal orientation with them, from their home countries, and the great flourishing of ‘joining’ that Tocqueville described and that Putnam documents was their adaptation of belonging within the relative freedom of American society. We see the same behavior, that expectation of community commitment, among many new immigrants today.\n\nUnlike them, however, most of us are truly WEIRD. We cannot go back to a time when our families and our neighbors assumed evenings and weekends would be spent on communal efforts. For good or bad, we begin with the primacy of the person. And any cleareyed revival of civic life needs to be based in that reality. DAOs do that. You aren’t presumed to be obligated to engage -- you’re paid to. You aren’t a parishioner or adherent -- you’re an owner. You have an emotional connection to a collective mission -- but it’s framed in explicit economic self-interest. You don’t belong to a DAO — *it belongs to you*. \n\nInspired by the potential of these concepts, crypto-dreamers are [envisioning](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4), in their WEIRD way like the pioneers of earlier centuries, entirely new cities based on smart contracts and tokens. Some talk about designing their new towns ‘in the Metaverse first,’ then raising money to build them in the real world, usually in some state or country hospitable to libertarian ideals. These visions are thrilling and important, but there’s just as much relevance for blockchain in the cities and towns that exist today. It’s possible the often disastrous record of new cities based on utopian ideals recommends we seek to solve the pernicious problems we already have rather than create new ones from scratch. It’s very likely that the totally new and the rebooted city will inform each other, like a testnet and a mainnet. In any case and in any setting, these crypto-local concepts -- and the tools to support them -- will take a long time to perfect. It will take a lot of failures before we begin to make progress, so we should begin right away. Just as the civic associations of our grandparents took centuries to rise and fall, blockchain-based organizing will require generations to evolve into a perfected and stable form. All those ghosts peer at us from the past, waiting for us to get started, remaking our cities.\n", "timestamp": 1622631806, "digest": "eYRttcLec0IXODpzLFsHZTRdzuWosBwfyVKnSc93NdA", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}
{"id": "ZztsXBDPht6D4BGsvYmEzGnCyLxQFAaQ5HjY4ud5qQg", "title": "The difference between Public Goods Problems and  Coordination Problems… and whether it matters. ", "body": "> By [Michael Zargham](https://twitter.com/mZargham), [Scott Moore](https://twitter.com/notscottmoore), and [Matt Stephenson](https://twitter.com/stephensonhmatt) (author order randomized)\n\nPublic Goods Problems and Coordination Problems describe some of the most fundamental and important challenges we face both in Web3 and the wider world. While they are related concepts, **they are theoretically distinct**. Is this a distinction without a difference? In this note we explore why game theorists and even behavioral economists (like one of your co-authors) make such a distinction. We will describe what the difference is and why it might matter.\n\nLet’s begin with a simple example:\n\n*Suppose you’re at a concert and everyone is comfortably sitting down and enjoying the performance. Suddenly people several rows in front of you start standing up to get a better view, which makes everyone behind them need to stand. So now, while you’re still comfortable in your seat, you can’t see anything. So you give up and stand too.*\n\nNow let’s examine the situation: nobody’s view has actually improved by standing instead of sitting--the backs of people’s heads are just as in-the-way as they were before. But now everyone is less comfortable. We have thus moved to a less optimal outcome. And worse still the situation is more sticky,  more “equilibrium-ey”[1] if you will. Initially we all stood because just a single person standing could affect everyone behind them, totally changing things. **But now if someone sits it doesn’t really matter**--we all just have to stand to see over everyone else standing in front us. We would need everyone to sit at the same time.\n\nThis sounds like a coordination problem, right? Not so fast!\n\nIt’s only coordination if “everyone sitting” is a stable equilibrium. **This is the essential difference between Public Goods Problems and Coordination Problems**: in a Coordination Problem the optimal outcome is stable, whereas in a Public Goods Problem the optimal outcome is not. More technically, we can say that coordination games exhibit multiple pareto-ranked equilibria which include the social optimum (Dutta, 2003) whereas public goods games have a non-equilibrium social optimum (Hichri & Kirman 2006).\n\nIf you find that confusing don’t worry-- **there was literally an oscar-winning movie about John Nash that got this wrong**. In A Beautiful Mind, when it came time to describe the Nash Equilibrium (Nash’s defining contribution) the movie instead discussed an unstable non-Nash outcome just like the “sitting down at a concert” example. [You can watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJS7Igvk6ZM).\n\nThe distinction to be made is that, unlike a coordination game, our concert example and Russell Crowe’s bar-room musings in the movie both feature an “incentive to defect” (aka the “free rider problem.”) In the concert example, when everyone else sits down and *you stand you actually do get a better view*.[2] Or using the movie’s dated example, when your friends go for the brunettes and don’t “block” you, you are actually clear to “go for the blonde.” \n\nYou can see in the illustration below that the difference between the two games depends precisely on the relative magnitude of the “defect” payoff. The Public Goods game on the left can be transformed into the coordination game on the right with a single change: reducing the payoff to the defector (circled in red).[3]\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d253f4ab-d379-4a76-bba1-2ad4c4e24176.jpeg?height=696&width=1600)\n\nBut this means that, having defined the concert problem as a Public Goods game, it doesn’t matter if you get your bullhorn out and coordinate everyone back into their seats. Someone will always stand back up. And soon we will all be standing again. **That’s what it means to have a “non-equilibrium social optimum”--you can see it, you just can’t live in it.** \n\nBut that’s just the problem as we’ve defined it. Is that actually the problem?\n\n# What game is it?\n\nLet’s pause and reflect for a second.\n\nWe are not trying to convince you that you can’t make people sit down at concerts. Nor do we care about the semantic differences between “coordination” vs. “public goods” problems. This difference matters, we contend, because the public goods framework is good for stating problems and the coordination framework is good for conceptualizing solutions. \n\n**The likely reason that A Beautiful Mind got the Nash Equilibrium wrong is that Public Goods problems almost always present to us humans as, well... problems.** That is, when we see them we are often drawn to solving them. And here’s where you’re going to start to feel the edges of not just game theory but any sort of human-regarding theory.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/602f8fee-78e3-45cc-a19e-31a69a438529.jpeg?height=566&width=1252)\n\nThe mind balks at Public Goods Problems. “Don’t you see” you want to ask, incredulous, “that if you stand up, soon everyone will stand up and your view will be the same as before but now you’re less comfortable?” That’s what a public goods problem *feels like*. **Let’s live in them for a little bit and feel their power before we move on and discuss how to solve them.**\n\nThe prototypical Public Goods game has been run in a laboratory setting countless times. Run it with more than a few players and “players do not, in general, manage to coordinate on cooperative behaviour” (ibid.) Worse still is that, unlike some two-person games, repeating these games doesn’t help. In fact, cooperation typically gets worse over time as you can see in the figure below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4cc9f230-3cb9-4498-95e3-215cbc6b4a28.jpeg?height=423&width=809)\n\nThe way a laboratory public goods game works is: everyone gets some money, say 10 people get $20.00 each, which they can contribute to the public pool or keep. The experimenters then increase the money everyone contributes by e.g. another 20% which is split among everyone in the game. Crucially, this split happens for everyone, whether they contributed or not.[4] \n\nOn the graph above you can see the average “contribution” on the y-axis, with rounds on the x-axis.[5] And have a look at period 1 up there on the left, where most everyone is hopeful and optimistic and so the average contribution is quite high. Everyone does pretty well. What goes wrong to make everything unravel? \n\nHaving personally run, and participated in, these public goods experiments many times one of your co-authors can explain what’s largely going on here. To get a feel for it, here’s what this game looks like with four players:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f99f0d43-7f25-4de3-b38f-2e97eb4df743.jpeg?height=654&width=722)\n\nLook familiar? It’s that annoying “incentive to defect” again (circled in red). What’s happening is that the free rider is not excluded from receiving the “common pool” split. And since they also get to keep the $20 they didn’t contribute, this means they always make the most money. And then in the next rounds this happens again and again, the gap growing ever wider.\n\nAfter a few rounds your fellow contributors are starting to get a little pissed off. They believe in the common good, sure. **But you can’t just sit back and allow these free riders to make everyone a sucker like this can you?** The unraveling of cooperation that you see in experimental chart is often the “we’re not going to be suckers” feeling spreading through a population. \n\nThat may look a bit depressing, but there’s some good news too. For one thing, even if you repeat this for a very long time, there is typically ~10% of the population who never give up the faith and just continue to contribute no matter what. These are the saints. For another, if you just shuffle the players and start the whole game over you’ll notice something amazing; most everyone regains their optimism. It looks about like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/252e4594-fb8e-487c-b1a9-c9d59f062807.jpeg?height=282&width=1096)\n\n**That is, in each period 1 you get this “restarting” effect as everyone tries to jump start cooperation again.** Hope springs eternal! Of course, because they are playing a true Public Goods game (unfortunately) cooperation devolves again. But this behavior is a crucial building block of a real-world solution. This hope we observe is why we get to try and fail and try again.\n\n# How do we solve these things?\nWe saw that a public goods problem is characterized by an unstable social optimum, vulnerable to individual incentives to defect. But we also saw the experimental evidence that some people never give up, and that in a new game most everyone will try again to reach the social optimum, hoping that maybe this time the unstable outcome will be stable. They are hoping, we might say, that this time the Public Goods game will turn out to be a Coordination game.\n\nWith that in mind, we can propose an ad hoc hierarchy for solving these problems. Speaking roughly, a public goods problem is solved by transforming/reimagining it to be a coordination problem:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/20b25e5f-830c-4c67-acf8-fe8f2f347303.jpeg?height=1236&width=1600)\n\nStarting from the top right you have the best possible solution concept, called a “Prisoner’s Delight.” It means that the socially optimal outcome is the *only* stable equilibrium! This is not even a coordination game--it’s a solved problem. Whereas we saw that Public Goods Problems almost always strike us humans as problems to be solved, **the Prisoner’s Delight “problem” really doesn’t seem like a problem at all**.\n\nAs a result, our example is going to feel a little silly. A good example might be “setting your house on fire”. Most people don’t want to set their house on fire and so “everyone’s house not on fire” is stable with no incentive to defect. This is the social optimum. And what about the situation where everyone else’s house is on fire, does that make you want to set your house on fire too? Of course not!  Which means there’s not even an equilibrium at “everyone sets their house on fire” because now the temptation is to, well, “not set your house on fire”. Absent insurance shenanigans, “don’t set your house on fire” is the strictly dominant strategy and any deviations from it do not destabilize the system.[6] \n\nSo let’s move down the chart to proper coordination problems (with multiple equilibria). In this world, the equilibria are at least stable once people are in them and so we “just” need to get them there. Making people choose the “good” equilibrium in a coordination problem can be described as making it “focal.” \n\n### Here is a (non-exhaustive) hierarchy of coordination games ranked by how “focal” the equilibrium tends to be, ranked from best to worst:\n1. Payoff Dominance. A preferred equilibrium which provides the highest payoff for all players in the game is extremely focal.[7] If you play a game like this in the lab it will feel silly and hardly like a game at all because everyone does the preferred thing.\n2. Risk Dominance. A preferred equilibrium which is risk dominant is more fragile but can be naturally coordinated on. Picking an action that is risk dominant roughly means that if other players don’t do what you expect you’re still relatively better off than you would have been otherwise (mutatis mutandis).\n3. Inertia. If the preferred equilibrium isn’t payoff dominant (as in #1) or risk dominant (as in #2), you can still make use of the fact that people will just stay with what they’ve done in the past. Thus if you can start there or get people there they may well stay.\n\nIf we keep only to monetary utilities, leaving the behavioral mechanism design out of it, these solution concepts are basically: “Everybody gets rich” (1), “Everybody avoids losing money” (2), and “Who cares about getting rich, let’s just do things the old fashioned way” (3). And, speaking somewhat loosely, [you can actually use the commitment aspect of smart contracts to change the game along these dimensions](https://blog.coinfund.io/can-a-good-smart-contract-beat-blockchains-new-12m-ponzi-yes-in-theory-6964eead5b84).[8]\n\nExpanding to the behavioral sphere our options really open up. Now we can grant, say, social status to coordinators. We can signal disapproval to those who, say, stand up in front of us at a concert.  We could even make “doing things the old-fashioned way” have a sort of identity bonus, an additional utility stemming from the embracing of tradition. \n\nWe might be revealing our bias, but real solutions will often live in the behavioral realm at least to some degree. When you think about solving the “concert problem” from earlier you might be inclined to say to the stander, **“Excuse me but would you mind sitting? The rest of us would prefer it.”** And when they then sit and everyone is better off, whatever kindness, reciprocity, or even shame aversion that person felt that made them sit is what drove the coordinating equilibrium.\n\n**Which is all to say that “transforming” a game along these lines is a fundamentally creative act.** And Lin Ostrom’s work reminds us that creative solutions abound, and that communities can solve what look to outsiders like Public Goods problems (thereby demonstrating that they are actually coordination problems.) Ostrom was the essential inspiration for our solution concepts above, reimagining Public Goods games as Coordination games.[9]\n\n### Do Public Goods Problems Actually Exist?\nThe Public Goods framing remains invaluable, at least insofar as it captures what a social problem *feels like* before it is solved. Each of us knows there are situations in which we can all see the social optimum but can’t quite figure out how to get there yet. The sink full of dishes that all the roommates would like to have washed but would rather someone else do it. \n\nAnd we also know there are situations where we think we’ve reached a solution, only to find it’s unstable--we can feel the frustration after we whip all the roommates into a Sunday morning cleaning frenzy to finally get all the dishes washed... only to watch over time as the sink fills back up with the roommates nowhere to be found. **This is the frustration of the would-be coordinator discovering that they’re still playing a Public Goods game.**\n\nOn the other hand we can’t help but feel -- watching people unhappily standing up at a concert, [writing valuable code in a private repository](https://medium.com/gitcoin/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gitcoin-fe2e3e292a21), or [failing to develop scientific ideas](https://s.mirror.xyz/vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg) -- that there must be solutions. And it’s comforting to know that earnest attempts to solve these problems may be met by the hopefulness we saw in the experiments, the inextinguishable belief that maybe this time we can all get to the social optimum and stay there. \n\nIn the end, “what game are we playing” is not really an answerable question. To the pure game theorist, the idea that you can “reimagine” a public goods game as something else is nonsensical--it’s either a public goods problem or it isn’t. In that light, let’s choose to imagine that all Public Goods problems are just Coordination Problems in disguise. And so let’s solve them. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ba9424f4-617c-4347-9e1c-42dafe9c5d28.jpeg?height=1236&width=1600)\n\n**Endnotes**\n[1] Zargham would like his discomfort with this phrasing noted in the record.\n[2] And, to be slightly technical, the utility you get from the better view is greater than the disutility from not sitting.\n[3] This is a solution concept that we will return to later.

This was conducted in part using a novel cryptographic method for open science called \"[Zero-Knowledge Data Analysis](https://researchers.one/articles/21.04.00006).\"\n\nThe two professors of statistics who ran the independent data analysis, Harry Crane and Ryan Martin, have produced an elegant violin plot of the results to be auctioned off. You can see (and bid on!) this auction directly below this paragraph, but you are welcome to [keep reading beyond if you'd like to better understand the SplitStream](https://iqjji6peiwztatemcrpcyet5lnpuphcivt2hmtirjpqqjmbfppha.arweave.net/RBKUeeRFszBMjBReLBJ9W19HnEis9HZNEUvhBLAle84) and, thus, where the proceeds will be going.\n\n[Token #2837](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2837)\n\n# The SplitStream\n\nYou might know the quote “If I have seen further, it is from standing on the shoulders of giants”.

Citations, when they work, map those dependencies backwards through time.\n\nCitations on citations.\n\nGiants all the way down.\n\nIf you send funds through these citations, you get a cascade. A stream of splits. A SplitStream.\n\nThe SplitStream is a system in which portions of an NFT sale may flow to some or all of the works the NFT cites, with those cited works then sending some of their funds further along to the works they cite, and so on.\n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/74a36177-7d70-4742-b15d-1cda5a8725f3.jpeg?height=684&width=592)\n\nIndependent data analysis is a really valuable thing, and it is a cutting edge Open Science best practice. Thus we value Professors Crane and Martin's contributions greatly and have requested that they keep 50% of the NFT sale from the auction above. They have also agreed to test the SplitStream and for the purposes of this incentive test, their analysis “cites” two NFTs:\n\n- The NFT of the Open Science Test of Seth’s Appetite Theory (currently owned by Molecule)\n- The NFT of this Essay Outlining the Protocol (owned by Planck)\n\nPlanck will then split our proceeds further to what we are citing:\n\n-Mirror because we are using their amazing platform and tech.\n-This Artwork is Always on Sale, suggested by Simon De La Rouvier as the proper target for the citation of his shared idea of Harberger taxes for NFT ownership (which is an important aspect of our protocol.)\n\nAnd so the Split you saw in the Block above also Splits to this:\n\n[Planck Root Split](split://0xb288D65d059671B852aF36B61B1545DB282aBCBb?network=mainnet)\n\nAnd we encourage the recipients of these proceeds, if they are at all substantial, to split back to those they would cite. Let's also note that this is a simple test of the mechanism and certainly does not represent the full range of actual citations we would use.\n\nSpecial thanks to Patrick Riviera for his help in implementing this.

{"id": "MjhRxVZt_FG45Rs5BMn0NKrqRtbs_V1ZGPgqWcyFXPA", "title": "The difference between Public Goods Problems and  Coordination Problems… and whether it matters. ", "body": "> By [Michael Zargham](https://twitter.com/mZargham), [Scott Moore](https://twitter.com/notscottmoore), and [Matt Stephenson](https://twitter.com/stephensonhmatt) (author order randomized)\n\nPublic Goods Problems and Coordination Problems describe some of the most fundamental and important challenges we face both in Web3 and the wider world. While they are related concepts, **they are theoretically distinct**. Is this a distinction without a difference? In this note we explore why game theorists and even behavioral economists (like one of your co-authors) make such a distinction. We will describe what the difference is and why it might matter.\n\nLet’s begin with a simple example:\n\n*Suppose you’re at a concert and everyone is comfortably sitting down and enjoying the performance. Suddenly people several rows in front of you start standing up to get a better view, which makes everyone behind them need to stand. Now, while you’re still comfortable in your seat, you can’t see anything. So you give up and stand too.*\n\nNow let’s analyze the situation: nobody’s view has actually improved by standing instead of sitting--the backs of people’s heads are just as in-the-way as they were before. But now everyone is less comfortable. We have thus moved to a less optimal outcome. And worse still the situation is more sticky,  more “equilibrium-ey”[1] if you will. Initially we all stood because just a single person standing could affect everyone behind them, totally changing things. **But now if someone sits it doesn’t really matter**--we all just have to stand to see over everyone else standing in front us. To solve the problem, perhaps we could get everyone to sit at the same time.\n\nThis sounds like a coordination problem, right? Not so fast!\n\nIt’s only coordination if “everyone sitting” is a stable equilibrium. And so as we've defined it, getting everyone to sit again isn't actually a solution. **This is the essential difference between Public Goods Problems and Coordination Problems: in a Coordination Problem the optimal outcome is stable, whereas in a Public Goods Problem the optimal outcome is not.** More technically, we can say that coordination games exhibit multiple pareto-ranked equilibria which include the social optimum (Dutta, 2003) whereas public goods games have a non-equilibrium social optimum (Hichri & Kirman 2006).\n\nIf you find that confusing don’t worry-- **there was literally an oscar-winning movie about John Nash that got this wrong**. In A Beautiful Mind, when it came time to describe the Nash Equilibrium (Nash’s defining contribution) the movie instead discussed an unstable non-Nash outcome just like the “sitting down at a concert” example. [You can watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJS7Igvk6ZM).\n\nThe distinction to be made is that, unlike a coordination game, our concert example and Russell Crowe’s bar-room musings in the movie both feature an “incentive to defect” (aka the “free rider problem.”) In the concert example, when everyone else sits down and *you stand you actually do get a better view*.[2] Or using the movie’s dated example, when your friends go for the brunettes and don’t “block” you, you are actually clear to “go for the blonde.” \n\nYou can see in the illustration below that the difference between the two games depends precisely on the relative magnitude of the “defect” payoff. The Public Goods game on the left can be transformed into the coordination game on the right with a single change: reducing the payoff to the defector (circled in red).[3]\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d253f4ab-d379-4a76-bba1-2ad4c4e24176.jpeg?height=696&width=1600)\n\nBut this means that, having defined the concert problem as a Public Goods game, it doesn’t matter if you get your bullhorn out and coordinate everyone back into their seats. Someone will always stand back up. And soon we will all be standing again. **That’s what it means to have a “non-equilibrium social optimum”--you can see it, you just can’t live in it.** \n\nBut that’s just the problem as we’ve defined it. Is that actually the problem?\n\n# What game is it?\n\nLet’s pause and reflect for a second.\n\nWe are not trying to convince you that you can’t make people sit down at concerts. Nor do we care about the semantic differences between “coordination” vs. “public goods” problems. This difference matters, we contend, because the public goods framework is good for stating problems and the coordination framework is good for conceptualizing solutions. \n\n**The likely reason that A Beautiful Mind got the Nash Equilibrium wrong is that Public Goods problems almost always present to us humans as, well... problems.** That is, when we see them we are often drawn to solving them. And here’s where you’re going to start to feel the edges of not just game theory but any sort of human-regarding theory.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/602f8fee-78e3-45cc-a19e-31a69a438529.jpeg?height=566&width=1252)\n\nThe mind balks at Public Goods Problems. “Don’t you see” you want to ask, incredulous, “that if you stand up, soon everyone will stand up and your view will be the same as before but now you’re less comfortable?” That’s what a public goods problem *feels like*. **Let’s live in them for a little bit and feel their power before we move on and discuss how to solve them.**\n\nThe prototypical Public Goods game has been run in a laboratory setting countless times. Run it with more than a few players and “players do not, in general, manage to coordinate on cooperative behaviour” (ibid.) Worse still is that, unlike some two-person games, repeating these games doesn’t help. In fact, cooperation typically gets worse over time as you can see in the figure below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4cc9f230-3cb9-4498-95e3-215cbc6b4a28.jpeg?height=423&width=809)\n\nThe way a laboratory public goods game works is: everyone gets some money, say 10 people get $20.00 each, which they can contribute to the public pool or keep. The experimenters then increase the money everyone contributes by e.g. another 20% which is split among everyone in the game. Crucially, this split happens for everyone, whether they contributed or not.[4] \n\nOn the graph above you can see the average “contribution” on the y-axis, with rounds on the x-axis.[5] And have a look at period 1 up there on the left, where most everyone is hopeful and optimistic and so the average contribution is quite high. Everyone does pretty well. What goes wrong to make everything unravel? \n\nHaving personally run, and participated in, these public goods experiments many times one of your co-authors can explain what’s largely going on here. To get a feel for it, here’s what this game looks like with four players:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f99f0d43-7f25-4de3-b38f-2e97eb4df743.jpeg?height=654&width=722)\n\nLook familiar? It’s that annoying “incentive to defect” again (circled in red). What’s happening is that the free rider is not excluded from receiving the “common pool” split. And since they also get to keep the $20 they didn’t contribute, this means they always make the most money. And then in the next rounds this happens again and again, the gap growing ever wider.\n\nAfter a few rounds your fellow contributors are starting to get a little pissed off. They believe in the common good, sure. **But you can’t just sit back and allow these free riders to make everyone a sucker like this can you?** The unraveling of cooperation that you see in experimental chart is often the “we’re not going to be suckers” feeling spreading through a population. \n\nThat may look a bit depressing, but there’s some good news too. For one thing, even if you repeat this for a very long time, there is typically ~10% of the population who never give up the faith and just continue to contribute no matter what. These are the saints. For another, if you just shuffle the players and start the whole game over you’ll notice something amazing; most everyone regains their optimism. It looks about like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/252e4594-fb8e-487c-b1a9-c9d59f062807.jpeg?height=282&width=1096)\n\n**That is, in each period 1 you get this “restarting” effect as everyone tries to jump start cooperation again.** Hope springs eternal! Of course, because they are playing a true Public Goods game (unfortunately) cooperation devolves again. But this behavior is a crucial building block of a real-world solution. This hope we observe is why we get to try and fail and try again.\n\n# How do we solve these things?\nWe saw that a public goods problem is characterized by an unstable social optimum, vulnerable to individual incentives to defect. But we also saw the experimental evidence that some people never give up, and that in a new game most everyone will try again to reach the social optimum, hoping that maybe this time the unstable outcome will be stable. They are hoping, we might say, that this time the Public Goods game will turn out to be a Coordination game.\n\nWith that in mind, we can propose an ad hoc hierarchy for solving these problems. Speaking roughly, a public goods problem is solved by transforming/reimagining it to be a coordination problem:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/20b25e5f-830c-4c67-acf8-fe8f2f347303.jpeg?height=1236&width=1600)\n\nStarting from the top right you have the best possible solution concept, called a “Prisoner’s Delight.” It means that the socially optimal outcome is the *only* stable equilibrium! This is not even a coordination game--it’s a solved problem. Whereas we saw that Public Goods Problems almost always strike us humans as problems to be solved, **the Prisoner’s Delight “problem” really doesn’t seem like a problem at all**.\n\nAs a result, our example is going to feel a little silly. A good example might be “setting your house on fire”. Most people don’t want to set their house on fire and so “everyone’s house not on fire” is stable with no incentive to defect. This is the social optimum. And what about the situation where everyone else’s house is on fire, does that make you want to set your house on fire too? Of course not!  Which means there’s not even an equilibrium at “everyone sets their house on fire” because now the temptation is to, well, “not set your house on fire”. Absent insurance shenanigans, “don’t set your house on fire” is the strictly dominant strategy and any deviations from it do not destabilize the system.[6] \n\nSo let’s move down the chart to proper coordination problems (with multiple equilibria). In this world, the equilibria are at least stable once people are in them and so we “just” need to get them there. Making people choose the “good” equilibrium in a coordination problem can be described as making it “focal.” \n\n### Here is a (non-exhaustive) hierarchy of coordination games ranked by how “focal” the equilibrium tends to be, ranked from best to worst:\n1. Payoff Dominance. A preferred equilibrium which provides the highest payoff for all players in the game is extremely focal.[7] If you play a game like this in the lab it will feel silly and hardly like a game at all because everyone does the preferred thing.\n2. Risk Dominance. A preferred equilibrium which is risk dominant is more fragile but can be naturally coordinated on. Picking an action that is risk dominant roughly means that if other players don’t do what you expect you’re still relatively better off than you would have been otherwise (mutatis mutandis).\n3. Inertia. If the preferred equilibrium isn’t payoff dominant (as in #1) or risk dominant (as in #2), you can still make use of the fact that people will just stay with what they’ve done in the past. Thus if you can start there or get people there they may well stay.\n\nIf we keep only to monetary utilities, leaving the behavioral mechanism design out of it, these solution concepts are basically: “Everybody gets rich” (1), “Everybody avoids losing money” (2), and “Who cares about getting rich, let’s just do things the old fashioned way” (3). And, speaking somewhat loosely, [you can actually use the commitment aspect of smart contracts to change the game along these dimensions](https://blog.coinfund.io/can-a-good-smart-contract-beat-blockchains-new-12m-ponzi-yes-in-theory-6964eead5b84).[8]\n\nExpanding to the behavioral sphere our options really open up. Now we can grant, say, social status to coordinators. We can signal disapproval to those who, say, stand up in front of us at a concert.  We could even make “doing things the old-fashioned way” have a sort of identity bonus, an additional utility stemming from the embracing of tradition. \n\nWe might be revealing our bias, but real solutions will often live in the behavioral realm at least to some degree. When you think about solving the “concert problem” from earlier you might be inclined to say to the stander, **“Excuse me but would you mind sitting? The rest of us would prefer it.”** And when they then sit and everyone is better off, whatever kindness, reciprocity, or even shame aversion that person felt that made them sit is what drove the coordinating equilibrium.\n\n**Which is all to say that “transforming” a game along these lines is a fundamentally creative act.** And Lin Ostrom’s work reminds us that creative solutions abound, and that communities can solve what look to outsiders like Public Goods problems (thereby demonstrating that they are actually coordination problems.) Ostrom was the essential inspiration for our solution concepts above, reimagining Public Goods games as Coordination games.[9]\n\n### Do Public Goods Problems Actually Exist?\nThe Public Goods framing remains invaluable, at least insofar as it captures what a social problem *feels like* before it is solved. Each of us knows there are situations in which we can all see the social optimum but can’t quite figure out how to get there yet. The sink full of dishes that all the roommates would like to have washed but would rather someone else do it. \n\nAnd we also know there are situations where we think we’ve reached a solution, only to find it’s unstable--we can feel the frustration after we whip all the roommates into a Sunday morning cleaning frenzy to finally get all the dishes washed... only to watch over time as the sink fills back up with the roommates nowhere to be found. **This is the frustration of the would-be coordinator discovering that they’re still playing a Public Goods game.**\n\nOn the other hand we can’t help but feel -- watching people unhappily standing up at a concert, [writing valuable code in a private repository](https://medium.com/gitcoin/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gitcoin-fe2e3e292a21), or [failing to develop scientific ideas](https://s.mirror.xyz/vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg) -- that there must be solutions. And it’s comforting to know that earnest attempts to solve these problems may be met by the hopefulness we saw in the experiments, the inextinguishable belief that maybe this time we can all get to the social optimum and stay there. \n\nIn the end, “what game are we playing” is not really an answerable question. To the pure game theorist, the idea that you can “reimagine” a public goods game as something else is nonsensical--it’s either a public goods problem or it isn’t. In that light, let’s choose to imagine that all Public Goods problems are just Coordination Problems in disguise. And so let’s solve them. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ba9424f4-617c-4347-9e1c-42dafe9c5d28.jpeg?height=1236&width=1600)\n\n**Endnotes**\n[1] Zargham would like his discomfort with this phrasing noted in the record.\n[2] And, to be slightly technical, the utility you get from the better view is greater than the disutility from not sitting.\n[3] This is a solution concept that we will return to later. And note that you could also, say, transform the game by raising the cooperative payoff above (15, 15).\n[4] This feature, called non-excludability, is fundamental to what a public good is.\n[5] The different colored lines represent outcomes across different national populations (almost always students). We’d suggest not reading too much into those differences unless it’s to rib our Aussie friends.\n[6] Problems like “who pays for the fire department” bring us back into public goods land of course, but that’s not what we’re talking about here.\n[7] Assuming this payoff is not risk dominated, in which case see #2.\n[8] This article was an elaboration on [this piece](https://medium.com/hackernoon/fomo3d-and-dangerous-game-theory-97bd5f47ab3b) and emerged from discussions with Cathy Barrera and the ethresear.ch community, later [expressed](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8) beautifully by Virgil Griffith.\n[9] And there is thoughtful and interesting work being done on [“Ostrom Compliant” organizations](https://medium.com/commonsstack/automating-ostrom-for-effective-dao-management-cfe7a7aea138).\n", "timestamp": 1622658221, "digest": "djByMntM2rQF4tqUISYS2MAO3oCfSWoOZSOpZjsYwaw", "contributor": "0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6", "nft": "{\"nftTransactionHash\": \"0xf13808b043e42ff6befac680399b29034d77b6bfc8fb5a23e1cd3dfdc74acb86\"}"}
