Each NFT is called a *Noun*, and one Noun is minted every day, indefinitely.\n\nAll Nouns are auctioned, and sales revenue goes into a treasury. NounsDAO has adapted governance protocols from DeFi to allow owners of Nouns to create and vote on proposals over treasury funds and protocol upgrades.\n\nAt time of writing, there is 2,074.0122 ETH (\\~$6.88m) in the treasury, and the project has been running for 15 days. The first treasury proposal has been to donate a total of 30 ETH (\\~$100k) to various charities.\n\nThere are four mechanisms worth highlighting in the NounsDAO protocol, each of which contains some innovation: **auctioning**, **trait generation**, **rendering**, and **governance**.\n\n![Examples of three nouns, rendered in SVG - each Noun has a unique background, body, head, and accessory.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/12e8e7a4-18f0-4503-902b-e6fa1cf0efbc.png?height=506&width=1012)\n\n## **Auctioning a Noun**\n\nThe lifecycle of a Noun begins with the creation of an auction on NounDAO's auction house; the auction house mints the Noun. The NounDAO auction house is a simplified version of Zora/Mirror's auction house that only accepts bids in ETH.\n\nOnly one auction is run at a time, and each auction runs for a minimum of one day. Whenever an auction is closed, a new one is immediately created. This means that there is always exactly one Noun on sale via auction at any time.\n\nEach auction has a reserve price, but it is currently set to a negligible 1 wei. New bids must increment the current bid by at least 2%, otherwise they revert. Nouns are typically being sold for between 100 and 150 ETH.\n\nIf a bid is made within the last 5 minutes, the auction is extended by 5 minutes, and when the auction is over, the noun is transferred from the auction contract to the highest bidder.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8d4696e-9d73-47a8-9b71-634468cffbbd.png?height=1102&width=2120)\n\n## Noun **Generation**\n\nWhen a Noun is created, it is given an integer ID that can be used by anyone to view its traits.\n\nA Noun is composed of 5 traits: *background*, *body*, *accessory*, *head*, *glasses.*\n\nWhen a Noun is created, the protocol generates a random integer to represent each of these traits, distinguishing it from other Nouns. The theoretical maximum value of each trait is 2^48 - 1, but in practice it is limited by the number of images that have been uploaded to the protocol for that trait.\n\nTraits are publicly viewable for each Noun, and are stored on the core contract: `NounsToken`, which also holds user balances. The actual image rendering of these traits is decoupled, encoded on a contract called the `descriptor`, which can be swapped out through a governance proposal (unless governance has chosen to make this locked).\n\n![The traits for each Noun is publicly viewable on the core NounsToken contract.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9e74e17-f1ad-4b9e-9954-3318edf64bf0.png?height=710&width=1120)\n\n## Rendering a Noun\n\nThe integer used for each of the Noun's traits is a reference to an image stored in a contract called `NounsDescriptor`. Images are stored as string of bytes in a lossless data compression format called RLE, and are ultimately renderable by the contract as SVG.\n\nWhen the UI calls the tokenURI method, the contract returns the SVG derived from these compressed RLE images. This is innovative and worth considering for any new blockchain art project.\n\n![The tokenURI method returns all data required to render a high-fidelity image, without needing to reference anything off-chain.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/758876c3-612d-4a4b-b8fc-79d65b3fc189.png?height=702&width=1104)\n\nBecause Noun rendering is decoupled from the core Noun contract itself, this functionality can be improved and swapped if a new compression or rendering technique is proposed.\n\n## **Governance**\n\nNounsDAO is community-governed through a modification of Compound's Governor Bravo contract. It is modified to use ERC721 balances instead of ERC20 balances for voting, but also contains some other subtle differences.\n\nThe first governance proposal has been to \"Donate 5 ETH each to 6 Charities\", which looks like it will pass with unanimous consent.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3f5cb7c1-91fc-42d4-bb3c-55ca0fd7dc52.png?height=876&width=1440)\n\nThere are two other subtle differences that NounsDAO made to Governor Bravo:\n\n* During token transfer, delegation is moved via a hook, rather than in the transfer method itself.\n* The function that returns an account’s delegates will return the account itself if that account hasn't delegated. This is probably an improvement.\n\n## Technical Evaluation\n\nThe NounDAO code is cleanly written, using well-known open-source libraries and modern Solidity. Methods are expressed simply, but also contain a few well-executed innovations.\n\nUpgradability is achieved through decoupling functionality into separate contracts and making the pointers to those contracts governable, rather than through proxy-delegation methods often used. This keeps things simple while still allowing peripheral parts of the architecture - like Noun rendering - to be updated.\n\nThe rendering method itself is very innovative and worth understanding. NounsDAO has figured out a way to render somewhat sophisticated images entirely on-chain via SVGs, which improves on most other NFT projects including CryptoPunks.\n\nI've read every line of code in this project, and did not found any bugs. This doesn't mean there aren't any, and it might still be worthwhile to have a formal audit. Overall, I was impressed by the smart contracts created by this DAO, and by the innovation of the product as a whole.", "timestamp": 1629770998, "digest": "BqF6OA0uX2msUo4tp_iy9ZH1Dwz-_BWPOEJEoX46Yhg", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

New bids must increment the current bid by at least 2%, otherwise they revert. Nouns are typically being sold for between 100 and 150 ETH.\n\nIf a bid is made within the last 5 minutes, the auction is extended by 5 minutes, and when the auction is over, the noun is transferred from the auction contract to the highest bidder.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8d4696e-9d73-47a8-9b71-634468cffbbd.png?height=1102&width=2120)\n\n## Noun **Generation**\n\nWhen a Noun is created, it is given an integer ID that can be used by anyone to view its traits.\n\nA Noun is composed of 5 traits: *background*, *body*, *accessory*, *head*, *glasses.*\n\nWhen a Noun is created, the protocol generates a random integer to represent each of these traits, distinguishing it from other Nouns. The theoretical maximum value of each trait is 2^48 - 1, but in practice it is limited by the number of images that have been uploaded to the protocol for that trait.\n\nTraits are publicly viewable for each Noun, and are stored on the core contract: `NounsToken`, which also holds user balances. The actual image rendering of these traits is decoupled, encoded on a contract called the `descriptor`, which can be swapped out through a governance proposal (unless governance has chosen to make this locked).\n\n![The traits for each Noun is publicly viewable on the core NounsToken contract.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9e74e17-f1ad-4b9e-9954-3318edf64bf0.png?height=710&width=1120)\n\n## Rendering a Noun\n\nThe integer used for each of the Noun's traits is a reference to an image stored in a contract called `NounsDescriptor`. Images are stored as string of bytes in a lossless data compression format called RLE, and are ultimately renderable by the contract as SVG.\n\nWhen the UI calls the tokenURI method, the contract returns the SVG derived from these compressed RLE images.

It is modified to use ERC721 balances instead of ERC20 balances for voting, but also contains some other subtle differences.\n\nThe first governance proposal has been to \"Donate 5 ETH each to 6 Charities\", which looks like it will pass with unanimous consent.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3f5cb7c1-91fc-42d4-bb3c-55ca0fd7dc52.png?height=876&width=1440)\n\nThere are two other subtle differences that NounsDAO made to Governor Bravo:\n\n* During token transfer, delegation is moved via a hook, rather than in the transfer method itself.\n* The function that returns an account’s delegates will return the account itself if that account hasn't delegated. This is probably an improvement.\n\n## Technical Evaluation\n\nThe NounDAO code is cleanly written, using well-known open-source libraries and modern Solidity. Methods are expressed simply, but also contain a few well-executed innovations.\n\nUpgradability is achieved through decoupling functionality into separate contracts and making the pointers to those contracts governable, rather than through proxy-delegation methods often used.

{"id": "jLLM4TIAVr2OxBsDRpTaDX_uG3VD1Ukg6XYgmxSgo9k", "title": "Why your crypto startup looks like a scam", "body": "The Web 3 is still rough around the edges, but the growth of value has been immense. Fertile ground for [scams](https://cointelegraph.com/news/did-you-fall-for-it-13-ico-scams-that-fooled-thousands). This piece aims to achieve two things:\n\n1. How to avoid potential scams, and;\n2. How to avoid your company looking like a scam.\n\nThis is based on years of watching the crypto space, from ICO pump & dumps to the NFTs & DAOs of today, so I’m not talking about any company in particular. However, should you have the feeling what I say applies to your own, then following the advice laid out here can improve your public perception.\n\n# No way to check transactions ‘on-chain’\n\nNFTs took off in a way other digital goods didn’t, because they’re verifiable and you can actually own them in your own wallet. When a platform, for example an NFT marketplace, doesn’t make it possible to track this info (for example via [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)), you lose all the major benefits of NFTs. There’s no transparency and there’s no guarantee that the NFT will live beyond the lifespan of the platform in case of bankruptcy or an actual scam. This is really important, because projects will fail. Nearly half of all 2017 ICOs had [failed by mid-2018](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nearly-half-of-all-2017-icos-have-failed-2018-02-26).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1815e6e2-efb0-496a-8ec7-5fb85a7352ff.png?height=685&width=542)\n\n# No roadmap, whitepaper, explanation\n\nTransparency is key. It’s early days. Things are clunky, they might break, and there are scammers around. The crypto space addresses this with loads of transparency through whitepapers and wikis that explain exactly how things work, what they plan to do in the future, and even the smart contracts that power it all. I personally wouldn’t spend money anywhere where this is missing. It’s such a basic thing.\n\nAs an example, here’s the [Audius whitepaper](https://whitepaper.audius.co/AudiusWhitepaper.pdf) (PDF).\n\n# No clear skin in the game\n\nThe crypto space is young, but it’s easy to build a network. When that network is missing, it suggests being new to the space, not understanding it well, or perhaps not having the intention to. What can compensate for it is a network in another domain, like music, sports or art, so that their reputation can be checked.\n\n# No team page on the website\n\nThis is not a must, but when all else is missing I want to know who are staking their reputation. I want to find these people on Twitter, Discord, LinkedIn and see who they’re connected to. Basically: who’s handling the money I spend?\n\n# Fake social media followers\n\nIt’s not that hard to figure out when post likes & follower counts just don’t add up. There are also tools to figure out what % of an account’s followers are bots. To me this often feels like someone trying to buy legitimacy instead of earn it. Scammers tend to move fast, because they need to pull the rug before people bail out.\n\n# Err on the side of caution\n\nThere are plenty of platforms that do things well. Don’t let FOMO get the better of you. Steer clear of platforms that tick the above boxes and give them time to sort things out. Help your friends do the same. It’s estimated that [80% of 2017’s ICOs were scams](https://www.investopedia.com/news/80-icos-are-scams-report/) with [$9 million](https://www.investopedia.com/news/beware-9m-are-lost-each-day-crypto-scams/) being lost to them daily (2019). Lots of people trying out the promises of Web 3 got burned immediately and the whole space became known for it.\n\nLet’s not let that happen again.\n\n* \n\n***MUSIC x is a regular [newsletter](http://musicx.email/) about innovation in music, subscribed to by thousands of people in music, entertainment & tech.***\n\n*Follow us on Twitter [@musicxnetwork](https://twitter.com/musicxnetwork). \\n Support us on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/musicx).*\n\n*Select previous writing:*\n\n* *[Blockchain basics: how to start a DAO](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/06/22/blockchain-basics-how-to-start-a-dao/)*\n* *[The Decentralized Autonomous “1,000 True Fan” Organisation](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/06/01/the-decentralized-autonomous-1000-true-fan-organisation/)*\n* *[The community-owned rave: event organisers as DAOs](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/06/08/the-community-owned-rave-event-organisers-as-daos/)*", "timestamp": 1629787854, "digest": "ao0f1WfwyVe3H1K0q6DPZTmhx_4AGrNFNopgqyBWHWE", "contributor": "0xe612d9C2a9bA0Ff4403F4f7Ea87D5bE4290aC7B9"}

By collecting NFTs from multiple blockchains, OpenSea acts as a one-stop shop where most collectors go to discover and purchase NFTs.\n\n## How to Mint an NFT on OpenSea\n\n### Step 1: Connect your wallet\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/49540ca8-4f4a-4f86-8577-cc9f7a24819d.png?height=1046&width=878)\n\n* Click on the wallet icon at the top right and connect your wallet. (If you’re using a Rainbow Wallet, you can connect it using the WalletConnect option)\n\n### Step 2: Create a Collection\n\nA Collection is like a folder that allows you to group NFTs that are part of the same series. Each collection has a unique link that displays only the NFTs that are part of that collection. If you are minting a lot of NFTs for different reasons, creating a collection is a good way to organize them and also makes it easy for collectors to access. For example, here is the Rabbithole Quest NFT collection on OpenSea\n\n<https://opensea.io/collection/rabbitholegg>\n\n* To create a collection, go to <https://opensea.io/collections> and click on “Create a Collection”.\n* You’ll need to create a few assets in order to create your collection\n  * Logo Image.

This will protect users that have SafeSearch enabled while browsing OpenSea\n\n### Step 3: Create a new item\n\n* Go to <https://opensea.io/asset/create>. This page allows you to add information about your NFT and mint it.\n* Upload the file you’d like to NFT.\n  * OpenSea supports a range of file types like JPG, PNG, GIF, MP4, WEBM, MP3, and more.\n  * The maximum file size supported is 40 MB.\n* Add the name of the item, an external link, and a description.\n  * Markdown is supported in the description.\n* Select the Collection that you’d like to add the NFT to.\n* If you’re creating an NFT series with multiple NFTs that have different traits, you can use the Properties, Levels, and Stats options to include them.

Minting on Polygon allows you to mint multiple copies.\n* Click on Create.\n\nYour NFT is now live! You can now choose to list it for sale. Listing it is free.

{"id": "cuHAYhXbMlpvgMbcU1Om3H8jRHqQrrj4o3LRW2ew6as", "title": "Office Utilization", "body": "I saw a statistic from one of our larger portfolio companies yesterday. They have had their offices around the world open for some time now with office usage optional. They are seeing office utilization rates of around “20-30%.” They are also seeing “flexibility” as the number one issue in recruiting new talent.\n\nThat was interesting to me because we are seeing a much higher office utilization at USV. We kept our offices open for much of the last 18 months and encouraged a return to the office once we were all vaccinated in early April. On most days, we see about half of our team coming into the office. I think that number was higher in the spring and will be higher in the fall. We also see friends in the VC business and startup world working at our office from time to time and that has been fantastic.\n\nWe have also seen that office utilization is much higher for our team members that live in NYC vs the suburbs, which is not surprising. This chart says it all:\n\n![](https://avc.com/content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-24-at-6.42.03-AM-2048x1279.png)\n\nWe surveyed our portfolio companies last month on the topic of their work environment plans. We got 56 responses which is a tad under 50% of our active portfolio so this data could be off a bit. But it is interesting. Pre-pandemic, 75% of these respondents were fully “in office” with most of the rest using some sort of hybrid model. Very few were fully remote. Now the distribution looks like this:\n\n![](https://avc.com/content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-24-at-6.46.15-AM.png)\n\nThat is a dramatic change from the pre-pandemic norm. I am sure that there will be some movement back to the office when we get to a new normal, whatever and whenever that is, but no matter what, tech companies have moved away from the “fully in-person” model and that will mean very different office utilization models.\n\nWe also asked our portfolio companies about “seat to employee” ratios and got these responses:\n\n![](https://avc.com/content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-24-at-6.52.32-AM.png)\n\nFor those companies that will continue to have an office, it looks like the average seat to employee ratio nets out around 65%. And that is for the 75% of the respondents that plan to have some sort of office.\n\nAt USV, we are taking a contrarian approach to the office. We plan to build a new office that can seat 100% of our employees and we want to be able to host board meetings and other events frequently. We are also looking at other ways to invite the broader “community” to work and be at USV regularly.\n\nBut that does not mean we will expect our employees to be at the office every day. We understand that those with long commutes and children or parents at home need more flexibility and we have seen that providing that flexibility builds loyalty and commitment. So we will continue to support that way of working.\n\nStartups and high-growth companies seem to have embraced fully or partially remote models for the most part in an attempt to attract and retain talent and leverage the increased productivity that comes from eliminating long and painful commute times.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean an office isn’t a good thing from time to time. It may be that organizations that support startups and high-growth companies, like USV, can step into the mix and be part of that answer. That is an interesting idea to me and one that USV is looking at right now.\n", "timestamp": 1629803679, "digest": "FTcgftRw3hqq4he8vTE1QaWewDByt9clrZ2cSzV2f4Y", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

The best internet games are the ones that are hidden in plain sight.\n\nFraming the internet as a collection of games, or even as a giant infinite game in itself, isn't a new idea. Numerous people have [discussed](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game) the implications of internet games and how winning strategies can produce outstanding real-life rewards. Social media stands out as perhaps the most analyzed sector of internet game theory. These games are well understood and exhibit a mature set of players, strategies, modes, and outcomes.\n\nMany of our behaviors around media and, more broadly, information platforms, however, are constrained by one game mode. The hyper-centralization of media has effectively created a single-player experience defined by two problematic features:\n\n1. Monopolistic platforms wield unilateral control over determining the information that we see\n2. While users are responsible for creating and curating information on these networks, they share none of the value generated from their work\n\nThus, single-player information networks suffer from incentive misalignment between the platform and its users. The platform is motivated to aggressively grow a single \"[global water cooler](https://youtu.be/oLsb7clrXMQ?t=953)\" network in order to maximize the amount of attention generated. However, users share none of the upside in the network's growth.

When there’s infinite upside and zero downside to creating, networks become saturated as noise overtakes signal. Structurally, it's impossible for users to coordinate and produce legitimately valuable information which benefits both individuals and the network simultaneously.\n\nAs Vitalik [argues](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), legitimacy is the most important scarce resource.

What is cryptomedia? As [Jacob Horne](https://twitter.com/js_horne) [explains](https://cryptomedia.wtf/), *cryptomedia can be thought of as hypermedia with built-in property rights*. ERC-721 NFTs are the canonical manifestation of cryptomedia. Each NFT consists of a media component (traditionally, a single URI), and an ownership component by which a single owner holds provenance over the token.\n\nTraditional NFTs conforming to this standard provide an extremely valuable system for facilitating artistry, patronage, and exchange around singular goods. However, they aren’t designed for solving legitimacy constraints around creating and curating valuable information.\n\nVerse introduces a new standard for **multiplayer cryptomedia specifically designed for high-signal information discovery and communication**. Through Verse, anyone can create a cryptomedia contract. Each contract consists of:\n\n1. A collection of media URIs\n2. A tokenized market following a continuous [bonding curve](https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/)\n\nToken-holders are given the ability to add a piece of media to the contract’s collection. The price of each token is programmatically correlated with demand, so token-holders are incentivized to add media which increases the value of the collection and attracts new buyers who want to participate.\n\nVerse thus differentiates from traditional cryptomedia in two important ways:\n\n1. Instead of a single piece of media, each Verse cryptomedia object holds a collection with multiple pieces of media\n2. Instead of a single owner, each Verse cryptomedia object enables tokenized, fractional ownership with an unlimited number of participants\n\n**Why are these innovations important?**\n\nCrypto mechanisms, particularly tokenization and automated market makers, have enabled coordination games that could never practically exist before. What is a coordination game? I'm going to once again [borrow](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) one of Vitalik's definitions here, because it's extremely straightforward. In a coordination game, *if you act in a certain way alone, you are likely to get nowhere (or worse), but if everyone acts together a desired result can be achieved*.\n\n![Image credit: Vitalik Buterin, \"The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f6cf4fbc-f71b-435c-ac97-d30ac194708d.png?height=618&width=1510)\n\nLegitimacy is a natural byproduct of a coordination game. In any coordination game, if a mechanism incentivizes participants to cooperate and act together to achieve a goal instead of acting alone, that mechanism has legitimacy. **Verse is designed for individuals to coordinate around creating and curating the most valuable information around any arbitrary topic**. If token holders can coordinate to build a valuable, popular collection of media, the value of their tokens should increase as more people demand the token and want their own pieces of media included in the collection. In contrast, it's expensive for any one individual to add or curate irrelevant information in a market, because doing so decreases the token's value. Currently, web2 platforms produce more noise than signal as their networks grow, and it becomes extremely difficult for consumers to find the highest-quality information in an increasingly cluttered feed. Verse incentivizes perpetual creation and curation of the best information on any topic, enabling efficient and credible discovery.\n\nAs an example, consider the topic of DAOs. As it's such a nascent and trending topic, I want to find the best resources for learning about DAOs and how they operate. Where do I go? General web searches just throw me in an SEO'd hellscape. Trying to sift through social media to find the best thought leaders and posts they've written or recommended is too much work.\n\nWith a #DAOs cryptomedia object, participants are incentivized to produce a collection of high-quality posts on DAOs. I can trust the legitimacy of the information because I know that the market participants are financially motivated to build the most relevant collection possible. In this way, Verse cryptomedia creates a positive-sum ecosystem for generating the highest-quality information on any subject.\n\nSo what is the long-term goal for Verse? At its core, I think of Verse as a search protocol - one that produces information based on legitimized signals from incentivized participants. Information signaling is one of the most important building blocks we use for decision making. As Fred Ehrsam [points out](https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388803655184386?s=20), a lot of life comes down to effective information processing: picking the best option among a bevy of alternatives. **In an age of information saturation, on-chain signaling, uniquely enabled by crypto mechanisms, is the new search**. Rather than centralized algorithms indexing the entirety of the open web to produce results, signals stored on-chain enable anyone to create an algorithm that surfaces results among specific cryptomedia objects. Searchers will pick the algorithm that comes up with the best results in their market(s) of interest.\n\nAlgorithms in the web2 era - such as recommender systems - are highly centralized, opaque and monolithic. In contrast, the Verse protocol enables a free-market for more meritocratic, transparent, and multiplayer algorithms that can be built and implemented by anyone to consume the data in Verse’s cryptomedia contracts. Search becomes not only multiplayer and curated, but also personally-signaled to the searcher. Thus, Verse enables a new permissionless, truly **multiplayer** standard for information legitimacy.\n\nMaking information games more multiplayer and open is imperative on a societal and individual level. Driven by the acceleration of an automated, machine-learning based world, open data and legitimate information are becoming critically scarce resources. It is critical to break the data oligopoly and control over information that monolithic platforms currently possess.

In addition to limiting sales to members of the community, because blockchains are fun we can layer different price and time-based mechanisms. There are different sale approaches to explore and the correct one will likely depend on the community and type of NFT.\n\nSome mechanisms to think about are:\n\n* One purchase per community member for a period of time and then opening it up to everyone at a set price\n* One purchase per community member for a period of time and then auctioning off the NFTs that are not sold rather than selling them at a set price\n* One purchase per community member at a set price, and changing the price per additional unit bough e.g. `P_x = P * x^2` where `P_x = price for unit x`, `P = set price`. This approach can be layered by opening up the remaining units with the same price function, auction, or set price\n* A combination of the above plus making NFTs non-transferable for a period of time\n\nIdeas like this are explored in more detail by Vitalik in this [post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/22/prices.html).\n\nAll in all, a minimal KYC layer unlocks the exploration of better NFT sales tailored to your specific community.", "timestamp": 1629824583, "digest": "q_5dWKk4DuAgiOUare9Itd5OEok7fGxPoLD3aHUrBMU", "contributor": "0xC09D3402515676B81a2F768C365146ea3faa5605"}

There are different sale approaches to explore and the correct one will likely depend on the community and type of NFT.\n\nSome mechanisms to think about are:\n\n* One purchase per community member for a period of time and then opening it up to everyone at a set price\n* One purchase per community member for a period of time and then auctioning off the NFTs that are not sold rather than selling them at a set price\n* One purchase per community member at a set price, and changing the price per additional unit bought e.g. `P_x = P * x^2` where `P_x = price for unit x`, `P = set price`. This approach can be layered by opening up the remaining units with the same price function, auction, or set price\n* A combination of the above plus making NFTs non-transferable for a period of time\n\nIdeas like this are explored in more detail by Vitalik in this [post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/22/prices.html).\n\nAll in all, a minimal KYC layer unlocks the exploration of better NFT sales tailored to your specific community.", "timestamp": 1629824856, "digest": "q_5dWKk4DuAgiOUare9Itd5OEok7fGxPoLD3aHUrBMU", "contributor": "0xC09D3402515676B81a2F768C365146ea3faa5605"}

Metamask/Rainbow wallet (or another web3 wallet)\n2. ETH for gas fees\n\n## What is OpenSea?\n\n![OpenSea Home Page](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bf8b44a1-6777-4be1-9755-3489d3e45df0.png?height=1538&width=2880)\n\nOpenSea is a peer-to-peer marketplace for trading NFTs. NFTs can be anything from works of art to virtual land, in-game items, and other utility tokens. By collecting NFTs from multiple blockchains, OpenSea acts as a one-stop shop where most collectors go to discover and purchase NFTs.\n\n## How to Mint an NFT on OpenSea\n\n### Step 1: Connect your wallet\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/49540ca8-4f4a-4f86-8577-cc9f7a24819d.png?height=1046&width=878)\n\n* Click on the wallet icon at the top right and connect your wallet. (If you’re using a Rainbow Wallet, you can connect it using the WalletConnect option)\n\n### Step 2: Create a Collection\n\nA Collection is like a folder that allows you to group NFTs that are part of the same series. Each collection has a unique link that displays only the NFTs that are part of that collection. If you are minting a lot of NFTs for different reasons, creating a collection is a good way to organize them and also makes it easy for collectors to access. For example, here is the Rabbithole Quest NFT collection on OpenSea\n\n<https://opensea.io/collection/rabbitholegg>\n\n* To create a collection, go to <https://opensea.io/collections> and click on “Create a Collection”.\n* You’ll need to create a few assets in order to create your collection\n  * Logo Image. Recommended Size: 350 \\* 350 (Required)\n  * Feature Image. Recommended Size: 600 \\* 400 (Optional)\n    * This image will be used when featuring your collection on the homepage or other pages on OpenSea.\n  * Banner Image. Recommended Size: 1400 \\* 400 (Optional)\n    * This image appears at the top of the collection page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b641e75b-c410-417e-b72c-09f870d8e950.png?height=952&width=822)\n\n* Add the Name of your Collection\n* Customize the URL of your collection.\n* Add a description. The limit is 1000 characters and you can use Markdown!\n* Select the Category that your collection represents\n  * You can choose from Art, Music, Trading Cards, Collectibles, Sports, and Utility.\n* Add External Links\n  * You can link to your website, Discord server, Twitter, Instagram, Medium, and Telegram. All links are Optional.\n* Add the Royalty\n  * This allows you to define the percentage of secondary sales that you’d like to receive. You can set a royalty of up to 10%\n  * Once you enter a value, you can add a payout wallet address. Royalties are paid out monthly to the address that you list.\n* Choose the default blockchain\n  * NFTs that are added to this collection will be minted on the blockchain you choose.\n  * You can choose Ethereum or Polygon. The transaction and gas fees on Polygon are very cheap compared to the Ethereum Mainnet.\n  * Choose the blockchain that is most relevant to your application.\n* NSFW Toggle\n  * If your collection will contain items that are NSFW, click on the toggle. This will protect users that have SafeSearch enabled while browsing OpenSea\n\n### Step 3: Create a new item\n\n* Go to <https://opensea.io/asset/create>. This page allows you to add information about your NFT and mint it.\n* Upload the file you’d like to NFT.\n  * OpenSea supports a range of file types like JPG, PNG, GIF, MP4, WEBM, MP3, and more.\n  * The maximum file size supported is 40 MB.\n* Add the name of the item, an external link, and a description.\n  * Markdown is supported in the description.\n* Select the Collection that you’d like to add the NFT to.\n* If you’re creating an NFT series with multiple NFTs that have different traits, you can use the Properties, Levels, and Stats options to include them. This will allow users to calculate how rare a particular trait is.\n* Add Unlockable Content\n  * This content can only be unlocked by the owner of the NFT. You can add a link to a private discord server, link to the high-quality file, etc\n* NSFW Toggle.\n  * Select this if your item is NSFW\n* Blockchain\n  * You can choose either Ethereum or Polygon.\n  * Minting on Ethereum is expensive due to the transaction and gas fees.\n  * Minting on Polygon is very cheap.\n* Supply.\n  * If you choose to mint on Ethereum, you can only choose to mint 1 NFT. Minting on Polygon allows you to mint multiple copies.\n* Click on Create.\n\nYour NFT is now live! You can now choose to list it for sale. Listing it is free. Add the price of the NFT and sign a gasless transaction with your wallet to confirm the listing.\n\nCongratulations! You have now minted an NFT on OpenSea!", "timestamp": 1629825692, "digest": "gNLrq_4rj3LmaJ7FVOLM92IH_BHw9ZtpiTtSa6PNyuQ", "contributor": "0x7721F140C2968D5C639A9B40a1e6CA48a9b7c41D"}

We operate a residency program run by a [DAO (decentralized autonomous organization)](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw).\n\nThe DAO brought together people from across the internet to fund [12 month-long residencies for creators](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ). We have an active [token-gated discord community](https://discord.gg/N6hVmFygjR) and bring people together IRL at the Creator Cabins location in the Texas Hill Country outside of Austin, TX:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\n\n### What are the requirements to apply?\n\nWe ask that all residents be:\n\n1. Vaccinated against COVID-19\n2. Able to attend for the entire duration of the cohort\n3. Able to focus full-time on the residency program\n\nBeyond that, the program is open to anyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, writers, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders, and more.\n\nIf you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n### What skills are we looking for?\n\nCreativity, collaboration, dedication, and diversity. We love the idea of bringing people from wildly different backgrounds together and seeing what happens. What will the conversation be like around the firepit? How will people end up collaborating and supporting each other?\n\n### How do I know I should apply?\n\nThe little voice inside of you telling you your idea is great and you can do it. Believe that voice. Channel it into a Twitter thread for a chance to spend a month working on that project you’ve been itching to build.\n\n### What’s included?\n\nThe residency program includes the following:\n\n* A free, 1-month stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) (valued at $2,800) with your own private bedroom, bathroom, and workspace\n* A 0.25 ETH stipend for food and other essentials\n* Access to a Camp Counselor to coordinate logistics of your trip\n* One month of uninterrupted time to create with a community of collaborators to support you\n* Your own $CABIN tokens and membership in the CabinDAO community\n\n### Can I work on other work (e.g. remote work) while I’m there?\n\nThe goal of this residency program is to unlock the time and space to work on projects you wouldn’t otherwise be able to focus on. We want to support people who will be spending most of their time focused on these projects. While we understand that people may have other commitments, if you aren’t able to dedicate a month to independent creative work, this program is probably not the right fit. We trust the members of this community to use their best judgment based on the goal of this program.\n\n### When will I know if I was selected?\n\nVoting will close on September 2nd, at which point we will reach out on Twitter and/or via email to make sure you meet the requirements and can accept the residency.\n\n### Is this just for US citizens?\n\nNo, this is open to anyone who can travel to the US and will be vaccinated at the start of the program.\n\n### Do I have to submit on Twitter?\n\nWe would prefer applications to be submitted through Twitter so that the broader community can provide feedback.

{"id": "12BvSbmkWYnYjG9--7TzcTHxvaiGujD6Hl6iLEjWg4c", "title": "Ready Player Everyone", "body": "*Or, an introduction to Verse* \n\nThe internet is filled with games - and I'm not talking about ones that are streamed on Twitch. The best internet games are the ones that are hidden in plain sight.\n\nFraming the internet as a collection of games, or even as a giant infinite game in itself, isn't a new idea. Numerous people have [discussed](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game) the implications of internet games and how winning strategies can produce outstanding real-life rewards. Social media stands out as perhaps the most analyzed sector of internet game theory. These games are well understood and exhibit a mature set of players, strategies, modes, and outcomes.\n\nMany of our behaviors around media and, more broadly, information platforms, however, are constrained by one game mode. The hyper-centralization of media has effectively created a single-player experience defined by two problematic features:\n\n1. Monopolistic platforms wield unilateral control over determining the information that we see\n2. While users are responsible for creating and curating information on these networks, they share none of the value generated from their work\n\nThus, single-player information networks suffer from incentive misalignment between the platform and its users. The platform is motivated to aggressively grow a single \"[global water cooler](https://youtu.be/oLsb7clrXMQ?t=953)\" network in order to maximize the amount of attention generated. However, users share none of the upside in the network's growth. Instead, individuals are incentivized to compete with each other to capture a fraction of the network's attention and bankroll that attention into downstream benefits. The result is a **zero-sum, single-player game** in which the platform is the [only guaranteed beneficiary](https://balajis.com/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter/).\n\n![Image credit: Chris Dixon, \"Why Decentralization Matters\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cfadc65d-bb2d-4bfc-8670-97dd537dc17b.png?height=600&width=1200)\n\nIn the last year alone, advertising revenues for every major media and search platform increased between [56](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-alphabet-googl-2q-earnings-report-2021-11627344309)-[74](https://www.yahoo.com/now/twitter-shares-rally-following-fastest-211406730.html)%. The participants on these networks natively earned what amounts to a rounding error on the platform's balance sheet.\n\nThe incentive misalignment between centralized platforms and its users results in an environment in which information becomes a commodity, and valuable information comes at a premium. When there’s infinite upside and zero downside to creating, networks become saturated as noise overtakes signal. Structurally, it's impossible for users to coordinate and produce legitimately valuable information which benefits both individuals and the network simultaneously.\n\nAs Vitalik [argues](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), legitimacy is the most important scarce resource. The net result of the fundamental problem - the value of centralized information networks is not shared by the participants - is this: ***centralized information is legitimacy-constrained***.\n\nThus, it is necessary to build a better system for universal media which enables individual participants to share in the collective upside of the network and coordinate to produce legitimately valuable information.\n\n**This is the Verse protocol.**\n\nVerse is a protocol for multiplayer cryptomedia on Ethereum. What is cryptomedia? As [Jacob Horne](https://twitter.com/js_horne) [explains](https://cryptomedia.wtf/), *cryptomedia can be thought of as hypermedia with built-in property rights*. ERC-721 NFTs are the canonical manifestation of cryptomedia. Each NFT consists of a media component (traditionally, a single URI), and an ownership component by which a single owner holds provenance over the token.\n\nTraditional NFTs conforming to this standard provide an extremely valuable system for facilitating artistry, patronage, and exchange around singular goods. However, they aren’t designed for solving legitimacy constraints around creating and curating valuable information.\n\nVerse introduces a new standard for **multiplayer cryptomedia specifically designed for high-signal information discovery and communication**. Through Verse, anyone can create a cryptomedia contract. Each contract consists of:\n\n1. A collection of media URIs\n2. A tokenized market following a continuous [bonding curve](https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/)\n\nToken-holders are given the ability to add a piece of media to the contract’s collection. The price of each token is programmatically correlated with demand, so token-holders are incentivized to add media which increases the value of the collection and attracts new buyers who want to participate.\n\nVerse thus differentiates from traditional cryptomedia in two important ways:\n\n1. Instead of a single piece of media, each Verse cryptomedia object holds a collection with multiple pieces of media\n2. Instead of a single owner, each Verse cryptomedia object enables tokenized, fractional ownership with an unlimited number of participants\n\n**Why are these innovations important?**\n\nCrypto mechanisms, particularly tokenization and automated market makers, have enabled coordination games that could never practically exist before. What is a coordination game? I'm going to once again [borrow](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) one of Vitalik's definitions here, because it's extremely straightforward. In a coordination game, *if you act in a certain way alone, you are likely to get nowhere (or worse), but if everyone acts together a desired result can be achieved*.\n\n![Image credit: Vitalik Buterin, \"The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/026cb9e0-7cdc-4c7b-82ab-34940b9185ac.png?height=618&width=1510)\n\nLegitimacy is a natural byproduct of a coordination game. In any coordination game, if a mechanism incentivizes participants to cooperate and act together to achieve a goal instead of acting alone, that mechanism has legitimacy. **Verse is designed for individuals to coordinate around creating and curating the most valuable information around any arbitrary topic**. If token holders can coordinate to build a valuable, popular collection of media, the value of their tokens should increase as more people demand the token and want their own pieces of media included in the collection. In contrast, it's expensive for any one individual to add or curate irrelevant information in a market, because doing so decreases the token's value. Currently, web2 platforms produce more noise than signal as their networks grow, and it becomes extremely difficult for consumers to find the highest-quality information in an increasingly cluttered feed. Verse incentivizes perpetual creation and curation of the best information on any topic, enabling efficient and credible discovery.\n\nAs an example, consider the topic of DAOs. As it's such a nascent and trending topic, I want to find the best resources for learning about DAOs and how they operate. Where do I go? General web searches just throw me in an SEO'd hellscape. Trying to sift through social media to find the best thought leaders and posts they've written or recommended is too much work.\n\nWith a #DAOs cryptomedia object, participants are incentivized to produce a collection of high-quality posts on DAOs. I can trust the legitimacy of the information because I know that the market participants are financially motivated to build the most relevant collection possible. In this way, Verse cryptomedia creates a positive-sum ecosystem for generating the highest-quality information on any subject.\n\nSo what is the long-term goal for Verse? At its core, I think of Verse as a search protocol - one that produces information based on legitimized signals from incentivized participants. Information signaling is one of the most important building blocks we use for decision making. As Fred Ehrsam [points out](https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388803655184386?s=20), a lot of life comes down to effective information processing: picking the best option among a bevy of alternatives. **In an age of information saturation, on-chain signaling, uniquely enabled by crypto mechanisms, is the new search**. Rather than centralized algorithms indexing the entirety of the open web to produce results, signals stored on-chain enable anyone to create an algorithm that surfaces results among specific cryptomedia objects. Searchers will pick the algorithm that comes up with the best results in their market(s) of interest.\n\nAlgorithms in the web2 era - such as recommender systems - are highly centralized, opaque and monolithic. In contrast, the Verse protocol enables a free-market for more meritocratic, transparent, and multiplayer algorithms that can be built and implemented by anyone to consume the data in Verse’s cryptomedia contracts. Search becomes not only multiplayer and curated, but also personally-signaled to the searcher. Thus, Verse enables a new permissionless, truly **multiplayer** standard for information legitimacy.\n\nMaking information games more multiplayer and open is imperative on a societal and individual level. Driven by the acceleration of an automated, machine-learning based world, open data and legitimate information are becoming critically scarce resources. It is critical to break the data oligopoly and control over information that monolithic platforms currently possess. Our game needs an update.\n\n**Ready Player Everyone.**", "timestamp": 1629832182, "digest": "2IlOa5B-eMCuSMTGjYq4lsdPRzOwqqIqy9XzHycsmrY", "contributor": "0xe5E4B1EC4061d6fC932207DFc5CF96bD27FB11Da"}

Items he traded for along the way include a hand-sculpted doorknob, a snowmobile, a year’s rent in Phoenix, and an afternoon with musician Alice Cooper.\n\nIt’s an amazing story and even an archetypal one---an old Buddhist folk tale tells of a man who traded from a single piece of straw until he had a rice field. The Legend of Zelda’s “trade up” quests took inspiration from this classic story, as have others.\n\n**With the incredible diversity of NFTs available today a similarly magical tale is possible. So let’s create it.** Come trade with us and let’s tell the story of some amazing NFTs along the way.  \n\n![](https://s.mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fa58d4f4c-47bd-41e8-b48d-c6fce513b9be.jpeg\\&w=3840\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n**Today we are offering up our first trade which is, naturally, a paperclip.** More specifically it’s a “$Paper/$Clip” NFT for a *redeemed* Uniswap position. You can see it [here](https://opensea.io/assets/0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88/103126).\n\nHere's how to trade with us:\n\n1.  Check our twitter [@paperclipDAO](https://twitter.com/paperclipDAO) for the pinned tweet telling you what NFT we're offering for trade.\n2.  Create an offer on [Sudoswap](https://sudoswap.xyz/) to exchange your NFT for our NFT. Sudoswap will generate a trade link.\n3.  Tweet your trade link at [@paperclipDAO](https://twitter.com/paperclipDAO), proposing the trade. $CLIP holders will then vote on whether or not to accept your trade.\n4.  If yes, we swap!\n\n**So about those $CLIP tokens...** anyone who successfully trades with us gets $CLIP tokens so they can join the DAO and continue to create the story. The first to trade with us will get the most $CLIP, and as the story becomes richer and the NFTs more innately valuable the amount of $CLIP given will decline (in an interesting way perhaps…)\n\nWhere will this journey end? We think it might be cool to rescue an unobtainable NFT, maybe one from another dimension, and make it available to the community. But only time will tell.\n\nLet’s start swapping and find out.\n\nTo keep up with this adventure, [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/6JbGUMDkMp) and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paperclipDAO).\n", "timestamp": 1629839204, "digest": "mOCENLvP1aYXOBOPiLoLjBlSTvJWBqccfkn4gTPJ8qM", "contributor": "0xdD2DB8E99E49a6aAae2BBa9A50c2FDbaadB60FE5"}

Most DeFi projects are two-sided marketplaces for some type of financial service — for example, Compound is a marketplace for borrowers/lenders and Uniswap is a marketplace for LPs/traders. Bootstrapping a new two-sided marketplace is difficult because of the cold-start problem: if there is no demand, there won’t be supply, and if there is no supply there will be no demand. This is where tokens come in handy — projects can incentivize one (or both) sides of the marketplace through distributing their own token to kickstart the demand-supply flywheel. \n\nAnother side effect of executing liquidity mining program is that the project is able to distribute their native token to more people. More holders of the token often leads to broader support for the project, or greater level of decentralization if the token is used for governance. This dual-benefit often makes LM programs a no-brainer.\n\nHowever, the primary drawback of Liquidity Mining programs is that it often gets farmed and dumped by whales or yield aggregators — the capital committed to providing liquidity often dries up the moment the incentives stop flowing. Projects often find it difficult to have *sustained* benefits from the LM programs after they are done. \n\n# Introducing Insurance Mining\n\nInstead of simply incentivizing liquidity, what if we could indirectly incentivize usage through subsidizing an insurance market for smart contract failure? For example, we could give out tokens to insurance sellers for a new protocol, attracting tons of liquidity into the insurance selling pool, and on the opposite side providing cheap cover for users of the project. \n\nWe can call this *Liquidity Mining Rewards V3.*\n\n[https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1426829355532136452](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1426829355532136452)\n\nBeing able to purchase cheap cover could potentially remove much of the early friction in trying out a new DeFi project. Over time, the project can slowly build up “Lindy-ness” as it gets derisked by being in production without getting exploited, and the incentives can be gracefully turned off over time. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2cb9ac15-4d8f-4086-9bfe-a36478e71c63.png?height=917&width=1228)\n\nAs per this illustration, the cost of cover is highest when a project is in the earliest stages due to unknown smart contract risks. Over time, the cost of cover should come down as people gain more confidence in the project’s code. If projects can provide a subsidy for insurance in the early stages, they can likely attract more users — another way to solve the “cold start” problem of two sided marketplaces.\n\nFurthermore, Insurance Mining also has the nice property of being able to be gracefully turned off without materially damaging the experience of the product. Liquidity Mining only benefits a project while that liquidity is in the protocol — once it leaves, the project becomes as shitty as it once was. Insurance Mining on the other hand is much more elegant because the cost of cover *naturally* comes down over time, so insurance subsidies can be turned off without users having to suddenly pay more for cover. \n\n# Implementation\n\nThe next natural question to ask is, how do we construct an Insurance Mining program on a code-level? \n\nIn theory, it should be pretty simple — projects can bootstrap an insurance market on a protocol of their choice (ideally it gives insurance sellers a *receipt token*), then have insurance writers stake their receipt tokens in a custom Insurance Mining contract to earn rewards. \n\nOne caveat to note is that to assign rewards fairly to insurance sellers, we must create *segregated insurance pools* that only use the capital to write insurance on your specific protocol. This itself could make the whole exercise not economically viable for insurance sellers, since the economics for fully-collateralized insurance are not very favorable (capital inefficient) — but we can potentially make up for that inefficiency with a more aggressive rewards schedule. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nInsurance Mining can be a much more incentive-aligned way of distributing tokens to parties who create *sustainable* value to a protocol, compared to Liquidity Mining.

I’ve found that Twitter has been a great place to incubate ideas by engaging with artists, collectors, and technologists in the space. Yet, despite my penchant for the occasional [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/JO7eth/status/1381790625293602819?utm_campaign=Curare.&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), I’ve found Twitter to be suboptimal for sharing long-form content.\n>\n> That’s why I’ve created ***Curare***—a newsletter where I can pull on those threads a bit more intentionally and share more fully-formed thoughts about NFTs and art in general. The idea is to use this space as a vehicle to curate my observations, insights, and ideas with greater care and discernment.\n>\n> I chose the name Curare as a reference to the Latin root word meaning “to take care,” from which the word *curate* derives its meaning. In today’s culture, curation is applied more broadly to connote the idea of selective filtering, especially with regard to content. But in actuality, curation traces its roots back to the Roman *[curatores](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0063%3Aentry%3Dcuratores-cn&utm_campaign=Curare.&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter),* state officials who were chartered with the remit of building out the infrastructure of the Roman Empire, including ancient innovations such as the Roman roads and aqueduct system.\n>\n> The point here is that curation has always been about driving *new* creation, not filtering *existing* creation for consumption. It is this original, ancient charter of curation that motivates me to collect art. Indeed, when I purchase a piece from an artist, my intention isn’t simply to consume and admire the art. Rather, I look to foster a relationship with the artist in a way that enables me to play an orthogonal role in the artist’s creative process. **Stated simply: I take care of artists.**\n>\n> My intention with ***Curare*** is to share stories, insights, and ideas that will support the NFT community in forging a new value model—one that places the artist at the center. It is also my intention to do this in an inclusive and equitable manner, taking care to shed light on underexposed spaces and amplifying unheard voices.", "timestamp": 1629852198, "digest": "5SvZXi0ILlZPyrpJdGh1KWh4j3HwHaeDtAz_-1lG_OM", "contributor": "0xF65ffeD29a2E7Ca9554CfeA52EA500b5Adc5fC13"}

[Calvin](https://twitter.com/cjliu49), welcome to PaperclipDAO! 🖇**\n\n![\"The Paperclip\" Punk #3744 and a Dissected Meebit #10761 ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa1edbee-857e-4146-a800-8e8c4d69c9dd.png?height=1146&width=1899)\n\nWe weighed several factors in making a final decision on which trade to accept. We care about more than just the economic value of a trade; we value the culture, story, and journey of the NFT as well. In Round 1, we picked the future. But the past always has a way of coming back around… And the 2 (ok 1.02) historic LarvaLabs NFTs we acquired bridge the past to the future beautifully.\n\nThis decision wasn’t easy; we received incredible offers and, as in Round 1, were sad to part with all the memorable NFTs that we couldn’t accept. Check out the full [Round 2 offer thread](https://discord.gg/ePU79bhBjs) to see all the amazing offers.\n\nWe only have time to highlight a few of our favorites. In no particular order, here is our homage to the ones that got away in Round 2:\n\n* Several offers paid homage to @paperclipDAO. To immortalize the Parallel Trade from @bitcoinPalmer, urukai ([discord link](https://discord.com/channels/874453658425757729/874453942279495680/876169347423428659)) created 2 Proof of Beauty $HASH pieces: One that represents the tx from Palmer to Planck ($HASH sent to Palmer in tx - 0x9d685696e1401a38eee957665f57a720212b409b373c8fe275608309c44da9cb) and a second that represents the tx from Planck to the PaperclipDAO address. What an awesome gesture! We were also offered a [$CLIP Kitty](https://opensea.io/assets/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d/906847) by AnimalTPFR ([discord link](https://discord.com/channels/874453658425757729/874453942279495680/875903985746346004)).\n* We received several offers for [Blitmaps](https://www.blitmap.com), a really cool community started by [Dom Hofmann](https://twitter.com/dhof). Blitmaps and their metadata are stored and processed entirely on-chain. There are 100 originals, created by 17 artists, which the community mixed to make 1,600 siblings — unique pieces that combine the composition of one original with the palette of another. We were offered a sibling: [Pale Tower Warm Vibe ](https://opensea.io/assets/0x8d04a8c79ceb0889bdd12acdf3fa9d207ed3ff63/966)(from [avilés](https://discord.com/channels/874453658425757729/874453942279495680/877022849204879450)) and an original (!!!)

Granolah later upped his offer to include 3 cool cats as well.\n* [OhhShiny](https://twitter.com/AxieKing) offered us [Bored Ape 636](https://opensea.io/assets/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/636), a zombie and dmt (and also our first BAYC offer!) The [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC) NFTs double as a PFP and a Yacht Club membership (aka a swamp club for Apes). We received a few other offers for PFPs: [Sisyphus](https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus) offered a crowned [Pudgy Penguin](https://opensea.io/assets/0xbd3531da5cf5857e7cfaa92426877b022e612cf8/2251) and state ([discord link](https://discord.com/channels/874453658425757729/874453942279495680/877032545064222740)) offered a bundle of a [classy pengu](https://opensea.io/assets/0xbd3531da5cf5857e7cfaa92426877b022e612cf8/2120) & [classy meeb](https://opensea.io/assets/0x7bd29408f11d2bfc23c34f18275bbf23bb716bc7/4875).\n* We already mentioned our beloved CryptoPunk #3744 but we also received an incredible offer from [Andy8052](https://twitter.com/andy8052) for [80,000 $DEAD tokens](https://fractional.art/vaults/0x0C7060BF06a78AAAAB3fac76941318A52a3F4613) (currently valued at $200,000) which represent 6.66% of [Zombie Punk #2066](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/2066), ([link to discord](https://discord.com/channels/874453658425757729/874453942279495680/877652589326508052)).\n* Mr. bulldops offered the [0xmons Dza](https://opensea.io/assets/0x0427743df720801825a5c82e0582b1e915e0f750/170) ([discord link](https://discord.com/channels/874453658425757729/874453942279495680/877697951575732224)), a Lovecraftian “pixel monster” generated by a neural net. Though we find it hard to believe that the artist behind this amazing project is the same 0xmons who created our beloved sudoswap, we have been assured this is actually the case.\n* We were also offered a [FuckinTroll](https://opensea.io/assets/0x240eb6b465f61dfc965053791f963cd0f0e4fdb0/1933), a [Shiny Nyan Cat](https://opensea.io/assets/0xb32979486938aa9694bfc898f35dbed459f44424/7) ([discord link](https://discord.com/channels/874453658425757729/874453942279495680/877687465664733214)), several [Treeverse plots](https://twitter.com/TheTreeverse), and a few [RTFKT](https://twitter.com/RTFKTstudios) NFTs.

Cliff proposed that this swap would represent a unique intersection of PaperclipDAO, Parallel, Matt Furie, POAP, Metaverse DAO, and Cryptovoxels, forming a beautiful bond of NFT history ([discord link](https://discord.com/channels/874453658425757729/874453942279495680/877624309340864573)).\n\nEach of these offers adds to the storied history of the PaperclipDAO and we couldn’t be more excited to add our second trade to the history books.

{"id": "xHc7RRnvv-cspSclI2_-YtdPe5V8QlDwQMTGjWwou48", "title": "Tutorial: How to Swap Tokens on 1inch", "body": "[1inch](https://app.1inch.io/) is a [DEX aggregator](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/dex-aggregator) with over $70B in total volume across 540k+ users. To give users the best token exchange rates, 1inch searches across various liquidity sources & swaps your tokens on the exchange with the cheapest rate.\n\n[https://app.1inch.io/](https://app.1inch.io/)\n\nThey support 50+ liquidity sources on the Ethereum network, 20+ on Binance Smart Chain, and 7+ on Polygon, and their Pathfinder algorithm optimizes for the most cost efficient token swap path if necessary to minimize fees.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nAs people become more crypto native, they'll initiate more on-chain transactions, which will, in turn, result in more fees paid to the network. In the long run, these fees add up, so any effort to minimize them is a good practice. In addition, since cryptocurrencies are volatile assets, using DEX aggregators like 1inch can help minimize [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage) too.\n\nThere are 4 main parts to 1inch:\n\n* **The Aggregation Protocol** — aggregates on-chain price data from DEXs and helps you pick the best DEX on which you should swap your tokens.\n* **The Liquidity Protocol** — an [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) that prevents front-running attacks and provides yield to liquidity providers.\n* **The Limit Order Protocol** — allows you to initiate limit orders in DeFi.\n* **The DAO & its governance token** — a decentralized autonomous organization that governs the broader 1inch network. Using the 1inch token, holders can vote on 1inch governance proposals.\n\nFor the sake of this guide, we'll focus on the aggregation protocol & walk through how to swap tokens on 1inch.\n\n## How to Swap Tokens using 1inch\n\n### Step 1: Navigate to the 1inch dApp and connect your crypto wallet.\n\n![Click \"Connect Wallet\" & Sign in with your Metamask](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a88d33cc-b55d-45fc-b0ce-eea9cfdb989a.png?height=156&width=2798)\n\n### Step 2: Select the token you want to swap in the \"From\" drop-down menu & input the amount of that token you want to exchange.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/035c00cf-89a4-4cb5-8793-c340456ed690.png?height=1236&width=984)\n\n### Step 3: Select the token you want to receive in the \"To\" drop-down menu.\n\nYou should immediately see the amount of tokens to be received (minus slippage) show up in the \"To\" area. You should also see multiple options for the exchanges you can use to swap your tokens. Since 1inch is a DEX aggregator, you can choose whichever exchange gives you the best rate directly from their interface, similar to how you may use Kayak for booking travel.\n\n### Step 4: Swap your tokens.\n\nIf this is your first time using [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/), you'll have to \"Give permission to swap,\" which will trigger an \"approval transaction.\" The approval transaction is not the swap transaction. You'll have to initiate a second transaction to actually swap your tokens, incurring gas fees both times.\n\nClick the swap button to swap your tokens & confirm the transaction in your wallet.\n\n### Congratulations! You've officially swapped tokens using 1inch.\n\n\n---\n\nIf you have any questions about this guide, feel free to reach out directly on Twitter [@NotZachDavidson](https://twitter.com/NotZachDavidson).", "timestamp": 1629872404, "digest": "OzbK05w_pHTX9GWm_Q_4KCooZPJUnZ-RnrBdwMGXF0Y", "contributor": "0xE8B0016130A38f26c116576A7b13267c9FB11B59"}

Alternatives that are **sustainable and transparent** and work for both the creators and their audiences.\n\nTo kick off this new endeavour we’ve launched and experiment in co-curation between creators: *Chains* 💿 ⛓️\n\n### How do chains work?\n\nA token is passed from creator to creator allowing the holder to add a work to the chain whereby the token's path through the network of contributors function as the curation mechanism.\n\nEach chain is funded by the sale of **100 collector edition tokens** that grant access to downloads, special discord channels and further perks down the line.\n\n### How do I get involved?\n\nFirst ting to do is to pick up one of the collector tokens listed on OpenSea for a mere 0.01 ETH. Doing so directly supports the contributing artists and their work.\n<https://opensea.io/assets/0xderive>\n\nSecondly there's the Discord. It's open for everyone to join and we encourage you to do so if you're just remotely interested in learning more about Derive and where we're going with this.\n<https://discord.gg/q4FJBkXF8Y>\n\n### How far is the project?\n\nThe first two of four genesis chains have been launched and the first music has already been added. We've sold the first collector tokens and funds have been transferred to the creators in accordance with the funding model. It dictates a **direct 10% share** for each contributing artist or group. The collector tokens are being released as the chain progresses and new contributors are onboarded.\n\n### What's the plan?\n\nBecause much of the process at the moment is manual the four genesis chains allow us to tweak and refine the process and models as we set them in motion. The idea is to figure out what parts work and improve and automate things as Derive progresses. That means developing new smarts contracts, improve and add more features to the UI and work on including the community in more and more processes. We want to develop the project in a direction that best suits the two main groups of the project: contributors and collectors aka artist and audience.\n\nConcerning the latter we are actively working to form a **DAO** around Derive. A community platform owned, operated and developed by the people contributing to it is the end goal for this project.\n\nThanks for reading and stay tuned for more!\n\n💿⛓️\n\n[derive.works](https://derive.works)", "timestamp": 1629878069, "digest": "VohVXHjolw1NuuzpwZmfRTuJO9qdRrPAQH0w8IQc1FU", "contributor": "0x59abbee2F246946Dba01fb037Be603CC0B2B3909"}

Lahrmann, a composer, producer and musician who has been performing as Excelsior since 2015.\n\nThe voice is often the aorta in Lahrmann’s body of work. She approaches composition as narrative sequences in which vocal structures, melodic lines and chords unfold alongside chains of digital processing like small paths in a landscape.\n\nHaving developed her musical persona by positioning herself amongst varying constellations of musicians, she tends to see herself more as a collaborator than a frontwoman bouncing openly against the borders of collectivism and DIY.\n\nWe are stoked to have Anja join [Derive](https://derive.works) and look forward to her contribution. To support Anja and Chain #003 head on over to [Opensea](https://opensea.io/assets/0x399dad55c6bdabd7ebe0ada12627c261f81c6428/3) to collect one of the 15 currently listed tokens for a mere 0.01 ETH.

This is the third time USV has invested in a DAO and we will blog about the other two in the coming weeks. These are token transactions denominated in ETH and ERC-20 assets with no other paperwork. All governance is done inside the DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). In the case of Bright Moments, the DAO voted on our transaction over the weekend and approved it unanimously. This is a new world of business entity, governance, and a lot more that is exciting to USV and we plan to continue investing in it.\n\nSo what is Bright Moments? Well, it is a work in progress that is exploring the intersection of NFTs, real-world spaces, entertainment, and onboarding new crypto enthusiasts. Bright Moments started as [a popup gallery in Venice Beach California](https://brightmoments.io/) where NFT artists drop/show new work and collectors buy it in real-time in a physical space. Then the Bright Moments DAO created an NFT series celebrating the local Venice Beach community called [CryptoVenetians](https://twitter.com/cryptovenetians) and minted 1000 of them, from sunrise to sunset and nighttime. These CryptoVenetians were given away to people who came to the Bright Moments Gallery with an Ethereum wallet on their phone. For many, this was the first time they installed and used an Ethereum wallet.\n\nNext, Bright Moments is going to take this show on the road, starting with NYC this fall and then onto eight more cities around the world to get to a full collection of 10,000 NFTs. Last week Bright Moments [auctioned off 200 tickets to the NYC gallery](https://brightmoments.mirror.xyz/WBND1KbJvg6ripddVSasW0wkvhTeXmCOdCh2rzRGpkE) and they will give away the other 800.\n\nWe are interested in and excited by the intersection of the real world and the virtual world and we think Bright Moments has found an interesting model to bring new people into crypto in a fun and entertaining way. We are excited to support this effort and appreciate the Bright Moments community inviting us into the Bright Moments DAO.\n\n<!-- .entry-content -->\n\n<!-- #post-${ID} -->\n", "timestamp": 1629891643, "digest": "MPLZC0B2MFiqzxPTAhb-F7abYz5zKQ_57wlWebOsWpA", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

This includes any selection of pieces, components, or characters within it, or the collection as a whole.\n\nRecent developments in the NFT ecosystem indicate an increasing desire for NFTs to incorporate some of the same ideals that crypto itself is based on. Namely, that value comes from a decentralized ledger, the provenance it enables, and the trustless composability that comes out of it. At the same time, these new ideals encourage a more open ecosystem of work where historical gatekeepers (“moats”) are not the primary drivers for proliferation or longevity.\n\nWe choose to incorporate these values into our beliefs around Blitmap.\n\nWe believe that attention and mindshare — in other worlds, culture — are increasingly becoming the greatest drivers for sustainability in our space. It doesn’t matter if derivative works or outright copies can be created. In fact, it’s probably better. Every derivative work shares some of its significance with the original it was based on, and vice versa. Over time, the original has the capability to become a platform and ecosystem in and of itself.\n\nIn making our decision, we considered some pros and cons:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Decentralizes distribution and significance.** Derivatives are created trustlessly. Every derivative increases attention and mindshare of the original.\n* **Aligns interests.** Creators can make self-sustainable derivatives. They are incentivized to create more (and hopefully, higher quality) derivatives.\n* **Simplifies things.** No more worrying about rights, or answering questions about what is and isn’t okay. Everything is spelled out and easy to understand. We can focus on our work and we can be *surprised *by what the community does.\n* It’s **crypto-native.**\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **No exclusive rights.** Both the entity and the individual artists have the same rights as everyone else: to create derivatives.\n* **Bad actors**. The IP could be co-opted or otherwise tainted by trolls, extreme political groups, cults, etc.\n* **Will seem less valuable to some**. Some people will believe that IP is the moat and believe Blitmap has less significance if it is given up.\n\nWe also considered a list of fictional works and universes that are already in the public domain:\n\n* King Arthur\n* Shakespeare\n* Dracula\n* The Wizard of Oz\n* Jane Eyre\n* Little Women\n* Moby Dick\n* Peter Pan\n\nAn interesting thing about these examples is that many of the derivative works they are reponsible for are *not* public domain. In other words, just because the foundation and universe of King Arthur is public domain, it does not mean that adaptations like *The Green Knight* or *The Sword in the Stone* are. Still, these adaptations contribute to the significance of the original as a whole. Imagine a world where the King Arthur mythology was started on a blockchain and its components were represented as tokens. Surely, there is value in proving one is *the* creator or *the* owner of *the* Excalibur.\n\n# Does this include Blitnauts or future expansion packs?\n\nCurrently, we are releasing the original Blitmap collection, including any selection of pieces, components, or characters within it, and the collection as a whole.\n\nOur plan is to release all IP created in Season 1, including Blitnauts, the third expansion pack, and the lore reveal shortly *after* their respective drops. After Season 1, we will reevaluate and decide on our plans for future IP, but we are optimistic!\n\nYou are, of course, free to create your own expansions or interpretations (including new Blitnauts) at any time.\n\n# Does this include both originals and siblings?\n\nBecause the siblings themselves are derivative works made by combining originals, they are in a bit of a grey area. In theory, we currently have the right to release siblings, but just doing that feels strange. We value community involvement and acknowledge that the community owns most of the siblings in existence. To that end, we will put out a vote to Blitmap owners today asking for support to also release the sibling collection.\n\nRegardless of outcome, you can always use the original Blitmaps however you like, including (but certainly not limited to) remixing or combining them to create your own siblings.\n\n# What about naming?\n\nCC0 does not affect trademark rights. We are working on opening up the naming separately, but this will require a little more work on our end. For now, we would ask that you refrain from the following phrasing in your derivative works: “Official”, “Canon”, “Blitmap(s)” or “Blitnaut(s)” followed by any sequence number, *just* “Blitmap(s)”, or *just* “Blitnauts(s)”.\n\n✅ My Little Blitnauts \\n ✅ Baby Blitmaps \\n ✅ Blitland \\n ✅ Blitmaps GAN \\n ✅ Coolblits \\n ✅ Blit Blit Maps\n\n❌ Blitmaps \\n ❌ Blitnauts 2 \\n ❌ Blitmap Mk III \\n ❌ Blitnauts Part 4 \\n ❌ Official Baby Blitnauts\n\n# Does my derivative also need to be public domain?\n\nNo. There may be mutual community benefits in it but it is entirely up to you.\n\n# Do I need to acknowledge Blitmap in my derivative?\n\nNo. There may be mutual community benefits in it but it is entirely up to you.\n\n# I’m making a commercial derivative. Do I need to share profits with Blitmap?\n\nNo. There may be mutual community benefits in it but it is entirely up to you.\n\n# Does this include merch/games/toys/shows/etc?\n\nYes. You can do whatever you like.\n\n# When does this take effect? Is there documentation?\n\nAll the original artists agreed unanimously in a 17 of 17 decision, so we believe this takes effect today. For anyone who wants further assurance and immutability, we are also working on creating a smart contract that contains the release, which every artist will sign with their wallet. We expect to deploy this in the coming weeks.\n\n—\n\nWe love NFTs and the new possibilities they open for world building and storytelling. In some ways, this change is a bet on the NFT premise as a whole. In other ways, it’s just a natural extension of our own “community crafted” values. We are looking forward to seeing what we can make together.\n\nIf you are interested in discussing this or anything else related to Blitmap, join us on our Discord: **<https://discord.gg/blitmap>**\n\nP.S.
