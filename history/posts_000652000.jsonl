The company brought in $1.2 billion in 2020 with a profit of $332 million. Better yet, the cryptocurrency exchange has kicked off 2021 at a startling pace, handling a higher volume of transactions in Q1 than the entirety of last year.\n\nThose metrics won't come cheaply, with Coinbase's expected valuation at $100 billion. Skeptics will point out that represents a remarkably steep revenue multiple, particularly for a volatile business that moves with the price of underlying assets.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0b518bed-c2e5-4762-994a-f8f3b67a1503.jpeg?height=1080&width=1920&hide=true)\n\n## Analysts\n\n- [Jill Carlson](https://twitter.com/jillruthcarlson)\n- [Ryan Todd](https://twitter.com/\\_RJTodd)\n- [Katherine Wu](https://twitter.com/katherineykwu)\n- [Lex Sokolin](https://twitter.com/LexSokolin)\n- [Michael Sidgmore](https://twitter.com/michaelsidgmore?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Ellie Frost](https://twitter.com/BlockBytch_)\n- [Max Heald](https://twitter.com/max_heald)\n- [Marc Rubinstein](https://twitter.com/MarcRuby)\n- [David Wei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dlw17/)\n- [Adam Draper](https://twitter.com/AdamDraper)\n- [Ian Kar](https://twitter.com/iankar_)\n- [Mario Gabriele](https://twitter.com/mariodgabriele)\n\n## Introduction\n\nA card sits on the table in front of you. \n\nPick it up. The side facing you reads, in dark black pen:\n\nTHE STATEMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE IS TRUE\n\nYou turn it over. The same dark writing.\n\nTHE STATEMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE IS FALSE\n\n\nPerhaps you turn it over again. True. False. True. False. Which should you believe? No matter how times you look, no resolution appears, words absorbing thought like the color black absorbs light.\n\n**The artwork below was created by [Jack Butcher](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher) of [Visualize Value](visualizevalue.com). It can be bid on via the modal below. Proceeds from this NFT will flow to the [$GENERALIST token](https://generalist.mirror.xyz/1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw).

A physicist and adherent of Bertrand Russell, Jourdain shared his idol's interest in enigmas like this one, philosophy's version of the infinite loop. As written, Jourdain's program should run endlessly — as irresistible as it is infuriating.\n\nIt is also an apt encapsulation of Coinbase, a company of irresolvable contradictions. On one side, Coinbase tells us:\n\n\nDECENTRALIZED SYSTEMS ARE THE FUTURE\n\nOn the other, it says:\n\nCOINBASE IS CENTRALIZED\n\nA second card reads:\n\nTRUSTLESS SYSTEMS ARE SAFEST\n\nThe opposite side:\n\nTRUST US\n\nA third reads: \n\nWE ARE BUILDING THE FUTURE\n\nThe reverse:\n\nWE DON’T ENGAGE WITH SOCIETAL ISSUES\n\nIf most stocks are a Rorschach test, revealing something different to each viewer, Coinbase is an ouroboros, a snake that eats itself. Decentralization eats centralization which eats decentralization, trustlessness devours trust (and visa-versa), ideologues and political apathetes look at each other in disdain and ask, \"what are *you* doing here?\" Round and round we go.\n\nRather than a failing, Coinbase's position at the center of such contradictions may explain much of its success. When the company launched in 2012, three years after CEO Brian Armstrong spent Christmas Day reading Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper, cryptocurrencies were esoterica, the province of wonks and tech-anarchists. While Armstrong and co-founder Fred Ehrsam were true idealogues — Ehrsam once responded to an HR report suggesting company morale was low by exclaiming, \"If you don't believe in bitcoin and this company, you shouldn't be fucking working here\" — Coinbase's flourishing has owed much to its ability to tread a path between disparate worlds and ideas. Yes, Armstrong and Ehrsam were economic apostates — contrarian and bold enough to believe that a new financial system was possible — but in suits and starched shirts, they represented the most palatable of heretics.\n\n## Number of mentions in S-1\n\n*   Bitcoin: 112\n*   Brian Armstrong: 79\n*   Ethereum: 57\n*   Fred Ehrsam: 33\n*   Neutrino: 13\n*   Satoshi Nakamoto: 4\n*   Binance: 4\n*   HODL: 2\n\n\n## History\n\nBrian Armstrong met Coinbase's first co-founder on a message board. A reserved programmer in the UK, Ben Reeves shared Armstrong's conviction that bitcoin could upend the traditional financial system. The two men applied to Y Combinator with their budding company: Coinbase, a simple wallet and payment platform for bitcoin.\n\n![Coinbase.com in 2012](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/605381537fd50635635ef162\\_18.png)\n\nDays before Reeves was supposed to leave for California, Armstrong sent an email, ending the partnership:\n\n> Cofounding is really like a marriage. Even though I think we have mutual respect for each other, we don't work together extremely well.\n\nThat would prove the right decision. Though Armstrong completed YC as a solo founder, it didn't take much longer for him to find the right partner. A few months after demo day, Armstrong met Fred Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs trader with a computer science background. Again, a message board had provided the spark, with the two exchanging thoughts on Reddit. Ehrsam's financial expertise and facility in traditional circles added an air of legitimacy to the operation and provided an energetic cultural foil to Armstrong's more reserved style. \n\nWhile graduating from YC represented a significant accomplishment, it didn't make fundraising easy for Coinbase. With bitcoin peaking at a whopping $15.50 during that period, Armstrong and Ehrsam's chosen market was unproven and seemingly trivial. The company raised a $600K seed from angel investors Adam Draper (!), Greg Kidd, and Barry Silbert, in addition to Initialized Capital.  \n\n![Initialized Capital](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/60538160fa118f19bc0f0f2b\\_17.png)\n\nIt would never be quite so hard again. Coinbase had strong traction going into the 2013 Series A with 200,000 users, up from 13,000 the year prior. That was enough to tempt USV into leading the round. In a sign that crypto interest was maturing and that Coinbase's numbers spoke for themselves, the company managed to secure USV's investment without Fred Wilson in the room. As detailed in the excellent *Kings of Crypto *by Jeff John Roberts (from which we have drawn several anecdotes), Wilson was the most crypto-native investor on the team at the time. When Ehrsam heard Wilson would not make it (he was sick), he turned to Armstrong and said, \"we are so fucked.\" They were not.\n\n\nA few months later, Coinbase brought in a $25 million Series B, which powered them to 1 million in 2014. A $75 million Series C arrived in 2015, and the following year Coinbase added its second currency to the platform: Ethereum. The new asset had been created by Vitalik Buterin, a young programmer that had hung around Coinbase's offices in the early days. Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash followed.\n\n\nAfter adding $108 million in 2017 and acqui-hiring Balaji Srinivasan in 2018, Coinbase began adding new currencies more aggressively. Though a controversial figure in the company’s history, SrinIvasan was successful in that aim; today Coinbase supports more than 45 assets.\n\nThough the company succeeded in maintaining momentum during the crypto winter, the last twelve months have been particularly remarkable. As bitcoin prices have skyrocketed, so have Coinbase's numbers. Today, the company reports that it has 43 million wallets on the platform, up from 32 million the year prior. Institutional products picked up speed too. Coinbase's S-1 states the company grew clients from 1,000 to over 7,000 by the end of last year.\n\n\nOver the years and throughout a changing cast of characters, Coinbase has shown an admirable ability to focus on what matters. While other exchanges may have greater variety or slightly different feature sets, Coinbase has emphasized accessibility and security. In the process, the company has democratized access to investing in crypto and opened up the asset class.\n\n*The artwork below was created by [Jack Butcher](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher) of [Visualize Value](visualizevalue.com).

Ethereum miners also earned over $1 billion in [network transaction fees](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/on-chain-metrics/ethereum/ethereum-miner-revenue-monthly) in the first two months of 2021 — a testament to the level of sustained economic activity occurring on non-bitcoin protocols.\n\n\nThe financialization of the crypto economy has also produced considerable monthly lending activity, with more than $50 billion of [crypto-collateral](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/total-value-locked-tvl/true-value-locked-and-total-value-locked) stored in smart contract-based financial protocols (DeFi).\n\n\nThe list goes on.\n\n\nForget annualizing. In just one quarter, that's trillions of dollars of value flow and deposits with crypto assets of all types — cryptocurrencies, derivatives, stablecoins, NFTs, crypto-secured collateral — much of which is occurring outside traditional financial institutions and payment systems. As the largest US crypto exchange, Coinbase finds itself in the center of this burgeoning ecosystem.\n\n\nDespite the fact that the total market value of all crypto assets [nears $2 trillion](https://www.coingecko.com/en), and exchange volumes have tripled, exchange web traffic still has yet to [crack highs set in Jan 2018](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/alternative-crypto-metrics/web-traffic/cryptocurrency-exchange-web-traffic-monthly). Google search trends for \"Coinbase\" or \"Bitcoin\" have yet to eclipse highs set [last cycle](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/alternative-crypto-metrics/web-traffic/google-search-volumes). That's an indication that this bull run is different from the last; crypto is becoming institutionalized virtually overnight.\n\n\nWhereas the 2017-2018 crypto cycle was retail-driven, this cycle has seen a broad spectrum of institutions come to market with more purposeful crypto strategies and ways to gain exposure to the industry. That's helped bring in capital at a higher clip. Three critical developments:\n\n\n*   **Corporate America eyes Bitcoin as a potential treasury asset.** Headlined by MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square — who together hold over $4 billion worth of bitcoin at current prices — the interest from corporate treasurers in exploring bitcoin as a reserve asset has reached new highs in 2021. In February, MicroStrategy hosted a summit dedicated to educating corporations interested in investing in bitcoin and, [according to CEO Michael Saylor](https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1358098129489440769?lang=en), had over 8,000 attendees from nearly 7,000 unique enterprises.\n*   **Financial incumbents explore how to bank and support the crypto ecosystem.** A pair of interpretive letters released by the US Office of the Comptroller (OCC) in 2020 said that chartered banks could custody and service the crypto industry and use public blockchains and stablecoins for settlement. That's opened the door for banks and financial services to expand new business models in crypto. This paves the way for the emergence of more robust global fiat on and off-ramps and other critical financial infrastructure missing in past cycles.\n*   **Banks and institutional asset management community consider bringing crypto exposure to institutional portfolios.** According to Goldman Sachs' Global Head of Digital Assets, Matt McDermott, the bank recently [surveyed](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/podcasts/episodes/03-05-2021-mathew-mcdermott-f/transcript.pdf) its institutional client base (n=300) and found that ~40% of clients reported already having exposure to cryptocurrency (across derivatives, structured products, equities with exposure).\n\n\nThis last point is an essential backdrop for the Coinbase direct listing. The public market demand for crypto exposure is insatiable. Look no further than crypto-linked stocks such as Silvergate (SI), Galaxy Digital (OTCMKTS: BRPHF), and Voyager (OTCMKTS: VYGVF). All three well-outperformed[ bitcoin returns in 2020](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/crypto-markets/prices/crypto-stocks-returns).\n\n![The Block Research](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/6053817295947631c6e37e1b\\_19.png)\n\nWhile a recent wave of approvals for bitcoin exchange-traded funds in Canada may suggest a [US bitcoin ETF could be in the cards](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/daily/98098/canada-bitcoin-etf-us-2021) over the next twelve months, it certainly won't be available when Coinbase lists in the coming weeks. Therefore, Coinbase enters the market as arguably the best pure-play way to gain exposure on the entire crypto asset market, outside of directly holding coins.\n\n\nSo how big is the addressable market for the crypto economy? That's the [$100 billion](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/crypto-markets/public-companies/coinbase-pre-ipo-stock-price) question for Coinbase. At this point, it may be undefined.\n\n\nCoinbase suggests as much in its S-1:\n\n\n> Crypto has the potential to be as revolutionary and widely adopted as the internet. The unique properties of crypto assets naturally position them as **digital alternatives to store of value** analogs such as gold, enable the **creation of an internet-based financial system**, and **provide a development platform for applications that are unimaginable today**. These markets and asset classes collectively represent hundreds of trillions of dollars of value today.\n>\n\nRegardless of the size of the market opportunity, the Coinbase listing should reset the entire public and private market crypto landscape by bringing in more capital and pulling up private crypto market valuations for others engaged in the company's core business lines. It will also serve as a broader stamp of validation for the industry.\n\n\n## Product\n\nCoinbase's product suite serves three primary stakeholders: retail investors, institutional investors, and ecosystem partners. We'll discuss the products geared toward each below.\n\n\n### **Retail** \n\n#### **Coinbase Exchange**\n\nThe on and off-ramp for those dipping a toe into crypto, this is Coinbase's primary offering. With both a mobile and a web presence, Exchange onboards users into cryptocurrency, enabling purchases and payouts via ACH, wire, credit, and debit in over 40 countries. With just a few clicks of a button or swipes of a thumb, consumers can purchase over 45 cryptocurrencies, with some variation between regions. The product also enables exchange between crypto-assets in over 100 countries (no deposit of fiat currency required).\n\n![Coinbase's S-1](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/605381c127b68b8b71c36801\\_5.png)\n\nWith a dead-simple user interface, this product is geared towards crypto newcomers rather than sophisticated investors. Its relatively high fees also mean it is suited to long-term holders (or rather HODLers) versus active traders. When users buy cryptocurrency through this platform, assets are deposited directly into the users' Coinbase Wallets.\n\n![Coinbase's S-1](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/605381ae5bfbebba16fe7af6\\_9.png)\n\n#### **Coinbase Wallet**\n\nCoinbase Wallet is a standalone app that allows users to store crypto and interact with the decentralized web, including storing and displaying NFTs, participating in airdrops, using dApps, and sending crypto around the world. Users don't need a Coinbase account to use Coinbase Wallet. Notably, users cannot link their wallet to a bank account to purchase coins with fiat — Coinbase confines that activity to its exchange product. For security, private keys are generated directly on the user's device instead of being stored by Coinbase.\n\n\n#### **Coinbase Pro**\n\nWith lower fees than Coinbase Exchange, an open API for building trading algorithms, and insurance for assets stored on the platform, Pro is Coinbase's play to capture serious retail traders. Coinbase leans on its perceived legitimacy to exert pricing power. While fees on Pro start at 0.5% for both makers and takers (versus Exchange's 1.49%), maker fees among competitors Binance, Kraken, Huobi, and Uniswap top out at 0.1%, 0.16%, 0.2%, and 0.3%.\n\n#### **Coinbase Save**\n\nCoinbase lets users earn interest on their token holdings in two ways: First, from their USDC and Dai held in Coinbase. USDC, issued by Circle, is backed 1:1 with USD, which Coinbase earns interest for holding, sharing a percentage of this interest with the user. Dai rewards are issued daily to users' wallets by the MakerDAO network, with Coinbase taking a commission on each payout. Coinbase also allows users to participate in staking protocols and earn interest on related token holdings.\n\n\n#### **Coinbase Stake**\n\nAs noted, participating in proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols is one way users can benefit from Coinbase's custody. In PoS networks, users can delegate a portion of their token holdings to stake, securing the network. In exchange, users receive additional tokens as interest, with Coinbase taking a commission. A subsidiary benefit is that many proof-of-stake protocols also use staking as a governance mechanism. By making staking easier, Coinbase also makes it more straightforward to vote on protocol referendums. \n\n![Coinbase's S-1](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/605381e349425482596a521b\\_11.png)\n\nIn the S-1, Coinbase announced its intention to offer a third way for users to earn passive interest by lending out their token holdings on longer-term investments.\n\n\n#### **Coinbase Card**\n\nA relatively small part of the Coinbase empire, Card lets users spend their crypto in the real world. Currently only available in the UK and parts of Europe, this debit card issued in partnership with Visa is funded by the assets in the user's Coinbase account. It's interesting so far as it represents an attempt to bridge the gap between crypto assets' value and their paltry use as a method of payment.\n\n\n### **Institutional**\n\n#### **Coinbase Custody**\n\nLosing an equity asset is almost unthinkable. There's a centralized party, either your brokerage, transfer agent or the company itself, keeping record of who owns what. But in crypto, tokens function as bearer assets (i.e., the burden of proof for ownership is just...ownership), which makes secure storage a huge deal.\n\nThis is precisely what Coinbase Custody purports to solve, offering permissioned asset governance, digital key management, physical security, and consistent, institutional-grade audits of each. This is a critical function for an institutional investor and represents a significant selling point for the platform.\n\n\n#### **Coinbase Prime**\n\nIn yet another textured pun, the name of Coinbase's prime brokerage platform is Coinbase Prime. Essentially, it's Coinbase Pro for institutions, boasting the extra features institutions need to legally and comfortably trade digital currency. That includes permissioned withdrawals, stress-tested cold storage, an OTC desk, and the white-glove service hedge funds, family offices, and corporate treasuries expect.\n\n#### **Bison Trails**\n\nIf Prime is Coinbase's institutional trading offering, Bison Trails may become its corollary for staking. Acquired for an undisclosed amount, Bison Trails is a node infrastructure provider that allows anyone to spin up a blockchain node and participate in a network. This is significantly simpler than the alternative of hosting and managing nodes yourself. As many blockchain projects move to proof-of-stake, large token holders (like Coinbase's institutional customers) become financially incentivized to run their own nodes, and Bison Trails positions Coinbase to offer these clients a turnkey service. \n\n### **Ecosystem partners**\n\n#### **Coinbase Commerce**\n\nCoinbase Commerce is a platform that enables merchants to accept cryptocurrency as payment. Coinbase provides APIs, invoicing capabilities, webhooks for charges, and hosted checkout pages to over 8,000 merchants worldwide. Coinbase Commerce makes it quick, easy, and free for merchants to accept crypto.\n\n\n#### **Coinbase Earn**\n\nCoinbase Earn is an educational platform within Coinbase's retail offering. Individuals that complete short cryptocurrency lessons are rewarded with actual tokens. For example, in exchange for taking a mini-course on Numeraire, users receive $3 worth of NMR tokens. Coinbase earns a commission on the assets it distributes.\n\n![Coinbase.com](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/605381f89fa00385754118fa\\_13.png)\n\nWhile this might look like a perk for users, it's really a way for Coinbase to provide distribution services to cryptocurrencies themselves. While this is a negligible part of the business today, it's interesting to imagine what it might become. With Coinbase's stellar reputation and impressive reach, new crypto projects will presumably be willing to pay a high price for such targeted, thoughtful promotion. In that respect, Earn may come to look more like an advertising platform than an educational one.\n\n\n#### **Rosetta**\n\nRosetta is an open standard maintained by Coinbase designed to help cryptocurrency protocol developers develop, maintain, build, and integrate blockchain architectures more easily. It's a way for Coinbase to build relationships and goodwill with developers while also driving the ecosystem forward.\n\n\n#### **WalletLink**\n\nWalletLink is an API that enables developers of cryptocurrency-oriented applications (often referred to as decentralized apps or \"dApps\") to connect to and accept payments from mobile crypto wallets.\n\n\nTaken together, Coinbase's product suite is remarkably comprehensive and thoughtful. The company has constructed an impressively layered product, simple enough for a first-timer to use and enjoy but sufficiently powerful to serve large financial institutions and sophisticated technologists. Given the crypto ecosystem's fractal nature — each opportunity opens the door to another and another — building coherent products can be tricky. What's most striking about Coinbase's sprawl is that it seems as ambitious and meticulously planned as a Baron Haussman boulevard. It gives the company the latitude to move in any number of directions from a strong base.\n\nIn time, we should expect expansion on all three fronts, with an interest-earning consumer account seemingly next on the agenda.\n\n## Business model\n\nCrypto is a complicated space. Not only is there a profoundly technical element that is hard for many to grasp, but interacting with the ecosystem can be both maddening and terrifying. Where should you store your bitcoin? How do you know it won't get lost in the transfer? What should you do with the 64-character private key that secures your assets?\n\n\nAt its core, Coinbase sells trust. Trust that everything that could go wrong in crypto, won’t.\n\n\nMore explicitly, Coinbase earns revenue in two primary ways:\n\n\n1.  Transaction revenue from retail and institutional exchanges. Most of this comes in the form of bid-offer spread on trades and other fees like funding or withdrawing from a cash account.\n2.  Subscription and services revenue from custody and staking services.\n\n\nWhile we'll dig into the specifics in greater detail under \"Financial highlights,\" it's worth noting that most of Coinbase's revenue comes from transactions (85%) and that the majority of *that* revenue comes from retail investors. Institutional transaction revenue totaled just $55.9 million, a little more than 5%. Intriguingly institutional clients contributed most trading *volume *to the platform, driving 64%, up 86% year-over-year (YoY) \n\n\nThe upshot of this information is that though Coinbase has done an excellent job building and growing an institutional business, its balance sheet shows it is fundamentally consumer-driven. \n\nThat raises a few questions about how this approach may fare over the coming months and years.\n\n\nFirst of all, Coinbase may prove to be remarkably sensitive to the movement of crypto-assets. While a more institutionally-focused business might see some insulation from gut-wrenching price swings, retail investors usually don't have the luxury of patience. If crypto cools as it did in 2018 with retail investors beating a retreat, Coinbase's revenues will suffer.\n\n\nSecondly, the centrality of transaction revenue opens up Coinbase to competitive pressure. As noted earlier, other exchanges provide similar services but take a slimmer cut. That's without mentioning protocols like Uniswap that allow for decentralized trading. Will Coinbase need to lower its fee structure to compete? As it stands, any adjustment here would represent neutering the business's primary source of revenue. Over time, as Coinbase builds up other revenue lines, we may see more flexibility on this front.\n\n\n## Management team\n\nThere's irony in Coinbase's direct listing; one of the highest-profile enablers of decentralized finance is subtly succumbing to the needs of a traditional finance world by going public on an old-school equities exchange. Yet, this juxtaposition is familiar to Coinbase — it has always served as the connection between a brave new financial movement and traditional finance. A bridge from old to new.\n\n\nCoinbase’s management team is a reflection of the dual personality, drawing from financial services and technology backgrounds.\n\n![The Org](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/605382129f41df0d4cc1c2de\\_14.png)\n\nCritical team members include:\n\n*   **Emilie Choi, President and COO**. Before serving as COO, Choi was VP of Business and Data and had previously been the Head of Corporate Development at LinkedIn for eight years. Before that, Emilie worked at Yahoo and in investment banking. The combination of finance and tech growth is particularly well-suited to Coinbase's business. \n*   **Surojit Chatterjee, CPO**. Before joining Coinbase, Chatterjee was VP of Product Management for Google Shopping and Head of Product at Flipkart. He also has a background at IBM, Oracle, and Symantec, suggesting an enterprise technology understanding and an appreciation for B2C user acquisition.\n*   **Alesia Haas, CFO**. Haas was formerly CFO of Oz Management, a global asset management firm. She served the same role at OneWest Bank, up to the company's acquisition by CIT Group. She boasts board experience — she serves on ANGI's board now and previously did so on Sears's. \n*   **Paul Grewal, CLO**. Coinbase operates in a complex regulatory atmosphere — good thing they have Grewal, who put out fires at Facebook for four years, serving as Vice President and Deputy General Counsel. Before entering the tech sector, Grewal was a Magistrate Judge in California.\n\n\nBeyond these employee directors, Coinbase boasts an envy-inspiring bench. Along with founder Ehrsam, now managing crypto-focused firm Paradigm, Coinbase can call on VC's Splash Brothers Marc Andreessen and Fred Wilson. Kathryn Haun, a General Partner at a16z and lecturer at Stanford Law, Kelly Kramer, a former Cisco EVP and current Snowflake board member, and Gokul Rajaram, previously on DoorDash's executive team, fill out the impressive roster.\n\n\nThe team is headed, of course, by Brian Armstrong. We’ll discuss the effect of Armstrong’s leadership from a cultural perspective shortly, but at first glance, he appears to be well-liked. On [Comparably](https://www.comparably.com/companies/coinbase/ceo-rating), Armstrong receives a 99/100 rating, besting peers like Snowflake's Frank Slootman (89), Stripe's Patrick Collison (87), and Shopify's Tobi Lutke (85), all strong leaders.\n\n\nThe Coinbase chief is well-compensated for his efforts. Armstrong took home a hefty $60 million in 2020, of which $57 million came in the form of options awards.\n\n![Coinbase's S-1](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/6053835635a5312595fea555\\_pg%2016%20arm.png)\n\nThe S-1 is notably sparse on other details of his pay package, merely noting that his performance thresholds are \"extremely rigorous\" and in alignment with shareholder expectation. Ultimately, Armstrong will have 22% voting power and stands to materialize billions in enterprise value upon the direct listing. Such levels of control and wealth can be both empowering, allowing management to take materially risky bets, as well as potentially distracting. What will the company do with such full coffers, and will management remain equally hungry now they've gotten their payday? With Coinbase hammering home its commitment to economic empowerment throughout the S-1, it feels like the company is still in its early days.\n\n\n## Culture\n\n\"I've been the mayor of a California town, but I've never seen a place as political as Coinbase.”\n\n\nThat description came from Coinbase’s first Chief Legal Officer Mike Lempres, who once served as mayor of Atherton. It’s an ironic appraisal of a company that recently fought hard to separate itself from the country’s most pressing political conversations.\n\nIn September, Armstrong published a Medium post declaring Coinbase would not participate in “broader societal issues,” a directive perceived as unfriendly to 2020’s racial justice movements. Sixty employees left the company as a result.\n\nRather than an isolated incident, Armstrong’s critics will note the unforced error represents part of a broader pattern of tone deafness. Most at home digging into the codebase with his headphones on, Armstrong is often described as a passive, introverted leader, myopically focused on the core functions of the business. That style has occasionally led Coinbase astray, creating a divisive and controversial environment, at times.\n\nTwo particularly notable episodes:\n\n1.  **The turf war between Balaji Srinivasan and Asiff Hirji**. To bring Srinivasan aboard, Coinbase acquired his company, Earn, for $120 million. (Some dispute these figures). In his new role as CTO, Srinivasan pushed for Coinbase to add new currencies in a bid to compete with Binance. This hard-charging style clashed with COO Asiff Hirji who came from a more traditional financial background and believed Coinbase’s future lay in playing nice with large enterprises. With Armstrong unable or unwilling to quell open hostilities between the two executives, a power struggle is said to have occurred, tanking employee morale and precipitating the departure of several company stalwarts. Srinivasan left after a year; Hirji followed shortly afterward. \n2.  **The acquisition of Neutrino**. Looking to bolster its analytical capabilities, Coinbase acquired the Milanese company in 2019. In doing so, Armstrong and other executives were apparently willing to overlook the fact that Neutrino's founders also ran HackingTeam, a black hat surveillance company that counted repressive governments as clients, including the Saudi intelligence group that murdered Jamal Khashoggi. Mexican drug cartels also enjoyed use of the service to intimidate and threaten journalists. In an apologetic blog post announcing the dismissal of the HackingTeam, Armstrong wrote: \"Bitcoin — and crypto more generally — is about the rights of the individual and about the technological protection of civil liberties.\" Hmmm.\n\nFor all Coinbase’s outward reserve, life behind the scenes has been occasionally chaotic. Armstrong apologists will hope that the relatively young executive will learn from such mistakes, though it may not matter much. Despite the issues mentioned, Coinbase has thrived. With much of the company's performance tied to exogenous factors like the rise of the crypto asset class, Coinbase may continue to soar even as dissent breeds.\n\n## Investors\n\nIf you've followed the flurry of crypto financings over the last five years, it should come as no surprise two of Coinbase's largest shareholders are among the most prolific investors in the space: [Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/) and [Union Square Ventures](https://www.usv.com/).\n\nThe duo has teamed up multiple times to support companies in the space, including [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/) (the team behind [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) and [NBA Topshot](https://www.nbatopshot.com/)), [Filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/about-filecoin/what-is-filecoin/), [OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org/), and crypto hedge funds [Polychain](https://polychain.capital/), [Blocktower](https://www.blocktower.com/), and [MetaStable](https://metastablecapital.com/).\n\nCoinbase was USV's [first investment](https://www.usv.com/writing/2013/05/coinbase/) in crypto when it led the company's Series A in May 2013, with a16z helming the Series B six months later.\n\nOther big winners include fintech investors Ribbit Capital, late-stage generalists Tiger Global, the crypto-focused Paradigm, and basically anyone who ever made it onto the cap table, including Y Combinator, who incubated the company.  \n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/6053822c1c18ee25b470ddc0\\_15.png)\n\nAfter Coinbase released its S-1, TechCrunch [raised questions](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/usv-has-been-aggressively-selling-off-shares-in-coinbase-in-run-up-to-ipo/#:~:text=Since%20late%202019%2C%20the%20firm,on%20Coinbase%27s%20disclosed%20share%20count.) about secondary transactions showing USV and Ribbit sold shares leading up to the public offering. While this might have looked like an adverse signal from insiders, it is very much standard practice for many venture firms. Later in the same piece, the author noted it is USV's [modus operandi](https://avc.com/2018/01/taking-money-off-the-table/) to sell a portion of returns in the run-up to public financings, having done so with Twitter, Zynga, LendingClub, MongoDB, and others. For comparison, USV has sold 28% of its Coinbase holdings; it sold 30% of its Twitter stake before the 2013 IPO.\n\nProving the wisdom of \"doubling-down on your winners,\" buyers of those shares included a16z and Paradigm. Both firms will be happy to own a little extra $COIN come listing day.\n\n\n## Financial highlights\n\nBrian Armstrong gives it to us straight:\n\n\n> You can expect volatility in our financials, given the price cycles of the cryptocurrency industry.\n>\n\nAs noted, the critical driver in Coinbase's financials is the trading volume it facilitates on behalf of clients. Over the past few years, the correlation between revenue growth and Bitcoin price has been around 70%. The volatility of crypto assets and Coinbase's monthly transacting users are also correlated, though this relationship appears to be weakening as the company expands its business.\n\n![Coinbase's S-1](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/60538245a8d43f3b1f8c168a\\_1.png)\n\nIn 2020, Coinbase did $193 billion of volume. In Q1, the company is already tracking way above that as the customer base has grown and bitcoin's price has increased. One metric to keep an eye on is the trading *velocity* within crypto markets. Over the past several years, annual trading volume has been roughly 8x the market cap of cryptocurrencies. Sometimes it's higher — like in 2017 and the first quarter of 2021 — and sometimes it's lower, but it provides a baseline of the multiplier between underlying asset values and the trading volume that sits on top.\n\n\nIn both 2019 and 2020, Coinbase earned an average 0.57% fee rate on trading. However, this masks divergent trends. Institutional fees scale down based on 30-day trading volume; in 2020, they averaged 0.05% (down from 0.07% in 2019). Retail fees, by contrast, are much higher. In 2020 they averaged 1.42%, up from 1.27% in 2019. The increase in retail fees didn't come through at the headline level, though, because of a mix shift. While in 2019, higher fee retail volumes made up 43% of total trading, by 2020, they decreased to 38%.\n\n\nAlthough transaction-related revenues make up the vast majority of Coinbase revenue (86% in 2020), there are other sources. In 2020 custodial fees made up just 1% of group revenues, but the assets Coinbase holds on behalf of clients is growing. Lending is another opportunity where the contribution is relatively small but there's considerable upside. Coinbase can replicate the success of retail brokers in equity markets, making margin loans against holdings. These additional revenue sources — what Coinbase calls its subscription and services revenue — are a function of assets held on the platform, which were $90.3 billion in 2020, up over 5x from the prior year. (By comparison, trading volume was up over 2x).\n\n\nIn addition to the services above, Coinbase retains a portfolio of crypto assets to meet client orders under certain conditions. The sale of these assets is recognized in the 'other revenue' line; the associated cost is included in expenses. In 2020, Coinbase booked $134 million of crypto-asset sales revenue (10% of total revenue), but $132 million of that was reversed in expenses as the cost of those assets. \n\n![Coinbase's S-1](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/605382579fa0031d94411d50\\_4.png)\n\nCoinbase's expenses are mainly independent of revenue, leading to high operating leverage. Transaction expenses declined from 18% of transaction revenues to 10% of transaction revenues between 2019 and 2020, as scale benefits increased. The rest of the expense base consists of technology and development and general and administrative costs. There is one accounting wrinkle in the expense line – the company books realized gains and losses on the sale of crypto assets there, but in 2020 that was only $24 million (3% of reported expenses).\n\n\nCoinbase has developed such scale in its trading business that its margins are very high. In 2020 it reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 41%. Stripping out the realized gains the company books on its crypto holdings, the margin drops to 39% but compared with other fintech companies, that's still quite elevated.\n\n![Data from Coinbase S-1, company filings](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/6053826e39942a350412e89a\\_3.png)\n\nSquare and Paypal, for example, have EBITDA margins of 5% and 29%, respectively. Indeed, the margin is closer to an established exchange: CME (where Bitcoin derivatives trade) operates on an EBITDA margin of 65%.   \n\n![Data from Coinbase S-1](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/605382834f7d107abeec5697\\_2.png)\n\n## Competition\n\nCoinbase's competitive set is more fluid than most, accelerated by the dynamism of the crypto industry. We'll dig into four critical categories:\n\n1.  Direct competition\n2.  Traditional finance and fintech\n3.  Institutional trading firms\n4.  DeFi\n\n### **Direct competition**\n\nThere is only one place to start: Binance. Founded relatively recently in 2017 by a Chinese developer called Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Binance is likely the fastest-ever profitable company to achieve unicorn status, having received a valuation of almost $2 billion after just six months of operating. Binance attained these heights by executing aggressively on several fronts: expanding geographically, adding to its listing of coins and tokens, and experimenting with new products, including its own decentralized exchange and exchange token.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, Coinbase saw $32 billion in retail volume and $57 billion in institutional flow. For comparison, Binance reportedly sees ~$30 billion across its exchanges in a *single day*.\n\nThat may partially be because Binance's trading fees are highly competitive, coming in at 0.10% versus Coinbase's 3.99% and Coinbase Pro's ~0.50%. Binance also does not restrict users to a maximum daily trading amount.\n\nWhile Coinbase supports fiat conversion from select countries and select currencies, Binance supports deposits of 15 different fiat currencies without leaving the platform and an even broader range through connecting partners. It is not just on the fiat leg that Binance is more comprehensive. Binance offers markets in over 150 different cryptocurrencies, while Coinbase supports fewer than 50.\n\nWhile Coinbase is available globally, most activity, volume, and revenue is centered in the United States and the West. Other geographies have seen other exchanges emerge as the dominant players. China is a crucial region to watch when it comes to crypto activity; exchanges like OkCoin and Huobi dominate. Korea, another major crypto market, sees most of its retail volume happen on Upbit and Bithumb. Other prominent trading venues in Asia include KuCoin and OKEx. Latin America has similar dynamics, with volume routed to local exchanges like Bitso. Although cryptocurrency itself can claim to be truly global, Coinbase can't quite say the same.\n\nEven in the United States, Coinbase is far from the only game in town. Gemini, the Winklevoss twins' exchange, provides a more buttoned-up retail product than Coinbase, geared toward the Wall Street set. It offers a narrower selection of coins but supports features like holding assets in trust. Other exchanges that are notably active in the US include Paxos, Kraken, Bitfinex, and Bittrex.\n\nFinally, many direct competitors support different features and functionality from Coinbase. While Coinbase's product appeals to the newcomer, other exchanges cater to advanced users. Binance and Bitmex offer leverage and derivatives, while platforms like LocalBitcoins and Paxful support anonymous, non-custodial options for buying and selling bitcoin.\n\nIn a way, it is a credit to Coinbase that it has not tried to chase all of these strategies, focusing on its core competency of acting as the friendly on-ramp for those who want a dead simple and inclusive interface to buy, sell, and send cryptocurrency.\n\n### Traditional finance and fintech\n\nCompetitive pressure comes not just from crypto exchanges but a growing list of fintechs, neobanks, and other financial service companies looking to leverage crypto as a lever for monetization and user engagement.\n\nSquare was the first US public company to offer bitcoin buying, selling, and withdrawal, doing so through its Cash App. The firm has demonstrated that a small spread on crypto purchase offerings can have a material impact on the bottom line. Square has processed more than $5 billion worth of bitcoin volume in three years; 85% arrived in the last three quarters of 2020. That netted Square nearly $100 million in gross profit for the year, roughly 5% of the company's total. Square also [reported](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/95882/square-bitcoin-2020-cash-app-results) more than 3 million people purchased or sold bitcoin via Cash App in 2020, with a million more using the service for the first time in January (~33% MoM growth).\n\n\nDorsey's day job is not the only beneficiary. Zabo — an API for connecting to any crypto exchange, wallet, or protocol — released a [report](https://cdn.zabo.com/reports/Fintech_Adoption_of_Crypto_Zabo_July2020.pdf) in July illustrating fintechs that offered crypto purchase services outperformed comparable peers in terms of user acquisition and valuation. The latest numbers from PayPal and Robinhood — two other high-profile financial firms to add crypto services — suggest that the impact on engagement from introducing crypto was more significant than initially expected.\n\nPayPal [noted](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/93668/paypal-crypto-business-unit-earnings-2021) that in the first-quarter it started offered crypto purchasing, customers that bought crypto opened the app roughly twice as often as before. Half of PayPal's crypto buyers opened the app each day. Meanwhile, Robinhood Crypto [reported](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/96202/robinhood-six-million-new-users-crypto) more than 2.9 million new traders arrived in both January and February. For context, that figure roughly matched Coinbase's monthly active user base in 2020. \n\n![Zabo, The Block Research](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/6053829b4f7d10a43cec5799\\_10.png)\n\nAs the line between crypto, fintech, and banking continues to [blur](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/daily/95637/bitcoin-bull-run-blurring-line-fintech-crypto), having in-app crypto functionality may soon become table stakes.\n\n\nThe problem for established banks and even most fintechs is that their core competency usually has little to do with the sector. This has led financial service companies to consider employing [third-parties](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/daily/96950/charles-schwab-exploring-white-label-crypto-trading) to take care of the back-end technical complexity, custody, and liquidity. That allows financial institutions to reach the market more quickly with white-labeled crypto offerings.\n\n\nLast quarter, when PayPal launched its crypto purchase capabilities, it did so not by building in-house; instead, it opted to use Paxos as its third-party tech partner. Arguably, this tie-up — and a similar deal Paxos struck last year with digital banking platform Revolut — offers a first glimpse of the \"Crypto-as-a-Service\" model targeted at financial service companies.\n\n\nTraditional finance players are also getting into the white-labeled crypto services game. Last month, Visa announced it had [partnered with neobank](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/93550/visa-announces-crypto-partnership-with-neobank-focused-on-services-for-black-communities) First Boulevard to test Visa's new crypto API suite. The product enables First Boulevard customers to purchase, custody, and trade digital assets held by the federally chartered digital asset bank, [Anchorage](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/daily/97714/diogo-monica-anchorage-crypto-bank).\n\n\nFor Visa, the First Boulevard pilot may be just the beginning. At a recent Morgan Stanley TMT conference, Visa EVP Oliver Jenkyn stated that one of the core business opportunities the company sees within crypto is by providing APIs. We should expect the processing firm to roll out capabilities to other partners in the future.\n\n\nAs these white-labeled services hit the market, the barrier for financial institutions to play in the crypto realm will only lower. In time, many traditional institutions and fintechs may become *de facto* \"crypto companies.\"\n\n\n### **Institutional trading firms**\n\nBeyond its core retail offerings, Coinbase faces growing competition for institutional deposits and trading volume.\n\n\nThe market for institutional crypto offerings is still maturing. To date, it has focused mainly on niche service offerings, including OTC, liquidity providers/aggregators, custody and settlement solutions, intelligent order routing, execution businesses, clearing solutions, trade messengers, and algorithmic trading platforms. As a result, the crypto market structure is highly fragmented, with liquidity and services fractured across various offerings worldwide.\n\n\nFor years, crypto optimists have argued institutional adoption of bitcoin is \"right around the corner.\" One of the main impediments has been the dearth of full suite offerings that look and feel similar to what investors use for other asset classes.\n\n\nRecognizing this need, the past year has seen several industry players move to build one-stop shops for crypto spot and derivatives trading aggregation, margin extension, custody services, and capital introduction. This is akin to the prime brokerage services available at today's investment banks.\n\n\nCoinbase Prime — which spans trade execution, data analytics, custody, and access to OTC trading desk services — aims to do just that. Prime will not win the market unmolested, though. Though early, companies like [Genesis](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/92569/genesis-global-trading-q4-crypto-loans-trades) have demonstrated the power of a unified bundled prime model with similar offerings. In 2020, [Genesis traded](https://info.genesistrading.com/hubfs/Genesis%20-%20Quarterly%20Reports/Genesis%20Q4%20Report.pdf?utm_campaign=Marketing%20Collateral\\&utm_source=email\\&utm_term=Q4%202020%20Report\\&utm_content=Q4%20Report) $20 billion worth of spot crypto and ~$6 billion in derivative volume on behalf of clients while also originating over $19 billion in loans.\n\n\nMore recently, competitors like [NYDIG](https://nydig.com/) have also ramped up efforts to compete in this market, onboarding clients such as insurance firm MassMutual. The company went on to purchase [$100 million worth of bitcoin](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/87378/massmutual-bitcoin-insurance-purchase). Earlier this year, NYDIG founder and chairman Ross Stevens predicted that the platform would surpass [$25 billion in AUM](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/93655/nydig-bitcoin-25-billion-aum-2021) by the end of 2021, thanks to a deep pipeline of soon-to-be onboarded accounts.\n\n\nCoinbase's execution in this space is nothing to sniff at, though. The company grew institutional accounts by 7x from 4Q17 to 4Q20. The total value of assets on the institutional platform has grown from $6.5 billion in 4Q19 to $44.8 billion as of 2020 year-end (~590% YoY growth vs. 340% YoY increase in the price of bitcoin and a 275% increase YoY in Galaxy Bloomberg Crypto Index).\n\n\nCoinbase plans to expand its institutional customer coverage team to educate hedge funds, corporate treasurers, family offices, and other institutions about the crypto economy and the platform in 2021.\n\n\nThrough Coinbase Prime, the company has also facilitated some of the most significant corporate bitcoin transactions, including Tesla's $1.5 billion bitcoin purchase, MicroStrategy's initial $250 million bitcoin purchase (and subsequent purchases), and One River's buy for its $1 billion fund.\n\n\nUltimately, while the market for servicing institutional crypto services is still small — and public data from different providers is sparse — Coinbase will need to expand its institutional platform to compete with emerging players and diversify away from transactional trading revenue.\n\n\n### DeFi\n\nIt's not just corporates that carry competitive risks for Coinbase. An emerging financial ecosystem leverages platforms like Ethereum to enable decentralized financial services. These projects rely on internet communities rather than traditional middle-men, better embodying the crypto movement's spirit.\n\n\nMore broadly known as \"Decentralized Finance\" or DeFi, this ecosystem enabled more than [$100 billion worth of spot trading volumes](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/dex-non-custodial) in 2021, capturing over [$50+ billion worth of crypto collateral](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/total-value-locked-tvl/total-value-locked-by-category). The movement is on pace to facilitate trillions of [dollar-denominated value flow](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins/adjusted-on-chain-volume-of-stablecoins-monthly) across public blockchains this year, among other financial applications.\n\n\nRemarkably, most of the infrastructure powering the DeFi ecosystem was built in the past twelve months. These protocols have generated more than $350 million in revenue for users and token holders in 2021 — and are entirely outside the rails of traditional crypto exchanges like Coinbase.\n\n\nOne of the more significant Defi milestones in 2020 was when the decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap briefly surpassed Coinbase exchange volumes over a rolling 7-day window in September and October. That represented a landmark moment for a DEX. In September 2020, DEX volumes compared with centralized exchange volumes peaked at nearly 20% share (it currently sits at [~7%](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/dex-non-custodial/dex-to-cex-spot-trade-volume)).\n\n\nWhile Coinbase volumes are now well above Uniswap's, it's worth noting that Uniswap's 7-day rolling average trading volumes are running at a much higher clip in 2021 than Coinbase generated during the past two years.\n\n\nThe fact that the DeFi space is so new — and experiencing such rapid growth on top of experimental and changing tech — makes it hard to effectively forecast how it might compete against exchanges such as Coinbase over the long-run.\n\n\nTo date, we've seen Coinbase lose flow to DeFi when users want to explore assets outside Coinbase's limited listings, try their hand at blockchain-native yield opportunities, or pursue other exotic speculative products.\n\n\nCoinbase may yet find a way to play nice with DeFi. Since its inception, Coinbase's primary position in the industry has been that of an aggregator: accumulating users with its accessible product, then selling more advanced offerings over time. That approach could work here, too, with Coinbase removing the technical complexity of interacting with DeFi protocols and passing on yield opportunities to its user base. In such a scenario, Coinbase would maintain its position as a dominant aggregator even as DeFi expands.\n\n\nGiven that Coinbase's valuation is predicated on its ability to provide exposure to the most vital elements of the entire crypto-economy, we imagine Armstrong is watching the rise of DeFi closely.\n\n\nThe S-1 states that ~11% of the crypto market's total value resides on Coinbase's platform as of 2020 year-end.\n\n![Coinbase S-1](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/605382ce274af433fa7bfa9a\\_7.png)\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Coinbase will be able to effectively hold that market share among a growing list of competitors that spans legacy crypto exchanges, traditional financial services entrants, trading firms, and a rapidly evolving decentralized finance ecosystem. Of course, the effects of an expanding pie — the secular ascent of crypto — may offset broader competitive pressures.\n\n\n## Regulation\n\nFor companies building in the crypto industry, having a regulatory strategy has always been critical. Governing bodies have taken a keen interest in the space and often don't enter the sector with the most favorable preconceptions. That is, in part, due to the early stories that brought bitcoin into mainstream consciousness — namely, the infamous Silk Road case, in which the cryptocurrency was used to purchase all manner of illegal paraphernalia. The token sale mania of 2017 (remember ICOs?) contributed to similarly negative sentiment, reasonably attracting global regulators' ire. Today, many legal questions remain unanswered. \n\nCoinbase's current dominance is in no small part thanks to the regulatory moat built up over recent years. Since 2015, the company has made efforts to beef up its legal and regulatory team and act in strict compliance with regulations worldwide. That brought talent like Brian Brooks to the startup — Coinbase's former Chief Legal Officer and future Acting Comptroller of the Currency at the OCC — as well as opening the door for Coinbase to operate around the world.\n\n\nIn addition to tightening up its licensing and complying with the same set of regulations that govern traditional financial institutions, Coinbase has, in recent years, doubled down on its investment in the Coinbase Custody offering. Wooing institutional clients to that product has required Coinbase to act with a discipline and conservatism concerning regulation that competitors — Binance, in particular — have not.\n\n\nRegardless, Coinbase will likely continue to endure uncertainty around industry-wide legal questions.\n\n\nIndeed, the company faced upheaval as recently as December 2020. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau in the US Treasury, proposed a rule requiring exchanges and money processing firms to collect personal information from the owners of self-custodied wallets transferred or received cryptocurrencies from Coinbase. Those users also would have to report certain transactions to the federal government. Luckily for Coinbase, the rule was never adopted, but it would have caused significant disruption for the company and posed meaningful questions about what implementation would have involved. As global regulations continue to take shape, Coinbase will need to continue to invest in regulatory compliance, in addition to helping set new industry standards.\n\n\n## Valuation\n\nWhispers peg Coinbase's valuation at just over $100 billion.\n\nThat's an eye-opening figure, made even more startling in comparison. Is Coinbase really as valuable as a financial stalwart like Goldman Sachs? Should it be pegged at 2-3x of Robinhood, or 7x what Morgan Stanley paid to acquire E-Trade 13 months ago?\n\nAs always, the answer is a matter of perspective, with bears pointing to the remarkable multiples Coinbase is commanding, while bulls highlight recent traction and note the enormous market upside and impressive execution to date.\n\nAs we've noted previously, Coinbase primarily makes money via transactional revenue. During 2020, $COIN earned $1.09 billion in transactions on $193 billion in trading volume, a 56bps take rate. If we value Coinbase based on 2020 financials alone, a $100 billion looks hard to justify. Total net revenue for 2020 was ~$1.14 billion, implying an unattractive ~77x EV / Revenue multiple.\n\nIn crypto's spirit of transparency and openness, exchanges in the space share more free public information than traditional players. While Q1 is not quite over, Coinbase volumes are tracked daily, making it easy to extrapolate revenue given its direct correlation with volume. Per CryptoCompare, a crypto asset data company, Coinbase hosted ~$263 billion in volume this quarter (as of March 10th), a prorated ~$342 billion in volume for the entire quarter. Already, that figure represents almost 2x Coinbase's 2020 volume, which stood at $193 billion. It has been a year-making quarter, with upside to come over the next nine months.\n\n\nApplying 2020's annual take rate of 56bps on that $342 billion yields $1.9 billion in revenue for Coinbase in Q1 alone, approximately $8 billion annualized. Given its 25% net income margin profile and position as a unique access point for cryptocurrency investors, attaching a relatively conservative 10-12x multiple on an $8 billion annual revenue gets us in the ballpark of $100 billion. Suddenly, Coinbase's valuation looks more reasonable.\n\nLooking ahead, Coinbase appears uniquely well-positioned to capitalize on any further growth in the crypto space. As a services business, it should benefit from continued volatility and growth in the volume of crypto transactions. Many investors may feel that Coinbase's service model is more durable and defensible than the cryptocurrencies themselves.\n\nUltimately, we expect Coinbase to attract significant interest from both traditional institutional and individual investors, with the \"Wen Moon\" ethos of crypto potentially drawing in the Wall Street Bets crew. As the first and only cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase is already a historic business; its valuation is likely to reflect that.\n\n\n## Future growth\n\nGiven the development speed in the crypto space, it feels only right to spend some time thinking about where Coinbase might go next. Should the company expand internationally? Is it the right move to add traditional financial services or double down on crypto?\n\n\nEven more than most high-growth tech companies, Coinbase may look very different five years from now.\n\n\n### International expansion\n\nCoinbase is available in more than 100 countries but that doesn't mean it has a strong foothold in each of them. International expansion represents a significant opportunity for the company. As noted previously, different regions are dominated by other exchanges, with players like Bitso owning much of LatAm, while Upbit, Bithumb, CoinHako operate in Asia.\n\n\nShould Coinbase focus on winning over these regions? The company might consider expanding its footprint itself, though an acquisition might make more sense. With Coinbase's bank balance in the green, it may be in a solid position to begin more aggressive M\\&A. On the other hand, just as Coinbase has prospered during bitcoin's latest bull run, other exchanges are likely to be in the same position, resulting in a premium. As the biggest company in the space, Coinbase has the luxury of waiting, perhaps pouncing during leaner times.\n\n\n### Financial product expansion\n\nThough slow to add currencies, Coinbase has been relatively adventurous in building out its product suite. Which direction will the company want to head in next?\n\n\nMoving into traditional financial services is one option. With 43 million retail brokerage customers, Coinbase has more users than Schwab or Fidelity. That might position them to offer conventional retail services, competing with Robinhood, Square's Cash App, and incumbents like Schwab, Fidelity, and Interactive Brokers.\n\nA bolder move would be an acquisition. If Coinbase ended up trading in public markets at $100 billion, it would have a market cap higher than all US exchanges – CME, ICE, Nasdaq, and CBOE. While Coinbase boasts a higher valuation, the company has significantly lower top-line revenues than other exchanges, except CBOE. Notably, CBOE has roughly *1/10th* of Coinbase's expected market cap.\n\n\nCoinbase could capitalize by acquiring an incumbent exchange for Coinbase equity. Trading away some dilution, Coinbase would get several licenses and other products for individual and institutional investors to trade. Such a move would also be 100% accretive to Coinbase EBITDA.\n\nAnother option for Coinbase would be to embed themselves deeper into consumers' financial lives by becoming both a current account and bank. Coinbase effectively serves that purpose in the crypto economy, though making the jump to fiat would represent a significant leap.\n\n\n### **Crypto product expansion**\n\nIf Coinbase chooses to expand within crypto, a safe bet at the moment, it could experiment with greater decentralization. Specifically, the company could consider aping Binance in building out a decentralized exchange. While there's some question about how such a product would impact Coinbase's core business, it might insulate them from bottoms-up DeFi disruption. \n\nFinally, Coinbase Ventures, the company's corporate venture arm, may indicate areas of interest. Coinbase has already invested in several crypto-native protocols and infrastructure companies serving the crypto economy, including Bitso, AirTM, Dapper Labs, TaxBit, BlockFi, Arweave, OpenSea, Celo, and many others. In some instances, Coinbase has invested in a company before an eventual acquisition, as was the case with Bison Trails. Perhaps we will see more of this activity in the months ahead.\n\n\nUltimately, the direction it chooses may reveal a lot about who Coinbase is, and who they want to be.\n\n\n## Why now?\n\nIgnoring the recent swoon in high-value tech stocks, Coinbase couldn't have picked a better time to go public. Fintech is hot, crypto is hot, and mainstream investors want a piece of the action.\n\n\nCoinbase's user growth seems directly correlated to bitcoin's stock price, which recently hit (another) all-time high. With retail trading interest at a fever pitch, Coinbase can capitalize on the hype. Many bitcoin ETF's and other financial instruments that allow public market investors to tap into bitcoin as an asset class have popped up over the last few years, but why invest in those when you can buy stock in the \"NASDAQ of Crypto?\"\n\n\nNotably, Coinbase is going public via direct listing (DPO), structurally different from a traditional IPO. Direct listings allow companies to cut out underwriters (saving money on fees) and don't require the issue of new shares, which dilute shareholders.

You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. A few weeks ago I found myself sitting on my couch, chin dropped, watching the recent Billie Eilish doc and now here we are.\n\nI’m an artist, writer and strategist, in no particular order. I co-founded[ K-HOLE](http://khole.net/), a trend forecasting collective responsible for coining the naughties dominant trend—[Normcore](http://khole.net/issues/youth-mode/). Since then, I have been writing critical essays for arts publications, which have explored such themes as [The Content Industrial Complex](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/89/181611/content-industrial-complex/), [corporate LARPing](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/82/133913/on-ketamine-and-added-value/), or the [impact selfie walls have on the shaping of public space and gentrification](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/104/299339/the-wall-stays-in-the-picture-destination-murals-in-los-angeles/). Until recently, my writing did not have a centralized home—I wrote for any arts publication, cultural rag or institutional monograph that would have me. I pined for the days of K-HOLE when producing and disseminating a PDF was enough. I even considered a read-only Google Doc. Thankfully, moving forward, Mirror will house all subsequent cultural criticism.\n\n## ABOUT THE PROJECT\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/01941d12-039c-4d98-aeb8-c1318c31bba0.jpeg?height=1036&width=798)\n \nR.J. Cutler’s recent documentary, [Billie Eilish: The World’s A Little Blurry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Eilish:_The_World%27s_a_Little_Blurry) is an object lesson in affect theory. \n\nThe affective turn of the nineties posited an alternative modality to the twentieth century’s dominant linguistic mode for understanding the world around us. We do not solely process our experiences through language, but rather through psycho-physical, culturally informed responses. Emotions, vibes and whatnot are increasingly becoming the currency through which we recognize and react to the forces that shape our reality, and moreover are monetized by centralized social media platforms that extract said affective currency from users towards their own profitable ends.  Affect theory—as elucidated by critical theorists such as Eve Sedgewick, Lauren Berlant, and Brian Massumi, amongst others—has been difficult to clearly describe because of its subject being beyond our ability to root it in language. But you feel it, and maybe that’s enough. The same could be said about Billie Eilish’s music. What is the “there” there? Does it matter? Eilish’s music is more adjective than noun or verb, it’s the aura surrounding the experience—the emotional afterglow. \n\nCutler’s film takes Eilish’s music as its subject, and in a meta cinematic move, reproduces the affect of the music in the filmmaking itself. While pop-star documentaries traditionally follow the narrative of a single tour, album recording, festival or specific concert, _The World’s A Little Blurry_ nimbly moves across all of these. The timeline of the film foregoes narrative arc for a sense of immanence. We do not get the glimpses into her past, or future, but rather an overwhelming sense of present—it’s a film with no internal timeline beyond that of the film itself. Its only sense of place is the bedroom (transposed onto airplanes, cars, hotel rooms, and the stage itself), and Eilish seems to exist solely in relation to her associations and references. Pinballing in an ever-shifting matrix of meaning, a baggy t-shirt that can encompass any anchoring specificity. \n\nMy forthcoming essay aims to unpack this foggy, socked-in cloud of affect, and determine its implications for vibe-fueled economies via the lens of the following affective categories: chill, cringe, sad. I will address Eilish’s unique ability to communicate a low-vibrancy, depressed emotional register at a particularly high intensity. This analysis will be concluded with an additional prologue text that addresses how exactly these affective registers play out in the crypto and NFT economy itself. Paired with this writing, I will commission a series of animated color-field illustrations to exist as NFT’s within the essay.\n\n## WHY?\n\nWith K-HOLE, we wrote and released PDF trend forecasting reports for free. These reports were intended to move freely and reach the widest possible audience, though by not making any profit on the reports themselves, we all had to maintain day jobs or view the reports as loss leaders for additional consulting work. In my personal practice, long form writing has always been something that I do in addition to other work. It takes a lot of time, and is never truly remunerated. Overall, writing itself is categorically underpaid and undervalued. \n\nThen there is the question of context. When I started to think about this Billie Eilish piece, it didn’t quite make sense for any of the art and cultural publications I have published with in the past. Should I leave it as the tweet thread? No, I’m not really a “hot take” kind of writer, and there’s so much more to say. Do I make it a read-only Google Doc? That’s just annoying. There has to be a better way that would afford me the time to focus, the ability to work with an editor, and think about this is an expanded multimedia piece.\n\nThat’s where Mirror came in. Mirror is a platform that allows writers to build global decentralized publications. They have tools to help writers raise money through crowdfunds and monetize their work while retaining ownership over their work. Behind the scenes, Mirror runs on smart contacts deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nAs a result, writers can raise money from anyone globally with an Ethereum address. Writers can also monetize through novel methods like NFTs which ensure writing remains a public good while still retaining value through ownership.\n\nWhy am _I_ doing this? Because I would like for this essay to be a proof of concept for how other writers in the cultural sector can be remunerated for their labor. I have seen too many friends hunt down $75 from publications to not believe that there has to be a better way. I’m not particularly interested in engaging with NFTs as an artist, but do see the potential for this technology to radically change the way that we fund and support undervalued creative labor—writing, choreography, etc.\n\n## HOW IT WORKS\n\n**How long?** The crowdfund will go until the 20 ETH cap is hit. The minimum funding goal is 10 ETH (which goes to myself, an editor and illustrator)\n\n**Rewards?** As a contributor to a crowdfund on Ethereum, you will be permanently etched in history as someone who made this project possible. In return for your ETH contribution, you will receive $MOOD tokens. Once the report is released and the NFTs are sold, their value will flow back to the Crowdfund contract, and therefore the backers. You’ll then be able to redeem your $MOOD tokens in return for a proportional share of the ETH in the contract. Yet, the main benefit is being a part of making this project possible and receiving a token that marks this patronage while also giving you ownership in the potential upside of this project.\n\n**Contribution limit?** 1 ETH.\n\n[The technical version here](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ)\n\n## THE BREAKDOWN\n\n### Research & Writing Phase\n\nWhile writing is often seen as a solitary practice, it can sometimes take a village to get a text out the door. In the past, I have had a research assistant, editor and designer work alongside me. These are resources often provided by a larger publication, though without that infrastructure I will need to work with an editor to ensure the highest quality work. \n\n### NFT Illustration\n\nAs mentioned, I’ll be working with an artist to create NFT illustrations to be included in the piece. In terms of vibe, I’m thinking of something in the vein of [Jeremy Blake’s pieces that were created for Punch Drunk Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIypELB-tSc&ab_channel=SleepyJones).\n\n### Length \n\n~6000-8000 words\n\n### Turnaround Time \n\n6-8 Weeks\n", "timestamp": 1616696051, "digest": "vbiD5sIgZaqUAuXu0P6SkvmCNOM7MtRCdqsEDyxsOXU", "contributor": "0x345122f6513329d169cFf39ACe8978EDC3942b5D"}
{"id": "8HVzsYdIViyTYqZ_2YqnyaGzqt2DLMsk_SYOg6Y5kck", "title": "NFT Value Capture Equation", "body": "Last month, I set out to explore one question: **where do NFTs capture value?**\n\nThis is not a thesis on what makes NFTs valuable, it assumes you already understand [why scarce, permanent, ownable digital content has value](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo).\n\nInstead, we’ll use this essay to explore the NFT stack, breaking down the various layers as we hone in on one in particular - curation.\n\n## Analyzing the NFT Stack\n\nNFTs flow through a number of layers from creation to collection. Baked within this stack are dozens of platforms, many of which are covered in my first Mirror post on the [NFT issuance landscape](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/PF42Z9oE_r6yhZN9jZrrseXfHaZALj9JIfMplshlgQ0).\n\n![NFT Stack](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7ae6c2ab-7632-4e6c-a2cf-490462eb4086.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nEvery NFT is issued on a blockchain through a process called minting. There are different means of minting, but the end result is creating a token that conforms to a certain NFT schema ([ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155), or [zNFT](https://github.com/ourzora/core#architecture)).\n\nOnce minted, NFTs can move seamlessly between marketplaces and applications, just like a cryptocurrency can move between exchanges and wallets. Oftentimes, decisions for what marketplace to release on are based on the structure of the NFT sale, including nuances like editions vs 1/1s (more on this in my next post).fg\n\n## Curation Tokens SoonTM\n\nIn the near future, **all marketplaces will feature curation tokens** as an incentive to release on a given platform. Tokens enable curators to signal towards which creators (and individual NFTs) are most valuable. Curators that attract the most sales earn the most rewards. \n\nCurators share in a marketplace’s upside by earning tokens or receiving a percentage of sales when a purchase is made through a referral or based on a curator’s delegated stake. This is drastically different from today where fees are captured exclusively by the core team, rather than a global community of tokenholders.\n\nWhen this transition happens, the most active curator (measured by volume and usage) will receive the largest allocations of retroactive airdrops, drastically boosting their signal and curation abilities.\n\nMoving forward, the largest rewards will be captured by those with specialized knowledge of undiscovered talent - essentially playing matchmaker between creator and collector to boost sales on their preferred marketplace(s).\n\nLet’s explore how curation fits into the NFT landscape today.\n\n## The State of NFTs\n\nThe supply of NFTs will outpace the demand. The number of NFTs will grow while the average price per NFT will diminish.\n\nWe’re starting to see this today, with most open editions on Nifty Gateway starting to trade below their primary sale price on the secondary market due to a lack of demand from new buyers and a lack of signal from curators.\n\nThis forces creators to cut through the noise, leading to the formation of micro-economies - or markets that form around specific individuals, brands or creators - for NFTs and their collections.\n\nIn this new world, every creator becomes their own micro-economy. The new race is becoming a majority shareholder in those creator economies through curation.\n\nJust as we see aggressive pushes for majority ownership in a seed-stage company, NFTs unlock these experiments at a more granular level. Access to assets are global and permissionless, and those with a capacity to discover rising talent are able to purchase meaningful pieces of a creator’s micro-economy very early in its lifecycle.\n\n## Community Makes NFTs Valuable\n\nA small percentage of NFTs retain the vast majority of value. Looking to OnlyFans or Medium [as an example](https://twitter.com/iamkoshiek/status/1279753515422953473?s=20), the top 10% of creators will account for 90% of the value.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamludwin/status/1373037695879032834?s=20)\n\nThis places a strong emphasis on community, as NFTs retain and increase their value by [creating a diverse network of curators that share in that collection](https://a16z.com/2021/02/27/nfts-and-a-thousand-true-fans/). **This is the primary reason why CryptoPunks have performed so well**. As the “first NFT”, the CryptoPunk community has ascribed value to specific traits and rarities, so much so that we’re now seeing derivatives like $PUNKS and [social personas](https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT) emerge around it.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/peruggia_v/status/1370258347341934593?s=20)\n\n**Value is directly correlated to the strength of its underlying community. **\n\nCommunity is motivated by intrinsic values like social status and extrinsic values like future upside. It’s a curator’s job to create an ecosystem for both of these motivations to live in harmony.\n\nCommunities like [Friends With Benefits](https://fwb.help/) will soon hold royalty claims on dozens of NFTs. Royalties will be programmatically captured, creating treasuries with lifetime value, no trust required, and no overhead.\n\nThis is why the primary sale of an NFT is not enough to give it long-term value. True value comes from the traction and continued interest around the longevity of specific collections.\n\n## SOCKS Community\n\nLooking at Unisocks, the value of SOCKS spiked 300% in September when Uniswap [announced](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) it was giving 1000 UNI to every address holding 1 SOCKS on September 1st. (fun fact: I sold here - RIP)\n\nSince then, SOCKS has seen no new utility, but has increased nearly 150x in price to its current value of ~$100k/pair. While SOCKS are a fungible ERC20 token, the value of the NFTs a user received when redeeming SOCKS is now [averaged](https://opensea.io/assets/0x65770b5283117639760bea3f867b69b3697a91dd/20) to be about 12.5 ETH.\n\n![SOCKS on OpenSea](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f0fbd3de-fab8-4efc-ba0c-27cb6828145b.jpeg?height=690&width=1600)\n\nAs one of the first “collectibles”, SOCKS holders have described holding the token as a “spiritual experience”. Certain holders are even having SOCKS only dinners for fellow diamond hands.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/lay2000lbs/status/1366167992279719938?s=20)\n\n**This goes to show that the value of NFTs comes from the shared collectible experience within a community. **\n\nAnd how do you incubate this spirit? **By working with curators**.\n\n## Curation is Key\n\nCurators decide which NFTs have value, and which do not.\n\nCurators signal to value and offer services like distribution and strategy to enhance that value.\n\n> Without curators - there is no market for NFTs and therefore, no value.\n\n![Curation Landscape](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d59d1911-e2b6-470c-b2d5-16305d741847.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nGroups like [Flamingo](https://flamingodao.xyz/collection) and Gremlins curate and collect together. They share information about which artists and drops are most relevant and collaborate to form markets (and buzz) around them.\n\nAgencies like [Six](https://twitter.com/sixnft) curate NFT strategies, exchanging a percentage of sales in exchange for distribution channels, administrative overhead, and a seal of approval to facilitate successful drops.\n\nWe’re now seeing creators bundle premium services to build deeper relationships with their superfans - specifically to empower and incubate their biggest curators.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1367875874889031690?s=20)\n\nWhat’s unique about NFT curators is that their value is often democratized among its community.\n\n## Case Study: WHALE\n\n[Whaleshark](https://twitter.com/WhaleShark_Pro) democratized ownership of his famous NFT collection through a social token called WHALE.\n\nOperating on the back of a WHALE DAO, all decisions around the governance of his NFTs rest in the hands of WHALE holders.\n\nWhile the collection has been rather passive since launch, Whaleshark has suggested that the project will move towards more market participation in the near future. This includes taking a portion of profits from NFT sales to conduct WHALE buy-backs.\n\nLooking at Whaleshark as a curator, WHALE is a direct way to participate in the upside of his NFT collection. Because that collection is backed by an avid community sharing in the likeness of the WHALE DAO, it has long-term value. \n\nPlus, operational structures, WHALE salaries and [quarterly reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec9lXMsk_f4&ab_channel=WhaleCommunity) are just some of the icing on the cake that show why Whaleshark has become a leading curator in the NFT stack today.\n\n![WHALE Topshot](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f7734027-eb7f-440d-807b-84dc48a9a032.jpeg?height=900&width=1600)\n\n![WHALE Vault](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/28eb2810-9ef4-4d87-b28c-8d4bb523e094.jpeg?height=288&width=512)\n\n## How to Curate Today\n\nAs Creator DAOs and Sub-DAOs start to pop up around collections like NBA Top Shots or CryptoPunks, so too will the opportunity to participate in those collectives.\n\nGroups like [The First Mint](https://twitter.com/TheFirstMint) are currently working with social token incubator [Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq) to build out a blueprint for their community-first launch. \n\nAs a curator, this provides an opportunity to incubate community around new NFTs. Those that control the community control the power. **After all, the best way to grow a community is to make them rich**.\n\nThe best way to invest in the curation layer is by backing the early experiments positioning themselves as curators. Most curators will find ways to offer basket exposure to their underlying collection. **Own a part of that basket**.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/WhaleShark_Pro/status/1375100298419527681?s=20)\n\nWhen valuing a curator, look for the following:\n\n- Which collections do they own a significant portion of?\n- Were they early to these collections, or late movers?\n- Do they have the ability to influence a new collection, or simply follow on?\n- Does the curator have strong leadership?\n- Are there plans to democratize access to their collection?\n\nThe best curators are those with a strong capacity to influence the next CryptoPunks. Look deeper than a curator touting purchase prices, and instead focus on those crate digging to capture significant market share in an undiscovered collection.\n\nIn case you were wondering, here’s why.\n\n![Nifty Portfolios](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64620cc2-082e-4256-9321-ecf612a8c254.jpeg?height=608&width=985)\n\n## The Rise of the Micro-Economies\n\nThe best curators are [not traditional venture investment vehicles](https://twitter.com/pridesai/status/1365437530842218497?s=20). They are the individuals, groups and communities organizing around new collections using shared capital to incubate rising talent.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1374101538734448641?s=20)\n\nWhile the focus is currently on NFTs, the next chapter of curation is fungible tokens. Similar to WHALE or FWB, curators will offer democratized access to their collections, and give all participants a way to capture their upside.\n\nCurators will grow their community treasury to feature a diverse pool of NFTs, ETH to invest, social token partnerships, and curation tokens from marketplace rewards. **In theory, curation treasuries could be the most diverse in all of crypto.**\n\nIf you’re looking to deploy capital into NFTs, look no further than the curators.\n\nThe hardest part is going to be getting accepted.\n\n---\n\nSpecial thanks Variant for inspiring this post and to Whaleshark, John Palmer, Alex Zhang and Carlos Gomes for their feedback.\n\nThe owner of this NFT will receive:\n\n- A first look at all my future Mirror pieces before they go live. \n- A one hour working session to dive deeper into this thesis, and explore the rising players, trends and projects worth keeping an eye on. \n- 60 [FWB Pro](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/friends-with-benefits-pro) - good for access to [Friends With Benefits](https://fwb.help/) Season Two.\n\nThe link below shows where the $VALUE NFT lives on Zora. \n\nPlease only bid in WETH as to ensure backers can redeem their $VALUE!\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7/662)", "timestamp": 1616696364, "digest": "A16NP2XXi9RdHptfdF9WHR0Xq_E1XDmUgMwPmJYOG7w", "contributor": "0x46301F7E700Be9cFfCE3e5e142a2244Df3f2d4F2"}

Should I leave it as the tweet thread? No, I’m not really a “hot take” kind of writer, and there’s so much more to say. Do I make it a read-only Google Doc? That’s just annoying. There has to be a better way that would afford me the time to focus, the ability to work with an editor, and think about this is an expanded multimedia piece.\n\nThat’s where Mirror came in. Mirror is a platform that allows writers to build global decentralized publications. They have tools to help writers raise money through crowdfunds and monetize their work while retaining ownership over their work. Behind the scenes, Mirror runs on smart contacts deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nAs a result, writers can raise money from anyone globally with an Ethereum address. Writers can also monetize through novel methods like NFTs which ensure writing remains a public good while still retaining value through ownership.\n\nWhy am _I_ doing this? Because I would like for this essay to be a proof of concept for how other writers in the cultural sector can be remunerated for their labor. I have seen too many friends hunt down $75 from publications to not believe that there has to be a better way. I’m not particularly interested in engaging with NFTs as an artist, but do see the potential for this technology to radically change the way that we fund and support undervalued creative labor—writing, choreography, etc.\n\n## HOW IT WORKS\n\n**How long?** The crowdfund will go until the 20 ETH cap is hit. The minimum funding goal is 10 ETH (which goes to myself, an editor and illustrator)\n\n**Rewards?** As a contributor to a crowdfund on Ethereum, you will be permanently etched in history as someone who made this project possible. In return for your ETH contribution, you will receive $MOOD tokens. Once the report is released and the NFTs are sold, their value will flow back to the Crowdfund contract, and therefore the backers. You’ll then be able to redeem your $MOOD tokens in return for a proportional share of the ETH in the contract. Yet, the main benefit is being a part of making this project possible and receiving a token that marks this patronage while also giving you ownership in the potential upside of this project.\n\n**Contribution limit?** 1 ETH.\n\n[The technical version here](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ)\n\n## THE BREAKDOWN\n\n### Research & Writing Phase\n\nWhile writing is often seen as a solitary practice, it can sometimes take a village to get a text out the door. In the past, I have had a research assistant, editor and designer work alongside me. These are resources often provided by a larger publication, though without that infrastructure I will need to work with an editor to ensure the highest quality work. \n\n### NFT Illustration\n\nAs mentioned, I’ll be working with an artist to create NFT illustrations to be included in the piece. In terms of vibe, I’m thinking of something in the vein of [Jeremy Blake’s pieces that were created for Punch Drunk Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIypELB-tSc&ab_channel=SleepyJones).\n\n### Length \n\n~6000-8000 words\n\n### Turnaround Time \n\n6-8 Weeks\n", "timestamp": 1616696217, "digest": "vbiD5sIgZaqUAuXu0P6SkvmCNOM7MtRCdqsEDyxsOXU", "contributor": "0x345122f6513329d169cFf39ACe8978EDC3942b5D"}

People creatively minded. I landed an early invite to the project in 2009 after spending days exploring [Space Collective](https://spacecollective.org), another project by the same team. “Where forward thinking terrestrials exchange ideas and information about the state of the species, their planet and the universe, living the lives of science fiction today.” It’s still an absolute favorite, and I’ve never seen anything else like it.\n\nThe invite enabled me to create my own site using the tools which had been developed for Space Collective, now white-labeled and able to be associated with any domain. In addition to a selection of designs you also had full access to the `html` and `css`. With that level of access I couldn’t stop messing with it. It was the first time I’d seen `AJAX`. It was also an introduction to unfamiliar culture like paintings by Bosch, design from Emil Ruder, or quotes of Timothy Leary—all examples of the filler content used instead of uninspired *lorum ipsum*. The designs were focused, mostly typographic, and emphasized the work over interface. “*The content is the Cargo*.” A couple days after receiving the invite an email hit my inbox.\n\n> “So you keep changing the design of your Cargo site, do you want to visit us in Los Angeles?”\n\nMy family is in the music industry, and I was touring that summer as a for-hire drummer in a group I had no interest in.

After returning to California I decided to hike the [Pacific Crest Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail), a 2650 mile path running from Mexico to Canada along the mountains spanning the west coast.\n\nWhat I expected to be a break from technology ended up being four months of walking a marathon (or two) each day while contemplating technology, perception, environment and how it all overlaps.\n\n![Scenes from the PCT, 2019](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fa71a599-1da0-44bc-a896-2749c614dba4.jpeg?height=1300&width=2600)\n\nAfter a four day stretch of one-hundred(ish) miles and relative isolation all I could think about was food.

{"id": "pwhQ4GEwQo-cHpGtkA1mNsmF2CjvZW3QMVEl__q53nA", "title": "Editor Guide", "body": "# NFT Value Capture Equation\n\nLast month, I set out to explore one question: **where do NFTs capture value?**\n\nThis is not a thesis on what makes NFTs valuable, it assumes you already understand [why scarce, permanent, ownable digital content has value](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo).\n\nInstead, we’ll use this essay to explore the NFT stack, breaking down the various layers as we hone in on one in particular - curation.\n\n## Analyzing the NFT Stack\n\nNFTs flow through a number of layers from creation to collection. Baked within this stack are dozens of platforms, many of which are covered in my first Mirror post on the [NFT issuance landscape](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/PF42Z9oE_r6yhZN9jZrrseXfHaZALj9JIfMplshlgQ0).\n\n![NFT Stack](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7ae6c2ab-7632-4e6c-a2cf-490462eb4086.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nEvery NFT is issued on a blockchain through a process called minting. There are different means of minting, but the end result is creating a token that conforms to a certain NFT schema ([ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155), or [zNFT](https://github.com/ourzora/core#architecture)).\n\nOnce minted, NFTs can move seamlessly between marketplaces and applications, just like a cryptocurrency can move between exchanges and wallets. Oftentimes, decisions for what marketplace to release on are based on the structure of the NFT sale, including nuances like editions vs 1/1s (more on this in my next post).fg\n\n## Curation Tokens SoonTM\n\nIn the near future, **all marketplaces will feature curation tokens** as an incentive to release on a given platform. Tokens enable curators to signal towards which creators (and individual NFTs) are most valuable. Curators that attract the most sales earn the most rewards. \n\nCurators share in a marketplace’s upside by earning tokens or receiving a percentage of sales when a purchase is made through a referral or based on a curator’s delegated stake. This is drastically different from today where fees are captured exclusively by the core team, rather than a global community of tokenholders.\n\nWhen this transition happens, the most active curator (measured by volume and usage) will receive the largest allocations of retroactive airdrops, drastically boosting their signal and curation abilities.\n\nMoving forward, the largest rewards will be captured by those with specialized knowledge of undiscovered talent - essentially playing matchmaker between creator and collector to boost sales on their preferred marketplace(s).\n\nLet’s explore how curation fits into the NFT landscape today.\n\n## The State of NFTs\n\nThe supply of NFTs will outpace the demand. The number of NFTs will grow while the average price per NFT will diminish.\n\nWe’re starting to see this today, with most open editions on Nifty Gateway starting to trade below their primary sale price on the secondary market due to a lack of demand from new buyers and a lack of signal from curators.\n\nThis forces creators to cut through the noise, leading to the formation of micro-economies - or markets that form around specific individuals, brands or creators - for NFTs and their collections.\n\nIn this new world, every creator becomes their own micro-economy. The new race is becoming a majority shareholder in those creator economies through curation.\n\nJust as we see aggressive pushes for majority ownership in a seed-stage company, NFTs unlock these experiments at a more granular level. Access to assets are global and permissionless, and those with a capacity to discover rising talent are able to purchase meaningful pieces of a creator’s micro-economy very early in its lifecycle.\n\n## Community Makes NFTs Valuable\n\nA small percentage of NFTs retain the vast majority of value. Looking to OnlyFans or Medium [as an example](https://twitter.com/iamkoshiek/status/1279753515422953473?s=20), the top 10% of creators will account for 90% of the value.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamludwin/status/1373037695879032834?s=20)\n\nThis places a strong emphasis on community, as NFTs retain and increase their value by [creating a diverse network of curators that share in that collection](https://a16z.com/2021/02/27/nfts-and-a-thousand-true-fans/). **This is the primary reason why CryptoPunks have performed so well**. As the “first NFT”, the CryptoPunk community has ascribed value to specific traits and rarities, so much so that we’re now seeing derivatives like $PUNKS and [social personas](https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT) emerge around it.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/peruggia_v/status/1370258347341934593?s=20)\n\n**Value is directly correlated to the strength of its underlying community. **\n\nCommunity is motivated by intrinsic values like social status and extrinsic values like future upside. It’s a curator’s job to create an ecosystem for both of these motivations to live in harmony.\n\nCommunities like [Friends With Benefits](https://fwb.help/) will soon hold royalty claims on dozens of NFTs. Royalties will be programmatically captured, creating treasuries with lifetime value, no trust required, and no overhead.\n\nThis is why the primary sale of an NFT is not enough to give it long-term value. True value comes from the traction and continued interest around the longevity of specific collections.\n\n## SOCKS Community\n\nLooking at Unisocks, the value of SOCKS spiked 300% in September when Uniswap [announced](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) it was giving 1000 UNI to every address holding 1 SOCKS on September 1st. (fun fact: I sold here - RIP)\n\nSince then, SOCKS has seen no new utility, but has increased nearly 150x in price to its current value of ~$100k/pair. While SOCKS are a fungible ERC20 token, the value of the NFTs a user received when redeeming SOCKS is now [averaged](https://opensea.io/assets/0x65770b5283117639760bea3f867b69b3697a91dd/20) to be about 12.5 ETH.\n\n![SOCKS on OpenSea](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f0fbd3de-fab8-4efc-ba0c-27cb6828145b.jpeg?height=690&width=1600)\n\nAs one of the first “collectibles”, SOCKS holders have described holding the token as a “spiritual experience”. Certain holders are even having SOCKS only dinners for fellow diamond hands.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/lay2000lbs/status/1366167992279719938?s=20)\n\n**This goes to show that the value of NFTs comes from the shared collectible experience within a community. **\n\nAnd how do you incubate this spirit? **By working with curators**.\n\n## Curation is Key\n\nCurators decide which NFTs have value, and which do not.\n\nCurators signal to value and offer services like distribution and strategy to enhance that value.\n\n> Without curators - there is no market for NFTs and therefore, no value.\n\n![Curation Landscape](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d59d1911-e2b6-470c-b2d5-16305d741847.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nGroups like [Flamingo](https://flamingodao.xyz/collection) and Gremlins curate and collect together. They share information about which artists and drops are most relevant and collaborate to form markets (and buzz) around them.\n\nAgencies like [Six](https://twitter.com/sixnft) curate NFT strategies, exchanging a percentage of sales in exchange for distribution channels, administrative overhead, and a seal of approval to facilitate successful drops.\n\nWe’re now seeing creators bundle premium services to build deeper relationships with their superfans - specifically to empower and incubate their biggest curators.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1367875874889031690?s=20)\n\nWhat’s unique about NFT curators is that their value is often democratized among its community.\n\n## Case Study: WHALE\n\n[Whaleshark](https://twitter.com/WhaleShark_Pro) democratized ownership of his famous NFT collection through a social token called WHALE.\n\nOperating on the back of a WHALE DAO, all decisions around the governance of his NFTs rest in the hands of WHALE holders.\n\nWhile the collection has been rather passive since launch, Whaleshark has suggested that the project will move towards more market participation in the near future. This includes taking a portion of profits from NFT sales to conduct WHALE buy-backs.\n\nLooking at Whaleshark as a curator, WHALE is a direct way to participate in the upside of his NFT collection. Because that collection is backed by an avid community sharing in the likeness of the WHALE DAO, it has long-term value. \n\nPlus, operational structures, WHALE salaries and [quarterly reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec9lXMsk_f4&ab_channel=WhaleCommunity) are just some of the icing on the cake that show why Whaleshark has become a leading curator in the NFT stack today.\n\n![WHALE Topshot](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f7734027-eb7f-440d-807b-84dc48a9a032.jpeg?height=900&width=1600)\n\n![WHALE Vault](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/28eb2810-9ef4-4d87-b28c-8d4bb523e094.jpeg?height=288&width=512)\n\n## How to Curate Today\n\nAs Creator DAOs and Sub-DAOs start to pop up around collections like NBA Top Shots or CryptoPunks, so too will the opportunity to participate in those collectives.\n\nGroups like [The First Mint](https://twitter.com/TheFirstMint) are currently working with social token incubator [Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq) to build out a blueprint for their community-first launch. \n\nAs a curator, this provides an opportunity to incubate community around new NFTs. Those that control the community control the power. **After all, the best way to grow a community is to make them rich**.\n\nThe best way to invest in the curation layer is by backing the early experiments positioning themselves as curators. Most curators will find ways to offer basket exposure to their underlying collection. **Own a part of that basket**.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/WhaleShark_Pro/status/1375100298419527681?s=20)\n\nWhen valuing a curator, look for the following:\n\n- Which collections do they own a significant portion of?\n- Were they early to these collections, or late movers?\n- Do they have the ability to influence a new collection, or simply follow on?\n- Does the curator have strong leadership?\n- Are there plans to democratize access to their collection?\n\nThe best curators are those with a strong capacity to influence the next CryptoPunks. Look deeper than a curator touting purchase prices, and instead focus on those crate digging to capture significant market share in an undiscovered collection.\n\nIn case you were wondering, here’s why.\n\n![Nifty Portfolios](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64620cc2-082e-4256-9321-ecf612a8c254.jpeg?height=608&width=985)\n\n## The Rise of the Micro-Economies\n\nThe best curators are [not traditional venture investment vehicles](https://twitter.com/pridesai/status/1365437530842218497?s=20). They are the individuals, groups and communities organizing around new collections using shared capital to incubate rising talent.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1374101538734448641?s=20)\n\nWhile the focus is currently on NFTs, the next chapter of curation is fungible tokens. Similar to WHALE or FWB, curators will offer democratized access to their collections, and give all participants a way to capture their upside.\n\nCurators will grow their community treasury to feature a diverse pool of NFTs, ETH to invest, social token partnerships, and curation tokens from marketplace rewards. **In theory, curation treasuries could be the most diverse in all of crypto.**\n\nIf you’re looking to deploy capital into NFTs, look no further than the curators.\n\nThe hardest part is going to be getting accepted.\n\n---\n\nSpecial thanks Variant for inspiring this post and to Whaleshark, John Palmer, Alex Zhang and Carlos Gomes for their feedback.\n\nThe owner of this NFT will receive:\n\n- A first look at all my future Mirror pieces before they go live. \n- A one hour working session to dive deeper into this thesis, and explore the rising players, trends and projects worth keeping an eye on. \n- 60 [FWB Pro](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/friends-with-benefits-pro) - good for access to [Friends With Benefits](https://fwb.help/) Season Two.\n\nThe link below shows where the $VALUE NFT lives on Zora. \n\nPlease only bid in WETH as to ensure backers can redeem their $VALUE!\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7/662)", "timestamp": 1616703844, "digest": "fMzen4XH0ez6PIu2H7c_ynrLyTajh41rPVIkSVaqDsE", "contributor": "0x841fF85B6873d7bfB712C8f7A347C774355b6EC3"}

We are delighted to share that we've officially closed our first full-stack engineering sprint: the MVP of the Mirror blogging platform. This will allow us to onboard our first writers and serve as the foundation for all the functionality in the future.\n\nExample\n\n[Mirror’s first Tweet](https://twitter.com/viamirror/status/1325856116748726273)\n\n[a16z](https://a16z.com/)\n\nWe have a lot to figure out over the next few months and years—from discovering new crypto-native business models for creators to supporting basic things like embedding NFTs—but we knew that the starting point for the project was supporting a basic publishing experience—the ability to post text and share it with the world. \n\nThis post details our journey so far.\n\n![Season’s Greetings!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bb9a61e1-f524-4135-bae5-91ddf7f0a1e9.jpeg?width=2560&height=1440)\n\nTesting it out\n\n## The Starting Line\n\nOur first commit to the backend API was 29 days ago, on December 7, 2020 — my (Graeme's) first official day at Mirror. Denis had been speaking with [Trent](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/) about announcing his book on Mirror, and working with Jon-Kyle on designs and UI. We set an ambitious goal to have everything working for Trent by Christmas time — our gift to the world! 🎁 \n\n[Steve Reich, Come Out to Show Them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouYiTiiY3vg)\n\nTo ship the MVP, we needed to make crucial early technical decisions. Most importantly, how to create a world-class writing tool with a native web3 and crypto foundation.\n\n## How to Construct a Web3-Native Writing Platform\n\nOne of the first challenges was thinking through building the platform from a web3 perspective. Here are rules of the web3 game (*via negativa* style):\n\n1. Post content shall not be centralized\n2. The reading experience should not require trust in Mirror\n3. Mirror shall not own a writer's domain\n4. Writers do not need to connect their wallets and sign everything they write\n5. Mirror shall not attempt to store Ethereum private keys in the browser!\n6. Writing shall not be excessively expensive (for Mirror or writers)\n7. Bonus: No using email-password signup!\n\nThe architecture we came up with looks something like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ad92c52-5226-40c1-b654-4bbfe905c278.jpeg)\n\nI will now briefly break down how we solved each of these problems.\n\n### 1. Post content shall not be centralized\n\nWe decided to use the **Arweave** data storage protocol to store user content. Arweave provides permanent storage of data for a one-time cost at upload time. The data posted to Arweave includes all of the information required to *retrieve* all entries for a publication (including any changes made), and to *verify* authorship authenticity. (We have plans to publish the protocol specification along with an open-source tool that can assist with this retrieval and verification process, so that it would be trivial to migrate off of Mirror if the time ever comes for that.)\n\n### 2. The reading experience should not require trust in Mirror\n\nAll entries are signed by a user's *signing key* (this is a non-Ethereum keypair that does not contain any direct economic value. I'll explain more on this later). The signature is then published to Arweave, along with the digest that was signed, and with the content that went into the digest. The *signing key* itself is put into a message that asserts authorship rights, which is then signed by the writer's Ethereum address. All of this information is stored on Arweave, along with the entry's content — for every entry and update. Therefore, it's possible (and fairly easy) for anyone to verify whether an entry was authored by a given Ethereum account.\n\nWe're still iterating on this model, and it's obviously very early. Consider us in the \"testnet\" phase of this (along with everything else you read in this post).\n\n### 3. Mirror shall not own a writer's domain\n\nWe use ENS to provide domain ownership to the writer, who claims this ownership by burning an invite token (called $WRITE; expect more information on this soon) during onboarding. The process involves interacting with the $WRITE ERC20 token contract, which grants approval to an ENS registrar contract to burn the token just before registering the ENS label.\n\n### 4. Writers do not need to connect their wallets and sign everything they write\n\nWe didn't want to make it cumbersome to have to write an Entry on Mirror — for example, needing to sign everything with their Ledger wallet (or Metamask). Particularly, because we imagine allowing users to take smaller and more frequent actions, too, like commenting on or liking someone else's entry. We still want to have superb security, but we deemed it to be dissuading if writers required their hardware wallet for writing.\n\n### 5. Mirror shall not attempt to store Ethereum private keys in the browser!\n\nIt's considered heresy to store a user's Ethereum private keys directly in the browser, and I would typically agree with that. It's not strictly true that you *couldn't* build a useful webapp this way (Dharma did it for a while), but the security burden will compound over time. This is mainly because there is no way to make and store a non-extractable Ethereum private key using the native web-crypto library; it doesn't support the same ECDSA curve. I don't know how this will play out in the future, but for now, I would say that this is something to avoid.\n\nWe avoid this security burden in two ways: \n\n1. By using a different signature scheme from the Ethereum implementation (we're using the NIST curve *P-256*), therefore making it impossible for the key to \"hold economic value\" at all, and sidestepping a major issue altogether. The worst case scenario, under the most severe threat model (e.g. a stolen computer), would be fraudulent authorship.\n2. By generating the key using the non-extractable property, and storing it in IndexDB. This means that there's no way to export the private key at all — the private key can only be used to sign content on the webpage in which it is loaded, and IndexDB prevents it from being loaded on any website outside of mirror.xyz.\n\nI invite criticism on this approach. I am not a cryptography expert, and we're just trying to make an honest effort at a secure and usable platform that lives outside of the conventional standards of web2 that have been failing us. If you want a more detailed explanation of the approach, you can refer to an [internal RFC](https://eng.mirror.xyz/1cywoB2BSXKRdJPA26NmH26AvuIbTJ0p8rYf7KaKktc) about this topic, which has now been posted on Mirror.\n\n### 6. Writing shall not be excessively expensive (for Mirror or writers)\n\nSolved by using Arweave! 🎉 Very cheap (at the moment?) — it's costing us about 0.00005 AR per blog post, which amounts to about $0.00015, at the current exchange rate.\n\n### 7. Bonus: No using email-password signup!\n\nSince we have signing keys and a signature-based authenticity model, we don't need to have login sessions, and we don't have anything to recover via email. In the future, it may be useful to allow for email notifications and email digests, but for now, it's interesting that there is no email confirmation required to use Mirror. This is the crypto-native way used by apps like Zerion and Zapper, and is the future of authentication on the web.\n\n(We make up for this lack of friction by adding a transaction confirmation in onboarding! 😂 But even that, we will smooth out over time.)\n\n## Pre-Mainnet Testing\n\nMirror is still in its early stages, and we are using the Ethereum testnet infrastructure to explore our ideas. This allows us to run through complex protocol flows (like burning tokens, deploying contract, and registering ENS domains) very cheaply and with fast confirmation times. In particular, we're still exploring what the *mechanics* of our economic, naming and ownership protocol will be, as demand grows for a more sophisticated system. We're hoping to deploy to mainnet as soon as we know that migrating our early writers to this better protocol will be feasible and easy.\n\n## Building a Backend API as a \"Protocol Gateway\"\n\nIn order to facilitate a good reading and writing experience, we decided to build a backend API that can act as a *gateway* between client and protocol. This allows us to do things like signature verification before publishing to Arweave, or to pay for the Arweave publication ourselves and cache the entry content for extremely fast response-times. This allows us to have a world-class writing and reading experience, while still achieving all of our goals of content decentralization.\n\nIn terms of building this backend API in 2021, there were probably 10+ viable options for where to deploy code and just as many promising languages for its development. Picking early tools can be difficult! I ended up choosing something that was strongly within my realm of competency, and would also be easy for new engineers on our team to learn. I also chose what I believe to be the path of greatest extensibility and flexibility into the future, which for us meant building our backend in **NodeJS on AWS infrastructure**. The decision was not obvious, however, and I wanted to take into account the competencies we would be building as an engineering order in time to come.\n\nSetting up web applications on AWS is much more time consuming than using an abstracted service like Heroku or Vercel. Things like environments, databases, security groups, and deployments all have to be configured up individually. In the long-run, though, it grants more control, and this can be helpful for crypto applications that sometimes had non-standard concerns. It took me about 2 days to set up this infrastructure — including security groups, IAM accounts, databases, staging and production environments, etc. But from here, I know that I have the world's best infrastructure behind us, without the platform risk of newer, less fully-featured services.\n\nWe use **Postgres via AWS's RDS service**, and VPC and security groups for communicating between **ElasticBeanstalk** and RDS. We used **GraphQL with Apollo** for our API endpoints.\n\nI'll note here that, for a while before committing to this path, I considered using writing the backend in Golang or Rust, and protobufs, since cryptographic signatures require strict typing for correct validation across platforms. But I know that development would have been *a lot slower* if we had gone this path. On the other hand, building a competency in Rust from the start would have allowed us to track the growing number of interesting layer-2 integrations (which seems promising).\n\nOur deployments are handled through **Github workflows**, such that every push to our *staging* or *main* triggers an action on Github that deploys the application. To be clear, there is a *lot* that still needs to be improved here — including blocking deploys on test suites passing, and measuring test coverage. We don't have full integration tests, e.g. against a built docker contains with exposed GraphQL endpoints.\n\n![The genesis entry](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7c3c118d-8dda-4f5d-9e80-6df764fd403c.jpeg)\n\n## Building a Frontend for Blogging\n\nWe decided to use Vercel and NextJS on the frontend, which has wildcard subdomain support, as well as support for statically rendered content. This has been great so far, because we get fast-loading, well-cached content that can be read easily by machines like social media platforms and search engines. It's also generally a fantastic product for managing staging environments, deployments, etc.\n\n## What went well?\n\nWe were able to get an MVP out *really* really quickly — we made a goal to ship before Christmas, and only started building the backend some ways into December. So overall, it took us mere weeks to build a novel CMS that uses public-private key signatures to verify content, stores data in Postgres, stores data on Arweave, burns a token on Ethereum to claim ownership of an ENS label, validates ownership of that label, iterations on our signing model, and so on. \n\nHere's a few specific examples of these things:\n\n1. The first blog post by Trent: [https://stateful.mirror.xyz/a151ee1decb2028a8bb48277f6928c6f38319c32601dc1da1ee82acfcad2e525](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/a151ee1decb2028a8bb48277f6928c6f38319c32601dc1da1ee82acfcad2e525)\n2.

An Arweave transaction that stores Linda's [post](https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d) forever, along with signatures that prove authorship: [https://viewblock.io/arweave/tx/WvwsHyKCjfkLoKNbNSGfoV-vaWrJa2PMYB_c3wucXUA](https://viewblock.io/arweave/tx/WvwsHyKCjfkLoKNbNSGfoV-vaWrJa2PMYB_c3wucXUA)\n\nIt's exhausting even to think back through the past month and everything we've been able to build out! And the fact that this is *basically working* is very fun and exciting. I'm glad that we also did a fair amount of this \"in public\" and have screen recording our on-boarding sessions.\n\n## What went wrong?\n\nBy tackling so many challenges at once, it sometimes felt like there were an overwhelming number of important issues that urgently needed to be patched. Sometimes, that made it difficult for me to communicate priorities in linear way, so that we were all on the same page and rationally working together on the same thing. Given that that team hadn't worked together before this project, and are just learning about each of our distinct work and communication styles, there was considerable \"under-communication\" that we need to improve on.\n\nThe fast pace also created some disorder. For example, late one Thursday I was configuring the Github Workflows to deploy our AWS EB environment, and it was working well in staging. We didn't deploy to production over the weekend, and during that time I updated production to a whole new AWS EB environment. Our first deploy on Monday shipped to the *outdated* environment, and a bug manifested right before an [onboarding session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e9Fcf0DiOE)! We had to roll-back to prevent live-streaming a failed onboarding, and it was very confusing! We wrote our first post-mortem for this.\n\n## What lessons were learned?\n\nWe learned that we can really push hard and work quickly to make an ambitious goal a reality within a short timeframe. I think we proved that by hitting the December 25th deadline.\n\nWe also learned a lot about each each and our competencies (there's only three of us), and how we need to communicate with each other to build more trust and confidence in how things are going. That includes over-communicating more about expectations and responsibilities over the codebase and product, outstanding issues, priorities, and individual goals for any given sprint.\n\nExpect more information on $WRITE soon.\n\nIn the meantime, you can read the first entries published on Mirror over the past few weeks:\n\n- [https://stateful.mirror.xyz/](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/) by [@trent_vanepps](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps)\n- [http://amorfati.mirror.xyz/](http://amorfati.mirror.xyz/) by [@apruden08](https://twitter.com/apruden08)\n- [https://joonian.mirror.xyz/](https://joonian.mirror.xyz/) by [@joonian](https://twitter.com/joonian)\n- [https://helloshreyas.mirror.xyz/](https://helloshreyas.mirror.xyz/) by [@HelloShreyas](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas)\n- [https://g.mirror.xyz/](https://g.mirror.xyz/) by [@strangechances](https://twitter.com/strangechances)\n- [https://d.mirror.xyz/](https://d.mirror.xyz/) by [@Iiterature](https://twitter.com/Iiterature)", "timestamp": 1616702239, "digest": "B32AHYVIlCf20jjOc7ebm3dv1W7KIBjdw9JB93z3gKY", "contributor": "0x841fF85B6873d7bfB712C8f7A347C774355b6EC3"}
{"id": "ajREC6Jaz8hoXzA0wCIUyY2Fbsgkv7DFocT2GS1UeDw", "title": "NFT Value Capture Equation", "body": "Last month, I set out to explore one question: **where do NFTs capture value?**\n\nThis is not a thesis on what makes NFTs valuable, it assumes you already understand [why scarce, permanent, ownable digital content has value](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo).\n\nInstead, we’ll use this essay to explore the NFT stack, breaking down the various layers as we hone in on one in particular - curation.\n\n## Analyzing the NFT Stack\n\nNFTs flow through a number of layers from creation to collection. Baked within this stack are dozens of platforms, many of which are covered in my first Mirror post on the [NFT issuance landscape](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/PF42Z9oE_r6yhZN9jZrrseXfHaZALj9JIfMplshlgQ0).\n\n![NFT Stack](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7ae6c2ab-7632-4e6c-a2cf-490462eb4086.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nEvery NFT is issued on a blockchain through a process called minting. There are different means of minting, but the end result is creating a token that conforms to a certain NFT schema ([ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155), or [zNFT](https://github.com/ourzora/core#architecture)).\n\nOnce minted, NFTs can move seamlessly between marketplaces and applications, just like a cryptocurrency can move between exchanges and wallets. Oftentimes, decisions for what marketplace to release on are based on the structure of the NFT sale, including nuances like editions vs 1/1s (more on this in my next post).fg\n\n## Curation Tokens SoonTM\n\nIn the near future, **all marketplaces will feature curation tokens** as an incentive to release on a given platform. Tokens enable curators to signal towards which creators (and individual NFTs) are most valuable. Curators that attract the most sales earn the most rewards. \n\nCurators share in a marketplace’s upside by earning tokens or receiving a percentage of sales when a purchase is made through a referral or based on a curator’s delegated stake. This is drastically different from today where fees are captured exclusively by the core team, rather than a global community of tokenholders.\n\nWhen this transition happens, the most active curator (measured by volume and usage) will receive the largest allocations of retroactive airdrops, drastically boosting their signal and curation abilities.\n\nMoving forward, the largest rewards will be captured by those with specialized knowledge of undiscovered talent - essentially playing matchmaker between creator and collector to boost sales on their preferred marketplace(s).\n\nLet’s explore how curation fits into the NFT landscape today.\n\n## The State of NFTs\n\nThe supply of NFTs will outpace the demand. The number of NFTs will grow while the average price per NFT will diminish.\n\nWe’re starting to see this today, with most open editions on Nifty Gateway starting to trade below their primary sale price on the secondary market due to a lack of demand from new buyers and a lack of signal from curators.\n\nThis forces creators to cut through the noise, leading to the formation of micro-economies - or markets that form around specific individuals, brands or creators - for NFTs and their collections.\n\nIn this new world, every creator becomes their own micro-economy. The new race is becoming a majority shareholder in those creator economies through curation.\n\nJust as we see aggressive pushes for majority ownership in a seed-stage company, NFTs unlock these experiments at a more granular level. Access to assets are global and permissionless, and those with a capacity to discover rising talent are able to purchase meaningful pieces of a creator’s micro-economy very early in its lifecycle.\n\n## Community Makes NFTs Valuable\n\nA small percentage of NFTs retain the vast majority of value. Looking to OnlyFans or Medium [as an example](https://twitter.com/iamkoshiek/status/1279753515422953473?s=20), the top 10% of creators will account for 90% of the value.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamludwin/status/1373037695879032834?s=20)\n\nThis places a strong emphasis on community, as NFTs retain and increase their value by [creating a diverse network of curators that share in that collection](https://a16z.com/2021/02/27/nfts-and-a-thousand-true-fans/). **This is the primary reason why CryptoPunks have performed so well**. As the “first NFT”, the CryptoPunk community has ascribed value to specific traits and rarities, so much so that we’re now seeing derivatives like $PUNKS and [social personas](https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT) emerge around it.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/peruggia_v/status/1370258347341934593?s=20)\n\n**Value is directly correlated to the strength of its underlying community.**\n\nCommunity is motivated by intrinsic values like social status and extrinsic values like future upside. It’s a curator’s job to create an ecosystem for both of these motivations to live in harmony.\n\nCommunities like [Friends With Benefits](https://fwb.help/) will soon hold royalty claims on dozens of NFTs. Royalties will be programmatically captured, creating treasuries with lifetime value, no trust required, and no overhead.\n\nThis is why the primary sale of an NFT is not enough to give it long-term value. True value comes from the traction and continued interest around the longevity of specific collections.\n\n## SOCKS Community\n\nLooking at Unisocks, the value of SOCKS spiked 300% in September when Uniswap [announced](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) it was giving 1000 UNI to every address holding 1 SOCKS on September 1st. (fun fact: I sold here - RIP)\n\nSince then, SOCKS has seen no new utility, but has increased nearly 150x in price to its current value of ~$100k/pair. While SOCKS are a fungible ERC20 token, the value of the NFTs a user received when redeeming SOCKS is now [averaged](https://opensea.io/assets/0x65770b5283117639760bea3f867b69b3697a91dd/20) to be about 12.5 ETH.\n\n![SOCKS on OpenSea](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f0fbd3de-fab8-4efc-ba0c-27cb6828145b.jpeg?height=690&width=1600)\n\nAs one of the first “collectibles”, SOCKS holders have described holding the token as a “spiritual experience”. Certain holders are even having SOCKS only dinners for fellow diamond hands.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/lay2000lbs/status/1366167992279719938?s=20)\n\n**This goes to show that the value of NFTs comes from the shared collectible experience within a community.**\n\nAnd how do you incubate this spirit? **By working with curators**.\n\n## Curation is Key\n\nCurators decide which NFTs have value, and which do not.\n\nCurators signal to value and offer services like distribution and strategy to enhance that value.\n\n> Without curators - there is no market for NFTs and therefore, no value.\n\n![Curation Landscape](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d59d1911-e2b6-470c-b2d5-16305d741847.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nGroups like [Flamingo](https://flamingodao.xyz/collection) and Gremlins curate and collect together.

Baked within this stack are dozens of platforms, many of which are covered in my first Mirror post on the [NFT issuance landscape](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/PF42Z9oE_r6yhZN9jZrrseXfHaZALj9JIfMplshlgQ0).\n\n![NFT Stack](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7ae6c2ab-7632-4e6c-a2cf-490462eb4086.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nEvery NFT is issued on a blockchain through a process called minting. There are different means of minting, but the end result is creating a token that conforms to a certain NFT schema ([ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155), or [zNFT](https://github.com/ourzora/core#architecture)).\n\nOnce minted, NFTs can move seamlessly between marketplaces and applications, just like a cryptocurrency can move between exchanges and wallets.

Tokens enable curators to signal towards which creators (and individual NFTs) are most valuable. Curators that attract the most sales earn the most rewards. \n\nCurators share in a marketplace’s upside by earning tokens or receiving a percentage of sales when a purchase is made through a referral or based on a curator’s delegated stake. This is drastically different from today where fees are captured exclusively by the core team, rather than a global community of tokenholders.\n\nWhen this transition happens, the most active curator (measured by volume and usage) will receive the largest allocations of retroactive airdrops, drastically boosting their signal and curation abilities.\n\nMoving forward, the largest rewards will be captured by those with specialized knowledge of undiscovered talent - essentially playing matchmaker between creator and collector to boost sales on their preferred marketplace(s).\n\nLet’s explore how curation fits into the NFT landscape today.\n\n## The State of NFTs\n\nThe supply of NFTs will outpace the demand.

Baked within this stack are dozens of platforms, many of which are covered in my first Mirror post on the [NFT issuance landscape](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/PF42Z9oE_r6yhZN9jZrrseXfHaZALj9JIfMplshlgQ0).\n\n![NFT Stack](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7ae6c2ab-7632-4e6c-a2cf-490462eb4086.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nEvery NFT is issued on a blockchain through a process called minting. There are different means of minting, but the end result is creating a token that conforms to a certain NFT schema ([ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155), or [zNFT](https://github.com/ourzora/core#architecture)).\n\nOnce minted, NFTs can move seamlessly between marketplaces and applications, just like a cryptocurrency can move between exchanges and wallets. Oftentimes, decisions for what marketplace to release on are based on the structure of the NFT sale, including nuances like editions vs 1/1s (more on this in my next post).fg\n\n## Curation Tokens SoonTM\n\nIn the near future, **all marketplaces will feature curation tokens** as an incentive to release on a given platform. Tokens enable curators to signal towards which creators (and individual NFTs) are most valuable. Curators that attract the most sales earn the most rewards. \n\nCurators share in a marketplace’s upside by earning tokens or receiving a percentage of sales when a purchase is made through a referral or based on a curator’s delegated stake. This is drastically different from today where fees are captured exclusively by the core team, rather than a global community of tokenholders.\n\nWhen this transition happens, the most active curator (measured by volume and usage) will receive the largest allocations of retroactive airdrops, drastically boosting their signal and curation abilities.\n\nMoving forward, the largest rewards will be captured by those with specialized knowledge of undiscovered talent - essentially playing matchmaker between creator and collector to boost sales on their preferred marketplace(s).\n\nLet’s explore how curation fits into the NFT landscape today.\n\n## The State of NFTs\n\nThe supply of NFTs will outpace the demand. The number of NFTs will grow while the average price per NFT will diminish.\n\nWe’re starting to see this today, with most open editions on Nifty Gateway starting to trade below their primary sale price on the secondary market due to a lack of demand from new buyers and a lack of signal from curators.\n\nThis forces creators to cut through the noise, leading to the formation of micro-economies - or markets that form around specific individuals, brands or creators - for NFTs and their collections.\n\nIn this new world, every creator becomes their own micro-economy. The new race is becoming a majority shareholder in those creator economies through curation.\n\nJust as we see aggressive pushes for majority ownership in a seed-stage company, NFTs unlock these experiments at a more granular level. Access to assets are global and permissionless, and those with a capacity to discover rising talent are able to purchase meaningful pieces of a creator’s micro-economy very early in its lifecycle.\n\n## Community Makes NFTs Valuable\n\nA small percentage of NFTs retain the vast majority of value. Looking to OnlyFans or Medium [as an example](https://twitter.com/iamkoshiek/status/1279753515422953473?s=20), the top 10% of creators will account for 90% of the value.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamludwin/status/1373037695879032834?s=20)\n\nThis places a strong emphasis on community, as NFTs retain and increase their value by [creating a diverse network of curators that share in that collection](https://a16z.com/2021/02/27/nfts-and-a-thousand-true-fans/). **This is the primary reason why CryptoPunks have performed so well**. As the “first NFT”, the CryptoPunk community has ascribed value to specific traits and rarities, so much so that we’re now seeing derivatives like $PUNKS and [social personas](https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT) emerge around it.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/peruggia_v/status/1370258347341934593?s=20)\n\n**Value is directly correlated to the strength of its underlying community.**\n\nCommunity is motivated by intrinsic values like social status and extrinsic values like future upside. It’s a curator’s job to create an ecosystem for both of these motivations to live in harmony.\n\nCommunities like [Friends With Benefits](https://fwb.help/) will soon hold royalty claims on dozens of NFTs. Royalties will be programmatically captured, creating treasuries with lifetime value, no trust required, and no overhead.\n\nThis is why the primary sale of an NFT is not enough to give it long-term value. True value comes from the traction and continued interest around the longevity of specific collections.\n\n## SOCKS Community\n\nLooking at Unisocks, the value of SOCKS spiked 300% in September when Uniswap [announced](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) it was giving 1000 UNI to every address holding 1 SOCKS on September 1st.

This was a relatively quick one, which I don't usually do, so I apologize for sloppier writing than usual.\n\nI thought [this tweet](https://twitter.com/HipCityReg/status/1370839283569938433?s=20) by Reggie was to the point, and maybe the whole thread is interesting to peek at.\n\nBasically, NFTs are about proven ownership of something digital, and what that that unlocks for the owner. Right now, we're in a phase where the main thing people \"unlock\" by owning an NFT is simply the clout or recognition of ownership. So everyone is scrambling to figure out what it might be valuable to own from this point of view: art, tweets, essays, etc. (and who knows, maybe a lot of that is actually right).\n\nMy main point is: I think where things will get interesting is when ownership of an NFT unlocks abilities besides just recognition or resale value to the owner. Of course, recognition and resale value will always be part of owning an NFT, but I don't think it's the full picture.\n\nI like in-game items as an example because it's a clear example of an NFT \"unlocking\" some new ability for the owner. In the case of in-game items, we can get out of the \"NFT as canonical media instance\" world and into a true digital object metaphor. For example, you can have a digital object in your wallet whose metadata contains not just a link to a JPEG, but rather a 3D object file plus some game-relevant attributes like attack power, defense power, etc. This means that any individual game you play could look in your wallet, import that object into its world, and use those attributes within its own combat system.\n\nYou could even imagine scanning your crypto wallet into something like [Gather](https://gather.town/), and then being able to place special items from your wallet inside your digital office. I think these concepts have been well covered by the \"metaverse\" crowd and sci-fi like Ready Player One, so I'll move on.\n\nThen there's also the non-game, non-skeuomorphic versions of NFTs unlocking abilities, where owning an NFT gives you access or permissions in an app that you couldn't otherwise have. \n\ne.g. Can a dev tools startup mint a lifetime API key as an NFT? It's very possible from a technical standpoint: just periodically use the owner's wallet to sign a message in exchange for a temporary access token that gets sent with each API request. If the NFT ever changes hands, only the owner of that wallet would have this ability.\n\nAnd if that's possible, can an API company earn more than the average LTV of a customer by just auctioning off these NFTs and collecting 10% on every resale, instead of doing a monthly subscription? To be seen.\n\nSeveral years from now, I think it's going to feel pretty insane to think that we could never own something digital until recently. The implications of digital ownership are really wide, and I think right now, the general population is overly-indexed on the vision of NFTs as canonical instances of creative work, vs. these more general ideas. I'm not at all a disbeliever in the NFT-as-art vision, I just think it's a small sliver of what will end up happening.\n\nI still believe creativity is a main constraint with this technology (CryptoPunks didn't come out until 2017, though it was possible from day one of Ethereum), and I think having this more open framework for thinking about NFTs can open up a much wider idea space for creative experimentation.", "timestamp": 1616711929, "digest": "2j2iAo4su48mkfZoGWHZCMVkmPi8mE_YOyyMWrNPAX4", "contributor": "0xB0623C91c65621df716aB8aFE5f66656B21A9108"}

We are delighted to share that we've officially closed our first full-stack engineering sprint: the MVP of the Mirror blogging platform. This will allow us to onboard our first writers and serve as the foundation for all the functionality in the future.\n\n[Example](/hey)\n\n[Mirror’s first Tweet](https://twitter.com/viamirror/status/1325856116748726273)\n\n[a16z](https://a16z.com/)\n\nWe have a lot to figure out over the next few months and years—from discovering new crypto-native business models for creators to supporting basic things like embedding NFTs—but we knew that the starting point for the project was supporting a basic publishing experience—the ability to post text and share it with the world. \n\nThis post details our journey so far.\n\n![Season’s Greetings!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bb9a61e1-f524-4135-bae5-91ddf7f0a1e9.jpeg?width=2560&height=1440)\n\nTesting it out\n\n## The Starting Line\n\nOur first commit to the backend API was 29 days ago, on December 7, 2020 — my (Graeme's) first official day at Mirror. Denis had been speaking with [Trent](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/) about announcing his book on Mirror, and working with Jon-Kyle on designs and UI. We set an ambitious goal to have everything working for Trent by Christmas time — our gift to the world! 🎁 \n\n[Steve Reich, Come Out to Show Them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouYiTiiY3vg)\n\nTo ship the MVP, we needed to make crucial early technical decisions. Most importantly, how to create a world-class writing tool with a native web3 and crypto foundation.\n\n## How to Construct a Web3-Native Writing Platform\n\nOne of the first challenges was thinking through building the platform from a web3 perspective. Here are rules of the web3 game (*via negativa* style):\n\n1. Post content shall not be centralized\n2. The reading experience should not require trust in Mirror\n3. Mirror shall not own a writer's domain\n4. Writers do not need to connect their wallets and sign everything they write\n5. Mirror shall not attempt to store Ethereum private keys in the browser!\n6. Writing shall not be excessively expensive (for Mirror or writers)\n7. Bonus: No using email-password signup!\n\nThe architecture we came up with looks something like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ad92c52-5226-40c1-b654-4bbfe905c278.jpeg)\n\nI will now briefly break down how we solved each of these problems.\n\n### 1. Post content shall not be centralized\n\nWe decided to use the **Arweave** data storage protocol to store user content. Arweave provides permanent storage of data for a one-time cost at upload time. The data posted to Arweave includes all of the information required to *retrieve* all entries for a publication (including any changes made), and to *verify* authorship authenticity. (We have plans to publish the protocol specification along with an open-source tool that can assist with this retrieval and verification process, so that it would be trivial to migrate off of Mirror if the time ever comes for that.)\n\n### 2. The reading experience should not require trust in Mirror\n\nAll entries are signed by a user's *signing key* (this is a non-Ethereum keypair that does not contain any direct economic value. I'll explain more on this later). The signature is then published to Arweave, along with the digest that was signed, and with the content that went into the digest. The *signing key* itself is put into a message that asserts authorship rights, which is then signed by the writer's Ethereum address. All of this information is stored on Arweave, along with the entry's content — for every entry and update. Therefore, it's possible (and fairly easy) for anyone to verify whether an entry was authored by a given Ethereum account.\n\nWe're still iterating on this model, and it's obviously very early. Consider us in the \"testnet\" phase of this (along with everything else you read in this post).\n\n### 3. Mirror shall not own a writer's domain\n\nWe use ENS to provide domain ownership to the writer, who claims this ownership by burning an invite token (called $WRITE; expect more information on this soon) during onboarding. The process involves interacting with the $WRITE ERC20 token contract, which grants approval to an ENS registrar contract to burn the token just before registering the ENS label.\n\n### 4. Writers do not need to connect their wallets and sign everything they write\n\nWe didn't want to make it cumbersome to have to write an Entry on Mirror — for example, needing to sign everything with their Ledger wallet (or Metamask). Particularly, because we imagine allowing users to take smaller and more frequent actions, too, like commenting on or liking someone else's entry. We still want to have superb security, but we deemed it to be dissuading if writers required their hardware wallet for writing.\n\n### 5. Mirror shall not attempt to store Ethereum private keys in the browser!\n\nIt's considered heresy to store a user's Ethereum private keys directly in the browser, and I would typically agree with that. It's not strictly true that you *couldn't* build a useful webapp this way (Dharma did it for a while), but the security burden will compound over time. This is mainly because there is no way to make and store a non-extractable Ethereum private key using the native web-crypto library; it doesn't support the same ECDSA curve. I don't know how this will play out in the future, but for now, I would say that this is something to avoid.\n\nWe avoid this security burden in two ways: \n\n1. By using a different signature scheme from the Ethereum implementation (we're using the NIST curve *P-256*), therefore making it impossible for the key to \"hold economic value\" at all, and sidestepping a major issue altogether. The worst case scenario, under the most severe threat model (e.g. a stolen computer), would be fraudulent authorship.\n2. By generating the key using the non-extractable property, and storing it in IndexDB. This means that there's no way to export the private key at all — the private key can only be used to sign content on the webpage in which it is loaded, and IndexDB prevents it from being loaded on any website outside of mirror.xyz.\n\nI invite criticism on this approach. I am not a cryptography expert, and we're just trying to make an honest effort at a secure and usable platform that lives outside of the conventional standards of web2 that have been failing us. If you want a more detailed explanation of the approach, you can refer to an [internal RFC](https://eng.mirror.xyz/1cywoB2BSXKRdJPA26NmH26AvuIbTJ0p8rYf7KaKktc) about this topic, which has now been posted on Mirror.\n\n### 6. Writing shall not be excessively expensive (for Mirror or writers)\n\nSolved by using Arweave! 🎉 Very cheap (at the moment?) — it's costing us about 0.00005 AR per blog post, which amounts to about $0.00015, at the current exchange rate.\n\n### 7. Bonus: No using email-password signup!\n\nSince we have signing keys and a signature-based authenticity model, we don't need to have login sessions, and we don't have anything to recover via email. In the future, it may be useful to allow for email notifications and email digests, but for now, it's interesting that there is no email confirmation required to use Mirror. This is the crypto-native way used by apps like Zerion and Zapper, and is the future of authentication on the web.\n\n(We make up for this lack of friction by adding a transaction confirmation in onboarding! 😂 But even that, we will smooth out over time.)\n\n## Pre-Mainnet Testing\n\nMirror is still in its early stages, and we are using the Ethereum testnet infrastructure to explore our ideas. This allows us to run through complex protocol flows (like burning tokens, deploying contract, and registering ENS domains) very cheaply and with fast confirmation times. In particular, we're still exploring what the *mechanics* of our economic, naming and ownership protocol will be, as demand grows for a more sophisticated system. We're hoping to deploy to mainnet as soon as we know that migrating our early writers to this better protocol will be feasible and easy.\n\n## Building a Backend API as a \"Protocol Gateway\"\n\nIn order to facilitate a good reading and writing experience, we decided to build a backend API that can act as a *gateway* between client and protocol. This allows us to do things like signature verification before publishing to Arweave, or to pay for the Arweave publication ourselves and cache the entry content for extremely fast response-times. This allows us to have a world-class writing and reading experience, while still achieving all of our goals of content decentralization.\n\nIn terms of building this backend API in 2021, there were probably 10+ viable options for where to deploy code and just as many promising languages for its development. Picking early tools can be difficult! I ended up choosing something that was strongly within my realm of competency, and would also be easy for new engineers on our team to learn. I also chose what I believe to be the path of greatest extensibility and flexibility into the future, which for us meant building our backend in **NodeJS on AWS infrastructure**. The decision was not obvious, however, and I wanted to take into account the competencies we would be building as an engineering order in time to come.\n\nSetting up web applications on AWS is much more time consuming than using an abstracted service like Heroku or Vercel. Things like environments, databases, security groups, and deployments all have to be configured up individually. In the long-run, though, it grants more control, and this can be helpful for crypto applications that sometimes had non-standard concerns. It took me about 2 days to set up this infrastructure — including security groups, IAM accounts, databases, staging and production environments, etc. But from here, I know that I have the world's best infrastructure behind us, without the platform risk of newer, less fully-featured services.\n\nWe use **Postgres via AWS's RDS service**, and VPC and security groups for communicating between **ElasticBeanstalk** and RDS. We used **GraphQL with Apollo** for our API endpoints.\n\nI'll note here that, for a while before committing to this path, I considered using writing the backend in Golang or Rust, and protobufs, since cryptographic signatures require strict typing for correct validation across platforms. But I know that development would have been *a lot slower* if we had gone this path. On the other hand, building a competency in Rust from the start would have allowed us to track the growing number of interesting layer-2 integrations (which seems promising).\n\nOur deployments are handled through **Github workflows**, such that every push to our *staging* or *main* triggers an action on Github that deploys the application. To be clear, there is a *lot* that still needs to be improved here — including blocking deploys on test suites passing, and measuring test coverage. We don't have full integration tests, e.g. against a built docker contains with exposed GraphQL endpoints.\n\n![The genesis entry](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7c3c118d-8dda-4f5d-9e80-6df764fd403c.jpeg)\n\n## Building a Frontend for Blogging\n\nWe decided to use Vercel and NextJS on the frontend, which has wildcard subdomain support, as well as support for statically rendered content. This has been great so far, because we get fast-loading, well-cached content that can be read easily by machines like social media platforms and search engines. It's also generally a fantastic product for managing staging environments, deployments, etc.\n\n## What went well?\n\nWe were able to get an MVP out *really* really quickly — we made a goal to ship before Christmas, and only started building the backend some ways into December. So overall, it took us mere weeks to build a novel CMS that uses public-private key signatures to verify content, stores data in Postgres, stores data on Arweave, burns a token on Ethereum to claim ownership of an ENS label, validates ownership of that label, iterations on our signing model, and so on. \n\nHere's a few specific examples of these things:\n\n1. The first blog post by Trent: [https://stateful.mirror.xyz/a151ee1decb2028a8bb48277f6928c6f38319c32601dc1da1ee82acfcad2e525](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/a151ee1decb2028a8bb48277f6928c6f38319c32601dc1da1ee82acfcad2e525)\n2. A transaction that burns a $WRITE token and claims an ENS domain: [https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x29b9d13187a2db64b7d85f4ff5be739729b07404fd1f5fce79b3bba13da7530b](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x29b9d13187a2db64b7d85f4ff5be739729b07404fd1f5fce79b3bba13da7530b)\n3. An Arweave transaction that stores Linda's [post](https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d) forever, along with signatures that prove authorship: [https://viewblock.io/arweave/tx/WvwsHyKCjfkLoKNbNSGfoV-vaWrJa2PMYB_c3wucXUA](https://viewblock.io/arweave/tx/WvwsHyKCjfkLoKNbNSGfoV-vaWrJa2PMYB_c3wucXUA)\n\nIt's exhausting even to think back through the past month and everything we've been able to build out! And the fact that this is *basically working* is very fun and exciting. I'm glad that we also did a fair amount of this \"in public\" and have screen recording our on-boarding sessions.\n\n## What went wrong?\n\nBy tackling so many challenges at once, it sometimes felt like there were an overwhelming number of important issues that urgently needed to be patched. Sometimes, that made it difficult for me to communicate priorities in linear way, so that we were all on the same page and rationally working together on the same thing. Given that that team hadn't worked together before this project, and are just learning about each of our distinct work and communication styles, there was considerable \"under-communication\" that we need to improve on.\n\nThe fast pace also created some disorder. For example, late one Thursday I was configuring the Github Workflows to deploy our AWS EB environment, and it was working well in staging. We didn't deploy to production over the weekend, and during that time I updated production to a whole new AWS EB environment. Our first deploy on Monday shipped to the *outdated* environment, and a bug manifested right before an [onboarding session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e9Fcf0DiOE)! We had to roll-back to prevent live-streaming a failed onboarding, and it was very confusing! We wrote our first post-mortem for this.\n\n## What lessons were learned?\n\nWe learned that we can really push hard and work quickly to make an ambitious goal a reality within a short timeframe. I think we proved that by hitting the December 25th deadline.\n\nWe also learned a lot about each each and our competencies (there's only three of us), and how we need to communicate with each other to build more trust and confidence in how things are going. That includes over-communicating more about expectations and responsibilities over the codebase and product, outstanding issues, priorities, and individual goals for any given sprint.\n\nExpect more information on $WRITE soon.\n\nIn the meantime, you can read the first entries published on Mirror over the past few weeks:\n\n- [https://stateful.mirror.xyz/](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/) by [@trent_vanepps](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps)\n- [http://amorfati.mirror.xyz/](http://amorfati.mirror.xyz/) by [@apruden08](https://twitter.com/apruden08)\n- [https://joonian.mirror.xyz/](https://joonian.mirror.xyz/) by [@joonian](https://twitter.com/joonian)\n- [https://helloshreyas.mirror.xyz/](https://helloshreyas.mirror.xyz/) by [@HelloShreyas](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas)\n- [https://g.mirror.xyz/](https://g.mirror.xyz/) by [@strangechances](https://twitter.com/strangechances)\n- [https://d.mirror.xyz/](https://d.mirror.xyz/) by [@Iiterature](https://twitter.com/Iiterature)", "timestamp": 1616712444, "digest": "B32AHYVIlCf20jjOc7ebm3dv1W7KIBjdw9JB93z3gKY", "contributor": "0x841fF85B6873d7bfB712C8f7A347C774355b6EC3"}

We are delighted to share that we've officially closed our first full-stack engineering sprint: the MVP of the Mirror blogging platform. This will allow us to onboard our first writers and serve as the foundation for all the functionality in the future.\n\nhey [Example](/hey)\n\n[Mirror’s first Tweet](https://twitter.com/viamirror/status/1325856116748726273)\n\n[a16z](https://a16z.com/)\n\nWe have a lot to figure out over the next few months and years—from discovering new crypto-native business models for creators to supporting basic things like embedding NFTs—but we knew that the starting point for the project was supporting a basic publishing experience—the ability to post text and share it with the world. \n\nThis post details our journey so far.\n\n![Season’s Greetings!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bb9a61e1-f524-4135-bae5-91ddf7f0a1e9.jpeg?width=2560&height=1440)\n\nTesting it out\n\n## The Starting Line\n\nOur first commit to the backend API was 29 days ago, on December 7, 2020 — my (Graeme's) first official day at Mirror. Denis had been speaking with [Trent](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/) about announcing his book on Mirror, and working with Jon-Kyle on designs and UI. We set an ambitious goal to have everything working for Trent by Christmas time — our gift to the world! 🎁 \n\n[Steve Reich, Come Out to Show Them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouYiTiiY3vg)\n\nTo ship the MVP, we needed to make crucial early technical decisions. Most importantly, how to create a world-class writing tool with a native web3 and crypto foundation.\n\n## How to Construct a Web3-Native Writing Platform\n\nOne of the first challenges was thinking through building the platform from a web3 perspective. Here are rules of the web3 game (*via negativa* style):\n\n1. Post content shall not be centralized\n2. The reading experience should not require trust in Mirror\n3. Mirror shall not own a writer's domain\n4. Writers do not need to connect their wallets and sign everything they write\n5. Mirror shall not attempt to store Ethereum private keys in the browser!\n6. Writing shall not be excessively expensive (for Mirror or writers)\n7. Bonus: No using email-password signup!\n\nThe architecture we came up with looks something like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ad92c52-5226-40c1-b654-4bbfe905c278.jpeg)\n\nI will now briefly break down how we solved each of these problems.\n\n### 1. Post content shall not be centralized\n\nWe decided to use the **Arweave** data storage protocol to store user content. Arweave provides permanent storage of data for a one-time cost at upload time. The data posted to Arweave includes all of the information required to *retrieve* all entries for a publication (including any changes made), and to *verify* authorship authenticity. (We have plans to publish the protocol specification along with an open-source tool that can assist with this retrieval and verification process, so that it would be trivial to migrate off of Mirror if the time ever comes for that.)\n\n### 2. The reading experience should not require trust in Mirror\n\nAll entries are signed by a user's *signing key* (this is a non-Ethereum keypair that does not contain any direct economic value. I'll explain more on this later). The signature is then published to Arweave, along with the digest that was signed, and with the content that went into the digest. The *signing key* itself is put into a message that asserts authorship rights, which is then signed by the writer's Ethereum address. All of this information is stored on Arweave, along with the entry's content — for every entry and update. Therefore, it's possible (and fairly easy) for anyone to verify whether an entry was authored by a given Ethereum account.\n\nWe're still iterating on this model, and it's obviously very early. Consider us in the \"testnet\" phase of this (along with everything else you read in this post).\n\n### 3. Mirror shall not own a writer's domain\n\nWe use ENS to provide domain ownership to the writer, who claims this ownership by burning an invite token (called $WRITE; expect more information on this soon) during onboarding. The process involves interacting with the $WRITE ERC20 token contract, which grants approval to an ENS registrar contract to burn the token just before registering the ENS label.\n\n### 4. Writers do not need to connect their wallets and sign everything they write\n\nWe didn't want to make it cumbersome to have to write an Entry on Mirror — for example, needing to sign everything with their Ledger wallet (or Metamask). Particularly, because we imagine allowing users to take smaller and more frequent actions, too, like commenting on or liking someone else's entry. We still want to have superb security, but we deemed it to be dissuading if writers required their hardware wallet for writing.\n\n### 5. Mirror shall not attempt to store Ethereum private keys in the browser!\n\nIt's considered heresy to store a user's Ethereum private keys directly in the browser, and I would typically agree with that. It's not strictly true that you *couldn't* build a useful webapp this way (Dharma did it for a while), but the security burden will compound over time. This is mainly because there is no way to make and store a non-extractable Ethereum private key using the native web-crypto library; it doesn't support the same ECDSA curve. I don't know how this will play out in the future, but for now, I would say that this is something to avoid.\n\nWe avoid this security burden in two ways: \n\n1. By using a different signature scheme from the Ethereum implementation (we're using the NIST curve *P-256*), therefore making it impossible for the key to \"hold economic value\" at all, and sidestepping a major issue altogether. The worst case scenario, under the most severe threat model (e.g. a stolen computer), would be fraudulent authorship.\n2. By generating the key using the non-extractable property, and storing it in IndexDB. This means that there's no way to export the private key at all — the private key can only be used to sign content on the webpage in which it is loaded, and IndexDB prevents it from being loaded on any website outside of mirror.xyz.\n\nI invite criticism on this approach. I am not a cryptography expert, and we're just trying to make an honest effort at a secure and usable platform that lives outside of the conventional standards of web2 that have been failing us. If you want a more detailed explanation of the approach, you can refer to an [internal RFC](https://eng.mirror.xyz/1cywoB2BSXKRdJPA26NmH26AvuIbTJ0p8rYf7KaKktc) about this topic, which has now been posted on Mirror.\n\n### 6. Writing shall not be excessively expensive (for Mirror or writers)\n\nSolved by using Arweave! 🎉 Very cheap (at the moment?) — it's costing us about 0.00005 AR per blog post, which amounts to about $0.00015, at the current exchange rate.\n\n### 7.

In the future, it may be useful to allow for email notifications and email digests, but for now, it's interesting that there is no email confirmation required to use Mirror. This is the crypto-native way used by apps like Zerion and Zapper, and is the future of authentication on the web.\n\n(We make up for this lack of friction by adding a transaction confirmation in onboarding! 😂 But even that, we will smooth out over time.)\n\n## Pre-Mainnet Testing\n\nMirror is still in its early stages, and we are using the Ethereum testnet infrastructure to explore our ideas.

This was a relatively quick one, which I don't usually do, so I apologize for sloppier writing than usual.\n\nI thought [this tweet](https://twitter.com/HipCityReg/status/1370839283569938433?s=20) by Reggie was to the point, and maybe the whole thread is interesting to peek at.\n\nBasically, NFTs are about proven ownership of something digital, and what that that unlocks for the owner. Right now, we're in a phase where the main thing people \"unlock\" by owning an NFT is simply the clout or recognition of ownership. So everyone is scrambling to figure out what it might be valuable to own from this point of view: art, tweets, essays, etc. (and who knows, maybe a lot of that is actually right).\n\nMy main point is: I think where things will get interesting is when ownership of an NFT unlocks abilities besides just recognition or resale value to the owner. Of course, recognition and resale value will always be part of owning an NFT, but I don't think it's the full picture.\n\nI like in-game items as an example because it's a clear example of an NFT \"unlocking\" some new ability for the owner. In the case of in-game items, we can get out of the \"NFT as canonical media instance\" world and into a true digital object metaphor. For example, you can have a digital object in your wallet whose metadata contains not just a link to a JPEG, but rather a 3D object file plus some game-relevant attributes like attack power, defense power, etc. This means that any individual game you play could look in your wallet, import that object into its world, and use those attributes within its own combat system.\n\nYou could even imagine scanning your crypto wallet into something like [Gather](https://gather.town/), and then being able to place special items from your wallet inside your digital office. I think these concepts have been well covered by the \"metaverse\" crowd and sci-fi like Ready Player One, so I'll move on.\n\nThen there's also the non-game, non-skeuomorphic versions of NFTs unlocking abilities, where owning an NFT gives you access or permissions in an app that you couldn't otherwise have. \n\ne.g. Can a dev tools startup mint a lifetime API key as an NFT? It's very possible from a technical standpoint: just periodically use the owner's wallet to sign a message in exchange for a temporary access token that gets sent with each API request. If the NFT ever changes hands, only the owner of that wallet would have this ability.\n\nAnd if that's possible, can an API company earn more than the average LTV of a customer by just auctioning off these NFTs and collecting 10% on every resale, instead of doing a monthly subscription? To be seen.\n\nSeveral years from now, I think it's going to feel pretty insane to think that we could never own something digital until recently ([Wilson](https://twitter.com/WilsonCusack) said this to me recently and it stuck). The implications of digital ownership are really wide, and I think right now, the general population is overly-indexed on the vision of NFTs as canonical instances of creative work, vs. these more general ideas. I'm not at all a disbeliever in the NFT-as-art vision, I just think it's a small sliver of what will end up happening.\n\nI still believe creativity is a main constraint with this technology (CryptoPunks didn't come out until 2017, though it was possible from day one of Ethereum), and I think having this more open framework for thinking about NFTs can open up a much wider idea space for creative experimentation.", "timestamp": 1616712596, "digest": "2j2iAo4su48mkfZoGWHZCMVkmPi8mE_YOyyMWrNPAX4", "contributor": "0xB0623C91c65621df716aB8aFE5f66656B21A9108"}
{"id": "FA9XI5zfOQDgD15kJkEBO3lVlPD9RMW5XWnh_TjaOto", "title": "NFT Value Capture Equation", "body": "Last month, I set out to explore one question: **where do NFTs capture value?**\n\nThis is not a thesis on what makes NFTs valuable, it assumes you already understand [why scarce, permanent, ownable digital content has value](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo).\n\nInstead, we’ll use this essay to explore the NFT stack, breaking down the various layers as we hone in on one in particular - **curation**.\n\n![$VALUE](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7785e8b8-032f-4012-8330-f50f5e57db78.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n## Analyzing the NFT Stack\n\nNFTs flow through a number of layers from creation to collection. Baked within this stack are dozens of platforms, many of which are covered in my first Mirror post on the [NFT issuance landscape](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/PF42Z9oE_r6yhZN9jZrrseXfHaZALj9JIfMplshlgQ0).\n\n![NFT Stack](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7ae6c2ab-7632-4e6c-a2cf-490462eb4086.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nEvery NFT is issued on a blockchain through a process called minting. There are different means of minting, but the end result is creating a token that conforms to a certain NFT schema ([ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155), or [zNFT](https://github.com/ourzora/core#architecture)).\n\nOnce minted, NFTs can move seamlessly between marketplaces and applications, just like a cryptocurrency can move between exchanges and wallets. Oftentimes, decisions for what marketplace to release on are based on the structure of the NFT sale, including nuances like editions vs 1/1s (more on this in my next post).fg\n\n## Curation Tokens SoonTM\n\nIn the near future, **all marketplaces will feature curation tokens** as an incentive to release on a given platform. Tokens enable curators to signal towards which creators (and individual NFTs) are most valuable. Curators that attract the most sales earn the most rewards. \n\nCurators share in a marketplace’s upside by earning tokens or receiving a percentage of sales when a purchase is made through a referral or based on a curator’s delegated stake. This is drastically different from today where fees are captured exclusively by the core team, rather than a global community of tokenholders.\n\nWhen this transition happens, the most active curator (measured by volume and usage) will receive the largest allocations of retroactive airdrops, drastically boosting their signal and curation abilities.\n\nMoving forward, the largest rewards will be captured by those with specialized knowledge of undiscovered talent - essentially playing matchmaker between creator and collector to boost sales on their preferred marketplace(s).\n\nLet’s explore how curation fits into the NFT landscape today.\n\n## The State of NFTs\n\nThe supply of NFTs will outpace the demand. The number of NFTs will grow while the average price per NFT will diminish.\n\nWe’re starting to see this today, with most open editions on Nifty Gateway starting to trade below their primary sale price on the secondary market due to a lack of demand from new buyers and a lack of signal from curators.\n\nThis forces creators to cut through the noise, leading to the formation of micro-economies - or markets that form around specific individuals, brands or creators - for NFTs and their collections.\n\nIn this new world, every creator becomes their own micro-economy. The new race is becoming a majority shareholder in those creator economies through curation.\n\nJust as we see aggressive pushes for majority ownership in a seed-stage company, NFTs unlock these experiments at a more granular level. Access to assets are global and permissionless, and those with a capacity to discover rising talent are able to purchase meaningful pieces of a creator’s micro-economy very early in its lifecycle.\n\n## Community Makes NFTs Valuable\n\nA small percentage of NFTs retain the vast majority of value. Looking to OnlyFans or Medium [as an example](https://twitter.com/iamkoshiek/status/1279753515422953473?s=20), the top 10% of creators will account for 90% of the value.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamludwin/status/1373037695879032834?s=20)\n\nThis places a strong emphasis on community, as NFTs retain and increase their value by [creating a diverse network of curators that share in that collection](https://a16z.com/2021/02/27/nfts-and-a-thousand-true-fans/). **This is the primary reason why CryptoPunks have performed so well**. As the “first NFT”, the CryptoPunk community has ascribed value to specific traits and rarities, so much so that we’re now seeing derivatives like $PUNKS and [social personas](https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT) emerge around it.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/peruggia_v/status/1370258347341934593?s=20)\n\n**Value is directly correlated to the strength of its underlying community.**\n\nCommunity is motivated by intrinsic values like social status and extrinsic values like future upside. It’s a curator’s job to create an ecosystem for both of these motivations to live in harmony.\n\nCommunities like [Friends With Benefits](https://fwb.help/) will soon hold royalty claims on dozens of NFTs. Royalties will be programmatically captured, creating treasuries with lifetime value, no trust required, and no overhead.\n\nThis is why the primary sale of an NFT is not enough to give it long-term value. True value comes from the traction and continued interest around the longevity of specific collections.\n\n## SOCKS Community\n\nLooking at Unisocks, the value of SOCKS spiked 300% in September when Uniswap [announced](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) it was giving 1000 UNI to every address holding 1 SOCKS on September 1st. (fun fact: I sold here - RIP)\n\nSince then, SOCKS has seen no new utility, but has increased nearly 150x in price to its current value of ~$100k/pair. While SOCKS are a fungible ERC20 token, the value of the NFTs a user received when redeeming SOCKS is now [averaged](https://opensea.io/assets/0x65770b5283117639760bea3f867b69b3697a91dd/20) to be about 12.5 ETH.\n\n![SOCKS on OpenSea](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f0fbd3de-fab8-4efc-ba0c-27cb6828145b.jpeg?height=690&width=1600)\n\nAs one of the first “collectibles”, SOCKS holders have described holding the token as a “spiritual experience”. Certain holders are even having SOCKS only dinners for fellow diamond hands.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/lay2000lbs/status/1366167992279719938?s=20)\n\n**This goes to show that the value of NFTs comes from the shared collectible experience within a community.**\n\nAnd how do you incubate this spirit? **By working with curators**.\n\n## Curation is Key\n\nCurators decide which NFTs have value, and which do not.\n\nCurators signal to value and offer services like distribution and strategy to enhance that value.\n\n> Without curators - there is no market for NFTs and therefore, no value.\n\n![Curation Landscape](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3e51631e-6913-4d18-a486-86746a54ab55.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nGroups like [Flamingo](https://flamingodao.xyz/collection) and Gremlins curate and collect together. They share information about which artists and drops are most relevant and collaborate to form markets (and buzz) around them.\n\nAgencies like [Six](https://twitter.com/sixnft) curate NFT strategies, exchanging a percentage of sales in exchange for distribution channels, administrative overhead, and a seal of approval to facilitate successful drops.\n\nWe’re now seeing creators bundle premium services to build deeper relationships with their superfans - specifically to empower and incubate their biggest curators.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1367875874889031690?s=20)\n\nWhat’s unique about NFT curators is that their value is often democratized among its community.\n\n## Case Study: WHALE\n\n[Whaleshark](https://twitter.com/WhaleShark_Pro) democratized ownership of his famous NFT collection through a social token called WHALE.\n\nOperating on the back of a WHALE DAO, all decisions around the governance of his NFTs rest in the hands of WHALE holders.\n\nWhile the collection has been rather passive since launch, Whaleshark has suggested that the project will move towards more market participation in the near future. This includes taking a portion of profits from NFT sales to conduct WHALE buy-backs.\n\nLooking at Whaleshark as a curator, WHALE is a direct way to participate in the upside of his NFT collection. Because that collection is backed by an avid community sharing in the likeness of the WHALE DAO, it has long-term value. \n\nPlus, operational structures, WHALE salaries and [quarterly reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec9lXMsk_f4&ab_channel=WhaleCommunity) are just some of the icing on the cake that show why Whaleshark has become a leading curator in the NFT stack today.\n\n![WHALE Topshot](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f7734027-eb7f-440d-807b-84dc48a9a032.jpeg?height=900&width=1600)\n\n![WHALE Vault](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/28eb2810-9ef4-4d87-b28c-8d4bb523e094.jpeg?height=288&width=512)\n\n## How to Curate Today\n\nAs Creator DAOs and Sub-DAOs start to pop up around collections like NBA Top Shots or CryptoPunks, so too will the opportunity to participate in those collectives.\n\nGroups like [The First Mint](https://twitter.com/TheFirstMint) are currently working with social token incubator [Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq) to build out a blueprint for their community-first launch. \n\nAs a curator, this provides an opportunity to incubate community around new NFTs. Those that control the community control the power. **After all, the best way to grow a community is to make them rich**.\n\nThe best way to invest in the curation layer is by backing the early experiments positioning themselves as curators. Most curators will find ways to offer basket exposure to their underlying collection. **Own a part of that basket**.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/WhaleShark_Pro/status/1375100298419527681?s=20)\n\nWhen valuing a curator, look for the following:\n\n- Which collections do they own a significant portion of?\n- Were they early to these collections, or late movers?\n- Do they have the ability to influence a new collection, or simply follow on?\n- Does the curator have strong leadership?\n- Are there plans to democratize access to their collection?\n\nThe best curators are those with a strong capacity to influence the next CryptoPunks. Look deeper than a curator touting purchase prices, and instead focus on those crate digging to capture significant market share in an undiscovered collection.\n\nIn case you were wondering, here’s why.\n\n![Nifty Portfolios](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64620cc2-082e-4256-9321-ecf612a8c254.jpeg?height=608&width=985)\n\n## The Rise of the Micro-Economies\n\nThe best curators are [not traditional venture investment vehicles](https://twitter.com/pridesai/status/1365437530842218497?s=20). They are the individuals, groups and communities organizing around new collections using shared capital to incubate rising talent.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1374101538734448641?s=20)\n\nWhile the focus is currently on NFTs, the next chapter of curation is fungible tokens. Similar to WHALE or FWB, curators will offer democratized access to their collections, and give all participants a way to capture their upside.\n\nCurators will grow their community treasury to feature a diverse pool of NFTs, ETH to invest, social token partnerships, and curation tokens from marketplace rewards. **In theory, curation treasuries could be the most diverse in all of crypto.**\n\nIf you’re looking to deploy capital into NFTs, look no further than the curators.\n\n**The hardest part is going to be getting accepted.**\n\n---\n\nSpecial thanks Variant for inspiring this post and to Whaleshark, John Palmer, Alex Zhang and Carlos Gomes for their feedback.\n\nThe owner of this NFT will receive:\n\n- A first look at all my future Mirror pieces before they go live. \n- A one hour working session to dive deeper into this thesis, and explore the rising players, trends and projects worth keeping an eye on. \n- 60 [FWB Pro](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/friends-with-benefits-pro) - good for access to [Friends With Benefits](https://fwb.help/) Season Two.\n\nThe link below shows where the $VALUE NFT lives on Zora. \n\nPlease only bid in WETH as to ensure backers can redeem their $VALUE!\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7/662)", "timestamp": 1616716323, "digest": "A16NP2XXi9RdHptfdF9WHR0Xq_E1XDmUgMwPmJYOG7w", "contributor": "0x46301F7E700Be9cFfCE3e5e142a2244Df3f2d4F2"}
