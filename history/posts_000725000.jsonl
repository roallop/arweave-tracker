{"id": "cOwm0QOwlj2fpLXQKbyNRnEIV_-JYOY7TvHfxAgW-Mk", "title": "Introducing Historians DAO", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e70c8e9d-b93b-4e88-81fc-9ac584ab66e7.png?height=930&width=1600)\n\n$HASH has since grown from its debut a few months back into a project well beyond just collectible generative art. Highlighted in an earlier [post](https://pob.mirror.xyz/3Os_kduyxwC9hjqCDjV4LMPKZ-4RrkYW64m5i5iYNcc), we have broad ambitions for $HASH to be a community driven effort to archive + curate Ethereum history. To that effort, we have enabled users to add 'annotations' to $HASH NFTs, allowing the story captured in each txhash to spill into the $HASH-verse.\n\n![Annotations populate on other NFT platforms](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/706f6462-3c55-4dc2-92dc-fb9720eb76dd.png?height=1456&width=2142)\n\nAnnotations, today, are largely created because of owners intentions to enrich their own $HASH NFTs. Self-annotation has worked well with about 800 annotations already written by the community, but does leave for some undesired effects. Owners can maliciously write annotations that suggest the $HASH represents something it doesn't. The interpretations of history can be vague or dubious due to lack of due diligence.\n\nAlso, the high barrier of entry to writing $HASH annotations presents an issue for growing $HASH to a broader audience. Writers of annotations typically need deep know-how of reading Ethereum transactions and context of the happenings around the transaction to write a good annotation. As the Ethereum space grows, $HASH will become harder and harder to grok as the history it captures become more nuanced.\n\nThinking deeply about how we can address the issues, it became clear that we need to find ways to **incentivize the specialization of archiving and writing about Ethereum history.** i.e we need a class of community members that act as **historians**.\n\nEnter the [Historians DAO](https://hash.pob.studio/historians), a group of historians that will work together to establish the accuracy of annotations.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5d037397-c099-4bbd-ad12-110ed460c2b4.png?height=526&width=1361)\n\nThe DAO will be granted powers within the $HASH community to voice their opinion upon the accuracy of annotations created by users. The members of the DAO will deliberate amongst each other and form verdicts that will be propagated throughout the $HASH-verse. Such deliberation and actions are all public, found on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/x4SH5pGgvj).\n\nWith the DAO, we can create a flywheel of specialization and reputation building for historians. As historians voice their verdict on the quality of annotations, they become subject-matter experts and build their reputation. As they continue to build their presence as a historian, their reputation and the DAO's reputation grows, and their verdicts become ever more important in the $HASH-verse.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f628a114-d00b-4c37-ae5f-41ae9dbc70a1.png?height=1754&width=3490)\n\nAs the flywheel of expertise + reputations builds, we believe an economic layer can be created in the near future where historians' skills and experience can be contracted out (write the annotation for owners or help hunt for txns). As it becomes more and more economically feasibly to be a historian, they are empowered to develop their expertise and continue to build their reputation. \n\n---\n\nTo begin this flywheel, we have onboarded the inaugural group of historians; chosen by POB studios because of their contribution and interest in the $HASH project since its debut. We believe they have the right intentions and ambitions to see through the vision described earlier.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d43d7f65-d190-4fa2-93d9-924b4373d2ae.png?height=1596&width=2744)\n\nThey will be working together to adjudicate $HASH annotations via the 'verdict' model, inspired by traditional tribunal decision making bodies. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17de7df1-bea1-40d5-9199-4087a3b11635.png?height=2416&width=4808)\n\nAny historian can write their 'opinion' on a specific $HASH annotation. If a historian disagrees with the opinion, they can abstain from 'upvoting' the opinion and write a competing 'opinion' on the same annotation. Like the US supreme court deciding upon cases, a majority and dissenting 'opinion' can both coexist. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/654147ec-f65f-449e-8e7b-d664d5786b9c.png?height=844&width=924)\n\nWhenever an 'opinion' reaches the threshold of votes, which is currently set at simple majority of the historians in the DAO, it can be submitted on-chain and distributed as the canonical opinion provided by the $HASH historians DAO. \n\nWe hope this model enables $HASH historians to develop their own norms and precedent when adjudicating annotations. They can scope their own jurisdiction as a judicial body and rely on specific opinions written for other annotations as precedent when deciding to take on new 'cases'. This is left entirely left up to the historians to decide how best to build their reputation within the community.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/51d045f9-209d-44be-809b-a9437250d01f.png?height=476&width=2682)\n\nAs of now, the DAO can issue opinions with two broad options: 'verified' or 'disputed'. A 'verified' verdict from an opinion would imply the accuracy of the annotation. A disputed verdict would suggest a factual inconsistency found by the historians. In the future, decided by the historians, they can create new options as to what their opinion is saying. For example, a 'plagiarized' verdict can be used to help black list annotations that are found to be copied from somewhere else and taken as their own writing. \n\nBecause opinions can work against the annotation writer's intention, we allow anybody to submit the opinion (once it reaches the vote threshold) to the blockchain. This means that if the owner has no intention to submit the verdict on-chain, another figure can do so for the benefit of the community. Currently POB studios is doing just that for those unique cases.\n\nWith the inaugural historian DAO, we hope that this body of experts can work to net-benefit the $HASH-verse as well as build their reputation. As the community grows, we can see the DAO grow to accommodate the demands. \n\nLike many traditional judicial systems, the historians DAO can appoint historians to lower 'courts' where they have a scoped jurisdiction. These lower courts can specialize in specific histories like 'NFT trades', 'Defi history', 'Hacks' and offer their opinion. If their opinion is disagreed upon by the writer or owner of the $HASH NFT, the DAO can create an appeals process to bring the case to a higher court. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fea3811e-bf01-4938-b691-d0ce502065fa.png?height=2186&width=3490)\n\nWe are largely leaving these ambitions for a future date to explore and develop. For now, we will have one sitting panel of historians working on all spans of history. \n\n## FAQ\n\n**How do I get a verdict for my $HASH?**\n\nAs of right now, there is no formal process to ask for a verdict. You will need to go on discord (channel #request-verdict) and ask for a $HASH historian to write one for you. We will largely leave this to the historians to figure out what is the best way to take requests. \n\n**What happens if I get a disputed verdict?**\n\nIf you receive a disputed verdict, you can take their input and correct your annotation and resubmit for a new verdict. \n\n**Are historians economically compensated?**\n\nAs of now no, we are exploring economic layers in the $HASH ecosystem to incentivize their continued work. For now, we hope that the intentions of reputation building is enough. We are working actively to create the right economic/token alignment for the DAO.\n\n**How can historians be added or removed?**\n\nCurrently the DAO members will largely decide on the membership requirements. In the future, we may give this right to decide membership to $HASH holders. \n\n**Can historians be wrong with their verdict?**\n\nAbsolutely, there is no economic model to prevent it in the same way that a court doesn't decide upon absolute accuracy but instead on the interpretations of prior art and experience. We chose the inaugural members because they have showed the skills and interest to be a historian. \n\n---\n\nWe are super excited about the [Historians DAO](https://hash.pob.studio/historians), it is a key first step towards building $HASH as the library of Ethereum. With this, there is a TON more ambition for growing the DAO to come and we are excited to share those features with you in the future. For now, we hope this DAO will kickstart a critical need in the community: deciding upon the accuracy of $HASH history.\n\n", "timestamp": 1626026609, "digest": "viCa_nhTUcCuu5kqBhtlLK6JG3o_n5oKi3cODvKaN-8", "contributor": "0x9428ca8b5fe52C33BD0BD7222d719d788B6467F4"}

{"id": "NL5SG3wQvcp79K2qeGaVuaDtA6DhnJlXCUqHyI6NtGE", "title": "FISH IN LAKE - A GFOTY Analysis", "body": "![FISH IN LAKE is the lead single of GFOTY's upcoming album, Femmedorm.](https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/440x440/https%3a%2f%2fimages.genius.com%2f1d164d1ddae4a276d2e27b47df31f383.1000x1000x1.jpg)\n\n\nGFOTY's lead single from her upcoming album, Femmedorm, continues examining a thematic trend of her music: consumerism and commodification. While GFOTY's music is stylistically rooted in clean production and ultra-accessible rhythmic and lyrical patterns, this song in particular is overt about its rhetorical and artistic intentions. The title, FISH IN LAKE, serves a couple purposes that illuminate the song's narrative and focus: firstly, being a FISH IN LAKE can be seen as the alternative to being a \"fish out of water.\" GFOTY emphasizes that a particular fish is in its element—it feels at home and natural. Throughout the song, the fish in question represents multiple subjects in consumptive relationships. GFOTY continuously confuses the consumer with the consumed, leaving the listener wondering which role she plays in a consumptive relationship and encouraging them to question which role they occupy, poking fun at the idea that one can be a fish in a lake, or a person in the right place, when they're not even sure who they are or what role they're meant to fill. Secondly, GFOTY uses the idea of a FISH IN LAKE to contrast the potential naturalness of a subject with alternative perceptual framings, namely presentations as prepared meals.\n\nIn the opening verse, GFOTY quickly transitions from one role to the next, beginning as a cook who prepares food goods (*Would you like to come and taste my food / Tasty just for you / I made this plate specially for you*) before commodifying herself (*Tell me I'm your type / The candles are low, I'm wearing red / Stay with me tonight*). She then entices the listener into consumption by presenting the narrative that she is also a consumer, promising that she will consume alongside the listener (*We can wash up another time / Eat with me all night).*\n\nThis introduction makes apparent the variety of roles to be played in consumption. One can make and consume goods, as in the case of food, but one can also commodify the self, rendering oneself the object of consumption. Finally, an entire consumption relationship can itself become a product that can be subject to a new meta-consumptive dynamic. While the making and consuming food is a natural and necessary human relationship with consumption, GFOTY juxtaposes this consumptive mode with the more complex relationships in order to guide the listener to identify potential problems with the continuing process of commodification and consumption. It's unclear whether GFOTY's treatment of her self in the first verse truly constitutes commodification, and that lack of clarity is what makes the commentary interesting. While the lyrics imply a sexual or at least romantic relationship that is not inherently rooted in commodification, it is situated in a way that calls into question the nature of the consumptive dynamic. \n\nThere is no shortage of ways to commodify the self: one can bargain with their body, their social connections, their money, and more, offering benefits to be used by others. By placing an innocent and visceral narrative of human connection within a stream of consumption-based scenarios, GFOTY questions whether such relationships can ever be truly innocent and uncommodified against the backdrop of a consumption-obsessed society. She asks to what extent consumptive dynamics have encroached upon our personal lives and relationships and robbed us of more natural expressive or connection-based interaction. \n\nThe closing lines of the first verse entail separate indictments of consumerist culture. Her insistence on delaying consideration of the repercussions of consumption (*We can wash up another time*) could be a commentary on the environmental implications of consumption, for example, which are often ignored or underestimated by both consumers and producers. She may also be referring to personal or social consequences. GFOTY further explores this idea in verse two. The closing line of verse one are an acknowledgement of the complexity of consumption, where the interactions explored in verse one are collapsed into their own experiential product. Here, GFOTY identifies that entire experiences, even ones that already contain a variety of consumptive dynamics themselves, can be commodified into a singular product that can be bought, sold, and consumed. The universe of consumption experiences here is vast, but some recent examples include internet trends like mukbangs and unboxings, where the content product to be observed is simply a performance of consumption. By extending this commodification further, we can acknowledge that we are consuming the song, thus continuing the consumptive chain—perhaps GFOTY aims to comment on the necessity of commodifying oneself to find success as an artist. The relationships are inescapable and infinitely complex.\n\nIn the second verse, GFOTY expands on her exposition of consumptive tendencies as short-sighted. Her consumption becomes unhinged as she veraciously devours (*Would you like to wipe my mouth for me? / Dribble on my sleeve).* GFOTY's artistry consistently delivers sexual undertones that are particularly obvious as she convinces and commands the listener (*I know that you're hungry for my treats / Come and suck them up*). While she doesn't explicitly explore the intersection of sexuality and commodification, this undertone invites the listener to consider how sex can be commodified through fetish, whether behavioral or product-oriented.\n\nThe end of verse two focuses on the indoctrination of consumption-centric modes of existence, first framing engagement with consumption as an intentionally learned and consensual endeavor (*I'll show you how to make a duck*). In one of the most clever and most ideologically loaded lines (*Chickens like to cluck),* GFOTY uses chickens to represent both a product and a consumer. On one reading of the line, GFOTY is enticing the listener to believe that the consumption she proposes to them is natural by likening them to a chicken and representing consumption as clucking, the implication being that it's only natural that a human would consume—an endless desire to consume is an inherent aspect of their being rather than a fabrication. Interestingly, likening the consumer to a chicken, in the context of the most obvious metaphor in the song—consumption of food representing consumption more broadly—renders them the product. Thus, if the listener is to accept that consumption is natural in the way GFOTY implies (that chickens like to cluck), then they are adopting an ideology that renders them a product. \n\nGFOTY closes verse two by once again creating confusion about the delineation between consumer and product (*Do you want to have a chocolate feast? / Getting baked all eve).* \"Getting baked\" here refers to the preparation of oneself to be consumed, perhaps by conforming to professional norms or standards of beauty. It can also refer to the way consumerist indoctrination renders the consumer numb and dull. As they adopt the ideology, they become metaphorically high on marijuana, leaving them uncritical of their own situation and fixated on consuming more as they get the munchies.\n\nIn the bridge, GFOTY shifts from addressing the listener to conversing with herself in French. The change of language emphasizes the foreign nature of the interaction as she assumes the role of both a waiter and a patron in a restaurant. As she continues to create confusion about what place she plays at the restaurant, we're reminded once again that the entire interaction has been commodified into song form—no matter which role GFOTY is performing, she and her actions are still, inescapably, an artistic product.\n\nThe chorus of FISH IN LAKE is the foundation of GFOTY's facetious assertion that modern consumption sets and patterns are natural. She lists a variety of dishes before concluding with the song's title:\n\n> Steak soufflé\nBake a cake\nRoasted snake\nPasta bake\nFish called hake\nTuna steak\nSalmon cake\nFish in lake\n\nThe insertion of the song's title, FISH IN LAKE, at the end of the chorus situates the menu items she lists and asserts that such a choice between seven dishes makes some subject feel at home (like a fish in a lake). Whether the subject is GFOTY herself, the listener, or the products is unclear, perhaps because she asks the listener to evaluate each possible subject and ask whether the variety of consumption options is really a consequential or natural situation for anyone or anything. \n\nIs the experience of going to a restaurant really normal in the ways we may assume it is? Is the situation akin to a fish in a lake? Or are we actually fish *out* of water? GFOTY asks more questions than she answers, but it's clear she hopes to catalyze reflection and dialogue about consumptive relationships and consumerism as a whole. \n\nThe closing line also serves as a reminder that many of the dishes that were listed in the chorus are unquestionably out of place from their own perspective. Certainly the hake, tuna, and salmon would be better suited to an aquatic environment than a serving plate, and perhaps the snake as well. By juxtaposing the dishes with a mental image of a fish swimming around in a lake, GFOTY delivers perhaps her most straightforward declaration: regardless of how consumers and producers are interacting with one another, there is always a product that must be created and consumed, and that product is, at least partially, reduced and divorced from its purpose. GFOTY confronts some harsh realities of consumerism, and as she guides the listener to understand the dynamics of consumption, an ad lib employed throughout the song feels particularly apt: *gulp*.\n\n*quasimatt is an intellectual.

{"id": "KQuLTFoqbI0jlRmy0QnA1KD1_IzxKPvdXnQX2m5nXq8", "title": "FISH IN LAKE - A GFOTY Analysis", "body": "![FISH IN LAKE is the lead single of GFOTY's upcoming album, Femmedorm.](https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/440x440/https%3a%2f%2fimages.genius.com%2f1d164d1ddae4a276d2e27b47df31f383.1000x1000x1.jpg)\n\n\nGFOTY's lead single from her upcoming album, Femmedorm, continues examining a thematic trend of her music: consumerism and commodification. While GFOTY's music is stylistically rooted in clean production and ultra-accessible rhythmic and lyrical patterns, this song in particular is overt about its rhetorical and artistic intentions. The title, FISH IN LAKE, serves a couple purposes that illuminate the song's narrative and focus: firstly, being a FISH IN LAKE can be seen as the alternative to being a \"fish out of water.\" GFOTY emphasizes that a particular fish is in its element—it feels at home and natural. Throughout the song, the fish in question represents multiple subjects in consumptive relationships. GFOTY continuously confuses the consumer with the consumed, leaving the listener wondering which role she plays in a consumptive relationship and encouraging them to question which role they occupy, poking fun at the idea that one can be a fish in a lake, or a person in the right place, when they're not even sure who they are or what role they're meant to fill. Secondly, GFOTY uses the idea of a FISH IN LAKE to contrast the potential naturalness of a subject with alternative perceptual framings, namely presentations as prepared meals.\n\nIn the opening verse, GFOTY quickly transitions from one role to the next, beginning as a cook who prepares food goods (*Would you like to come and taste my food / Tasty just for you / I made this plate specially for you*) before commodifying herself (*Tell me I'm your type / The candles are low, I'm wearing red / Stay with me tonight*). She then entices the listener into consumption by presenting the narrative that she is also a consumer, promising that she will consume alongside the listener (*We can wash up another time / Eat with me all night).*\n\nThis introduction makes apparent the variety of roles to be played in consumption. One can make and consume goods, as in the case of food, but one can also commodify the self, rendering oneself the object of consumption. Finally, an entire consumption relationship can itself become a product that can be subject to a new meta-consumptive dynamic. While the making and consuming food is a natural and necessary human relationship with consumption, GFOTY juxtaposes this consumptive mode with the more complex relationships in order to guide the listener to identify potential problems with the continuing process of commodification and consumption. It's unclear whether GFOTY's treatment of her self in the first verse truly constitutes commodification, and that lack of clarity is what makes the commentary interesting. While the lyrics imply a sexual or at least romantic relationship that is not inherently rooted in commodification, it is situated in a way that calls into question the nature of the consumptive dynamic. \n\nThere is no shortage of ways to commodify the self: one can bargain with their body, their social connections, their money, and more, offering benefits to be used by others. By placing an innocent and visceral narrative of human connection within a stream of consumption-based scenarios, GFOTY questions whether such relationships can ever be truly innocent and uncommodified against the backdrop of a consumption-obsessed society. She asks to what extent consumptive dynamics have encroached upon our personal lives and relationships and robbed us of more natural expressive or connection-based interaction. \n\nThe closing lines of the first verse entail separate indictments of consumerist culture. Her insistence on delaying consideration of the repercussions of consumption (*We can wash up another time*) could be a commentary on the environmental implications of consumption, for example, which are often ignored or underestimated by both consumers and producers. She may also be referring to personal or social consequences. GFOTY further explores this idea in verse two. The closing line of verse one are an acknowledgement of the complexity of consumption, where the interactions explored in verse one are collapsed into their own experiential product. Here, GFOTY identifies that entire experiences, even ones that already contain a variety of consumptive dynamics themselves, can be commodified into a singular product that can be bought, sold, and consumed. The universe of consumption experiences here is vast, but some recent examples include internet trends like mukbangs and unboxings, where the content product to be observed is simply a performance of consumption. By extending this commodification further, we can acknowledge that we are consuming the song, thus continuing the consumptive chain—perhaps GFOTY aims to comment on the necessity of commodifying oneself to find success as an artist. The relationships are inescapable and infinitely complex.\n\nIn the second verse, GFOTY expands on her exposition of consumptive tendencies as short-sighted. Her consumption becomes unhinged as she veraciously devours (*Would you like to wipe my mouth for me? / Dribble on my sleeve).* She entices the listener to consume (*I know that you're hungry for my treats / Come and suck them up*). It's unclear what treats she refers to, and they remain unnamed, exemplifying that it is consumption as an act that rules this dynamic rather than the actual good being consumed.\n\nThe end of verse two focuses on the indoctrination of consumption-centric modes of existence, first framing engagement with consumption as an intentionally learned and consensual endeavor (*I'll show you how to make a duck*). In one of the most clever and most ideologically loaded lines (*Chickens like to cluck),* GFOTY uses chickens to represent both a product and a consumer. On one reading of the line, GFOTY is enticing the listener to believe that the consumption she proposes to them is natural by likening them to a chicken and representing consumption as clucking, the implication being that it's only natural that a human would consume—an endless desire to consume is an inherent aspect of their being rather than a fabrication. Interestingly, likening the consumer to a chicken, in the context of the most obvious metaphor in the song—consumption of food representing consumption more broadly—renders them the product. Thus, if the listener is to accept that consumption is natural in the way GFOTY implies (that chickens like to cluck), then they are adopting an ideology that renders them a product. \n\nGFOTY closes verse two by once again creating confusion about the delineation between consumer and product (*Do you want to have a chocolate feast? / Getting baked all eve).* \"Getting baked\" here refers to the preparation of oneself to be consumed, perhaps by conforming to professional norms or standards of beauty. It can also refer to the way consumerist indoctrination renders the consumer numb and dull. As they adopt the ideology, they become metaphorically high on marijuana, leaving them uncritical of their own situation and fixated on consuming more as they get the munchies.\n\nIn the bridge, GFOTY shifts from addressing the listener to conversing with herself in French. The change of language emphasizes the foreign nature of the interaction as she assumes the role of both a waiter and a patron in a restaurant. As she continues to create confusion about what place she plays at the restaurant, we're reminded once again that the entire interaction has been commodified into song form—no matter which role GFOTY is performing, she and her actions are still, inescapably, an artistic product.\n\nThe chorus of FISH IN LAKE is the foundation of GFOTY's facetious assertion that modern consumption sets and patterns are natural. She lists a variety of dishes before concluding with the song's title:\n\n>Steak soufflé\n>Bake a cake\n>Roasted snake\n>Pasta bake\n>Fish called hake\n>Tuna steak\n>Salmon cake\n>Fish in lake\n\nThe insertion of the song's title, FISH IN LAKE, at the end of the chorus situates the menu items she lists and asserts that such a choice between seven dishes makes some subject feel at home (like a fish in a lake). Whether the subject is GFOTY herself, the listener, or the products is unclear, perhaps because she asks the listener to evaluate each possible subject and ask whether the variety of consumption options is really a consequential or natural situation for anyone or anything. \n\nIs the experience of going to a restaurant really normal in the ways we may assume it is? Is the situation akin to a fish in a lake? Or are we actually fish *out* of water? GFOTY asks more questions than she answers, but it's clear she hopes to catalyze reflection and dialogue about consumptive relationships and consumerism as a whole. \n\nThe closing line also serves as a reminder that many of the dishes that were listed in the chorus are unquestionably out of place from their own perspective. Certainly the hake, tuna, and salmon would be better suited to an aquatic environment than a serving plate, and perhaps the snake as well. By juxtaposing the dishes with a mental image of a fish swimming around in a lake, GFOTY delivers perhaps her most straightforward declaration: regardless of how consumers and producers are interacting with one another, there is always a product that must be created and consumed, and that product is, at least partially, reduced and divorced from its purpose. GFOTY confronts some harsh realities of consumerism, and as she guides the listener to understand the dynamics of consumption, an ad lib employed throughout the song feels particularly apt: *gulp*.\n\n*quasimatt is an intellectual.

You will receive 100 $ELEKTRA for every 0.1 ETH you contribute to the crowdfund. \n\nThe project will retain 75% of $ELEKTRA’s supply, and distribute the majority to artists, devs, project ops and strategists working directly on the project.

This crowdfund intends to raise the funds that will enable us to do just that. \n\n### Crowdfund Details\n\nWe will use **90% of the amount raised to put towards the *Elektra* project**. \n\nThese funds will go toward the core team of project managers, web developers, artists and strategists working directly on the project. Other costs include transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, web hosting and file storage. We intend to save a portion of these funds to act as the *seed money* in standing up the *ElektraDAO* once this initial phase of the project is complete (more on that below).\n\nThe remaining **10% will go directly to the artists who created the *Portal Ticket* visuals.** \n\n****CROWDFUND SPLIT****\n\n### Phase 1: Songcamp Elektra + The Elektra NFT Vault\n\n*Songcamp Elektra* will run for 4 weeks, until the first week of August. \n\nOnce through the portal, you will begin your journey. You will work with other players to move through this foreign land, discover more about the history of *Elektra*, and find your way to victory. \n\nIf successful, you will unlock the help you need — the people and items along the way that will help you accomplish your mission. Remember, **it is music that powers the world of *Elektra***. Luckily, you’ll have a lot of talented musicians to help along the way. You too may be summoned to assist in the music creation (should you wish to of course). :)\n\nAt times during the camp, 1-of-1 NFTs will be released. A 20% share of the proceeds from collected NFTs will go towards the ElektraDAO, while a select few of the NFTs will be placed in the Elektra Vault.\n\n### Phase 2: ElektraDAO and The $ELEKTRA Token\n\n> We will build a world, and own that world together. \n\nUpon purchasing your *Portal Ticket* NFT, you will also receive a portion of $ELEKTRA tokens based on the amount contributed. You will receive 100 $ELEKTRA for every 0.1 ETH you contribute to the crowdfund. \n\nThe project will retain 75% of $ELEKTRA’s supply, and distribute the majority to artists, devs, project ops and strategists working directly on the project. The remaining amount will be used to create bounty rewards for the wider network, as well as vest a portion in the treasury. \n\n**As this project evolves, the lines between creator and audience will blur.** Game builders will also play the game they are building; and game players will also help build the game they are playing. \n\nBy the end, we will have a community of contributors to the Elektra project that all hold $ELEKTRA tokens based on their contribution levels. At this point, **we will have *exited to community* — and the project will be owned and governed by $ELEKTRA token holders.** \n\n### What Happens Then?\n\nWell, then it’s up to the network. \n\nThe *ElektraDAO* will have created an incredibly strong backbone:\n\n1. A core group of musicians, visual artists, devs, project ops, strategists and backers with sharp coordination and collaboration skills — plus an overflowing level of squad energy.\n2. 1-of-1 NFTs from the Elektra story secured in the DAO’s vault.\n3. A flow of royalties from the artwork created in-camp.\n\nWe then have the exciting opportunity to collectively decide what to do with all this. \n\nSome early ideas: make more art together, continue evolving the world and story of *Elektra*, experiment with and carve out new paths to monetization and value realization for the art we’ve created, or our personal favourite…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/troels_a/status/1413234727822180354\n\n**Broadway, here we come!**\n\nWe thank you — truly and deeply — for being here. 🌻\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1626038527, "digest": "IMgU6ZRJZ0UUrqzxyL5NI3erUUk4RIYk6fjNO_ikpcE", "contributor": "0x658D62A7DC4d475a9cc4AF124A60868c594EEEc6"}

While GFOTY's music is stylistically rooted in clean production and ultra-accessible rhythmic and lyrical patterns, this song in particular is overt about its rhetorical and artistic intentions. The title, FISH IN LAKE, serves a couple purposes that illuminate the song's narrative and focus: firstly, being a FISH IN LAKE can be seen as the alternative to being a \"fish out of water.\" GFOTY emphasizes that a particular fish is in its element—it feels at home and natural. Throughout the song, the fish in question represents multiple subjects in consumptive relationships. GFOTY continuously confuses the consumer with the consumed, leaving the listener wondering which role she plays in a consumptive relationship and encouraging them to question which role they occupy, poking fun at the idea that one can be a fish in a lake, or a person in the right place, when they're not even sure who they are or what role they're meant to fill. Secondly, GFOTY uses the idea of a FISH IN LAKE to contrast the potential naturalness of a subject with alternative perceptual framings, namely presentations as prepared meals.\n\nIn the opening verse, GFOTY quickly transitions from one role to the next, beginning as a cook who prepares food goods (*Would you like to come and taste my food / Tasty just for you / I made this plate specially for you*) before commodifying herself (*Tell me I'm your type / The candles are low, I'm wearing red / Stay with me tonight*). She then entices the listener into consumption by presenting the narrative that she is also a consumer, promising that she will consume alongside the listener (*We can wash up another time / Eat with me all night).*\n\nThis introduction makes apparent the variety of roles to be played in consumption. One can make and consume goods, as in the case of food, but one can also commodify the self, rendering oneself the object of consumption. Finally, an entire consumption relationship can itself become a product that can be subject to a new meta-consumptive dynamic. While the making and consuming food is a natural and necessary human relationship with consumption, GFOTY juxtaposes this consumptive mode with the more complex relationships in order to guide the listener to identify potential problems with the continuing process of commodification and consumption. It's unclear whether GFOTY's treatment of her self in the first verse truly constitutes commodification, and that lack of clarity is what makes the commentary interesting. While the lyrics imply a sexual or at least romantic relationship that is not inherently rooted in commodification, it is situated in a way that calls into question the nature of the consumptive dynamic. \n\nThere is no shortage of ways to commodify the self: one can bargain with their body, their social connections, their money, and more, offering benefits to be used by others. By placing an innocent and visceral narrative of human connection within a stream of consumption-based scenarios, GFOTY questions whether such relationships can ever be truly innocent and uncommodified against the backdrop of a consumption-obsessed society. She asks to what extent consumptive dynamics have encroached upon our personal lives and relationships and robbed us of more natural expressive or connection-based interaction. \n\nThe closing lines of the first verse entail separate indictments of consumerist culture. Her insistence on delaying consideration of the repercussions of consumption (*We can wash up another time*) could be a commentary on the environmental implications of consumption, for example, which are often ignored or underestimated by both consumers and producers. She may also be referring to personal or social consequences. GFOTY further explores this idea in verse two. The closing line of verse one are an acknowledgement of the complexity of consumption, where the interactions explored in verse one are collapsed into their own experiential product. Here, GFOTY identifies that entire experiences, even ones that already contain a variety of consumptive dynamics themselves, can be commodified into a singular product that can be bought, sold, and consumed. The universe of consumption experiences here is vast, but some recent examples include internet trends like mukbangs and unboxings, where the content product to be observed is simply a performance of consumption. By extending this commodification further, we can acknowledge that we are consuming the song, thus continuing the consumptive chain—perhaps GFOTY aims to comment on the necessity of commodifying oneself to find success as an artist. The relationships are inescapable and infinitely complex.\n\nIn the second verse, GFOTY expands on her exposition of consumptive tendencies as short-sighted. Her consumption becomes unhinged as she veraciously devours (*Would you like to wipe my mouth for me? / Dribble on my sleeve).* She entices the listener to consume (*I know that you're hungry for my treats / Come and suck them up*). It's unclear what treats she refers to, and they remain unnamed, exemplifying that it is consumption as an act that rules this dynamic rather than the actual good being consumed.\n\nThe end of verse two focuses on the indoctrination of consumption-centric modes of existence, first framing engagement with consumption as an intentionally learned and consensual endeavor (*I'll show you how to make a duck*). In one of the most clever and most ideologically loaded lines (*Chickens like to cluck),* GFOTY uses chickens to represent both a product and a consumer. On one reading of the line, GFOTY is enticing the listener to believe that the consumption she proposes to them is natural by likening them to a chicken and representing consumption as clucking, the implication being that it's only natural that a human would consume—an endless desire to consume is an inherent aspect of their being rather than a fabrication. Interestingly, likening the consumer to a chicken, in the context of the most obvious metaphor in the song—consumption of food representing consumption more broadly—renders them the product. Thus, if the listener is to accept that consumption is natural in the way GFOTY implies (that chickens like to cluck), then they are adopting an ideology that renders them a product. \n\nGFOTY closes verse two by once again creating confusion about the delineation between consumer and product (*Do you want to have a chocolate feast? / Getting baked all eve).* \"Getting baked\" here refers to the preparation of oneself to be consumed, perhaps by conforming to professional norms or standards of beauty. It can also refer to the way consumerist indoctrination renders the consumer numb and dull. As they adopt the ideology, they become metaphorically high on marijuana, leaving them uncritical of their own situation and fixated on consuming more as they get the munchies.\n\nIn the bridge, GFOTY shifts from addressing the listener to conversing with herself in French. The change of language emphasizes the foreign nature of the interaction as she assumes the role of both a waiter and a patron in a restaurant. As she continues to create confusion about what place she plays at the restaurant, we're reminded once again that the entire interaction has been commodified into song form—no matter which role GFOTY is performing, she and her actions are still, inescapably, an artistic product.\n\nThe chorus of FISH IN LAKE is the foundation of GFOTY's facetious assertion that modern consumption sets and patterns are natural. She lists a variety of dishes before concluding with the song's title:\n\n>Steak soufflé\n>Bake a cake\n>Roasted snake\n>Pasta bake\n>Fish called hake\n>Tuna steak\n>Salmon cake\n>Fish in lake\n\nThe insertion of the song's title, FISH IN LAKE, at the end of the chorus situates the menu items she lists and asserts that such a choice between seven dishes makes some subject feel at home (like a fish in a lake). Whether the subject is GFOTY herself, the listener, or the products is unclear, perhaps because she asks the listener to evaluate each possible subject and ask whether the variety of consumption options is really a consequential or natural situation for anyone or anything. \n\nIs the experience of going to a restaurant really normal in the ways we may assume it is? Is the situation akin to a fish in a lake? Or are we actually fish *out* of water? GFOTY asks more questions than she answers, but it's clear she hopes to catalyze reflection and dialogue about consumptive relationships and consumerism as a whole. \n\nThe closing line also serves as a reminder that many of the dishes that were listed in the chorus are unquestionably out of place from their own perspective. Certainly the hake, tuna, and salmon would be better suited to an aquatic environment than a serving plate, and perhaps the snake as well. By juxtaposing the dishes with a mental image of a fish swimming around in a lake, GFOTY delivers perhaps her most straightforward declaration: regardless of how consumers and producers are interacting with one another, there is always a product that must be created and consumed, and that product is, at least partially, reduced and divorced from its purpose. GFOTY confronts some harsh realities of consumerism, and as she guides the listener to understand the dynamics of consumption, a sound effect employed throughout the song feels particularly apt: *gulp*.\n\n*quasimatt is an intellectual.

Where buying art, voting, fundraising, and even social media were not controlled by a central company or intermediary, but rather an open-source, community-run network where code runs without interference. In 2013 Vitalik Buterin, an 18-year-old Bitcoin enthusiast and writer, proposed the tools to make that future possible. Less than a decade later, thousands of developers have contributed to building the Ethereum ecosystem: a technology that enables decentralized applications, including but not limited to money. For many, [Ethereum is building the internet of value](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-building-internet-of-value). \n\nBut as Ethereum grows in size and popularity, it faces mounting pressure from cutting-edge competitors, hype markets, and criticisms for its scalability and energy consumption. Spearheaded by a global team of researchers and developers, a push to upgrade the platform could address the criticisms and unlock the technology's full potential... or it could derail the still-budding $300 billion network. \n\nFollowing the high-stakes journey to upgrade the platform, ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN explores the innovative real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain, the die-hard community of enthusiasts and developers, and its creator, Vitalik Buterin, whose brilliant vision for the internet has the potential to change the world.\n\n[Photo dropbox file]\n\n### THE INFINITE GARDEN: \n\nIn this film, we approach Ethereum as an “infinite garden.” Instead of thinking of Ethereum as a machine controlled by a central brain, we see it as a decentralized ecosystem with soil, plants, and insects that need to be cared for in order to grow. \n\nThe idea of the infinite garden was conceptualized by Aya Miyaguchi, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. She was inspired by James P. Carse’s book *Finite and Infinite Games*. The following basic principles are at its core: \n\n- A finite game is played for the purpose of winning. An infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing the play.\n- The rules of finite games may not change; the rules of infinite games must change.\n- Finite players play within boundaries; Infinite players play without boundaries. \n- Finite players are serious; Infinite players are playful\n- Finite players play to win titles; Infinite players have nothing but their names\n- A finite player plays to be powerful; an infinite player plays with strength\n- Finite players are theatrical; infinite players are dramatic\n- A finite player consumes time; an infinite player generates time\n- The finite players aims to win eternal life; the infinite player aims for eternal birth\n\nThose who tend to the seeds they plant in the Ethereum garden can nurture and empower the ecosystem but can also harm it. For a crypto culture to remain equitable, decentralized, and sustainable, it must be tended to carefully. ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN will introduce us to these early “gardeners” of the platform as they face the mounting pressures and challenges of the growing ecosystem. \n\n[Photo dropbox file]\n\n### DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT\n\nAs a kid, I grew up in a strictly open-source household. My dad’s radical adoration of Linux introduced me to the potential of community-led technology (and mind blowing internet [weirdness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5x5OXfe9KY)) before I was even in grade school. Today, I feel that same excitement my dad once felt, but for Ethereum and the unique community that powers it.\n\n[Photo dropbox link]\n\nMy hope is to make Ethereum accessible and understandable to the world. By highlighting diverse stories from the global network of \ndevelopers, founders, and end-users, we can create an emotional and human record of Ethereum’s journey. From the inspiring Axie Infinity gamers in the Philippines supporting their families during COVID to the tireless developers making Proof of Stake possible, there already is a bountiful garden to explore. \n\nThirty years from now, when our children look back from a world powered by programmable blockchain technology, they will wonder who was behind it, what challenges they faced, and what sacrifices they made. Instead of boring them with scattered memories and poor explanations of the “[Just Keep Chugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvr0xYeV94M)” meme, let's give them ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN.\n\n*-Zach Ingrasci, Director*\n\n\n\n[photo dropbox link]\n\n### Projected Timeline: \n\nThis past spring, the film team established an exclusive filming relationship with Vitalik Buterin and Aya Miyaguchi.

Where buying art, voting, fundraising, and even social media were not controlled by a central company or intermediary, but rather an open-source, community-run network where code runs without interference. In 2013 Vitalik Buterin, an 18-year-old Bitcoin enthusiast and writer, proposed the tools to make that future possible. Less than a decade later, thousands of developers have contributed to building the Ethereum ecosystem: a technology that enables decentralized applications, including but not limited to money. For many, [Ethereum is building the internet of value](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-building-internet-of-value). \n\nBut as Ethereum grows in size and popularity, it faces mounting pressure from cutting-edge competitors, hype markets, and criticisms for its scalability and energy consumption. Spearheaded by a global team of researchers and developers, a push to upgrade the platform could address the criticisms and unlock the technology's full potential... or it could derail the still-budding $300 billion network. \n\nFollowing the high-stakes journey to upgrade the platform, ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN explores the innovative real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain, the die-hard community of enthusiasts and developers, and its creator, Vitalik Buterin, whose brilliant vision for the internet has the potential to change the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/96ec37d2-1253-4129-86c0-33693623101b.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### THE INFINITE GARDEN: \n\nIn this film, we approach Ethereum as an “infinite garden.” Instead of thinking of Ethereum as a machine controlled by a central brain, we see it as a decentralized ecosystem with soil, plants, and insects that need to be cared for in order to grow. \n\nThe idea of the infinite garden was conceptualized by Aya Miyaguchi, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. She was inspired by James P. Carse’s book *Finite and Infinite Games*. The following basic principles are at its core: \n\n- A finite game is played for the purpose of winning. An infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing the play.\n- The rules of finite games may not change; the rules of infinite games must change.\n- Finite players play within boundaries; Infinite players play without boundaries. \n- Finite players are serious; Infinite players are playful\n- Finite players play to win titles; Infinite players have nothing but their names\n- A finite player plays to be powerful; an infinite player plays with strength\n- Finite players are theatrical; infinite players are dramatic\n- A finite player consumes time; an infinite player generates time\n- The finite players aims to win eternal life; the infinite player aims for eternal birth\n\nThose who tend to the seeds they plant in the Ethereum garden can nurture and empower the ecosystem but can also harm it. For a crypto culture to remain equitable, decentralized, and sustainable, it must be tended to carefully. ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN will introduce us to these early “gardeners” of the platform as they face the mounting pressures and challenges of the growing ecosystem. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/66a1e300-6e0b-4fd5-812d-7a6a34e599a7.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT\n\nAs a kid, I grew up in a strictly open-source household. My dad’s radical adoration of Linux introduced me to the potential of community-led technology (and mind blowing internet [weirdness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5x5OXfe9KY)) before I was even in grade school. Today, I feel that same excitement my dad once felt, but for Ethereum and the unique community that powers it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d4406f2a-503f-46ec-ba6b-89db89fdd8df.jpeg?height=2336&width=8742&size=large)\n\nMy hope is to make Ethereum accessible and understandable to the world. By highlighting diverse stories from the global network of developers, founders, and end-users, we can create an emotional and human record of Ethereum’s journey. From the inspiring Axie Infinity gamers in the Philippines supporting their families during COVID to the tireless developers making Proof of Stake possible, there already is a bountiful garden to explore. \n\nThirty years from now, when our children look back from a world powered by programmable blockchain technology, they will wonder who was behind it, what challenges they faced, and what sacrifices they made. Instead of boring them with scattered memories and poor explanations of the “[Just Keep Chugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvr0xYeV94M)” meme, let's give them ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN.\n\n*-Zach Ingrasci, Director*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ed408928-e082-4606-ad6c-f393ec2fb501.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### Projected Timeline: \n\nThis past spring, the film team established an exclusive filming relationship with Vitalik Buterin and Aya Miyaguchi.

The $ELEKTRA token will come to establish the contribution graph of this project, and once the camp is finished — the *ElektraDAO* will be born. \n\n[Songcamp Elektra](crowdfund://0xa4496Bd920B200A87A1Fa33c5026b045048cF3A7?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=overview)\n\n## The Portal to Elektra Is Now Open\n\nA portal has opened to another world. A world called *Elektra*. To access the portal, you must secure a *Portal Ticket* NFT. \n\nOnce secured, [enter the Portal to Elektra here](https://elektra.camp/).\n\nIn total, there are 6 *Portal Ticket* NFTs available. \n\n**Each ticket gives you access to a different Portal Entry Point**, and thus each ticket brings you to a different starting point in the game. This means that those with different *Portal Tickets* will be required to work together to accomplish their collective mission.\n\nIn securing your *Portal Ticket*, you will also receive $ELEKTRA tokens — the currency native to Elektra. **You will need these tokens to complete your mission.**\n\n### There are 3 multi-edition *Portal Ticket* NFTs:\n\n1. **The Phi Ticket** → Edition of 10 at 1 ETH\n2. **The Chi Ticket** → Edition of 50 at 0.4 ETH\n3. **The Psi Ticket** → Edition of 200 at 0.1 ETH\n\n[Songcamp Elektra](crowdfund://0xa4496Bd920B200A87A1Fa33c5026b045048cF3A7?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=editions)\n\n### There are also 3 1-of-1 *Portal Ticket* NFTs, awarded to the top 3 backers of the crowdfund:\n\n4.

Music is the fuel, electricity, and light of the world.\n\nCenturies ago, *Elektra* had a thriving civilization with a deep rooted sense of value towards art. But soon, motives around greed and self-interest took over, and the music that powered this world was lost.\n\nYour mission is to travel to *Elektra*, and help us collectively revive, restore and reignite this once beautiful world back to health.\n\n***Will you accept your mission?***\n\n**To play the game, you must secure one (1) of the following *Portal Ticket* NFTs.**\n\n[Phi Ticket](edition://0x9adDcb5546d5bBFf5C6bCb582279c6aE61CD67C1?editionId=29&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n[Psi Ticket](edition://0x9adDcb5546d5bBFf5C6bCb582279c6aE61CD67C1?editionId=28&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n[Chi Ticket](edition://0x9adDcb5546d5bBFf5C6bCb582279c6aE61CD67C1?editionId=27&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n## What is Songcamp Elektra?\n\n**Songcamp Elektra** is the second experiment created by *Songcamp* — a community of musicians, artists and strategists with a deep interest in learning what happens when **music** and **the new internet** crash into each other.\n\n*Songcamp* acts a lot like a **web3 laboratory** — experimenting at the far out edges of how web3 tools and tech can affect positive change in the lives and work of artists.\n\nThe *Songcamp Elektra* project is made up of ~42 artists, devs, project ops and strategists working together to bring this world to life. This crowdfund intends to raise the funds that will enable us to do just that. \n\n## Crowdfund Details\n\n* **90% to the *Elektra* project**\n* **10% to *Portal Tickets* visual team**\n\nWe will use **90% of the amount raised to put towards the *Elektra* project**. \n\nThese funds will go toward the core team of project managers, web developers, artists and strategists working directly on the project. Other costs include transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, web hosting and file storage. We intend to save a portion of these funds to act as the *seed money* in standing up the *ElektraDAO* once this initial phase of the project is complete (more on that below).\n\nThe remaining **10% will go directly to the artists who created the *Portal Ticket* visuals.** \n\n## Phase 1: Songcamp Elektra + The Elektra NFT Vault\n\n*Songcamp Elektra* will run for 4 weeks, until the first week of August. \n\nOnce through the portal, you will begin your journey. You will work with other players to move through this foreign land, discover more about the history of *Elektra*, and find your way to victory. \n\nIf successful, you will unlock the help you need — the people and items along the way that will help you accomplish your mission. Remember, **it is music that powers the world of *Elektra***. Luckily, you’ll have a lot of talented musicians to help along the way. You too may be summoned to assist in the music creation (should you wish to of course). :)\n\nAt times during the camp, 1-of-1 NFTs will be released. A 20% share of the proceeds from collected NFTs will go towards the ElektraDAO, while a select few of the NFTs will be placed in the Elektra Vault.\n\n## Phase 2: ElektraDAO and The $ELEKTRA Token\n\n> We will build a world, and own that world together. \n\nUpon purchasing your *Portal Ticket* NFT, you will also receive a portion of $ELEKTRA tokens based on the amount contributed. You will receive 100 $ELEKTRA for every 0.1 ETH you contribute to the crowdfund. \n\nThe project will retain 75% of $ELEKTRA’s supply, and distribute the majority to artists, devs, project ops and strategists working directly on the project. The remaining amount will be used to create bounty rewards for the wider network, as well as vest a portion in the treasury. \n\n**As this project evolves, the lines between creator and audience will blur.** Game builders will also play the game they are building; and game players will also help build the game they are playing. \n\nBy the end, we will have a community of contributors to the Elektra project that all hold $ELEKTRA tokens based on their contribution levels. At this point, **we will have *exited to community* — and the project will be owned and governed by $ELEKTRA token holders.** \n\n## Then What?\n\nWell, then it’s up to the network. \n\nThe *ElektraDAO* will have created an incredibly strong backbone:\n\n1. A core group of musicians, visual artists, devs, project ops, strategists and backers with sharp coordination and collaboration skills — plus an overflowing level of squad energy.\n2. 1-of-1 NFTs from the Elektra story secured in the DAO’s vault.\n3. A flow of royalties from the artwork created in-camp.\n\nWe then have the exciting opportunity to collectively decide what to do with all this. \n\nSome early ideas: make more art together, continue evolving the world and story of *Elektra*, experiment with and carve out new paths to monetization and value realization for the art we’ve created, or our personal favourite…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/troels_a/status/1413234727822180354\n\n**Broadway, here we come.** \n\n### Once you've secured your *Portal Ticket*, enter the Portal to Elektra:\n\nhttps://elektra.camp/\n\n", "timestamp": 1626045730, "digest": "VkZfQMQLQHUR79xxyU3h-NmdFeBR1L_wsmceqgkmARc", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

Where buying art, voting, fundraising, and even social media were not controlled by a central company or intermediary, but rather an open-source, community-run network where code runs without interference. In 2013 Vitalik Buterin, an 18-year-old Bitcoin enthusiast and writer, proposed the tools to make that future possible. Less than a decade later, thousands of developers have contributed to building the Ethereum ecosystem: a technology that enables decentralized applications, including but not limited to money. For many, [Ethereum is building the internet of value](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-building-internet-of-value). \n\nBut as Ethereum grows in size and popularity, it faces mounting pressure from cutting-edge competitors, hype markets, and criticisms for its scalability and energy consumption. Spearheaded by a global team of researchers and developers, a push to upgrade the platform could address the criticisms and unlock the technology's full potential... or it could derail the still-budding $300 billion network. \n\nFollowing the high-stakes journey to upgrade the platform, ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN explores the innovative real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain, the die-hard community of enthusiasts and developers, and its creator, Vitalik Buterin, whose brilliant vision for the internet has the potential to change the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/96ec37d2-1253-4129-86c0-33693623101b.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### THE INFINITE GARDEN: \n\nIn this film, we approach Ethereum as an “infinite garden.” Instead of thinking of Ethereum as a machine controlled by a central brain, we see it as a decentralized ecosystem with soil, plants, and insects that need to be cared for in order to grow. \n\nThe idea of the infinite garden was conceptualized by Aya Miyaguchi, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. She was inspired by James P. Carse’s book *Finite and Infinite Games*. The following basic principles are at its core: \n\n- A finite game is played for the purpose of winning. An infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing the play.\n- The rules of finite games may not change; the rules of infinite games must change.\n- Finite players play within boundaries; Infinite players play without boundaries. \n- Finite players are serious; Infinite players are playful\n- Finite players play to win titles; Infinite players have nothing but their names\n- A finite player plays to be powerful; an infinite player plays with strength\n- Finite players are theatrical; infinite players are dramatic\n- A finite player consumes time; an infinite player generates time\n- The finite players aims to win eternal life; the infinite player aims for eternal birth\n\nThose who tend to the seeds they plant in the Ethereum garden can nurture and empower the ecosystem but can also harm it. For a crypto culture to remain equitable, decentralized, and sustainable, it must be tended to carefully. ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN will introduce us to these early “gardeners” of the platform as they face the mounting pressures and challenges of the growing ecosystem. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/66a1e300-6e0b-4fd5-812d-7a6a34e599a7.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT\n\nAs a kid, I grew up in a strictly open-source household. My dad’s radical adoration of Linux introduced me to the potential of community-led technology (and mind blowing internet [weirdness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5x5OXfe9KY)) before I was even in grade school. Today, I feel that same excitement my dad once felt, but for Ethereum and the unique community that powers it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d4406f2a-503f-46ec-ba6b-89db89fdd8df.jpeg?height=2336&width=8742&size=large)\n\nMy hope is to make Ethereum accessible and understandable to the world. By highlighting diverse stories from the global network of developers, founders, and end-users, we can create an emotional and human record of Ethereum’s journey. From the inspiring Axie Infinity gamers in the Philippines supporting their families during COVID to the tireless developers making Proof of Stake possible, there already is a bountiful garden to explore. \n\nThirty years from now, when our children look back from a world powered by programmable blockchain technology, they will wonder who was behind it, what challenges they faced, and what sacrifices they made. Instead of boring them with scattered memories and poor explanations of the “[Just Keep Chugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvr0xYeV94M)” meme, let's give them ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN.\n\n*-Zach Ingrasci, Director*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ed408928-e082-4606-ad6c-f393ec2fb501.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### Projected Timeline: \n\nThis past spring, the film team established an exclusive filming relationship with Vitalik Buterin and Aya Miyaguchi.

Spearheaded by a global team of researchers and developers, a push to upgrade the platform could address the criticisms and unlock the technology's full potential... or it could derail the still-budding $300 billion network. \n\nFollowing the high-stakes journey to upgrade the platform, ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN explores the innovative real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain, the die-hard community of enthusiasts and developers, and its creator, Vitalik Buterin, whose brilliant vision for the internet has the potential to change the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/96ec37d2-1253-4129-86c0-33693623101b.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### THE INFINITE GARDEN: \n\nIn this film, we approach Ethereum as an “infinite garden.” Instead of thinking of Ethereum as a machine controlled by a central brain, we see it as a decentralized ecosystem with soil, plants, and insects that need to be cared for in order to grow. \n\nThe idea of the infinite garden was conceptualized by Aya Miyaguchi, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. She was inspired by James P. Carse’s book *Finite and Infinite Games*. The following basic principles are at its core: \n\n- A finite game is played for the purpose of winning. An infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing the play.\n- The rules of finite games may not change; the rules of infinite games must change.\n- Finite players play within boundaries; Infinite players play without boundaries. \n- Finite players are serious; Infinite players are playful\n- Finite players play to win titles; Infinite players have nothing but their names\n- A finite player plays to be powerful; an infinite player plays with strength\n- Finite players are theatrical; infinite players are dramatic\n- A finite player consumes time; an infinite player generates time\n- The finite players aims to win eternal life; the infinite player aims for eternal birth\n\nThose who tend to the seeds they plant in the Ethereum garden can nurture and empower the ecosystem but can also harm it. For a crypto culture to remain equitable, decentralized, and sustainable, it must be tended to carefully. ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN will introduce us to these early “gardeners” of the platform as they face the mounting pressures and challenges of the growing ecosystem. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/66a1e300-6e0b-4fd5-812d-7a6a34e599a7.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT\n\nAs a kid, I grew up in a strictly open-source household. My dad’s radical adoration of Linux introduced me to the potential of community-led technology (and mind blowing internet [weirdness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5x5OXfe9KY)) before I was even in grade school. Today, I feel that same excitement my dad once felt, but for Ethereum and the unique community that powers it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d4406f2a-503f-46ec-ba6b-89db89fdd8df.jpeg?height=2336&width=8742&size=large)\n\nMy hope is to make Ethereum accessible and understandable to the world. By highlighting diverse stories from the global network of developers, founders, and end-users, we can create an emotional and human record of Ethereum’s journey. From the inspiring Axie Infinity gamers in the Philippines supporting their families during COVID to the tireless developers making Proof of Stake possible, there already is a bountiful garden to explore. \n\nThirty years from now, when our children look back from a world powered by programmable blockchain technology, they will wonder who was behind it, what challenges they faced, and what sacrifices they made.

Where buying art, voting, fundraising, and even social media were not controlled by a central company or intermediary, but rather an open-source, community-run network where code runs without interference. In 2013 Vitalik Buterin, an 18-year-old Bitcoin enthusiast and writer, proposed the tools to make that future possible. Less than a decade later, thousands of developers have contributed to building the Ethereum ecosystem: a technology that enables decentralized applications, including but not limited to money. For many, [Ethereum is building the internet of value](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-building-internet-of-value). \n\nBut as Ethereum grows in size and popularity, it faces mounting pressure from cutting-edge competitors, hype markets, and criticisms for its scalability and energy consumption. Spearheaded by a global team of researchers and developers, a push to upgrade the platform could address the criticisms and unlock the technology's full potential... or it could derail the still-budding $300 billion network. \n\nFollowing the high-stakes journey to upgrade the platform, ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN explores the innovative real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain, the die-hard community of enthusiasts and developers, and its creator, Vitalik Buterin, whose brilliant vision for the internet has the potential to change the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/96ec37d2-1253-4129-86c0-33693623101b.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### THE INFINITE GARDEN: \n\nIn this film, we approach Ethereum as an “infinite garden.” Instead of thinking of Ethereum as a machine controlled by a central brain, we see it as a decentralized ecosystem with soil, plants, and insects that need to be cared for in order to grow. \n\nThe idea of the infinite garden was conceptualized by Aya Miyaguchi, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. She was inspired by James P. Carse’s book *Finite and Infinite Games*. The following basic principles are at its core: \n\n- A finite game is played for the purpose of winning. An infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing the play.\n- The rules of finite games may not change; the rules of infinite games must change.\n- Finite players play within boundaries; Infinite players play without boundaries. \n- Finite players are serious; Infinite players are playful\n- Finite players play to win titles; Infinite players have nothing but their names\n- A finite player plays to be powerful; an infinite player plays with strength\n- Finite players are theatrical; infinite players are dramatic\n- A finite player consumes time; an infinite player generates time\n- The finite players aims to win eternal life; the infinite player aims for eternal birth\n\nThose who tend to the seeds they plant in the Ethereum garden can nurture and empower the ecosystem but can also harm it. For a crypto culture to remain equitable, decentralized, and sustainable, it must be tended to carefully. ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN will introduce us to these early “gardeners” of the platform as they face the mounting pressures and challenges of the growing ecosystem. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/66a1e300-6e0b-4fd5-812d-7a6a34e599a7.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT\n\nAs a kid, I grew up in a strictly open-source household.
