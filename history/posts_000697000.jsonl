{"id": "7v9RIBHEDyuPAwn_e7dwjJ8R-XGexMtFEKoJeSV8STg", "title": "Grit, Resilience and Determination", "body": "I am returning to a topic that I have talked a lot about on this blog.\n\nA number of years ago at our annual CEO Summit, we had Angela Duckworth speak to our portfolio about Grit, the topic of [her excellent book on the subject](https://www.amazon.com/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth/dp/1501111108). In Angela’s research, she determined that the single greatest determinant of success was not talent. It was grit.\n\nI was reminded of that last night as I watched Derrick Rose lead the New York Knicks to a must win in game two of their series against the Atlanta Hawks. The Knicks were a mess for the first half of the game and Derrick Rose singlehandedly kept them in the game.\n\nDerrick Rose was the first pick in the 2008 draft and by 2011 he became the youngest NBA player to win the Most Valuable Player award, something he accomplished at age 23. A year later he tore his ACL and he has struggled with injuries ever since.\n\nIn the middle of this season, the Knicks acquired Derrick Rose from the Detroit Pistons and soon thereafter he came down with Covid and missed several weeks.\n\nBut after Derrick Rose came back from Covid in the last seventeen games of the season, the Knicks won thirteen of those games and landed in fourth place in the East.\n\nAnd last night, he was the heart and soul of the Knicks. He kept them in the game until his teammates woke up, and he led the team in scoring in a must-win.\n\nDerrick Rose will never be the player he was at 23 when he could beat anyone off the dribble and score at will. He could have called it quits many times in the last nine years since he won his MVP. But he hasn’t quit, he’s worked his way back and he is leading an NBA team in the playoffs. It is really something to behold.\n\nNot everything goes the way we are expecting it to go. We get dealt bad hands and have to play them. That is way things are in life. There are people out there, like Derrick Rose, who show that you can make the best of a tough situation, keep going, and win anyway. That’s grit.\n", "timestamp": 1622387247, "digest": "UVLmic3T2spwLxZehkBR-zpA-hZ3CIMcNonjVCT0Q4o", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}
{"id": "oAyatw4qffW3nf4sSaSpwy28cbdR8MOlEU28Z8HaZoY", "title": "Build {on} bridges, not [behind] walls", "body": "Ever since sharding and the internet of blockchains ideas were first introduced, maintaining composability has been a hot topic of discussion. Let's try to better understand the role bridges play in keeping our ecosystem composable.\n\nWhile I've written about composability of [dapps](https://medium.com/coinmonks/crypto-and-web-3-0-are-the-future-of-product-and-work-3d19e3733181) and [wallets](https://medium.com/coinmonks/1the-importance-of-composable-wallets-for-users-and-developers-accb2aadff49) before, I don't believe I've explicitly defined the word \"composable.\" Generally, I think composability is comprised of **existence, flexibility, and reusability**. As a pre-condition, everything should be accessible in a permissionless manner (i.e. sufficiently decentralized). \n\n## Existence \nI believe that right now, most people think of bridges as \"how can I get token A transferred from blockchain X to blockchain Y,\" or slightly fancier as \"how can I swap token A on blockchain X for token B on blockchain Y.\" \n\nIn other words, right now the focus is on **asset existence** - meaning the same asset should exist on every chain. For example, USDC should exist on both Ethereum and Polygon and remain fungible between chains (almost as if they were the same ERC20 contract). Another example would be getting Bitcoin from its chain to Ethereum through the Ren wrapper as renBTC. \n\nA second facet is continuous versus ubiquitous existence. Continuous is the earlier example where my tokens are either on chain A or chain B. However, some tokens may need to exist on multiple chains at the same time, hence, ubiquitous. This can apply to something like a proof token (NFT). Let's say I have an NFT representing my credit score which I can use to borrow with special terms inside some defi dapp. I wouldn't want to transfer this NFT across chains, since I'm likely borrowing from multiple chains at the same time. Hence, the NFT needs to exist on both chain A and chain B at the same time - and remain in sync on mints, transfers, and URI updates. This can be extended to DAOs as well, though this one is harder to think about since DAOs don't have a set contract standard. \n\nA more technical way of framing asset existence is as the data on a blockchain. Usually, we either access data stored in a contract or we mutate the state by interacting with the contract. As far as I know, we don't have a good way of accessing or mutating data between chains, besides what is under research like [optics](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/optics) or [sharding](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain/). This means that currently, smart contracts (the logic and assets) are portable from chain to chain but are non-interactive between them. Instead of the vertical legos we're used to, we really only have horizontal integration right now. Each chain is built up as a walled city, with resources traded around between them all. \n\n## Flexibility and Reusability\n\nI think that the scope of asset transfer for understanding bridges is a little narrow. The truth is, we've actually all been using bridges for years now! Let's redefine a bridge to be \"the [transport, authentication, and ordering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5lQIa-lSKI) of information between two or more parties.\"\n\nThis is very similar to how the internet works today, where data is split and transferred in packets between a web of nodes before reaching their desired destination (IP) and being put together in a specific order to represent the original data. Our extra layers of complexity with bridges involving blockchains come from security and verification:\n- As chain B, can you trust the message being sent across the bridge is true, like when using wrappers like renBTC?\n- Conversely as chain A, can you trust that the message you sent through was committed into a transaction (i.e. calling a smart contract on chain B)?\nI won't go deep into this today but you can learn more about the technical difficulties [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1128) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0mC-ZqN8Oo).\n\nNow, let's think about what common party-to-party bridges exist in the our ecosystem:\n- database <> database (bridged by [ACID methodologies](https://open.spotify.com/collection) and microservices)\n- database <> blockchain (oracle networks that bridge data to a blockchain)\n- blockchain <> database (event reader networks that bridge blockchain to a database)\n- blockchain <> blockchain (the bridges we've been talking about for the internet of blockchains fit here)\n- dapp <> dapp (everything in between is one large, flexible bridge)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e3e0bebe-dc3d-4d82-97d9-91f9fb8a54b0.jpeg?height=439&width=779)\n\nI've observed that bridges are first built for a specific purpose of supporting data existence from point A to point B, but then become more and more flexible as **they can be built upon by anyone).** \n\nGenerally with any bridge there are three roles:\n- Node Runner (manage the bridge infrastructure)\n- Creator (developers who create a marketplace of possible interactions/queries to load onto nodes)\n- User/Query Runner (consumers of data, who can use anything from the marketplace built by creators to port data from point A to point B through node runners)\n\nOnce these three roles have been set up nicely, you obtain the properties of flexibility and reusability. Let's look at some concrete examples:\n- **Chainlink**: On Chainlink, you have a party that is specifically responsible for running a node that takes in requests from an on-chain oracle contract and returns the value from the endpoint queried. Creators are developers who can create [external adapters](https://docs.chain.link/docs/external-adapters/) that allow for API keys and complex logic (i.e. the data returned is a multi-key JSON object, and I can use an adapter to concatenate that into a bytes32 object to easily parse in solidity). \n- **theGraph**: This service has the three roles [most clearly defined](https://thegraph.com/docs/network#overview), with indexers (node runners that read emitted events from on-chain), curators (creators of the subgraphs/API endpoints), and consumers (the ones running each query). \n- **Numerai**: While their user use case may not be as flexible (given they are not purposed to output data on-chain past staking purposes), they allow creators to [upload machine learning models](https://docs.numer.ai/tournament/compute) onto hosted infrastructure. Given the prevalence of ML/AI in our world, I imagine that one day someone will provide a similar service/structure for running models with inputs/outputs on-chain. \n\nNow for some bridges that I think will reach the same structure: \n* **Teller**: While right now [their node network](https://teller.gitbook.io/teller-docs/teller-nodes/overview) supports only the transfer of your bank account data on chain, it is possible that they become a network that allows any fintech data provider to onboard and create a data service. This is similar to chainlink, but their infrastructure has better privacy management/implications. \n* **Mina**: Speaking of privacy, Mina is actually a super interesting project because they enable use cases like Teller with their technology. Their tooling allows for a [zk/privacy overlay end-to-end](https://minaprotocol.com/tech), which in my mind feels very similar to how we have gone from TCP/IP to VPN in the traditional internet world. I'm assuming they'll be like any node network where these privacy use cases can be built on top of it and used by anyone on another blockchain. \n- **Cosmos**: With CosmWasm/IBC/Tendermint/Ethermint, you can actually start building logic into bridges that are similar to smart contracts ([like DEXs](https://blog.cosmos.network/sifchain-announces-peggy-cosmos-ethereum-cross-chain-bridge-eeb46a8f91db)). Some examples that have come out of their SDK are proof of stake style chains like Thorchain. \n- **Connext**: With state channels/ILP, you get a level of user flexibility that is hard to manage with IBC. Their [custom transfer definitions](https://docs.connext.network/custom-transfers) and routers may in the future allow for special use cases for DAOs, NFTs, and other self-managed multi-chain needs.  \n\n![Together, our ecosystem looks something like this](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/45dd46f6-c053-4eec-9342-7ec70b976ddd.jpeg?height=826&width=1209)\n\nBuilding freely upon bridges gives us **flexibility**, and the shared infrastructure and split roles gives us **reusability**. Many of our bridges already have these two properties, and the bridges between blockchains are getting there as well. One day these bridges will enable full (veritcal/horizontal) existence as well, giving us composability across the ecosystem. \n\n## A Token from the Haert\n\nWe're all out here building bridges right now, trying out best to move in sync. Walls are being torn down, and the groundwork is being laid for the many future generations to build upon. We must **exist** together, with **flexibility** of mind, and a **shared** heart. There will be no walls in the metaverse. I wanted to represent this ethos in an algorithmically generated art piece from Ethereum data:\n\n[Token #3347](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3347)\n\nThe identicons are generated from 100 unique Ethereum addresses. Through 100 rounds, each \"block\" moves towards the center following the [Ethereum PoW Poisson distribution](https://ethresear.ch/t/deep-dive-into-current-pow-difficulty-adjustment-algorithm-and-a-possible-alternative/5267). The \"heartbeat\" is generated by the amplitudes of the sine transform of [Ethereum transaction history](https://etherscan.io/chart/tx).\n", "timestamp": 1622410081, "digest": "Y2XBh3HRu5B0S3qw974txvIv0JDz7Tu-yIKVTes7DUU", "contributor": "0x2Ae8c972fB2E6c00ddED8986E2dc672ED190DA06"}
{"id": "r2PIiMJgOsYDVPriMGTMxaPTQ70l8WZP71DTB2XoCGA", "title": "NFT Value Capture Equation", "body": "Last month, I set out to explore one question: **where do NFTs capture value?**\n\nThis is not a thesis on what makes NFTs valuable, it assumes you already understand [why scarce, permanent, ownable digital content has value](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo).\n\nInstead, we’ll use this essay to explore the NFT stack, breaking down the various layers as we hone in on one in particular - **curation**.\n\n![$VALUE](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7785e8b8-032f-4012-8330-f50f5e57db78.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n## Analyzing the NFT Stack\n\nNFTs flow through a number of layers from creation to collection. Baked within this stack are dozens of platforms, many of which are covered in my first Mirror post on the [NFT issuance landscape](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/PF42Z9oE_r6yhZN9jZrrseXfHaZALj9JIfMplshlgQ0).\n\n![NFT Stack](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7ae6c2ab-7632-4e6c-a2cf-490462eb4086.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nEvery NFT is issued on a blockchain through a process called minting. There are different means of minting, but the end result is creating a token that conforms to a certain NFT schema ([ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155), or [zNFT](https://github.com/ourzora/core#architecture)).\n\nOnce minted, NFTs can move seamlessly between marketplaces and applications, just like a cryptocurrency can move between exchanges and wallets. Oftentimes, decisions for what marketplace to release on are based on the structure of the NFT sale, including nuances like editions vs 1/1s (more on this in my next post).\n\n## Curation Tokens SoonTM\n\nIn the near future, **all marketplaces will feature curation tokens** as an incentive to release on a given platform. Tokens enable curators to signal towards which creators (and individual NFTs) are most valuable. Curators that attract the most sales earn the most rewards. \n\nCurators share in a marketplace’s upside by earning tokens or receiving a percentage of sales when a purchase is made through a referral or based on a curator’s delegated stake. This is drastically different from today where fees are captured exclusively by the core team, rather than a global community of tokenholders.\n\nWhen this transition happens, the most active curator (measured by volume and usage) will receive the largest allocations of retroactive airdrops, drastically boosting their signal and curation abilities.\n\nMoving forward, the largest rewards will be captured by those with specialized knowledge of undiscovered talent - essentially playing matchmaker between creator and collector to boost sales on their preferred marketplace(s).\n\nLet’s explore how curation fits into the NFT landscape today.\n\n## The State of NFTs\n\nThe supply of NFTs will outpace the demand. The number of NFTs will grow while the average price per NFT will diminish.\n\nWe’re starting to see this today, with most open editions on Nifty Gateway starting to trade below their primary sale price on the secondary market due to a lack of demand from new buyers and a lack of signal from curators.\n\nThis forces creators to cut through the noise, leading to the formation of micro-economies - or markets that form around specific individuals, brands or creators - for NFTs and their collections.\n\nIn this new world, every creator becomes their own micro-economy. The new race is becoming a majority shareholder in those creator economies through curation.\n\nJust as we see aggressive pushes for majority ownership in a seed-stage company, NFTs unlock these experiments at a more granular level. Access to assets are global and permissionless, and those with a capacity to discover rising talent are able to purchase meaningful pieces of a creator’s micro-economy very early in its lifecycle.\n\n## Community Makes NFTs Valuable\n\nA small percentage of NFTs retain the vast majority of value. Looking to OnlyFans or Medium [as an example](https://twitter.com/iamkoshiek/status/1279753515422953473?s=20), the top 10% of creators will account for 90% of the value.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamludwin/status/1373037695879032834?s=20)\n\nThis places a strong emphasis on community, as NFTs retain and increase their value by [creating a diverse network of curators that share in that collection](https://a16z.com/2021/02/27/nfts-and-a-thousand-true-fans/). **This is the primary reason why CryptoPunks have performed so well**. As the “first NFT”, the CryptoPunk community has ascribed value to specific traits and rarities, so much so that we’re now seeing derivatives like $PUNKS and [social personas](https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT) emerge around it.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/peruggia_v/status/1370258347341934593?s=20)\n\n**Value is directly correlated to the strength of its underlying community.**\n\nCommunity is motivated by intrinsic values like social status and extrinsic values like future upside. It’s a curator’s job to create an ecosystem for both of these motivations to live in harmony.\n\nCommunities like [Friends With Benefits](https://fwb.help/) will soon hold royalty claims on dozens of NFTs. Royalties will be programmatically captured, creating treasuries with lifetime value, no trust required, and no overhead.\n\nThis is why the primary sale of an NFT is not enough to give it long-term value. True value comes from the traction and continued interest around the longevity of specific collections.\n\n## SOCKS Community\n\nLooking at Unisocks, the value of SOCKS spiked 300% in September when Uniswap [announced](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) it was giving 1000 UNI to every address holding 1 SOCKS on September 1st. (fun fact: I sold here - RIP)\n\nSince then, SOCKS has seen no new utility, but has increased nearly 150x in price to its current value of ~$100k/pair. While SOCKS are a fungible ERC20 token, the value of the NFTs a user received when redeeming SOCKS is now [averaged](https://opensea.io/assets/0x65770b5283117639760bea3f867b69b3697a91dd/20) to be about 12.5 ETH.\n\n![SOCKS on OpenSea](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f0fbd3de-fab8-4efc-ba0c-27cb6828145b.jpeg?height=690&width=1600)\n\nAs one of the first “collectibles”, SOCKS holders have described holding the token as a “spiritual experience”. Certain holders are even having SOCKS only dinners for fellow diamond hands.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/lay2000lbs/status/1366167992279719938?s=20)\n\n**This goes to show that the value of NFTs comes from the shared collectible experience within a community.**\n\nAnd how do you incubate this spirit? **By working with curators**.\n\n## Curation is Key\n\nCurators decide which NFTs have value, and which do not.\n\nCurators signal to value and offer services like distribution and strategy to enhance that value.\n\n> Without curators - there is no market for NFTs and therefore, no value.\n\n![Curation Landscape](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3e51631e-6913-4d18-a486-86746a54ab55.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nGroups like [Flamingo](https://flamingodao.xyz/collection) and Gremlins curate and collect together. They share information about which artists and drops are most relevant and collaborate to form markets (and buzz) around them.\n\nAgencies like [Six](https://twitter.com/sixnft) curate NFT strategies, exchanging a percentage of sales in exchange for distribution channels, administrative overhead, and a seal of approval to facilitate successful drops.\n\nWe’re now seeing creators bundle premium services to build deeper relationships with their superfans - specifically to empower and incubate their biggest curators.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1367875874889031690?s=20)\n\nWhat’s unique about NFT curators is that their value is often democratized among its community.\n\n## Case Study: WHALE\n\n[Whaleshark](https://twitter.com/WhaleShark_Pro) democratized ownership of his famous NFT collection through a social token called WHALE.\n\nOperating on the back of a WHALE DAO, all decisions around the governance of his NFTs rest in the hands of WHALE holders.\n\nWhile the collection has been rather passive since launch, Whaleshark has suggested that the project will move towards more market participation in the near future. This includes taking a portion of profits from NFT sales to conduct WHALE buy-backs.\n\nLooking at Whaleshark as a curator, WHALE is a direct way to participate in the upside of his NFT collection. Because that collection is backed by an avid community sharing in the likeness of the WHALE DAO, it has long-term value. \n\nPlus, operational structures, WHALE salaries and [quarterly reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec9lXMsk_f4&ab_channel=WhaleCommunity) are just some of the icing on the cake that show why Whaleshark has become a leading curator in the NFT stack today.\n\n![WHALE Topshot](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f7734027-eb7f-440d-807b-84dc48a9a032.jpeg?height=900&width=1600)\n\n![WHALE Vault](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/28eb2810-9ef4-4d87-b28c-8d4bb523e094.jpeg?height=288&width=512)\n\n## How to Curate Today\n\nAs Creator DAOs and Sub-DAOs start to pop up around collections like NBA Top Shots or CryptoPunks, so too will the opportunity to participate in those collectives.\n\nGroups like [The First Mint](https://twitter.com/TheFirstMint) are currently working with social token incubator [Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq) to build out a blueprint for their community-first launch. \n\nAs a curator, this provides an opportunity to incubate community around new NFTs. Those that control the community control the power. **After all, the best way to grow a community is to make them rich**.\n\nThe best way to invest in the curation layer is by backing the early experiments positioning themselves as curators. Most curators will find ways to offer basket exposure to their underlying collection. **Own a part of that basket**.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/WhaleShark_Pro/status/1375100298419527681?s=20)\n\nWhen valuing a curator, look for the following:\n\n- Which collections do they own a significant portion of?\n- Were they early to these collections, or late movers?\n- Do they have the ability to influence a new collection, or simply follow on?\n- Does the curator have strong leadership?\n- Are there plans to democratize access to their collection?\n\nThe best curators are those with a strong capacity to influence the next CryptoPunks. Look deeper than a curator touting purchase prices, and instead focus on those crate digging to capture significant market share in an undiscovered collection.\n\nIn case you were wondering, here’s why.\n\n![Nifty Portfolios](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64620cc2-082e-4256-9321-ecf612a8c254.jpeg?height=608&width=985)\n\n## The Rise of the Micro-Economies\n\nThe best curators are [not traditional venture investment vehicles](https://twitter.com/pridesai/status/1365437530842218497?s=20). They are the individuals, groups and communities organizing around new collections using shared capital to incubate rising talent.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1374101538734448641?s=20)\n\nWhile the focus is currently on NFTs, the next chapter of curation is fungible tokens. Similar to WHALE or FWB, curators will offer democratized access to their collections, and give all participants a way to capture their upside.\n\nCurators will grow their community treasury to feature a diverse pool of NFTs, ETH to invest, social token partnerships, and curation tokens from marketplace rewards. **In theory, curation treasuries could be the most diverse in all of crypto.**\n\nIf you’re looking to deploy capital into NFTs, look no further than the curators.\n\n**The hardest part is going to be getting accepted.**\n\n---\n\nSpecial thanks Variant for inspiring this post and to Whaleshark, John Palmer, Alex Zhang and Carlos Gomes for their feedback.\n\nThe owner of this NFT will receive:\n\n- A first look at all my future Mirror pieces before they go live. \n- A one hour working session to dive deeper into this thesis, and explore the rising players, trends and projects worth keeping an eye on. \n- 60 [FWB Pro](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/friends-with-benefits-pro) - good for access to [Friends With Benefits](https://fwb.help/) Season Two.\n\nThe link below shows where the $VALUE NFT lives on Zora. \n\nPlease only bid in WETH as to ensure backers can redeem their $VALUE!\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7/662)", "timestamp": 1622444253, "digest": "A16NP2XXi9RdHptfdF9WHR0Xq_E1XDmUgMwPmJYOG7w", "contributor": "0x46301F7E700Be9cFfCE3e5e142a2244Df3f2d4F2"}

So that's with **Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester OR Nick Srnicek.** \n\nThese conversations will happen after the first version of *Conversations on AI* is released, so you'll get to give your thoughts on the dialogues, and ask them anything else about their work that you might have in mind.\n\nAnd if you bought the dip over the weekend, or any of the other dips, and have some spare ETH burning a hole in your wallet, remember that the 0.75 ETH reward is a one-of-a-kind *Conversations on AI* poster by [Metahaven](https://twitter.com/mthvn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).\n\n## What if I don't have 0.5 ETH?\n\nAs well as trying to hit our 12-15 ETH target, our other main objective is for as many people to hold $IMPOSSIBLE as, well, possible, so please do consider backing us at any level you are able to. \n\nWe want to build as broad a community around this book as we can, and we want to invite you into the decision-making process around aspects of both the form and the content.\n\nI don't want this post to get too long, so will explain more on this tomorrow – keep an eye out!\n\nThe backer rewards in full are after the jump:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/986e0078-51c4-40be-bebc-a847e1e695ba.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\n\n**Every backer**\n- $IMPOSSIBLE tokens at the rate: 1 ETH = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE.\n- Proportional stakes in the sale of the book's NFT as described above.\n- Proportional voting power in Snapshot polls relating to the book.\n- Your name in the book's acknowledgements as one of those who supported the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto.\n\n**0.125 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- Invitation to a 2hr Zoom roundtable on AI, led by Reza Negarestani and featuring participants in the book.\n\n**0.5 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- *Zoom conversation with Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester OR Nick Srnicek (subject to availability).*\n- Plus one invitation to the Zoom roundtable.\n- Signed special edition of the book.\n- Limited edition Impossible Object merch.\n\n**0.75 ETH+**\n- The above, plus...\n- One-of-a-kind *Conversations on AI* poster by Metahaven.\n\n![El Arquetipo de la Repetición, Marta Minujin](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e7a7780e-7e08-4929-a45c-8eaa78c62954.jpeg?height=416&width=673)\n\n## AMA tomorrow\n\nIf you don't want to wait to put your questions to us, **join us tomorrow in an AMA on Impossible Object's [Telegram group](t.me/impossibleobject) at 15.30 EST / 12.30 PST.**\n\nHere are the details of the AMA:\n\n- The session will run for 30min\n- Because of the text-based format, send through your questions to the Telegram group in advance!
