{"id": "4euZJGIbVUMlkq0wJY9zbL1l5b1C9RKkSoQdwcWYbgc", "title": "DAO Nation", "body": "\nDAOs are simultaneously brilliantly simple and immensely complex, a contrast that is especially evident as I write this on the day of [Ethereum’s London hard fork](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/07/15/london-mainnet-announcement/). Behind this incompatibility lies endless opportunities for building, failure, iteration, and exploration. Here I hope to provide a brief summary of the current state of DAOs and make a few observations about these opportunities.\n\n### **What is a DAO?**\n\nOver the past 5 years, DAOs have evolved from an idea and [exploit that nearly ended Ethereum itself](https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists), to one of the most promising platforms for experimentation in the ways individuals and capital organize toward productive outcomes. These experiments currently number in the thousands, control over [$8B in capital](https://open-orgs.info), produce over [$100M in monthly on-chain revenue](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/protocol-revenue), and trustlessly coordinate thousands of members globally. Yet despite their immense impact, DAOs are quite simple in the abstract.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9eaf3836-c8d9-4d42-81db-d5aec7caf1c4.jpeg?height=944&width=1960)\n\n\n\nDAOs are a series of smart contracts that define two basic functions: ***who owns what & how decisions are made.*** In fact, they’re the same two essential functions that defined DAO’s predecessors: ***organizations*** (including companies, firms, investment funds, co-ops, communities, non-profits, and [possibly nation states](https://foresight.org/salon/balaji-s-srinivasan-the-network-state/)).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d6ffa222-91f8-4037-bc3a-00254dcd6d8a.jpeg?height=1598&width=1960)\n\n\n\nTo put this in the context of secular trends, DAOs are following the natural progression of digitization, in which everything from Information to Money becomes remixed into digitally native formats which are unequivocally better, faster, cheaper, and more accessible than their analog counterparts.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9c157654-ce7f-43bc-905c-303600d5a492.jpeg?height=1120&width=1960)\n\n\nThe technical progression toward digital organizations is relatively simple; however, the process is complicated by the off-chain participation of humans, who unlike smart contracts are fallible, require incentivization, and, most importantly, coordination. And as with traditional organizations, coordination and operational diligence become exponentially more important as a DAO and the underlying stakes grow. As with many things in crypto, the probability of hypergrowth in a compressed time frame is high, and what might start as a small experiment amongst friends or a weekend hackathon project can quickly become a significant piece of the [DAO landscape.](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a8a40a8-fb83-44e7-afe9-92418d5692d1.jpeg?height=1308&width=1960)\n\n\n\nNo truer is this the case than with Protocol DAOs like [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/governance), which have essentially “gone public” as multinational corporations with 1000s of shareholders (each with agency, through governance, over the direction the organization takes). This inverse maturation introduces a great deal of risk for the long term prospects of these DAOs, but also presents exciting opportunities for developing new templates, standards, tools, and infrastructure for such rapid organizational growth and the problems it brings.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here are a few (non-exhaustive) guiding ideas that I think will define the future of DAOs.\n\n### ***DAO tooling will explode.***\n\nI love to observe compensating behavior in the DAO ecosystem because it tends to define opportunity quite well in product development. Today, DAO’s reliance on Web 2 tools compensates for the lack of few native alternatives. This is slowly changing though, as tools that ease the burden of coordination are starting to gain traction in earnest. For example, interfaces like [Boardroom](https://www.boardroom.info) and [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) are enabling easier management of DAO member participation, while [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg) and [Orca](https://www.orcaprotocol.org) are unblocking throughput on hiring credible participants and giving them incentive structures to organize. These and future pieces of the work stack are critical to reducing reliance on blunt instruments like Twitter, Discord, and YouTube Live to inform, operate, and grow DAOs.   \n\nAlong with coordination, defraying the security risk of DAO funds and code deployment will be crucial as consequence scales. DAOs will need to maintain active management of security, from smart contract testing and monitoring, to credentialing of core contributors, to building an enduring treasury - and such efforts will require significant investment. Though early progress is being made with risk monitoring services like [Gauntlet](https://gauntlet.network), credential systems like [Spruce](https://www.spruceid.com), and treasury management tools like [Llama](https://llama.community) and [Parcel](https://parcel.money), the industry of hacking, fraud, and exploits is ever evolving (meaning the opportunity for building around these risks is only bound by the creativity of security adversaries).\n\n### ***Flexible privacy will become a prerequisite.***\n\nToday, all on-chain activity and the majority of governance activity is transparent. But total transparency presents some serious challenges that threaten the growth of DAOs as productive vehicles, particularly with respect to internal governance, talent acquisition, and innovation. \n\nFirst, without certain privacy safeguards, DAO stakeholders are vulnerable to off-chain coercion, thereby threatening the integrity of DAO governance. Without procedures to anonymize the voting process, outside parties can target individual stakeholders to influence decisions normally reserved for direct stakeholders, which in turn may disrupt the typical alignment between DAO and stakeholder interests. Again, as consequence scales so to does the possibility of nefarious forces working to influence the outcomes.\n\nSecond, without flexible privacy options, DAOs face an unnecessarily limited talent pool for hiring. Despite the ecosystem’s general preference for transparency, public salary negotiations and salary flows remain unpopular for individual workers in the space. And while pseudo anonymous workers are certainly prevalent in the early innings, it’s unlikely that this will become the standard mode of operating in the medium to long term.\n\nFinally, without basic privacy options regarding their workers and products, DAOs risk disincentivizing innovation and experimentation by its developers. The ability to identify individual contributors on the blockchain may invite unwelcome individual consequences for work done on behalf of the DAO, which in turn may discourage the kind of risk-taking that often leads to technological breakthroughs in the space. For example, without some element of privacy, a developer who deploys a buggy smart contract is at risk of real world retribution and liability. Though the likelihood of these negative outcomes may be low, protection by default should be adopted by DAOs building tech of consequence.\n\nInevitably, privacy vs. transparency amongst DAOs will exist on a spectrum, but without some blending of the two, progress may stall for some organizations. \n\n\n### ***DAOs don’t need to be monoliths.***\n\nI also want to note that although much of this post has assumed that DAOs will behave in a typically corporate manner, with decisions made to promote the profitability and longevity of the entity, the DAO structure also presents an opportunity to form an entirely different kind of entity - one that is characterized by small numbers of people coming together for short periods of time for very specific purposes.\n\n\nFor example, recently we saw the launch of [PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/), the first known experiment of an ephemeral DAO where 400+ individuals came together to purchase a highly sought after Crypto Punk. The DAO ownership will last in perpetuity - but had the group not been successful, the capital would have been returned. This novel approach to short-term pooling and distribution of capital is massively unexplored and provides an agile and exciting counterweight to the relative seriousness of protocol DAOs.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/213e3404-335b-47dd-8bae-43828fb7e2ab.jpeg?height=5516&width=8880)\n\n\n\n### ***Making money early misses the point.***\n\nExperimentation with capital and community have already resulted in many impactful outcomes. With monetary gain however comes the inevitable aftershocks of speculation, greed, and adverse selection. Tokens and the governance that they enable within DAOs are powerful tools when implemented thoughtfully, but when they are used as vehicles for capital formation without much beyond a superficial nod toward “governance,” they  risk bringing undue scrutiny to this nascent ecosystem.\n\nThere is absolutely merit to the wave of “treasury diversification” raises for teams that have put a great deal of thought into the initial mechanics for their native token, a reasonable use of funds, and a plan for the maturation of the community around the DAO. But token generation events are a one way door and once launched it’s extremely difficult to course correct should the initial implementation not satisfy the requirements for the organization or community around it.\n\nIn the end, it’s about ***building something worth governing*** rather than “governance” being the feature driving capital formation.\n\n### **Closing Thoughts**\n\nThe evolution of the DAO ecosystem is as chaotic as the hive minds that comprise it - and the pace at which ideas come and go can give even crypto veterans whiplash. As a result, many of the problems and opportunities I outline above may evolve or disappear entirely in the near future. But what won’t change is my excitement about the experimentation occurring, and the discoveries that are bound to result from the atoms of capital, community, protocols, and profit all repeatedly colliding.\n\nIf you’re building or experimenting around DAOs, [I’d love to talk!](https://twitter.com/crabbylions) If you’re getting started building or participating in DAOs, I'd recommend the following folks who have helped shape my point of view and this post:\n\n- [Julia Rosenberg](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze)\n- [Brian Flynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm)\n- [Larry Sukernik](https://twitter.com/lsukernik)\n- [Aaron Wright](https://twitter.com/awrigh01?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Kevin Nielsen](https://twitter.com/kevinknielsen?s=20)\n- [David Sun](https://twitter.com/dave4506)\n- [Regan Bozman](https://twitter.com/reganbozman?s=20)\n- [Linda Xie’s A Beginner’s Guide to DAOs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o)\n- [Cooper Turley’s DAO Landscape](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw)\n- [Vitalik Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413/7)\n- [Jesse Walden's The Ownership Economy](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/)\n\n### ***BONUS!!!*** \nI've been incredibly fortunate to work with some of the best designers in crypto over the last few years, and to help commemorate this snapshot of the current state of DAOs, I worked with [Patryk Adaś](https://twitter.com/patrykadas?lang=en) and [Mateusz Turbiński](https://twitter.com/MatTurbinski) to create an NFT ,***\"DAO Nations #1\"***, that is available for auction below.\n\nWhat I'm most excited about here (besides how 🔥 the NFT turned out) is that using Mirror's Auction + Split features, 50% of proceeds will go to support the awesome creative work of Mateusz & Patryk and 50% will be split evenly across donations to [Coin Center](https://www.coincenter.org) and [Gitcoin's Official Matching Pool Fund](https://gitcoin.co/grants/12/gitcoin-grants-official-matching-pool-fund), which will support the shaping of public policy for crypto and funding open source development in crypto.\n\n[Token #4503](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=4503&auctionId=0x847c7935e1795ccadb692c7ca9d57d97ba6582f6c12e307331a00f1c99145540)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n", "timestamp": 1629150804, "digest": "DwJ60O0R1IyRiPAZFBw4L05L3fd8PPxWnzDNedKtOas", "contributor": "0xe8d7527fB45160501126F4c6913cc29B59Cca4aD"}

Frothed to meet ya. 🌐 \n\n\n### **What do we even mean by \"frothy\"?** \n\nWe love explaining the essence of this verb, and the meanings that are rolled into it. \n\nWhen we say \"to froth\", we mean *to be genuinely excited, ideologically intrigued, socially consumed by something. And to stir shit up in beautiful ways.*\n\nAlso, for you powder + ocean chasers out there, YES, this is a term used a lot in surf/ skate/ slope communities. We have borrowed the best of this idiom, and vibe with its optimistic slant on the future of web3. \n\n### **What TF is *******Community Design*******?** \n\nCommunity Design is a framework for creating continual growth of web3 projects + the humans within their community fabric. We are a collective of web3-native strategists who **froth** community design. Frothy is all about a community-first approach to growth.\n\n### **Are we in a Community Renaissance?** \n\nCommunities are sacred. Communities have long been misunderstood. We are now living in a community renaissance. Launching and scaling projects in this community renaissance requires a dedicated community operating system.\n\n### **The Frothy OS / Manifesto**\nAt the heart of the Frothy OS are the relationships we build: the super nutrients to the web3 growth equation. The ecosystem can only grow by nurturing the community and social architecture in the right ways. We activate this through The Frothy Five.\n\n.\n**1. De-risking launches**\n- Community Design involves a smash up of architectural formats. It intersects social architecture, spatial design and behavioral psychology. Truly great community design involves crafting a unique feeling around a product and the holistic experience inside the metaverse. The feeling the community invokes needs to be inviting, supportive and expansive. It has to feel like family.\n\n**2. Metaverse vibe curation**\n- Inside each strong community lies a humming Meme factory that taps into the cultural zeitgeist. Part of the Community Design OS is recognizing that meme artistry + distribution is a core tool in the arsenal of growth tools. This goes beyond pixels and moon-centric dogs. At the crux of meme-creation is discernment of subculture subtleties and linguistic perception. Society has evolved due to memetic effects, through mimicry and remix. Its in our DNA. We believe it is absolutely in the DNA of community design methodology.\n\n**3. Community meme-making**\n- Inside each strong community lies a humming Meme factory that taps into the cultural zeitgeist. Part of the Community Design OS is recognizing that meme artistry + distribution is a core tool in the arsenal of growth tools. This goes beyond pixels and moon-centric dogs. At the crux of meme-creation is discernment of subculture subtleties and linguistic perception. Society has evolved due to memetic effects, through mimicry and remix. Its in our DNA. We believe it is absolutely in the DNA of community design methodology. \n\n\n**4. Contribution flywheel**\n- Great community design means shipping a product you know the community will value. Co-creation is king, + Queen. This means progressive acts of collaboration. Mobilizing a community to build with you is viable only when the community actually feel seen. The more seen the community feels, the more potent the contribution flywheel. The stronger the flywheel, the higher the retention, the more vigorous the virality. \n\n\n**5. The *fingerspitzengefühl***\n- We love this sneaky little German word. It cuts to the core of community not being a 'one-size-fits-all' kind of play. It basically translates to the \"fingertip feeling\" when you're so in tune with your allies, contributors, members, that you know exactly how your community is thinking and what lights them up.   \n\n\n\n### **Why Mirror?** \n\nOur intention is to share what the Frothy OS translates to, and how we can all win with more community-first strategies. We also intend to explore the community ecosystem opportunity from the current vantage point, and where we can all go from here.\n\n\n### **Froth out on this NFT...** \n\nIt just wouldn't feel right to release our first Mirror article without a bit of NFT froth factor. ❄️\n\nPaying homage to Earth's wild ecosystems and the **wildness of web3**. It is a very wild world our there, more so than ever\n\nAs we're shared with you, Frothy is all about the ecosystem. Building it, nurturing it, frothing it.

They asked if I was making a mistake telegraphing our investment thesis for everyone to see, including our “competitors.”\n\nWe strongly defended the practice and explained that the benefits of telling the world what we were looking to invest in, and why, strongly outweighed any costs. We explained that telegraphing would bring entrepreneurs to us.\n\nAnd that turned out to be the case. So many of our top-performing investments over the years came to us because of our telegraphing strategy. It is hard to know who is working on a problem you are interested in. But if you put the word out far and wide, they will find you.\n\nI was reminded of those conversations almost twenty years ago now when I read [this post on USV.com](https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/08/measurement-in-market-making/) by Hanel outlining [our interest in measuring carbon](https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/08/measurement-in-market-making/).

We know this precise time and date due to the innovation that makes SuperRare so exciting: our first  transaction, like the thousands that followed it, was immutably preserved on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n1,229 days later, more than $90M in NFT art has been sold by over 1,400 artists on SuperRare. Hobbies became careers. Digital projects became valuable assets. The digital transformation of the art market is no longer a dream—it has arrived.\n\nUnlike past artistic revolutions, this one affects more than the medium or style. It is a revolution of both form and function, curation and collection. The work itself is thrilling, dynamic and diverse, but we are equally excited about the opportunity unleashed by blockchain technologies: to put ownership in the hands of the artists, curators, collectors, and digital art community at large.\n\nWhile momentum and excitement have been growing, the digital art revolution is still in its infancy. Today, it’s taking its next big leap.\n\nWe are excited to announce a decentralized vision for the future of digital art, that puts the power where it should be—in the hands of the community. We began by helping spark a revolution for art. Today we spark a revolution for ownership.\n\nWelcome to SuperRare 2.0. Not a humble update, but a seismic shift driven by three major product advancements:\n\n**SuperRare Spaces:** Independently curated storefronts on SuperRare. For the first time, curation (and commissions) will be opened to new voices chosen by the SuperRare community, and beyond the SuperRare Labs core team.\n\n**SuperRare DAO:** A decentralized organization governed by $RARE holders and the SuperRare Governance Council tasked with overseeing SuperRare Spaces, the community treasury, and the platform’s future. The SuperRare Governance Council is a group of nominated community members that implement decisions based on the votes of $RARE token holders.\n\n**Sovereign Smart Contracts:** Independent artists on SuperRare can now deploy custom smart contracts and import artworks minted elsewhere.\n\nAnd finally, we’re excited to announce the release of the instrument through which Spaces and the DAO will be governed: the **$RARE curation token**.\n\n$RARE marks the first step in our ongoing commitment to progressive decentralization and continued disruption of the art market.\n\nSuperRare’s mission has always been to empower the next generation of artists through technology, enabling beauty and inspiration for the world to enjoy. And already, many SuperRare artists have risen to become familiar names in the world’s most prestigious galleries and collections. In the near future, we expect that the next great artistic talent will not be discovered by a gallerist or gatekeeper, but by the community of $RARE curators. \n\n\nThese are the broad strokes, but there are many more details to share and discuss. The following sections describe what we believe to be the most inspiring vision for the future of SuperRare based on the trajectory and momentum of this growing community. Find a comfy chair, fix yourself a spicy beverage, and find out how you can be a part of the revolution.\n\n## Introducing $RARE\n\nThoughtful, high quality curation is the single most important element of SuperRare's past and future success. Until now, every artist on SuperRare has been selected by the SuperRare Labs team, creating an artistic community with a reputation for quality and innovation.\n\nThis, however, must evolve.\n\nWhile we’re incredibly proud of how the SuperRare Labs team has led curation over the last 3 years, we also recognize we're not the only ones with an eye for undiscovered talent and artistic value. Nor should we risk becoming the digital version of the gatekeeping galleries we sought to disrupt. Therefore, the $RARE curation token is a means to identify and empower new curatorial talent in the SuperRare community.\n\nThe $RARE curation token will be used as the primary vehicle to onboard a growing network of curators, galleries, and collectives - all functioning as SuperRare Spaces: independently curated storefronts on SuperRare.\n\nThese curation decisions will be enacted using token-based voting with the community’s participation and implementation by the SuperRare Council.\n\nFinally, SuperRare is expanding to become a multi-contract platform - enabling artists to create custom, bespoke NFT minting contracts through a feature we're calling Sovereign Smart Contracts.\n\n## SuperRare Spaces\n\nSpaces are community-vetted galleries for curators, collectors and community members to highlight and release work through SuperRare.\n\nEach Space is overseen by a designated operator (or operators), chosen by a community vote of $RARE holders. Elected operators will choose and onboard their own artists, market as they see fit, and earn commissions on all sales through their Space. \n\nThe SuperRare DAO also earns an on-chain commission on sales from Spaces, giving token holders a direct incentive to pursue high quality curation of all Spaces added to the network. $RARE holders will be invited to vote on which spaces should go live next in a recurring vote. This will be  known as the Space Race (h/t to the Mirror [$WRITE RACE](https://mirror.xyz/race) who inspired this game mechanic).\n\nWe envision Spaces as the future of community-driven art curation—a vibrant ecosystem of curators, artist collectives, galleries, and community members, onboarding artists and collaborating on auctions, under the shared brand and technology of SuperRare.\n\nSuperRare Spaces mark the first way in which $RARE will fuel the continued growth of SuperRare. More information will be released in the coming weeks.\n\n## SuperRare DAO\n\nIn the spirit of progressive decentralization, SuperRare has begun routing all platform commissions and fees to a newly formed SuperRare DAO. Moving forward, the treasury will  always be viewable at superraredao.eth.\n\nThis community treasury containing $ETH and $RARE will be overseen by $RARE token holders, and governed by the community.\n\nSuperRare has appointed a genesis [Governance Council](https://docs.superrare.com/-MgljtGZUgy-ziYOWB30/the-superrare-dao) to oversee the funds stored in the SuperRare DAO upon launch. The Genesis Governance Council will enact the decisions of token holders, and provide a layer of security over a potentially massive amount of commissions that will be routed to the DAO from now through the end of history.\n\nDecentralization has been at the center of the SuperRare ideology since day one. During the early stages of platform development, it was practical to keep governance decisions internal, driven by the vision of an agile founding team. However our baby is now all grown up, and ready to face the world on its own. As the expression goes: if you love something, set it free.\n\nSuperRare is now in the hands of the community.\n\n## Sovereign Smart Contracts \n\nWe believe that artists are sovereign actors and should control their own destiny. Thus SuperRare is expanding to become a multi-contract platform, enabling artists to create custom, bespoke NFT minting contracts we're calling [Sovereign Smart Contracts](https://docs.superrare.com/-MgljtGZUgy-ziYOWB30/the-next-generation-nft-platform/sovereign-minting-contracts). \n\nThis means that in addition to minting SUPR tokens, independent artists on SuperRare will be able to mint their own artist or project-branded tokens.\n\n## Claiming the $RAREdrop\n\nOur commitment to a decentralized vision has never wavered, and today we are taking the first steps to transfer ownership in SuperRare to the community that has helped us get here.\n\nIf you are a SuperRare artist or collector, congratulations! As of today you are a part of the platform.\n\n150,000,000 $RARE - 15% of the total supply of 1 billion $RARE -  is now available for claim by the SuperRare community.\n\nThe $RARE contract address is 0xba5BDe662c17e2aDFF1075610382B9B691296350.\n\nPlease triple check that you are interacting with the correct address as there are likely to be malicious actors looking to take advantage of this development.\n\n**To see if you’re eligible for the airdrop**, [GO HERE.\n](http://superrare.com/rare/claim)\n\nEligible participants will have received a personalized email recapping your presence on SuperRare to date and detailing the amount of $RARE you can claim.\n\nThe $RAREdrop was calculated as a mix of core actions buying and/or selling art on SuperRare prior to the cutoff date of July 21, 2021.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/94bae1d8-7885-4ee2-bfec-1191f9db68f0.png?height=1251&width=1251)\n\nThe primary goal of this airdrop is to reward those who have been most influential in the platform’s commercial success to date, while also rewarding those who produced artistic value over a longer time horizon—regardless of the size of total sales. But the job is far from finished. We expect and hope that the $RARE token recipients are incentivized to continue developing, governing and adding value to the SuperRare ecosystem moving forward. \n\nEligible participants may claim their tokens within a 90-day window from this announcement, after which any unclaimed tokens will be reverted to the community treasury.\n\nThis is an exciting time to be a creator and collector, and we can’t wait to see what comes next as governance is turned over to those who create value in the network. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5e69b1fc-a6dd-430f-b1b8-2669b6b06529.png?height=1251&width=1251)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/50705a46-5b14-437a-bb38-dd55c89aeec9.png?height=1251&width=1251)\n\nFor more details on the token distribution, unlock schedules, vesting and $RAREdrop mechanics, please read the [SuperRare Network docs](https://docs.superrare.com/-MgljtGZUgy-ziYOWB30/).\n\n## What comes next?\n\nThat’s up to you—and the community of $RARE owners. Shaping the future of digital art is no small responsibility. Are you ready?\n\nPlease join us on Discord, where we’ve created a gated hub solely for $RARE holders. Unlocking these channels is simple: open our Discord and type !JOIN in any public channel. \n\nAfter verifying your holdings with the CollabLand bot, you’ll soon be chatting with fellow $RARE vanguards to begin authoring the future.\n\nWe would like to take this moment to recognize all the artists, collectors and curators who have played a pivotal role in making SuperRare what it is today. Without you, SuperRare would not have become a pillar of the CryptoArt ecosystem that we all know and love.\n\nAs exciting as the last three years have been, it has been little more than the planting of seeds. The future of SuperRare and the CryptoArt community as a whole has yet to be written, and we will take this journey—and build this digital renaissance—together.\n\nOur world and our species benefits immeasurably from artistry and creativity, and we’ll strive to unleash it for creators, collectors, and even casual observers to enjoy.\n\nThis is all moving fast. Follow us on Twitter at @SuperRare to stay up to date on news about $RARE, the SuperRare DAO, Spaces, and everything in between. \n\nDon your robes. Grab your gavel.

Thus SuperRare is expanding to become a multi-contract platform, enabling artists to create custom, bespoke NFT minting contracts we're calling [Sovereign Smart Contracts](https://docs.superrare.com/the-next-generation-nft-platform/sovereign-minting-contracts). \n\nThis means that in addition to minting SUPR tokens, independent artists on SuperRare will be able to mint their own artist or project-branded tokens.\n\n## Claiming the $RAREdrop\n\nOur commitment to a decentralized vision has never wavered, and today we are taking the first steps to transfer ownership in SuperRare to the community that has helped us get here.\n\nIf you are a SuperRare artist or collector, congratulations! As of today you are a part of the platform.\n\n150,000,000 $RARE - 15% of the total supply of 1 billion $RARE -  is now available for claim by the SuperRare community.\n\nThe $RARE contract address is 0xba5BDe662c17e2aDFF1075610382B9B691296350.\n\nPlease triple check that you are interacting with the correct address as there are likely to be malicious actors looking to take advantage of this development.\n\n**To see if you’re eligible for the airdrop**, [GO HERE.\n](http://superrare.com/rare/claim)\n\nEligible participants will have received a personalized email recapping your presence on SuperRare to date and detailing the amount of $RARE you can claim.\n\nThe $RAREdrop was calculated as a mix of core actions buying and/or selling art on SuperRare prior to the cutoff date of July 21, 2021.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/94bae1d8-7885-4ee2-bfec-1191f9db68f0.png?height=1251&width=1251)\n\nThe primary goal of this airdrop is to reward those who have been most influential in the platform’s commercial success to date, while also rewarding those who produced artistic value over a longer time horizon—regardless of the size of total sales. But the job is far from finished. We expect and hope that the $RARE token recipients are incentivized to continue developing, governing and adding value to the SuperRare ecosystem moving forward. \n\nEligible participants may claim their tokens within a 90-day window from this announcement, after which any unclaimed tokens will be reverted to the community treasury.\n\nThis is an exciting time to be a creator and collector, and we can’t wait to see what comes next as governance is turned over to those who create value in the network. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5e69b1fc-a6dd-430f-b1b8-2669b6b06529.png?height=1251&width=1251)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/50705a46-5b14-437a-bb38-dd55c89aeec9.png?height=1251&width=1251)\n\nFor more details on the token distribution, unlock schedules, vesting and $RAREdrop mechanics, please read the [SuperRare Network docs](https://docs.superrare.com/).\n\n## What comes next?\n\nThat’s up to you—and the community of $RARE owners.

{"id": "kmhevmvhIpoeUuHZQSJtiGIIaCaEZ9zEcq3dLK11vUI", "title": "DAO Nation", "body": "\nDAOs are simultaneously brilliantly simple and immensely complex, a contrast that is especially evident as I write this on the day of [Ethereum’s London hard fork](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/07/15/london-mainnet-announcement/). Behind this incompatibility lies endless opportunities for building, failure, iteration, and exploration. Here I hope to provide a brief summary of the current state of DAOs and make a few observations about these opportunities.\n\n### **What is a DAO?**\n\nOver the past 5 years, DAOs have evolved from an idea and [exploit that nearly ended Ethereum itself](https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists), to one of the most promising platforms for experimentation in the ways individuals and capital organize toward productive outcomes. These experiments currently number in the thousands, control over [$8B in capital](https://open-orgs.info), produce over [$100M in monthly on-chain revenue](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/protocol-revenue), and trustlessly coordinate thousands of members globally. Yet despite their immense impact, DAOs are quite simple in the abstract.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9eaf3836-c8d9-4d42-81db-d5aec7caf1c4.jpeg?height=944&width=1960)\n\n\n\nDAOs are a series of smart contracts that define two basic functions: ***who owns what & how decisions are made.*** In fact, they’re the same two essential functions that defined DAO’s predecessors: ***organizations*** (including companies, firms, investment funds, co-ops, communities, non-profits, and [possibly nation states](https://foresight.org/salon/balaji-s-srinivasan-the-network-state/)).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d6ffa222-91f8-4037-bc3a-00254dcd6d8a.jpeg?height=1598&width=1960)\n\n\n\nTo put this in the context of secular trends, DAOs are following the natural progression of digitization, in which everything from Information to Money becomes remixed into digitally native formats which are unequivocally better, faster, cheaper, and more accessible than their analog counterparts.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9c157654-ce7f-43bc-905c-303600d5a492.jpeg?height=1120&width=1960)\n\n\nThe technical progression toward digital organizations is relatively simple; however, the process is complicated by the off-chain participation of humans, who unlike smart contracts are fallible, require incentivization, and, most importantly, coordination. And as with traditional organizations, coordination and operational diligence become exponentially more important as a DAO and the underlying stakes grow. As with many things in crypto, the probability of hypergrowth in a compressed time frame is high, and what might start as a small experiment amongst friends or a weekend hackathon project can quickly become a significant piece of the [DAO landscape.](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a8a40a8-fb83-44e7-afe9-92418d5692d1.jpeg?height=1308&width=1960)\n\n\n\nNo truer is this the case than with Protocol DAOs like [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/governance), which have essentially “gone public” as multinational corporations with 1000s of shareholders (each with agency, through governance, over the direction the organization takes). This inverse maturation introduces a great deal of risk for the long term prospects of these DAOs, but also presents exciting opportunities for developing new templates, standards, tools, and infrastructure for such rapid organizational growth and the problems it brings.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here are a few (non-exhaustive) guiding ideas that I think will define the future of DAOs.\n\n### ***DAO tooling will explode.***\n\nI love to observe compensating behavior in the DAO ecosystem because it tends to define opportunity quite well in product development. Today, DAO’s reliance on Web 2 tools compensates for the lack of few native alternatives. This is slowly changing though, as tools that ease the burden of coordination are starting to gain traction in earnest. For example, interfaces like [Boardroom](https://www.boardroom.info) and [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) are enabling easier management of DAO member participation, while [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg) and [Orca](https://www.orcaprotocol.org) are unblocking throughput on hiring credible participants and giving them incentive structures to organize. These and future pieces of the work stack are critical to reducing reliance on blunt instruments like Twitter, Discord, and YouTube Live to inform, operate, and grow DAOs.   \n\nAlong with coordination, defraying the security risk of DAO funds and code deployment will be crucial as consequence scales. DAOs will need to maintain active management of security, from smart contract testing and monitoring, to credentialing of core contributors, to building an enduring treasury - and such efforts will require significant investment. Though early progress is being made with risk monitoring services like [Gauntlet](https://gauntlet.network), credential systems like [Spruce](https://www.spruceid.com), and treasury management tools like [Llama](llama.xyz) and [Parcel](https://parcel.money), the industry of hacking, fraud, and exploits is ever evolving (meaning the opportunity for building around these risks is only bound by the creativity of security adversaries).\n\n### ***Flexible privacy will become a prerequisite.***\n\nToday, all on-chain activity and the majority of governance activity is transparent. But total transparency presents some serious challenges that threaten the growth of DAOs as productive vehicles, particularly with respect to internal governance, talent acquisition, and innovation. \n\nFirst, without certain privacy safeguards, DAO stakeholders are vulnerable to off-chain coercion, thereby threatening the integrity of DAO governance. Without procedures to anonymize the voting process, outside parties can target individual stakeholders to influence decisions normally reserved for direct stakeholders, which in turn may disrupt the typical alignment between DAO and stakeholder interests. Again, as consequence scales so to does the possibility of nefarious forces working to influence the outcomes.\n\nSecond, without flexible privacy options, DAOs face an unnecessarily limited talent pool for hiring. Despite the ecosystem’s general preference for transparency, public salary negotiations and salary flows remain unpopular for individual workers in the space. And while pseudo anonymous workers are certainly prevalent in the early innings, it’s unlikely that this will become the standard mode of operating in the medium to long term.\n\nFinally, without basic privacy options regarding their workers and products, DAOs risk disincentivizing innovation and experimentation by its developers. The ability to identify individual contributors on the blockchain may invite unwelcome individual consequences for work done on behalf of the DAO, which in turn may discourage the kind of risk-taking that often leads to technological breakthroughs in the space. For example, without some element of privacy, a developer who deploys a buggy smart contract is at risk of real world retribution and liability. Though the likelihood of these negative outcomes may be low, protection by default should be adopted by DAOs building tech of consequence.\n\nInevitably, privacy vs. transparency amongst DAOs will exist on a spectrum, but without some blending of the two, progress may stall for some organizations. \n\n\n### ***DAOs don’t need to be monoliths.***\n\nI also want to note that although much of this post has assumed that DAOs will behave in a typically corporate manner, with decisions made to promote the profitability and longevity of the entity, the DAO structure also presents an opportunity to form an entirely different kind of entity - one that is characterized by small numbers of people coming together for short periods of time for very specific purposes.\n\n\nFor example, recently we saw the launch of [PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/), the first known experiment of an ephemeral DAO where 400+ individuals came together to purchase a highly sought after Crypto Punk. The DAO ownership will last in perpetuity - but had the group not been successful, the capital would have been returned. This novel approach to short-term pooling and distribution of capital is massively unexplored and provides an agile and exciting counterweight to the relative seriousness of protocol DAOs.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/213e3404-335b-47dd-8bae-43828fb7e2ab.jpeg?height=5516&width=8880)\n\n\n\n### ***Making money early misses the point.***\n\nExperimentation with capital and community have already resulted in many impactful outcomes. With monetary gain however comes the inevitable aftershocks of speculation, greed, and adverse selection. Tokens and the governance that they enable within DAOs are powerful tools when implemented thoughtfully, but when they are used as vehicles for capital formation without much beyond a superficial nod toward “governance,” they  risk bringing undue scrutiny to this nascent ecosystem.\n\nThere is absolutely merit to the wave of “treasury diversification” raises for teams that have put a great deal of thought into the initial mechanics for their native token, a reasonable use of funds, and a plan for the maturation of the community around the DAO. But token generation events are a one way door and once launched it’s extremely difficult to course correct should the initial implementation not satisfy the requirements for the organization or community around it.\n\nIn the end, it’s about ***building something worth governing*** rather than “governance” being the feature driving capital formation.\n\n### **Closing Thoughts**\n\nThe evolution of the DAO ecosystem is as chaotic as the hive minds that comprise it - and the pace at which ideas come and go can give even crypto veterans whiplash. As a result, many of the problems and opportunities I outline above may evolve or disappear entirely in the near future. But what won’t change is my excitement about the experimentation occurring, and the discoveries that are bound to result from the atoms of capital, community, protocols, and profit all repeatedly colliding.\n\nIf you’re building or experimenting around DAOs, [I’d love to talk!](https://twitter.com/crabbylions) If you’re getting started building or participating in DAOs, I'd recommend the following folks who have helped shape my point of view and this post:\n\n- [Julia Rosenberg](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze)\n- [Brian Flynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm)\n- [Larry Sukernik](https://twitter.com/lsukernik)\n- [Aaron Wright](https://twitter.com/awrigh01?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Kevin Nielsen](https://twitter.com/kevinknielsen?s=20)\n- [David Sun](https://twitter.com/dave4506)\n- [Regan Bozman](https://twitter.com/reganbozman?s=20)\n- [Linda Xie’s A Beginner’s Guide to DAOs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o)\n- [Cooper Turley’s DAO Landscape](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw)\n- [Vitalik Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413/7)\n- [Jesse Walden's The Ownership Economy](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/)\n\n### ***BONUS!!!*** \nI've been incredibly fortunate to work with some of the best designers in crypto over the last few years, and to help commemorate this snapshot of the current state of DAOs, I worked with [Patryk Adaś](https://twitter.com/patrykadas?lang=en) and [Mateusz Turbiński](https://twitter.com/MatTurbinski) to create an NFT ,***\"DAO Nations #1\"***, that is available for auction below.\n\nWhat I'm most excited about here (besides how 🔥 the NFT turned out) is that using Mirror's Auction + Split features, 50% of proceeds will go to support the awesome creative work of Mateusz & Patryk and 50% will be split evenly across donations to [Coin Center](https://www.coincenter.org) and [Gitcoin's Official Matching Pool Fund](https://gitcoin.co/grants/12/gitcoin-grants-official-matching-pool-fund), which will support the shaping of public policy for crypto and funding open source development in crypto.\n\n[Token #4503](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=4503&auctionId=0x847c7935e1795ccadb692c7ca9d57d97ba6582f6c12e307331a00f1c99145540)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n", "timestamp": 1629219208, "digest": "DwJ60O0R1IyRiPAZFBw4L05L3fd8PPxWnzDNedKtOas", "contributor": "0xe8d7527fB45160501126F4c6913cc29B59Cca4aD"}

Since opening, we have been hosting in-person experiences for live NFT minting, drops, auctions, and curated art shows. \n\nWe are organized as a on-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and are governed by a group of founding members using the Bright Moments token BRT.\n\nOur Venice Beach gallery has been home to a series of events including:\n\n* [BAYC- Aped LA](https://twitter.com/APEDcollective/status/1421648094471495680?s=20)\n* [Portals NFT Drop by Jeff Davis (Art Blocks)](https://twitter.com/jeffgdavis/status/1407423664245465088?s=20)\n* [Spirit Bomb: ORIGINS NFT Drop by Boreta and Strangeloop](https://twitter.com/spiritbomb_ai/status/1420142381463048193?s=20)\n* [Electric Psychedelia NFT Drop by Ellie Pritts & Chuck Anderson (NoPattern)](https://twitter.com/elliepritts/status/1420430270725955589?s=20)\n* [Active Abstractions NFT Drop by Andrew Bensen (Pixlpa)](https://twitter.com/pixlpa/status/1423650066938560514?s=20)\n* [Bauhaus x Coldie NFT Drop](https://twitter.com/Saaamsonite/status/1425128823289380868?s=20)\n* [Casey Reas genesis ArtBlocks NFT drop: Century](https://artblocks.io/project/100)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e99dec0b-c309-405f-82b6-fda9d9117ca6.png?height=1999&width=1999)\n\n### [CryptoVenetians](https://artblocks.io/project/95/gallery)\n\nCryptoVenetians are a limited release NFT pixel-art collection based on real people from Venice. [CryptoVenetians were created to introduce people to crypto through a friendly on-ramp that combines a memorable experiential minting process with an education in wallet software and security best practices](https://youtu.be/hfg2t79ZVZo). \n\nThe only way to receive a CryptoVenetian is to physically visit the Bright Moments gallery and experience a live reveal. ***We gave away CryptoVenetians for free*** so anyone could have the opportunity to mint their own generative art. The goal was to make the minting process as educational and fun as possible, while providing access to unique benefits that are tied to local communities.\n\n[](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/nyc-reveal-video.mp4?controls=true)\n\nWe minted the CryptoVenetian #0 on June 22, 2021 and continued to mint 1-20 CVs per day until we reached CryptoVenetian #691 on August 10th. At the time, we had close to 2,000 people on our CV minting waitlist, [700 ETH in secondary sales and a floor price above 5 ETH](https://dune.xyz/rantum/Art-Blocks?ProjectID=95).  \n\nIn addition to providing economic relief for [those](https://twitter.com/RottenBeach/status/1422625435741999110?s=20) in [need](https://twitter.com/IrinaLiakh/status/1426468885302157316?s=20), we helped some of the most [influential executives](https://twitter.com/philmohun/status/1421922705385811968?s=20) and most [celebrated athletes](https://twitter.com/cryptovenetians/status/1425157242366484482?s=20) generate and collect their first NFTs.\n\nUnfortunately, [on the morning of August 11th, the CryptoVenetian project was targeted and CryptoVenetians #692 - 999 were stolen and minted illegally](https://twitter.com/cryptovenetians/status/1425552790600830979?s=20). This robbed 309 members of our community from enjoying a live mint experience[.](https://redlion.news/issues/issue-48)  \n\nFortunately, with the help of our Discord and Twitter communities, and the transparency and the accountability of the blockchain, [we were able to analyze what happened and identify those responsible for stealing our CryptoVenetians](https://twitter.com/IrinaLiakh/status/1426468885302157316?s=20).  We are now putting systems in place to prevent this from happening again.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5beab63a-127d-4f48-9d26-4c053b886163.png?height=1800&width=1800)\n\n### CryptoNewYorkers\n\nThis Fall, we will be expanding our gallery to New York City as the next step in our roadmap. CryptoNewYorkers is a limited-release generative art collection inspired by the people who make the Big Apple everything it is. Just as there are four unique backgrounds for CryptoVenetians representing different times of day, there will be four different backgrounds of CryptoNewYorkers representing different seasons.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7a74b4af-902e-40b1-bb85-6bc9df743417.png?height=1800&width=1800)\n\nOur goal with CryptoNewYorkers is to expand our community geographically while staying connected to our existing CryptoVenetian holders. It is impossible to provide all CV holders with a live minting experience, while at the same time introducing new members to this unique process.  \n\nSo we have started by providing a guaranteed reservation to mint a CryptoNewYorker to a small group of collectors who have held onto their CV since it was minted for the first time. \n\nIn order to claim a CryptoNewYorker minting spot, you will need a Golden Token New York (GTNY) ERC-721 token in your ETH wallet.  You will only be able to mint one CryptoNewYorker.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6c25b538-aba6-4021-b159-3ed877efeda2.png?height=1800&width=1800)\n\n### GTNY: Golden Token New York\n\nToday, we are introducing the CryptoNewYorkers collection by releasing 200 Golden Token New York (GTNY) minting spots. Holders of GTNY will be entitled to schedule minting sessions during our 100 day pop-up in New York City.   \n\nOur 1,000 GTNY distribution plan is as follows:\n\n* 200 GTNY for sale via Mirror\n* 500 GTNY reserved for distribution to deserving New Yorkers\n* 200 GTNY for original CryptoVenetian hodlers, BRT DAO members, and those impacted by the CV Heist\n* 100 GTNY airdropped randomly into the wallets of those currently holding CryptoVenetians\n\nWe will be making announcements and providing live updates on the drop in our Discord server.

The posts, the stories, the memes, and even the likes you make on other people's content. Imagine them all floating in the air in front of you, forming a cloud. \n\nWhen we post on social media, it often feels like we're releasing something that's weighing us down. As if our content is just a series of shells we've each outgrown; a trail of breadcrumbs we leave behind as we attempt to self-actualize together. Something to be discarded, not something to be treasured. A liability, not an asset.\n\nBut in the back of our minds, we remember that it has to be valuable to somebody, right? We're supposed to be living in the age where \"data is the new oil\". We've all read the headlines about how Facebook sells our data. Yet somehow, the entire thing still feels like a big blur, like we don't really understand how we each fit into the equation. This feeling is not an accident.

It's a lot.\n\nBecause as I'm sure you realize, your data isn't like an old piece of fruit that you left in the back of your fridge. It has an infinite shelf life. And in fact, its value only continues to go up over time, the more of it that you can collect. \n\nThis one irrevocable IP clause, hidden deep inside every Terms of Service agreement that we've blindly agree to, is the key to every single one of these companies being able to sell ads; the key to their ability to make money.\n\nWhen Mark Zuckerberg says \"we're a metaverse company now\", he isn't just talking about VR, he's referring to the collectively-created cloud of media over which Facebook has perpetual usage rights. **This is the Metaverse**, and he is quietly reminding us that he owns it.
