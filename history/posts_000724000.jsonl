{"id": "yPcdf7_jIdM4B0fAMfazvjkgnCCrX_ssdOlKm5sod2w", "title": "A beginner's guide to NFTs", "body": "### What are NFTs?\n\nNon-fungible token (NFT) is a term used to describe a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. Assets that can be represented as NFTs range from digital goods, such as items that exist within virtual worlds, to claims on physical assets such as clothing items or real estate. In the coming years, we will see NFTs used to unlock entirely new use cases that are only made possible by crypto.\n\n![**Tokens redeemable for real world goods on [Zora](https://store.zora.co/)**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9799dae1-c2c9-4712-813b-10b23c279a36.jpeg)\n\nWhile the Ethereum ecosystem is where most NFT activity has taken place to date, NFTs can exist on other smart contract platforms too. This is because, at their core, NFTs are just digital abstractions used to represent assets that are one of a kind. Non-fungible token isn’t the most intuitive term since we don’t commonly refer to the fungibility of objects in the physical world, but this is an important technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain. The goal for this post is not to detail every project within the NFT space, but to give a high level overview of what NFTs are, why they are interesting, and showcase some of their potential use cases.\n\n\n### Why are NFTs interesting?\n\nNFTs are powerful because, when combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to issue, own, and trade them. This makes interacting with NFTs significantly more efficient than in traditional platforms. The same reason why cryptocurrency used in payments is more efficient than traditional payments, that it is borderless and significantly easier to transfer, applies to NFTs. For example, if you want to create tradable in-game items as a game developer, then you can instantly have them be tradable through protocols that allow for decentralized exchange of NFTs. You don’t have to create your own marketplace or go through the onboarding process of a centralized platform in order to have the items be tradable.\n\nNFT activity can go well past trading and include actions like being able to borrow and lend, support fractional ownership (e.g. [NIFTEX](https://www.niftex.com/)), or use it as collateral in taking out a loan (e.g. [NFTfi](https://nftfi.com/)). The possibilities are endless when you have the ability to combine NFTs with DeFi building blocks. For example, the game [Aavegotchi](http://aavegotchi.com) combines DeFi and NFT gaming where each Aavegotchi character represents a user’s collateral that is deposited within the lending platform [Aave](https://aave.com/), but you can also battle the characters, level them up, and equip wearables that change their traits.\n\n![**Aavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1259686-6b61-455a-a204-f6e6da648f10.jpeg)\n\nNFTs can cover an extremely wide variety of areas given they are simply digital representations of ownership but there has been significant growth within art and gaming in particular. Note that many digital works of art and gaming items are a subset of a larger category of NFT collectibles. There is also the emerging space of social tokens, which sometimes falls into the NFT category or that is closely related to it.\n\n\n### Art\n\nNFTs can make fractionalized ownership more accessible, so if there is a valuable item that otherwise wouldn’t have been accessible for someone to own, now they can own a piece of it. Custody of a physical item still requires a trustworthy custodian, but being able to issue, hold, and trade it as a cryptoasset unlocks more use cases. One can also craft an NFT such that the creator receives a percentage of all secondary sales in a completely automated way. Artists typically don’t receive a cut of secondary sales in the traditional art world. \n\nProgrammable art is another interesting concept where a piece of artwork can incorporate on-chain data to dynamically update certain features or characteristics of the work. For example, one could create a piece of programmable art whose background changes if the price of ether goes above a certain dollar-value. There are countless creative possibilities.\n\n![**Rutger van der Tas [artwork](https://async.art/art/master/0x6c424c25e9f1fff9642cb5b7750b0db7312c29ad-83) that changes based on if it’s day or night**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a51670c0-4a1c-4aaf-917d-0e551855b56d.jpeg)\n\n[Async Art](https://async.art/) is a digital art marketplace known for programmable art. Many artists on Async sell artwork where someone is able to own the “master” copy which consists of a number of individual layers, but other people can own the individual layers and adjust their attributes over time. Imagine groups of people being able to own art collectively, where members of the group manage attributes of the work.\n\n![**Osinachi [artwork](https://async.art/art/master/0x6c424c25e9f1fff9642cb5b7750b0db7312c29ad-118) that includes a master and layers that can be individually adjusted**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fea07c75-8b3c-4592-b8f2-f5d6d92e544c.jpeg)\n\nA common question about digital artwork is what can you do with it? These works can be displayed in digital frames in a physical setting for people to enjoy. The digital artist Beeple sold physical tokens along with his digital NFTs and made [$3.5 million](https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x6e5dc5405baefb8c0166bcc78d2692777f2cbffb/21) from sales in an auction on the Nifty Gateway marketplace.\n\n![**Artist Beeple’s physical token that came with the NFT sale**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8689be31-b33f-46ac-94aa-feea3a1b3dd1.jpeg)\n\nDigital artwork can also be displayed in online collections like a [SuperRare profile](https://superrare.co/thevault/collection) as well as in virtual worlds. There are a number of art galleries within [Cryptovoxels](http://cryptovoxels.com), a virtual world where users can buy and sell land parcels as NFTs. As virtual reality spaces become more popular, having digital art to display will become more common. This wouldn’t be much different than someone spending money on video game items to customize a character’s appearance, already a multi-billion dollar industry. \n\n![**Digital art gallery in Cryptovoxels**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7386d358-d43d-4934-9ea5-b51c33932365.jpeg)\n\nA common skepticism is that someone can just take a screenshot of the image or get a digital file so it’s not really scarce. However, the same argument could apply to physical items as well. Anyone can take a photo of the Mona Lisa or create a replica of it, but it isn’t the real item from the artist. People are willing to pay a premium for the original work. Another interesting aspect of digital art or collectibles is that you can easily verify the item’s ownership history. Some digital items might be worth more depending on who owned it in the past.\n\nWith NFTs, you can also prove that the item is real and tamper proof. This is an issue in the physical collectibles space. For example, a [T206 Honus Wagner baseball card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T206_Honus_Wagner) was sold to Wayne Gretzky for $451k and sold again for several million dollars. One of the sellers of the card later admitted in court to trimming the card’s edges to make it look better. You can ensure NFT supply doesn’t change and there’s no counterfeit or continued printing. For example, there are many [counterfeit Black Lotus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAvLC3fz068&) cards in the popular game Magic: The Gathering. Common verification methods include bending the card to make sure it doesn’t crease or going through centralized grading services whose rating significantly affects the card's value. \n\n\n### Gaming\n\nSteam, a popular video game platform, has a [Community Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/?) where in-game items can be bought and sold. Steam’s marketplace is centralized and collects a transaction fee of 5% for each item from the buyer. Games like Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 take an additional fee of 10% for their items sold.\n\n\n![**Steam Community Market**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ad85fcf-b986-4b60-9fb5-925200fde3a9.jpeg)\n\n\nSteam also restricts user wallet balances to $2,000 and the price of a single item to $1,800. While these cases are outliers, many in-game items can actually sell for significantly larger amounts such as the [DotA 2 pink war dog courier](https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-06-dota-2-pink-war-dog-courier-sells-for-38-000.html) for $38,000. Within the crypto space there have also been high priced sales such as the $170,000 [CryptoKitty](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/most-expensive-cryptokitty/). Similarly Magic: The Gathering’s coveted [Black Lotus](https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/5/18251623/magic-the-gathering-black-lotus-auction-price) card sold for $166,100. There is certainly demand for valuable in-game items. In decentralized marketplaces, there isn’t a limit imposed on what game items can be sold and for what amount.\n\nDecentralized marketplaces can significantly reduce transaction fees due to the improved efficiency of starting up and operating a marketplace. Marketplaces can also improve overall user experience and increase interest in the game. Hearthstone is a wildly popular digital collectible card game created by Blizzard Entertainment that had over [100 million players](https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/hearthstone-has-over-100-million-players-1203019919/) in 2018. Hearthstone opted to not have a marketplace for their cards which leaves opportunity for other digital collectible card games that allow for an open marketplace. [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) and [SkyWeaver](https://www.skyweaver.net/) are two trading card games (TCGs) that have cards that are freely tradable. You are also able to earn cards as you level up in the game. Players that did not purchase packs of cards will still be able to improve upon the game’s default decks. It’s an exciting feeling knowing that the earned cards have real world value and can be sold or traded for other cards. Gods Unchained also lets users earn tokens for when they win a match or refer their friend. The tokens themselves unlock rare in-game items and are also freely tradable.\n\n\n![**Gods Unchained**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa82c586-39b6-46b1-ae55-cb8a2e44c8e1.jpeg)\n\n\nOne of the most popular games in crypto is [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/). You battle with a team of pet Axies and level them up. There's no aspect of the gameplay that feels like a blockchain game but there is the added benefit of being able to openly trade the Axies on NFT marketplaces such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). The game has become popular in the [Philippines](https://www.coindesk.com/nft-game-filipinos-covid) and earning tokens from the game has become a viable source of income for players even [beating minimum wage](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/07/08/axie-infinity-beats-minimum-wage-in-many-countries/) in many countries. There is also a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called [Yield Guild Games](https://yieldguild.io/) which leases Axies to players that want to get started with the game but don’t have the funds to purchase them. Several rare Axies were even [purchased](https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/why-we-spent-159k-on-digital-battle-pets-2/) for $159,000 total.\n\n\n![**Axie Infinity battle**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/26353bcc-0d05-47ea-89ac-fcdc9d2dd848.jpeg)\n\n\nThere’s another popular game [Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/) where you can explore different planets and collect Artifact NFTs on new planets, which give bonuses when attached to the planet. Being able to discover and collect these items or even win them in a battle and then trade them in decentralized marketplaces can make the game even more fun.\n\n![Planet in Dark Forest which has an Artifact NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/be66b61a-05f0-46b7-aa8f-f7ed542d5cd3.jpeg)\n\nOne concern with making in-game items tradable is that the ability to trade items can negatively affect the gameplay as people are focused on extracting value from the system or only the players that are willing to pay a lot of money for items can enjoy the game. Diablo III had an auction house where users could trade in-game items for in-game currency and cash. It was [shut down](https://www.wired.com/2013/09/diablo-auction-house/) because of how it affected the game. It was no longer fun and rewarding since players would just buy the best loot. In Diablo III, having the best loot was essentially the goal of the game so having an auction house severely affected gameplay whereas other games are not set up this way. It’s important for game developers to find a balance on what should be freely traded for their game (e.g. skins rather than weapons, [game time](https://secure.eveonline.com/plex/) itself can be traded, etc).\n\n\n### Social tokens\n\nThe emerging area of social tokens grew significantly in 2020. Social tokens are a broad category of tokens issued by individuals and communities. This term encompasses other similar terms like personal token, community token, and creator token. So far there hasn’t been a standardized term but I will use social tokens to refer to the broader category. Social tokens enable creators and communities to have more ownership in what they are building which is extremely exciting.\n\n\n![Social tokens map created by Forefront and Seedclub in [Social Tokens Year in Review](https://2020inreview.forefront.news/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b9316db6-25dd-4c4e-bbb2-b18cfa9a7890.jpeg)\n\nEarly experiments of social tokens involved people tokenizing their time. For example [Reuben Bramanathan](https://twitter.com/bramanathan?lang=en), who previously worked on legal and product at Coinbase, tokenized his time where 1 [$CSNL](https://www.bramanathan.com/) token equaled 1 hour of his time and was freely traded. We also saw people attempting to tokenize part of their future income. Platforms like [Roll](https://tryroll.com/) and [Coinvise](https://coinvise.co/) make it easier for people to issue their own token.\n\nOne prominent example of a social token is [$RAC](https://blog.ourzora.com/home/introducing-rac), a community token by the Grammy award winning recording artist [RAC](https://twitter.com/RAC), issued through Zora. Token holders get access to a private Discord group and receive early access to merch drops with more perks to be added in the future. The token was retroactively distributed to his supporters including Bandcamp and Patreon supporters, people who had bought merch, and will eventually be distributed to all Twitch supporters. This allows creators to directly interact with and reward their early supporters.\n\nOne of the tools that enabled a new wave of social tokens was [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/), which built a Telegram and Discord bot that connects to an Ethereum wallet to verify token balance before joining a chat group. This allowed for the creation of token permissioned groups, such as [$JAMM](https://www.jammpad.com/) and [$KARMA](https://andrwlee.medium.com/announcing-karma-dao-first-ever-token-permissioned-networking-chat-group-on-telegram-5feab7a54def) with their native tokens, which helped make sure that those joining the group had a certain level of skin in the game. Another feature of Collab.Land is a leaderboard that keeps track of who has contributed the most to the chat group. You could imagine token rewards distributed to those with the highest amounts of participation to reward engagement.\n\nAnother useful social token tool is [Unite Community](https://unite.community/) which allows for creators to easily distribute their tokens to followers through their social media channels and reward engagement.\n\n\n![Unite.community distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0026c774-c91d-443f-a295-161236ad0fba.jpeg)\n\nThe interesting part about social tokens is that it can represent anything from a person’s time to specialized access to collective ownership of a community. There is a lot of potential for social tokens and I expect many more creators to issue them in the future.\n\n\n### Future\n\nThese are just a few of the many use cases that are possible and have gotten some traction. There will likely be a significant increase in NFT adoption over the next several years. Traditional assets like equity getting tokenized seems like a clear progression in the future as it would make transferring them far more efficient. Then we’ll see tokenization that bridges the traditional world but adds new possibilities such as advertising space represented as an NFT where you could sell advertising rights to a site and have that be freely tradable. This would be a form of digital real estate. These NFTs would allow people to bet that a website will get a lot of traction and that the advertising space will become more valuable. Then we’ll start seeing more tokens with brand new concepts that are only made possible because of crypto which is what I’m most excited about.\n\n![Table from Will Warren’s presentation at [0xpo](https://www.0xpo.com/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8459ba6-156e-48a1-86ad-4182988bfdfc.jpeg)\n\n\nThere are a few aspects of the user experience that need to be improved in order for NFTs to become more accessible. We need to have improvements to scaling since transaction fees can make some transactions very expensive or infeasible. Scaling research is already in the works with many different teams in Ethereum working on scaling solutions and we also are seeing other blockchains being built that are catered specifically for this use case. Another point of friction with NFTs is that holders will need to self-custody them. However this complexity can be abstracted away with user friendly wallets that make it easy to onboard and support features such as a PIN, biometrics, and social account recovery. I’m optimistic that these will get built out over time and we will see a huge wave of creativity and experimentation in the NFT space.\n\n\n### Resources\n\nHere are some additional resources to understand NFTs further and keep up with developments.\n\n\n#### Understanding NFTs\n\n\n\n*   [Quick Overview of the NFT Ecosystem](https://andrewsteinwold.substack.com/p/-quick-overview-of-the-nft-ecosystem) by Andrew Steinwold\n*   [The Non-Fungible Token Bible](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) by Devin Finzer\n*   [Social Tokens Year in Review](https://2020inreview.forefront.news/) by Cooper Turley\n\n\n#### Keeping up with NFTs\n\n\n\n*   [DeFi Arts Intelligencer newsletter](https://artsdefi.substack.com/) by William Peaster\n*   [Zima Red newsletter](https://andrewsteinwold.substack.com/) by Andrew Steinwold\n*   [Forefront newsletter](https://forefront.market/) on social tokens\n\nIf you want to get in touch about interesting NFT ideas or projects, I’m [@ljxie](https://twitter.com/ljxie) on Twitter.\n\nThanks to [Will Warren](https://twitter.com/willwarren89) and [Jordan Clifford](https://twitter.com/jcliff42) for reviewing this post.\n\n_Disclaimer: Linda Xie is a Managing Director of Scalar Capital Management, LLC, an investment manager focused on cryptoassets which holds ETH and Ethereum tokens.

Artist unknown, 19th c.](https://otherinter.net/hanging-gardens.jpeg)\n\nPublic things, whether natural resources or human creations, populate the world in which we encounter one another. We govern, share, and maintain them as a society. While imperfect in how they are built or administered, these objects draw us together in dialogue, debate, and common concern (Honig, 2017). More than mere things, natural landscapes and built environments are cultural touchpoints. They involve us in care for the public good.\n\n![Roman aqueduct of Pont du Gard, now recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Painting by Hubert Robert 1787.](https://otherinter.net/aqueduct.jpeg)\n\nIn economics, a \"public good\" refers to anything that is both *non-excludable* and *non-rivalrous,* that is, people can't be barred access, and one person's use doesn't degrade another's. Clean air is an example of a naturally occurring public good, while the electric grid is a public good created by people. What are the public goods of today's industrial-knowledge society? Open source code, which supports millions of companies and independent developers, is often thought of this way. The cypherpunks considered privacy itself as a kind of public good. It seems only natural that online media archives and open digital infrastructure should qualify as well.\n\nMore recently, Vitalik Buterin and others in the cryptocurrency community have taken up the rhetoric of blockchain mechanisms as public goods. To be sure, crypto protocols are among the most compelling novel institutional forms. Their unique capabilities derive from their \"public\" qualities: unrestricted membership and participation, open APIs, transparent allocation of resources and power. But at the same time many of their characteristics contradict claims of public accessibility. Can crypto protocols be considered public goods if ownership is concentrated in the hands of a few whales? Colloquially, these market primitives are sometimes described as \"public infrastructure,\" but if blockchains serve a \"public\" today, it is primarily one of decentralized finance. Fundamentally, these tokenholders share only one common object of concern: price.\n\nSo while crypto protocols may qualify as public goods in the economic sense, where in these conversations is discussion of what's good for the public? Some of the crypto community's stated ambitions are to solve mass coordination problems, build post-national forms of sovereignty, and level the global playing field. But to create a majestic and egalitarian society requires a more expansive vision of public goods than what can be imagined with economics alone.\n\n![Ancient Ruins Used as Public Baths, Hubert Robert (1798)](https://otherinter.net/hubert-robert-baths.jpeg)\n\nThe public bath houses of the Romans, accessible to both rich and poor, were the cornerstone of both the city's public health and its rich cultural life. At its peak, the Library of Alexandria held hundreds of thousands of texts, among the largest stores of public knowledge in the ancient world. Although exclusionary in many respects, these wonders are precursors to the public goods we know today. They point towards an ideal of *openness* and *universality.* As builders of a new digital society, we must be equipped with an even more inclusive and visionary concept of what \"public\" and \"good\" can mean. As protocol treasuries transition to community stewardship of public works, it's time to imagine how crypto protocols might uniquely conceive of public goods.\n\n## The Scope of the Public\n\nOur new understanding of public goods starts by exploring notions of the public. What makes something public? What constitutes *the* public?\n\nThe vernacular term \"public\" is understood to be *something of the people, freely available for use*—such as parks, roads, and common lands. Crypto protocols' strongest claim to publicness is based on this principle of open and permissionless access. Blockchains overcome a key limitation of Web 1 and Web 2 publics: their failure to satisfy the criteria of inalienable access. The internet's so-called \"[public spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_space)\" are nothing like our cities' public parks. They are merely someone else's private server, where access can be revoked at will. By contrast, crypto protocols deliberately enforce unimpeded access.\n\nBut a public is more than a means of access to public space. Another key definition is *a* public as body of people, defined in relation to some political association. In 17th century England, a newly uncensored press circulated articles of public opinion, including notes from salon gatherings and critical journals. Often reproachful of the state, these published media brought \"private people together as a public\" for the first time (Habermas, 1989). Less than a century later, French revolutionaries orchestrated a new peoples' self-consciousness by organizing festivals, erecting monuments, and designating new communal spaces (Ozouf, 1975). In both instances, political bodies were raised to the status of institutions by establishing new venues for storytelling—venues in which people could begin to identify themselves as part of a collective whole, that is, a public.\n\n![ Festival of the Supreme Being, organized in 1794 to inaugurate the new state religion after the French Revolution.](https://otherinter.net/festival-supremebeing.jpeg)\n\nThis notion of the public as a self-conscious entity has also taken hold on the internet, where adoption is driven by *public*ation and circulation of media. To publish a web document or software application is more than making *something* public: it's an act of making *a* public (Warner, 2002). Cryptocurrency advocates often draw on this idea when they refer to token holders as a \"community,\" or compare protocols to nations with citizens. Sovereign moneys created by blockchains certainly offer a ready comparison to sovereign states, and their immutability means APIs can't be modified or revoked without broad consensus.\n\nThese ideas feed the notion of crypto protocols as public goods, yet together they present a complicated picture. Despite their \"open\" qualities, crypto protocols do not yet offer a satisfying answer to the *scope* of the public they address.\n\nIn today's crypto ecosystems, token-based membership determines key considerations such as resource allocation, on-chain incentives, and off-chain decision-making. While a blockchain's censorship resistance may seem like the solution to a world of gatekeepers, in reality, pay-to-play limits access in other ways. Protocols may be owned by thousands, even millions of stakeholders, but they are not in everyone's benefit—only those who have the time, expertise, or resources to participate.\n\nWhat then are the implications of defining a public as a set of users? Web 2 platforms offer us a crucial lesson. The social media platforms which dominate the web today claim to be tools made for \"communities\" of users who have opted to participate—but these platforms have also produced wide-reaching *negative externalities:* effects on third parties who did not agree to incur their costs. The externalities of platforms include incursions on personal privacy, the spread of misinformation, the devaluation of creative labor, even destabilization of the democratic process. These effects are often cited as a primary motivation for those now working in Web 3 to now establish sovereign spaces built on a foundation of public accountability.\n\nWhile social platforms offer one example of a misconstrued public, nascent Web 3 \"public spaces\" suffer similar problems of definition, scope, and representation. The equivalence of stake and voice in crypto is reminiscent of early American democracy, in which political representation was conditioned on property ownership. Under this regime, only 6% of the total US population was eligible to vote—a laughably exclusionary idea of the body politic by today's standards (Ratcliffe, 2013). Recall that the universal suffrage, human rights, and public services we enjoy today are the products of struggle by those who were excluded from the *designated* public to have their voice represented. In fact, the theory of \"counterpublics\" specifically addresses groups who are not admitted within the larger public sphere, groups whose members may not be deemed as persons (Warner, 2002).\n\n![Nationl Union of Womens Suffrage Societies](https://otherinter.net/nuwss.jpeg)\n\nSo it's clear that defining the scope of the public is key to understanding what public goods will mean. By equating membership in a public with ownership of a currency, we lose sight of important stakeholders and opportunities for coalition-building. The most consequential members of the crypto-public today are those who hold the most tokens, meaning even small holders are effectively removed from the conversation about what's in their benefit. Moreover, within this *designated* public exist people that may hold very different notions of the public good. By engaging with the underrepresented fringes that make up the wider crypto community, we can gain a deeper understanding of the public that we are building for and how to best serve them.\n\nWhen we think of the public, we should think expansively. This is not to say that we must consider *everyone* in the world as a part of our public. As we emphasized in our essay on [squads](http://otherinter.net/squad-wealth/), we also celebrate small, self-selective communities and trust-based groups. But by considering the effects (positive and negative) that we might have on groups at the margins—whether nocoiners, non-technical family members, or simply future participants in this public domain—we increase the potential for greater public upside and decrease the risk of negative externalities.\n\nPut simply: who belongs in this great post-national society the crypto community aims to build? Paraphrasing Michael Warner, a public always exceeds one's known protocol. It is a relation among strangers that's historically contingent and culturally complex. A public is constituted by the friends you have never met, with whom you share cultural coordinates without even knowing it. How does what we build render benefits for the most people possible?\n\nIn order to address this, let's turn to the \"good\" in public goods.\n\n## The Moral Basis of the Public \"Good\"\n\nHow do we determine what counts as a public good? So far we've started by questioning who exactly the public is. But even if we went along with the claim that publics = tokenholders, what exactly does this tell us about this public? Who are these tokenholders? What beliefs do they collectively hold?\n\nConsider a classic public good: a public park. We might say park visitors are generically \"users\" of this public space, or that anyone within driving distance is adequately served. But this categorization feels distinctly unsatisfying. \"User\" does not capture meaningful detail about a population that collectively values free access to protected forest or shoreline. *Why* are public parks more desirable than public parking lots? This brings us to an important realization: any definition of public goods presupposes a shared understanding of what is in the public's benefit, and why.\n\n![Tree Mountain - A Living Time Capsule-11,000 Trees, 11,000 People, 400 Years (1992-96) Ylojarvi, Finland](https://otherinter.net/tree-mountain.jpeg)\n\nA social body is united not only by the things it makes use of, but by a multitude of shared traits, including geography, ethnicity, religion, taste, culture, history, and values. This is why, no matter their claim to universality, instantiations of public goods are always *local*. Locality is created and felt through [shared space, time, or experience](https://otherinter.net/squad-wealth/#theory-of-the-squad). Without the assumptions and norms that develop out of this shared context, it would be impossible to identify and make space for things that are in the public benefit. So public goods, even as defined by economists, will always be a reflection of some group's shared context, common beliefs, and moral sensibilities; in other words, their value system.\n\nPublic libraries, public education, national artifacts, and clean running water are four public things that exemplify the moral basis of public goods. Public libraries are built by communities that value self-directed learning and spaces of shared knowledge. Public schools are valued when a culture believes a shared basis of mathematics, science, language, and history enriches civic life. Nations designate and protect historical artifacts because their people hold connection to their heritage to be something of intrinsic worth. Lastly, we provision clean water for all because of our belief that all lives are equally valuable. This humanist value is why stories like the [Flint water crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis)—a failure of basic infrastructure—are widely understood as humanitarian crises: certain lives are being treated as valueless, treated as if they do not belong.\n\n![](https://otherinter.net/flint-1.jpeg)\n\n![](https://otherinter.net/flint-2.jpeg)\n\nEach of these examples is based on a different idea of what makes life meaningful—on an idea of what *is* \"good\" (Taylor, 1977). Public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, but more importantly, *they are objects that satisfy values that are shared.*\n\nThe four public goods mentioned above are upheld by social bodies with a shared belief in their value to the public at large. But how many look at the \"public goods\" funded in the crypto space and see their values reflected? What are the shared values of UNI holders, or Ethereans?\n\nThe crypto community ostensibly holds an ethos of liberalism, where \"decentralization\" frequently stands for community self-sovereignty. With the wealth creation in the space, there is no reason crypto shouldn't be able to build goods for the diverse values of its different communities. There's even a popular meme that \"crypto allows communities to encode values into money.\" But in practice, little space has been made for different values to be discussed or enacted. Which is why, in the absence of ways to enact our shared values, we default to the lowest common denominator: profit.\n\nWithout a specific idea of the good to build towards, the financial interests of large tokenholders have become over-represented in protocol governance. In our view, this constitutes a centralization risk. When protocol politicians have no mandate or formal responsibility to represent anyone's interest but their own, the result is that a homogenous and self-interested group of whales can dictate what is deemed to be of benefit for the network. Crypto still has no concept of a \"public servant.\"\n\nSo what are the alternatives to oligopolistic protocol determination? Buterin, Hitzig, and Weyl's concept of \"liberal radicalism,\" the basis for Gitcoin's Quadratic Funding mechanism, proposes a model in which public goods are equivalent to market signals (Buterin et al., 2018). One might make the argument that values are \"priced in\" to this model. If people \"vote on their values with their dollars\", then the market acts as a vehicle for funding those values, whether or not values are made explicit. Indeed, quadratic voting appears able to boost the relative voice of a passionate minority.\n\nBut while voting is symbolically powerful, this model misses an important truth: we do not discover shared values through *individually* revealed preference. *If public goods are to satisfy shared values, then public discussion of what's of value matters!* Many protocols are already learning this lesson with regards to governance: discussion and consensus-building is a necessary precursor to voting. Likewise, discussion of values is as important, if not more so, than the act of voting itself. A value system is fostered through storytelling and negotiation in forums of public discourse.\n\nIf we don't want what's of value to be centrally determined by those with the most tokens in their wallets, we need to empower diverse communities and explicitly incorporate different conceptions of worth. To have an economy in alignment with our own values, we need a stronger coupling between our idea of the public interest and how decisions are made on this public's behalf. If we wish to build a culture that lasts, members must identify with one another along dimensions beyond that of a “tokenholder.\" Members of the crypto space are New Yorkers, Berliners, and Kinshasans, we are grandchildren of the elderly and parents of the very young. We are members of a multitude of publics, and we must bring the perspective of our full selves to the creation of public goods.\n\n## Public Goods, a New Definition: Positive Externalities\n\nSo far we've learned about the complicated ways a public can be defined, suggesting that expanding our notion of the public to include many parties may produce better public outcomes. We've also seen that goods are based on the shared values of some locality. With these concepts in hand, can we build a better definition of public goods?\n\nThe type of public goods we need are those that can be enacted by digital communities, while avoiding the destructive scaling effects of Web 2 platforms. As Facebook expanded its reach, it realized increasingly negative externalities in the form of propagandist attacks on democratic institutions. Public goods enacted by Web 3 communities should strive to produce exactly the opposite effect. **Greater scale should mean *greater* *good* as valued by an increasingly wider set of people: the creation of *positive externalities*.**\n\nThis is a powerful new way of defining public goods. In fact, crypto has already generated one potent example: widespread adoption of asymmetric cryptography. Computer scientists and cryptographers have known for years that mass adoption of public key encryption could enhance the right to privacy, a value held by many. But while researchers struggled to advocate for the adoption of this technology, cryptocurrencies have driven mass adoption in a matter of years. Encrypted messaging has gone from a tool used by dark markets and intelligence agencies to a highly demanded feature of consumer applications and services.\n\n![Kryptos, Jim Sanborn (1990) cryptographic sculpture installed at the grounds of the Central Intelligence Agency. To date 3 of the 4 enscribed cyphertexts have been decoded.](https://otherinter.net/kryptos.jpeg)\n\nOther examples of crypto's positive externalities are more nascent. Today, core contributors to open source projects are still under-funded, despite entire industries being built with their software. With infrastructure provided by the likes of Gitcoin and Radicle, protocol treasuries are poised to dramatically expand the funding of open source code, both inside and outside of crypto. We are already seeing signals of this shift, as more private and public funding is directed to support open source development, within crypto and beyond.\n\nSimilarly, normalizing open organizational APIs and civic participation are objects of public interest for any contemporary advocate of liberalism and democracy. Open, unalterable, and publicly governed APIs dramatically curb the power of centralized organizations and grant agency to users, who may now determine their own interfaces and services. If blockchains pressure centralized companies and governments to make their APIs open and irrevocable, this would mark a major paradigm shift toward accessible and accountable institutions. Finally, crypto protocols reintroduce participatory governance of public systems as a part of daily life. We can only hope that one of crypto's externalities will be to raise the expectation for transparent and easy-to-use participation in local governance.\n\nEach of these public goods, both actual and potential, are goods beyond the reductive economic sense. They satisfy values of privacy, the virtue of freely shared work, liberalism, accountability, and democratic participation, incorporating a shared sense of *the good* for parties well beyond the users of Web 3 today.\n\nThis points to a useful feature of our new definition. Understanding public goods as positive externalities enables us to consider people that are not typically classified as members of a public to be our beneficiaries. This definition stands in contrast to economic discourse, where non-contributing users of some public good are considered \"free riders,\" indicative of market failure. How could we consider these users \"free riders\" when it is clearly in the interest of society to promote the creation and consumption of public goods—be they vaccines, public libraries, or open source code? The idea of positive externalities makes others' benefit axiomatic. In fact, this quality is congruent with the principle of [credible neutrality](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/). Applied to public goods, credible neutrality suggests that there ought not be *any* privileged class of \"citizens,\" that all should stand to benefit equally.\n\nPositive externalities are thus an important variation on a familiar theme in the crypto space: positive sum games. By now, most crypto-natives recognize that relationships and value creation are largely of this type, games of building and shilling where contributions have cooperatively additive effects. As protocols and infrastructures grow and become more culturally entrenched, the extent of their positive externalities should *also* increase proportionally.\n\nAn interesting case study is Fair Launch Capital. While this project does not lay out a mission explicitly in the public interest, it hints at possible social models that deserve further exploration. In short, Fair Launch Capital is a small group of facilitators who fund promising projects. The founders of these projects must be willing to forgo a founder's token allocation, instead distributing their token \"fairly\" in exchange for a startup grant. If founders net some upside over the course of deploying this protocol, they are expected to \"pay it forward,\" subsidizing a subsequent team to launch their protocol and distribute tokens in the same fashion.\n\nThe Fair Launch model is interesting for a few reasons. First, the facilitating group does not capture financial value directly; it exists to perpetuate the organization. Second, Fair Launch Capital is not hard infrastructure but a social protocol, an institution whose maintenance relies on dedication and value alignment. And thirdly, the people who benefit are distinct from those performing the service. This leads us to a surprising feature of this new form of public goods: one way to manifest positive externalities is to consider the success of others as your own.\n\n![Zilker Park Kite Festival, held annually in Austin Texas.](https://otherinter.net/zilker-kite-festival.png)\n\n***\n\nEquipped with this idea of positive externalities, what public goods could we build and how? If public goods always serve a set of values local to some userbase, we might find our best inspiration by looking at the publics we already are part of. In addition to our on-chain identities, we, the authors of this essay, write from Berlin and New York. As citizens of these places, we benefit from parks and clean air, sanitation, and public transportation; we are upset about overpolicing, deforestation, and slow vaccine deployment. We have friends who receive public arts funding and write grants to ensure they can educate disenfranchised students.\n\nOur membership in these local spaces connects us with people who share our needs, aspirations, and concerns. We would *all* benefit from more green space, quality low-cost housing, and better access to healthy produce. Could public goods funders and builders in crypto intervene in these areas? Crypto has managed to build infrastructures that exist outside the nation state, but we still live our lives embedded in places, communities, and nations. Visions of truly global DAOs representing billions of people are a fantasy. But if we apply our principle of \"positive externalities\" to include future citizens of the places we live, protocol-built public goods starts to look more like community-driven industrial policy.\n\nThis might look like Fair Launch Capital for local small business startup grants. Or maybe it's Uniswap's tokenholders voting to fund regional subcommittees tasked with acquiring land to create conservation land trusts. One of Web 3's most disruptive potentialities is the power to take an entity with a strong revenue mechanism and leverage it to address something bigger than itself. DAOs can follow the tradition of great social movements past, working outside state governments to establish public goods. The success of the Black Panther Party's nation-wide program to deliver free breakfasts to public school students, black and white, pressured state governments across the US to create their own versions. This serves as an example how a non-state group with local community concerns can serve an expanded public and drive positive externalities.\n\n![Black Panther Party Free Breakfast Program](https://otherinter.net/free-breakfast.png)\n\nThis is a model that works locally, but scales to a global public. Like the expansion of suffrage, it sets a powerful precedent for adjacent communities and cultures. By addressing concerns rooted in our felt localities and establishing social models for others, we can catalyze truly global public goods.\n\n## From Ecosystem-Building to World-Building\n\nThe Ethereum project envisioned a \"world computer,\" a coordination system for global prosperity. Along with thousands of others, we joined the crypto space in 2016 and 2017 with the ambition of remaking society for the better. Now most of us are stuck checking our portfolio balances. Have we lost sight of that core belief?\n\nEvery one of us is a beneficiary of the public goods of societies past. These grand projects humble us. Cathedrals, great canals, sanitation, the expansion of mass literacy—they tell us that the \"goodness\" of a public good is also measured in terms of its longevity. To match these great works, we must extend our time horizon. We want to ensure positive outcomes not just for token holders or protocol participants, but for the world co-extensive with these infrastructures. How can we leverage the immutability afforded by crypto protocols to create things that outlast us, forming the foundation of civilizational longevity?\n\nTo answer this, we need only think of public goods that satisfy this definition today. Permanent land preserves, the Global Seed Vault, the internet itself as the foundational communications technology of a global age. These are not only public goods, they are the cultural practices that maintain such goods over generations. *Public goods are enacted by social institutions that reproduce patterns of behavior in the public interest.*\n\nCrypto protocols provide the building blocks of social institutions equipped to take on the challenges of today's networked culture. Many are already looking for ambitious and impactful ways to spend their billion-dollar treasuries. And there is more than just financial value flowing through these cryptoeconomic systems: peoples' time, attention, and energy are resources that can be directed. Yet so much of what is built in crypto today is self-referential and self-serving money games. \"ETH = money,\" \"treasury diversification,\" even the \"ngmi\" meme—these are concepts fundamentally indexed to profit. But what is money for? The United States Dollar does not have a responsibility to profit its holders. A cryptocurrency is a monetary instrument, not a business.\n\nAs tokenholders, we have the right and the responsibility to ask what these assets should be used for—and the stakes are high. The shape of society in the 20th century was determined by corporations explicitly driven by a profit-only value system. Do we want the next-generation of protocol-based institutions to result in same outcomes? The type of social institution needed is not an on-chain corporation, but a container for a different idea of what capital and coordination is intended to do altogether. We see a seed of this in today's protocol granting bodies, distributing responsibility for treasury funds to smaller groups with targeted public goals. Imagine the power of entire protocols operating according to this principle. The scope of our ambition goes well beyond conscientious token voting. We want nothing less than entire communities aping into a redefinition of public concern. The opportunity in front of us is bigger than any one protocol. In today's world, capital is not scarce; ambitious visions for the public's benefit are.\n\n![Buckminster Fuller, 1/2,000.000 scale \"Playground Map\" developed by the World Game Institute.

{"id": "kCWRICwQVNBi9_Z-XieaDpk38wNN6Wy-cij-1hoaK8I", "title": "On Online Social Consensus", "body": "**A treatise on crypto social and the motivations for the Yup Protocol**\n( recently published 12/24/19 )\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_2c5ae1d462b141299a590804a01b6bbe~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nWith help from the whole Yup team, and revisions from [*Sam Hatem*](https://hackernoon.com/@sam-hatem)\n\n### The Quest for Social Consensus\n\nSince the dawn of the internet, there has been an ambitious desire for open and public protocols for social networks. However, distributed social consensus on the web has remained highly regarded but rarely understood. It has not been valued based on determinant incentives and, as a consequence, remains widely misrepresented and opaque. Online engagement metrics such as reach and follower counts attempt to attach numbers to this force, but measure with regard to quantity rather than quality, making them easily manipulable and highly untrustworthy. These metrics fail to accurately capture social capital, leaving social networks highly vulnerable to weak governance, sybil identities, and the spread of disinformation, harming digital communities and trust. Under this system, users have little economic incentive to express their opinion on content and one another genuinely, and their opinions are weighted evenly regardless of their own social capital. As our online presence consumes most of our daily lives, our society will be defined by our ability to solve these new social problems on the internet. In our eyes, the quest for online social consensus is a continuous quest for a better humanity in the digital age.\n\nRecently, due to technological improvements to distributed systems and cryptography, the world’s social media leaders have begun to imagine similar designs enabled by blockchain tech. Industry titans such as Jack Dorsey (Twitter) and Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) have started research and development towards these exact ends. On the crypto-economic side of these developments, new innovators have emerged who are attempting to tackle problems around collective decision-making and DAO-based identity systems. Thought leaders in this field have realized that a better method of allocating the value accrued on online platforms is needed and could be achieved by incentivizing participants at every scale for their online actions, directly monetizing the content they create, rate, or proliferate.\n\nIn tandem to issues surrounding online social capital, the current centralization of most networks entitles operators to rent-seek and sway user behavior, all while hoarding user data that could provide an enhanced experience and new streams of income for individuals.\n\nIn an attempt to solve these pitfalls of the web, a group of students at Columbia University built [*Yup*](http://yup.io/?utm=blog), a protocol that facilitates the distribution, measurement, and governance of online social capital in a pseudonymous yet transparent opinion-based economy. That’s a technical way of saying that ***Yup is respect*** –a movement to represent, reward, and empower respect across the internet, with content primed to earn users’ approval, not attention.\n\nYup offers a fair weighting of opinions, a single universal reputation/identity that can be used on all sites without competing with existing business models, a native and scarce asset to facilitate monetization or attention markets, and an immutable record of reviews and reputations. Let us explore the shortcomings in existing centralized and decentralized systems, point to promising solutions, and propose a new protocol governed by social capital.\n\n## Identity\n\n### Identity in the Digital Realm\n\nWhat does it mean to be a valuable user online? Is this reserved for individual humans? Must they be legally recognized? In [**Authenticity in the Age of Digital Companions**](http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/pdfsforstwebpage/ST_Authenticity%20in%20age%20of%20digi%20comp.pdf), famed sociologist Sherry Turkle argues that “by the mid-90s, humans were not alone as emotional machines.” She also points to experiments where kids quickly treated robots as companions deserving of compassion despite being scientifically demystified. This type of interactions between bots and people will only increase over time, she suggests.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_567ed6bd2a4440ff963316b9940b550b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nOne of our favorite Instagram users, [*@lilmiquela*](https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/), isn’t real in the *human* sense. But that hasn’t stopped her from becoming a superstar. Miquela is a self-described robot led by the Sequoia-backed media company [***Brud***](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V5N5tcfm7wBuUshgrmIOz9ijAO-VRqvkUbGRu0uKdI8/edit)**.** She’s cleverly placed alongside “real” people to appear life-like. This [*Gorillaz*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnrEEoVOUlE)-esque approach to identity is starting to catch on, as more and more Miquela wannabes sprout up.\n\n[***Block.One***](https://block.one/)**,** the blockchain development company behind EOS and Steem, have a new decentralized social media project called [***Voice***](https://voice.com/) that they announced last summer. The Voice project seems to take a different angle at this identity issue, opting to essentially require every sign up to legally identify themselves with documents such as a driver’s license or passport. Dan Larimer and others at B1 cite responsibility as their reason, wishing to hold users accountable for their interactions. It remains to be seen as how Voice plans on decentralizing this process over time, to make sure that their network doesn’t remain inherently permissioned. Identity DAOs like [***Humanity DAO***](https://www.humanitydao.org/) and [***Democracy Earth***](https://democracy.earth/) have tried to crowd-source identity, building economic incentives around the recognition of humans via incentive mechanisms that resemble universal basic income. *But both of these approaches lack the proper room for the lil’ Miquelas of the world.* The social networks of the future will still need to account for individuals, groups, teams, companies, communities, or even algorithms being represented by a single identity. A protocol shouldn’t by design limit users to one account tied to their real identity –furthermore, accounts shouldn’t be limited to one person or even a human.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_210b96020670486098e4899e9ef2ce63~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nIn a different piece from 2008, Sherry Turkle [*argues*](http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/pdfsforstwebpage/Turkle_how_computers_change_way_we_think.pdf) that “Online worlds can provide valuable spaces for identity play.” This is clearly seen by the emergence of ‘finstas’ (fake IG accounts) and group IG accounts, which represent a fundamental shift in the ‘roles’ online users take during interactions. In this sense, it becomes very difficult to properly attribute authenticity or inauthenticity to any one user. So as the lines between human vs. robot, person vs. group, as well as person vs. themselves begin to fade, what does ‘authenticity’ really mean?\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_4ac0f95ba10a412abf0b7b11dc813ca9~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nIt’s all about social value. A username or identity is only as ‘real’ as we allow it to be. If it matters to us as a society, it is in fact authentic, whether or not it owns a heart, four hearts, an XY chromosome, or CPU. For example, Satoshi Nakamoto is the still-secret pseudonym used for the creator(s) of Bitcoin. Yet today, it doesn’t really matter who Satoshi Nakamoto is/was, but what they represent and what kind of social capital their identity holds. The only information known about Satoshi is their digital footprint and social approval, and so that becomes their identity, the role they play, and the context in which one would interact with him/her/them. If Satoshi was found to be a robot, it would not change the power and reputation of their identity. Nothing but a private key signature would be necessary for them to take advantage of all of that built up social capital. So, if social value is crucial in determining identity online, humans need signal vehicles to properly perform in this new environment.\n\n### Data Autonomy\n\nFor the majority of web2 online platforms, user data has been a relatively zero-sum game. Every platform is incentivized to hoard data, hurting the user’s experience. For example, when you log in to Tinder via Facebook OAuth, Facebook Inc. is choosing what to share with Tinder and what not to share. While FB may permit you to allow Tinder to know some information, it hides the majority of your data and metadata because it’s extremely valuable and diminishes in value as access increases. This is despite the fact that this data could enable Tinder to provide you with a better experience. You as a user have no real say in this matter and, as a result, are the biggest loser from this zero-sum game. Since its inception, the world wide web has lacked solutions to this equilibrium, but distributed ledger technology has given rise to new projects and products aiming to disrupt this existing data competition and give users real ownership over their data. Sir Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the world wide web, has been working on a new project titled [***Solid***](https://solid.inrupt.com/) that’s focused around solving this problem. By way of the Solid “POD”, a storage locker controlled by private keys with different permissions, users can decide where to store their data. Since users have immutable ownership over their data, they’re free to move it at any time, choosing who has access to it without interruption of service. In order to write data as well as to read it, and to protect privacy, it is important to control who has access to what. In Solid’s case this is managed using the web access control list specification and the WebID Identity spec.\n\nOther teams are building similar products. [***OrbitDB***](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db), for example, tries to achieve similar peer-to-peer database capabilities, functioning as a serverless and peer-to-peer storage locker built on IPFS data storage and Pubsub. [***3Box***](https://3box.io/) is building a comparable framework for Ethereum applications. Smart contract platform [***Blockstack***](https://blockstack.org/) has prioritized these features, adding OAuth log-in and data locker capabilities to its base layer protocol. By way of a universal identity layer, Yup is providing similar functionality users, focusing on qualitative metadata as user’s most lucrative asset.\n\n## Attention\n\nOnline attention is a key ingredient in harvesting influence. Several entities have capitalized on this notion, quickly trading it as a commodity of product sales and branding. Additionally, it gave power and voice to advocacy. Most social media platforms remain economically efficient through the resale of what attention it could capture in exchange for its \\`free' content.\n\nContent creators in top social media platforms have little direct way to monetize their fans’ attention or get a share of ad revenue. In response, they have resorted to grossly ineffective workarounds. This resulted in an economy that disproportionately rewards a handful of centralized social media companies instead of the content creators that give such platforms value. Members of thriving online communities that exist on popular social media platforms currently have no control in the developments of the sites they helped grow; the length and extent of their engagement is undermined. Additionally, there is no direct relationship between the demand of users and sponsored content/monetization. This stunts influencers’ ability to build user loyalty around an account or channel. There are no real incentives to support quality content and discourage poor behavior.\n\nUpon examining the makeup of existing centralized social networks, we conclude that social capital is misrepresented and easily purchased, and the monetization of attention is one sided or separate from the network itself. Yup prioritizes respect instead of attention whereby the user is the customer, not the product. Our focus isn’t on growing engagement but rather curating content that people actually enjoy.\n\n### The Monetization of Attention\n\nThere are a handful of distributed ledgers, platforms, and applications being built to decentralize social networks and advertising. **Steem**, a decentralized social network blockchain, mints new tokens and rewards content creators for their virality. In order to mitigate sybil attacks, the Steem network must have certain barriers on account creation that hurts onboarding and thus the community at large. This is quite inefficient and counts on user error to bouey the price of STEEM, giving a strong advantage to profit-driven automated users.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_520507ed2fa74273ab1d424146ac290c~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nSimilarly, Voting bots plague the Steem network to such an extent that the community accepts them as a part of their ecosystem. Users can pay bots to curate their content or to vote on their behalf for rewards. Users can earn more tokens by proxy-staking to bots than by actually participating in the network. As a result, users are now incentivized to be less engaged and simply proxy-stake their holdings to maximize returns. This new form of advertising accepted by many protocol communities has additional issues including the lack of strong incentives to support channels and accounts, the direct relationship between token holdings and influence on the network which ignores user activity or length of involvement, unannounced shutdowns of the blockchain for updates, and rampant misinformation.\n\nNew models with similar designs have risen in the last few years. Originally built on the Steem blockchain, ***DLive***, an up-and-coming project that has partnered with celebrities like [*PewDiePie*](https://www.newsweek.com/dlive-pewdiepie-stream-schedule-app-youtube-1390512), began to gain traction in spring of 2019. It transitioned from Steem to **Lino**, a blockchain that similarly rewards content creators and curators through an inflation-based rewards system but includes donation (see Tipping section below). One of the key incentives for DLive’s chain transition must be because of Lino promising 70% of token rewards to apps and developers directly. Creators and curators of content, on the other hand, are expected to make most of their money from donations. Unfortunately, this may hurt Lino in the long run as ecosystems and communities become too siloed to reflect that type of rewards system. This already seems to be the case with Tron supposedly [*acquiring DLive*](https://cryptobriefing.com/tron-acquires-dlive-blockchain-streaming-platform/) in late December ‘19 and looking to transition the app away from Lino and to its own blockchain. Furthermore, the Lino blockchain [*defines reputation solely by money spent*](https://link.lino.network/whitepaper), leading to plutocracies and inaccurate reputation schemes.\n\n### Advertising\n\n**Marketplaces**\n\nAdvertisement is currently the primary form of online content monetization, often considered the ‘[*original sin*](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/)’ of the internet. While most of us hate ads, our favorite sites and platforms wouldn’t exist without them. However, it’d be nice we as users received a piece of this ad revenue both for contributing content for engaging with ads. Brave, the company that maintains the Basic Attention Token (BAT), has tried to compete with Google Ads on this front, building their own protocol and browser that pays users for viewing ads and allows them to tip sites they visit, the age old way of economizing content. However, they similarly fail to attribute value to social capital, measuring ad views equally for every individual despite their potential greater importance for ads – a billionaire and I stand to make the same money on Brave despite them being in much higher demand in terms of advertising. Tipping usually refers to the feature allowing consumers to send money to a creator. There are great mainstream and crypto examples of tipping, including YouTube, [***Patreon***](http://patreon.com/)**, **[***Cent***](http://cent.co/)**, **[***Peepeth***](https://peepeth.com/), and [***Tippin.Me**.*](http://tippin.me/)\n\n**Censorship**\n\nEvery social platform must deal with the well-documented tension between censorship and free speech. If censorship is too limited, inappropriate and sensationalist content surfaces super quick. If censorship is too liberally used, speech suppression is inevitable. This would lead to family-friendly communities on one side of the spectrum and censorship-resistant ‘explicit’ ones on the other side. A good example of this is [***Gab***](https://gab.com/), a social network that prioritizes low censorship. Today, Gab has a reputation of being a hotbed for white supremacists and other questionable actors. Finding a goldilocks middle ground between the two is incredibly difficult and requires distributed consensus. The community at large will always know what’s better for the network than the headquarters of a centralized entity, but they will be much slower and more inefficient in executing that vision.\n\nOne of the big advantages of decentralized social networks is that they’re often more censorship-resistant. One project that aims to leverage this advantage is [***AKASHA***](https://akasha.world/)**,** which stands for 'Advanced Knowledge Architecture for Social Human Advocacy'. AKASHA (2015) is an Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized social media platform that is embedded into the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS). The Akasha decentralized social media platform is built to ensure the platform is resistant against censorship and be unable to be taken offline because it does not have any one central point of failure or lack of bandwidth issues.\n\n## Opinions & Social Capital\n\nThe opinions of others are vital to the Internet economy; it is the core component upon which value metrics are built. This is most clear in online product/service reviews. A highly-cited [*Harvard Business School study *](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=41233)from 2011 estimated that a one-star rating increase on Yelp translated to an increase of 5% to 9% in revenues for a restaurant. [*Cornell researchers*](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-announces-settlement-machinima-and-three-other-companies-false) found that a one-star change in a hotel’s online ratings on sites like Travelocity and TripAdvisor is tied to an 11% sway in room rates, on average.\n\nThe internet’s peer-to-peer nature is a huge reason for this, as opinions have become more accessible. Average user rating has become a huge driver of sales, and now, user-generated ratings and narrative reviews can be found on almost every website that sells something.\n\nThe results of a 2017 study by Podium show that 93% of American consumers say that online reviews have an impact on their purchasing decisions. 91% of 18-34 year old consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Star rating currently is the number one factor used by users to judge businesses.\n\nHowever, treating these social metrics as highly accurate does not necessarily make them so. University of Colorado Boulder professors Langhe, Fernbach, and Lichtenstein investigated the actual and perceived validity of online user ratings and found a \"substantial disconnect between the objective quality information that online user ratings actually convey and the extent to which consumers trust them as indicators of objective quality.\" They analyzed 344,157 Amazon ratings of 1,272 products in 120 product categories and compared them to ratings on Consumer Reports as well as resale value. They conclude that average user ratings correlate poorly with* Consumer Report *scores, and, while *Consumer Reports *correctly predict resale value, user ratings do not. This is because:\n\n\\- When reviewers are vetted and paid to review products (as is the case in Consumer Reports), their opinions are usually a stronger indication of quality.\n\n\\- Without a mechanism to ensure this, reviews lose their meaning.\n\nAdditionally, Langhe et al. argue that \"consumers fail to consider these issues appropriately when forming quality inferences from user ratings and other observable cues. They place enormous weight on the average user rating as an indicator of objective quality compared to other cues. They also fail to moderate their reliance on the average user rating when sample size is insufficient.\" In other words, the average user lacks both the data and know-how to make accurate inferences on the quality of products based on user ratings.\n\nDespite both the high value attributed to user opinion and the importance of monetizing it for accurate representation of quality, our own research suggests that less than 0.001% of online opinion is monetized today. Without any incentive to review honestly, users tend to express negative reviews more often and more extremely, with little to no reason to contribute positive reviews. This lack of monetization also tips the balance for malicious actors looking to manipulate their perceived quality: the incentives to create a false opinion for money from a malicious actor outweigh those to review honestly. Fakespot, a ratings analytics tool, [estimates](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buyer-beware-a-scourge-of-fake-online-reviews-is-hitting-amazon-walmart-and-other-major-retailers/) that 52 percent of Walmart reviews and 30 percent of Amazon reviews are fake or unreliable.\n\n### Misaligned Incentives\n\nThere remains a fundamental misalignment between the incentives of the platform and its users in terms of user inputted opinions. The platforms gain from the influx of data, and do everything they can to ensure that this input of data is smooth, regardless of accuracy. Users have no incentive to review accurately and therefore act based on external interests. Crucially, this whole system is flawed because it functions independently of real monetization for all parties involved.\n\n**So why would people give honest opinions without any incentive? **This is why we witness 21% more negative reviews than positive ones; with no other incentives involved, anger/frustration seems to be the driving incentive for negative reviews. Yup is designed to solve this problem by financially incentivizing accurate opinions with monetary rewards. Limiting the number of actions a user can do is also important in order to establish scarcity.\n\n> *“More people are depending on reviews for what to buy and where to go, so the incentives for faking are getting bigger… **It’s a very cheap way of marketing.\"***- Bing Liu, Professor at University of Illinois\n\nIn the internet age, reviews have very much become a form of marketing and has evolved into an enormous business: [reputation management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_management). Companies need reputations, and reputations come from people, unless you can buy them for cheaper than an ad campaign.\n\n**The Consequences of Access**\n\nWe expect that changes in* access *that occurred as a result of the rise of the internet had a significant effect on the trust in and accuracy of opinions. Access in this case refers to both the ability for anyone to rate products/ services/ content and the ease at which one can see more ratings online.\n\nWhen online review forums first emerged, they provided increasingly accurate opinions because of the “[wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)” effect taking hold. In James Surowiecki’s *The Wisdom of Crowds*, the famed journalist talks about bad intuitions around individual vs. group decision-making. These initial communities were small, and natural reputation effects among members existed because many knew each other by name. As misconceptions about the internet dissipated, trust in these reviews grew because they were in fact more accurate. But as access continued to increase and platforms changed, the natural reputation effects shrunk. This decreased the reputation at stake for each user and allowed for fake reviews to thrive, reducing accuracy significantly. Now, there is still a correlation between accuracy and trust; more accuracy leads to more trust, BUT more trust doesn’t necessarily lead to more accuracy. In fact, the more trust users have in online reviews the more worthwhile they are to fake/manipulate, creating a harmful equilibrium: **more accuracy → more trust → less accuracy → less trust → more accuracy … **I talk about this further in my piece [*“Opinion Economy”*](https://www.blog.yup.io/post/the-opinion-economy).\n\nWhile public metrics of social approval are not the only way to attribute this form of social capital to an identity, it is a very important one, so the removal of those metrics is to the detriment of the establishment of internet identities. The obscuring of relative signaling by removing public likes, like Instagram plans on doing, can be massively harmful to the structure of the society because it takes this information (and therefore power) away from the viewers.\n\n**Experts**\n\n*The notion that all opinions are created equal online is a large reason for the inaccuracy of opinions.*\n\nPeople like to trust brands and institutions as experts on a certain subject. In reality, however, they rarely are the experts we expect them to be. This is first because finding experts is a skill of its own, which can be flawed and time-consuming. As there are more sources, statistics, data points, and faux expertise, it becomes increasingly difficult to spot experts. Surowiecki expands on this point: “The problem is that even if these superior beings, do exist, there is no easy way to identify them.” This is also true for the experts themselves, who also may not be aware that they are experts. In fact, those within a crowd that project themselves as experts rarely are.\n\nClaiming individual humans know less than they’ve ever known, Yuval Noah Harari breaks down the impact of power and technology on our individual knowledge in his book [**21 Lessons for the 21st Century**](https://philosophiatopics.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/yuval-noah-harari-21-lessons-for-the-21st-century.pdf). He explains that humans are even less aware of their cognitive blindspots today than ever before. Because Google gives us an answer to any question, we think we’re experts and have a difficult time identifying our skills and shortcomings.\n\n[***Roll***](http://tryroll.com/) seeks to tokenize influencers, aligning curators with the specific growth of creators and influencers rather than that of the network. The financial success of curators in this case is determined by the speculative trading of influencer assets. This has serious problems in enforcement but projects some key insights about influence online. This is a way to determine experts, but not in their original form, but wholly in influence, expertise, and attention.\n\nYup attempts to prioritize reputation-based social consensus over brands and institutions. When conceiving of Yup, we used advances in distributed systems to explore new ways to (1) improve the user’s ability to identify inaccuracies, (2) deter the manipulation/misuse of reviews, and (3) correctly weight reviewers’ expertise on certain topics, communities could reach a perfect correlation between changes in trust and accuracy. Yup utilizes layered social level consensus to build sustainable governance of its network and provide proper representation of network value. This orders participants by their recognized social level. Every address on the network will have a social level as a measurement of others’ opinions of them. Their individual social levels will be determined by all other addresses on the network.\n\n**Testimonials**\n\n**Testimonials **have long been an example of quality signal vehicles for identifying the quality or reputation of a product or service. People tend Recently, as expected, individuals have found ways to manipulate and mislead testimonials as well. The most humorous example of false testimonials that we’ve come across is the one highlighted by YouTuber Coffeezilla in his [*Fake Guru video on Sam Ovens*](https://youtu.be/ez8yKklc1lE?t=150) (‘fake gurus’ are defined as online personalities that falsely sell themselves as business gurus). In this hilarious video, Coffeezilla discovers that Sam Ovens’ top testimonial, Dave Rogenmoser, actually had been making seemingly fake testimonials for dozens of ‘fake gurus’ during a 2 year span and may have been a fake guru himself. This epitomizes both the weight viewers give to online testimonials and their potential for misuse and manipulation.\n\n**Attempts at Reputation**\n\nSites whose main function is reviews have taken stronger actions to represent reputation in opinions. **Yelp** attempts to show a user’s reputation by reflecting the votes others have given on their reviews (as well as some other stats). The advantage of this portrayal of reputation is that it allows users to vet reviewers as ‘legitimate,’ mostly negative or positive in their reviews, or as having tendencies to act a certain way. The main problem with these metrics is that they don’t provide information or expertise; if a user is funny, how does that make them a better reviewer of bars? Sure, if you dig deep enough, you can start to infer certain things like that a reviewer’s past opinions on car mechanics may be strongly supported by the community or that their reviews on hardware stores are thought to be useless. But the search costs for doing this for every reviewer are far too high right now.\n\nLastly, this representation of reputation doesn’t affect the weighting of stars for a business. You could have a good rep on Yelp and still have the same influence over average ratings as any other user.\n\nBy making everyone equal, no one can be discovered as an expert. **What we must realize is that opinions aren’t democracies;** we shouldn’t all get an equal say as to the subjective quality of products, venues, or anything else for that matter. What we need is more of a meritocracy, because some of us have earned the right to speak on certain topics with authority, not necessarily through a college degree or an award but could simply be receiving the continued approval of the online community. This one-person-one-vote model just doesn’t make sense for diverse decision-making, because it doesn’t distribute accurate weight to the expertise of various participants.\n\n**Scarcity and Stake**\n\nStrong opinion models should provide major incentives for accurate reviews. If users were rewarded (monetarily or otherwise) for reviewing things, they’d take the time to make better decisions. One way of doing this is by P2P validation, meaning that if other users agree with a user’s opinion, either by upvoting their opinion or by submitting a similar review, that user should get rewarded. Yup identifies content and distributes rewards according to the value (influence) of the opinions associated with that content. In this case, we define *content* as any specific data online that user(s) deem worth judging, including but not limited to texts, images, videos, locations, accounts, and links. The influence metric is a function of engagement, ownership over time, and reputation. In Yup’s case, the final important piece here is scarcity: users should have a limited amount of reviews that they can give within a set amount of time. If users stand to gain or lose from their reviews, and they can only give their opinion x times a day, they’re less likely to abuse or waste these reviews.\n\nOn the opposite side of incentive is deterrence; users should be deterred from submitting inaccurate reviews. This could be enacted in a similar fashion, whereby users lose something for giving bad reviews that no one agrees with or supports. With Yup, this comes in the opportunity cost of giving an opinion elsewhere, where users may miss the opportunity to see returns if they vote inaccurately.\n\nSimilar concepts has been attempted in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space with the *Token Curated Registries*: lists of similar products/content/etc. that are curated by staking cryptocoins. This can be perceived as ‘betting’ that a product will be liked by others and they’ll also vote for it. If others also bet on it, you receive a token reward, if no one does, you lose your stake. In many of those systems, earning tokens and purchasing tokens holds the same value, despite there being no evidence that this is the right way to represent network participation.\n\n## Governance\n\nIn *Culture and Power: The Sociology of Pierre Bourdieu*, David Swartz begins with “Culture provides the very grounds for human communication and interaction; it is also a source of domination.” The same could be stated about the online behemoths that presently host our culture. While traditional social networks have expanded the size and function of communication, marketing, and organization, their monopolistic increase in internet market power has drawn a wide divide in incentives between their services and their user base. While there are forces that compel large networks to comply to certain restrictions, the implications of the extent of their hold over human behavior is concerning. For example, in 2010, Facebook ran [*a stealth experiment*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22972300) on 61,000,000 American accounts during the US congressional elections to see how small messages (banners above the news feed) could affect user’s voter turnout and more. They argue: “The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking, and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users’ friends, and friends of friends.”\n\nTheir results suggest that “Facebook social message increased turnout directly by about 60,000 voters and indirectly through social contagion by another 280,000 voters.” That 340,000 total represents about 0.14% of the country’s voting age population in 2010. For context, George Bush beat Al Gore in Florida by 537 votes in 2000. If a similar tight race occurred today, it wouldn’t be hyperbole to assume that Facebook could alter the political landscape of the United States with their [*4x user growth*](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/) and multi-billion dollar acquisitions since 2010.\n\nFacebook ran the voting experiment in 2010 but only made the results public in 2012 under their free will. If they had maliciously kept this study internal, the U.S. public and government may not have ever been aware. Second, because of Facebook’s immense network effects, the Cambridge Analytica data breach had little to no impact on its market dominance. Despite exposing over 80 million users’ information to third parties, resulting in trust in Facebook falling by over 50% in the following weeks, daily active users, minutes of usage, and advertising revenue all increased. This suggests that not only can giant social networks hide their manipulation, but also that average users are too network-dependent for their sentiment to be notably reflected in Facebook’s economics. Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes makes this same argument, arguing for the breaking up of Facebook into smaller companies in his famous *New York Times* piece “[*It’s Time to Break Up Facebook*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html)”. He writes that “Mark’s influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government.” At the helm of FB, Instagram, and WhatsApp, he argues that Zuckerberg has too much control. Despite being a publicly traded company, “Facebook’s board works more like an advisory committee than an overseer, because Mark controls around 60 percent of voting shares,” he writes. “Mark alone can decide how to configure Facebook’s algorithms to determine what people see in their News Feeds, what privacy settings they can use and even which messages get delivered. He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent and incendiary speech from the merely offensive, and he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it.”\n\n**Decentralization**\n\nThe benefits of decentralization have been highlighted thus far in this piece. However, decentralized protocols present their own issues such as bribing, collusion, and tragedy of the commons. Just like in their centralized counterparts, if a positive rating is worth more to a marketer than the money lost in achieving that rating on one of these platforms, they’ll surely try to manipulate it. This is entirely possible considering that users will probably not stake too much on one individual rating, especially if there aren’t that many participants. Except now, policing this must be governed democratically, making it more difficult at times. We all have heard of the [*PTSD that some Facebook moderators*](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa) have received from doing this kind of work…\n\n### First Layer Governance\n\nAt the consensus layer, there are several inefficiencies that can be improved upon with social capital. Nakamoto consensus uses proof-of-work to cleanly solve several issues in majority decision making, abandoning the notion of “one-IP-one-vote” for “one-CPU-one-vote”. However, one problem that arises as a result is the power ascribed to outsourced physical capital. Participants can gain more influence over the network by purchasing computational power with money from other economic systems. This means that the relationship between capital spent to maintain the network and the capital earned for doing so is not quite internal: 1 kW of electricity purchased with USD has equal power over the Bitcoin network as 1 kW purchased with BTC. PoS and DPoS mechanisms improve on this problem by requiring miners to stake network tokens to participate in consensus (‘one-token-one-vote’). Yet, it still does not properly reflect network participation: staking 1 network token that was purchased on an exchange provides the same mining power as 1 network token earned via mining. This dependence on physical capital makes networks susceptible to byzantine behavior from capital-rich outside parties as well as hinders the most-mover-advantages of participating in consensus. The ability to transparently quantify and represent social capital can provide stronger models for decentralized systems. Governed by an influence metric, the Yup protocol aggregates reputations, distributes opinion-based rewards, and facilitates fair ad exchange, resulting in clear, transparent consensus around social capital. It uses social level consensus to bring about anonymous P2P review and a money-resistant reputation scheme. This can be extremely helpful in solving some of the issues around protocol governance, particularly PoS and DAOs.\n\n## The Overweb, A Platform Agnostic Future\n\nBecause of the data silos laid out in the previous sections above, it may be likely that the open social protocol of the future will be platform agnostic and have overweb capabilities. Overweb is a term coined to describe software that is used to enhance one’s experience across the web rather than on one specific site or platform. The notion of platform-agnostic protocols is very well described by Mike Masnick in his piece \"[*Protocols, not Platforms*](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech)\".\n\n[***Klout***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klout) may be a great social example of overweb. Klout was a website and mobile app launched in 2008 that used social media analytics to rate its users according to online social influence via the \"Klout Score\". In determining the user score, Klout measured the size of a user's social media network and correlated the content created to measure how other users interact with that content.\n\nKlout used Bing, Facebook, Foursquare, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, and Wikipedia data to create Klout user profiles that were assigned a unique \"Klout Score\". Ultimately, Lithium Technologies, who acquired the site in 2014, closed the service in 2018. The largest reason for Klout’s failure, we propose, it’s lack of access to proprietary data of individual users on these other platforms. When Yup is attempting to aggregate influence across the web in this similar way, it is crucial that it exist atop a decentralized protocol such as the Yup protocol. Otherwise, it would quickly become difficult to integrate with any other site.\n\n### Status at Stake\n\nIn a platform where opinions are perfectly weighted and distributed, reviews would be more accurate. Investment in malicious marketing would be deterred. The distortion of customer reviews would be difficult. Cash would flow towards improving product quality + retaining users, rather than used to bolster the fraudulent image of a popular, well-liked company. However, accomplishing this in a fair and peer-to-peer manner is difficult without some decentralized consensus, which we’ll discuss below.\n\n## Data Legibility\n\n> *\"Those who cannot perceive the network cannot act effectively within it, and are powerless.\" - *[James Bridle](http://booktwo.org/notebook/drone-shadows/)\n\nPeople often talk about data transparency, but what about [data legibility](https://medium.com/doteveryone/data-legibility-and-a-common-language-coping-not-coding-part-2-8afb687de60)? Even if users have access to enough data on particular products, services, or the reviewers of them, rarely is that information fully comprehensible by the average user. The easier data is to understand and leverage to make better decisions, the more difficult it becomes to manipulate opinions and ratings. For example, review site Yelp could easily determine a score for a reviewer in different categories of rating. Reviewers could theoretically be given a high score for their reviews on mechanics while a low score for their reviews on bars, and have this be shown to the users directly from the venue page where the review was. By doing this, sites like Yelp can put more power into the hands of the users with the same data that is currently displayed on them.\n\n## Concerns & Liabilities\n\nIt’s important to consider ethical externalities and relevant responsibilities that a social protocol takes on. This is of extremely high priority for us at Yup. In the process of building, we're paying very close attention to these concerns. That being said, we feel that some of people's discomfort with our propositions are misguided and are worth discussing.\n\n### The Stigma of Social Scores\n\nSome initial users of our beta have stated that the implications of a reputation score lends a discomfort reminiscent of Black Mirror’s “Nosedive.” Some of the terminology that we use at Yup, such as “social value” or “influence” concerns people. [*Some writers*](https://bwog.com/2019/10/an-explanation-of-those-colored-underlines-around-campus/) have even stated that “the extension itself contains some indelibly frosty sense of robotic apathy, rendered void of human subtlety and liveliness.” What we hope people will come to understand is that Black Mirror is already the status quo, our social value is already objectified by social media companies that maintain their own internal rankings and assessments based on our online interactions. The problem is that we don't have access to the data and social value metrics that existing social media sites aggregate about us, users are disenfranchised in the status quo.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUltimately, a new social consensus protocol needs to sufficiently encompass many of these solutions: opt-in data autonomy, overweb reputation layer, and more. Our goal as a team is to explore what this may look like from the eyes of prioritizing individual merit in the face of data-driven networks. We’re looking for other teams to collaborate with and grow together. We’re big believers in procedural justice, encouraging and empowering our initial community to take part in determining what is valued and prioritized on Yup.\n\nWe envision Yup as a protocol for an incentivized, distributed, and censorship-resistant social systems that provides trustless data rights. The potential use cases of the protocol are infinite, and we foresee Yup as a foundation for new and separate applications that benefit from its unique qualities.

However, distributed social consensus on the web has remained highly regarded but rarely understood. It has not been valued based on determinant incentives and, as a consequence, remains widely misrepresented and opaque. Online engagement metrics such as reach and follower counts attempt to attach numbers to this force, but measure with regard to quantity rather than quality, making them easily manipulable and highly untrustworthy. These metrics fail to accurately capture social capital, leaving social networks highly vulnerable to weak governance, sybil identities, and the spread of disinformation, harming digital communities and trust. Under this system, users have little economic incentive to express their opinion on content and one another genuinely, and their opinions are weighted evenly regardless of their own social capital. As our online presence consumes most of our daily lives, our society will be defined by our ability to solve these new social problems on the internet. In our eyes, the quest for online social consensus is a continuous quest for a better humanity in the digital age.\n\nRecently, due to technological improvements to distributed systems and cryptography, the world’s social media leaders have begun to imagine similar designs enabled by blockchain tech. Industry titans such as Jack Dorsey (Twitter) and Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) have started research and development towards these exact ends. On the crypto-economic side of these developments, new innovators have emerged who are attempting to tackle problems around collective decision-making and DAO-based identity systems. Thought leaders in this field have realized that a better method of allocating the value accrued on online platforms is needed and could be achieved by incentivizing participants at every scale for their online actions, directly monetizing the content they create, rate, or proliferate.\n\nIn tandem to issues surrounding online social capital, the current centralization of most networks entitles operators to rent-seek and sway user behavior, all while hoarding user data that could provide an enhanced experience and new streams of income for individuals.\n\nIn an attempt to solve these pitfalls of the web, a group of students at Columbia University built [*Yup*](http://yup.io/?utm=blog), a protocol that facilitates the distribution, measurement, and governance of online social capital in a pseudonymous yet transparent opinion-based economy. That’s a technical way of saying that ***Yup is respect*** –a movement to represent, reward, and empower respect across the internet, with content primed to earn users’ approval, not attention.\n\nYup offers a fair weighting of opinions, a single universal reputation/identity that can be used on all sites without competing with existing business models, a native and scarce asset to facilitate monetization or attention markets, and an immutable record of reviews and reputations. Let us explore the shortcomings in existing centralized and decentralized systems, point to promising solutions, and propose a new protocol governed by social capital.\n\n## Identity\n\n### Identity in the Digital Realm\n\nWhat does it mean to be a valuable user online? Is this reserved for individual humans? Must they be legally recognized? In [**Authenticity in the Age of Digital Companions**](http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/pdfsforstwebpage/ST_Authenticity%20in%20age%20of%20digi%20comp.pdf), famed sociologist Sherry Turkle argues that “by the mid-90s, humans were not alone as emotional machines.” She also points to experiments where kids quickly treated robots as companions deserving of compassion despite being scientifically demystified. This type of interactions between bots and people will only increase over time, she suggests.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_567ed6bd2a4440ff963316b9940b550b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nOne of our favorite Instagram users, [*@lilmiquela*](https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/), isn’t real in the *human* sense. But that hasn’t stopped her from becoming a superstar. Miquela is a self-described robot led by the Sequoia-backed media company [***Brud***](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V5N5tcfm7wBuUshgrmIOz9ijAO-VRqvkUbGRu0uKdI8/edit)**.** She’s cleverly placed alongside “real” people to appear life-like. This [*Gorillaz*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnrEEoVOUlE)-esque approach to identity is starting to catch on, as more and more Miquela wannabes sprout up.\n\n[***Block.One***](https://block.one/)**,** the blockchain development company behind EOS and Steem, have a new decentralized social media project called [***Voice***](https://voice.com/) that they announced last summer. The Voice project seems to take a different angle at this identity issue, opting to essentially require every sign up to legally identify themselves with documents such as a driver’s license or passport. Dan Larimer and others at B1 cite responsibility as their reason, wishing to hold users accountable for their interactions. It remains to be seen as how Voice plans on decentralizing this process over time, to make sure that their network doesn’t remain inherently permissioned. Identity DAOs like [***Humanity DAO***](https://www.humanitydao.org/) and [***Democracy Earth***](https://democracy.earth/) have tried to crowd-source identity, building economic incentives around the recognition of humans via incentive mechanisms that resemble universal basic income. *But both of these approaches lack the proper room for the lil’ Miquelas of the world.* The social networks of the future will still need to account for individuals, groups, teams, companies, communities, or even algorithms being represented by a single identity. A protocol shouldn’t by design limit users to one account tied to their real identity –furthermore, accounts shouldn’t be limited to one person or even a human.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_210b96020670486098e4899e9ef2ce63~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nIn a different piece from 2008, Sherry Turkle [*argues*](http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/pdfsforstwebpage/Turkle_how_computers_change_way_we_think.pdf) that “Online worlds can provide valuable spaces for identity play.” This is clearly seen by the emergence of ‘finstas’ (fake IG accounts) and group IG accounts, which represent a fundamental shift in the ‘roles’ online users take during interactions. In this sense, it becomes very difficult to properly attribute authenticity or inauthenticity to any one user. So as the lines between human vs. robot, person vs. group, as well as person vs. themselves begin to fade, what does ‘authenticity’ really mean?\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_4ac0f95ba10a412abf0b7b11dc813ca9~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nIt’s all about social value. A username or identity is only as ‘real’ as we allow it to be. If it matters to us as a society, it is in fact authentic, whether or not it owns a heart, four hearts, an XY chromosome, or CPU. For example, Satoshi Nakamoto is the still-secret pseudonym used for the creator(s) of Bitcoin. Yet today, it doesn’t really matter who Satoshi Nakamoto is/was, but what they represent and what kind of social capital their identity holds. The only information known about Satoshi is their digital footprint and social approval, and so that becomes their identity, the role they play, and the context in which one would interact with him/her/them. If Satoshi was found to be a robot, it would not change the power and reputation of their identity. Nothing but a private key signature would be necessary for them to take advantage of all of that built up social capital. So, if social value is crucial in determining identity online, humans need signal vehicles to properly perform in this new environment.\n\n### Data Autonomy\n\nFor the majority of web2 online platforms, user data has been a relatively zero-sum game. Every platform is incentivized to hoard data, hurting the user’s experience. For example, when you log in to Tinder via Facebook OAuth, Facebook Inc. is choosing what to share with Tinder and what not to share. While FB may permit you to allow Tinder to know some information, it hides the majority of your data and metadata because it’s extremely valuable and diminishes in value as access increases. This is despite the fact that this data could enable Tinder to provide you with a better experience. You as a user have no real say in this matter and, as a result, are the biggest loser from this zero-sum game. Since its inception, the world wide web has lacked solutions to this equilibrium, but distributed ledger technology has given rise to new projects and products aiming to disrupt this existing data competition and give users real ownership over their data. Sir Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the world wide web, has been working on a new project titled [***Solid***](https://solid.inrupt.com/) that’s focused around solving this problem. By way of the Solid “POD”, a storage locker controlled by private keys with different permissions, users can decide where to store their data. Since users have immutable ownership over their data, they’re free to move it at any time, choosing who has access to it without interruption of service. In order to write data as well as to read it, and to protect privacy, it is important to control who has access to what. In Solid’s case this is managed using the web access control list specification and the WebID Identity spec.\n\nOther teams are building similar products. [***OrbitDB***](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db), for example, tries to achieve similar peer-to-peer database capabilities, functioning as a serverless and peer-to-peer storage locker built on IPFS data storage and Pubsub. [***3Box***](https://3box.io/) is building a comparable framework for Ethereum applications. Smart contract platform [***Blockstack***](https://blockstack.org/) has prioritized these features, adding OAuth log-in and data locker capabilities to its base layer protocol. By way of a universal identity layer, Yup is providing similar functionality users, focusing on qualitative metadata as user’s most lucrative asset.\n\n## Attention\n\nOnline attention is a key ingredient in harvesting influence. Several entities have capitalized on this notion, quickly trading it as a commodity of product sales and branding. Additionally, it gave power and voice to advocacy. Most social media platforms remain economically efficient through the resale of what attention it could capture in exchange for its \\`free' content.\n\nContent creators in top social media platforms have little direct way to monetize their fans’ attention or get a share of ad revenue. In response, they have resorted to grossly ineffective workarounds. This resulted in an economy that disproportionately rewards a handful of centralized social media companies instead of the content creators that give such platforms value. Members of thriving online communities that exist on popular social media platforms currently have no control in the developments of the sites they helped grow; the length and extent of their engagement is undermined. Additionally, there is no direct relationship between the demand of users and sponsored content/monetization. This stunts influencers’ ability to build user loyalty around an account or channel. There are no real incentives to support quality content and discourage poor behavior.\n\nUpon examining the makeup of existing centralized social networks, we conclude that social capital is misrepresented and easily purchased, and the monetization of attention is one sided or separate from the network itself. Yup prioritizes respect instead of attention whereby the user is the customer, not the product. Our focus isn’t on growing engagement but rather curating content that people actually enjoy.\n\n### The Monetization of Attention\n\nThere are a handful of distributed ledgers, platforms, and applications being built to decentralize social networks and advertising. **Steem**, a decentralized social network blockchain, mints new tokens and rewards content creators for their virality. In order to mitigate sybil attacks, the Steem network must have certain barriers on account creation that hurts onboarding and thus the community at large. This is quite inefficient and counts on user error to bouey the price of STEEM, giving a strong advantage to profit-driven automated users.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_520507ed2fa74273ab1d424146ac290c~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nSimilarly, Voting bots plague the Steem network to such an extent that the community accepts them as a part of their ecosystem. Users can pay bots to curate their content or to vote on their behalf for rewards. Users can earn more tokens by proxy-staking to bots than by actually participating in the network. As a result, users are now incentivized to be less engaged and simply proxy-stake their holdings to maximize returns. This new form of advertising accepted by many protocol communities has additional issues including the lack of strong incentives to support channels and accounts, the direct relationship between token holdings and influence on the network which ignores user activity or length of involvement, unannounced shutdowns of the blockchain for updates, and rampant misinformation.\n\nNew models with similar designs have risen in the last few years. Originally built on the Steem blockchain, ***DLive***, an up-and-coming project that has partnered with celebrities like [*PewDiePie*](https://www.newsweek.com/dlive-pewdiepie-stream-schedule-app-youtube-1390512), began to gain traction in spring of 2019. It transitioned from Steem to **Lino**, a blockchain that similarly rewards content creators and curators through an inflation-based rewards system but includes donation (see Tipping section below). One of the key incentives for DLive’s chain transition must be because of Lino promising 70% of token rewards to apps and developers directly. Creators and curators of content, on the other hand, are expected to make most of their money from donations. Unfortunately, this may hurt Lino in the long run as ecosystems and communities become too siloed to reflect that type of rewards system. This already seems to be the case with Tron supposedly [*acquiring DLive*](https://cryptobriefing.com/tron-acquires-dlive-blockchain-streaming-platform/) in late December ‘19 and looking to transition the app away from Lino and to its own blockchain. Furthermore, the Lino blockchain [*defines reputation solely by money spent*](https://link.lino.network/whitepaper), leading to plutocracies and inaccurate reputation schemes.\n\n### Advertising\n\n**Marketplaces**\n\nAdvertisement is currently the primary form of online content monetization, often considered the ‘[*original sin*](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/)’ of the internet. While most of us hate ads, our favorite sites and platforms wouldn’t exist without them. However, it’d be nice we as users received a piece of this ad revenue both for contributing content for engaging with ads. Brave, the company that maintains the Basic Attention Token (BAT), has tried to compete with Google Ads on this front, building their own protocol and browser that pays users for viewing ads and allows them to tip sites they visit, the age old way of economizing content. However, they similarly fail to attribute value to social capital, measuring ad views equally for every individual despite their potential greater importance for ads – a billionaire and I stand to make the same money on Brave despite them being in much higher demand in terms of advertising. Tipping usually refers to the feature allowing consumers to send money to a creator. There are great mainstream and crypto examples of tipping, including YouTube, [***Patreon***](http://patreon.com/)**, **[***Cent***](http://cent.co/)**, **[***Peepeth***](https://peepeth.com/), and [***Tippin.Me**.*](http://tippin.me/)\n\n**Censorship**\n\nEvery social platform must deal with the well-documented tension between censorship and free speech. If censorship is too limited, inappropriate and sensationalist content surfaces super quick. If censorship is too liberally used, speech suppression is inevitable. This would lead to family-friendly communities on one side of the spectrum and censorship-resistant ‘explicit’ ones on the other side. A good example of this is [***Gab***](https://gab.com/), a social network that prioritizes low censorship. Today, Gab has a reputation of being a hotbed for white supremacists and other questionable actors. Finding a goldilocks middle ground between the two is incredibly difficult and requires distributed consensus. The community at large will always know what’s better for the network than the headquarters of a centralized entity, but they will be much slower and more inefficient in executing that vision.\n\nOne of the big advantages of decentralized social networks is that they’re often more censorship-resistant. One project that aims to leverage this advantage is [***AKASHA***](https://akasha.world/)**,** which stands for 'Advanced Knowledge Architecture for Social Human Advocacy'. AKASHA (2015) is an Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized social media platform that is embedded into the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS). The Akasha decentralized social media platform is built to ensure the platform is resistant against censorship and be unable to be taken offline because it does not have any one central point of failure or lack of bandwidth issues.\n\n## Opinions & Social Capital\n\nThe opinions of others are vital to the Internet economy; it is the core component upon which value metrics are built. This is most clear in online product/service reviews. A highly-cited [*Harvard Business School study *](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=41233)from 2011 estimated that a one-star rating increase on Yelp translated to an increase of 5% to 9% in revenues for a restaurant. [*Cornell researchers*](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-announces-settlement-machinima-and-three-other-companies-false) found that a one-star change in a hotel’s online ratings on sites like Travelocity and TripAdvisor is tied to an 11% sway in room rates, on average.\n\nThe internet’s peer-to-peer nature is a huge reason for this, as opinions have become more accessible. Average user rating has become a huge driver of sales, and now, user-generated ratings and narrative reviews can be found on almost every website that sells something.\n\nThe results of a 2017 study by Podium show that 93% of American consumers say that online reviews have an impact on their purchasing decisions. 91% of 18-34 year old consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Star rating currently is the number one factor used by users to judge businesses.\n\nHowever, treating these social metrics as highly accurate does not necessarily make them so. University of Colorado Boulder professors Langhe, Fernbach, and Lichtenstein investigated the actual and perceived validity of online user ratings and found a \"substantial disconnect between the objective quality information that online user ratings actually convey and the extent to which consumers trust them as indicators of objective quality.\" They analyzed 344,157 Amazon ratings of 1,272 products in 120 product categories and compared them to ratings on Consumer Reports as well as resale value. They conclude that average user ratings correlate poorly with* Consumer Report *scores, and, while *Consumer Reports *correctly predict resale value, user ratings do not. This is because:\n\n\\- When reviewers are vetted and paid to review products (as is the case in Consumer Reports), their opinions are usually a stronger indication of quality.\n\n\\- Without a mechanism to ensure this, reviews lose their meaning.\n\nAdditionally, Langhe et al. argue that \"consumers fail to consider these issues appropriately when forming quality inferences from user ratings and other observable cues. They place enormous weight on the average user rating as an indicator of objective quality compared to other cues. They also fail to moderate their reliance on the average user rating when sample size is insufficient.\" In other words, the average user lacks both the data and know-how to make accurate inferences on the quality of products based on user ratings.\n\nDespite both the high value attributed to user opinion and the importance of monetizing it for accurate representation of quality, our own research suggests that less than 0.001% of online opinion is monetized today. Without any incentive to review honestly, users tend to express negative reviews more often and more extremely, with little to no reason to contribute positive reviews. This lack of monetization also tips the balance for malicious actors looking to manipulate their perceived quality: the incentives to create a false opinion for money from a malicious actor outweigh those to review honestly. Fakespot, a ratings analytics tool, [estimates](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buyer-beware-a-scourge-of-fake-online-reviews-is-hitting-amazon-walmart-and-other-major-retailers/) that 52 percent of Walmart reviews and 30 percent of Amazon reviews are fake or unreliable.\n\n### Misaligned Incentives\n\nThere remains a fundamental misalignment between the incentives of the platform and its users in terms of user inputted opinions. The platforms gain from the influx of data, and do everything they can to ensure that this input of data is smooth, regardless of accuracy. Users have no incentive to review accurately and therefore act based on external interests. Crucially, this whole system is flawed because it functions independently of real monetization for all parties involved.\n\n**So why would people give honest opinions without any incentive? **This is why we witness 21% more negative reviews than positive ones; with no other incentives involved, anger/frustration seems to be the driving incentive for negative reviews. Yup is designed to solve this problem by financially incentivizing accurate opinions with monetary rewards. Limiting the number of actions a user can do is also important in order to establish scarcity.\n\n> *“More people are depending on reviews for what to buy and where to go, so the incentives for faking are getting bigger… **It’s a very cheap way of marketing.\"***- Bing Liu, Professor at University of Illinois\n\nIn the internet age, reviews have very much become a form of marketing and has evolved into an enormous business: [reputation management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_management). Companies need reputations, and reputations come from people, unless you can buy them for cheaper than an ad campaign.\n\n**The Consequences of Access**\n\nWe expect that changes in* access *that occurred as a result of the rise of the internet had a significant effect on the trust in and accuracy of opinions. Access in this case refers to both the ability for anyone to rate products/ services/ content and the ease at which one can see more ratings online.\n\nWhen online review forums first emerged, they provided increasingly accurate opinions because of the “[wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)” effect taking hold. In James Surowiecki’s *The Wisdom of Crowds*, the famed journalist talks about bad intuitions around individual vs. group decision-making. These initial communities were small, and natural reputation effects among members existed because many knew each other by name. As misconceptions about the internet dissipated, trust in these reviews grew because they were in fact more accurate. But as access continued to increase and platforms changed, the natural reputation effects shrunk. This decreased the reputation at stake for each user and allowed for fake reviews to thrive, reducing accuracy significantly. Now, there is still a correlation between accuracy and trust; more accuracy leads to more trust, BUT more trust doesn’t necessarily lead to more accuracy. In fact, the more trust users have in online reviews the more worthwhile they are to fake/manipulate, creating a harmful equilibrium: **more accuracy → more trust → less accuracy → less trust → more accuracy … **I talk about this further in my piece [*“Opinion Economy”*](https://www.blog.yup.io/post/the-opinion-economy).\n\nWhile public metrics of social approval are not the only way to attribute this form of social capital to an identity, it is a very important one, so the removal of those metrics is to the detriment of the establishment of internet identities. The obscuring of relative signaling by removing public likes, like Instagram plans on doing, can be massively harmful to the structure of the society because it takes this information (and therefore power) away from the viewers.\n\n**Experts**\n\n*The notion that all opinions are created equal online is a large reason for the inaccuracy of opinions.*\n\nPeople like to trust brands and institutions as experts on a certain subject. In reality, however, they rarely are the experts we expect them to be. This is first because finding experts is a skill of its own, which can be flawed and time-consuming. As there are more sources, statistics, data points, and faux expertise, it becomes increasingly difficult to spot experts. Surowiecki expands on this point: “The problem is that even if these superior beings, do exist, there is no easy way to identify them.” This is also true for the experts themselves, who also may not be aware that they are experts. In fact, those within a crowd that project themselves as experts rarely are.\n\nClaiming individual humans know less than they’ve ever known, Yuval Noah Harari breaks down the impact of power and technology on our individual knowledge in his book [**21 Lessons for the 21st Century**](https://philosophiatopics.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/yuval-noah-harari-21-lessons-for-the-21st-century.pdf). He explains that humans are even less aware of their cognitive blindspots today than ever before. Because Google gives us an answer to any question, we think we’re experts and have a difficult time identifying our skills and shortcomings.\n\n[***Roll***](http://tryroll.com/) seeks to tokenize influencers, aligning curators with the specific growth of creators and influencers rather than that of the network. The financial success of curators in this case is determined by the speculative trading of influencer assets. This has serious problems in enforcement but projects some key insights about influence online. This is a way to determine experts, but not in their original form, but wholly in influence, expertise, and attention.\n\nYup attempts to prioritize reputation-based social consensus over brands and institutions. When conceiving of Yup, we used advances in distributed systems to explore new ways to (1) improve the user’s ability to identify inaccuracies, (2) deter the manipulation/misuse of reviews, and (3) correctly weight reviewers’ expertise on certain topics, communities could reach a perfect correlation between changes in trust and accuracy. Yup utilizes layered social level consensus to build sustainable governance of its network and provide proper representation of network value. This orders participants by their recognized social level. Every address on the network will have a social level as a measurement of others’ opinions of them. Their individual social levels will be determined by all other addresses on the network.\n\n**Testimonials**\n\n**Testimonials **have long been an example of quality signal vehicles for identifying the quality or reputation of a product or service. People tend Recently, as expected, individuals have found ways to manipulate and mislead testimonials as well. The most humorous example of false testimonials that we’ve come across is the one highlighted by YouTuber Coffeezilla in his [*Fake Guru video on Sam Ovens*](https://youtu.be/ez8yKklc1lE?t=150) (‘fake gurus’ are defined as online personalities that falsely sell themselves as business gurus). In this hilarious video, Coffeezilla discovers that Sam Ovens’ top testimonial, Dave Rogenmoser, actually had been making seemingly fake testimonials for dozens of ‘fake gurus’ during a 2 year span and may have been a fake guru himself. This epitomizes both the weight viewers give to online testimonials and their potential for misuse and manipulation.\n\n**Attempts at Reputation**\n\nSites whose main function is reviews have taken stronger actions to represent reputation in opinions. **Yelp** attempts to show a user’s reputation by reflecting the votes others have given on their reviews (as well as some other stats). The advantage of this portrayal of reputation is that it allows users to vet reviewers as ‘legitimate,’ mostly negative or positive in their reviews, or as having tendencies to act a certain way. The main problem with these metrics is that they don’t provide information or expertise; if a user is funny, how does that make them a better reviewer of bars? Sure, if you dig deep enough, you can start to infer certain things like that a reviewer’s past opinions on car mechanics may be strongly supported by the community or that their reviews on hardware stores are thought to be useless. But the search costs for doing this for every reviewer are far too high right now.\n\nLastly, this representation of reputation doesn’t affect the weighting of stars for a business. You could have a good rep on Yelp and still have the same influence over average ratings as any other user.\n\nBy making everyone equal, no one can be discovered as an expert. **What we must realize is that opinions aren’t democracies;** we shouldn’t all get an equal say as to the subjective quality of products, venues, or anything else for that matter. What we need is more of a meritocracy, because some of us have earned the right to speak on certain topics with authority, not necessarily through a college degree or an award but could simply be receiving the continued approval of the online community. This one-person-one-vote model just doesn’t make sense for diverse decision-making, because it doesn’t distribute accurate weight to the expertise of various participants.\n\n**Scarcity and Stake**\n\nStrong opinion models should provide major incentives for accurate reviews. If users were rewarded (monetarily or otherwise) for reviewing things, they’d take the time to make better decisions. One way of doing this is by P2P validation, meaning that if other users agree with a user’s opinion, either by upvoting their opinion or by submitting a similar review, that user should get rewarded. Yup identifies content and distributes rewards according to the value (influence) of the opinions associated with that content. In this case, we define *content* as any specific data online that user(s) deem worth judging, including but not limited to texts, images, videos, locations, accounts, and links. The influence metric is a function of engagement, ownership over time, and reputation. In Yup’s case, the final important piece here is scarcity: users should have a limited amount of reviews that they can give within a set amount of time. If users stand to gain or lose from their reviews, and they can only give their opinion x times a day, they’re less likely to abuse or waste these reviews.\n\nOn the opposite side of incentive is deterrence; users should be deterred from submitting inaccurate reviews. This could be enacted in a similar fashion, whereby users lose something for giving bad reviews that no one agrees with or supports. With Yup, this comes in the opportunity cost of giving an opinion elsewhere, where users may miss the opportunity to see returns if they vote inaccurately.\n\nSimilar concepts has been attempted in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space with the *Token Curated Registries*: lists of similar products/content/etc. that are curated by staking cryptocoins. This can be perceived as ‘betting’ that a product will be liked by others and they’ll also vote for it. If others also bet on it, you receive a token reward, if no one does, you lose your stake. In many of those systems, earning tokens and purchasing tokens holds the same value, despite there being no evidence that this is the right way to represent network participation.\n\n## Governance\n\nIn *Culture and Power: The Sociology of Pierre Bourdieu*, David Swartz begins with “Culture provides the very grounds for human communication and interaction; it is also a source of domination.” The same could be stated about the online behemoths that presently host our culture. While traditional social networks have expanded the size and function of communication, marketing, and organization, their monopolistic increase in internet market power has drawn a wide divide in incentives between their services and their user base. While there are forces that compel large networks to comply to certain restrictions, the implications of the extent of their hold over human behavior is concerning. For example, in 2010, Facebook ran [*a stealth experiment*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22972300) on 61,000,000 American accounts during the US congressional elections to see how small messages (banners above the news feed) could affect user’s voter turnout and more. They argue: “The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking, and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users’ friends, and friends of friends.”\n\nTheir results suggest that “Facebook social message increased turnout directly by about 60,000 voters and indirectly through social contagion by another 280,000 voters.” That 340,000 total represents about 0.14% of the country’s voting age population in 2010. For context, George Bush beat Al Gore in Florida by 537 votes in 2000. If a similar tight race occurred today, it wouldn’t be hyperbole to assume that Facebook could alter the political landscape of the United States with their [*4x user growth*](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/) and multi-billion dollar acquisitions since 2010.\n\nFacebook ran the voting experiment in 2010 but only made the results public in 2012 under their free will. If they had maliciously kept this study internal, the U.S. public and government may not have ever been aware. Second, because of Facebook’s immense network effects, the Cambridge Analytica data breach had little to no impact on its market dominance. Despite exposing over 80 million users’ information to third parties, resulting in trust in Facebook falling by over 50% in the following weeks, daily active users, minutes of usage, and advertising revenue all increased. This suggests that not only can giant social networks hide their manipulation, but also that average users are too network-dependent for their sentiment to be notably reflected in Facebook’s economics. Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes makes this same argument, arguing for the breaking up of Facebook into smaller companies in his famous *New York Times* piece “[*It’s Time to Break Up Facebook*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html)”. He writes that “Mark’s influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government.” At the helm of FB, Instagram, and WhatsApp, he argues that Zuckerberg has too much control. Despite being a publicly traded company, “Facebook’s board works more like an advisory committee than an overseer, because Mark controls around 60 percent of voting shares,” he writes. “Mark alone can decide how to configure Facebook’s algorithms to determine what people see in their News Feeds, what privacy settings they can use and even which messages get delivered. He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent and incendiary speech from the merely offensive, and he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it.”\n\n**Decentralization**\n\nThe benefits of decentralization have been highlighted thus far in this piece. However, decentralized protocols present their own issues such as bribing, collusion, and tragedy of the commons. Just like in their centralized counterparts, if a positive rating is worth more to a marketer than the money lost in achieving that rating on one of these platforms, they’ll surely try to manipulate it. This is entirely possible considering that users will probably not stake too much on one individual rating, especially if there aren’t that many participants. Except now, policing this must be governed democratically, making it more difficult at times. We all have heard of the [*PTSD that some Facebook moderators*](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa) have received from doing this kind of work…\n\n### First Layer Governance\n\nAt the consensus layer, there are several inefficiencies that can be improved upon with social capital. Nakamoto consensus uses proof-of-work to cleanly solve several issues in majority decision making, abandoning the notion of “one-IP-one-vote” for “one-CPU-one-vote”. However, one problem that arises as a result is the power ascribed to outsourced physical capital. Participants can gain more influence over the network by purchasing computational power with money from other economic systems. This means that the relationship between capital spent to maintain the network and the capital earned for doing so is not quite internal: 1 kW of electricity purchased with USD has equal power over the Bitcoin network as 1 kW purchased with BTC. PoS and DPoS mechanisms improve on this problem by requiring miners to stake network tokens to participate in consensus (‘one-token-one-vote’). Yet, it still does not properly reflect network participation: staking 1 network token that was purchased on an exchange provides the same mining power as 1 network token earned via mining. This dependence on physical capital makes networks susceptible to byzantine behavior from capital-rich outside parties as well as hinders the most-mover-advantages of participating in consensus. The ability to transparently quantify and represent social capital can provide stronger models for decentralized systems. Governed by an influence metric, the Yup protocol aggregates reputations, distributes opinion-based rewards, and facilitates fair ad exchange, resulting in clear, transparent consensus around social capital. It uses social level consensus to bring about anonymous P2P review and a money-resistant reputation scheme. This can be extremely helpful in solving some of the issues around protocol governance, particularly PoS and DAOs.\n\n## The Overweb, A Platform Agnostic Future\n\nBecause of the data silos laid out in the previous sections above, it may be likely that the open social protocol of the future will be platform agnostic and have overweb capabilities. Overweb is a term coined to describe software that is used to enhance one’s experience across the web rather than on one specific site or platform. The notion of platform-agnostic protocols is very well described by Mike Masnick in his piece \"[*Protocols, not Platforms*](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech)\".\n\n[***Klout***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klout) may be a great social example of overweb. Klout was a website and mobile app launched in 2008 that used social media analytics to rate its users according to online social influence via the \"Klout Score\". In determining the user score, Klout measured the size of a user's social media network and correlated the content created to measure how other users interact with that content.\n\nKlout used Bing, Facebook, Foursquare, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, and Wikipedia data to create Klout user profiles that were assigned a unique \"Klout Score\". Ultimately, Lithium Technologies, who acquired the site in 2014, closed the service in 2018. The largest reason for Klout’s failure, we propose, it’s lack of access to proprietary data of individual users on these other platforms. When Yup is attempting to aggregate influence across the web in this similar way, it is crucial that it exist atop a decentralized protocol such as the Yup protocol. Otherwise, it would quickly become difficult to integrate with any other site.\n\n### Status at Stake\n\nIn a platform where opinions are perfectly weighted and distributed, reviews would be more accurate. Investment in malicious marketing would be deterred. The distortion of customer reviews would be difficult. Cash would flow towards improving product quality + retaining users, rather than used to bolster the fraudulent image of a popular, well-liked company. However, accomplishing this in a fair and peer-to-peer manner is difficult without some decentralized consensus, which we’ll discuss below.\n\n## Data Legibility\n\n> *\"Those who cannot perceive the network cannot act effectively within it, and are powerless.\" - *[James Bridle](http://booktwo.org/notebook/drone-shadows/)\n\nPeople often talk about data transparency, but what about [data legibility](https://medium.com/doteveryone/data-legibility-and-a-common-language-coping-not-coding-part-2-8afb687de60)? Even if users have access to enough data on particular products, services, or the reviewers of them, rarely is that information fully comprehensible by the average user. The easier data is to understand and leverage to make better decisions, the more difficult it becomes to manipulate opinions and ratings. For example, review site Yelp could easily determine a score for a reviewer in different categories of rating. Reviewers could theoretically be given a high score for their reviews on mechanics while a low score for their reviews on bars, and have this be shown to the users directly from the venue page where the review was. By doing this, sites like Yelp can put more power into the hands of the users with the same data that is currently displayed on them.\n\n## Concerns & Liabilities\n\nIt’s important to consider ethical externalities and relevant responsibilities that a social protocol takes on. This is of extremely high priority for us at Yup. In the process of building, we're paying very close attention to these concerns. That being said, we feel that some of people's discomfort with our propositions are misguided and are worth discussing.\n\n### The Stigma of Social Scores\n\nSome initial users of our beta have stated that the implications of a reputation score lends a discomfort reminiscent of Black Mirror’s “Nosedive.” Some of the terminology that we use at Yup, such as “social value” or “influence” concerns people. [*Some writers*](https://bwog.com/2019/10/an-explanation-of-those-colored-underlines-around-campus/) have even stated that “the extension itself contains some indelibly frosty sense of robotic apathy, rendered void of human subtlety and liveliness.” What we hope people will come to understand is that Black Mirror is already the status quo, our social value is already objectified by social media companies that maintain their own internal rankings and assessments based on our online interactions. The problem is that we don't have access to the data and social value metrics that existing social media sites aggregate about us, users are disenfranchised in the status quo.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUltimately, a new social consensus protocol needs to sufficiently encompass many of these solutions: opt-in data autonomy, overweb reputation layer, and more. Our goal as a team is to explore what this may look like from the eyes of prioritizing individual merit in the face of data-driven networks. We’re looking for other teams to collaborate with and grow together. We’re big believers in procedural justice, encouraging and empowering our initial community to take part in determining what is valued and prioritized on Yup.\n\nWe envision Yup as a protocol for an incentivized, distributed, and censorship-resistant social systems that provides trustless data rights. The potential use cases of the protocol are infinite, and we foresee Yup as a foundation for new and separate applications that benefit from its unique qualities.

However, distributed social consensus on the web has remained highly regarded but rarely understood. It has not been valued based on determinant incentives and, as a consequence, remains widely misrepresented and opaque. Online engagement metrics such as reach and follower counts attempt to attach numbers to this force, but measure with regard to quantity rather than quality, making them easily manipulable and highly untrustworthy. These metrics fail to accurately capture social capital, leaving social networks highly vulnerable to weak governance, sybil identities, and the spread of disinformation, harming digital communities and trust. Under this system, users have little economic incentive to express their opinion on content and one another genuinely, and their opinions are weighted evenly regardless of their own social capital. As our online presence consumes most of our daily lives, our society will be defined by our ability to solve these new social problems on the internet. In our eyes, the quest for online social consensus is a continuous quest for a better humanity in the digital age.\n\nRecently, due to technological improvements to distributed systems and cryptography, the world’s social media leaders have begun to imagine similar designs enabled by blockchain tech. Industry titans such as Jack Dorsey (Twitter) and Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) have started research and development towards these exact ends. On the crypto-economic side of these developments, new innovators have emerged who are attempting to tackle problems around collective decision-making and DAO-based identity systems. Thought leaders in this field have realized that a better method of allocating the value accrued on online platforms is needed and could be achieved by incentivizing participants at every scale for their online actions, directly monetizing the content they create, rate, or proliferate.\n\nIn tandem to issues surrounding online social capital, the current centralization of most networks entitles operators to rent-seek and sway user behavior, all while hoarding user data that could provide an enhanced experience and new streams of income for individuals.\n\nIn an attempt to solve these pitfalls of the web, a group of students at Columbia University built [*Yup*](http://yup.io/?utm=blog), a protocol that facilitates the distribution, measurement, and governance of online social capital in a pseudonymous yet transparent opinion-based economy. That’s a technical way of saying that ***Yup is respect*** –a movement to represent, reward, and empower respect across the internet, with content primed to earn users’ approval, not attention.\n\nYup offers a fair weighting of opinions, a single universal reputation/identity that can be used on all sites without competing with existing business models, a native and scarce asset to facilitate monetization or attention markets, and an immutable record of reviews and reputations. Let us explore the shortcomings in existing centralized and decentralized systems, point to promising solutions, and propose a new protocol governed by social capital.\n\n## Identity\n\n### Identity in the Digital Realm\n\nWhat does it mean to be a valuable user online? Is this reserved for individual humans? Must they be legally recognized? In [**Authenticity in the Age of Digital Companions**](http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/pdfsforstwebpage/ST_Authenticity%20in%20age%20of%20digi%20comp.pdf), famed sociologist Sherry Turkle argues that “by the mid-90s, humans were not alone as emotional machines.” She also points to experiments where kids quickly treated robots as companions deserving of compassion despite being scientifically demystified. This type of interactions between bots and people will only increase over time, she suggests.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_567ed6bd2a4440ff963316b9940b550b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nOne of our favorite Instagram users, [*@lilmiquela*](https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/), isn’t real in the *human* sense. But that hasn’t stopped her from becoming a superstar. Miquela is a self-described robot led by the Sequoia-backed media company [***Brud***](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V5N5tcfm7wBuUshgrmIOz9ijAO-VRqvkUbGRu0uKdI8/edit)**.** She’s cleverly placed alongside “real” people to appear life-like. This [*Gorillaz*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnrEEoVOUlE)-esque approach to identity is starting to catch on, as more and more Miquela wannabes sprout up.\n\n[***Block.One***](https://block.one/)**,** the blockchain development company behind EOS and Steem, have a new decentralized social media project called [***Voice***](https://voice.com/) that they announced last summer. The Voice project seems to take a different angle at this identity issue, opting to essentially require every sign up to legally identify themselves with documents such as a driver’s license or passport. Dan Larimer and others at B1 cite responsibility as their reason, wishing to hold users accountable for their interactions. It remains to be seen as how Voice plans on decentralizing this process over time, to make sure that their network doesn’t remain inherently permissioned. Identity DAOs like [***Humanity DAO***](https://www.humanitydao.org/) and [***Democracy Earth***](https://democracy.earth/) have tried to crowd-source identity, building economic incentives around the recognition of humans via incentive mechanisms that resemble universal basic income. *But both of these approaches lack the proper room for the lil’ Miquelas of the world.* The social networks of the future will still need to account for individuals, groups, teams, companies, communities, or even algorithms being represented by a single identity. A protocol shouldn’t by design limit users to one account tied to their real identity –furthermore, accounts shouldn’t be limited to one person or even a human.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_210b96020670486098e4899e9ef2ce63~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nIn a different piece from 2008, Sherry Turkle [*argues*](http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/pdfsforstwebpage/Turkle_how_computers_change_way_we_think.pdf) that “Online worlds can provide valuable spaces for identity play.” This is clearly seen by the emergence of ‘finstas’ (fake IG accounts) and group IG accounts, which represent a fundamental shift in the ‘roles’ online users take during interactions. In this sense, it becomes very difficult to properly attribute authenticity or inauthenticity to any one user. So as the lines between human vs. robot, person vs. group, as well as person vs. themselves begin to fade, what does ‘authenticity’ really mean?\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_4ac0f95ba10a412abf0b7b11dc813ca9~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nIt’s all about social value. A username or identity is only as ‘real’ as we allow it to be. If it matters to us as a society, it is in fact authentic, whether or not it owns a heart, four hearts, an XY chromosome, or CPU. For example, Satoshi Nakamoto is the still-secret pseudonym used for the creator(s) of Bitcoin. Yet today, it doesn’t really matter who Satoshi Nakamoto is/was, but what they represent and what kind of social capital their identity holds. The only information known about Satoshi is their digital footprint and social approval, and so that becomes their identity, the role they play, and the context in which one would interact with him/her/them. If Satoshi was found to be a robot, it would not change the power and reputation of their identity. Nothing but a private key signature would be necessary for them to take advantage of all of that built up social capital. So, if social value is crucial in determining identity online, humans need signal vehicles to properly perform in this new environment.\n\n### Data Autonomy\n\nFor the majority of web2 online platforms, user data has been a relatively zero-sum game. Every platform is incentivized to hoard data, hurting the user’s experience. For example, when you log in to Tinder via Facebook OAuth, Facebook Inc. is choosing what to share with Tinder and what not to share. While FB may permit you to allow Tinder to know some information, it hides the majority of your data and metadata because it’s extremely valuable and diminishes in value as access increases. This is despite the fact that this data could enable Tinder to provide you with a better experience. You as a user have no real say in this matter and, as a result, are the biggest loser from this zero-sum game. Since its inception, the world wide web has lacked solutions to this equilibrium, but distributed ledger technology has given rise to new projects and products aiming to disrupt this existing data competition and give users real ownership over their data. Sir Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the world wide web, has been working on a new project titled [***Solid***](https://solid.inrupt.com/) that’s focused around solving this problem. By way of the Solid “POD”, a storage locker controlled by private keys with different permissions, users can decide where to store their data. Since users have immutable ownership over their data, they’re free to move it at any time, choosing who has access to it without interruption of service. In order to write data as well as to read it, and to protect privacy, it is important to control who has access to what. In Solid’s case this is managed using the web access control list specification and the WebID Identity spec.\n\nOther teams are building similar products. [***OrbitDB***](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db), for example, tries to achieve similar peer-to-peer database capabilities, functioning as a serverless and peer-to-peer storage locker built on IPFS data storage and Pubsub. [***3Box***](https://3box.io/) is building a comparable framework for Ethereum applications. Smart contract platform [***Blockstack***](https://blockstack.org/) has prioritized these features, adding OAuth log-in and data locker capabilities to its base layer protocol. By way of a universal identity layer, Yup is providing similar functionality users, focusing on qualitative metadata as user’s most lucrative asset.\n\n## Attention\n\nOnline attention is a key ingredient in harvesting influence. Several entities have capitalized on this notion, quickly trading it as a commodity of product sales and branding. Additionally, it gave power and voice to advocacy. Most social media platforms remain economically efficient through the resale of what attention it could capture in exchange for its \\`free' content.\n\nContent creators in top social media platforms have little direct way to monetize their fans’ attention or get a share of ad revenue. In response, they have resorted to grossly ineffective workarounds. This resulted in an economy that disproportionately rewards a handful of centralized social media companies instead of the content creators that give such platforms value. Members of thriving online communities that exist on popular social media platforms currently have no control in the developments of the sites they helped grow; the length and extent of their engagement is undermined. Additionally, there is no direct relationship between the demand of users and sponsored content/monetization. This stunts influencers’ ability to build user loyalty around an account or channel. There are no real incentives to support quality content and discourage poor behavior.\n\nUpon examining the makeup of existing centralized social networks, we conclude that social capital is misrepresented and easily purchased, and the monetization of attention is one sided or separate from the network itself. Yup prioritizes respect instead of attention whereby the user is the customer, not the product. Our focus isn’t on growing engagement but rather curating content that people actually enjoy.\n\n### The Monetization of Attention\n\nThere are a handful of distributed ledgers, platforms, and applications being built to decentralize social networks and advertising. **Steem**, a decentralized social network blockchain, mints new tokens and rewards content creators for their virality. In order to mitigate sybil attacks, the Steem network must have certain barriers on account creation that hurts onboarding and thus the community at large. This is quite inefficient and counts on user error to bouey the price of STEEM, giving a strong advantage to profit-driven automated users.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_520507ed2fa74273ab1d424146ac290c~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nSimilarly, Voting bots plague the Steem network to such an extent that the community accepts them as a part of their ecosystem. Users can pay bots to curate their content or to vote on their behalf for rewards. Users can earn more tokens by proxy-staking to bots than by actually participating in the network. As a result, users are now incentivized to be less engaged and simply proxy-stake their holdings to maximize returns. This new form of advertising accepted by many protocol communities has additional issues including the lack of strong incentives to support channels and accounts, the direct relationship between token holdings and influence on the network which ignores user activity or length of involvement, unannounced shutdowns of the blockchain for updates, and rampant misinformation.\n\nNew models with similar designs have risen in the last few years. Originally built on the Steem blockchain, ***DLive***, an up-and-coming project that has partnered with celebrities like [*PewDiePie*](https://www.newsweek.com/dlive-pewdiepie-stream-schedule-app-youtube-1390512), began to gain traction in spring of 2019. It transitioned from Steem to **Lino**, a blockchain that similarly rewards content creators and curators through an inflation-based rewards system but includes donation (see Tipping section below). One of the key incentives for DLive’s chain transition must be because of Lino promising 70% of token rewards to apps and developers directly. Creators and curators of content, on the other hand, are expected to make most of their money from donations. Unfortunately, this may hurt Lino in the long run as ecosystems and communities become too siloed to reflect that type of rewards system. This already seems to be the case with Tron supposedly [*acquiring DLive*](https://cryptobriefing.com/tron-acquires-dlive-blockchain-streaming-platform/) in late December ‘19 and looking to transition the app away from Lino and to its own blockchain. Furthermore, the Lino blockchain [*defines reputation solely by money spent*](https://link.lino.network/whitepaper), leading to plutocracies and inaccurate reputation schemes.\n\n### Advertising\n\n**Marketplaces**\n\nAdvertisement is currently the primary form of online content monetization, often considered the ‘[*original sin*](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/)’ of the internet. While most of us hate ads, our favorite sites and platforms wouldn’t exist without them. However, it’d be nice we as users received a piece of this ad revenue both for contributing content for engaging with ads. Brave, the company that maintains the Basic Attention Token (BAT), has tried to compete with Google Ads on this front, building their own protocol and browser that pays users for viewing ads and allows them to tip sites they visit, the age old way of economizing content. However, they similarly fail to attribute value to social capital, measuring ad views equally for every individual despite their potential greater importance for ads – a billionaire and I stand to make the same money on Brave despite them being in much higher demand in terms of advertising. Tipping usually refers to the feature allowing consumers to send money to a creator. There are great mainstream and crypto examples of tipping, including YouTube, [***Patreon***](http://patreon.com/)**, **[***Cent***](http://cent.co/)**, **[***Peepeth***](https://peepeth.com/), and [***Tippin.Me**.*](http://tippin.me/)\n\n**Censorship**\n\nEvery social platform must deal with the well-documented tension between censorship and free speech. If censorship is too limited, inappropriate and sensationalist content surfaces super quick. If censorship is too liberally used, speech suppression is inevitable. This would lead to family-friendly communities on one side of the spectrum and censorship-resistant ‘explicit’ ones on the other side. A good example of this is [***Gab***](https://gab.com/), a social network that prioritizes low censorship. Today, Gab has a reputation of being a hotbed for white supremacists and other questionable actors. Finding a goldilocks middle ground between the two is incredibly difficult and requires distributed consensus. The community at large will always know what’s better for the network than the headquarters of a centralized entity, but they will be much slower and more inefficient in executing that vision.\n\nOne of the big advantages of decentralized social networks is that they’re often more censorship-resistant. One project that aims to leverage this advantage is [***AKASHA***](https://akasha.world/)**,** which stands for 'Advanced Knowledge Architecture for Social Human Advocacy'. AKASHA (2015) is an Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized social media platform that is embedded into the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS). The Akasha decentralized social media platform is built to ensure the platform is resistant against censorship and be unable to be taken offline because it does not have any one central point of failure or lack of bandwidth issues.\n\n## Opinions & Social Capital\n\nThe opinions of others are vital to the Internet economy; it is the core component upon which value metrics are built. This is most clear in online product/service reviews. A highly-cited [*Harvard Business School study *](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=41233)from 2011 estimated that a one-star rating increase on Yelp translated to an increase of 5% to 9% in revenues for a restaurant. [*Cornell researchers*](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-announces-settlement-machinima-and-three-other-companies-false) found that a one-star change in a hotel’s online ratings on sites like Travelocity and TripAdvisor is tied to an 11% sway in room rates, on average.\n\nThe internet’s peer-to-peer nature is a huge reason for this, as opinions have become more accessible. Average user rating has become a huge driver of sales, and now, user-generated ratings and narrative reviews can be found on almost every website that sells something.\n\nThe results of a 2017 study by Podium show that 93% of American consumers say that online reviews have an impact on their purchasing decisions. 91% of 18-34 year old consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Star rating currently is the number one factor used by users to judge businesses.\n\nHowever, treating these social metrics as highly accurate does not necessarily make them so. University of Colorado Boulder professors Langhe, Fernbach, and Lichtenstein investigated the actual and perceived validity of online user ratings and found a \"substantial disconnect between the objective quality information that online user ratings actually convey and the extent to which consumers trust them as indicators of objective quality.\" They analyzed 344,157 Amazon ratings of 1,272 products in 120 product categories and compared them to ratings on Consumer Reports as well as resale value. They conclude that average user ratings correlate poorly with* Consumer Report *scores, and, while *Consumer Reports *correctly predict resale value, user ratings do not. This is because:\n\n\\- When reviewers are vetted and paid to review products (as is the case in Consumer Reports), their opinions are usually a stronger indication of quality.\n\n\\- Without a mechanism to ensure this, reviews lose their meaning.\n\nAdditionally, Langhe et al. argue that \"consumers fail to consider these issues appropriately when forming quality inferences from user ratings and other observable cues. They place enormous weight on the average user rating as an indicator of objective quality compared to other cues. They also fail to moderate their reliance on the average user rating when sample size is insufficient.\" In other words, the average user lacks both the data and know-how to make accurate inferences on the quality of products based on user ratings.\n\nDespite both the high value attributed to user opinion and the importance of monetizing it for accurate representation of quality, our own research suggests that less than 0.001% of online opinion is monetized today. Without any incentive to review honestly, users tend to express negative reviews more often and more extremely, with little to no reason to contribute positive reviews. This lack of monetization also tips the balance for malicious actors looking to manipulate their perceived quality: the incentives to create a false opinion for money from a malicious actor outweigh those to review honestly. Fakespot, a ratings analytics tool, [estimates](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buyer-beware-a-scourge-of-fake-online-reviews-is-hitting-amazon-walmart-and-other-major-retailers/) that 52 percent of Walmart reviews and 30 percent of Amazon reviews are fake or unreliable.\n\n### Misaligned Incentives\n\nThere remains a fundamental misalignment between the incentives of the platform and its users in terms of user inputted opinions. The platforms gain from the influx of data, and do everything they can to ensure that this input of data is smooth, regardless of accuracy. Users have no incentive to review accurately and therefore act based on external interests. Crucially, this whole system is flawed because it functions independently of real monetization for all parties involved.\n\n**So why would people give honest opinions without any incentive? **This is why we witness 21% more negative reviews than positive ones; with no other incentives involved, anger/frustration seems to be the driving incentive for negative reviews. Yup is designed to solve this problem by financially incentivizing accurate opinions with monetary rewards. Limiting the number of actions a user can do is also important in order to establish scarcity.\n\n> *“More people are depending on reviews for what to buy and where to go, so the incentives for faking are getting bigger… **It’s a very cheap way of marketing.\"***- Bing Liu, Professor at University of Illinois\n\nIn the internet age, reviews have very much become a form of marketing and has evolved into an enormous business: [reputation management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_management). Companies need reputations, and reputations come from people, unless you can buy them for cheaper than an ad campaign.\n\n**The Consequences of Access**\n\nWe expect that changes in* access *that occurred as a result of the rise of the internet had a significant effect on the trust in and accuracy of opinions. Access in this case refers to both the ability for anyone to rate products/ services/ content and the ease at which one can see more ratings online.\n\nWhen online review forums first emerged, they provided increasingly accurate opinions because of the “[wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)” effect taking hold. In James Surowiecki’s *The Wisdom of Crowds*, the famed journalist talks about bad intuitions around individual vs. group decision-making. These initial communities were small, and natural reputation effects among members existed because many knew each other by name. As misconceptions about the internet dissipated, trust in these reviews grew because they were in fact more accurate. But as access continued to increase and platforms changed, the natural reputation effects shrunk. This decreased the reputation at stake for each user and allowed for fake reviews to thrive, reducing accuracy significantly. Now, there is still a correlation between accuracy and trust; more accuracy leads to more trust, BUT more trust doesn’t necessarily lead to more accuracy. In fact, the more trust users have in online reviews the more worthwhile they are to fake/manipulate, creating a harmful equilibrium: **more accuracy → more trust → less accuracy → less trust → more accuracy … **I talk about this further in my piece [*“Opinion Economy”*](https://www.blog.yup.io/post/the-opinion-economy).\n\nWhile public metrics of social approval are not the only way to attribute this form of social capital to an identity, it is a very important one, so the removal of those metrics is to the detriment of the establishment of internet identities. The obscuring of relative signaling by removing public likes, like Instagram plans on doing, can be massively harmful to the structure of the society because it takes this information (and therefore power) away from the viewers.\n\n**Experts**\n\n*The notion that all opinions are created equal online is a large reason for the inaccuracy of opinions.*\n\nPeople like to trust brands and institutions as experts on a certain subject. In reality, however, they rarely are the experts we expect them to be. This is first because finding experts is a skill of its own, which can be flawed and time-consuming. As there are more sources, statistics, data points, and faux expertise, it becomes increasingly difficult to spot experts. Surowiecki expands on this point: “The problem is that even if these superior beings, do exist, there is no easy way to identify them.” This is also true for the experts themselves, who also may not be aware that they are experts. In fact, those within a crowd that project themselves as experts rarely are.\n\nClaiming individual humans know less than they’ve ever known, Yuval Noah Harari breaks down the impact of power and technology on our individual knowledge in his book [**21 Lessons for the 21st Century**](https://philosophiatopics.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/yuval-noah-harari-21-lessons-for-the-21st-century.pdf). He explains that humans are even less aware of their cognitive blindspots today than ever before. Because Google gives us an answer to any question, we think we’re experts and have a difficult time identifying our skills and shortcomings.\n\n[***Roll***](http://tryroll.com/) seeks to tokenize influencers, aligning curators with the specific growth of creators and influencers rather than that of the network. The financial success of curators in this case is determined by the speculative trading of influencer assets. This has serious problems in enforcement but projects some key insights about influence online. This is a way to determine experts, but not in their original form, but wholly in influence, expertise, and attention.\n\nYup attempts to prioritize reputation-based social consensus over brands and institutions. When conceiving of Yup, we used advances in distributed systems to explore new ways to (1) improve the user’s ability to identify inaccuracies, (2) deter the manipulation/misuse of reviews, and (3) correctly weight reviewers’ expertise on certain topics, communities could reach a perfect correlation between changes in trust and accuracy. Yup utilizes layered social level consensus to build sustainable governance of its network and provide proper representation of network value. This orders participants by their recognized social level. Every address on the network will have a social level as a measurement of others’ opinions of them. Their individual social levels will be determined by all other addresses on the network.\n\n**Testimonials**\n\n**Testimonials **have long been an example of quality signal vehicles for identifying the quality or reputation of a product or service. People tend Recently, as expected, individuals have found ways to manipulate and mislead testimonials as well. The most humorous example of false testimonials that we’ve come across is the one highlighted by YouTuber Coffeezilla in his [*Fake Guru video on Sam Ovens*](https://youtu.be/ez8yKklc1lE?t=150) (‘fake gurus’ are defined as online personalities that falsely sell themselves as business gurus). In this hilarious video, Coffeezilla discovers that Sam Ovens’ top testimonial, Dave Rogenmoser, actually had been making seemingly fake testimonials for dozens of ‘fake gurus’ during a 2 year span and may have been a fake guru himself. This epitomizes both the weight viewers give to online testimonials and their potential for misuse and manipulation.\n\n**Attempts at Reputation**\n\nSites whose main function is reviews have taken stronger actions to represent reputation in opinions. **Yelp** attempts to show a user’s reputation by reflecting the votes others have given on their reviews (as well as some other stats). The advantage of this portrayal of reputation is that it allows users to vet reviewers as ‘legitimate,’ mostly negative or positive in their reviews, or as having tendencies to act a certain way. The main problem with these metrics is that they don’t provide information or expertise; if a user is funny, how does that make them a better reviewer of bars? Sure, if you dig deep enough, you can start to infer certain things like that a reviewer’s past opinions on car mechanics may be strongly supported by the community or that their reviews on hardware stores are thought to be useless. But the search costs for doing this for every reviewer are far too high right now.\n\nLastly, this representation of reputation doesn’t affect the weighting of stars for a business. You could have a good rep on Yelp and still have the same influence over average ratings as any other user.\n\nBy making everyone equal, no one can be discovered as an expert. **What we must realize is that opinions aren’t democracies;** we shouldn’t all get an equal say as to the subjective quality of products, venues, or anything else for that matter. What we need is more of a meritocracy, because some of us have earned the right to speak on certain topics with authority, not necessarily through a college degree or an award but could simply be receiving the continued approval of the online community. This one-person-one-vote model just doesn’t make sense for diverse decision-making, because it doesn’t distribute accurate weight to the expertise of various participants.\n\n**Scarcity and Stake**\n\nStrong opinion models should provide major incentives for accurate reviews. If users were rewarded (monetarily or otherwise) for reviewing things, they’d take the time to make better decisions. One way of doing this is by P2P validation, meaning that if other users agree with a user’s opinion, either by upvoting their opinion or by submitting a similar review, that user should get rewarded. Yup identifies content and distributes rewards according to the value (influence) of the opinions associated with that content. In this case, we define *content* as any specific data online that user(s) deem worth judging, including but not limited to texts, images, videos, locations, accounts, and links. The influence metric is a function of engagement, ownership over time, and reputation. In Yup’s case, the final important piece here is scarcity: users should have a limited amount of reviews that they can give within a set amount of time. If users stand to gain or lose from their reviews, and they can only give their opinion x times a day, they’re less likely to abuse or waste these reviews.\n\nOn the opposite side of incentive is deterrence; users should be deterred from submitting inaccurate reviews. This could be enacted in a similar fashion, whereby users lose something for giving bad reviews that no one agrees with or supports. With Yup, this comes in the opportunity cost of giving an opinion elsewhere, where users may miss the opportunity to see returns if they vote inaccurately.\n\nSimilar concepts has been attempted in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space with the *Token Curated Registries*: lists of similar products/content/etc. that are curated by staking cryptocoins. This can be perceived as ‘betting’ that a product will be liked by others and they’ll also vote for it. If others also bet on it, you receive a token reward, if no one does, you lose your stake. In many of those systems, earning tokens and purchasing tokens holds the same value, despite there being no evidence that this is the right way to represent network participation.\n\n## Governance\n\nIn *Culture and Power: The Sociology of Pierre Bourdieu*, David Swartz begins with “Culture provides the very grounds for human communication and interaction; it is also a source of domination.” The same could be stated about the online behemoths that presently host our culture. While traditional social networks have expanded the size and function of communication, marketing, and organization, their monopolistic increase in internet market power has drawn a wide divide in incentives between their services and their user base. While there are forces that compel large networks to comply to certain restrictions, the implications of the extent of their hold over human behavior is concerning. For example, in 2010, Facebook ran [*a stealth experiment*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22972300) on 61,000,000 American accounts during the US congressional elections to see how small messages (banners above the news feed) could affect user’s voter turnout and more. They argue: “The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking, and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users’ friends, and friends of friends.”\n\nTheir results suggest that “Facebook social message increased turnout directly by about 60,000 voters and indirectly through social contagion by another 280,000 voters.” That 340,000 total represents about 0.14% of the country’s voting age population in 2010. For context, George Bush beat Al Gore in Florida by 537 votes in 2000. If a similar tight race occurred today, it wouldn’t be hyperbole to assume that Facebook could alter the political landscape of the United States with their [*4x user growth*](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/) and multi-billion dollar acquisitions since 2010.\n\nFacebook ran the voting experiment in 2010 but only made the results public in 2012 under their free will. If they had maliciously kept this study internal, the U.S. public and government may not have ever been aware. Second, because of Facebook’s immense network effects, the Cambridge Analytica data breach had little to no impact on its market dominance. Despite exposing over 80 million users’ information to third parties, resulting in trust in Facebook falling by over 50% in the following weeks, daily active users, minutes of usage, and advertising revenue all increased. This suggests that not only can giant social networks hide their manipulation, but also that average users are too network-dependent for their sentiment to be notably reflected in Facebook’s economics. Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes makes this same argument, arguing for the breaking up of Facebook into smaller companies in his famous *New York Times* piece “[*It’s Time to Break Up Facebook*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html)”. He writes that “Mark’s influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government.” At the helm of FB, Instagram, and WhatsApp, he argues that Zuckerberg has too much control. Despite being a publicly traded company, “Facebook’s board works more like an advisory committee than an overseer, because Mark controls around 60 percent of voting shares,” he writes. “Mark alone can decide how to configure Facebook’s algorithms to determine what people see in their News Feeds, what privacy settings they can use and even which messages get delivered. He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent and incendiary speech from the merely offensive, and he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it.”\n\n**Decentralization**\n\nThe benefits of decentralization have been highlighted thus far in this piece. However, decentralized protocols present their own issues such as bribing, collusion, and tragedy of the commons. Just like in their centralized counterparts, if a positive rating is worth more to a marketer than the money lost in achieving that rating on one of these platforms, they’ll surely try to manipulate it. This is entirely possible considering that users will probably not stake too much on one individual rating, especially if there aren’t that many participants. Except now, policing this must be governed democratically, making it more difficult at times. We all have heard of the [*PTSD that some Facebook moderators*](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa) have received from doing this kind of work…\n\n### First Layer Governance\n\nAt the consensus layer, there are several inefficiencies that can be improved upon with social capital. Nakamoto consensus uses proof-of-work to cleanly solve several issues in majority decision making, abandoning the notion of “one-IP-one-vote” for “one-CPU-one-vote”. However, one problem that arises as a result is the power ascribed to outsourced physical capital. Participants can gain more influence over the network by purchasing computational power with money from other economic systems. This means that the relationship between capital spent to maintain the network and the capital earned for doing so is not quite internal: 1 kW of electricity purchased with USD has equal power over the Bitcoin network as 1 kW purchased with BTC. PoS and DPoS mechanisms improve on this problem by requiring miners to stake network tokens to participate in consensus (‘one-token-one-vote’). Yet, it still does not properly reflect network participation: staking 1 network token that was purchased on an exchange provides the same mining power as 1 network token earned via mining. This dependence on physical capital makes networks susceptible to byzantine behavior from capital-rich outside parties as well as hinders the most-mover-advantages of participating in consensus. The ability to transparently quantify and represent social capital can provide stronger models for decentralized systems. Governed by an influence metric, the Yup protocol aggregates reputations, distributes opinion-based rewards, and facilitates fair ad exchange, resulting in clear, transparent consensus around social capital. It uses social level consensus to bring about anonymous P2P review and a money-resistant reputation scheme. This can be extremely helpful in solving some of the issues around protocol governance, particularly PoS and DAOs.\n\n## The Overweb, A Platform Agnostic Future\n\nBecause of the data silos laid out in the previous sections above, it may be likely that the open social protocol of the future will be platform agnostic and have overweb capabilities. Overweb is a term coined to describe software that is used to enhance one’s experience across the web rather than on one specific site or platform. The notion of platform-agnostic protocols is very well described by Mike Masnick in his piece \"[*Protocols, not Platforms*](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech)\".\n\n[***Klout***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klout) may be a great social example of overweb. Klout was a website and mobile app launched in 2008 that used social media analytics to rate its users according to online social influence via the \"Klout Score\". In determining the user score, Klout measured the size of a user's social media network and correlated the content created to measure how other users interact with that content.\n\nKlout used Bing, Facebook, Foursquare, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, and Wikipedia data to create Klout user profiles that were assigned a unique \"Klout Score\". Ultimately, Lithium Technologies, who acquired the site in 2014, closed the service in 2018. The largest reason for Klout’s failure, we propose, it’s lack of access to proprietary data of individual users on these other platforms. When Yup is attempting to aggregate influence across the web in this similar way, it is crucial that it exist atop a decentralized protocol such as the Yup protocol. Otherwise, it would quickly become difficult to integrate with any other site.\n\n### Status at Stake\n\nIn a platform where opinions are perfectly weighted and distributed, reviews would be more accurate. Investment in malicious marketing would be deterred. The distortion of customer reviews would be difficult. Cash would flow towards improving product quality + retaining users, rather than used to bolster the fraudulent image of a popular, well-liked company. However, accomplishing this in a fair and peer-to-peer manner is difficult without some decentralized consensus, which we’ll discuss below.\n\n## Data Legibility\n\n> *\"Those who cannot perceive the network cannot act effectively within it, and are powerless.\" - *[James Bridle](http://booktwo.org/notebook/drone-shadows/)\n\nPeople often talk about data transparency, but what about [data legibility](https://medium.com/doteveryone/data-legibility-and-a-common-language-coping-not-coding-part-2-8afb687de60)? Even if users have access to enough data on particular products, services, or the reviewers of them, rarely is that information fully comprehensible by the average user. The easier data is to understand and leverage to make better decisions, the more difficult it becomes to manipulate opinions and ratings. For example, review site Yelp could easily determine a score for a reviewer in different categories of rating. Reviewers could theoretically be given a high score for their reviews on mechanics while a low score for their reviews on bars, and have this be shown to the users directly from the venue page where the review was. By doing this, sites like Yelp can put more power into the hands of the users with the same data that is currently displayed on them.\n\n## Concerns & Liabilities\n\nIt’s important to consider ethical externalities and relevant responsibilities that a social protocol takes on. This is of extremely high priority for us at Yup. In the process of building, we're paying very close attention to these concerns. That being said, we feel that some of people's discomfort with our propositions are misguided and are worth discussing.\n\n### The Stigma of Social Scores\n\nSome initial users of our beta have stated that the implications of a reputation score lends a discomfort reminiscent of Black Mirror’s “Nosedive.” Some of the terminology that we use at Yup, such as “social value” or “influence” concerns people. [*Some writers*](https://bwog.com/2019/10/an-explanation-of-those-colored-underlines-around-campus/) have even stated that “the extension itself contains some indelibly frosty sense of robotic apathy, rendered void of human subtlety and liveliness.” What we hope people will come to understand is that Black Mirror is already the status quo, our social value is already objectified by social media companies that maintain their own internal rankings and assessments based on our online interactions. The problem is that we don't have access to the data and social value metrics that existing social media sites aggregate about us, users are disenfranchised in the status quo.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUltimately, a new social consensus protocol needs to sufficiently encompass many of these solutions: opt-in data autonomy, overweb reputation layer, and more. Our goal as a team is to explore what this may look like from the eyes of prioritizing individual merit in the face of data-driven networks. We’re looking for other teams to collaborate with and grow together. We’re big believers in procedural justice, encouraging and empowering our initial community to take part in determining what is valued and prioritized on Yup.\n\nWe envision Yup as a protocol for an incentivized, distributed, and censorship-resistant social systems that provides trustless data rights. The potential use cases of the protocol are infinite, and we foresee Yup as a foundation for new and separate applications that benefit from its unique qualities.

With more focus on NFTs, the mere fact that digital artists can make a living out of JUST doing things digitally is amazing to me. No need to print your digital works as stickers, prints, posters, etc. Blockchain technology made it possible for one specific file to be called THE official one.

Always remember to check whether the wallet and the platform you're minting on are on the same blockchain network.*\n\n-----\n\n### How did I find out about NFTs, Web3, and stuff\nBefore I share how I got to mint my first NFT, let me share how the fuck did I get in to this wild world of crypto and Web3.\n\nI don't recall exactly how, but I'm sure it's because of how [RAC](https://twitter.com/rac) — a Grammy-award winning producer — has back-to-back projects happening in the space. I think this was around October 2020, but I'd like to assume I've heard of these even earlier.\n\nFrom NFTs, the super wild [$TAPE](https://zora.co/rac/tape) project — a token representing a physical cassette tape, — to issuing his own social token, [$RAC](https://blog.ourzora.com/introducing-rac), where token holders can have access to a private area in his Discord server, get discounts to merch, or even get to interact with him more.\n\nI also was introduced to Audius because of one stream he did on Twitch! [Audius](https://audius.co/feed) is like Soundcloud, except you (the artist) have a say on what happens to the platform. You want to have a subscription feature? Vote using the tokens given to you every time you post! **The platform's future is in the artists' hands.**\n\nAll these projects were so fascinating to see. With more focus on NFTs, the mere fact that digital artists can make a living out of JUST doing things digitally is amazing to me. No need to print your digital works as stickers, prints, posters, etc. Blockchain technology made it possible for one specific file to be called THE official one. Because of that, all the other copies scattered around the internet, and the ones to be made by saving a copy of the same file, are worthless. **The original file gets value.**\n\n### How I was able to mint my first NFT\n\nMinting (*making*) an NFT can cost around US$40-$100 in gas (*transaction*) fees on a good day, and a disgusting $400-$800 on a bad one (although why would you mint during a bad day, lol). Gas fees don’t go to the platform, but rather the people running the whole Ethereum network.\n\nIn the Philippines, $40 is already 10+% of what an entry level employee is making monthly, while $100 is like 1/3 of the same salary. **Anyway, bottomline, it's just so fucking expensive for people here.**\n\n![Sees how much I need to mint an NFT](https://media.giphy.com/media/Y4JE51QwzefMLfknfq/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\n***UPDATE:** Gas fees have chilled tf down lately, so minting an NFT is less expensive now. That doesn't mean that the big price range mentioned won't be possible again sooner or later, unless Ethereum 2.0 has been released.*\n\nI honestly considered saving up for a mint fund, in hopes that I can get my money back and more. That doesn't mean I'm just here for the money. I'm also here for people to validate that my work has value, maybe even greater than what I would've expected.\n\nPosting on Instagram and Twitter, getting likes for my posts, and I can't make a living out of it because all the money goes to the platforms?! **I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THIS LOGIC AFTER KNOWING ABOUT NFTs.** Did I mention that if your NFT is resold in the secondary market, you get a cut of the resale???!!!\n\nThen, while I was looking around the Creator x Crypto side of Twitter, I discovered Mint Fund.\n\n[Mint Fund](https://twitter.com/themintfund) is a community project that helps artists in being able to mint their first NFT by giving a grant that's enough to cover for gas fees. **They prioritize funds to BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ artists especially outside North America and Europe.** They are also working on great projects for the space like making a crowdfund for an open-source protocol.\n\nI signed up for the grant a week after they launched, but sadly didn't get in the first batch. It just meant that I was still on the waitlist! I got an email around mid or late April saying that I got in the second batch. GURL, I WAS SHOOKT. I SAW THE EMAIL WHEN I WOKE UP. Now THAT's how you start a good day!\n\n![Walking out of my bedroom after seeing the email](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT1R9ZbWoZgo0leM5G/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\n***Side Note:** For artists in South East Asia, you might also want to apply at [First Mint Fund](https://twitter.com/firstmintfund)! It's another community project giving grants to artists so that they can mint their first NFT.*\n\n### Minting process\n\nY'all... minting an NFT is ***EASY AS FUUUUUUUCK.*** Uploaded the file, entered some details, clicked \"Proceed\", set up a price, and I'm done. No complicated shit!\n\nBut if you're starting from nowhere, you should get an Ethereum wallet (like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)) first, AND WRITE THAT SEED PHRASE DOWN (YES, THE 12 RANDOM WORDS). The seed phrase is like the ultimate password. Lose it, lose everything in your wallet.\n\nNow with that wallet, you can start connecting it to platforms like Zora, Rarible, Foundation, and more. If the platform is open to the public to mint on it, then go ahead!\n\nFor NFT platforms on the Tezos blockchain, like *hic et nunc* and Kalamint, I think Temple is one of the most used wallets there.\n\nAgain, EZ SHIT! But I do understand that it can get, or it looks overwhelming. If that's the case, just shoot me a DM on Twitter ([@belgiangwaffles](https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles))! I'll be happy to help you out. 😊\n\n### And here it is...\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3003)\n\n[Read about the concept and what minting an NFT means to me in this post.](https://gianferrer.mirror.xyz/faYgip4c1BwVbr0UvuVE3Oae2OaKCmlmOxBIgrxFcZc)\n*You also might wanna... you know... make a bid or sumn...* 🥺👉👈\n\n### Zora as my chosen platform\n\nI chose [Zora](https://zora.co/) as the platform where I'll mint my first NFT for various reasons.\n- I feel like it's not as saturated as other open platforms.\n- They don't get a cut from my sale.\n- I have the option to not have a timed auction being started when somebody bids with my asking price.\n\n    I just feel like that it hypes the price more than the artwork itself, which I don't want to be the case. Also, I want to be able to pick who gets my piece, and not just someone because it was automated. The owner is as important as the piece, IMO.\n\n- Also, from my understanding, I can sell the same NFT on other platforms with the creator share still attached to it, so I am not stuck with Zora.\n\n    I have to verify if I understood this correctly. 💀\n\n- Lastly, I don't want to set my asking price with ETH. Speaking of...\n\n### Fun Fact: I'm not selling it for money.\n\n~~Now this, I think, is what the locals don't know, especially the outsiders hating on all of this, lmao.~~ Depending on where you mint your NFT, you can choose to sell your works NOT for money — ETH, or stablecoins (crypto that will forever be worth $1) like DAI or USDT — but for social tokens.\n\n![Yes. I'm not asking for money.](https://media.giphy.com/media/SXeezvYc8uRUc/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\nRemember the $RAC token I was talking about earlier? I'm asking for something like that.\n\nIt's like exchanging a print, postcard, painting, whatever, for access to someone's Netflix account for a period of time, or live in the buyer's house for a month. Sure, these things have monetary value, and so does social tokens, but I'm not interested in that.\n\nMy asking price is **60 $FWB** ([Friends with Benefits](https://fwb.help/)) which is enough for me to enter the FWB Discord server and apply to be a member (as of writing). The membership, for me, is a way to widen my network especially with fellow creators in the crypto space. I want to get to know more people, see what kind of crazy projects they're up to, learn from them, exchange ideas, and maybe just chill with them as well. That's what I wish to get in exchange for my NFT.\n\nActually, you can swap your crypto to FWB. My asking price could've been the ETH or DAI equivalent of 60 FWB, but I think that's an easier route. For me, it means way more if someone from FWB sees my work and actually bids on it with their FWB tokens. It's like a cosign from a member, **legitimizing that I SHOULD be with them.**\n\n***UPDATE:** My second NFT, \"[Shoot Your Shot](https://zora.co/gianferrer/3328)\", has been sold for 75 FWB Pro. That's enough for me to enter the community. Thank you, King [Coopah](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa)!*\n\n*The asking price for \"Spectrum\" is now 0.1 ETH, but I will still accept offers in $FWB, $FF, $ROBOT, $AUDIO, $RAC, $YUP, or stablecoins (USDC or DAI).*\n\n### What's next?\n\n~~Win the fuckin’ $WRITE Race!!!~~\n\nMy next goal is to join a social token community or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)!

The People side of crypto is where the fun is all at.\n\nI already got some $FF by [Forefront](https://forefront.market/).

{"id": "wfr9QxVvB1LcrLfidi8E5JKk8C4aeeOhuDyjLkVLSSQ", "title": "NFT Games", "body": "*Part of [a series](https://air.mirror.xyz/) on using NFTs to fund publishing, using the [daily newsletter Dirt](https://dirt.substack.com) as an experiment.*\n\nThe accurate joke about Bitcoin is that you would never use it to buy a pizza, because a pizza could cost $20 one day and $200,000 the next. There's this enduring perception (self-inflicted) that cryptocurrency is just that, currency, and it should be used to buy and sell normal things like pizza and illegal drugs — that those transactions are its primary use case. But we've seen Bitcoin move into its role as digital gold — a store of longterm value — and other currencies like Dogecoin act more like penny stocks than anything functional. You might make money treating it like an asset, but there is no fundamental basis for its value. \n\nEthereum presents a different function, a different value system, and different relationships to its holders, as Joe Weisenthal [observed in Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-07/bitcoin-btc-vs-ethereum-eth-and-defi-there-s-a-big-difference). Ethereum (*not gonna use 'Ether' for the currency lol*) can be a pass into new digital spaces, like a train ticket or a Euro for the internet, the common currency of multiple platforms. And NFTs act as a more comprehensible version of the value of Ethereum. Instead of the currency, you have an object that you own. That object is what's traded back and forth, what's exchanged to create new relationships among its holders. NFTs have a fundamental logic that a wider userbase can grasp: they are *stuff*. \n\nNFTs can become a form of currency of their own, as a kind of in-game currency or membership ticket for particular projects. The impetus to collect NFTs is clear enough — you hold it in your wallet, you enjoy looking at it, you show it off. But the next level up from that is enabling users to play games with their NFTs, making them interactive and dynamic instead of static collected objects. Games give NFTs a sense of personality, a sense of meaning, and, most importantly, a sense of fun. When you can play with a NFT, it acquires more meaning. \n\nWhat's an NFT game? The investment stepladder, buying low and selling high, is already a kind of NFT game (like flipping NFT avatars). But there's little impetus for many people to participate in the secondary market for many holders except FOMO and the desire for a low price. My newsletter, Dirt, for example, has many collectors of its NFTs, but [no action on the secondary market](https://opensea.io/assets?search%5Bquery%5D=dirty%20s1&search%5BsortAscending%5D=false&search%5BsortBy%5D=LISTING_DATE), because there's no way to know what the sold-out NFTs are now worth. The community is not yet active enough in the NFT space to sustain trading or flipping. \n\nThe more interesting examples are when you can play your own games with NFTs you own, without relying on market action: [Universe.xyz's Polymorphs](https://medium.com/universe-xyz/polymorphic-universe-8470e14629b4) let you remix your own NFTs for a fee. [Misfit University](https://www.misfit.university/) uses the particular design of your NFT to determine a \"club\" that you're in — a faction-within-a-faction that brings users together (though that project faded quickly due to problematic art assets). Bored Ape Yacht Club gave all their holders the chance to [get a dog](https://twitter.com/boredapeyc/status/1406008682006069248?lang=en) alongside their ape. [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) and [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) are actual games played with NFTs, like a MMORPG or card game.\n\n## Possible NFT Games for Media Companies\n\nI wrote before about [how media companies can incorporate NFTs](https://air.mirror.xyz/bTAwqOAe2vG6UIq5KSPrEho_VbrfDxcswm0ZuUtPGAc) as a business model, building a context around them rather than just releasing articles or covers as NFTs. Media companies also need to make their NFTs interactive and cultivate engagement with them apart from article / editorial content. Here are some possibilities:\n\n> Trading your themed NFTs with other people in that community\n\n> Pre-existing NFT holders get new NFTs\n\n> Remixing or customizing the design of your NFT, like Polymorphs or Blitmap  \n\n> Combining multiple NFTs into new designs, or NFT / display designs change based on what else you own\n\n> NFT unlocks a new space online, like a Discord or newsletter (using NFTs as a subscription or a paywall, even beyond a regular paywall)\n\n> Increasing or decreasing the rarity of your NFT, in the sense of upgrading or downgrading it\n\n> Destroying your NFTs by burning them, which also influences the community at large by decreasing supply  \n\n> Being able to display your own NFTs within or alongside the editorial content of the publication\n\n> Altering the design / presentation of the publication based on which NFTs you own\n\n> Join different 'teams' of readers / subscribers of the publication, buying avatar-style NFTs to reflect some kind of allegiance or philosophy\n\n## Feelings on Dirt NFT Collecting \n\nThese thoughts come from the outcome of the [Dirt NFT launch](https://air.mirror.xyz/lmV9Dxeos9HvKSu0BKY9pqARK2vAlPXhrNMt68E4GkI). We sold 131 NFTs very successfully, but it's hard to know how to activate that community after launch: Our $DIRTS1 token exists and unites holders, but so far we haven't used that channel because we haven't launched new NFTs. There also aren't good ways for collectors to communicate with each other, short of a Discord, which I often feel is too real-time for most casual users. (Our [collector survey](https://forms.gle/eQxZj4g5AMSwe17D8) also found that buyers may care more about tokens than actual NFTs.)\n\nI own a Dirty Pea Green NFT, but I can't do anything with it; I can't participate in the Dirt ecosystem except for reading the newsletter. Ideally, the NFT ownership would immediately give me access to something new: posts or newsletters just for holders and community chats, but also the opportunity to do more with the NFTs themselves, which are their own form of Dirt content that should be just as engaging as the writing. \n\nThe feeling of owning the Pea Green NFT to me recalls things like trading Pokemon cards as a kid, having a Tamagotchi, buying a nice or rare book, and playing a very slow MMORPG. Accordingly, the NFT activations should follow the theme of these nostalgic, often digital experiences. Ultimately, NFTs need to exist socially, and socially by default (instead of having to list them on Opensea, for example). At the same time, for media companies, they have to be inextricable from the content of the publishing side. So the publishing side needs to tell the stories of the NFTs, highlight collector interaction, and drive the expansion of the NFT universe.   \n\n## Proposal \n\nIn order to create activation for the Dirt NFTs, we'll launch another NFT that requires the ownership of the previous NFTs — like a Kickstarter project where only the previous backers get access. \n\nThe new NFT will try to encourage the secondary market for Dirt NFTs, since pre-existing owners will have an easier time acquiring the multiples needed for the new one. The new NFT will also be rarer, lower-edition than the previous ones. \n\nThis trade will be like upgrading your previous NFTs and getting bonus content from Dirt. We want to encourage deeper engagement from our pre-existing collectors just as much as trying to attract new collectors. Dirt's internal stash of $DIRT-S1 tokens can also be used as prizes to encourage people to complete the quest of getting the new NFT (Dirt still holds 25%).\n\n## Problems\n\n> Collectors need to put their NFTs on Opensea so others can buy them; new NFT collectors don't know much about Opensea or about the possibility of selling their NFTs. \n\n> Communication is still difficult because there's no centralized platform to reach the collectors. The newsletter itself is a great communication vehicle but not all collectors read the actual newsletter. \n\n> The impetus to acquire the new NFT is basically art-driven: collectors will want it because the art is cool or because they want to own the full set of NFTs. \n\n> The relationship of the new NFT to the pre-existing collectors or token holders is unclear; they will have first and easiest access to the art but that is the principal reward. Since the new NFT may not be for sale, only trade, there may not be ETH to distribute.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4fd5557c-f927-4dc4-89c6-9a38499427a9.jpg?height=226&width=244)\n\n", "timestamp": 1625935905, "digest": "k3hkZRapDZNc0VaDFfup_PgaMO6U4gYLw2D_BLqdbFk", "contributor": "0x25cbCFA16e43e58517f80D583087Ea89241293E6"}

Ideally, the NFT ownership would immediately give me access to something new: posts or newsletters just for holders and community chats, but also the opportunity to do more with the NFTs themselves, which are their own form of Dirt content that should be just as engaging as the writing. \n\nThe feeling of owning the Pea Green NFT to me recalls things like trading Pokemon cards as a kid, having a Tamagotchi, buying a nice or rare book, and playing a very slow MMORPG. Accordingly, the NFT activations should follow the theme of these nostalgic, often digital experiences. Ultimately, NFTs need to exist socially, and socially by default (instead of having to list them on Opensea, for example). At the same time, for media companies, they have to be inextricable from the content of the publishing side. So the publishing side needs to tell the stories of the NFTs, highlight collector interaction, and drive the expansion of the NFT universe.   \n\n## Proposal \n\nIn order to create activation for the Dirt NFTs, we'll launch another NFT that requires the ownership of the previous NFTs — like a Kickstarter project where only the previous backers get access. \n\nThe new NFT will try to encourage the secondary market for Dirt NFTs, since pre-existing owners will have an easier time acquiring the multiples needed for the new one. The new NFT will also be rarer, lower-edition than the previous ones. \n\nThis trade will be like upgrading your previous NFTs and getting bonus content from Dirt. We want to encourage deeper engagement from our pre-existing collectors just as much as trying to attract new collectors. Dirt's internal stash of $DIRT-S1 tokens can also be used as prizes to encourage people to complete the quest of getting the new NFT (Dirt still holds 25%).\n\n## Problems\n\n> Collectors need to put their NFTs on Opensea so others can buy them; new NFT collectors don't know much about Opensea or about the possibility of selling their NFTs. \n\n> Communication is still difficult because there's no centralized platform to reach the collectors. The newsletter itself is a great communication vehicle but not all collectors read the actual newsletter. \n\n> The impetus to acquire the new NFT is basically art-driven: collectors will want it because the art is cool or because they want to own the full set of NFTs. \n\n> The relationship of the new NFT to the pre-existing collectors or token holders is unclear; they will have first and easiest access to the art but that is the principal reward. Since the new NFT may not be for sale, only trade, there may not be ETH to distribute.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4fd5557c-f927-4dc4-89c6-9a38499427a9.jpg?height=226&width=244)\n\n", "timestamp": 1625936994, "digest": "k3hkZRapDZNc0VaDFfup_PgaMO6U4gYLw2D_BLqdbFk", "contributor": "0x25cbCFA16e43e58517f80D583087Ea89241293E6"}
{"id": "cWDQFyGjFAF_JAGdO9KeVgBIVqfot_sgUkpgEqeqPX8", "title": "Sketch for a NFT-based media company", "body": "## **The Brand**\n\nThe publication is voice-driven digital content that inspires loyalty in readers: arriving every day, reaching them where they are, communicating about things they need to know about or identify with closely. The publication serves a self-selecting demographic of cultural consumers who are obsessive, and either need or want to know about the content. \n\nThe brand needs to be specific and identifiable, standing out in the media landscape of heritage brands, somewhat interchangeable newsletters, and voices on Twitter. It has to be distinct, recognizable from only a few elements wherever it is found. The editorial voice is part of that brand, but it also must be (audio)visual. (\"Content\" is not solely writing, or even information.)\n\n## **The Format** \n\nNewsletters deliver longform content and close relationships with writers. The real-time delivery is also useful, but closer to real-time can be found on Twitter. More intimacy can be found in podcasts or tight communities online, the interactive fandoms of organizations like Chapo Trap House or $FWB. The publication must prioritize its community of consumers by giving them intimacy with the creators and with the brand, less a newspaper or information service than a space in which to participate, feeling nonhierarchical. It needs a sense of [digital belonging](https://air.mirror.xyz/5A16bvvS2IJK7fVVNb2GwrrEcyey2B4UiH2l1DI_Y2I). \n\nUnlike many newsletters, the publication cannot be tied to a singular voice because that voice is not its only value proposition. Many contributors should participate in the brand and want to be a part of it, as creators and consumers. The identity of both writing for and reading the publication should be aspirational. For that quality, the publication also has to be relatively visual, able to function as a marker for itself, like the provenance label on a bottle of wine — *[Denominazione di Origine Controllata](https://italianwine.guide/about-italian-wine/wine-law/doc-en-gb/)* of content.\n\n## **The Structure**\n\nThe staff of the publication can be low-weight at first, with one editor, one or several staff writers, an array of freelance contributors, and contributing artists and designers for visual content, which is given equal priority to textual content, creating a framework. Content is delivered in whichever formats the audience grows to prefer, from text to audio to graphics. \n\nWhat matters more than the platform the content is delivered on is its ability to stay consistent, always calling back to the voice and community of the publication. Like a cryptocurrency, it should be able to stay itself wherever it goes or whoever is consuming it. This is not the decentralization of mainstream publications posting links on Facebook; it's the decentralization of file piracy or crypto mining. \n\nThe publication is not a magazine but an architectural structure, an art gallery, a fashion brand, a sports team, a video game, a flower that blooms at a specific time — something you inhabit and watch evolve. \n\n## **The Business Model**\n\nThe publication is funded by NFTs and social tokens. NFTs require specific relationships and consumers to function: A small number of NFTs need to attract high-value buyers or a large number of NFTs (expensive to mint) need to attract mid-value buyers in order to sustain an entire publication, paying for staff and freelancers. \n\nWhat makes NFTs valuable is provenance: in the case of visual art, the artist is credible and the art is compelling, or, in the case of [a novel](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), the author's previous work and novel proposal is compelling. What would make publication NFTs compelling is strong art, a connection to the brand (provenance), and context, building a coherent body of NFT production that functions alongside and through the publication. It's important that the NFTs have a logic just as the editorial has a logic. \n\nSocial tokens ($PUBLICATION) can raise money for a publication or fund new efforts, giving holders a proxy for equity in the overall project that exists more on the back-end. NFTs can monetize social tokens for the holders and give readers / consumers a way to interact with the brand, as well as to participate in its economics. The NFTs have to be desirable in a variety of ways, both as high-end patronage and as casual affiliation, like New Yorker tote bags. \n\nThe NFTs are not iterations of the text content, or symbolic of the content (a la the [New York Times column](https://foundation.app/kevinroose/the-new-york-times-x-nft-13129)), but are a form of content in themselves. Think of a publication that is inextricable from and funded by a marketplace of NFTs like Cryptopunks, where the publication is the only authority that can create more. The action of the marketplace would generate enough returns to run the publication, which would in turn produce more, and attract more demand for, the marketplace's NFTs. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9a9cc201-06e3-44c2-9a18-e269d89c32cb.png?height=738&width=1346)\n\nNFTs are a form of streetwear drop amenable to any content format or producer. They create fresh visual interest, scarcity, and ephemerality, functioning as rewards for those who are most engaged and invested in the brand, who can also profit in turn from their participation. \n\n## **Using NFTs**\n\n— Authoritative NFTs of branding assets can be released at the outset of the publication, in the context of crowdfunding. An initial release of NFTs could be seen as the \"original\" creations backing the project, which would become more valuable as the publication grows in stature.\n\n— More casual NFTs could take the form of annual subscriber / backer rewards and function as a kind of identification that is public-facing: If you have one, then you are seen as an early adopter of this publication (editions work well for this approach).\n\n— A set of NFTs could be produced in the form of stylized avatars only for subscribers, a la Cryptopunks or Cryptokitties. These could be abstract and sold / traded in a marketplace. \n\n— NFTs could be produced on a per-article basis, minted when the article is published and then given to the writer to sell. But that requires demand on a per-article level, which requires a lot of compelling imagery and higher levels of consumption: do they have enough symbolic value?\n\n— Ultimately, the publication itself should function as a showcase for the NFTs from that publication: Imagine profile pages or showcases, or spotlights on each article page or newsletter edition, that highlight a particular NFT and owner, or offer the NFT for sale. Like wearing streetwear, NFTs need better distribution mechanisms to drive demand and create aspiration.  \n\n— Writers can be paid in ETH, NFTs, or $PUBLICATION tokens, which are cheap to produce for the publication. (Writers or any publication contributors in media are rarely given a meaningful stake in the business of the publication.)\n\n— The NFTs should be desirable on their own as an aesthetic system, like streetwear, action figures, or art toys. The NFT aesthetic system evolves as the publication expands, like watching a houseplant grow. \n\n## **Comparisons**\n\n[Apartamento](https://www.apartamentomagazine.com/): An influential interiors magazine that emerged from a small community and created an aspirational image of a bohemian lifestyle, through well-designed, highly aesthetic print magazines and a unique photography style. \n\n[Axios](https://www.axios.com/): A newsletter company that thrives on providing very impactful content for its readers in very comprehensible units; the style of content itself is a signature for the publication. \n\n[Monocle](https://monocle.com/magazine/): A business, culture, and lifestyle magazine and 24/7 radio station that became identified with a global archetype of person, who reads and shows off the magazine. There are Monocle tote bags, clothing lines, cafes, and accessories that readers buy into as much as the magazine. \n\n[Kinfolk](https://www.kinfolk.com/): A magazine that gave readers an image of not just what to consume but how to behave ethically and morally, creating an image of an aestheticized simple life. The magazine's aesthetic spread over Instagram and other platforms to become diffuse and participatory, disconnected from the magazine itself but still branded by it. \n\n[LeanLuxe](http://leanluxe.com/): A daily-ish newsletter about D2C brands but also about the lifestyle of wealthy millennials and businesses targeting that demographic. Also takes the form of a Slack community and advertising within and to the readership, creating a collective identity.
