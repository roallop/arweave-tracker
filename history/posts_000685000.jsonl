And yet I found myself in San Francisco: supposedly the global center of innovation, caught day-to-day in the mundanity of a large corporation & doing anything but inventing.\n\nLooking around, the picture was bleak: at some point between 2011 and 2017 it felt like every exciting & scrappy early-stage startup in the Bay Area became subsumed by a corporate surveillance-technology company: every bright-eyed inventor I knew eventually spending 3 hours/day on a shuttle bus to be sad in meetings at a suburban office park.\n\nIn the world capital of invention the only things that I could see being invented were new ways to prey on attention, spread misinformation, and boost arbitrary engagement metrics for products that didn‚Äôt need to exist in the world. Technology, from my perspective, was making the world a worse place.\n\nI was at the peak of my career as a designer and technologist, and yet I was resigned to think that the future of the technology industry had been stolen by a handful of predatory corporations. Looking around at hundreds of talented & burnt out friends around the industry, it was was hard to imagine anything changing.\n\nIn that resignation, I gave up my agency as a technologist. I got up from my seat at the table, and retreated to my own physical & intellectual Walden Ponds. In lieu of any available action that matched my values, I chose to withdraw from any action at all.\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing: the technology industry is still important to me. I still believe that properly harnessing technology is the key to our future as a civilization. I still believe that it has the power to transform us: personally & communally.\n\nWith the explosion of energy & attention into this current crypto cycle, there is once against spaciousness to imagine futures divergent from the myopic dreams of the Attention Economy. It is open, and yet it is not a certainty.\n\nCrypto is a non-specific amplifier: it has the potential to create a hypercapitalist libertarian nightmare, or a mutually-beneficial interdependent utopia. One thing I do know is that the only way we can influence which outcome we get is by radically participating in its creation.\n\nThis time, the stakes of sitting on the sidelines are too high: the imagined darkest possible timeline a certainty only with our inaction. The call to adventure for every burnt out technologist is, therefore, not to surrender to the mundanity of the Silicon Valley of the past or the imagined outcomes of the future, but to bring our full attention to co-creating meaningful and human-centric digital environments that we can be proud of.\n\nMy pessimism is radically giving way to unwavering optimism: the energy of the past few days, weeks & months in crypto-powered utopian technology is shining a pure light on a path forward that we can be proud of walking together.\n\nWill you join us?\n\n---\n\nif you enjoyed this post, please consider becoming a patron of my writing by supporting this NFT\n\n[Token #3101](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3101)", "timestamp": 1620869469, "digest": "6ZUtkEg7kR2IM5sjkf74DhHvIehZ6GOfr56rE6wvAog", "contributor": "0x88D01d4354DA0D65C38b0196c4400525A5eebe17", "nft": "{\"nftTransactionHash\": \"0x1901a357914712649b2b1589964a8a228a32641957c6ea94abdcb5bb8902b03a\"}"}

Over time, as more people use the single-player tool, you then add social features such as likes, comments, follows, etc. to plant the seeds for a defensible network. \n\nToday, with the rise of creator-focused platforms, this mantra is evolving into: \"[come for the *creator*, stay for the network](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1195412859733168128).\" Creator-focused platforms realize that wherever the creator goes, the audience and attention follows. As a result, platforms bootstrap their network by attracting top creators.\n\nThe go-to-market strategy can generally be summarized as:\n\n1. Attract top creators with compelling features and / or a bag üí∞\n2. Creators bring their audience\n3.

You‚Äôve formulated an idea that feels new and important and worth writing down and sharing with others. You start pulling together key thoughts, quotes and citations. You organize them into an outline. You write. You edit. You publish. \n\nIn the old days (of last month), you‚Äôd be posting this work to a simple blog post or a newsletter. It would (hopefully) include links in the text to the sources referenced and shoutouts to those that helped inspire your ideas. The people referenced or quoted might notice. You might tag them on Twitter. They might care a little. The links would mean incremental traffic, perhaps one or two sign ups to their personal blog or newsletter. The dopamine of being referenced would be nice too. But‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it.\n\nNow, there‚Äôs a different way to create ‚Äî one that positions you to *build upon* those sources of inspiration. Instead of using links and tags, by minting your essay as an NFT, you can attribute it, socially and financially, on-chain, to the authors and articles that influenced you. Last Tuesday, the brilliant folks at Mirror introduced the notion of ‚Äòsplits.‚Äô [To use their language](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw), splits are a native feature that let you route funds continuously to an unlimited number of Ethereum addresses, according to a set of percentage allocations. Splits can be used to share the revenue generated from a sale of an NFT with any set number of collaborators. You can specify that Jonathan should get 20% and Tal should get 40% and so on until 100% of the treasury is allocated. When money comes in, it programmably flows out based on these percentages. This is all handled by the smart contract. Trustless and public.\n\nBut another way to use splits, and the more systemically significant one, is to attribute your sources of revelation. As the Mirror team put it, ‚Äúcollaboration then extends to who inspired your idea and to what extent.‚Äù In this use-case, you specify that, say, Patrick Rivera contributed 7% of the inspiration, while Packy McCormick provided 4% and Sari Azout and Jad Esber did 12%. When revenue is generated by your NFT, they automatically get their cut. \n\nSplits take behaviors that used to be purely intrinsic and status driven (social cred) and make them financially extrinsic (social + economic cred). It evolves actions and concepts which are inherently viral by pairing them with an economic incentive. When someone gets attributed to an article, even if it‚Äôs not a lot of money in her wallet, it feels good. (Packy did it for us, and it felt awesome.) And when people feel good, they tend to want to keep feeling good and make others feel good; first, by creating more content that will inspire other people. But also by, in turn, attributing the people who have inspired their work. By paying it forward, by being a good member of the community of writers, by in effect ‚Äòpaying it backward‚Äô and acknowledging what others have given them. Of course in doing so, they are more likely themselves to be attributed again.\n\nBut like any foundational change, this will not only impact the way we drive value from the finished product, but influence the creation of the product itself. Splits and other tools like them introduce a business model around the creation of content, going beyond existing methods that focus purely on post-publish production and distribution. This concept has the ability to drive a significant value change to foundational content creation because the financial flows can go much deeper than one level. This isn‚Äôt about changing surface level citations and crediting, but about fundamentally altering the entire production, ownership and funding model for digital content.\n\nOur friends from Mirror note, ‚Äúbecause crypto allows economics to route between any smart contracts, split value can flow beyond just people to entities like... NFTs.‚Äù So when you attribute Sari and Jad‚Äôs essay, any revenue you generate can flow proportionally and pool in their NFT. And if they wanted, that pool could continue to flow, according to the attribution splits they in turn determined, into the NFTs that inspired their work. Of course, the same dynamic would occur if someone created an NFT that attributed your essay. Revenue starting at the top would flow all the way down to the foundational inspirations. What used to be hyperlinks and mentions now becomes a financial structure that helps strengthen and fund an entire ecosystem. NFTs and splits have finally given hyperlinks a business model.\n\nMatt Stephenson laid it out perfectly in his recent essay, ‚ÄòHow the First Great Finding in Empirical Science Was Lost for Decades.‚Äô Focusing on the potential for cascading attribution as a funding source for basic scientific research, he called it a ‚Äò[Splitstream](https://s.mirror.xyz/vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg).‚Äô\n\n> The SplitStream is a system in which portions of an NFT sale may flow to some or all of the works the NFT cites, with those cited works then sending some of their funds further along to the works they cite, and so on.\n\n[Sari and Jad seize](https://sariazout.mirror.xyz/etHY_neWXosxDJpGOhzuwi-cB0qOvMco_iwO5yJ1Ai0) on the significance of this flow for deep foundational work--\n\n> But what if your back-catalog wasn‚Äôt stagnant, but rather an ever-evolving source of passive income? What if the value of your work was driven by the number of references and citations, and more references meant more dollars? What if the ROI of an essay that took hundreds of hours to write was orders of magnitude higher than those designed for virality or disposability?\n\nBut where does the revenue come from? How does the funding get into this proposed attribution system? What will power this new business model? Are people seriously going to buy essay-NFTs or other content NFTs like they buy Cryptopunks and Beeples?\n\nLikely not. At least not for every content format. While there have been a number of very successful sales of essay-NFTs, it‚Äôs just not a perfect fit for the medium. While very old and important books are valuable, essays don‚Äôt hold the same perceived store of value as art and collectibles. There isn‚Äôt an existing cultural tradition of selling, much less auctioning, written content in the same way. \n\nBut when we unpack the reason people are buying NFTs, we see three interconnected motivations: \n\n- **Identity**: a desire to be personally associated with a particular creation\n- **Status**: an effort to support a particular creator, and thus be included in their future works\n- **Equity**: a hope that the asset may generate profit if it increases in value\n\nAnd those motivations are relevant for every content format. So for revenue and funding of any content format, we just need to enable mechanisms that satisfy these motivations while being both ‚Äònative‚Äô and natural.\n\nFor writing, instead of outright purchasing an essay, there could be the notion of supporting the essay, of patronizing it. Suppose there are some finite number of support 'spots' for an essay. As a curator who admires an essay, I could purchase the privilege of being acknowledged as a supporter of it by embedding my name or DAOs name in the foundation of the UX. The support capital would flow into the NFT, and then out to the various splits of collaborators and attributors. In this way, I would also be the owner of my ‚Äòspot‚Äô and would be able to sell my ‚Äòspot‚Äô to someone else. I could perhaps even make a profit, as the essay‚Äôs place in the web of attribution becomes more established and better recognized.\n\nOf course, the list of essays a particular person or DAO supports would itself be a useful index and source of valuable notifications. By connecting with content in this way, the community acknowledges supporters as essential curators, establishing their reputation while providing  a venue for others to follow their selections. So splits have not only potentially created a new funding model for content but for curation as well.\n\nIsn‚Äôt there in this system an inherent ‚Äòfree rider‚Äô problem? Why wouldn‚Äôt someone read all these essays without ever paying to support one? Why wouldn‚Äôt someone writing an essay borrow ideas without ever attributing them as his or her source of inspiration? The answer is that they could. Just as someone can ‚Äòconsume‚Äô an NFT without owning one. But doing so puts that person outside the community of ideas, and less able to fully participate in its benefits. Someone who never supports is unlikely to be supported. Someone who never attributes is unlikely to be attributed. All of these actions are recorded on the blockchain, transparent and permanent. He can be a free rider, but his track record will make that obvious, just as someone who is a steady conduit for value will be known and rewarded.\n\nWhat we are really describing -- what Sari and Jad and Patrick and Brian are pointing us to -- is a composable architecture for ideas: NFT-essays building on each other, precisely as Jesse described, as [media legos](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1301673263840534528). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/691fc17f-5c33-484c-8caa-648cd8be982f.png?height=182&width=940)\n\nUnlike the current Web, where the game is capturing unwitting traffic and funneling it towards the companies paying us, this concept of composable ideas inverts that pernicious tendency. In a network of attribution, we aim to add to and acknowledge the work of others, intentionally driving economic and reputational value to instrumental work, precisely in order so that others will consider doing the same for us. In this system, we want others to build on what we have built. The result is an ever-climbing tower of creativity, where ideas flow up and gratitude flows down.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/122ce981-9847-490d-b201-83579877481d.png?height=680&width=660)\n\nNot all nodes in this architecture can be of equal influence. Some will be much more significant than others. There will be foundational content pieces that are the end-point recipients of the attributions of tens of thousands of other creations. There will be other content pieces that provide essential bridges and flows between seemingly separate topic-networks. There will be curators whose lists of proudly supported content make up the definitive canon on a particular subject and whose support funded the thinking that built a whole new field of investigation and invention. But it is an architecture that gives every individual creator a platform and culture in which their ideas can radiate if they are useful to others.\n\nSo this new graph isn‚Äôt about who you ‚Äòfriend‚Äô or follow, but who you attribute, who you support, and who inspires and supports you. Not as social gestures, but inscribed in smart contracts that deliver economic benefits. Not as traffic driven, but as credit given. Is this a relevant model for every kind of content? Probably not. Like the rest of the ownership economy, the places where these concepts will have the most impact are those domains where a specific community perceives a great deal of merit. Blockchain-based attribution is unlikely to change the business model behind an ephemeral news story, product review or TV show summary. But it is also possible that it changes the way those markets can be served. In addition to the competitive scrambling to be the first and most viral Mandalorian recap, there may also be room for a community of writers, and of writers‚Äô collectives (DAOs and multi-sig publications), who create more thoughtful and lasting criticism by building on and attributing each others‚Äô ideas. The only question is whether there are readers and writers who value it.\n\nSplits, supports and attributions are the pillars of a new Web based on NFT economics. Leapfrogging the fragility of links, we can permanently record these more meaningful associations on the blockchain. Instead of a business based on traffic funnels and user-data harvesting, we can have transparent financial flows. The practice and culture of sharing ownership and credit can change the incentives of creation. Through an architecture of composable ideas, we can add to and amplify each other‚Äôs efforts that build a tower of innovative work, solidly established on the recognition and reward of its foundations. \n\n\n[Attributions](split://0x38f60E0C7599Ac3088fBEea7552e3064E3C34D40?network=mainnet)", "timestamp": 1620920921, "digest": "jQPCNL3XvdzfZFUvgk1kaupkl5GJD7OrBH5GgrD3FaY", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

Of course in doing so, they are more likely themselves to be attributed again.\n\nBut like any foundational change, this will not only impact the way we drive value from the finished product, but influence the creation of the product itself. Splits and other tools like them introduce a business model around the creation of content, going beyond existing methods that focus purely on post-publish production and distribution. This concept has the ability to drive a significant value change to foundational content creation because the financial flows can go much deeper than one level. This isn‚Äôt about changing surface level citations and crediting, but about fundamentally altering the entire production, ownership and funding model for digital content.\n\nOur friends from Mirror note, ‚Äúbecause crypto allows economics to route between any smart contracts, split value can flow beyond just people to entities like... NFTs.‚Äù So when you attribute Sari and Jad‚Äôs essay, any revenue you generate can flow proportionally and pool in their NFT. And if they wanted, that pool could continue to flow, according to the attribution splits they in turn determined, into the NFTs that inspired their work. Of course, the same dynamic would occur if someone created an NFT that attributed your essay. Revenue starting at the top would flow all the way down to the foundational inspirations. What used to be hyperlinks and mentions now becomes a financial structure that helps strengthen and fund an entire ecosystem. NFTs and splits have finally given hyperlinks a business model.\n\nMatt Stephenson laid it out perfectly in his recent essay, ‚ÄòHow the First Great Finding in Empirical Science Was Lost for Decades.‚Äô Focusing on the potential for cascading attribution as a funding source for basic scientific research, he called it a ‚Äò[Splitstream](https://s.mirror.xyz/vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg).‚Äô\n\n> The SplitStream is a system in which portions of an NFT sale may flow to some or all of the works the NFT cites, with those cited works then sending some of their funds further along to the works they cite, and so on.\n\n[Sari and Jad seize](https://sariazout.mirror.xyz/etHY_neWXosxDJpGOhzuwi-cB0qOvMco_iwO5yJ1Ai0) on the significance of this flow for deep foundational work--\n\n> But what if your back-catalog wasn‚Äôt stagnant, but rather an ever-evolving source of passive income? What if the value of your work was driven by the number of references and citations, and more references meant more dollars? What if the ROI of an essay that took hundreds of hours to write was orders of magnitude higher than those designed for virality or disposability?\n\nBut where does the revenue come from? How does the funding get into this proposed attribution system? What will power this new business model? Are people seriously going to buy essay-NFTs or other content NFTs like they buy Cryptopunks and Beeples?\n\nLikely not. At least not for every content format. While there have been a number of very successful sales of essay-NFTs, it‚Äôs just not a perfect fit for the medium. While very old and important books are valuable, essays don‚Äôt hold the same perceived store of value as art and collectibles. There isn‚Äôt an existing cultural tradition of selling, much less auctioning, written content in the same way. \n\nBut when we unpack the reason people are buying NFTs, we see three interconnected motivations: \n\n- **Identity**: a desire to be personally associated with a particular creation\n- **Status**: an effort to support a particular creator, and thus be included in their future works\n- **Equity**: a hope that the asset may generate profit if it increases in value\n\nAnd those motivations are relevant for every content format. So for revenue and funding of any content format, we just need to enable mechanisms that satisfy these motivations while being both ‚Äònative‚Äô and natural.\n\nFor writing, instead of outright purchasing an essay, there could be the notion of supporting the essay, of patronizing it. Suppose there are some finite number of support 'spots' for an essay. As a curator who admires an essay, I could purchase the privilege of being acknowledged as a supporter of it by embedding my name or DAOs name in the foundation of the UX. The support capital would flow into the NFT, and then out to the various splits of collaborators and attributors. In this way, I would also be the owner of my ‚Äòspot‚Äô and would be able to sell my ‚Äòspot‚Äô to someone else. I could perhaps even make a profit, as the essay‚Äôs place in the web of attribution becomes more established and better recognized.\n\nOf course, the list of essays a particular person or DAO supports would itself be a useful index and source of valuable notifications. By connecting with content in this way, the community acknowledges supporters as essential curators, establishing their reputation while providing  a venue for others to follow their selections. So splits have not only potentially created a new funding model for content but for curation as well.\n\nIsn‚Äôt there in this system an inherent ‚Äòfree rider‚Äô problem? Why wouldn‚Äôt someone read all these essays without ever paying to support one? Why wouldn‚Äôt someone writing an essay borrow ideas without ever attributing them as his or her source of inspiration? The answer is that they could. Just as someone can ‚Äòconsume‚Äô an NFT without owning one. But doing so puts that person outside the community of ideas, and less able to fully participate in its benefits. Someone who never supports is unlikely to be supported. Someone who never attributes is unlikely to be attributed. All of these actions are recorded on the blockchain, transparent and permanent. He can be a free rider, but his track record will make that obvious, just as someone who is a steady conduit for value will be known and rewarded.\n\nWhat we are really describing -- what Sari and Jad and Patrick and Brian are pointing us to -- is a composable architecture for ideas: NFT-essays building on each other, precisely as Jesse described, as [media legos](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1301673263840534528). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/691fc17f-5c33-484c-8caa-648cd8be982f.png?height=182&width=940)\n\nUnlike the current Web, where the game is capturing unwitting traffic and funneling it towards the companies paying us, this concept of composable ideas inverts that pernicious tendency. In a network of attribution, we aim to add to and acknowledge the work of others, intentionally driving economic and reputational value to instrumental work, precisely in order so that others will consider doing the same for us. In this system, we want others to build on what we have built. The result is an ever-climbing tower of creativity, where ideas flow up and gratitude flows down.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/122ce981-9847-490d-b201-83579877481d.png?height=680&width=660)\n\nNot all nodes in this architecture can be of equal influence. Some will be much more significant than others. There will be foundational content pieces that are the end-point recipients of the attributions of tens of thousands of other creations. There will be other content pieces that provide essential bridges and flows between seemingly separate topic-networks. There will be curators whose lists of proudly supported content make up the definitive canon on a particular subject and whose support funded the thinking that built a whole new field of investigation and invention. But it is an architecture that gives every individual creator a platform and culture in which their ideas can radiate if they are useful to others.\n\nSo this new graph isn‚Äôt about who you ‚Äòfriend‚Äô or follow, but who you attribute, who you support, and who inspires and supports you. Not as social gestures, but inscribed in smart contracts that deliver economic benefits. Not as traffic driven, but as credit given. Is this a relevant model for every kind of content? Probably not. Like the rest of the ownership economy, the places where these concepts will have the most impact are those domains where a specific community perceives a great deal of merit. Blockchain-based attribution is unlikely to change the business model behind an ephemeral news story, product review or TV show summary. But it is also possible that it changes the way those markets can be served. In addition to the competitive scrambling to be the first and most viral Mandalorian recap, there may also be room for a community of writers, and of writers‚Äô collectives (DAOs and multi-sig publications), who create more thoughtful and lasting criticism by building on and attributing each others‚Äô ideas. The only question is whether there are readers and writers who value it.\n\nSplits, supports and attributions are the pillars of a new Web based on NFT economics. Leapfrogging the fragility of links, we can permanently record these more meaningful associations on the blockchain. Instead of a business based on traffic funnels and user-data harvesting, we can have transparent financial flows. The practice and culture of sharing ownership and credit can change the incentives of creation. Through an architecture of composable ideas, we can add to and amplify each other‚Äôs efforts that build a tower of innovative work, solidly established on the recognition and reward of its foundations. \n\n\n", "timestamp": 1620920801, "digest": "jQPCNL3XvdzfZFUvgk1kaupkl5GJD7OrBH5GgrD3FaY", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

{"id": "khpSRGUW5WdLq537t0I8h8DTdg_FGK4NqXviK8qcP14", "title": "Crafting Cool Collaborative Spatial Social Software for Patrons' Permanent Pondering", "body": "A few weeks ago, in between watching talks at Figma Config, my roommate & I were reminiscing about the ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù of design conferences that we had independently frequented in Europe.\n\nI was due to give my talk the next day and was in the process of rewriting the entire thing while trying to rethink the metaphysical format of what a ‚Äútalk‚Äù even was & how that should _really_ manifest.\n\nConferences are weird: at their most surface level, they‚Äôre ostensibly just paying a bunch of money to travel somewhere and sit in an auditorium or banquet room drinking stale urn coffee, processing a hangover, and watching someone give a talk that would end up on YouTube by the time you‚Äôd returned home. Indeed, some were just like that - but the best ones I went to were transformational experiences. They were where I met & reconnected with hundreds of friends I‚Äôve maintained across borders & oceans for a decade and where as a design student & new grad I first felt part of something bigger & more exciting than myself rather than an anonymous ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù in London‚Äôs stagnant graphic design scene. They were more than just watching a future-video be delivered live: a magical form of collective energetic entrainment that could never fully translate by the time a video reached YouTube.\n\nThe chills, tingles & tears I experienced during the best conferences I attended left indelible marks on my perception of myself and the world.

You‚Äôve formulated an idea that feels new and important and worth writing down and sharing with others. You start pulling together key thoughts, quotes and citations. You organize them into an outline. You write. You edit. You publish. \n\nIn the old days (of last month), you‚Äôd be posting this work to a simple blog post or a newsletter. It would (hopefully) include links in the text to the sources referenced and shoutouts to those that helped inspire your ideas. The people referenced or quoted might notice. You might tag them on Twitter. They might care a little. The links would mean incremental traffic, perhaps one or two sign ups to their personal blog or newsletter. The dopamine of being referenced would be nice too. But‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it.\n\nNow, there‚Äôs a different way to create ‚Äî one that positions you to *build upon* those sources of inspiration. Instead of using links and tags, by minting your essay as an NFT, you can attribute it, socially and financially, on-chain, to the authors and articles that influenced you. Last Tuesday, the brilliant folks at Mirror introduced the notion of ‚Äòsplits.‚Äô [To use their language](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw), splits are a native feature that let you route funds continuously to an unlimited number of Ethereum addresses, according to a set of percentage allocations. Splits can be used to share the revenue generated from a sale of an NFT with any set number of collaborators. You can specify that Jonathan should get 20% and Tal should get 40% and so on until 100% of the treasury is allocated. When money comes in, it programmably flows out based on these percentages. This is all handled by the smart contract. Trustless and public.\n\nBut another way to use splits, and the more systemically significant one, is to attribute your sources of revelation. As the Mirror team put it, ‚Äúcollaboration then extends to who inspired your idea and to what extent.‚Äù In this use-case, you specify that, say, Patrick Rivera contributed 7% of the inspiration, while Packy McCormick provided 4% and Sari Azout and Jad Esber did 12%. When revenue is generated by your NFT, they automatically get their cut. \n\nSplits take behaviors that used to be purely intrinsic and status driven (social cred) and make them financially extrinsic (social + economic cred). It evolves actions and concepts which are inherently viral by pairing them with an economic incentive. When someone gets attributed to an article, even if it‚Äôs not a lot of money in her wallet, it feels good. (Packy did it for us, and it felt awesome.) And when people feel good, they tend to want to keep feeling good and make others feel good; first, by creating more content that will inspire other people. But also by, in turn, attributing the people who have inspired their work. By paying it forward, by being a good member of the community of writers, by in effect ‚Äòpaying it backward‚Äô and acknowledging what others have given them. Of course in doing so, they are more likely themselves to be attributed again.\n\nBut like any foundational change, this will not only impact the way we drive value from the finished product, but influence the creation of the product itself. Splits and other tools like them introduce a business model around the creation of content, going beyond existing methods that focus purely on post-publish production and distribution. This concept has the ability to drive a significant value change to foundational content creation because the financial flows can go much deeper than one level. This isn‚Äôt about changing surface level citations and crediting, but about fundamentally altering the entire production, ownership and funding model for digital content.\n\nOur friends from Mirror note, ‚Äúbecause crypto allows economics to route between any smart contracts, split value can flow beyond just people to entities like... NFTs.‚Äù So when you attribute Sari and Jad‚Äôs essay, any revenue you generate can flow proportionally and pool in their NFT. And if they wanted, that pool could continue to flow, according to the attribution splits they in turn determined, into the NFTs that inspired their work. Of course, the same dynamic would occur if someone created an NFT that attributed your essay. Revenue starting at the top would flow all the way down to the foundational inspirations. What used to be hyperlinks and mentions now becomes a financial structure that helps strengthen and fund an entire ecosystem. NFTs and splits have finally given hyperlinks a business model.\n\nMatt Stephenson laid it out perfectly in his recent essay, ‚ÄòHow the First Great Finding in Empirical Science Was Lost for Decades.‚Äô Focusing on the potential for cascading attribution as a funding source for basic scientific research, he called it a ‚Äò[Splitstream](https://s.mirror.xyz/vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg).‚Äô\n\n> The SplitStream is a system in which portions of an NFT sale may flow to some or all of the works the NFT cites, with those cited works then sending some of their funds further along to the works they cite, and so on.\n\n[Sari and Jad seize](https://sariazout.mirror.xyz/etHY_neWXosxDJpGOhzuwi-cB0qOvMco_iwO5yJ1Ai0) on the significance of this flow for deep foundational work--\n\n> But what if your back-catalog wasn‚Äôt stagnant, but rather an ever-evolving source of passive income? What if the value of your work was driven by the number of references and citations, and more references meant more dollars? What if the ROI of an essay that took hundreds of hours to write was orders of magnitude higher than those designed for virality or disposability?\n\nBut where does the revenue come from? How does the funding get into this proposed attribution system? What will power this new business model? Are people seriously going to buy essay-NFTs or other content NFTs like they buy Cryptopunks and Beeples?\n\nLikely not. At least not for every content format. While there have been a number of very successful sales of essay-NFTs, it‚Äôs just not a perfect fit for the medium. While very old and important books are valuable, essays don‚Äôt hold the same perceived store of value as art and collectibles. There isn‚Äôt an existing cultural tradition of selling, much less auctioning, written content in the same way. \n\nBut when we unpack the reason people are buying NFTs, we see three interconnected motivations: \n\n- **Identity**: a desire to be personally associated with a particular creation\n- **Status**: an effort to support a particular creator, and thus be included in their future works\n- **Equity**: a hope that the asset may generate profit if it increases in value\n\nAnd those motivations are relevant for every content format. So for revenue and funding of any content format, we just need to enable mechanisms that satisfy these motivations while being both ‚Äònative‚Äô and natural.\n\nFor writing, instead of outright purchasing an essay, there could be the notion of supporting the essay, of patronizing it. Suppose there are some finite number of support 'spots' for an essay. As a curator who admires an essay, I could purchase the privilege of being acknowledged as a supporter of it by embedding my name or DAOs name in the foundation of the UX. The support capital would flow into the NFT, and then out to the various splits of collaborators and attributors. In this way, I would also be the owner of my ‚Äòspot‚Äô and would be able to sell my ‚Äòspot‚Äô to someone else. I could perhaps even make a profit, as the essay‚Äôs place in the web of attribution becomes more established and better recognized.\n\nOf course, the list of essays a particular person or DAO supports would itself be a useful index and source of valuable notifications. By connecting with content in this way, the community acknowledges supporters as essential curators, establishing their reputation while providing  a venue for others to follow their selections. So splits have not only potentially created a new funding model for content but for curation as well.\n\nIsn‚Äôt there in this system an inherent ‚Äòfree rider‚Äô problem? Why wouldn‚Äôt someone read all these essays without ever paying to support one? Why wouldn‚Äôt someone writing an essay borrow ideas without ever attributing them as his or her source of inspiration? The answer is that they could. Just as someone can ‚Äòconsume‚Äô an NFT without owning one. But doing so puts that person outside the community of ideas, and less able to fully participate in its benefits. Someone who never supports is unlikely to be supported. Someone who never attributes is unlikely to be attributed. All of these actions are recorded on the blockchain, transparent and permanent. He can be a free rider, but his track record will make that obvious, just as someone who is a steady conduit for value will be known and rewarded.\n\nWhat we are really describing -- what Sari and Jad and Patrick and Brian are pointing us to -- is a composable architecture for ideas: NFT-essays building on each other, precisely as Jesse described, as [media legos](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1301673263840534528). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/691fc17f-5c33-484c-8caa-648cd8be982f.png?height=182&width=940)\n\nUnlike the current Web, where the game is capturing unwitting traffic and funneling it towards the companies paying us, this concept of composable ideas inverts that pernicious tendency. In a network of attribution, we aim to add to and acknowledge the work of others, intentionally driving economic and reputational value to instrumental work, precisely in order so that others will consider doing the same for us. In this system, we want others to build on what we have built. The result is an ever-climbing tower of creativity, where ideas flow up and gratitude flows down.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/122ce981-9847-490d-b201-83579877481d.png?height=680&width=660)\n\nNot all nodes in this architecture can be of equal influence. Some will be much more significant than others. There will be foundational content pieces that are the end-point recipients of the attributions of tens of thousands of other creations. There will be other content pieces that provide essential bridges and flows between seemingly separate topic-networks. There will be curators whose lists of proudly supported content make up the definitive canon on a particular subject and whose support funded the thinking that built a whole new field of investigation and invention. But it is an architecture that gives every individual creator a platform and culture in which their ideas can radiate if they are useful to others.\n\nSo this new graph isn‚Äôt about who you ‚Äòfriend‚Äô or follow, but who you attribute, who you support, and who inspires and supports you. Not as social gestures, but inscribed in smart contracts that deliver economic benefits. Not as traffic driven, but as credit given. Is this a relevant model for every kind of content? Probably not. Like the rest of the ownership economy, the places where these concepts will have the most impact are those domains where a specific community perceives a great deal of merit. Blockchain-based attribution is unlikely to change the business model behind an ephemeral news story, product review or TV show summary. But it is also possible that it changes the way those markets can be served. In addition to the competitive scrambling to be the first and most viral Mandalorian recap, there may also be room for a community of writers, and of writers‚Äô collectives (DAOs and multi-sig publications), who create more thoughtful and lasting criticism by building on and attributing each others‚Äô ideas. The only question is whether there are readers and writers who value it.\n\nSplits, supports and attributions are the pillars of a new Web based on NFT economics. Leapfrogging the fragility of links, we can permanently record these more meaningful associations on the blockchain. Instead of a business based on traffic funnels and user-data harvesting, we can have transparent financial flows. The practice and culture of sharing ownership and credit can change the incentives of creation. Through an architecture of composable ideas, we can add to and amplify each other‚Äôs efforts that build a tower of innovative work, solidly established on the recognition and reward of its foundations. \n\n\n[Attributions](split://0x38f60E0C7599Ac3088fBEea7552e3064E3C34D40?network=mainnet)", "timestamp": 1620926359, "digest": "jQPCNL3XvdzfZFUvgk1kaupkl5GJD7OrBH5GgrD3FaY", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

Indeed, some were just like that - but the best ones I went to were transformational experiences. They were where I met & reconnected with hundreds of friends I‚Äôve maintained across borders & oceans for a decade and where as a design student & new grad I first felt part of something bigger & more exciting than myself rather than an anonymous ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù in London‚Äôs stagnant graphic design scene. They were more than just watching a future-video be delivered live: a magical form of collective energetic entrainment that could never fully translate by the time a video reached YouTube.\n\nThe chills, tingles & tears I experienced during the best conferences I attended left indelible marks on my perception of myself and the world. They were so much more than ‚Äújust watching talks‚Äù; holistic moments of micro cultural zeitgeists.\n\nThe event producers at Config had also recognized that an online conference should be more engaging and interactive than ‚Äúa streaming video embedded on a webpage‚Äù, and had arranged a whole program of experiences to bring attendees together between talks. You know how the process of finishing is though: before I could ‚Äúfinish my talk‚Äù I had to fully explore my own thoughts on conferences and connection.\n\n***\n\nAs a musician it is my assertion that performers are only one component of the experience of a performance: an attentive & open audience is integral to co-creating the conditions necessary for really magical experiences. Public speaking is no different.\n\nPerforming to a webcam in your bedroom can be an isolating experience. Virtual concerts on Zoom‚Äîwhere I can see people‚Äôs faces, and unmute them in between songs so it‚Äôs not weird & silent‚Äîare infinitely more interesting to me than streaming to something like Instagram Live or Zoom. One-to-many streaming platforms may contain a flurry of metrics or comments, but broadly the interactions with my live audience are either quantitative & depersonalized, or distractions that take me out of the mental headspace I need to drop into what I‚Äôm trying to bring into the world. What I want in my digital events is to feel the presence of an engaged, thoughtful & present audience in just the same way as I might when performing in a whisper-quiet living room or ‚Äúlistening room‚Äù concert.\n\nAt Config, the speakers streamed from a different application than was used by the audience to watch the talks: that is to say, I didn‚Äôt get to see the attendees‚Äô live comment sidebar as I was speaking. Friends sent me screenshots afterwards & I‚Äôm grateful for the kind words people had to say about my talk, but had I been scanning it in the moment it would have certainly taken me away from the focus I needed to speak.\n\nStill, I wanted to know that I was not speaking into a void: that I was not in an empty auditorium doing a dress rehearsal but that there were real humans out in the front row if I squinted past the stage lighting.\n\nI also wanted to prototype something of a less ephemeral experience than the chat box that my talk was paired with: a permanent trail of thoughtful breadcrumbs marking the experience of my community listening to my talk.\n\nI was considering all of this as I laid awake all night (literally: I couldn‚Äôt sleep for a second) after the first day of Config, mentally reworking the talk I was due to give in a few hours.\n\nA few things came together in a wholly unexpected way. John Palmer had just given a real corker of a talk about spatial software, and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about enamored I had been a decade ago when I first encountered Jef Raskin‚Äôs seminal The Humane Interface, or in 2020 when Aza Raskin showed me a prototype of what became MakeSpace. This paired with my own rejection of anything that feels like shoehorning my divergent, ADHD thought process into a boring linear flow - whether designing or writing a presentation, I resent being forced inside arbitrary boxes and sequences.\n\nI also wanted ways to bring in my patrons & friends in a way that recognized their support of my work & the conversations we have that drive each others‚Äô work forward. I wanted to weave together a brand new spin on the collective reflection & pondering of IRL conferences in the old days, in a realtime, living, and permanent way: the digital version of nudging your seatmate & whispering ‚Äúholyshit‚Äù, or having lengthier conversations about what you‚Äôd just witnessed over lunch.\n\nBeing an independent individual working in technology, I get the best of both worlds: the firehose of inspiration from my friends launching cool things, and the autonomy to immediately use them without waiting for it to be ‚Äúenterprise ready‚Äù, or doing months of proposals. Indeed, one of the themes about my talk was about how the drudgery of the corporate technology company is antithetical to why I got into technology in the first place or how I think interesting things are invented. My talk was also about just __doing the thing__ and living our values in every moment rather than waiting for permission from imaginary gatekeepers.\n\n20 hours before, Dylan Field had introduced Figma‚Äôs brand new, collaborative ‚Äúdigital whiteboard‚Äù app: FigJam.

Indeed, some were just like that - but the best ones I went to were transformational experiences. They were where I met & reconnected with hundreds of friends I‚Äôve maintained across borders & oceans for a decade and where as a design student & new grad I first felt part of something bigger & more exciting than myself rather than an anonymous ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù in London‚Äôs stagnant graphic design scene. They were more than just watching a future-video be delivered live: a magical form of collective energetic entrainment that could never fully translate by the time a video reached YouTube.\n\nThe chills, tingles & tears I experienced during the best conferences I attended left indelible marks on my perception of myself and the world. They were so much more than ‚Äújust watching talks‚Äù; holistic moments of micro cultural zeitgeists.\n\nThe event producers at Config had also recognized that an online conference should be more engaging and interactive than ‚Äúa streaming video embedded on a webpage‚Äù, and had arranged a whole program of experiences to bring attendees together between talks. You know how the process of finishing is though: before I could ‚Äúfinish my talk‚Äù I had to fully explore my own thoughts on conferences and connection.\n\n***\n\nAs a musician it is my assertion that performers are only one component of the experience of a performance: an attentive & open audience is integral to co-creating the conditions necessary for really magical experiences. Public speaking is no different.\n\nPerforming to a webcam in your bedroom can be an isolating experience. Virtual concerts on Zoom‚Äîwhere I can see people‚Äôs faces, and unmute them in between songs so it‚Äôs not weird & silent‚Äîare infinitely more interesting to me than streaming to something like Instagram Live or Zoom. One-to-many streaming platforms may contain a flurry of metrics or comments, but broadly the interactions with my live audience are either quantitative & depersonalized, or distractions that take me out of the mental headspace I need to drop into what I‚Äôm trying to bring into the world. What I want in my digital events is to feel the presence of an engaged, thoughtful & present audience in just the same way as I might when performing in a whisper-quiet living room or ‚Äúlistening room‚Äù concert.\n\nAt Config, the speakers streamed from a different application than was used by the audience to watch the talks: that is to say, I didn‚Äôt get to see the attendees‚Äô live comment sidebar as I was speaking. Friends sent me screenshots afterwards & I‚Äôm grateful for the kind words people had to say about my talk, but had I been scanning it in the moment it would have certainly taken me away from the focus I needed to speak.\n\nStill, I wanted to know that I was not speaking into a void: that I was not in an empty auditorium doing a dress rehearsal but that there were real humans out in the front row if I squinted past the stage lighting.\n\nI also wanted to prototype something of a less ephemeral experience than the chat box that my talk was paired with: a permanent trail of thoughtful breadcrumbs marking the experience of my community listening to my talk.\n\nI was considering all of this as I laid awake all night (literally: I couldn‚Äôt sleep for a second) after the first day of Config, mentally reworking the talk I was due to give in a few hours.\n\nA few things came together in a wholly unexpected way. John Palmer had just given a real corker of a talk about spatial software, and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about enamored I had been a decade ago when I first encountered Jef Raskin‚Äôs seminal The Humane Interface, or in 2020 when Aza Raskin showed me a prototype of what became MakeSpace. This paired with my own rejection of anything that feels like shoehorning my divergent, ADHD thought process into a boring linear flow - whether designing or writing a presentation, I resent being forced inside arbitrary boxes and sequences.\n\nI also wanted ways to bring in my patrons & friends in a way that recognized their support of my work & the conversations we have that drive each others‚Äô work forward. I wanted to weave together a brand new spin on the collective reflection & pondering of IRL conferences in the old days, in a realtime, living, and permanent way: the digital version of nudging your seatmate & whispering ‚Äúholyshit‚Äù, or having lengthier conversations about what you‚Äôd just witnessed over lunch.\n\nBeing an independent individual working in technology, I get the best of both worlds: the firehose of inspiration from my friends launching cool things, and the autonomy to immediately use them without waiting for it to be ‚Äúenterprise ready‚Äù, or doing months of proposals. Indeed, one of the themes about my talk was about how the drudgery of the corporate technology company is antithetical to why I got into technology in the first place or how I think interesting things are invented. My talk was also about just __doing the thing__ and living our values in every moment rather than waiting for permission from imaginary gatekeepers.\n\n20 hours before, Dylan Field had introduced Figma‚Äôs brand new, collaborative ‚Äúdigital whiteboard‚Äù app: FigJam. I hadn‚Äôt used it yet, but it sounded rad and I had an excellent excuse to see how it worked.\n\n***\n\nI find that when I realize that there is a crystal clear path to congruent action, the thought of living for the rest of my life with an unanswered question is unbearably painful. Action is fun.\n\nAfter giving up on my naive desire to sleep, at 9am I texted a handful of friends variations of ‚Äúyoooooo, what are you doing in like 2h??? Wanna try a weird experiment I literally just thought of, live, in front of like 60k people??? Lmk asap & I‚Äôll tell you more (omg I‚Äôm so tired fml)‚Äù. Because my friends are the BEST, they all said yes. Then I texted Rogie (who had been helping me refine my talk from the Figma side) ~‚Äúgonna try something different, might bomb, might work, sorry lol‚Äù, and got out of bed.\n\nLuckily I‚Äôm not much of a ‚Äúgive a Serious PowerPoint Presentation With Slides & Bullet Points & Graphs & Stuff‚Äù kind of person. Like I said, I have ADHD and the linear flow of presentation software makes me feel constricted & doesn‚Äôt let me fully experience ideas as I would prefer to communicate them. My ‚Äúdeck‚Äù at that point was mostly photos of moss & flowers from my garden to form a soothing background montage as I spoke (it will make sense when the video comes out next week, I promise). As the clock counted down to my talk, I moved the slides that I did have over to FigJam, invited my friends to the document, and shared my screen.\n\nAs I gave the talk I panned around the FigJam canvas while my friends laid down digital sticky notes, drawings & stamps with their reflections & pulling out quotes from what I was saying.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/51f8f936-7bd7-4677-b9ff-dcc84fa88042.jpeg?height=927&width=1429)\n\nSomething magical started happening too - people started taking notes together, building off of each other, in a way that I hadn‚Äôt predicted. There was no group chat thread and I hadn‚Äôt really given much guidance beyond ‚Äúyou have edit access to this doc - I haven‚Äôt used FigJam before either, let‚Äôs figure it out live‚Äù.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0f466124-6013-477f-924a-f41854346fd9.jpeg?height=701&width=998)\n\nOf course, this format was just an experiment. We had a couple of hours to pull it together, but the mechanics of it hint at something bigger.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/531aef59-d496-4ae6-b5b3-f6cab77f432e.jpeg?height=1126&width=1835)\n\nThe people I invited were mostly the friends who I‚Äôd been chatting to recently and so were towards the top of my message lists in Telegram & iMessage as I scrambled to pull together a crew. It was an imperfect system, but a gesturing towards a more robust form of bought-in patronage. My intention is that future experiments are broadened out to include the full scope of who I consider my patrons: those who have financially supported me, intellectually driven projects forward with conversation, contributed in-kind to codebases, energetically supported me, or have just been engaged & receptive on social media.\n\nThe video of Config talk‚ÄîNew Futures, Together‚Äîwill be published my Figma in the next few weeks.\n\nAs I‚Äôve been processing the experiment & getting back into my writing habit on Mirror I realized that collaborative, participatory, spatial canvases are really interesting primitives for _any_ form of communal discussion. Mirror doesn‚Äôt have a comment section, and yet I crave a place for my patrons to reflect on my writing more publicly than our DMs, and in a more focused & less attention-hostile place than on social media.\n\nWith that said, I have created [another FigJam canvas](https://www.figma.com/file/JL3tii4BM2P3wloCjV1zVb/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1), just for this post.

What if that happened directly within the narrative as part of the story?\n\nThis scenario has informed our approach to interface since day one, and lead us to creating a series of *Economic Blocks*‚Äîembeddable interfaces you can place within a story enabling readers to interact by funding and sustaining great ideas. *To be active participants of the story being created.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a6ce55c-ead2-4343-99ae-93568ffbd715.jpeg?height=1012&width=2024&hide=true)\n\nClearly there was something to this. We‚Äôre beginning to lose count of how many successful projects have taken place during Mirror‚Äôs first few months! Projects like Colin and Samir‚Äôs [NFT auction and split](https://colinandsamir.mirror.xyz/G5kD1SysIvVE-Socv7zknOExp3wZWZPSZ9_sxBj_cV4), Songcamp‚Äôs [auctions and splits for three original songs](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM), Emily‚Äôs [crowdfund for $NOVEL](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), and many more.\n\n![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/permalinks.svg?height=1012&width=2024&size=medium)\n\nThe economic blocks powering these projects have turned out to be just that‚Äî*very powerful.* Although they take form as focused embeddable blocks within stories, each contain much of the same functionality you‚Äôd expect from an *entire platform*. No joke!\n\nWith this in mind, we decided to give economic blocks permanent homes by creating **Permalinks**‚Äîdirect links to URLs where blocks are accessible outside of entries. You can discover a block‚Äôs permalink by clicking the üîó link icon in the a block heading. Auctions in particular look good! Here are a few favorite examples:\n\n- COPE‚Äôs [First Issue crowdfund and split](https://cope.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0xb0c813151d18482a914a2b95b1a25d020532Bb36).\n- SongCamp‚Äôs [auction and split for a song](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/auctions/0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3028).\n- Visualize Value‚Äôs [split for the Infinite Players auction](https://mirror.xyz/splits/0xc811597463a2A5ec2dda2291fF3F35938dE48702).\n- Mint Fund‚Äôs [auction and split for an entire zine](https://sirsu.mirror.xyz/auctions/0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3051)!\n\nIn truth, this has been on our mind since day one, but overtime the idea was validated by seeing how blocks have been used by *you*.

Indeed, some were just like that - but the best ones I went to were transformational experiences. They were where I met & reconnected with hundreds of friends I‚Äôve maintained across borders & oceans for a decade and where as a design student & new grad I first felt part of something bigger & more exciting than myself rather than an anonymous ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù in London‚Äôs stagnant graphic design scene. They were more than just watching a future-video be delivered live: a magical form of collective energetic entrainment that could never fully translate by the time a video reached YouTube.\n\nThe chills, tingles & tears I experienced during the best conferences I attended left indelible marks on my perception of myself and the world. They were so much more than ‚Äújust watching talks‚Äù; holistic moments of micro cultural zeitgeists.\n\nThe event producers at Config had also recognized that an online conference should be more engaging and interactive than ‚Äúa streaming video embedded on a webpage‚Äù, and had arranged a whole program of experiences to bring attendees together between talks. You know how the process of finishing is though: before I could ‚Äúfinish my talk‚Äù I had to fully explore my own thoughts on conferences and connection.\n\n***\n\nAs a musician it is my assertion that performers are only one component of the experience of a performance: an attentive & open audience is integral to co-creating the conditions necessary for really magical experiences. Public speaking is no different.\n\nPerforming to a webcam in your bedroom can be an isolating experience. Virtual concerts on Zoom‚Äîwhere I can see people‚Äôs faces, and unmute them in between songs so it‚Äôs not weird & silent‚Äîare infinitely more interesting to me than streaming to something like Instagram Live or Zoom. One-to-many streaming platforms may contain a flurry of metrics or comments, but broadly the interactions with my live audience are either quantitative & depersonalized, or distractions that take me out of the mental headspace I need to drop into what I‚Äôm trying to bring into the world. What I want in my digital events is to feel the presence of an engaged, thoughtful & present audience in just the same way as I might when performing in a whisper-quiet living room or ‚Äúlistening room‚Äù concert.\n\nAt Config, the speakers streamed from a different application than was used by the audience to watch the talks: that is to say, I didn‚Äôt get to see the attendees‚Äô live comment sidebar as I was speaking. Friends sent me screenshots afterwards & I‚Äôm grateful for the kind words people had to say about my talk, but had I been scanning it in the moment it would have certainly taken me away from the focus I needed to speak.\n\nStill, I wanted to know that I was not speaking into a void: that I was not in an empty auditorium doing a dress rehearsal but that there were real humans out in the front row if I squinted past the stage lighting.\n\nI also wanted to prototype something of a less ephemeral experience than the chat box that my talk was paired with: a permanent trail of thoughtful breadcrumbs marking the experience of my community listening to my talk.\n\nI was considering all of this as I laid awake all night (literally: I couldn‚Äôt sleep for a second) after the first day of Config, mentally reworking the talk I was due to give in a few hours.\n\nA few things came together in a wholly unexpected way. John Palmer had just given a real corker of a talk about spatial software, and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about enamored I had been a decade ago when I first encountered Jef Raskin‚Äôs seminal The Humane Interface, or in 2020 when Aza Raskin showed me a prototype of what became MakeSpace. This paired with my own rejection of anything that feels like shoehorning my divergent, ADHD thought process into a boring linear flow - whether designing or writing a presentation, I resent being forced inside arbitrary boxes and sequences.\n\nI also wanted ways to bring in my patrons & friends in a way that recognized their support of my work & the conversations we have that drive each others‚Äô work forward. I wanted to weave together a brand new spin on the collective reflection & pondering of IRL conferences in the old days, in a realtime, living, and permanent way: the digital version of nudging your seatmate & whispering ‚Äúholyshit‚Äù, or having lengthier conversations about what you‚Äôd just witnessed over lunch.\n\nBeing an independent individual working in technology, I get the best of both worlds: the firehose of inspiration from my friends launching cool things, and the autonomy to immediately use them without waiting for it to be ‚Äúenterprise ready‚Äù, or doing months of proposals. Indeed, one of the themes about my talk was about how the drudgery of the corporate technology company is antithetical to why I got into technology in the first place or how I think interesting things are invented. My talk was also about just __doing the thing__ and living our values in every moment rather than waiting for permission from imaginary gatekeepers.\n\n20 hours before, Dylan Field had introduced Figma‚Äôs brand new, collaborative ‚Äúdigital whiteboard‚Äù app: FigJam. I hadn‚Äôt used it yet, but it sounded rad and I had an excellent excuse to see how it worked.\n\n***\n\nI find that when I realize that there is a crystal clear path to congruent action, the thought of living for the rest of my life with an unanswered question is unbearably painful. Action is fun.\n\nAfter giving up on my naive desire to sleep, at 9am I texted a handful of friends variations of ‚Äúyoooooo, what are you doing in like 2h??? Wanna try a weird experiment I literally just thought of, live, in front of like 60k people??? Lmk asap & I‚Äôll tell you more (omg I‚Äôm so tired fml)‚Äù. Because my friends are the BEST, they all said yes. Then I texted Rogie (who had been helping me refine my talk from the Figma side) ~‚Äúgonna try something different, might bomb, might work, sorry lol‚Äù, and got out of bed.\n\nLuckily I‚Äôm not much of a ‚Äúgive a Serious PowerPoint Presentation With Slides & Bullet Points & Graphs & Stuff‚Äù kind of person. Like I said, I have ADHD and the linear flow of presentation software makes me feel constricted & doesn‚Äôt let me fully experience ideas as I would prefer to communicate them. My ‚Äúdeck‚Äù at that point was mostly photos of moss & flowers from my garden to form a soothing background montage as I spoke (it will make sense when the video comes out next week, I promise). As the clock counted down to my talk, I moved the slides that I did have over to FigJam, invited my friends to the document, and shared my screen.\n\nAs I gave the talk I panned around the FigJam canvas while my friends laid down digital sticky notes, drawings & stamps with their reflections & pulling out quotes from what I was saying.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/51f8f936-7bd7-4677-b9ff-dcc84fa88042.jpeg?height=927&width=1429)\n\nSomething magical started happening too - people started taking notes together, building off of each other, in a way that I hadn‚Äôt predicted. There was no group chat thread and I hadn‚Äôt really given much guidance beyond ‚Äúyou have edit access to this doc - I haven‚Äôt used FigJam before either, let‚Äôs figure it out live‚Äù.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0f466124-6013-477f-924a-f41854346fd9.jpeg?height=701&width=998)\n\nOf course, this format was just an experiment. We had a couple of hours to pull it together, but the mechanics of it hint at something bigger.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/531aef59-d496-4ae6-b5b3-f6cab77f432e.jpeg?height=1126&width=1835)\n\nThe people I invited were mostly the friends who I‚Äôd been chatting to recently and so were towards the top of my message lists in Telegram & iMessage as I scrambled to pull together a crew. It was an imperfect system, but a gesturing towards a more robust form of bought-in patronage. My intention is that future experiments are broadened out to include the full scope of who I consider my patrons: those who have financially supported me, intellectually driven projects forward with conversation, contributed in-kind to codebases, energetically supported me, or have just been engaged & receptive on social media.\n\nThe video of Config talk‚ÄîNew Futures, Together‚Äîwill be published my Figma in the next few weeks.\n\nAs I‚Äôve been processing the experiment & getting back into my writing habit on Mirror I realized that collaborative, participatory, spatial canvases are really interesting primitives for _any_ form of communal discussion. Mirror doesn‚Äôt have a comment section, and yet I crave a place for my patrons to reflect on my writing more publicly than our DMs, and in a more focused & less attention-hostile place than on social media.\n\nWith that said, I have created [another FigJam canvas](https://www.figma.com/file/JL3tii4BM2P3wloCjV1zVb/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1), just for this post. Think of it like a more interesting alternative to a comment box.

The attention economy is booming, and people are becoming comfortable spending money on high quality digital media. Although the last several decades have seen us earning mostly as independent agents, people are increasingly joining forces to earn money together under shared group identities.\n\nThe challenge that we're facing is that the internet isn't built for group users. This means that everything that a group does, it does via its individual members who act on its behalf. In order for high levels of control to be placed in the hands of key individuals, these groups either need a high degree of structure or a high degree of trust for one another.\n\nFaced with this tradeoff, more and more people are choosing the latter‚Äî working with people they already trust, starting with their friends. Even the uncharted territory of mixing business and friendship seems to be an improvement over the stale bureaucratic structures of the last century, which clearly no longer reflect the way that we coordinate with one another. \n\nNonetheless, here is a guide to avoiding trouble when making money with friends online. We're far too early for this list to be exhaustive, but I hope it can be a useful starting point if you're thinking about diving into the deep end yourself.\n\n## 1. Respect People's Ideas \nThe best way to validate any idea is to talk about it with smart people that you already know ‚Äî the friends of yours who hopefully know at least a little bit about your chosen domain. The idea stage is an extremely sensitive time in any project's formation, especially for the people doing the ideating. Naturally, things can get uncomfortable if individuals begin to use other peoples' insights from these conversations on their own. Sometimes this looks like explicitly stealing ideas, but more often it's much more indirect. \n\nUltimately 2 good rules of thumb here are:\n\n- if someone is using you as a sounding board for a new idea, err on the side of remaining an external voice, and don't assume your own inclusion in the project unless you're explicitly invited\n- if you're actively ideating, err on the side of under-sharing with people you don't fully trust not to cut you out of your own project\n\nComplications can arise as each new perspective molds an idea into being increasingly valuable, so it's important that ideas are valued, and that the people who come up with them are given fair credit.\n\n## 2. Set Expectations Early with a Friend-Prenup\nOnce it becomes clear that what you're building has the potential to be valuable, you should have a conversation to set up some formal structure to help enable the collaboration.\n\nSome some basic details think about are:\n\n- how are you splitting the ownership and money you'll earn together?\n- how are you accounting for costs that you might incur?\n- which decisions do each of you have a say over?\n- what is each person doing to earn their fair share?\n- what specific guidelines are needed based on your unique project domain?\n\nTo do this right, it's usually worth putting this in writing ‚Äî emails are good, signed documents are even better. Although it may feel awkward at first, these agreements will eventually become the bedrock of your relationship, and will allow trust to more easily flourish between you all. The added benefit to doing this with explicit signatures is that it will force everyone to speak up early about what they think is fair, recognizing that it'll be much more difficult to change these details later on.\n\nThis process can sometimes get messy or uncomfortable, because of the subjective nature of valuing each other's work. In these negotiations, power is rarely distributed evenly between contributors, so arriving at a fair deal will usually require those with more power to be kind, and have foresight about the future of the project. The goal should be to retain this core team for a long time, **which means that the deal needs to be fair for everyone involved**. Importantly, the \"fairness\" of a given deal is highly subjective ‚Äî a fair deal is one which participants *believe* is fair in perpetuity. If you find that this conversation gets stuck, it can also be useful to have impartial 3rd parties add their perspectives on market standards.\n\nOver time these agreements will be forced to evolve, usually in the direction of stability and legitimacy. That's why it's important to have an expectation of good-faith from all parties involved. **If you don't trust your friends to act in good faith, through good times or bad, then you probably shouldn't be trying to earn money together in this manner.**\n\n## 3. Be Open to Change\n\nAny fixed expectations that you have going into the endeavour will almost certainly have to evolve as the project responds to its environment. Unless people are willing to be cooperative and adjust based on what's fair for the group over time, your operations will end up grinding to a halt. **This is why it's important for everyone involved to understand the compounding effect of collaboration, so your focus can stay on growing the pie, instead of splitting it.**\n\nJames P. Carse talks about this in his book *Finite and Infinite Games*, where finite games are played to be won by individual players, while infinite games are played so that they may continue to be played ‚Äî the game's self perpetuation being the shared goal among all players:\n\n> The rules of an infinite game must change in the course of play. The rules are changed when the players of an infinite game agree that the play is imperiled by a finite outcome ‚Äî that is, by the victory of some players and the defeat of others. The rules of an infinite game are changed to prevent anyone from winning the game and to bring as many persons as possible into the play.\n\nIf the friends you want to work with believe that keeping people happy matters more than what they stand to gain from \"winning\" on each others' behalf, then these evolutions will be flawless. If however people are continuously stretching the fairness of the arrangement in their own favour, relationships will weaken and the trust that you started with will evaporate.\n\n## 4. Remember the Stakes\n\nOne of the things that's tricky about working with friends is that the stakes are much higher than in normal business situations. Working together, you will inevitibly face tradeoffs based on the way that responsibilities and value are split up. If members approach each moment remembering what they have to lose, they will avoid making the mistake of sacrificing a friendship or their reputation for a short-term gain.\n\nThis is a high risk/high reward environment, which if played right can allow you to move as a cohesive group with ease, responding to the world much faster than any individual or traditional organization could ever dream of. However, if played incorrectly, what's at stake is a history that is increasingly impossible to wipe clean.\n\n## 5. Stick To Your Word\n\nWhen doing business with friends, integrity is extremely important. Reputations matter, because the entire premise of the game is that the heightened trust between you enables new ways of making money together. This means that in these arrangements, one must care *even more* about their integrity than in traditional business engagements (which don't normally require such high degrees of trust between members).\nMy personal guideline here is to avoid ever making promises I can't keep, to follow through on all of the promises that I *do* make, and in situations where that's impossible, to approach people as early and often as I can to make sure everyone remains happy. By approaching situations with an honest positive intention, you'll find your friends will come through for you when you need them to. The absence of transparency will have the opposite effect though, and will leave your friends feeling taken advantage of. Staying proactive is key.\n\n## 6. Be Transparent\n\nAt the end of the day, the top requirement for friends to be able to make money together is being open with each other about all of the important details of the arrangement. Sharing information builds goodwill, and over time establishes trust as everyone sees that no one has anything to hide. This will become less and less necessary as your project matures, but early on a high level of transparency is a must. \n\nSome examples of important things which should actively be shared are:\n\n- any ways that members are benefiting from the arrangement (either directly or indirectly)\n- any conflicts of interest that members might have (because of activities they do outside of the arrangement)\n- any changes that might occur with each member's expected contributions\n\nYou should also aim to have a culture of regularly providing feedback to each other, remembering that constructive feedback should always be shared 1-1 first (to make sure no one ever feels unfairly called out). For that reason, it's important that everyone feels comfortable talking to each other directly, rather than just in group forums.\n\nUltimately, being transparent is most often characterized as not hiding things. Keeping important information to yourself is sketchy, mostly because doing so creates the conditions for people to take advantage of each other. If you want people to enjoy working with you, transparency is a must for making that happen.\n\n---\n\nAside from these formalities, it's important to find a healthy balance between seriousness and play. The whole power of the internet is that it gives us a freedom to experiment, to be silly, to make mistakes, and to support your friends while they do the same. Making the experience of working together itself enjoyable ensures that there's at least one benefit gained if the project doesn't outright succeed ‚Äî you had fun with your friends!\n\nAs people continue to realize that they're tired of working with people they wouldn't be friends with, we're going to be forced to create new sets of rules to shape how we coordinate together more fluidly. If the last century's businesses were marked by bureaucracy and structure, the next century's will be built on trust and dynamic bonds between people‚Äî unlocking the latent human potential from leftover unfair deals.\n\n---\n\nSpecial thanks to [Jordan Kutzer](https://twitter.com/JordanKutzer), [Li Jin](https://twitter.com/ljin18), and [Arya Soltanieh](https://twitter.com/LostCod3r) for their help crafting this piece.", "timestamp": 1620956692, "digest": "HNRZ7nbcR-lMpmLfYLbNysDs8ubVXB3FTitMyF6dlNY", "contributor": "0xbfDb50Dc66C8Df9fd9688D8fe5A0C34126427645"}
