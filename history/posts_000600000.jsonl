{"id": "1X_Fef8V04y43AX3SQl7n5dqRUOqXLqjp0JN41FOm0E", "title": "A beginner's guide to NFTs", "body": "### What are NFTs?\n\nNon-fungible token (NFT) is a term used to describe a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. Assets that can be represented as NFTs range from digital goods, such as items that exist within virtual worlds, to claims on physical assets such as clothing items or real estate. In the coming years, we will see NFTs used to unlock entirely new use cases that are only made possible by crypto.\n\n![**Tokens redeemable for real world goods on [Zora](https://store.zora.co/)**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9799dae1-c2c9-4712-813b-10b23c279a36.jpeg)\n\nWhile the Ethereum ecosystem is where most NFT activity has taken place to date, NFTs can exist on other smart contract platforms too. This is because, at their core, NFTs are just digital abstractions used to represent assets that are one of a kind. Non-fungible token isn’t the most intuitive term since we don’t commonly refer to the fungibility of objects in the physical world, but this is an important technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain. The goal for this post is not to detail every project within the NFT space, but to give a high level overview of what NFTs are, why they are interesting, and showcase some of their potential use cases.\n\n\n### Why are NFTs interesting?\n\nNFTs are powerful because, when combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to issue, own, and trade them. This makes interacting with NFTs significantly more efficient than in traditional platforms. The same reason why cryptocurrency used in payments is more efficient than traditional payments, that it is borderless and significantly easier to transfer, applies to NFTs. For example, if you want to create tradable in-game items as a game developer, then you can instantly have them be tradable through protocols that allow for decentralized exchange of NFTs. You don’t have to create your own marketplace or go through the onboarding process of a centralized platform in order to have the items be tradable.\n\nNFT activity can go well past trading and include actions like being able to borrow and lend, support fractional ownership (e.g. [NIFTEX](https://www.niftex.com/)), or use it as collateral in taking out a loan (e.g. [NFTfi](https://nftfi.com/)). The possibilities are endless when you have the ability to combine NFTs with DeFi building blocks. For example, the game [Aavegotchi](http://aavegotchi.com) combines DeFi and NFT gaming where each Aavegotchi character represents a user’s collateral that is deposited within the lending platform [Aave](https://aave.com/), but you can also battle the characters, level them up, and equip wearables that change their traits.\n\n![**Aavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1259686-6b61-455a-a204-f6e6da648f10.jpeg)\n\nNFTs can cover an extremely wide variety of areas given they are simply digital representations of ownership but there has been significant growth within art and gaming in particular. Note that many digital works of art and gaming items are a subset of a larger category of NFT collectibles. There is also the emerging space of social tokens, which sometimes falls into the NFT category or that is closely related to it.\n\n\n### Art\n\nNFTs can make fractionalized ownership more accessible, so if there is a valuable item that otherwise wouldn’t have been accessible for someone to own, now they can own a piece of it. Custody of a physical item still requires a trustworthy custodian, but being able to issue, hold, and trade it as a cryptoasset unlocks more use cases. One can also craft an NFT such that the creator receives a percentage of all secondary sales in a completely automated way. Artists typically don’t receive a cut of secondary sales in the traditional art world. \n\nProgrammable art is another interesting concept where a piece of artwork can incorporate on-chain data to dynamically update certain features or characteristics of the work. For example, one could create a piece of programmable art whose background changes if the price of ether goes above a certain dollar-value. There are countless creative possibilities.\n\n![**Rutger van der Tas [artwork](https://async.art/art/master/0x6c424c25e9f1fff9642cb5b7750b0db7312c29ad-83) that changes based on if it’s day or night**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a51670c0-4a1c-4aaf-917d-0e551855b56d.jpeg)\n\n[Async Art](https://async.art/) is a digital art marketplace known for programmable art. Many artists on Async sell artwork where someone is able to own the “master” copy which consists of a number of individual layers, but other people can own the individual layers and adjust their attributes over time. Imagine groups of people being able to own art collectively, where members of the group manage attributes of the work.\n\n![**Osinachi [artwork](https://async.art/art/master/0x6c424c25e9f1fff9642cb5b7750b0db7312c29ad-118) that includes a master and layers that can be individually adjusted**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fea07c75-8b3c-4592-b8f2-f5d6d92e544c.jpeg)\n\nA common question about digital artwork is what can you do with it? These works can be displayed in digital frames in a physical setting for people to enjoy. The digital artist Beeple sold physical tokens along with his digital NFTs and made [$3.5 million](https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x6e5dc5405baefb8c0166bcc78d2692777f2cbffb/21) from sales in an auction on the Nifty Gateway marketplace.\n\n![**Artist Beeple’s physical token that came with the NFT sale**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8689be31-b33f-46ac-94aa-feea3a1b3dd1.jpeg)\n\nDigital artwork can also be displayed in online collections like a [SuperRare profile](https://superrare.co/thevault/collection) as well as in virtual worlds. There are a number of art galleries within [Cryptovoxels](http://cryptovoxels.com), a virtual world where users can buy and sell land parcels as NFTs. As virtual reality spaces become more popular, having digital art to display will become more common. This wouldn’t be much different than someone spending money on video game items to customize a character’s appearance, already a multi-billion dollar industry. \n\n![**Digital art gallery in Cryptovoxels**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7386d358-d43d-4934-9ea5-b51c33932365.jpeg)\n\nA common skepticism is that someone can just take a screenshot of the image or get a digital file so it’s not really scarce. However, the same argument could apply to physical items as well. Anyone can take a photo of the Mona Lisa or create a replica of it, but it isn’t the real item from the artist. People are willing to pay a premium for the original work. Another interesting aspect of digital art or collectibles is that you can easily verify the item’s ownership history. Some digital items might be worth more depending on who owned it in the past.\n\nWith NFTs, you can also prove that the item is real and tamper proof. This is an issue in the physical collectibles space. For example, a [T206 Honus Wagner baseball card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T206_Honus_Wagner) was sold to Wayne Gretzky for $451k and sold again for several million dollars. One of the sellers of the card later admitted in court to trimming the card’s edges to make it look better. You can ensure NFT supply doesn’t change and there’s no counterfeit or continued printing. For example, there are many [counterfeit Black Lotus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAvLC3fz068&) cards in the popular game Magic: The Gathering. Common verification methods include bending the card to make sure it doesn’t crease or going through centralized grading services whose rating significantly affects the card's value. \n\n\n### Gaming\n\nSteam, a popular video game platform, has a [Community Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/?) where in-game items can be bought and sold. Steam’s marketplace is centralized and collects a transaction fee of 5% for each item from the buyer. Games like Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 take an additional fee of 10% for their items sold.\n\n\n![**Steam Community Market**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ad85fcf-b986-4b60-9fb5-925200fde3a9.jpeg)\n\n\nSteam also restricts user wallet balances to $2,000 and the price of a single item to $1,800. While these cases are outliers, many in-game items can actually sell for significantly larger amounts such as the [DotA 2 pink war dog courier](https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-06-dota-2-pink-war-dog-courier-sells-for-38-000.html) for $38,000. Within the crypto space there have also been high priced sales such as the $170,000 [CryptoKitty](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/most-expensive-cryptokitty/). Similarly Magic: The Gathering’s coveted [Black Lotus](https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/5/18251623/magic-the-gathering-black-lotus-auction-price) card sold for $166,100. There is certainly demand for valuable in-game items. In decentralized marketplaces, there isn’t a limit imposed on what game items can be sold and for what amount.\n\nDecentralized marketplaces can significantly reduce transaction fees due to the improved efficiency of starting up and operating a marketplace. Marketplaces can also improve overall user experience and increase interest in the game. Hearthstone is a wildly popular digital collectible card game created by Blizzard Entertainment that had over [100 million players](https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/hearthstone-has-over-100-million-players-1203019919/) in 2018. Hearthstone opted to not have a marketplace for their cards which leaves opportunity for other digital collectible card games that allow for an open marketplace. [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) and [SkyWeaver](https://www.skyweaver.net/) are two trading card games (TCGs) that have cards that are freely tradable. You are also able to earn cards as you level up in the game. Players that did not purchase packs of cards will still be able to improve upon the game’s default decks. It’s an exciting feeling knowing that the earned cards have real world value and can be sold or traded for other cards. Gods Unchained also lets users earn tokens for when they win a match or refer their friend. The tokens themselves unlock rare in-game items and are also freely tradable.\n\n\n![**Gods Unchained**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa82c586-39b6-46b1-ae55-cb8a2e44c8e1.jpeg)\n\n\nOne of the most popular games in crypto is [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/). You battle with a team of pet Axies and level them up. There's no aspect of the gameplay that feels like a blockchain game but there is the added benefit of being able to openly trade the Axies on NFT marketplaces such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). The game has become popular in the [Philippines](https://www.coindesk.com/nft-game-filipinos-covid) and earning tokens from the game has become a viable source of income for players even [beating minimum wage](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/07/08/axie-infinity-beats-minimum-wage-in-many-countries/) in many countries. There is also a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called [Yield Guild Games](https://yieldguild.io/) which leases Axies to players that want to get started with the game but don’t have the funds to purchase them. Several rare Axies were even [purchased](https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/why-we-spent-159k-on-digital-battle-pets-2/) for $159,000 total.\n\n\n![**Axie Infinity battle**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/26353bcc-0d05-47ea-89ac-fcdc9d2dd848.jpeg)\n\n\nThere’s another popular game [Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/) where you can explore different planets and collect Artifact NFTs on new planets, which give bonuses when attached to the planet. Being able to discover and collect these items or even win them in a battle and then trade them in decentralized marketplaces can make the game even more fun.\n\n![Planet in Dark Forest which has an Artifact NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/be66b61a-05f0-46b7-aa8f-f7ed542d5cd3.jpeg)\n\nOne concern with making in-game items tradable is that the ability to trade items can negatively affect the gameplay as people are focused on extracting value from the system or only the players that are willing to pay a lot of money for items can enjoy the game. Diablo III had an auction house where users could trade in-game items for in-game currency and cash. It was [shut down](https://www.wired.com/2013/09/diablo-auction-house/) because of how it affected the game. It was no longer fun and rewarding since players would just buy the best loot. In Diablo III, having the best loot was essentially the goal of the game so having an auction house severely affected gameplay whereas other games are not set up this way. It’s important for game developers to find a balance on what should be freely traded for their game (e.g. skins rather than weapons, [game time](https://secure.eveonline.com/plex/) itself can be traded, etc).\n\n\n### Social tokens\n\nThe emerging area of social tokens grew significantly in 2020. Social tokens are a broad category of tokens issued by individuals and communities. This term encompasses other similar terms like personal token, community token, and creator token. So far there hasn’t been a standardized term but I will use social tokens to refer to the broader category. Social tokens enable creators and communities to have more ownership in what they are building which is extremely exciting.\n\n\n![Social tokens map created by Forefront and Seedclub in [Social Tokens Year in Review](https://2020inreview.forefront.news/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b9316db6-25dd-4c4e-bbb2-b18cfa9a7890.jpeg)\n\nEarly experiments of social tokens involved people tokenizing their time. For example [Reuben Bramanathan, who previously worked on legal and product at Coinbase,](https://twitter.com/bramanathan?lang=en) tokenized his time where 1 [$CSNL](https://www.bramanathan.com/) token equaled 1 hour of his time and was freely traded. We also saw people attempting to tokenize part of their future income. Platforms like [Roll](https://tryroll.com/) and [Coinvise](https://coinvise.co/) make it easier for people to issue their own token.\n\nOne prominent example of a social token is [$RAC](https://blog.ourzora.com/home/introducing-rac), a community token by the Grammy award winning recording artist [RAC](https://twitter.com/RAC), issued through Zora. Token holders get access to a private Discord group and receive early access to merch drops with more perks to be added in the future. The token was retroactively distributed to his supporters including Bandcamp and Patreon supporters, people who had bought merch, and will eventually be distributed to all Twitch supporters. This allows creators to directly interact with and reward their early supporters.\n\nOne of the tools that enabled a new wave of social tokens was [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/), which built a Telegram and Discord bot that connects to an Ethereum wallet to verify token balance before joining a chat group. This allowed for the creation of token permissioned groups, such as [$JAMM](https://www.jammpad.com/) and [$KARMA](https://andrwlee.medium.com/announcing-karma-dao-first-ever-token-permissioned-networking-chat-group-on-telegram-5feab7a54def) with their native tokens, which helped make sure that those joining the group had a certain level of skin in the game. Another feature of Collab.Land is a leaderboard that keeps track of who has contributed the most to the chat group. You could imagine token rewards distributed to those with the highest amounts of participation to reward engagement.\n\nAnother useful social token tool is [Unite Community](https://unite.community/) which allows for creators to easily distribute their tokens to followers through their social media channels and reward engagement.\n\n\n![Unite.community distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0026c774-c91d-443f-a295-161236ad0fba.jpeg)\n\nThe interesting part about social tokens is that it can represent anything from a person’s time to specialized access to collective ownership of a community. There is a lot of potential for social tokens and I expect many more creators to issue them in the future.\n\n\n### Future\n\nThese are just a few of the many use cases that are possible and have gotten some traction. There will likely be a significant increase in NFT adoption over the next several years. Traditional assets like equity getting tokenized seems like a clear progression in the future as it would make transferring them far more efficient. Then we’ll see tokenization that bridges the traditional world but adds new possibilities such as advertising space represented as an NFT where you could sell advertising rights to a site and have that be freely tradable. This would be a form of digital real estate. These NFTs would allow people to bet that a website will get a lot of traction and that the advertising space will become more valuable. Then we’ll start seeing more tokens with brand new concepts that are only made possible because of crypto which is what I’m most excited about.\n\n![Table from Will Warren’s presentation at [0xpo](https://www.0xpo.com/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8459ba6-156e-48a1-86ad-4182988bfdfc.jpeg)\n\n\nThere are a few aspects of the user experience that need to be improved in order for NFTs to become more accessible. We need to have improvements to scaling since transaction fees can make some transactions very expensive or infeasible. Scaling research is already in the works with many different teams in Ethereum working on scaling solutions and we also are seeing other blockchains being built that are catered specifically for this use case. Another point of friction with NFTs is that holders will need to self-custody them.

{"id": "WvwsHyKCjfkLoKNbNSGfoV-vaWrJa2PMYB_c3wucXUA", "title": "A beginner's guide to NFTs", "body": "### What are NFTs?\n\nNon-fungible token (NFT) is a term used to describe a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. Assets that can be represented as NFTs range from digital goods, such as items that exist within virtual worlds, to claims on physical assets such as clothing items or real estate. In the coming years, we will see NFTs used to unlock entirely new use cases that are only made possible by crypto.\n\n![**Tokens redeemable for real world goods on [Zora](https://store.zora.co/)**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9799dae1-c2c9-4712-813b-10b23c279a36.jpeg)\n\nWhile the Ethereum ecosystem is where most NFT activity has taken place to date, NFTs can exist on other smart contract platforms too. This is because, at their core, NFTs are just digital abstractions used to represent assets that are one of a kind. Non-fungible token isn’t the most intuitive term since we don’t commonly refer to the fungibility of objects in the physical world, but this is an important technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain. The goal for this post is not to detail every project within the NFT space, but to give a high level overview of what NFTs are, why they are interesting, and showcase some of their potential use cases.\n\n\n### Why are NFTs interesting?\n\nNFTs are powerful because, when combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to issue, own, and trade them. This makes interacting with NFTs significantly more efficient than in traditional platforms. The same reason why cryptocurrency used in payments is more efficient than traditional payments, that it is borderless and significantly easier to transfer, applies to NFTs. For example, if you want to create tradable in-game items as a game developer, then you can instantly have them be tradable through protocols that allow for decentralized exchange of NFTs. You don’t have to create your own marketplace or go through the onboarding process of a centralized platform in order to have the items be tradable.\n\nNFT activity can go well past trading and include actions like being able to borrow and lend, support fractional ownership (e.g. [NIFTEX](https://www.niftex.com/)), or use it as collateral in taking out a loan (e.g. [NFTfi](https://nftfi.com/)). The possibilities are endless when you have the ability to combine NFTs with DeFi building blocks. For example, the game [Aavegotchi](http://aavegotchi.com) combines DeFi and NFT gaming where each Aavegotchi character represents a user’s collateral that is deposited within the lending platform [Aave](https://aave.com/), but you can also battle the characters, level them up, and equip wearables that change their traits.\n\n![**Aavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1259686-6b61-455a-a204-f6e6da648f10.jpeg)\n\nNFTs can cover an extremely wide variety of areas given they are simply digital representations of ownership but there has been significant growth within art and gaming in particular. Note that many digital works of art and gaming items are a subset of a larger category of NFT collectibles. There is also the emerging space of social tokens, which sometimes falls into the NFT category or that is closely related to it.\n\n\n### Art\n\nNFTs can make fractionalized ownership more accessible, so if there is a valuable item that otherwise wouldn’t have been accessible for someone to own, now they can own a piece of it. Custody of a physical item still requires a trustworthy custodian, but being able to issue, hold, and trade it as a cryptoasset unlocks more use cases. One can also craft an NFT such that the creator receives a percentage of all secondary sales in a completely automated way. Artists typically don’t receive a cut of secondary sales in the traditional art world. \n\nProgrammable art is another interesting concept where a piece of artwork can incorporate on-chain data to dynamically update certain features or characteristics of the work. For example, one could create a piece of programmable art whose background changes if the price of ether goes above a certain dollar-value. There are countless creative possibilities.\n\n![**Rutger van der Tas [artwork](https://async.art/art/master/0x6c424c25e9f1fff9642cb5b7750b0db7312c29ad-83) that changes based on if it’s day or night**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a51670c0-4a1c-4aaf-917d-0e551855b56d.jpeg)\n\n[Async Art](https://async.art/) is a digital art marketplace known for programmable art. Many artists on Async sell artwork where someone is able to own the “master” copy which consists of a number of individual layers, but other people can own the individual layers and adjust their attributes over time. Imagine groups of people being able to own art collectively, where members of the group manage attributes of the work.\n\n![**Osinachi [artwork](https://async.art/art/master/0x6c424c25e9f1fff9642cb5b7750b0db7312c29ad-118) that includes a master and layers that can be individually adjusted**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fea07c75-8b3c-4592-b8f2-f5d6d92e544c.jpeg)\n\nA common question about digital artwork is what can you do with it? These works can be displayed in digital frames in a physical setting for people to enjoy. The digital artist Beeple sold physical tokens along with his digital NFTs and made [$3.5 million](https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x6e5dc5405baefb8c0166bcc78d2692777f2cbffb/21) from sales in an auction on the Nifty Gateway marketplace.\n\n![**Artist Beeple’s physical token that came with the NFT sale**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8689be31-b33f-46ac-94aa-feea3a1b3dd1.jpeg)\n\nDigital artwork can also be displayed in online collections like a [SuperRare profile](https://superrare.co/thevault/collection) as well as in virtual worlds. There are a number of art galleries within [Cryptovoxels](http://cryptovoxels.com), a virtual world where users can buy and sell land parcels as NFTs. As virtual reality spaces become more popular, having digital art to display will become more common. This wouldn’t be much different than someone spending money on video game items to customize a character’s appearance, already a multi-billion dollar industry. \n\n![**Digital art gallery in Cryptovoxels**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7386d358-d43d-4934-9ea5-b51c33932365.jpeg)\n\nA common skepticism is that someone can just take a screenshot of the image or get a digital file so it’s not really scarce. However, the same argument could apply to physical items as well. Anyone can take a photo of the Mona Lisa or create a replica of it, but it isn’t the real item from the artist. People are willing to pay a premium for the original work. Another interesting aspect of digital art or collectibles is that you can easily verify the item’s ownership history. Some digital items might be worth more depending on who owned it in the past.\n\nWith NFTs, you can also prove that the item is real and tamper proof. This is an issue in the physical collectibles space. For example, a [T206 Honus Wagner baseball card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T206_Honus_Wagner) was sold to Wayne Gretzky for $451k and sold again for several million dollars. One of the sellers of the card later admitted in court to trimming the card’s edges to make it look better. You can ensure NFT supply doesn’t change and there’s no counterfeit or continued printing. For example, there are many [counterfeit Black Lotus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAvLC3fz068&) cards in the popular game Magic: The Gathering. Common verification methods include bending the card to make sure it doesn’t crease or going through centralized grading services whose rating significantly affects the card's value. \n\n\n### Gaming\n\nSteam, a popular video game platform, has a [Community Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/?) where in-game items can be bought and sold. Steam’s marketplace is centralized and collects a transaction fee of 5% for each item from the buyer. Games like Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 take an additional fee of 10% for their items sold.\n\n\n![**Steam Community Market**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ad85fcf-b986-4b60-9fb5-925200fde3a9.jpeg)\n\n\nSteam also restricts user wallet balances to $2,000 and the price of a single item to $1,800. While these cases are outliers, many in-game items can actually sell for significantly larger amounts such as the [DotA 2 pink war dog courier](https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-06-dota-2-pink-war-dog-courier-sells-for-38-000.html) for $38,000. Within the crypto space there have also been high priced sales such as the $170,000 [CryptoKitty](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/most-expensive-cryptokitty/). Similarly Magic: The Gathering’s coveted [Black Lotus](https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/5/18251623/magic-the-gathering-black-lotus-auction-price) card sold for $166,100. There is certainly demand for valuable in-game items. In decentralized marketplaces, there isn’t a limit imposed on what game items can be sold and for what amount.\n\nDecentralized marketplaces can significantly reduce transaction fees due to the improved efficiency of starting up and operating a marketplace. Marketplaces can also improve overall user experience and increase interest in the game. Hearthstone is a wildly popular digital collectible card game created by Blizzard Entertainment that had over [100 million players](https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/hearthstone-has-over-100-million-players-1203019919/) in 2018. Hearthstone opted to not have a marketplace for their cards which leaves opportunity for other digital collectible card games that allow for an open marketplace. [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) and [SkyWeaver](https://www.skyweaver.net/) are two trading card games (TCGs) that have cards that are freely tradable. You are also able to earn cards as you level up in the game. Players that did not purchase packs of cards will still be able to improve upon the game’s default decks. It’s an exciting feeling knowing that the earned cards have real world value and can be sold or traded for other cards. Gods Unchained also lets users earn tokens for when they win a match or refer their friend. The tokens themselves unlock rare in-game items and are also freely tradable.\n\n\n![**Gods Unchained**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa82c586-39b6-46b1-ae55-cb8a2e44c8e1.jpeg)\n\n\nOne of the most popular games in crypto is [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/). You battle with a team of pet Axies and level them up. There's no aspect of the gameplay that feels like a blockchain game but there is the added benefit of being able to openly trade the Axies on NFT marketplaces such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). The game has become popular in the [Philippines](https://www.coindesk.com/nft-game-filipinos-covid) and earning tokens from the game has become a viable source of income for players even [beating minimum wage](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/07/08/axie-infinity-beats-minimum-wage-in-many-countries/) in many countries. There is also a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called [Yield Guild Games](https://yieldguild.io/) which leases Axies to players that want to get started with the game but don’t have the funds to purchase them. Several rare Axies were even [purchased](https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/why-we-spent-159k-on-digital-battle-pets-2/) for $159,000 total.\n\n\n![**Axie Infinity battle**](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/26353bcc-0d05-47ea-89ac-fcdc9d2dd848.jpeg)\n\n\nThere’s another popular game [Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/) where you can explore different planets and collect Artifact NFTs on new planets, which give bonuses when attached to the planet. Being able to discover and collect these items or even win them in a battle and then trade them in decentralized marketplaces can make the game even more fun.\n\n![Planet in Dark Forest which has an Artifact NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/be66b61a-05f0-46b7-aa8f-f7ed542d5cd3.jpeg)\n\nOne concern with making in-game items tradable is that the ability to trade items can negatively affect the gameplay as people are focused on extracting value from the system or only the players that are willing to pay a lot of money for items can enjoy the game. Diablo III had an auction house where users could trade in-game items for in-game currency and cash. It was [shut down](https://www.wired.com/2013/09/diablo-auction-house/) because of how it affected the game. It was no longer fun and rewarding since players would just buy the best loot. In Diablo III, having the best loot was essentially the goal of the game so having an auction house severely affected gameplay whereas other games are not set up this way. It’s important for game developers to find a balance on what should be freely traded for their game (e.g. skins rather than weapons, [game time](https://secure.eveonline.com/plex/) itself can be traded, etc).\n\n\n### Social tokens\n\nThe emerging area of social tokens grew significantly in 2020. Social tokens are a broad category of tokens issued by individuals and communities. This term encompasses other similar terms like personal token, community token, and creator token. So far there hasn’t been a standardized term but I will use social tokens to refer to the broader category. Social tokens enable creators and communities to have more ownership in what they are building which is extremely exciting.\n\n\n![Social tokens map created by Forefront and Seedclub in [Social Tokens Year in Review](https://2020inreview.forefront.news/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b9316db6-25dd-4c4e-bbb2-b18cfa9a7890.jpeg)\n\nEarly experiments of social tokens involved people tokenizing their time. For example [Reuben Bramanathan](https://twitter.com/bramanathan?lang=en), who previously worked on legal and product at Coinbase, tokenized his time where 1 [$CSNL](https://www.bramanathan.com/) token equaled 1 hour of his time and was freely traded. We also saw people attempting to tokenize part of their future income. Platforms like [Roll](https://tryroll.com/) and [Coinvise](https://coinvise.co/) make it easier for people to issue their own token.\n\nOne prominent example of a social token is [$RAC](https://blog.ourzora.com/home/introducing-rac), a community token by the Grammy award winning recording artist [RAC](https://twitter.com/RAC), issued through Zora. Token holders get access to a private Discord group and receive early access to merch drops with more perks to be added in the future. The token was retroactively distributed to his supporters including Bandcamp and Patreon supporters, people who had bought merch, and will eventually be distributed to all Twitch supporters. This allows creators to directly interact with and reward their early supporters.\n\nOne of the tools that enabled a new wave of social tokens was [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/), which built a Telegram and Discord bot that connects to an Ethereum wallet to verify token balance before joining a chat group. This allowed for the creation of token permissioned groups, such as [$JAMM](https://www.jammpad.com/) and [$KARMA](https://andrwlee.medium.com/announcing-karma-dao-first-ever-token-permissioned-networking-chat-group-on-telegram-5feab7a54def) with their native tokens, which helped make sure that those joining the group had a certain level of skin in the game. Another feature of Collab.Land is a leaderboard that keeps track of who has contributed the most to the chat group. You could imagine token rewards distributed to those with the highest amounts of participation to reward engagement.\n\nAnother useful social token tool is [Unite Community](https://unite.community/) which allows for creators to easily distribute their tokens to followers through their social media channels and reward engagement.\n\n\n![Unite.community distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0026c774-c91d-443f-a295-161236ad0fba.jpeg)\n\nThe interesting part about social tokens is that it can represent anything from a person’s time to specialized access to collective ownership of a community. There is a lot of potential for social tokens and I expect many more creators to issue them in the future.\n\n\n### Future\n\nThese are just a few of the many use cases that are possible and have gotten some traction. There will likely be a significant increase in NFT adoption over the next several years. Traditional assets like equity getting tokenized seems like a clear progression in the future as it would make transferring them far more efficient. Then we’ll see tokenization that bridges the traditional world but adds new possibilities such as advertising space represented as an NFT where you could sell advertising rights to a site and have that be freely tradable. This would be a form of digital real estate. These NFTs would allow people to bet that a website will get a lot of traction and that the advertising space will become more valuable. Then we’ll start seeing more tokens with brand new concepts that are only made possible because of crypto which is what I’m most excited about.\n\n![Table from Will Warren’s presentation at [0xpo](https://www.0xpo.com/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8459ba6-156e-48a1-86ad-4182988bfdfc.jpeg)\n\n\nThere are a few aspects of the user experience that need to be improved in order for NFTs to become more accessible. We need to have improvements to scaling since transaction fees can make some transactions very expensive or infeasible. Scaling research is already in the works with many different teams in Ethereum working on scaling solutions and we also are seeing other blockchains being built that are catered specifically for this use case. Another point of friction with NFTs is that holders will need to self-custody them. However this complexity can be abstracted away with user friendly wallets that make it easy to onboard and support features such as a PIN, biometrics, and social account recovery. I’m optimistic that these will get built out over time and we will see a huge wave of creativity and experimentation in the NFT space.\n\n\n### Resources\n\nHere are some additional resources to understand NFTs further and keep up with developments.\n\n\n#### Understanding NFTs\n\n\n\n*   [Quick Overview of the NFT Ecosystem](https://andrewsteinwold.substack.com/p/-quick-overview-of-the-nft-ecosystem) by Andrew Steinwold\n*   [The Non-Fungible Token Bible](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) by Devin Finzer\n*   [Social Tokens Year in Review](https://2020inreview.forefront.news/) by Cooper Turley\n\n\n#### Keeping up with NFTs\n\n\n\n*   [DeFi Arts Intelligencer newsletter](https://artsdefi.substack.com/) by William Peaster\n*   [Zima Red newsletter](https://andrewsteinwold.substack.com/) by Andrew Steinwold\n*   [Forefront newsletter](https://forefront.market/) on social tokens\n\nIf you want to get in touch about interesting NFT ideas or projects, I’m [@ljxie](https://twitter.com/ljxie) on Twitter.\n\nThanks to [Will Warren](https://twitter.com/willwarren89) and [Jordan Clifford](https://twitter.com/jcliff42) for reviewing this post.\n\n_Disclaimer: Linda Xie is a Managing Director of Scalar Capital Management, LLC, an investment manager focused on cryptoassets which holds ETH and Ethereum tokens.

Sharing value, on the other hand, has relied on pre-Internet financial and monetary infrastructure that inherited all the political and technological limitations of those underlying systems.\n\nCrypto's innovation is infusing value exchange with all the desirable attributes of a digitally-native information medium—programmability, interoperability, composability, virality, transferability. Importantly, crypto solved the one major limitation of digital mediums that previously made them unsuitable for a purely digital representation of value—scarcity guarantees.\n\nCrypto protocols therefore blur the line between information and value. They encode *value as information*, and, consequently, *information as value*. Crypto turns *media into financial assets*, and as well as *financial assets into media*.\n\nWith crypto, sending five dollars to a relative across the globe is finally as easy as sending them a family photo.\n\nThis is why with [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz), we're building a new publishing platform on top of crypto. We've seen the impact of Internet-enabled publishing over the past three decades, facilitated by the programmable spread of information. Now, it's time to run the experiment at the intersection of publishing and the programmable spread of value.\n\n*This is my new blog. Going forward, I will talk about Mirror and explore ideas at the intersection of value and information exchange in more depth here.*", "timestamp": 1609815049, "digest": "zWQLf963ibo8tPSijVTUd6e32jaPBf5lYoz9WNY0WHA", "contributor": "0x5507dbd48a5A5bAcE8a6030e878cC4E0af147C33"}
{"id": "BySmCy3caTSvrSXfLkn9881hSgZEVnxbT0VNERJoXV4", "title": "Crypto Creator Economies and Capitalism (3-min read)", "body": "There's a fabulous essay called [Naming the Nameless](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ZwGqkMTyAvANYEDw/naming-the-nameless) by [@s_r_constantin](https://twitter.com/s_r_constantin) that describes the tension between *creators* and *tastemakers*. Creators originate ideas and styles, and tastemakers *expand* the market and popularize them. In our current form of capitalism, *expanders* get a greater share of the economic value produced by this relationship, through scale and distribution - by commoditizing the invention. Here's a quote from the essay that frames and explains the problem:\n\n> ...we don't really have good tools for fairly compensating people for intellectual originality.  Intellectual property law is a kludge, with a lot of problems.  Creators don't really know how to extract \"fair market value\" for ideas, possibly because they're intrinsically motivated to create them and the kind of \"payment\" they want is more like appreciation or kindred-spirit-ness than money.  Standard startup ideology says that ideas are of low value: \"If you go to VC firms with a brilliant idea that you'll tell them about if they sign a nondisclosure agreement, most will tell you to get lost.  That shows how much a mere idea is worth. The market price is less than the inconvenience of signing an NDA.\" That may be true, but you could also interpret it as markets not knowing how to price ideas, in the same way that markets can't price natural resources until you figure out a way to define property rights over them.\n\n> So, whenever you encounter a piece of media -- words or images or music or anything representational -- no matter how many levels of imitation or expansion it's been through, you're still hearing some distant signal from its originator.  And its originator probably feels ripped off and undervalued.  When you go looking for good art, you're looking for art that's closer to its creative source, and that means you'll hear in it the voice of the frustrated creator.\n\nThe \"creator economy\", [prominently](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/cryptos-creator-model-bee11024336b) [proposed](https://a16z.com/2020/11/22/crypto-for-creators-tokenized-collectibles-nfts/) [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9EZLP_KFzo&list=PLmkdAgtxf3ahEmMWNY52BX3t1o7vb4aN5) [the](https://cryptonews.com/videos/how-blockchain-will-revolutionize-the-creator-economy-609.htm) crypto space, can solve this problem - specifically, by \"[figuring] out a way to define property rights over [ideas]\". I think Mirror can help to do this.\n\nBlockchains allow us to track the provenance of ideas, from the original creator through the expansion cycle. They also allow us to tokenize and track ideas (for example, by creating NFTs of whitepapers, articles, color schemes, etc). We can use this to prove how an idea has influenced society, and to financialize the idea itself, if desired.\n\nP.S.
