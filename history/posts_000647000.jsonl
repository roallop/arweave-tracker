{"id": "V_olJBiaFAtNdahIZNvGjtpycrQ0MtcTTv3zbzuDgVY", "title": "Forward", "body": "Do you remember the first time you used the web?\n\nOne sunny afternoon in 1994, my dad picked me up from school and brought me to his office, an advertising agency on the 14th floor of a nondescript glass cube in downtown Portland. He sat me down in front of his computer, woke it from a dream of flying toasters, and double clicked an icon labeled *Mosaic*. I was 11 years old.\n\n\"It's called the World Wide Web,\" my dad explained. \"It's like HyperCard,\" something I'd played with often enough at home on our family's Mac SE/30. \"Click the underlined words and you go to a new place.\"\n\nBefore me, through a quarter inch of CRT glass, I saw the logo of my favorite federal space agency embossed into a faux stone block. Below it, a dozen or so links to NASA's earliest internet offerings, including some classic astronomy photos and a dry letter from the administrator welcoming me to a new digital frontier (or something). I started clicking and before I knew it the sun had gone down and my dad had to physically pry me away from the keyboard. Every day following that one, using a computer that wasn't connected to the web felt like trying to fly a kite in still air.\n\nOver the next decade, I'd watch and participate in the web becoming not just a network of documents, but an application platform where the primary mode of operation was person-to-person interaction and sharing media among one another. It happened slowly, then very quickly, and then started to get buzzy names and even a new version number (2.0!) Some decried what they saw as the erosion of the web's original vision and purpose, others saw it being fulfilled.\n\nIn 2006, I dropped out of the University of Oregon, put my records in storage, and moved to Brooklyn with a girl I'd met on Flickr. I wound up hanging out with another internet photography friend who invited me to come work with him at his new startup, a [social video](https://vimeo.com) site he was designing. At the time it all seemed perfectly natural, I wasn't yet thinking about how the web had profoundly shaped the course of my life. It was hard to imagine anything before it. Do fish remember not being able to swim?\n\nI spent the next ten years in New York thinking about, designing, and building social media applications. A lot changed, but it mostly didn't. Nothing felt like that first time with Mosaic, or the first time I put my own photos online using HTML I'd written myself. At some point, I stopped expecting it to.\n\nLately, I'm feeling that way again for a third time. It happened slowly, then very quickly, and then started to get buzzy names and even a new version number (3.0!) Some decry what they see as the erosion of the web's original vision and purpose, others see it being fulfilled. I'm one of the latter, and I hope to use this platform to document what I see unfolding as the most exciting time on the internet in more than a decade, and maybe share a few tales from the previous eras along the way.\n\nThank you for joining me :)\n\n@jstn", "timestamp": 1616014804, "digest": "y2obU55QyWxZxHHXlQlKGh6gEvshv8lqGIIlGPq5S7s", "contributor": "0xE7bd51Dc30d4bDc9FDdD42eA7c0a283590C9D416"}

I invite you to set aside 9 minutes and watch it full-screen. You might enjoy using headphones or your favorite speakers.\n\n**Note: this embed widget isn't currently playing the audio. While I fix it, please [click through to the linked NFT](https://zora.co/gold/1082) to hear the content!**\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7/1082)\n\nPatron: [Yaniv Tal](https://twitter.com/yanivgraph)\n\nThe meta-story is that this is an experiment in patronage. Please enjoy the piece first: it was intended as an [audiovisual experience](https://zora.co/gold/1082) but for those who prefer text (or want to quote me), a full text transcription follows. When you're done, we'll talk about the meta-story surrounding it in the Afterword section.\n\n### The version using text\n\nWhat a moment we find ourselves in.\n\nA moment where we are being presented with the opportunity to write a new mythology for our civilization. We're being granted the opportunity to do that together, with the role of art & music & creativity at the center point. We're getting the opportunity to ask what happens if we take seriously the role of art & artists & the people who make our culture.  \n\nThis isn't hypothetical wondering about what a utopia might be like; this isn’t a fantastical utopia that is out of reach. This is an opportunity for us to get to decide what we will build together in our lifetimes with no one to stop us but ourselves.  \n\nAnd so this is the question: whether or not we value art and music. I can tell you the answer for myself. For myself, I wouldn't be here had I not reconnected with my own humble and vulnerable creative connection. We're not asking for celebrities, for people to put on MTV, for people to put on pedestals, or for people to throw awards at: that's not what this is about anymore.  \n\nThis is about recognizing that the human capacity for raw self expression is the biggest gift that we could have been given, and is the reason that we're on this planet in the first place. Our individual, humble, creativity is how God expresses themselves in the universe. Before I lose too many people by saying the “G” word: I mean God  as in the energy. I don't mean, an old white dude with a big white beard up in the sky wagging his finger at you. Although, if that's what you believe, I'm not going to stop you from believing that either.  \n\nI mean, God as an extra dimensional, infinite form of the purest, purest love. Of the most powerful unity between everything in the universe; between every human on this planet; between every sentient being in every corner of the universe; in every molecule of carbon; between here and wherever those depths are. And that's just in this dimension! We're talking about creativity, love & unity that span, far, far beyond & far deeper than those affectations of time that we believe to be so permanent. That's the God I'm talking about. Let's get back to talking about creativity, we can go back into that some other time!  \n\nI believe that God & source energy & love & unity & creativity are the same thing. These are my spiritual beliefs—you don't have to take them—but I know I'm not the only one who believes this: that creative energy; the energy that we feel when we're in the zone & making something we love to do is as close to God as we'll ever see. It is the same energy: of flow states & of peak experiences. That's what All Of This is.  \n\nAnd so we have a responsibility, as I see it, to reconstruct our society in a way that honors this. In a way that says, \"Yes! Your art is valid!\"; that says, “Yes! Your music is valid!”; that says “Yes! Every hobby, every interest you have that capitalism has told you isn't a _real job_ is the most real thing you could be doing”.  \n\nThat's what this spring is going to be about: inventing new mythologies for our civilization that says “your art is valid”; that say “your art, is not only real work. It is the realest work that you could do”.  \n\nAnd we’re creating a culture in which we celebrate and support people to do the things that they are here to do.  \n\n### Afterword  \n\nIf you follow my work closely, you may have already seen the NFT of the audiovisual version of this piece [on Zora](https://zora.co/gold/1082) a few weeks ago. [Yaniv Tal](https://twitter.com/yanivgraph) was the first person to own the NFT, and I want to thank him for his ongoing support of my work.  \n\nRecently I've been [tweeting](https://twitter.com/jongold) a _lot_ about NFTs representing a paradigm of __Private Patronage of Public-Enjoyed Work__. We are used to property being a private resource, and early media narratives around NFTs suggest that they represent a kind of \"artificial digital scarcity\". Instead, I believe in the inside-out notion that by being a patron of an NFT you're enabling _everyone_ to enjoy it. Rather than a contrived constriction on the flow of information, interdependent patronage allows for communal abundance.  \n\nThis exploratory format of audiovisual essays has a tradeoff: they're not inclusive for folks who are hard of hearing or can't understand my accent. I'm a musician and want to experiment with this new format for my words, and yet providing inaccessible content is unacceptable for me.   \n\nI didn't write any notes before I recorded the spoken word piece, and cheap, AI-powered transcription services don't understand my voice. Providing inaccurate computer-generated captions (as on YouTube and other websites) doesn't feel like a benefit to me, yet doing them by hand is very time consuming. Instead of spending hours of creative time transcribing this piece myself, Yaniv's patronage allowed me to pay for a high-quality human transcription. I happily used the time I saved to make art instead, and with the publishing of the text version I am satisfied that there is now an accessible alternative for people who can't listen to the audio version.  \n\nThere are many more implications of __Private Patronage of Public-Enjoyed Work__ which I intend to experiment with in all of my work across the metaverse, & write about here. For now, I am grateful for Yaniv's contribution in providing the transcription for everyone, and for freeing me up to make more art instead of typing it myself. At a meta-level I hope this inspires your own experiments with patronage; I am excited to read your own findings on the process.  \n\nLastly: at the time of writing, Yaniv is the current owner of this piece on Zora, but if you appreciated either the piece itself or what it represents as a public experiment in patronage you can [make Yaniv an offer for it](https://zora.co/gold/1082) and I get a portion of the sale. We can talk more about how Zora works and why it's cool at a later time: for now I want to offer this as another example of sustainable, ongoing, communal patronage.  \n\nWith so much gratitude,  \nJon", "timestamp": 1616091061, "digest": "FQeuCkj2OXQG7IEt4Zgti01va4p4Hi0tDYB1n_Ch68k", "contributor": "0x88D01d4354DA0D65C38b0196c4400525A5eebe17"}
