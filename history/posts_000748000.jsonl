Pudgy Pengins (not a typo) [was just featured](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/penguin-nft-club.html) in the NYT, the cheapest CryptoPunk to buy is now $145K, and OpenSea—with $775M in volume this month after just 13 days—is on pace to do more volume in August than all other months combined.

This can be overwhelming at times, so to help investors make a bit more sense of it all, I decided to aggregate a list of my favorite indicators that I personally use to evaluate NFT projects:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/spencernoon/status/1426187363609456645?s=20\n\nIf you’re interested in the NFT space, I’d love to hear your feedback on the indicators listed here.

As futures take flight within DeFi, a more interesting question is: how much of the perp swap market has Perpetual Protocol taken over time? For the high-cap names, Perpetual Protocol took 0.2% and 0.05% market share at its peak for ETH and BTC respectively before declining in line with trading volumes. DeFi assets have been taking larger market shares overall. DeFi asset perpetuals are finding product-market-fit in DeFi itself.

{"id": "WECwCQcGsuBc3epkyqYDF7FJuyXUCexGdE7vKpmOdKY", "title": "Algorithmic Insurance", "body": "The idea of Decentralized Insurance has been one of the shining examples for ideal use-cases of blockchain applications. Insurance providers may have incentives to withhold claims for as long as possible, and users have little transparency into the process — leading to an overall poor user experience. The idea of putting these insurance processes on-chain is an appealing one: insurance claims are programatically & immediately paid out if some conditions are met, and everyone has full transparency on the state of the entire system at all times. For example, someone could buy travel insurance for their flight, and a smart contract could automatically payout if Google Flights reports that the flight was delayed. \n\nMany attempts at decentralized insurance have been tried over the years, but anything that touches the real world has not gotten much traction at all. Firstly, there are many concerns around getting *trustworthy* data on-chain — if a contract can be maliciously fed data that says a hurricane happened when it didn't, that on-chain weather insurance market is as good as useless. Secondly, the current set of Ethereum/DeFi users are not generally looking for vehicle/household/travel insurance on-chain – they are looking for something more *crypto-native*. \n\n# Smart Contract Insurance\n\nThe immense growth of DeFi in the last two years has single-handedly revived market demand for decentralized insurance products. Many individuals or funds have significant amounts of capital in these DeFi protocols, and *actually* want protection against smart contract exploits. \n\nThe most interesting thing about insurance markets on smart contract security is that they *may* be able function without requiring off-chain data. The implications of this is that we may be able to construct insurance markets that resolve by simply checking some state of a smart contract on-chain – zero humans or trusted parties required. Hence the name \"algorithmic\" insurance. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/0xSisyphus/status/1415294150333841408\n\n\n# How do they work?
