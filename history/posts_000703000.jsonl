Thankfully we have the shorthand. But it is important to understand what digital asset mining is.\n\nPublic blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, store data securely but publicly in a cooperative ecosystem that is not controlled by any company or government. When you store data on a public blockchain, it is your data, secured by your keys, and nobody can do anything to it without your approval.\n\nThat is a big deal and it is the future of all internet data. In time, all software systems will operate on top of secure public blockchains.\n\nThe consensus mechanism in public blockchains is the method that they use to cooperatively validate transactions without a controlling party.\n\nProof of work consensus is when computers all over the world run software (called nodes) and validate transactions and are rewarded with digital assets (tokens).\n\nSo proof of work mining and its cousins like proof of stake validating is the foundational infrastructure for the coming architecture for internet data.\n\nThink of Bitcoin mining operations as the next Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Cloud offerings except that they are owned by everyone.\n\nThat’s a huge deal. As big of a deal as anything in tech and tech policy right now.\n\nOk. Now that we’ve had that discussion, let’s talk about [a bill under consideration by the New York State Legislature](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/A7389) that would put a three-year moratorium on proof of work mining in New York State. I had thought that this bill was going nowhere as of last weekend, but it seems to be back on the table now.\n\nI am a fan of regulation on the emerging blockchain and crypto sectors. Anything as important as the next generation of internet data architecture needs regulation.\n\nBut this New York State bill is like using a sledgehammer when what is needed is a scalpel.\n\nThree years is a long time in a fast growing emerging tech sector. The foundational infrastructure for public blockchains is being built now and regions that get going now will have long lasting businesses that provide good jobs and lots of growth. Who wouldn’t want Google, Amazon, and Microsoft operating their data centers in their state? This is the next generation of that.\n\nThe issue that has everyone up in arms is the carbon footprint of proof of work mining and that is something that is [important to discuss](https://avc.com/2021/03/crypto-and-climate/) and using regulation to address it makes sense. It may well be that proof of work consensus has no larger carbon footprint than the data centers of the cloud era, but that’s not really the point. We can and should do better. We can have a climate-neutral data architecture when we build the next-generation tech stack.\n\nSo here is what I think would be better policy for New York State:\n\n1/ Apply a tax surcharge to digital mining operations in New York State that use fossil fuels to power them.\n\n2/ Use those tax revenues to subsidize digital mining operations in New York State that use clean (renewable, nuclear, etc) energy to power them.\n\n3/ Encourage digital asset mining in New York State with other policies that will bring the data centers here vs elsewhere.\n\n4/ Become the home to the cleanest and largest digital asset mining operations in the world.\n\nWe can do that New York State. We just need to want to.\n", "timestamp": 1623156333, "digest": "py7SI5eTMV-XV7fzorWTLQkaFf6xuDO5yybhotWT7j8", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}
{"id": "7iKDA2t5hNJP2wYJ0qtAugyZKHCbn6kqXtylyvIDJTo", "title": "Why the Dirt NFT Campaign Succeeded\n", "body": "## Summary\n\nOn May 27th, I [launched a campaign](https://air.mirror.xyz/lmV9Dxeos9HvKSu0BKY9pqARK2vAlPXhrNMt68E4GkI) to fund the daily entertainment [newsletter Dirt](https://dirt.substack.com) using NFTs. In short, all the NFTs and editions have sold out, raising 12.23 ETH, or a bit over $30,000. (131 NFTs in total.)\n\nThis is a breakdown of what happened, what I learned from the process, and what steps might be taken going forward. \n\nIf you’re a collector of a Dirt NFT, please fill out the [survey here](https://forms.gle/LJaVjB2Z38bCXSko7) so we can contact you and get feedback on the campaign! \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3309)\n\n## What Happened\n\nWith the help of Mirror, we created three different NFT offerings: an edition of 100 for .05 ETH, an edition of 30 for .2 ETH, and an auction for a single, unique NFT. Every single NFT has been bought, so 131 total were sold, with around 115 buyers, since multiples were bought by the same accounts (and I bought one, too). Each NFT also came with a proportional amount of $DIRT-S1 tokens: 50, 200, and 1000. \n\nThe auction sold first (Dirty s1 Rainbow Wave), then the edition of 30 (Dirty s1 Pearl Pink) and finally the edition of 100 (Dirty s1 Pea Green) in around a week after the auction launched. That speaks to the success of the pricing strategy: a week is about the ideal amount of time for the campaign to sell out. But the fact that the Pearl Pink NFTs sold out so quickly suggests that they might have been priced a little too low. \n\nThe 12.23 ETH is a good amount of funding to pay for a “season” of Dirt: what we’re calling two months’ worth of content. (To me it seems like a relatively low amount for the crypto economy overall.) When we use up that amount of funding, we’ll have to do another NFT campaign, with a $DIRT-S2 token. \n\nWith the success of the campaign, Dirt can afford to pay rates competitive with the largest digital media publications ($1 / word) for the upcoming season of content and highlight new writers in addition to the 25+ people we’ve already published. Dirt publishes content that literally doesn't fit anywhere else, because of the freedom offered by the funding. \n\n## The Buyers\n\nThe two editions targeted two types of buyers: .05 ETH is doable for new users of cryptocurrency, wallets, and NFTs. The roughly $130 price is a significant decision but not more than one might pay for a design object or physical art edition. I think that new buyers understand that cryptocurrencies and NFTs have significant value — after the mega sales by Beeple and others — so $130 doesn’t feel totally illogical to them. It’s a test run to see if they’ll have fun in this market. Many friends and readers of the newsletter told me they purchased at this level, both as a way to have fun and to participate in the crowdfunding campaign, to support the newsletter. \n\nThe .2 ETH edition of 30 seemed to net more pre-existing NFT buyers who might already have ETH in a wallet. Notably, the [Seed Club DAO](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq) bought five of that edition — perhaps seeing it as an investment that will pay off later. (Buying multiple NFTs was the only way to get more tokens, since we didn’t do a direct token sale.) There also seemed to be a higher percentage of anonymous wallet addresses buying the edition, participating in the project but not necessarily publicly. \n\nMomentum for the edition sales wasn’t immediate, though I felt that it happened quite quickly. It took some time for the launch announcement to percolate and it spread primarily on Twitter, with various cryptocurrency, tech industry / VC, and media people sharing it. The sense of novelty, that this is the first newsletter (a buzzy media format) funded by NFTs, helped it get shared. The Mirror announcement is kind of a dry format for a NFT campaign; I think more visually compelling sites could be made, with the Mirror post acting as a white paper. \n\nTo sell editions, there’s a need for more excitement to be generated by the launch itself, though it helped that I later wrote a Dirt newsletter and sent it to our list of 3,800 subscribers, explaining it in a shorter and simper way. For NFTs, not as many buyers need to know about tokens or future financing plans; they want to know more about the NFTs and the artist who created them, what they represent.  \n\nThe auction sold for 1.23 ETH to [@niftytime](https://twitter.com/niftytime), clearly a crypto and NFT insider. It could perhaps have raised more money: We capped the token release at 1000 for the auction buyer, wanting a more spread-out distribution of the total tokens for this initial season. But a higher token release could have motivated more bids for the single NFT. The $DIRT-S1 token is not funding an entire company or project, however, just a short run of it, like a Kickstart campaign for specific content, so giving away too many tokens to one holder may not make sense.\n\nI’d like to know more about the buyers’ motivations. I’m sure some of them bought the NFT for fun and enjoyment, simply appreciating its art and connection to the newsletter. Others likely bought NFTs as investment, betting that their price might go up, or because they think the token will have value in the future, with proceeds from future NFTs and the ability to participate in Dirt feedback.  \n\n## Secondary Market\n\nSince the editions have all totally sold out, there’s now no way to buy Dirt NFTs from Dirt itself — they are gone, though the art and the content are still public. That sense of scarcity is totally different from other forms of online content; it’s like hitting a paywall that you can’t get through, even if you want to pay the price. It creates a sense of exclusivity and FOMO: if you now want to get into the Dirt ecosystem, you’ll have to pay higher than the sticker price. \n\nVery soon after the NFTs sold out, a 30/30 Dirty s1 Pearl Pink edition was [offered on Opensea for 20 ETH](https://opensea.io/assets/0x3725ca6034bcdbc3c9ada649d49df68527661175/91), or ~$56,000, a 100x markup. That kind of price rise would be absurd in the art world, especially for an edition, but it seems almost possible in the world of NFTs. Two Dirty s1 Pea Green editions (100/100) have been put up for sale as well, at 0.15 ETH and 1 ETH — 3x and 20x respectively. I don’t think anyone has bought a Dirt edition on the secondary market yet, but maybe I don’t know where to look. The transfer would certainly exist on the blockchain. \n\nThe initial Mirror editions do not include the usual 15% resale fee for creators, but I would be sure to change that for future editions. The auction NFT, minted on Zora, does have the 15%. The resale fee is vital for the long-term survival of the NFT-based media company because it represents the company’s ownership of its assets, like a licensing fee; each time a NFT is sold, the company would get some revenue. Thus a thriving marketplace of Dirt NFTs would fully fund the publication itself, without needing to mint new NFTs (with the positive effect of maintaining scarcity). \n\nYou can see the Opensea [Dirt secondary market here](https://opensea.io/assets?search[query]=dirty%20s1&search[sortAscending]=false&search[sortBy]=LISTING_DATE). \n\n## Designing the NFTs\n\nThe aesthetic qualities of the NFTs were very important to the Dirt project. That separates the Dirt NFTs from some of the other projects on Mirror, which create NFTs well after the token crowdfund and in some cases are limited to the artifact that is being created itself, like a NFT of Emily Segal’s novel or a NFT representing a single article. Instead, the Dirt crowdfund NFTs exist as art in their own right and are immediately enjoyable. When you participate in the campaign, you’re already getting a reward that’s not just the token, like if you got a tote bag immediately for funding a Kickstarter.\n\n[Dirty S1 Pearl Pink](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=3)\n\nThe Dirt NFT art shows off the newsletter’s mascot, Dirty — kind of a cartoon character, but goofy and a little gross. Dirty is absurdist, dadaist in its blatant meaninglessness — and that is the brand. After developing an initial design with the artist [Jason Adam Katzenstein](https://www.instagram.com/j.a.k._/?hl=en), I worked with the interactive designer and animator [Mark Costello](http://markalancostello.com/) to produce animated GIFs of Dirty. The inspirations we came up with were GIFs from Studio Ghibli’s Spirited Away and collectibles like Pokemon Cards. The result is a visual vocabulary that feels familiar and compelling, maybe a little nostalgic, even though it doesn’t come from a pre-established source: It’s a newly created aesthetic world. \n\nThe Dirty NFTs have the cel-shading of anime and the gradient backgrounds of holographic Pokemon cards, or Cory Arcangel’s [gradient artworks](https://ropac.net/artists/25-cory-arcangel/works/11539/). The detailed animation makes the image feel worthwhile and expensive, while the varying gradient became a way to make the different editions visually distinct. Pea Green, the 100/100 edition, is an earthy, relatively mundane color gradient, green to yellow, like a vegetable. It feels more common. Pearl Pink, the 30/30 edition, goes from pink to gold, reminiscent of iridescent pearls — a higher-end, fancier, pricier kind of symbolism fit for a more expensive image. The Rainbow Wave auction piece was a riot of rainbows in the background with a curving line through them. Visually it feels like the peak of the series, symbolic of its one-of-a-kind status.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a190b56-a8e9-4bb4-8d28-2ebffdc6fdd6.jpeg?height=675&width=1200)\n\nI think the naming of the NFTs was also important. Like a clothing colorway or streetwear drop, the names gave buyers a vocabulary to talk about what they were buying. Maybe Pea Green is more appealing to you than Pearl Pink; maybe you discuss them by their names when trying to decide what to buy. The material words attached some real-world references to the digital images and the fictional character of Dirty. “Dirty s1” is also important: The s1 comes from the shorthand naming mechanism of streaming television, particularly piracy sites, where you might look up a show by its season number in the file name: Succession s02. It implies a limit to this season and future seasons to come.\n\n## Why the NFT Campaign Worked\n\nI think the Dirt NFT campaign worked because the newsletter already had an audience and a visual brand; the NFTs came from that visual brand and expanded it; and the token underlying the NFTs potentially had future value. Partly, the campaign worked well as a simple crowdfund, that could have been executed on Kickstarter or other platforms. But the NFTs give participants more involvement in the project and in the brand going forward, keeping them engaged. They’re also more compelling in the context of the internet, which is where the newsletter exists. We don’t need physical swag for a digital experience. \n\nFunding media with NFTs is a new proposition; editorial and publishing companies haven’t incorporated digital assets yet. Dirt is providing an accessible entrypoint into this world for writers and readers because we are demystifying it for them. That will include breaking down the environmental impacts of blockchain technology and NFTs as we commission reports on those subjects, offering more education for readers and transparency for the publication. \n\nThe campaign also worked becaused the art was cool and has a cool narrative, going beyond the realm of NFTs. There’s a story to tell with Dirty and a story that the evolving editorial of the publication will tell. Throughout the season, we will continue developing those stories. \n\n## Connecting NFTs to Content\n\nRight now, we have two relatively separate bodies of content: the NFTs, which exist on Mirror, Opensea, and other platforms, and the newsletter editorial, which primarily exists on Substack and in readers’ inboxes. There’s a challenge of bringing the NFTs and the editorial together, not just through visual proximity but through storytelling. First, we will integrate the Dirty visuals more strongly into the newsletter formatting, reminding viewers that it’s also part of the brand. \n\nMirror is one of the only platforms that can combine editorial and NFTs in a seamless way, with the blocks for sales and auctions. However, Mirror needs more functionality with newsletters and feeds to fully replace Substack. It would be helpful to have more options to embed NFTs in the content, in different arrangements or formats. (Substack initially blocked links to NFT sales through a spam filter glitch, but if Substack doesn’t support cryptocurrency functionality it may find itself losing some ground.)\n\nWould it make sense to have a new NFT or edition in every newsletter, or every week? Those NFTs wouldn’t be as complex as the animated Dirty, but they would provide funding and be a symbol of participation in Dirt. Currently, I think it makes more sense to create flashier NFTs for each season of Dirt and generate excitement around those campaigns; it also removes the pressure for readers to pitch in money with every single post. The season funding round should last the whole season, with a few bonuses and surprises thrown in for fun. \n\nThere also needs to be more ways for collectors to show off their purchases, beyond linking to them on Opensea or other marketplaces, or posting a Rainbow portfolio link. NFTs might be the “in-game items of the internet” but as-is there are few ways to actually use the items. Collectors can display which Dirt assets they’ve collected, but that doesn’t actually integrate with Dirt itself. Maybe we would highlight a collector, or highlight the buyers of a particular edition. Ideally, it could be something like an Animal Crossing island: You use your NFTs to decorate, they could load as decoration in the newsletter or something similar.\n\nWe are creating a metaverse-style Dirtyverse that includes the newsletter, the art editions, the community, and any other projects that arise, all linked together by the visual brand and the mascot — a form of IP. \n\n[Dirty S1 Pea Green](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=2)\n\n## Engaging the Collectors \n\nA problem with the current Mirror crowdfunding model is that there isn’t a direct, easy way to communicate with the people who participated in the campaign. We used disperse.app to send the $DIRT-S1 tokens to the NFT buyers, but that only uses the wallet addresses. Mirror connects the wallet addresses and Twitter accounts, but not everyone uses Twitter or wants to be reached there. In the future, we’ll have a Discord only accessible to token holders. It would also be helpful to have an email list of all the collectors who want to be engaged, so we can reach them about NFT sales, token participation, etc. \n\nI also think that a token-holder paywall system could be useful. A Mirror publication could be gated based on if you hold the tokens in your wallet. That would be an easy way to publish updates on the crowdfund or Dirt spending. Mirror could also open up its $WRITE Race voting system so that token holders can make decisions as a group. \n\nDirt will highlight the Pearl Pink collectors in the newsletter itself, listing them by name, website, Twitter handle, or just wallet address. This is a way both for collectors to be recognized and readers to understand where the funding comes from for the newsletter, demonstrating that it’s powered by NFTs and tokens. \n\nEngaged collectors will also drive the market for future Dirt NFTs. Our primary customers are the people who have already bought in to our artistic world; the people who own the NFTs also have an incentive for the NFTs to be valued at higher prices and for more people to buy in to the future editions. At the same time, we want to preserve the sense of exclusivity and deepen collectors’ relationships with Dirt and Dirty. \n\n## Implications for Media Companies \n\nNFTs as a business model have to be designed in to the form and content of a media company or publication. They should not just be added on in the sense of creating NFTs of specific articles or releasing NFTs of covers. These digital assets are a language and vocabulary all their own; the best analog is not collectible art but in-app purchases where the purchases deepen the customers’ relationship and engagement with the brand. \n\nA newsletter is a good way to test out NFTs; an entire newspaper or website is not. NFTs need context to make sense — they have to create a self-contained universe and a visual language in order to drive a market for the assets. The range of possible NFTs in a series cannot be infinite; they need to demonstrate progression. Many journalistic media companies are not up to this challenge, though their business model is telling stories. It’s harder to tell a coherent story about yourself, or come up with original intellectual property. Journalistic media companies are also rarely visual-driven, more often using photography than illustration. A strong preexisting visual brand will make adapting to NFTs easier and more effective. It’s as if every publication is also an art gallery. \n\nAgain, if you are a Dirt NFT collector and want to give us some feedback and be contacted in the future, fill out this survey https://forms.gle/jB1RPnmoBZEqXJR66\n\n## Support Dirt\n\nYou can now no longer buy Dirt NFTs on the primary market. Someone buying a Pearl Pink for 20 ETH or Pea Green for 1 ETH on the secondary market would be hilarious, so please do that, even though we don’t get any of the fee. Otherwise, just subscribe to the newsletter and watch out for the next NFT campaign, in 3 months or so. \n\nIf you want to buy $DIRT-S1 tokens at an enormous premium, let me know.

Visually it feels like the peak of the series, symbolic of its one-of-a-kind status.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a190b56-a8e9-4bb4-8d28-2ebffdc6fdd6.jpeg?height=675&width=1200)\n\nI think the naming of the NFTs was also important. Like a clothing colorway or streetwear drop, the names gave buyers a vocabulary to talk about what they were buying. Maybe Pea Green is more appealing to you than Pearl Pink; maybe you discuss them by their names when trying to decide what to buy. The material words attached some real-world references to the digital images and the fictional character of Dirty. “Dirty s1” is also important: The s1 comes from the shorthand naming mechanism of streaming television, particularly piracy sites, where you might look up a show by its season number in the file name: Succession s02. It implies a limit to this season and future seasons to come.\n\n## Why the NFT Campaign Worked\n\nI think the Dirt NFT campaign worked because the newsletter already had an audience and a visual brand; the NFTs came from that visual brand and expanded it; and the token underlying the NFTs potentially had future value. Partly, the campaign worked well as a simple crowdfund, that could have been executed on Kickstarter or other platforms. But the NFTs give participants more involvement in the project and in the brand going forward, keeping them engaged. They’re also more compelling in the context of the internet, which is where the newsletter exists. We don’t need physical swag for a digital experience. \n\nFunding media with NFTs is a new proposition; editorial and publishing companies haven’t incorporated digital assets yet. Dirt is providing an accessible entrypoint into this world for writers and readers because we are demystifying it for them. That will include breaking down the environmental impacts of blockchain technology and NFTs as we commission reports on those subjects, offering more education for readers and transparency for the publication. \n\nThe campaign also worked becaused the art was cool and has a cool narrative, going beyond the realm of NFTs. There’s a story to tell with Dirty and a story that the evolving editorial of the publication will tell. Throughout the season, we will continue developing those stories. \n\n## Connecting NFTs to Content\n\nRight now, we have two relatively separate bodies of content: the NFTs, which exist on Mirror, Opensea, and other platforms, and the newsletter editorial, which primarily exists on Substack and in readers’ inboxes. There’s a challenge of bringing the NFTs and the editorial together, not just through visual proximity but through storytelling. First, we will integrate the Dirty visuals more strongly into the newsletter formatting, reminding viewers that it’s also part of the brand. \n\nMirror is one of the only platforms that can combine editorial and NFTs in a seamless way, with the blocks for sales and auctions. However, Mirror needs more functionality with newsletters and feeds to fully replace Substack. It would be helpful to have more options to embed NFTs in the content, in different arrangements or formats. (Substack initially blocked links to NFT sales through a spam filter glitch, but if Substack doesn’t support cryptocurrency functionality it may find itself losing some ground.)\n\nWould it make sense to have a new NFT or edition in every newsletter, or every week? Those NFTs wouldn’t be as complex as the animated Dirty, but they would provide funding and be a symbol of participation in Dirt. Currently, I think it makes more sense to create flashier NFTs for each season of Dirt and generate excitement around those campaigns; it also removes the pressure for readers to pitch in money with every single post. The season funding round should last the whole season, with a few bonuses and surprises thrown in for fun. \n\nThere also needs to be more ways for collectors to show off their purchases, beyond linking to them on Opensea or other marketplaces, or posting a Rainbow portfolio link. NFTs might be the “in-game items of the internet” but as-is there are few ways to actually use the items. Collectors can display which Dirt assets they’ve collected, but that doesn’t actually integrate with Dirt itself. Maybe we would highlight a collector, or highlight the buyers of a particular edition. Ideally, it could be something like an Animal Crossing island: You use your NFTs to decorate, they could load as decoration in the newsletter or something similar.\n\nWe are creating a metaverse-style Dirtyverse that includes the newsletter, the art editions, the community, and any other projects that arise, all linked together by the visual brand and the mascot — a form of IP. \n\n[Dirty S1 Pea Green](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=2)\n\n## Engaging the Collectors \n\nA problem with the current Mirror crowdfunding model is that there isn’t a direct, easy way to communicate with the people who participated in the campaign. We used disperse.app to send the $DIRT-S1 tokens to the NFT buyers, but that only uses the wallet addresses. Mirror connects the wallet addresses and Twitter accounts, but not everyone uses Twitter or wants to be reached there. In the future, we’ll have a Discord only accessible to token holders. It would also be helpful to have an email list of all the collectors who want to be engaged, so we can reach them about NFT sales, token participation, etc. \n\nI also think that a token-holder paywall system could be useful. A Mirror publication could be gated based on if you hold the tokens in your wallet. That would be an easy way to publish updates on the crowdfund or Dirt spending. Mirror could also open up its $WRITE Race voting system so that token holders can make decisions as a group. \n\nDirt will highlight the Pearl Pink collectors in the newsletter itself, listing them by name, website, Twitter handle, or just wallet address. This is a way both for collectors to be recognized and readers to understand where the funding comes from for the newsletter, demonstrating that it’s powered by NFTs and tokens. \n\nEngaged collectors will also drive the market for future Dirt NFTs. Our primary customers are the people who have already bought in to our artistic world; the people who own the NFTs also have an incentive for the NFTs to be valued at higher prices and for more people to buy in to the future editions. At the same time, we want to preserve the sense of exclusivity and deepen collectors’ relationships with Dirt and Dirty. \n\n## Implications for Media Companies \n\nNFTs as a business model have to be designed in to the form and content of a media company or publication. They should not just be added on in the sense of creating NFTs of specific articles or releasing NFTs of covers. These digital assets are a language and vocabulary all their own; the best analog is not collectible art but in-app purchases where the purchases deepen the customers’ relationship and engagement with the brand. \n\nA newsletter is a good way to test out NFTs; an entire newspaper or website is not. NFTs need context to make sense — they have to create a self-contained universe and a visual language in order to drive a market for the assets. The range of possible NFTs in a series cannot be infinite; they need to demonstrate progression. Many journalistic media companies are not up to this challenge, though their business model is telling stories. It’s harder to tell a coherent story about yourself, or come up with original intellectual property. Journalistic media companies are also rarely visual-driven, more often using photography than illustration. A strong preexisting visual brand will make adapting to NFTs easier and more effective. It’s as if every publication is also an art gallery. \n\n## If you’re a collector of a Dirt NFT, please fill out the [survey here](https://forms.gle/LJaVjB2Z38bCXSko7) so we can contact you and get feedback on the campaign! https://forms.gle/LJaVjB2Z38bCXSko7\n\n## Support Dirt\n\nYou can now no longer buy Dirt NFTs on the primary market. Someone buying a Pearl Pink for 20 ETH or Pea Green for 1 ETH on the secondary market would be hilarious, so please do that, even though we don’t get any of the fee. Otherwise, just subscribe to the newsletter and watch out for the next NFT campaign, in 3 months or so. \n\nIf you want to buy $DIRT-S1 tokens at an enormous premium, let me know.

I picked it up to take a quick look and thought “this a heavy book!”\n\nSo I texted Matt, congratulated him on getting the book out, and then asked why it was so heavy.

{"id": "KODBp65MyZ3_9H4Yzr13yZuY7IIrefZ7q4gvvE81Zus", "title": "Two young digital artists are swimming along when someone says to them \"morning, how're the NFTs?\"", "body": "## What the hell's an NFT?\n\nYou might know this nice fable recounted by David Foster Wallace in a famous commencement address:\n\n> There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”\n\nWhen you first read this, **you might think the point of the story is that the young fish are basically idiots** who don’t understand something obvious. So maybe, here in an essay proclaiming to be about NFTs, it might seem like we are setting the stage for a lesson like “lots of people don’t know what NFTs are even though it’s simple: NFTs are just ____________.”\n\nQuite the opposite!\n\nI’ll contend that you probably do know what NFTs are. But most everyone you disagree about them probably does too. [And but so](https://ambiguities.wordpress.com/2008/09/20/the-and-but-so/) when people say “it’s simple: NFTs are just _________”, perhaps filling in the blanks variously with “property titles” or “status signals” or \"examples of crudely mimetic speculation\" or “pointers to a file” or “the artist’s signature” they’re probably right. Except for the word “just.”[1] \n\nAnd I will try to prove it to you by drawing on an old study about -- what else? -- water.\n\n## \"What the hell is water?\"\n\nBelieve it or not, the answer to \"what is water?\" isn't simple at all. And perhaps summarizing evidence on this can help us all remain NFT value pluralists, especially here in these early experimental days. While it may be exciting and thought-provoking to speculate on what \"NFTs actually are\", the example of water can remind us just how complex and surprising a truly good answer might be. \n\nGoing back to the parable about the fish, suppose that instead of just swimming away one of the younger fish stops and musters the courage to ask the older fish, “wait, so what *is* water?” What would the older fish say? Maybe, **“Oh water? That’s just H2O”**. \n\n\"Just H2O\" feels like the rigorous answer, but it turns out not to be true. Or rather, it's true except for the word \"just.\" [A remarkable experiment by B.C. Malt](https://philpapers.org/rec/MALWIN) asked subjects to classify various liquids as being “water” or “not water” while also asking them to guess the H2O content. \n\nTables 1 and 2 report the results and the findings are instructive. There are a variety of things which the subjects class as “water” despite having substantially less H2O content than items classed as “non-water.”\n\n### Table 1: A Selection of items classed as “non-water” that have high H2O\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a4ae5c10-0790-44ef-8a02-2a42e6848fe4.jpeg?height=186&width=1104)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ad915fb5-924b-47bb-a1d9-1f4824753dce.jpeg?height=258&width=1088)\n\n### Table 2: A Selection of items classed as “water” that have lower H2O\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cfd865e8-5c1a-40e2-b080-e3f1a9659bae.jpeg?height=312&width=1100)\n\nThese findings point us to the complexity of our commonsense understandings -- if I dip a teabag into a mug of water it becomes tea, but if I dip a teabag into Hudson River it doesn’t become tea. And if Lipton polluted the Hudson River such that its “tea” content was even higher than the tea in my glass it still wouldn’t be tea. What’s the difference? Linguist [Magdalena Sztencel summarizes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318420342_Semantics_Pragmatics_and_Meaning_Revisited_The_Case_of_Conditionals) thus: **“whether we regard something as water or not depends on the intricate interaction of human interests, concerns, beliefs and intentions.”** In this case, likely the fact that I intended to make tea and Lipton didn’t.\n\nIs it so surprising, then, that NFTs can be variously art, property titles, signatures, and so on? An artist/creator/author/scientist’s intention to make an NFT “be” the work itself (or an inseparable component of it) may just be sufficient. \n\n[1] Perhaps interesting to note that early Western visitors to Yap assumed the Rai stones were “just” size-denominated money and failed to understand why the stones had individual names and why the value could depend on “whether it was brought by a famous sailor, or whether people died during its transport”. But size mattered too!
