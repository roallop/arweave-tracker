These invention disclosures, documenting the earliest stages of some of the most significant discoveries of the 21st century, represent critical moments in history. \n\nThe Fourth Pillar (UC Berkeley, 2021), designed by [Maggie Valentine](https://twitter.com/magglevalentine), depicts 10 never-before-public documents detailing Jim Allison's 1996 invention, “Blockade of T-Lymphocyte Down-Regulation Associated with CTLA-4 Signaling.” It describes a way to turn off the immune system’s aversion to attacking tumors, which Jim Allison demonstrated worked in mice while working as a professor at Berkeley. The disclosure includes hand written notes that reveal his understanding of the magnitude of this discovery, which established immunotherapy as the \"fourth pillar\" of cancer treatment alongside surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. This NFT not only represents profoundly powerful and life saving research, but also expands the scope and utility of NFTs. It was especially meaningful to Berkeley alumni since the bulk of the proceeds will go directly towards funding continued research at our alma mater, with a small portion reserved for Blockchain at Berkeley. \n\nWhen we heard about the auction and internalized how momentous this event was, we thought, \"Wouldn't it be cool if Cal alumni were the ones who owned this historic NFT?\" Some of us were members of existing DAOs and immediately thought that spinning up a DAO would be the best way to make this happen. We weren't sure if we were being too ambitious — it was a little over a day before the auction — but we decided it was worth it to try anyway. Crypto as an industry is full of experimentation, with huge ambitions to redefine finance, the internet, and corporate governance. In this spirit, we felt inspired to create something that had never existed before — an alumni DAO. We felt so strongly that this should exist that we convinced the UC Berkeley team to delay the auction so we could try to pull it all together. That gave us the weekend to launch FiatLux.\n\n## Launching Over the Weekend\nSomewhat ironically, technology was the easiest part of launching FiatLux. The more difficult part was the rapid coordination of a large group of people in an incredibly short period of time. To add to the chaos, this all took place during the Miami Bitcoin Conference. It was really Berkeley's crypto-native alumni base that made it possible for us to move so fast in forming and funding the DAO. Everyone already had ETH in their wallets, was familiar with how a a multi-sig worked, understood the difference between public/private keys and signing/sending addresses, knew we needed to have extra reserves for gas fees for on-chain voting/bidding, and most importantly, understood what this NFT could mean for the future of research and contributing to technological innovation.\n \n[](https://twitter.com/thatguyintech/status/1403946894515003396)\n\n[Medha](https://twitter.com/medhakothari) and [Justine](https://twitter.com/j_humenansky) were both part of [Komorebi Collective](https://twitter.com/KomorebiFund), an investment DAO that recently launched. As a result of that experience, they were able to guide the group in forming the DAO. We were familiar with [Syndicate Protocol](https://twitter.com/SyndicateDAO), a crypto project founded by fellow Cal alum [Ian Lee](https://twitter.com/ianIDEO), and knew they would be a critical part of getting FiatLux up and running quickly. We reached out and they were incredibly excited about the idea, working with us over the weekend to make FiatLux a reality. We are so grateful our friends and fellow alumni trusted our vision, which was evolving throughout the process, and were so enthusiastic to commit to the DAO in its very early stages. Social trust was key — in the end we are a collective of friends and coworkers with a shared a set of values that wanted to come together to do something meaningful. \n\nEven so, bringing 33 alum together asynchronously in 48 hours required two shifts of core members (east and west coast) working nearly 24 hours straight to coordinate. We set the minimum contribution at 0.5 ETH, so recent grads and current students could join, but the DAO didn't have any ETH in our wallet just one hour prior to the start of the auction. Yet, we ended up with the winning bid of 22 ETH (~$55,000 at the time of purchase). [Albert](https://twitter.com/thatguyintech), a FiatLux member, said it best: \"It was blur, but in the best way.\"\n\nWe believe the future of funding will be made up of communities like ours coming together entirely online to co-invest in causes they care deeply about.  With the launch of FiatLux, we join the ranks of many other mission-driven DAOs that we admire. We see a future in which we collaborate with these DAOs to create a larger impact than we could on our own through meta-governance and joint ventures.

{"id": "51KqwHnFmJt5cNiVnDanTIsftH_4Kr7qKK0vB9nwvfE", "title": "The Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity", "body": "_Mapping out the hurdles DeFi will face in its quest for mainstream adoption 🗺_\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/549eeeb5-1813-412b-95c6-e98fed96906a.jpg?height=1500&width=2500&refresh=true)\n\nDecentralised Finance, DeFi, is thought by many to be the future of the financial services industry and is expected to completely change the way people think about money and the systems and institutions they entrust to look after their money. The space has you covered for anything ranging from [peer-to-protocol lending protocols](https://aave.com/) to [insurance policies that protect users from loss of funds due to protocol bugs](https://nexusmutual.io/). Derivative protocols like [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) have you covered for any investments in non ETH-based assets, and you need look no further than [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/) for all your cash-settled options trading needs. \n\nThe space is quickly starting to resemble a fully functional financial system, with all the applications and systems needed for standard retail investor transactions established and regularly audited, but also the most niche structured products thriving and innovating further with every passing day. \n\nHowever, the most striking difference is that DeFi is trying to do what TradFi (Traditional Finance) did over the past 2,000 years in just a couple of years. This pace of innovation is in large part aided by the true and native [composability](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-true-power-of-defi-composability-14fe8355e0d0#:~:text=Composability%2C%20in%20DeFi%2C%20is%20the,and%20therefore%20each%20other's%20utility.) of DeFi which allows projects to seamlessly integrate with each other like Lego and create mind-blowing synergies. DeFi is well on its way to catching up to TradFi in terms of functionality and has its eyes set on surpassing it as soon as the mainstream is ready. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6d974fc1-8031-47f3-9f5b-4bda5509abc9.png?height=700&width=1801)\n\nThe future is bright for DeFi, and the space is always vibrant and full of energy, no matter the state of the overall crypto market. We are still a while away from widespread adoption of DeFi, and as many people often say, *we are still early*. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), the most popular chrome extension based wallet used to interact with DeFi, only recently reached 5 million monthly active users. Mainstream adoption too soon would potentially come at the wrong time for DeFi as the applications may not be properly optimised to support the large and sudden influx of users, but I have had a lot of time to think about this problem lately and have come to some conclusions about what I believe are the main hurdles DeFi needs to surpass before it is truly ready for the *mainnet* to hit the *mainstream*.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76a440fa-1ae5-443a-97fd-356ebd1a0f25.png?height=848&width=2152)\n\nI call these hurdles **the Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity**.\n\n## Usability\n\nThe first, and arguably most important of these hurdles to ubiquity, is usability. Many of the most successful DeFi protocols are advanced, regularly audited and professionally run but have user interfaces that are unapproachable to all but the most sophisticated investors. In reality, the underlying service these protocols are offering is groundbreaking in the quest for the democratisation of many of the world's most powerful financial instruments which were previously unavailable to most retail investors. Consequently it is important that the people set to benefit the most from this democratisation are also able to understand and use these tools without having to resort to financial advisors.\n\nThe key to this issue is going to be knowing which parts of the UI to hide, and which to display prominently. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is one of the market leaders in keeping its UI simple yet powerful. Still, there will eventually be a divergence of the consumer level interfaces and pro-level interfaces using the same backend, a bit like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) vs [Coinbase **Pro**](https://pro.coinbase.com) to really drive this point home. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) does not focus greatly on UI refinement at the moment, but it will take a [beginner-friendly browser wallet](https://rainbow.me) that has a good fiat on-ramp and perhaps doesn't even refer to itself as a wallet but more as a key to Web3 to really help push DApps into the mainstream. \n\nIncreasingly we will start to see startups cropping up worldwide in various industries focusing on leveraging DeFi technologies to verticalise and fine-tune the experience for different audiences with different financial preferences. The technology behind many of the most popular DeFi protocols is optimised for scale, performance and reliability, so there is a wide-open opportunity for startups to come into specific geographies such as developing economies, where debt financing for small businesses is harder to come by, and build a straightforward front end. This front end could then automatically tap into the sea of open-source protocols and liquidity that is readily available. It could then focus on making it accessible to non-crypto-native audiences with seamless on-ramps for Fiat which, in the future, could allow someone in Venezuela to take out a loan using stablecoins on [AAVE](http://aave.com/) using an [L2 solution like Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) without ever noticing that they have done all of this on a trustless and decentralised back end. \n\nIdeally, customers would eventually be aware of the fact that they are interacting with DeFi, but in order to reach a truly mainstream audience there will be a transitionary period where perhaps these front ends do not lean too heavily into the crypto angle. This movement comes straight out of the playbook of new Fintech startups like [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) and [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) that have spent the past decade taking complex financial systems, reducing their complexity and making them accessible to retail investors. These startups often build on top of TradFi and reduce friction for retail users by bending the rules or by [bundling transactions together](https://www.freetrade.io). DeFi could use the same approach and reduce friction even further by abstracting away the complexities of the Ethereum blockchain and presenting a seamless solution to the end-user. It is unlikely that this simplified DeFi front end innovation will come from the existing Fintech incumbents because the way they are used to working is so different to the way DeFi works. TradFi Fintech startups are used to pushing up against and fighting the traditional systems to try and squeeze them into a user experience that is pleasant to use. The DeFi space is flexible by design so the approach taken by these verticalised DeFi gateways will be simple, and even encouraged by the protocols themselves, contrary to the struggles faced by TradFi Fintech startups where in this case the incumbent banks are constantly trying to play catch-up with the challenger Fintech startups . \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/619cb9ed-b108-46e9-af75-3b211568bb06.png?height=806&width=1825)\n\nWhile there will be many independent startups fulfilling this function and maybe even getting funded through the protocols' own grants DAOs, many of these usability improvements will also come from the protocols' own core teams, especially on the institutional side. Institutional TradFi, at least in the short term, tends to prefer interacting directly with the people that built the technology they are going to be leveraging. [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) has actually started experimenting with [permissioned pools for institutional investors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-lending-platform-aave-reveals-private-pool-for-institutions) because institutional investors previously found it tough to use the protocol due to lack of [KYC and AML](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc-aml-know-your-customer-vs-anti-money-laundering/) compliance, and this has allowed banks and other institutional clients using [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) to know that the other parties in the network are compliant and vetted not to be on an [OFAC sanctions list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). This is just another example of DeFi slightly adapting to TradFi without compromising on their core principles as an almost intermediate stage to mainstream adoption. Whether that be through making it feel like Fiat through stable-coins, or increasing KYC for institutions to help them to feel more at ease about the protocols they are transacting with, these measures all go a long way towards lowering hurdles to mass adoption. \n\nIt is also likely that whilst at this early stage the protocol teams themselves are working on the UI and UX as well as the underlying infrastructure, they may slowly start to shift their focus away from the consumer side and specialise more on the protocol itself. This would likely manifest itself in protocols keeping their existing UIs more as a reference with the aim of slowly phasing them out in the very long-term. Platforms like [Zapper](https://www.zapper.fi) and [Zerion](https://zerion.io/), which are focused almost exclusively on usability and accessibility, will then step in to focus on the front ends and leave the protocol teams free to optimise their platforms.\n\nThe runway is wide open, and the tech is ready. These protocols exist and are being built and tested by thousands of users every day. The best part is that anyone can come in and make them more useful to any specific demographic. Look no further than projects like [Ribbon](https://www.ribbon.finance) to see this in action. [Ribbon](htts://www.ribbon.finance) has made some sophisticated covered call strategies available to anyone with a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) by building directly on [Opyn's](https://www.opyn.co/) cash-settled ETH options protocol, all while making it feel as simple as an, admittedly high-risk, savings account to the end-user.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0ec888-d3db-4856-af1d-48280478715d.png?height=851&width=2325)\n\n## Undercolateralisation \n\nThe second hurdle is the issue of overcolateralisation in DeFi lending protocols. When you put the whole DeFi stack together, what you are left with is essentially a fully decentralised crypto bank that runs itself in the most traditional sense of the word. DeFi, just like a bank, allows you to convert between currencies, deposit money and receive interest in return for providing liquidity to the bank to then allow them to loan it back out. On the other side of the equation, anyone can then go to the bank, take out a loan and then pay it back at a rate most suited to their risk profile and time horizon. In TradFi some loans are unsecured, but many are secured in that they have some form of collateral backing the loan. If you fail to pay back said loan, the traditional bank has the legal authority to repossess that asset and liquidate it in exchange for cash. The percentage of the total loan required as collateral often depends on a credit score and past successful repayment of loans. Some traditional bank loans are overcollateralised when the asset is highly illiquid to make sure that enough cash can be recouped in the event of a loan default. Conversely in most DeFi lending protocols, you need to provide significantly more crypto as collateral than the stable-coins you are borrowing, sometimes as much as 700%.\n\nIt can be hard to understand why someone would ever want to take out a loan worth less than the amount they are putting down as collateral, and whilst there are some valid reasons for this such as delaying a taxable event or increasing leverage on positions through complex financial gymnastics, the vast majority of the world is **unwilling** or, more importantly, **unable** to borrow money in this way. \n\nThe main reason people borrow money is precisely because they do not have the spare capital available at that time. People take out mortgages to buy houses, or take out loans to start a small business in their hometown. Sometimes a mortgage may even start highly collateralised but later turn undercollateralised if the value of the house goes down, however due to the credit history of the borrower the loan is still able to remain a [_performing loan_](https://pocketsense.com/difference-between-performing-nonperforming-loans-12224160.html). The downside of undercollateralisation is of course that if the loan were to default, the collateral would not be able to cover the principal. In this case, the borrower would step in to cover the difference if they are in fact creditworthy and have some reputational skin in the game not to run off with the money with no consequence. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17b662fe-a9af-4b5c-afda-aeb07b88e131.png?height=845&width=2138)\n\nTo cater properly to these kinds of users it is important that DeFi eventually gets to a point where loans can be undercollateralised in some way. The difficulty is that DeFi is by its very nature anonymous and trustless, which means that the concept of social proof and credit scores becomes very difficult to handle and potentially even ideologically problematic. A potential solution could be a quasi-anonymous loan passport solution in which the user is anonymous on one dimension but not on another, i.e. their wallet address is public, but the owner of the wallet is not. One could, in theory, understand someone's creditworthiness through their DeFi loans history, which is of course publicly visible on Web3 or even decrease the user's collateral requirement for their next loan by a certain percentage every time they repay successfully. Another alternative is allowing user loans to be secured and guaranteed by other individuals they know in real life that trust the borrower enough to guarantee their loan and [delegate their credit](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation).\n\nPerhaps we could even see some CeFi institutions step in to perform credit checks on DeFi users on a per address basis. This solution would, of course, introduce some centralisation as it would involve real-identity based KYC, but may be a necessary interim solution for users that prioritise a low collateral ratio over absolute anonymity as lending protocols could eventually introduce pools of loans where a trusted third party has verified creditworthiness in advance. This CeFi verification could also be a [Zero Knowledge Proof](https://www.wired.com/story/zero-knowledge-proofs/), in that the verifying party would know that the borrower is creditworthy but would essentially allow the borrowers to prove their creditworthiness to another party without having to reveal their identity. When the borrower proves their creditworthiness with zero knowledge, they would display the fact that the CeFi institution has deemed them creditworthy as a boolean value in their wallet, perhaps as a non-transferrable NFT.\n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach to the aforementioned CeFi integration by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) and then offering risk-assessed DeFi loans on their platform without the need for collateral. Although we are still a while away from a foolproof creditworthiness checker solution in DeFi there are many different approaches one can take and I believe a combination of these approaches will play a large part in solving the issue of collateralisation in the quest for widespread adoption.\n\nAside from lending protocols, there is also a significant level of overcollateralisation across the whole DeFi universe which was initially there for the sake of simplicity including in options protocols. There has been some great research done into [improving the collateral efficiency of these protocols](https://medium.com/opyn/partially-collateralized-options-now-in-defi-b9d223eb3f4d) to allow for partial collateralisation without having to worry about creditworthiness through strategic liquidations with a \"shock buffer\" of a size large enough to withstand a Black Thursday event.\n\n## Understandability\n\nThe final hurdle that, depending on how you look at things could be the hardest or easiest of these to solve, is the difficulty around understandability and education. This hurdle may ultimately solve itself if the first two issues are solved and DeFi starts to resemble the way in which users are used to dealing with and thinking about finances. However, it is still important to acknowledge that for non-technical people, the DeFi space can be very opaque and consequently more difficult to trust.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/46fc773f-114b-42c0-b1db-eade3492e306.png?height=697&width=2015)\n\nFiat money and the way centralised traditional financial systems work is deeply ingrained in our culture and is a little easier to properly comprehend because many parts of the system rely on trust and simple written agreements which come together to form financial systems. Understanding the way these systems work in DeFi is a lot less straightforward. While in TradFi it is relatively straightforward to explain the basics of how a bank works, in that one can deposit money, and in return the bank lends that money out and pays interest for that privilege. There are very few parts of that process that are opaque because, ultimately, it just involves numbers moving from one spreadsheet to another.\n\nThe difference with DeFi is that you first have to feel comfortable with the concept of decentralisation, anonymity, trustless systems, distributed ledgers, and then you have to try and explain how all of this functions automatically through smart-contracts. There are many parts of DeFi that have to be hand-waved away and perhaps this could become a hindrance to trust. \n\nOne could also, of course, argue that many people implicitly trust the banking system because enough other trusted people do and not because they understand every part of the process. The same could eventually be true when enough knowledgeable people trust DeFi and understand a good enough percentage of the current information gaps. \n\nThere are some great resources out there like [Finematics](https://finematics.com/) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) doing amazing things in the education space and teaching newcomers about all things DeFi. This will be crucial in making sure people are comfortable enough with the technology to use it, especially when currently decentralisation slightly goes against the grain and users may be met with scepticism from friends and family. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/56920551-f6e6-47ad-b44d-493b815bc264.png?height=589&width=1262)\n\nIt should, however, be noted that the younger digital-native generation finds the concept of digital money extremely intuitive as they have grown up interacting with various in-game currencies, and the youngest among them have potentially never even used physical cash in their lives. This will undoubtedly make the proliferation of DeFi a more natural process as Gen-Z is starting to trust the digital world more than physical and may even start to learn about finance through DeFi in context rather than adapting antiquated financial concepts to fit the DeFi world as in the current status-quo.\n\n\n\nOverall the space is going in all the right directions. It will take a while for these ideas to materialise fully, but this is the part that interests me the most about the DeFi space. There is so much mind-blowing R&D going on every day, and people are experimenting, taking risks and breaking boundaries. I'm very passionate about making sure as many people as possible have access to these tools and can take part in the revolution. Understanding the pieces of the puzzle left to fill will become increasingly important as the protocols we rely on are built out and refined and start to look towards the next steps.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this piece 💙 \n\nIf you enjoyed the piece and are interested in receiving more of my content or keeping up to date with anything else I get up to a follow on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/coconidodev) would be great... or if you're more of an email person that works too - **subscribe to my infrequent mailing list** via the link below.", "timestamp": 1624351645, "digest": "klQF-dVD9TOVI288YuTObvBVY5_GsrmBGDunRoWpYt8", "contributor": "0xcde3725B25D6d9bC78CF0941cC15Fd9710c764b9"}
{"id": "Jnb9nTmFoNXJEypqvsfYDPNNNQRJhYvilvHnJCnTKQg", "title": "Humans at the Edges: why people are building DAOs today", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/caa1b848-f1cf-481c-9414-cd3acfaf0ac4.jpeg?height=500&width=1500)\n\nAs part of our new [Stateless initiative](https://stateless.boardroom.info/), we’re excited to present a guest deep dive on DAOs by [Nick Naraghi](https://twitter.com/nicknaraghi), in which he explores the four key motivations for building Decentralized Autonomous Organizations\n\n👉 Keep tabs on the fascinating world of DAOs by subscribing to [our newsletter here](https://governance.substack.com/) 👈\n\n---\n## Introduction\nAcross the board, DAO builders today are impassioned by a vibrant future they have seen and cannot shake. It’s a future that is fairer for everyone and resistant to capture by bad actors. A future where platforms aren’t inevitably destined to maximally extract data, money, and attention from users because of their incentives.\n\nHowever, building a DAO today is hard. Choosing the right tools, filling in the technical gaps, designing incentives, and engaging a community each come with their own challenges. With a high level of both uncertainty and difficulty, building a DAO is reminiscent of building startups in the days of the early Internet.\n\nIt isn’t only the hardships that call back to the beginning of the Internet. Today’s DAO builders emphasize the same values as the earliest pioneers of the web: open, permissionless, collaborative, and mutually beneficial for its contributors.\n\nBut since its inception, the Internet has moved towards privatization, transformed by powerful business entities into a kingdom of walled gardens. And these entities have fiduciary responsibilities to compete rather than collaborate in the war for market share.\n\nChris Dixon articulated this dynamic in his seminal piece, [“Why Decentralization Matters”](https://cdixon.org/2018/02/18/why-decentralization-matters):\n\n> Early internet protocols were technical specifications created by working groups or non-profit organizations that relied on the alignment of interests in the internet community to gain adoption. This method worked well during the very early stages of the internet but since the early 1990s, very few new protocols have gained widespread adoption.\n\n> Cryptonetworks fix these problems by providing economic incentives to developers, maintainers, and other network participants in the form of tokens. They are also much more technically robust. For example, they are able to keep state and do arbitrary transformations on that state, something past protocols could never do.\n\nWe are on the precipice of a new paradigm for online coordination. And in this new paradigm, DAOs are the atomic unit of collaboration — the nodes in the network. \n\n## Why build a DAO?\nThere are four major themes of why people are building and demanding DAOs today:\n- Incentive alignment\n- Regulatory compliance\n- Antifragility\n- Operational efficiency\n\nEach of these stands on its own as a reason to build a DAO, but many DAOs today are inspired by multiple or all of these factors. They are each essential to understanding how the ecosystem of decentralized organizations will evolve over time.\n\n### 1. Incentive Alignment\nThe number one reason to build a DAO is to ensure long-term incentive alignment amongst all stakeholders — founders, investors, contributors, creators, and users.\n\n#### Founder & Investor Incentive Alignment\nIn comparison to the rewards for founding or investing in a traditional startup, DAOs offer a built-in [“exit to community”](https://hackernoon.com/startups-need-a-new-option-exit-to-community-ig12v2z73) strategy. This means founders and investors reap the reward for their work much sooner in the project’s lifecycle (more like 2-3 years, instead of 7-10).\n\n#### Contributor & Creator Incentive Alignment\nThe decentralized nature of a DAO necessitates a more even distribution of economic incentives across all stakeholders in the ecosystem. This means there is more opportunity for non-founder contributors (people helping to build the protocol or platform) and creators (people creating content on the protocol or platform) to grow meaningful token holdings.\n\nSome DAOs implement ownership decay models that aim for meaningful allocation amounts even for contributors that join later in a project’s lifecycle. Further, tokens have significantly more liquidity than equity, making token-based compensation more valuable to contributors in the short term.\n\nAdditionally, since contributors and creators rely on a protocol or platform, they can leverage and coordinate their voting power to influence the project in their favor via governance. This is particularly important in the later stages of a project when the platform could choose to compete with stakeholders in its ecosystem to gain a larger share of the profits. \n\n#### User Incentive Alignment\nIn a similar way, giving users a voice in the organization’s decisions allows them to speak for their own best interest. With sufficient representation, this can help to avoid undesirable rent-seeking behaviors from the platform or misaligned third parties, ideally keeping costs as low as possible.\n\nImagine a DAO that operated a ridesharing service. Over time, riders might vote to minimize fees as much as possible while (hopefully) maintaining the sustainability of the network. This is in stark contrast to the Web2 model: VC-subsidized pricing to get the network established, with prices that increase alongside market dominance and user lock-in.\n\nDue to the nature of the smart contracts that comprise a DAO, the rules, and expected behaviors are transparent and cannot be changed without consent from the community. This creates security, trust, and ultimately fairness for users in entirely new ways.\n\nSavvy project communities are even starting to demand decentralization via DAOs. In the future, it will become clear that in some cases a project’s level of decentralization is an advantage as overlapping projects compete for users and their capital.\n\n#### Ecosystem Alignment\nLast but not least, decentralizing an organization often brings with it a fundamentally open-source approach to building. This creates alignment with the Web3 ecosystem at large, where teams frequently fork existing projects and build off them. As the ecosystem matures, teams will increasingly be able to solve problems with existing tools, niche down, and achieve their goals more efficiently.\n\n### 2. Regulatory Compliance\nMany Web3 projects are highly motivated to decentralize so they can avoid having their tokens being classified as a security by the SEC. Even if a project is aligned with the other motivations to build a DAO that are listed here, regulatory compliance is often what pushes the organization to commit considerable time and money to a DAO-creation effort. It’s also worth noting that new regulation will likely be developed over time, creating new restrictions for DAOs with varying degrees of impact.\n\n#### The Downside of Securities\nWhen a project's token is classified as a security, it is subjected to significant trading restrictions and reporting requirements. At a minimum, it restricts who can trade the token through rigorous compliance practices that highlight who the purchasers and sellers are (a process called “Know Your Customer” onboarding). It also places restrictions on the exchanges and geographies in which a token can be sold. Needless to say, many projects avoid this as it reduces liquidity and increases costs in a way that can be crippling in their early days.\n\n#### A Brief History with the SEC\nTo avoid this classification, the guideline from the SEC is that a project needs to be “sufficiently decentralized.” More specifically, this breaks down into distributed operations, absence of reliance on the founding team to create value, and an absence of information asymmetry between members of the network.\n\nThe underlying test is affectionately referred to as [“The Howey Test”](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418). At its core, it defines a security as requiring an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others. Historically, this dates back to a precedent set in 1948 where a hotel owner sold interests in an orange grove to its guests and claimed it was selling real estate, not securities (tangentially, a very fun origin story [to dig into](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/328/293.html)).\n\n### 3. Antifragility\nWeb3 protocols and platforms want to become sustainable in a way that does not rely on any individual node in the network. This kind of centralization would be an attack vector on the network for bad actors, as well as regulators. The best networks will take this a step further, and seek to build an ecosystem that strengthens itself in response to each attack that inevitably occurs.\n\n#### Avoiding Censorship and Regulatory Capture\nFor these projects, long-term project success means being unstoppable. Kain Warwick, founder of Synthetix, said it best in his [2019 announcement](https://blog.synthetix.io/transition-to-decentralised-governance/) of decentralized governance for the Synthetix protocol (emphasis mine):\n\n> Once the project has reached the point where it improves with each new attack we will no longer fear attempts at censorship but welcome them, as each attempt will ensure the protocol is more resistant to capture. Ultimately this is the dimension on which every decentralised protocol must be measured: **is it unstoppable?**\n\nIn contrast, Web2 companies (such as FAANG) have faced significant pushback and attempts at regulation from governments around the world in response to their massive acquisition and centralization of power. Through decentralization into DAOs, Web3 projects seek to make this type of censorship and regulation impossible.\n\n#### Avoiding Centralized Power (and Stress)\nIn both theory and practice, it is evident that centralization of power creates instability and fragility in a network. From the network science perspective, “the transmission of shocks—and therefore the vulnerability of the system—is related to structure, with highly centralized networks being the most fragile,” ([Picardi and Tajoli](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0208265#pone.0208265.ref010)).\n\nA DAO’s structure needs to be both decentralized and stable, and it also needs to maintain these requirements through transitions of power. It must outlast the founding team, and be able to self-govern longer than a single governor’s term .\n\nFrom the other direction, in order for a project to be successful, it cannot fail because of one important member being crushed under the immense burden of stress. Founders need to be able to unburden themselves of responsibilities they don't want or feel equipped to deliver on as well as others in the community. \n\nKevin Owocki, founder of Gitcoin, synthesized this brilliantly on the [Bankless podcast](http://podcast.banklesshq.com/sotn-47-gitcoin-dao-gtc-token-with-kevin-owocki): “I’m excited about the decentralization of stress [...] I don’t want to be the single point of failure, antifragility is an important part of this mission. [...] Over time I would like to have the same privileges as everyone else in the network.”\n\n### 4. Operational Efficiency\nDAOs today are still in an experimental phase. Playbooks and best practices on how to better coordinate people, automate work, and make decentralized decisions are being drafted live. However, the long-term opportunity for DAOs is to be wildly more efficient than Traditional Organizations (TradOrgs) at applying their resources toward their goals.\n\n#### Exponential Efficiency Growth\nAs introduced in our first article on [“Operational Efficiency Parity”](https://governors.substack.com/p/governors-1-when-will-daos-overtake), I believe that DAOs will quickly reach Efficiency Parity with TradOrgs, and be able to outcompete them shortly after. \n\nThis is made possible by the combined exponential learning rate across the DAO ecosystem. The primary factors for the learning rate are 1) large amounts of funding that has enough risk tolerance for experimentation, 2) the ability to fork successful experiments to propagate them throughout the ecosystem, and 3) multi-layered network effects both within and between DAOs. Once DAOs are ahead, there will be no way for TradOrgs to catch up.\n\n#### Larger Potential Scale\nHuman organizations are complex systems. Past a certain scale, any complex system cannot be controlled well by an individual — it goes beyond one person’s sensemaking capacity. Thus, putting one person at the helm of an organization is destined for limitations.\n\nThink about the changes in an organization as it grows past 8, 25, and 150 people. There are new breakdowns at each stage: siloed knowledge, attrition problems, issues with trust. \n \nOne of the potential upsides with DAOs is that a network can command more resources than an individual at the helm of a hierarchical model. It can scale more efficiently, and handle larger scales more effectively.\n\n#### Opportunities for Automation\nIn 1986, Meir Dan-Cohen [published the idea](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-journal-of-philosophy/article/abs/meir-dancohen-rights-persons-and-organizations-berkeley-and-los-angeles-university-of-california-press-1986-pp-xi-271-us-3250-isbn-0520047117/5634A34B3E63A7C383039136B24B4E8B) of an ownerless and artificially intelligent organization that would repurchase all of its outstanding shares and govern itself. Today, this vision is slowly beginning to come to life via DAOs.\n\nToday, many of the processes in DAOs are manual. Human input is required for things like making proposals, voting, and enacting proposal results. Like coordinating any group of humans, this is often slow, and in many cases, still relies on trusted parties instead of robust cryptographic mechanisms.\n\nThe first opportunity for automation in DAOs is to create the mechanisms and algorithms that manage decision-making and decision implementation. As DAOs evolve, more and more will be automated: sales and marketing, recruitment, coordination of teams, value creation, even editing the DAO’s code. In this way, Dan-Cohen’s vision will become more and more apparent.\n\nOverall, this is great for DAO members. This type of automation will bring internal costs down, which in turn will decrease platform costs for users. At the same time, increased profits will be reinvested or distributed to stakeholders — completing the virtuous cycle of aligned incentives.\n\n## Conclusion\nWith a rapidly increasing number of DAOs, DAO participants, and assets in DAO treasuries, it’s no wonder why there is so much excitement around DAOs right now. The builders are impassioned, and they are building for the long-haul.\n\nBreaking down the themes of why people are motivated to build DAOs right now, we see four major ideas: incentive alignment, regulatory compliance, antifragility, and operational efficiency. While some of these benefits are immediate, all of them will be realized in the long-term.\n\nUltimately, I believe that DAOs offer an opportunity to level up humanity’s capacity to coordinate and self-organize. Just like the Internet, the implications of this will be massive. But this time, we will have unstoppable protocols with strongly aligned incentives and increasing amounts of automation. It’s a recipe for success; we will see how it plays out this time around.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgements\nThank you to Marcus Phillips, Tyler Whirty, Skylar Bantley, Michael Gasiorek, and Charlie Johnson for reviewing early drafts of this work.\n\n## References and Resources\n-   Why Decentralization Matters - Chris Dixon (2018) https://cdixon.org/2018/02/18/why-decentralization-matters\n\n-   Startups Need a New Option: Exit to Community - Nathan Schneider (2019) https://hackernoon.com/startups-need-a-new-option-exit-to-community-ig12v2z73\n\n-   Blockchain Can Wrest the Internet From Corporations' Grasp - Chris Dixon (2019) https://www.wired.com/story/how-blockchain-can-wrest-the-internet-from-corporations/\n\n-   Why Progressive Decentralization is blockchain's best hope - Arthur Camara (2019) https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-progressive-decentralization-is-blockchains-best-hope-31a497f2673b/\n\n-   The DeFi Holy Grail: Synthetix Dissolves Foundation, Hands Platform Control to DAOs - Camila Russo (2020) https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/p/the-defi-holy-grail-synthetix-dissolves\n\n-   Introducing GTC -- Gitcoin's Governance Token - Kevin Owocki (2021) https://gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-gtc-gitcoins-governance-token/\n\n-   It's Time to Decentralize Gitcoin  - Kevin Owocki (2021) https://gitcoin.co/blog/its-time-to-decentralize-gitcoin/\n\n-   Digital Asset Transactions: When Howey Met Gary (Plastic) - William Hinman (SEC) https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418\n\n-   Securities and Exchange Commission v.

{"id": "nN8pF49sMdAZdtXEZD0NdNRNPalK5p-7qab_eSJhzko", "title": "$SELF - A Chain of Identities", "body": "*The following is a participatory NFT experiment and art project. By joining, you will receive at least 1 unique NFT that will be created by me, [Dame.eth](https://twitter.com/jacksondame), and then airdropped to you. Anyone can participate by chipping in a minimum of 0.01 ETH to cover gas costs. To get started, continue reading.*\n\n---\n\nIn many ways, personal identity and \"the self\" are like a blockchain — new events are happening regularly that change our identities and get added to the end of a chain.\n\nSometimes a major event occurs in our lives that requires us to do a \"[hard fork](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp)\". When this happens, there can be a loss of relationships due to people not wanting or not being able to go down the new fork with us. \n\nOther times, nodes will arbitrarily disconnect and stop updating their versions of our identities for no specific reason at all. People drift apart. \n\nMeanwhile, many people have been faithfully following our chain for years, updating their nodes as new developments occur and our $SELF evolves. At times, these people even influenced the direction our chain went in. \n\nWhat if thanking these people was easier? And what if our current and past selves allowed people to more easily participate in their development and unfolding?\n\nThis is difficult because the “blockchain” of the $SELF is not yet decentralized and open.\n\nFor instance, a few years ago when I was starting a new job, I decided to identify myself to my new colleagues as being non-binary. I had never done this before, but I finally reached a point where the discomfort of vulnerability became more tolerable than the discomfort of people treating me like a man.\n\nNone of my colleagues were aware of my past or that I had never publicly identified as non-binary before. They got to see the latest block within my chain, but were ignorant of all the other blocks that had come before it.\n\n## Twitter and the $SELF\n\nOn Twitter, new people are meeting us every single day. Each one is perceiving a slightly different version of our $SELF based on a plethora of variables, including whatever we happen to be shitposting about on any given day. \n\nWith every new “follower” our account receives, a new version of our $SELF emerges within that person's mind.\n\n**These external versions of the $SELF that live within the minds of other people are all non-fungible.** Each version has nuances and differences, accuracies and inaccuracies. We may be able to influence them, but we can't control them.\n\nA profile picture on Twitter plays a major role in someone’s initial impressions and can dictate what version of the $SELF they construct.\n\nWhen you change your profile picture on Twitter, it can be a little disorienting for people around you at first because you're disrupting their mental model of your $SELF that is anchored to a flat image. In fact, it's not uncommon to lose a few followers after you update your profile picture. People suddenly see a new image on their timelines and don't remember connecting to such a person, so they unfollow them. \n\nOver the coming weeks, I’m going to be changing my Twitter account’s profile picture on a regular basis as part of an experiment and art project called $SELF:\n\n- week 1 my image will be a [blitmap](https://www.blitmap.com/)\n- week 2 my image will be an anime character\n- week 3 my image will be a [mooncat](https://mooncat.community/)\n- week 4 my image will be a gradient\n- week 5 my image will be a selfie\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/40ec1bc4-0aca-4f26-82cb-6c019de0f1d4.jpg?height=1016&width=1804)\n\nThe act of changing my picture regularly will cause the non-fungible versions of my $SELF within the minds of any new followers to be quite different than all the ones that have come before. It might even change the pre-existing ones.\n\n**This is a relational, psychological art project. The canvas is the mind and the paint is our relationship.**\n\nYou can take part in this experiment and receive at least 1 unique NFT on the Ethereum mainnet. The NFTs will be like \"proofs of participation\" and forever connect us on the blockchain.\n\n## How $SELF Will Work\n\nThe $SELF works in mysterious ways, so the details of this experiment will also be a little vague. Here's all you need to know:\n\n1. You can participate by obtaining **at least** 10 $SELF tokens for 0.01 ETH using the block below.\n\n2. No single address may obtain more than 250 $SELF tokens (at least... not directly).\n\n3. The holders of these tokens will be **airdropped** at least 1 personal NFT that I create during the experiment. You won't need to claim your NFT. I will use the small amount of funds raised to send them to each participating wallet address.\n\n4. The \"Funding Goal\" listed below is not an actual goal. Mirror's token-generating contract requires a goal to be set, but for the purposes of this experiment it serves as a cap on the number of participants (and NFTs).\n\n5. **On-chain relational data between me and the participants (or the lack thereof) will influence the final form of the NFT that each participant receives.**\n\nGet started by obtaining your $SELF:\n\n[Self](crowdfund://0x972fBE58D550F17eD723Bc4bcEb60163d45E46c1?network=homestead)\n\n## What will the $SELF NFTs look like?\n\nEach NFT will be a unique, abstract \"representation\" of a version of my $SELF that lives within my mind and the minds of the participants.\n\nFurthermore, the number of $SELF tokens you decide to obtain will influence the final outcome of the NFT you receive. On-chain activity that occurs within the 5 weeks of the experiment may or may not also influence the outcome. Identity is fluid, and so is this project.

{"id": "yeiMk9vEiYj9LFwEfomN6l1JM-WAGsatD3zOIdMe02Y", "title": "$SELF - A Chain of Identities", "body": "*The following is a participatory NFT experiment and art project. By joining, you will receive at least 1 unique NFT that will be created by me, [Dame.eth](https://twitter.com/jacksondame), and then airdropped to you. Anyone can participate by chipping in a minimum of 0.01 ETH to cover gas costs. To get started, continue reading.*\n\n---\n\nIn many ways, personal identity and \"the self\" are like a blockchain — new events are happening regularly that change our identities and get added to the end of a chain.\n\nSometimes a major event occurs in our lives that requires us to do a \"[hard fork](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp)\". When this happens, there can be a loss of relationships due to people not wanting or not being able to go down the new fork with us. \n\nOther times, nodes will arbitrarily disconnect and stop updating their versions of our identities for no specific reason at all. People drift apart. \n\nMeanwhile, many people have been faithfully following our chain for years, updating their nodes as new developments occur and our $SELF evolves. At times, these people even influenced the direction our chain went in. \n\nWhat if thanking these people was easier? And what if our current and past selves allowed people to more easily participate in their development and unfolding?\n\nThis is difficult because the “blockchain” of the $SELF is not yet decentralized and open.\n\nFor instance, a few years ago when I was starting a new job, I decided to identify myself to my new colleagues as being non-binary. I had never done this before, but I finally reached a point where the discomfort of vulnerability became more tolerable than the discomfort of people treating me like a man.\n\nNone of my colleagues were aware of my past or that I had never publicly identified as non-binary before. They got to see the latest block within my chain, but were ignorant of all the other blocks that had come before it.\n\n## Twitter and the $SELF\n\nOn Twitter, new people are meeting us every single day. Each one is perceiving a slightly different version of our $SELF based on a plethora of variables, including whatever we happen to be shitposting about on any given day. \n\nWith every new “follower” our account receives, a new version of our $SELF emerges within that person's mind.\n\n**These external versions of the $SELF that live within the minds of other people are all non-fungible.** Each version has nuances and differences, accuracies and inaccuracies. We may be able to influence them, but we can't control them.\n\nA profile picture on Twitter plays a major role in someone’s initial impressions and can dictate what version of the $SELF they construct.\n\nWhen you change your profile picture on Twitter, it can be a little disorienting for people around you at first because you're disrupting their mental model of your $SELF that is anchored to a flat image. In fact, it's not uncommon to lose a few followers after you update your profile picture. People suddenly see a new image on their timelines and don't remember connecting to such a person, so they unfollow them. \n\nOver the coming weeks, I’m going to be changing my Twitter account’s profile picture on a regular basis as part of an experiment and art project called $SELF:\n\n- week 1 my image will be a [blitmap](https://www.blitmap.com/)\n- week 2 my image will be an anime character\n- week 3 my image will be a [mooncat](https://mooncat.community/)\n- week 4 my image will be a gradient\n- week 5 my image will be a selfie\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/40ec1bc4-0aca-4f26-82cb-6c019de0f1d4.jpg?height=1016&width=1804)\n\nThe act of changing my picture regularly will cause the non-fungible versions of my $SELF within the minds of any new followers to be quite different than all the ones that have come before. It might even change the pre-existing ones.\n\n**This is a relational, psychological art project. The canvas is the mind and the paint is our relationship.**\n\nYou can take part in this experiment and receive at least 1 unique NFT on the Ethereum mainnet. The NFTs will be like \"proofs of participation\" and forever connect us on the blockchain.\n\n## How $SELF Will Work\n\nThe $SELF works in mysterious ways, so the details of this experiment will also be a little vague. Here's all you need to know:\n\n1. You can participate by obtaining **at least** 10 $SELF tokens for 0.01 ETH using the block below.\n\n2. No single address may obtain more than 250 $SELF tokens (at least... not directly).\n\n3. The holders of these tokens will be **airdropped** at least 1 personal NFT that I create during the experiment. You won't need to claim your NFT. I will use the small amount of funds raised to send them to each participating wallet address.\n\n4. The \"Funding Goal\" listed below is not an actual goal. Mirror's token-generating contract requires a goal to be set, but for the purposes of this experiment it serves as a cap on the number of participants (and NFTs).\n\n5. **On-chain relational data between me and the participants (or the lack thereof) will influence the final form of the NFT that each participant receives.**\n\nGet started by obtaining your $SELF:\n\n[Self](crowdfund://0x972fBE58D550F17eD723Bc4bcEb60163d45E46c1?network=homestead)\n\n## What will the $SELF NFTs look like?\n\nEach NFT will be a unique, abstract \"representation\" of a version of my $SELF that lives within my mind and the minds of the participants.\n\nFurthermore, the number of $SELF tokens you decide to obtain will influence the final outcome of the NFT you receive. On-chain activity that occurs within the 5 weeks of the experiment may or may not also influence the outcome. Identity is fluid, and so is this project.

{"id": "zJZWP0rmlaH0Kt9OoxL5tJ1EOR0fcygB4mbCVmkZvHk", "title": "Apply for the CabinDAO Creator Residency Program", "body": "Is there a project sitting in the back of your mind, waiting for the time and space to become a reality? If you had a month to work on it surrounded by beautiful nature, creative collaborators, and blazing fast wifi, what could you accomplish?\n\nThree weeks ago, sitting around the campfire at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/), we dreamed up a residency program to help people answer these questions. Since we first shared our proposal, [we’ve raised over 16 ETH from 96 people, launched CabinDAO, and funded 12 month-long residencies for creators](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ). We have an active discord server of new online friends and have already turned some of those connections into IRL friends.\n\n**Now we’re ready to start accepting applicants for the first cohort of the CabinDAO residency program!**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/422c55ba-cf7e-4f48-a33f-f20f3aa011e5.jpg?height=2400&width=3600)\n\nThe first cohort will run from July 19th to August 15th. We will accept proposals from June 17th to June 23rd and will open voting for $CABIN holders on June 23rd. Voting for proposals will close on June 28th at which time the four proposals with the most votes will be selected to participate in the first cohort. \n\n## Submitting a Proposal\n\nSubmitting a proposal couldn’t be easier. All you have to do is write and share a thread on Twitter and tag [@creatorcabins](https://twitter.com/creatorcabins) in the first tweet. We’ll gather these threads and coordinate a vote among our members to determine the four creators to be selected in the first cohort.\n\nHere's a sample proposal:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ZFleischmann/status/1405588160365596680?s=20\n\n## What to Include in Your Proposal\n\nUse this as an opportunity to be creative. It would be good to introduce yourself to the community and share some of your past work. We would also love to see some rough, initial thoughts on how you would like to spend the time in Texas. You don’t need to provide a fully fleshed out plan. Just the kernel of a promising idea that’s been bouncing around your head.\n\nA good proposal will include:\n* An introduction to who you are and what you do\n* Some past work samples\n* An idea for how you’d like to spend your time while at the cabins\n\nWhile I can’t speak for the rest of the community, I can say that my own personal votes will go to creative proposals with wild ideas. 🙃\n\nHere is a second sample proposal:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mnirPRJCTS/status/1405620335253278720\n\n## Proposal Period\n\nThe time to submit a proposal will run from June 17th (now!) to June 23rd at 12:00pm PT. All threads posted during that period will be considered for a vote. Proposals submitted after the deadline will be considered for the second cohort. \n\n## The Cohort\n\nIf your proposal is accepted, you’ll gain access to the first 4-person cohort of creators. You’ll receive a free 1-month stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) in the Hill Country of Texas outside Austin (valued at $2,800). You will have your own private bedroom, bathroom, and work space in the [Residency Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/cabins), with access to a communal workspace, living room, dining room, and kitchen. The cabins also have a fire pit, pool, and 28 acres to roam around on. \n\nA Camp Counselor will be there to coordinate the logistics of your stay, including getting to the cabins from the airport, group outings, and grocery runs.\n\n**Most importantly, you’ll have one month of uninterrupted time to bring a project into the world.**\n\n## Voting\n\nThe proposal period will end on June 23rd. We will take some time to turn proposals into a vote on Snapshot and have the community vote. $CABIN holders will have until June 28th to vote on proposals. \n\nIt’s not too late to become a $CABIN holder! All you have to do is contribute some ETH and join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/N6hVmFygjR).\n\n[CabinDAO](crowdfund://0x94515e4f6fabad73C8bCdd8cd42f0b5C037E2c49?network=homestead)\n\nWe will provide further instructions to $CABIN holders on how to place your votes before voting starts. We will also hold a live voting and proposal review session in the CabinDAO discord server.\n\n## FAQs\n\n### What skills are we looking for?\n\nCreativity, collaboration, dedication, and diversity. We love the idea of bringing people from wildly different backgrounds together and seeing what happens. What will the conversation be like around the firepit? How will people end up collaborating and supporting each other?\n\n### How do I know I should apply?\n\nThe little voice inside of you telling you your idea is great and you can do it. Believe that voice. Channel it into a Twitter thread for a chance to spend a month working on that project you’ve been itching to build.\n\n### What’s included?\n\nThe residency program includes the following:\n* A free, 1-month stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) (valued at $2,800) with your own private bedroom, bathroom, and work space\n* A 0.25 ETH stipend for food and other essentials\n* Access to a Camp Counselor to coordinate logistics of your trip\n* One month of uninterrupted time to create with a community of collaborators to support you\n\n### Can I work on other work (e.g. remote work) while I’m there?\n\nThe goal of this residency program is to unlock the time and space to work on projects you wouldn’t otherwise be able to focus on. We want to support people who will be spending most of their time focused on these projects. While we understand that people may have other commitments, if you aren’t able to dedicate a month to independent creative work, this program is probably not the right fit. We trust the members of this community to use their best judgement based on the goal of this program.\n\n### When will I know if I was selected?\n\nVoting will close on June 28th, at which point we will reach out on Twitter via DM to make sure you can accept the residency. We will announce the four winners later in the day on June 28th.\n\n### Is this just for US citizens? \n\nNo, this is open to anyone who can travel to the US and will be vaccinated at the start of the program\n\n### Who is eligible for a residency? \n\nAnyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders. If you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n### Do I have to submit on Twitter?\n\nWe would prefer applications to be submitted through Twitter so that the broader community can provide feedback. If you don't have Twitter or are not comfortable submitting your proposal there, you may send the DAO your proposal by email (jon@creatorcabins.com)", "timestamp": 1624409922, "digest": "L7hCFAnV9-knieb8AM6z5J7ITgVv0ZUCAXPOB0Y5iWs", "contributor": "0xC3268DDB8E38302763fFdC9191FCEbD4C948fe1b"}
