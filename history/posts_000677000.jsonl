In addition to describing the model, we are also testing it live on a piece of open innovation in progress. Specifically we are auctioning off an NFT of an Independent Data Analysis from [our test of Seth's Appetite Theory](https://s.mirror.xyz/vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg). This was conducted in part using a novel cryptographic method for open science called \"[Zero-Knowledge Data Analysis](https://researchers.one/articles/21.04.00006).\"\n\nThe two professors of statistics who ran the independent data analysis, Harry Crane and Ryan Martin, have produced an elegant violin plot of the results to be auctioned off. You can see (and bid on!) this auction directly below this paragraph, but you are welcome to [keep reading beyond if you'd like to better understand the SplitStream](https://iqjji6peiwztatemcrpcyet5lnpuphcivt2hmtirjpqqjmbfppha.arweave.net/RBKUeeRFszBMjBReLBJ9W19HnEis9HZNEUvhBLAle84) and, thus, where the proceeds will be going.\n\n[Token #2837](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2837)\n\n# The SplitStream\n\nYou might know the quote “If I have seen further, it is from standing on the shoulders of giants”. You might also know that it’s from Isaac Newton, a giant if there ever was one. So in science, giants tend to look down and see other giants. Citations, when they work, map those dependencies backwards through time.\n\nCitations on citations.\n\nGiants all the way down.\n\nIf you send funds through these citations, you get a cascade. A stream of splits. A SplitStream.\n\nThe SplitStream is a system in which portions of an NFT sale may flow to some or all of the works the NFT cites, with those cited works then sending some of their funds further along to the works they cite, and so on.\n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/74a36177-7d70-4742-b15d-1cda5a8725f3.jpeg?height=684&width=592)\n\nIndependent Analysis is a really valuable thing, and it is a cutting edge Open Science best practice. Thus we value Professors Crane and Martin's contributions greatly and have requested that they keep 50% of the NFT sale from the auction above. They have also agreed to test the SplitStream and for the purposes of this incentive test, their analysis “cites” two NFTs:\n\n- The NFT of the Open Science Test of Seth’s Appetite Theory (currently owned by Molecule)\n- The NFT of this Essay Outlining the Protocol (owned by Planck)\n\nPlanck will then split our proceeds further to what we are citing:\n\n-Mirror because we are using their amazing platform and tech.\n-This Artwork is Always on Sale, suggested by Simon De La Rouvier as the proper target for the citation of his shared idea of Harberger taxes for NFT ownership (which is an important aspect of our protocol.)\n\nWe encourage the recipients of these proceeds, if they are at all substantial, to split back to those they would cite. Let's also note that this is a simple test of the mechanism and certainly does not represent the full range of actual citations we would use.\n", "timestamp": 1619809150, "digest": "HejUlxbCD_F5fmvX8vR5VINruV-21huDTOUGMdnSAL8", "contributor": "0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6"}

In addition to describing the model, we are also testing it live on a piece of open innovation in progress. Specifically we are auctioning off an NFT of an Independent Data Analysis from [our test of Seth's Appetite Theory](https://s.mirror.xyz/vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg). This was conducted in part using a novel cryptographic method for open science called \"[Zero-Knowledge Data Analysis](https://researchers.one/articles/21.04.00006).\"\n\nThe two professors of statistics who ran the independent data analysis, Harry Crane and Ryan Martin, have produced an elegant violin plot of the results to be auctioned off. You can see (and bid on!) this auction directly below this paragraph, but you are welcome to [keep reading beyond if you'd like to better understand the SplitStream](https://iqjji6peiwztatemcrpcyet5lnpuphcivt2hmtirjpqqjmbfppha.arweave.net/RBKUeeRFszBMjBReLBJ9W19HnEis9HZNEUvhBLAle84) and, thus, where the proceeds will be going.\n\n[Token #2837](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2837)\n\n# The SplitStream\n\nYou might know the quote “If I have seen further, it is from standing on the shoulders of giants”. You might also know that it’s from Isaac Newton, a giant if there ever was one. So in science, giants tend to look down and see other giants. Citations, when they work, map those dependencies backwards through time.\n\nCitations on citations.\n\nGiants all the way down.\n\nIf you send funds through these citations, you get a cascade. A stream of splits. A SplitStream.\n\nThe SplitStream is a system in which portions of an NFT sale may flow to some or all of the works the NFT cites, with those cited works then sending some of their funds further along to the works they cite, and so on.\n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/74a36177-7d70-4742-b15d-1cda5a8725f3.jpeg?height=684&width=592)\n\nIndependent Analysis is a really valuable thing, and it is a cutting edge Open Science best practice. Thus we value Professors Crane and Martin's contributions greatly and have requested that they keep 50% of the NFT sale from the auction above. They have also agreed to test the SplitStream and for the purposes of this incentive test, their analysis “cites” two NFTs:\n\n- The NFT of the Open Science Test of Seth’s Appetite Theory (currently owned by Molecule)\n- The NFT of this Essay Outlining the Protocol (owned by Planck)\n\nPlanck will then split our proceeds further to what we are citing:\n\n-Mirror because we are using their amazing platform and tech.\n-This Artwork is Always on Sale, suggested by Simon De La Rouvier as the proper target for the citation of his shared idea of Harberger taxes for NFT ownership (which is an important aspect of our protocol.)\n\nWe encourage the recipients of these proceeds, if they are at all substantial, to split back to those they would cite. Let's also note that this is a simple test of the mechanism and certainly does not represent the full range of actual citations we would use.\n\nIf you'd like to read the full essay about what Planck is doing and why, you should [check this out](https://s.mirror.xyz/vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg).", "timestamp": 1619814847, "digest": "HejUlxbCD_F5fmvX8vR5VINruV-21huDTOUGMdnSAL8", "contributor": "0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6"}

The auctions will open on Monday May 3rd at 5pm ET.\n\nThe winning bids from these three auctions will be split amongst the musicians, visual artists, project operatives, and Songcamp’s treasury. We are using Mirror’s Splits tool in order to instantaneously and trustlessly split all auction proceeds to their rightful recipient. *To see this breakdown in action, scroll down to the Split blocks below.* \n\nBecause Mirror, Catalog, and the Zora protocol take zero transaction fees, **100% of the funds from these three NFT auctions flow directly to those involved in the project**. \n\nThat is not a point to be taken lightly.

The creator fee will also be shared by all contributors in the same relative proportions as above. \n\nCurrently, the Zora protocol does not support the separation of a Creator Fee from the Creator’s wallet. This means that the creator fee will go directly to the wallet that minted the NFT. Because of this, our plan is as follows: once the auction closes and the creator fee flows into the band’s wallet, that wallet will manually send the creator fee to its respective Split block address. This way, all 100% of the auction proceeds will end up in that song’s Split.

We played with the idea of Songcamp being this “lower layer” that spins up collectives, and the participants within each collective receiving all proceeds resulting from the creations. \n\nIn that way we start to see two distinct layers here: \n\n1) the Songcamp base “protocol” layer, and; \n2) this first sprint within Songcamp \n\nRight now, in that this is the first project, those two layers feel pretty flush. And to keep things simple, we concluded on a share of 10% of each auction to go towards the Songcamp treasury and its future projects. \n\nThat said, we are excited to continue this conversation.

I couldn't be more excited to announce I'm joining [Showtime](https://tryshowtime.com) to help build the best crypto social network.\n\n## A short recap of my life until now\n\nI’ve been coding for a while now, almost 10 years. I started with open-source and slowly shifted gears to become an indie maker. I managed to build an audience around my indie journey and my projects, meet amazing people and have lots of fun.\n\nI’m also 19, and while my plan has always been to make a living from writing code, last year I decided I would take a slight detour through college (35% because parents, 65% because it’s nice to have some order and structure in your life for a while). Then, COVID happened and all order and structure went through the window (plus I was already skipping most of my classes to code). I needed a new plan.\n\nWhile I was thinking about what to do next, NFTs exploded. I started seeing them everywhere and decided to dive a little deeper. I discovered the Ethereum world, and I haven’t been able to think about much else since. I [started learning as fast as I could](https://m1guelpf.blog/post/how-to-learn-crypto), meeting amazing people, and working on small projects (both by myself and with [really awesome people](https://twitter.com/tech0ptimist)).\n\nI knew I wanted the next thing I work on to be a crypto project. And, after learning and building in public, people were reaching out to me!\n\n## Why Showtime\n\nDeciding what project would fit me best was really hard, especially since all of them met all my usual prerequisites for a project (which is why I was considering them in the first place). They were all really amazing projects and aligned with my mission of helping others make a living doing what they love. I ended up choosing Showtime for two reasons:\n\nFirstly, their long-term goal of building a user-owned social network really resonated with me. I’m really passionate about web3 as a way to decentralize data ownership, and have been thinking about open social protocols for years now (I even [started building a new social network](https://auralite.io) last summer).\n\nI also feel like an early-stage startup run by young founders (one of them from Europe) is the best learning environment I could ask for, plus their culture (hacker-style shipping) reminds me of how I'm used to working on my own projects.\n\nSo yeah, I’ll be taking care of the Showtime website as employee #1! I’m really excited to show you everything we have planned, and I’m sure everyone is really going to like it.\n\n## On Making Art\n\nWhen planning this announcement, I challenged myself to create an artistic piece to go with it. While I’ve been playing with 3D design for a while now, I didn’t consider myself an artist, and felt like pushing myself to create something worthy of this moment would change that.\n\n[Refraction](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/32026)\n\nIt has. I’m really proud of this piece, from the story it tells to how it looks. I’m an artist. And I’m ready to start building Showtime for every other artist out there.\n\n## What now?\n\nFor years, my goal has been to make a living by doing what I love. I feel like I’ve achieved that now, and have been thinking about how I want my life to look like in a few years, and what I should use the rest of my time for.\n\nI’m going to be taking the next week off to settle in with Showtime and build a routine around having a job. After that, I’ll make a proposal with a few paths I’ve been considering for continuing to grow as a creator and indie maker. [$MIGUEL](https://miguelpiedrafita.com/token) holders will vote on which one I take.\n\nMonday will be the first day of a new stage of my life. Thank you to everyone who made it possible. ❤️\n\n> You can follow me and my creator journey on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/m1guelpf)", "timestamp": 1619828248, "digest": "B0Jbescm1aHYw8OnX_6z-OCtcz8ubFSwusRpJut2ZdU", "contributor": "0xE340b00B6B622C136fFA5CFf130eC8edCdDCb39D"}

{"id": "2YftAvKhPMWDOvDZYD76CKZSB2tFiZAvTPirDhezrGQ", "title": "MoonCats and Rainbows: How a Normal Person Fell in Love with Crypto", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/50b349b1-6ccb-469e-ac8a-93a91836d103.png?height=1904&width=3385)\n\nI will never forget March 12, 2021. It was the day that I fell in love with Crypto. Up until then, I was just casually interested. This is the story of how it happened…\n\nTo start, I live in South Carolina. According to Google Search data, my state is one of the states with the **least** amount of interest in crypto. We rank 49th and are beaten only by West Virginia.\n\nNo one I know in my physical proximity uses crypto. \n\nI love technology though, so I've been casually watching the space from a distance since at least 2015. During the bull run of 2017, I bought $15 in Bitcoin as a joke and then did nothing else for several years.\n\nI stayed away because I saw lots of trolls and a lack of diversity. When I looked at the crypto industry, I didn't see myself or anything that made me think it was for me. It was for Bitcoin Bros and people of The Valley, not for a non-binary person living in the Southern United States. I also wasn't quite sure how it all worked.\n\nSince 2017 though, a lot has changed... both in the crypto world and in my personal life. Crypto has withstood a lot of trials, tribulations, and externalities that could have killed it.\n\nFurthermore, the space has started to become more diverse. It's got a long way to go, but in late 2019 I began to see more people like me entering the waters and not drowning. It piqued my interest enough to start paying closer attention. \n\nAt the same time, I jumped into the stock market for the first time, and I made a modest return on my investments during the pandemic. As 2020 came to a close, I began to look for ways to diversify my portfolio and increase my risk.\n\n## Welcome to MoonCatRescue\n\nIn January of 2021, I stumbled upon an iOS app called Rainbow Wallet. [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) is a crypto wallet for Ethereum assets, but instead of being technical or nerdy, it was super cute and friendly! It felt approachable, and it felt like it was made for me. I downloaded it to see how it worked.\n\nBefore long, I had purchased my first Ether (the currency within Ethereum), a few alt-coins, a tiny amount of Bitcoin, and some Dogecoin.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/jacksondame/status/1361410529093431297?s=20\n\nPurchasing crypto seriously for the first time was fun and interesting, but I wasn't hooked yet. Even when Dogecoin skyrocketed and delivered me an unbelievable return on my initial investment, I wasn't ready to go much further. \n\nBut then, out of nowhere, I stumbled upon MoonCatRescue and everything changed.\n\n[MoonCatRescue.com](https://mooncatrescue.com) is an old crypto project that was created back in 2017. It was one of the first NFTs to ever exist. It has a lot of historical significance and pioneered many of the trends we see in the space today.\n\nHere is how the project describes itself:\n\n> Welcome to MoonCatRescue!\n> The MoonCats are depending on you!\n>\n> We are undertaking an Insanely Cute Operation to the moon to save the MoonCats from imminent danger, and we need your help. Are you ready to help?\n>\n> You may not know this, but there are currently over four billion MoonCats on the moon. Every MoonCat is unique in its own way. These lunar felines live in harmony – they are often found frolicking through craters, batting moon rocks around, and taking long space naps.

We have designed a spaceship, with the latest in litterbox technology, that can fit up to 25,600 MoonCats. If you choose to come along, then it will be up to you to scan for and rescue MoonCats to the safety of the Ethereum blockchain!\n\nMoonCats was a game, an art project, and a story.\n\nUnfortunately, it was ahead of its time and there wasn't enough interest back in 2017 for all the MoonCats to be rescued. A few thousand cats were claimed, but the bulk of them were left waiting on the moon to be rescued.\n\nFlashforward to 2021 and [MoonCatRescue.com](https://mooncatrescue.com) was rediscovered during the big NFT boom of March. By this point I had minted my first NFT, understood the basic mechanics of how they worked, and was following people on Twitter who actively talked about the ecosystem. \n\nOn March 12, one of the people I follow on Twitter shared the link to MoonCatRescue.com, and I instantly knew it was a project worth jumping into. [I rescued 3 MoonCats for approximately $30/each](https://twitter.com/jacksondame/status/1370441447825100801?s=20) and within hours all 25,600 MoonCats were gone. Mission accomplished!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ede5d58-31c2-46ba-9c9b-b8ecda99c4cf.gif?height=277&width=480)\n\nA community quickly sprouted up out of nowhere and grew into a 4,000 member discord group. Within the first few days, these digital pixelated cats I rescued for a few bucks were suddenly being bought and sold on secondary markets for thousands of dollars each. I rejected dozens of offers to buy mine and chose to HODL them instead (hold them). \n\nThey were my cats. I rescued them. If I were to ever let them go, it wasn't going to be on a whim to the first person throwing money at me. I also knew [there was precedent for historical NFT projects to be worth a lot of money](https://www.christies.com/features/10-things-to-know-about-CryptoPunks-11569-1.aspx) one day. It seemed like a worthwhile investment.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, the demand for the cats slowed down and many people moved on. Despite this, a core group of fans and developers stayed around, continuing to grow the community and the possibilities. When the prices fell to new lows, I doubled my investment and purchased 3 more cats.\n\nOver time though, it started to become much more than an investment to me. I could see myself growing attached to these little critters. My pink cat in particular became quite close to me, and I started to set it as my profile picture on Twitter every weekend.\n\nI quickly began to realize that [the technology underneath these cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RplnSVTzvnU) could definitely be the future. If a pixelated cat could capture my heart, I could see it doing so much more.\n\n## From HODL to CUDL\n\nIn 2013, a user by the name of GameKyuubi posted the following drunken message on a [Bitcoin forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0):\n\n> I AM HODLING\n> December 18, 2013, 10:03:03 AM\n>\n> I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time.  Still wrong.  w/e.  GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.  It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what? I'm not part of that group. When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying \"OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD\" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.\n> \n> so i've had some whiskey\n> actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky\n> w/e\n> sue me\n \nThis was the origin of the famous term \"HODL\". It was a drunken typo that morphed into a global meme, quirky symbol, and investor battle cry. \n\nGameKyuubi's post is a good example of [what the crypto world looked like at the time](https://cointelegraph.com/news/women-in-crypto-has-gender-consensus-come-to-the-market) to outsiders like me. Very masculine, hyper loud, and kinda obnoxious. \n\nI mention this piece of crypto history because the MoonCat community took this classic Bitcoin Bro meme and reimagined it for our pixelated feline community. \n\n**Instead of HODLing our cats, we CUDL them.**\n\nIt's a fun play on words, but it's also a sign of the times. The crypto world isn't what it used to be, and there's more to it than just finance and investing. Public perception hasn't quite caught up to this development though, and I'm beginning to realize I might be able to play a small role in moving the space forward and bridging the gap between outsiders and insiders.\n\nI understand the objections. I get the hesitancy. And I empathize with how confusing it can feel. From direct experience, it’s clear to me what’s NOT going to compel more normal people to start using crypto. \n\nA white paper isn’t going do it. Being yelled and screamed at by bitcoin bros isn’t going do it. Being told to “have fun staying poor” isn’t going to do it either.\n\n**In reality, the path forward for crypto is probably going to look a lot more like CUDLing than HODLing.**\n\nTo spread to the masses, we’re going to have to lean heavier on fun stories, engaging experiences, and supportive relationships. Our communities are going to have to become [more inclusive, accessible, and diverse](https://she256.org/). \n\nThat’s what got me here, and that’s what is going to make me stick around.", "timestamp": 1619880251, "digest": "6U_sDNM7unirxk30glrMJlAmcICpZb7clxRey67YRb4", "contributor": "0x3B3525F60eeea4a1eF554df5425912c2a532875D"}
{"id": "5VuI_Xkc_t0_1jbYLIoMwQZyn4zwXgFc3R-eWzcWtl0", "title": "The Shape of Power in Crypto (and How I Won the $WRITE Race)", "body": "> “There is a part in each of us which holds fast to the old truth: either you are the hunter or you are the prey. Learn which you are. Act accordingly. Your life depends upon it.” ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\nI've worked at companies over the years that claimed to have flat structures. They would proudly declare, \"we're not into hierarchy here!\" \n\nIt sounded nice in theory, but it was never true. There was always a hierarchy that remained hidden. The opaque nature of power in these environments made them difficult to work in and proved to be fertile soil for bad things to grow. \n\nA similar dynamic can be seen outside of the workplace. In American society, there is a false sense of equality and equal opportunity. We choose to ignore the heavy layers of class and social status blanketing our lives because acknowledging them can be uncomfortable.\n\n“Let’s hide follower counts and how many likes a post receives.”\n\nOver the years, I've started to believe that the world would be better if the power structures in our lives were more overt and less opaque. \n\nIn my experience, there can be more accountability when we know who has power and how they got it. Transparency can also make it harder for people with privilege to escape responsibility and get away with using their power poorly.\n\nFurthermore, people who **aren't** in positions of power can better manage their realities. When you don't have power, navigating a hidden hierarchy is like trying to find your way through a corn maze at night without a flashlight.\n\nIt's dark and disorienting.\n\n## Overt Power\n\n> “The shape of power is always the same: it is infinite, it is complex, it is forever branching. Its directions are unpredictable; it obeys its own laws. No one can observe the acorn and extrapolate each vein in each leaf of the oak crown. The closer you look, the more various it becomes. However complex you think it is, it is more complex than that. Like the rivers to the ocean, like the lightning strike, it is obscene and uncontained.”  ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\nThe power dynamics in the **Crypto** and **Web 3** space feels much more overt than anywhere else I've been in the past. That's part of why I resisted jumping into crypto for so long. Over time though I started to see how the overtness of all the power could actually be useful.\n\nA great example of this can be seen through the lens of the $WRITE race. The $WRITE race was a competition I had to win in order to publish on Mirror. The rules were relatively simple: in order to start a Mirror publication, I had to receive enough votes to be in the top 10 during one of the rounds. Each week, the top 10 people would be added to the platform.\n\nThis is fundamentally different than how most tech companies launch their products. Startups typically use invite systems where your chance of joining is dependent upon who you know. Sometimes you aren't even aware a new platform exists because you aren't friends with the insiders!\n\nThis old model works great for incumbents with strong networks, but not so great for people like me who don't live in California or New York and who aren't as well connected. \n\nMirror's $WRITE race still had A LOT of power dynamics, but I could actually see them and figure out how to work my way through them.\n\nOn the voting page, everyone's follower counts were clearly displayed. I could see who was voting for who and how many votes had been given. I could even go onto the blockchain and see Mirror's token/contract for myself. Furthermore, each round happened at the same time each week so I could prepare in advance for it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2acf08b9-64f7-481f-bb62-020e691fd827.png?height=4030&width=9374)\n\nThe openness of Mirror (and blockchain technology) has given me power I normally wouldn't have.\n\nNot only did I finally make the top 10 list this week, but I finished in first place thanks to the support of people I had only just met! I even received more votes than people who had huge followings (like Jack Butcher with 100,000 followers).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/450c5e98-9a05-4724-83c9-16b33e0dc56a.png?height=4360&width=9374)\n\nIt wasn't easy and not everyone is going to be able to do it, but I don't know of anywhere else an outsider like me would be able to make it through the webs of power this quickly. The deck felt stacked against me, but here I am. \n\n## Wasted Power\n\n> “We’re only pretending everything is normal because we don’t know what else to do.” ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\nOne of my biggest frustrations during the $WRITE race was watching many powerful people win but then never actually publishing anything. Some folks would post the Mirror equivalent of \"just setting up my twtr\" and then never do anything else. At times it felt more like the $DONOTWRITE race.\n\nI don't blame the Mirror team for this though because it's a complicated problem with no clear solution. Every tech platform deals with this same phenomenon, and I know the team is aware and actively pursuing solutions.\n\nInstead, I lay the blame for this at the feet of powerful people who took a place in line, received power, and then did nothing with it. This is a pattern that has played out across history.\n\nThe fact that old patterns are so easily infecting new systems is a clear signal that emerging technologies like **Crypto** and **Web 3** are not going to magically solve our problems. **We can't just slap blockchain onto something and call it day.**\n\nStill, new spaces like Mirror are providing possibilities that weren't available to us in the past. Something IS emerging, and I don't want to be one of the people that wastes this opportunity.\n\n## Flower Power\n\n> “When the people change, the palace cannot hold.”  ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\nSimilar to what JSTN said in [his initial Mirror post](https://jstn.mirror.xyz/y2obU55QyWxZxHHXlQlKGh6gEvshv8lqGIIlGPq5S7s), this new era of the web is making me feel things that I haven't felt in a long time. There's hope, fresh air, and old power structures are giving way to new ones.\n\nThe emergence of **Web 3** feels like spring has come to the internet. Flowers are trying to bloom.\n\nBut, there are lots of weeds getting in the way... and it often feels like I don't have enough power to make a difference.\n\nStill, navigating the $WRITE race the past few weeks has given me hope. I keep seeing small signs that people are changing. That this time things might be different. That the palace might not be able to hold. That I might be able to do something.\n\nI hope I'm right. 🤞\n\n> “It is only that every day one grows a little, every day something is different, so that in the heaping up of days suddenly a thing that was impossible has become possible.”  ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\nConnecting with me:\n[@jacksondame](https://twitter.com/jacksondame)\n[Newsletter](https://jacksondame.com/newsletter)\n\n# Collect this essay as a 1/1 NFT:\n\n[Token #2920](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2920)\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1619880436, "digest": "UyogjWzC9kMmo7iwyy0jDvnjm3TlUGKOdaAxzHe-onw", "contributor": "0x3B3525F60eeea4a1eF554df5425912c2a532875D"}

It was the day that I fell in love with Crypto. Up until then, I was just casually interested. This is the story of how it happened...\n\nTo start, I live in South Carolina. According to Google Search data, my state is one of the states with the **least** amount of interest in crypto. We rank 49th and are beaten only by West Virginia.\n\nNo one I know in my physical proximity uses crypto. \n\nI love technology though, so I've been casually watching the space from a distance since at least 2015.

When I looked at the crypto industry, I didn't see myself or anything that made me think it was for me.

I also wasn't quite sure how it all worked.\n\nSince 2017 though, a lot has changed... both in the crypto world and in my personal life. Crypto has withstood a lot of trials, tribulations, and externalities that could have killed it.\n\nFurthermore, the space has started to become more diverse. It's got a long way to go, but in late 2019 I began to see more people like me entering the waters and not drowning. It piqued my interest enough to start paying closer attention. \n\nAt the same time, I jumped into the stock market for the first time, and I made a modest return on my investments during the pandemic. As 2020 came to a close, I began to look for ways to diversify my portfolio and increase my risk.\n\n## Welcome to MoonCatRescue\n\nIn January of 2021, I stumbled upon an iOS app called Rainbow Wallet.

It has a lot of historical significance and pioneered many of the trends we see in the space today.\n\nHere is how the project describes itself:\n\n> Welcome to MoonCatRescue!\n> The MoonCats are depending on you!\n>\n> We are undertaking an Insanely Cute Operation to the moon to save the MoonCats from imminent danger, and we need your help.

[I rescued 3 MoonCats for approximately $30/each](https://twitter.com/jacksondame/status/1370441447825100801?s=20) and within hours all 25,600 MoonCats were gone. Mission accomplished!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ede5d58-31c2-46ba-9c9b-b8ecda99c4cf.gif?height=277&width=480)\n\nA community quickly sprouted up out of nowhere and grew into a 4,000 member discord group. Within the first few days, these digital pixelated cats I rescued for a few bucks were suddenly being bought and sold on secondary markets for thousands of dollars each. I rejected dozens of offers to buy mine and chose to HODL them instead (hold them). \n\nThey were my cats. I rescued them. If I were to ever let them go, it wasn't going to be on a whim to the first person throwing money at me. I also knew [there was precedent for historical NFT projects to be worth a lot of money](https://www.christies.com/features/10-things-to-know-about-CryptoPunks-11569-1.aspx) one day. It seemed like a worthwhile investment.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, the demand for the cats slowed down and many people moved on. Despite this, a core group of fans and developers stayed around, continuing to grow the community and the possibilities. When the prices fell to new lows, I doubled my investment and purchased 3 more cats.\n\nOver time though, it started to become much more than an investment to me. I could see myself growing attached to these little critters. My pink cat in particular became quite close to me, and I started to set it as my profile picture on Twitter every weekend.\n\nI quickly began to realize that [the technology underneath these cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RplnSVTzvnU) could definitely be the future. If a pixelated cat could capture my heart, I could see it doing so much more.\n\n## From HODL to CUDL\n\nIn 2013, a user by the name of GameKyuubi posted the following drunken message on a [Bitcoin forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0):\n\n> I AM HODLING\n> December 18, 2013, 10:03:03 AM\n>\n> I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time.  Still wrong.  w/e.  GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.  It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what? I'm not part of that group. When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying \"OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD\" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.\n> \n> so i've had some whiskey\n> actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky\n> w/e\n> sue me\n \nThis was the origin of the famous term \"HODL\". It was a drunken typo that morphed into a global meme, quirky symbol, and investor battle cry. \n\nGameKyuubi's post is a good example of [what the crypto world looked like at the time](https://cointelegraph.com/news/women-in-crypto-has-gender-consensus-come-to-the-market) to outsiders like me. Very masculine, hyper loud, and kinda obnoxious. \n\nI mention this piece of crypto history because the MoonCat community took this classic Bitcoin Bro meme and reimagined it for our pixelated feline community. \n\n**Instead of HODLing our cats, we CUDL them.**\n\nIt's a fun play on words, but it's also a sign of the times. The crypto world isn't what it used to be, and there's more to it than just finance and investing. Public perception hasn't quite caught up to this development though, and I'm beginning to realize I might be able to play a small role in moving the space forward and bridging the gap between outsiders and insiders.\n\nI understand the objections. I get the hesitancy. And I empathize with how confusing it can feel. From direct experience, it’s clear to me what’s NOT going to compel more normal people to start using crypto. \n\nA white paper isn’t going do it. Being yelled and screamed at by bitcoin bros isn’t going do it. Being told to “have fun staying poor” isn’t going to do it either.\n\n**In reality, the path forward for crypto is probably going to look a lot more like CUDLing than HODLing.**\n\nTo spread to the masses, we’re going to have to lean heavier on fun stories, engaging experiences, and supportive relationships. Our communities are going to have to become [more inclusive, accessible, and diverse](https://she256.org/). \n\nThat’s what got me here, and that’s what is going to make me stick around.\n\n# Collect this essay as a 1/1 NFT\nOriginal cover art designed by me.\n\n", "timestamp": 1619880864, "digest": "6U_sDNM7unirxk30glrMJlAmcICpZb7clxRey67YRb4", "contributor": "0x3B3525F60eeea4a1eF554df5425912c2a532875D"}

It was the day that I fell in love with Crypto. Up until then, I was just casually interested. This is the story of how it happened...\n\nTo start, I live in South Carolina. According to Google Search data, my state is one of the states with the **least** amount of interest in crypto. We rank 49th and are beaten only by West Virginia.\n\nNo one I know in my physical proximity uses crypto. \n\nI love technology though, so I've been casually watching the space from a distance since at least 2015. During the bull run of 2017, I bought $15 in Bitcoin as a joke and then did nothing else for several years.\n\nI stayed away because I saw lots of trolls and a lack of diversity. When I looked at the crypto industry, I didn't see myself or anything that made me think it was for me. It was for Bitcoin Bros and people of The Valley, not for a non-binary person living in the Southern United States. I also wasn't quite sure how it all worked.\n\nSince 2017 though, a lot has changed... both in the crypto world and in my personal life. Crypto has withstood a lot of trials, tribulations, and externalities that could have killed it.\n\nFurthermore, the space has started to become more diverse. It's got a long way to go, but in late 2019 I began to see more people like me entering the waters and not drowning. It piqued my interest enough to start paying closer attention. \n\nAt the same time, I jumped into the stock market for the first time, and I made a modest return on my investments during the pandemic. As 2020 came to a close, I began to look for ways to diversify my portfolio and increase my risk.\n\n## Welcome to MoonCatRescue\n\nIn January of 2021, I stumbled upon an iOS app called Rainbow Wallet. [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) is a crypto wallet for Ethereum assets, but instead of being technical or nerdy, it was super cute and friendly! It felt approachable, and it felt like it was made for me. I downloaded it to see how it worked.\n\nBefore long, I had purchased my first Ether (the currency within Ethereum), a few alt-coins, a tiny amount of Bitcoin, and some Dogecoin.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/jacksondame/status/1361410529093431297?s=20\n\nPurchasing crypto seriously for the first time was fun and interesting, but I wasn't hooked yet. Even when Dogecoin skyrocketed and delivered me an unbelievable return on my initial investment, I wasn't ready to go much further. \n\nBut then, out of nowhere, I stumbled upon MoonCatRescue and everything changed.\n\n[MoonCatRescue.com](https://mooncatrescue.com) is an old crypto project that was created back in 2017. It was one of the first NFTs to ever exist. It has a lot of historical significance and pioneered many of the trends we see in the space today.\n\nHere is how the project describes itself:\n\n> Welcome to MoonCatRescue!\n> The MoonCats are depending on you!\n>\n> We are undertaking an Insanely Cute Operation to the moon to save the MoonCats from imminent danger, and we need your help. Are you ready to help?\n>\n> You may not know this, but there are currently over four billion MoonCats on the moon. Every MoonCat is unique in its own way. These lunar felines live in harmony – they are often found frolicking through craters, batting moon rocks around, and taking long space naps. However, the upcoming solar eclipse threatens their existence (for reasons), and it us up to us to ensure the MoonCat species lives on. \n> \n> To save the MoonCats we are going to rescue them from the moon and bring them to live on the Ethereum blockchain, where they will be safe and live fulfilling MoonCat lives. We have designed a spaceship, with the latest in litterbox technology, that can fit up to 25,600 MoonCats. If you choose to come along, then it will be up to you to scan for and rescue MoonCats to the safety of the Ethereum blockchain!\n\nMoonCats was a game, an art project, and a story.\n\nUnfortunately, it was ahead of its time and there wasn't enough interest back in 2017 for all the MoonCats to be rescued. A few thousand cats were claimed, but the bulk of them were left waiting on the moon to be rescued.\n\nFlashforward to 2021 and [MoonCatRescue.com](https://mooncatrescue.com) was rediscovered during the big NFT boom of March. By this point I had minted my first NFT, understood the basic mechanics of how they worked, and was following people on Twitter who actively talked about the ecosystem. \n\nOn March 12, one of the people I follow on Twitter shared the link to MoonCatRescue.com, and I instantly knew it was a project worth jumping into. [I rescued 3 MoonCats for approximately $30/each](https://twitter.com/jacksondame/status/1370441447825100801?s=20) and within hours all 25,600 MoonCats were gone.

Within the first few days, these digital pixelated cats I rescued for a few bucks were suddenly being bought and sold on secondary markets for thousands of dollars each. I rejected dozens of offers to buy mine and chose to HODL them instead (hold them). \n\nThey were my cats. I rescued them. If I were to ever let them go, it wasn't going to be on a whim to the first person throwing money at me. I also knew [there was precedent for historical NFT projects to be worth a lot of money](https://www.christies.com/features/10-things-to-know-about-CryptoPunks-11569-1.aspx) one day. It seemed like a worthwhile investment.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, the demand for the cats slowed down and many people moved on. Despite this, a core group of fans and developers stayed around, continuing to grow the community and the possibilities. When the prices fell to new lows, I doubled my investment and purchased 3 more cats.\n\nOver time though, it started to become much more than an investment to me. I could see myself growing attached to these little critters. My pink cat in particular became quite close to me, and I started to set it as my profile picture on Twitter every weekend.\n\nI quickly began to realize that [the technology underneath these cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RplnSVTzvnU) could definitely be the future. If a pixelated cat could capture my heart, I could see it doing so much more.\n\n## From HODL to CUDL\n\nIn 2013, a user by the name of GameKyuubi posted the following drunken message on a [Bitcoin forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0):\n\n> I AM HODLING\n> December 18, 2013, 10:03:03 AM\n>\n> I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time.

It was the day that I fell in love with Crypto. Up until then, I was just casually interested. This is the story of how it happened...\n\nTo start, I live in South Carolina. According to Google Search data, my state is one of the states with the **least** amount of interest in crypto. We rank 49th and are beaten only by West Virginia.\n\nNo one I know in my physical proximity uses crypto. \n\nI love technology though, so I've been casually watching the space from a distance since at least 2015. During the bull run of 2017, I bought $15 in Bitcoin as a joke and then did nothing else for several years.\n\nI stayed away because I saw lots of trolls and a lack of diversity. When I looked at the crypto industry, I didn't see myself or anything that made me think it was for me. It was for Bitcoin Bros and people of The Valley, not for a non-binary person living in the Southern United States. I also wasn't quite sure how it all worked.\n\nSince 2017 though, a lot has changed... both in the crypto world and in my personal life. Crypto has withstood a lot of trials, tribulations, and externalities that could have killed it.\n\nFurthermore, the space has started to become more diverse. It's got a long way to go, but in late 2019 I began to see more people like me entering the waters and not drowning. It piqued my interest enough to start paying closer attention. \n\nAt the same time, I jumped into the stock market for the first time, and I made a modest return on my investments during the pandemic. As 2020 came to a close, I began to look for ways to diversify my portfolio and increase my risk.\n\n## Welcome to MoonCatRescue\n\nIn January of 2021, I stumbled upon an iOS app called Rainbow Wallet. [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) is a crypto wallet for Ethereum assets, but instead of being technical or nerdy, it was super cute and friendly! It felt approachable, and it felt like it was made for me. I downloaded it to see how it worked.\n\nBefore long, I had purchased my first Ether (the currency within Ethereum), a few alt-coins, a tiny amount of Bitcoin, and some Dogecoin.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/jacksondame/status/1361410529093431297?s=20\n\nPurchasing crypto seriously for the first time was fun and interesting, but I wasn't hooked yet. Even when Dogecoin skyrocketed and delivered me an unbelievable return on my initial investment, I wasn't ready to go much further. \n\nBut then, out of nowhere, I stumbled upon MoonCatRescue and everything changed.\n\n[MoonCatRescue.com](https://mooncatrescue.com) is an old crypto project that was created back in 2017. It was one of the first NFTs to ever exist. It has a lot of historical significance and pioneered many of the trends we see in the space today.\n\nHere is how the project describes itself:\n\n> Welcome to MoonCatRescue!\n> The MoonCats are depending on you!\n>\n> We are undertaking an Insanely Cute Operation to the moon to save the MoonCats from imminent danger, and we need your help. Are you ready to help?\n>\n> You may not know this, but there are currently over four billion MoonCats on the moon. Every MoonCat is unique in its own way. These lunar felines live in harmony – they are often found frolicking through craters, batting moon rocks around, and taking long space naps. However, the upcoming solar eclipse threatens their existence (for reasons), and it us up to us to ensure the MoonCat species lives on. \n> \n> To save the MoonCats we are going to rescue them from the moon and bring them to live on the Ethereum blockchain, where they will be safe and live fulfilling MoonCat lives. We have designed a spaceship, with the latest in litterbox technology, that can fit up to 25,600 MoonCats. If you choose to come along, then it will be up to you to scan for and rescue MoonCats to the safety of the Ethereum blockchain!\n\nMoonCats was a game, an art project, and a story.\n\nUnfortunately, it was ahead of its time and there wasn't enough interest back in 2017 for all the MoonCats to be rescued. A few thousand cats were claimed, but the bulk of them were left waiting on the moon to be rescued.\n\nFlashforward to 2021 and [MoonCatRescue.com](https://mooncatrescue.com) was rediscovered during the big NFT boom of March. By this point I had minted my first NFT, understood the basic mechanics of how they worked, and was following people on Twitter who actively talked about the ecosystem. \n\nOn March 12, one of the people I follow on Twitter shared the link to MoonCatRescue.com, and I instantly knew it was a project worth jumping into. [I rescued 3 MoonCats for approximately $30/each](https://twitter.com/jacksondame/status/1370441447825100801?s=20) and within hours all 25,600 MoonCats were gone. Mission accomplished!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ede5d58-31c2-46ba-9c9b-b8ecda99c4cf.gif?height=277&width=480)\n\nA community quickly sprouted up out of nowhere and grew into a 4,000 member discord group. Within the first few days, these digital pixelated cats I rescued for a few bucks were suddenly being bought and sold on secondary markets for thousands of dollars each. I rejected dozens of offers to buy mine and chose to HODL them instead (hold them). \n\nThey were my cats. I rescued them. If I were to ever let them go, it wasn't going to be on a whim to the first person throwing money at me. I also knew [there was precedent for historical NFT projects to be worth a lot of money](https://www.christies.com/features/10-things-to-know-about-CryptoPunks-11569-1.aspx) one day. It seemed like a worthwhile investment.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, the demand for the cats slowed down and many people moved on. Despite this, a core group of fans and developers stayed around, continuing to grow the community and the possibilities. When the prices fell to new lows, I doubled my investment and purchased 3 more cats.\n\nOver time though, it started to become much more than an investment to me. I could see myself growing attached to these little critters. My pink cat in particular became quite close to me, and I started to set it as my profile picture on Twitter every weekend.\n\nI quickly began to realize that [the technology underneath these cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RplnSVTzvnU) could definitely be the future. If a pixelated cat could capture my heart, I could see it doing so much more.\n\n## From HODL to CUDL\n\nIn 2013, a user by the name of GameKyuubi posted the following drunken message on a [Bitcoin forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0):\n\n> I AM HODLING\n> December 18, 2013, 10:03:03 AM\n>\n> I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time.  Still wrong.  w/e.  GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.  It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what? I'm not part of that group. When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying \"OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD\" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.\n> \n> so i've had some whiskey\n> actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky\n> w/e\n> sue me\n \nThis was the origin of the famous term \"HODL\".

{"id": "Q4yfvYRDsdXz5Fdu-NXL2VPydWkzJvhJMj4WMGScszs", "title": "The Shape of Power in Crypto (and How I Won the $WRITE Race)", "body": "> “There is a part in each of us which holds fast to the old truth: either you are the hunter or you are the prey. Learn which you are. Act accordingly. Your life depends upon it.” ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\nI've worked at companies over the years that claimed to have flat structures. They would proudly declare, \"we're not into hierarchy here!\" \n\nIt sounded nice in theory, but it was never true. There was always a hierarchy that remained hidden. The opaque nature of power in these environments made them difficult to work in and proved to be fertile soil for bad things to grow. \n\nA similar dynamic can be seen outside of the workplace. In American society, there is a false sense of equality and equal opportunity. We choose to ignore the heavy layers of class and social status blanketing our lives because acknowledging them can be uncomfortable.\n\n“Let’s hide follower counts and how many likes a post receives.”\n\nOver the years, I've started to believe that the world would be better if the power structures in our lives were more overt and less opaque. \n\nIn my experience, there can be more accountability when we know who has power and how they got it. Transparency can also make it harder for people with privilege to escape responsibility and get away with using their power poorly.\n\nFurthermore, people who **aren't** in positions of power can better manage their realities. When you don't have power, navigating a hidden hierarchy is like trying to find your way through a corn maze at night without a flashlight.\n\nIt's dark and disorienting.\n\n## Overt Power\n\n> “The shape of power is always the same: it is infinite, it is complex, it is forever branching. Its directions are unpredictable; it obeys its own laws. No one can observe the acorn and extrapolate each vein in each leaf of the oak crown. The closer you look, the more various it becomes. However complex you think it is, it is more complex than that. Like the rivers to the ocean, like the lightning strike, it is obscene and uncontained.”  ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\nThe power dynamics in the **Crypto** and **Web 3** space feels much more overt than anywhere else I've been in the past. That's part of why I resisted jumping into crypto for so long. Over time though I started to see how the overtness of all the power could actually be useful.\n\nA great example of this can be seen through the lens of the $WRITE race. The $WRITE race was a competition I had to win in order to publish on Mirror. The rules were relatively simple: in order to start a Mirror publication, I had to receive enough votes to be in the top 10 during one of the rounds. Each week, the top 10 people would be added to the platform.\n\nThis is fundamentally different than how most tech companies launch their products. Startups typically use invite systems where your chance of joining is dependent upon who you know. Sometimes you aren't even aware a new platform exists because you aren't friends with the insiders!\n\nThis old model works great for incumbents with strong networks, but not so great for people like me who don't live in California or New York and who aren't as well connected. \n\nMirror's $WRITE race still had A LOT of power dynamics, but I could actually see them and figure out how to work my way through them.\n\nOn the voting page, everyone's follower counts were clearly displayed. I could see who was voting for who and how many votes had been given. I could even go onto the blockchain and see Mirror's token/contract for myself. Furthermore, each round happened at the same time each week so I could prepare in advance for it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2acf08b9-64f7-481f-bb62-020e691fd827.png?height=4030&width=9374)\n\nThe openness of Mirror (and blockchain technology) has given me power I normally wouldn't have.\n\nNot only did I finally make the top 10 list this week, but I finished in first place thanks to the support of people I had only just met! I even received more votes than people who had huge followings (like Jack Butcher with 100,000 followers).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/450c5e98-9a05-4724-83c9-16b33e0dc56a.png?height=4360&width=9374)\n\nIt wasn't easy and not everyone is going to be able to do it, but I don't know of anywhere else an outsider like me would be able to make it through the webs of power this quickly. The deck felt stacked against me, but here I am. \n\n## Wasted Power\n\n> “We’re only pretending everything is normal because we don’t know what else to do.” ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\nOne of my biggest frustrations during the $WRITE race was watching many powerful people win but then never actually publishing anything. Some folks would post the Mirror equivalent of \"just setting up my twtr\" and then never do anything else. At times it felt more like the $DONOTWRITE race.\n\nI don't blame the Mirror team for this though because it's a complicated problem with no clear solution. Every tech platform deals with this same phenomenon, and I know the team is aware and actively pursuing solutions.\n\nInstead, I lay the blame for this at the feet of powerful people who took a place in line, received power, and then did nothing with it. This is a pattern that has played out across history.\n\nThe fact that old patterns are so easily infecting new systems is a clear signal that emerging technologies like **Crypto** and **Web 3** are not going to magically solve our problems. **We can't just slap blockchain onto something and call it day.**\n\nStill, new spaces like Mirror are providing possibilities that weren't available to us in the past. Something IS emerging, and I don't want to be one of the people that wastes this opportunity.\n\n## Flower Power\n\n> “When the people change, the palace cannot hold.”  ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\nSimilar to what JSTN said in [his initial Mirror post](https://jstn.mirror.xyz/y2obU55QyWxZxHHXlQlKGh6gEvshv8lqGIIlGPq5S7s), this new era of the web is making me feel things that I haven't felt in a long time. There's hope, fresh air, and old power structures are giving way to new ones.\n\nThe emergence of **Web 3** feels like spring has come to the internet. Flowers are trying to bloom.\n\nBut, there are lots of weeds getting in the way... and it often feels like I don't have enough power to make a difference.\n\nStill, navigating the $WRITE race the past few weeks has given me hope. I keep seeing small signs that people are changing. That this time things might be different. That the palace might not be able to hold. That I might be able to do something.\n\nI hope I'm right. 🤞\n\n> “It is only that every day one grows a little, every day something is different, so that in the heaping up of days suddenly a thing that was impossible has become possible.”  ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\n### Connect with me:\n[@jacksondame](https://twitter.com/jacksondame)\n[Newsletter](https://jacksondame.com/newsletter)\n\n### Collect this essay as a 1/1 NFT:\nOriginal cover art designed by me.\n\n[Token #2920](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2920)\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1619881793, "digest": "UyogjWzC9kMmo7iwyy0jDvnjm3TlUGKOdaAxzHe-onw", "contributor": "0x3B3525F60eeea4a1eF554df5425912c2a532875D"}

At the same time, a group of visual artists and project operatives formed to support the visual art and rollout plan of said music. \n\n**This coming Monday, all of that collectively created art is coming your way.**\n\nHere’s the plan...\n\n## 3 Songs. 3 NFTs. Monday.\n\nFirst, all 3 bands will mint their freshly-created songs as 1/1 NFTs on [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/). \n\nThe 3 NFTs will go on auction here via Mirror’s Reserve Auction. The auctions will open on Monday May 3rd at 5pm ET.\n\nThe winning bids from these three auctions will be split amongst the musicians, visual artists, project operatives, and Songcamp’s treasury. We are using Mirror’s Splits tool in order to instantaneously and trustlessly split all auction proceeds to their rightful recipient. *To see this breakdown in action, scroll down to the Split blocks below.* \n\nBecause Mirror, Catalog, and the Zora protocol take zero transaction fees, **100% of the funds from these three NFT auctions flow directly to those involved in the project**. \n\nThat is not a point to be taken lightly.

Driftwood TX: a place where lakes can sing at night and the sound reverberates in caves and off walls of stone.

And lastly the Songcamp treasury. \n\n[\"Static Twist\" by The Lunar Veil](split://0xD5a7f09d6DeAadB11Bb23d4d59622CC74736a476?network=mainnet)\n\n[\"Hold On Hope\" by Driftwood TX](split://0x142Ca9EDac4726B4BB6c5Bb0451eFC1D88F32bb4?network=mainnet)\n\n[\"Antid0t3\" by Rainbow Punch](split://0x5183Ee697C9BA7f70D6913C5fE4c26C9544b9840?network=mainnet)\n\n## A few notes:\n\n### 1) NFT Auction Flow + The Creator Fee Routing \n\nThe creator fee — which will be setup on Catalog’s front-end at the time of minting and thus baked into the zNFT — is set at 25% for each of these songs. The creator fee will also be shared by all contributors in the same relative proportions as above. \n\nCurrently, the Zora protocol does not support the separation of a Creator Fee from the Creator’s wallet. This means that the creator fee will go directly to the wallet that minted the NFT. Because of this, our plan is as follows: once the auction closes and the creator fee flows into the band’s wallet, that wallet will manually send the creator fee to its respective Split block address. This way, all 100% of the auction proceeds will end up in that song’s Split. Entire flow illustrated below: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/34f3762b-69b9-4ffd-b811-00b07556d18f.jpg?height=459&width=800)\n\n### 2) Is Songcamp an open protocol?\n\nWe spoke at length about what Songcamp’s role is, and what cut if anything the treasury should receive. We played with the idea of Songcamp being this “lower layer” that spins up collectives, and the participants within each collective receiving all proceeds resulting from the creations. \n\nIn that way we start to see two distinct layers here: \n\n1) the Songcamp base “protocol” layer, and; \n2) this first sprint within Songcamp \n\nRight now, in that this is the first project, those two layers feel pretty flush. And to keep things simple, we concluded on a share of 10% of each auction to go towards the Songcamp treasury and its future projects. \n\nThat said, we are excited to continue this conversation. We ask for your thoughts, participation and feedback as we navigate through this experiment.\n\nCome get involved, would ya?
