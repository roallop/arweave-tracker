Arguably, dissolving a treasury is a sign of even greater decentralization than having a community treasury. It means that the protocol is self-sustaining and does not depend on a single treasury.\n\nBut having a diversified treasury that exists in perpetuity can be effective, especially in bear markets. If markets are down 40% but you still need to solve an important technical problem, a diversified treasury can fund that without relying on broader public goods funding. I lean towards structuring a treasury with an infinite time horizon.\n\n**Fiscal policy**\n\nThe annual budget for a treasury should be decided based on the protocol’s needs and its treasury size. Ideally, a protocol’s annual budget should be less than its expected revenue (e.g. Uniswap fee revenue) and treasury investment income.\n\nOne of the most valuable things a protocol can fund is [ecosystem development](https://ls.mirror.xyz/v_AK57oyXtp8hLmtq7p7R8ZkMrqxXmtFQkaQjz_5xg4), which can eventually serve as a competitive edge. Pilot programs by [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-grants-program-v0-1/9081) and [Compound](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-grants-program/1292) have proposed $750,000 per quarter in grants that might be reduced or expanded based on their effectiveness.\n\nAs the recent Compound proposal states, the main needs of a protocol are:\n- Protocol and parameter development\n- Code audits\n- Business development and integrations\n- Advertising and sponsorships\n- Hackathons\n- Bounties\n- Miscellaneous improvements\n\n**Asset allocation**\n\nIt is risky for protocols to only have their own governance tokens in their treasury. If Uniswap has only UNI in its treasury and the token price falls by 40%, its balance sheet would also shrink by 40%. This is dangerous because it occurs at a time when it probably needs to ramp up spending. This could lead to a further downward spiral for the token.\n\nOver time, a protocol treasury should be diversified. Diversification should be planned based on the treasury’s expected annual outflows, liquidity needs, and risk-return of assets.\n\nHere is a sample allocation (without knowing the numbers above):\n- 40% in the protocol’s token\n- 20% in blue chip crypto assets (BTC, ETH)\n- 20% in stablecoins earning yield (DAI, USDC). Stablecoin allocation depends on the liquidity needs and treasury budget.\n- 10% in DeFi index (DPI)\n- 5% in early-stage token investments and M&A that improve the protocol's competitive positioning. The [discussion](https://twitter.com/mhluongo/status/1368963503663513606?s=19) between Keep and NuCyphur is an example of what an on-chain merger could look like.\n- 5% in insurance cover and options. [Example](https://twitter.com/sanlsrni/status/1367724652970221569): rolling buys of smart contract cover or short-dated puts on the protocol’s tokens. This could benefit the protocol during Black Swan events like contract hacks, economic exploits, and market drawdowns.\n\nThere could be ways to diversify a treasury that are trust-minimized and doesn’t require a group of people to have multisig access.\n\nProtocols can leverage the existing on-chain asset management stack:\n- [TokenSets](https://www.tokensets.com/) for customized index-like ERC20 portfolios\n- [Enzyme](https://enzyme.finance/) and [dHedge](https://www.dhedge.org/) for on-chain funds\n- [Potion Labs](https://potion.fi/#/) for risk management architecture\n- [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/) for yield optimization\n\n**How can protocols diversify their treasuries?**\n\nThe simplest method to diversify is to sell some of the protocol's tokens to buy other assets (e.g. ETH, DAI, etc.). Treasuries can’t be diversified overnight. But plans can be made to reach a steady-state allocation over several years.\n\nThere is currently a negative perception associated with selling the  protocol's token because it could signal that the treasury has lost confidence in the protocol. This has a short-term impact on price. Selling large amounts of the protocol’s tokens would involve slippage, especially if it’s not done thoughtfully. However, this can be avoided if the treasury has a stated target policy allocation and dollar cost averages into other assets over several months or years.\n\nThe treasury could also receive other crypto assets as inflows. Few methods include:\n- Fee revenue in other assets that accrues to the treasury.\n- Earning other tokens in exchange for value added by the protocol in other cryptonetworks.\n- Yield delegation vaults: i.e. pay the protocol’s tokens (e.g. UNI) to Yearn users for them to delegate a portion of their yield in ETH and stablecoins to the protocol treasury. Rally [experimented](https://medium.com/rallynetwork/introducing-yield-delegating-vaults-f861a11afb0b) with yield delegation vaults.\n- Investing in other early-stage projects or doing M&A that improves the protocol’s competitive positioning.\n\nIndex Coop is a good case study. They recently published a thoughtful treasury [report](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coop-financial-reporting/939) and made a [proposal](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-16-smart-treasury/935) to purchase ETH with INDEX and DPI in its treasury. Index aims to implement a smart treasury at Balancer with INDEX / ETH at 80/20.\n\n**Treasury committee**\n\nProtocols should set up a 5-7 member treasury management committee, which will work on the following:\n- Propose treasury budget to discuss and vote on\n- Define liquidity requirements based on budget\n- Decide asset allocation policy and review this policy allocation every month\n- Define policy for liquidity mining, token buybacks, salaries and vesting schedule of core contributors\n- Publish monthly / quarterly financial statements\n- Publish monthly / quarterly reports on how treasury is spent\n\nThe treasury committee can be voted on and removed by token holders.\n\nWe will increasingly see specialization emerge for protocols. Token holders will approve big decisions and elect or nominate managerial stakeholders with expertise (individuals, DAOs). Managerial stakeholders will make smaller, more frequent decisions and be held accountable by token holders.\n\nWe will have several experiments to figure out the right balance between managerial effectiveness and community control. In both cases, clear processes and useful transparency is critical.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nProtocol treasuries need to be structured with an infinite time horizon. This requires thinking effectively about: \n- Fiscal policy: how much to spend and what to spend on\n- Asset allocation: how the treasury should be diversified to fund key protocol development irrespective of the market environment\n- Reporting: financial statements of the treasury and summary of key transactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1615381911, "digest": "H-Rd34MLFO6hrcIAsy17PlvLVlswTgfn7ifj90Mht9Y", "contributor": "0x10D6d2e343281D388291A3e02f3293AaEdA67178"}

This will allow me to devote my full time to writing the piece, while allowing it to exist as a public good for anyone to read. **The crowdfund is now live**, and will stay open for one week, or until the cap is hit.\n\n\n[Scissor Essay](crowdfund://0x517bab7661C315C63C6465EEd1b4248e6f7FE183?softCap=2&endsAt=1612468800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/70da6b7c-f699-4cf8-896e-02bdc272a70b.jpeg?height=1340&width=2400)\n\nUnlike other patronage models, this form of crowdfunding is not pure altruism. Instead, patrons receive a stake in the success of the work. Here's how it works:\n1. The essay exists as permanent, public data published via Mirror.\n2. That essay is minted as an NFT on the new [Zora protocol](https://zora.engineering/).\n3. Backers can send ETH to the crowdfund in exchange for $ESSAY tokens.\n4. When the NFT is sold, the ETH in the contract increases\n5. $ESSAY tokens can be bought and sold like any other ERC-20 token, or redeemed for underlying ETH.\n6. Participants in the initial crowdfund will be embedded in the essay forever, as the supporters who made it possible.\n\n### Inspiration\nOver the past couple years, paid writing has made great strides, with Substack popularizing newsletter subscriptions as the dominant business model for writing online. However, the paid newsletter model only works for a certain kind of writing - something regular, consistent, and often a bit shorter.\n\nWhile newsletters are great for many reasons, we also need other business models for writing. Some of the greatest thinkers around are primarily dedicated to something besides publishing their ideas on a regular cadence, and therefore won't be found starting a weekly newsletter. Even those who *are* dedicated to writing often produce their best work after weeks or months of research, not by writing a new piece every few days. Unfortunately, these kinds of writers face a tough choice today: adapt their work to a newsletter format, or write without being paid.\n\nEven for writers running successful newsletters, there's an inherent tradeoff in the subscription format: in order to monetize their content, writers must hide some, if not all of their work, behind a paywall, reserved for those who pay to subscribe. With each new piece is a choice between rewarding those who pay and sharing ideas widely.\n\nThe tools we have at our disposal influence the kind of work we create, and when the only tool around for getting paid to write is a newsletter publisher, it's no wonder we see more and more newsletters, and less of everything else.\n\nOther formats and styles of writing are obviously valuable and worth paying for, and for this reason alone it's worth experimenting with new funding models. I believe that these issues can be solved if we can introduce effective new business models for writing.\n\nThis week, in an attempt to move towards that goal, I'm pursuing my own writing under the new crowdfunding model described above. This model has been on my mind for awhile, and I'm really curious to see if it's possible.\n\nIf my funding goal is hit, the piece will be published publicly, free for everyone to read and share, while those who funded it hold ownership. If the funding goal isn't hit, everyone will receive their money back.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7d42a4b3-363c-4b13-b7f3-592d3b9cb6c1.jpeg?height=1340&width=2400)\n\nThough not proven, I believe this model can can solve both of the problems mentioned above:\n\n1. It offers a path to being paid for a one-off work that's not part of a subscription or newsletter.\n2.

I started my career as a software engineer at Snapchat, then founded a startup, which went through Y Combinator in 2018. Since then, I've worked as a designer and consultant for several startups and investors, including WorkOS, Muze, a16z Crypto, and Y Combinator, where I help out part-time with admissions. You can find me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer).\n\nI typically write 1-2 longer essays each year, most often concerning new insights around startup strategy and product design. Among them, my [Spatial Software](https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware/) post from last year was probably the most popular, describing a wave of new products being built around game-like interfaces and what makes them unique.\n", "timestamp": 1615415583, "digest": "uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0", "contributor": "0xB0623C91c65621df716aB8aFE5f66656B21A9108"}
{"id": "vXp8oiRHv3hr8LzBkx-jGgANktTyoUvT1QJESCutRAE", "title": "Scissor Labels", "body": "> We live in an age of constant narrative conflict. But today, not every battle is legible to the untrained observer. While some grifts are plainly perpetrated by would-be thought leaders, other battles for narrative control are hiding in plain sight, happening under the guise of intellectual debate. When these battles go unrecognized for what they are, even the best among us fall victim to meaningless conversations that waste the time of those involved. In this piece, I introduce the concept of \"scissor labels,\" why they foment controversy, and how they're different from other linguistic debates. I then suggest how to engage with this phenomenon with a more fruitful, future-oriented mindset.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6839dc60-67a9-40e9-b685-4ab6fa084886.jpeg?height=1340&width=2400)\n\n### What the fuck is Hyperpop?\nA specific shape of online debate caught my attention in 2020. As I've reflected on the past year, I've realized that this pattern is happening frequently but is rarely understood.\n\nA standout example from 2020 was the rise of \"Hyperpop.\" The term came about to describe a particular musical aesthetic associated with artists like A.G. Cook and SOPHIE, and gained momentum over the past couple years, reaching a peak sometime in early 2020.\n\nThe musical landscape of Hyperpop is interesting on its own, but equally powerful is the divisive power of the word itself.\n\nLast year, the term served as a centralizing idea around which an entire movement built momentum. In this way, Hyperpop as a label possessed immense generative power, identifying a widely recognized trend, and providing a singular phrase around which a subculture for associated sounds and artists could congregate.\n\nBut what exactly Hyperpop is, no one has fully agreed on. If you ask around, you won't find a canonical definition for Hyperpop. Laura Les of 100 gecs, on [The Pitchfork Review](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3R8H2UdIfdPiNluvfVX1K7?si=oKyjwGdnQPCeIQteWd61Hw), said \"Everybody draws the line in the sand at a different point\" (22:40). Eli Enis from [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvx85v/this-is-hyperpop-a-genre-tag-for-genre-less-music) calls it \"a genre tag for distinctly genre-less music.\" This sense of ambiguity is what makes Hyperpop so divisive. Though the term initially served as a cultural magnet for a range of musicians and fans, its definition quickly became the object of repetitive debates.\n\n![Meme by u/hihiyo](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3d3622e9-80ef-45f9-91b9-b20acd5cea85.jpeg?height=907&width=1319)\n\nOnce the term reached a peak in popularity (likely around 100 gecs' takeover of Spotify's Hyperpop playlist in July 2020), it was most often heard in discussions about what does or doesn't *count* as being Hyperpop. This kind of binary categorization annoyed most people familiar with the term, including the very artists responsible for its popularity. But as we enter the new year, what counts as Hyperpop is still being debated.\n\nIn isolation, this dialogue feels unique to 2020. But what's happening with Hyperpop isn't a one-off. It's just one instance of a cultural phenomenon that's been happening for a long time, whenever a similar label comes about.\n\n### Scissor labels\nHyperpop is an example of what I'm calling a \"scissor label,\" loosely based on Scott Alexander's \"[scissor statement](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/).\" While his original term, scissor statements, are truth claims engineered to create dissent, **scissor labels are categorical terms that happen to be maximally divisive.**\n\nA **scissor label** is a word or phrase that, for the first time, establishes a widely embraced name for a trend without simultaneously establishing a canonical definition. It is a vague term masquerading as a specific one, where the missing definition is still up for grabs. Scissor labels aren't coined or engineered, nor formally initiated by an institution. Rather, they're discovered by accident, suddenly adopted en masse amidst a trend that's already in motion.\n\nOnce a scissor label is established, controlling its definition means controlling whatever the trend represents. A scissor label therefore represents the battleground for a power struggle. By nature, scissor labels have a peculiar divisive power, building energy and momentum around a trend while simultaneously bringing about controversy and debate.\n\nScissor labels trap even the most savvy cultural observer by disguising one type of conflict as another. At first glance, the debates around a term like Hyperpop come about due to the ambiguity of the word itself. It's unsurprising that people argue over the meaning of a category when its definition is unclear, and everyone has their own preconceived idea of what it is. But that doesn't explain why these debates continue for so long, or why they're so intense. Seen clearly, a conflict over the correct definition of a particular scissor label is just a distraction from what's actually going on.\n\nDebates around scissor labels become so intense and perpetuate for so long because of one primary reason: there is something valuable at stake. The label is a narrative up for grabs, and controlling the narrative is a form of power.\n\n### Narratives and incentives\nAnyone who spends time on Twitter is familiar with the idea of popular narratives as an organizing force for online subcultures. Being part of a widely known trend offers legitimization, and an entire ecosystem has evolved for manufacturing, growing, and then utilizing narratives to fulfill the agenda of those involved. Toby Shorin alludes to this below.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/tobyshorin/status/1309130086713634816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2FScissor-Labels-Draft-V5-Dave-94a0f85885764aaea9fa3edc30b66e3f)\n\nWe're living in a time where this narrative environment has matured quite a bit. Jockeying for narrative control happens everywhere, and semiotic land grabs are a significant part of the ecosystem. On tech Twitter, we see people peddling narratives like the future of communities, the creator economy, tools for thought, and the no-code \"movement.\" Oftentimes, these people are simply performing land grabs of their own, hoping to claim more and more territory within the narrative they deem powerful. Once someone has established a strong position in this fashion, they can use their voice both to influence others and to legitimize other people and organizations, whether or not those entities are worthy of legitimization.\n\nLuckily, this territory is well mapped by cultural observers. I assume most of my readers are aware of, and therefore immune to this kind of thing, and are not whole-heartedly buying into someone else's grift.\n\nYet when it comes to scissor labels, where the battle for narrative control is disguised as intellectual conversation, few can resist the pull of the debate.\n\nA more legible example emerged around some of my own work in April last year, when I published my second essay on [spatial software](https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware/). The piece was mainly design exploration, describing different kinds of applications built around 3D space and real-world metaphors. I speculated that game-like applications would make their way into every niche of software, not just video games. What drew me to the topic was a sense of curiosity and play. This kind of software is *fun to use*, and I've continued to explore it through that lens.\n\nHowever, soon after I published the piece, I noticed more and more founders and investors on Twitter announcing their own new spatial software apps. The term itself received more attention than any of the ideas in the piece, and notably, many of the spatial products being announced were not what I considered spatial software at all, despite my inclusion of clear definitions and descriptions in the original essay. The term took on a life of its own and became the object of mimetic competition between many participants in the Startup Twitter timeline.\n\nThis experience put the scissor label concept on my radar. Like Hyperpop, people started to debate \"spatial software\" publicly, questioning what was and wasn't spatial *enough* to justify use of the term. Within our chat server, a group of my own friends found ourselves in several conversations about the definition of spatial software that ended up leading nowhere, including one animated disagreement on the topic.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef3d917a-666b-40d5-9505-b780cad82b7b.jpeg?height=2182&width=2922)\n\nBy every indication, \"spatial software\" is another scissor label, and it's a clear example that illustrates how these debates are more about incentives than intellectual truth-seeking: In a world where companies are funded based on whether or not they fit into the narratives that venture capitalists have bought into, being part of the spatial software narrative can determine a lot for an early stage startup. For a company hoping to raise capital, recruit employees, or even gain early user adoption, the founders have everything to gain by making sure the definition of spatial software includes their own app. Whether consciously or unconsciously, this is the motivational context for how these people engage with the term.\n\nIn the case of Hyperpop, different specifics are at play. Like any other trend, all of the same dynamics around legitimization are present: for an artist making new music, being labeled as Hyperpop means association with something new and exciting, and ultimately, the chance to gain a meaningful following. Laura Les and Dylan Brady of 100 gecs discussed this on the Pitchfork Review, including that they wanted to use their curation of Spotify's Hyperpop playlist to help lesser-known artists get more exposure. Laura mentioned this at 33:50:\n\n> It's this word that doesn't mean anything, but it does have power. It's like a symbol that you can be like, \"Hey check this out this is Hyperpop.\" And people will be like \"Hey I'm gonna listen to that.\"\n\nand\n\n> \"At its best, it produces a way for artists who might go unappreciated to be appreciated...who might not fit under a definition super well to have an audience and a community of people.\"\n\nBut with Hyperpop, there's something more important at stake than just popularity: preserving a special community. Long before the term's sudden rise, the Hyperpop genre grew around a strong community, one that skews young, and where a lot of the best known artists are queer or trans. This became a uniquely welcoming space for musicians and fans alike. For this reason, debates around Hyperpop are not just about definitions - they're inherently about fighting to protect and maintain a culture. For many, this is of even greater significance than the term's impact on an artist's visibility. This was most obvious last summer, when Youtuber pewdiepie revealed that his Recently Played playlist on Spotify included several Hyperpop artists, who promptly asked him and his millions of fans to stop listening.\n\nUnderstanding what's at stake here reveals why the conversations around what is and isn't Hyperpop are never ending. Its definition can change for purely cultural reasons, adapting in order to preserve the existing scene. An artist's music may have all the markings of the Hyperpop sound, but if they aren't aligned with the values of the culture, their music can be excluded from the genre. When people argue over what is and isn't Hyperpop, the conflict is not just about the definition of the word, but about preserving what it stands for. This kind of debate won't end as long as there's a community worth defending.\n\n### Other examples\nHyperpop and spatial software aren't rare examples, just the ones I noticed popping up in my field of view last year. Today, other terms like “digital objects\" and \"decentralization\" are spurring similar conversations.\n\nPlenty more scissor labels from the past come to mind once the concept is familiar. In his [interview with Charlie Rose](https://youtu.be/GopJ1x7vK2Q?t=390) (6:30), David Foster Wallace describes the popularity of David Lynch in the grad school environment he was part of, and dives into what is and isn't \"Lynchian.\" In [his article](http://www.lynchnet.com/lh/lhpremiere.html) for Premiere on the subject, he writes: \"...like postmodern or pornographic, Lynchian is one of those Porter Stewart-type words that's ultimately definable only ostensively-i.e., we know it when we see it.\"\n\nIn their own time, words like \"normcore,\" \"hipster,\" and \"vaporwave\" were scissor labels as well. When I think of all these terms, I remember the arguments that happened around them, but I don't remember any of them being particularly edifying. The details have faded in my memory, and the only impression I have is that we debated these terms for no reason other than that the term was trendy, and some cultural cache was at stake.\n\nPeople aren't debating these topics in the same way today, but that just reveals a corollary to the scissor label definition: Scissor labels are only scissor labels as long as something is at stake. When their definitions fade in importance, scissor labels become categorical terms like any other, but with a cheap feeling left behind that makes it hard to take them seriously. This is the mark of scissor labels from the past.\n\n### Recognizing and engaging in scissor label conversations\nRecognizing and successfully navigating this phenomenon is no longer optional for those meaningfully involved in any online subculture. It's necessary to have an understanding of when to participate in these discussions and how to do so productively.\n\nIn order to do so, the first step is being able to recognize a scissor label conversation as it's happening. The telltale sign of such a conversation is that it's rooted in a strictly binary orientation, primarily about what *is* or *isn't* part of trend X. When this happens, X is most likely a scissor label, and the answer likely isn't binary.\n\nThese conversations build upon themselves, and most people involved jump in immediately, without realizing the incentives behind the scene. They believe their definition is the right one, rather than an interpretation of a trend, and fight accordingly.\n\nWhen we find ourselves in this kind of situation, the first thing to know is that it's a case-by-case decision whether it's worth getting involved at all. But when we do decide to engage with scissor labels, we might as well cut through these dynamics and get to the root of the matter.\n\nTo do so, we must make two main moves. First, we need to identify what's at stake in the discussion, ignoring binary questions and identifying what people are really debating. We can then bring this to the forefront of the conversation instead of debating the scissor label as a proxy. In the case that the scissor label is purely a stand-in for something else, this presents the opportunity for everyone to shift away from a pointless discussion and towards the thing they were really discussing all along.\n\nIf the scissor label's definition is actually of import, we can make a second move: to cut the binary nature of the discussion and introduce a spectrum, or subcategories within the label. This shifts the conversation towards a much more curious place, focused on getting to know the rough topology and boundaries of the label instead of fighting over one definition. This isn't just more accommodating, but often more accurate to the ideas a label describes.\n\nThis is the playbook for engaging with scissor labels productively, but honestly, most of the time, this strategy just isn't worth it. This is because there's a much greater opportunity behind each scissor label, and no matter how strategically one approaches the debate, getting too caught up in these conversations means missing out on that opportunity.\n\n### Future orientation\nThis core reality remains: Scissor labels pop up when something exciting has emerged organically, recognized by everyone who sees it. Though much else may be at stake as a result of its popularity, a scissor label most often has its origin in something honest, artistic, and interesting.\n\nIf we want the ideas that inspire us to evolve instead of turning into cheap fads from the past, we need more people who are unambiguously oriented towards the future, and not stuck debating the present moment. These people, like SOPHIE, remain focused on the same spark that preceded a scissor label's existence — even after a scissor label comes about — and keep pushing it towards the future. They pursue the thing for its own sake, not for clout or success. In doing so, they reinvent a category over and over again. They don't just ponder or debate the scissor label, but influence it through their own work, intuiting that the category itself is dynamic, and shaped by those who keep creating. They too may recognize the scissor label debate for what it is, but they don't have time to get stuck arguing over what's here today; there's always something more exciting in the future.\n\nWhen we get caught up in land grabs, labels, and grifts, we anchor ourselves to the present and miss out on the chance to create what comes next. Though every scissor label needs more people to bring clarity into these conversations, the greater opportunity is often found in this future-oriented approach. Now more than ever, let's recognize this phenomenon and engage only when we need to. As much as possible, let's seek out the exciting idea behind each scissor label and carry that thing forward. Not because we want to win, but because doing so is worth it - for its own sake.\n\n---\n\n#### Closing Note\nTwo weeks ago, Hyperpop lost one of its most pioneering artists, SOPHIE, whose music pushed the boundaries of pop over and over again. I hope this piece has done justice to SOPHIE's work, and that it might encourage more of the same.\n\n#### Special thanks\nThank you to [Toby Shorin](https://twitter.com/tobyshorin), [Kara Kittel](https://twitter.com/karakittel), [Aaron Z.
