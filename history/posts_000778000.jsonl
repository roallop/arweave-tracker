That's a lot of buzzwords, so let‚Äôs explore this in three parts:\n\n1. How access, permissions, and status are the primary components of membership (and the role of tokens)\n2. Membership in Web2 versus Web3 platforms, and why composability matters here\n3. Designing a membership system to generate social capital\n\n### **Access, Permissions, and Status**\n\nOur [data and actions give us identity and relationships](https://ath.mirror.xyz/mDu_nGsWpjvF-KaPLADwxeAMfze3UJOtTAQi2CwPwWc), but having a social graph does not give you community. Put in a Web3 context, a group of people holding or trading the same token does not mean you are a community -  at best, it gives you clusters. \\*\\*An actual community has fairly clear boundaries for growth (in more than a financial sense). You've probably seen some variation on the chart below...\n\n![https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/47N5kFjDdcNfmaliuCEPt.png?height=1130&width=2000)\n\n... where you can identify your core contributors, and try to reward or incentivize them accordingly. Pet3rpan has put this concentric community chart nicely in a Web3 context, showcasing the funnel of activities a participant might engage in during their lifecycle in a community:\n\n![https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/how-to-grow-decentralized-communities-1bf1044924f8 ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BsnO6_CiiWfe9AELOdvJo.png?height=1046&width=2000)\n\nBut just because someone has participated in any of the above events, doesn't mean they feel like they're part of the community. Even giving them tokens for their participation doesn't really move the needle.\n\nTokens are open primitives that membership should be built upon, and just issuing more POAPs or tokens based on events and then moving on is like distributing the raw materials for a house and expecting the people to build up a town. Without a blueprint, people will just stash the materials and leave (or sell them to someone else). In crypto, we‚Äôre supply rich, but guidance poor.\n\nSome communities at least take the first step to have some sort of access dependent on your token activities, usually a Discord server or channel. But access is only the first step to membership. Permissions are too closely tied to access right now, and status is left as too abstract a concept.\n\nSo let's improve on the current model. ***Access is discovery, permissions are responsibility, status is weight.*** This membership funnel is shaped different from the activity funnel above, as the customizable design area gets larger the deeper you go:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WUKtdEmRWd6lSriRuBSLs.png?height=1027&width=972)\n\nThese are basic examples, but they help lay the groundwork for how each layer could be tied to different types (and combinations) of tokens. Let's look at some token design examples for each level:\n\n* **Access:** For the most part, *ERC20's are best for access because requirements are fluid and the tokens are more liquid.* Today I might require 50 tokens to join, but in the future, I may drop it to 25 or increase it to 75 based on community needs (going wide versus deep). NFTs are cultural assets, so if you use that as the gate then it'll be tough to say you need two or more to have access now. Even if you implement project derivatives, liquidity becomes fragmented and confusing. This is project-dependent though, and Creator Cabins did a [great overview of some of the tradeoffs](https://creators.mirror.xyz/V7Ucba89-3qV9yFxj7Spj7YxjKAhc6TOd8nUcCp9n6k).\n* **Permissions:** *I personally believe permissions should be tightly coupled to a stake.* To be given the responsibility for some set of actions, there should be risk involved. Unlike access, permissions should evolve and can be revoked. If I'm making proposals, allowing staking will show my commitment and also give others the opportunity of *joining my stake*. This line of design can help a community better balance abuse of power and opportunities for discovery (of great new contributors).\n* **Status:** *This layer has the largest area because it is tied to attributes and metadata.* Status in a community has the highest amount of variance, as it will likely be event-dependent. Taking the treasury \"weighted voting power\" example, if you give status based on what is being voted on that highlights specific community members while also ensuring that it isn't always the participant with the most tokens has the most sway. NFTs are a great place to play with these attributes, especially through derivative and forge-based projects. *To clarify, this is not the same as reputation since reputation needs to be less fluid as to not confuse people. We'll get more into that later.*\n\nDifferent combinations of these layers could be bundled into \"roles\" for easier management and assignment. I'd love to dive right into a membership system, but first we need to clear out the current mental heuristics around how Web2 \"membership\" works.\n\n### Composable **Membership and the Role of Platforms (Web2 vs Web3)**\n\n*In Web2, membership forms around services. In Web3, services from around membership.* Put simply, being a YouTube subscriber does not affect your privileges when engaging in a Twitch chat or a subreddit. This kind of membership interoperability is certainly possible in Web2, and I think Patreon was the closest to getting a hierarchical membership structure in place. We could have seen a world that looks like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vyHiSL8oyuqovbdFvnPpM.png?height=1084&width=921)\n\nBut obvious arguments would ensue over who owns the master API, and economic flow incentives also act as a blocker since the platform at the top of the hierarchy likely has the highest money-in/money-out flow and take-rate. So in the end we have like 7 or more different memberships to manage! No one actually wants that besides the platforms themselves.\n\nIn Web3, no one is fighting to be at the top of the membership hierarchy because the primitives (tokens) aren't owned by any one platform. Smart contracts are our APIs and we can code revenue splits right into them. If that isn't enough, we can devise governance and attribution systems over the treasury to ensure the services and tooling built around membership continuously benefits communities that rely on them. In the end, the above Web2 platforms will naturally fall lower on the hierarchy. **They will be forced to fit around the composable membership systems that we all enable and create. In other words, the community is the platform:**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tC63snvRPrTVJO8ayeVhz.png?height=1039&width=961)\n\nThere's an argument to be made that in the end, apps will just be a bunch of composable components where each piece is owned by a different platform. But in the interim, it'll be Web3 communities plugging into the currently better interfaces of Web2. When planning a membership system, we'll need to think about membership as bundles of access, permission, and status across these Web2 services. If I'm a multisig member, what roles will I need across all these services and how can that be managed in a single token/membership model? To figure this out, we'd need to experiment. And to experiment, we need social capital.\n\n### A **Membership System for Generating Social Capital**\n\nWe've defined the components of membership and situated them within the Web2 and Web3 context. Now, let's have fun designing a system that could actually go into implementation. ***We'll define social capital as building an allowance for trust, experimentation, and flexibility within a community.*** This means having a membership system that improves ownership of decisions and prevents a social fork. For now, my guess is there are three main steps to execute membership and generate this new capital:\n\n1. **Define Roles:** Roles are bundles of the different layers of membership and are tied to specific participant personas. There are likely hundreds of combinations (especially if you layer token types on top), but some immediate roles that come to mind are:\n   * `Low Access (ERC20) + Low Permissions (ERC20 Stake) = new member`\n   * `High Permissions (ERC20 Stake) + High Status (NFT) = long time contributor`\n   * `High Access (NFT) + High Status (NFT) = subject matter expert`\n   * `High Access (ERC20) + High Permissions (ERC20 Stake) + High Status (NFT) = founding member`\n\n   Doing this well opens up a pathway for growth and also clarity for all members. This starts to give us history too, as I can clearly see how a community has matured by its role definitions and distribution (much more so than if I just look at the token price).\n2. **Specify Incentivizes:** Pet3rpan mentioned in the article linked earlier that *trust and engagement are key to participation.* Financial incentives are a great starting point - if you airdropped me $1000 of your community's tokens, I'd definitely come to take a look and see what I can help with. But if these drops/bounties are filtered by role or membership history, we can be much more flexible with asks and rewards and I'd likely feel more fulfilled. This is the difference between me tackling a data bounty as a nobody versus as a Dune Wizard.\n\n   This could also look like a hackathon where teams are built based on role/membership history, such that newer members are matched with older members. Or imagine if hackathon bounties rewarded community roles instead of just $$$, I think we'd end up seeing an even larger diversity of projects and teams in hackathons than we do today.\n\n   Also, I cannot stress enough the importance of history here. `Membership + Identity + Relationships` will probably be the best proxy for a reputation score, which opens up the path to more creatively weighted incentives.\n3. **Assign Roles:** This step is more technically difficult than the others, given the challenge of plugging membership systems into existing platforms. I think this is similar to the integration problems that any wallet aggregator already faces, for example, Zapper's [protocol requests](https://features.zapper.fi/). Integrating into existing Web2 platforms shouldn't be difficult, but as more Web3 platforms are built the composability will be difficult to manage.\n\n   But as long as we have an identity solution (connecting addresses to user metadata across platforms) and a membership solution (managing roles and tokens intuitively), I think we'll be able to tackle the platform integration problem elegantly. Besides, building the first two will take the ecosystem the next six months anyway.\n\nHopefully, this system helps show how much we can bring a community together while experimenting by using membership built off of tokens. I know for some people this is all still too fluffy, so I plan on doing data-driven case studies to better inform this kind of membership system in the future (and to try to be more quantitative about social capital). Some communities I'm interested in studying under this lens are Yearn, Blitmaps, and Superfluid - but if you have other case studies that come to mind, please do let me know.\n\n## Concluding Thoughts\n\nComposable membership shapes more than just communities, it will shape ecosystems and platforms as well. In crypto, we're all building platforms that give communities the tooling for implementation, visibility, collaboration, and much more. Ecosystems are forming around metadata already, and this will force a reorganization of Web2 platforms to provide a much more open surface to be built upon.\n\nMirror is one platform trying to improve the tooling for communities to implement a rewarding membership system:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jl7vf0FRlSNXu9PQZSo9T.png?height=2025&width=4443)\n\nSeed Club is a good example of the model above, where they [deploy ERC20 tokens for specific communities and causes](https://club.mirror.xyz/dnN3Dwe-iD6jBpzkase4YLHTxYtnuFnmUbSoOfPEkjI), and once members are more defined they move on to [specialized token distribution methods such as the token race](https://club.mirror.xyz/token-race/bafkreidnqdtyls7q62w6mvfuaiwzn52ivlvephw4wul7g5ph2lqbjzymom) for engaging the community and [adding new cohorts](https://club.mirror.xyz/Q5QwN3Uol03pOK8MhAVsfwc0ektDlrkrl6sVSoC2UwA). I think there is a lot more we all can do to standardize the membership implementation process laid out in this article, using Mirror and ecosystem tooling.\n\nBut none of what I've written about can sustainably happen unless communities take their thinking around membership more seriously (and that goes for me too). If any of this interests you, please reach out so that we can build out this future together.

They can revolutionize the way people collaborate and allow a¬†[whole new world of possibilities for workers](https://forefront.market/blog/how-creator-daos-redefine-the-way-we-work). Good incentives through Social Tokens are ideal when it's mutually beneficial to contributors and community leaders. It will create positive-sum games where everyone has an aligned interest.\n\nHowever, with Social Tokens comes the risk of speculation. Speculation is not necessarily a bad thing. It drives interest from people outside of crypto and brings capital to a community that can innovate and grow. It is, however, very complicated to build a healthy and sustainable community in the long-term with a highly volatile token and community members here to speculate. At some point, for a community to grow, it's essential to have people that put time and hard work into the community, not capital.\n\nTo prevent speculation, community leaders can lock N amount of Token for a certain period as a commitment to hold the Token. It prevents people from coming with the only purpose of buying and selling the Token a few days later when it pumps. This mechanism is called Vesting Schedule. This essay aims to explain further what a Vesting Schedule is and how it can be a powerful tool to build a sustainable decentralized community.\n\n## 1 - What is Token Vesting?\n\nWhen launching a decentralized community (or a DAO), it's common to establish a Token for governance purposes and for¬†[attracting / rewarding high-quality talent](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/how-to-attract-high-quality-talent). The Token is usually minted (created) by the community's founding members, and those community leaders have full power over the distribution of the Token.\n\nThis is much power centralized in the hands of very few people. If contributors start to put time into the project and investors start to bring capital to the project, it's important to cover them and not let core team members have full freedom over the token distribution. To prevent bad behaviors, it's recommended to vest a portion of those tokens to ensure the long time commitment of the founding team.\n\nConcretely, vesting a token means locking a certain amount of tokens over a certain period as a commitment to hold the Token. It's a mechanism that allows¬†**the founding team to prove they are highly interested in the project.**\n\nLocking tokens ensures investors that the team has the best intention and maintains a long-term vision, incentivizing them to continue working on the project development. When a token is vested, the owner of those Token can't withdraw them directly and have to wait until the vesting period ends. It's made possible thanks to blockchain mechanisms, and specifically smart contracts, that make it easy to lock a certain amount of funds until contract conditions are met. In our case, when the vesting period has been completed, the smart contract, enforced on a blockchain, will allow the holders to withdraw their tokens.\n\nDepending on the needs, it's possible to play on many parameters when vesting a Token. It's possible to play with the vesting period, the number of tokens subject to vesting, if the tokens will be released gradually etc... It's important to keep in mind that there is no right or wrong answer. A project could reserve 15% of its coins when the Token is minted, then gradually released some tokens every month/quarter/year during the project process. Another project could create a Community Round subject to vesting, with a vesting period that includes a 6-month cliff, followed by another six-month linear unlock. In this case, community members would receive a certain amount of Token, let's say 1200, but wouldn't be able to withdraw them for six months. They would then receive 200 tokens every month for six months.\n\n![ForeFront Treasury Diversification (subject to vesting)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F808b8979-7f8d-4eae-9878-7f0b21606cbe_2836x1322.png)\n\nKeeping a certain amount of Token on a vesting schedule is a powerful tool to incentivize people to invest in a community. Crypto mechanisms made it easy for community members, investors, and founders to trust each other. With smart contracts, vesting a token is easy and is a tool worth using for every community.\n\nLet's dig more into the main advantages of the Vesting Schedule.\n\n## 2 - What is it useful for?\n\nTo create a healthy and sustainable community, it is essential to have token price stability. Indeed, with a highly volatile token, it will be difficult to attract talent keen to work in exchange for a Token that can plummet overnight. Vesting a Token allows reducing the price volatility of a token by disincentivizing speculation. Indeed, suppose speculators know they won't be able to withdraw their money as soon as they want. In that case, eventually, they won't invest. Only true believers of the project will stay around.\n\n![GlobalCoinResearch‚Äôs contributors can earn $GCR that are subject to vesting](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3996c88-4daa-446c-a518-9cd89d4827fa_1920x1080.png)\n\nVesting a token ensures the investors that the founding team is serious encourages contributors to commit in the long-term and prevents speculation.\n\nThe vesting schedule mechanism is particularly useful:\n\n* **For treasury diversification -**¬†when allowing community members to claim a token in exchange for some other tokens such as Ethereum, it can be useful to vest the tokens to ensure the long-term commitment of the new investors. It will limit the volatility of the Token for a certain period. It creates a fair process that rewards purchasers who support the project at launch and do so throughout the project's lifecycle by holding or utilizing the Token.\n* **For crowdfunding -**¬†Instead of receiving a total share of their tokens after the crowdfunding, the team members receive tokens after regularly scheduled vesting periods determined by the project founders. This way, alone unscrupulous team members can't run off with tokens without contributing to the project.\n\nLet's also dig more into the main advantages of vesting a token.\n\n* **Vesting shows that the team is highly interested in the project -**¬†Locking tokens ensure investors that the team has the best intention and maintain a long-term vision for the project, incentivize them to continue working on the project development.\n* **Vesting lowers market price manipulations -**¬†There is often a several-year \"cliff,\" meaning that the individual must be with the company for a couple of years to release the first increment of tokens.\n* **Vesting limits the risk that few entities control a large proportion of the project's tokens -**¬†It prevents the small group of people present when the supply has been minted to create supply fluctuations that can be ultimately damaging to the Token's ecosystem and price.\n* **Vesting helps keep the power centralized until the community is strong enough to be decentralized -**¬†When rewarding a community through Tokens, it's better if the core team managed the token supply and transactions and kept the voting power centralized. By doing so, they'll have a firmer grasp of the token prices and will be able to build a strong and sustainable community.\n\nIt's also good to keep in mind that the more the already distributed tokens are used, the more valuable the reserved ones become, so it's in each project team member's best interest to create a successful project that has many users, increasing the value of their tokens in the process.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll those elements make vesting an integral part of Tokenomics. We call Tokenomics all the things that enable participants to earn more tokens by contributing positively. Setting up Tokenomics for a project means \"What can be put in place to incentivize a community to participate in the project.\" It's a tool worth using for every community leader, and vesting is likely to be a key component of most crypto launches for the foreseeable future. The protection that affords a token's value in an incredibly volatile market is invaluable.\n\nHaving a token over a vesting schedule is an efficient way to protect investors, founders, and collaborators. Indeed, as shown in this essay, locking a certain amount of Token allows to disincentivize founders and early investors to sell all their tokens with early traction. It also disincentivizes contributors to come only for speculation purposes.\n\n\n---\n\n###### **Want more?**\n\nFollow us on¬†**[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,¬†[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en) and join us on¬†**[Discord](https://discord.gg/8jaQB5CZ)¬†üî•**\n\nThanks for being here!", "timestamp": 1632761980, "digest": "5k0dztRKPXaHeY8oUWIjqjhUP9ikLmGAfYhRFy4DyzE", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

Over the past few months, we've spoken with many projects that want to use a similar tool for their communities. We kept hearing this again and again, so we decided to build a standalone tool that anyone on Mirror could use. Today we'd like to introduce: Token Race.\n\nWe‚Äôve spent a lot of time building, ideating, and iterating on Web3 economic protocols to support projects and creators. As our suite of economic tools has grown and matured and we‚Äôve had communities form around them, we feel that now is the right time to start investing in governance tools to support these communities.\n\nA token race is a great way for individuals and DAOs to get their community involved in decision-making. You can use a token race in various ways, such as:\n\n* curating membership in a DAO\n* curating a list of proposals around the operations of a DAO\n* distributing funds for a grant program\n\nCheck out this example below for a token race I created to figure out what we should do with all this spare $WRITE. Anyone with spare $WRITE tokens in their wallet can vote once the voting period opens.\n\n[proposal://bafkreibqbj6dapw57cpsxpcwe2jgz3w3qtp66sg24la3uhkvgathtlwcq4](proposal://bafkreibqbj6dapw57cpsxpcwe2jgz3w3qtp66sg24la3uhkvgathtlwcq4)\n\nTo create a token race, a user specifies the address of the ERC20 token contract to use, uploads a list of proposals that they‚Äôd like their community to vote on, and specifies the minimum number of tokens members need to hold to be eligible to vote. We take a snapshot of balances, and once the voting opens members get to vote on the various proposals proportional to their wallet balance at the block height of the snapshot. Once the voting period ends, winners are selected based on the highest number of votes.

Hopefully Albert and Fred *continue* being critics, and through debate with the Ethereum community, become better ones over time. A positive trait in the Ethereum community is our interest in [deliberately seeking out flaws, exposing them](https://medium.com/@ameensol/what-you-should-know-before-putting-half-a-million-dai-in-compound-fafdb2645f77), and fixing them.\n\nThe explicit goal of this short post is to bait Albert and Fred into *being* better critics. Expand on your arguments, tell us (beyond generalities) what you think Ethereum is doing wrong, and what others are doing better.\n\nEthereum isn‚Äôt perfect. If it was perfect, what would there be to do? Ethereum has many flaws, but it has incredible potential. This means there are many interesting problems to solve, and that solving those problems matters.\n\n## ‚ÄúIs Ethereum the AOL of Crypto?‚Äù by Albert Wenger\n\nThe gist of Albert‚Äôs [post](https://continuations.com/post/187279569830/is-ethereum-the-aol-of-crypto) is that one area of activity on Ethereum, Decentralized Finance (or ‚ÄúOpen Finance‚Äù if you prefer) may be circularly dependent on a small segment of the Ethereum community for both its funding and its users. There are two arguments there, which I‚Äôll do my best to [steelman](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man):\n\n## **1. Is DeFi dependent on Ethereum for funding?**\n\nAlbert‚Äôs first argument goes like this: DeFi has been a success for Ethereum so far. However, if it is the case that most DeFi companies are being financed ‚Äúby Ethereum‚Äù, then it may create a circular dependency that could be undone by some adverse event, similar to how the dot-com bust undid AOL. For instance, ***if*** most DeFi companies are being funded by large ETH holders selling ETH, and those companies were to fail, this could lower the price of ETH. This in turn would mean there is less funding available for new DeFi companies, meaning less success, meaning a lower ETH price, and on and on.\n\nThe obvious question is simply: is it true that a lot of DeFi is ‚Äúfinanced via Ethereum‚Äù?\n\nAlbert gives two examples of what he means by this:\n\n* When a DeFi project has its own token. I assume the point here is that a project with its own token is financially dependent on the price of that token, which we assume might be correlated with the price of ETH. Such a project might also simply hold a lot of ETH.\n* When a DeFi project is financially supported by organizations or people with large holdings of ETH (e.g. ConsenSys, which he calls out specifically).\n\nSurveying the DeFi industry, Albert‚Äôs claim seems mostly false. Most of the top DeFi projects (1) do not have their own token, and (2) have raised (and continue to raise) outside VC capital.\n\nTo use one metric, out of the 10 top DeFi projects listed on [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/):\n\n* 4 have their own token (MakerDAO, Synthetix, Bancor, Kyber)\n* 8 have raised VC money (MakerDAO, Compound, Synthetix, dYdX, Uniswap, Set, Dharma, wBTC (via Kyber), Bancor, and Kyber)\n* 1 raised money from ConsenSys (Nuo)\n\nThis doesn‚Äôt include other stablecoins like USDT, USDC, Gemini, and others ‚Äî all funded by VC and large exchanges.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt *seem* true that DeFi is being propped up by large ETH holders. What companies or projects is Albert thinking of when he writes this critique, if not the ones listed above?\n\n## **2. Is DeFi dependent on a small circular economy of users?**\n\n**Separate from the AOL analogy, Albert is getting at a deeper question: is it dangerous that so much of DeFi is ‚Äúself-referential‚Äù within Ethereum?**\n\nTraders who want leverage are the primary consumers of lending products, borrowing from ETH holders. Financial services and products (derivatives, trading services, etc) let users interact with or have exposure to a variety of ETH based assets, and some of those assets have little use outside of speculation.\n\n![Source: Alethio (link)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*fS0WHOWlfhuGc00C)\n\nWhether you view the above description as a strike against DeFi probably depends on your frame of reference. On the one hand, it‚Äôs true that the lofty vision of a global alternative financial system that banks the unbanked and provides accessible financial services to the world is far from reality.\n\n**On the other hand, what should we expect?** Ethereum launched 5 years ago, Dai has existed for under 2 years, and DeFi as a proper noun is about 1 year old. Shouldn‚Äôt we expect an emergent financial system to *begin* as a very local phenomenon, while basic infrastructure and services are laid down, before expanding its scope? Even then, isn‚Äôt some amount of self-reference a *good* thing, since it creates demand for ETH?\n\n**It‚Äôs not even *really* true that DeFi is entirely walled off within Ethereum:** see for instance efforts to integrate with Bitcoin like [wBTC](https://www.wbtc.network/) and [tBTC](https://tbtc.network/), or the many companies working to bridge Ethereum to the legacy financial system (here [are](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-and-security-token-exchange-inx-to-raise-130-million-in-landmark-ipo) [three](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/visa-debit-card-available-in-europe-allows-to-spend-dai-stablecoin-anywhere-in-the-world/) [examples](https://www.coindesk.com/national-stock-exchange-becomes-worlds-first-to-list-a-tokenized-security?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=coindesk&utm_term=&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Organic%20) just from the last month). DeFi‚Äôs integration with other ecosystems is just as true at the social level: Bitfinex, a company whose culture is very Bitcoin-centric, used Ethereum for their token sale.\n\n## ‚ÄúSome Thoughts on Crypto‚Äù by Fred Wilson\n\nFred‚Äôs [piece](https://avc.com/2019/09/some-thoughts-on-crypto/) is a bit lighter, and has only a few remarks about Ethereum.\n\n**Fred‚Äôs claims are simple:** Ethereum is hard to build on, it‚Äôs hitting scaling challenges, and ‚Äúmany developers are looking elsewhere.‚Äù\n\n**Yes, Ethereum‚Äôs developer experience still needs improvement**. This has been, and remains, a large priority for the community. But while development on Ethereum is frustrating relative to established areas of software development, it is dominant over every other smart contract platform. Don‚Äôt take my word for it ‚Äî [ask projects who have tried to build on other chains](https://blog.synthetix.io/cross-chain-infrastructure-revisited/) or [incubators who target blockchain startups](https://twitter.com/yossihasson/status/1169571179650322433).\n\n**Yes, some developers *are* looking at other platforms.** They should! It would be irresponsible for any entrepreneur or developer *not* to kick the tires and figure out the best stack for their needs. Especially when many (not yet launched) chains are making incredible claims about their (theoretical) performance.\n\nBut so far, when developers are voting with their [money](https://twitter.com/spencernoon/status/1151214732684222465) and time, the [vast majority of them](https://www.electriccapital.com/electric-research) are still choosing Ethereum:\n\n![Source: Electric Capital (link). Includes both protocol and ecosystem devs, including dapps.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*e-u9Pv4cDwBgT-aH.png)\n\nIn terms of distribution, [Ethereum remains the IBM of our ecosystem.](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/8/31/ethereum-and-the-seven-dwarfs) As more competing chains come online and begin spending their warchests, the Ethereum ecosystem might bleed a few developers. The difference between Ethereum and its competitors is that Ethereum actually *has* developers at risk of leaving.\n\nThe important question isn‚Äôt whether *some* developers build on other platforms, but whether any other chain can displace Ethereum as the de-facto smart contract platform used by the majority of the industry. Does Fred think this is likely? If so, why specifically?\n\nAs for scaling challenges ‚Äî Ethereum is absolutely running up against these ‚Äî an unfortunate side effect of having developers and users on your platform! Your view on whether those challenges are insurmountable will depend on your view of the adoption of layer 2 scaling tech and progress on ETH 2.0, topics too large to cover here.\n\n**The reason Fred‚Äôs piece touched a nerve isn‚Äôt these points by themselves, which are relatively obvious and well-understood concerns.** What set people off was the strange contrast between his disappointment in Ethereum and his other comments.\n\n**For instance, his very next point in the blog post is that ‚ÄúStablecoins \\[‚Ä¶\\] are a bright spot‚Äù**. On twitter, [I pointed out](https://twitter.com/0xstark/status/1169280255254679552) that virtually every stablecoin with any use is an ERC-20, which seems at odds with his dim view of Ethereum. Fred [clarified](https://twitter.com/fredwilson/status/1169288109151924224) that his concern is that they might ‚Äúleave‚Äù Ethereum.\n\nMany stablecoins probably *will* launch alt-versions of themselves on other chains eventually, but it‚Äôs hard to imagine why a project would abandon all of the capital, users, infrastructure, services, and liquidity available to their ERC-20s. Until there is any evidence that developers or users are abandoning Ethereum, isn‚Äôt the success of stablecoins ‚Äî virtually all built on Ethereum ‚Äî a point in its favour?\n\nI am curious what *specific* weaknesses of Ethereum and \\*specific \\*strengths of its imitators motivated Fred‚Äôs post. But it‚Äôs hard to know what to make of his conclusions right now.\n\n**If Ethereum is doing everything wrong, why is the entire crypto industry building on it?** Between Fred publishing his post, and my sitting down to draft this one, [Binance announced plans to launch a USD stablecoin](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/09/05/binance-launching-its-own-usd-pegged-stablecoin-busd-with-paxos-as-custodian/), and [Paxos announced a gold-backed token](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/09/05/paxos-embraces-gold-pegged-crypto-as-sea-change-in-gold-trading/).\n\nBoth will be built on Ethereum.\n\n\n---\n\n***Note:*** *I am (obviously) biased towards Ethereum. I co-founded and operate two Ethereum based companies:* *[L4](http://l4v.io/) (open source state channels) and [ETHGlobal](http://ethglobal.co/) (largest dev relations & on-boarding org in the industry), and I work with the Ethereum Foundation on a few special projects.*\n\n*Thanks to Eric Conner, Ryan Sean Adams, Evan Van Ness, and others for their feedback on this post.*", "timestamp": 1632782852, "digest": "rulb8IDz8ipY9FX3XZo-brIKo-iHVVU_Re-_XrrX9Hs", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}

Mirror is something between a blogging platform, a crowdfunding platform, and a community platform, built for the crypto sector. Mirror is built on decentralized protocols and is a web3 version of all of those things and more.\n\nUsers need a $WRITE token to publish on Mirror and the best way to get $WRITE tokens is to join the Write Race that happens every Wednesday 5pm eastern. Anyone who holds a $WRITE token can vote for new users in the Write Race. The top ten vote getters are airdropped a $WRITE token and can publish on Mirror. \n\nYesterday, Mirror announced that they have expanded this game mechanic to any activity that requires a token. They call it [Token Race](https://dev.mirror.xyz/dLLIq4Iebg5DLWJbOWa3sU6oQuwbogkmqPnz-ZbzPUg).\n\nImagine your DAO wants to admit new members but needs a way to do that. Token Race.\n\nImagine your DAO wants to distribute funds to worthy crypto projects. Token Race.\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nHere is how Token Race works:\n\n> To create a token race, a user specifies the address of the ERC20 token contract to use, uploads a list of proposals that they‚Äôd like their community to vote on, and specifies the minimum number of tokens members need to hold to be eligible to vote. We take a snapshot of balances, and once the voting opens members get to vote on the various proposals proportional to their wallet balance at the block height of the snapshot. Once the voting period ends, winners are selected based on the highest number of votes. All data is backed up on the Filecoin network and accessible via IPFS (h/t¬†[estuary.tech](https://estuary.tech/)) so even if Mirror goes under, your token races are preserved in the annals of the metaverse.\n>\n> https://dev.mirror.xyz/dLLIq4Iebg5DLWJbOWa3sU6oQuwbogkmqPnz-ZbzPUg\n\nSo if you‚Äôve been looking for a tool to do your own version of the Write Race, look no further.
