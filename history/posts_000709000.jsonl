{"id": "71J-3wJKgUE59qlTee-VMFrwMUIxNJoGVjqgorc-oxs", "title": "BLURRED VIBRATIONS", "body": "*This essay was made possible by all of the $MOOD token holders. Editions created by Rachel Rossin. Research assistance by Lauren Burns Coady. Edited by a past collaborator. Thank you to readers Carson Salter, Toby Shorin, and @sub_rrosa.* \n\n*Note on editions: Work by Rachel Rossin. Video made from component parts of a commissioned RPG - navigating a simulated video game made from real estate assets pulled from models for suburban developments.*\n\n## You Really Know How to Make Me Cry\n\nThe other week I received a mysterious package with an unfamiliar return address. I emptied its contents onto my kitchen table and was faced by two inscrutable objects: a raw muslin handkerchief with the words “Happier Than Ever” embroidered in beige thread, and a card with white borders and an oddly printed beige background with brown script text “thank you for all of your support / can’t wait for you to hear what we’ve been working on / love billie” Why was I receiving such niceties from one of the world’s biggest pop stars? Probably not because I was stringing together thousands of words on the recent R.J. Cutler documentary *[The World’s A Little Blurry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7VHYBkCbF4)* and Billie Eilish’s distinct vibe. But probably because I had drunkenly purchased an oversized red sweatshirt with a large bikini-clad, winged anime angel named “Princess Blurry” on it for $120 a few weeks prior from her online merch store. The postcard remains on my fridge as I write this.\n\nIt would be a mistake to take the title of her forthcoming album at face value. Happier Than Ever is a sardonic effort to draw our attention to vibe above all else. Vibe has been the primary medium in Eilish’s construction of self, and while she has designated vibe as the fulcrum of her oeuvre, media coverage rarely does. A typical profile on Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell tends to break down to the following component parts: her young age (she’s only nineteen), her SoundCloud based ascent to stardom/virality (\"[Ocean Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viimfQi_pUw&feature=youtu.be)\", a song produced for a dance routine at fourteen), her deeply collaborative (at times unsettling) relationship with her brother, Finneas, their site of musical production (the O’Connell home in Highland Park, Los Angeles) and the core, foggily defined aspect that distinguishes her from a sea of high ponytailed, hyper-produced, competitively positive contemporary popular musicians — her vibe.\n\nThe psychiatric field distinguishes between mood disorders, anxiety disorders and personality disorders. Mood disorders, such as depression and bi-polar disorder, are characterized by emotional/arousal states that are distorted or inconsistent with circumstances. Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, avoidance and apprehension. Personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder, are characterized by \"[long-term patterns of behavior and inner experiences that differ significantly from what is expected](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/personality-disorders/what-are-personality-disorders).\" Mood is something one is overcome by, not triggered by a single object or stimulus, but oftentimes by a complex constellation of inputs. Emotions can emerge from moods and/or contribute to moods - but the point is that moods are more simple in terms of valence (positive-negative) whereas emotions are often stimulus contingent (even if the stimulus is sometimes a mood itself). A mood has a more complex and elusive set of contributing factors, whereas an emotion can more readily be linked to an object. Mood is what we feel, what we are overcome by, regardless of what we may think about it.\n\nEilish openly speaks about her experience of mood disorders —depression and its attendant suicidal tendencies feed heavily into her work. The particular varietal of depressive affect that is expressed through her voice is soft and dark, yet protective, which stands in stark contrast to her pop musical peers' belting to the point of vocal break. Rihanna-tic or Sia-esque belting intensities that escalate to full-on rupture, fissure, and crack—or Britney’s baby-esque, whiny fry—both perform vocalic self-harm. Whereas Eilish’s voice evokes a sense of bottoming out, a whisper that struggles to maintain its own presence. In *The World’s A Little Blurry*, Finneas directs Billie to sing in a “babier” voice, not in the self-harming Britney way, but in a way that communicates even further vulnerability and desire for care. All of this is expressed not only through lyrics but in the plush tenor of her voice that asymptotically approaches the brink of tears.\n\nHer voice emerges from a deep interiority, not as a reflection of the world, but as a product of an inner world. The latent resonance of Finneas’s bedroom—where Eilish’s albums are written and produced—permeates each song. \"[bad guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI&feature=youtu.be)\"’s deep and rumbling introductory bassline is felt as much as it is heard. In \"[everything i wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgBJmlPo8Xw),\" the sound we hear is a response before identifying its stimulus—the introductory piano vibrates and side chains in reaction to an inaudible kick drum track. The opening vocals in \"[when the party’s over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbMwTqkKSps)\" convey the emotional tug of an oncoming sob. Eilish’s music triggers a physical response akin to ASMR—it is embodied, it is present, it is immanent.\n\nThe chill depressiveness, or downer haze ([Mark Fisher’s phrase](https://www.electronicbeats.net/started-from-the-bottom-mark-fisher-on-drakes-nothing-was-the-same/) for Drake’s breed of sadness), is countered by the physical intensity of her live performances. There, she does not perform self-harm through vocal breaks, but rather performs a physical expression of self harm through repeated corporal injury such as shin splints and sprained ankles. Eilish’s depressive mood is performed at an intensity high enough to function as mass pop music, but, unlike the intensity of EDM drops or Millennial whoops, her intensity is defined through the layering of sonic vibrations of a deep and low, rather than high-pitched register. It seems to erupt from the ground beneath. It’s mere shades from a brown note. She is singing at a 4 while performing—through movement, color and fashion—at 11. \n\nThe concrete elements of Eilish’s oeuvre—age, SoundCloud, Finneas, bedroom—are often discussed on equal footing to the mood engendered by her music, rather than addressing this high-intensity depressive affect as the overwhelming aspect that colors everything else. As we are seeing with the announcement of Happier Than Ever, a radical departure from the dominant tone of *When We All Fall Asleep…*, affect is at the core of Eilish’s work. Even with this shift, she retains an under girdle of depressive mood through her almost troll-y facial expression. Moods and their corresponding colors—Eilish has synesthesia after all—are how she has chosen to organize her young career.\n\n*The World’s A Little Blurry* is an object lesson on affect theory that centers these nuances in her work, all while meta-cinematically reproducing her vibe of depressive intensity in the structure and tone of the film itself. The bedroom setting, the chronology of depressive time—no past, no future, just overwhelming immediacy—are the stage and chronology to study affect and the greater vibe economy that Eilish trades in, bringing an otherwise inarticulable blur into sharp focus.\n\n[me to make you my art](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=6)\n\n## You Can Take The Girl Out of the Bedroom\n\nDuring the span of the film, Eilish engages in a wide, life-altering swath of activities from getting her driver’s license to recording her first album, touring internationally, performing at Coachella, and winning seven Grammys. Individually, any of these would serve as a substantial documentary subject, yet Cutler focuses in on the unifying affect, and how Billie herself is an advanced participant in the vibe economy. Eilish rose to fame on SoundCloud on the strength of a single, \"Ocean Eyes,\" which was created on her former a dance instructor’s prompt. Up until *When We All Fall Asleep*, Eilish had only released a series of bangers. This allows Cutler to document the interstitial phase between the initial ascent and the ensuing trajectory — he begins after his subject is established as a global sensation, but before the release of her first “official” album. Eilish is inarguably a phenomenon when the film starts. The album, then, is a bit of a bait and switch for legacy media to engage with her work, arriving at the conclusion that millions of fans already know. In *Blurry,* vibe replaces a chronology of achievement with a consistently calibrating sound, image, and overarching ambience. Privileging the communication of vibe over linear time aptly suits an auteur, in the sense of one who thrives when exercising total world-building control around a coherent collection of aesthetic and affect-oriented decisions.\n\nAs revealed in the film, Eilish was a true Belieber—perhaps the truest of them all. She participated in the cult of relatability made possible by early-stage social media. In her parasocial relationship with Bieber, she felt as if he spoke to her and only her. She projected an endless feedback loop of shared emotions, and became lovesick to the point where her mother, Maggie Baird, considered therapy for the tweenage affliction.  Baird says of Billie “I remember driving her to dance class and just thinking ‘How are we going to cope with this? How are we going to cope?’ She was LOVESICK, you know, just like, desperately in love with Justin Bieber.” Bieber’s conveyance of intimacy and relatability, when technologically mediated, created a global, ravenous fandom. While pop music has historically had this potential —Beatlemania, etc.—the scale and ability to participate in this collective mood on-demand, all the time, with the intimacy of social viewership—watching videos in bed, holding a screen in your hand—has amplified the sense of connection and personal investment. This parasocial projection of intimacy is a defining characteristic of the vibe economy. Vibe economies, unlike post-recession aspirational lifestyle commerce, result in collective identification — as opposed to atomized individual curation — à la being a Belieber.\n\nA fundamental aspect that Eilish and Bieber share is that they both were–Eilish still is—bedroom pop. Teenage (and formerly teenage) stars not only normalize the angst of being confined to one’s bedroom, but also professionalize that space. They conflate run-of-the-mill identify formation that occurs within the confines of those four walls with launching a global career. For Eilish, Bieber’s bedroom was a field of intimacy she had access to thanks to YouTube. Bedroom performances, whether they be musical or general vlogging, have become a canonical form to the extent that the necessities associated with this domestic site of production have become aesthetic elements in their own rights: multi-monitor setups, background art, wall decals, LED ring lights.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/629bee4f-ddb3-4eb9-a129-3caf77458643.png?height=968&width=1885)\n\nCutler, acknowledging the primacy of the domestic bedroom space in Eilish’s identity/career formation, takes the bedroom as a site of production and performance and transposes that intimate, enclosed space across planes, cars, and hotel rooms throughout the film. Billie exists in an expanded domestic arena—even when on stage she is often performing on top of a rigged bed, reminding everyone in both the concert and film’s audience — that wherever Billie goes, the bedroom goes with her. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4e22fc2-5cee-4b11-9a63-471ad2f8fd02.png?height=971&width=1649)\n\nFor the O’Connell children, the bedroom is a live-work space. Throughout the film we see Finneas at his work station while Billie sits on his bed, an arms-reach away. While Finneas’ bedroom might be the “studio,” Billie’s bedroom—like any teenage girls’ — is the site of construction for her identity and femininity.\n\nAs has been argued by a litany of feminist researchers, specifically as cited in Anita Harris’ work *Future Girl: Young Women in the Twenty-First Century* (2004), a young woman’s bedroom is a much more fundamental site of meaning-making than the street or (public arena). Because young women are generally more restricted to the home than young men, their bedrooms become private spaces to experiment with both dominant and alternative ideologies about what it means to be a young woman. All of this is blown out to another level when the bedroom becomes the broadcast point for an audience to witness what was, pre-social media and networked technologies, a private experience [1]. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e23ee493-685e-41a7-80de-b937b448a58a.png?height=969&width=1880)\n\nAt a particular moment in the film when we see Eilish Instagram Live from her bedroom with her pet tarantula, one specific feminine teenage subjectivity emerges — social celebrity and influencer. Not in the aspiration lifestyle sense, but in the e-girl sense. E-girls, loosely defined as a young person trading in internet aesthetics, projecting their youth, hotness, and vibe via Twitch, TikTok, Instagram or other social platforms, construct their digital personas in the privacy of their bedrooms. E-girl, a term originating to refer to young women in the gaming space, where they broadcast themselves, from their bedrooms, on Twitch, to a broader aesthetic category associated with TikTok. The bedroom’s privacy has long become public as it proliferates social platforms. Billie Eilish’s bedroom is an infiltrated private space, a nexus of production where the intimate goes global. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5efc4085-071b-491b-931c-3d5157acd4db.png?height=971&width=1885)\n\nCutler’s expanded bedroom becomes a chamber play set where Billie’s feminine identity formation takes place. On this stage, we see affective nuances and blurs take hold as a nascent subjectivity tests its roles and boundaries with others. We see these transposed bedrooms in car and plane interiors, hotel rooms, a tour bus at Coachella. Cutler boldly overlays text disclaiming whichever city or continent we’re in: Salt Lake City, New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Houston, Milan, Europe, Australia and the United States. Before almost every location title card, Cutler inserts a slow and solemn shot of Billie gazing sadly out a window or off into space—we witness interiority in transit. You can take the girl out of the bedroom but you can't take the bedroom out of the girl. We are given these indicators because very little of the exterior world is let in. No matter where we are, we’re in the bedroom.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0c0a5e2f-b0e0-4b23-8054-cf301283045c.png?height=912&width=1879)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eb17ff53-9be7-47e5-8874-fcfe8ca551a9.png?height=975&width=1881)\n\nIn one scene, Finneas’s bedroom is invaded by record label executives basically drooling as they hear \"i love you\" and \"my strange addiction\" for the first time. Billie—the only woman, and teenager at that—is clearly being objectified by all the older men in the room. There are many intentions present, some at odds with each other: in this moment Finneas is caught between needing to hype up record execs, while down-shifting his enthusiasm towards Billie. He has, after all, been charged with the covert task of making a hit without letting her know it. Billie, meanwhile, slouches on Finneas’s bed, looking fully disinterested in the executives. You can see their discomfort, being in a casual, domestic interior space with this young woman who is integral to their success. Affect is the liminal shimmers between individuals, it is the forces of impact between one subject and another [9]. We are witnessing the emotional and physical responses between each character, and it is uncomfortable as fuck, on every possible level. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9327cfb2-03f2-43e0-963f-e24bf546ade4.png?height=971&width=1883)\n\n[and i'm too far behind](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=8)\n\n## Vibe Economics  \n### Got a mood that you wish you could sell\n\nWhile at times awkward as fuck, affect can also be instrumentalized to create a sense of belonging and collective identity—see: hype beast culture. Eilish is both a consumer of hypebeast culture—as seen in her is repeatedly referenced personal sneaker collection—as well as a producer of it. Her branded merchandise operates on a drop cycle similar to Supreme and sells out at a similar speed. The “Princess Blurry” hoodie was only my second choice after realizing that all of her mom-themed merch was sold out. Social celebrity and streetwear exist at the point of intersection between lifestyle and vibe. Lifestyle—as expressed, curated and consumed on social media in it’s post-recession, aspirational iteration—is about object dependence. Lifestyle is an individually focused form of consumption that exists in the overlap between class and status, as [Max Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-component_theory_of_stratification) had it. While many individuals may be embodying or practicing a similar lifestyle, lifestyle does not lead to collective identification. Lifestyle plays out in an atomized society where the delineation between private and public space looms large and consumption differences between status groups stand in stark relief. While one kind of class identity describes a relationship to the means of production, status groups are just as often organized by reference to the means of consumption, that is, by lifestyle.  A consumer’s lifestyle—as laid out by writer [Daisy Alioto](https://www.whatislifestyle.com/)[2]—is a set of object relations, with attachments fueled by nostalgia, early memories and personal association. In contrast, products and experiences in the vibe economy are rooted in the present and often bleed into phenomenological or social experiences, for instance an immersive experience or standing in line with hundreds of people for hours.\n\nThe vibe economy is a collectively-oriented evolution in lifestyle— those that produce and purvey it manufacture scarcity, and one of the defining aspects is the viewing of consumer goods as investment assets where one can extract social capital or financial capital. Sneakers and apparel exist to be bought and resold via the entire experiential and pseudo-museuological culture complex that has formed around streetwear. What makes hypebeast culture different from the post-recession version of lifestyle as we know it is that aspirational, socially mediated lifestyle is about individual comparison and distinction, without an aspect of collective mood-making or participatory moments. \n\nThe hypebeast culture that Eilish plays in as both consumer and producer exemplifies the greater vibe economy, which includes elements of individualist lifestyle commerce while being based on participation and exchange. It is as much about buying the sneaker, posting it and reselling it as it is going out and standing in line. Producers in the vibe economy don’t solely make objects, they make experiences. In *Blurry* we see brief clips of Eilish’s immersive album experience that, as a giant wall text explains, aims to bring the album to life by recreating her embodied synesthetic experience. At the entrance of the experience is a Billie cardboard cutout with a projected head, wearing baggy red basketball shorts, black Jordans, and an oversized mobster Bugs Buggy t-shirt. The vibe here is produced by a constellation of signifiers and references, each of which, isolated, are individually complex, but collectively simple, as Peli Grietzer articulates in his influential [Theory of Vibe](https://www.glass-bead.org/article/a-theory-of-vibe/?lang=enview) [3]. “Simple” in this application can be explained as something which is immediately registered, and though potentially inarticulable, is felt and either phenomenologically or at some instinctive level understood.  In an interview, Eilish describes the experience as “an exhibit, a museum, a place to smell, hear and feel. Every room has a certain temperature, a certain feel, a certain color, a certain texture on the walls, a certain shape, a certain number…” All of these things may add up to a representation of a synesthetic’s experience of the world, but it also adds up to an aesthetic unity—it’s her vibe, and we’re all just living in it. When considered on a whole, this vibe is a curated set of objects and phenomena that make up the imaginative landscape of the work.  \n\nVibe economies are rooted in exchange, they are rhythmic and cyclical, as opposed to being aspirational and linear.  Lifestyle is primarily about mimesis, while the vibe economy becomes a stage for collective catharsis. Vibe currency is rooted in cultural lineages, vocabularies, and is community oriented. Oftentimes lifestyle products and services modulate individual emotions (e.g. Spotify “chill” playlist, a Dosist pen). These are primarily used in service of individual optimization, and to be consumed in a solo, rather than social environment. Vibe comes into play then these affects become socially relational. One can, of course, vibe out on their own. Vibing out alone most often occurs when an individual is in a dissociative, ketamine-esque state, conscious of how an external or disembodied eye might perceive them. Vibes only exist in as much as they are emitted by one subject and received by a real or imagined other. This relationality makes the vibe-based economy an arena where affective nuances can be witnessed and analyzed. \n\nCutler’s film focuses not on actions, but how Billie’s emotional expressions—how they take form through her speech, singing, styling and physical performance—play out and impact those around her. One such scene takes place during a late June performance at an open-air venue in NYC’s South Street Seaport, where a post-breakup Eilish sits cross-legged on a levitating bed frame with her brother. She sings “We fall apart as it gets dark/I'm in your arms in Central Park,” with the mic held close, choking back tears to reach the next repeated lines of “I love you’s.” Finneas reaches his arm around his sister in consolation, while Cutler cuts to the tear-streamed faces of a young female audience, who stand shoulder to shoulder, staring forward, singing in unison. The song is filled with broad-swathed emotional generalities that afford enough ambiguity to deeply resonate with each fan’s unique breed of sadness and longing. It’s not the content, but the mood that moves them. And the mood is not expressed solely through the music; the lighting design’s rich, dark hues, and even the unseasonably dour weather—[\"which was downright gloomy: dark, clammy, cloudy and threatening to rain at any second”](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/concert-review-billie-eilish-mesmerizes-new-york-audience-spooky-night-1203247285/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1623778387072000&usg=AOvVaw1qcOu268KP2t0LSbaq2IeC)—  aided in creating a gesamt-vibe work. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8f979149-df1a-43a1-a855-17f126dbb737.png?height=963&width=1878)\n\nThis scene’s audience is an ad hoc manifestation of collective desire and purpose. That purpose: a shared vibe, a sense of feeling seen by and belonging with others who are similarly afflicted with similar “non-productive” sad or depressive emotions. This cohesion is exemplary of a collective mood as described by Ludwig Fleck [4], wherein “the force which maintains the collective and unites its members is derived from the community of the collective mood. This mood produces the readiness for an identically directed perception, evaluation and use of what is perceived, i.e. a common thought-style.”  This collective mood can be defined by a unifying sadness, which to be clear is not unique to Eilish or her fandom. What makes Eilish’s affect unique is, again, the intensity of physical and stylistic performance, as well as the capacity —the malleability or augmentability—for how it’s received by an audience [5]. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/38b9d934-ed8e-4f5a-a0f4-eb36015e3df8.png?height=973&width=1879)\n\nHow does one differentiate the terms emotion, mood, vibe and affect? One defining aspect of contemporary vibes are that they are socially relational and only exist in as much as they are either expressed by one subject and received by another or generated through collective expressions of emotion or intent. Vibes are the excess of material reality, making them akin to a Benjaminian aura. They are not neutral, and if taken synonymously with Sianne Ngai’s definition of tone in Ugly Feelings, vibes can represent a subject’s ideology—and so, represent a structure of [a] subjectivity and touch upon the structure of the social-material conditions structuring [a] subjectivity [6].  Another way of understanding vibes, as they are produced in the receiver’s imaginative landscape and how that corresponds to a linguistically articulable material reality is to differentiate between dense vibes in the imaginative landscape associated with a work or person, where these dense vibes act as a structural representation a loose vibe of the collective objects and phenomena of a real-world domain.   Loose vibes emerge from curated sets of objects, elements, references, etc. and are received as dense vibes in an individual or collective imaginative, non-linguistic landscape. \n\nFor emotion, mood or affect, there are operational, discipline-specific, somewhat competing definitions across various fields that leave these distinctions in flux. Emotion is a mental response directly linked to neurophysiological stimuli—perceptions, memories, experiences, physical sensations—which is bucketed into conceptual categories that are, in themselves learned cultural objects, e.g. the 6 basic emotions: sadness, fear, anger, happiness, disgust, surprise. Emotions also emerge from any disruption in physical homeostasis, e.g. experiencing hanger, or coming down with a cold converging with a bout of depression. Neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett further explains this emotion/stimuli response as \"Your brain is always regulating and it’s always predicting what the sensations from your body are to try to figure out how much energy to expend. When those sensations are very intense, we typically use emotion concepts to make sense of those sensory inputs. We construct emotions\" [7].  Mood, very closely related to vibe, is not externally nor internally produced, but it rather arises out of the condition of being-in-the-world. Where vibe is relationally produced, and aesthetically oriented, a mood, or Heideggerian Stimmung, is the precondition for, and medium of all more specific operations of subjectivity [8].  This is differentiated from a pathologized definition of mood disorders, though has a commonality in that it is more than a literalist experience of given circumstances.\n\nWhat distinguishes affect in the context of Affect Theory and the philosophical discourse surrounding emotion and sociality from mood or emotion is its relationality (to the world) and interrelatedness (an embodied force that influences the mind). While emotion is the internalized, psychological sense, affect is a relational, psycho-biological sense that exists as the body experiences the world and comes into contact with other forces.  Distinguishing “affect” from pure “emotion” derives from Spinoza’s definition of the term, wherein affect is the shift produced in a body (including the mind) by an interaction with another body, which increases or diminishes the body’s power of activity, or potentia agendi. In Spinoza’s definition, affect designates the mode, state or quality of a body's relation to the world. \n\nAffect is produced at the point of interaction, transition, encounter and interrelatedness. It arises in the midst of in-between-ness: in the capacities to act and be acted upon. It is, in many ways, synonymous with forces of encounter. Because affect emerges out of muddy, unmediated interrelatedness and not in some dialectical reconciliation of cleanly oppositional elements or primary units, it makes easy compartmentalization give way to thresholds and tensions, blends and blurs.  The inherent between-ness and interstitial nature of affect makes it quite difficult to point to what, where and how these things occur and take form. \n\nAn affective-oriented cultural analysis includes emotions that have progressively left behind to unfold regimes of expression that are more concretely social such as crowd behaviors, contagions of feeling or matters of belonging. It shifts focus toward non-linguistic modalities, those that either do not or cannot have truly isomorphic relations to words. These are the unarticulated motivators which are not necessarily equivalent to impulse or instinct, but closer to them than explicit communication. Beyond sociality, they are also the operating system for contemporary consumer and financial capital. To put it bluntly, hypebeast culture, SPACs, crypto-markets, social media and other technologies that extract value from emotional engagement all operate in a sphere where affect is the medium. The mood is the message. \n\n[my limbs all froze](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=11)\n\n## More Than a Feeling\n\nCutler’s focus on the nuance of vibe surrounding Billie Eilish did not result in rave reviews. Those familiar with his oeuvre wondered why the critically acclaimed documentarian who had previously centered Bill Clinton and Anna Wintour now chose Eilish for a subject. Negative reviews focused on the film's lack of a center, its drawn out timeline, and the general lack of a “there” there. As Monica Castillo criticized, “the film itself can sometimes feel like it meanders off, squeezing in a random tour shot here, another scene of Eilish goofing off there. The core drama and story is there, but a few scenes don’t add to the narrative, only extend it\" [10].  The film makes more sense considered in the context of recent literary works which focus in on the inter-relational shimmers, the unspoken and unarticulated forces at play between individuals as they come into contact with one another and the world at large. One such work, Kathleen Stewart and Lauren Berlant’s recent book, The Hundreds, unpacks the unseen/unconscious processes inherent in a subject’s worldmaking. When viewed as a similar study, *Blurry* brings out the affective nuances that are taking place between Billie, her family, her fans, and the world. \n\nThis approach is strikingly different from the traditional music documentary genre camps. Music, especially pop music documentaries are seductively ham-fisted: they center around the recording of a specific song or album, tour, concert or festival—see D.A. Pennebaker’s *[Don’t Look Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1inL6s1htio&feature=youtu.be)* or The Maysel Brother’s *[Gimme Shelter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7UsBmavjsE&feature=youtu.be)*. These narrative frames provide a legible, linear timeline with distinct beginnings and ends. There are clear moments that allow for conflict to bloom—on the tour bus, in the recording studio—and successes or failures to be evaluated—the record goes platinum, the band breaks up. Cutler’s previous documentaries, *[The War Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgo-qwfCFYU)* (as producer) and *[The September Issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph7HLll8XmA)* follow the similarly linear timeline of a political campaign and magazine issue release respectively. \n\nA second approach is the more intimate, verité character study that takes a mercurial, what-will-they-do-next musician, and documents their alchemical, virtuosic creative practice— see Les Blank’s documentary about Leon Russell, [*A Poem is a Naked Person*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1D65LMlZiw). This study often goes one of two ways: either depicting a redemptive arc wherein a musician, stymied by various afflictions from songwriter’s block to mental illness, addiction, or the crushing weight of success, finds salvation through creation. Otherwise, the film becomes an exercise in schadenfreude, leading us down the spirals of one person’s private hellscape. Recent pop music documentaries have tended to follow this vérité format. [Katy Perry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVSXCphR6Ww&feature=youtu.be), [Lady Gaga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxI1iOi0t-c&feature=youtu.be), and [Arianna Grande](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHwcvnyiolA&feature=youtu.be)’s documentaries are singular character studies. They shy away from rooting these individuals within a broader community or cultural landscape, instead positioning them as singular pop subjects existing only in relation to themselves, their inner circles, their fans, and in a few cases, one another. This directorial tunnel vision operates in the lineage of romantic, virtuosic character studies, while creating a format that can, in equal footing, operate as an extended album release trailer or advertorial for the record labels that—in many cases—fund the film’s production. Partially or fully bank-rolled documentaries come off as spleen-less, neutered promos that communicate a siloed redemption without couching the narrative in a cultural context. They exist in an advertorial uncanny valley, as exemplified by Demi Lovato’s 2018 docuseries *Dancing With The Devil*, which balances reality-tv style confessionals with archival footage while the sponsoring CrossFit brand’s logo periodically glints across the screen. While Cutler’s film is legally authored by Interscope Records–a fact that we are reminded of at the end of the credits with the disclaimer “Interscope Records is the author of this cinematographic or audiovisual work.”– it does not pander to its corporate master. What *Blurry’s* negative reviews fail to grasp is that this film is in a sense a tone poem, where the wandering immersion into Billie’s world is necessary when neither the star herself nor her music are the “product” as much as is the aura surrounding them.\n\n*Blurry* is neither a tour, record nor concert film. It flows along an amorphous spatiotemporality, opting instead for a cinéma vérité approach that lets action unfold as it would unobserved. Cutler resists the genre's narrative tropes, primarily by transforming the directorial role into one of director-as-psychoanalyst. Over the course of the film, milestones take place—international concert and press tours, Coachella, the Grammys—but he utilizes his position to observe and listen as character-revealing insight (over action) unfolds. Through his lens, we view the O’Connell family as they create their own hierarchy of meaning, which is revealed through a version of cinematic talk therapy at both the individual and familial level. \n\nAs an analyst, Cutler is following the threads placed forth by his subjects—listening, following, and waiting for recurrent themes to emerge. As the audience, we are also trying to structure a hierarchy of our own attention. What is important? Possible options include: the oddly functional family dynamic, Billie and Finneas’s struggle to produce a banger that alienates absolutely no one, her disintegrating, dysfunctional relationship with her boyfriend Q, the physical injuries she sustains on tour, the matte black Dodge Challenger… *Blurry* is a sea of aspects that are only recognized in their importance after watching the entire film. Major or minor threads can only be determined once you’ve seen the whole of a subject’s investment in a theme. That is why the Challenger looms larger than the Grammys. It means more to Billie, in that it is a unique moment of differentiation and independence from the family unit, whereas the Grammy only further unifies it. The Challenger is hers (“mine”), the Grammy is theirs (“ours”). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7091d063-83ff-4cb9-9db2-73b88481a49a.png?height=969&width=1874)\n\nThis confusion over hierarchy of meaning is articulated by Billie in a particularly Brechtian moment. After a post-breakup concert in New York, she is ushered back into the public for a series of meet-and-greets with record label shills. Her Tourette Syndrome kicks in due to the high stress situation, she keeps trying to leave, and keeps being goaded back to her public. The morning after, she is riding in a van with her mother and team, and vents about a comment she received where a fan thought her rude the previous evening. She scolds her team, letting them know that they’ve failed her, and says, “Nobody tells me who’s important. All of you said I could go back and I hear ‘Billie, Billie, Billie, Billie.’ All I hear is “Billie,” so how am I supposed to know that’s an important ‘Billie’.” Well, Billie, we too are waiting to be told.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/945a9e2f-b272-4834-a5a8-7632e1b9f209.png?height=972&width=1877)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9f85e54a-72a8-449d-9ba8-ac52004eaadd.png?height=969&width=1881)\n\nThis psychoanalytic directorial approach and de-hierarchization of meaning is the foundational lens that positions *Blurry* as an object study in affect theory. This is furthered by the film’s interior, chamber play-like stage where affective encounters can take place within an expanded “bedroom,” as well as the fractured and extended use of a chronology that mirrors the futureless experience of depressive time.\n\n[the day you couldn't stay](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=12)\n\n## Always Already\n### But I (I) I'm in love (Love, love, love, love) With My Future\n\nAfter another one of *Blurry’s* bedroom moments at Coachella—where Billie has a brief intimate interlude with her withholding paramour, Q—she goes on to perform one of the largest concerts in her short life. Nerves abound as she waits backstage, watching the LED-screen backdrop glitch out. Fans yell “Fuck the screen” from the audience. Techs take too long to fix it, and Billie is told that she’ll have to cut two songs from her set. She is clearly distraught, leaving xanny by the wayside. We then see her performance start, with the screen still flickering behind her. She forgets words, she stumbles, and then she stops. The screen’s white light illuminates the stage behind her, and she directly addresses the crowd:\n\n> *“I just want us all to be in the moment for this song because I feel like in life we tend to do things then we’re always looking forward to the next thing and the next thing after that and we’re never thinking about what’s happening right now, and this is happening right now, this is crazy. And like, we and I, are never gonna be in this moment ever again no matter what, this exact moment right here. Never again. Ever. this is the only chance we get to be in the moment, so why don’t we be in the moment, yea?”*\n\nIn this moment, we too, the film’s audience, are thrust out of cinematic time and urged to root ourselves in the present—a present that is exactly sixty-seven minutes through the documentary. No man ever steps in the same river twice, Heraclitus said, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man. We have changed during the course of this film, and somewhere out there, so has Billie. This rootedness in the present, while apexed with this Brechtian aside, exists throughout the film. While the genre tends to heavily rely on archival footage, *Blurry* does not. There are brief clips from her childhood, dancing, singing, fanning out about Bieber, but Billie’s past does not play a central role. Her mother alludes to the family’s moments of precarity, but without divulging specifics. The film is largely devoid of anecdotes or nostalgia. There is an ahistorical nature to the film and its subjects, which feels mostly in service of a protestant efficiency above all else. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5c090ff7-d772-4847-ad12-2d33941d0962.png?height=968&width=1885)\n\nThe entirety of the film follows a loose linearity, marked with specific moments that indicate the forward movement of time. Billie gets her learner’s permit, then her license. Billie and Finneas record the album, release the album, and win Grammys. Everything in between feels interchangeable, and the lack of historicity, as well as the lack of articulation of future hopes and intentions, creates the sense of presence that is most directly articulated at Coachella. This mirrors the experience of depressive time, with its sense of foreshortened future and altered experience of temporal passage. The phenomenological experience of time for the depressive can often lack a clear vision of a future, often because of an overwhelming loss of life narrative or sense of general doomed-ness. This can sometimes be paired with a fixation on and inability to move beyond past traumas, if any “causation” can be rooted in a specific traumatic experience. This does not necessarily seem to be the case for Billie, at least based on what is divulged on camera. Throughout the film, we hear of her depression and self-harm—in one early scene she walks us through her journals, stating “I was in such a bad place. Wow… this page was kinda like the peak, I would say. I was like, fourteen-fifteen. I had razors hidden in places and I had bandaids hidden in a little corner of my room and I always had bandaids on my wrists. I was literally locking myself in the bathroom and making myself bleed because I thought I deserved it, you know?” Cutler then cuts to the drawings and text adorning her bedroom walls, with oozing ghoulish scribbles, and fragmentary statements like “an intense feeling of the absolute end / of a miserable state of mind and unenviable lifestyle / utterly dispirited or defected / the joy I had seems like somebody elses…”. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b0affe93-c0f6-40df-8538-1a7b0e6689e6.png?height=977&width=1886)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3737fdd5-f053-43f2-b09a-26390861b99b.png?height=971&width=1885)\n\nWhile our curiosity is piqued, and we might want to seek out a “why,” even though there is absolutely no need for depression to be linked to a specific traumatic instance, Maggie dissuades us with her explanation that depression is a condition of contemporary existence. She validates the trauma of Billie’s generation, born post 9/11, into a world of climate catastrophe, recession, etc. The mother is, in turn, defending her own trauma, which can be epigenetically linked to her daughter’s. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9bfd834-5e93-4453-a010-befe369a3b33.png?height=972&width=1880)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/540d0f50-09eb-4b1b-9528-bf93f18b7762.jpeg?height=966&width=1878)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b00f13d4-61a3-4a1b-af5c-7dc07701a849.jpeg?height=968&width=1881)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8b49909c-50af-403b-b0ba-60484128df9b.png?height=970&width=1878)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5a185f58-f10d-40b9-a4be-3ba008f9926b.png?height=971&width=1881)\n\n## Sad Girls\n\nBillie Eilish’s depressive vibe and performance thereof exists in a long cultural lineage of sad girls. The sad girls currently dominating social media are young women expressing stylized aspects of sadness and depression, largely aestheticizing mental illness. This particular expression of (predominantly white) sad girl emerged around a decade ago, dominating early Tumblr and Instagram feeds, and converged with and was epitomized by Lana del Rey’s 2012 album Born to Die. Associated with pale colors and faded hues, sad girl aesthetics communicate a baby-ish vulnerability and need for care. It conflates sadness with taste, building out a fully formed world of visual references, limiting beauty standards, and aesthetics. Sad girl logic is not without politics, and positions the expression of sadness as an empowered position of protest to a heteronormative, brightsiding culture of toxic positivity. Lana’s sad girl marked a turn in popular culture, a turn away from what critical theorist Anita Harris defines as “can-do girls,” or “a unique category of girls who are self-assured, living lives lightly inflected but by no means driven by feminism . . . assuming they can have (or at least buy) it all.” The Spice Girls and girl power of the nineties are examples of such.  In contrast, Lana’s sadness refuses these expectations of the “empowered” can-do girl, with her traction suggesting a collective disaffection of—and resistance to—this mandate for productivity, ambition, assertiveness and independence. Lana, like Billie in some ways, embodies the “at risk” more than the “can-do” feminine subject, though while Lana plays as more of a doomed, caged bird, Billie reads as more of a disaffected youth who may need talking down from the proverbial or literal ledge. As sociologist Heather Mooney states in her essay Sad Girls and Carefree Black Girls: Affect, Race, (Dis)Possession, and Protest states, “Sad Girls are resistant to the affective hegemony of white girlhood, their protest follows familiar paths of white performance and becoming: commodification, ownership, and mobility/expansion\" [11].  Sad girl resistance is recuperated back into aestheticization and commodification. \n\nThough having peaked in the cultural zeitgeist over the past decade, sad girls did not emerge from a desaturated void in the beginning of the twenty-teens—like so many social media subjectivities, it is deeply appropriative.  \nThe sad girl typology originally emerged from Lantinx culture, prominently present in Billie’s neighborhood of Highland Park, Los Angeles. This ur-archetype was not in response to the liberated pressures of feminist empowerment, but rather a Catholic, male-led society that designates very specific, at times oppressive roles for women. It is a form of protest against often violent, patriarchal society. Billie’s form of sad girl conflates both the early twenty teens' iteration and its appropriative origins. Some of her stylings and aesthetic interests directly lift from Latinx sad girls—we see [Soto](https://shop.officialsoto.com/products/body-pillow-case)’s artwork in her bedroom—which makes contextual sense in that it’s the culture that surrounds her youth and home. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/15872630-ee65-42cf-b6bc-f48aa52d51f0.png?height=974&width=1885)\n\nWhile sad girl is a gendered archetype, Billie’s valence is also complicated by its reflection of a SoundCloud rapper sad boy typology as played out by Lil Peep or even Takeshi6x9. While Billie emerged from the same platform, these sad boys’ depression has been shaped by a very different breed of anguish: domestic violence, systemic racial injustice, and class-related white misery, all of which then resulted in self harm in the form of drug abuse and violence against themselves and others. While Eilish does not lay claim to any of these sad boy SoundCloud rappers’ trauma, her aesthetic is a hybridized version of LatinX Sad Girl, SoundCloud Sad Boy, and #pale Tumblr and Instagram Sad Girl.\n\nEilish’s sad girl positioning comes through in her choice of aesthetic partners. As mentioned, she is a fan of and has collaborated with the artist Soto, as well as working with notable sad girl photographer Petra Collins. Collins has earned this moniker through her photographic and filmic work that centers a hyper-feminine gaze, depicting young women in moody, dream-like colorscapes. Collins’ work trades in emotional vulnerability and depicts her subjects in moments of inward reflection, furthering the mystification of a young woman’s interior world. Collins’ aesthetic emerged from the pastel Tumblr iteration of sad girls, whereas Eilish, slightly younger and native to newer platforms such as Instagram, Soundcloud and TikTok, embodies a hybrid of the newer e-girl iteration of sad girl and its recent predecessors. Collins shot [Billie’s Rolling Stone cover](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/billie-eilish-cover-story-triumph-weird-863603/) with explicit intention to contrast her against the canonical [Britney Spears’ cute, happy, sexy teen-on-the-phone 1999 cover](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/BritneySpears2.jpg?w=838). Eilish is shot in a non-descript bedroom, illuminated by light passing through venetian blinds. In the background a white stuffed bear floats in a fish tank. These moody, emo signifiers and oblique angles present a portrait of a feminine subject with an impenetrable, “you wouldn’t get it if you tried” interior monologue, which starkly contrasts Britney’s what you see is what you get cover.\n\nYoung women recognize themselves in Eilish, and teen girl sadness is a thread of the zeitgeist that is primed for performed empathy. The projection and centering of one’s own sadness increases authenticity and relatability and becomes a calling card for other young women to participate in the creation of an ad hoc community unified by a collective mood. Eilish and social celebrities such as fellow sad-girl [Emma](https://www.instagram.com/emmachamberlain/) [Chamberlain](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg) have gained massive fandoms doing just this, and we see this collective mood take hold both in the comments of any social media post and as young women cry in the audience of Billie’s concerts. Billie’s music does not create a mood of sadness in the audience, it does not re-produce the affect in the viewer. That would be the emotional mimesis at the heart of kitsch. Rather, her expression of depression and sadness holds space for other young women feeling the same way to feel a sense of belonging and validation. \n\nWhen asked by an interviewer in the film about her choice to be transparent on “difficult” subjects like depression, Eilish states, “I never decided to. I never was like ‘I’m gonna talk about this, and I’m gonna talk about this,’ I just talked about what I was feeling and talked about why it was bad, or why it was good, or why it was whatever, and then it became this like ‘oh, she’s making a statement.’ Which I actually love, because I didn’t realize I was, and now that I think about it, like, I realize how many people aren’t talking about that kind of stuff and why people are so, like, shocked when you do talk about it. I’m like ‘why is that so shocking, like I’m telling you, like, about how I am as a human, like, why’s that weird? To be honest with you, I didn’t think I would make it to this age.” Eilish’s expression of sadness furthers her authenticity, and in her public reception, the public discussion of depression and self-harm makes her somewhat transgressive compared to other young female popstars operating at a similar stratum of fame.\n\nWhile Sad Girls toe the line between ennui, sadness, moodiness, and clinically recognized mental health issues, Billie takes it further. She is open about her experiences with cutting and self-harm. Songs such as everything i wanted directly address moments of contemplating suicide. Billie is definitely a sad girl, but each sad girl contains multitudes, and hers leans more towards a textured, low rumbling depression—reflected in the texture of her voice and sound—which is then inflected with bursts of wilding, raging tantrums—expressed through her physical motion, style and use of color.\n\n[it's dark enough](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=9)\n\n## Depressive Intensity\n### “I feel the dark things, I feel them very strongly”\n\nInteriority and a sense of immanence are integral to Billie’s vibe, which I define here as depressive intensity. The affect produced by her speaking and singing voice, her low-cast, disaffected gaze, and her open discussion of sadness and self harm compositely create a sense of dark, low-registered depressiveness. This is counterbalanced by a stylistically louder way of moving her body on stage and in the clothing she wears. While performing, she constantly jumps, both reflecting and producing the same motion with the crowd, and does so to the point of injury. It creates a sense of amplified depression, which does not spike, drop or whoop, but rather continues on the same low register, just with increased gain or volume. When listening to tonally low sounds at higher volume, you are able to hear more texture. With depressive intensity the medium itself is revealed— with decreased fidelity, you hear the substrate of sound itself. If you listen closely, you can even perceive the bedroom’s resonant echo.  \n\nDepressive intensity has specific affective valences within it which create the broader texture of this vibe. As her Rolling Stone cover title illustrates, Eilish’s success was claimed as the “Triumph of the Weird.” While Eilish trades in gothic, e-girl iconography—her pet tarantula, black liquid streaming from her eyes–it doesn’t not align with Mark Fisher’s definition of the term – “the weird is that which does not belong” [12]. In these terms the weird points towards wrongness—not that the thing itself is wrong, but rather our conception of the world cannot flex to accommodate it. Eilish, as a depressed young woman leaning into dark aesthetics is by no means wrong, it’s somewhat expected. By these parameters, I do not include weirdness as a component affect of depressive intensity. What I would consider integral elements are the affective categories of sad, chill and baby. Sad in these terms aligns with the previous description of the sad girl typology—a young female who capitalizes on traditionally non-productive attitudes, aesthetically flattening them into markers of taste. The breed of resistance apparent in Eilish’s sadness is not particularly anti-patriarchal, but rather against a culture of toxic positivity and brightsiding. \n\nRobin James has previously written about the chill aspects of Eilish’s work. She points out that “bad guy” may sound chill on the surface, but has other intentions at play. Eilish’s chillness is not simply a semi-jaded affect, but deepens a sense of intimacy with her audience. The laid-back chillness of creating hits in a bedroom with her brother, microphone close to the mouth, producing ASMR-inducing sounds, results in songs that tonally and texturally seem to be designed to be listened to by individuals on airpods. As James states, “Her voice is calibrated to suit the intensifying privatization of listening that has accompanied new media technologies and which has become central to neoliberalism’s imperative to produce capacity-value.” Capacity-value here can be described as one’s ability to fluidly adapt to a given situation, and what’s more chill than going with the flow. There is a darkened underbelly to chill though, chill is an affect arguably accessible only to those of a specifically privileged status. Chill is an aspirational affect, one that has become a status marker amongst wellness-minded, cis white women who equate chillness with a sense of homeostasis. Chill is an ideologically non-neutral affect, it is the ideal for elite cishetero white women in economies of resilience. “Chill” as James explains, is enacted by individuals who have already adapted neoliberal market logics, while appropriating the aesthetics and styles of people who can’t or won’t adapt (or, in James’ terms, do not have the capacity to adapt) [13]. Chillness here appropriates a sense of melancholy as a way to disidentify with the mainstream. Eilish’s sadness, even beyond “Sad Girl” is also communicating a sense of melancholy that operates within her chill register, effectively having her multi-layered moody cake and eating it too.\n\nThe final and most nascent affective aspect to depressive intensity is “baby.” At multiple points throughout *Blurry*, Finneas instructs Billy to sing “babier.” What this means practically is that she softly up-pitches her voice, making it sound younger than her age. Performing a baby voice is unsustainable and when prolonged, can cause long lasting vocal harm—as can be seen with Britney Spears, who was vocally trained to reproduce the baby voice of her most famous hits. It’s not difficult to understand the appeal of “baby.” A baby is a machine for getting attention in order to get its needs met. Implicit in a performed babyness is a performance of vulnerability and weakness, eliciting a sense of care. It is slightly manipulative, but in Billie’s case, she is literally the baby in the family. In meme logic, “i’m baby” refers to the relinquishment of agency as much as it does an admittance of one’s own lack of control and need to be cared for. It is an expression of both helplessness and uselessness, which can, at some angles, be interpreted as a resistance to the capitalist mandate of endless productivity, but, in another light is a giving up of accountability and responsibility. Anyone can be baby if you’re willing to make the world someone else’s problems. \n\n[with so much left to say ](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=13)\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nAs with many pop music documentaries, *Blurry* provides a verité style portrait of a hit sensation who is neither the full architect of nor the accidental subject of her own success. Throughout the film we see her exercise creative agency (she has gone on to direct subsequent music videos), as well as locate her within a deeply intimate family constellation. While her brother primarily drives the writing and production of the music, what does become apparent is that Billie is the architect of her interior world, and the way that synthesizes her synesthetic mind, tastes, and vocal and performative tonalities into a coherent vibe—depressive intensity. More than her ingenue status, her and Finneas’s musical virtuosity, or the wholesome O'Connell family narrative, what has fed into her success the most is the fact that this depressively intense vibe is being experienced en masse. She is symptomatic of a moment where the dominant cultural affect is one of depression, with the mandate to perform said depression at a high enough intensity to function as a productive, accelerated capitalism subject. Within that intensity lies elements of chill, a mood that appropriates melancholy into the realm of productivity, and equating adaptability with homeostasis, and baby — a performed helplessness, relinquishing agency in exchange for care, and abandoning a sense of individual accountability to the whole. Billie, like her fans, is constantly negotiating between self-reflexivity and passivity to the complex cultural forces at play. Cognizance of and harnessing the way that one’s vibe impacts the world is a way to exercise agency. By centering Eilish’s specific vibe, effectively making it the true subject of the film, Cutler allows us to anthropologically analyze its component parts and attempt to put language to something that otherwise resists or exists beyond the linguistic. If mood is the message, then it’s time we all learn to read.\n\n[or bury your friend right now](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=10)\n\n[1] Harris, Anita. *Future Girl: Young Women in the 21st Century*.

{"id": "JqXAGEGjooagK9__TUpexFcZsdqXZG8NbvFJlJiJ048", "title": "The Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity", "body": "_Mapping out the hurdles DeFi will face in its quest for mainstream adoption 🗺_\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/549eeeb5-1813-412b-95c6-e98fed96906a.jpg?height=1500&width=2500&refresh=true)\n\nDecentralised Finance, DeFi, is thought by many to be the future of the financial services industry and is expected to completely change the way people think about money and the systems and institutions they entrust to look after their money. The space has you covered for anything ranging from [peer-to-protocol lending protocols](https://aave.com/) to [insurance policies that protect users from loss of funds due to protocol bugs](https://nexusmutual.io/). Derivative protocols like [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) have you covered for any investments in non ETH-based assets, and you need look no further than [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/) for all your cash-settled options trading needs. \n\nThe space is quickly starting to resemble a fully functional financial system, with all the applications and systems needed for standard retail investor transactions established and regularly audited, but also the most niche structured products thriving and innovating further with every passing day. \n\nHowever, the most striking difference is that DeFi is trying to do what TradFi (Traditional Finance) did over the past 2,000 years in just a couple of years. This pace of innovation is in large part aided by the true and native [composability](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-true-power-of-defi-composability-14fe8355e0d0#:~:text=Composability%2C%20in%20DeFi%2C%20is%20the,and%20therefore%20each%20other's%20utility.) of DeFi which allows projects to seamlessly integrate with each other like Lego and create mind-blowing synergies. DeFi is well on its way to catching up to TradFi in terms of functionality and has its eyes set on surpassing it as soon as the mainstream is ready. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6d974fc1-8031-47f3-9f5b-4bda5509abc9.png?height=700&width=1801)\n\nThe future is bright for DeFi, and the space is always vibrant and full of energy, no matter the state of the overall crypto market. We are still a while away from widespread adoption of DeFi, and as many people often say, *we are still early*. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), the most popular chrome extension based wallet used to interact with DeFi, only recently reached 5 million monthly active users. Mainstream adoption too soon would potentially come at the wrong time for DeFi as the applications may not be properly optimised to support the large and sudden influx of users, but I have had a lot of time to think about this problem lately and have come to some conclusions about what I believe are the main hurdles DeFi needs to surpass before it is truly ready for the *mainnet* to hit the *mainstream*.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76a440fa-1ae5-443a-97fd-356ebd1a0f25.png?height=848&width=2152)\n\nI call these hurdles **the Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity**.\n\n#### Usability\n\nThe first, and arguably most important of these hurdles to ubiquity, is usability. Many of the most successful DeFi protocols are advanced, regularly audited and professionally run but have user interfaces that are unapproachable to all but the most sophisticated investors. In reality, the underlying service these protocols are offering is groundbreaking in the quest for the democratisation of many of the world's most powerful financial instruments which were previously unavailable to most retail investors. Consequently it is important that the people set to benefit the most from this democratisation are also able to understand and use these tools without having to resort to financial advisors.\n\nThe key to this issue is going to be knowing which parts of the UI to hide, and which to display prominently. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is one of the market leaders in keeping its UI simple yet powerful. Still, there will eventually be a divergence of the consumer level interfaces and pro-level interfaces using the same backend, a bit like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) vs [Coinbase **Pro**](https://pro.coinbase.com) to really drive this point home. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) does not focus greatly on UI refinement at the moment, but it will take a [beginner-friendly browser wallet](https://rainbow.me) that has a good fiat on-ramp and perhaps doesn't even refer to itself as a wallet but more as a key to Web3 to really help push DApps into the mainstream. \n\nIncreasingly we will start to see startups cropping up worldwide in various industries focusing on leveraging DeFi technologies to verticalise and fine-tune the experience for different audiences with different financial preferences. The technology behind many of the most popular DeFi protocols is optimised for scale, performance and reliability, so there is a wide-open opportunity for startups to come into specific geographies such as developing economies, where debt financing for small businesses is harder to come by, and build a straightforward front end. This front end could then automatically tap into the sea of open-source protocols and liquidity that is readily available. It could then focus on making it accessible to non-crypto-native audiences with seamless on-ramps for Fiat which, in the future, could allow someone in Venezuela to take out a loan using stablecoins on [AAVE](http://aave.com/) using an [L2 solution like Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) without ever noticing that they have done all of this on a trustless and decentralised back end. \n\nIdeally, customers would eventually be aware of the fact that they are interacting with DeFi, but in order to reach a truly mainstream audience there will be a transitionary period where perhaps these front ends do not lean too heavily into the crypto angle. This movement comes straight out of the playbook of new Fintech startups like [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) and [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) that have spent the past decade taking complex financial systems, reducing their complexity and making them accessible to retail investors. These startups often build on top of TradFi and reduce friction for retail users by bending the rules or by [bundling transactions together](https://www.freetrade.io). DeFi could use the same approach and reduce friction even further by abstracting away the complexities of the Ethereum blockchain and presenting a seamless solution to the end-user. It is unlikely that this simplified DeFi front end innovation will come from the existing Fintech incumbents because the way they are used to working is so different to the way DeFi works. TradFi Fintech startups are used to pushing up against and fighting the traditional systems to try and squeeze them into a user experience that is pleasant to use. The DeFi space is flexible by design so the approach taken by these verticalised DeFi gateways will be simple, and even encouraged by the protocols themselves, contrary to the struggles faced by TradFi Fintech startups where in this case the incumbent banks are constantly trying to play catch-up with the challenger Fintech startups . \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/619cb9ed-b108-46e9-af75-3b211568bb06.png?height=806&width=1825)\n\nWhile there will be many independent startups fulfilling this function and maybe even getting funded through the protocols' own grants DAOs, many of these usability improvements will also come from the protocols' own core teams, especially on the institutional side. Institutional TradFi, at least in the short term, tends to prefer interacting directly with the people that built the technology they are going to be leveraging. [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) has actually started experimenting with [permissioned pools for institutional investors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-lending-platform-aave-reveals-private-pool-for-institutions) because institutional investors previously found it tough to use the protocol due to lack of [KYC and AML](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc-aml-know-your-customer-vs-anti-money-laundering/) compliance, and this has allowed banks and other institutional clients using [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) to know that the other parties in the network are compliant and vetted not to be on an [OFAC sanctions list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). This is just another example of DeFi slightly adapting to TradFi without compromising on their core principles as an almost intermediate stage to mainstream adoption. Whether that be through making it feel like Fiat through stable-coins, or increasing KYC for institutions to help them to feel more at ease about the protocols they are transacting with, these measures all go a long way towards lowering hurdles to mass adoption. \n\nIt is also likely that whilst at this early stage the protocol teams themselves are working on the UI and UX as well as the underlying infrastructure, they may slowly start to shift their focus away from the consumer side and specialise more on the protocol itself. This would likely manifest itself in protocols keeping their existing UIs more as a reference with the aim of slowly phasing them out in the very long-term. Platforms like [Zapper](https://www.zapper.fi) and [Zerion](https://zerion.io/), which are focused almost exclusively on usability and accessibility, will then step in to focus on the front ends and leave the protocol teams free to optimise their platforms.\n\nThe runway is wide open, and the tech is ready. These protocols exist and are being built and tested by thousands of users every day. The best part is that anyone can come in and make them more useful to any specific demographic. Look no further than projects like [Ribbon](https://www.ribbon.finance) to see this in action. [Ribbon](htts://www.ribbon.finance) has made some sophisticated covered call strategies available to anyone with a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) by building directly on [Opyn's](https://www.opyn.co/) cash-settled ETH options protocol, all while making it feel as simple as an, admittedly high-risk, savings account to the end-user.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0ec888-d3db-4856-af1d-48280478715d.png?height=851&width=2325)\n\n#### Undercolateralisation \n\nThe second hurdle is the issue of overcolateralisation in DeFi lending protocols. When you put the whole DeFi stack together, what you are left with is essentially a fully decentralised crypto bank that runs itself in the most traditional sense of the word. DeFi, just like a bank, allows you to convert between currencies, deposit money and receive interest in return for providing liquidity to the bank to then allow them to loan it back out. On the other side of the equation, anyone can then go to the bank, take out a loan and then pay it back at a rate most suited to their risk profile and time horizon. In TradFi some loans are unsecured, but many are secured in that they have some form of collateral backing the loan. If you fail to pay back said loan, the traditional bank has the legal authority to repossess that asset and liquidate it in exchange for cash. The percentage of the total loan required as collateral often depends on a credit score and past successful repayment of loans. Some traditional bank loans are overcollateralised when the asset is highly illiquid to make sure that enough cash can be recouped in the event of a loan default. Conversely in most DeFi lending protocols, you need to provide significantly more crypto as collateral than the stable-coins you are borrowing, sometimes as much as 700%.\n\nIt can be hard to understand why someone would ever want to take out a loan worth less than the amount they are putting down as collateral, and whilst there are some valid reasons for this such as delaying a taxable event or increasing leverage on positions through complex financial gymnastics, the vast majority of the world is **unwilling** or, more importantly, **unable** to borrow money in this way. \n\nThe main reason people borrow money is precisely because they do not have the spare capital available at that time. People take out mortgages to buy houses, or take out loans to start a small business in their hometown. Sometimes a mortgage may even start highly collateralised but later turn undercollateralised if the value of the house goes down, however due to the credit history of the borrower the loan is still able to remain a [_performing loan_](https://pocketsense.com/difference-between-performing-nonperforming-loans-12224160.html). The downside of undercollateralisation is of course that if the loan were to default, the collateral would not be able to cover the principal. In this case, the borrower would step in to cover the difference if they are in fact creditworthy and have some reputational skin in the game not to run off with the money with no consequence. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17b662fe-a9af-4b5c-afda-aeb07b88e131.png?height=845&width=2138)\n\nTo cater properly to these kinds of users it is important that DeFi eventually gets to a point where loans can be undercollateralised in some way. The difficulty is that DeFi is by its very nature anonymous and trustless, which means that the concept of social proof and credit scores becomes very difficult to handle and potentially even ideologically problematic. A potential solution could be a quasi-anonymous loan passport solution in which the user is anonymous on one dimension but not on another, i.e. their wallet address is public, but the owner of the wallet is not. One could, in theory, understand someone's creditworthiness through their DeFi loans history, which is of course publicly visible on Web3 or even decrease the user's collateral requirement for their next loan by a certain percentage every time they repay successfully. Another alternative is allowing user loans to be secured and guaranteed by other individuals they know in real life that trust the borrower enough to guarantee their loan and [delegate their credit](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation).\n\nPerhaps we could even see some CeFi institutions step in to perform credit checks on DeFi users on a per address basis. This solution would, of course, introduce some centralisation as it would involve real-identity based KYC, but may be a necessary interim solution for users that prioritise a low collateral ratio over absolute anonymity as lending protocols could eventually introduce pools of loans where a trusted third party has verified creditworthiness in advance. This CeFi verification could also be a [Zero Knowledge Proof](https://www.wired.com/story/zero-knowledge-proofs/), in that the verifying party would know that the borrower is creditworthy but would essentially allow the borrowers to prove their creditworthiness to another party without having to reveal their identity. When the borrower proves their creditworthiness with zero knowledge, they would display the fact that the CeFi institution has deemed them creditworthy as a boolean value in their wallet, perhaps as a non-transferrable NFT.\n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach to the aforementioned CeFi integration by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) and then offering risk-assessed DeFi loans on their platform without the need for collateral. Although we are still a while away from a foolproof creditworthiness checker solution in DeFi there are many different approaches one can take and I believe a combination of these approaches will play a large part in solving the issue of collateralisation in the quest for widespread adoption.\n\nAside from lending protocols, there is also a significant level of overcollateralisation across the whole DeFi universe which was initially there for the sake of simplicity including in options protocols. There has been some great research done into [improving the collateral efficiency of these protocols](https://medium.com/opyn/partially-collateralized-options-now-in-defi-b9d223eb3f4d) to allow for partial collateralisation without having to worry about creditworthiness through strategic liquidations with a \"shock buffer\" of a size large enough to withstand a Black Thursday event.\n\n#### Understandability\n\nThe final hurdle that, depending on how you look at things could be the hardest or easiest of these to solve, is the difficulty around understandability and education. This hurdle may ultimately solve itself if the first two issues are solved and DeFi starts to resemble the way in which users are used to dealing with and thinking about finances. However, it is still important to acknowledge that for non-technical people, the DeFi space can be very opaque and consequently more difficult to trust.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/46fc773f-114b-42c0-b1db-eade3492e306.png?height=697&width=2015)\n\nFiat money and the way centralised traditional financial systems work is deeply ingrained in our culture and is a little easier to properly comprehend because many parts of the system rely on trust and simple written agreements which come together to form financial systems. Understanding the way these systems work in DeFi is a lot less straightforward. While in TradFi it is relatively straightforward to explain the basics of how a bank works, in that one can deposit money, and in return the bank lends that money out and pays interest for that privilege. There are very few parts of that process that are opaque because, ultimately, it just involves numbers moving from one spreadsheet to another.\n\nThe difference with DeFi is that you first have to feel comfortable with the concept of decentralisation, anonymity, trustless systems, distributed ledgers, and then you have to try and explain how all of this functions automatically through smart-contracts. There are many parts of DeFi that have to be hand-waved away and perhaps this could become a hindrance to trust. \n\nOne could also, of course, argue that many people implicitly trust the banking system because enough other trusted people do and not because they understand every part of the process. The same could eventually be true when enough knowledgeable people trust DeFi and understand a good enough percentage of the current information gaps. \n\nThere are some great resources out there like [Finematics](https://finematics.com/) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) doing amazing things in the education space and teaching newcomers about all things DeFi. This will be crucial in making sure people are comfortable enough with the technology to use it, especially when currently decentralisation slightly goes against the grain and users may be met with scepticism from friends and family. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/56920551-f6e6-47ad-b44d-493b815bc264.png?height=589&width=1262)\n\nIt should, however, be noted that the younger digital-native generation finds the concept of digital money extremely intuitive as they have grown up interacting with various in-game currencies, and the youngest among them have potentially never even used physical cash in their lives. This will undoubtedly make the proliferation of DeFi a more natural process as Gen-Z is starting to trust the digital world more than physical and may even start to learn about finance through DeFi in context rather than adapting antiquated financial concepts to fit the DeFi world as in the current status-quo.\n\n\n\nOverall the space is going in all the right directions. It will take a while for these ideas to materialise fully, but this is the part that interests me the most about the DeFi space. There is so much mind-blowing R&D going on every day, and people are experimenting, taking risks and breaking boundaries. I'm very passionate about making sure as many people as possible have access to these tools and can take part in the revolution. Understanding the pieces of the puzzle left to fill will become increasingly important as the protocols we rely on are built out and refined and start to look towards the next steps.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this piece 💙 \n\nIf you enjoyed the piece and are interested in receiving more of my content or keeping up to date with anything else I get up to a follow on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/coconidodev) would be great... or if you're more of an email person that works too - **subscribe to my infrequent mailing list** via the link below.", "timestamp": 1623951778, "digest": "klQF-dVD9TOVI288YuTObvBVY5_GsrmBGDunRoWpYt8", "contributor": "0xcde3725B25D6d9bC78CF0941cC15Fd9710c764b9"}

It's an experiment in [universal creator income](https://li.substack.com/p/the-case-for-universal-creative-income), [tech stacks for decentralized cities](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4), and the physical [manifestation of DAOs](https://twitter.com/jongold/status/1395390112205352962?s=20).\n\n\n[CabinDAO](crowdfund://0x94515e4f6fabad73C8bCdd8cd42f0b5C037E2c49?network=homestead)\n\n\nThis is a crowdfund for one year of cumulative time living and building at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) in the Texas Hill Country. We're situated on 28 acres of land about 45 minutes from downtown Austin, and we just built a new cabin designed as a collaborative co-living and working space for independent online creators. Our cabins are the first nodes in what we hope will one day be a [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/):\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f7f4c3a9-0d4d-4403-8a28-23432eb32a98.jpg?height=1286&width=1954)\n\n[The land & cabins are our hardware](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4). Now we're starting to experiment with on-chain governance software. We will set up CabinDAO to manage this crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens, which can be used to vote for creator residency proposals. While the DAO will ultimately govern the use of the funds, here's a rough sketch of how we are thinking about structuring the program:\n\n## CabinDAO\n\nWe want to crowdfund 12 months' worth of time at the cabins. This would allow $CABIN holders to vote and fund 12 creators to come for a one-month stay each. The new cabin has four bedrooms, so we would run three cohorts of four creators each.\n\nThe DAO will set up an open application process, perhaps similar to $WRITE RACE. Winners will be invited to Creator Cabins outside of Austin, TX to work on their projects——or ride the waves of synchronicity & decide to collaborate. \n\nAt the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their work at the residency. Our intention is for the CabinDAO community (IRL in Texas, and globally on Discord) to help creators best use emergent web3 patterns to collaborate and share their work.\n\nWhile the first use-case for this DAO is creator residencies, we hope to learn from this experiment and continue to find ways to sustainably fund independent online creators and develop DAO-based governance models for physical spaces. CabinDAO community adds a node to an interdependent network of the new Creator Economy. The edges of CabinDAO are permeable and open to all forms of contribution. We're especially excited about mutually beneficial web3 native collaborations with other DAOs working toward similar visions.\n\nThis project came together over the course of a two-week stay at Creator Cabins by members of [creator.coop](https://creator.coop). We didn't go into our stay intending to make this——the plan emerged from two weeks of co-working, co-living, and co-creating at the cabins. \n\nEveryone came into their time at the cabins with projects they wanted to finish, but late-night conversations around the fire got us all inspired to think about opening the space up to the whole community, regardless of financial means. We hope the residency program can help inspire more collaborative, community-oriented projects like this one.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2c1549c9-0d03-4b4e-914c-d50f07800d22.jpg?height=1284&width=1932)\n\n\n## FAQs\n\n### How do I contribute?\n\nUsing Mirror's widget embedded in this post, you can send ETH to CabinDAO's crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens and invited to our Discord community to begin putting together the plan to fund residencies. Contributions are capped at 2 ETH to maximize participation and ensure balanced governance.\n\n\n### Who is eligible for a residency?\n\nAnyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders. If you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n\n### How do I apply for a residency? \n\nOnce the crowdfund is complete, the DAO will run an open process for selecting applicants. [If you're interested in being notified about that process, opt-in here](https://creatorcabins.ck.page/9e628caec5).\n\n\n### How will the money be spent?\n\nAll money raised by the DAO will be used to fund residencies at Creator Cabins. We are budgeting 1/2 of an ETH per creator-week, so 24 ETH can fund 3 cohorts (12 creators for 4 weeks each the cabins). This provides enough funding for room, board, a stipend, and additional services to support creators during their stay. If we raise less, we will still operate the program but may have to reduce services or the number of cohorts.\n\n\n### How will the DAO sustain itself?\n\nAt the end of each residency, we will help creators mint an NFT representing their work. The NFTs could be held and curated by the CabinDAO treasury or sold back to the community with a split of the proceeds going to the artist and the DAO. \n\nWe hope this structure can help produce value for the community and creator residents while contributing to the long-term sustainability of this model. This is a patronage project designed to provide the gift of time and space to our community. Contributors to the DAO should not expect any financial return.\n\n\n### What happens with the other 50% of $CABIN?\n\nCabinDAO will retain 50% of $CABIN tokens to give to artists upon completion of their residencies, collaborators, other communally beneficial DAOs, future supporters of the residency program, and whoever else CabinDAO decides to grant them to.\n\n\n### Is this co-ownership in the cabins?\n\nNo. CabinDAO is a separate entity, managing the endowment of our creative residency program. This is our first experiment with web3 governance, and we hope to use the lessons from this project to progressively decentralize other aspects of this project in the future.\n\n\n### Why IRL?\n\nThis project never would have happened without the open-ended space to explore and collaborate IRL. It emerged from late-night conversations at the cabin where we are hosting this residency. \n\nAfter a year of pandemic, we had forgotten some of the magical energy of open-ended living and working with other people. You don't need to schedule a Zoom call with an agenda and a hard stop after 30 minutes. As you're drinking your morning coffee, you can end up down a rabbit hole, swapping book recommendations, productivity tools, and podcast episodes. The result: great conversations, deepened friendships, and exciting new ideas.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1df7adbe-3a5c-49e0-95f2-d9af9e8c364e.jpg?height=1298&width=1946)\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/27723c84-ba7e-4cf2-b133-6b843455ecd1.jpg?height=1284&width=1950)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2a3ce5da-5f6d-4ce6-974a-83006b9ddcd4.jpg?height=1308&width=1960)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/39edd82a-9a14-4f91-9442-79e59c11eb5b.jpg?height=1292&width=1940)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8aca6bb-3fd6-457a-987e-c606089a5907.jpg?height=1254&width=1932)\n\n\n[CabinDAO](crowdfund://0x94515e4f6fabad73C8bCdd8cd42f0b5C037E2c49?network=homestead)\n\n\n\n**Acknowledgements** \n\n*Our ideas are building on the prior art, shared learnings & enlightening conversations we’ve had with many others over the past few months.*\n\n*Thanks to @patrickxrivera, @thattallguy, @sirsuhayb, @js_horne, @ljin18, @drewcoffman, and @jarroddicker for talking through the initial idea and helping set up the right structure for this project.*\n\n*Thanks to Seed Club, Songcamp, PartyDAO, herstoryDAO, and the Mint Fund for feedback, inspiration, and advice.*\n\n*Thanks to @p_millerd and @kadlac for being the first people to contribute funds when this was still just an idea.*\n\n*Thanks to @brianwlackey for the beautiful photography in this post.*", "timestamp": 1623952055, "digest": "20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

That said, when the DAO was formed, here are some of the things we intended to accomplish:\n\n> 🌐 Create the conditions for serendipitous in-person collaboration across a diverse internet community 🧑‍🤝‍🧑\n\n> 🏡 Experiment with sustainable models for funding the living expenses of independent online creators 🧑‍🎨 \n\n> 🧭 Explore the idea maze of decentralized governance for physical locations 🗳️ \n\n\n## 🏘️ Residency program\n\nTo accomplish these goals, **we are proposing a 3-month trial of a cohort-based residency, where we bring together groups of 4 independent online creators for 4 weeks to work on projects.**\n\n### 📍 Location\n\nGroups of four residents would spend a month living and working alongside other members of their cohort at [Creators Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/), a 28-acre retreat about 45 minutes outside of Austin, TX. They would stay in a four-bedroom shipping container cabin designed from the ground up for a community of independent online creators:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710) \n\nWhile these first cohorts would be hosted at Creator Cabins, we hope to expand to other locations supported by the DAO in the future. \n\n\n### 🚧 Projects & outcomes\n\nEach of the residents will come with a project they intend to work on. We expect some will stick to the original plan and others will ride the waves of synchronicity & decide to collaborate on something new.\n\nEither way, the expectation of the residency is that you will complete *something* that can be shared with the community by the end of your stay. At the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their work at the residency. This NFT can either be held in the CabinDAO treasury or auctioned, with a 50/50 split going to the creator & to the DAO to fund future residencies. \n\nOur intention is for the CabinDAO community (IRL in Texas, and globally on Discord) to help creators best use emergent web3 patterns to collaborate and share their work. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win a residency, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide. \n\n\n### 🏕️ Camp counselor\n\nResidents will be supported by a \"camp counselor\", who will help facilitate the experience, pick people up at the airport, create ~~~ gOoD vIbEs ~~~, organize weekly grocery runs, brainstorm wild ideas, and generally try to be helpful. The counselor (and any visitors) will stay in the old cabin. \n\nCounselors are people who have completed a residency before and are coming back to support the community. We expect it will take <10 hours per week of work, so anyone working remotely/flexibly can be a counselor part-time. The counselor role will be compensated with free housing and 500 $CABIN tokens per cohort. \n\n\n### 📅 Cohort dates\n\nWe will run three 4-week cohorts over the next few months:\n\n- Cohort 1: *July 19th - August 15th* (hot DAO summer)\n- Cohort 2: *August 23rd - September 19th* (slightly cooler DAO summer)\n- Cohort 3: *September 20th - October 17th* (hitting-our-stride DAO fall)\n\n\n\n## 📋 Application process\n\nThe residency program is open to anyone creating independently and sharing their work online.\n\nFor each cohort, we will run an application & voting process similar to Mirror's $WRITE RACE. People interested in a residency will submit a short proposal, up to 250 words, outlining how they would spend a month of time at Creator Cabins. \n\n$CABIN holders will be able to cast as many votes as the number of tokens they have. Votes can be split among multiple proposals. At the end of the voting period, the top four proposals will receive a one-month residency for the designated cohort.\n\n**We will start accepting applications for Cohort 1 in late June. [Sign up here for updates on the application process.](https://creatorcabins.ck.page/9e628caec5)**\n\n\n\n## 💰 Budget\n\n### 💸 Costs: 5 ETH + 1500 $CABIN per cohort\n\nWe currently have 16 ETH and 16k $CABIN in the treasury. This is enough for us to cover three 4-week cohorts at a budget of 5 ETH + 1500 $CABIN per cohort. This will cover the following expenses:\n\n- *1 ETH per week*: renting out the full Creator Cabins property (including both cabins, high-speed internet, utilities, and cleaning). The market rate for the cabins is more than this, but we know a guy 😉\n- *0.25 ETH + 250 $CABIN*: ETH provided at beginning of the program as a stipend for each creator in the cohort to cover food and gas costs to mint the end-of-program NFT. $CABIN provided to each creator after they mint their post-program NFT.\n- *500 $CABIN*: stipend for the camp counselor for each cohort, provided at the end of the month. \n\n\n### 🪂 Airdrop\n\nWe are also planning to airdrop 500 $CABIN each to @p_millerd and @kadlac for their OG contributions before we even officially set up the crowdfund:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kadlac/status/1394149045757571078\n\n\n## 🔮 Long-term plans\n\nWe are [leaving the crowdfund open](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ) so that we can continue to raise additional funds for future cohorts and allow new members to join the DAO. We also hope to raise additional sustainable funds for the program through splits on sales of NFTs produced by residents. \n\nWhile the first use-case for this DAO is creator residencies, we will learn from this experiment and continue to find ways to sustainably fund independent online creators and develop DAO-based governance models for physical spaces.\n\nWe would love your feedback and contributions to this project!

{"id": "8zdZN9_LUrEraxCzaHMKoE-s9ieHLc3vj853jJMIoTI", "title": "Reputation in Web3: Ships Built on the Great Flood", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/19582697-172f-42a6-9955-769c2d6d8b2b.jpeg?height=900&width=1600)\n\nImplicit in the name ‘Web3’ is the expectation of replacement. In technology, versions are successors. When the new model comes out, we upgrade and the older one is replaced and forgotten.\n\nIs this what we mean when we refer to Web3? Will it replace the set of principles, technologies and behaviors that we’ve come to know as Web 2.0? (Is this even the way that phases of the Internet works?)  \n\nMany blockchain enthusiasts seem to suggest as much. As the term Web 2.0 has become closely associated with centralized social networks like Twitter and Facebook, and as those networks have become increasingly politically powerful -- with arbitrary, capricious or simply incompetent moderation policies not to mention potentially societally harmful business practices -- it is common to hear crypto folks imply that decentralized applications would do a better job. Community-owned networks would be fairer, in that the users who created the content and attracted new members would fully participate, as token holders, in the value they created. The distribution of content could be based on meaningful values like reputation and expertise, rather than gamified outrage and algorithmically rewarded hype. And governance, like moderation policies, would be driven by the entire community, rather than a small club of executives and their handpicked oversight committees made up of insiders looking to maximize their own wealth or security. The attractiveness of this superior model, it is proposed, will lure in key influencers, provide a better user experience, and propel a shift from the old social platforms to the new.\n\nAnd yet, it’s difficult to see how that happens. If anything, it seems like crypto has made the ‘old’ centralized social networks, especially Twitter, more central than ever. How many influencers have used their followers to make an easy leap into crypto sales? How many important projects have used social media to find and recruit contributors? Where else would advocates for new coins and tokens state their cases and share their memes? Where else could we show off our CryptoPunks, Hashmasks and Bored Apes? And how could a Bitcoin day trader not keep his eyes glued on Elon’s Twitter feed over the past few months? Social media is so essential to the day-to-day reality of DeFi that it is hard to see where one ends and the other begins. And it is arguably precisely the gamified virality of centralized platforms that makes them so valuable to crypto marketing and community. \n\nGiven this dynamic, how realistic is some transition? Or have we actually trapped ourselves deeper in a centralized system? And what is actually wrong with Web 2.0 anyway?\n\n### What is actually wrong with Web 2.0?\n\nIn 2004 “Web 2.0” was popularized at a conference which sought to ask the very same question: “What is wrong?” The organizers of the first Web 2.0 conference felt that the industry “had lost its way” after the dotcom bubble burst and needed an injection of confidence. In particular, there was a sense that the vertically integrated portals, like America Online and Yahoo, had created unsustainable monoliths ‘evilly’ trapped users and their data, prevented creative innovation from smaller startups, and led to bubble and bust. Web 2.0 at its outset was about understanding and emulating the ideals and design concepts of the open source movement, but also the success of companies that were still expanding despite the drought, like Google and Amazon. \n\nIn those days, Google especially was seen as a role model, in the way that it sent searching users away to the best resources. Rather than try to seize 100% of the value, the virtuous approach was also the best for the ecosystem. The symbolically central concept was that of the ‘open API.’ Everyone should and would build on everyone else. In fact, one of the most important lessons gleaned from the surviving companies was that user-generated content and data could be a source of sustainable competitive advantage while improving the user experience and the web for all. Users would from here on be first-class contributors, no longer relegated to bottom-of-the-page comments sections, but rather the stars of these new open systems. Developers would vie to attract their usage and contributions by offering ever greater freedoms and flexibility. The best companies would be the best platforms, creating more value for the entire ecosystem.\n\nBut the catch was that this was never a sustainable long-term strategy, at least not for the purposes of promoting an open ecosystem. User-generated data is vulnerable to a family of sub optimizations such as Goodhart’s Law, in which using a “measure” as a “metric” devalues the measure itself. If you’re Google building PageRank on natural weblinks you’ll quickly generate SEO schemes which seek to game your measure. If you’re Amazon relying on user-generated reviews, you’ll soon be flooded with fakes. And if you’re Facebook building algorithms for user recommendation, you’ll soon be suggested content in your existing ideologies and filter bubbles. \n\nThese measure-based competitive advantages erode as companies instill them as metrics to be gained and optimized against. The result is that these companies, naturally seeking to maintain advantage, are forced to develop strong capabilities in user management and manipulation themselves. More charitably, it turns out that the data was more a means to reduce friction, improve experience and aggregate demand centrally, recreating most of the negatives of the old portal system, just with a friendly moniker that everything is just one click away. These successful companies in most cases weren’t true platforms, but aggregators, locking in demand and exerting central control, though admittedly with a velvet fist enforced at least at first and in part by superior user experience.\n\nAnd this necessary lock-in is arguably the source of today’s ire. Whereas 2004's Web 2.0 was reckoning with *marketplace failure*, 2021's Web3 is reckoning with *user failure*. We are a community of people failing the marshmallow test, always optimizing for less friction, more dopamine and shorter feedback cycles. We claim to want richer experiences, to support independent actors, to despise centralization and to demand more meaningful connections and higher quality content. But then we unlock our phones. And so Google, Facebook and Twitter’s success with data-based ad monetization and engagement optimized user experience is now the problem, not the solution. \n\nAs Web 2.0 companies began to deeply understand the powerful potential of their innovations — the game-ish reaction buttons, the follower graph, the algorithmic ‘newsfeed’ — they became adept at a clever stratagem. Rather than committing to perpetual openness, they could offer new user tools or developer APIs and encourage the community to use them to create. If the results were beneficial to the company, they might allow this creativity to flourish for a while, but soon enough, they would either charge the most successful creations for prominence or buy or build their own. \n\nIt was hard to blame them for this approach. It worked! Twitter, Facebook and Google were for-profit companies and the dynamic was not new for ‘platforms.’ Microsoft, the boogeyman of the open source community, had employed similar tactics in its heyday. But it was the development and explosive growth of the smartphone that made it so ferocious. \nMobile devices, with their app stores, emojis, cameras, notifications and most importantly, constant tactile presence, were the perfect match for ‘Web 2.0’ social networks. Every new phone buyer was a potential heavy social user, and the dense relationship networks that quickly formed made it almost impossible for people to resist buying phones to access them. \n\nThis loop triggered a flood of new and highly engaged users unlike anything seen in the history of technology adoption. All over the world, people who recently had only limited access to computers were now checking their newsfeeds throughout the day. Every new family or friend each of them followed increased the value of the experience, the depth of their connection and the virality of the network. Mobile and social became a second brain, “notifications” a sixth sense. So, even if content creators and app developers knew the ‘game’ was ‘rigged,’ how could they not take advantage of this massive opportunity? Maybe, they reasoned, if their brand or invention was the first, if it was the best, it might be one of the few that got so big so fast they’d achieve some kind of escape velocity from the gravity well of the social networks. After all, it had happened. Social apps or content with just the right combination of uniqueness, design genius and luck had hit the jackpot and acquired millions of customers within hours. And so they poured their ideas, talent and cash into these platforms, adding even more appealing media and interactivity, fostering even deeper engagement without any additional cost to the network. And despite the grumbles about unfair practices or addictive behaviors, all this just made the networks more essential. The flood of users kept pouring in. \n\nWe now live in a world of this flood. It’s a world overflowing with social activity, a world where every institution is dragged around by the currents of a new wildly unpredictable environment. Our children dream of growing up to be Instagram ‘influencers.’ Our pop charts are a direct output of the most popular backing tracks on Tiktok. A Facebook-inspired political cult attacked the US Capitol. Even the social platforms are buffeted by the storms unleashed by their technology. Their efforts to assert control have little effect, other than making their position even more essential and central. So, it is in the context of this flooded world, that the notion of Web3 as a successor paradigm has such alluring appeal. \n\n- **Platform wealth and economic sharing**: Today, creators & consumers contribute to a platform to gain social or economic status. But this status is rented (status on platform only, revenue shared directly with platform). In Web3 this status is owned. Not only is social reputation portable, but the relationship with IP created on platform can be owned and portable as well. \n\n- **Content ownership and rights**: Web3 introduces ownership as a process. As IP is put out on the web, IP is minted on chain in order to show provenance and give creator control to its distribution and usage rights. This is done on the individual level vs. the platform level. \n\n- **The happy accident of NFTs**: it seems increasingly evident that certain objects on an open, interoperable world computer will be treated and valued like, well… real objects. This is not yet fully understood, but insofar as NFTs are unique to blockchain-style architectures this would represent quite an advantage.\n\n- **Lies, hype and bots**: Actors can still choose to create as many personalities, handles, keys, etc. as they’d like. However, the incentive for building reputation is to accumulate as much good faith on a single identity as possible. This will enable better positioning and recruiting into more lucrative and socially beneficial opportunities than those handles that lack reputation. \n\n- **Governance, individual influence and moderation**: As we discussed in previous articles, ownership is less about financial upside and more about social influence. In Web3, the individual is now influential within the organization it holds tokens of, giving s/he the ability to drive decision making that will bring better health and effectiveness to the community. \n\n- **Permissionless development and composability**: Today’s platforms control what can and cannot be published on their network. It also starts every user from the same starting line. In Web3, development is unrestricted because the permission is tied directly to that individual's reputation. Every decision they make is tied to their identity, so it’s a choice as to whether or not you want to carry these decisions with you throughout the web. Everything built on the protocol is foundational to what others can build on top of it. So instead of everyone acting independently and starting from scratch, everyone works in collaboration and builds on top of foundational legos from other members before them. \n\n- **New models of work and collaboration**: The business models of Web3 encourage collaboration. In Web2, all revenue streams reward the action of the output (advertising against what’s already published, subscribing to a finished piece of work). In Web3, there’s now a business model on the input. Crowdfunding and social tokens are an investment in the idea before there is any output generated, encouraging strong collaboration at the onset which rewards all participants throughout the creative process\n\nThis is a rich set of imagined capabilities that directly answers the most pernicious problems of Web 2.0 as it has crystallized nearly twenty years after its inception: ownership, governance, openness, incentives, reputation. In many ways, the solutions Web3 proposes are the direct opposite of those offered by social networks, a far ‘better deal’ for users, creators and developers, an approach intentionally weighted to reward the individual or team on the basis of her, his or their input, rather than be drowned amid ever increasing control and returns to the owners and operators of networks. Which leads us to the question: If it’s better for more people, will Web3 replace Web 2.0? Why wouldn’t it? \n\nThere are three possible answers:\n\n1) No -- Web3 is best understood as a sort of ‘economic’ extension of Web 2.0, especially of social media, and it will grow as Web 2.0 grows.\n\n2) Sort of -- key aspects of Web 2.0 will be better performed by Web 3 systems and there will be a symbiotic relationship between two parallel but similarly powerful models.\n\n3) Yes -- over time, all of the key aspects of Web 2.0, including centralized social networks, will be replaced by web 3-style user-owned and governed protocols.\n\nWe can think of these being three horizons: Web3 as testing ground (1), as complement (2), or as critique (3). As for the first, it may be that Web3 is a sort of open lab of experimentation whose successes will eventually be absorbed by existing structures. This testing ground outcome emerges if the natural inefficiencies of, say, Web3 database structures don’t have any compensating advantages over the long term. The second outcome of complementarity occurs as aspects of Web3 thrive alongside, and even enhance the value of, Web 2.0. This seems to be the case with Twitter, which may be the greatest consumer onramp to Web3 and clearly plays a major role in the ecosystem. The third outcome, the most extreme, is probably best thought of as Web3 being an inherent critique of Web 2.0. Replacement will seem necessary insofar as Twitter, or Facebook, or Paypal’s success is thought to be Web3’s failure. \n\nPerhaps one difference between today’s context and 2004’s -- when we roughly transitioned to the social/mobile Web 2.0 -- is that the large tech companies that have mastered their strategies are broadly and firmly entrenched, and it isn’t as clear how a newcomer can emulate or even improve on their strategies while maintaining defensibility. To look at Twitter for example, for crypto, its ‘purpose’ is a portal to scarcity games, NFT drops, and FOMO. The function today is to spread narratives and create FOMO for markets in Web3. But what happens as the number of markets in Web3 exponentially increases? Web3 says it provides an escape, but it’s not certain whether the escape is scarcity financial games that shift attention or a new fairground with even playing rules. We were trained to play the game rather than play the game in a fair manner. \n\nRight now, and for the foreseeable future, follower graphs on centralized social networks are a source of significant and enduring value. We see in every dimension of our society how efficiently that influence can be translated into financial, political and cultural gain. So to ask our question another way: Will there be a time when most users’ on-chain identities and reputations are more valuable to them than their centralized social network follower count and composition? The three answer options above represent different degrees of optimism.\n\nIt is easy, given the trajectory of this most recent era of tech, to be pessimistic. Many of the idealistic outcomes people argued were ‘inevitable’ in 2004 now look laughably pollyannaish. But our current situation, strangely simultaneously both centralized and chaotic, is neither all bad nor intractable. The mobile and social transition that flooded — and still floods — billions of people into Web 2.0 is providing a historic opening for human creativity and connection. For all of the algorithmic manipulation and clever incentives of social networks, these are billions of human beings with free will. They aren’t pre-programmed robots. It is factful not fanciful to recognize that they will determine the future. But they won’t do it based on vague ideals of decentralization. Only if and to the extent that Web3 truly benefits their lives will they push past our legacy networks into a next phase. \n\n", "timestamp": 1623952839, "digest": "aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

In technology, versions are successors. When the new model comes out, we upgrade and the older one is replaced and forgotten.\n\nIs this what we mean when we refer to Web3? Will it replace the set of principles, technologies and behaviors that we’ve come to know as Web2? (Is this even the way that phases of the Internet works?)  \n\nMany blockchain enthusiasts seem to suggest as much. As the term Web2 has become closely associated with centralized social networks like Twitter and Facebook, and as those networks have become increasingly politically powerful -- with arbitrary, capricious or simply incompetent moderation policies not to mention potentially societally harmful business practices -- it is common to hear crypto folks imply that decentralized applications would do a better job. Community-owned networks would be fairer, in that the users who created the content and attracted new members would fully participate, as token holders, in the value they created. The distribution of content could be based on meaningful values like reputation and expertise, rather than gamified outrage and algorithmically rewarded hype. And governance, like moderation policies, would be driven by the entire community, rather than a small club of executives and their handpicked oversight committees made up of insiders looking to maximize their own wealth or security. The attractiveness of this superior model, it is proposed, will lure in key influencers, provide a better user experience, and propel a shift from the old social platforms to the new.\n\nAnd yet, it’s difficult to see how that happens. If anything, it seems like crypto has made the ‘old’ centralized social networks, especially Twitter, more central than ever. How many influencers have used their followers to make an easy leap into crypto sales? How many important projects have used social media to find and recruit contributors? Where else would advocates for new coins and tokens state their cases and share their memes? Where else could we show off our CryptoPunks, Hashmasks and Bored Apes? And how could a Bitcoin day trader not keep his eyes glued on Elon’s Twitter feed over the past few months? Social media is so essential to the day-to-day reality of DeFi that it is hard to see where one ends and the other begins. And it is arguably precisely the gamified virality of centralized platforms that makes them so valuable to crypto marketing and community. \n\nGiven this dynamic, how realistic is some transition? Or have we actually trapped ourselves deeper in a centralized system? And what is actually wrong with Web2 anyway?\n\n### What is actually wrong with Web2?\n\nIn 2004 “Web2” was popularized at a conference which sought to ask the very same question: “What is wrong?” The organizers of the first Web2 conference felt that the industry “had lost its way” after the dotcom bubble burst and needed an injection of confidence. In particular, there was a sense that the vertically integrated portals, like America Online and Yahoo, had created unsustainable monoliths ‘evilly’ trapped users and their data, prevented creative innovation from smaller startups, and led to bubble and bust. Web2 at its outset was about understanding and emulating the ideals and design concepts of the open source movement, but also the success of companies that were still expanding despite the drought, like Google and Amazon. \n\nIn those days, Google especially was seen as a role model, in the way that it sent searching users away to the best resources. Rather than try to seize 100% of the value, the virtuous approach was also the best for the ecosystem. The symbolically central concept was that of the ‘open API.’ Everyone should and would build on everyone else. In fact, one of the most important lessons gleaned from the surviving companies was that user-generated content and data could be a source of sustainable competitive advantage while improving the user experience and the web for all. Users would from here on be first-class contributors, no longer relegated to bottom-of-the-page comments sections, but rather the stars of these new open systems. Developers would vie to attract their usage and contributions by offering ever greater freedoms and flexibility. The best companies would be the best platforms, creating more value for the entire ecosystem.\n\nBut the catch was that this was never a sustainable long-term strategy, at least not for the purposes of promoting an open ecosystem. User-generated data is vulnerable to a family of sub optimizations such as Goodhart’s Law, in which using a “measure” as a “metric” devalues the measure itself. If you’re Google building PageRank on natural weblinks you’ll quickly generate SEO schemes which seek to game your measure. If you’re Amazon relying on user-generated reviews, you’ll soon be flooded with fakes. And if you’re Facebook building algorithms for user recommendation, you’ll soon be suggested content in your existing ideologies and filter bubbles. \n\nThese measure-based competitive advantages erode as companies instill them as metrics to be gained and optimized against. The result is that these companies, naturally seeking to maintain advantage, are forced to develop strong capabilities in user management and manipulation themselves. More charitably, it turns out that the data was more a means to reduce friction, improve experience and aggregate demand centrally, recreating most of the negatives of the old portal system, just with a friendly moniker that everything is just one click away. These successful companies in most cases weren’t true platforms, but aggregators, locking in demand and exerting central control, though admittedly with a velvet fist enforced at least at first and in part by superior user experience.\n\nAnd this necessary lock-in is arguably the source of today’s ire. Whereas 2004's Web2 was reckoning with *marketplace failure*, 2021's Web3 is reckoning with *user failure*. We are a community of people failing the marshmallow test, always optimizing for less friction, more dopamine and shorter feedback cycles. We claim to want richer experiences, to support independent actors, to despise centralization and to demand more meaningful connections and higher quality content. But then we unlock our phones. And so Google, Facebook and Twitter’s success with data-based ad monetization and engagement optimized user experience is now the problem, not the solution. \n\nAs Web2 companies began to deeply understand the powerful potential of their innovations — the game-ish reaction buttons, the follower graph, the algorithmic ‘newsfeed’ — they became adept at a clever stratagem. Rather than committing to perpetual openness, they could offer new user tools or developer APIs and encourage the community to use them to create. If the results were beneficial to the company, they might allow this creativity to flourish for a while, but soon enough, they would either charge the most successful creations for prominence or buy or build their own. \n\nIt was hard to blame them for this approach. It worked! Twitter, Facebook and Google were for-profit companies and the dynamic was not new for ‘platforms.’ Microsoft, the boogeyman of the open source community, had employed similar tactics in its heyday. But it was the development and explosive growth of the smartphone that made it so ferocious. \nMobile devices, with their app stores, emojis, cameras, notifications and most importantly, constant tactile presence, were the perfect match for ‘Web2’ social networks. Every new phone buyer was a potential heavy social user, and the dense relationship networks that quickly formed made it almost impossible for people to resist buying phones to access them. \n\nThis loop triggered a flood of new and highly engaged users unlike anything seen in the history of technology adoption. All over the world, people who recently had only limited access to computers were now checking their newsfeeds throughout the day. Every new family or friend each of them followed increased the value of the experience, the depth of their connection and the virality of the network. Mobile and social became a second brain, “notifications” a sixth sense. So, even if content creators and app developers knew the ‘game’ was ‘rigged,’ how could they not take advantage of this massive opportunity? Maybe, they reasoned, if their brand or invention was the first, if it was the best, it might be one of the few that got so big so fast they’d achieve some kind of escape velocity from the gravity well of the social networks. After all, it had happened. Social apps or content with just the right combination of uniqueness, design genius and luck had hit the jackpot and acquired millions of customers within hours. And so they poured their ideas, talent and cash into these platforms, adding even more appealing media and interactivity, fostering even deeper engagement without any additional cost to the network. And despite the grumbles about unfair practices or addictive behaviors, all this just made the networks more essential. The flood of users kept pouring in. \n\nWe now live in a world of this flood. It’s a world overflowing with social activity, a world where every institution is dragged around by the currents of a new wildly unpredictable environment. Our children dream of growing up to be Instagram ‘influencers.’ Our pop charts are a direct output of the most popular backing tracks on Tiktok. A Facebook-inspired political cult attacked the US Capitol. Even the social platforms are buffeted by the storms unleashed by their technology. Their efforts to assert control have little effect, other than making their position even more essential and central. So, it is in the context of this flooded world, that the notion of Web3 as a successor paradigm has such alluring appeal. \n\n- **Platform wealth and economic sharing**: Today, creators & consumers contribute to a platform to gain social or economic status. But this status is rented (status on platform only, revenue shared directly with platform). In Web3 this status is owned. Not only is social reputation portable, but the relationship with IP created on platform can be owned and portable as well. \n\n- **Content ownership and rights**: Web3 introduces ownership as a process. As IP is put out on the web, IP is minted on chain in order to show provenance and give creator control to its distribution and usage rights. This is done on the individual level vs. the platform level. \n\n- **The happy accident of NFTs**: it seems increasingly evident that certain objects on an open, interoperable world computer will be treated and valued like, well… real objects. This is not yet fully understood, but insofar as NFTs are unique to blockchain-style architectures this would represent quite an advantage.\n\n- **Lies, hype and bots**: Actors can still choose to create as many personalities, handles, keys, etc. as they’d like. However, the incentive for building reputation is to accumulate as much good faith on a single identity as possible. This will enable better positioning and recruiting into more lucrative and socially beneficial opportunities than those handles that lack reputation. \n\n- **Governance, individual influence and moderation**: As we discussed in previous articles, ownership is less about financial upside and more about social influence. In Web3, the individual is now influential within the organization it holds tokens of, giving s/he the ability to drive decision making that will bring better health and effectiveness to the community. \n\n- **Permissionless development and composability**: Today’s platforms control what can and cannot be published on their network. It also starts every user from the same starting line. In Web3, development is unrestricted because the permission is tied directly to that individual's reputation. Every decision they make is tied to their identity, so it’s a choice as to whether or not you want to carry these decisions with you throughout the web. Everything built on the protocol is foundational to what others can build on top of it. So instead of everyone acting independently and starting from scratch, everyone works in collaboration and builds on top of foundational legos from other members before them. \n\n- **New models of work and collaboration**: The business models of Web3 encourage collaboration. In Web2, all revenue streams reward the action of the output (advertising against what’s already published, subscribing to a finished piece of work). In Web3, there’s now a business model on the input. Crowdfunding and social tokens are an investment in the idea before there is any output generated, encouraging strong collaboration at the onset which rewards all participants throughout the creative process\n\nThis is a rich set of imagined capabilities that directly answers the most pernicious problems of Web2 as it has crystallized nearly twenty years after its inception: ownership, governance, openness, incentives, reputation. In many ways, the solutions Web3 proposes are the direct opposite of those offered by social networks, a far ‘better deal’ for users, creators and developers, an approach intentionally weighted to reward the individual or team on the basis of her, his or their input, rather than be drowned amid ever increasing control and returns to the owners and operators of networks. Which leads us to the question: If it’s better for more people, will Web3 replace Web2? Why wouldn’t it? \n\nThere are three possible answers:\n\n1) No -- Web3 is best understood as a sort of ‘economic’ extension of Web2, especially of social media, and it will grow as Web2 grows.\n\n2) Sort of -- key aspects of Web2 will be better performed by Web3 systems and there will be a symbiotic relationship between two parallel but similarly powerful models.\n\n3) Yes -- over time, all of the key aspects of Web2, including centralized social networks, will be replaced by web3-style user-owned and governed protocols.\n\nWe can think of these being three horizons: Web3 as testing ground (1), as complement (2), or as critique (3). As for the first, it may be that Web3 is a sort of open lab of experimentation whose successes will eventually be absorbed by existing structures. This testing ground outcome emerges if the natural inefficiencies of, say, Web3 database structures don’t have any compensating advantages over the long term. The second outcome of complementarity occurs as aspects of Web3 thrive alongside, and even enhance the value of, Web2. This seems to be the case with Twitter, which may be the greatest consumer onramp to Web3 and clearly plays a major role in the ecosystem. The third outcome, the most extreme, is probably best thought of as Web3 being an inherent critique of Web2. Replacement will seem necessary insofar as Twitter, or Facebook, or Paypal’s success is thought to be Web3’s failure. \n\nPerhaps one difference between today’s context and 2004’s -- when we roughly transitioned to the social/mobile Web2 -- is that the large tech companies that have mastered their strategies are broadly and firmly entrenched, and it isn’t as clear how a newcomer can emulate or even improve on their strategies while maintaining defensibility.

Will it replace the set of principles, technologies and behaviors that we’ve come to know as Web2? (Is this even the way that phases of the Internet works?)  \n\nMany blockchain enthusiasts seem to suggest as much. As the term Web2 has become closely associated with centralized social networks like Twitter and Facebook, and as those networks have become increasingly politically powerful -- with arbitrary, capricious or simply incompetent moderation policies not to mention potentially societally harmful business practices -- it is common to hear crypto folks imply that decentralized applications would do a better job. Community-owned networks would be fairer, in that the users who created the content and attracted new members would fully participate, as token holders, in the value they created. The distribution of content could be based on meaningful values like reputation and expertise, rather than gamified outrage and algorithmically rewarded hype. And governance, like moderation policies, would be driven by the entire community, rather than a small club of executives and their handpicked oversight committees made up of insiders looking to maximize their own wealth or security. The attractiveness of this superior model, it is proposed, will lure in key influencers, provide a better user experience, and propel a shift from the old social platforms to the new.\n\nAnd yet, it’s difficult to see how that happens. If anything, it seems like crypto has made the ‘old’ centralized social networks, especially Twitter, more central than ever. How many influencers have used their followers to make an easy leap into crypto sales? How many important projects have used social media to find and recruit contributors? Where else would advocates for new coins and tokens state their cases and share their memes? Where else could we show off our CryptoPunks, Hashmasks and Bored Apes? And how could a Bitcoin day trader not keep his eyes glued on Elon’s Twitter feed over the past few months? Social media is so essential to the day-to-day reality of DeFi that it is hard to see where one ends and the other begins. And it is arguably precisely the gamified virality of centralized platforms that makes them so valuable to crypto marketing and community. \n\nGiven this dynamic, how realistic is some transition? Or have we actually trapped ourselves deeper in a centralized system? And what is actually wrong with Web2 anyway?\n\n### What is actually wrong with Web2?\n\nIn 2004 “Web2” was popularized at a conference which sought to ask the very same question: “What is wrong?” The organizers of the first Web2 conference felt that the industry “had lost its way” after the dotcom bubble burst and needed an injection of confidence. In particular, there was a sense that the vertically integrated portals, like America Online and Yahoo, had created unsustainable monoliths ‘evilly’ trapped users and their data, prevented creative innovation from smaller startups, and led to bubble and bust. Web2 at its outset was about understanding and emulating the ideals and design concepts of the open source movement, but also the success of companies that were still expanding despite the drought, like Google and Amazon. \n\nIn those days, Google especially was seen as a role model, in the way that it sent searching users away to the best resources. Rather than try to seize 100% of the value, the virtuous approach was also the best for the ecosystem. The symbolically central concept was that of the ‘open API.’ Everyone should and would build on everyone else. In fact, one of the most important lessons gleaned from the surviving companies was that user-generated content and data could be a source of sustainable competitive advantage while improving the user experience and the web for all. Users would from here on be first-class contributors, no longer relegated to bottom-of-the-page comments sections, but rather the stars of these new open systems. Developers would vie to attract their usage and contributions by offering ever greater freedoms and flexibility. The best companies would be the best platforms, creating more value for the entire ecosystem.\n\nBut the catch was that this was never a sustainable long-term strategy, at least not for the purposes of promoting an open ecosystem. User-generated data is vulnerable to a family of sub optimizations such as Goodhart’s Law, in which using a “measure” as a “metric” devalues the measure itself. If you’re Google building PageRank on natural weblinks you’ll quickly generate SEO schemes which seek to game your measure. If you’re Amazon relying on user-generated reviews, you’ll soon be flooded with fakes. And if you’re Facebook building algorithms for user recommendation, you’ll soon be suggested content in your existing ideologies and filter bubbles. \n\nThese measure-based competitive advantages erode as companies instill them as metrics to be gained and optimized against. The result is that these companies, naturally seeking to maintain advantage, are forced to develop strong capabilities in user management and manipulation themselves. More charitably, it turns out that the data was more a means to reduce friction, improve experience and aggregate demand centrally, recreating most of the negatives of the old portal system, just with a friendly moniker that everything is just one click away. These successful companies in most cases weren’t true platforms, but aggregators, locking in demand and exerting central control, though admittedly with a velvet fist enforced at least at first and in part by superior user experience.\n\nAnd this necessary lock-in is arguably the source of today’s ire. Whereas 2004's Web2 was reckoning with *marketplace failure*, 2021's Web3 is reckoning with *user failure*. We are a community of people failing the marshmallow test, always optimizing for less friction, more dopamine and shorter feedback cycles. We claim to want richer experiences, to support independent actors, to despise centralization and to demand more meaningful connections and higher quality content. But then we unlock our phones. And so Google, Facebook and Twitter’s success with data-based ad monetization and engagement optimized user experience is now the problem, not the solution. \n\nAs Web2 companies began to deeply understand the powerful potential of their innovations — the game-ish reaction buttons, the follower graph, the algorithmic ‘newsfeed’ — they became adept at a clever stratagem. Rather than committing to perpetual openness, they could offer new user tools or developer APIs and encourage the community to use them to create. If the results were beneficial to the company, they might allow this creativity to flourish for a while, but soon enough, they would either charge the most successful creations for prominence or buy or build their own. \n\nIt was hard to blame them for this approach. It worked! Twitter, Facebook and Google were for-profit companies and the dynamic was not new for ‘platforms.’ Microsoft, the boogeyman of the open source community, had employed similar tactics in its heyday. But it was the development and explosive growth of the smartphone that made it so ferocious. \nMobile devices, with their app stores, emojis, cameras, notifications and most importantly, constant tactile presence, were the perfect match for ‘Web2’ social networks. Every new phone buyer was a potential heavy social user, and the dense relationship networks that quickly formed made it almost impossible for people to resist buying phones to access them. \n\nThis loop triggered a flood of new and highly engaged users unlike anything seen in the history of technology adoption. All over the world, people who recently had only limited access to computers were now checking their newsfeeds throughout the day. Every new family or friend each of them followed increased the value of the experience, the depth of their connection and the virality of the network. Mobile and social became a second brain, “notifications” a sixth sense. So, even if content creators and app developers knew the ‘game’ was ‘rigged,’ how could they not take advantage of this massive opportunity? Maybe, they reasoned, if their brand or invention was the first, if it was the best, it might be one of the few that got so big so fast they’d achieve some kind of escape velocity from the gravity well of the social networks. After all, it had happened. Social apps or content with just the right combination of uniqueness, design genius and luck had hit the jackpot and acquired millions of customers within hours. And so they poured their ideas, talent and cash into these platforms, adding even more appealing media and interactivity, fostering even deeper engagement without any additional cost to the network. And despite the grumbles about unfair practices or addictive behaviors, all this just made the networks more essential. The flood of users kept pouring in. \n\nWe now live in a world of this flood. It’s a world overflowing with social activity, a world where every institution is dragged around by the currents of a new wildly unpredictable environment. Our children dream of growing up to be Instagram ‘influencers.’ Our pop charts are a direct output of the most popular backing tracks on Tiktok. A Facebook-inspired political cult attacked the US Capitol. Even the social platforms are buffeted by the storms unleashed by their technology. Their efforts to assert control have little effect, other than making their position even more essential and central. So, it is in the context of this flooded world, that the notion of Web3 as a successor paradigm has such alluring appeal. \n\n- **Platform wealth and economic sharing**: Today, creators & consumers contribute to a platform to gain social or economic status. But this status is rented (status on platform only, revenue shared directly with platform). In Web3 this status is owned. Not only is social reputation portable, but the relationship with IP created on platform can be owned and portable as well. \n\n- **Content ownership and rights**: Web3 introduces ownership as a process. As IP is put out on the web, IP is minted on chain in order to show provenance and give creator control to its distribution and usage rights. This is done on the individual level vs. the platform level. \n\n- **The happy accident of NFTs**: it seems increasingly evident that certain objects on an open, interoperable world computer will be treated and valued like, well… real objects. This is not yet fully understood, but insofar as NFTs are unique to blockchain-style architectures this would represent quite an advantage.\n\n- **Lies, hype and bots**: Actors can still choose to create as many personalities, handles, keys, etc. as they’d like. However, the incentive for building reputation is to accumulate as much good faith on a single identity as possible. This will enable better positioning and recruiting into more lucrative and socially beneficial opportunities than those handles that lack reputation. \n\n- **Governance, individual influence and moderation**: As we discussed in previous articles, ownership is less about financial upside and more about social influence. In Web3, the individual is now influential within the organization it holds tokens of, giving s/he the ability to drive decision making that will bring better health and effectiveness to the community. \n\n- **Permissionless development and composability**: Today’s platforms control what can and cannot be published on their network. It also starts every user from the same starting line. In Web3, development is unrestricted because the permission is tied directly to that individual's reputation. Every decision they make is tied to their identity, so it’s a choice as to whether or not you want to carry these decisions with you throughout the web. Everything built on the protocol is foundational to what others can build on top of it. So instead of everyone acting independently and starting from scratch, everyone works in collaboration and builds on top of foundational legos from other members before them. \n\n- **New models of work and collaboration**: The business models of Web3 encourage collaboration. In Web2, all revenue streams reward the action of the output (advertising against what’s already published, subscribing to a finished piece of work). In Web3, there’s now a business model on the input. Crowdfunding and social tokens are an investment in the idea before there is any output generated, encouraging strong collaboration at the onset which rewards all participants throughout the creative process\n\nThis is a rich set of imagined capabilities that directly answers the most pernicious problems of Web2 as it has crystallized nearly twenty years after its inception: ownership, governance, openness, incentives, reputation. In many ways, the solutions Web3 proposes are the direct opposite of those offered by social networks, a far ‘better deal’ for users, creators and developers, an approach intentionally weighted to reward the individual or team on the basis of her, his or their input, rather than be drowned amid ever increasing control and returns to the owners and operators of networks. Which leads us to the question: If it’s better for more people, will Web3 replace Web2? Why wouldn’t it? \n\nThere are three possible answers:\n\n1) No -- Web3 is best understood as a sort of ‘economic’ extension of Web2, especially of social media, and it will grow as Web2 grows.\n\n2) Sort of -- key aspects of Web2 will be better performed by Web3 systems and there will be a symbiotic relationship between two parallel but similarly powerful models.\n\n3) Yes -- over time, all of the key aspects of Web2, including centralized social networks, will be replaced by web3-style user-owned and governed protocols.\n\nWe can think of these being three horizons: Web3 as testing ground (1), as complement (2), or as critique (3). As for the first, it may be that Web3 is a sort of open lab of experimentation whose successes will eventually be absorbed by existing structures. This testing ground outcome emerges if the natural inefficiencies of, say, Web3 database structures don’t have any compensating advantages over the long term. The second outcome of complementarity occurs as aspects of Web3 thrive alongside, and even enhance the value of, Web2. This seems to be the case with Twitter, which may be the greatest consumer onramp to Web3 and clearly plays a major role in the ecosystem. The third outcome, the most extreme, is probably best thought of as Web3 being an inherent critique of Web2. Replacement will seem necessary insofar as Twitter, or Facebook, or Paypal’s success is thought to be Web3’s failure. \n\nPerhaps one difference between today’s context and 2004’s -- when we roughly transitioned to the social/mobile Web2 -- is that the large tech companies that have mastered their strategies are broadly and firmly entrenched, and it isn’t as clear how a newcomer can emulate or even improve on their strategies while maintaining defensibility. To look at Twitter for example, for crypto, its ‘purpose’ is a portal to scarcity games, NFT drops, and FOMO. The function today is to spread narratives and create FOMO for markets in Web3. But what happens as the number of markets in Web3 exponentially increases? Web3 says it provides an escape, but it’s not certain whether the escape is scarcity financial games that shift attention or a new fairground with even playing rules. We were trained to play the game rather than play the game in a fair manner. \n\nRight now, and for the foreseeable future, follower graphs on centralized social networks are a source of significant and enduring value. We see in every dimension of our society how efficiently that influence can be translated into financial, political and cultural gain. So to ask our question another way: Will there be a time when most users’ on-chain identities and reputations are more valuable to them than their centralized social network follower count and composition? The three answer options above represent different degrees of optimism.\n\nIt is easy, given the trajectory of this most recent era of tech, to be pessimistic. Many of the idealistic outcomes people argued were ‘inevitable’ in 2004 now look laughably pollyannaish. But our current situation, strangely simultaneously both centralized and chaotic, is neither all bad nor intractable. The mobile and social transition that flooded — and still floods — billions of people into Web2 is providing a historic opening for human creativity and connection. For all of the algorithmic manipulation and clever incentives of social networks, these are billions of human beings with free will. They aren’t pre-programmed robots. It is factful not fanciful to recognize that they will determine the future. But they won’t do it based on vague ideals of decentralization. Only if and to the extent that Web3 truly benefits their lives will they push past our legacy networks into a next phase. \n\n", "timestamp": 1623954533, "digest": "aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

(Is this even the way that phases of the Internet works?)  \n\nMany blockchain enthusiasts seem to suggest as much. As the term Web2 has become closely associated with centralized social networks like Twitter and Facebook, and as those networks have become increasingly politically powerful -- with arbitrary, capricious or simply incompetent moderation policies not to mention potentially societally harmful business practices -- it is common to hear crypto folks imply that decentralized applications would do a better job. Community-owned networks would be fairer, in that the users who created the content and attracted new members would fully participate, as token holders, in the value they created. The distribution of content could be based on meaningful values like reputation and expertise, rather than gamified outrage and algorithmically rewarded hype. And governance, like moderation policies, would be driven by the entire community, rather than a small club of executives and their handpicked oversight committees made up of insiders looking to maximize their own wealth or security. The attractiveness of this superior model, it is proposed, will lure in key influencers, provide a better user experience, and propel a shift from the old social platforms to the new.\n\nAnd yet, it’s difficult to see how that happens. If anything, it seems like crypto has made the ‘old’ centralized social networks, especially Twitter, more central than ever. How many influencers have used their followers to make an easy leap into crypto sales? How many important projects have used social media to find and recruit contributors? Where else would advocates for new coins and tokens state their cases and share their memes? Where else could we show off our CryptoPunks, Hashmasks and Bored Apes? And how could a Bitcoin day trader not keep his eyes glued on Elon’s Twitter feed over the past few months? Social media is so essential to the day-to-day reality of DeFi that it is hard to see where one ends and the other begins. And it is arguably precisely the gamified virality of centralized platforms that makes them so valuable to crypto marketing and community. \n\nGiven this dynamic, how realistic is some transition? Or have we actually trapped ourselves deeper in a centralized system? And what is actually wrong with Web2 anyway?\n\n### What is actually wrong with Web2?\n\nIn 2004 “Web2” was popularized at a conference which sought to ask the very same question: “What is wrong?” The organizers of the first Web2 conference felt that the industry “had lost its way” after the dotcom bubble burst and needed an injection of confidence. In particular, there was a sense that the vertically integrated portals, like America Online and Yahoo, had created unsustainable monoliths ‘evilly’ trapped users and their data, prevented creative innovation from smaller startups, and led to bubble and bust. Web2 at its outset was about understanding and emulating the ideals and design concepts of the open source movement, but also the success of companies that were still expanding despite the drought, like Google and Amazon. \n\nIn those days, Google especially was seen as a role model, in the way that it sent searching users away to the best resources. Rather than try to seize 100% of the value, the virtuous approach was also the best for the ecosystem. The symbolically central concept was that of the ‘open API.’ Everyone should and would build on everyone else. In fact, one of the most important lessons gleaned from the surviving companies was that user-generated content and data could be a source of sustainable competitive advantage while improving the user experience and the web for all. Users would from here on be first-class contributors, no longer relegated to bottom-of-the-page comments sections, but rather the stars of these new open systems. Developers would vie to attract their usage and contributions by offering ever greater freedoms and flexibility. The best companies would be the best platforms, creating more value for the entire ecosystem.\n\nBut the catch was that this was never a sustainable long-term strategy, at least not for the purposes of promoting an open ecosystem. User-generated data is vulnerable to a family of sub optimizations such as Goodhart’s Law, in which using a “measure” as a “metric” devalues the measure itself. If you’re Google building PageRank on natural weblinks you’ll quickly generate SEO schemes which seek to game your measure. If you’re Amazon relying on user-generated reviews, you’ll soon be flooded with fakes. And if you’re Facebook building algorithms for user recommendation, you’ll soon be suggested content in your existing ideologies and filter bubbles. \n\nThese measure-based competitive advantages erode as companies instill them as metrics to be gained and optimized against. The result is that these companies, naturally seeking to maintain advantage, are forced to develop strong capabilities in user management and manipulation themselves. More charitably, it turns out that the data was more a means to reduce friction, improve experience and aggregate demand centrally, recreating most of the negatives of the old portal system, just with a friendly moniker that everything is just one click away. These successful companies in most cases weren’t true platforms, but aggregators, locking in demand and exerting central control, though admittedly with a velvet fist enforced at least at first and in part by superior user experience.\n\nAnd this necessary lock-in is arguably the source of today’s ire. Whereas 2004's Web2 was reckoning with *marketplace failure*, 2021's Web3 is reckoning with *user failure*. We are a community of people failing the marshmallow test, always optimizing for less friction, more dopamine and shorter feedback cycles. We claim to want richer experiences, to support independent actors, to despise centralization and to demand more meaningful connections and higher quality content. But then we unlock our phones. And so Google, Facebook and Twitter’s success with data-based ad monetization and engagement optimized user experience is now the problem, not the solution. \n\nAs Web2 companies began to deeply understand the powerful potential of their innovations — the game-ish reaction buttons, the follower graph, the algorithmic ‘newsfeed’ — they became adept at a clever stratagem. Rather than committing to perpetual openness, they could offer new user tools or developer APIs and encourage the community to use them to create. If the results were beneficial to the company, they might allow this creativity to flourish for a while, but soon enough, they would either charge the most successful creations for prominence or buy or build their own. \n\nIt was hard to blame them for this approach. It worked! Twitter, Facebook and Google were for-profit companies and the dynamic was not new for ‘platforms.’ Microsoft, the boogeyman of the open source community, had employed similar tactics in its heyday. But it was the development and explosive growth of the smartphone that made it so ferocious. \nMobile devices, with their app stores, emojis, cameras, notifications and most importantly, constant tactile presence, were the perfect match for ‘Web2’ social networks. Every new phone buyer was a potential heavy social user, and the dense relationship networks that quickly formed made it almost impossible for people to resist buying phones to access them. \n\nThis loop triggered a flood of new and highly engaged users unlike anything seen in the history of technology adoption. All over the world, people who recently had only limited access to computers were now checking their newsfeeds throughout the day. Every new family or friend each of them followed increased the value of the experience, the depth of their connection and the virality of the network. Mobile and social became a second brain, “notifications” a sixth sense. So, even if content creators and app developers knew the ‘game’ was ‘rigged,’ how could they not take advantage of this massive opportunity? Maybe, they reasoned, if their brand or invention was the first, if it was the best, it might be one of the few that got so big so fast they’d achieve some kind of escape velocity from the gravity well of the social networks. After all, it had happened. Social apps or content with just the right combination of uniqueness, design genius and luck had hit the jackpot and acquired millions of customers within hours. And so they poured their ideas, talent and cash into these platforms, adding even more appealing media and interactivity, fostering even deeper engagement without any additional cost to the network. And despite the grumbles about unfair practices or addictive behaviors, all this just made the networks more essential. The flood of users kept pouring in. \n\nWe now live in a world of this flood. It’s a world overflowing with social activity, a world where every institution is dragged around by the currents of a new wildly unpredictable environment. Our children dream of growing up to be Instagram ‘influencers.’ Our pop charts are a direct output of the most popular backing tracks on Tiktok. A Facebook-inspired political cult attacked the US Capitol. Even the social platforms are buffeted by the storms unleashed by their technology. Their efforts to assert control have little effect, other than making their position even more essential and central. So, it is in the context of this flooded world, that the notion of Web3 as a successor paradigm has such alluring appeal. \n\n- **Platform wealth and economic sharing**: Today, creators & consumers contribute to a platform to gain social or economic status. But this status is rented (status on platform only, revenue shared directly with platform). In Web3 this status is owned. Not only is social reputation portable, but the relationship with IP created on platform can be owned and portable as well. \n\n- **Content ownership and rights**: Web3 introduces ownership as a process. As IP is put out on the web, IP is minted on chain in order to show provenance and give creator control to its distribution and usage rights. This is done on the individual level vs. the platform level. \n\n- **The happy accident of NFTs**: it seems increasingly evident that certain objects on an open, interoperable world computer will be treated and valued like, well… real objects. This is not yet fully understood, but insofar as NFTs are unique to blockchain-style architectures this would represent quite an advantage.\n\n- **Lies, hype and bots**: Actors can still choose to create as many personalities, handles, keys, etc. as they’d like. However, the incentive for building reputation is to accumulate as much good faith on a single identity as possible. This will enable better positioning and recruiting into more lucrative and socially beneficial opportunities than those handles that lack reputation. \n\n- **Governance, individual influence and moderation**: As we discussed in previous articles, ownership is less about financial upside and more about social influence. In Web3, the individual is now influential within the organization it holds tokens of, giving s/he the ability to drive decision making that will bring better health and effectiveness to the community. \n\n- **Permissionless development and composability**: Today’s platforms control what can and cannot be published on their network. It also starts every user from the same starting line. In Web3, development is unrestricted because the permission is tied directly to that individual's reputation. Every decision they make is tied to their identity, so it’s a choice as to whether or not you want to carry these decisions with you throughout the web. Everything built on the protocol is foundational to what others can build on top of it. So instead of everyone acting independently and starting from scratch, everyone works in collaboration and builds on top of foundational legos from other members before them. \n\n- **New models of work and collaboration**: The business models of Web3 encourage collaboration. In Web2, all revenue streams reward the action of the output (advertising against what’s already published, subscribing to a finished piece of work). In Web3, there’s now a business model on the input. Crowdfunding and social tokens are an investment in the idea before there is any output generated, encouraging strong collaboration at the onset which rewards all participants throughout the creative process\n\nThis is a rich set of imagined capabilities that directly answers the most pernicious problems of Web2 as it has crystallized nearly twenty years after its inception: ownership, governance, openness, incentives, reputation. In many ways, the solutions Web3 proposes are the direct opposite of those offered by social networks, a far ‘better deal’ for users, creators and developers, an approach intentionally weighted to reward the individual or team on the basis of her, his or their input, rather than be drowned amid ever increasing control and returns to the owners and operators of networks. Which leads us to the question: If it’s better for more people, will Web3 replace Web2? Why wouldn’t it? \n\nThere are three possible answers:\n\n1) No -- Web3 is best understood as a sort of ‘economic’ extension of Web2, especially of social media, and it will grow as Web2 grows.\n\n2) Sort of -- key aspects of Web2 will be better performed by Web3 systems and there will be a symbiotic relationship between two parallel but similarly powerful models.\n\n3) Yes -- over time, all of the key aspects of Web2, including centralized social networks, will be replaced by web3-style user-owned and governed protocols.\n\nWe can think of these being three horizons: Web3 as testing ground (1), as complement (2), or as critique (3). As for the first, it may be that Web3 is a sort of open lab of experimentation whose successes will eventually be absorbed by existing structures. This testing ground outcome emerges if the natural inefficiencies of, say, Web3 database structures don’t have any compensating advantages over the long term. The second outcome of complementarity occurs as aspects of Web3 thrive alongside, and even enhance the value of, Web2. This seems to be the case with Twitter, which may be the greatest consumer onramp to Web3 and clearly plays a major role in the ecosystem. The third outcome, the most extreme, is probably best thought of as Web3 being an inherent critique of Web2. Replacement will seem necessary insofar as Twitter, or Facebook, or Paypal’s success is thought to be Web3’s failure. \n\nPerhaps one difference between today’s context and 2004’s -- when we roughly transitioned to the social/mobile Web2 -- is that the large tech companies that have mastered their strategies are broadly and firmly entrenched, and it isn’t as clear how a newcomer can emulate or even improve on their strategies while maintaining defensibility. To look at Twitter for example, for crypto, its ‘purpose’ is a portal to scarcity games, NFT drops, and FOMO. The function today is to spread narratives and create FOMO for markets in Web3. But what happens as the number of markets in Web3 exponentially increases? Web3 says it provides an escape, but it’s not certain whether the escape is scarcity financial games that shift attention or a new fairground with even playing rules. We were trained to play the game rather than play the game in a fair manner. \n\nRight now, and for the foreseeable future, follower graphs on centralized social networks are a source of significant and enduring value. We see in every dimension of our society how efficiently that influence can be translated into financial, political and cultural gain. So to ask our question another way: Will there be a time when most users’ on-chain identities and reputations are more valuable to them than their centralized social network follower count and composition? The three answer options above represent different degrees of optimism.\n\nIt is easy, given the trajectory of this most recent era of tech, to be pessimistic. Many of the idealistic outcomes people argued were ‘inevitable’ in 2004 now look laughably pollyannaish. But our current situation, strangely simultaneously both centralized and chaotic, is neither all bad nor intractable. The mobile and social transition that flooded — and still floods — billions of people into Web2 is providing a historic opening for human creativity and connection. For all of the algorithmic manipulation and clever incentives of social networks, these are billions of human beings with free will. They aren’t pre-programmed robots. It is factful not fanciful to recognize that they will determine the future. But they won’t do it based on vague ideals of decentralization. Only if and to the extent that Web3 truly benefits their lives will they push past our legacy networks into a next phase. \n\n", "timestamp": 1623954507, "digest": "aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

Where else would advocates for new coins and tokens state their cases and share their memes? Where else could we show off our CryptoPunks, Hashmasks and Bored Apes? And how could a Bitcoin day trader not keep his eyes glued on Elon’s Twitter feed over the past few months? Social media is so essential to the day-to-day reality of DeFi that it is hard to see where one ends and the other begins. And it is arguably precisely the gamified virality of centralized platforms that makes them so valuable to crypto marketing and community. \n\nGiven this dynamic, how realistic is some transition? Or have we actually trapped ourselves deeper in a centralized system? And what is actually wrong with Web2 anyway?\n\n### What is actually wrong with Web2?\n\nIn 2004 “Web2” was popularized at a conference which sought to ask the very same question: “What is wrong?” The organizers of the first Web2 conference felt that the industry “had lost its way” after the dotcom bubble burst and needed an injection of confidence. In particular, there was a sense that the vertically integrated portals, like America Online and Yahoo, had created unsustainable monoliths ‘evilly’ trapped users and their data, prevented creative innovation from smaller startups, and led to bubble and bust. Web2 at its outset was about understanding and emulating the ideals and design concepts of the open source movement, but also the success of companies that were still expanding despite the drought, like Google and Amazon. \n\nIn those days, Google especially was seen as a role model, in the way that it sent searching users away to the best resources. Rather than try to seize 100% of the value, the virtuous approach was also the best for the ecosystem. The symbolically central concept was that of the ‘open API.’ Everyone should and would build on everyone else. In fact, one of the most important lessons gleaned from the surviving companies was that user-generated content and data could be a source of sustainable competitive advantage while improving the user experience and the web for all. Users would from here on be first-class contributors, no longer relegated to bottom-of-the-page comments sections, but rather the stars of these new open systems. Developers would vie to attract their usage and contributions by offering ever greater freedoms and flexibility. The best companies would be the best platforms, creating more value for the entire ecosystem.\n\nBut the catch was that this was never a sustainable long-term strategy, at least not for the purposes of promoting an open ecosystem. User-generated data is vulnerable to a family of sub optimizations such as Goodhart’s Law, in which using a “measure” as a “metric” devalues the measure itself. If you’re Google building PageRank on natural weblinks you’ll quickly generate SEO schemes which seek to game your measure. If you’re Amazon relying on user-generated reviews, you’ll soon be flooded with fakes. And if you’re Facebook building algorithms for user recommendation, you’ll soon be suggested content in your existing ideologies and filter bubbles. \n\nThese measure-based competitive advantages erode as companies instill them as metrics to be gained and optimized against. The result is that these companies, naturally seeking to maintain advantage, are forced to develop strong capabilities in user management and manipulation themselves. More charitably, it turns out that the data was more a means to reduce friction, improve experience and aggregate demand centrally, recreating most of the negatives of the old portal system, just with a friendly moniker that everything is just one click away. These successful companies in most cases weren’t true platforms, but aggregators, locking in demand and exerting central control, though admittedly with a velvet fist enforced at least at first and in part by superior user experience.\n\nAnd this necessary lock-in is arguably the source of today’s ire. Whereas 2004's Web2 was reckoning with *marketplace failure*, 2021's Web3 is reckoning with *user failure*. We are a community of people failing the marshmallow test, always optimizing for less friction, more dopamine and shorter feedback cycles. We claim to want richer experiences, to support independent actors, to despise centralization and to demand more meaningful connections and higher quality content. But then we unlock our phones. And so Google, Facebook and Twitter’s success with data-based ad monetization and engagement optimized user experience is now the problem, not the solution. \n\nAs Web2 companies began to deeply understand the powerful potential of their innovations — the game-ish reaction buttons, the follower graph, the algorithmic ‘newsfeed’ — they became adept at a clever stratagem. Rather than committing to perpetual openness, they could offer new user tools or developer APIs and encourage the community to use them to create. If the results were beneficial to the company, they might allow this creativity to flourish for a while, but soon enough, they would either charge the most successful creations for prominence or buy or build their own. \n\nIt was hard to blame them for this approach. It worked! Twitter, Facebook and Google were for-profit companies and the dynamic was not new for ‘platforms.’ Microsoft, the boogeyman of the open source community, had employed similar tactics in its heyday. But it was the development and explosive growth of the smartphone that made it so ferocious. \nMobile devices, with their app stores, emojis, cameras, notifications and most importantly, constant tactile presence, were the perfect match for ‘Web2’ social networks. Every new phone buyer was a potential heavy social user, and the dense relationship networks that quickly formed made it almost impossible for people to resist buying phones to access them. \n\nThis loop triggered a flood of new and highly engaged users unlike anything seen in the history of technology adoption. All over the world, people who recently had only limited access to computers were now checking their newsfeeds throughout the day. Every new family or friend each of them followed increased the value of the experience, the depth of their connection and the virality of the network. Mobile and social became a second brain, “notifications” a sixth sense. So, even if content creators and app developers knew the ‘game’ was ‘rigged,’ how could they not take advantage of this massive opportunity? Maybe, they reasoned, if their brand or invention was the first, if it was the best, it might be one of the few that got so big so fast they’d achieve some kind of escape velocity from the gravity well of the social networks. After all, it had happened. Social apps or content with just the right combination of uniqueness, design genius and luck had hit the jackpot and acquired millions of customers within hours. And so they poured their ideas, talent and cash into these platforms, adding even more appealing media and interactivity, fostering even deeper engagement without any additional cost to the network. And despite the grumbles about unfair practices or addictive behaviors, all this just made the networks more essential. The flood of users kept pouring in. \n\nWe now live in a world of this flood. It’s a world overflowing with social activity, a world where every institution is dragged around by the currents of a new wildly unpredictable environment. Our children dream of growing up to be Instagram ‘influencers.’ Our pop charts are a direct output of the most popular backing tracks on Tiktok. A Facebook-inspired political cult attacked the US Capitol. Even the social platforms are buffeted by the storms unleashed by their technology. Their efforts to assert control have little effect, other than making their position even more essential and central. So, it is in the context of this flooded world, that the notion of Web3 as a successor paradigm has such alluring appeal. \n\n- **Platform wealth and economic sharing**: Today, creators & consumers contribute to a platform to gain social or economic status. But this status is rented (status on platform only, revenue shared directly with platform). In Web3 this status is owned. Not only is social reputation portable, but the relationship with IP created on platform can be owned and portable as well. \n\n- **Content ownership and rights**: Web3 introduces ownership as a process. As IP is put out on the web, IP is minted on chain in order to show provenance and give creator control to its distribution and usage rights. This is done on the individual level vs. the platform level. \n\n- **The happy accident of NFTs**: it seems increasingly evident that certain objects on an open, interoperable world computer will be treated and valued like, well… real objects. This is not yet fully understood, but insofar as NFTs are unique to blockchain-style architectures this would represent quite an advantage.\n\n- **Lies, hype and bots**: Actors can still choose to create as many personalities, handles, keys, etc. as they’d like. However, the incentive for building reputation is to accumulate as much good faith on a single identity as possible. This will enable better positioning and recruiting into more lucrative and socially beneficial opportunities than those handles that lack reputation. \n\n- **Governance, individual influence and moderation**: As we discussed in previous articles, ownership is less about financial upside and more about social influence. In Web3, the individual is now influential within the organization it holds tokens of, giving s/he the ability to drive decision making that will bring better health and effectiveness to the community. \n\n- **Permissionless development and composability**: Today’s platforms control what can and cannot be published on their network. It also starts every user from the same starting line. In Web3, development is unrestricted because the permission is tied directly to that individual's reputation. Every decision they make is tied to their identity, so it’s a choice as to whether or not you want to carry these decisions with you throughout the web. Everything built on the protocol is foundational to what others can build on top of it. So instead of everyone acting independently and starting from scratch, everyone works in collaboration and builds on top of foundational legos from other members before them. \n\n- **New models of work and collaboration**: The business models of Web3 encourage collaboration. In Web2, all revenue streams reward the action of the output (advertising against what’s already published, subscribing to a finished piece of work). In Web3, there’s now a business model on the input. Crowdfunding and social tokens are an investment in the idea before there is any output generated, encouraging strong collaboration at the onset which rewards all participants throughout the creative process\n\nThis is a rich set of imagined capabilities that directly answers the most pernicious problems of Web2 as it has crystallized nearly twenty years after its inception: ownership, governance, openness, incentives, reputation. In many ways, the solutions Web3 proposes are the direct opposite of those offered by social networks, a far ‘better deal’ for users, creators and developers, an approach intentionally weighted to reward the individual or team on the basis of her, his or their input, rather than be drowned amid ever increasing control and returns to the owners and operators of networks. Which leads us to the question: If it’s better for more people, will Web3 replace Web2? Why wouldn’t it? \n\nThere are three possible answers:\n\n1) No -- Web3 is best understood as a sort of ‘economic’ extension of Web2, especially of social media, and it will grow as Web2 grows.\n\n2) Sort of -- key aspects of Web2 will be better performed by Web3 systems and there will be a symbiotic relationship between two parallel but similarly powerful models.\n\n3) Yes -- over time, all of the key aspects of Web2, including centralized social networks, will be replaced by web3-style user-owned and governed protocols.\n\nWe can think of these being three horizons: Web3 as testing ground (1), as complement (2), or as critique (3). As for the first, it may be that Web3 is a sort of open lab of experimentation whose successes will eventually be absorbed by existing structures. This testing ground outcome emerges if the natural inefficiencies of, say, Web3 database structures don’t have any compensating advantages over the long term. The second outcome of complementarity occurs as aspects of Web3 thrive alongside, and even enhance the value of, Web2. This seems to be the case with Twitter, which may be the greatest consumer onramp to Web3 and clearly plays a major role in the ecosystem. The third outcome, the most extreme, is probably best thought of as Web3 being an inherent critique of Web2. Replacement will seem necessary insofar as Twitter, or Facebook, or Paypal’s success is thought to be Web3’s failure. \n\nPerhaps one difference between today’s context and 2004’s -- when we roughly transitioned to the social/mobile Web2 -- is that the large tech companies that have mastered their strategies are broadly and firmly entrenched, and it isn’t as clear how a newcomer can emulate or even improve on their strategies while maintaining defensibility. To look at Twitter for example, for crypto, its ‘purpose’ is a portal to scarcity games, NFT drops, and FOMO. The function today is to spread narratives and create FOMO for markets in Web3. But what happens as the number of markets in Web3 exponentially increases? Web3 says it provides an escape, but it’s not certain whether the escape is scarcity financial games that shift attention or a new fairground with even playing rules. We were trained to play the game rather than play the game in a fair manner. \n\nRight now, and for the foreseeable future, follower graphs on centralized social networks are a source of significant and enduring value. We see in every dimension of our society how efficiently that influence can be translated into financial, political and cultural gain. So to ask our question another way: Will there be a time when most users’ on-chain identities and reputations are more valuable to them than their centralized social network follower count and composition? The three answer options above represent different degrees of optimism.\n\nIt is easy, given the trajectory of this most recent era of tech, to be pessimistic. Many of the idealistic outcomes people argued were ‘inevitable’ in 2004 now look laughably pollyannaish. But our current situation, strangely simultaneously both centralized and chaotic, is neither all bad nor intractable. The mobile and social transition that flooded — and still floods — billions of people into Web2 is providing a historic opening for human creativity and connection. For all of the algorithmic manipulation and clever incentives of social networks, these are billions of human beings with free will. They aren’t pre-programmed robots. It is factful not fanciful to recognize that they will determine the future. But they won’t do it based on vague ideals of decentralization. Only if and to the extent that Web3 truly benefits their lives will they push past our legacy networks into a next phase. \n\n", "timestamp": 1623954553, "digest": "aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

In technology, versions are successors. When the new model comes out, we upgrade and the older one is replaced and forgotten.\n\nIs this what we mean when we refer to Web3? Will it replace the set of principles, technologies and behaviors that we’ve come to know as Web2? (Is this even the way that phases of the Internet works?)  \n\nMany blockchain enthusiasts seem to suggest as much. As the term Web2 has become closely associated with centralized social networks like Twitter and Facebook, and as those networks have become increasingly politically powerful -- with arbitrary, capricious or simply incompetent moderation policies not to mention potentially societally harmful business practices -- it is common to hear crypto folks imply that decentralized applications would do a better job. Community-owned networks would be fairer, in that the users who created the content and attracted new members would fully participate, as token holders, in the value they created. The distribution of content could be based on meaningful values like reputation and expertise, rather than gamified outrage and algorithmically rewarded hype. And governance, like moderation policies, would be driven by the entire community, rather than a small club of executives and their handpicked oversight committees made up of insiders looking to maximize their own wealth or security. The attractiveness of this superior model, it is proposed, will lure in key influencers, provide a better user experience, and propel a shift from the old social platforms to the new.\n\nAnd yet, it’s difficult to see how that happens. If anything, it seems like crypto has made the ‘old’ centralized social networks, especially Twitter, more central than ever.

Web2 at its outset was about understanding and emulating the ideals and design concepts of the open source movement, but also the success of companies that were still expanding despite the drought, like Google and Amazon. \n\nIn those days, Google especially was seen as a role model, in the way that it sent searching users away to the best resources. Rather than try to seize 100% of the value, the virtuous approach was also the best for the ecosystem. The symbolically central concept was that of the ‘open API.’ Everyone should and would build on everyone else. In fact, one of the most important lessons gleaned from the surviving companies was that user-generated content and data could be a source of sustainable competitive advantage while improving the user experience and the web for all. Users would from here on be first-class contributors, no longer relegated to bottom-of-the-page comments sections, but rather the stars of these new open systems. Developers would vie to attract their usage and contributions by offering ever greater freedoms and flexibility. The best companies would be the best platforms, creating more value for the entire ecosystem.\n\nBut the catch was that this was never a sustainable long-term strategy, at least not for the purposes of promoting an open ecosystem. User-generated data is vulnerable to a family of sub optimizations such as Goodhart’s Law, in which using a “measure” as a “metric” devalues the measure itself. If you’re Google building PageRank on natural weblinks you’ll quickly generate SEO schemes which seek to game your measure. If you’re Amazon relying on user-generated reviews, you’ll soon be flooded with fakes. And if you’re Facebook building algorithms for user recommendation, you’ll soon be suggested content in your existing ideologies and filter bubbles. \n\nThese measure-based competitive advantages erode as companies instill them as metrics to be gained and optimized against. The result is that these companies, naturally seeking to maintain advantage, are forced to develop strong capabilities in user management and manipulation themselves. More charitably, it turns out that the data was more a means to reduce friction, improve experience and aggregate demand centrally, recreating most of the negatives of the old portal system, just with a friendly moniker that everything is just one click away. These successful companies in most cases weren’t true platforms, but aggregators, locking in demand and exerting central control, though admittedly with a velvet fist enforced at least at first and in part by superior user experience.\n\nAnd this necessary lock-in is arguably the source of today’s ire. Whereas 2004's Web2 was reckoning with *marketplace failure*, 2021's Web3 is reckoning with *user failure*. We are a community of people failing the marshmallow test, always optimizing for less friction, more dopamine and shorter feedback cycles. We claim to want richer experiences, to support independent actors, to despise centralization and to demand more meaningful connections and higher quality content. But then we unlock our phones. And so Google, Facebook and Twitter’s success with data-based ad monetization and engagement optimized user experience is now the problem, not the solution. \n\nAs Web2 companies began to deeply understand the powerful potential of their innovations — the game-ish reaction buttons, the follower graph, the algorithmic ‘newsfeed’ — they became adept at a clever stratagem. Rather than committing to perpetual openness, they could offer new user tools or developer APIs and encourage the community to use them to create. If the results were beneficial to the company, they might allow this creativity to flourish for a while, but soon enough, they would either charge the most successful creations for prominence or buy or build their own. \n\nIt was hard to blame them for this approach. It worked! Twitter, Facebook and Google were for-profit companies and the dynamic was not new for ‘platforms.’ Microsoft, the boogeyman of the open source community, had employed similar tactics in its heyday. But it was the development and explosive growth of the smartphone that made it so ferocious. \nMobile devices, with their app stores, emojis, cameras, notifications and most importantly, constant tactile presence, were the perfect match for ‘Web2’ social networks. Every new phone buyer was a potential heavy social user, and the dense relationship networks that quickly formed made it almost impossible for people to resist buying phones to access them. \n\nThis loop triggered a flood of new and highly engaged users unlike anything seen in the history of technology adoption. All over the world, people who recently had only limited access to computers were now checking their newsfeeds throughout the day. Every new family or friend each of them followed increased the value of the experience, the depth of their connection and the virality of the network. Mobile and social became a second brain, “notifications” a sixth sense. So, even if content creators and app developers knew the ‘game’ was ‘rigged,’ how could they not take advantage of this massive opportunity? Maybe, they reasoned, if their brand or invention was the first, if it was the best, it might be one of the few that got so big so fast they’d achieve some kind of escape velocity from the gravity well of the social networks. After all, it had happened. Social apps or content with just the right combination of uniqueness, design genius and luck had hit the jackpot and acquired millions of customers within hours. And so they poured their ideas, talent and cash into these platforms, adding even more appealing media and interactivity, fostering even deeper engagement without any additional cost to the network. And despite the grumbles about unfair practices or addictive behaviors, all this just made the networks more essential. The flood of users kept pouring in. \n\nWe now live in a world of this flood. It’s a world overflowing with social activity, a world where every institution is dragged around by the currents of a new wildly unpredictable environment. Our children dream of growing up to be Instagram ‘influencers.’ Our pop charts are a direct output of the most popular backing tracks on Tiktok. A Facebook-inspired political cult attacked the US Capitol. Even the social platforms are buffeted by the storms unleashed by their technology. Their efforts to assert control have little effect, other than making their position even more essential and central. So, it is in the context of this flooded world, that the notion of Web3 as a successor paradigm has such alluring appeal. \n\n- **Platform wealth and economic sharing**: Today, creators & consumers contribute to a platform to gain social or economic status. But this status is rented (status on platform only, revenue shared directly with platform). In Web3 this status is owned. Not only is social reputation portable, but the relationship with IP created on platform can be owned and portable as well. \n\n- **Content ownership and rights**: Web3 introduces ownership as a process. As IP is put out on the web, IP is minted on chain in order to show provenance and give creator control to its distribution and usage rights. This is done on the individual level vs. the platform level. \n\n- **The happy accident of NFTs**: it seems increasingly evident that certain objects on an open, interoperable world computer will be treated and valued like, well… real objects. This is not yet fully understood, but insofar as NFTs are unique to blockchain-style architectures this would represent quite an advantage.\n\n- **Lies, hype and bots**: Actors can still choose to create as many personalities, handles, keys, etc. as they’d like. However, the incentive for building reputation is to accumulate as much good faith on a single identity as possible. This will enable better positioning and recruiting into more lucrative and socially beneficial opportunities than those handles that lack reputation. \n\n- **Governance, individual influence and moderation**: As we discussed in previous articles, ownership is less about financial upside and more about social influence. In Web3, the individual is now influential within the organization it holds tokens of, giving s/he the ability to drive decision making that will bring better health and effectiveness to the community. \n\n- **Permissionless development and composability**: Today’s platforms control what can and cannot be published on their network. It also starts every user from the same starting line. In Web3, development is unrestricted because the permission is tied directly to that individual's reputation. Every decision they make is tied to their identity, so it’s a choice as to whether or not you want to carry these decisions with you throughout the web. Everything built on the protocol is foundational to what others can build on top of it. So instead of everyone acting independently and starting from scratch, everyone works in collaboration and builds on top of foundational legos from other members before them. \n\n- **New models of work and collaboration**: The business models of Web3 encourage collaboration. In Web2, all revenue streams reward the action of the output (advertising against what’s already published, subscribing to a finished piece of work). In Web3, there’s now a business model on the input. Crowdfunding and social tokens are an investment in the idea before there is any output generated, encouraging strong collaboration at the onset which rewards all participants throughout the creative process\n\nThis is a rich set of imagined capabilities that directly answers the most pernicious problems of Web2 as it has crystallized nearly twenty years after its inception: ownership, governance, openness, incentives, reputation. In many ways, the solutions Web3 proposes are the direct opposite of those offered by social networks, a far ‘better deal’ for users, creators and developers, an approach intentionally weighted to reward the individual or team on the basis of her, his or their input, rather than be drowned amid ever increasing control and returns to the owners and operators of networks. Which leads us to the question: If it’s better for more people, will Web3 replace Web2? Why wouldn’t it? \n\nThere are three possible answers:\n\n1) No -- Web3 is best understood as a sort of ‘economic’ extension of Web2, especially of social media, and it will grow as Web2 grows.\n\n2) Sort of -- key aspects of Web2 will be better performed by Web3 systems and there will be a symbiotic relationship between two parallel but similarly powerful models.\n\n3) Yes -- over time, all of the key aspects of Web2, including centralized social networks, will be replaced by web3-style user-owned and governed protocols.\n\nWe can think of these being three horizons: Web3 as testing ground (1), as complement (2), or as critique (3). As for the first, it may be that Web3 is a sort of open lab of experimentation whose successes will eventually be absorbed by existing structures. This testing ground outcome emerges if the natural inefficiencies of, say, Web3 database structures don’t have any compensating advantages over the long term. The second outcome of complementarity occurs as aspects of Web3 thrive alongside, and even enhance the value of, Web2. This seems to be the case with Twitter, which may be the greatest consumer onramp to Web3 and clearly plays a major role in the ecosystem. The third outcome, the most extreme, is probably best thought of as Web3 being an inherent critique of Web2. Replacement will seem necessary insofar as Twitter, or Facebook, or Paypal’s success is thought to be Web3’s failure. \n\nPerhaps one difference between today’s context and 2004’s -- when we roughly transitioned to the social/mobile Web2 -- is that the large tech companies that have mastered their strategies are broadly and firmly entrenched, and it isn’t as clear how a newcomer can emulate or even improve on their strategies while maintaining defensibility. To look at Twitter for example, for crypto, its ‘purpose’ is a portal to scarcity games, NFT drops, and FOMO. The function today is to spread narratives and create FOMO for markets in Web3. But what happens as the number of markets in Web3 exponentially increases? Web3 says it provides an escape, but it’s not certain whether the escape is scarcity financial games that shift attention or a new fairground with even playing rules. We were trained to play the game rather than play the game in a fair manner. \n\nRight now, and for the foreseeable future, follower graphs on centralized social networks are a source of significant and enduring value. We see in every dimension of our society how efficiently that influence can be translated into financial, political and cultural gain. So to ask our question another way: Will there be a time when most users’ on-chain identities and reputations are more valuable to them than their centralized social network follower count and composition? The three answer options above represent different degrees of optimism.\n\nIt is easy, given the trajectory of this most recent era of tech, to be pessimistic. Many of the idealistic outcomes people argued were ‘inevitable’ in 2004 now look laughably pollyannaish. But our current situation, strangely simultaneously both centralized and chaotic, is neither all bad nor intractable. The mobile and social transition that flooded — and still floods — billions of people into Web2 is providing a historic opening for human creativity and connection. For all of the algorithmic manipulation and clever incentives of social networks, these are billions of human beings with free will. They aren’t pre-programmed robots. It is factful not fanciful to recognize that they will determine the future. But they won’t do it based on vague ideals of decentralization. Only if and to the extent that Web3 truly benefits their lives will they push past our legacy networks into a next phase. \n\n", "timestamp": 1623954528, "digest": "aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

{"id": "BpnqvGTGJjoJleDjaDyP8l0M5fEG47puW__chS2rSn0", "title": "Welcome to the Creator DAO Revolution", "body": "As we move from Web2 to Web3, we’ll see a shift toward a more creator-centric economy. In this ecosystem, creators will no longer sit at the bottom of the totem pole picking up scraps leftover by corporate giants but will instead be able to earn in full and instantaneously for their work. \n\nThe convergence of the creator economy and DAOs is where the magic happens. The decentralized, non-hierarchical structure of DAOs serves as a turbo boost to propel the creator economy (which is mostly theoretical right now) into reality.\n\n## The problem with the current (lack of) creator economy\n\nAfter I quit my job as an attorney to travel the world in 2017, I became a travel blogger and Instagram influencer to pay the bills while not having a “real” job. I got a nice camera, leveled up my photography skills, spent hours each day trying to build my social media following, and learned the latest marketing strategies for building an online following.\n\nI was creating content regularly, posting daily on social media and multiple times per week on my blog. I grew my following to over 15,000 monthly views on my blog and 20,000 Instagram followers, but it wasn’t enough. There were other travel bloggers and Instagram influencers with larger followings, and I wasn’t able to secure the largest brand deals because I didn’t have the largest following.\n\nDespite the struggle to monetize my content, I had a loyal and active audience. I received messages regularly from inspired fans and noticed a group of followers commenting on all of my posts.\n\nSo why did I have to rely on Instagram and other centralized platforms to decide whether my content was valuable when I already received validation that it is from my audience?\n\n## The creator economy of Web3\n\nThe creator economy of Web3 will revolutionize the way artists, musicians, and content creators have been monetizing their work for decades. Rather than relying on centralized platforms to pay them a fraction of what consumers are willing to pay, creators will get paid directly by their fans. That means creators will receive the full amount that consumers are willing to pay because intermediaries will no longer exist to take a cut of their profits.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that all of a sudden, creators will all become millionaires. On the contrary, competition will only become stiffer as more people discover the freedom that comes with being a creator. That’s why it’s important for creators to not only have opportunities to create for themselves and for their followers but also for decentralized projects and protocols that have larger and more reliable funding engines.\n\n## Creator economy, meet DAOs\n\nThis is where DAOs come in. A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a group of people who have a common mission and are governed by rules coded into a smart contract on the blockchain that all members of the DAO agree to. The founding members of a DAO decide on a set of rules to code into the smart contract that will govern the DAO, and anyone who joins the DAO after that agrees to abide by that set of rules. \n\nEach DAO is formed with a specific mission in mind, and that mission can vary widely. A DAO can be set up to fund proposals ([Moloch DAO](https://twitter.com/MolochDAO)), buy NFTs ([pleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO)), support communities ([Panvala](https://twitter.com/PanvalaHQ)), or just for fun ([pizzaDAO](https://twitter.com/pizza_dao)).\n\nOne type of DAO that hasn’t made a noticeable impact yet is the creator DAO. The intersection of the creator economy and DAOs has always felt natural and inevitable. DAOs democratize access to resources, pulling them away from the top of hierarchical structures and redistributing them amongst creators. Instead of the traditional model of \n\n> Stack resume with top credentials → Get a job/income → Contribute \n\nwhere most people can’t make it past the first step, DAOs allow creators to at least have some skin in the game by shifting the model to\n\n> Contribute → Make money → Contribute more → Make more money\n\nCompetition amongst creators will remain strong, but this model at least gives creators an opportunity to compete - not just amongst themselves but against larger, more established entities. Creators will find more opportunities to work on interesting projects that were traditionally outsourced to agencies or built in house with full time staff. \n\n## $MAKE Creator DAO\n\nThis shared mission to help Web2 creators make money in Web3 is what brought [Alex Yao](https://twitter.com/TheAlexYao) and I together during our time in the Gitcoin [KERNEL](https://twitter.com/KERNEL0x) fellowship. Together with a group of several others and led by Alex, we formed the $MAKE Creator DAO, a community for content creators to learn about creating content for Web3 projects and, in turn, earn money (crypto) for their contributions.\n\nWe believe having a community like the $MAKE Creator DAO is important because each creator has a unique voice that will bring new audiences and perspectives to Web3. It also enables creators to work together, which allows them to do more than they could individually - and have more fun doing it.\n\nOur goal is to help solve for some of the common problems creators face in today’s economy, including:\n\n- The desire to do what they love but the inability to monetize their work\n- The procurement of a dedicated following but the inability to monetize that following\n- The need for freedom but the inability to earn a consistent income\n\nAs a member of the $MAKE Creator DAO, you will:\n\n- Learn how to create content in Web3\n- Match with Web3 projects and protocols to collaborate on paid work\n- Be part of a community of other Web3 creators\n- Earn $MAKE tokens in proportion to the amount of content you create\n- Get access to exclusive community-only talks and events\n\nI’m excited to share more details about what we’ve been working on with you shortly, and we’re launching a formal cohort-based application process soon, but in the meantime, feel free to [join our discord group](https://discord.gg/6r8aEPtRty) and say hi, or tweet any questions you have to me at [@ddwchen](twitter.com/ddwchen). \n", "timestamp": 1624020201, "digest": "Y19OlShAGp8nf6t_Rngj9SuISGBIWfzHfa7j2_dWdF8", "contributor": "0xcEd09CCFc82b091195bdE04E6Cd65374518E7b95"}

These 4 transactions have historical significance to both the POB community and broader Ethereum ecosystem. Each TX is displayed in S0: GENESIS and S1: SAGA flavors of artwork. The $ZINE project was created to give back to our community and expand the $HASH-verse. Proceeds from the auction will be split between the collectors and minters.
