That means that we all control our data when we use a blockchain-based system. But it also means that this shared data layer is available to all to observe, measure, and analyze.\n\nHere are some examples of community-built charts:\n\nThe [P\\&L of the Maker lending system](https://dune.xyz/queries/17392/55749):\n\n![](https://avc.com/content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-12-at-8.53.11-AM-2048x984.png)\n\nA [time-based comparison of trading volume on the leading AMMs](https://dune.xyz/queries/1847/3261):\n\n![](https://avc.com/content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-12-at-8.54.27-AM-2048x984.png)\n\nWhat is interesting and different about Dune vs traditional analytics services is that everything is built on open data. There is no proprietary data involved. And this is as much a community (like Reddit or Wikipedia) as an analytics service.\n\n[USV recently participated in a financing for Dune.xyz](https://usv.com/writing/2021/08/dune-analytics) and we plan to start using it to observe and analyze blockchain-based systems that we are involved in and interested in.\n\nIt makes sense to me that analytics tools for blockchain-based systems will be open, community-driven, and composable.

Quick example. I was one of the first people to join CityDAO. I'd seen a tweet by Scott Fitsimones. Scott's a nice guy, smart and hard working, but he's not superhuman. Following his tweet, he simply opened a Discord channel, and populated it with a few basic ideas. Almost immediately, like magic, a DAO materialized with the powers of a genie. More than a thousand people joined in no time and immediately began collaborating. Teams were set, governance began forming, outside partners were identified and engaged, the $WriteRace was won (on their first try), and real land was evaluated in preparation for acquisition in the future. All this before a token that could further align incentives was even distributed. These DAO collaborators were fueled by the joy of working on an interesting project for a good cause with others who share the mission, and the promise of future ownership of the outcome.\n\n[DAO‚Äôs to find missing people? $$ for your best ideas ‚Äî Mirror](https://danconway.mirror.xyz/r6fadqo3KF_ndkllf0iJfbOVwmk-kXF4dH-C_z-moaQ)\n\n### üî•\n\nDefinitely check out CommonLands by community member @rlamis!\n\n> Working to close the generational wealth gap through community-owned affordable, permanent housing using innovative tech.\n\n[CommonLands - Coming Soon](https://www.commonlands.us/)\n\np.s. will have some more updates on CommonLands in the future as they are up to some BIG things! üòâ\n\n### üî•\n\n@Phil Levin was a founding team member of Culdesac, whose ambition is to build a car-free city in the US.

The ape community is dragging the devs there on Twitter as we speak bc of the shift to hyper focusing on influencers rather than nurturing the current community.\n\n> Someone say BaconDAO?\n\n> imagining a parcel map like google maps with ENS addresses. so you can see who owns each and make requests to them. interesting concept for sure\n\n> the DAO has been officially incorporated\n\n> üè° Creator Cabins is here to support City DAO for $WRITE RACE\n\n> The possibilities are endless, and the stakes are extremely high\n\n> I‚Äôm new here and confirming I‚Äôm not a bot. My expertise is in building great financial products that users love. I think we can do that with CityDAO!\n\n> 3D printing houses in general is such an awesome concept/industry, esp. for creating affordable housing. ¬†Also looks like they are primed for when CityDAO expands to the moon/Mars üôÉ\n\n> I'm a former urban planner and now work on streamlining multifamily and condominium development\n\n> currently in law school, planning on working with daos + nfts + web3 once I graduate. Fascinated by this project!\n\n> Love the mission here, and excited to get involved!\n\n> Have just voted for our City! on fire üî•\n\n> I much prefer modular homes to Tiny Homes and love this community being built near Austin\n\n> My 'day job' is creating intergenerational co-living communities, where older and younger people together and support each other. ¬†Also a real estate investor of niche asset classes like co-living, co-working and government-leased properties. ¬†I'm fascinated by the intersection of DeFi and Real Estate, particularly as a means to re-invent the way we value and underwrite real estate.\n\n> Hello folks. Fed here. I am interested in restoring \"true community\" to our lives.\n\n> I went down the NFT and DAO rabbit hole at the start of 2021 and I don‚Äôt want to come out. I‚Äôm currently a member of FingerPrintsDAO, SquiggleDAO amd Muse0. I joined this group as I‚Äôm really interested in how a DAO community can come together to impact the real world, particularly in land ownership models.\n\n> Love the Wyoming area - Love the concept of a DAO holding onto land - so I must love CityDAO!

Paperclip DAO has swapped one $PAPER/$CLIP NFT for the [1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card](https://opensea.io/assets/0x76be3b62873462d2142405439777e971754e8e77/42) offered by [@bitcoinPalmer](https://twitter.com/bitcoinPalmer/status/1425273580749742081). Palmer welcome to PaperclipDAO! üñá\n\nWe weighed several factors in making a final decision on which trade to accept. We care about more than just the economic value of a trade; we value the culture, story, and journey of the NFT as well. We also had to make a hard call about whether to honor the past or push towards the future. Our final poll after hours of discussion was a dead heat:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7af0279e-a154-4986-9893-743dee2c21c1.jpeg?height=756&width=1169)\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt easy, but we ultimately decided to go with a trade that highlighted the future of NFTs. \n\nPaperclipDAO now owns a 1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card, which can be used in [Parallel](https://www.parallel.life/), a sci-fi collectable game composed of digital collectible cards that can be combined into decks that dictate the game (think Magic at the Gathering or Pokemon). The Earthen Concept Art NFT was given only to early supporters of Parallel, and it's gratifying to see people taking the opportunity to recount [the NFT's unique history](https://twitter.com/GarretteDVF/status/1425657844414746629?s=20). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/69760d51-7aa0-4025-be9e-15367b4fee13.jpeg?height=1620&width=1080)\n\nIt‚Äôs a promising future for digitally scarce, playable cards, and since the purchase of these NFTs funds the development of the game itself, it also demonstrates the wide range of utility of NFTs. Who knows, maybe the team will let us bestow some magical paperclip power? üí´\n\nThis decision wasn‚Äôt easy; we were blown away by the offers we received and quickly realized that the hardest part would be parting with the incredible NFTs that we couldn‚Äôt accept. Check out the full [Round 1 offer thread](https://twitter.com/PaperclipDAO/status/1425117547251343369) to see all the amazing offers. \n\nGiven the quick turnaround, we only have time to highlight a few of our favorites. In no particular order, here is our homage to the ones that got away in Round 1: \n\n- Our very first offer came from JPG‚Äôs [Maria Paula Fernandez](https://twitter.com/MPtherealMVP/status/1425118535857156101), who just plain got it and proposed a trade for [simulacra](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/8112316025873927737505937898915153732580103913704334048512380170839124869121) before we had explained the project at all. Legend.  \n- Adam Cochran offered this [Cool Cat](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425206741084610566), complete with sunglasses and a great story. As competition heated up, he increased the offer to [4 Cool Cats](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425249645253496832). Adam later put forth an offer that absolutely blew his first two away! [He proposed a collection of 14 historic NFTs](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425487421895057408), in a collection titled Moments in Our History. This collection represents unique fists, influential artists, and rare defunct collectibles that helped shape the NFT space and have led to the NFT renaissance we're living right now. It‚Äôs an excellent read.\n- [A $HASH of the @paperclipDAO UNIv3 NFT](https://twitter.com/blasteasy/status/1425181303767543815) was also minted and proposed. Proof of Beauty is stunning. Just look at them. And to honor our project with a mint of the $PAPER/$CLIP NFT floored us. [Sisyphus](https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus) also offered [an original Proof of Beauty](https://opensea.io/assets/0xe18a32192ed95b0fe9d70d19e5025f103475d7ba/57896044618658097711785492504343953927315557066662158946655541218820101244980), for Beeple's first Everydays mint on-chain in another historic NFT moment offered for the first trade. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/826bf6cf-b6d7-420c-bade-3d6420592cfa.jpeg?height=1800&width=1125)\n\n- [MoonCatRescue](https://mooncatrescue.com/) is absolutely one of the great NFT stories, with a community rediscovering and rescuing these Mooncats that have been ‚Äútrapped‚Äù since the project began in 2017 (!!!).

Each NFT is tied to select on-screen credits in the film, which will be the first feature-length Ethereum documentary and the first documentary funded via NFTs. \n- [Astrocryptids](https://twitter.com/CoffeeTimesTW/status/1425254256563482627?s=20) is a charming little project where a twitter transmission bot ‚Äúbeams‚Äù mysterious code to an artist who then creates algorithmic sprites with a unique star code.

This ranked the highest in paperclip-iness! Truly the one that got away. He‚Äôs since started [an auction for the song](https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1425773677581324296?s=21) on Zora.\n- For the real OGs, we were offered a very rare [5x symmetrical clover](https://opensea.io/assets/0xb55c5cac5014c662fdbf21a2c59cd45403c482fd/226854885927226686664340372062743472810) (from Clovers.Network) of which only 55 were ever found.

Unlike a centralized exchange, SushiSwap is non-custodial and trustless. It uses an automated market maker (AMM) model to facilitate peer-to-peer exchanges of any two ERC-20 tokens in real time.\n\nSushiSwap has quickly evolved into one of the most sophisticated token liquidity engines in decentralized finance (DeFi) by releasing innovative product offerings that stretch our conception of what a DEX is supposed to be. In addition to the steady flow of new features, SushiSwap has expanded across multiple blockchains, setting itself up to be an extremely versatile multi-chain DEX.\n\n## What is Polygon? üåê\n\n[Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) is a protocol and framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. As many of us are aware, transacting on Ethereum can be costly to the average user when gas prices are high. Polygon offers fast and cheap transactions as a Layer 2 scalability solution to the Ethereum network, allowing users to experiment with DeFi without incurring substantial gas fees. \n\nSince its release, Polygon has seen a wave of DeFi protocols launch on the network, including Aave, Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and more. \n\n## SushiSwap x Polygon Swap Tutorial üéì\nIn this tutorial, we‚Äôll walkthrough how to perform a simple token swap using SushiSwap‚Äôs DEX on the Polygon network.\n\n### First, you‚Äôll need to set up your MetaMask for Polygon.\n- Login to MetaMask on your browser and click on **‚ÄòEthereum Mainnet‚Äô**.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3097504d-17cc-4f92-bea0-c0627248b5ef.jpeg?height=54&width=341)\n\n\n- From the dropdown, select **‚ÄòCustom RPC‚Äô**.\n- Enter the following information into the available fields:\n     - **Network Name:** Polygon\n     - **New RPC URL:** https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/\n     - **ChainID:** 137\n     - **Symbol:** MATIC\n     - **Block Explorer URL:** https://polygonscan.com/\n- Click ‚Äò**Save**‚Äô.\n\n### Next, bridge some assets from the Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon. \nYou can follow [this tutorial](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/wallets/matic-web-wallet/web-wallet-v2-guide/#depositing-funds-from-ethereum-to-matic) to bridge assets using the Matic Web Wallet, or you can follow the below steps to bridge your assets using Zapper. \n- Go to https://zapper.fi/ and connect your MetaMask wallet.\n- Once connected, select **‚ÄòBridge‚Äô** from the sidebar. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/db26d91d-2363-460c-bff3-82633975a0e6.jpeg?height=370&width=216)\n\n- Switch your MetaMask network back to Ethereum Mainnet if it isn‚Äôt already by selecting **‚ÄòEthereum Mainnet‚Äô** from the network dropdown (the list where you found **‚ÄòCustom RPC‚Äô** above).\n- Select the token you would like to transfer to Polygon and the token you would like to receive in exchange on Polygon from the dropdown menus. Then, enter the amount you would like to transfer.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6353c5b6-2d8c-4967-9334-737fbbae97e2.jpeg?height=698&width=467)\n\n\n- Click **‚ÄòConfirm‚Äô** and approve the transaction in MetaMask. \n- Approximately 5-10 minutes following confirmation on Ethereum, your assets will arrive on Polygon. You can check this by switching back to the Polygon network in MetaMask and verifying the tokens are in your wallet (note: if you don't see your assets, try [adding the token to MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-add-unlisted-tokens-custom-tokens-in-MetaMask)). \n\n### Now that the housekeeping is out of the way, let's swap some tokens. \n\n- Head over to https://sushi.com/ and click the **‚ÄòEnter App‚Äô** button.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e640e892-fcd2-4ecc-af38-99b57ea63bd7.jpeg?height=489&width=1098)\n\n- Connect your Metamask to SushiSwap by selecting **'Connect to a Wallet'** in the upper-right corner of the page and following the prompts. \n\n- Once your wallet is connected to SushiSwap, make sure your MetaMask is connected to the Polygon network. If properly connected, you will see ‚ÄòPolygon (Matic)‚Äô in the upper right corner of the page. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/203e5bb4-acbe-44be-a130-6c5be5a038ab.jpeg?height=58&width=238)\n\n- Select the asset you would like to swap from and the asset you would like to swap to, and fill in the desired amount.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1587850e-d49e-4710-a4be-6d879b2d0858.jpeg?height=451&width=698)\n\n- When you are ready, select **‚ÄòSwap‚Äô**. You will be prompted to verify and confirm the transaction details. If everything looks good, hit **'Confirm Swap'**.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64474979-41ed-4a0e-91f2-af429006ccf2.jpeg?height=662&width=426)\n\n- If this is your first time swapping the token via SushiSwap on Polygon, you will be prompted to confirm a MetaMask transaction to allow SushiSwap to spend your tokens. You will only need to do this once. **'Confirm'** the transaction.\n\n- After the approval, MetaMask will again prompt you to approve a transaction. This time the approval is for the actual swap. Hit **‚ÄòConfirm‚Äô** once you are ready.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/de5f0df0-8d20-422b-847c-bb7c60983cf3.jpeg?height=489&width=329)\n\n### Congratulations! ü•≥ \nYou have just completed your first swap using SushiSwap on Polygon. Make sure you [add the new token to MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-add-unlisted-tokens-custom-tokens-in-MetaMask) if it isn't already there. After a few minutes, you should see the correct balance in your wallet.\n\nWelcome to the permissionless and decentralized future of value exchange.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1628827745, "digest": "TDCA-POXFIbf6rdcDN04Mx1l4k0xd6GJ8-at9KqV4ro", "contributor": "0xC714a62A4BF7ff475C8dc3E589e1388342A38BB8"}

Polygon offers fast and cheap transactions as a Layer 2 scalability solution to the Ethereum network, allowing users to experiment with DeFi without incurring substantial gas fees. \n\nSince its release, Polygon has seen a wave of DeFi protocols launch on the network, including Aave, Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and more. \n\n## SushiSwap x Polygon Swap Tutorial üéì\nIn this tutorial, we‚Äôll walkthrough how to perform a simple token swap using SushiSwap‚Äôs DEX on the Polygon network.\n\n### First, you‚Äôll need to set up your MetaMask for Polygon.\n- Login to MetaMask on your browser and click on **‚ÄòEthereum Mainnet‚Äô**.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3097504d-17cc-4f92-bea0-c0627248b5ef.jpeg?height=54&width=341)\n\n\n- From the dropdown, select **‚ÄòCustom RPC‚Äô**.\n- Enter the following information into the available fields:\n     - **Network Name:** Polygon\n     - **New RPC URL:** https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/\n     - **ChainID:** 137\n     - **Symbol:** MATIC\n     - **Block Explorer URL:** https://polygonscan.com/\n- Click ‚Äò**Save**‚Äô.\n\n### Next, bridge some assets from the Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon. \nYou can follow [this tutorial](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/wallets/matic-web-wallet/web-wallet-v2-guide/#depositing-funds-from-ethereum-to-matic) to bridge assets using the Matic Web Wallet, or you can follow the below steps to bridge your assets using Zapper. \n- Go to https://zapper.fi/ and connect your MetaMask wallet.\n- Once connected, select **‚ÄòBridge‚Äô** from the sidebar. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/db26d91d-2363-460c-bff3-82633975a0e6.jpeg?height=370&width=216)\n\n- Switch your MetaMask network back to Ethereum Mainnet if it isn‚Äôt already by selecting **‚ÄòEthereum Mainnet‚Äô** from the network dropdown (the list where you found **‚ÄòCustom RPC‚Äô** above).\n- Select the token you would like to transfer to Polygon and the token you would like to receive in exchange on Polygon from the dropdown menus. Then, enter the amount you would like to transfer.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6353c5b6-2d8c-4967-9334-737fbbae97e2.jpeg?height=698&width=467)\n\n\n- Click **‚ÄòConfirm‚Äô** and approve the transaction in MetaMask. \n- Approximately 5-10 minutes following confirmation on Ethereum, your assets will arrive on Polygon. You can check this by switching back to the Polygon network in MetaMask and verifying the tokens are in your wallet (note: if you don't see your assets, try [adding the token to MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-add-unlisted-tokens-custom-tokens-in-MetaMask)). \n\n### Now that the housekeeping is out of the way, let's swap some tokens. \n\n- Head over to https://sushi.com/ and click the **‚ÄòEnter App‚Äô** button.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e640e892-fcd2-4ecc-af38-99b57ea63bd7.jpeg?height=489&width=1098)\n\n- Connect your Metamask to SushiSwap by selecting **'Connect to a Wallet'** in the upper-right corner of the page and following the prompts. \n\n- Once your wallet is connected to SushiSwap, make sure your MetaMask is connected to the Polygon network. If properly connected, you will see ‚ÄòPolygon (Matic)‚Äô in the upper right corner of the page. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/203e5bb4-acbe-44be-a130-6c5be5a038ab.jpeg?height=58&width=238)\n\n- Select the asset you would like to swap from and the asset you would like to swap to, and fill in the desired amount.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1587850e-d49e-4710-a4be-6d879b2d0858.jpeg?height=451&width=698)\n\n- When you are ready, select **‚ÄòSwap‚Äô**. You will be prompted to verify and confirm the transaction details. If everything looks good, hit **'Confirm Swap'**.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64474979-41ed-4a0e-91f2-af429006ccf2.jpeg?height=662&width=426)\n\n- If this is your first time swapping the token via SushiSwap on Polygon, you will be prompted to confirm a MetaMask transaction to allow SushiSwap to spend your tokens. You will only need to do this once. **'Confirm'** the transaction.\n\n- After the approval, MetaMask will again prompt you to approve a transaction. This time the approval is for the actual swap. Hit **‚ÄòConfirm‚Äô** once you are ready.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/de5f0df0-8d20-422b-847c-bb7c60983cf3.jpeg?height=489&width=329)\n\n### Congratulations! ü•≥ \nYou have just completed your first swap using SushiSwap on Polygon. Make sure you [add the new token to MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-add-unlisted-tokens-custom-tokens-in-MetaMask) if it isn't already there.

Palmer welcome to PaperclipDAO! üñá\n\nWe weighed several factors in making a final decision on which trade to accept. We care about more than just the economic value of a trade; we value the culture, story, and journey of the NFT as well. We also had to make a hard call about whether to honor the past or push towards the future. Our final poll after hours of discussion was a dead heat:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7af0279e-a154-4986-9893-743dee2c21c1.jpeg?height=756&width=1169)\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt easy, but we ultimately decided to go with a trade that highlighted the future of NFTs. \n\nPaperclipDAO now owns a 1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card, which can be used in [Parallel](https://www.parallel.life/), a sci-fi collectable game composed of digital collectible cards that can be combined into decks that dictate the game (think Magic at the Gathering or Pokemon). The Earthen Concept Art NFT was given only to early supporters of Parallel, and it's gratifying to see people taking the opportunity to recount [the NFT's unique history](https://twitter.com/GarretteDVF/status/1425657844414746629?s=20). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/69760d51-7aa0-4025-be9e-15367b4fee13.jpeg?height=1620&width=1080)\n\nIt‚Äôs a promising future for digitally scarce, playable cards, and since the purchase of these NFTs funds the development of the game itself, it also demonstrates the wide range of utility of NFTs. Who knows, maybe the team will let us bestow some magical paperclip power? üí´\n\nThis decision wasn‚Äôt easy; we were blown away by the offers we received and quickly realized that the hardest part would be parting with the incredible NFTs that we couldn‚Äôt accept. Check out the full [Round 1 offer thread](https://twitter.com/PaperclipDAO/status/1425117547251343369) to see all the amazing offers. \n\nGiven the quick turnaround, we only have time to highlight a few of our favorites. In no particular order, here is our homage to the ones that got away in Round 1: \n\n- Our very first offer came from JPG‚Äôs [Maria Paula Fernandez](https://twitter.com/MPtherealMVP/status/1425118535857156101), who just plain got it and proposed a trade for [simulacra](https://opensea.io/assets/0x8644053aadb0df38e7734f5010fef643316bbb92/28) before we had explained the project at all. Legend.  \n- Adam Cochran offered this [Cool Cat](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425206741084610566), complete with sunglasses and a great story. As competition heated up, he increased the offer to [4 Cool Cats](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425249645253496832). Adam later put forth an offer that absolutely blew his first two away! [He proposed a collection of 14 historic NFTs](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425487421895057408), in a collection titled Moments in Our History. This collection represents unique fists, influential artists, and rare defunct collectibles that helped shape the NFT space and have led to the NFT renaissance we're living right now. It‚Äôs an excellent read.\n- [A $HASH of the @paperclipDAO UNIv3 NFT](https://twitter.com/blasteasy/status/1425181303767543815) was also minted and proposed. Proof of Beauty is stunning. Just look at them. And to honor our project with a mint of the $PAPER/$CLIP NFT floored us. [Sisyphus](https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus) also offered [an original Proof of Beauty](https://opensea.io/assets/0xe18a32192ed95b0fe9d70d19e5025f103475d7ba/57896044618658097711785492504343953927315557066662158946655541218820101244980), for Beeple's first Everydays mint on-chain in another historic NFT moment offered for the first trade. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/826bf6cf-b6d7-420c-bade-3d6420592cfa.jpeg?height=1800&width=1125)\n\n- [MoonCatRescue](https://mooncatrescue.com/) is absolutely one of the great NFT stories, with a community rediscovering and rescuing these Mooncats that have been ‚Äútrapped‚Äù since the project began in 2017 (!!!). No way to do it justice here--[you have to read about it](https://mooncatrescue.com/).

{"id": "PBaDNs0M10r7WsMOYpZlS9SXbM3nOD3ewYh32yF3Tzo", "title": "Tutorial: How to Swap on Uniswap (Optimism)", "body": "## What is Uniswap? ü¶Ñ\n[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol for pooling liquidity and trading ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. Uniswap removes the need for trusted intermediaries when exchanging assets via its automated market maker (AMM) model. This means anyone can permissionlessly trade any ERC-20 token using the Uniswap protocol 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \n\nAs the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) in DeFi, Uniswap has facilitated over $300 billion of trading volume since inception. It is essential economic machinery, enabling peer-to-peer value transfer across all of Web3. \n\n## What is Optimism? ‚õìÔ∏è\n[Optimism](https://optimism.io/) is an EVM-compatible Optimistic Rollup chain that is designed to be a fast, simple, and secure scaling solution for Ethereum. \n\nOptimism is a glimpse into what the future of Ethereum has in store for us. Transactions are nearly instant and gas fees are negligible. For newer entrants to DeFi, Layer 2 solutions like Optimism allows experimentation with protocols such as Uniswap with minimal transaction costs. \n\n## Uniswap x Optimism Swap Tutorial üìö\n\nIn this tutorial, we‚Äôll walkthrough how to perform a simple token swap using Uniswap on the Optimism network.\n\n### First, you‚Äôll need to set up your MetaMask for Optimism. \n- Login to MetaMask on your browser and click on **‚ÄòEthereum Mainnet‚Äô**.\n- From the dropdown, select **‚ÄòCustom RPC‚Äô**.\n- Enter the following information into the available fields:\n     - **Network Name:** Optimism\n     - **New RPC URL:** https://mainnet.optimism.io \n     - **ChainID:** 10\n     - **Symbol:** ETH\n     - **Block Explorer URL:** https://optimistic.etherscan.io \n- Click **‚ÄòSave‚Äô**.\n\n### Next, bridge some assets from the Ethereum Mainnet to Optimism.\n- Go to https://gateway.optimism.io/welcome?chainId=1 and connect your MetaMask wallet. Make sure you are currently connected to the Ethereum Mainnet by selecting it from the network dropdown list in MetaMask (the same list where you found **‚ÄòCustom RPC‚Äô** earlier).\n- Once connected, select the token you would like to transfer to Optimism and the token you would like to receive on Optimism from the dropdown menus. Then, enter the amount you would like to transfer.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a2bfb32e-c9fd-45a6-90b4-fe13c520e25b.jpeg?height=532&width=489)\n\n- Click **‚ÄòDeposit‚Äô** and follow the prompts, confirming the transaction on MetaMask. \n- Shortly after confirmation on Ethereum, your assets will arrive on the Optimism network. You can check this by switching back to the Optimism network in MetaMask and verifying the tokens are in your wallet (Note: if you don't see your assets, try [adding the token to MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-add-unlisted-tokens-custom-tokens-in-MetaMask)).\n\n### Now, it's time to swap some tokens. \n- Head over to https://uniswap.org/ and click the **‚ÄòLaunch App‚Äô** button in the top-right corner.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e980a64d-7159-4014-a259-41879e64fd52.jpeg?height=570&width=1885)\n\n\n- If you haven‚Äôt already, switch over to the Optimism network in MetaMask. You can confirm that you are correctly connected by verifying that it says 'Optimism' in the upper right corner of the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/83c774d1-6d8c-4996-a714-d635a11a69e7.jpeg?height=65&width=461)\n\n- Select the assets you would like to swap to and from, and fill in the desired amount.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8effb663-0b0b-4b96-b092-3859ee6c0be9.jpeg?height=449&width=489)\n\n- Once you are ready to swap, select **‚ÄòAllow the Uniswap Protocol to use your X‚Äô** and confirm the transaction in MetaMask. This will allow Uniswap to spend your tokens during the swap. \n- Finally, hit **‚ÄòSwap‚Äô**. You will be asked to verify the details one more time. After verifying, click **'Confirm Swap'** and approve the transaction in MetaMask. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/50da480f-fbd0-4bf8-a196-a0fbd952a28b.jpeg?height=533&width=406)\n\n\n### Congratulations! ü•≥ \n\nYou have performed your first swap using Uniswap on Optimism. Make sure you [add the new token to MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-add-unlisted-tokens-custom-tokens-in-MetaMask) if it isn't already there. After a few minutes, you should see the correct balance in your wallet.\n\nYou've now successfully executed a permissionless exchange of crypto assets through Uniswap on one of the most advanced Ethereum scaling solutions available. \n\nWhat skill will you level up next on your web3 journey? üêáüï≥Ô∏è\n\n", "timestamp": 1628838853, "digest": "7DIcL9hHGE99cspKGdbHKtqLLoiRzddIv_vXZrTYeao", "contributor": "0xC714a62A4BF7ff475C8dc3E589e1388342A38BB8"}

Here‚Äôs a taste of what to expect: \n\n- Main Event w/ Harrison $FIRST;\n- Scavenger Hunt for a special prize;\n- Trivia Games;\n- Giveaways & Airdrops;\n- ... and much more!\n\nTo get access to all of the fun, make sure you reserve your ticket below! \n\nIf you select \"Pledge and Receive the tokens\" you will need a minimum of 20 $FFPARTY tokens in order to join the main event.\n\nThe NFT edition round will be available until **Friday 13th, 8AM PST**, or until the stretch goal is reached. \n\n[Forefront 1 \"The Ticket\"](edition://0xEF3c951e22c65F6256746F4e227e19A5BcbF393C?editionId=17&version=crowdfund_1)\n\nAs the metaverse evolves, Forefront will too, reshaping our digital landscape.

It sounds like Cat & Alpha have collected a second Capsule. \n\nYou also learnt of The Prophecy Of The Elektra from Godina, who said they had ‚Äúa vision that brave warriors from a space unknown will appear out of a portal‚Äù. It sounds like that's referring to us... \n\nBut how are we supposed to save Elektra? And how do we avoid ending up like the fallen warrior we just discovered?\n\nYou and the other travellers finally enter the destroyed city gates of Edin Prodo. You can sense that the energy here is different. Night has fallen, and sounds of distant rumbling creep into your ears ‚Äî as if little earthquakes are shaking Elektra some miles away. \n\nYou see something glimmering softly in the distance.. another log device! The third one you've discovered. \n\nJust like [Log 1](https://zora.co/songcamp/4176) and [Log 2](https://zora.co/songcamp/4280), this one also has a recent message on it - recorded just 34 minutes ago. \n\nYou press play...\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/4435)\n\nYou can collect this 1/1 NFT by bidding on Zora: https://zora.co/songcamp/4435\n\nCollecting this 1/1 NFT also includes:\n* A gift of 1000 $ELEKTRA\n* Access to the ELEKTRA interactive web3 game on Discord\n* One (1) invitation to Songcamp's Patron House -- a dedicated space for patrons of 1/1 Songcamp NFTs to receive deep + intimate access into the growing Songcamp community and activities.\n\n***Jump into the [Elektra Discord interactive game](https://elektra.camp/#/) to unlock the full audio story of Cat & Alpha as they journey with you through Elektra.***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f9a97259-0279-4f2f-b87d-c841ff346c10.png?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n## *Descent To The Core* is the result of collective creation within Songcamp Elektra\n\nElektra is the second experiment powered by *Songcamp* ‚Äî a web3 community interested in exploring at the edges of where music meets the new internet.\n\nThe audio-visual artwork for Log 3 was created by two teams within the Elektra camp ‚Äî the Visual Sqaud and The Swarm.
