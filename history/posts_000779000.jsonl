I block every social media advertisement that I come across, even if they’re targeting algorithm is extremely accurate.\n\n(I apologize for those whose careers are in advertising. I hate the game not the players—get your daily bread.)\n\nDigital ads are avoidable, but in the meatverse you can’t block ads. You’re all but forced to see what people pay to have you see. Your visual and mental bandwidth have a monetary value, and while I see the economic value in it; I believe that it has been over-saturated and perverted.\n\nShouldn’t the ad space you’re subjected to be a reflection of your community, be visually pleasing or, at the very least, be worth looking at again because you gain something from it? Maybe that’s just me.\n\n“*No it’s not just you, Tunacandrew!”*\n\nPhew! Okay, then let’s continue.\n\n### So what then?\n\nSo what you ask? Well, I’m introducing myself as Player ~~2 3 4~~ X. I want to bring community, art, stories, and NFTs to the real-world advertising space. I have selected a specific ad medium that suits all of these desires well and am working on an NFT project to act as a vehicle for it. In practice it will look like this:\n\nYou see the NFT while out at and about and, if you so choose, can collect it and support the project/artist via a QR code that directs you to the minting site.\n\nIt brings the NFT offline. Your first interaction isn’t through a crypto twitter shill or drop announcement 5 hours late because you live in a different time zone. You walk/drive/bike by and it naturally draws you in as art or literature SHOULD.\n\nThis project is in its infancy. As of right now it is a solo ordeal. I’m teaching myself 3D modeling and some coding to get this started so forgive me for holding all of my cards close to my chest. As the project develops I will be certain to reveal more information and bring in those well-suited to assist me in implementing this.\n\n### What comes next?\n\nHere is a list of what I believe are the next steps for this project to gain speed. (subject to change and not particularly in order)\n\n* Build up 3D modeling skills\n* Create rendered prototypes\n* Write story\n* Get a segment of aforementioned story illustrated for prototype\n* Debut prototype on Mirror\n* Crowdfund for ad space purchasing/minting costs/further illustration costs\n* Get entire story illustrated\n* Launch story in both meat and metaverses\n* Reach out to artists for collaborations\n* Grow and flourish\n* *Rent a blimp by end of year 1?*\n\nI’m excited. Diving headfirst into Web3.\n\n\\-Tunacandrew\n\nHave a song :)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfLiX4TX4PA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfLiX4TX4PA)\n\n", "timestamp": 1632847604, "digest": "QaWp4KQqnEqAySH7hMeLe_7hId-3wOMBSkjzkFv6jCs", "contributor": "0x2bA7EF752b2724cd5baB9bE5527118f3532Ff381"}

Party Splits let you start a party and grant a portion of the fractional tokens to any address you choose.\n\nThough it’s a simple primitive, this feature can be used in a variety of ways.\n\n1. DAO Treasuries: Anyone can start a party and direct a percentage of the fractional tokens to the address of a DAO treasury.  This can serve as a recurring funding model for DAOs collecting NFTs via PartyBid.\n2. Community Organizers: A community organizer who coordinates a group of people around a party can set this percentage as a hosting fee for themselves.\n3. Creators and collectors: A seller of an NFT can use this feature to retain a percentage of the work after selling it via auction.\n\nWith Party Splits now live, we’re excited to have a new way of aligning incentives between the various stakeholders using the PartyBid protocol.\n\n### Additional updates\n\nWe’ve also been working on some other changes that are now live.\n\nFirst, PartyBid now has a new fee model. Thus far, PartyBid has had a simple fee structure where 5% of the ETH used in all winning bids was sent to the PartyDAO treasury. Moving forward, PartyBid is modifying this fee structure to accept a combination of ETH and tokens instead.\n\nStarting today, the PartyBid fee is 2.5% of the ETH used in winning bids, and 2.5% of the fractional tokens created when a Party wins an auction. Though this fee change is simple, we think it sets up some big advantages for PartyDAO and PartyBid users:\n\n1. A lower ETH fee means it will be easier and cheaper for parties to win auctions.\n2. By owning tokens in all NFTs won via PartyBid, PartyDAO is aligned with users. PartyDAO's success is directly tied to the success of parties that win auctions on the protocol.\n3. Because PartyDAO is taking fees in a combination of ETH *and* tokens, PartyDAO will be set up to provide liquidity for fractional tokens won via PartyBid, providing a much smoother experience for PartyBid users.\n\nNext, we’ve updated the way reserve prices are set post-auction. After a party wins an auction, the default reserve price will now be set to 2x the price of the winning bid, instead of the previous 1x. This helps parties avoid unintentional buyout scenarios before token holders have had a chance to vote. As people claim their tokens and vote on the new reserve price, it will be free to move above or below this default starting price.\n\nFinally, we’ve also made some updates to the PartyBid web interface. Our post-auction Party page has a fresh coat of paint, with an emphasis on making it easy to understand what to do once a Party wins an auction. In addition to displaying the new reserve price on Fractional, we’ve included a video tutorial demonstrating how to vote using your tokens, and a button for adding tokens to MetaMask in one click.\n\n![ \\\\n ](https://twitter.com/prtyDAO)\n\n", "timestamp": 1632853930, "digest": "I6UnXzMXiL5Tb4gwLsScSZUlZ0ZtL4w043nKdyqMq0U", "contributor": "0xB0623C91c65621df716aB8aFE5f66656B21A9108"}

John Perry Barlow is about to declare, “The internet consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself” ([1](https://www.eff.org/de/cyberspace-independence)).\n\nFrom the vantage point of today’s web, someone might argue that only the first part of Barlow’s statement is correct. The spectacle surrounding digital assets suggests that we’ve reached a new level of financialization, continuing a trajectory in which more of our actions online become direct economic interactions. While blockchain-based digital assets are amenable to speculative financial markets, they are not the only application of the technology. During this crest of the hype cycle, we could see relationships forged by new peer-to-peer institutions take root underneath.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/38e90c0a-c2e5-4d73-bcac-daf0bb452bec.jpg?height=1176&width=2330)\n\nOne of the first core applications of public blockchains is global digital assets. Global in the sense that they do not rely on institutions to prove they are not being [double spent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending): the mystical cat on the moon NFT is, verifiably, the only mystical cat on the moon NFT corresponding to its token. The utility of provable uniqueness extends to types of relations beyond direct economic exchange as well, which has led many people to think as much about new forms of finance as about new forms of organizations.\n\nYet the promise of new forms of organizations aided by information technology cannot be separated from the context of the internet’s invention. In 1995, a year before John Perry Barlow’s [Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/de/cyberspace-independence), another written work that would impact the political ideology of the early internet appeared: [Tribes, Institutions, Markets, Networks (TIMN)](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf) by David Ronfeldt. The TIMN report was funded by the RAND Corporation. Darkly parodied in *Dr. Strangelove* as the BLAND Corporation, it is a non-profit, research and development think tank founded in 1948, which is responsible for informing the policies of the United States military, government, and industry to the present day. Because the internet begins amidst this militarized context, we will start here too ([2](https://www.rand.org/about/history/baran.list.html)).\n\nThe TIMN report creates a narrative of societal evolution in which humans have progressed through four distinct organizational forms:\n\n![(T) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ccfc3b17-2054-4305-b705-bd23ec2e5598.png?height=1076&width=1872)\n\nWhile new organizational forms evolve over time, preceding organizational forms “grow within their scope of activity, even though that scope is newly circumscribed”, citing how markets increased tax revenues to bolster the institutional state despite curtailing its participation in direct economic exchange in other respects ([3](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)).\n\n![Sam Hart, Laura Lotti, Toby Shorin, ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/80498627-0fad-4e56-9afe-848f8f50a539.png?height=1640&width=2798)\n\nThe report’s institutional biases are clear, such as equating progress with Western liberal democracy, and its narrative of societal evolution may appear reductive at best. Its argument, however, provides an historical background to the political ideology from which decentralized organizations draw, knowingly or not. This is most apparent in the report’s identification of the newest organizational form: networks.\n\nThe report defines networks somewhat open-endedly. A key distinguishing feature between networks and the organizational forms preceding them is that networks are described as ***multi-organizational***, emphasizing collaboration between “small, scattered, and autonomous” groups over larger distances. These groups do not necessarily share a distinct organizational unity. While networks have existed throughout history, new information technology emphasizes cooperative relations that greatly impact institutions, through cutting across jurisdictions, and through markets, “facilitating the growth of [keiretsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu) and other distributed, web-like global enterprises and, increasingly, so-called ‘virtual corporations’”, Ronfeldt notes ([4](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)). Yet multi-organizational networks’ primary domain is neither the public nor private sector, at least as both are traditionally conceived. Instead, they will most transform a third, “autonomous social sector” (5), identified in the report as civil society. Painted in the 1995 landscape to include non-governmental organizations (NGOs), grassroots organizations, and private voluntary organizations, civil society will be strengthened by multi-organizational networks and perhaps address issues surrounding inequality, bureaucracy, and accessibility where preceding organizational forms failed.\n\nThe report presents a saccharine political image of networks: “While the development of the institutional and market forms of organization led to an emphasis on competitive advantages, development of the multi-organizational network form may shift the emphasis to cooperative advantages” ([6](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)). The underside of this political presentation is the imperial soft power NGOs would globally export in the following decade. For those currently working on web3, all of this language may feel familiar, although this questionable ideological inheritance often goes unremarked ([7](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703983004575073911147404540)).\n\nWith the report’s final emphasis on civil society’s three letter acronyms for organizations, NGOs, NPOs, and PVOs, a future one is naturally missing: DAOs.\n\n## A Chimeric Term\n\nDAO stands for *decentralized autonomous organization*.\n\nDAO comes from imagining how features of decentralized technology, such as global digital assets, censorship resistance, and automated actions, will change how organizations operate. Initially called *[decentralized autonomous corporations](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i-1379644274)* (DACs), the more generalizable term DAO emerged from the Ethereum blockchain community. Based on Vitalik Buterin’s [DAOs, DACs, DAs and More: An Incomplete Terminology Guide](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/) from 2014, a DAO could be described then as a capitalized organization in which a software protocol informs its operation, placing automation at its center and humans at its edges. For example, a software protocol could specify the conditions upon which an organization automatically distributes capital to its members. This led to the idea that organizational values could be automated and executed by code, a lingering idea that perhaps falsely suggests [tacit knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge) can be fully expressed in a software protocol. While the term’s hypothetical ideas abounded, by the time a DAO went from theory into experiment, the community largely reframed the term DAO to indicate “unstoppable”, or censorship-resistant, businesses. The first DAO, called [The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)), became one of the biggest spectacles in the Ethereum blockchain community to date when in 2016 it raised over $150m equivalent in ETH as a decentralized venture fund (8). However, the experiment proved short-lived when The DAO was hacked one month after launch.\n\nIt was not until several years later that larger initiatives related to DAOs gained traction again. From then until now, DAO has strayed from its initial signifiers to continue as a chimeric term, with both the term and its implementations varying depending on its cultural context. Each speculative run in the market, for all its noise, creates new signals of what DAOs can be deployed towards, bringing descriptive, technical, and cultural refinement to the concept in practice. While some quip that a [group splitting a lunch bill](https://twitter.com/DnlKlr/status/1398219740489859073) may be a DAO, in order to avoid its overgeneralization ([9](https://j.mirror.xyz/RUeJfZEZxr-hkuzUCakQyUuf2kOJVMPPiAWBaQFhhqc)), DAOs will be circumscribed here to focus on examples in the Ethereum blockchain community, despite the importance of other [communities similarly coordinating](https://twitter.com/helveticade/status/1400946733249662978). In 2021, a DAO could be described as a voluntary association with the operating principles of digital cooperativism. As voluntary associations, they are a cross-jurisdictional way for strangers, friends, or unlikely allies to pseudonymously come together toward common goals, supported by a token model, incentives, and governance. Members of a DAO can have representative ownership of its digital assets through a token, which often simultaneously acts as a governance right.\n\nAlthough many DAOs would not embrace the label of digital cooperative, one could say DAOs embrace cooperativism as a *protocol*, meaning an evolving set of relational practices that are distinct from traditional corporate structures or decentralized autonomous corporations, because they prioritize member ownership. The label cooperative is further qualified here by digital because today DAOs act primarily to coordinate around digital assets. However, as the concept of DAOs evolves in practice, [its digital primacy will fade](https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3). DAOs, as we will see, also introduce new dimensions that exceed what the operating principles of a digital cooperative notionally encompass.\n\n[https://twitter.com/evabeylin/status/1396184123761303554](https://twitter.com/evabeylin/status/1396184123761303554)\n\nDecentralized technology ecosystems tend to describe a phenomenon through its technical products. Yet as Ruth Catlow, co-founder of Furtherfield and DECAL decentralized arts lab, notes, “We need to be building cultures before structures” ([10](https://so-far.online/many-headed-hydras/)). While the overview below of DAO tools provides a concrete description of the concept in practice, it feels critical to keep in mind that DAOs ultimately coordinate through collective vibes.\n\n![DAO Starter Pack, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b277c810-3d61-4766-979c-af9d8b063e7e.png?height=1350&width=2400)\n\nIn its simplest form, DAO tools have been described as a group chat and a bank account ([11](https://www.patreon.com/posts/wyoming-dao-bill-51387956)). In 2021, this generally takes the form of a Discord server and a [Gnosis Safe Multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/), which is a web3 platform for creating [multi-signature accounts](https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e). Multi-signature accounts allow pseudonymous groups, across jurisdictions, to pool and manage funds within minutes, a capacity far beyond a [traditional joint bank account](https://twitter.com/ctbeiser/status/1399196774967898113). This “minimum viable” DAO, or MVD, tooling shone in the first half of 2021 with initiatives like PleasrDAO.\n\n[PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/pleasrdao?lang=de) is a collective that came together to bid on an NFT by the artist [pplpleasr](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr). Given escalating NFT digital art auction prices, the idea behind PleasrDAO was simple: a collective of fans using a multi-signature account could pool funds to place bids, and through holding in common, compete with other major bidders to win the auction. After winning their first eponymous auction, PleasrDAO went on to collect other works such as [Stay Free](https://foundation.app/Snowden/stay-free-edward-snowden-2021-24437), the NFT by Edward Snowden charitably supporting independent press, for a total of 2.2K ETH or USD 5.4 Million equivalent at the time. Their repeatedly successful missions means that while still acting as collectors, PleasrDAO will [broaden their scope](https://decrypt.co/66933/why-this-dao-bought-snowden-nft) to begin incubating projects by their community. Initiatives like PleasrDAO most promisingly challenge institutional collectors through their expanded membership, inviting artists they collect like pplpleasr to become members of the collective in turn.\n\n![Gnosis Safe multi-signature account owned by PleasrDAO, in which they hold collected NFTs in common.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9904c31-747e-4b83-aee1-0a2208b1f338.png?height=1800&width=2880)\n\nThough a group chat and multi-signature account may be enough to initialize a DAO mission, a token often becomes the next step toward embracing the principles of a digital cooperative. For example, PleasrDAO issued $PEEPS, a token distributed internally to represent members’ stake in the collection ([12](https://foundation.app/blog/pleasrdao)), which they are considering making public to fractionalize ownership of their collection. Similar experiments like [PartyDAO](https://twitter.com/prtydao?lang=de) employ a token, with the $PARTY token representing membership to a group chat, governance rights, and co-ownership of productive value managed by the DAO. It’s important to note PleasrDAO and PartyDAO are not flat hierarchies, as they both have elected groups of individuals that manage their multi-signature account treasuries. Though PleasrDAO and PartyDAO focused on shorter missions initially, they are both evolving toward a longer term vision, as collectors, investors, and incubators that use tokens to represent co-ownership in the spirit of a digital cooperative. Tokenization creates both opportunities and challenges for the networks to come.\n\n### A New Dimension in the Cooperative Movement\n\nReturning to their origin, DAOs today resemble *The* *DAO* in their emphasis on open participation and economic value creation, while their culture has shifted more toward specific niches and social connection. In the examples above, one term has been left intentionally vague: governance. Many DAOs today use the lightweight [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) platform for governance ([13](https://deepdao.io/#/deepdao/dashboard)). On Snapshot, DAOs each have a space to create and vote on proposals. For example, both [PleasrDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/pleasrdao.eth) and [PartyDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/partydao.eth) have a Snapshot space, on which they hold public votes for collective decisions. Snapshot weights votes by the amount of DAO-specific tokens an address holds, such as $PEEPS tokens in PleasrDAO.\n\n![PleasrDAO Snapshot space displaying the vote on whether to acquire the ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f09da5e4-c7e9-4dd4-b736-f6a504f02606.png?height=1800&width=2880)\n\nThe [topic of governance](https://technosphere-magazine.hkw.de/p/The-Byzantine-Generalization-Problem-Subtle-Strategy-in-the-Context-of-Blockchain-Governance-8UNNcM8VShTpBGWRuob1GP) has its own history within the crypto ecosystem that won’t be fully expounded upon here. Notably the initiative [MolochDAO](https://www.molochdao.com/), which uses the classic font Papyrus and heavily references gaming guilds, rekindled the fire of decentralized governance after The DAO hack. MolochDAO went on to inspire a legion of new DAOs, many direct forks, in its wake.\n\n[https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1399411511869665285](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1399411511869665285)\n\nThis essay’s history of DAOs is far from complete, as other projects like [Aragon](https://aragon.org/), [Colony](https://colony.io), [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/), and [DAOstack](https://daostack.io/) continue to develop their platforms for DAOs and modular initiatives like [Block Science](https://block.science/) and [Commons Stack](https://commonsstack.org/) arise. These projects offer DAO tools supporting many [governance mechanisms](https://blog.gnosis.pm/a-brief-discussion-of-the-protocol-governing-the-dxdao-7331407a2555). However, a prehistory of DAOs is also incomplete without its less frequently mentioned relation to platform cooperativism.\n\nBuilding on decades of commons initiatives, the term “platform cooperativism” coined by Trebor Scholz as well as the concept “[exit to community](https://hackernoon.com/startups-need-a-new-option-exit-to-community-ig12v2z73)” outlined by Nathan Schneider have intersected with the crypto space through essays like Jesse Walden’s [The Ownership Economy](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/). These catchphrases advocate for platforms owned, developed, and stewarded by their community of users. Specifically, the concept “exit to community” influenced decentralized governance through its clear exposition of a third way for companies to evolve their ownership.\n\n![Nathan Schneider, ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d14efc42-4c3c-4e7b-a6c9-b760a118e7c5.jpeg?height=579&width=1159)\n\nExit to community grew in practice through initiatives such as [DXdao](https://twitter.com/dxdao_?lang=de), which launched with the aim to give community ownership, governance, and value to software protocols. Today, with many decentralized finance software protocols guiding their development through DAOs, it's become clear that software protocols can both exit to, and [build with community](https://twitter.com/VENTURE_DAO/status/1395544596550062080). Because DAOs use early stage software tools, it makes sense that their first users and use cases would involve the governance of digital assets, such as software protocols. DAOs’ digital primacy is perhaps one reason that their resemblance to earlier cooperative movements often goes unremarked.\n\nToday, the International Cooperative Alliance defines cooperatives as “an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise” ([14](https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity)). A cooperative can also be defined by the structure of its legal entity, which dictates that cooperatives are companies not owned by shareholders but by their members. A key moment in the history of cooperatives was the establishment of the [Rochdale Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles), formulated by a society of weavers in 1844. The International Cooperative Alliance adopted these operating principles, which still guide cooperatives globally:\n\n1. Voluntary and Open Membership\n2. Democratic Member Control\n3. Member Economic Participation\n4. Autonomy and Independence\n5. Education, Training, and Information\n6. Cooperation among Cooperatives\n7. Concern for Community\n\nWhile these operating principles have evolved over the last two centuries, they could easily have been formulated by a DAO today. The principles of Voluntary and Open Membership, Member Economic Participation, and Concern for Community translate to the examples of DAOs above. The principles of Autonomy and Independence and Cooperation among Cooperatives are key for DAOs to flourish as multi-organizational networks, strengthening an autonomous social sector built through cross-DAO collaboration.\n\nDAOs could set more thoughtful norms around democratic member control, which cooperatives typically define as one member, one vote. Most DAOs employ token voting, that is, one token, one vote. DAOs reason that token ownership represents stakeholdership, with the token model often directly economically tied to the DAO, for example through fees on software protocols it owns. This allows DAO members with greater financial stake to have proportionally greater influence. Token voting does not directly contradict cooperative principles, as there are some cooperatives that weight votes by qualities such as production ([15](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3356774)). In certain cases this may feel apt, but as some DAOs evolve toward maintaining basic infrastructure such inequality becomes undesirable. This is in part because not all stakeholders have the purchasing power representative of their stake, and their practical knowledge may be excluded from governance.\n\nProjects such as Tornado Cash privacy protocol have approached this distribution problem by retroactively sending tokens to prior users, in a step toward making users stakeholders of the protocol ([16](https://tornado-cash.medium.com/tornado-cash-governance-proposal-a55c5c7d0703)). The [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/) project, a public blockchain for ecosystem services, takes another approach to this distribution problem. They have set aside 30% of their tokens for land stewards, climate scientists, and other stakeholders in regenerative land management to form [community DAOs](https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3) that participate in network governance. Because tokens can be distributed more easily than traditional corporate interests, memberships, or shares, this creates the possibility for a new form of token holder company, which can incorporate deeper practical knowledge in governance without increasing operational transaction costs. Stakeholders with practical knowledge, or [“tacit” knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge), like land stewards in the case of Regen Network, benefit governance by incorporating informal practices in decision making. Here, DAOs begin to introduce new dimensions that exceed what the operating principles of a digital cooperative notionally encompass. For this reason, as much innovation and emphasis should be placed on token distribution mechanisms that identify broader stakeholder participation as on decision making mechanisms.\n\nThe tokenization of online communities could be the subject of a longer debate. Far from the best answer to the social media woes of web 2.0, tokenization introduces more financialized relations. As a guiding star, web3 applications could aim to introduce value in relations which have been historically denied it, such as labor and environment, rather than creating new financialized relations. In this context, for DAOs with the mission of economic value creation, a token becomes a useful mechanism on three fronts:\n\n1. Bootstrapping Funding\n2. Distributing Governance Rights\n3. Aligning Ecosystem of DAOs\n\nTokenization introduces a powerful cultural norm into early stage organizations: the expectation of transparent co-ownership of its assets *from the start*. The tension between more traditional corporate structures that pay dividends and DAOs persists ([17](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)). Because most DAOs represent governance rights through a token, in some sense tokens Trojan horse principles of cooperatives directly into highly financialized spaces. These are two important sides of, quite literally, one coin, and for this reason, tokenization should not be dismissed. Tokens may be one key to unlock the ownership economy, but to reach a more equitable version of this future, we must participate in crafting the culture around token distribution, mediation, and governance now. This becomes important because, unlike shares in cooperatives, many tokens that double as governance rights can be sold on secondary markets. While this makes the conditions for entrance into an organization easier, DAOs can learn from cooperatives’ emphasis on long termism, through establishing more cultural patterns around token vesting, limited transferability, or more experimental mechanisms.\n\nJust as DAOs can learn from case studies of cooperatives, in a two-way exchange DAOs could introduce more forms of decentralized governance into cooperatives. This is the case made by Morshed Mannan in [Fostering Worker Cooperatives with Blockchain Technology: Lessons from the Colony Project](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3356774), which cites how cooperatives often face “coordination problems as the entity scales across borders,” with a “negative trend in participatory management, mutual monitoring, and solidarity” as they internationalize. Dilemmas that cooperatives face, such as funding, governance, and alignment across jurisdictions, DAOs directly address. Embracing cooperativism as a *protocol* rather than as a corporate structure, in their neologism, DAOs could encourage a cultural space that can be crafted beyond traditional divisions.\n\n## The Guilded Age\n\n[https://twitter.com/karakittel/status/1404510598033985548](https://twitter.com/karakittel/status/1404510598033985548)\n\nAs much as DAOs may accidentally embrace the operating principles of cooperatives preceding them, they also slyly resemble enclaves from other online cultures. They have the most to learn from guilds in massively multiplayer online games (MMOs).\n\nAs role playing computer games went online in the 1990s, this meant large numbers of players could share in one game world: an environment with a diverse array of objectives, activities, and subplots. Early integral examples of MMOs include The Realm Online, Ultima Online, and EverQuest, which lead to more classics like World of Warcraft and EVE Online. In many of these examples, players are mostly free to set their own goals loosely guided by the open game world narrative, affordances, and risks ([18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_game)), and because of this narrative freedom, players form groups to accomplish common goals out of the reach of single players. Referred to broadly as guilds, clans, or alliances, these groups can range from 40 to 1000 participants, and their goals could include defeating difficult enemies or constructing useful tools.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, cultural patterns emerge in guilds, and there can sometimes be a mismatch between the tools game world developers release for guilds and their actual needs. In an example from EVE Online, the game world developers created an interface for players to create corporations that allowed players to distribute shares. In practice, this feature to distribute shares was rarely used because it did not enhance existing cultural patterns. Instead, using EVE Online’s in-game browser and data API, many guilds developed their own tools needed to accomplish goals (19). A parallel between gaming guilds and DAOs could be drawn here, as the current wave of DAOs tend to use a combination of composable tools, such as bridging the Snapshot voting platform to a Gnosis Safe multi-signature account, rather than platforms which overly anticipate use cases for participants.\n\n[https://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1386007400033959938](https://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1386007400033959938)\n\nThough the specific feature to distribute corporate shares may not have taken off in EVE Online, gaming guilds frequently embrace economic practices of redistribution. The vast importance of MMO marketplaces, from [Varrock](https://runescape.salmoneus.net/archived-projects-and-content/site-content/tips/world-1-trading.html) to [gold farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming), for decentralized finance will be the subject of a later essay, but one economic practice may be keenly relevant for DAOs: Dragon-kill points (DKP). Taking their name historically from when dragons were the most frequently encountered enemies in MMOs, DKP emerged as an allocation system within and sometimes across guilds.\n\nComplex, sustained missions undertaken by guilds, such as killing a dragon, are usually referred to as raids, and can range in length from several hours to several days. At the end of a raid, the slain enemy drops in-game items called loot, and guilds must decide how to distribute it. Because guilds require diverse and complementary player skill sets over extended time periods, “It matters that the same people work together again” ([20](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945)) and the perceived fairness of often-scarce loot distribution is critical for this. As guilds grow in maturity, they often evolve different systems of loot distribution, for example beginning with random distribution, moving toward random distribution weighted by participation, and commonly arriving at distribution through an informal scoring system such as DKP. DKP act as a private money system, separate from any existing currency in a game world, and guild members earn them based on their participation in raids ([21](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945)). Guild members can then choose to spend these points in exchange for loot after a raid.\n\nInitially designed by a guild in 1999 for the EverQuest MMO, the [practice of DKP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_kill_points) has been embraced by many guilds across many game worlds, albeit with slight adjustments. Ed Castranova and Joshua Fairfield detailed one example in [Dragon Kill Points: A Summary Whitepaper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945): the Leftovers DKP system, which maximizes the number of participants by not being tied to one specific guild. As Castranova and Fairfield write, “Indeed, this organization is effectively the highest allocative body in the population. If there is an emergent government on \\[the World of Warcraft server\\] Silver Hand, it is The Leftovers.” The Leftovers DKP system arises from a few limitations: loot can only be picked up at the aftermath of battle and, in World of Warcraft, cannot be transferred between players. The Leftovers DKP system has a small group of informally appointed governors: players who laboriously, through public dialogue, set and maintain a database of loot item prices in DKP. When loot drops, players with DKP can choose to spend them for a specific item, with all bids and transactions public. Being zero sum, the Leftovers DKP system then equally distributes *spent* DKP points to all other guild members that participated in the raid.\n\nAs Castranova and Fairfield note, DKP supplements the existing currencies of a game world, as much for efficient allocation as for social cohesion, “making possible the exchange of time (spent on those raids in which an individual is not compensated) for goods (obtained on those raids in which an individual wins loot)” ([22](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945)). Especially in the case of World of Warcraft, because loot cannot be transferred between players, having loot itself also serves a strong signalling function, showing a player has meaningfully participated in raids over time. This DKP system precedes the mechanics of DAO platforms in development today, such as Aragon, Colony, and DAOstack, which all offer mechanisms to distribute reputational tokens based on the participation of members, rewarded for successful proposals, bounties, or campaigns: what might be called raids in other game worlds. These reputational tokens complement other economic systems enabled by DAO platforms, such as DAO-specific tokens or other assets in their multi-signature account treasuries. Often used as an alternative model to the plutocratic one token, one vote model, reputational tokens, earned through participation rather than purchasing power, provide greater voting power in DAOs that amasses over time. DAOs can learn from DKP, which in contrast, acts as a private money system based on participation that can be spent on other digital assets, instead of only amassing over time.\n\nIn addition to efficient allocation, contextual reputation, and signalling functions, the DKP system holds another significance for DAOs: generally all guilds resolve disputes independently from traditional court systems, despite these disputes involving expensive stakes. This becomes highly relevant for DAO tooling like Aragon’s digital jurisdictions or [Kleros](https://kleros.io/)’s decentralized arbitration service that aim to provide internet native dispute resolution tools. In fact, DAO tooling often tries to technically solve problems that gaming guilds have already culturally refined for several decades, and it may be time for DAOs and gaming guilds to merge their practical knowledge more closely.\n\n![A ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5504ac03-20c1-4dba-83a6-efda8d3a4077.jpg?height=806&width=1339)\n\nAnother subtle cultural pattern of gaming guilds relates to their articulated economic structure. As researcher Joshua Citarella points out, many DKP systems resemble a form of market socialism, in which goods are publicly owned but allocated by markets ([23](https://soundcloud.com/joshuacitarella/memes-as-politics-ep-13-dkp-is-market-socialism)). Citarella also goes on to note that despite the resemblance of DKP systems to market socialism, and the general happiness of players who participate in them, many of those players would decidedly not politically embrace the label market socialism. Shadow economics may be an apt term for when a group operates through an economic form it would not label itself as: DAOs as cooperative protocols and gaming guilds as market socialism. This tendency leaves interesting political territory like gaming guilds underexplored, because gaming guilds do not often need to wear their own flags. In one light, this could be more of a feature than a bug, as the invention of new terms like DAO, rather than reliance on canon, in part fuels their enthusiastic embrace.\n\n[https://twitter.com/TBSocialist/status/1402270439167037440](https://twitter.com/TBSocialist/status/1402270439167037440)\n\nWhile it may result in ignoring their prehistory, DAOs still retain a powerful ambiguity, in which their burgeoning political ambitions do not yet possess fully familiar aesthetic articulations. This could be co-opted toward several different ends. For example, one could imagine a DAO whose treasury self-destructs, [like terra0's NFT](https://terra0.medium.com/two-degrees-nft-5af1263bfcc), when global temperatures rise over 2 degrees Celsius, accompanied by a sparkly, unassuming mascot avatar.\n\nSuch a DAO might attract participation from those not drawn to the familiar green aesthetics of most climate initiatives, and it could have the effect of broadening participation in a political objective through creating new cultures around it. The momentum of the questionably new can always be good for something, and the question becomes how to cultivate DAOs that can build surreptitious solidarity across ideological divides.\n\n## A Constellation is Born\n\n![Actually, it might be.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/482156a6-7f32-475a-b467-0e0b8c4648c7.png?height=534&width=880)\n\nWhile a comprehensive prehistory of decentralized autonomous organizations could take us much further into the past ([24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_Saint_Benedict)), many proponents of DAOs have a core belief about their impact on the future: DAOs could out-compete by out-cooperating the modern firm.\n\nIn the twentieth century, many economists asked why companies arose when services priced by the market should, in theory, be more efficient. Ronald Coase explored the answer to this question in [The Nature of the Firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm), coming to the conclusion that markets create unaccounted for transaction costs. These transaction costs could arise from price discovery, contract negotiation, or onboarding for a service, which can be mitigated by retaining services in a company. Following from this theory, the size of firms may have practical limits they won’t exceed, because eventually transaction costs increase through developments like departmental bureaucracy. Though this theory has many critiques, the promise of DAOs can be positioned in relation to it: DAOs aspire to become *more* efficient as they scale ([25](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-daostack/blob/master/dxdao_whitepaper_v1.pdf)). While in practice this aspiration has been far from proven, in some respects the promise of DAOs lies in using technical governance protocols to reduce transaction costs. To return to an example above, DAO tooling like Gnosis Safe enables pseudonymous groups, across jurisdictions, to pool and manage funds within minutes. The equivalent process to establish a traditional joint bank account could take months, and in some cases, it wouldn’t be possible for individuals from different jurisdictions to jointly manage a bank account. Through the affordances of public blockchains, DAOs can incorporate deeper practical knowledge in governance without increasing operational transaction costs: aspiring to become more efficient as they scale.\n\nWhile DAO tooling like Gnosis Safe enables this today, overall, the promise of infinitely scalable organizations still has a long way to go. Often even the promise of DAOs can obscure their utility in practice. In [The Dissensus Protocol: Governing Differences in Online Peer Communities](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fhumd.2021.641731/full), Jaya Klara Brekke, Kate Beecroft, and Francesca Pick focus on a case study of the Genesis DAO, a collective centered around the DAOstack platform. They write:\n\n> The Genesis DAO is a good example of a unique trait common to many DAOs, namely, that they comprise highly motivated groups that have formed around a set of ideas about governance, rather than governance being a means in order to achieve some shared mission. In other words, it was tool-centric and focused on one main action: allocating funds to proposals. It is unusual for people who are strangers to start making financial decisions together immediately without having time to develop coherence and trust. And this was in fact the very promise of projects like the Genesis DAO: that the technology would bypass the need to develop trusted relationships, meaning thousands of people would be able to coalesce around objectives, take actions, and even spend money together as a group ([26](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fhumd.2021.641731/full)).\n\nMuch like the earlier example above of EVE Online players not using the interface to distribute corporate shares released by the game developers, tool-centric development, as well as the assumption that tools automatically create useful cultural patterns, must be reconsidered. Rather than technical protocols for governance that diminish the need for trusted relationships, DAOs can be approached through iteratively developing highly composable tools to coordinate across different levels of coherence and trust. Ultimately, the efficiency DAOs aspire to may not be defined as an economic function but as a matter of “better,” situated governance: one supported by deeper practical knowledge within an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games).\n\n## Layers of the DAO\n\nDAOs will not be the uniformly non-hierarchical networks some imagine. Instead, DAOs coordinate across different levels of coherence and trust. In [Ownership in Cryptonetworks](https://blog.curvelabs.eu/ownership-in-cryptonetworks-96f13f4a113e), Patrick Rawson argues that for DAOs, “distributing ownership to squadlike entities with more specialized objectives is the key long-term problem to solve” in order to enable meaningful work. These “squadlike entities” are smaller teams with trust relationships, perhaps not unlike the gaming guilds in the examples above, which execute on value aligned missions with DAOs. At a closer look, effective DAOs start behaving much more like networks of teams, like the [MONDRAGON Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) network with 100 affiliated cooperatives, rather than the loosely coordinated swarm intelligence that they might appear as from a distance. Inspired by Rawson’s analysis, we can roughly sketch three layers of a DAO:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e7260512-1458-4aac-bc0a-cbca9d6d532d.png?height=1202&width=2136)\n\n1. **Token**: Multi-organizational networks aligned by token ownership\n2. **Teams**: Teams, guilds, and squads represented by token ownership\n3. **Missions**: Missions, milestones, and raids financed by token ownership\n\nFrom these layers, a ***heterarchical*** network emerges, meaning an organization that possesses the ability to be ranked in multiple ways.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3aedd8d4-58c2-4273-bc91-3761d7f8a995.png?height=1982&width=3524)\n\nIn ecosystems that prioritize distributing ownership, tokens encourage DAO networks to be managed by their members. Tokens, teams, and missions are not confined to the quasi-institutional boundaries of a single DAO but can and, in order to meaningfully decentralize the control network, *should* be represented by token ownership in multiple DAOs. An ecosystem not unlike the control networks of transnational corporations emerges, but importantly, one without monocentric command and with reduced transaction costs across different levels of trust. As Rawson writes, “As long as the collective memory freely circulates within a given \\[DAO network\\], discovered solutions to problems can be reused.” When we view DAOs as multi-organizational networks aligned by token ownership, the purpose of DAO tooling becomes not only to support the operations of one team but to facilitate collaborations across many. Funded by PrimeDAO, [DAO-to-DAO (D2D) collaboration mechanisms](https://medium.com/primedao/exploring-dao2dao-collaboration-mechanisms-c37218a17a21) appear the most forward thinking work along these lines, which may eventually overtake traditional business-to-business (B2B) products. A new squadlike entity emerging from stealth mode, the [Gnosis Guild](https://twitter.com/gnosisguild?lang=de) team embraces a similar emphasis on DAO-to-DAO tools, with a new constellation of DAO tools called [Zodiac]().\n\nRevisiting the promise of DAOs, their potential to incorporate deeper practical knowledge in governance does not mean that decision making must involve an ever-larger number of members in every proposal, but rather that within a DAO network, teams who possess the most relevant expertise can easily share it with the ecosystem. When we view DAOs as constellations of teams, not monoliths, DAOs become networks to allow collective memory to flow freely.\n\n## The Networks to Come\n\nThe TIMN RAND report this essay began with closes on a curious note. It reads:\n\n> Much of the literature about redesigning organizations for the information-age focuses on production—on improving productivity, or manufacturing something new like the Boeing 777 jetliner. Yet, does this not reflect a lingering industrial-age mentality? Production organizations remain a crucial part of the organizational ecology. However, we should also be thinking about “sensory organizations.” Sensory functions are quite different from production functions, and require different modes of organization—e.g., more networks connected to the world outside an office’s boundaries. Determining appropriate designs for all manner of sensory organizations may become a good meta-theme for innovative research and development in the years ahead ([27](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)).\n\nThis closing sentiment echoes the popularity in that era of the twentieth century media theorist Marshall McLuhan, who emphasized how digital media impacts our sensory nervous systems. If digitally prime networks like DAOs operate on our nervous system first, it does not mean they won’t come to reorganize, reshape, and redistribute our material world. Some still refuse to take seriously the fact that cooperative principles, gaming guilds, and odd imaginaries like DAOs present an emergent organizational form with legitimate political relevance. We must take them politically seriously now, so that they don’t remain shaped only by those on one side of the digital divide. The days of DAOs versus [PACs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee), political action committees that fundraise for electoral candidates in the United States, will be with us soon. Just as markets did not make states obsolete, but diminished some of their operations while strengthening others, DAOs introduce new forms into traditional political participation that emerge from the autonomous social sector: [the network union](https://1729.com/network-union/).\n\n![Character from Trust’s ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f59011fe-b6aa-42e6-9344-daab85c5976a.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nTo call attention to the chimeric’s term failings at seriousness, many return to its misnomer: the “A” in DAO does not live up to its autonomous reference; while others like researcher [Aude Launay gracefully invoke](https://twitter.com/audelau/status/1413731529042321410) the political, rather than the technical, spirit of autonomy in DAOs. Even though the term DAO remains poetically correct, we could propose an occasional replacement: decentralized avatar organizations. Such organizations would take their political stakes both lightly and heavily. As poetitician and Digital Minister of Taiwan Audrey Tang notes, the days of avatar politicians are already here ([28](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/radical-transparency-humor-disinformation-poetry-for-machines-avatar-politicians-and-giving-non-human-entities-a-vote-with-digital-minister-of-taiwan-audrey-tang-X36XnWVg)). Avatar politicians are [virtual beings](https://www.virtual-beings-summit.com/) that represent, rally, and advocate on behalf of political platforms, and when automation increases, they may even spawn their own political platforms. A decentralized avatar organization would recognize the coming virtual zeitgeist: this could look like a [collectively managed cyborg](https://twitter.com/cjliu49/status/1345110226744184833) like [Lil Miquela](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Miquela) or an entire environment shaped by members, like [Trust’s moving castles](https://trust.support). Decentralized avatar organizations will have collectively developed, interoperable game worlds, engines, or virtual being mascots at their core, which co-creates the culture around which their members organize.\n\n![Jay Springett, ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6fa40349-2cd0-41c2-8680-ffde9154743b.png?height=1036&width=706)\n\nBy learning from their prehistory, DAOs can move towards a syncretic theory of organizations, meaning a theory which incorporates a wide range of cultural patterns, practices, and influences while recognizing its inherited political biases. To escape the tendency to fetishize technical protocols for governance, decentralized avatar organizations must cultivate compelling environments players want to inhabit, recognizing narratives, aesthetics, and goals held in common are key to their success. Making the internet a place not only for transactions but for relationships and thought itself, as Barlow wrote, relies on the depth of these narratives. As is the case with massively multiplayer online games, DAOs are less technical protocols for governance and more high stakes game worlds that interweave.\n\nWe should aim for rough consensus and running worlds.\n\n*This essay is the second in a [Gnosis Guild](https://twitter.com/gnosisguild?lang=de) series by [@keikreutler](https://twitter.com/keikreutler?lang=de) bridging cryptonetworks, web3, and gaming.*\n\n***Join the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq) today to continue the conversation.***\n\n*Cover Image: Leonora Carrington, El mundo mágico de los mayas (1964) meets CLIP.

John Perry Barlow is about to declare, “The internet consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself” ([1](https://www.eff.org/de/cyberspace-independence)).\n\nFrom the vantage point of today’s web, someone might argue that only the first part of Barlow’s statement is correct. The spectacle surrounding digital assets suggests that we’ve reached a new level of financialization, continuing a trajectory in which more of our actions online become direct economic interactions. While blockchain-based digital assets are amenable to speculative financial markets, they are not the only application of the technology. During this crest of the hype cycle, we could see relationships forged by new peer-to-peer institutions take root underneath.\n\n![An early world computer? Ruzname-i dairevi astronomical tables for both the Arebi (Islamic) and Rumi (Julian) calendars providing chronological accounts of seasonal change, entry of the sun into signs of the zodiac, and times of summer and sunset. Image: Wellcome Collection](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/38e90c0a-c2e5-4d73-bcac-daf0bb452bec.jpg?height=1176&width=2330)\n\nOne of the first core applications of public blockchains is global digital assets. Global in the sense that they do not rely on institutions to prove they are not being [double spent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending): the mystical cat on the moon NFT is, verifiably, the only mystical cat on the moon NFT corresponding to its token. The utility of provable uniqueness extends to types of relations beyond direct economic exchange as well, which has led many people to think as much about new forms of finance as about new forms of organizations.\n\nYet the promise of new forms of organizations aided by information technology cannot be separated from the context of the internet’s invention. In 1995, a year before John Perry Barlow’s [Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/de/cyberspace-independence), another written work that would impact the political ideology of the early internet appeared: [Tribes, Institutions, Markets, Networks (TIMN)](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf) by David Ronfeldt. The TIMN report was funded by the RAND Corporation. Darkly parodied in *Dr. Strangelove* as the BLAND Corporation, it is a non-profit, research and development think tank founded in 1948, which is responsible for informing the policies of the United States military, government, and industry to the present day. Because the internet begins amidst this militarized context, we will start here too ([2](https://www.rand.org/about/history/baran.list.html)).\n\nThe TIMN report creates a narrative of societal evolution in which humans have progressed through four distinct organizational forms:\n\n![(T) Tribes have the societal organizing principle of kinship, clans, and lineages. (I) Institutions have the societal organizing principle of hierarchy. (M) Markets have the societal organizing principle of competitive exchange. (N) Networks have the societal organizing principle of heterarchic collaborative exchange. Heterarchic here denotes organizations that are non-hierarchical, unranked, or possess the ability to be ranked in multiple ways.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ccfc3b17-2054-4305-b705-bd23ec2e5598.png?height=1076&width=1872)\n\nWhile new organizational forms evolve over time, preceding organizational forms “grow within their scope of activity, even though that scope is newly circumscribed”, citing how markets increased tax revenues to bolster the institutional state despite curtailing its participation in direct economic exchange in other respects ([3](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)).\n\n![Sam Hart, Laura Lotti, Toby Shorin, Squad Wealth, 2020](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/80498627-0fad-4e56-9afe-848f8f50a539.png?height=1640&width=2798)\n\nThe report’s institutional biases are clear, such as equating progress with Western liberal democracy, and its narrative of societal evolution may appear reductive at best. Its argument, however, provides an historical background to the political ideology from which decentralized organizations draw, knowingly or not. This is most apparent in the report’s identification of the newest organizational form: networks.\n\nThe report defines networks somewhat open-endedly. A key distinguishing feature between networks and the organizational forms preceding them is that networks are described as ***multi-organizational***, emphasizing collaboration between “small, scattered, and autonomous” groups over larger distances. These groups do not necessarily share a distinct organizational unity. While networks have existed throughout history, new information technology emphasizes cooperative relations that greatly impact institutions, through cutting across jurisdictions, and through markets, “facilitating the growth of [keiretsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu) and other distributed, web-like global enterprises and, increasingly, so-called ‘virtual corporations’”, Ronfeldt notes ([4](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)). Yet multi-organizational networks’ primary domain is neither the public nor private sector, at least as both are traditionally conceived. Instead, they will most transform a third, “autonomous social sector” (5), identified in the report as civil society. Painted in the 1995 landscape to include non-governmental organizations (NGOs), grassroots organizations, and private voluntary organizations, civil society will be strengthened by multi-organizational networks and perhaps address issues surrounding inequality, bureaucracy, and accessibility where preceding organizational forms failed.\n\nThe report presents a saccharine political image of networks: “While the development of the institutional and market forms of organization led to an emphasis on competitive advantages, development of the multi-organizational network form may shift the emphasis to cooperative advantages” ([6](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)). The underside of this political presentation is the imperial soft power NGOs would globally export in the following decade. For those currently working on web3, all of this language may feel familiar, although this questionable ideological inheritance often goes unremarked ([7](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703983004575073911147404540)).\n\nWith the report’s final emphasis on civil society’s three letter acronyms for organizations, NGOs, NPOs, and PVOs, a future one is naturally missing: DAOs.\n\n## A Chimeric Term\n\nDAO stands for *decentralized autonomous organization*.\n\nDAO comes from imagining how features of decentralized technology, such as global digital assets, censorship resistance, and automated actions, will change how organizations operate. Initially called *[decentralized autonomous corporations](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i-1379644274)* (DACs), the more generalizable term DAO emerged from the Ethereum blockchain community. Based on Vitalik Buterin’s [DAOs, DACs, DAs and More: An Incomplete Terminology Guide](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/) from 2014, a DAO could be described then as a capitalized organization in which a software protocol informs its operation, placing automation at its center and humans at its edges. For example, a software protocol could specify the conditions upon which an organization automatically distributes capital to its members. This led to the idea that organizational values could be automated and executed by code, a lingering idea that perhaps falsely suggests [tacit knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge) can be fully expressed in a software protocol. While the term’s hypothetical ideas abounded, by the time a DAO went from theory into experiment, the community largely reframed the term DAO to indicate “unstoppable”, or censorship-resistant, businesses. The first DAO, called [The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)), became one of the biggest spectacles in the Ethereum blockchain community to date when in 2016 it raised over $150m equivalent in ETH as a decentralized venture fund (8). However, the experiment proved short-lived when The DAO was hacked one month after launch.\n\nIt was not until several years later that larger initiatives related to DAOs gained traction again. From then until now, DAO has strayed from its initial signifiers to continue as a chimeric term, with both the term and its implementations varying depending on its cultural context. Each speculative run in the market, for all its noise, creates new signals of what DAOs can be deployed towards, bringing descriptive, technical, and cultural refinement to the concept in practice. While some quip that a [group splitting a lunch bill](https://twitter.com/DnlKlr/status/1398219740489859073) may be a DAO, in order to avoid its overgeneralization ([9](https://j.mirror.xyz/RUeJfZEZxr-hkuzUCakQyUuf2kOJVMPPiAWBaQFhhqc)), DAOs will be circumscribed here to focus on examples in the Ethereum blockchain community, despite the importance of other [communities similarly coordinating](https://twitter.com/helveticade/status/1400946733249662978). In 2021, a DAO could be described as a voluntary association with the operating principles of digital cooperativism. As voluntary associations, they are a cross-jurisdictional way for strangers, friends, or unlikely allies to pseudonymously come together toward common goals, supported by a token model, incentives, and governance. Members of a DAO can have representative ownership of its digital assets through a token, which often simultaneously acts as a governance right.\n\nAlthough many DAOs would not embrace the label of digital cooperative, one could say DAOs embrace cooperativism as a *protocol*, meaning an evolving set of relational practices that are distinct from traditional corporate structures or decentralized autonomous corporations, because they prioritize member ownership. The label cooperative is further qualified here by digital because today DAOs act primarily to coordinate around digital assets. However, as the concept of DAOs evolves in practice, [its digital primacy will fade](https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3). DAOs, as we will see, also introduce new dimensions that exceed what the operating principles of a digital cooperative notionally encompass.\n\n[https://twitter.com/evabeylin/status/1396184123761303554](https://twitter.com/evabeylin/status/1396184123761303554)\n\nDecentralized technology ecosystems tend to describe a phenomenon through its technical products. Yet as Ruth Catlow, co-founder of Furtherfield and DECAL decentralized arts lab, notes, “We need to be building cultures before structures” ([10](https://so-far.online/many-headed-hydras/)). While the overview below of DAO tools provides a concrete description of the concept in practice, it feels critical to keep in mind that DAOs ultimately coordinate through collective vibes.\n\n![DAO Starter Pack, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b277c810-3d61-4766-979c-af9d8b063e7e.png?height=1350&width=2400)\n\nIn its simplest form, DAO tools have been described as a group chat and a bank account ([11](https://www.patreon.com/posts/wyoming-dao-bill-51387956)). In 2021, this generally takes the form of a Discord server and a [Gnosis Safe Multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/), which is a web3 platform for creating [multi-signature accounts](https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e). Multi-signature accounts allow pseudonymous groups, across jurisdictions, to pool and manage funds within minutes, a capacity far beyond a [traditional joint bank account](https://twitter.com/ctbeiser/status/1399196774967898113). This “minimum viable” DAO, or MVD, tooling shone in the first half of 2021 with initiatives like PleasrDAO.\n\n[PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/pleasrdao?lang=de) is a collective that came together to bid on an NFT by the artist [pplpleasr](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr). Given escalating NFT digital art auction prices, the idea behind PleasrDAO was simple: a collective of fans using a multi-signature account could pool funds to place bids, and through holding in common, compete with other major bidders to win the auction. After winning their first eponymous auction, PleasrDAO went on to collect other works such as [Stay Free](https://foundation.app/Snowden/stay-free-edward-snowden-2021-24437), the NFT by Edward Snowden charitably supporting independent press, for a total of 2.2K ETH or USD 5.4 Million equivalent at the time. Their repeatedly successful missions means that while still acting as collectors, PleasrDAO will [broaden their scope](https://decrypt.co/66933/why-this-dao-bought-snowden-nft) to begin incubating projects by their community. Initiatives like PleasrDAO most promisingly challenge institutional collectors through their expanded membership, inviting artists they collect like pplpleasr to become members of the collective in turn.\n\n![Gnosis Safe multi-signature account owned by PleasrDAO, in which they hold collected NFTs in common.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9904c31-747e-4b83-aee1-0a2208b1f338.png?height=1800&width=2880)\n\nThough a group chat and multi-signature account may be enough to initialize a DAO mission, a token often becomes the next step toward embracing the principles of a digital cooperative. For example, PleasrDAO issued $PEEPS, a token distributed internally to represent members’ stake in the collection ([12](https://foundation.app/blog/pleasrdao)), which they are considering making public to fractionalize ownership of their collection. Similar experiments like [PartyDAO](https://twitter.com/prtydao?lang=de) employ a token, with the $PARTY token representing membership to a group chat, governance rights, and co-ownership of productive value managed by the DAO. It’s important to note PleasrDAO and PartyDAO are not flat hierarchies, as they both have elected groups of individuals that manage their multi-signature account treasuries. Though PleasrDAO and PartyDAO focused on shorter missions initially, they are both evolving toward a longer term vision, as collectors, investors, and incubators that use tokens to represent co-ownership in the spirit of a digital cooperative. Tokenization creates both opportunities and challenges for the networks to come.\n\n### A New Dimension in the Cooperative Movement\n\nReturning to their origin, DAOs today resemble *The* *DAO* in their emphasis on open participation and economic value creation, while their culture has shifted more toward specific niches and social connection. In the examples above, one term has been left intentionally vague: governance. Many DAOs today use the lightweight [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) platform for governance ([13](https://deepdao.io/#/deepdao/dashboard)). On Snapshot, DAOs each have a space to create and vote on proposals. For example, both [PleasrDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/pleasrdao.eth) and [PartyDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/partydao.eth) have a Snapshot space, on which they hold public votes for collective decisions. Snapshot weights votes by the amount of DAO-specific tokens an address holds, such as $PEEPS tokens in PleasrDAO.\n\n![PleasrDAO Snapshot space displaying the vote on whether to acquire the Dreaming at Dusk NFT benefitting the Tor Project.

Notably the initiative [MolochDAO](https://www.molochdao.com/), which uses the classic font Papyrus and heavily references gaming guilds, rekindled the fire of decentralized governance after The DAO hack. MolochDAO went on to inspire a legion of new DAOs, many direct forks, in its wake.\n\n[https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1399411511869665285](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1399411511869665285)\n\nThis essay’s history of DAOs is far from complete, as other projects like [Aragon](https://aragon.org/), [Colony](https://colony.io), [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/), and [DAOstack](https://daostack.io/) continue to develop their platforms for DAOs and modular initiatives like [Block Science](https://block.science/) and [Commons Stack](https://commonsstack.org/) arise. These projects offer DAO tools supporting many [governance mechanisms](https://blog.gnosis.pm/a-brief-discussion-of-the-protocol-governing-the-dxdao-7331407a2555). However, a prehistory of DAOs is also incomplete without its less frequently mentioned relation to platform cooperativism.\n\nBuilding on decades of commons initiatives, the term “platform cooperativism” coined by Trebor Scholz as well as the concept “[exit to community](https://hackernoon.com/startups-need-a-new-option-exit-to-community-ig12v2z73)” outlined by Nathan Schneider have intersected with the crypto space through essays like Jesse Walden’s [The Ownership Economy](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/). These catchphrases advocate for platforms owned, developed, and stewarded by their community of users. Specifically, the concept “exit to community” influenced decentralized governance through its clear exposition of a third way for companies to evolve their ownership.\n\n![Nathan Schneider, Startups Need a New Option: Exit to Community, 2019](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d14efc42-4c3c-4e7b-a6c9-b760a118e7c5.jpeg?height=579&width=1159)\n\nExit to community grew in practice through initiatives such as [DXdao](https://twitter.com/dxdao_?lang=de), which launched with the aim to give community ownership, governance, and value to software protocols. Today, with many decentralized finance software protocols guiding their development through DAOs, it's become clear that software protocols can both exit to, and [build with community](https://twitter.com/VENTURE_DAO/status/1395544596550062080). Because DAOs use early stage software tools, it makes sense that their first users and use cases would involve the governance of digital assets, such as software protocols. DAOs’ digital primacy is perhaps one reason that their resemblance to earlier cooperative movements often goes unremarked.\n\nToday, the International Cooperative Alliance defines cooperatives as “an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise” ([14](https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity)). A cooperative can also be defined by the structure of its legal entity, which dictates that cooperatives are companies not owned by shareholders but by their members. A key moment in the history of cooperatives was the establishment of the [Rochdale Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles), formulated by a society of weavers in 1844. The International Cooperative Alliance adopted these operating principles, which still guide cooperatives globally:\n\n1. Voluntary and Open Membership\n2. Democratic Member Control\n3. Member Economic Participation\n4. Autonomy and Independence\n5. Education, Training, and Information\n6. Cooperation among Cooperatives\n7. Concern for Community\n\nWhile these operating principles have evolved over the last two centuries, they could easily have been formulated by a DAO today. The principles of Voluntary and Open Membership, Member Economic Participation, and Concern for Community translate to the examples of DAOs above. The principles of Autonomy and Independence and Cooperation among Cooperatives are key for DAOs to flourish as multi-organizational networks, strengthening an autonomous social sector built through cross-DAO collaboration.\n\nDAOs could set more thoughtful norms around democratic member control, which cooperatives typically define as one member, one vote. Most DAOs employ token voting, that is, one token, one vote. DAOs reason that token ownership represents stakeholdership, with the token model often directly economically tied to the DAO, for example through fees on software protocols it owns. This allows DAO members with greater financial stake to have proportionally greater influence. Token voting does not directly contradict cooperative principles, as there are some cooperatives that weight votes by qualities such as production ([15](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3356774)). In certain cases this may feel apt, but as some DAOs evolve toward maintaining basic infrastructure such inequality becomes undesirable. This is in part because not all stakeholders have the purchasing power representative of their stake, and their practical knowledge may be excluded from governance.\n\nProjects such as Tornado Cash privacy protocol have approached this distribution problem by retroactively sending tokens to prior users, in a step toward making users stakeholders of the protocol ([16](https://tornado-cash.medium.com/tornado-cash-governance-proposal-a55c5c7d0703)). The [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/) project, a public blockchain for ecosystem services, takes another approach to this distribution problem. They have set aside 30% of their tokens for land stewards, climate scientists, and other stakeholders in regenerative land management to form [community DAOs](https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3) that participate in network governance. Because tokens can be distributed more easily than traditional corporate interests, memberships, or shares, this creates the possibility for a new form of token holder company, which can incorporate deeper practical knowledge in governance without increasing operational transaction costs. Stakeholders with practical knowledge, or [“tacit” knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge), like land stewards in the case of Regen Network, benefit governance by incorporating informal practices in decision making. Here, DAOs begin to introduce new dimensions that exceed what the operating principles of a digital cooperative notionally encompass. For this reason, as much innovation and emphasis should be placed on token distribution mechanisms that identify broader stakeholder participation as on decision making mechanisms.\n\nThe tokenization of online communities could be the subject of a longer debate. Far from the best answer to the social media woes of web 2.0, tokenization introduces more financialized relations. As a guiding star, web3 applications could aim to introduce value in relations which have been historically denied it, such as labor and environment, rather than creating new financialized relations. In this context, for DAOs with the mission of economic value creation, a token becomes a useful mechanism on three fronts:\n\n1. Bootstrapping Funding\n2. Distributing Governance Rights\n3. Aligning Ecosystem of DAOs\n\nTokenization introduces a powerful cultural norm into early stage organizations: the expectation of transparent co-ownership of its assets *from the start*. The tension between more traditional corporate structures that pay dividends and DAOs persists ([17](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)). Because most DAOs represent governance rights through a token, in some sense tokens Trojan horse principles of cooperatives directly into highly financialized spaces. These are two important sides of, quite literally, one coin, and for this reason, tokenization should not be dismissed. Tokens may be one key to unlock the ownership economy, but to reach a more equitable version of this future, we must participate in crafting the culture around token distribution, mediation, and governance now. This becomes important because, unlike shares in cooperatives, many tokens that double as governance rights can be sold on secondary markets. While this makes the conditions for entrance into an organization easier, DAOs can learn from cooperatives’ emphasis on long termism, through establishing more cultural patterns around token vesting, limited transferability, or more experimental mechanisms.\n\nJust as DAOs can learn from case studies of cooperatives, in a two-way exchange DAOs could introduce more forms of decentralized governance into cooperatives. This is the case made by Morshed Mannan in [Fostering Worker Cooperatives with Blockchain Technology: Lessons from the Colony Project](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3356774), which cites how cooperatives often face “coordination problems as the entity scales across borders,” with a “negative trend in participatory management, mutual monitoring, and solidarity” as they internationalize. Dilemmas that cooperatives face, such as funding, governance, and alignment across jurisdictions, DAOs directly address. Embracing cooperativism as a *protocol* rather than as a corporate structure, in their neologism, DAOs could encourage a cultural space that can be crafted beyond traditional divisions.\n\n## The Guilded Age\n\n[https://twitter.com/karakittel/status/1404510598033985548](https://twitter.com/karakittel/status/1404510598033985548)\n\nAs much as DAOs may accidentally embrace the operating principles of cooperatives preceding them, they also slyly resemble enclaves from other online cultures. They have the most to learn from guilds in massively multiplayer online games (MMOs).\n\nAs role playing computer games went online in the 1990s, this meant large numbers of players could share in one game world: an environment with a diverse array of objectives, activities, and subplots. Early integral examples of MMOs include The Realm Online, Ultima Online, and EverQuest, which lead to more classics like World of Warcraft and EVE Online. In many of these examples, players are mostly free to set their own goals loosely guided by the open game world narrative, affordances, and risks ([18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_game)), and because of this narrative freedom, players form groups to accomplish common goals out of the reach of single players. Referred to broadly as guilds, clans, or alliances, these groups can range from 40 to 1000 participants, and their goals could include defeating difficult enemies or constructing useful tools.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, cultural patterns emerge in guilds, and there can sometimes be a mismatch between the tools game world developers release for guilds and their actual needs. In an example from EVE Online, the game world developers created an interface for players to create corporations that allowed players to distribute shares. In practice, this feature to distribute shares was rarely used because it did not enhance existing cultural patterns. Instead, using EVE Online’s in-game browser and data API, many guilds developed their own tools needed to accomplish goals (19). A parallel between gaming guilds and DAOs could be drawn here, as the current wave of DAOs tend to use a combination of composable tools, such as bridging the Snapshot voting platform to a Gnosis Safe multi-signature account, rather than platforms which overly anticipate use cases for participants.\n\n[https://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1386007400033959938](https://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1386007400033959938)\n\nThough the specific feature to distribute corporate shares may not have taken off in EVE Online, gaming guilds frequently embrace economic practices of redistribution. The vast importance of MMO marketplaces, from [Varrock](https://runescape.salmoneus.net/archived-projects-and-content/site-content/tips/world-1-trading.html) to [gold farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming), for decentralized finance will be the subject of a later essay, but one economic practice may be keenly relevant for DAOs: Dragon-kill points (DKP). Taking their name historically from when dragons were the most frequently encountered enemies in MMOs, DKP emerged as an allocation system within and sometimes across guilds.\n\nComplex, sustained missions undertaken by guilds, such as killing a dragon, are usually referred to as raids, and can range in length from several hours to several days. At the end of a raid, the slain enemy drops in-game items called loot, and guilds must decide how to distribute it. Because guilds require diverse and complementary player skill sets over extended time periods, “It matters that the same people work together again” ([20](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945)) and the perceived fairness of often-scarce loot distribution is critical for this. As guilds grow in maturity, they often evolve different systems of loot distribution, for example beginning with random distribution, moving toward random distribution weighted by participation, and commonly arriving at distribution through an informal scoring system such as DKP. DKP act as a private money system, separate from any existing currency in a game world, and guild members earn them based on their participation in raids ([21](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945)). Guild members can then choose to spend these points in exchange for loot after a raid.\n\nInitially designed by a guild in 1999 for the EverQuest MMO, the [practice of DKP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_kill_points) has been embraced by many guilds across many game worlds, albeit with slight adjustments. Ed Castranova and Joshua Fairfield detailed one example in [Dragon Kill Points: A Summary Whitepaper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945): the Leftovers DKP system, which maximizes the number of participants by not being tied to one specific guild. As Castranova and Fairfield write, “Indeed, this organization is effectively the highest allocative body in the population. If there is an emergent government on \\[the World of Warcraft server\\] Silver Hand, it is The Leftovers.” The Leftovers DKP system arises from a few limitations: loot can only be picked up at the aftermath of battle and, in World of Warcraft, cannot be transferred between players. The Leftovers DKP system has a small group of informally appointed governors: players who laboriously, through public dialogue, set and maintain a database of loot item prices in DKP. When loot drops, players with DKP can choose to spend them for a specific item, with all bids and transactions public. Being zero sum, the Leftovers DKP system then equally distributes *spent* DKP points to all other guild members that participated in the raid.\n\nAs Castranova and Fairfield note, DKP supplements the existing currencies of a game world, as much for efficient allocation as for social cohesion, “making possible the exchange of time (spent on those raids in which an individual is not compensated) for goods (obtained on those raids in which an individual wins loot)” ([22](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945)). Especially in the case of World of Warcraft, because loot cannot be transferred between players, having loot itself also serves a strong signalling function, showing a player has meaningfully participated in raids over time. This DKP system precedes the mechanics of DAO platforms in development today, such as Aragon, Colony, and DAOstack, which all offer mechanisms to distribute reputational tokens based on the participation of members, rewarded for successful proposals, bounties, or campaigns: what might be called raids in other game worlds. These reputational tokens complement other economic systems enabled by DAO platforms, such as DAO-specific tokens or other assets in their multi-signature account treasuries. Often used as an alternative model to the plutocratic one token, one vote model, reputational tokens, earned through participation rather than purchasing power, provide greater voting power in DAOs that amasses over time. DAOs can learn from DKP, which in contrast, acts as a private money system based on participation that can be spent on other digital assets, instead of only amassing over time.\n\nIn addition to efficient allocation, contextual reputation, and signalling functions, the DKP system holds another significance for DAOs: generally all guilds resolve disputes independently from traditional court systems, despite these disputes involving expensive stakes. This becomes highly relevant for DAO tooling like Aragon’s digital jurisdictions or [Kleros](https://kleros.io/)’s decentralized arbitration service that aim to provide internet native dispute resolution tools. In fact, DAO tooling often tries to technically solve problems that gaming guilds have already culturally refined for several decades, and it may be time for DAOs and gaming guilds to merge their practical knowledge more closely.\n\n![A collage of alliance logos in EVE Online, 2006](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5504ac03-20c1-4dba-83a6-efda8d3a4077.jpg?height=806&width=1339)\n\nAnother subtle cultural pattern of gaming guilds relates to their articulated economic structure. As researcher Joshua Citarella points out, many DKP systems resemble a form of market socialism, in which goods are publicly owned but allocated by markets ([23](https://soundcloud.com/joshuacitarella/memes-as-politics-ep-13-dkp-is-market-socialism)). Citarella also goes on to note that despite the resemblance of DKP systems to market socialism, and the general happiness of players who participate in them, many of those players would decidedly not politically embrace the label market socialism. Shadow economics may be an apt term for when a group operates through an economic form it would not label itself as: DAOs as cooperative protocols and gaming guilds as market socialism. This tendency leaves interesting political territory like gaming guilds underexplored, because gaming guilds do not often need to wear their own flags. In one light, this could be more of a feature than a bug, as the invention of new terms like DAO, rather than reliance on canon, in part fuels their enthusiastic embrace.\n\n[https://twitter.com/TBSocialist/status/1402270439167037440](https://twitter.com/TBSocialist/status/1402270439167037440)\n\nWhile it may result in ignoring their prehistory, DAOs still retain a powerful ambiguity, in which their burgeoning political ambitions do not yet possess fully familiar aesthetic articulations. This could be co-opted toward several different ends. For example, one could imagine a DAO whose treasury self-destructs, [like terra0's NFT](https://terra0.medium.com/two-degrees-nft-5af1263bfcc), when global temperatures rise over 2 degrees Celsius, accompanied by a sparkly, unassuming mascot avatar.\n\nSuch a DAO might attract participation from those not drawn to the familiar green aesthetics of most climate initiatives, and it could have the effect of broadening participation in a political objective through creating new cultures around it. The momentum of the questionably new can always be good for something, and the question becomes how to cultivate DAOs that can build surreptitious solidarity across ideological divides.\n\n## A Constellation is Born\n\n![Actually, it might be.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/482156a6-7f32-475a-b467-0e0b8c4648c7.png?height=534&width=880)\n\nWhile a comprehensive prehistory of decentralized autonomous organizations could take us much further into the past ([24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_Saint_Benedict)), many proponents of DAOs have a core belief about their impact on the future: DAOs could out-compete by out-cooperating the modern firm.\n\nIn the twentieth century, many economists asked why companies arose when services priced by the market should, in theory, be more efficient. Ronald Coase explored the answer to this question in [The Nature of the Firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm), coming to the conclusion that markets create unaccounted for transaction costs. These transaction costs could arise from price discovery, contract negotiation, or onboarding for a service, which can be mitigated by retaining services in a company. Following from this theory, the size of firms may have practical limits they won’t exceed, because eventually transaction costs increase through developments like departmental bureaucracy. Though this theory has many critiques, the promise of DAOs can be positioned in relation to it: DAOs aspire to become *more* efficient as they scale ([25](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-daostack/blob/master/dxdao_whitepaper_v1.pdf)). While in practice this aspiration has been far from proven, in some respects the promise of DAOs lies in using technical governance protocols to reduce transaction costs. To return to an example above, DAO tooling like Gnosis Safe enables pseudonymous groups, across jurisdictions, to pool and manage funds within minutes. The equivalent process to establish a traditional joint bank account could take months, and in some cases, it wouldn’t be possible for individuals from different jurisdictions to jointly manage a bank account. Through the affordances of public blockchains, DAOs can incorporate deeper practical knowledge in governance without increasing operational transaction costs: aspiring to become more efficient as they scale.\n\nWhile DAO tooling like Gnosis Safe enables this today, overall, the promise of infinitely scalable organizations still has a long way to go. Often even the promise of DAOs can obscure their utility in practice. In [The Dissensus Protocol: Governing Differences in Online Peer Communities](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fhumd.2021.641731/full), Jaya Klara Brekke, Kate Beecroft, and Francesca Pick focus on a case study of the Genesis DAO, a collective centered around the DAOstack platform. They write:\n\n> The Genesis DAO is a good example of a unique trait common to many DAOs, namely, that they comprise highly motivated groups that have formed around a set of ideas about governance, rather than governance being a means in order to achieve some shared mission. In other words, it was tool-centric and focused on one main action: allocating funds to proposals. It is unusual for people who are strangers to start making financial decisions together immediately without having time to develop coherence and trust. And this was in fact the very promise of projects like the Genesis DAO: that the technology would bypass the need to develop trusted relationships, meaning thousands of people would be able to coalesce around objectives, take actions, and even spend money together as a group ([26](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fhumd.2021.641731/full)).\n\nMuch like the earlier example above of EVE Online players not using the interface to distribute corporate shares released by the game developers, tool-centric development, as well as the assumption that tools automatically create useful cultural patterns, must be reconsidered. Rather than technical protocols for governance that diminish the need for trusted relationships, DAOs can be approached through iteratively developing highly composable tools to coordinate across different levels of coherence and trust. Ultimately, the efficiency DAOs aspire to may not be defined as an economic function but as a matter of “better,” situated governance: one supported by deeper practical knowledge within an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games).\n\n## Layers of the DAO\n\nDAOs will not be the uniformly non-hierarchical networks some imagine. Instead, DAOs coordinate across different levels of coherence and trust. In [Ownership in Cryptonetworks](https://blog.curvelabs.eu/ownership-in-cryptonetworks-96f13f4a113e), Patrick Rawson argues that for DAOs, “distributing ownership to squadlike entities with more specialized objectives is the key long-term problem to solve” in order to enable meaningful work. These “squadlike entities” are smaller teams with trust relationships, perhaps not unlike the gaming guilds in the examples above, which execute on value aligned missions with DAOs. At a closer look, effective DAOs start behaving much more like networks of teams, like the [MONDRAGON Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) network with 100 affiliated cooperatives, rather than the loosely coordinated swarm intelligence that they might appear as from a distance. Inspired by Rawson’s analysis, we can roughly sketch three layers of a DAO:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e7260512-1458-4aac-bc0a-cbca9d6d532d.png?height=1202&width=2136)\n\n1. **Token**: Multi-organizational networks aligned by token ownership\n2. **Teams**: Teams, guilds, and squads represented by token ownership\n3. **Missions**: Missions, milestones, and raids financed by token ownership\n\nFrom these layers, a ***heterarchical*** network emerges, meaning an organization that possesses the ability to be ranked in multiple ways.\n\n![An example of DAOs in which tokens, teams, and missions are distributed across several DAO networks, which can be ranked or assorted in multiple ways.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3aedd8d4-58c2-4273-bc91-3761d7f8a995.png?height=1982&width=3524)\n\nIn ecosystems that prioritize distributing ownership, tokens encourage DAO networks to be managed by their members. Tokens, teams, and missions are not confined to the quasi-institutional boundaries of a single DAO but can and, in order to meaningfully decentralize the control network, *should* be represented by token ownership in multiple DAOs. An ecosystem not unlike the control networks of transnational corporations emerges, but importantly, one without monocentric command and with reduced transaction costs across different levels of trust. As Rawson writes, “As long as the collective memory freely circulates within a given \\[DAO network\\], discovered solutions to problems can be reused.” When we view DAOs as multi-organizational networks aligned by token ownership, the purpose of DAO tooling becomes not only to support the operations of one team but to facilitate collaborations across many. Funded by PrimeDAO, [DAO-to-DAO (D2D) collaboration mechanisms](https://medium.com/primedao/exploring-dao2dao-collaboration-mechanisms-c37218a17a21) appear the most forward thinking work along these lines, which may eventually overtake traditional business-to-business (B2B) products. A new squadlike entity emerging from stealth mode, the [Gnosis Guild](https://twitter.com/gnosisguild?lang=de) team embraces a similar emphasis on DAO-to-DAO tools, with a new constellation of DAO tools called [Zodiac]().\n\nRevisiting the promise of DAOs, their potential to incorporate deeper practical knowledge in governance does not mean that decision making must involve an ever-larger number of members in every proposal, but rather that within a DAO network, teams who possess the most relevant expertise can easily share it with the ecosystem. When we view DAOs as constellations of teams, not monoliths, DAOs become networks to allow collective memory to flow freely.\n\n## The Networks to Come\n\nThe TIMN RAND report this essay began with closes on a curious note. It reads:\n\n> Much of the literature about redesigning organizations for the information-age focuses on production—on improving productivity, or manufacturing something new like the Boeing 777 jetliner. Yet, does this not reflect a lingering industrial-age mentality? Production organizations remain a crucial part of the organizational ecology. However, we should also be thinking about “sensory organizations.” Sensory functions are quite different from production functions, and require different modes of organization—e.g., more networks connected to the world outside an office’s boundaries. Determining appropriate designs for all manner of sensory organizations may become a good meta-theme for innovative research and development in the years ahead ([27](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)).\n\nThis closing sentiment echoes the popularity in that era of the twentieth century media theorist Marshall McLuhan, who emphasized how digital media impacts our sensory nervous systems. If digitally prime networks like DAOs operate on our nervous system first, it does not mean they won’t come to reorganize, reshape, and redistribute our material world. Some still refuse to take seriously the fact that cooperative principles, gaming guilds, and odd imaginaries like DAOs present an emergent organizational form with legitimate political relevance. We must take them politically seriously now, so that they don’t remain shaped only by those on one side of the digital divide. The days of DAOs versus [PACs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee), political action committees that fundraise for electoral candidates in the United States, will be with us soon. Just as markets did not make states obsolete, but diminished some of their operations while strengthening others, DAOs introduce new forms into traditional political participation that emerge from the autonomous social sector: [the network union](https://1729.com/network-union/).\n\n![Character from Trust’s Mascot Streams, ARB  and GVN908, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f59011fe-b6aa-42e6-9344-daab85c5976a.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nTo call attention to the chimeric’s term failings at seriousness, many return to its misnomer: the “A” in DAO does not live up to its autonomous reference; while others like researcher [Aude Launay gracefully invoke](https://twitter.com/audelau/status/1413731529042321410) the political, rather than the technical, spirit of autonomy in DAOs. Even though the term DAO remains poetically correct, we could propose an occasional replacement: decentralized avatar organizations. Such organizations would take their political stakes both lightly and heavily. As poetitician and Digital Minister of Taiwan Audrey Tang notes, the days of avatar politicians are already here ([28](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/radical-transparency-humor-disinformation-poetry-for-machines-avatar-politicians-and-giving-non-human-entities-a-vote-with-digital-minister-of-taiwan-audrey-tang-X36XnWVg)). Avatar politicians are [virtual beings](https://www.virtual-beings-summit.com/) that represent, rally, and advocate on behalf of political platforms, and when automation increases, they may even spawn their own political platforms. A decentralized avatar organization would recognize the coming virtual zeitgeist: this could look like a [collectively managed cyborg](https://twitter.com/cjliu49/status/1345110226744184833) like [Lil Miquela](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Miquela) or an entire environment shaped by members, like [Trust’s moving castles](https://trust.support). Decentralized avatar organizations will have collectively developed, interoperable game worlds, engines, or virtual being mascots at their core, which co-creates the culture around which their members organize.\n\n![Jay Springett, worldrunning.guide: A Speculative Document About Worlding Worlds, and Running Them, 2020-](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6fa40349-2cd0-41c2-8680-ffde9154743b.png?height=1036&width=706)\n\nBy learning from their prehistory, DAOs can move towards a syncretic theory of organizations, meaning a theory which incorporates a wide range of cultural patterns, practices, and influences while recognizing its inherited political biases. To escape the tendency to fetishize technical protocols for governance, decentralized avatar organizations must cultivate compelling environments players want to inhabit, recognizing narratives, aesthetics, and goals held in common are key to their success. Making the internet a place not only for transactions but for relationships and thought itself, as Barlow wrote, relies on the depth of these narratives. As is the case with massively multiplayer online games, DAOs are less technical protocols for governance and more high stakes game worlds that interweave.\n\nWe should aim for rough consensus and running worlds.\n\n*This essay is the second in a [Gnosis Guild](https://twitter.com/gnosisguild?lang=de) series by [@keikreutler](https://twitter.com/keikreutler?lang=de) bridging cryptonetworks, web3, and gaming.*\n\n***Join the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq) today to continue the conversation.***\n\n*Cover Image: Leonora Carrington, El mundo mágico de los mayas (1964) meets CLIP.

Over the past few months, we've spoken with many projects that want to use a similar tool for their communities. We kept hearing this again and again, so we decided to build a standalone tool that anyone on Mirror could use. Today we'd like to introduce: Token Race.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NYumZHFEzC67T3ghCQIcL.jpg?height=1142&width=2284)\n\nWe’ve spent a lot of time building, ideating, and iterating on Web3 economic protocols to support projects and creators. As our suite of economic tools has grown and matured and we’ve had communities form around them, we feel that now is the right time to start investing in governance tools to support these communities.\n\nA token race is a great way for individuals and DAOs to get their community involved in decision-making. You can use a token race in various ways, such as:\n\n* curating membership in a DAO\n* curating a list of proposals around the operations of a DAO\n* distributing funds for a grant program\n\nCheck out this example below for a token race I created to figure out what we should do with all this spare $WRITE. Anyone with spare $WRITE tokens in their wallet can vote once the voting period opens.\n\n[proposal://bafkreibqbj6dapw57cpsxpcwe2jgz3w3qtp66sg24la3uhkvgathtlwcq4](proposal://bafkreibqbj6dapw57cpsxpcwe2jgz3w3qtp66sg24la3uhkvgathtlwcq4)\n\nTo create a token race, a user specifies the address of the ERC20 token contract to use, uploads a list of proposals that they’d like their community to vote on, and specifies the minimum number of tokens members need to hold to be eligible to vote. We take a snapshot of balances, and once the voting opens members get to vote on the various proposals proportional to their wallet balance at the block height of the snapshot. Once the voting period ends, winners are selected based on the highest number of votes. All data is backed up on the Filecoin network and accessible via IPFS (h/t [estuary.tech](https://estuary.tech/)) so even if Mirror goes under, your token races are preserved in the annals of the metaverse.\n\nThis is just the first of many governance tools we plan to introduce, and we’re so excited to be able to share this one with you. We’re also working on adding more options and parameters to improve Token Race, such as quadratic voting, ERC721 based voting, delegation, and much more.\n\nAs usual, hit us up for any feedback, feature requests, or even if you want to build on top of Token Race.\n\nWe’ve also created a handy [quickstart guide](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/token-race) in your Mirror dashboard so you can get started right away.\n\nWe can’t wait to see what you come up with! ❤️", "timestamp": 1632919863, "digest": "dLLIq4Iebg5DLWJbOWa3sU6oQuwbogkmqPnz-ZbzPUg", "contributor": "0xbDc4199575A5FA3F19e9888C5d51Bde798F404Cc"}

He knew Amazon could only exist because of the Internet.\n\nBut being on the Internet wasn't the value proposition of Amazon. Nor being on the Web3 will be the value proposition of the next billion dollars companies. What's so exciting with Web3 is that it has the power to create completely new experiences and use-cases that have never been seen before. Comparable to what Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, did 20 years ago by completely reinventing the way people were buying books, we'll see Web3 companies reinvent things that we're doing today and 10x improve the experience. So what are some of the experiences that can be reinvented in Web3? What are the areas that really need to leverage this new technology to 10x the experience?\n\nSocial Networks might be a good place to start. Indeed, for the last year, we've seen the creator economy booming, and we see more talented individuals sharing content online and gathering knit communities. More individuals are collaborating toward joint projects. Last year has proved to us that generation Z now wants to live from their passion and is not ready to follow the work paradigm that has been shaped during the last 50 years. The future of work is being built now. And most of the collaboration happens through current Social Networks (Discord, Twitter, Slack et..). But with our society evolving, these social networks don't fulfill our needs anymore. Creators today need Ownership and efficient ways to collaborate.\n\nWeb2 social platforms won't solve these problems because they intrinsically can't. Resolving these would mean killing their business.\n\nAnd that's when Web3 is coming. Decentralized Social networks have the power to solve these problems. Let me explain.\n\n## 1/ The problems with Web2 Social Networks\n\nFrom 00' to 10', we saw social networking and User Generated Content platforms rise. We saw the emergence of social media, which allowed everyone to have a voice on the Internet and express their creativity through their content. During the next decade, some users amassed millions of followers and started to monetize their content. Creators, also called 'Influencers' at this time, discovered they could monetize their audience through those platforms and that it was possible to earn a living from their passion. They were helping others (brands & businesses) to achieve their goals.\n\nBut the Internet and our society have evolved. After 10 years of working for brands, creators discovered they could now BE the brand, BE the product, and they could do for them what they were doing for others. Creators have new needs that current social media won't be able to solve.\n\nIndeed, there are three main problems with current social media: Lock-in data, Centralized Power, and an Ads-driven Business model.\n\n* **Lock-in Data -** Our physical and digital lives are intrinsically linked, and online Reputation is more important than ever. However, for 99% of people on the Internet, the value of their digital identity is locked within platforms. Creators that have built an audience of 1 million followers on Instagram won't start in another platform like Twitter with 1 million followers. They will begin with 0. Amazon sellers who have built their Reputation for years won't start on other marketplaces with five-star reviews. They will begin at 0. When leaving a platform, users have to start from scratch, all over again, as there is no interoperability between platforms. The data are locked. It doesn't incentivize users to do their best or build long-term relationships as they know they will lose it when leaving the platform. Furthermore, we cannot keep locating our social connections and memories inside servers controlled by for-profit companies. The connections between people should be controlled by the people, not by companies. Decentralized Social networks must re-capture our social data in new ways.\n* **Centralized Power -** Today, social media is hyper-centralized. A handful of private companies control public discourse and earn profits off content they don't even create.\n* **Ads-driven business model -** This outdated business model forces current social networks to keep a walled garden around their content. Indeed, opening their data would mean killing their business model. Their main way to monetize is to sell those data to for-profit companies to target specific audiences. This business model prevents external developers from innovating or building apps on top of it. It also gives users and creators no choice but to continue using these apps as they have already created an audience on these platforms. On top of that, this business model creates a situation where creators who actually produce the content are underpaid, under-monetized, and don't fully capture the value they are making.\n\nWe're now entering the third phase of Social media. Today's Creators don't want to do the promotion of products to their audience. They realized they could build big projects with their fans, involving them in the process and sharing the upsides with them. It's a complete paradigm shift in the fan/creator relationship. Today, Social Networks can't provide the tools needed to develop this kind of relationship.\n\nSo, what are precisely the needs of those creators? How can we build decentralized Social Networks that really empower them? What can of use-cases would appear on those platforms?\n\nThe first step to answering these questions is learning from the past and seeing what social mechanisms worked in Web2 platforms.\n\n## 2 - Social mechanisms of current Social Network\n\nBefore exploring the possible use-cases of decentralized Social Networks, it's essential to understand what makes a good Social Network. By analyzing the dynamics of the current Social Networks, we'll understand more the Human Social Mechanisms and better understand how to leverage crypto mechanisms to fulfill these human needs.\n\n### 2.1 - Proof of X\n\n[Julian Lehr](https://twitter.com/julianlehr) developed the proof-of-X mechanism in his famous \"[Proof of X](https://julian.digital/2020/08/06/proof-of-x/)\" essay. In this essay, he argues that, at their core, social networks are primarily about one thing: Building social capital through signaling. People are going on Instagram to prove they are creative (Proof-of-creative-work), on Wikipedia to prove they are knowledgable (Proof-of-knowledge), and on Strava to prove they are athletic (Proof-of-Physical-activity). As Julian mentioned in his essay (talking about Strava), \"*While the status game that initially got you into the app might be zero-sum, the actual physical exercise you have to put in to compete has a very positive, compounding effect.*\"\n\nCreating a Social Network with a strong positive feedback loop will make sure people will come on the platform because it is actually good for them. They will come back repeatedly because it makes them feel good and because it's actually good for them. And the more you use the app, the more likely you are to do the atomic behavior. That's what a positive-sum game is all about. No one needs to lose for someone else to win. We can create Decentralized Social Networks that are viable and actually good for people.\n\nThe question is: What kind of social networks could have similar positive feedback loops? An exciting model explored is the play-to-earn model, where users have to do specific tasks to get rewarded.\n\n![https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WGbPNP4X2QPyeUN0kVG9A.png?height=758&width=1150)\n\nFor example, we could think of a Social Network that incentivizes its users to set up challenges and inspire others to do \"sustainable life hacks (e.g. eat one vegan meal a day). Users could document it via short-form video and getting points related to their in-app activity: the number of actions/challenges completed, how many users they inspired to do the challenge etc.. Impactr is a community that is already exploring these mechanisms.\n\n### 2.2 - Status-as-a-Service\n\nIn his famous essay \"[Status-as-a-Service](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service),\" [Eugene Wei](https://twitter.com/eugenewei) argues that \"*People are status-seeking monkeys*\" and \"*People seek out the most efficient path to maximizing social capital*.\"\n\nTo create a successful social network, it's essential to consider its utility and the Social Capital it can provide to users. Can I use the social network to accumulate social capital? How is it measured? And how do I earn that status? What kind of features can be implemented to reinforce this Social Status?\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51819d1d-28e0-4ef1-ad07-3f217b18c6f2_843x663.png)\n\nUsers are going on Snapchat to discuss with friends, but then keep talking to not lose their \"streaks\" (number of consecutive days you're talking to someone). People are going on Twitter to post their journey but then try to get the \"official\" stamp.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that status must be earned the hard way. Otherwise, it wouldn't be worth anything. Value is tied to scarcity, and scarcity on social networks derives from proof-of-X. As explained right before, the proof-of-physical activity on Strava rewards users who are achieving impressive training sessions. The longer the bike ride you're doing, the more social capital you're gaining. Status isn't worth much if there's no skill and effort required to have it.\n\n### 2.3 - Social Asymptote\n\nSocial Asymptote is a term I first heard in the \"[Status Monkey](https://www.notboring.co/p/status-monkeys)\" essay by [Packy McCormick](https://twitter.com/packyM). He explains that not everyone can do what it takes to gain social capital on any given social network, which creates an upper limit. There are only so many people you can convince to do the atomic behavior. Indeed, a lot of people nowadays have a TikTok account, but only a few of them are actually making videos on the platform. This is explained by the fact that it's not that easy to get familiar with all the tools the app allows. Most users are unwilling to put in the work to get good at whatever the TikTok algorithm requires. While it's impossible to have all the users of a platform actually publishing content and doing the atomic behavior, it's interesting to think about the mechanisms that can be put in place to encourage anyone to do it.\n\n### 2.4 - Come for the tools, stay for the network.\n\nIn his famous essay \"[Come for the tool, stay for the network,](https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network)\" [Chris Dixon](https://twitter.com/cdixon) explains his idea to initially attract users with a [single-player tool](http://cdixon.org/2010/06/12/designing-products-for-single-and-multiplayer-modes/) and then, over time, get them to participate in a network. The tool helps get to the initial critical mass. The network creates long-term value for users and defensibility for the company.\n\nFor example, [Strava](https://www.strava.com) is attracting users by letting them track their sport activity easily (tool) and then publish the activity automatically in the profile of the users where other users can see, like, and comment on it (network).\n\nThrough these four examples we've just seen in the first part of this essay, we know understand that to create a successful Decentralized Social Network, we need to create a platform that effectively:\n\n* Let users earn status the hard way.\n* Makes users come back repeatedly because it makes them feel good and because it's actually good for them.\n* Allows its users to do the atomic behaviors easily, and that actually encourages anyone to do it.\n* Provides tools that make the life of the users more effortless, and therefore hook them.\n* Solves the existing problems in Social Networks of Lock-in data, Centralized Power, and Ads-driven Business model.\n\nThe best Social Networks have succeeded in reinventing the way people communicate together, reinventing the medium, and effectively leveraging human psychological behaviors. People first got hooked in those socials because it was new and allowed complete new behaviors. I think Web3 platforms will hook the next billions of social media users by creating a completely new experience, providing a way of communicating together and collaborate. Snapchat allowed people to communicate through ephemeral photos, TikTok through short videos, and Clubhouse through audio. So what kind of new experience can the future Web3 platforms allow?\n\n### 3.1 - Solving the lock-in Data problem\n\nDecentralized social networks are unlike traditional social networks in that they're interface-agnostic. Indeed, one of the main advantages of Decentralized Social networks is the Interoperability they allow. In Web3, every transaction is taken on-chain (meaning send through a blockchain and verified by other people) and therefore accessible in an open ledger (all transactions happening in a blockchain are visible by anyone else). With its open data model, Crypto allows any Web3 platform to use those accessible data and, therefore, recover the user's Reputation from other platforms. A creator with 1M followers on a decentralized platform will bring them on any other Web3 platform. They are tied to their Crypto Wallet (Online identity) and not to a specific platform profile. Creators that have built an audience of 1 million followers on a Web3 platform won't start in another platform with 0 followers. They will begin with 1 million. Amazon sellers who have built their Reputation for years won't start on other marketplaces with 0 reviews. They will bring their Reputation across platforms and retrieve all their 5-stars reviews. It's a complete paradigm shift, and I admit it can be a difficult concept to understand. But similarly that you can access your email inbox from any computer in the world because it's tied to login and a password, not the computer itself, you'll be able to access your followers from any platform in the world because it's linked to your Crypto Wallet, not the platform itself.\n\nCreators won't have their community's attention funneled through one platform but will be split up between interfaces. The sum of engagement across all interfaces will be greater than if it was a centralized platform.\n\nTo create a successful Decentralized Social Network, it's fundamental to allow Interoperability.\n\n### 3.2 - Tokenized communities\n\nThe \"holy grail\" for Social Networks is creating a platform with Social Capital and Utility Simultaneously.\n\nAs shown in the graphic below, the more users coming on the platform, the more useful the platform becomes with the traditional network effect. No one would go on Instagram if there weren't the photos of their friends published there, on Uber if there wasn't any driver. With this model, any new platform needs to attract many users before the platform has any real utility...\n\nOn the other side, there's a new variable with the Token Network effect: The Financial utility. Indeed, even though there isn't much \"application utility\" initially, first users are incentivized through Social Tokens to use the platform and make it grow . A very high financial utility will drive new users to reach the inflection point where application utility will surpass the economic utility.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F367be732-d720-4b10-b4b3-2a5923af3c2a_2160x1080.png)\n\nIn decentralized social networks, users participate in the economic upside of the Network. They are rewarded for the time invested in building the product and Network. With the platform's utility increasing over time, more people will want to participate in its digital economy. The social token will gain value, rewarding early contributors for their hard work.\n\nDecentralization is about profit-sharing and revenue tokenization. It combines utility (earning money) and social status. Users will come back and participate because it's actually good for them to participate in open economies. They will reach financial freedom and will gain social status within their tribe.\n\nDecentralized Social Networks, in creating a token, will also play on the Proof-of-X mechanism. Users will do missions to earn the bounties (a single-player tool with multiplayer social feed), and the more the users use the app, the more likely they are to do the atomic behavior (more involved → more responsibilities → more missions → financial freedom).\n\nTokens will allow anyone to prove they are part of a community, prove that they've helped grow the community, and prove they were there since the beginning.\n\n### 3.3 - Ads-driven problem\n\nTo succeed, a decentralized social network also needs to get rid of the old ads-driven business model.\n\nIn the end, brands are enterprise versions of creators. Today, one hundred advertisers drive 80% of Facebook's revenue. These are mega fortune 500 companies like P&G or Coca-Cola. They are doing that because it's (almost) the only solution to reach an audience, but they do not like what they have to do. They don't enjoy the game Facebook is playing with their billions of dollars and squeezing them for every penny.\n\nThese major brands feel the same pain as individual creators, and the next Decentralized social platforms need to solve this problem.\n\nA great ads campaign is when you meet people where they are and understand what they need. Young people are not on Facebook anymore. If brands want to reach them, they have to be on Web3 and understand the trends. That's why Budweiser purchased the domain name \"Beer.eth\", VISA bought an NFT, and Arizona Ice Tea bought a [Bored Ape](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/). It's because they want to be part of this movement and reach the \"cool kids.\"\n\nBig brands like Arizona ice tea already understood that. They can't just show up to the party. They have to be invited and think very carefully about who they align with and how they grow together. There has to be a strong values alignment. It's more than ever crucial for brands to develop their brand and product so that Web3 communities will invite them in. Otherwise, those brands are going to be outsiders.\n\nIn building the next decentralized social Network, it's essential to understand these dynamics and align users' and brands' incentives. It seems like there is finally a viable business model that can suit both users and brands.\n\n### 3.4 - Centralization problem\n\nMaybe the next decentralized Social Network won't constitute one giant graph (similar to Facebook or Twitter) but constitutes many subgraphs around shared topics.\n\nWe're already seeing many communities and platforms collaborating, creating a Social network of many subgraphs. This seems to be a positive direction. It would be much harder to own, regulate, and moderate one giant decentralized Social Network.\n\nThe decentralization must also come within these sub-graphs. With the tokenization of these communities, the voting power (that comes with holding the token) will be split among many contributors and therefore limit the risks of a small group deciding for a whole community.\n\n### 4 - Concrete use-cases\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this essay, decentralized Social networks will succeed only if they allow to do things that can only be done on the Blockchain. It has to completely reinvent the user experience. It doesn't make sense to build a feed of photos and text \"on the blockchain.\" It already exists on centralized social networks. In my opinion, even allowing users to \"control their data\" is not a strong enough selling point because users don't really see the advantages of their day-to-day use. For Web3 Social Network to succeed, the experience needs to be magic that is only possible on the Blockchain.\n\nSo what kind of experience is only possible on the Blockchain?\n\n#### 4.1 - Use case 1: The future of Media.\n\nI think Media should leverage Web3 capabilities. A Magazine could create its own social Network. Indeed, it would imply a lot of advantages for the magazine and the users.\n\n* **Check the sources -** With all the content now on-chain, it would be easy for anyone, even in ten years from now, to check the sources and double-check the information mentioned in an article.\n* **Impossible to censor -** It will be impossible to censor someone as it's impossible to remove something from the Blockchain.\n* **Raise funds easily -** The magazine could embed directly in their platform NFTs to raise money. Instead of going on another platform and creating an account, it will be easy for users to just click on the \"Buy the NFT to support our work\" button.\n* **Track biggest fans -** It will also be easy for the magazine to track who helped the project and offer them special perks. We could imagine people buying the NFT receiving the ability to have access to exclusive content. As everything is on-chain, the NFT holders won't have to do anything. By signing up with their crypto wallet and, therefore, proving their identity, the platform will see they are the owner of the NFT and will unlock the content just for them. Even if they send the private link to their friends that don't hold the NFT, those friends won't be able to access it as the platform won't unlock the content.\n* **Involve the community -** The magazine could also involve more of their community with democratic decisions by letting them vote through SnapShot.\n\n#### Use case 2: Building trust and empowering the next billions of curators.\n\nAnother interesting use case with decentralized Social networks is the ability to build a Social graph.\n\nAgain, as everything is on-chain and tied to someone's identity, it's easy for any web3 platform to access the data and create a Social Graph. That's something we've been working hard on at [Coinvise.](https://www.coinvise.co/) On every Coinvise creator profile, you can see the Social Tokens a creator owns and see which community they believe and participate in. Coinvise's creators also have a reputation score tied to their online identity and created based on their actions in other decentralized platforms.\n\nNow imagine when there will be hundreds of creators and communities jumping into Web3. Any Coinvise user will have access to an on-chain social graph of the relationship between creators, their community, their work, their friends, etc...\n\nIt's a whole new world of possibilities for anyone wanting to discover new niches. Everyone will be a curator. Suppose you like a sport creator, for example. In that case, you'll be able to see directly in which community they believe in, in which ones they are participating in. All the information will be curated automatically. No need to do it manually. With an open-data model and every transaction happening on-chain, the curating work will be done automatically.\n\nA decentralized Social Network could also solve the problem of trust. Today when selling on Facebook Marketplace or receiving DMs from people on Instagram, the only way to know if the person is legit is to trust weak social signals such as the number of followers, the profile picture, if the account is certified etc.. In web3, there will be the reputation score. [Reputation score](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/reputation-score-on-web3) will serve to establish trust for creators, not because they're high-signal on Twitter but because they've probably built and grow a high-value community.\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nWe're already seeing successful decentralized social Networks leveraging psychological mechanisms saw in this essay and solving some of the most pressing problems with Web2 platforms. I can think of [Showtime](https://tryshowtime.com/) that allows its users to own their content through NFT (solve the lock-in data problem) and leveraging the Proof-of-X mechanism (by collecting rare NFTs, Showtime's users can prove their good taste (Proof-of-good-taste)). The platform also leveraged the \"Investment-as-a-Status mechanism.\" It allows people to show that they have invested in a creator early, that they have been there since the beginning, and that they are [the day 1 fan](https://benjlaufer.medium.com/the-day-one-fan-ac331a6731ae).\n\n[Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/) is also an interesting Web3 Platform that has implemented a \"Proof-of-education\" mechanism, letting its users prove they invested their time early in crypto. That leveraged the \"Token Network effect\" by rewarding its users with tokens when completing a quest.\n\nI've also recently discovered two promising decentralized Social networks:\n\n* [XMPT](https://xmtp.com/) - Breaking communication out of walled gardens and enabling messaging between wallets\n* [DeSo](https://www.deso.org/) - DeSo is a new layer-1 blockchain built from the ground up to scale decentralized social applications to one billion users.\n\nWeb2 Social Networks will slowly lose all their users because they won't intrinsically solve the most pressing problems they are currently facing.\n\nI think the next big social Network may start out not looking like a social network at all. There won't be one main social Network. There will be several social networks, all composable. Indeed, composability is a big part of crypto.\n\nAs [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa) mentioned recently, NFT composability is already here.\n\n![https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1423047558432124931](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/10_l6tW0Z1Ogm42u7EhWv.png?height=760&width=1174)\n\nWe’ll use daily several Web3 platforms and will bring our data to every one of them. There won’t be a centralized power anymore, nor Lock-in data or ads-driven business model.\n\nCrypto will be the native token for unlocking experience in these platforms and might be the native token for the [Great Online Game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game). \n\nAnd what if the next decentralized social network was simply the Metaverse?\n\n\n---\n\n###### **Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en) and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/8jaQB5CZ) 🔥**\n\nThanks for being here!\n\n\n---\n\n*Special thanks to [Jenil Thakker](https://twitter.com/0xjenil) for his thoughtful feedback before publishing.*\n\n\n---\n\nFurther resources:\n\n* [Social Networks & Sociable Protocols](https://ricburton.substack.com/p/social-networks-and-sociable-protocols)\n* [Decentralized Social Networks](https://jammsession.mirror.xyz/W-8D5rqF9mTqnDC30HhLKZYSHQEZfDJmfmMQBRRWl5w)\n* [Alex Masmej on Decentralized Social Network](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej/status/1430286744100827137)\n* [Social Networking in 2030: How Could Crypto Change Things?](https://a16z.com/2019/08/29/social-networking-2030-crypto-regulatory-summit/)\n* [Status Monkeys](https://www.notboring.co/p/status-monkeys)\n* [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service)\n* [Why a Decentralized Social Network with Passive Income Potential Will Emerge, Eventually](https://hackernoon.com/why-a-decentralized-social-network-with-passive-income-potential-will-emerge-eventually-vg473e47)\n* [The dream of Interroperability](https://ff.mirror.xyz/3FKwvkwAPltEdhe4pWnL8RX7TNruwNNZcFAqNn92tUs)", "timestamp": 1632932129, "digest": "dLinNyXNIC9Z9QSYzkhvTuR4ZkIm1IJqsQHX6bcT8Gw", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

Crowdfunds on Mirror have used their native tokens to gate access to member-only spaces on Discord and coordinate decision making in governance.\n* **NFT Tiers**: While the reward tiers on Web2 crowdfunding platforms typically feature physical goods and merchandise, Mirror crowdfunds natively support NFTs. In just a few clicks, you can reward backers with digitally-native collectibles with the potential to grow in value and serve as membership in a community.\n* **Patron Podium**: Mirror crowdfunds support a reward tier called the Patron Podium that rewards the top three contributors with unique 1/1 NFTs. It’s a great way to distinguish the project’s superfans and top supporters, and introduces a competitive auction-like element to your campaign.\n* **Crowdfund Editor**: Finally, we spent the past few weeks rebuilding the crowdfund creation flow from scratch.

It has been continuously pointed out by critics, somewhat rightly so. For traditional startups, you either persuade users to adopt your product, or search for more capital — in order to get users. For crypto, suffice it to say that funding and deliverables may work via different mechanisms. It is still Very Early(TM) and many important foundational components are being built. However, that doesn’t mean we can’t speculate on the demographics of future users! Where are the masses? What will they look like when they finally materialise? For any emerging space, there’s a good chance appearances will diverge from initial expectations.\n\nThese questions are especially relevant for a project like [FOAM](https://foam.space/): a proposed network of synchronised radio receivers that hopes to provide ‘unspoofable’ geolocation authentication. For this write-up, the focus will be on the active operators of the FOAM protocol, not the parties which are paying for location attestations.\n\nAs is the case with every crypto network, motivated parties are integral to *co-creation* as mechanism maintainers (h/t to [Rhys Lindmark](https://medium.com/u/7e7962706fb8?source=post_page-----4f7a90aa536--------------------------------)). This includes activities such as node running, staking, slashing, relaying, signalling etc. This subset of users facilitates management and expansion of each protocol. Likewise, the FOAM protocol will rely on a network of incentivized actors to initiate and maintain the system of Zones and Zone Anchors for Proof of Location (PoL) services. Find more details about these specific components in the [whitepaper](https://github.com/f-o-a-m/public-research/blob/master/FOAM%20Techincal%20Whitepaper%20Draft.pdf).\n\nSimilar to PoW networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, technical knowledge will likely emerge as a precondition and may discourage people from participating (running specialised hardware, comfort learning new software / interfaces). Hardware details are forthcoming but generally it is expected to be the similar to the [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/), but using the [DASH7](http://haystacktechnologies.com/) radio protocol.\n\nIt’s important to also understand that the final mechanism parameters (e.g. staking thresholds) the team decides on may result in unanticipated effects for future participants. For example, if capital requirements are too high for staking or hardware, smaller players could be pushed out by larger ones.\n\n## IF YOU MAINTAIN IT, THEY WILL COME\n\nAt first blush, people learning about FOAM may assume Zones will be maintained by independent individuals. However, there are good reasons to believe individuals may end up as a minority within the network; this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If the mechanisms function as hoped there will be a healthy mix for all types of operators.\n\nThe following is a speculation on possible network operators, organised below according to their relative scale.\n\n**INDIVIDUALS**: The desire for pure decentralisation is an overwhelming theme in crypto. The smaller the party, the less centralised — and a smaller possibility for cascading failures. Private homeowner / operators costs will be limited to hardware acquisition and a bit of person-to-person networking to set up the minimum: four Anchors for a Zone. Individuals simply looking to experiment with the technology might run one zone with family / friends in their city.\n\nMotivations: tech enthusiast, decentralist ideology, anti-Big Brother, profit.\n\n**COLLECTIVES**: Extrapolating further from individuals, it’s easy to imagine groups forming with the specific objective of coordinating local FOAM coverage. This type of organisation would strike a good balance between the scale of a large company but the local knowledge of individual operators. Local collectives are intrinsically motivated through skin-in-the-game incentives: their efforts directly lead to better Zone coverage in their city. Collectives would likely thrive in niches where municipal bodies are not interested in participating (lack of time, funding) and companies cannot justify the investment into smaller addressable markets.\n\nLooking at other mechanisms within the FOAM ecosystem, also consider the benefits of pooled efforts with regard to curating POIs against malicious challenges, coordinating Zone placement for deployment efficiency, or signalling to maximise mining rewards (h/t [Paul Momoh](https://medium.com/u/1196722f31d8?source=post_page-----4f7a90aa536--------------------------------)). These are clear benefits that could lead individuals to coordinate.\n\nHowever, that’s not to say that there aren’t challenges present. Productive coordination layered on top of the base layer protocol incentives would require a form of consensus. Governance, the lurking bugbear of decentralisation, would certainly follow. The difficulty, of course, is to not allow the subsequent petty politics to remove the advantages achieved through coordination. Fortunately, there are many projects building tools for crypto-native strategising, including Aragon ([Luis Cuende](https://medium.com/u/5c21b8cae7aa?source=post_page-----4f7a90aa536--------------------------------)), [Colony](https://medium.com/u/d3a386f7b02e?source=post_page-----4f7a90aa536--------------------------------), and [DAOstack](https://medium.com/u/4a67575ee81c?source=post_page-----4f7a90aa536--------------------------------). It’s exciting to imagine possible synergies within the crypto-petri dish.\n\nMotivations: Local civic pride, community growth, profit.\n\n**INSTITUTIONAL ZONES**: This set includes malls, office parks, university campuses, industrial parks, Special Economic Zones (SEZs)— large expanses of private or limited access space.\n\nOne interesting condition here is the possibility for a non-competitive fee market. Imagine a sprawling manufacturing property that accepts sensitive deliveries. Their Zone is the only one accessible at that location, and they require location authentication upon delivery of goods. That is, prices for attestation may become artificially inflated given a monopoly over local nodes. External participants might be able to provide coverage for limited portions of the property edge, but this would only help to a certain extent.\n\nMotivations: May run their own Zones to ensure constituents have access to a well maintained system with superior coverage. Profit / monopolist advantage in the case of single providers + large area.\n\n**MUNICIPALITIES**: A city or urban area, with the local government running Zones as a public service. Several benefits include use of geographically distributed infrastructure like utility poles, trained workforce to install / maintain a large network at scale, ability to self-fund hardware acquisition through a tax. First responders would have a system more dependable than GPS.\n\nSimilar to institutional users, issues could arise from a maladjusted fee market. For example, if a local public network ends up partially subsidised it would disincentivise additional Zones from forming because of artificially depressed fees. Reaching further, if the government contracted out the network to a third party could their contract ban additional independent nodes? Granted, this appears unlikely, given it seems like a potential infringement on freedom of activity given that the protocol operates on an unlicensed radio spectrum.\n\nMotivations: public utility, offered at lower cost to verified city residents perhaps. More dependable geo-location for city services.\n\n\\*\\*PRIVATE COMPANIES: \\*\\*It seems this group will be the most impactful in the long-term build-out of the FOAM network (especially the later stages). Advantages emerge at scale which are hard to overstate. These include large hardware contracts, experience dealing with specialised tools and components, the ability to support in-house legal teams, access to pools of capital in order to finance regional expansions, developed synergies in managing network assets, etc.\n\nSeveral scenarios can be forecasted, possibly interwoven:\n\n* where one company focuses on a single city exclusively, leveraging existing relationships, knowledge for permitting\n* where a company achieves extensive horizontal integration, entering a variety of regional markets\n* a situation where municipalities or institutions contract a larger company (as previously mentioned) — this could also be the case for specific use cases or unusual conditions\n\nConsider the case where a company (Uber, FedEx) sees a particular market where location authentication would be an upsell — they are compelled to operate Zones because they recognise the long-term value it adds to a market.\n\nSimilar to a municipal operator, large companies can also eke out a coverage advantage through legal pressures. Consider that these companies may get owners of private property (think dense urban areas with high rises / condos) to sign “non-compete” agreements in exchange for a one time lump-sum or a % of future authentication fees. In effect, this would oblige owners to enforce Zone Anchor bans on their premises. Granted, this condition would ultimately be difficult to implement given the probable range of each Anchor. If actually carried out, it would unfortunately result in a less egalitarian protocol distribution.\n\nMotivations: Profit, adding to an existing service or product as an upsell.\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nThe next few years will be incredibly interesting as networks launch and iterate, verifying the soundness of their incentive theory. There will likely be other types of FOAM operators that haven’t considered and uncertain edges between categories. Variety in operator types would certainly add to the network’s Antifragility(TM).\n\nHopefully these thoughts will inspire other FOAM enthusiasts to think of more participant types and edge case behavior. I’m looking forward to the FOAM Utility Token Sale and participating in the network when it launches later this year.", "timestamp": 1632937461, "digest": "Rmtq3FLUvYcLaMFE1BHl6HXFVXjdbfM-H-xwQNq7Ibw", "contributor": "0x4C0a466DF0628FE8699051b3Ac6506653191cc21"}

You can learn more about what the organisation does [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap))\n\nI attended the conference as a FOAM community member hoping to see the perspective of people deeply involved in the mapping industry. In this article I will:\n\n1. Give a general overview of OSM and current data verification processes\n2. Look back on our experience at the conference along with feedback and reactions from participants\n3. Give a call to action for the OSM community on how FOAM can return verification back to local volunteers\n\n## WHAT IS OSM AND DATA VERIFICATION?\n\nOpenStreetMap is an initiative started in 2004 with the intent to provide an open and free alternative to other existing mapping solutions. From Wikipedia:\n\n> “The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices.”\n\nPeople from all around the world have participated in mapping their local areas for the past 14 years. By and large, it has worked remarkably well. The OSM community has seen steady growth up to the present and over [3 million changes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Stats) added per day to the global set.\n\n**One reason for OSM’s continued success in data collection has been the fact that anyone can join and edit.**\n\n> “Contributors include enthusiast mappers, GIS professionals, engineers running the OSM servers, humanitarians mapping disaster-affected areas, and many more.”\n\nHowever, precisely because of this open nature, there is always the problem of malicious users adding problematic data points; this includes data that is false, malicious or from copy-written sources (*[more on vandalism here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Vandalism)*). The most recent significant issue occurred at the end of August, where an OSM user changed the label for New York City to “Jewtropolis”. This was only one change of many, per the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/business/jewtropolis-map-new-york-snapchat.html):\n\n> “One of the \\[OSM\\] volunteers made more than 80 anti-Semitic or hate-oriented edits to locations around the world”\n\nThe malicious data ended up in front of end consumers that use the OSM base map, an outcome which they certainly would have liked to avoid. **Problems of data vandalism, paired with other issues like [raised rates elsewhere](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/features/google-maps-apis-new-pricing-impact-1907242)**, have encouraged the growth of enterprise verification on top of OSM. Services like this clean and sanitise data before it makes it to subscribing customers. One of the more prominent companies performing verification is [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), which sells access to their verified data to [corporate entities](https://www.mapbox.com/showcase/), including Snap, the NYT, and Mastercard.\n\n## ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS TO VERIFICATION\n\nAt SOTMUS, Mapbox presented a few of their solutions, one of which included quadrupling the number of human reviewers for every change they incorporate. Another encouraged the use of a central repository called [OSMCha](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSMCha) that many enterprise stakeholders would be able to use to cross-reference. Other strategies under development include AI and machine learning tools.\n\n![Presentation by Lukas Martinelli (Mapbox) at SOTMUS. Oct. 5th, 2018](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*DjXtg_KbrLeRSNGNPhlsWw.png)\n\n![Centralizing the Map](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*08uf-Es79YNbFQlIbhEvdQ.png)\n\nIt remains to be seen whether these solutions will be both effective and financially sustainable in the long-term. Zooming out, we can see a larger issue, and one which the community has been aware of for a while now: the ethical dilemma of monetising access to data mostly provided by volunteers.\n\nHow can local knowledge be accurately represented and updated? What mechanisms can ensure fresh POI data? In [his talk at SOTMUS](https://youtu.be/BDnzigWINaw?list=PLqjPa29lMiE08hjyWGcyNoCva4Str7XLk&t=792), Lukas Martinelli from Mapbox acknowledged the paramount importance of local knowledge:\n\n> “In the end the local contributor knows best. there are languages we don’t speak, … cultural references only you get, and that’s where the community comes in and map gardening needs to get better, we need better tools for that .. that the community can see issues, flag them, fix them, and also mark those bad edits and their hotfixes.”\n\n**FOAM agrees — mappers need to have the best tools and most effective frameworks to be successful as the community grows.**\n\nThe focus on enterprise solutions over time shifted the narrative away from the original OSM ethos of ground truth. Speaking with many attendees at the conference, it was clear that many others felt the same way — while great enterprise work was being done, it seemed like the passionate volunteers who had done much to grow the ecosystem had less and less influence. **Are there alternative models that can return value to the users who form the backbone of the community?**\n\n## WHAT IS FOAM’S APPROACH?\n\nWe were happy to share the larger FOAM ideals with the people who stopped by our booth. **At its core, FOAM is about keeping data verification and the economic incentives in the hands of the geospatial community, in line with OSM’s original vision.**\n\n> FOAM is about keeping data verification and the economic incentives in the hands of the geospatial community\n\nTo watch Ryan’s lightning talk on the FOAM map at SOTMUS, check out the first talk here:\n\nOur first products are the Spatial Index and the recently released FOAM Map. Both components are complementary within the FOAM vision to construct a new Web3.0 compatible location protocol.\n\n![It’s alive! Check it out at map.foam.space](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*I6hkdV93IfxJ00s_MK2H8A.png)\n\nHow does the POI mechanism work? Simply put, FOAM tokens are staked by mappers to a point, representing their confidence in the veracity of the POI data. Inaccurate POI data can be challenged by other cartographers. Successful challenges are then rewarded by distributing the previous stake to the participants that voted on the challenge side.

{"id": "PwI4O6rxzFlgoW-Bl_0GGnL1Wx9lP6bbq72TY3JcX0Q", "title": "ANALYSIS: HYDRO FORKING 0x", "body": "*This post was originally published December 16, 2018 on [Medium](https://trentv.medium.com/analysis-hydro-forking-0x-3d6faa9f4c2).*\n\n\n---\n\n*fork by Estu Suhartono from the Noun Project* \\n  \\n On Friday (14.12.18), [Hydro](https://thehydrofoundation.com/) announced that they would be forking the 0x protocol and releasing their own implementation. This is the team behind [DDEX](https://ddex.io/), the largest relayer in the 0x ecosystem by volume. Among other things, Hydro believes the native token (ZRX) introduces unwarranted friction. Read the announcement from Hydro in full here: [Why we are forking 0x](https://medium.com/hydro-protocol/why-we-are-forking-0x-97dc48ee0426).\n\nA Layer 2 project having a token forked away has been discussed hypothetically, but this is one of the first times we’re seeing it play out in the wild. In the context of real tokens and projects with major capital backing, proposing a fork holds a fair bit of weight. Will this be a significant challenge, mutually beneficial, or just a bunch of noise for naught?\n\n## 0x TOKEN (ZRX)\n\nFirst, some background on the 0x token. Crypto tokens generally fall into [distinct bucket](https://hackernoon.com/guide-to-crypto-token-types-6ce04edaba72)s, sometimes moving between buckets as limits are modified. Per the original whitepaper, ZRX was designed as a protocol, or utility, token: proper use of the platform and its services requires an integrated, native component. According to the authors:\n\n> Protocol tokens can align financial incentives and offset costs associated with organizing multiple parties around a single technical standard.\n\nBeyond simple network effects, transaction fees paid to Relayers are denominated in ZRX. Encouraging continuous use of the token ensures it “[converges on a representative sample of protocol stakeholders over time](https://blog.0xproject.com/governance-in-0x-protocol-86779ae5809e).” The primary intended benefit is to permit stakeholder participation in various governance activities. These include an ERC20 whitelisting process for trading on the platform, as well as an unspecified voting mechanism through which platform features are prioritised. Finally, there is an unmentioned use of the ZRX token — as a vehicle for fundraising. Setting aside current regulatory uncertainty, the 0x team was able to get significant fundraising via an ICO. This capital has allowed them to launch initiatives like the recently announced [Ecosystem Acceleration Program (EAP)](https://blog.0xproject.com/announcing-the-0x-ecosystem-acceleration-program-89d1cb89d565).\n\nThe WP goes on to state that:\n\n> 0x protocol and its native token will not impose unnecessary costs on users, seek rent or extract value from Relayers.\n\nWhile architecturally and philosophically this may be true, it’s clear the Hydro team has a strong conviction that there might be a better way.\n\n## HYDRO CLAIMS (A WILD UTILITY TOKEN APPEARS!)\n\nIn their recent post, Hydro claims there are several issues with the current 0x platform, including order collision, front-running, and poor liquidity. These challenges have been pointed out by other users in the space, including the founder of dYdX, Antonio Juliano, in a recent [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano/status/1073656925672230912).\n\nThere are outstanding questions with ‘rolling your own platform’. Do these issues warrant an entirely new protocol? Or would 0x network effects and aligned incentives outweigh the desire for reduced friction? Could they have been resolved through active governance participation?\n\nSomewhat paradoxically, the team already raised in excess of $31mm in a sale for its Hydro Protocol Token (HOT). Unfortunately for Hydro and its investors, the token is trading at [significant discounts](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hydro-protocol/) relative to the initial sale in January 2018. The uncharitable interpretation is that a new platform will support demand for HOT (read: price appreciation).\n\nAccording to the Hydro website, there are several key differences when compared to 0x (accessed 14.12.18). They make no mention of fee requirements for each trade, instead intending to use HOT for liquidity pool membership, liquidity incentive mechanisms, and bounties for market makers.\n\nLiquidity incentives could be structured similar to the [Uniswap design](https://hackmd.io/C-DvwDSfSxuh-Gd4WKE_ig#Providing-Liquidity) (read under Fee structure), where providers are rewarded with a cut of platform trades. It is unclear whether Hydro’s fork will use HOT or another, like ETH or DAI, to facilitate these mechanisms. Additionally, they claim front-running will be punishable via an as of yet undescribed governance mechanism.\n\nThe public will have to wait until Hydro releases its implementation for further analysis; until then all there is to reference are open claims and past work on DDEX.\n\n## GOVERNING VALUE VS. VALUING GOVERNANCE\n\nHydro claims 0x has neglected their core competency by rapidly expanding into other domains, like [Instant trade widgets](https://blog.0xproject.com/introducing-0x-instant-7314c786d743), NFTs, and ironically, governance. Although 0x has consistently reasoned that integrated governance will allow them to properly accommodate stakeholder needs, they have not implemented this system yet. Had it been, 0x might have been able to accommodate Hydro’s improvements (provided they were a value add) This is a chicken-egg paradox, echoed in a recent twitter poll from Tom Shaughnessy:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1090/1\\*7ESF_L-rPQO78QxmprBCBA.png)\n\n[https://twitter.com/Shaughnessy119/status/1072880352027381761](https://twitter.com/Shaughnessy119/status/1072880352027381761)\n\nBitcoin has been around for 10 years, Ethereum has been live since mid-2015. The projects built on top of them even younger and it shows: new tech is hard, and these challenges won’t resolve on their own. Determining the structure of governance mechanisms will be an evergreen problem as long as protocols have stakeholders.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*uZSI2Sl8QCF-402aMH58qQ.png)\n\nChicken or egg? Governance or value?\n\nIt’s important to remember that 0x has been one of the top teams in the Ethereum DeFi space, enabling tons of new experimentation. It’s also worth pointing out that projects are rarely forked like this unless there is *something worth forking*. Hydro’s protocol may or may not supersede 0x in the future, and that’s the beauty inherent in open-source development and permissionless markets. If a protocol design is better/faster/cheaper, users will move whether they like it or not (liquidity begets liquidity). Tian Li, the DDEX founder, summarizes the sentiment well in their forking announcement:\n\n> We either make something people want, or we die. And that’s the way it should be.\n\nThe entire space is looking forward to constructive developments from both teams and the continued growth of the DeFi ecosystem. A few things to keep track of over the next 6 months:\n\n* Will 0x feel pressure to develop and deploy governance processes faster?\n* 0x may implement some of Hydro mechanisms where applicable (already some hints)\n* Open question: Is there a better way to ensure live token distribution besides requiring fees in ZRX?\n* Will forking out a project token (and potentially replacing it with your native token) become more commonplace? What projects are ripe for this to happen to? \\n \n\n  \n---\n\n  For further context, 0x has released their response to Hydro, teasing some technical features that may match Hydro’s proposals and reaffirming their commitment to governance: [link here](https://blog.0xproject.com/ecosystem-update-ddex-and-the-0x-roadmap-5d201cafa133).\n\n  *Edit at 16–14–18 21:45 UTC: Here’s a [link](https://medium.com/@ivangbi/hydro-protocol-forking-0x-ddex-to-move-on-governance-and-cartels-inb-a16z-a59b463de20a) to an excellent perspective with thoughts on East vs. West VC cartels.

His talk contains some fascinating constructions that will likely see further iterating from teams in the space. This a crucial area of research because trust-minimised blockchain scaling mechanisms are still sorely needed for projects looking to grow their userbase. If you have the time I recommend listening to the full talk.\n\n[Recorded Livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOm47gBMfg8)\n\n[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EVjrZhoxw-ikzelFGGv7czxuJsIIWfl5I-CPIlnjsME/edit#slide=id.p)\n\n## PREVIOUS RESEARCH\n\nThe foundational concepts that this talk builds on first surfaced in an August 2018 post by Vitalik, crediting “[availability engines](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/08/26/layer_1.html)” to Justin Drake. In September 2018, an [ETHresearch post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/08/26/layer_1.html) expanding on the topic received significant discussion. In January 2019 a collaboration between EF researchers and Matter Labs produced a proof of concept called Ignis on the Rinkeby testnet. Here’s the [original post](https://medium.com/matter-labs/introducing-matter-testnet-502fab5a6f17) from the teams and a [Trustnodes interview / demo](https://www.trustnodes.com/2019/01/06/zksnarks-plasma-eth-scaling-solution-of-500-tx-s-launched-on-testnet).\n\nHere is a great talk from ETHDenver 2019 by Alex Gluchowski and Kent Barton with more details on the Rollup mechanism: [Scaling With Zero Knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=aEqhjpjoaEA). There is also a good exploration on the differences between SNARKs and STARKs.\n\nFinally, it looks like Matter Labs is continuing their work on scaling via snarks thanks to an EF grant — check the [announcement here](https://medium.com/matter-labs/grant-from-the-ethereum-foundation-for-matter-labs-64338f3dd938) along with more resources.\n\nI’ve typed up a rough transcript of Vitalik’s talk below that tries to capture the essence of each section. Hopefully people find this useful.\n\n## BACKGROUND / MASTERCOIN\n\n* Here’s a new kind of L2 construction — not the same as L2 for scalability (plasma / state channels) — which uses BC as a place for data storage and not computation. Computation can be done with zk-snarks.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/866/1\\*EqWnr0BfnX0u2auIExFjZQ.png)\n\n* Some history: think of Mastercoin as a meta protocol on top of BTC. Defines a different set of rules for interpreting tx. BTC is data store but not state execution. Special txs can be denoted by a flag.\n* Drawbacks to Mastercoin: Not light client friendly (need BTC blockchain and Mastercoin node). Activity in MC protocol cannot influence BTC chain, which limits overall functionality\n* Now we have ETH 1.0 and soon™ we will have ETH 2.0 — can we do something similar to Mastercoin?\n\n## ZK ROLLUP\n\n* ZK rollup (not ignis, not ignis plasma) can help with scalability by a factor of 30 today, higher in the future. How it works: Onchain contract only stores one value: the merkle root of a merkle tree\n\n![Merkle constructions will save us all](https://miro.medium.com/max/594/1\\*4SBIap20vNRisoKPm2qGhg.png)\n\n* Users send txs, which are gathered by a special actor called a relayer and put into a zKsnark. Publishes previous state, new state which includes transactions that were bundled together\n* Is this similar to Plasma? (both are contracts that hold merkle roots) Difference is that Plasma needs complex exit games / withdrawal periods in order to deal with possibility of malicious operators (data availability)\n* No data availability problem with zK Rollup because all transactions are published to chain, without signatures\n* 13 bytes per publish X 68 gas per byte = **884 gas** versus current cost of **21k** for simple tx currently\n* Instead of having ETH mainchain verify each signature transaction, the zKsnark proves tx validity. Computation and storage is moved offchain. Merkle root stays onchain. This avoids central operator / relayer. Because the data is published onchain, anyone can verify.\n* This can be improved by not including nonce, removes 2 bytes (11 bytes per publish X 68 gas per byte = **748 gas**)\n* Note: instant deposits and withdrawals. Withdrawals: Coins are moved from their merkle Branch to mainchain and then merkle root updates. A deposit would be the inverse, but additionally gives the user an account ID. There would possibly be many floating around.\n* This construction could increase simple payments from **15 tx/s** to **500 tx/s**, relatively safely.\n* One takeaway from Stanford 1.x workshop ([recorded livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpLyO8Q4ZZo)) was that data is overpriced relative to other operations. Though there are concerns with state, adding 1 kb to the blocksize will not make things much worse. Possibility that in Istanbul the gas cost of simple tx will be reduced, thus increasing throughput of ETH 1.x to over **1000 tx/sec**\n\n## TAKING ROLLUP FURTHER\n\n* Rollup should be able to support more complex state transitions, including things like Uniswap, high performance exchanges, multiple tokens, privacy preserving computation, ENS — all using “SNARK + publish tree details” paradigm.\n\n## ZK ZK ROLLUP (Bose–Einstein condensate 🙃)\n\n* Basic idea: take ZK rollup but with mini version of zcash inside. (primer on zCash: users publish txs with SNARKs saying “I have a valid spend certificate for some coin hash in the state. Here is a new coin hash”\n* zCash, continued — user has secret S, coin hash: h(s + 1), spend certificate: h(s + 2). SNARK proves that the spend certificate belongs to an existing coin, but not which one. Verification function should also check that spend certificate has not been revealed\n* The relayer wouldn’t be publishing txs, it would be publishing receipts (105 bytes X 68 gas = **7140 gas** per tx). Here we put a single SNARK which verifies that for every single tx included there is a SNARK attached (one level of recursion). Verifying SNARKs onchain, it would require 500k gas\n\n## BEACON CHAIN — PHASE 1\n\n* What if we wanted to do more? Enter Beacon Chain phase 1 of ETH 2.0. Shard chains as data-only chains means **2.8 MB/sec** of data availability\n* Each zK zK rollup is **105 bytes** / meaning **27k** privacy preserving transactions / sec if fully consuming the 2.8 MB. If we don’t care about privacy then that 27k increases by a factor of 10\n* Get rekt scamcoins LOL VB can’t even choose which is the worst at TPS claims\n* The barrier is that these systems rely on data and computation (albeit a tiny amount). ETH 2.0 (Phase 1) doesn’t have computation but lots of data, whereas ETH 1.0 has computation: Let’s bridge the two.\n\n## ETH2 IN ETH1 LIGHT CLIENT\n\n* ETH 2.0 research team has spent a lot of time making the 2.0 architecture light client friendly\n* Requires **80kb** of merkle branches per 9 days when persistent committees switch (also could be amortised over 9 days), plus **500 bytes** per header\n* Would need **BLS-12-381** precompile in ETH1 clients\n* ETH 1 chain could be computation layer that hooks into 2.0 chain, requires that data for roll-up schemas be published on 2.0 chain\n\n## OTHER USES FOR SCALABLE DATA AVAILABILITY ENGINES\n\n* Plasma chains w/ much more frequent commitments, Dapps storing messages onchain, blockchain protocols w/ independent (“sovereign”) state transition functions piggybacking on Ethereum for Data availability\n\n## SPEEDING UP CROSS-SHARD TRANSACTIONS\n\n* Weakness of current sharded design: communication between shards has a delay (waiting for crosslinks, \\~6 minutes)\n* The rough proposal to get around this latency is a mechanism that allows one shard to see the roots of another shard. This would probably work most of the time\n\n![good old Alice, Robert and Charles](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*h9XbrDO2u6h8UHetqPqKTg.png)\n\n* A quick exploration for when users want to transfer tokens between shards: they can publish tx to smart contract with root ( containing an expected token transfer), along with a security deposit\n* “merkle root of shard is 0x12345 and I agree to lose 100 ETH (the deposit) if this claim is wrong”\n* In the context of the registry storing token balances, user who posted 100 ETH deposit (while waiting for x-shard transaction to come through) then has their balance updated to a conditional state: if state root claim is correct I have x + transferred amt, if not correct I only have original amount (minus forfeited ETH deposit)\n* Think of it as quantum superposition inside of SC (storing both states / both possibilities). Only resolved once contract becomes aware of state root of original shard via crosslink\n* This superposition can then be transferred between users without them knowing (wallets would show optimistic values until \\~6 minutes later and the crosslink were actually sent through)\n\n## GENERAL PURPOSE PRIVACY\n\n* ZEXE: a UTXO based system that preserves privacy\n\n## BENEFITS OF LAYER 2 COMPUTATION\n\n* Philosophically, Layer 1 does not need to be overly complex to optimise properties — block-times, x-shard communications, x-shard synchronous messaging support, privacy, etc\n* Theoretically ETH 2.0 Phase 3 might be sufficient forever, no need for super quadratic sharding\n* Exception would be increasing shards or updating cryptography\n* Other blockchains have made this claim but the reality is once you have scalable data availability and enough expressivity at least to verify zKSnarks and state transitions (minimum threshold for power and complexity)you can build all necessary L2 on top\n* L1 might get harder and harder to change, but this is fine for computational L2 if they are on top of scalable data availability (2.8 mb / sec)\n\n## QUESTIONS\n\n**Q: Doesn’t L2 stuff preclude turing complete languages / won’t work with zKsnarks?**\n\nThere’s a difference between math definition of TC vs what crypto community means. Math: TC means computational lang. That are so general that you can’t tell when a computation will stop (Snark needs to know this beforehand)\n\nCrypto: uses TC to mean expressive enough to make applications with complex internal state (plasma, makerdao, uniswap, verification engines for these L2) BTC can’t do these things, ETH can. ZEXE is UTXO based model but can as well.\n\nTC is the wrong word but it is the case that you can do things that are expressive enough for constructing applications inside of zKsnarks.\n\n**Q: Should we be worried about the 30% hash rate loss during the bear market?**\n\nIt is an issue but not something really to worry about. ETC (Ethereum Classic)has been attacked but only has 3% hashrate of ETH chain. If it becomes a significant concern then Phase 0 can be used as a finality mechanism for the 1.0 chain POW clients. 51% attack would then only allow censoring blocks, not reverting blocks\n\n**Q: There will always be competition between degree of decentralisation between base layer and Application layer. Does data availability and SNARKs always mean centralisation? \\[partially inaudible\\]**\n\nThis new class of L2 is interesting - doesn’t need to solve for data availability issues. Centralisation can be reduced. Compare Plasma and Rollup: Plasma data availability problem means there needs to be an operator, who can then waste users time with 2 week coin lockup if malicious. Rollup has no data availability issue bc if a relayer disappears, another can quickly take their place. Possible harm is reduced, L2s like Rollup are part of the solution.\n\n**Q: Are you considering two phase commit protocol \\[inaudible\\] when doing cross-shard communication?**\n\nContract yanking helps to solve train and hotel problem. (interacting with 2 objects on different shards) Should the ETH chain support synchronous on L1? No, it introduces too much complexity.\n\nRight now, between two crosslinks you can calculate the state transitions in a shard as being a function of the data in a shard and the beacon chain. Doesn’t depend on what happens in other shards\n\nHaving synchronous cross-shard calls breaks this invariant, makes state calculation game much more complicated, though you could implement a L2 like Rollup that would help support synchronous cross-shard calls.\n\n**Q: What is the relationship between “third-party” L2 solutions (Celer) and other Ethereum L2 solutions?**\n\nCeler is a L2 that provides its own data availability solution, Plasma also does this. Rollup does computation offchain and has data availability handled onchain. Has different tradeoffs.\n\n\n---\n\nFind me [@trent_vanepps](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps) on twitter for discussion or corrections. ✌", "timestamp": 1632627129, "digest": "2LKCh3Aek4uahv66wvpEEQfws-pUY8TKaq_tM7Xe5Qc", "contributor": "0x4C0a466DF0628FE8699051b3Ac6506653191cc21"}
{"id": "fCvIbPTXbBde_KsweeeQ9pij6g-QehrEniFMovh_xPc", "title": "Zero Knowledge X Danny Ryan", "body": "*This post was originally published March 1, 2019 on [Medium](https://trentv.medium.com/zero-knowledge-x-danny-ryan-e3526cf61210).*\n\n\n---\n\n*Quick summary of key takeaways from Episode 66.*\n\nThe [Zero Knowledge podcast](https://www.zeroknowledge.fm/66) consistently puts out fantastic content and I recommend checking out their archive. Episode 66 featured [Danny Ryan](https://twitter.com/dannyryan) of the Ethereum Foundation and focused mainly what ETH 2.0 will look like and the process to get it to where it is today. If you are able, take the time and listen to the full thing.\n\nI pulled out things I found interesting for others to reference. This writeup assumes general knowledge of the Ethereum ecosystem and blockchains in general. Some of it paraphrases Danny’s words and some is my own commentary. Let’s jump right in!\n\n## **GUEST BACKGROUND**\n\n* Danny Ryan is from Louisiana.\n* He fell into the coordination role somewhat by chance because people found he was the only one to respond to their questions.\n* ETH 2.0 is acknowledgement that while Ethereum in general is awesome, there is a ton to learn from recent research. Evolution is necessary to remain a viable, system built on best practices.\n\n## ETH 1.X\n\n* Whether ETH 1.x becomes a shard is really a community question, a research question. Though there are some technical challenges depending on the option.\n* Option 1: Roll ETH 1.0 into 2.0 once it reached an acceptable stability. (but how?)\n* Option 1A: 1.x as exceptional shard construction — however, separate rules from other shards and a legacy code base is really bad combination. Also wouldn’t be compatible with forecasted need for state fees.\n* Option 1B (favored by danny): write EVM interpreter in WASM. deploy as contract on ETH2.0— fork state root into contract and ether balances, then users can interact with 1.0 state by providing “merkel witnesses.” The community could then deprecate maintenance for ETH 1.0 but still interact with the historic state. Stateless nature means there wouldn’t be any issues with state fees.\n* Option 2: allow legacy chain to operate in perpetuity. At this point there is potential to use ETH 2.0 to finalise 1.0, allowing mining rewards to decrease further.\n* Option 3: Have mining rewards be a function of how much ETH is left on ETH 1.0\n* Generally, he thinks there are “promises” that need to be upheld, like an Augur market related to Mars that expires in many years.\n\n## ETH 2.0 PREHISTORY\n\n* At the beginning of 2018 there were two parallel upgrades under development: Casper FFG and a sharding manager contract. Both would have “enshrined contracts” within the existing ethereum state to manage the complexity of POS logic and maintaining shards.\n* A lot of work was done on both options, Danny wrote EIP 1011. However, there were serious limitations to making both work on the existing chain. IE rate limiting (tx / sec) >> highly inefficient to process shards >> # of validators is limited >> in turn limits scalability and decentralisation.\n* The research team also realised that these two “foundational games” might compete with each other for blockspace and economic inputs. There were also roadblocks with EVM inefficiency. In May 2018, there was a turning point.\n* Some researchers took inspiration from other next efforts, including Dfinity. They needed to “break out of the EVM”, with benefits from more radical decisions.\n* This blank slate decision allows both the community and economic weight to seed the new chain. The research team can move faster, unencumbered — it’s incredibly difficult to engineer a new design onto a plane in flight.\n\n## ETH 2.0 ARCHITECTURE\n\n* Existing ETH chain will seed new POS chain that lives and exists in parallel. 1.0 will have a deposit contract (essentially a burn address). This emits a receipt that allows entrance to the beacon chain.\n* The Beacon chain is the core of ETH 2.0, where: validators exist, rewards and penalties happen, blocks are finalised, shard crosslinks occur, RNG (random number generator) mechanisms live. Danny terms it a “[spinechain](https://observablehq.com/@cdetrio/shasper-viz-0-4)” User accounts don’t live there, doesn’t have a virtual machine. (here’s an awesome [simulation / visualisation](https://observablehq.com/@cdetrio/shasper-viz-0-4) I came across!)\n* Anna asked how close it is to Polkadot’s relay chain. Danny says it is similar: It’s natural in POS systems for validators to congregate. This is where Casper and POS occurs, block justification and finalisation. POW doesn’t need this because RNG happens “extraprotocol”.\n\n## SHARD CHAINS\n\n* Shards exist outside of the beacon chain. Analogous to ETH 1.0 but there will be 1024 of them running concurrently.\n* Think of it like a growing tree, starting with the beacon chain as the trunk. Branches growing out are shards, sending water and energy (communications / txs) produced to the other branches via the central trunk. Leaves are addresses. (this seems like a really obvious analogy but I like how intuitive it is. Tell me where it breaks)\n* Shard chains host accounts, contracts, state and state execution.\n* Validators (on the beacon chain) are assigned to validate on a specific shard but also provide crosslinking between shards, approximately every 6 minutes. (spider webs or vines transferring kinetic energy?) They sit in small committees, ensuring that data is available between shards and helping to finalise points of the shard chain.\n* The number of crosslinks you can fit per block is dynamic, depending on the number of validators. With 4 million validators, the expectation is that all shards will be crosslinked to each other every epoch. (every 64 slots, about 6 minutes).\n* This method of communicating is asynchronous: meaning not occurring at the same time. It’s baked into the base layer. Synchronous calls cannot be included because it “explodes the complexity” in making ETH 2.0 work. Reorganisations on one shard could then lead to cascading reorgs on others. This would increase shard dependencies and increase system fragility.\n* Alternatives include: synchronous L2 proposals or encumbrances (contracts on different shards both enabled to signal promises that allow an actor to claim an asset once the beacon chain catches up — lol someone audit this explanation).\n\n## INTEROPERABILITY\n\n* Danny believes that interoperability is inevitable but cannot make a guess as to how many chains will exist. There might be long power tail of chains depending on their usage.\n* Fredrik asks where interoperability lives within ETH 2.0: would Polkadot link into the Beacon chain or one parachain per shard?\n\n## PHASE 1\n\n* This phase is where the system adds shard chains and data consensus.\n* There is also the possibility of finalising the ETH 1.0 chain via ETH 2.0.

{"id": "St3LR8rlkbTsGx9RPqNF9iXe2yQv-v0cJlAvwjRND8Q", "title": "Zero Knowledge X Danny Ryan", "body": "*This post was originally published March 1, 2019 on [Medium](https://trentv.medium.com/zero-knowledge-x-danny-ryan-e3526cf61210).*\n\n\n---\n\n*Quick summary of key takeaways from Episode 66.*\n\nThe [Zero Knowledge podcast](https://www.zeroknowledge.fm/66) consistently puts out fantastic content and I recommend checking out their archive. Episode 66 featured [Danny Ryan](https://twitter.com/dannyryan) of the Ethereum Foundation and focused mainly what ETH 2.0 will look like and the process to get it to where it is today. If you are able, take the time and listen to the full thing.\n\nI pulled out things I found interesting for others to reference. This writeup assumes general knowledge of the Ethereum ecosystem and blockchains in general. Some of it paraphrases Danny’s words and some is my own commentary. Let’s jump right in!\n\n## **GUEST BACKGROUND**\n\n* Danny Ryan is from Louisiana.\n* He fell into the coordination role somewhat by chance because people found he was the only one to respond to their questions.\n* ETH 2.0 is acknowledgement that while Ethereum in general is awesome, there is a ton to learn from recent research. Evolution is necessary to remain a viable, system built on best practices.\n\n## ETH 1.X\n\n* Whether ETH 1.x becomes a shard is really a community question, a research question. Though there are some technical challenges depending on the option.\n* Option 1: Roll ETH 1.0 into 2.0 once it reached an acceptable stability. (but how?)\n* Option 1A: 1.x as exceptional shard construction — however, separate rules from other shards and a legacy code base is really bad combination. Also wouldn’t be compatible with forecasted need for state fees.\n* Option 1B (favored by danny): write EVM interpreter in WASM. deploy as contract on ETH2.0— fork state root into contract and ether balances, then users can interact with 1.0 state by providing “merkel witnesses.” The community could then deprecate maintenance for ETH 1.0 but still interact with the historic state. Stateless nature means there wouldn’t be any issues with state fees.\n* Option 2: allow legacy chain to operate in perpetuity. At this point there is potential to use ETH 2.0 to finalise 1.0, allowing mining rewards to decrease further.\n* Option 3: Have mining rewards be a function of how much ETH is left on ETH 1.0\n* Generally, he thinks there are “promises” that need to be upheld, like an Augur market related to Mars that expires in many years.\n\n## ETH 2.0 PREHISTORY\n\n* At the beginning of 2018 there were two parallel upgrades under development: Casper FFG and a sharding manager contract. Both would have “enshrined contracts” within the existing ethereum state to manage the complexity of POS logic and maintaining shards.\n* A lot of work was done on both options, Danny wrote EIP 1011. However, there were serious limitations to making both work on the existing chain. IE rate limiting (tx / sec) >> highly inefficient to process shards >> # of validators is limited >> in turn limits scalability and decentralisation.\n* The research team also realised that these two “foundational games” might compete with each other for blockspace and economic inputs. There were also roadblocks with EVM inefficiency. In May 2018, there was a turning point.\n* Some researchers took inspiration from other next efforts, including Dfinity. They needed to “break out of the EVM”, with benefits from more radical decisions.\n* This blank slate decision allows both the community and economic weight to seed the new chain. The research team can move faster, unencumbered — it’s incredibly difficult to engineer a new design onto a plane in flight.\n\n## ETH 2.0 ARCHITECTURE\n\n* Existing ETH chain will seed new POS chain that lives and exists in parallel. 1.0 will have a deposit contract (essentially a burn address). This emits a receipt that allows entrance to the beacon chain.\n* The Beacon chain is the core of ETH 2.0, where: validators exist, rewards and penalties happen, blocks are finalised, shard crosslinks occur, RNG (random number generator) mechanisms live. Danny terms it a “[spinechain](https://observablehq.com/@cdetrio/shasper-viz-0-4)” User accounts don’t live there, doesn’t have a virtual machine. (here’s an awesome [simulation / visualisation](https://observablehq.com/@cdetrio/shasper-viz-0-4) I came across!)\n* Anna asked how close it is to Polkadot’s relay chain. Danny says it is similar: It’s natural in POS systems for validators to congregate. This is where Casper and POS occurs, block justification and finalisation. POW doesn’t need this because RNG happens “extraprotocol”.\n\n## SHARD CHAINS\n\n* Shards exist outside of the beacon chain. Analogous to ETH 1.0 but there will be 1024 of them running concurrently.\n* Think of it like a growing tree, starting with the beacon chain as the trunk. Branches growing out are shards, sending water and energy (communications / txs) produced to the other branches via the central trunk. Leaves are addresses. (this seems like a really obvious analogy but I like how intuitive it is. Tell me where it breaks)\n* Shard chains host accounts, contracts, state and state execution.\n* Validators (on the beacon chain) are assigned to validate on a specific shard but also provide crosslinking between shards, approximately every 6 minutes. (spider webs or vines transferring kinetic energy?) They sit in small committees, ensuring that data is available between shards and helping to finalise points of the shard chain.\n* The number of crosslinks you can fit per block is dynamic, depending on the number of validators. With 4 million validators, the expectation is that all shards will be crosslinked to each other every epoch. (every 64 slots, about 6 minutes).\n* This method of communicating is asynchronous: meaning not occurring at the same time. It’s baked into the base layer. Synchronous calls cannot be included because it “explodes the complexity” in making ETH 2.0 work. Reorganisations on one shard could then lead to cascading reorgs on others. This would increase shard dependencies and increase system fragility.\n* Alternatives include: synchronous L2 proposals or encumbrances (contracts on different shards both enabled to signal promises that allow an actor to claim an asset once the beacon chain catches up — lol someone audit this explanation).\n\n## INTEROPERABILITY\n\n* Danny believes that interoperability is inevitable but cannot make a guess as to how many chains will exist. There might be long power tail of chains depending on their usage.\n* Fredrik asks where interoperability lives within ETH 2.0: would Polkadot link into the Beacon chain or one parachain per shard?\n\n## PHASE 1\n\n* This phase is where the system adds shard chains and data consensus.\n* There is also the possibility of finalising the ETH 1.0 chain via ETH 2.0. Requires 1.0 clients to be light clients of 2.0 — this allows the most recent state root to be exposed. That way, clients on 1.0 can make claims about 2.0 data via Layer 2 mechanisms.\n* There is also a concept of “economic load balancing”, simply meaning that contracts / accounts on expensive shards will eventually self-distribute to less populated shards. This doesn’t guarantee complete homogeneity in shard traffic but will be a strong influence.\n* [“Yanking”](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-contract-yanking/1450) might be used to move correctly enabled contracts between shards.\n* Phase 1 research (shard consensus) is happening concurrent to the regular Phase 0 spec releases.\n\n## SPEC EVOLUTION\n\n* About 6 months ago the spec transitioned from a research to engineering project.\n* Research out in the open is a little different — feedback comes earlier in the process and more frequently.\n* After Casper deprecation it has settled into an iterative process, making things more elegant.

Please reach out to the people mentioned on gitter if you have more specific questions.*\n\n## 1. Transition from 1.0 to 2.0: are any hard forks required?\n\n**Justin**- Zero hardforks are needed. The only prerequisite would be to set up the deposit contract on 1.0. However, a hard fork on 1.0 could add the functionality of finality taken from 2.0. This allows issuance to be drastically reduced (factor of 10 or 20, near the security of Ethereum Classic). Every 6 minutes the chain is finalised, conceivably could come to rely only on transaction fees. Other benefit from finalisation is fungibility of the ETH token, two-way transfer between the two chains.\n\nFinalisation of blocks is an independent effort from 2.0. It is key that 1.0 clients are aware of the 2.0 chain — this is either as a full node of the beacon chain OR by being a light client of both. It will take time for this to occur, perhaps near Phase 1, sometime next year.\n\n## 2. Transition from 1.0 to 2.0: what is the path for Dapp developers?\n\n**Greg**- It might be too early. Could drain resources from both researchers and dapp developers to explore this now.\n\n**Zak**- Agrees it is too early, the spec isn’t entirely complete yet. No defined function for peering / communication mechanisms. Network layer needs to be solid before looking at application layer.\n\n## 3. Transition from 1.0 to 2.0: what is the timeline for dapps testing their work?\n\n**Mehdi**- The only thing available soon will be testnets. Lighthouse will have a testnet within the next few weeks. It’s too early to guide dapp developers on what their dapp might look like on 2.0: the EVM is deprecated by EWASM. Developers should look into EWASM.\n\n## 4. Token moving from 1.0 to 2.0- what does that look like?\n\n**Justin**- Deposits can be between 1–32 ether, these are locked in the deposit address (burner address). Within the beacon chain if you are not actively validating you can transfer between addresses (perhaps for arbitrage). This is purely a system chain, with no user transactions.\n\n## 5. Will there be economic abstraction in 2.0?\n\n**Justin**- Initially the beacon chain will have very limited throughput at 16 txs per block. Wouldn’t be a great mechanism to abstract fees. One research idea is a single unified Plasma chain to pay tx fees on any shard. This removes need for ether dust on every shard to pay for transactions. This problem of fee abstraction is more pressing in 2.0 than 1.0 (note, I think there may be a slight disconnect between the question and answer. Typically this refers to paying system transaction fees in something other than the base token, e.g. tokens paying tx fees in the place ether).\n\n**Carl**- The beacon chain can be considered a state machine: not designed for arbitrary computation, with a finite actions and systems to update. Not designed for general purpose computation.\n\n## 6. Will the randomness produced by the Beacon Chain be available to smart contracts (e.g. a dice game)?\n\n**Carl**- Yes. We now have a secure random beacon that can be used across the chain by dapps. Unbiasable and with the same properties that are used in consensus.\n\n## 7. What will happen to smart contracts that are on 1.0? Migration?\n\n**Justin**- If you have a 1.0 contract with a long projected life, the 1.0 chain will most likely live on for decades. However, it’s important that it remains sustainable, issuance needs to not be that high. This can be accomplished through 2.0 finalisation, might be able to live on transaction fees alone. Other approach would be to embed 1.0 chain as a contract within 2.0 — this seems ambitious as an engineering question. Is it worth the time and effort?\n\n## 8. Will the ETH 1.0 chain be isolated?\n\n**Justin**- At the very least you would be able to transfer Ether between both chains.\n\n**Carl**- Merkel roots of data from ETH 1.0 chain can be included on 2.0 chain (proving accounts).\n\n## 9. Why is it necessary to reduce issuance on 1.0? If there is a chain reorg on 1.0 a year into the new chain, how would that affect 2.0?\n\n**Justin**- Issuance can be reduced because 1.0 is finalised by 2.0. At most it could be a 6 minute reorg from a bad miner. Issuance should be reduced because it is expensive for investors to get continuously diluted — ideally would be .5% for the entire Ethereum system. Secondly, it is environmentally expensive. With POS you get better security for a cheaper price.\n\n## 10. For dapp developers considering other chains who may launch sooner, how will this affect the 2.0 product?\n\n**Greg**- We live in a multi-chain future. If dapps want to move to other chains they will, but their users might not. Layer 2 solutions will likely fill that deficiency before forcing dapps to move to other chains.\n\n## 11. Could the deposit address on 1.0 be read by contracts on 2.0, allowing for some communication? What does the migration path actually look like?\n\n**Carl**- Goes back to the idea of using merkel roots to include data, same conditions apply if 2.0 is finalising 1.0. Long term it depends on what happens with 1.0 (1.x, EWASM), if there is a WASM interpreter running in a shard then data will be more accessible.\n\n**Zak**- Keep building / developing as you are, but anticipate that you may have to restart / redeploy on 2.0. Will present fewest vulnerabilities and security issues.\n\n**Diederik**- If the 1.0 chain keeps running, you wouldn’t want to run on both at the same time. May want to stop support on 1.0, take state roots of the dapp and reinitialise on 2.0. Doesn’t need to be defined in the protocol.\n\n## 12. How would you know which shard your contract gets deployed on? What do cross-shard calls look like?\n\n**Carl**- It will be your choice, each will have different gas markets which will lead to economic load balancing.\n\n**Lane**- Considered baking the load balancing into the protocol but it was incredibly complicated. Population density / cost of living analogy. Higher densities might have network effects but there are also costs associated with it. Yanking will also allow for asynchronous contract movement between shards.\n\n**Justin**- Cross shard calls is a design space with tradeoffs, no single answer, like Plasma. People will try different things and standards will emerge. One thing to consider is that there will be basic infrastructure at the protocol layer in the form of crosslinks. This is a way for every shard to have light client access to other shards. Most likely there will also be basic asynchronous cross-shard calls. This works by having a special contract on each shard that burns ether sent to it. The burn generates a receipt which can then be consumed on the shard on the other end of the transaction as soon as the sending shard has been finalised through the beacon chain.\n\n## 13. Would transactions (contract calls) spanning multiple blocks be feasible or is it better to deploy all contracts a tx might touch on a single shard?\n\n**Justin**- Latency from basic infrastructure would be one epoch, 6 minutes. To get anything faster you can also experiment with optimistic approaches. Assume that the checkpoint will be finalised but don’t wait for it, and then layer your next actions on top of that. If for some exceptional reason this does not occur there would be a revert mechanism built in. The design space opens up here — you can trade off certainty of execution vs. latency.\n\n## 14. As core researchers how can we listen to and respond to the concerns of dapp developers?\n\n**Lane**- Reddit AMAs, had a 2.0 AMA recently.\n\n**Justin**- One of the biggest concerns for 2.0 will be storage fees. Good news is that there is movement in the form of 1.x which will help give feedback. This also applies to the Plasma research, state channels, etc. Getting close to world computer will require these Layer 2 solutions.\n\n**Lane**- None of the 2.0 work requires a 1.0 hard fork, however, there will be experimental efforts like storage fees that will likely take place via a 1.0 HF. EWASM is also important on this front.\n\n## 15. VDF (verifiable delay function) ELI5? What is the difference between a VDF and POW today?\n\n**Justin**- We need VDFs to get a very high quality of randomness. RANDAO gets a pretty good version but these together get basically perfect randomness. ELI5: There are \\~100 people in a dark room, with a die in the middle. They are asked to roll the die, however some do not participate honestly because they are asleep or malicious. They cannot see the die. If there is only one honest person rolling the die, then the end result is no one can know what the final value will be. VDFs provide a mechanism to keep the lights off for a preset period of time and not before. It’s an artificial delay mechanism for seeing the unique answer that will only be seen at a future time. Malicious actors are constrained by physics.\n\n## 16. What is the perceived value with VDFs?\n\n**Justin**- Originally the idea was to harden the consensus layer because RANDAO is vulnerable to two attacks. In RANDAO, the last entity invited to reveal in an epoch can choose to not reveal — this biases the randomness by one bit. In the “last revealer attack” if they somehow manage to control the last 3 slots, then they can control 3 bits of attack surface (8 random number possibilities). If randomness can be biased in one epoch, malicious actors can use that bias even more in the next epoch —meaning you push your slot closer to the reveal period. This is called the “amplification attack”: if you control 35% of the stake, you would be able to put yourself in the last revealer position 50% of the time.\n\nTo address these biases at the protocol layer, we have security margins. One way is to have stronger assumptions, ie, that people are honest. If there were better randomness, your assumption that 70% of the network is honest can be reduced to 66%.\n\nA second, more tangible value for strong randomness (VDF) is at the application layer. Would be incredibly important for something like a billion $ lottery, where one biased bit of randomness increases the odds of payout for large players.\n\n## 17. How do implementer teams make sure your clients talk to each other?\n\n**Mehdi**- Biweekly implementer calls help to coordinate the teams on development. In terms of the protocol layer, there are also test vectors set by the Ethereum Foundation which each implementation is on par with the specification. Will hopefully see a multi-client testnets in a few weeks time.\n\n## 18. What are the biggest challenges facing implementers?\n\n**Mehdi**- Funding. This problem is not unique to the Ethereum space, affects all of open source. Need to find sustainable business models. Another challenge is balancing between their current work and staying up to date with the spec.\n\n**Greg**- The Chainsafe implementation in Javascript has seen issues with numbers. How to properly handle this with regard to communication between clients? Also difficult when the spec is not versioned, however this has been fixed recently by the research team.\n\n**Mehdi**- The naiive implementation of the spec would not work, would require a lot of optimisation. This is a requirement on top of the spec implementation.\n\n## 19. When should specification optimisations occur?\n\n**Diederik**- There is a tradeoff between optimising prematurely or researching for a better solution.\n\n**Carl**- From a spec writing perspective we have optimised for readability. It should be easy to understand. The research team has been moving away from a plaintext script towards python executables (exe). They want clients to come up with different optimisations to solve problems in different ways. Trying to avoid all clients failing in the same way and possibly missing better optimisations. If everyone is focused on different methods of achieving the naiive spec this is probably better for the health of the ecosystem in the long run.\n\n**Greg**- We need client competition to a certain degree. Client specific optimisations on top of a barebones spec leads to different tradeoffs.\n\n**Mehdi**- Simplicity was certainly a design goal for Ethereum Serenity. The spec does not necessarily need to have all client optimisations built into it. He views the client as a public good.\n\n**Lane**- It’s part of the Ethereum ethos to have multiple implementations (as compared to Zcash or Bitcoin). Important to point out that there have been consensus failures, it’s a useful method to catch bugs.\n\n## 20. What is the advantage to having more than 2–3 client implementations?\n\n**Lane**- There might be diminishing returns.\n\n**Diederik**- In terms of ETH 2.0 it’s important that large groups of validators do not fail at the same time if their client has the same bug. Diversity is healthy for the validator ecosystem.\n\n**Zak**- Language differences play a part. Different clients can be more modular depending on the usecase. There is a lack of standards / specifications for what clients are required to do — will lead to healthy competition.\n\n**Greg**- Diminishing returns are real, probably already. First, the spec is not quite finished and bugs are being found. Case in point, being able to transfer on the Beacon Chain activates validators and then they are being slashed because they aren’t aware. Second, readability is huge. The spec is complex, not everyone knows Rust. Third, contributions to upstream libraries. All the teams need libp2p so all each language is completing what they need, leading to a more unified feature set. ([Looks at camera:](https://youtu.be/r8235mBjHSs?t=24645) Dean, we don’t need a client in swift)\n\n**Lane**- Readability is important. The yellow paper is challenging to understand, he finds the Trinity source code easier. Reading the client implementation might be easier than digesting math for developers. There is also other types of experimentation going on, e.g. business models.\n\n## 21. What project coordination would be helpful for both developing the spec and helping across teams?\n\n**Greg**- Happens in gitter or side communications between implementers. The researchers are doing an incredible job letting people know what’s up, Danny especially. We’re still in the research phase, though very close to finalising. Additional formal coordination isn’t necessary quite yet, perhaps when the cross-client testnets are closer it might be more important.\n\n**Mehdi**- Agree, Danny is doing an amazing job. It’s also difficult in a decentralised environment because no one formally told him to do it. Wouldn’t work in a commercial context, a researcher acting as a project manager would be unheard of.\n\n**Greg**- Implementers call standup gives a good enough of an understanding between client teams. With a cross-client testnet it will come down to implementers chatting with each other.\n\n**Zak**- A working multi-client testnet has been challenging. Need conformance tests, performance metrics, functional docker files. Might be good to have Cat Herders coordinate a multi-client testnet, should not be the responsibility of the client developers. Please try to move away from writing everything to memory.\n\n**Diederik**- Need to shift from single to multi-client testnets. This is difficult because there is still undefined pseudo-code in the spec. There are plans to formalise these parts of the spec. They want big picture test vectors to make sure clients generally confirm state transitions and also agree on networking.\n\n## 22. What is the ETH 2.0 roadmap? How has it evolved?\n\n**Justin**- The roadmap is bigger than the spec, which only refers to Phase 0. The roadmap has evolved significantly over the years, up until recently it was primarily driven by the research team (Vitalik and Vlad mostly). The roadmap is changing in relatively smaller ways. One example is the addition of transfers — will the BETH token be fungible, will there be tax implications? It was a low hanging change. Phase 0, 1 and 2 are pretty well defined — what come after is more blurry. They would like to have a quantum secure chain after that, part of the reason they gave the grant to Starkware. Starks are probably powerful enough to handle all of those problems, including signature aggregation (replacing BLS signatures), can be useful for VDFs. Another non-quantum secure part is randomness — whereas right now they use BLS signatures, there is a new design requirement for ETH 2.0: it should be friendly to MPCs (n of m staking pools).\n\n## 23. What’s one thing you would change about the roadmap if you could?\n\n**Diederik**- In the short term, from Phase 0 to 1 there is room for concurrent research on how shards can be upgraded individually.\n\n**Mehdi**- We had to throw away a lot of Rust code but we learned a lot, it’s fine. One thing they would have done differently is to maybe wait until a release candidate was ready. Much better now with releases and a change log.\n\n**Greg**- Disagrees with the Kyokan report claim that there isn’t input from implementers to researchers, he can still ask questions.\n\n**Zak**- Thinks there should be more formal verification. Should be a feedback between formal verification and the eventual spec changes. Formal verification is is like establishing a blueprint for a building. Should occur before construction begins.\n\n## 24. Is there any interaction between the EEA and the ETH 2.0 efforts?\n\n**Zak**- There is not much interaction or interest in 2.0. They are focused on enterprise implementations, 2.0 seems too far into the future. Too early to say what will happen in the future.\n\n## 25. What is the best way to approach “execution engines” in Phase 2 (look at EVM, consult with dapp devs)? Where is the best place to discuss these ideas?\n\n**Zak**- [ethereum-magicians.org](https://ethereum-magicians.org/) OR [ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/). Gitter is a great place to voice your opinion.\n\n**Greg**- For dapp devs they can still contribute to EWASM issues, join some gitters, github issues. Just because you don’t write code doesn’t mean you can’t contribute.\n\n**Lane**- All avenues are developer friendly, perhaps not for non-developers. Cat herders are a great way to get involved if you are non-technical. Build a design ring if you are a designer.\n\n\n---\n\nHopefully people find this helpful.

While L1 scaling is realised through incremental code upgrades, L2 comes in the form of higher level external systems that leverage the greater security of the basechain.\n\nCanto’s unique value proposition emerges as a hybrid with a foot in both camps.

If you’re short on time or technicals, follow along as we jump into what makes Canto an idea worth pursuing.\n\n## ORIGIN\n\nThe idea for Canto came up over beers between [Antoine Toulme](https://twitter.com/_tmio) (Consensys) and [Zak Cole](https://twitter.com/0xzak) (Whiteblock) in November 2018. Their discussion focused on a few roadblocks: ETH 2.0 is going to take some time and there’s no guarantee that ETH 1.0 (1.x) improvements would all be implemented. How could they help push Ethereum forward with the current environment? From this frustration Canto was born. The name comes from poetry, referring to “one of the major divisions of a long poem.”\n\nFollowing this initial brainstorm and some work, Will Meister (Consensys) and Daniel Choi (Whiteblock) were brought in to hash out some of spec details.\n\n## ARCHITECTURE: SUBPROTOCOLS\n\nConceptually, Canto is simple: the proposal hinges on a new Ethereum subprotocol. Every up-to-date ETH client includes four subprotocols, denoted by a short prefix: eth, les (light clients) shh (whisper), and bzz (swarm). The subprotocols facilitate important activities onchain in addition to the basic functions of the network.\n\n![Antoine explaining Ethereum subprotocols](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*JlW4an2qWUm3qqxc87mI4g.png)\n\nHere’s a quick analogy. Imagine a client as a smartphone that only has 4 apps installed. Connecting users is limited to the design of only these 4 apps. Of course, this smartphone still allows people to do productive things, but what if another app could be added? Canto’s new app is a subprotocol named “can.”\n\n“Can” would allow the creation of subnets, a catch-all term from networking: if Ethereum is the top-level network, Canto makes sub-networks that reside within it. These are flexible constructions that allow incredible design diversity, encompassing the potential of Plasma-like sidechains, novel testnets, ephemeral interactions, channels, games, and [more](https://github.com/canto-ethereum/spec/blob/master/canto.md#examples).\n\nBeing embedded within a client at L1, but also facilitating an expressive L2. It permits mainchain to subnet communication while in the form of a client-integrated mechanism generator. It’s difficult to overemphasise how beneficial this arrangement is when compared to Plasma chains that have gone live. These require extensive coordination between operators and validators, maintenance, and monitoring to remain viable. While there are benefits like dependability and security, the marginal cost for each new chain is still quite high. This prevents rapid iteration and optimization of parameters for unique uses.\n\nHere’s a rough equivalent: the role the ERC20 standard played during the 2017 runup. A thousand flowers (and some weeds) bloomed:\n\n![This is why we can’t have nice things.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*fABBCQGv4jGJeaijy7AfTw.png)\n\nWhile some projects may have considered launching their own chains, the absence of hash-security combined with the network effects an ERC20 utility token precluded the notion (exchange support, existing high-quality code, etc.). Similarly, Canto could facilitate the coordination node services, operators, validators and users in a streamlined mechanism. Granted, hindsight shows that the majority of ERC20s were poorly designed, unnecessary, or outright scams. For better or worse, the barrier for ephemeral economies has dropped significantly.\n\nA final comparison between ICOs and Canto is the role of ETH in this ecosystem. ETH from fundraising served first as operational runway for legitimate efforts, while the less scrupulous took large paydays and ran. Comparatively, Canto allows ETH to remain onchain as a staked bond placed in order to create the subnet. This further removes the need for high-stakes fundraising in deference to small scale experimentation.\n\nThe coordination process surrounding this creation would naturally accrue to marketplaces — see [Livepeer’s Transcoder Explorer](https://explorer.livepeer.org/transcoders) for a good example of service providers differentiating around a few simple variables.\n\n![Livepeer Transcoder Explorer](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*8O1GGcLwSAT4VA53eHzsGQ.png)\n\nIn Canto, the design space expands from 1 to N dimensions. To start, there are the initialising parameters: consensus mechanism, privacy, gas economics, whether to implement research initiatives like state rent, among others. Will the subnet communicate with other subnets? How will node operators be rewarded? Templates, and template companies a la Wordpress, will spring up in and around these marketplaces. There is also room for the generalized mining narrative to thrive, as facilitators and supporters of subnet economies.\n\nSecond order effects of Canto, will be interesting to follow as it develops traction within the community.\n\n## SMART CONTRACTS\n\nEvery subnet begins and is maintained through the same core of contracts, hosted on the Main ETH chain — however, the spec [section on Contract Creation](https://github.com/canto-ethereum/spec/blob/master/canto.md#canto-smart-contract-design) is a better source for technical readers.\n\n![Routing, Factory & Gateway Contracts](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*MxdtFTjcYBMRy7UhUab2Jg.jpeg)\n\n## COMPARED TO PLASMA\n\nThough Canto may initially appear similar to Plasma, there are some important distinctions between them.\n\n**Similarities:**\n\n* Both are L2 scaling solutions\n* Both require some degree of coordination to kick off the network\n* Shared challenges in the design of mass exit mechanisms (load balancer back to mainnet).\n\n**Differences:**\n\n* Canto ships with native flexibility when it comes to hardware and validator requirements. Discussed previously, Plasma requires significantly more coordination, whereas Canto might start as a wild west marketplace predicated on degrees of reputation.\n* Smart Contracts on Plasma are a challenge — read [“Why is EVM-on-Plasma hard?”](https://medium.com/@kelvinfichter/why-is-evm-on-plasma-hard-bf2d99c48df7) from [Kelvin Fichter](https://medium.com/u/60c1f53c90d?source=post_page-----5f8f3a6f7dad--------------------------------).\n\n## COMPARED TO POLKADOT\n\nOutside of Ethereum proper, Canto might also resemble [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/#cover), a Parity project; again, there are important differences.\n\n**Similarities:**\n\n* Both are systems of smaller ‘dapp-chains’ that coordinate around a connecting base chain.\n* Both enable smart contracts.\n\n**Differences:**\n\n* Canto is a ‘plug and play’ solution that runs within Ethereum, while Polkadot on a separate blockchain with a new architecture.\n* Polkadot has a more rigid architecture that only allows for PoS — while the Ethereum basechain only permits PoW currently. Canto offloads onchain activity to to flexible subnets that can be PoW, PoS, PoA\n* Canto’s subnets are [“logically isolated from one another, responsible for their own security and function”](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/canto-a-scalable-blockchain-system-interconnect-model/2203/7) while Polkadot’s parachains require interoperation in order to pool security collectively.\n* Every parachain on Polkadot operates under on-chain governance. Canto leaves any governance (or lack of it) up to each subnet to decide.\n\n## REMAINING ROADBLOCKS\n\nWhile Canto is conceptually straightforward, there are still challenges that might slow implementation and the growth of a mature ecosystem.\n\nTo start, there’s the actual process to get a subprotocol implemented in a client. Aside from “eth”, light client support launched in [January 2017](https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/01/07/introduction-light-client-dapp-developers/), Swarm in [December 2016](https://btcmanager.com/new-release-of-ethereums-client-geth-awakens-the-swarm/), when the fledgling ecosystem was relatively small. Given the push today towards ETH 2.0 (and ETH 1.0, 1.x), it’s fortunate that that Canto doesn’t require a hard fork. A single client is all that’s needed to start demonstrating utility, but getting one onboard will take some effort.\n\nAdditionally, exit conditions still need to be developed and iterated on. Hopefully the developers will be informed by the large design space growing around Plasma. This is an open area of research that will need careful attention prior to release.\n\nI’m looking forward to seeing development progress over the coming months. Hopefully sometime soon the larger Ethereum ecosystem will get to explore the capabilities of subnets.\n\n\n---\n\n## WHAT’S NEXT FOR THE TEAM\n\nTo start, they are continuing to build out PoCs in Java and Go. You can track their Github progress [here](https://github.com/canto-ethereum) (broken link).\n\nThanks to Antoine ([@_tmio](https://twitter.com/_tmio)) and Zac ([@0xzak](https://twitter.com/0xzak)) for answering my questions and being super helpful.

His talk contains some fascinating constructions that will likely see further iterating from teams in the space. This a crucial area of research because trust-minimised blockchain scaling mechanisms are still sorely needed for projects looking to grow their userbase. If you have the time I recommend listening to the full talk.\n\n[Recorded Livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOm47gBMfg8)\n\n[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EVjrZhoxw-ikzelFGGv7czxuJsIIWfl5I-CPIlnjsME/edit#slide=id.p)\n\n## PREVIOUS RESEARCH\n\nThe foundational concepts that this talk builds on first surfaced in an August 2018 post by Vitalik, crediting “[availability engines](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/08/26/layer_1.html)” to Justin Drake. In September 2018, an [ETHresearch post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/08/26/layer_1.html) expanding on the topic received significant discussion. In January 2019 a collaboration between EF researchers and Matter Labs produced a proof of concept called Ignis on the Rinkeby testnet. Here’s the [original post](https://medium.com/matter-labs/introducing-matter-testnet-502fab5a6f17) from the teams and a [Trustnodes interview / demo](https://www.trustnodes.com/2019/01/06/zksnarks-plasma-eth-scaling-solution-of-500-tx-s-launched-on-testnet).\n\nHere is a great talk from ETHDenver 2019 by Alex Gluchowski and Kent Barton with more details on the Rollup mechanism: [Scaling With Zero Knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=aEqhjpjoaEA). There is also a good exploration on the differences between SNARKs and STARKs.\n\nFinally, it looks like Matter Labs is continuing their work on scaling via snarks thanks to an EF grant — check the [announcement here](https://medium.com/matter-labs/grant-from-the-ethereum-foundation-for-matter-labs-64338f3dd938) along with more resources.\n\nI’ve typed up a rough transcript of Vitalik’s talk below that tries to capture the essence of each section. Hopefully people find this useful.\n\n## BACKGROUND / MASTERCOIN\n\n* Here’s a new kind of L2 construction — not the same as L2 for scalability (plasma / state channels) — which uses BC as a place for data storage and not computation. Computation can be done with zk-snarks.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/866/1\\*EqWnr0BfnX0u2auIExFjZQ.png)\n\n* Some history: think of Mastercoin as a meta protocol on top of BTC. Defines a different set of rules for interpreting tx. BTC is data store but not state execution. Special txs can be denoted by a flag.\n* Drawbacks to Mastercoin: Not light client friendly (need BTC blockchain and Mastercoin node). Activity in MC protocol cannot influence BTC chain, which limits overall functionality\n* Now we have ETH 1.0 and soon™ we will have ETH 2.0 — can we do something similar to Mastercoin?\n\n## ZK ROLLUP\n\n* ZK rollup (not ignis, not ignis plasma) can help with scalability by a factor of 30 today, higher in the future. How it works: Onchain contract only stores one value: the merkle root of a merkle tree\n\n![Merkle constructions will save us all](https://miro.medium.com/max/594/1\\*4SBIap20vNRisoKPm2qGhg.png)\n\n* Users send txs, which are gathered by a special actor called a relayer and put into a zKsnark. Publishes previous state, new state which includes transactions that were bundled together\n* Is this similar to Plasma? (both are contracts that hold merkle roots) Difference is that Plasma needs complex exit games / withdrawal periods in order to deal with possibility of malicious operators (data availability)\n* No data availability problem with zK Rollup because all transactions are published to chain, without signatures\n* 13 bytes per publish X 68 gas per byte = **884 gas** versus current cost of **21k** for simple tx currently\n* Instead of having ETH mainchain verify each signature transaction, the zKsnark proves tx validity. Computation and storage is moved offchain. Merkle root stays onchain. This avoids central operator / relayer. Because the data is published onchain, anyone can verify.\n* This can be improved by not including nonce, removes 2 bytes (11 bytes per publish X 68 gas per byte = **748 gas**)\n* Note: instant deposits and withdrawals. Withdrawals: Coins are moved from their merkle Branch to mainchain and then merkle root updates. A deposit would be the inverse, but additionally gives the user an account ID. There would possibly be many floating around.\n* This construction could increase simple payments from **15 tx/s** to **500 tx/s**, relatively safely.\n* One takeaway from Stanford 1.x workshop ([recorded livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpLyO8Q4ZZo)) was that data is overpriced relative to other operations. Though there are concerns with state, adding 1 kb to the blocksize will not make things much worse. Possibility that in Istanbul the gas cost of simple tx will be reduced, thus increasing throughput of ETH 1.x to over **1000 tx/sec**\n\n## TAKING ROLLUP FURTHER\n\n* Rollup should be able to support more complex state transitions, including things like Uniswap, high performance exchanges, multiple tokens, privacy preserving computation, ENS — all using “SNARK + publish tree details” paradigm.\n\n## ZK ZK ROLLUP (Bose–Einstein condensate 🙃)\n\n* Basic idea: take ZK rollup but with mini version of zcash inside. (primer on zCash: users publish txs with SNARKs saying “I have a valid spend certificate for some coin hash in the state. Here is a new coin hash”\n* zCash, continued — user has secret S, coin hash: h(s + 1), spend certificate: h(s + 2). SNARK proves that the spend certificate belongs to an existing coin, but not which one. Verification function should also check that spend certificate has not been revealed\n* The relayer wouldn’t be publishing txs, it would be publishing receipts (105 bytes X 68 gas = **7140 gas** per tx). Here we put a single SNARK which verifies that for every single tx included there is a SNARK attached (one level of recursion). Verifying SNARKs onchain, it would require 500k gas\n\n## BEACON CHAIN — PHASE 1\n\n* What if we wanted to do more? Enter Beacon Chain phase 1 of ETH 2.0. Shard chains as data-only chains means **2.8 MB/sec** of data availability\n* Each zK zK rollup is **105 bytes** / meaning **27k** privacy preserving transactions / sec if fully consuming the 2.8 MB. If we don’t care about privacy then that 27k increases by a factor of 10\n* Get rekt scamcoins LOL VB can’t even choose which is the worst at TPS claims\n* The barrier is that these systems rely on data and computation (albeit a tiny amount). ETH 2.0 (Phase 1) doesn’t have computation but lots of data, whereas ETH 1.0 has computation: Let’s bridge the two.\n\n## ETH2 IN ETH1 LIGHT CLIENT\n\n* ETH 2.0 research team has spent a lot of time making the 2.0 architecture light client friendly\n* Requires **80kb** of merkle branches per 9 days when persistent committees switch (also could be amortised over 9 days), plus **500 bytes** per header\n* Would need **BLS-12-381** precompile in ETH1 clients\n* ETH 1 chain could be computation layer that hooks into 2.0 chain, requires that data for roll-up schemas be published on 2.0 chain\n\n## OTHER USES FOR SCALABLE DATA AVAILABILITY ENGINES\n\n* Plasma chains w/ much more frequent commitments, Dapps storing messages onchain, blockchain protocols w/ independent (“sovereign”) state transition functions piggybacking on Ethereum for Data availability\n\n## SPEEDING UP CROSS-SHARD TRANSACTIONS\n\n* Weakness of current sharded design: communication between shards has a delay (waiting for crosslinks, \\~6 minutes)\n* The rough proposal to get around this latency is a mechanism that allows one shard to see the roots of another shard. This would probably work most of the time\n\n![good old Alice, Robert and Charles](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*h9XbrDO2u6h8UHetqPqKTg.png)\n\n* A quick exploration for when users want to transfer tokens between shards: they can publish tx to smart contract with root ( containing an expected token transfer), along with a security deposit\n* “merkle root of shard is 0x12345 and I agree to lose 100 ETH (the deposit) if this claim is wrong”\n* In the context of the registry storing token balances, user who posted 100 ETH deposit (while waiting for x-shard transaction to come through) then has their balance updated to a conditional state: if state root claim is correct I have x + transferred amt, if not correct I only have original amount (minus forfeited ETH deposit)\n* Think of it as quantum superposition inside of SC (storing both states / both possibilities). Only resolved once contract becomes aware of state root of original shard via crosslink\n* This superposition can then be transferred between users without them knowing (wallets would show optimistic values until \\~6 minutes later and the crosslink were actually sent through)\n\n## GENERAL PURPOSE PRIVACY\n\n* ZEXE: a UTXO based system that preserves privacy\n\n## BENEFITS OF LAYER 2 COMPUTATION\n\n* Philosophically, Layer 1 does not need to be overly complex to optimise properties — block-times, x-shard communications, x-shard synchronous messaging support, privacy, etc\n* Theoretically ETH 2.0 Phase 3 might be sufficient forever, no need for super quadratic sharding\n* Exception would be increasing shards or updating cryptography\n* Other blockchains have made this claim but the reality is once you have scalable data availability and enough expressivity at least to verify zKSnarks and state transitions (minimum threshold for power and complexity)you can build all necessary L2 on top\n* L1 might get harder and harder to change, but this is fine for computational L2 if they are on top of scalable data availability (2.8 mb / sec)\n\n## QUESTIONS\n\n**Q: Doesn’t L2 stuff preclude turing complete languages / won’t work with zKsnarks?**\n\nThere’s a difference between math definition of TC vs what crypto community means. Math: TC means computational lang. That are so general that you can’t tell when a computation will stop (Snark needs to know this beforehand)\n\nCrypto: uses TC to mean expressive enough to make applications with complex internal state (plasma, makerdao, uniswap, verification engines for these L2) BTC can’t do these things, ETH can. ZEXE is UTXO based model but can as well.\n\nTC is the wrong word but it is the case that you can do things that are expressive enough for constructing applications inside of zKsnarks.\n\n**Q: Should we be worried about the 30% hash rate loss during the bear market?**\n\nIt is an issue but not something really to worry about. ETC (Ethereum Classic)has been attacked but only has 3% hashrate of ETH chain. If it becomes a significant concern then Phase 0 can be used as a finality mechanism for the 1.0 chain POW clients. 51% attack would then only allow censoring blocks, not reverting blocks\n\n**Q: There will always be competition between degree of decentralisation between base layer and Application layer. Does data availability and SNARKs always mean centralisation? \\[partially inaudible\\]**\n\nThis new class of L2 is interesting - doesn’t need to solve for data availability issues. Centralisation can be reduced. Compare Plasma and Rollup: Plasma data availability problem means there needs to be an operator, who can then waste users time with 2 week coin lockup if malicious. Rollup has no data availability issue bc if a relayer disappears, another can quickly take their place. Possible harm is reduced, L2s like Rollup are part of the solution.\n\n**Q: Are you considering two phase commit protocol \\[inaudible\\] when doing cross-shard communication?**\n\nContract yanking helps to solve train and hotel problem. (interacting with 2 objects on different shards) Should the ETH chain support synchronous on L1? No, it introduces too much complexity.\n\nRight now, between two crosslinks you can calculate the state transitions in a shard as being a function of the data in a shard and the beacon chain. Doesn’t depend on what happens in other shards\n\nHaving synchronous cross-shard calls breaks this invariant, makes state calculation game much more complicated, though you could implement a L2 like Rollup that would help support synchronous cross-shard calls.\n\n**Q: What is the relationship between “third-party” L2 solutions (Celer) and other Ethereum L2 solutions?**\n\nCeler is a L2 that provides its own data availability solution, Plasma also does this. Rollup does computation offchain and has data availability handled onchain. Has different tradeoffs.\n\n\n---\n\nFind me [@trent_vanepps](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps) on twitter for discussion or corrections. ✌", "timestamp": 1632627129, "digest": "2LKCh3Aek4uahv66wvpEEQfws-pUY8TKaq_tM7Xe5Qc", "contributor": "0x4C0a466DF0628FE8699051b3Ac6506653191cc21"}

Will the subnet communicate with other subnets? How will node operators be rewarded? Templates, and template companies a la Wordpress, will spring up in and around these marketplaces. There is also room for the generalized mining narrative to thrive, as facilitators and supporters of subnet economies.\n\nSecond order effects of Canto, will be interesting to follow as it develops traction within the community.\n\n## SMART CONTRACTS\n\nEvery subnet begins and is maintained through the same core of contracts, hosted on the Main ETH chain — however, the spec [section on Contract Creation](https://github.com/canto-ethereum/spec/blob/master/canto.md#canto-smart-contract-design) is a better source for technical readers.\n\n![Routing, Factory & Gateway Contracts](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*MxdtFTjcYBMRy7UhUab2Jg.jpeg)\n\n## COMPARED TO PLASMA\n\nThough Canto may initially appear similar to Plasma, there are some important distinctions between them.\n\n**Similarities:**\n\n* Both are L2 scaling solutions\n* Both require some degree of coordination to kick off the network\n* Shared challenges in the design of mass exit mechanisms (load balancer back to mainnet).\n\n**Differences:**\n\n* Canto ships with native flexibility when it comes to hardware and validator requirements. Discussed previously, Plasma requires significantly more coordination, whereas Canto might start as a wild west marketplace predicated on degrees of reputation.\n* Smart Contracts on Plasma are a challenge — read [“Why is EVM-on-Plasma hard?”](https://medium.com/@kelvinfichter/why-is-evm-on-plasma-hard-bf2d99c48df7) from [Kelvin Fichter](https://medium.com/u/60c1f53c90d?source=post_page-----5f8f3a6f7dad--------------------------------).\n\n## COMPARED TO POLKADOT\n\nOutside of Ethereum proper, Canto might also resemble [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/#cover), a Parity project; again, there are important differences.\n\n**Similarities:**\n\n* Both are systems of smaller ‘dapp-chains’ that coordinate around a connecting base chain.\n* Both enable smart contracts.\n\n**Differences:**\n\n* Canto is a ‘plug and play’ solution that runs within Ethereum, while Polkadot on a separate blockchain with a new architecture.\n* Polkadot has a more rigid architecture that only allows for PoS — while the Ethereum basechain only permits PoW currently. Canto offloads onchain activity to to flexible subnets that can be PoW, PoS, PoA\n* Canto’s subnets are [“logically isolated from one another, responsible for their own security and function”](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/canto-a-scalable-blockchain-system-interconnect-model/2203/7) while Polkadot’s parachains require interoperation in order to pool security collectively.\n* Every parachain on Polkadot operates under on-chain governance. Canto leaves any governance (or lack of it) up to each subnet to decide.\n\n## REMAINING ROADBLOCKS\n\nWhile Canto is conceptually straightforward, there are still challenges that might slow implementation and the growth of a mature ecosystem.\n\nTo start, there’s the actual process to get a subprotocol implemented in a client. Aside from “eth”, light client support launched in [January 2017](https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/01/07/introduction-light-client-dapp-developers/), Swarm in [December 2016](https://btcmanager.com/new-release-of-ethereums-client-geth-awakens-the-swarm/), when the fledgling ecosystem was relatively small. Given the push today towards ETH 2.0 (and ETH 1.0, 1.x), it’s fortunate that that Canto doesn’t require a hard fork. A single client is all that’s needed to start demonstrating utility, but getting one onboard will take some effort.\n\nAdditionally, exit conditions still need to be developed and iterated on. Hopefully the developers will be informed by the large design space growing around Plasma. This is an open area of research that will need careful attention prior to release.\n\nI’m looking forward to seeing development progress over the coming months. Hopefully sometime soon the larger Ethereum ecosystem will get to explore the capabilities of subnets.\n\n\n---\n\n## WHAT’S NEXT FOR THE TEAM\n\nTo start, they are continuing to build out PoCs in Java and Go. You can track their Github progress [here](https://github.com/canto-ethereum) (broken link).\n\nThanks to Antoine ([@_tmio](https://twitter.com/_tmio)) and Zac ([@0xzak](https://twitter.com/0xzak)) for answering my questions and being super helpful.

Please reach out to the people mentioned on gitter if you have more specific questions.*\n\n## 1. Transition from 1.0 to 2.0: are any hard forks required?\n\n**Justin**- Zero hardforks are needed. The only prerequisite would be to set up the deposit contract on 1.0. However, a hard fork on 1.0 could add the functionality of finality taken from 2.0. This allows issuance to be drastically reduced (factor of 10 or 20, near the security of Ethereum Classic). Every 6 minutes the chain is finalised, conceivably could come to rely only on transaction fees. Other benefit from finalisation is fungibility of the ETH token, two-way transfer between the two chains.\n\nFinalisation of blocks is an independent effort from 2.0. It is key that 1.0 clients are aware of the 2.0 chain — this is either as a full node of the beacon chain OR by being a light client of both. It will take time for this to occur, perhaps near Phase 1, sometime next year.\n\n## 2. Transition from 1.0 to 2.0: what is the path for Dapp developers?\n\n**Greg**- It might be too early. Could drain resources from both researchers and dapp developers to explore this now.\n\n**Zak**- Agrees it is too early, the spec isn’t entirely complete yet. No defined function for peering / communication mechanisms. Network layer needs to be solid before looking at application layer.\n\n## 3. Transition from 1.0 to 2.0: what is the timeline for dapps testing their work?\n\n**Mehdi**- The only thing available soon will be testnets. Lighthouse will have a testnet within the next few weeks. It’s too early to guide dapp developers on what their dapp might look like on 2.0: the EVM is deprecated by EWASM. Developers should look into EWASM.\n\n## 4. Token moving from 1.0 to 2.0- what does that look like?\n\n**Justin**- Deposits can be between 1–32 ether, these are locked in the deposit address (burner address). Within the beacon chain if you are not actively validating you can transfer between addresses (perhaps for arbitrage). This is purely a system chain, with no user transactions.\n\n## 5. Will there be economic abstraction in 2.0?\n\n**Justin**- Initially the beacon chain will have very limited throughput at 16 txs per block. Wouldn’t be a great mechanism to abstract fees. One research idea is a single unified Plasma chain to pay tx fees on any shard. This removes need for ether dust on every shard to pay for transactions. This problem of fee abstraction is more pressing in 2.0 than 1.0 (note, I think there may be a slight disconnect between the question and answer. Typically this refers to paying system transaction fees in something other than the base token, e.g. tokens paying tx fees in the place ether).\n\n**Carl**- The beacon chain can be considered a state machine: not designed for arbitrary computation, with a finite actions and systems to update. Not designed for general purpose computation.\n\n## 6. Will the randomness produced by the Beacon Chain be available to smart contracts (e.g. a dice game)?\n\n**Carl**- Yes. We now have a secure random beacon that can be used across the chain by dapps. Unbiasable and with the same properties that are used in consensus.\n\n## 7. What will happen to smart contracts that are on 1.0? Migration?\n\n**Justin**- If you have a 1.0 contract with a long projected life, the 1.0 chain will most likely live on for decades. However, it’s important that it remains sustainable, issuance needs to not be that high. This can be accomplished through 2.0 finalisation, might be able to live on transaction fees alone. Other approach would be to embed 1.0 chain as a contract within 2.0 — this seems ambitious as an engineering question. Is it worth the time and effort?\n\n## 8. Will the ETH 1.0 chain be isolated?\n\n**Justin**- At the very least you would be able to transfer Ether between both chains.\n\n**Carl**- Merkel roots of data from ETH 1.0 chain can be included on 2.0 chain (proving accounts).\n\n## 9. Why is it necessary to reduce issuance on 1.0? If there is a chain reorg on 1.0 a year into the new chain, how would that affect 2.0?\n\n**Justin**- Issuance can be reduced because 1.0 is finalised by 2.0. At most it could be a 6 minute reorg from a bad miner. Issuance should be reduced because it is expensive for investors to get continuously diluted — ideally would be .5% for the entire Ethereum system. Secondly, it is environmentally expensive. With POS you get better security for a cheaper price.\n\n## 10. For dapp developers considering other chains who may launch sooner, how will this affect the 2.0 product?\n\n**Greg**- We live in a multi-chain future. If dapps want to move to other chains they will, but their users might not. Layer 2 solutions will likely fill that deficiency before forcing dapps to move to other chains.\n\n## 11. Could the deposit address on 1.0 be read by contracts on 2.0, allowing for some communication? What does the migration path actually look like?\n\n**Carl**- Goes back to the idea of using merkel roots to include data, same conditions apply if 2.0 is finalising 1.0. Long term it depends on what happens with 1.0 (1.x, EWASM), if there is a WASM interpreter running in a shard then data will be more accessible.\n\n**Zak**- Keep building / developing as you are, but anticipate that you may have to restart / redeploy on 2.0. Will present fewest vulnerabilities and security issues.\n\n**Diederik**- If the 1.0 chain keeps running, you wouldn’t want to run on both at the same time. May want to stop support on 1.0, take state roots of the dapp and reinitialise on 2.0. Doesn’t need to be defined in the protocol.\n\n## 12. How would you know which shard your contract gets deployed on? What do cross-shard calls look like?\n\n**Carl**- It will be your choice, each will have different gas markets which will lead to economic load balancing.\n\n**Lane**- Considered baking the load balancing into the protocol but it was incredibly complicated. Population density / cost of living analogy. Higher densities might have network effects but there are also costs associated with it. Yanking will also allow for asynchronous contract movement between shards.\n\n**Justin**- Cross shard calls is a design space with tradeoffs, no single answer, like Plasma. People will try different things and standards will emerge. One thing to consider is that there will be basic infrastructure at the protocol layer in the form of crosslinks. This is a way for every shard to have light client access to other shards. Most likely there will also be basic asynchronous cross-shard calls. This works by having a special contract on each shard that burns ether sent to it. The burn generates a receipt which can then be consumed on the shard on the other end of the transaction as soon as the sending shard has been finalised through the beacon chain.\n\n## 13. Would transactions (contract calls) spanning multiple blocks be feasible or is it better to deploy all contracts a tx might touch on a single shard?\n\n**Justin**- Latency from basic infrastructure would be one epoch, 6 minutes. To get anything faster you can also experiment with optimistic approaches. Assume that the checkpoint will be finalised but don’t wait for it, and then layer your next actions on top of that. If for some exceptional reason this does not occur there would be a revert mechanism built in. The design space opens up here — you can trade off certainty of execution vs. latency.\n\n## 14. As core researchers how can we listen to and respond to the concerns of dapp developers?\n\n**Lane**- Reddit AMAs, had a 2.0 AMA recently.\n\n**Justin**- One of the biggest concerns for 2.0 will be storage fees. Good news is that there is movement in the form of 1.x which will help give feedback. This also applies to the Plasma research, state channels, etc. Getting close to world computer will require these Layer 2 solutions.\n\n**Lane**- None of the 2.0 work requires a 1.0 hard fork, however, there will be experimental efforts like storage fees that will likely take place via a 1.0 HF. EWASM is also important on this front.\n\n## 15. VDF (verifiable delay function) ELI5? What is the difference between a VDF and POW today?\n\n**Justin**- We need VDFs to get a very high quality of randomness. RANDAO gets a pretty good version but these together get basically perfect randomness. ELI5: There are \\~100 people in a dark room, with a die in the middle. They are asked to roll the die, however some do not participate honestly because they are asleep or malicious. They cannot see the die. If there is only one honest person rolling the die, then the end result is no one can know what the final value will be. VDFs provide a mechanism to keep the lights off for a preset period of time and not before. It’s an artificial delay mechanism for seeing the unique answer that will only be seen at a future time. Malicious actors are constrained by physics.\n\n## 16. What is the perceived value with VDFs?\n\n**Justin**- Originally the idea was to harden the consensus layer because RANDAO is vulnerable to two attacks. In RANDAO, the last entity invited to reveal in an epoch can choose to not reveal — this biases the randomness by one bit. In the “last revealer attack” if they somehow manage to control the last 3 slots, then they can control 3 bits of attack surface (8 random number possibilities). If randomness can be biased in one epoch, malicious actors can use that bias even more in the next epoch —meaning you push your slot closer to the reveal period. This is called the “amplification attack”: if you control 35% of the stake, you would be able to put yourself in the last revealer position 50% of the time.\n\nTo address these biases at the protocol layer, we have security margins. One way is to have stronger assumptions, ie, that people are honest. If there were better randomness, your assumption that 70% of the network is honest can be reduced to 66%.\n\nA second, more tangible value for strong randomness (VDF) is at the application layer. Would be incredibly important for something like a billion $ lottery, where one biased bit of randomness increases the odds of payout for large players.\n\n## 17. How do implementer teams make sure your clients talk to each other?\n\n**Mehdi**- Biweekly implementer calls help to coordinate the teams on development. In terms of the protocol layer, there are also test vectors set by the Ethereum Foundation which each implementation is on par with the specification. Will hopefully see a multi-client testnets in a few weeks time.\n\n## 18. What are the biggest challenges facing implementers?\n\n**Mehdi**- Funding. This problem is not unique to the Ethereum space, affects all of open source. Need to find sustainable business models. Another challenge is balancing between their current work and staying up to date with the spec.\n\n**Greg**- The Chainsafe implementation in Javascript has seen issues with numbers. How to properly handle this with regard to communication between clients? Also difficult when the spec is not versioned, however this has been fixed recently by the research team.\n\n**Mehdi**- The naiive implementation of the spec would not work, would require a lot of optimisation. This is a requirement on top of the spec implementation.\n\n## 19. When should specification optimisations occur?\n\n**Diederik**- There is a tradeoff between optimising prematurely or researching for a better solution.\n\n**Carl**- From a spec writing perspective we have optimised for readability. It should be easy to understand. The research team has been moving away from a plaintext script towards python executables (exe). They want clients to come up with different optimisations to solve problems in different ways. Trying to avoid all clients failing in the same way and possibly missing better optimisations. If everyone is focused on different methods of achieving the naiive spec this is probably better for the health of the ecosystem in the long run.\n\n**Greg**- We need client competition to a certain degree. Client specific optimisations on top of a barebones spec leads to different tradeoffs.\n\n**Mehdi**- Simplicity was certainly a design goal for Ethereum Serenity. The spec does not necessarily need to have all client optimisations built into it. He views the client as a public good.\n\n**Lane**- It’s part of the Ethereum ethos to have multiple implementations (as compared to Zcash or Bitcoin). Important to point out that there have been consensus failures, it’s a useful method to catch bugs.\n\n## 20. What is the advantage to having more than 2–3 client implementations?\n\n**Lane**- There might be diminishing returns.\n\n**Diederik**- In terms of ETH 2.0 it’s important that large groups of validators do not fail at the same time if their client has the same bug. Diversity is healthy for the validator ecosystem.\n\n**Zak**- Language differences play a part. Different clients can be more modular depending on the usecase. There is a lack of standards / specifications for what clients are required to do — will lead to healthy competition.\n\n**Greg**- Diminishing returns are real, probably already. First, the spec is not quite finished and bugs are being found. Case in point, being able to transfer on the Beacon Chain activates validators and then they are being slashed because they aren’t aware. Second, readability is huge. The spec is complex, not everyone knows Rust. Third, contributions to upstream libraries. All the teams need libp2p so all each language is completing what they need, leading to a more unified feature set. ([Looks at camera:](https://youtu.be/r8235mBjHSs?t=24645) Dean, we don’t need a client in swift)\n\n**Lane**- Readability is important. The yellow paper is challenging to understand, he finds the Trinity source code easier. Reading the client implementation might be easier than digesting math for developers. There is also other types of experimentation going on, e.g. business models.\n\n## 21. What project coordination would be helpful for both developing the spec and helping across teams?\n\n**Greg**- Happens in gitter or side communications between implementers. The researchers are doing an incredible job letting people know what’s up, Danny especially. We’re still in the research phase, though very close to finalising. Additional formal coordination isn’t necessary quite yet, perhaps when the cross-client testnets are closer it might be more important.\n\n**Mehdi**- Agree, Danny is doing an amazing job. It’s also difficult in a decentralised environment because no one formally told him to do it. Wouldn’t work in a commercial context, a researcher acting as a project manager would be unheard of.\n\n**Greg**- Implementers call standup gives a good enough of an understanding between client teams. With a cross-client testnet it will come down to implementers chatting with each other.\n\n**Zak**- A working multi-client testnet has been challenging. Need conformance tests, performance metrics, functional docker files. Might be good to have Cat Herders coordinate a multi-client testnet, should not be the responsibility of the client developers. Please try to move away from writing everything to memory.\n\n**Diederik**- Need to shift from single to multi-client testnets. This is difficult because there is still undefined pseudo-code in the spec. There are plans to formalise these parts of the spec. They want big picture test vectors to make sure clients generally confirm state transitions and also agree on networking.\n\n## 22. What is the ETH 2.0 roadmap? How has it evolved?\n\n**Justin**- The roadmap is bigger than the spec, which only refers to Phase 0. The roadmap has evolved significantly over the years, up until recently it was primarily driven by the research team (Vitalik and Vlad mostly). The roadmap is changing in relatively smaller ways. One example is the addition of transfers — will the BETH token be fungible, will there be tax implications? It was a low hanging change. Phase 0, 1 and 2 are pretty well defined — what come after is more blurry. They would like to have a quantum secure chain after that, part of the reason they gave the grant to Starkware. Starks are probably powerful enough to handle all of those problems, including signature aggregation (replacing BLS signatures), can be useful for VDFs. Another non-quantum secure part is randomness — whereas right now they use BLS signatures, there is a new design requirement for ETH 2.0: it should be friendly to MPCs (n of m staking pools).\n\n## 23. What’s one thing you would change about the roadmap if you could?\n\n**Diederik**- In the short term, from Phase 0 to 1 there is room for concurrent research on how shards can be upgraded individually.\n\n**Mehdi**- We had to throw away a lot of Rust code but we learned a lot, it’s fine. One thing they would have done differently is to maybe wait until a release candidate was ready. Much better now with releases and a change log.\n\n**Greg**- Disagrees with the Kyokan report claim that there isn’t input from implementers to researchers, he can still ask questions.\n\n**Zak**- Thinks there should be more formal verification. Should be a feedback between formal verification and the eventual spec changes. Formal verification is is like establishing a blueprint for a building. Should occur before construction begins.\n\n## 24. Is there any interaction between the EEA and the ETH 2.0 efforts?\n\n**Zak**- There is not much interaction or interest in 2.0. They are focused on enterprise implementations, 2.0 seems too far into the future. Too early to say what will happen in the future.\n\n## 25. What is the best way to approach “execution engines” in Phase 2 (look at EVM, consult with dapp devs)? Where is the best place to discuss these ideas?\n\n**Zak**- [ethereum-magicians.org](https://ethereum-magicians.org/) OR [ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/). Gitter is a great place to voice your opinion.\n\n**Greg**- For dapp devs they can still contribute to EWASM issues, join some gitters, github issues. Just because you don’t write code doesn’t mean you can’t contribute.\n\n**Lane**- All avenues are developer friendly, perhaps not for non-developers. Cat herders are a great way to get involved if you are non-technical. Build a design ring if you are a designer.\n\n\n---\n\nHopefully people find this helpful.

{"id": "ivp8tRB1k99osHmRg1tl9YAZOpBYUN6JC5Vik9OVHMY", "title": "Grand Opening: Crowdfunds Go Public", "body": "*Mirror is working to open its creative and economic suite to the public, beginning with crowdfunds.*\n\nMirror is entering a big new era in which we open our ecosystem to the public. Since last year, we’ve been expanding our creative and economic suite, and its applications within our community has been inspiring to say the least. So far, the suite includes publishing capabilities, crowdfunds, auctions, NFT editions, splits and voting—each with a web3 foundation. It’s a lot to roll out at once, so we’re beginning by opening up access to one of our most powerful and popular tools: the crowdfund.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U0p62Trlddj7rLYAJ6wY-.png?height=1142&width=2284&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nLike traditional crowdfund platforms, Mirror’s crowdfund feature allows you to raise funds for your latest project. We’ve been most excited to see it used to fund completely new kinds of web3 projects, whether it be a [decentralized e-sports guild](https://blvkhvnd.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930), a [grant giving program](https://club.mirror.xyz/dnN3Dwe-iD6jBpzkase4YLHTxYtnuFnmUbSoOfPEkjI), an [online learning community](https://g.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x819b12E7b398021fbD9D2acdC8B7349E3D732B51), or a [community-built NFT marketplace](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4). Unlike traditional, web2 crowdfund platforms, Mirror’s crypto-native crowdfunding gives the tool a disruptive edge. With the application of tokens and NFTs, backers have automatic and permanent stakes in the success of a project. The result is a unique cross between starting an online community and an internet-native company, all in real time and with the simplicity of filling out a form. Notably, our crowdfund tool has proved to be the easiest way to form a DAO, where an internet-native community is able to bootstrap its treasury and issue membership via tokens and NFTs in just a few clicks.\n\nHere are the highlights of Mirror crowdfund functionality:\n\n* **Tokens**: The tokens that backers receive through supporting a project represent membership in a project’s community. Crowdfunds on Mirror have used their native tokens to gate access to member-only spaces on Discord and coordinate decision making in governance.\n* **NFT Tiers**: While the reward tiers on Web2 crowdfunding platforms typically feature physical goods and merchandise, Mirror crowdfunds natively support NFTs. In just a few clicks, you can reward backers with digitally-native collectibles with the potential to grow in value and serve as membership in a community.\n* **Patron Podium**: Mirror crowdfunds support a reward tier called the Patron Podium that rewards the top three contributors with unique 1/1 NFTs. It’s a great way to distinguish the project’s superfans and top supporters, and introduces a competitive auction-like element to your campaign.\n* **Crowdfund Editor**: Finally, we spent the past few weeks rebuilding the crowdfund creation flow from scratch. With our new inline WYSIWYG editor, composing a campaign is now easier than ever.\n\nTo date, Mirror crowdfunds have collectively raised 1,751.36 ETH. Here are some of our favorite campaigns launched on Mirror:\n\n* [Newly Finite Themes](https://techdirt.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0xDbf6787Bf9322f8768B36cCa815bcC91474aD5bC)\n* [DAO Masters](https://awesomepeople.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x7F6B4d98789d283622D6B85d0efa3a7928C59B89)\n* [Heavy is the $HVND](https://blvkhvnd.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930)\n* [Ethereum: The Infinite Garden](https://ethereumfilm.mirror.xyz/3SV8gLXHIW8Ot45h3RL7aOgDINxN2hjLfFVOvyatB2A)\n* [This DAO is here to $PARTY](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4)\n* [Crypto, Culture, & Society](https://g.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x819b12E7b398021fbD9D2acdC8B7349E3D732B51)\n* [Shall we start a new DAO?](https://club.mirror.xyz/dnN3Dwe-iD6jBpzkase4YLHTxYtnuFnmUbSoOfPEkjI)\n* [Crowdfunding creator residencies at our $CABIN](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ)\n* [The Elektra Crowdfund](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc)\n* [Lion DAO](https://blockchain.mirror.xyz/d2pxavq9Bztp6kCzF9UjtoJEnFTY9Oks3RPkrcBUsKg)\n\nIf you want to experiment with crowdfunds, the tool is now open to everyone in your [dashboard](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard). Get started with the [guide](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/crowdfunds) and join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/hM9gcwfm) if you have any questions.\n\n*Open crowdfunds will be initially rolled out with a 20 ETH hard cap for users who aren’t members of Mirror, as we stress test the feature with the broader community.*\n\n### A note on Mirror Membership\n\nThis milestone in Mirror’s lifecycle is an opportunity to redefine the meaning of community membership. While membership (attained via [$WRITE RACE](https://mirror.xyz/race)) has meant access to the Mirror tools, it always aspired to represent decision-making power and stake in the future of the Mirror protocol and DAO. Soon, everyone will be able to use all the Mirror tools, but only Mirror members (who have burned $WRITE and registered) will be stakeholders the future of Mirror (and get a Mirror ENS subdomain). In turn, the more people use the open toolkit, the more the Mirror ecosystem will benefit.\n\nAs part of the initiative to open up the platform, a 2.5% fee has been implemented across economic tools, routing to the newly-deployed Mirror DAO [treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x138c3d30a724de380739aad9ec94e59e613a9008). The accrued fees will be governed by Mirror members and used to grow the Mirror ecosystem.\n\nThese are just some of the early details. Stay tuned for more in the coming months!", "timestamp": 1632950713, "digest": "kkpmBMFAeKlCv4zi2HcyO0MfmpguVqTHoo-DL0WxwS8", "contributor": "0x5507dbd48a5A5bAcE8a6030e878cC4E0af147C33"}
