{"id": "xLpgUMUxmvHTmNRdK-u9ep-zmCan2PEmYO2MXicSVXw", "title": "Tutorial: How to provide liquidity on Balancer (Polygon)", "body": "## What is Balancer?\n\nBalancer is an automated market maker (AMM) protocol that allows users to swap assets using liquidity pools, similar to Uniswap. However, Balancer differs from Uniswap in a major way in that the liquidity pools are able to have up to 8 assets deposited in them, and the desired ratio between those assets can be set by the person that creates it. This essentially allows users to create custom investment vehicles that can act like index funds in which they can collect transaction fees from people using the pool. This comes with the added benefit of being able to maintain the ratios of the assets in their portfolio by having arbitragers effectively manage the fund for them.\n\n## Balancer on Polygon?\n\nIn this tutorial, we will be covering how to provide liquidity on Balancer on the Polygon network. Polygon is an EVM smart contract-enabled side chain that is very similar to Ethereum. This means that you can use familiar tools like MetaMask to approve transactions. An added benefit is that the transaction fees on Polygon are much lower than on Mainnet Ethereum.\n\nIn order to get assets onto Polygon, you will need to use a bridge. Which you can find here: [ETH<>Polygon bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)\n\nHere is a tutorial on how to [Use Polygon for the first time](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/Hm0zb1vkvx0yoj9EfvqCt119vsMdcD0Cp9Sk25hyNic), but in this tutorial, I will assume you have already gone through it.\n\n## How to provide liquidity on Balancer\n\n### What you will need:\n\n1. A supported web3 wallet.\n2. Some Matic in your wallet to pay gas fees.\n3. 1 to 8 assets in your wallet on Polygon Network that you wish to invest.\n\nI will also assume that you are familiar with approving transactions with your wallet software.\n\nOnce you have everything you need from the list above, we are ready to dive in.\n\n### Step 1. Go to the Balancer v2 investments page and connect your wallet\n\nYou can get to the investment page by clicking this link https://polygon.balancer.fi/#/. Then you will need to click the “Connect wallet” button in the top right corner of the page and select the wallet software you prefer from the list. Make sure you set the network to Polygon Mainnet.\n\n*If you are managing several wallets with the same software, you will also need to specify which address you wish to connect to the site.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0ea06ba5-a000-4cf3-8767-569ae7a3fcc2.jpeg?height=951&width=1919)\n\nStep 2. Choose a pool you wish to invest in.\n\nYou can scroll through the list or use the “Filter by token” field to search for the pool you wish to invest in. You can also use three of the column headings to sort the list by metrics that may help you decide which pool you wish to choose.\n\nNote that there are several different types of pools, and it is important to understand how each one works if you wish to invest in it. To read about them you can visit the Balancer documentation here: https://docs.balancer.fi/core-concepts/protocol/pools#pool-types\n\nWhen you’ve made your decision, click on the row in the table that represents the pool you wish to invest in.\n\n*The green dots over assets in the “Composition” column identify assets that you already have in your wallet*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/94405f2e-18bf-427e-9def-2d4011a91a42.jpeg?height=867&width=1564)\n\nStep 3. Enter the amount you wish to invest.\n\nFor this example, we’ll be using the USDC/SNX/GRT/WETH pool, which is a Weighted Pool (see top left in photo). This means that the ratios between each asset were set when the pool was created and it is optimized to maintain those ratios as it is used.\n\nOn the right side of the screen, you will need to enter the assets in the correct ratio in order to enter the pool. However, if you don’t have all of the required assets in your wallet, Balancer will perform the necessary conversions for you as long as you deposit at least one of the required assets. In this case, there is only 100 USDC in the wallet and the weights of each asset is set to 25/25/25/25, so when depositing it, Balancer will use the pool to trade 75 USDC for the equivalent of 25 USDC of each of the other assets before entering the pool.\n\nOf course, before depositing any assets in the pool, you will need to approve the contract to use your funds. Click “Approve…” and submit a transaction for each asset you have, and then click the “Invest…\" button and submit the last transaction.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/07710629-76b6-48cd-80a2-df8c9dde7b7d.jpeg?height=626&width=1570)\n\nStep 4. Monitor your investment\n\nOnce the transaction goes through you will be able to see the pool in the “My V2 investments” section on the page from Step 1.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cd020a1a-3903-4c11-96dc-4204ece8b040.jpeg?height=416&width=1581)\n\nIf you view the pool again you can now click on the “Withdraw” tab to view the assets and their current values. If you wish to reclaim your funds, you can choose to receive them as your share of each token in the proportions shown by selecting “Best price”...\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1c25d41c-faa6-4e6e-87a4-a4f3d8f4d347.jpeg?height=628&width=504)\n\n...or you can withdraw them as a single token, by selecting “Single token” and then clicking the “Withdraw…” button and approving the transaction.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/23e1afdc-d776-407f-a5ca-14553d6ec607.jpeg?height=577&width=499)\n\n## Congrats you now know how to become an LP on Balancer!!\n\n*Always remember to return to the RabbitHole site in order to redeem each task and then mark the Quest as complete within the timeframe so that you will be eligible for the reward.*", "timestamp": 1629526655, "digest": "_MqYw-kl3-KlGnxOtgXNPr9Be8MD1Bsn4zGotMvxQQQ", "contributor": "0x8926B75642C2650aE3c5b227bAD2F7158ceaCCD1"}
{"id": "5BWDdyswDHm6cX-QfXZA3-qpFTZ0KaxMTFJmSKYgnfE", "title": "Tutorial: How to swap on Curve (Polygon)\n", "body": "## What is Curve?\n\nCurve is an automated market maker (AMM) protocol that allows users to swap assets using liquidity pools, similar to Uniswap. However, Curve differs from Uniswap in that it is optimized to allow users to trade stablecoins with as little gas fees and slippage as possible. \n\nSlippage is a term that refers to how much the price of an asset shifts during the time that it takes for your order to go through and is the result of a few factors:\n\n1. The amount of Liquidity in a pool\n2. The size of your order\n3. Other market conditions (ie other users performing swaps on with the same pool at the same time.)\n\nFor example, if you wanted to trade 100 DAI for 100 USDC and the total liquidity in the pool was only $1000, the slippage would be much higher than if the total liquidity was $10,000. - OR - If several users are all selling or buying the same asset in a pool the slippage for that asset will tend to be higher. Curve was designed to mitigate the impacts of slippage on pegged coins such as stable coins.\n\nLike other AMMs Curve relies on users to provide liquidity to the pools it supports, and return gives users an opportunity to earn a yield through aggregating lending protocol APRs, trading fees, as well as occasional incentive programs.\n\n## Curve on Polygon?\n\nIn this tutorial, we will be covering how to perform a swap on Curve using the Polygon network.

Go to the Curve homepage and connect your wallet\n\nYou can get to the homepage by clicking this link <https://polygon.curve.fi/>. It should prompt you to connect your wallet automatically, but if not, then you will need to click the “Connect wallet” button in the center near the top of the page and select the wallet software you prefer from the list. Make sure you set the network to the Polygon Mainnet.\n\n*If you are managing several wallets with the same software, you will also need to specify which address you wish to connect to the site.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5677d39e-fcab-4aa7-b096-5b00c3718747.png?height=232&width=759)\n\n### Step 2. Select the asset you wish to swap and enter the amount\n\nYou can use the “Swap using all Curve pools” section in the middle of the page and it will find the best route for your trade to take across all the available options. Select the asset you want to sell from the dropdown list on the left and the asset you want to buy from the dropdown on the right. Enter the amount you wish to sell in the box beside the asset you want to sell, and the amount filed beside the assets you wish to buy automatically be populated with the amount you will receive based on the current market conditions. Just below that, you will also see some information about the trade, like the exchange rate, the price impact you will have on the pool (slippage) and which pool your trade will be routed through.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f3d3a605-f485-4860-8c8e-f6363fac7314.png?height=365&width=748)\n\nAlternatively, you can choose to use a specific pool from the “Curve pools” list, and the next steps will essentially be the same, but the page will just be laid out slightly differently.\n\n*Note that you will not be guaranteed to find the best price for your asset with this method*\n\n### Step 3. Check your advanced options\n\nDon’t let the advanced options area scare you. It simply allows you to set your slippage tolerance; meaning you can set the percentage you are comfortable with the price of the asset drifting from the price you are currently quoted while the trade is being processed. If the price drifts outside of this tolerance by the time your trade is being enacted, the trade will fail and be reverted, so that you do not incur an undesired loss. You can choose from the preset 0.5% or 1%, or you can input a custom percentage.\n\n*As mentioned earlier, in times of high volume slippage can be increased, so you may want to raise your allowance if you really need to have your trade go through. This may occur during some sort of black swan event.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f336d452-9142-401d-a681-0568793633fd.png?height=115&width=429)\n\n### Step 4. Click Sell and approve the transaction\n\nOnce you have input the desired values and double-checked them, you are ready to click “Sell”. If this is your first time trading that asset on Curve, you will need to approve the protocol to be able to access the token you wish to trade. A window displaying the transaction will pop up for you to approve. Once both transactions are approved and providing the asset price didn’t shift outside your tolerance, the transaction should be included in a block, at which point your trade will be complete. You should now see the asset you traded for in your wallet.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e8e0cc69-236b-4dba-9e6e-72873eda2ee7.png?height=86&width=357)\n\n## Congrats you now have completed your first swap on Curve!!\n\n*Always remember to return to the RabbitHole site in order to redeem each Task and then mark the Quest/Skill as complete within the timeframe so that you will be eligible for the reward.*", "timestamp": 1629532224, "digest": "D9KDBrN3unVBBnOU5_A6Hv3VAEMsCHUSa5mCJfK-8SM", "contributor": "0x8926B75642C2650aE3c5b227bAD2F7158ceaCCD1"}

Polygon is an EVM smart contract enabled side chain that is very similar to Ethereum. This means that you can use familiar tools like MetaMask to approve transactions. An added benefit is that the transaction fees on Polygon are much lower than on Mainnet Ethereum.\n\nIn order to get assets onto Polygon, you will need to use a bridge.

Choose the pool you wish to provide liquidity for\n\nYou can view the available pools in the “Curve Pools” section of the page. There are currently only a few options to choose from, but each contains different assets and parameters to consider. It is important to understand all of the risks involved when providing liquidity to these pools, and you can read more about the risks and how Curve works here: <https://resources.curve.fi/base-features/understanding-crypto-pools>. In exchange for this risk, there are rewards though. \n\nOn the homepage you are able to see information that may influence which pool you choose to participate in. Those values are:\n\n* Base vAPY: variable APY based on the day’s trading activity\n* Rewards tAPY: Token APY based on current prices of tokens and reward rates\n* Volume: the amount of trading volume for the day (typically the more a pool is used the more opportunity for transaction fees there are.)\n\nOnce you have chosen a pool click on it to open up that pool’s trading page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4b3cc862-8e38-4208-9c42-dbc517045f3b.png?height=307&width=745)\n\n### Step 3. Navigate to the Deposit page and input desired amounts\n\nWhen you click on the pool from the “Curve pools” list, you will be taken to the “Buy and Sell” page for that pool. At the top of the page you can click on the “Deposit” tab to be taken to the page where you will be able to input the tokens you wish to provide as liquidity.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fd41c517-2e58-46f1-a4ae-da372ae5f636.png?height=147&width=541)\n\nIt’s worth mentioning again that entering into these pools comes with risks, so there is a link to learn more about the risks involved with the pool you have selected. **You should read this before proceeding.** Just below this you will see information about the assets you will be exposed to and the LP tokens you will receive along with their current value. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0e210423-1792-492c-bb80-a441888b82ba.png?height=144&width=530)\n\nIf you scroll to the bottom of the page you will see more details about the pool and you can find out more information about what it all means by reading through the documentation the Curve team has provided here: <https://resources.curve.fi/>. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/338581cf-da96-4aad-a429-c94886d490a8.png?height=499&width=685)\n\nOnce you are comfortable you will want to enter the amounts for the assets the pool accepts. You do not need to have equal portions of each asset in order to enter the pool. If you deposit only one of the supported assets, it will be converted to the necessary amounts of all the other assets in the pool for you.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0d6be2a9-3445-478e-84a5-5d3ffa77d4d7.png?height=260&width=530)\n\nOne thing to note is if one asset is in lower supply to the other assets in the pool, the protocol will offer users a bonus for depositing that asset by itself. In this instance DAI is in short supply, so depositing DAI alone will award a 0.015% bonus\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0f62e3b5-db0e-4379-8727-07e3de680fbf.png?height=52&width=524)\n\n### Step 4. Review all inputs and click “Deposit”\n\nThere are two convenient options to help you allocate assets in the desired proportions, you can click them to automatically populate the amount fields, or manually enter the numbers. Once you have entered all the amounts and assessed the risks involved, you are ready to go ahead and click “Deposit”. Naturally, you will need to approve the protocol to access the selected tokens, and then you can submit the transaction to deposit them into the pool.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/274d9e76-76e5-4ad2-ba14-400aa7a790d5.png?height=102&width=673)\n\nOnce the transactions are confirmed a new box will appear that will allow you to Stake your new LP tokens in a gauge. If you click the “Stake unstated in gauge” button and approve the transactions, you will start to earn the pool-specific rewards for the liquidity you provided.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bcb02db0-4be4-4e36-8042-f4019de64669.png?height=94&width=672)\n\n### Step 5. Monitor your Pools\n\nOnce you have staked your LP tokens, a new button will appear on the homepage in the “Curve pools” section. Click on “My Dashboard” to monitor your pool(s).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fcc9c249-ad65-4614-94cc-0f32211d5d04.png?height=305&width=744)\n\nIt will bring you to a new page that will display all the stats for your pool(s).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/715fc390-6c3d-4208-a8e9-1c0ea9f0dfbd.png?height=249&width=1215)\n\nAny time you want to withdraw your funds, you can revisit the pool page and click the “Withdraw” tab at the top of the screen. On this page, you can decide if you want to withdraw each asset in their current proportions, or you can choose to receive it as a single asset. After making that decision you can click the “Unstake & Withdraw” button.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fc64dd69-8a0e-429c-9757-62ed6d8995a5.png?height=814&width=692)\n\n## Congrats you now have now provided liquidity on Curve!!\n\n*Always remember to return to the RabbitHole site in order to redeem each Task and then mark the Quest/Skill as complete within the timeframe so that you will be eligible for the reward.*", "timestamp": 1629539095, "digest": "fYE7H7xZgkaIk_dxMJIZ_0tuOFjWg7S96KpjWDZu5LI", "contributor": "0x8926B75642C2650aE3c5b227bAD2F7158ceaCCD1"}

Before I explore why I think this is the case let’s define some terms.\n\nNon-fungible tokens are a type of crypto asset that represent unique (or “non-fungible”) digital goods like pieces of art or video game items. As with Bitcoin or Ether, these crypto-assets are held in a non-custodial and censorship resistant manner where proof of ownership exists on public blockchains.\n\nCryptoPunks are a set of 10,000 digital characters that have a variety of attributes with different levels of rarity based on their type (alien, ape, zombie) and attributes like tiaras, luxurious beards, hoodies, and so on. As one of the original NFT collectibles, punks were a seminal step in the development of the ERC-721 standard, which is the “file type” most NFT projects use today.\n\n![CryptoPunk 8348](https://miro.medium.com/max/1248/1\\*c8thAfkcYI4Y-aXE2QhEew.png)\n\nInitially, it may seem crazy that there are people willing to pay big money for what critics say are just PNG files of pixel art. If someone likes one of these punks, can’t they just right click and save the image? While I understand people who hold this view, it misses some important nuance around how art is valued. Let’s consider “real” art for a minute as a comparison.\n\nPaintings by Vincent van Gogh are expensive and many of his pieces have sold for millions of dollars over the past decade. At the same time, I grew up with a printed copy of one of van Gogh’s Sunflowers hanging above my kitchen table… and even though *I* think it’s beautiful, I wouldn’t be able to sell it. It’s worthless, it’s a print.\n\nWhat this shows is fine art has value — at least financially speaking — based on verifiable ownership of an original, not because of aesthetic beauty alone. If someone owns an original work of a famous artist, they gain a level of status. Wealthy people store value in fine art based on the assumption that this will hold true. That status persists. This is in part why so much art sits in freeports around the world and gets traded without the owners ever bothering to go see the pieces in person.\n\n![Side-by-side copies of \"Sunflowers,\" Fourth Version, Vincent van Gogh, 1888](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7bae451f-7e20-4af7-80b4-03456d08449d.png?height=404&width=642)\n\nOk, back to CryptoPunks. What is novel about CryptoPunks is they are among the first pieces of digital art on Ethereum that have a built in means of verifying unique ownership. This is done through cryptographic hashing such that a wallet address on Ethereum can have ownership rights over a CryptoPunk in a secure manner. As people have caught on to this, there has been a surge of interest in buying punks. In the last quarter of 2020 and the first few months of 2021 there have been tens of millions of dollars in sales volume surrounding CryptoPunks and a few purchases of over one million dollars each for the rarest ones. See below for a visual of the price action over the past three months from nonfungible.com:\n\n![CryptoPunk sales data from nonfungible.com](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*aKyoylvmGHXsN7ZA)\n\nSeveral people have laid out investment theses around why punks will hold value over time. A good one to read if you’re interested in exploring this further can be found [here](https://punk.substack.com/p/cryptopunks-digital-collectibles). To me, the value proposition comes down to two things. Punks as a store of value and punks as a reflexive asset with a great narrative. On the store of value side, there are only 10,000 punks and with all the new money in crypto there aren’t enough to go around. It’s a supply-side crisis. On the narrative side, punks have a great story: they had a fair launch so anyone could claim them for free back in the day, the founders behind the project are brilliant, they’re the rookie card of NFTs, etc.\n\nWhile some people see the current run up in punk prices as a bubble — and it may be, in part — I see it more as the repricing of an asset that many people (myself included) missed for a long time. Further, I expect to see the market cap of punks combined continue to grow significantly in the next five years, potentially even in proportion to the size of the NFT market as a whole.\n\nHere’s the theory: NFTs will be massive for the digital art and collectibles category. There will be billions of them. As this growth happens, certain NFTs will capture a majority of the value and punks are a good candidate to capture that value because capital will flow into them from *both* large and small investors.\n\nLet’s look at small collectors first. As new people come into the crypto space they tend to want to collect what is already valuable… and there’s nothing more valuable than punks: they’re persistent, they have a great community, they are used by important people as Twitter and Discord profile pictures, and so on.\n\nWhile punks are too pricey for everyday collectors — the lowest one on offer at the time of writing is $26,000, or 13.5 ETH — projects like NFTX and Niftex have made it possible for smallholders to participate. Both of those protocols use different mechanics to allow people to own a small portion of a punk, either through a set of index funds backed by real punks (NFTX) or fractional ownership of a single punk (Niftex). Together, these protocols allow ownership of punks to disperse in a way that’s never been true of any high-end collectible category. And there are liquid secondary markets for these tokens too.\n\nWhile value will pour into punks from normal collectors, wealthy NFT collectors will cause a surge in punk market cap as well. When I think of wealthy NFT collectors, I break them into two categories.

How many people can do that before the prices go bananas?\n\nThen there’s the crypto-native people who denominate a portion of their net worth in punks. What does that even mean? In the same way that a lot of people who are OGs in Bitcoin play with and trade altcoins then take those gains back into Bitcoin… OG NFT collectors dabble in other NFT projects and when they make money there, they often take those gains back to punks as their numéraire (by buying more or rarer punks with that capital).

Before I explore why I think this is the case let’s define some terms.\n\nNon-fungible tokens are a type of crypto asset that represent unique (or “non-fungible”) digital goods like pieces of art or video game items. As with Bitcoin or Ether, these crypto-assets are held in a non-custodial and censorship resistant manner where proof of ownership exists on public blockchains.\n\nCryptoPunks are a set of 10,000 digital characters that have a variety of attributes with different levels of rarity based on their type (alien, ape, zombie) and attributes like tiaras, luxurious beards, hoodies, and so on. As one of the original NFT collectibles, punks were a seminal step in the development of the ERC-721 standard, which is the “file type” most NFT projects use today.\n\n![CryptoPunk 8348](https://miro.medium.com/max/1248/1\\*c8thAfkcYI4Y-aXE2QhEew.png)\n\nInitially, it may seem crazy that there are people willing to pay big money for what critics say are just PNG files of pixel art. If someone likes one of these punks, can’t they just right click and save the image? While I understand people who hold this view, it misses some important nuance around how art is valued. Let’s consider “real” art for a minute as a comparison.\n\nPaintings by Vincent van Gogh are expensive and many of his pieces have sold for millions of dollars over the past decade. At the same time, I grew up with a printed copy of one of van Gogh’s Sunflowers hanging above my kitchen table… and even though *I* think it’s beautiful, I wouldn’t be able to sell it. It’s worthless, it’s a print.\n\nWhat this shows is fine art has value — at least financially speaking — based on verifiable ownership of an original, not because of aesthetic beauty alone. If someone owns an original work by a famous artist, they gain a level of status. Wealthy people store value in fine art based on the assumption that this will hold true. That status persists. This is in part why so much art sits in freeports around the world and gets traded without the owners ever bothering to go see the pieces in person.\n\n![Side-by-side copies of Sunflowers, Fourth Version, Vincent van Gogh, 1888](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4eccbe08-e960-492e-9687-3c57b66163b2.png?height=404&width=642)\n\nOk, back to CryptoPunks. What is novel about CryptoPunks is they are among the first pieces of digital art on Ethereum that have a built in means of verifying unique ownership. This is done through cryptographic hashing such that a wallet address on Ethereum can have ownership rights over a CryptoPunk in a secure manner. As people have caught on to this, there has been a surge of interest in buying punks. In the last quarter of 2020 and the first few months of 2021 there have been tens of millions of dollars in sales volume surrounding CryptoPunks and a few purchases of over one million dollars each for the rarest ones. See below for a visual of the price action over the past three months from nonfungible.com:\n\n![CryptoPunk trading data from nonfungible.com](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*aKyoylvmGHXsN7ZA)\n\nSeveral people have laid out investment theses around why punks will hold value over time. A good one to read if you’re interested in exploring this further can be found [here](https://punk.substack.com/p/cryptopunks-digital-collectibles). To me, the value proposition comes down to two things. Punks as a store of value and punks as a reflexive asset with a great narrative. On the store of value side, there are only 10,000 punks and with all the new money in crypto there aren’t enough to go around. It’s a supply-side crisis. On the narrative side, punks have a great story: they had a fair launch so anyone could claim them for free back in the day, the founders behind the project are brilliant, they’re the rookie card of NFTs, etc.\n\nWhile some people see the current run up in punk prices as a bubble — and it may be, in part — I see it more as the repricing of an asset that many people (myself included) missed for a long time. Further, I expect to see the market cap of punks combined continue to grow significantly in the next five years, potentially even in proportion to the size of the NFT market as a whole.\n\nHere’s the theory: NFTs will be massive for the digital art and collectibles category. There will be billions of them. As this growth happens, certain NFTs will capture a majority of the value and punks are a good candidate to capture that value because capital will flow into them from *both* large and small investors.\n\nLet’s look at small collectors first. As new people come into the crypto space they tend to want to collect what is already valuable… and there’s nothing more valuable than punks: they’re persistent, they have a great community, they are used by important people as Twitter and Discord profile pictures, and so on.\n\nWhile punks are too pricey for everyday collectors — the lowest one on offer at the time of writing is $26,000 or 13.5 ETH — projects like NFTX and Niftex have made it possible for smallholders to participate. Both of those protocols use different mechanics to allow people to own a small portion of a punk, either through a set of index funds backed by real punks (NFTX) or fractional ownership of a single punk (Niftex). Together, these protocols allow ownership of punks to disperse in a way that’s never been true of any high-end collectible category. And there are liquid secondary markets for these tokens too.\n\nWhile value will pour into punks from normal collectors, wealthy NFT collectors will cause a surge in punk market cap as well. When I think of wealthy NFT collectors, I break them into two categories. There’s non-crypto money and crypto-native money.\n\nThe wealthy new investors will come into NFTs from outside crypto and want what is the most highly valued asset. Punks. For example, last week I was in the CryptoPunks Discord, which has a bot that reports on recent punk sales, and I saw a new Ethereum wallet drop a million dollars on a dozen punks in a single hour. How many people can do that before the prices go bananas?\n\nThen there’s the crypto-native people who denominate a portion of their net worth in punks. What does that even mean? In the same way that a lot of people who are OGs in Bitcoin play with and trade altcoins then take those gains back into Bitcoin… OG NFT collectors dabble in other NFT projects and when they make money there, they often take those gains back to punks as their numéraire (by buying more or rarer punks with that capital). As the NFT category expands, these people will be taking more and more profit back into punks. Again, punk numbers go up.\n\nUltimately then, with capital flowing in both from the bottom (everyday investors) and the top (high net worth people) punks will be bursting at the seams with value capture.

On the narrative side, punks have a great story: they had a fair launch so anyone could claim them for free back in the day, the founders behind the project are brilliant, they’re the rookie card of NFTs, etc.\n\nWhile some people see the current run up in punk prices as a bubble — and it may be, in part — I see it more as the repricing of an asset that many people (myself included) missed for a long time. Further, I expect to see the market cap of punks combined continue to grow significantly in the next five years, potentially even in proportion to the size of the NFT market as a whole.\n\nHere’s the theory: NFTs will be massive for the digital art and collectibles category. There will be billions of them. As this growth happens, certain NFTs will capture a majority of the value and punks are a good candidate to capture that value because capital will flow into them from *both* large and small investors.\n\nLet’s look at small collectors first. As new people come into the crypto space they tend to want to collect what is already valuable… and there’s nothing more valuable than punks: they’re persistent, they have a great community, they are used by important people as Twitter and Discord profile pictures, and so on.\n\nWhile punks are too pricey for everyday collectors — the lowest one on offer at the time of writing is $26,000 or 13.5 ETH — projects like NFTX and Niftex have made it possible for smallholders to participate. Both of those protocols use different mechanics to allow people to own a small portion of a punk, either through a set of index funds backed by real punks (NFTX) or fractional ownership of a single punk (Niftex). Together, these protocols allow ownership of punks to disperse in a way that’s never been true of any high-end collectible category. And there are liquid secondary markets for these tokens too.\n\nWhile value will pour into punks from normal collectors, wealthy NFT collectors will cause a surge in punk market cap as well. When I think of wealthy NFT collectors, I break them into two categories. There’s non-crypto money and crypto-native money.\n\nThe wealthy new investors will come into NFTs from outside crypto and want what is the most highly valued asset. Punks. For example, last week I was in the CryptoPunks Discord, which has a bot that reports on recent punk sales, and I saw a new Ethereum wallet drop a million dollars on a dozen punks in a single hour. How many people can do that before the prices go bananas?\n\nThen there’s the crypto-native people who denominate a portion of their net worth in punks. What does that even mean? In the same way that a lot of people who are OGs in Bitcoin play with and trade altcoins then take those gains back into Bitcoin… OG NFT collectors dabble in other NFT projects and when they make money there, they often take those gains back to punks as their numéraire (by buying more or rarer punks with that capital). As the NFT category expands, these people will be taking more and more profit back into punks. Again, punk numbers go up.\n\nUltimately then, with capital flowing in both from the bottom (everyday investors) and the top (high net worth people) punks will be bursting at the seams with value capture. Over the coming years, we’re going to see some fat punks.\n\n*Credit to the many people whose thinking directly influenced this essay, specifically Aaron Wright, Scott Lewis, Alex Gausman, Snowfro, ddaavvee, gmoney, and JUSTIN.*\n\n*End Note: 100% of the proceeds from The Fat CryptoPunks Thesis will be donated to charity though Mirror’s “Split” functionality: 25% on-chain to GiveWell’s Maximum Impact Fund, 25% on-chain to SaveArtSpace, 25% on-chain to Coin Center, and 25% off-chain through me to charities in British Columbia.*\n\n[split://0x2cB6f19F64e76751DeFc6462852D4728CB0FDDda?network=mainnet](split://0x2cB6f19F64e76751DeFc6462852D4728CB0FDDda?network=mainnet)\n\n", "timestamp": 1629590018, "digest": "dlHilXGUBmVuy0OFtClII4Tr1WMakyh7HZrjoM2xDv8", "contributor": "0x47ec58D5704082527a90362a6293029d7Ed5fc4E"}

Infrastructure\n2. Creator Monetization\n3. Recommenders & Moderation\n\n# Infrastructure\n\nGlass infrastructure is built on two powerful ideas:\n\n* Free markets\n* Edge computing\n\nVideo files are big… like **REALLY** big. Maintaining infrastructure is expensive ($1B+ a year depending on scale).\n\nDecentralized computing allows anyone with dormant resources to earn money in exchange for storage, bandwidth, or transcoding. Since these “miners” are competing for work -- the price of resources reacts to supply and demand fluidly.\n\nThe price of these resources are significantly cheaper than operating a datacenter.\n\n### Storage:\n\nFor file storage we use [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/). Arweave enables truly permanent data storage. The upfront costs for storage is higher than a centralized cloud provider, but the price is **fixed**. We think on the scale of centuries. \n\n> Videos are records of knowledge and culture for future generations. \n\nA nuanced detail of permanent file storage replicated across many computers around the world is the inability to take down content nor censor. This poses some interesting questions on moderation and copyright (see below).\n\n![Breakeven Point](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3f77e1bd-263b-40b5-9bcd-6a2736316828.jpg?height=1392&width=2658)\n\n### Content Delivery Networks:\n\nTo load videos fast, centralized video providers will maintain a content delivery network (CDN). CDN’s are computers located spatially close to the person watching the video. Since video files are **BIG**, you want the distance between the file to be **SMALL**.\n\nCentralized CDN’s are expensive to operate since it requires renting or purchasing data-centers in major cities.\n\nDecentralized CDN’s reduce the costs and improve the spatial distribution of computers around the world. As web3 goes mobile and global spatial distribution becomes more important. Our current CDN savings are approximately **3X** cheaper thanks to the [Meson](https://meson.network/) and [Media](https://media.network/) Networks.\n\n![Central Server vs CDN](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dc596a1c-0a82-42d7-b607-272d503f0e44.png?height=568&width=1324)\n\n### Transcoding:\n\nThe last component of internet video is transcoding. Transcoding converts large videos into smaller videos at different resolutions (6k vs 240p). This allows the video player to adaptively change the resolution of the video depending on network speed without interrupting the viewing experience.\n\nOnce again edge computing (dormant GPU’s) and free markets result in close to a **50X** savings. Prior to using [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/), transcoding was our greatest expense.\n\n![Coordinating Transcoders ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/569d8b6b-2b1e-40cb-b21e-39b465442595.png?height=493&width=856)\n\n### Implications:\n\nDecentralized video is a **hard** engineering problem. We finally have reached a point where we feel confident that the stack will scale to mainstream usage.\n\n# Monetization\n\nOur philosophy behind creator monetization is to **experiment rapidly** towards an economy that sustains video creators and viewers. The primary reason for building monetization on-chain is to enable new economics by giving the community ownership over content, and allowing easy access to an entire ecosystem of decentralized finance. We’ve intentionally built our metadata formats to be highly modular, allowing us to add features and combine economic funding blocks and chains.\n\n![Source: Chris Dixon](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e7bb48ac-4602-4938-9f0a-22f265dcc6f8.png?height=666&width=2542)\n\n### Multi-chain\n\nWe live in a multi-chain world. Each protocol has tradeoffs when it comes to decentralization versus speed and affordability. Instead of making that choice ourselves, we decided to put it in the hands of the creators.\n\nCurrently we support **Ethereum** and **Solana**.\n\n### Tips\n\n✅ **Ethereum**\n\n✅ **Solana**\n\nTips are an established way of supporting creators. They are also a great way to fill out the demand for a creator. Perhaps someone can’t afford to buy an expensive NFT but leaves a $5 tip to show their appreciation.\n\n### NFT Editions\n\n✅ **Ethereum**\n\n🔜 **Solana** (coming soon)\n\nNFT editions lower the barrier to entry and allowing more people to participate.\n\nA couple weeks ago we did a livestream with the Ethereum NFT Edition. The NFT’s could only be purchased while attending the livestream. Think of it like digital merch for attending a digital experience.\n\nWe made **3.15 ETH** in **22 minutes** of live-streaming. As an added experiment we tested out an on-chain commission referral model.\n\nOne core consideration we think about when developing a new economic model is how do we solve the cold-start problem of not having crypto. The commission referral model makes a lot of sense because we can add an economic reward to an existing social behavior (sharing a video).\n\nOf the sales, **15/25** NFT editions were purchased through referral links paying out **0.6 ETH** to people who helped spread the word.\n\n### Reserve Auctions\n\n✅ **Ethereum**\n\n🔜 **Solana** (coming soon)\n\nReserve auctions are a powerful funding mechanism for creators. These auctions tend to capture the highest tiers of demand for a piece of content and help artists truly find economic independence.\n\n### The Long Tails\n\nWe are on a mission to find economic models that create sustainable income at scale for creators at every stage and consistently fund creative endeavors regardless of bear or bull markets.\n\nIn order to compete with centralized platforms, we want to create an economy where the standard of living is always improving. In an ads-based economy, 97% of video creators don’t make enough money off their videos to break the poverty line. We want to play a part in making a career as a video creator more viable in the future.\n\nWe believe innovative models based on free markets between consumers and creators  create a more sustainable inequality curve. They also allows more wealth to flow in the system by capturing more of the demand curve between fans and artists.\n\nFundamentally this requires that:\n\n1. the content is controlled by the people not the platform\n2. the content always finds itself in the hands of the people who find it most valuable\n\nEfficiency in property ownership and novel ways to enable Universal Basic Income for people on the platform can lead to greater economic welfare at a macro scale.\n\n# Moderation & Recommenders\n\nModeration is important for every community. Centralized platforms take much of this power away from their community. We believe in transparency and self-selected moderation. Once we have found truly sustainable monetization we will then focus on application-layer moderation.\n\n### Delegated Moderation\n\nThis is still an open research question, but one model that might work is allowing someone to select who can moderate on their behalf. The moderators are economically rewarded by the protocol to act appropriately. A moderator doesn’t have to be a human actor, it could also be a machine learning model.\n\n### Egregious Content\n\nThe Arweave team has been working on automated machine learning approaches to automatically catch very harmful content.\n\nWe’re at the cutting edge -- bear with us while we tackle these problems. In the meantime, we’ll be rolling out to ability to create on Glass incrementally, while we build out a democratic way for the community to control the content.\n\n### Copyright\n\nWe’re working towards unifying on-chain smart contracts with traditional (legal) licensing contracts. While technically it would be nearly impossible to bring the content down, the last thing we want is a creator getting sued.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nCentralized video platforms opt for black box recommendation algorithms. We don’t like that. As we start adding recommenders to our economics system we’ll always opt for:\n\n1. explainability and transparency\n2. optionality and self-selection\n\n# Airdrop 👀\n\nOne of our core values is that our entire community should prosper. \n\nWe made **3.15 ETH** on our first live-stream.

Videos tell stories that inspire us, teach us, entertain us, and help us grow. It doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, or what you do. You can think of at least one video that's changed your life. That's the power that videos have.\n\nThe power to connect with us to ***make our lives better.***\n\nA majority of internet bandwidth is used to watch videos.\n\n![Sources: Sandvine, CommScope, Cartesian](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c710d4e1-a16c-4eaf-b9ff-273c07f0bf69.png?height=649&width=1048)\n\nVideo **✨should✨** be a public good.\n\nAnd yet… like much of the internet it is not.\n\n> **Video ownership, monetization, and infrastructure is controlled by the platforms, not the people.**\n\nGlass is on a mission to reform internet video from the infrastructure to the experience of living as a creator.\n\n**We believe in individual sovereignty, shared ownership, and decentralization.**\n\n# The Master Plan\n\n1. Infrastructure\n2. Creator Monetization\n3. Recommenders & Moderation\n\n# Infrastructure\n\nGlass infrastructure is built on two powerful ideas:\n\n* Free markets\n* Edge computing\n\nVideo files are big… like **REALLY** big. Maintaining infrastructure is expensive ($1B+ a year depending on scale).\n\nDecentralized computing allows anyone with dormant resources to earn money in exchange for storage, bandwidth, or transcoding. Since these “miners” are competing for work -- the price of resources reacts to supply and demand fluidly.\n\nThe price of these resources are significantly cheaper than operating a datacenter.\n\n### Storage:\n\nFor file storage we use [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/). Arweave enables truly permanent data storage. The upfront costs for storage is higher than a centralized cloud provider, but the price is **fixed**. We think on the scale of centuries.\n\n> Videos are records of knowledge and culture for future generations.\n\nA nuanced detail of permanent file storage replicated across many computers around the world is the inability to take down content nor censor. This poses some interesting questions on moderation and copyright (see below).\n\n![Breakeven Point](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3f77e1bd-263b-40b5-9bcd-6a2736316828.jpg?height=1392&width=2658)\n\n### Content Delivery Networks:\n\nTo load videos fast, centralized video providers will maintain a content delivery network (CDN). CDN’s are computers located spatially close to the person watching the video. Since video files are **BIG**, you want the distance between the file to be **SMALL**.\n\nCentralized CDN’s are expensive to operate since it requires renting or purchasing data-centers in major cities.\n\nDecentralized CDN’s reduce the costs and improve the spatial distribution of computers around the world. As web3 goes mobile and global spatial distribution becomes more important. Our current CDN savings are approximately **3X** cheaper thanks to the [Meson](https://meson.network/) and [Media](https://media.network/) Networks.\n\n![Central Server vs CDN](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dc596a1c-0a82-42d7-b607-272d503f0e44.png?height=568&width=1324)\n\n### Transcoding:\n\nThe last component of internet video is transcoding. Transcoding converts large videos into smaller videos at different resolutions (6k vs 240p). This allows the video player to adaptively change the resolution of the video depending on network speed without interrupting the viewing experience.\n\nOnce again edge computing (dormant GPU’s) and free markets result in close to a **50X** savings. Prior to using [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/), transcoding was our greatest expense.\n\n![Coordinating Transcoders ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/569d8b6b-2b1e-40cb-b21e-39b465442595.png?height=493&width=856)\n\n### Implications:\n\nDecentralized video is a **hard** engineering problem. We finally have reached a point where we feel confident that the stack will scale to mainstream usage.\n\n# Monetization\n\nOur philosophy behind creator monetization is to **experiment rapidly** towards an economy that sustains video creators and viewers. The primary reason for building monetization on-chain is to enable new economics by giving the community ownership over content, and allowing easy access to an entire ecosystem of decentralized finance. We’ve intentionally built our metadata formats to be highly modular, allowing us to add features and combine economic funding blocks and chains.\n\n![Source: Chris Dixon](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e7bb48ac-4602-4938-9f0a-22f265dcc6f8.png?height=666&width=2542)\n\n### Multi-chain\n\nWe live in a multi-chain world. Each protocol has tradeoffs when it comes to decentralization versus speed and affordability. Instead of making that choice ourselves, we decided to put it in the hands of the creators.\n\nCurrently we support **Ethereum** and **Solana**.\n\n### Tips\n\n✅ **Ethereum**\n\n✅ **Solana**\n\nTips are an established way of supporting creators. They are also a great way to fill out the demand for a creator. Perhaps someone can’t afford to buy an expensive NFT but leaves a $5 tip to show their appreciation.\n\n### NFT Editions\n\n✅ **Ethereum**\n\n🔜 **Solana** (coming soon)\n\nNFT editions lower the barrier to entry and allowing more people to participate.\n\nA couple weeks ago we did a livestream with the Ethereum NFT Edition. The NFT’s could only be purchased while attending the livestream. Think of it like digital merch for attending a digital experience.\n\nWe made **3.15 ETH** in **22 minutes** of live-streaming. As an added experiment we tested out an on-chain commission referral model.\n\nOne core consideration we think about when developing a new economic model is how do we solve the cold-start problem of not having crypto. The commission referral model makes a lot of sense because we can add an economic reward to an existing social behavior (sharing a video).\n\nOf the sales, **15/25** NFT editions were purchased through referral links paying out **0.6 ETH** to people who helped spread the word.\n\n### Reserve Auctions\n\n✅ **Ethereum**\n\n🔜 **Solana** (coming soon)\n\nReserve auctions are a powerful funding mechanism for creators. These auctions tend to capture the highest tiers of demand for a piece of content and help artists truly find economic independence.\n\n### The Long Tails\n\nWe are on a mission to find economic models that create sustainable income at scale for creators at every stage and consistently fund creative endeavors regardless of bear or bull markets.\n\nIn order to compete with centralized platforms, we want to create an economy where the standard of living is always improving. In an ads-based economy, 97% of video creators don’t make enough money off their videos to break the poverty line. We want to play a part in making a career as a video creator more viable in the future.\n\nWe believe innovative models based on free markets between consumers and creators  create a more sustainable inequality curve. They also allows more wealth to flow in the system by capturing more of the demand curve between fans and artists.\n\nFundamentally this requires that:\n\n1. the content is controlled by the people not the platform\n2. the content always finds itself in the hands of the people who find it most valuable\n\nEfficiency in property ownership and novel ways to enable Universal Basic Income for people on the platform can lead to greater economic welfare at a macro scale.\n\n# Moderation & Recommenders\n\nModeration is important for every community. Centralized platforms take much of this power away from their community. We believe in transparency and self-selected moderation. Once we have found truly sustainable monetization we will then focus on application-layer moderation.\n\n### Delegated Moderation\n\nThis is still an open research question, but one model that might work is allowing someone to select who can moderate on their behalf. The moderators are economically rewarded by the protocol to act appropriately. A moderator doesn’t have to be a human actor, it could also be a machine learning model.\n\n### Egregious Content\n\nThe Arweave team has been working on automated machine learning approaches to automatically catch very harmful content.\n\nWe’re at the cutting edge -- bear with us while we tackle these problems. In the meantime, we’ll be rolling out the ability to create on Glass incrementally, while we build out a democratic way for the community to control the content.\n\n### Copyright\n\nWe’re working towards unifying on-chain smart contracts with traditional (legal) licensing contracts. While technically it would be nearly impossible to bring the content down, the last thing we want is a creator getting sued.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nCentralized video platforms opt for black box recommendation algorithms. We don’t like that. As we start adding recommenders to our economics system we’ll always opt for:\n\n1. explainability and transparency\n2. optionality and self-selection\n\n# Airdrop 👀\n\nOne of our core values is that our entire community should prosper.\n\nWe made **3.15 ETH** on our first live-stream.
