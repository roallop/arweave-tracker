{"id": "pUkCrp4A_j3KmsR5vC1-KYKC19B_CdaireBB5WDhwLE", "title": "Test Ambient Television", "body": "A few weeks ago, Kyle Chayka [wrote](https://google.com) an essay about the Netflix show “Emily in Paris” and what he calls “ambient TV”—shows that provide “a numbing backdrop to the rest of our digital consumption” and allow us to easily divide our attention among multiple screens and household activities without missing anything important.\n\nTV has, of course, been ambient for most of its history—something we’d frequently turn on at home while we did other activities, without necessarily watching (the television is, in fact, an essential centerpiece of many American domestic spaces, and must be turned on in order to make them feel complete). [The rise of Netflix and other streaming services](https://google.com) initially seemed to make our viewing more intentional and focused, as we’d select specific shows to watch instead of just rolling with whatever happened to be on cable at the moment.\n\n![Japanese Bubble Era](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/9984279/large_a9c5cb38b5899eb655b6b057ae8a909b.jpg?1608622056?bc=0)\n\n“But now,” Chayka writes, “we’re learning to stream as if we never abandoned cable in the first place, especially during quarantine, when nothing’s stopping you from leaving the TV on all day long.” This year, our homes have become densely-layered media environments, with visual and audio content continuously filling our foreground, background, and whatever space remains in between. As the distinctions between work and leisure become blurry, Good Screen and Bad Screen are increasingly the same screen.\n\n## Equilateral triangle\n\n> Describing other ambient shows like Netflix’s “Chef’s Table,” which combines pleasant food imagery with soothing narration, Chayka writes, “The shows are functionally screen savers, never demanding your attention; they do draw it, but only as much as a tabletop bouquet of flowers.”\n\nIf minimalism is the dominant aesthetic of the iPhone era—[and Chayka has written about that too, calling it AirSpace](https://google.com)—maybe this is the reason: We need our built environment to be a blank canvas onto which this always-available digital content can be projected, figuratively if not literally. Anything more baroque runs the risk competing or clashing with the handheld ornamentation we’ve already provided. I want to call this visual Muzak, but it’s more like the opposite, filling the foreground rather than the background. \n\n---\n\nThe physical space itself is the Muzak. Last year I wrote an essay about AirPods in which I described the sparse environments of Sweetgreen and Equinox as “**pleasant backdrops** for solitary device usage.” Always-in headphones complete the transition by giving us an auditory foreground on par with the phone screen’s visual counterpart. But that’s only what we do in public: Once we’re home, as we have been plenty this year, we’re happy to let all of this recede toward the background once again, if only because more of our own devices are competing for the foreground.\n\n### Equilateral polygon\n\n- Your secrets are out.\n- You hear strange noises, like clicking, popping, static and humming.\n- Your phone makes noise on its own.\n- Your radio has strange interference.\n- Your environment just seems different.\n\n> This is a list of **two-dimensional** geometric shapes in Euclidean and other geometries. For mathematical objects in more dimensions, see list of mathematical shapes. For a *broader* scope, see list of shapes.\n\n![](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/9300475/original_3d2b7c3b32917e529032bc73fd897704.gif?1603919477?bc=0)\n\nOnce we’re home, as we have been plenty this year, we’re happy to let all of this recede toward the background once again, if only because more of our own devices are competing for the foreground.\n\n1.

Equiangular polygon\n\n---\n\nRichard Florida, who coined the [creative class theory](https://google.com) that cities’ economies depend on their ability to attract artists and knowledge workers, posted an interesting thread yesterday about the current parental frenzy to form home education “learning pods” in lieu of schools reopening this fall.\n\nThis rapid, ad hoc privatization of a key public good is unsurprising given the lack of alternatives, but also clearly a process that depends heavily on individuals’ resources and one that will exacerbate inequality. Richard Florida connects this phenomenon to the narrative that elites are abandoning cities, arguing that a fully-privatized life in which one hires teachers and amenities directly depends on access to a huge, diverse labor pool and therefore won’t work well in small towns or the Hamptons.
