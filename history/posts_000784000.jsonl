They are not fully decentralized due to the reality that unilateral action and decision-making is often necessary to get things done. They are not truly autonomous because aspects of their operations fall outside the scope of enforceable governance.\n\nWhat is more important than decentralization is *accountability*. We can permit centralized and even hierarchal structures in pursuit of our goals so long as those structures remain accountable to the wider constituency. If DAOs can adopt a method to administer and oversee any task required of them, even off-chain, they may yet be truly autonomous.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*5-cNAqKkvtklmn9UUs6AdA.png)\n\nThere is no organizational structure to rule them all... Except maybe the third one!\n\nWe propose a system for DAOs to wrap the advantages of centralization within an additive, accountable framework. This framework allows organizations to allocate conditional resources and privileges via their existing governance mechanisms.\n\nThe framework includes four primary components:\n\n1.  Solvers — Configurable, interoperable smart contracts with interfaces for operation and on-chain oracles to report outcomes.\n2.  Solutions — Locked configurations of a solver(s) and conditions defining a use case.\n3.  Proposals — Temporary ERC1155-compliant treasuries which enact a solution when successfully funded.\n4.  Arbitration — Optional arbitration which incentivizes fair play among parties by game theoretical and absolute forces.\n\n… and four more supporting concepts:\n\n1.  Keeper — An address assigned to a solution with primary responsibility for delivery and for operations requiring manual invocation.\n2.  Directive — A goal and its associated deliverables desired by a DAO for which it is willing to pay compensation.\n3.  Arbiter — An address assigned to a solution which is responsible for delivering rulings in the event of unsettled disputes by overriding oracle reports.\n4.  Participant — An address participatory in a solution.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*GRNR8uuj1GkSqdxbd9NgOg.png)\n\nAccountable Centralization\n\nWe employ the ERC1155 Conditional Tokens Framework to conditionalize resources flowing through the system. By enabling conditional logic for digital assets, fungible *conditional tokens* can be used with value contingent on oracle reports in the future (such as by a DAO vote). These conditional tokens are minted when a proposal meets its funding and distributed to participants in a solution. When a solution is settled, the oracle reports on the outcome of the solution are finalized and corresponding conditional tokens are redeemable for ERC20 collateral.\n\nThe typical flow of a task begins with its conception as a directive. This directive receives a proposal, which offers a solution and a funding goal. When a proposal is funded, the solution is enacted, and its solvers are invoked to serve their functions. When the component solvers of the solution are completed, so too is the solution, and thus the proposal. Participants may now redeem any conditional tokens they hold for their share of the project funding.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1298/1\\*eVRYAK8mTeXw8W8MqZTMhw.png)\n\nThis system allows us to delegate miscellaneous work in a responsible way. We conceive of something we want done — a directive — and allow proposals to be made which suggest a way for getting it done. When a DAO successfully funds the proposal through their native governance system, it goes live! In the simple case, a solution may just name a Keeper who has full responsibility for delivery. This Keeper may further subcontract conditional tokens to others in exchange for assistance on the delivery.\n\nIf an organization is more particular, they can configure solvers to their specifications. For example, a DAO may wish to use a solver configured to loop in a DAO vote on any person the Keeper wishes to hire for the task (and compensate those voters with a small portion of the proposal funding). The composability of solvers, in conjunction with the complex logic enabled by the Conditional Token Framework, allows DAOs to implement any preferred governance schemes within the policy of a solution.\n\nThe key that makes this work is that conditional tokens are fungible yet have no real value unless their conditions are met. If we were to simply hand funds to a contractor, we’d be out of luck should they run off with our money. If we locked the money into typical escrow, it can no longer be distributed to others. Instead, we transact with what is essentially a fungible IOU: In order to get X done, here is Y funds — and Y funds will be real **if** you are acting in good faith (or: if \\<anything>).\n\nWe believe this simple and effective scheme allows for DAOs to internalize **all** aspects of their operations within their governance. They can hire developers and community managers, build websites and apps, and form partnerships with other DAOs or traditional entities. For each specific case, they can decide which conditionalities are suited to their needs. In simple terms, this system brings human capital management on-chain without laboriously programming every aspect of it.\n\nIt also enables a new form of entrepreneurship in the space. If any service can be wrapped in accountability, they can be sold to (and between) DAOs. We imagine new DAOs cropping up in the space selling customer support, marketing, development and what-have-you to each other. Enterprising individuals can act as keepers, discovering new services and partnerships that can bring value to their DAOs and writing proposals which offer them as solutions. In the future, these “platform cooperative”-like organizations may interoperate programmatically and fluidly, coordinating as though they are vertically integrated corporations.\n\nWe are building this system as a core technology underlying Cambrian Protocol, our effort to bring human capital management on-chain and help usher in the future of work.

By 2018, that number was $20B. Even amidst a myriad of caveats like:\n\n* beware of scams\n* watch out for the SEC\n* lookout for projects building without investor-gated milestones\n* here’s hoping you guessed right on the design of the tokenomics pre-launch\n\nif ICOs were all Ethereum ever did, it would be a remarkable innovation.\n\nI think I heard somewhere — if you had invested in every ICO you would have made money. Not sure that could have been remotely possible, but while the flood of early ICOs engendered a lot of flack, the protocols and companies leading today’s groundbreaking revolutions (DeFi, NFTs, Web3, etc.) were largely built on the back of ICOs. And since that time, the ICO itself has evolved to include Token Generating Events, SAFTs, Security Token Offerings, Liquidity Generating Events, Initial Exchange Offerings, and Initial Dex Offerings (at least). Each offers a unique set of pros and cons that allow non-US entrepreneurs the freedom to select a fundraising path tailored to their project.\n\nWe’re here to suggest yet another route.\n\n**SAFE, SAFT, and the Pre-Mine IDO**\n\nStartups often take advantage of something called a SAFE- the Simple Agreement for Future Equity. The theory here is that brand new startups are difficult to price. Rather than raising $X at a specific enterprise value before getting data on tiny things like product-market-fit or total addressable market, the SAFE allows startups to raise money in return for an agreement to issue equity to investors in the subsequent priced round. Typically, this includes a discount to account for the risk of investing early and/or a cap to put an upper bound on extreme investor dilution. But, the specific mechanics are flexible and the agreement is intentionally simple (adding the additional benefit of lower legal costs).\n\nThe beauty of the SAFE is startups and investors can affordably raise and minimize the risks associated with pricing an early-round inefficiently where one side gets too much equity or the relationship gets otherwise mired with investor provisions.\n\nThe SAFT emerged to bring the power of the SAFE to blockchain projects. It was quickly shut down by regulators who pointed out it was just a security offering by another name. The SAFT avoided the requirement to lock in tokenomics because you weren’t issuing a token. Premature tokenization doesn’t just mess with the cap table, it messes with the mechanics of the entire project. If the project happens to be similar to an existing project, this might not be a concern, but if you are building something new, locking in the game-theoretical mechanics is reckless. For example, what if it turns out an inflationary issuance model would have worked better? What if there’s an opportunity for the community to engage but they are turned off by massive founder grants? Alternatively, what if big grants are needed to attract the initial team?\n\nThere is a disturbing trend in the blockchain world where VCs capture the big gains from projects before public token allocations. A new and amazing project might have been discovered by a smart community member, but that project will have achieved a massive market cap in the private markets before said community member can invest. Frankly, it’s un-American. I earned my dollar, how can you tell me I can’t invest it. SAFTs fail in this regard because they require accredited investors. SAFTs are also paper documents with only the promise for future tokens. So, if you need an actual token for utility or governance, a SAFT will not do. New Jobs Act options like Reg CF and Reg A similarly don’t work due to the tradeable nature of tokens.\n\nHere is where the pre-mine IDO shines. Like an IDO, placeholder tokens become immediately available on decentralized exchanges. This democratizes access to the upside. But, like a SAFT, locked tokenomics are replaced with clear communication that the pre-mine IDO token will be replaced at a future date.\n\nSo, could you even issue a token without setting the tokenomics? It is Ethereum we are talking about here, so… yes. Could you equitably build a liquid community from the start? The answer there has to be yes. Would projects benefit from being able to adjust mechanics according to product-market fit? The project has to benefit, but this lack of certainty does bring additional investor risk.\n\nWe’ll need some guardrails.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nIssue a litepaper that outlines the opportunity and the “planned” tokenomics. This manages expectations but allows for modification as a project develops a community and experiences the market.\n\nIssue a statement about funding goals of the Premine IDO adding details like investor provisions and the number of tokens to be airdropped to the team and community.\n\nInvestor provisions could include the promise to issue a detailed statement including locked tokenomics and roadmap seven days prior to the next token allocation. Promise to grant token holders who bought during the pre-mine IDO an air-drop of new tokens to ensure they have a 1.25X ROI on any tokens that have never been swapped.\n\nIf you are actively trading in and out of the token, you void any rights to investor protections. If the token has a greater than 25% price appreciation there will be no need for the 25% investor protection. You got in early, and you made money because you were early. By issuing a statement that includes the official tokenomics and roadmap seven days prior to the token allocation that follows the pre-mine IDO, investors have time to sell their tokens in the case that they don’t like the direction, or tokenomics, or are concerned about a rug-pull. Of course, once the IDO starts they might not get back in if they do sell.\n\nSell tokens directly to early investors. Airdrop tokens to community and team. Shout from the hilltops. And, let the decentralized exchanges do their thing.\n\nRelax and build.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, projects differ, motivations differ, and access to capital differs. Maybe the guardrails need refinement. Maybe most projects are better suited to existing token allocation schemes. We think there’s value in allowing teams the wisdom of time to refine their tokenomics. We think there’s value in prioritizing equal access to equity, right from the start.\n\nAlas, US regulations aren’t there yet. For now, we will opt for a standard seed round backed by a traditional SAFE. $WRK is a utility token. They will inevitably hit decentralized exchanges once used in our platform no matter what we try to do to stop them. Our investors will not benefit from that liquidity.\n\nMaybe someday someone will challenge these laws on the grounds that they stifle innovation, perpetuate the wealth gap, and unconstitutionally restrict people’s rights to the free and reasonable use of their capital.\n\nMaybe someday we’ll see pre-mine IDOs.", "timestamp": 1633472814, "digest": "BxJY_bURtQox_j89XtA9e3ak_SmZNzDSSRqoTKMt00I", "contributor": "0x6C71BAcDaAB54B4Bcb87019A292Fd1f27d0F7C08"}
{"id": "h8tNRktZFIQzY8IiwJEQlvdeYH5LwsmXVL_c1BQE758", "title": "The New Right ", "body": "Rick Perlstein has a series of books about the restoration of conservatism, most notably economic, laissez-faire conservatism, in the United States beginning in the late 1970's.\n\nHis most recent book is called Reaganland and it came out in 2020. As with all of his other books, I am listening to it on Audible because I am a lazy young whipper snapper.\n\nThe books are amazing, and they really go a ways to explaining what has happened to our economy and why the members of the older generations are morally opposed to recognizing the reality of it.\n\nThe economic realities of our parents' and grandparents' world rested on the solid foundation of the New Deal, and of the economically liberal philosophies that underpinned it - that if the economy is getting to a point where regular people are unable to afford the standard of living, the government can and should intervene to assist such regular people, even if large corporations and the very wealthy people who administer those corporations scream that such assistance is communism and usurps the prerogative of the nobility. Also that labor unions are a good thing and should be supported and encouraged by the government.\n\nThe idea was that, broadly speaking, the weaker aspects of the economy should be the greatest direct beneficiaries of state intervention because otherwise, these people will get no help. The corporate class will not assist them, because that class short-sightedly sees poverty among the masses as good because it keeps labor prices low, and makes wealth more exclusive and thus more prestigious. The corporate class does not see that this commitment to poverty eventually hurts even the rich, as the poor become less invested in society as a whole and thus more willing to detach from and rebel against it - possibly by electing the kinds of governments being seen in Europe during the New Deal, which Roosevelt hoped the New Deal would prevent in the States.\n\nAlthough this system worked magnificently and created the strongest and broadest economy in the world by the 1950's, one in which people working factory jobs that once allowed them to live in one room tenements were now owning homes, buying cars and saving for their children to go to college, the corporate class was never very enthusiastic about it. However, the New Deal rhetoric had so successfully painted laissez-faire conservatism as thinly veiled corporate greed and the main cause of the Great Depression, that there didn't seem to be anything they could do about it.\n\nThat is, until a younger generation of conservatives began to develop an exciting new breed of conservatism called the \"New Right,\" exemplified by William F. Buckley, Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan. This version of laissez-faire emphasized the \"liberty\" aspect of reducing regulation of corporate interests, and vilifyied government assistance to the working class as a big government scheme to crush the freedom of the free market.\n\nThe New Right took all of the resentment that the New Dealers had piled onto the corporate class and transferred it to a heretofore allegedly unrecognized shadow class of \"permanent bureaucracy\" (what Trumpism would term \"the Deep State\"), whose oppression of corporate interests was just the first step in eventually forcing all \"regular Americans\" into Soviet gulags.\n\nAlthough this vision of the evil deep state crushing our freedoms on the pretext of helping the poor is just common sense reality to today's rank and file conservatives, in mid-century America it went hard against the general grain. Thus, to bolster the popularity of this bold new philosophy, the New Right tied their argument to any sort of resentment against \"newfangled values\" that it could find.\n\nThus, resistance to gay rights became \"the self-appointed bureaucratic nanny state wants to force us to let our sons learn how to be gay, just like it wants to rob hard workers of the money they earn in order to spend it on frivolous government welfare programs aimed to encourage things like homosexuality,\" or \"government assistance is part of the overall liberal scheme to empower the lazy and undermine the strong, in order to weaken America for an eventual union with the Soviets, which is what these liberals really want,\" etc.\n\nIn the late 1970's, our economy was really struggling - not because the government was choking the ingenuity and work ethic of the corporate class, but because our post-war virtual monopoly of international production was over, and because we had become highly dependent on foreign oil whose price could be dictated by the whims of strongmen.\n\nThe New Right jumped on this apparent crisis as proof that what they had been saying since the 1950's was true, and that if we didn't act quickly to get the government out of the economy, we would soon be taken over by socialists using the crisis they had intentionally created in order to finally fully crush American freedom.\n\nThe man who won the White House in 1980, who had been pushing this philosophy since the late 1950's, was swept in on a popular tide of approval for this formerly laughable philosophy. And it continues to be the religion of the Republican party to this day.\n\nThe mechanisms in place in the world that our parents grew up in to distribute wealth more fairly are no longer in place. They are no longer in place because our parents' generation was fooled into believing that these mechanisms were responsible for economic problems in the 1970's and 1980's that were actually largely unrelated to our New Deal economic system and philosophy. They therefore elected people who destroyed these mechanisms, and they cheered for the rebirth of American freedom while it happened.\n\nThey cannot admit they were wrong. Therefore, if things are shittier for our generation than for theirs, it must be due to our laziness and sense of entitlement. Far from admitting that the philosophy of the New Right is responsible for the explosion in cost of living, and the resultant decrease in quality of life for a broader and broader section of the American population, they claim that any economic problems are the result of lingering liberalism, and cry that the only way to full prosperity is more economic conservatism. And they've taught many of their children to believe this as well.\n\nThus, even many members of our younger generations seem perfectly willing to pick up this misguided torch.

{"id": "ZzyZvYEtrJ2_qom5fVxDpEcIJVwurW-ZGrLnLp7y0Ns", "title": "A Trip to Saranac\n", "body": " \\n This was my second experience with Europa, and it was just as magical as my first. My best friend 'Jack' and I were on a road trip, staying for a few days at my family's cottage on Lake Saranac in the Adirondacks. We decided to take a day to ourselves, and so we each took around 17.5mg in pill form before taking our little motorboat out to a beautiful island campsite in the middle of the lake. \\n  \\n The weather was gorgeous--a white sun piercing incredible cumulonimbus clouds, the sky a blazing blue, the water deep black. While waiting for the effects to set in, I took a lengthy swim in the hopes that it would get my blood flowing and quicken the onset. This proved ineffective, if very enjoyable. \\n  \\n I returned to land and my friend and I sat around reading the books we had brought with us and talking. Half an hour or so later, I began to notice the drug taking hold. Unlike the other time I'd taken 2C-E, the physical sensations were the first to arrive. As before, my mouth became an odd sort of nerve center: every movement of tongue and lips against teeth and gums was noticeable, and all of these seemed to be covered in a smooth and resistant glaze which didn't inhibit feeling or taste, but which certainly allowed me to feel each tooth and muscle as an individual entity. \\n  \\n A few minutes later, the rest of my body followed suit. My skin seemed to be a bit more resistant than usual (not that I tested this--merely a feeling), and touching things (my hair, the grass, rocks, paper) proved pleasant and comforting. After this, my mind seemed to withdraw a bit from my body, so that I was slightly surprised whenever I looked down to see that the rest of my body was there. \\n  \\n At this point, both of us definitely high, I began doodling little clockwork contraptions on some paper I had brought, while Jack read an H.G. Wells story out loud. Unfortunately I am not an artist, because I would love to have seen the intricate wire automata I was imagining take shape on paper. \\n  \\n When the story was finished, set down our respective items and turned to look out over the lake. The sky, clouds, and water--which had been beautiful before--now turned into a glorious panorama of shifting fractals and layered polygons. We moved to a grassy area by the water and lay on the ground, looking up through the branches of a pine tree into the sky. \\n  \\n The clouds we saw then--and at which we continued to marvel for the rest of the day--were some of the most ethereal and moving things I have ever witnessed. At their edges, wisps of vapor curled out into the shining sky, transforming and curling in on themselves faster than our eyes could keep track of them. We laughed out loud at this, then looked into the clouds' centers, where darker bulges billowed out of striated sheets of pure white, each of these shifting at speed. We discussed mathematical fractals and their appearances in nature (mostly myself teaching Jack, as I am a scientist and he an actor). Since that day, I have looked at clouds whenever possible, and never have I seen internal motion--that is to say, not movement across the sky, as these were stationary--as quick or intricate as we saw on that day. \\n  \\n After this we went back to the picnic table and attempted to create a cosmos of our own, using his notebook to draft a sort of 'map.' All we ended up with was two axes of creation: 'Everything' vs. 'Nothing' and 'Chaos' vs. 'Order,' each represented with a different set of squiggles or highlighter marks. We decided that Art, Definition, Religion and Science were respectively subsets of these four, their mortally-attainable representations. Then we got a bit off-track, saying that where Everything and Chaos met they formed ripples of Possibility. We then abandoned this, and Jack is left with a baffling illustration upside-down in his notebook. \\n  \\n Most of the rest of the day was spent wandering around the island, which was heavily wooded over most of its area wit ha few rock-and-grass promontories, talking and reading out loud a book I had found in my backpack. The book, Lempriere's Dictionary, is written in a fantastical, eloquent style and deals with the interplay of mythology and history. It is a significant work in itself, and the Europa gave it a deep, resonating symbolism that rooted both of us into its world. (We spent the rest of the road trip finishing this book together). \\n  \\n Our conversations revolved mostly around our conceptions of other people and their conceptions of themselves. Jack and I are both passionate about our chosen fields: myself astrophysics, him acting. He opined that it must be terrifying for people of our age to enter college not knowing what they wanted to do with their lives; I countered, saying that in fact that was the express purpose of college for 90% of teenagers. He ceded the point. Most of our conversations followed this pattern: one of us would express a lengthy thought, the other would point out a flaw or interesting facet, and we spun from there. We observed at length how fantastic a substance 2C-E is: despite the fact that it is looked upon as a negative drug, two teenagers can take it and spend a beautiful day on an island in the middle of a lake while tripping balls on it, all in perfect safety. \\n  \\n Since we were talking to each other for a fair portion of the day, I ended up looking at Jack's face a fair amount. Human features are especially beautiful on 2C-E--soft, flowing, and delicate, even when none of those adjectives would apply while sober. I would later see the same thing in my face in the mirror: my stubble, my jawline, my eyebrows all seemed gently sketched by a talented artist. \\n  \\n After a while we drifted back to our table. It was approaching dinner time, and we had been sent with lunch prepared by my aunts as well as several beers--all untouched, as while on Europa neither of us has any appetite whatsoever for anything but water (of which we had been drinking plenty). I contacted my aunts and told them we would eat leftovers from lunch for dinner and be home late. We then proceeded to attempt eating. Though the food tasted fine, swallowing was distinctly unpleasant--I felt that I could feel the food in my throat long after I should have been able to, so I stopped eating. \\n  \\n Eventually, after around nine hours on the island, we motored back home. I was still a bit high, and when I entered to find a group of family and friends eager to ask my about my prospective career, I let my trip give them wild (but completely accurate) descriptions of multivariable calculus, observational astronomy, and higher spatial dimensions. It proved an enjoyable (and, to them, completely sober-seeming) hour or so of conversation, after which Jack and I retreated to the basement and played cards for a while before going to bed. Even while drifting off to sleep--at least twelve hours after taking the pill--I felt the soothing oddness of fabric against my skin.

{"id": "uUX3ToZ0BtycHW9VgV3ZCzJ24C4CmqNk3748Ip9wxa8", "title": "Economic Software 1945-2021", "body": "> Now, I have to tell you Kennedy isn’t making these rules up. They did become orthodoxy in advanced-economy treasuries in the 1980s. They’re the reason John Kerin’s budget of 1991, delivered in the depths of \"the recession we \\[didn’t\\] have to have\" contained zero stimulus, meaning the stimulus, when it came in February 1992, came too late.\n\nThis view isn't wide enough and lacks all the details. The worlds entire global economy software was changed, not just ours, under the guidance of Milton Friedman.\n\n1945-1980 - Computer software No.2:\n\nAfter WW2, the world's economy would be restored with the USD. The policy target would be full employment as this was believed to stop the rise of fascists again (they need to look at this again). We had homogenous national economies, we all produced most of the same stuff, fridges, cars etc... There was restricted financial markets. Growth would be lead by wage growth, high taxes and transfers would be the government's steering mechanism for the economy, and the government kept much of the commanding heights of industry under democratic/national capital control - Telekom,TRT etc - again a steering mechanism to make sure this form of capitalism worked. No one gave a shit who ran the central bank and no one knew their name.\n\nA lot of this came from the ideas of economist John Maynard Keynes, and his ideas are credited for getting the world out of the great depression when the Friedmanite types wanted to do nothing (let the market fix itself, it's magic!)\n\nI've posted this quote from Keynes' book - The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money - here before, but I'll do it again, as it's a good summarisation of the key concept behind the 1945-1980 era.\n\n> \"If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coalmines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again (the right to do so being obtained, of course, by tendering for leases of the note-bearing territory), there need be no more unemployment and, with the help of the repercussions, the real income of the community, and its capital wealth also, would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is. It would, indeed, be more sensible to build houses and the like; but if there are political and practical difficulties in the way of this, the above would be better than nothing.\"\n\nAs opposed to Milton Friedman's right wing capitalist fairy tale of the market will fix itself.\n\nThere is a bug in this post WW2 software, as is with all forms of capitalism (why people like Marx thought capitalism was always in a crisis), which led to the stagflation crisis - which led to the global software reboot. We are led to believe that creating money creates inflation. While this can be true in certain circumstances and if it is abused too far, it's not the key driver. During this post WW2 era, full employment and strong labour led to high wage growth. For capitalists to keep paying workers more and to see their ROI's, they needed advancements in productivity and they had to raise prices. Eventually, the bug hit and inflation rose so high they didn't want to invest - so they withheld their capital, a capital strike.\n\nThe stagflation crisis. During this post WW2 era, it was a debtors paradise. You'd borrow money for houses and whatever, and because of the inflation, it was easy to pay the money back. Boomers had banks eat half their mortgages in inflation. The problem arose when it went so high that capital didn't want to invest. Inflation can be a good thing, right now, we're in a private debt hole and inflation would help us get out of it. Inflation too low is as bad as too high. Today, it is too low. Money creation is not raising inflation, not even when many trillions were dumped into the global economy after 2008 - Milton Friedman and his laissez-faire hacks were wrong. Full employment and strong labour drove inflation, not money creation.\n\nWe see an immense amount of money creation today both through governments and through the financial system, and inflation is extremely low. I remember watching all the laissez-faire hacks screaming after the 2008 crisis that QE would bring hyper-inflation (and they urged you to buy their gold)... It of course never happened. Inflation didn't budge.\n\nWhile something had to be done to fix the stagflation crisis, capital took advantage of the crisis and swung everything too far in their favour. We just needed to bring down inflation partially, not all the way. There's a few mechanisms for this and we didn't need to destroy labour in the process.\n\nSo we get to 1980-2008, computer software No.3:\n\nThe policy target changes from full employment to price stability. The value of capital is to be \"restored\". The mechanism is maximum global integration and deregulated financial markets. The price of money shoots through the roof to slow inflation. The welfare state is to be wound back. Labour markets would become \"flexible\". Growth would now be led by profits, not wage growth (any wonder why wages are going flat). The steering mechanism of democracy and national capital would be ended and this would be handed over to private capital. Suddenly, everyone knows who runs the central banks - because the price of money becomes so important.\n\nThere would be low taxes and low transfers (the redistribution). Inflation is brought to extremely low levels. Because wage growth no longer drove growth, it's now dependent on a credit bubble - and thus the bug of this Milton Friedman/neoliberal software hits. People can only borrow so much money, especially when their wages aren't rising and the low inflation isn't eating any of the debt. The extremely low inflation is a creditors paradise - until the debts can't be paid back. The whole thing blows up in 2008 and we're in a kind of limbo, transition phase.\n\nIt's near dead, but the capitalist class have put the system onto life support by dumping massive amounts of money into the world's economies (money that goes mostly to the top) while telling the plebs they need to live within their means.\n\nThis should all sound really familiar to people across the world. It wasn't something that was just done here. For some reason, we're in a global economy and people still view the system through a national lens. Just as in the past, we'll change our software when capitalist power changes theirs. We seem to be unable to deal with it democratically and nationally, with a neoliberal media filling heads with bad ideas.\n\nFrom a capitalist perspective (I don't even consider myself a capitalist, I think the world has to do better for many reasons - especially environmental sustainability), we need to bring back some of the 1945-1980 software. We see fascism rising across the world today, and full employment is what deals with that, just as it did in the past. We need higher inflation and wage growth, just not too high. The problem is capitalism is near impossible, perhaps impossible to manage well. It always falls into a pile of shit. Albert Einstein did not call capitalism \"economic anarchy\" for no reason.\n\nIn a globalised world, it won't be possible to go back to completely homogenous national economies, but we can partially do this. The key is the policy target. Full employment and wage growth over price stability and profit growth. There is also another key. Stop listening to the cheerleaders of free-markets. They believe in 18th-century fairy tales about what capitalism is and what it can achieve. They are ideological and frankly, religious about markets. Their economic models have numbers that stack up on paper, but they don't reflect the reality of capitalism. They've never been taught anything critical about capitalism.\n\nProfessor Richard Wolff is an economist who has degrees from Harvard, Stanford and Yale, and he says it clearly - I was never taught anything critical about capitalism, just a big song and dance about how perfect it is. If you want to understand the flaws of capitalism, you need to hear its critics, not its cheerleaders. Some capitalists are rational... Business Insider recommends their viewership to read Karl Marx - so they can better understand the flaws of this system. They don't play a childish propaganda game that Marx was Satan himself.\n\nI am by no means a Paul Krugman fan. Krugman's idiocy (and most of the economist class) is what led us down this hole. But I'll give him this. Eventually, he saw that his globalised, neoliberal capitalist fairy tales from the 90's were wrong.\n\n> “Economists, as a group, mistook beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth.” - Paul Krugman.", "timestamp": 1633475059, "digest": "AbLnwaOjI-LZnTsquAuIXCV5tFKVk6aHgH_5OmmgEsY", "contributor": "0x60a87118C2B06b0a8E08AbB61D340f27f07F660d"}

Zuck gets lucky, codes a MySpace knock-off that just happens to catch on, and becomes a multi-billionaire. Ok, well, in that chain of events he hasn't exactly murdered children or anything heinous. Yes, he was demonstrably \"not a great guy\" even in the beginning, but loads of awful people win the lottery to0, that's the nature of a probabilistic universe. So it goes.\n\nBut it's how these billionaires act *after* they get that wealth that continues to build the anger and resentment towards them. Just look at Mark Zuckerberg. Some billionaires blunder into their wealth, some (Putin) murder and steal their way to it, but these are single events, in essence. It isn't merely someone *having* billions of dollars that is the greatest threat, it's them *using* it not only to accumulate *more* wealth, but to do it *directly* through utilizing that wealth to leech power, agency, and resources from all those around them. And for *what*? That's the irony. These people become *more* vampiric *after* reaching a point where they have absolutely no *need for* for the resources.\n\nI *get* why a starving man murders another for a loaf of bread. I *get* why a drug addict robs a bank. These are awful acts, but they make *sense*. Desperation and fear, they are the most powerful of motivators across the entire animal kingdom. But billionaires exhibit these behaviors at the *top*, and at a certain point, what they keep doing stops making any sense from any rational perspective.\n\nMark has more money then he can ever spend in his entire life. And he is continually getting dragged before congress and eviscerated in the media, he looks like fucking garbage, and all for what? For *more* money? To hold on to his shitty Boomer Brainwashing app?\n\nHe could quit this bullshit, leave it to middle men, and start a project to counteract global warming. He could try to build something new and useful to society, and people like that, too, he'll get more money the legitimate way. He could start a coding lab and hire the best coders to build crazy and fun shit and not even worry about whether it made money, he could just spend his entire life doing that and funding that lab while his fortune whittled away, because, why not? Or he could just buy an island, fill it with 1,000 bikini models staffing a luxury resort made only for him, and live the rest of his life in unimaginable ease and comfort and hedonism.\n\nBut what the fuck is he doing instead? Looking like an idiot and getting his ass handed to him on live TV by a 10-month old congresswoman. Getting memed and berated and vilified across the entire internet *because he's an asshole*. Going to god-knows how many speaking coaches and still coming out looking like a nervous little toad. What a disastrous waste of time and wealth. There is definitely a legitimate mental disorder that comes along with that much wealth. If they weren't so evil and destructive, you'd feel bad for these people that have more than nearly anyone else ever, and are trapped in a cycle of addiction and destruction. Money money everywhere, and not a dollar to buy happiness and peace.\n\nMark made billions inventing a tool that has made the world, and everyone in it, worse off for it. He will go down in history as a footnote, an awkward little joke of a man, stiff and robotic, propping up the dumbest President in the history of Presidents because he's scared a big mean lady will come and break apart the shitty, horrible thing he built.\n\nThese people are destroying the world *and* themselves for something they are so far beyond needing. It's absurd.\n\nThe discourse around wealth is preposterous. I hold nothing against people who inherit money or make more money. I believe everyone should be granted the ability to live in comfort, but some people strive for more and achieve more and they ought to be paid more for their talents and effort.\n\nBut I don't believe these people should have dramatically more voice and influence in a government that is supposed to, by design, treat all people equally. I don't believe that they should be permitted to make a hobby out of further exploiting and impoverishing other people for money they don't even need.\n\nSometimes I really marvel at how no one ever seems to ask *why* they do the things they do, or whether they even need to do them.\n\nI look at Mark Zuckerberg and feel such waste. These people are like Walter White at the end of Breaking Bad. They have everything, everything they could ever need, but it turns out it's only their shitty, horrible, destructive empire that gives them any purpose anymore. So they keep digging, keep doing bad and worse things to hold on to something that they only use to validate their sad little lives.\n\nAll that fortune, and all so that weak, pathetic people can feel like whole humans.\n\nZuckerberg should have cashed out in his twenties and just lived his life. This sad little man is going to end up wasting his entire life aspiring to be a Big Boy that he never was and never will be, to build an Empire that no one gives a shit about and that sucks the joy out of the world like a cancer.\n\nJust like so many of the billionaires of the world. If the vast, vast majority of billionaires are any indication, it's far more a curse than it is a gift. They're just sad, naked apes chained to the inertia of their own mountain of money, dragged along by it, following a script, forever apart from the rest of humankind, forever despised by and despising their fellow man.", "timestamp": 1633475526, "digest": "xftLKrVD5aSGexCH9olwWaf_fOdK5QgGwDtD41rGfxo", "contributor": "0x60a87118C2B06b0a8E08AbB61D340f27f07F660d"}
{"id": "dFroBOHI6nop9eu50c3EY2euGg05iKAxeu7kHLQtoBk", "title": "Chapter One: Vapor", "body": "*Shit.*\n\nI yanked my finger away from the spiral groove I’d been tracing in an oak table. It had been carved with some dull blade who knows how long ago. The table looked ancient—nothing more than rotting planks of wood strapped together by rusted iron bands—except for the smoke-filled glass protruding from its centre.\n\nWith clenched teeth I snagged the splinter sticking out of my skin, then shook the pain out and winced. An orb of translucent metal swung back and forth in the draft of night air that seeped into the pub through cracked walls and thin windows. Fluorescent light flickered inside. It was Colonist tech—probably third gen. I pulled my cloak tighter, sheltering against the brisk evening. The chill added to my irritation; the struggle taking place in front of me was taking too long.\n\n“Did I forget to mention it’s your turn?” I asked with bite.\n\nMy opponent didn’t even pretend to notice me. A heavy sigh escaped my lips and I leaned back in my rickety chair. My fingers wandered back to the groove. I didn’t know what else to do with myself, so I just held my breath and stared across the table and continued tracing, forcing thoughts out of my head. I tried not to drive myself into a fury as boredom set in and dulled my senses. I closed my eyes. This was always the worst part.\n\n“So, who you for?” I asked.\n\nSilence. The hulking figure sitting on the other side of the table continued to ignore me, unwilling to break his concentration.\n\n“I’m guessing the Mothers, right?” I continued. “Yeah, that’s gotta be it. Those robes give you away. They’re too clean—ain’t no soot on them—and I see too much red.”\n\nThat earned a glance up at me and away from the arena.\n\n“Hah, I knew it. See a lot of shit doing what I do—lotta people, and the things that drive them.”\n\n“You talk a lot.” The response was more rumble than speech, and it was telling. On the next flicker of light from the swaying orb, I looked closer at my opponent’s hood and saw pointed protrusions from where ears should have been.\n\n*Fuck.*\n\nMy opponent was Shek—don’t know how I missed it. These bastards were a plague on the Saved World, but they mostly stuck to the Last City with the cartels. What the hell was it doing out here?\n\n“Sorry—old habits.” I said. “I’m on the road so much and I’ve only got Blink to talk to.”\n\nAt the sound of his name, my Whippet raised his head and perked his ears. He leered at me, unblinking and dutifully awaited orders. Good dog, that one. He was one of a kind, a relic, and had been expensive as hell. I told him to go back to sleep, so he did.\n\nI noticed the Shek staring at my dog. The bristles beneath the Shek’s cloak weren’t visible, but I knew they’d be standing on end—razor sharp spikes prickling out of its spine.\n\n“Don’t worry. I think you can take him.” I smiled.\n\nThe Shek shot his blood red eyes at me before returning his attention to the game.\n\n“You been towing for the Mothers for long, Shek?”\n\nI needed answers. It was strange to see a Shek in these parts—stranger still to see someone wearing cartel colours. It bugged me.\n\nThe Shek finally rumbled a response: “They pay well.”\n\nAh, there it is. This Shek was here for me. I should have known I’d be found eventually.\n\n“Oh, I’ve no doubt. Let me guess: bounty hunter?” I spoke loud enough for all to hear.\n\nImmediate tension flooded the pub and drowned its patrons. A dozen other conversations hushed. Drinks stopped sloshing on the floor and were set down on tables. Hazy eyes clouded by ale became refocused, all pointing our way.\n\nThe Shek didn’t react. It was all the answer I needed.\n\n“Gotcha.”\n\nThe Shek’s eyes burned beneath its hood and an even deeper rumble shook from within. It was laughing. “We have you.”\n\nThe corners of my mouth turned up. “Is that right?”\n\nThe Shek didn’t answer. Instead, it finally decided on its play and hunched closer to the table. Wisps of light danced out of its outstretched fingers and converged between clawed hands now sticking out from its robes. The light swirled into it coalesced into a pulsing ball of light. The ball grew and intensified, and when it seemed as though it would hit a critical mass and explode, consuming the pub and everyone inside, it suddenly went completely still and assumed a form of solid, blue incandescence.\n\nThe form was a medieval warrior dragging a comically-large axe behind it. Sparks shot up from where the axe raked against the table as it made its way into the middle of the arena.\n\nI barely contained explosive laughter and looked at the snarling bounty-hunter.\n\n“Seriously? It took you half an hour to do that?”\n\nThe Shek’s fangs glistened and its eyes burned hotter, but it stayed still. “Your words will not save you.”\n\n“Can I ask you something? How much are the Mothers paying to take me down? I’m curious. Last week I was way up north in and heard something about what the Fathers were offering, and, frankly, I was shocked. There’s no way the Mothers would pay that well—are they?”\n\nThe Shek shook off my question. “Time to lose.”\n\nI decided I’d had enough. “No, I don’t think so.”\n\nI hunched forward and examined the game state. Several red, ephemeral figures were spread out in the large and hollow sphere embedded in the middle of the oak table. The forms inside were basic cylinders and took no other shape. They were pitifully small and not at all intimidating compared to the bounty hunter’s blue axe-man—by design.\n\nI chuckled and wondered how long it would take these roaming mercenaries to figure out the system I had conjured years ago while huddled in the corner of an alley in some broken town, sheltering myself from unnatural rain. It had just come to me, and right there, in the pouring wet and filth, I had worked out an idea in my head. Red light had sparked between my fingers and danced in the rain. I must have looked like a homeless lunatic driven mad trying to conquer the secrets of Vapor, as most did in these forsaken times.\n\nI looked up at the Shek and stretched out my hand, a gesture of civility.\n\nIt didn’t understand. “What is that?”\n\nI was offering him a way out. It was the decent thing to do, I guess, and I wasn’t sure why I kept putting a draw out there for lesser challengers, game after game after game. Maybe it was just my dumb luck that no one had ever accepted.\n\nThe bounty hunter rumbled and bristled, ready to seize its prey. Then it shook its head and snapped its jaws.\n\n“If you insist,” I said, turning back to the game and giving the closing some final thoughts. It would be closer than I liked, but I was confident. And tonight, I was trying something new.\n\nMy hands began to do their work and a familiar hum filled the air. My face glowed red behind my own ball of energy. At the point the humming reached its crescendo, no similar axe-wielding form emerged. Instead, twin beams drifted forward like grasping hands. They worked their way across the table, slowly, and entered the hollow sphere, heading straight for my little cylinders.\n\nThe Shek watched, confused. Throughout the evening I had witnessed the Shek’s tactics. They had been pathetically basic and straightforward. Most played like this. It was a product of battling in seedy pubs on the outskirts of civilization for scraps from the warring factions’ tables: Mothers, Fathers, or Unknown...it didn’t matter. They all went after the same thing the same way.\n\nMy new gameplay was getting attention, and the Shek wasn’t the only dumbfounded person in this shithole. Drunken observers had inched closer and closer until they were standing in a circle around the table, taking in something they’d never seen before\n\nAll hell broke loose when the twin beams hit the cylinders. The beams, previously slow, accelerated to incredible speeds upon first contact. They streaked between each cylinder, clockwise, forming a solid ring of light around the bounty-hunter’s blue avatar. The opponent’s axe was woefully ineffective as it swung around and around trying to chop the energy field. It was painfully clear that the Shek’s axe-man was doomed. The solid ring of light was constricting and would soon consume the figure.\n\nAt the last moment, the ring of light pulsed outwards and cascaded through the pub. For a brief instant, I could see every crack in every wall and all the insects scurrying to find dark shelter. I could see the awestruck faces of the toothless villagers and the padded bras hiding beneath the serving girl’s chests. Most importantly, I could see the anger roiling on the scaled face of the Shek sitting across from me.\n\nIt was over in less than a second after the twin beams had hit the cylinders. A chain reaction of energy spun exponentially until it unleashed a tidal wave of searing light that melted the blue axe-man into oblivion. The hollow sphere powered down, indicating the end of the match. I had won—again.\n\n“I hope the Mothers didn’t pay you an advance.” I rose from the table. No bounty would be collected tonight.\n\nBut then the bounty hunter did something I did not expect. In a display of sheer physical power, the Shek lunged back from the table and threw off its cloak, revealing its monolithic reptilian frame and gnashing fangs. All that separated me from the space monster was a rusty oak table.\n\n“Seriously?” In times of panic, sometimes the only thing the mind can do is ridicule.\n\nThe Shek snarled.\n\n“Ok, whatever,” I said, hoping I sounded braver than I felt. “Go and pout somewhere else.”\n\nI was not prepared for what came next. The Shek pounced across the table with an aim to rip off my head. It didn’t get far. A wall of energy emanated from the Vapor table and sprung up between me and the lunging Shek. The Shek’s burning red eyes widened at the last moment, aware of the new obstruction, but its inertia was too much, and there was an audible crunch as its frame impacted the barrier. The Shek crumpled to the floor, tangled in its blood-red robes.\n\nI’d been playing Vapor for a long time, but I’d never seen anything like this. I figured there’d be some sort of anti-rage protection for all the sore losers. The Colonists had loved violence, but not against each other.\n\nQuiet lingered in the pub. No one knew what had happened. I braced my hands on the table and pushed myself standing, then turned to face the murmuring crowd. They were hidden in the dark again. Flickers from the swaying orb light lit up the shock on their dumb faces.\n\nIt was time to leave.\n\n“C’mon, Blink. Let’s get the hell out of here.”\n\nThe Whippet jumped from its bed of straw and pranced to my side. It had a pure white and fawn coat and walked around like nobility. It was a creature from another time—one where nobility still existed.\n\nWe brushed passed the onlookers and made for the exit. It was howling wind outside, and the first flakes of winter were settling on the muddy ground. I pulled Blink’s coat from my sack and draped it around him. He wasn’t meant for this kind of weather.\n\nNeither was I, for that matter. I pulled my collar up around my face and tilted my head forward, bracing against the stinging cold.\n\n*Onward.*\n\n[crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633475698, "digest": "j1FVpY07rcejZlUmM8bSl4agAY5WyPnnX3wpcwESln8", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "-jSgExNtirlISv3n4vbOK0TV4UXVG9r64tJ9Qia0pWk", "title": "Chapter One: The Slaves of Yerushem", "body": "“Your life means nothing,” spat the tyrant. He lashed his reed, long and thin and strong and trailing braided parchment. His strike cracked open wounds not yet healed, and blood seeped over red-stained skin—a fresh coat to ensure the ever-presence of the pain and consequence of the tyrants, brutes empowered by the Authority of Zayeen.\n\nThe slave Diaden did not cry out, as doing so would only invite another blow. Instead, he pushed harder against the plank jutting out from the chariot that had until then been carrying a pair of important patricians—aristocrats with the added benefit of being a part of the Authority’s diplomatic service—along the road north to Yerushem, the capital city and home to the young imperator. The slave Joben pushed hard on the other side of the chariot even as he was whipped again. But despite Diaden’s and Joben’s exertions, the wheels of the chariot would not budge from the mud in which they had sunk. They were left to catch their breath and wipe the sweat from their brows. It was an especially hot day, even by summer standards—and it was always hot in Zayeen. When one asked how much hotter it may get, the answer was we’ll know when the Joona runs dry and the sands of Etial turn to glass.\n\n“Useless,” said the tyrant Tolvar, and he punctuated his statement with another set of lashes, drawing more blood from scarred tissue. He then walked away to liaise with the patricians, who had become threatened with a walk along the road in their ornate leathers and heavy robes, ridiculous attire for a long journey with no shade. The occupants of several accompanying chariots looked upon the slaves with squinted eyes under furrowed brows, as if it was their fault. Though the other chariots were not stuck, none could abandon the safety of the procession, so in the mud they had found themselves nonetheless. Each chariot sported banners and awnings displaying the proud eagle of the Zayeen, and while each sheltered from the sun, they hung limp, moved by no wind, no breeze to tease away the sun’s vengeful kiss.\n\nThe slave Diaden noticed, too, so when he fell back into the mud, exhausted, he found it quite surprising to find the mud cool on his skin and quick to dry. To his knowledge, there was no mud to be found along this road—and had travelled many in his life before slavery, and during—for where was there any water in the middle of the country, so far from the coast, the Joona River, or the Gulel lake?\n\nCovering his eyes to shield the rays of the blazing sun, he peered ahead to where Tolvar jabbered at the patricians and made heavy motions, his reed still hanging from his arm, braids flailing about in the dryness of the early afternoon. Despite his pleading, the soured faces of the patricians did not improve. Diaden strained to make out the conversation, but only heard a few words—important words.\n\n“Summon… Magus...not far.”\n\nDiaden looked over at Joben, who lay flat in the mud and caked his body with the substance, giggling to himself as he did. “Did he say Magus?”\n\n“Sounded like it,” Joben replied with a lilt. The boy bled from his lip, and one of his eyes was swollen shut, but his mood stayed light, as always. Diaden nodded but said nothing more. He looked up into a cloudless sky, squinting in the shine. Perhaps if he blinded himself there would be no use for him. *No*, he thought. The tyrants would find something for him to do. And he still wanted to live to see the sun rise the next day, and the next. No one knew what the future held—so it was said by Nefari.\n\n*“What remains after the sun sets?*” he recalled probing the tribe’s elder on a day he had found himself alone with the old woman. *“If we knew, why would we close our eyes at night?”* she had replied with all the wisdom she carried.\n\nTolvar returned from his parley. Diaden scampered to his feet, bringing himself to attention, and wiped dried mud from his limbs. He kicked dirt at Joben, and the boy, too, stood up and cleaned off. Flakes crumbled to the ground around them. They were pillars of ash amidst a scorched earth.\n\nWhen Tolvar arrived, he eyed the pair with contempt as he passed by. Then he jumped into the chariot and laid back, kicking his feet up over the side and bracing his head with meaty paws. “Go,” he commanded. “We will need food and water for five.”\n\nJoben winced as Diaden protested. “There is food in the stores,” said the slave Diaden. Joben did not enjoy the same relations with the tyrant as Diaden. The boy didn’t understand.\n\nDiaden was right about the food, of course. The chariot was laden with supplies for the journey. They had travelled many leagues north from the southern city of Etial, jewel of the southern province, but had barely scratched the surface of the resources available. They could have travelled many more leagues if needed, and the abundance seemed a waste but for the aristocratic passengers, who demanded luxury at all times. In the end, Diaden’s rightness meant nothing, and he expected another lashing for the audacity of speaking without invitation.\n\nNone came. Tolvar did not move from his relaxed posture, but his biceps bulged. “Do not speak again. Go find food.” Tolvar was never angry when most dangerous. It was the calm way in which he delivered his words Diaden had come to fear.\n\nJoben looked at Diaden in his way, one green eye pleading, face turned down and chin pointing toward the field to the side of the road. No doubt he worried Diaden would continue to be defiant and earn them punishment. Joben was the weaker of the two, but Diaden could not allow himself to be reckless with another’s life. It was not the Nefari way.\n\nSo he stayed silent as he turned his back to the chariot and dragged mud-caked feet into the patchwork of grass dotting the rolling fields of the countryside. Joben hurried alongside, and they walked together with noses down, searching the parched earth beneath them for signs of berries. They saw several ground vermin scampering about, but Tolvar would not feed the patricians so poorly, nor allow the tortured pair to eat so well. Berries for the aristocratic passengers would be best, and if lucky the tyrant may allow water from the stores.\n\n“Do you really think a Magus is coming to help us, Diaden?” Joben’s question bore a hint of wonder. Diaden considered long before answering—perhaps too long, as Joben began to shuffle his feet and wring his hands. The older of them took a deep breath and—\n\n*An ocean breeze*?\n\nA crisp wind had sprung up from nowhere, carrying memories Diaden could never forget. Had they wandered so far outland from the roadway they’d approached the coast? It would explain the presence of mud along roads showing a faint rust. Diaden remembered the orange affectations clearly. He had been shocked to see the road in disarray, unkempt and vegetation allowed to grow over the intricate and iron-lined bricks laid long ago.\n\nHad the patricians this far east neglected to maintain their structures? Diaden could not imagine the architecture of Yerushem left to decay. No wonder rebellion had sprung in Solem, the western city at the cusp of the sea—or so he’d heard. Many things were said in the darkness of the pits, after the day’s labour, when lips were loose and minds weak—whether fact or fiction, Diaden could not say.\n\n“*The sky is blue, and the grass is green*,” Diaden recalled saying. “*How do you know?*” had come the elder’s reply, accompanied by a wry smile. *“I see it,”* he had said. The elder had not accepted the obvious answer. *“But do I?”* she had asked. *“You must!”* he had exclaimed. *“Why? Why must I?*” They had spent the rest of their afternoon going back and forth in this way, until finally the elder had said only, *“Live with one brow raised*.*”* He had not understood. Many years later, Diaden realized the importance of scrutiny—the need to resist the sway of emotion and the moment. This paradigm had served Diaden well throughout his life, although it had done nothing to prevent a fate controlled by the tyrants.\n\n“I don’t know,” Diaden answered Joben at last. “We could not break free the chariot, and the patricians will need to be getting places and attending to things in Yerushem. The tyrant cannot afford their ire. It might be true.”\n\nJoben appeared enthused. “I’ve never seen one—a Magus. I’ve only heard stories.”\n\nDiaden offered nothing in reply. Sometimes there was no value in speaking the truth—or in speaking words at all, for that matter. The elder had taught him as much, and so it was said by Nefari. Joben would not understand, and if he were to try he would never let Diaden be free of his questions and ponderings.\n\n“Up ahead!” Joben exclaimed, breaking Diaden’s thoughts as the boy pointed to a prominent mound of grass tipped with bushes sporting different-coloured berries. It was a Fasha bush—rare, indeed. Diaden remember picking from them as a child to stock for the Nefari’s monthly moon festivals. The memory of the sweetness of the berries permeated his mouth, only to be masked by the desiccated reality of the arid landscape. While Joben ran to the bush, Diaden walked, suddenly saddened by circumstance.\n\nWhen Joben arrived at the top of the mound, he did not immediately begin to scavenge, or risk filling his mouth with berries to let loose their flavourful juices. Instead he stood still as a flag with no wind to fly, and gazed east, beyond the mound on which he was erected. Diaden wanted to see what had captured his attention, and finally began to move his feet with haste, scrambling the last few steps up the hill.\n\nAnd then he saw.\n\nThey stood at the crest of a valley, amidst the foothills stretching south from the Rocca mountains, whose snowy peaks could be seen far in the distance to the north, much further than Yerushem. They overlooked the sea, a vast pool of water stretching across the horizon and shimmering with the reflection of the sun. They looked down into the bottom of the valley, next to the coast, and the city of Solem.\n\nThe image below him was haunting.\n\nSolem was a beautiful city, full with many tall structures of intricate designs, circled by a sculpted, curving wall at its base, tallest where the tide flowed inward. Gulls swooped overhead and called out to each other, and Diaden was calmed by the gentle crashing of waves over silk-white sand. He had not seen the sea for many years, but it had not changed, still majestic, a waving blanket of crystal blue. The breeze caressed his skin, refreshing his pores and invading his nostrils, and tears welled in his eyes. In all his travels with the Nefari around the small country of Zayeen, it was there in the east, at the precipice of the sea, where he had once found his peace. His love.\n\nFor a moment, however fleeting, he found it again. For a moment, sand squished between his toes and laughter rippled around him—innocent and joyful. For a moment, he ran on the beach, and she ran beside him, grabbing at his hand and pleading for him to slow down, only to surge ahead when he did. For a moment, he was happy.\n\nThe memory passed, and Diaden looked down on pillars of smoke rising from different locations within the city. No caravans or lines of traders filtered in and out, as he would have expected from a large metropolis. The streets of Yerushem, for instance, were filled with a constant stream to and from the gates, feeding the great markets and the grand establishments of the Zayeen Authority. But there, just below, Solem did not glitter with a flow of life. It was a skeleton—a fossil—serving to caution those who might seek its shelter or the fancy it might have offered. Diaden did not know what was taking place behind the high walls, but there was no emanating vibrancy—no spirit.\n\n“Why is it burning?” asked Joben.\n\n“Revolution,” said Diaden. He surprised himself with certainty.\n\n“What does that mean?” The boy’s question was innocent, and the struggle to understand played across his face in a furrowed brow and narrowed eye.\n\n“There are men and women like us, Joben, all over Zayeen. Even there,” Diaden pointed, “in Solem. They are resisting.”\n\n“But aren’t there tyrants?” Joben asked.\n\n“There are probably many.”\n\n“Won’t they hurt them?” The boy was too young for this.\n\n“They likely will.”\n\nJoben scrunched his face. “I don’t understand,” he said.\n\nDiaden rested his arm on the boy’s shoulders. Together they looked down upon Solem, but they saw different things. It was not Joben’s fault. He was born in the pits. His mind was not given time to grow, or to flourish.\n\n“Sometimes,” said Diaden, “it makes sense to risk pain for the sake of an idea.” Despite his attempt, this only confused Joben more, but the boy hid it well. He nodded and continued to gaze into the bed of the valley.\n\nA horn blew behind them, back from where they left the chariot in the mud. The tyrant had summoned their return.\n\n“Quick,” Diaden said to Joben. “Gather as many berries as you can.” He obeyed, and each filled their pockets and sacks. Diaden whispered a silent farewell to the coastal vista, but kept the image in the forefront of his mind as he rushed back to the chariot with Joben, bending stalks of grass beneath his hurried tread. He allowed the memory of smoke and desolation to fade into a background of august delight, and chose instead to remember the beauty at the edge of the sea.\n\nThey were not long in their return to the chariot, and on arrival a new figure stood with the tyrant and the patricians, lightly dressed in a sleeveless white shirt and loose-fitting white pants, each billowing in the wind. Diaden could sense the subtle tinge of salt in the air he had missed until standing atop the mount and overlooking the city and the sea, and wondered if they smelled it, too. It is likely they always knew where they were, and how close they were to the open waters at Zayeen’s eastern border, so far from the central roadway connecting the four provinces of the country, and the great cities throughout.\n\n“Bring it here,” said the tyrant, gesturing to the sacks they carried. They obliged, opening it to reveal the berries within. Tolvar reached in for a handful and stuffed them in his mouth, squishing them with his teeth until trickles of red and blue appeared at the corners of his lips, which he licked away.\n\n“Delicious,” he said. “Herus, Daphnus, come—enjoy this feast while the Magus works.” He grabbed the sacks and brought them to the patricians. “You two,” he pointed, “take some water from the stores. Not too much. I will not have you dying on the way to Yerushem.”\n\n“Thank you,” they replied together. The tyrant only scoffed as he began to feed the patricians. Joben moved to the back of the chariot to begin the search for water in the stores, but Diaden stood still, curious and wishing to ask the tyrant a question, even knowing to do so would invite repercussions.\n\n“Were you not afraid we would abscond?” he asked. Joben cowered.\n\nTolvar looked at Diaden with a deadly gaze, and were it not for the feast of fruit affecting his mood, he might have struck his reed. He did not, though; instead, he allowed contempt to drip from his voice as he responded slowly.\n\n“Where would you have absconded?” asked the tyrant.\n\n“We are very near the sea,” he continued unafraid, like a true Nefari. “Can you smell the salt air? It’s there, even if just a hint. And Solem is not far—just over those mounds and down to the coast. I saw it with my own eyes.” He pointed to where they had been.\n\nTolvar considered. His jaw clenched at an angle and his nostrils flared. But his eyes stayed cool and steady, as did the tenor of his voice and cadence of his speech. “You imagine escaping to the lost city?” he said at last.\n\n*Ah*. The tyrant confirmed rebellion in Solem, though Diaden found it curious to consider the city lost. Even he, a tyrant, appeared to have heard the rumours. No doubt the aristocracy had concerned themselves with the plight of Solem’s governance. How long would they allow the city to fend for itself? Diaden caught himself before thinking too deeply, pursuing a rabbit down a hole when a wolf waited nearby.\n\n“I do not imagine escaping,” Diaden said, careful in the tyrant’s presence. Even then he began to doubt the limits he had pushed. “I only ask for your concern.”\n\n“It is not your place to wonder about my concern,” the tyrant snapped, but did not strike. Tolvar only gave Diaden half his attention, too focused on the patricians who gleefully gourded themselves on berries. “There is nowhere for you to go. The Zayeen Authority is particular about those who stray from the roads, or who roam without purpose or permission.” His next words were accompanied by a carnivorous glare from hateful eyes. “You must remember, Nefari.”\n\nThe words sliced. Diaden did remember; all Nefari remembered their expulsion from their home, which was once everywhere, now nowhere.\n\n“You’ve no food and no water except what I provide you,” the tyrant continued. “You would not last one evening alone, and you would not make it to Solem.” Tolvar spoke in his calm manner, delivering facts Diaden could not dispute. “So, no, I was not, and am not, afraid you would abscond. Now go get water and be silent. Ensure you are rested and ready for the remainder of the journey home.” For a moment, Diaden was relieved, but the tyrant was not finished. “If I hear from you again, I will string up your corpse near the gates of Yerushem for the vultures.”\n\nDiaden did not doubt the tyrant for a second, so he did not linger in the tyrant’s presence. He hurried to join Joben at the back of the chariot, where the new arrival clothed in white stood assessing the chariot.\n\nHe was a Magus, thought Diaden, who knew it as surely as the taste of the freedom he lost so long ago. The Nefari often dealt with the Magi—trade, mostly—and offered beds in which to sleep when nights grew long. In turn, the Magi conjured tricks for children and entertained the tribespeople with stories written in the gaps between every flicker of flame from the evening fires. Diaden could still imagine the light-dances in the night sky.\n\n“*Who are they, elder?* He had been just a boy—maybe Joben’s age. Perhaps he forgave Joben’s incessant questioning because he had been the same. *“Wanderers, Diaden, who look after themselves above all, who carry wisdom and lore and pass it from one generation to the next.”* He recalled being fearful, at first. *“Should we not fear them? What do we know about them?”* The elder had been kind, in her way, but firm. *“We may not know much, child, and they may be secretive, but it is for no great mischief. We share the desert with them, and from time to time a story, or a bed. There is nothing to fear.”* He had not been convinced. *“But what of the rumours, elder?”* She had said nothing, and he had pressed. “*Magic is evil*,” he had said. The elder had only reverted to Nefari tenets. “*If you do not know a thing, you cannot judge a thing*.”\n\nDiaden avoided Joben’s awestruck glances as the Magus worked feet away, instead focusing on his search of the stores. The search ended quickly as Diaden’s fingers closed around a pouch of water. He grabbed it, pulled it out, then squeezed it until it released cool fluid, filling his mouth, careful not to drip any to the earth, or to drink too much. He did, though, drink enough to be refreshed before passing the pouch to Joben. The boy seized it and drank heavily. He let out a gasp and raked an arm across his mouth, smearing dirt and dried blood as he did. Then he smiled, a rare sight.\n\nThe Magus paused from his observations of the stuck chariot wheels to watch their revelry. Diaden could not tell his thoughts, so stone-like was his face. There was no movement in his square jaw, nor flicker in grey eyes under heavy brows. Only the bristles of his short, brown hair moved with the wind, but even then just barely. His arms were crossed, and perhaps they were thicker than the tyrant’s. If he never spoke a word, Diaden believed he could come to understand this man, this Magus.\n\nWhen Joben finished with the water, he handed the pouch back to Diaden, who placed it back in the stores as gently as he would cradle a baby. The Magus continued to watch them. Did the Magi support this oppression, Diaden wondered? He realized for this question he had no answer, despite all his dealings with the Magi in his life long ago. What must he have thought looking upon this display of the Zayeen Authority, this tyranny, where the lives of too many were subjected to the whims of the few who believed themselves superior for reason of birth alone.\n\n“You are Nefari,” said the Magus, finally. It was a statement, not a question. His voice was deep, like the ring of a mourner’s bell.\n\n“Yes,” said Diaden, but nothing else. Silence lingered in the air between them, the only sound the rustling of grass. The gulls from the coast did not fly inward that far, nor did any other birds take flight along the road connecting the great cities of Zayeen. The patricians and the tyrant were busy filling their guts with Fasha berries.\n\nAfter a time, the Magus simply nodded and returned to the task of freeing the chariot. Joben looked at Diaden as if to ask a question, but he shrugged before the boy could. Diaden did not know the meaning behind the Magus’s statement, if he meant anything. It was not hard to tell he was Nefari. Even more than their physical appearance, their traits were infamous, and none more so than the tendency to defy—to question—to rebel. Nefari did not accept what was freely offered. All must be earned.\n\nWith the Magus indisposed and the tyrant feasting, Joben and Diaden had nothing to do but wait and watch. Fortunately, they neither waited nor watched for too long. The Magus grasped a wheel, then stretched out to grasp the other. He whispered to himself—murmurs Diaden could not understand—and closed his eyes. And then the chariot moved. It rose, straight up, as if guided, not lifted, by the Magus. The wheels freed themselves from the mud with a pop of suction, and then the Magus released the hint of a grunt as the chariot shifted to the side and set down on the road, liberated from its earthly prison.\n\nJoben emitted a sound of amazement. His one good eye was wide open, and his jaw hung. It was a little feat of magic from the Magus. Diaden knew this; he’d seen it. But it was still impressive, as all unnatural things might be. *Respect what you do not understand*. So it was said by Nefari.\n\nHerus and Daphnus, the patricians—husband and wife no doubt—clapped and rejoiced. Their lips and fingers were stained with the juices from berries, and they had in their glee accidentally rubbed their hands dry on garments more expensive than Diaden could afford in many lifetimes. He fixated on the streaks of red and blue lighting up their robes as they hopped into the chariot, followed by the tyrant.\n\n“Here,” said Tolvar, and he flipped a coin to the Magus. “For your troubles.” The Magus caught the coin but said nothing, and his face remained hard and without expression. “Come now,” said the tyrant, beckoning to Diaden and Joben. His command was loud. He was in a good mood, and he did not lash his reed.\n\nThey had no choice but to obey. Diaden stepped onto the plank affixed to the left side of the chariot and grasped on to a handle on the chariot’s side. As he did, the Magus swiftly reached out and dropped the coin in his pocket. His movement was so fast Diaden had barely the time to register its occurrence, but he knew it to have happened. He doubted anyone else would have seen. The Magus also whispered to him in a voice no one could possibly hear, but somehow it was louder than any direction Tolvar had ever given. By that time Diaden had glanced at the Magus, dumbfounded by the display. The Magus’s lips did not move as he spoke.\n\n“I will find you in Yerushem,” he said.\n\nThen he turned toward his horse, also white, which frolicked in the fields not far away, and walked to join with the beast. At the same time, the tyrant jostled the reins and spurred the chariot’s horses, and they began to trot down the road, pulling behind them the chariot, resuming the journey to Yerushem, the capital city of Zayeen. The Magus faded into the distance as he began to ride west and away from their path.\n\nThe day was hotter than before, and Diaden was unprotected from the sun, and soon he was laced with sweat and caked with dirt. It was uncomfortable, to be sure, but so were all the days of his life. In that space, though, in that time, his mind was somewhere far away.\n\n[crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633475676, "digest": "eV3R-W8IXsfFGiTDxECgmbiMwd_x2VYYbF47NG-6RpM", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "TwJ6sEyKtNGyeZ_gS7N_gW_3flUTS842boYQZFqvFFY", "title": "Chapter One: A Man Called Dove", "body": "The solver watched a tall woman hurry down the street. She had blonde hair, and she wore a black coat that billowed around a white dress. Her heels were polished black—the kind the girls wore in the darker places of Junction. Blues and pinks reflected off them and it looked like she was dancing in the rain that hadn’t stopped pouring for a week.\n\nHe sniffed. Sulphur floated in the air and masked the stink of a world gone mad, filled with people who had forgotten themselves, lost in the luxury of light and plenty. There were no more stop signs, no more forks in the road. Desire had become linear, and the path to absolution was paved neon.\n\n“She’s different.” Mai’s voice infiltrated the solver’s thoughts.\n\n“Track her,” said the solver, tapping again at the cylindrical lenses sticking forward from his head. His goggles were special to him. He’d earned them on the Arch, long ago, as a reward for being who he was—who he’d become. Solvers were honed and dangerous. They were weapons made by new men from the ashes of the old world, and he was among the oldest and most dangerous. But also the most tortured. The program had left no visible scars, but they were there, and they were as earned as his vision.\n\nWhere was the woman going? He raised a green-gloved hand to his face and adjusted a lens, spiralling it between nimble fingers, grooves of the lens rippling the soft plastic of his glove.\n\nThe image of the mid-town market shifted; the opaque became clear and the hidden became seen. The woman kept flicking her feet, faster now, purposeful.\n\n“She’s headed to Chunda House,” said Mai inside his head. His Core had found a pattern and crunched the numbers. The solver checked the girl’s direction and made some estimations of his own, then grunted. Chunda House, he wondered. Going to see the Cybs, probably.\n\nThe Cybs were a blight. They were a collection of drugged-up augments who lived only for the next hit—a metaphor for what life had become. During the Reckoning, in that split-second of confusion when Providence had impossibly gone offline—when the city became bathed in darkness and its guardians had gone blind—the Cybs had seized their chance to infect far and wide. They took territory and spread their “religion.” No doubt the girls in the black heels were already paying their dues to their new digital pimps. The tall woman was likely no different. But...\n\n“It feels wrong,” he said.\n\nMai buzzed in his mind. “Maybe it’s just your nanos messing with your head again, Dove.”\n\n“It’s not my fucking nanos.”\n\n“Easy, tiger.”\n\nDove didn’t respond. His Core was right, of course. She was always right. Every day, Dove burned. Every damned day. His creation had been a sin. In all of the Illumination’s glory, while revelling in their brilliance, they hadn’t considered an expiry date, or a shelf-life. Solvers like Dove—old, weary—needed refurbishment often. Too long in the field without care or attention, and they’d suffer silently. Sometimes loudly.\n\nThe Illumination’s agent of light who had delivered Dove’s current instructions had been certain: find Maxine. But Dove doubted a Junction hooker would be the key to finding the Passport and bringing order back to the City, still teetering on the brink of collapse in the wake of the Reckoning. It wouldn’t bring Providence back online. What did the Illumination want with Maxine, he wondered?\n\n“The girl is working with the Cybs, Dove—still think this is a waste of time?” Mai asked.\n\n“Maybe,” he said.\n\nBut he knew better than to second guess his source. Everything led somewhere; everyone wanted something. It’d been two weeks since the Reckoning, and the City had grown darker and more dangerous. Someone had wanted it that way, and Dove would find out why and who. Not for the Illumination, who had commanded his obedience, but for himself. Do this, he had thought, and perhaps he’d earn his freedom.\n\nThe uneasy pact he’d made with the Illumination had led him here, to this back alley in the dregs of the City, watching a girl with black heels scurry into a cartel hole. He followed.\n\nGetting inside wasn’t difficult, despite the gatekeeper. Cybs were small minded, their pride was misplaced, and they were sure in their superiority. Sure, they’d heard of the hack Dove now sent scurrying through the gatekeeper’s neural net, but they did not believe. Military men taking over their implants? Absurd. He flicked his eyes and a series of menus opened. He saw the conjured strings of code within, and he accessed the nanos floating about the bouncer’s brainstem. It took seconds, maybe less. The idiots were still using tech developed in the dawn of the Singularity. It was archaic—slow and clunky. Easy for a solver.\n\nThe doors to Chunda House opened to him and its taint declared itself like a crashing train. Music used to mean something. Now the streets were filled with disconnected tones and beats, waves laced with synth and vibe in sync with the always flickering halogen of the night. It was worse inside—in your face, inescapable, forcing you to recognize its power. The dancers matched the music: thugs with metal limbs and teeth, inhuman faces carved from steel, draped in the finest silk, lugging behind them girls with black heels and other creatures of the night. Everyone drank, liquids thick and thin, blue and red and yellow, each capable of making one forget, or become someone else. Even for a night.\n\n*Not sure why the Cybs bother*, he thought. Their nanos scrubbed it all up before it could take hold of their blood.\n\nThere. The tall woman sat in the corner alone, a bottle of something blue before her on a table shaped  like a flower, each pedal sharp and cold. The solver adjusted his vision, scoped Maxine’s face, and saw the red puffiness of her eyes and cheeks glistening sodium and hate. He pulled at his green glove, snapped it against his wrist, then clenched his teeth. A tick; a tell. A habit he couldn’t stop no matter how stupid it made him, or how weak. A vestige of a former life, all but forgotten. But still with him.\n\nMaxine. The Illumination kept detailed files on targets of interest—so deep that a childhood seemed just another word on a page, chapters of lives running on forever. Her full name was Maxine de L’avant, and she was a True Worlder. Not an original, of course, but descended from pre-singularity lines. Her family name made her wealthy, so why had she decided to waste away in Junction, turning tricks for the Disconnected, and now in the service of Cybs? The question had bothered him since he’d left the Arch.\n\nDrunks and gangsters swept aside before him, desperate to avoid his attention and the shuffle of his black cloak as he pointed his way across the bar to where Maxine sat. Some knew him, sure, and some didn’t; but even those blissfully ignorant sensed him. The night-girl saw him come but did not recoil, wide eyes fixed on his face. He imagined the horror she saw: a square jaw, stubble, and lids for eyes failing to hide the rage within. Maxine dangled a glass from thin fingers, tipped white. She held a pinky to her lips, also white, like her dress. Black and white, Maxine. If it were only so simple.\n\nHe slipped into her booth, rested his arms on the table and clasped his hands. No fear, just curiosity. She didn’t seem to know who he was, or what he was. In the strobing light of the bar, her face pulsed rapidly and his vision corrected to create a full image. She was young, but not too young. A crack at her lips, in her foundation, and a crease in her temple. The way the joints of her knuckles protruded a bit too much, or how she sat back, relaxed, poised. The environment coalesced around her until she was the pinpoint, she was the energy, a beacon in a white dress. What was she doing in a place like this?\n\n“I’ve been looking for you, Maxine.”\n\nShe sipped, and a trickle of blue seeped from the corners of her lips. She caught it with her pinky, licked it off, stared at him with eyeballs round and shining.\n\n“You found me, mystery man.”\n\n“The Cybs?” asked Dove.\n\n“They keep me safe,” she said.\n\n“Is it worth the price?”\n\nShe turned away, brushed her hair with a hand, and rested her elbow on the hard steel top of the booth. He saw it just then—a hesitation. Brief, but real. She was scarred, too. The kind of scars that went unseen except to those who looked.\n\n“Maybe it is. Doesn’t matter. You want a drink?”\n\n“No.” He snapped his glove.\n\n“Fine by me,” she said. Refill. The bottle was almost gone, now. That would have been too much for her alone; someone had come and gone and left her in tears—despondent. Or maybe this was her, all of her, in the flesh. Maxine de L'avant, black heels and all.\n\n“Do you have it?” he asked.\n\nShe paused mid-sip, let the cocktail roll on her tongue and gulped it down. It was enough—confirmation. The agent’s direction to Maxine had been sound, and his information was reliable. The solver’s answers started here.\n\n“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about, stranger. What did you say your name was?”\n\n“I didn’t.”\n\nHer eyes were focused now, no longer hazy, and she sat straighter. A delicate hand wiped away the last of her dried tears. She sniffed.\n\n“No, I guess you didn’t. Doesn’t take an Elite to figure it out though, where you come from, I mean. That cloak, those eyes, if you can call them that. You’re a solver, aren’t you?”\n\nSo, he thought. She did know what he was.\n\n“Shit,” she continued. “Never thought I’d meet one. Didn’t think they—you—were a real thing, you know? One of those legends that runs through the circuits, a myth of our cybernetic reality, an echo of light and electricity. Who can tell any more what’s real and what’s not. Do you remember? Before, I mean? Life pre-singularity. You should have seen it, solver, it was so beautiful. Green, everywhere—green like your gloves. Fresh air. Quiet. I remember.”\n\n“You’d have been a child, at best,” he said.\n\n“I said I remember, ok?” Curt. Tense. Painful. Odd for a True Worlder, but perhaps not for a girl lost in Junction. He was intrigued, but her story didn’t matter. His story mattered.\n\n“Tell me where it is, Maxine.”\n\nShe grew restless, crossed her legs back and forth, then her arms, then finished the bottle of something blue. Synthwaves continued to ripple around them, the beat grew faster, and she nodded her head in sync, gaze fixed on his face. She bit her lip.\n\n“I don’t have it. Not any more,” she said.\n\n“Where?”\n\nShe bit harder, pushed against the seat, and strained against herself until she almost gave in. Almost.\n\n“Protect me, promise me you’ll protect me.” She was pleading. Her voice trembled.\n\nDove did not flinch, but he pursed his lips. He had made promises once. They broke, and people died. He was blamed. By himself, and others. The struggle had been beaten out of him on the Arch. The Illumination had been unwilling to endure such a fault.\n\n“I don’t make promises,” he said.\n\nShe cried—silently, slowly. Streaks ran down her cheek, tracing the same lines in her makeup like rainwater in a gutter. Trapped, but she knew what she must do.\n\n“It’s with Arcturus.”\n\n“Arcturus? The moonlight man?” he asked.\n\n“You heard me.”\n\n“What were you doing in Osiron?”\n\n“Too many questions.” She sniffed her last and regained her composure. He couldn’t touch her now—not any more. “Now, I think I’ll refill my bottle, and then I’m going to go dance with my shiny friends. You can join us, you know.”\n\nThe hint of her smile was seductive—back at work. He felt so sad for her. She was grace-fallen, a True Worlder no more. He gave no reply, for none was needed. He picked himself up from the booth and raised a hand to his vision, captured a last memory of the Lady de L'avant, then made his way out, taking care not to drown in the filth of Chunda House.\n\n[crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633475649, "digest": "4r4OoEtKQA2ei0nDyJ9ujMksm8TKTRYNdkMMGIberMQ", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}

{"id": "x3dkLZiYRAt5UaxQPDBrJv7kNhmHOIyjxft-MFIPl3w", "title": "Chapter One: The Showdown", "body": "\"Not far now,” I yelled over my shoulder. Pa lay drunk in the wagon rolling behind the horses I guided, laid out from two pints of gut warmer drained before noon. Left me to finish a drive alone again. One cowboy, two hundred heads, and there’d be hell to pay if any disappeared. Pa’s been for certain about pulling in more pieces.\n\nI pulled my shadowmaker lower on my face, squinted into the sun-drenched horizon past hoodoos sprouting from the badlands, and chewed at a piece of straw. It didn’t taste like anything, but kept my mouth wet with saliva and tricked my mind. Can’t remember where I picked up the habit. My skin had long ago darkened and tightened from the everyday sun, and long, wavy black hair had turned brown and flattened.\n\nNot many drove the Old Road. No fresh grass or fresh water this way, and dry heat sucked moisture from bone. Wasn’t any shorter either, still a week’s ride to Junction, the first border town to the east. Not even marshals roamed this far from Homestead. Something else brought cowboys over the desert. Freedom. Liberty from the Syndicate and the gallows, no hangin’ for using what burned within.\n\nA kick of my heels spurred Marrow to a slow trot along the cracked, dusty trail slowly funnelling between two cliffs. I passed a section of scorched rock, eyes following a wave of black growing higher and wider. Stretching from my saddle, I reached out and dragged fingertips against the surface. Sparks flickered and faded, the still air broken by sizzles and hisses. I gazed at the blue fire glowing through but not burning my saddle gloves, an ever-present itch just beneath my skin begging to be set free. The Blaze. Wicked, but powerful, even then urging me to wield the flame. But I didn’t.\n\nDaylight slipped away, and I managed to drive the herd to Junction without issue, no need to draw upon the Blaze. The cattle marched quiet over a crest of rock and down until the ground turned to yellow, brittle weeds and prickle shrubs barely moving a breeze blown in by the dusk.\n\n“Evenin’, ma’am.” A farmer walked besides, hauling a bundle of harvested corn.\n\n“Evenin’.” Kept chewing my straw, staring straight ahead. Too many faces in my life, coming and going through the Outskirts. Didn’t need another.\n\n“Quite the shadowmaker you got there. Never seen one like it.”\n\n“That right?”\n\n“Would pay a good share of pieces for it.”\n\nI pulled on Marrow’s reins and stopped, turned my head and glared down at the farmer. My shadowmaker used to be Ma’s, quick as she was. One day she’d not been quick enough. With her last breath she had told me to wear it well, make her proud. Wore it every day since, though I wasn’t no fighter and likely never would be—not if I spent my days driving cattle. Pa had tried to take the shadowmaker from me once, probably for sellin’—the famous shadowmaker of Giddy O’hare—but I had fought back something fierce. That day I discovered the Blaze. Pa never tried again.\n\n“It ain’t for sale.” I put ice and poison into my words, easy for a cowboy. The farmer took the hint and hurried away, circled wide around the herd now marching well ahead of me. Several other labourers scurried back to town, sometimes shifting heads and casting glances my way. Not many came by the Old Road, and those who did, like her, brought trouble.\n\nPa roused by the time the horses and wagon rolled up to the town’s gates, shaking his head and spitting the leftovers. No praise, no gratitude for lining his pockets, but I didn't expect any. Ten years since my first drive, and never a word of encouragement or smile. Just work. Pa didn't even pony for any new gear, and I spent most of my pieces getting equipped. Most. My fingers traced the single piece sitting my pocket. The beginning of my way out.\n\nI nodded the brim of my shadowmaker at locals slack-jawin' at our entrance, just two cowboys and a two hundred heads. Gates opened, allowing me and Pa to steer the cattle inside, set to eating grass and standing around. We sauntered into the town like black thumbs, gawked and pointed at by old folk and youngins’ walkin the streets. Not too many cowboys came this way, only once in a while. More pieces for less work in the Core. Junction and its folk settled on the inner perimeter of the Outskirts, or the outer edges of the Core, depending on how you looked at it. Close enough to attract trade, get fed, but too far to earn respect, be protected. The Syndicate didn't care about towns like these. If bandits came, they came, and people moved on. Life on the brink, some called it.\n\nAlways looked forward to drives to border towns. The people shined brighter, played harder. Maybe that's why Pa took more contracts in these parts, never hard to find a game of vapour, far enough away from roaming marshals to gamble without fear of the gallows.\n\n\"Where's the saloon?\" Pa shouted at a milkmaid cleaning her bottles under the water tower, spittle dripping down his chin and almost keeling over. The milkmaid soured and pointed to a three-story building nested between a smith and post office. Pa grunted, shook his reins and headed that way. I followed, but cast a sympathetic look to the woman, used to cleaning up after Pa's indiscretions.\n\n\"Stay here, Ellie,\" said Pa, dismounting and stumbling his way inside. I sighed, readied for a long night of waiting for Pa to lose his pieces and pass out with a belly full of whiskey.\n\nEven at the evening hour, people worked. Not just piano players and dancers in the saloon, flickering light and laughter escaping the swinging doors. Outside, the smith hammered iron, forged by intermittent streaks of blue fire from his fingertips illuminating the registration papers hanging from his stall, clangs ripping the air and echoing into the night. Several folk tended horses tied up to posts, lumped straw beneath their stouts and filled buckets, and lit candles near their droppings, the mix of smells confusing my nose.\n\nBut the jewel of the evening lay with the Showdown. The Syndicate may not operate on the brink, but the Showdown circuits came this far and further, even to the edges of the Outskirts. Nothing fancy this far out, nothing wild like in the stories from Homestead, and no heroes or legends. Just plain old draw and shoot. Men and women, boys and girls, cowboys and charlatans, farmers and other folk, all roped into the border circuits by some misfortune or another.\n\nWhen I saw the ring, the gathering of voyeurs around an erected platform, I rushed to the barricade around its edges and found an open space, stepped up on the wood and braced arms over, eager to glimpse the next draw.\n\nInto the opening walked a man, wide steps and jingling boots, white ten-gallon on his head and a bristly moustache below his nose. Forty? Fifty? The wrinkles in his skin stood out despite the dusk. The fighter didn't bother to engage the crowd, focused only on the woman twenty paces away. She wore a striped barmaid's dress, red top, black bottom, frilled and puffy, and blond hair pulled up in a bun. An entertainer, she took time to walk around the barricade and drag a fingertip over the lips of howling locals, then pulled it away, revealing a tiny gleam of blue fire.\n\n\"Folks, tonight the Showdown offers you a fight for the ages.\" The announcer standing in the middle of the platform grabbed the crowd's attention, his words inflected and urgent. \"First, a veteran of the circuits, born and raised a fighter, Blaze like you've never seen, I give you Jacob,\" the announcer elongated his next words, \"Two-Twin Jacobs.\"\n\nI pumped a fist as the rest of the onlookers cheered. Two-Twin was a veteran all right. In every town, I zealously sought information on the Showdown, heard tell of duels near and far, and so I recognized his name. Never seen him fight before, though. Never even seen a bounty poster, no wanted signs for a career fighter in the border towns.\n\nMy excitement faded quickly at the sounds of drunken gamblers pouring from the saloon. Pa used to love the Showdown, travel all around and watch Ma fell men twice her size. He had inspired my passion years ago, long before he lost himself to whiskey. Now Pa barely bothered, bristled at a mention.\n\n\"And his challenger, a local, you knew her well, stealer of hearts and pieces, life of barmaid in the saloon, now making her mark with her Blaze, it's Miss Poppy!\" The crowd roared louder, euphoric with their Junction fighter. \"You won't see this again for a hundred turns, I guarantee it. Bet those pieces, place your wagers, pony up if you're so sure. Who will it be, old and steady or young and unpredictable? The clock strikes soon.\"\n\nThe gamblers yelled in unison. Five pieces on the old man! Ten on the wench! Bet he downs her with one shot! Not a chance, sun sets for the old man! Pieces traded hands, flicked in the air, exchanged for slips of paper. Coins rattled in saddlebags and pouches. The commotion almost drowned out shouts drifting from the saloon, where no doubt Pa's game of vapour grew serious.\n\nI frowned, just one piece in my pockets, residue from the last drive. I needed the piece, the first step towards something else, more than driving cattle between holes in the ground. Heard tell of a Showdown gang up near Tallhill, could buy in for training and all that. But the evening air blew different, shooed my caution. Would be a long time until Pa and I made it out west again, or anywhere near Tallhill. And stakes put the barmaid ten to one, offered a jump start toward my something else when I finally got there. New blood and an old man who didn’t look his legend. Seemed clear to me.\n\n“I’ll put a piece on Poppy!” I flipped the metal in the air to the passing bookmaker, who caught it and handed me a slip confirming my bet. I clutched it to my chest and looked up and across the square to the town clock.\n\nLess than one minute to the hour. Two-Twin and Miss Poppy stared at each other, oblivious to their surroundings, hands by their sides, index fingers extended from balled fists and thumbs stretched out. No regulators on their fingertips, no rules out here. The quicker draw took the day, the slower dead to rights and left to mercy. Sometimes they got it, and sometimes they didn’t. Life on the brink.\n\nA crow hovered above, its caw clear and crisp. The frills of Miss Poppy's dress billowed in a faint breeze, and Two-Twins lip twitched, his moustache moving in unison. Silence fell about the crowd until only the ticking clock cut the evening. I heard my breath, squeezed a gatepost and leaned forward, afraid to blink.\n\nChime. The fighters reacted at once, too fast to perceive. Two-Twin snapped his hand from his side and pointed his extended index finger at Miss Poppy, the hint of a flame at his fingertip. He pushed his thumb down, a trigger, and his Blaze combusted with a sharp, loud crack. Blue fire shot toward Ms. Poppy in narrow, parallel beams, straight as a blade. But the barmaid pivoted in a circle at the chime, feet shuffling, frills raised and twirling, until she came back around and faced Jacobs. The twin beams singed her puffy blouse but missed their mark. As she finished her rotation, in one fluid movement, she clapped her hands together, index fingers side by side, cracking the air louder as her Blaze ignited, unleashing a rippling stream of blue fire, more flat than tall. It caught Two-Twin in the chest and knocked him ten feet back and to the ground, crumpled against the side of the barricade.\n\nThe gamblers roared, deafening the cries and whoops from the saloon, and pieces started changing hands again, diving deep into saddle bags, matched by curses and laughter. A man ran over to wear Two-Twin lay, dead as a doornail, a giant hole burned in his coat and a swollen bruise on his lifeless chest. The man stretched out a rope, took measurements for the coffin. Miss Poppy curtsied to the body before rounding the observers to collect her winnings. I tipped my shadowmaker at the defeated fighter, extinguished faster than greased lightning. Ma always said to respect the dead, especially Showdown fighters. Honour ain’t dead if even one person remembers, she said.\n\nWhen the barmaid circled to where she stood, I held out her chit, beaming. “I picked you!”\n\nMs. Poppy returned the smile. “Smart girl.” She looked at the paper, frowned. “Just one piece?”\n\n“Sorry, it’s all I have.” I jerked her thumb behind her to the saloon. “Pa’s in there spending the rest on whiskey and vapour.”\n\nThe fighter smiled, big and bright. “Gotcha. Bobbeh,” she waved to the bookmaker,” pay this doll her money.” Bookmaker Bobbeh waddled over until he stood next to the barmaid, head coming level with her shoulders. He inspected my paper and flipped seven pieces over the gate.\n\nHell, I had forgotten the rake. No matter, seven was still better than one. Ms. Poppy turned away, but before she moved on I blurted her mind. “Where did you learn to do that?”\n\n“Do what, honey?” The barmaid looked over the side of her shoulder, eagerness on her face to keep collecting.\n\n“Control your Blaze, make it ripple.” I held out my hands, tiny sparks at the tips of my fingers. “Mine just explodes out, you know? No focus.”\n\n“Takes time,” said Ms. Poppy. “But a cowboy like you probably doesn’t get much opportunity to practice, drive to drive, marshals at your back.”\n\n“You ain’t wrong.”\n\nMs. Poppy laughed, curled her finger and beckoned me closer. I leaned in and the barmaid whispered, “Only place you’re going to learn is in the Showdown, honey, where the money’s good. Not worth the risk otherwise; not even in the Outskirts. Tell you a secret, though. It’s not how pretty you make the Blaze; it’s how fast you are, how precise. Worry about that first before you look to entertain.” Ms. Poppy left with a wink, off to gather the rest of her prize.\n\nI jumped down, boots sinking into mud which I scraped off as I made my way back to the saloon. Raised voices continued to seep into the deepening night, the game far from over, Pa still afloat, somehow. I rattled the seven pieces in my pocket, a fortune. Briefly, my mind flashed a new saddle. But no. Instead, I strolled through town looking for a market open at the late hour, which I found. Two pieces bought freshly ground coffee, a few husks of corn, and jerky. A hearty breakfast for a new day, and something to take the sting out of Pa’s hangover.\n\nSatisfied, I sat on the porch, crossed my arms on my knees and rested my head, settling in for a later night than expected.\n\n[crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633475717, "digest": "a7z6sBzLvf-d9rxJ8vz8rmawwZYoF6q7NX451ZwZDF0", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "otx4_BZi4ErH7F7gOe4KcUr8ssYIPMtRq3-g9sfx48o", "title": "Chapter One: Valour and Virtue", "body": "Fires burned from torches held high by the soldiers who’d survived the night. They stood at attention, sadness in their eyes, faces blackened and bloodied, bodies broken and scarred. But they lived. Those who lay atop the pyres did not.\n\nMorning came with a chill, the kind blown in over water, but the forces of Duneld did not waiver; they guarded their fallen, and would until the flames took them, as was the way.\n\n“Shouldn’t you be down there with your brother?”\n\nMairi pulled up her cloak to turn away the brittle wind and faced her mother, whose voice had been filled with judgment. Her mother did not keep secret her disdain for her daughter’s path.\n\n“It is not my place, Mother.”\n\n“You fought among them, did you not?”\n\nViolence took Mairi’s vision. Black blood had spilled across her edge as she had sliced it through the dark things that had come for them. It had washed over her, a torrent of death for which she’d prepared, but never enough. She tasted it still, like a festering poison.\n\n“Willyem is their Grey.”\n\n“Aye,” said Flora Duneld, matriarch of the clan. “He is there Grey, but you are his sister, and you have chosen the path of valour” She stepped out from the shadows and joined her daughter at the crest of the battlements overlooking the tattered Skyreach Fields—once rolling mounds of luscious green, now a charred and stained memory.\n\nMairi bristled but kept composure, letting out a slow breath. She watched it curl upward in the frosted air, and then fade away amidst the fog. “Still, Mother?”\n\nFiora gripped the chiselled-stone railing, and her knuckles whitened beyond her already-pale complexion. Fury burned behind brown eyes, concealed only slightly by her picture of beauty, marked by a perfectly oval face around which fell long, raven-black hair.\n\n“Still, my daughter. Your path was to be virtue.”\n\n“But I am not virtuous,” said Mairi.\n\n“That never mattered.” Her mother spoke as cold as the morning. “Valour and virtue is the way. It has always been the way. What will the clan do now, daughter?”\n\nMairi watched the solemn vigil taking place at the base of their hold. She admired the strength in the silence of the valiant few who remained to fly their colours. Willyem had emerged from the gates, and all eyes followed his slow march between the rows of pyres. He would visit them all—hundreds of them—to say a quiet word known only to him and the dead.\n\nShe reached up and played with the iron clasp holding tight her ceremonial cloak, patterned white and black, inscribed with the old words: “Valour and virtue.”\n\n“Mother,” said Mairi, “you shepherd this family; you lead this clan. No one could do justice to our interests better.”\n\n“I won’t be here forever, Mairi. What then?”\n\nBelow, Willyem continued delivering the last rights to the fallen, his white and black cloak billowing around him as he walked. Her brother had always been statuesque, like a hero from history born anew. But not even he could face the wars to come without help.\n\n“First there must be a forever,” said Mairi. “Father knew what was coming, and he trained me to fight, not to—“\n\n“Your father is dead!” Fiora seethed, still beautiful. “The path of valour is romantic, I know. The annals are full with legends of those who risked everything for glory, or honour, or whatever captured their fancy at the time. Many found success; many did not. But they are all dead, my love. It is we, the virtuous, who live on and carry forth family name.”\n\n“He needs my help,” said Mairi. “And when we unite the clans and save the island from dark hours, we will do so in the name of Duneld, and history will know.”\n\nFIora released her grip on the railing and stepped back into the shadows. “I hope you are right, Mairi. I hope you and Willyem accomplish all that you set out to do. But if you fail, my daughter, what will history have to say about us then? Perhaps nothing at all.”\n\nAfter her mother had left, Mairi remained alone in quiet observation of the vigil. Though tormented by her decision to pursue valour, and her mother’s words, she found herself resolute. Teeth gritted, she braced against the cold but did not move, and she stilled herself as best she could. Though she had no torch, she would guard the dead until the flames took them, as was the way.\n\nThe morning passed slow, and her brother’s march took time, but she did not move. She did not take her eyes away from her Grey, the boy with whom she’d grown right here in the Hold—the man who carried her father’s edge and who inspired love in all those who followed him. She would follow, too, for she was a valiant of Clan Duneld. That was her path.\n\nWillyem walked back to the base of the Hold where the soldiers stood, their torches still raised high, still flickering in the frost. He drew his edge, then he planted in in the rocky mud.\n\nHe spoke aloud, to no one in particular, and his voice carried far. “The night has ended. Then sun has risen. Breath fills our lunges. Blood runs in our veins.” He paused, then looked up and behind him, to where Mairi stood, still as stone. Their blue eyes met, but they shared no smile.\n\nHe pulled away his gaze and continued his sermon. “We live, aye, but our brothers and sisters fell, never to wake. They fought hard. They fought true. They lived and die for the clan. Our clan. Remember them, so their names might live forever.” Willyem readied his torch. “May they pass in peace. May our ancestors receive them. Valour, and virtue.”\n\nThe silent monoliths who stood at attention behind their Grey in unison thumped a fist against their chest and called out in one great voice: “Valour, and virtue!”\n\nThe sound echoed in the morning, and then all was serene once again. Willyem lowered his torch to the ground and lit the first pyre. His signal accepted, others moved forward and lit pyres, until they all began to burn, a great fire stretching into the horizon. The flames filled Mairi’s brown eyes, and she whispered to herself: “Valour, and virtue.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“I thought I’d find you here.”\n\nMairi approached her brother, who at the edge of Wave’s End, the lake stretching from the northern sea to the edge of Cloudhold, clan Duneld’s family home. Wind was ever-present in their part of the Great Isle, and now it was gently pushing the water to the shore so that it lapped over the rocky beach. She loved the sound. This type of day had always been her favourite, back when she was innocent, and had not seen the things she had, nor done the things she had.\n\n“Father was right.” Without looking at his sister, Willyem spoke in the same distracted manner as at the vigil, as if he saw something over the water she could not. Perhaps he did. Perhaps that’s why the valiant chose him as their Grey, discarding the older, wiser, more hardened men who’d sought the head of the Duneld forces.\n\n“About what, Willyem?” She stood at his side now, her head stopping at his broad shoulders. She looked out over the water to look for what he saw, but found nothing but more water.\n\n“The eternal war,” he said. “That we are the shield.”\n\nMairi sighed, and her brother noticed.\n\n“Even after last night, and you don’t believe,” he said. It had not been a question.\n\n“I know what I saw, Brother.”\n\n“What did you see?” he asked. “I’ve been trying to describe it to myself, but I cannot find the words.”\n\nMairi again tasted black blood that had filled her mouth as she had bathed in chaos of dying men and women and… things. In the dawn, after she had crawled out from the muck, life clinging to her ragged self, she had drenched herself with steamed and perfumed water, and she had scrubbed herself raw, until her skin was red and her soul bare. Still, the vile remained with her. She couldn’t imagine ever being clean again.\n\n“I saw *them*,” she said. “Just as father foretold. Just as the tomes beneath the Hold caution. Just as the carvings at Old Rock depict.”\n\n“Aye,” said Willyem. “It was them. They died all the same.” One of his hands rested atop the handle of his edge hanging from his waist. He placed the other around his sister’s shoulder. “I saw you, Mairi, fighting. You have fire in you. Father would have been proud.”\n\n“Mother isn’t.”\n\nWillyem laughed, in his way. The hint of a smile played at his lips, and his eyes twinkled, but he stayed quiet, and his face did not move. “She only wants the best for our clan. A *future*, for our clan.”\n\n“I am no lady of virtue, Brother.”\n\n“No,” he said. “But you’re a daughter of Duneld all the same. There have always been two paths, Mairi. The clan needs both to survive.”\n\n“Virtue would not have survived the night.”\n\nWillyem bowed his head, then crouched. He reached for the lapping lake-water, and allowed it to flow over his ungloved finger. “I suspect not,” he said. “But virtue will lead us through many more.”\n\n“The other clans,” said Mairi.\n\n“Aye,” said Willyem. “The other clans.”\n\n“But you said it yourself, *we* are the shield. No other clan built their castles at the edges of the water; they’re all inland, Brother.”\n\n“Now we know why.”\n\nMairi stood quiet with her brother for some time, both looking out toward the mouth of the northern sea, from where dark things had come in the night. She walked closer to the shore.\n\n“Do you remember when we were children, Willyem? When we would dance in the water for hours and hours, splashing each other, racing from edge to edge, laughing until mother called us for dinner.”\n\nHe nodded. “Aye. I remember.”\n\n“Come,” she took off her boots and waded into the lake, reaching back to him. “Let us dance one last time, before the end of the world.”\n\nWillyem stared at her, his round eyes brilliant blue, like hers—like their father’s. She saw pain within them, and the same lingering sadness he always carried.\n\n“Mairi,” he said. “Dancing and splashing and racing and laughing…these are the actions of the innocent, and the joyous, and the free.”\n\n“Are we not those things, Brother?” She found herself pleading.\n\n“None of us are. Not any more.”\n\nThe cold of the lake hit her just then. It sunk beneath her skin and travelled through her body, until her spine chilled and heart numbed.\n\n“We deserve to be,” she said.\n\nWillyem pulled his eyes from hers and looked past her, toward the emptiness of the horizon, toward the same unknown she could not see.\n\n“When the time comes,” he said, “let us hope there is more mother in you than father. Not all of the clans will unite under valour; it will take virtue, too.”\n\n“Aye, Willyem,” she said. “Let us hope.”\n\nHe turned from her, standing alone in the lake, and began to walk back to the Hold. “Tomorrow, we ride for Clan Quarry. Let us begin there.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen they left the next day, the ground shook beneath the feet of a thousand pairs of marching feet. None of the valiant men and women of Duneld who remained after the long night of terror had protested their new duty. None complained of weariness. None begged reprieve. Honour commanded their hearts as much as love of clan and country.\n\nCountry. The Great Isle. Home to many names and many stories—most marked by blood. How many years had it been, Mairi wondered, since war had broken out among the clans? It was all she knew. It was all she’d learned. Had it always been this way, or had there been a peace, long ago?\n\nShe walked beside her brother and the tip of the spear that was the valiant of Duneld, edges hanging from the belts, cloaks around their shoulders, banners at their backs. For a little while, they walked without interruption or distraction. Only the sounds of the Great Isle played in their ears, a counterpoint to the thundering march. Then it began to rain.\n\nDroplets pattered off steel and soaked leather, and the black hair of Willyem and Mairi Duneld dampened until it clung to their faces. She smelled sulphur lingering from a thunderstorm long past—or was it on its way?—and the emerald grass beneath their feet became soft and matted.\n\n“Clan Quarry is small, Brother, and Oathkeep is tucked away far to the east.”\n\n“Aye,” he said. “So they are; so it is.”\n\n“Why begin there? Their influence is light; they matter not in the grand scheme.”\n\nWillyem pulled himself up over topple rock from an age long past, then reached to his sister to help her. “Is that what mother says?”\n\n“She may have mentioned it a time or two when discussing clan politics.”\n\nHe looked at her. “Since when do you pay attention to politics?”\n\n“I haven’t always walked this path, Brother.”\n\nThunder sounded in the distance, from the direction in which they travelled. The storm would be upon them soon.\n\n“I suppose not,” he said. “Tell me, Mairi, do you know the Quarry home is called Oathkeep?”\n\n“I don’t,” she answered.\n\n“Legends say Clan Quarry was once mighty, spanning the entire coast, led by a man of great revere.”\n\n“Legends?” she asked.\n\nWillyem looked at her. “Father.” He continued. “There was to be a great battle, perhaps the greatest the Isle has ever seen, and the ancestors of Duneld needed aid. You’ve heard of Mulcom?”\n\n“Of course,” she said. “We bear his words on our crest.”\n\n“Aye,” said Willyem. “Mulcom approached the Quarry for an oath—an oath to come to their call when the battle came to Duneld.”\n\n“Why would the Quarry agree?”\n\n“Don’t know,” said Willyem. “But they did. And they kept their oath. In return, Mulcom gifted them the castle now called Oathkeep.”\n\nMairi didn’t know what to say. All of this information was new to her—something never told when she had learned the history of the Great Isle and of its clans. And perhaps she was more shocked to hear her brother speak of things other than steel and iron and blood.\n\n“If the legend is true—if *father* was right—the years have not been kind to Clan Quarry.”\n\n“No,” said Willyem.\n\n“You think they’ll stand by an oath pulled from history?”\n\n“Maybe not,” he said. “But there is open war between the clans. Nowhere is safe on the Great Isle—less so now. Only the Quarry stay tucked away, as you said; only the Quarry have no sides to choose.”\n\n“What of their own side?”\n\nWillyem thought for a moment before giving his reply. “If they choose their side, that is their choice. But we have to try.”\n\nAnother crack of thunder resonated, louder than before, and the rain began to fall harder. Mairi pulled up her hood to shelter herself. Her brother did the same.\n\n“Do you think they’ll believe us?”\n\n“About the dark?” he asked.\n\n“About them, about everything. To see is to know. We know.”\n\nHe looked over his shoulder at the marching valiant, then met her stare. “I wouldn’t. They won’t.”\n\n“No, I don’t suppose they will.”\n\n[crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633475744, "digest": "wIFNyAkxt0DevWRQDBZ_P6Qk3R5JDbh7waALTK2E7Io", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "0v7eSsBq0hCkdWGVDoJyR5fZ87aa4xzVua5gVtCgYk8", "title": "Chapter One: Charlie Storm", "body": "Charlie Storm didn’t know today would be his last among friends and family. Getting ready for school in the morning, Charlie went about the same routine as he did every day: he scoured his closet for his cleanest and freshest smelling clothes, threw them on, then ran to the kitchen, where he stuffed his mouth with a piece of peanut-butter smeared toast, all while listening to his favourite music—bagpipes—and humming along as best he could, which, he would be the first to tell you, was not very good.\n\nHe left his home in a flurry and began sprinting down the street toward the bus-stop, groaning as he glanced at the plain-black watch attached to his wrist. He’d be late again, and Mr. Snyder, his insufferable homeroom and math teacher, would surely have him in detention after class—most likely sat in the desk specially set aside for the “troublesome child.” Charlie went to detention so much he considered it just another class to get through before the school-day was done.\n\nSoot quickly charred Charlie’s pants as he ran and kicked up dust from the unpaved road. The town in which Charlie lived lay hidden in the mountains on the west coast of Canada, among the remnants of mining operations that had helped to build the great railroad spread\n\nout across the land, and the town was named accordingly: Black Rock. To clear a path for the railroad, miners had used tons upon tons of dynamite to blast the mountain to pieces. The resulting char was forever ingrained into the remaining stone.\n\nBlack Rock was no longer useful for any great projects or plans, but merely existed—and within it, the people, too, merely existed.\n\nThe lack of adventure and excitement was excruciating for Charlie, and his troublesome ways were merely a product of his attempt to spice up his life. He didn’t fit in with the normal teenagers or with their ideas of fun. He couldn’t play hockey very well and thus couldn’t join the only sports team in town, nor did he enjoy watching, and so he didn’t go cheer on the others. Charlie wouldn’t be caught with that crowd, anyway.\n\nInstead, Charlie liked experimenting with limits: How high could he climb before the air became too thin or he became too cold? How often could he skip school before someone noticed and got him in trouble for it? How many times could he spray-paint green Mr. Snyder’s prized poodle?\n\nThese were of course the simplest and least exciting of Charlie’s tests. Charlie’s affinity for pushing limits coincided nicely with his love for science, and he often spent his hours playing with chemistry sets or building things he learned about in physics books. Just last week he had taken a coil of copper and wrapped it around a piece of metal, attaching one end to a set of batteries. The resulting solenoid had proved destructive when he had broken one of his mother’s paintings with a golf ball he had fired through the house. Even now, in his pocket he felt one of the black powders he had found on one of his treks into the mountains and secreted away.\n\nCharlie’s parents discouraged his pursuits but did little to stop them altogether. But if any of the other adults in town ever caught wind of what he played around with, he was sure he’d have to find new hobbies.\n\n“Let’s go, let’s go! Sick of waiting for you, Mr. Storm. Move it!”\n\nA woman with red hair and cracked skin yelled at him as he scrambled the last few feet to the bus, the big yellow brick—the cheesewagon—herding all of the town’s highschoolers and snagged a seat at the front. It was only one of a few seats left unoccupied, as the gangs and groupies had taken up everything in the back and middle.\n\n“Late again, Chucky? Haven’t you learned to use that hideous thing strapped to your wrist?” A hawkish-looking girl yelled at him from the back of the bus. She was surrounded by a gaggle of wide-eyed followers hanging to her every word. “What is it that you’re wearing, anyway? If you’re going to keep us waiting you might as well have the decency to spare our eyesight.” Raucous laughter erupted from the sitting circle of girls, cheering at Cindy Martin’s slight. She was the queen-bee, and her sycophants were her mindless workers. She even looked the part today, adorned in a bright yellow sundress with black trim and leathery boots. A white orchid poked out from her immaculately crafted hair, which fell around her face perfectly.\n\nThe scene made Charlie want to throw up in his mouth, but that would just give her more ammunition. Instead, he just ignored her and stared out the window.\n\nThe cheesewagon made its way around town, swerving through winding streets carved into the mountainside, bumping over asphalt not paved for many years, and picking up somber-looking kids wherever it went. School was never a popular destination for those who would rather sleep and play video games, but life to a 15-year-old was hardly fair. Charlie daydreamed about what he might get up to this afternoon once the final bell had rung—likely something involving black powder—while taking in beautiful glacier-tipped skies. A lone falcon soared through the air, seeming to follow the path of the bus, and every-so-often flapped its gigantic wings to continue its forward motion.\n\nThe bus finally arrived at his school. It was not that impressive, really. The front entrance stuck out from the rest of the building, which had the look of a castle made of Lego; the squared lines and turns in the brick could have been designed by a child, and the building’s reddish colour did nothing to add to the charm. The bus driver, an ancient man with a grizzled beard and wrinkled hands, pushed the level to the bus’s front door. It made a small hiss as it folded open, beckoning to the stink of teenagers to flow out. The driver inhaled deep and slow as if to emphasize this cleansing. “Out you go, brats!”\n\nStudents immediately stood up and started yelling conversations, discussing homework, rumours, sports, and parties. They climbed over seats and pushed each other to the side, wrestling towards the exit. Testosterone was fierce in Black Rock. The dullness of life was tempered only by an inevitable passion to compete with each other.\n\nCharlie just kept sitting in his seat and staring out the window. The falcon that had flown along with the bus now sat perched atop the school’s flagpole, which rose high from the entrance to the school. A large flag bearing the mighty maple leaf flapped in a strong wind, slightly in conflict with the falcon perched so majestically and so statuesque in the sun. Charlie looked at the falcon with a new interest; he could have sworn it was looking straight back at him. For a moment, he felt unnerved and uncomfortable, but he quickly dismissed the feelings. He always felt that way. He just didn’t fit in.\n\nCharlie was last off the bus, as usual. He pulled his backpack tight and picked at peanut butter caught in his teeth. Satisfied, he moped his way to his homeroom class, careful to avoid any other school figureheads like Cindy Martin. He wasn’t afraid of confrontation or any unfortunate run-ins, but he definitely preferred to avoid them. The last time his temper flared in the face of an aggressor, his punishment had been severe—Mr. Synder had said it “fit the crime,” though Charlie hardly believed scrubbing toilets in the hockey team’s dressing room was proportional to breaking Josh Tennenbaums’ prized stick—even if Josh was the captain of the team and “number one in the hearts of all Black Rockers.”\n\nMr. Snyder was already calling attendance when Charlie entered the classroom, and made very sure to slow his words and gaze at Charlie as he took his desk. Charlie wasn’t late, and so Mr. Snyder couldn’t technically punish him, but Charlie knew a technicality wouldn’t stop the vile teacher from attempting to make Charlie’s life miserable. Mr. Snyder proved him right.\n\n“Ah, Mr. Storm. Please turn in your assignment right away. Placing it in this box shall do.” Mr. Synder pointed to a flat cardboard box sitting on the table in front of him. It looked like it had previously contained a case of soda or cheap beer. Classy.\n\n“What assignment are you talking about? There’s nothing due for homeroom, and I know you know that.” Charlie’s indignant tone was quite clear.  While he didn’t have any problems confronting Mr. Snyder, Charlie had an issue with tact—as in he had none. Mr. Snyder smirked in response,\n\n“Honestly, Mr. Storm, I don’t know how you made it this far in your academic career. You clearly cannot follow instructions. Yesterday your entire class was given a problem set on linear algebra to be turned in to me today. Your classmates have not forgotten, Storm.” Mr. Snyder snatched the box and tilted it forward, demonstrating the stack of papers already lining the stained bottom.\n\nCharlie felt a fury rise up in him,\n\n“This is homeroom, Snyder, not math class. I don’t have to turn in anything to you right now. You’ll have to try harder than that.” A hush fell over the room. While the other students had seen Charlie argue with Mr. Snyder before, he might have crossed the line this time by not addressing his teacher properly or professionally.\n\nMr. Snyder responded in barely a whisper, clipping his words short and staring at Charlie with venom in dull grey eyes.\n\n“You have no respect, Mr. Storm, for your elders or for your betters. You are but a snivelling child, crying how the world isn’t fair. I am your teacher and I want your assignment. If you do not have your assignment to give me, Mr. Storm, then I will add to the detention and punishment you have just earned by way of your insolence. Do you understand me? Actually, it doesn’t matter if you do or you don’t. You will leave this classroom—immediately. You will go to my office and to the punishment desk there within. I assume you remember where that is? Go. Now.”\n\nWith that, the overweight and balding teacher waved his hand at Charlie and turned back to his attendance sheet, resuming his mundane recital of those supposed to be present. Charlie stood in stunned silence for several moments, trying to process the events that had just transpired. He hadn’t even made it past  the first bell before being hit with the cruel discipline at Black Rock High—just another cause for him to become more isolated from anything resembling a normal adolescence.\n\nHe stood abruptly, scraping the legs of his chair against concrete floors, and stomped out of the room, knocking over a stack of loose-leaf paper with this backpack as he went. The paper fell to the ground and slipped across the classroom, swishing as it went. Mr. Snyder ignored it and kept his face steady as a stone, eyes forward and attention focused. Charlie could never win the war with him.\n\nThe hallways of the school were empty as he made his way toward the north corridor, where the teacher’s offices resided. Here, lockers didn’t crash and bang close, murmuring of cliques didn’t assault his ears, and shrill voices of hallway monitors didn’t drown out his thoughts. Instead, an eerie silence followed him and his lonely footsteps.\n\nThe light seemed to dim as he moved further and further away from his homeroom, and the halls seemed to close around him. It made him claustrophobic, so he ran to one of the large windows lining the hallway. He unlatched it and pushed it up, taking a large breath of chilly air as it forced its way through the opening. Charlie closed his eyes for a second and let the rays of the sun pour down on his face, embracing a moment of serenity he could not find in this place anywhere else. How he wished to be free of Black Rock.\n\nCharlie opened his eyes, then suddenly yelped, startled by a shadow splaying across the courtyard in front of him. The shadow was large, about ten feet from side to side, and had sharp edges and prongs poking out from weird angles.\n\nThe shadow moved, extending itself vertically in a ruffle of lines. Charlie stuck his head out the window and peered left towards the sun, trying to spot the figure responsible for the darkness, but all he could see was a bird sitting on an eave of the school.\n\nNo, not a bird—it was a falcon. The same falcon that had chased his bus and sat atop the flagpole.\n\nIt sat there unmoving and stared at him. Charlie pulled his head back inside and looked up and down the hallways. He saw no one. All was still. An eerie sensation caused his skin to prickle. The shadow seemed to grow larger on the schools’ lawn.\n\nCharlie turned away from the window and shook his head, eager to forget the experience. He resumed his march towards Snyder’s office. At the end of the corridor, something flicked past his vision and moved quickly out of sight. Charlie was scared now, turning his head left and right as he hurried his steps. The eerie silence of before magnified, and his perceptions narrowed. It was as if there were no living creature around for miles and miles, and he was left alone in a world abandoned.\n\n*Am I going crazy*, Charlie wondered? He had just been in a classroom full of disgusting teenagers, smelling awful and picking at themselves, learning to live with their changing bodies and hormones. He was no more alone than any of them. But he couldn’t explain his feeling that something was terribly wrong.\n\nTrue to his nature, though, Charlie ventured forward, testing his limits. He didn’t care that he couldn’t hear anyone. He didn’t care that everything seemed darker and smaller, or that something big had just rushed past the end of the corridor. He didn’t care that a falcon was following him. He didn’t care that Snyder would not be happy to discover he was not waiting for him in his office, ready for another serving of discipline. Though he was afraid, Charlie was excited. Something at last was happening to him that merited his attention.\n\nCharlie pulled from his backpack a flashlight, flicked it on, and crept forward, making sure to stick close to the lockers against the walls. A few times as he progressed, his bag snagged onto a lock or a piece of metal sticking out, causing him to curse under his breath. Every sound now echoed and crashed in his ears.\n\nThe end of the corridor approached now, and Charlie could now make out the sound of rustling of fabric coming from behind the corner. He crouched low with his back to the wall, his backpack pressing into him so that he wasn’t exactly flush. He flicked off his flashlight and sat in what was now utter darkness. All the lights in the school had extinguished themselves, as if they had winked out of existence. As slowly and quietly as he could, Charlie peeked his head around the corner. He wasn’t prepared.\n\nLarge gloved hands swooped down and grabbed him by the collar and yanked him standing, then quickly wrapped a piece of cloth around his mouth. Charlie bit his lip, and a metallic tasting trickle of blood ran down the inside of his cheek. He was slammed back against the wall and held there in place. Charlie couldn’t see what was restraining him, but his attacker now stood several paces from him and loomed large in the dark.\n\nThe attacker made a swift movement and Charlie flinched, expecting to be hit; instead, he heard the striking of a match. A blue flame erupted in front of him, lighting his surroundings in an eerie haze.\n\nHis attacker did not look right. He, if it could be called that, stood seven feet tall at least, and was draped in a silver cloak. The hands that cradled the blue flame were wrapped in a black fabric of some kind, seamless and strong. The attacker’s face reflected the flame sharply, for his facial structure was very boney, and the skin sat taught over them. A square jaw protruded from under pursed lips, and the man appeared to have no hair on his face whatsoever.\n\nNone of these features were as weird, though, as the eyes. Charlie could only describe them as milky white and swirling, constantly in motion. The attacker peered at Charlie, unblinking, taking in the boy with an almost insatiable curiosity.\n\nCharlie could not tell if the man meant him harm—or, at least any more that he had already caused—or if he simply wanted to ask him a question. The moment lingered for what seemed like an age. Charlie realized he was the only one breathing. His attacker, the man with the milky white eyes and silver cloak, just stood in place as if a statue. Charlie struggled to free himself from the wall, but he simply could not move. Finally, the man spoke.\n\n“You are the first.” That was all he said. Charlie blinked, dumbstruck, and just looked back at the man. It made no sense. Charlie tried to speak and found this time he was able.\n\n“What do you mean I’m the first? Who the hell are you? Why did you attack me? Why can’t I move? Why is it so quiet? Where is everyone? How did it get so dark? What the hell?” The questions escaped Charlie’s lips in a matter of seconds, running together to form one long sound. He doubted this bizarre-looking man would answer his questions, if he had managed to understand them.\n\n“Do you answer the call, Invoker?”\n\n*Ok, I need to get out of here*, thought Charlie. Drug addicts did not frequent Black Rock very often, as there was no real reason to supply such a boring city. Everyone who lived here descended from mining families or academics, and everyone here knew each other.  No one dealt drugs and no one used. So why was there a tweaked-out freak now in Charlie’s school, and why was he calling Charlie the first and Invoker?\n\n“Are you going to hurt me?” Charlie asked in a very matter-of-fact manner.  He tried to not make any emotional pleas or appeal to any sense of reason. Only someone clearly out of his or her mind would dress up in a silver robe, wax their body clean of any hair, and do something funky to their eyes. The man’s response to Charlie was to simply ask his question once more,\n\n“Do you answer the call, Invoker?” This time he asked more forcefully.  Charlie thought he detected a pang of desperation in the words. So weird.\n\n“Yeah, sure. Whatever you say, guy. Just let me go.” The silver-robed, milky-eyed attacker closed his eyes and smiled. He stood for a moment, not breathing, not moving, and just smiling in place with his eyes closed. The scene reminded Charlie of standing in front of a great marble-fountain statue at night.\n\nSuddenly, without hesitation, the man jolted his eyes open and punched Charlie in the face. Blood spurted from his nose.\n\n“Your blood has now been spilled, Invoker. The call has been answered.” Whatever force was restraining Charlie vanished, and he collapsed to the floor and cupped his nose. It hurt more than he remembered, having been the recipient of blows to the face before, and the blood ran sticky through his fingers. But as painful as it was, he didn’t think it was broken. He knew that pain too well.\n\nHe took a few minutes plugging his nose with tissue from his backpack, and slowly got to his knees. The light had restored itself in the hallways of his school, and the corridors were now packed with students staring at him and with looks of confusion and bewilderment. Some pointed and laughed. Most had mouths agape and dared not speak a word. Mr. Snyder stood at the forefront of the crowd of onlookers, arms crossed and great belly drooping over his belt, a smirk of satisfaction on his ugly face.\n\n“Fighting invisible people, Mr. Storm? Accidentally hit yourself in the face? I hope that doesn’t hurt too much, and I hope your nose stops bleeding. Wouldn’t want you messing up my furniture, would I. Get a move on, boy. Now.”\n\nCharlie scowled and got to his feet. He didn’t know what had just happened to him, but it seemed as if it had all been in his mind. Snyder had implied he had been fighting with invisible people. Charlie didn’t think he could live that down.\n\nHe dragged himself to Snyder’s office and plopped down into the hard, wooden chair he frequented so often. Waiting for Snyder to return and no doubt make his life more miserable than it already was at that moment, Charlie couldn’t help but notice the falcon sitting on Snyder’s windowsill, unmoving, eyes fixed.\n\n[crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633475794, "digest": "nwE2nasv5yNSS40gu2gMgCNXw2BkQc88e3p6nJD0EiQ", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "1ZFAVS0AZWW3nc6PiJmYIAnUeMuXfyUNy1Yr5Fr8cms", "title": "Chapter One: Lumi", "body": "Lumi roared into the the rain. She couldn’t hear her own voice , as it was drowned out by the torrential winds ripping at her shirt and through her hair. She kept yelling all the same, until her chest heaved and her breath was exhausted. And then she was quiet—no longer a lion, just a girl in a storm.\n\nNobody had taught her how to be brave, or how to deal with pain, so she’d taught herself. If she screamed loud enough, for long enough, the visions would fade. She hated the scattered memories that weren’t her own, the fractured images that meant nothing, but she could do nothing but stare into the always-grey sky. \\\\n Quiet now, and drenched, Lumi began her slow walk back home. Her brother would be likely be waiting, back from another day of Labour, and worried sick. He didn’t like when Lumi walked alone at night. It didn’t matter to him that she’d grown up in Junction, or that she knew the streets as well as anyone.\n\nGritting her teeth, Lumi refused to cower, pushing forward into the surge instead of finding shelter and huddling for warmth.\n\nWhen she finally arrived at the bunker, the door slid open and her brother rushed out with a blanket. He tossed it around her shoulders and ushered her inside. Though Lumi wanted to shrug off the blanket and retreat to her room, she allowed her brother the fiction of a family relations.\n\nTheir family was tattered, and had been since their parents had failed to come home after a mission. Instead, a representative of the Republic had visited their door, offering a salute and a kind word.\n\n“Eat,” said Tru. He set a disc on their table. It was full with a beige substance, halfway between liquid and solid. “Sorry, only nutritionals today. It’s this war, Lumi. The Republic is driving Labour harder, yet credit allotments are stagnant.”\n\nShe sat, grabbed a spoon, and began shovelling the paste into her mouth. There was no taste—only texture—and she kept her expression vacant as she swallowed.\n\nTru grimaced. “Sorry,” he said again. He dug into his own muck and ate with the same excitement.\n\n“Don’t apologize,” said Lumi. “I’m the one who’s sorry. You were forced into your path, Tru, and it’s kept us alive. I’ll always be thankful.” She looked away, and wiped a tear from her eye.\n\n“Well, kid, look on the bright side: your path is wide open. Selection is soon, isn’t it?”\n\nLumi nodded. Her seventeenth birthday had come and gone, but the Republic couldn’t test individually—there were far too many wanderers in the world. Twice a year, the Republic sent an emissary to usher the wanderers into one of three paths: Labour, Thought, or War.\n\nThe Republic required the completion of many tasks, so most were designated to Labour. It was rare to be selected for the path of War, and Thought was even rarer.\n\nLumi’s parents had been warriors, though she didn’t know what that mean. Her parents had never spoken about their life in the Republic’s army. They’d not even wrote about it in their journal, Lumi’s most prized possession. She found it that day when the representative had come to her door with news of her parents’ deaths, when she’d raged around the bunker.\n\n“You want the path of war, don’t you?” asked Tru. He peered at her with crystal-green eyes, the same eyes she saw when she looked in a mirror, or at a picture of her parents.\n\nOf course she did. “I want to know what happened to them, Tru.” \\\\n He put down his spoon and sat back. “Even if you’re selected for War, Lumi, I doubt you’re going to find any answers.”\n\nThey’d had this conversation before—many times. “You can’t know that.” \\\\n “No, I can’t, but think about it, Lumi. Think—that’s what you’re really good at. Why would the Republic care about it? You think they’d allow one of their soldiers to go hunting for that kind of information? What would it mean to them, other than a waste of time and resources?”\n\nTru was right, but Lumi didn’t care. “I’m going to find out. They were special, Tru. I’ve seen the soldiers patrolling the streets, coming and going through Junction like we’re nothing but a harvest for selection. Our parents were different.” \\\\n Her brother opened his mouth to reply, to continue the familiar debate, but Lumi heard nothing. Her vision had blurred, and her head began to throb so violently that she pushed in her temples as if she could force the pain away.\n\nImages began to dance in her mind. Figures in sleek, white metal jumping and rolling between rubble. Lights pulsing from limbs, explosions and blood. \\\\n Lumi began to scream—to roar—and her voice echoed throughout the bunker. Tru was by her side in a second. Much too fast for a Labourer, she thought… \\\\n She awoke on her bed. Tru was mopping her head with a rag, his lips taught and eyes unmoving.\n\n“What did you see this time?” he asked.\n\n“I’ve seen it before,” Lumi answered. “It was the battle, with the white-metal fighters.” She closed her eyes, then squeezed them. “I saw the slaughter again.” \\\\n Tru placed the rag into a bowl of water, swirled it around, then wrung it out and continued mopping her head. For a time, he said nothing, and Lumi was grateful. She didn’t want to talk, or remember. She just wanted to sleep. \\\\n Eventually, her brother gripped her hand, then left the room, shutting the light as he went.\n\nLumi rolled over, desperate to find comfort in slumber. But all she saw were the last moments of unknown lives.\n\n[crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633475894, "digest": "0YiTlsvQtAXVAdit-P1i_-mO3NW4liod19C23_Fx0_I", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "Am_PRyLhTpo3rlS7hgClFo38vMAhkH_b_qRBEGkcJTA", "title": "Chapter One: Shadowdancer", "body": "Izak woke up while falling from the sky, and he could not seize the wind to slow himself. He pulled at the threads of the air and commanded it to slow his descent, but it would not listen. So he fell, and kept falling, and the ground filled his vision until he saw nothing else but his impending death. It would come too soon for him. He’d only just graduated from the Trials. Years of hard work—of sweat and tears—would be wasted. In the fleeting seconds he had left, his mind filled with hatred—for the wind, and for its little masters who would not hear Izak’s call.\n\nAnd then a strange thing happened. His descent slowed, and the rush of the air that had filled his ears died away. His body righted itself until his feet were beneath him, and then he floated the remainder of the way to the ground, like an autumn leaf on a breeze, until he set down in the middle of a clearing.\n\nTall grass surrounded him—pale green, almost yellow, like the fluttering ribbons that hung throughout the Ferundi territories—and the pink hues of the second sun painted the horizon.\n\nImmediately after he landed, Izak ducked low and crawled into the grass in a bid to hide himself. The wind still would not answer. It terrified him. When was the last time he’d been unable to summon the Naiads, he wondered? The Naiads’ silence screamed in his mind, perhaps as loud as the confusion that engulfed him.\n\nHe didn’t know this place. It was still Ferundi lands, yes, but nowhere like he’d seen, or like he’d heard about, during all of his travels and studies. The lake south of him should not have existed, for the seasons had run so dry for years on end. To see a body of still water—especially one so large—defied everything he knew about the world. To the east he saw a mountain range. It was so close he could trace the contours of its foothills as they rolled over the plains. Perhaps they were an outcropping from the other side of the Banna mountains, but no maps he know revealed territory to the west, nor any paths to venture upon to get there.\n\nIt took only a few moments of wayward thought over his whereabouts before Izak turned his inquiry upward, to the sky.\n\nHow? Why?\n\nSitting in the brittle grass, Izak bit his tongue to stop from sobbing. Devotion to the Naiads did not allow for weakness; they would not respond to the meek. It had been his first and most important lesson as he navigated the Trials, one imparted long ago by a woman far wiser than him. She was a professor—the professor—of the Zoren, and her face drifted into Izak’s vision. He tried to push the sight away, and he shouted into the still of the morning: “I am not weak!”\n\nHis voice sounded through the valley. It was a mistake. Suddenly, there was a rustling in the grass. Not the sound of movement like the echo of a breeze, but more violent—purposeful. Izak did not like it, so he jumped to his feet and ran into the clearing and away from the grass, turning to face what was coming and instinctively reaching for the wind. He found nothing. He was helpless. The Naiads had abandoned him, and had been left to die alone.\n\nBut he again avoided his fate, for a girl emerged from the grass, gasping for air as she tried to catch her breath. The fear upon her face eclipsed the fear surging through his body, and when she laid eyes on him she began weeping. Her tears flowed freely and fell to the ground. Izak stood there, struck silent and flustered, until the girl fell to her knees. Only then did he move—toward her, not away.\n\n“Why are you crying,” he asked. It was an odd sensation to feel compassion in that moment. There in the grass, lost and scared and unable to feel the tingle of a connection with the Naiads, his mind had reached for a shred of humanity to right himself. Yet he remained aware of his vulnerability.\n\nThe girl sniffled. “They’ll find us,” she said. Izak came closer, then sat on his heels and looked the girl in her eyes—crisp, violet eyes that danced. Izak restrained his shock. She was a firebreed. Izak’s instinct urged him to pull away, but he resisted. Us, she had said.\n\n“Who will find us?” he asked, but she shook her head. Izak threw more questions at the terrified girl: “Why am I here? Where are we?” His anxiety rose again, and the noises around him awoke, his senses no longer deafened by the fall and the fear. He heard the howling in the distance for the first time. A storm would come—soon. It would swirl inwards from the horizon, like all storms, culminating in a vortex that would last through the night.\n\nIzak reassessed his surroundings. It was imperative to find shelter, and quickly, and then to double-back at the right moment. Dodging storms was ingrained into him—a natural truth, like breathing. But there were other worries at the moment, and he needed to understand.\n\n“Listen to me.” Izak did not want to push the unstable girl, but she would not listen. “Listen!” He gripped her shoulders. “We need to leave. Do you understand?”\n\nShe nodded, and her autumn hair swished as she rose to her feet. Izak stood with her, and then they faced each other at full height. The girl’s composure seemed to return. Her tears had stopped flowing, and her lips no longer trembled. She raised her arm, slightly, and offered her hand. Izak grabbed it, and the girl immediately tugged; together, they ran through the grass and toward the forest.\n\n[crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633475814, "digest": "gPc8WfeHZqEL8FiL1_e6mPAELy7RtUgwShIW6jTAulY", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "eIZQlRtR0Zxu_G-5bbc4b-AEI8Q0e2pgmK6gPXEoPCM", "title": "Chapter One: The Vacation", "body": "We walk in tandem along the riverfront, side by side by side. Our colours match: dark blue, grey, black trim. I’m wearing trousers, of course, as is Oliver. They are straight-legged, unlike the sagging bottoms they wear in North Dome. Mary sports a long skirt, but there is nothing the Protectorate can do to prevent her legs from being seen.\n\nI chase the thought away, for it is dangerous.\n\nWe are a team—a unit—and our days are spent together in the factory, assembling and testing various components of some import or another. It is valuable work, they say. It is honourable. We’re not told the why or the what, but it is easy enough to see our lives are made easy if we just obey.\n\nAt night, we sip wine and eat bread on the curbside of our favourite bistro, discussing current events in the Protectorate and watching the circus of street performers go by. Routine is my anchor in a world I struggle to understand.\n\nThe bistro is our destination, and our table awaits us when we arrive. We seat ourselves in chairs rusting at the ends, too long spent in salt air beneath citizens like us seeking respite from the day. We watch the sun as it sets. It casts an orange glow that ripples in the streams of the harbour, but I’ve not the words to describe it, for I cannot abide the luxury of charm. From here, near the water and the perimeter of our zone, I can see the curvature of our dome as it extends high over our heads. It is much easier to describe, though it deserves no description.\n\nI shake my head to rid myself of the scorn creeping through. Thankfully our food arrives, and I bring my attention back to my compatriots. We immediately engage in conversation, picking up where we left off the night previous, as if there is one continuous stream of discourse running through our perpetual trio.\n\nMary is the brightest of us, and she opines in detail on the sociopolitical implications of North Dome’s extension toward the south—toward us—as she chews her food and washes it down with Western red. Of course, she only demonstrates the benefits of the movements. There can be no costs. It’s rather boring, but we must oblige her. It’s hardest for Oliver, whose face contorts as he listens in earnest to Mary’s observations. He is overt with his displeasure, which is exceptionally dangerous. Mary and I have learned to accept Oliver’s indiscretion—indeed we may have developed a fancy for it, like a pleasurable taboo, not that we’d know the feeling such a thing would inspire—despite the ever-present fear of being watched, caught, and disciplined.\n\nI must admit, there is a thrill to being in the presence of rebellion, but then I have for some time felt myself slipping from order. Indeed, when I wake up each day I am plagued with forbidden thoughts. It scares me. I cannot afford to think so negatively. My career and livelihood depend on keeping the course—adhering to protocol—and never, ever allowing innermost dreams, or desires, to seep out like an infection. Yet it continues, like an overflowing fountain of sin. Only my bonds with Mary and Oliver preserve me. Only indulging in Mary’s sermons and Oliver’s plain contempt stay the tides of collapse I fear may sweep over me.\n\nAm I different? It’s impossible to know. I recall the faces of those who passed me along the riverfront. They are bland, without expression, yet their owners seemed content. At least they did not appear sad or frustrated or disturbed. The Protectorate tells us this is social order: carry out your lives with your units, and return home to your assigned partner to sleep and procreate. Is this living? Have I ever known how to live?\n\n“Isn’t your first vacation upcoming, William?” Mary asks me in a suggestive tone, breaking the monotony of the conversation in which none of us were ever invested. She surely knows the answer, but it is polite to inspire conversation with a question.\n\n“Is that right?” Oliver is astounded, on the other hand. “But you’re always so balanced, William. So calm! I’d have guessed you’ve taken a hundred vacations by now to be so centred at your age.” Oliver scratches his head. “What is your age? I don’t think I’ve ever asked.”\n\n“You have not, and I’ve never offered the information,” I say. “I’m thirty-five tomorrow, if you must know, though I feel much older.”\n\nOliver claps, and I nervously swivel my head taking in my surroundings on the cobblestone, but there are no drones hovering near us. Oliver’s exuberance is undetected. “Right on schedule for your first vacation! You will *adore* it, William, I promise you. And what’s this talk of feeling old? Perhaps that will change quite soon, eh?” Oliver’s eyes twinkle.\n\n“Will you keep your voice down, sir? Please and thank you.” I deliver my rebuke with all of the force of a statue’s caution. Oliver sits back in his seat and brings his face neutral, though the spark in his eyes remains. “Of course, William,” he says, his voice flat. “Have you yet received instructions?”\n\n“He won’t have, Oliver.” Mary interjects, at the same time flicking her brown hair over her shoulder. It was a curious gesture, but pleasant. “Recall your first, if you can—no instructions, no details, just left to figure it out.”\n\n“Ah, yes,” says Oliver, and the corners of his thin lips turn up ever so slightly.\n\nI watch their interaction, confused and curious. It is true I will embark on my first vacation soon—next week in fact–and it is also true I have received no information other than to pack light and be timely. My partner, Sarah, has been on many vacations, that much I’ve gathered from our evening chats, but she has never shared anything about them. A sadness floats into her eyes whenever the topic arises, and I dare not push further lest we be fined. So, I am alone, without course or direction, left to fend for myself in the unknown. This is dramatic, I know; anyone who speaks of vacation does so with a perilous glimmer of excitement. Anyone to whom I’ve spoken other than Sarah, that is.\n\n“Yes, Mary,” I say at last. “I leave next week.”\n\nMary dangles her wine glass from a finger and bites her lip. I cannot help but notice and, to my surprise, flutter. Her movements are stirring in a way I know is improper. What would Sarah think to see me like this? Would she report me?\n\n“How do you feel about it, William?” Mary’s question is shocking, and I am unprepared. I nearly spit out my wine—what a disaster that would have been. There need not be drones nearby for that.\n\n“Feel?” I ask, less for clarification and more to probe why Mary would use such a word. She does not answer. Instead, she pulls a long drink from her glass, never letting her unblinking eyes leave my face. It is unsettling, and I stuff my mouth with bread to distract. A silence lingers between us three, interrupted only by the sounds of the streaming river and joyless cries from those out to enjoy the night. In that moment I dissect years of unity with my companions, thinking back on Oliver’s derisive gestations and Mary’s subtle seductions, and I chide myself for not being more diligent. In truth I should have reported them long ago. I knew where this was heading. I knew only bad things would result. Yet I am here, and perhaps I am not so different.\n\nWe finish our meal in the same silence, never returning to the topic of my vacation, nor revisiting our previous ramblings. Instead, we allow the evening to permeate around us, allow the humidity in the air to weigh us down, our heads most of us. And then, when we are done, we leave together and make our way home. We say our good evenings as we enter our adjoining domiciles, and I imagine we each kiss our partners on their respective foreheads as we begin to recount our day, until the street lights twinkle and go out, and the signal to sleep is received.\n\n[crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633475850, "digest": "V9m2r2x1AGkYaTP6dud3ug6SqxI0wZjDiv1KdMF4e2Q", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "iUg1Fynl--DHEa5uWRw-OPpFUgBhY3Llwt3-oQUBj74", "title": "Chapter One: The Speaker of Runes", "body": "William grew restless and he struggled to focus on the drone of information buzzing from the talking head that floated in front of him, a holographic projection tasked with guiding him through the program. It was talking about the magician war again.\n\nBy now he knew enough about the magicians to elevate to the next cycle, but the curators of the program wanted their participants thinking in lockstep; they did not tolerate a divergence of detail. His eyes wandered to the contours of the projected head and he tried to imagine the technology inside his alcove that brought the speaker to life. The floating head began speaking about human understanding of magic. William smiled at the irony.\n\n*Focus*. His mind was calm. On any other day, he would have panicked at the thought of not being ready for the new cycle, or worse, to be caught distracted. But today, on his sixteenth birthday, he found he didn’t care.\n\nThuds of hardened leather on polished marble floors grew close, and he knew the warden must have entered his aisle, one of many that ran between hundreds of evenly spaced alcoves.\n\nHe’d learned a long time ago to differentiate between administration and elite by their footsteps. Phantom sounds of the clicking of expensive shoes invaded his mind, and he looked to his right to the adjoining, empty alcove where Trevor had sat. The clicking in his mind grew louder, and he squeezed his eyes tight as if he could avoid remembering. He couldn’t, and he watched a vision of Trevor being hauled away by men dressed in black suits, tips of white pocket squares peeking from their breast pockets. Behind them, a white haired man, broad and tall, followed behind with hands clasped behind his back, and the clicking of his shoes faded.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, he was surprised to see the warden looking down into his alcove and directly at him. The warden wore combat fatigues, grey and white, with shoulder patches that bore the symbol of the regime -  a human, standing with arms akimbo and legs spread, inside of a circle and a square.\n\nHe looked up and met the warden’s eyes, his own carrying a hint of defiance. The warden set his square jaw and glared, bewildered, and spoke firmly.\n\n“What do you think you’re doing?”\n\nWilliam had no response. He continued to stare at the warden instead of engaging with the program. The warden didn’t ask again. Instead, he reached down and grabbed William. With a single jerk of a muscled arm, he was removed from his alcove and slammed face first to the floor at the warden’s feet.\n\nAs he brought himself to his knees, eyes downcast, he was grateful that the warden’s boots were not expensive and did not click. Punishment would be swift, but he would not be dragged away like Trevor, off to be lobotomized.\n\nSearing pain shot through William’s arm as the warden stamped his brand. His skin blistered at the focused heat as it was lasered into his upper arm. It was over in an an instant, but the pain lingered with an intensity that seemed to grow. He’d never before been branded. It would be a black mark on his record, and he’d be unlikely to progress further than the second level cycles. So many years given to the regime - taken by the regime - thrown away in a moment of wayward thought.\n\nWilliam was tossed back into his alcove to re engage with the program, and he did so without hesitation. *What was I thinking?* It hadn’t been his first stray from the regime’s control. He thought of the piece of charcoal sitting in his satchel, and how from time to time he’d scrawl his name upon the base of the nearest skytower. He thought of his sneaking into the Quarantine to walk among the dead. But to openly reject the program and defy the regime, it was beyond foolish.\n\nThe talking head was still preaching. William tuned in, compensating for his behaviour by paying more attention than necessary.\n\n“Scientists postulate that the magicians derive from an parallel universe, and that they’re world exists in the same space and time as Earth. Such theories would explain why they look like us, and talk like us. The universes may be so close that the environment and evolutionary pressures were not dissimilar. ”\n\nWilliam sat straighter and listened in earnest. This information was new, unlike the grand summaries of the war he’d been used to hearing. Possibly the regime was introducing new information at the dawn of a new cycle, an elevated step in the program. His excitement faded quickly as he reached to his throbbing arm.\n\nThe talking head continued. “The practice of magic, of course, is the most distinct of the departures from the same path of selection, natural or artificial, and it remains the grandest mystery from the war.”\n\nLecture stopped soon after, and William spent the duration of the day immersing in the practical application of the program. At birth he’d been selected for engineering, so the panel walls in his alcove were alight with complex equations, radiating electric blue. To answer, he would wave his hands in the air and manipulate them, drawing new lines of light on the panels. Occasionally, when not solving fast enough, numbers appeared in the top right corners of the panels and began to count down. Hurried streaks danced out  his fingers as he raced against time and worked his way through the more difficult equations.\n\nHours later, when the sun began to set and an orange haze settled on this city, the chimes began to sound. He sat back, exhausted, with sweat beaded on his brow. The panels powered down, leaving only inclined walls, seamless and obsidian black, and the floating head snapped out of sight. One of the now dormant panel walls shifted, forming itself into a staircase. He climbed out and joined the ranks of other participants as they shuffled in unison towards the Hub’s exit.\n\nAs he walked, he noticed he was the only standing straight with raised chin, and all around him participants bowed their heads, their faces sullen. He continued to rub his arm as if he could wipe away the regime’s sigil, but the mark would remain, a reminder of his surprising recklessness. *At least the burning will fade*.\n\n“I saw everything.” He hadn’t noticed Jacob had join his side. He stayed silent, eyes fixed forward, and he kept his pace. On a good day, he struggled to bite his tongue at Jacob’s needling. On a day like today, when he needed respite and a place to think, he’d be hard pressed. But to his surprise and relief, Jacob said little else.\n\nThe boys made their way to the Hub’s bottom level and pushed through the crowd that had gathered at the exterior doors, emerging into the cold steel sterility of the regime’s finest city. To the east, at the centre of the city, skytowers soared into the sky, each exactly the same height as the next and evenly spaced.\n\nTheir Hub was built differently, constructed at the city’s edge. It stood only several floors high, but its width spanned several sectors on the grid. The building curved in the shape of an elongated arch, nestled against the border of the Quarantine. Western-facing walls were made of translucent glass, and participants had an unobstructed view of the ancient battleground and the fringe that lay beyond.\n\nWilliam had been gazing into the Quarantine for as long as he’d been a participant, and he blamed the view for his first moment of rebellion. For years he’d been instructed about the desolation within and forbidden from entering, but all he could think about was the silence.\n\nHe remembered his first time, and the stealth he’d conjured to avoid the camera globes mounted at every corner of the city. He remembered cutting through the border fence and finding his way inside, and his first walk amongst toppled buildings and broken cement. Serenity had washed over him, easing his mind from the reality of living in a world devoid of free thought and independence, where every moment of every day was planned with outcomes predicted. Thereafter, every now and then he would venture into the Quarantine as an escape from the program’s daily rigour, even for just an afternoon, or an evening.\n\nTonight, he would visit again. He’d decided to flee into the Quarantine the moment he’d been branded. Even if just for the night, he needed the escape to remain calm and find his balance. *One brand isn’t so bad*. Greater disciplines would be out of reach, but plenty still remained to allow for a comfortable life. If he wanted to ensure a future in the regime of any kind, he’d need to realign and get himself together.\n\n“I’m going for a walk.”\n\nThe sandy haired boy next to him stopped, dropped his satchel to the ground, and placed his hands on his hips.\n\n“What’s going on with you? What was that back there?” Jacob reached out and flicked the brand. William winced and pulled away.\n\n“I don’t know. Got distracted, I guess.”\n\n“You guess?”\n\n“Just drop it.”\n\n“How can I drop it? You were *branded*, William. That means--”\n\n“I know what it means.”\n\n“Fine. What are you going to do about it?”\n\n“I told you, I’m going for a walk. Want to come along?”\n\nJacob looked at him sceptically. They were not really friends as much as similarly aged teenagers, each selected for engineering, that kept pace with each other as they progressed through the program; but that was as close as anyone came to friends. The program demanded so much time and energy it did not leave much for anything but efficient progression. Archaic concepts like friendship were not encouraged.\n\n“It’s your birthday, isn’t it?”\n\n“How’d you know that?”\n\n“Checked you out in the database after the warden branded you.”\n\nWilliam didn’t want to know what other information had been dug up in the regime’s centralized network. He sucked a breath and nodded.\n\n“So, you coming?”\n\n“Why not. You should have some company on your birthday. Lead on.”\n\nThe walk to his secret entrance to the Quarantine was not far. William led them south of the Hub, parallel to the Quarantine perimeter, to a complex of cubed buildings; low-tier residential units for unimpressive graduates of the program. Behind the complex were a series of hills and valleys dense with rusted equipment and broken vehicles, a graveyard of obsolescence that offered many spots to hide from searching eyes. Jacob did not ask any questions as he dipped along with William between the relics of human history that the regime hid from their cities and pretended didn’t exist.\n\nEventually, the boys found themselves in a nook between two hills and the skeleton of a tank, muzzle of its heavy gun pointed past the fence and into into the Quarantine. At the base of the hills, the ground moved down as if falling into a crater. William stood straight from his crouch, confident he could not been seen here.\n\nWilliam braced himself and stepped towards the border.\n\n“What are you doing?” Until this point, Jacob had accompanied William on his walk without complaint. “I hope you’re not planning on going in there.”\n\n“Relax. This place has been dead for ages. We’ll be fine.”\n\n“But the--”\n\n“We’ll be fine, Jacob.”\n\nHe turned back to the tall, linked fence, coils of barbed along its top. Large, square signs were interspersed every hundred feet and warned against entry into the Quarantine. Each bore the regime’s symbol.\n\nOne such sign sat at the lip of the leftmost hill that hid the nook. He placed a foot against the fence and another on the hill, and he shimmied his way up to the sign. When he reached it, he grabbed the bottom corners and lifted it away from the fence, revealing the hole he’d cut years before.\n\nJacob’s face contorted as he watched, trying to speak but only letting loose a grunt. William did not react. To him, entering the Quarantine now felt as natural as breathing, as if he’d trained himself over several years to endure a poison.\n\n“I’m sorry Jacob. I’ve been here before; many times. It’s fine, I promise, but you can go. Thank you for coming this far.”\n\nWilliam looked up into a dark grey sky, like one giant cloud drooping over the city. A storm had blown in and the orange haze from the receding sun had all but gone. Far away, a streak of lightning flashed, and a roll of thunder reached his ears a few seconds later. It wasn’t loud enough to drown out the monotone preaching of the regime that continuously poured out from the loudspeakers placed throughout the city.\n\nJacob stared past William and beyond the fence, to the landscape of destruction beyond, made up of toppled skyscrapers, abandoned vehicles, and other relics from an urban vista lost ot the war. Several kilometres in the distance, the Rift rippled in the air, lingering over the Quarantine. It was dead, now only a monument to the past.\n\n“You’ve been there?”\n\n“More times than I can count.”\n\n“And they don’t know?\n\n“If they did, I wouldn’t be here talking to you.”\n\nJacob smirked. “Fair enough. I guess I could go a little further.”\n\nSmiling, William turned back to his hole and dropped through, and Jacob followed soon after. The other side was immediately different, as if the fence had been erected at the brink of desolation, and the boys navigated their way down into the ruins, taking care not to disturb the ash and rock. Occasionally a drone buzzed overhead and William would motion for Jacob to lay still.\n\nThey continued in this fashion for a long time, making their way towards the centre of the Quarantine, where the Rift shimmered high above. Along the way, Jacob expressed his amazement at broken and dusty artefacts. William remembered being so amazed, but now it just made him calm. Gradually the scattered rubble grew into a maze of shattered infrastructure. He spread his arms and allowed his fingers to trace broken stone while he navigated obstructed roads, and all around him he saw neon streaks of graffiti.\n\nThe graffiti was everywhere, wildly drawn, like autographs of poets who desperately marked their place and their time, and he imagined them crying out:  “Look! I was here!” Now, the poets were gone, forgotten to the passing of years, but their autographs remained. William swelled with joy as he imagined the poets learning that were remembered; then sorrow, as he reflected on his own life, bereft of such an opportunity.\n\nHe kept moving, eyes following the markings, and sometimes amidst the scribbles he saw smaller symbols, concise and uniform. The patterns made his mind wander and he imagined a recreated cityscape teeming with unshackled life that pulsed with creativity. With sadness, he realized the graffiti was all that remained of a past world of hope and freedom, and he would never understand, or appreciate, the meaning behind the symbols that remained.\n\n“Do you feel it, Jacob?”\n\n“Feel what, William?”\n\n“Freedom, I guess.”\n\nHe signalled to Jacob to stop their trek, and they halted near a clearing at the centre of the quarantine, ringed by rubble but otherwise open, sometimes even patched with green. The rift lingered straight above. Jacob had never been this close, and he gazed, awestruck and terrified. They were was at the epicentre of the magicians’ invasion, the final battlefield of the war.\n\nWilliam did not pay attention to the rippling air overhead. Instead, he faced a large slab of limestone that seemed to have fallen from high above and buried itself into the ground without breaking. It was a clean slate, and he would add his own autograph for the ages. The signature would be his and his alone, a memory of his own to add to the lost stories in the quarantine.\n\nHe dropped to one knee and unstrapped his satchel. He reached inside and dug around until he found the piece of charcoal that he’d used to mark his own graffiti on the regime’s skytowers, an act that, if caught, would have sent him for lobotomy. As it happened, the steel walls were not good mediums, and the charcoal markings had quickly blown away in the winds that swept through the city without relent.\n\nThis slab of stone would be different. He dreamed that his mark would last for years. It would be only the smallest of chinks in the Regime’s order, but it would be William’s own, and he imagined himself standing beside the poets and yelling along with them “Look! I did this! It was me!”\n\nHe stood, clutching his charcoal, and approached the stone, but when he stood directly in front of the smooth white surface, he felt suddenly very small. For all his bravado, he couldn’t rise to his moment, and he couldn’t think of anything to draw or any graffiti to tag. He tried to will himself through the block, and he raised his arm and touched the tip of the charcoal to the stone, but his hand just shook. He found he did not have anything to say. The poets of the past had stories to tell, but he had nothing. He was no poet. He squeezed his eyes, bared his teeth, and screamed out into the vacant surroundings, his voice echoing back.\n\nJacob startled but said nothing, though he trembled and kept glancing overhead.\n\nWilliam decided that if couldn’t say something for himself, he would borrow the words. His mind played back to the graffiti he’d passed on the way, and neon scribbles flashed in front of him in rapid succession, so fast they became blurred together into a hallucinated light-show. Then, as abruptly as it had begun, the flickering images froze in his mind, and a single symbol pulsed before him. It was one of smaller etchings, concise and uniform, and different from all the others. It appealed to him for a reason he could not articulate.\n\nHe smiled, his vision filled with the blank stone canvass in front of him. He slowly traced the lines of the symbol that lingered in front of his eyes like an optical illusion. Thick black lines began to take shape on the stone. He took his time. The symbol itself was relatively simple, but he was methodical, wanting to ensure his mark on history was perfect.\n\nThe second that he had finished the symbol, the charcoal residue solidified and began smouldering. He fell backwards in shock. Jacob looked on in horror. The symbol sunk into the stone, then began glowing orange. William could only watch, astonished. A high pitched whine began to fill the air. He scrambled to his feet and ran. Jacob followed. Seconds later, the glowing orange symbol lit ablaze like the sun, and the stone tablet split apart with a crack that could be heard for miles, distinct from the thunder that continued to roll through the sky.\n\nWilliam covered his ears at the sound and fell to the ground, out of breath and confused. He turned his head towards his canvass and saw only fractured rock. But among the remains, a piece of stone was perfectly preserved. It was the area on which he had drawn the symbol. The symbol was no longer glowing, now just faded graffiti, another forgotten autograph. In his peripherals, he saw Jacob pointing to the sky, mouth open with screams unheard.\n\nSirens began blaring before William could make sense of the situation. To his knowledge, never in the last four years had the Regime caught wind of his presence in the Quarantine, but the symbol and splitting stone had drawn their attention.\n\nHe lurched to his feet, grabbed Jacob by the arm, and began to run with all the speed he could muster. Jacob scampered along with him, his face set in shock. They didn’t run fast enough. Spotlights began sweeping the area, appearing with the suddenly circling helicopters, locating the boys with ease and tracking them as they ran.\n\nAt last, William saw an opening within a fallen structure and pointed. Jacob looked and nodded, and they dashed to the side and slipped into the opening. Once inside, they collapsed to the floor, breathless. William rested his head back against the cold concrete. It was no use. They couldn’t escape, and they’d spend the rest of their lives lobotomized and serving soup to the elite atop their skytowers. It was not the birthday he’d wanted.\n\n“Come with me. Now.”\n\nWilliam’s eyes shot open and he gasped, startled. In front of him stood a woman, tall, grey haired. She looked withered, but not from age. Exhaustion, maybe. Her skin was taught over high cheekbones and her lips were pursed.\n\n“Who are you?” He had trouble getting out the words.\n\n“We need to go.”\n\nThe sirens kept blaring, and he now heard dogs barking and yells from their masters as they searched the Quarantine. He had little choice.\n\n“Ok. Let’s go”\n\n“William.” Jacob’s spoke softly.\n\nHe stood and brushed himself off and looked at Jacob. The boy was falling to pieces before his eyes. “It’s her or them.”\n\nThe sounds of barking dogs and yelling men grew closer.\n\n“Choose quickly.” The woman’s voice was stern, but not scalding.\n\n“We’re just kids, in the wrong place and wrong time. They’ll believe us, I know they will. We can start the cycle tomorrow and complete the program. Please.”\n\n“Are you so naive?”\n\nJacob shrunk at the woman’s rebuke. He didn’t respond, but crouched against the wall and pulled his knees close, frozen with indecision.\n\nWilliam thought he heard the scuffling of feet on concrete and knew the searchers had entered the structure. He walked quickly to the boy and grabbed his arm.\n\n“Jacob, let’s go, damnit.”\n\nThe boy did not fight and rose to his feet as William’s pulled him up. The woman turned swiftly and made her way through cracks in the stone. The boys scampered after her, fleeing from their pursuers.\n\nAs they moved deeper, the light that seeped inside began to fade, until William, Jacob, and the woman became consumed by blackness. William reached out to brace against the stone walls and orient himself.\n\n“I can’t see.”\n\n“Shhhh.” The old woman’s response was not comforting.\n\nHe saw a flicker a motion in front of him, and a white light sparked a few feet from the ground. He then saw the woman’s fingers trace a pattern in the air. A small, glowing symbol began to drift in front of the now visible woman. The symbol began to swirl until it coalesced into a ball of radiating light. A corridor revealed itself, and the woman beckoned as she made her way forward.\n\nWilliam did not move. His mouth gaped in astonishment and he clutched the stone around him, terrified.\n\n“Magician!”\n\nJacob’s instincts had been correct, and he cursed himself. But Jacob was too frightened to gloat, his face white with terror. The woman peered at him but did not answer. She beckoned again for the boys to follow through the corridor. Faint sounds of yelling men reached his ears. The regime had not yet abandoned their search.\n\n“Are you going to kill us?”\n\n“No.”\n\nWilliam he steeled himself in the face of the magician, seemingly trapped. He nodded, and pushed forward into the corridor behind the woman. Jacob did not follow. He held his breath, censoring his growing frustration with his companion.\n\n“Jacob, we need to go now.”\n\nThe boy finally spoke, colour returning to his face.\n\n“She is a magician!”\n\nThe woman watched, her eyes twinkling in the glow from the symbol she’d inscribed, now orbiting her body.\n\n“If she wanted us dead, we’d be dead. The regime is coming for us, Jacob. I think we should take our chances with her.”\n\nJacob’s shoulder slumped and he stifled a sob. He pulled his tunic straight to flatten the wrinkles before shooting William a scornful look.\n\n“Going for a walk, huh.”\n\nWilliam squinted and pursed his lips, but took the comment as a good sign. He turned and met the magician’s gaze. She seemed so human. A hint of a smile curled at the corners of her lips and she disappeared through a toppled elevator shaft. They hurried after her without a word.\n\nA long time passed as they navigated their way through the fallen skyscraper. The woman seemed confident in their path, as if she’d walked it many times before. The sirens eventually grew faint, and the air became cooler. William thought they were travelling downwards into the earth, and it wasn’t long before his suspicions were confirmed. The walls changed from stone to compacted dirt and moss.\n\nHe broke the stillness with a question.\n\n“May I ask who are you?”\n\n“You may ask. I may not answer.”\n\n“Ok. Who are you?”\n\nThe woman didn’t respond. He sighed, desperate for an explanation.\n\n“Why were you here, at this spot, and this moment?”\n\n“You’ll have your answers soon enough, young one.” Her words were clipped, but she did not seem impatient. William got the impression that she intended to speak with them eventually.\n\nShe spoke no more, and they made the rest of the journey in silence. After a tiring amount of walking, their journey ended in a small opening barely larger than the standardized apartments in the city. William saw a bed ,and an empty desk, and a large map spread over one side of the room. It wasn’t an ordinary map of scroll and ink. This map hovered above the table, vertically, projecting the depicted landmass in three dimensions. He did not recognize it.\n\nTurning his thoughts to the rest of his surroundings, he could not imagine anyone living this small hole below the earth.\n\n“Is this your home?”\n\nThe woman crossed the room, her strides long and graceful, and sat on the bed with a thud, as if unloading a heavy weight. She looked at William.\n\n“Home? No, this is not my home, but this is where I survive.”\n\n“Survive? You survived the war?”\n\n“Yes, but it was no war.”\n\nHis face scrunched, confused.\n\n“There are several square kilometres of battlefield above our head, and a tear in space and time, that say otherwise.”\n\nThe woman’s lips curled slightly, a vestige of a smile.\n\n“You know much.”\n\n“The regime mandates that the program contains a full account of the magician war, so that order may be preserved: *We must remember the most important moment in human history*.”\n\nEven now, Jacob found an opportunity to show off. But the woman was not amused. Her small smile disappeared in an instant, and she hissed.\n\n“Ah, the regime, with their closed minds and machines. Spare me.”\n\n“You lost; the regime won. Humans won.”\n\nThe woman screamed with hatred. The boys shrunk away from the woman, scared once more. She noticed and bent forward to rest her elbows on her knees, hands clasped and head bowed low.\n\n“I am sorry. The pain is still too near.”\n\nWilliam’s face was stone, and he had no sympathy to spare for a magician. Still, he did not enjoy seeing the woman’s despair. He sought to change the subject, but more to ease his own discomfort than the woman’s.\n\nWilliam pointed at the hovering map, still not believing the magic before his eyes. It appeared to be made of paper, or perhaps vellum, and through it ran shadows of pinkish light. The projected landmass also seemed  to derive from light, green energy that coursed outwards. He marvelled at the intricate details of the map that no pen or printer could ever create. The program’s holographic documentaries had not done magic justice.\n\n“Where is that?”\n\nThe woman raised her head and briefly looked at him before glancing at the map.\n\n“That is Aeyu.”\n\nHe looked blankly at the woman.\n\n“Ay yoo?”\n\n“That’s right.”\n\n“That’s not a real place.”\n\n“I assure you it is real.”\n\n“Right.” William’s let the word drag out and squinted.\n\nThe woman did not flinch. She kept her eyes on him as he slowly started backing up towards the door through which they’d entered, signalling to Jacob to do the same. He had no intention of staying down here with a magician speaking of imaginary places.\n\nThe woman, though, was quick and clever. She flicked her wrist and traced a red symbol in the air. It faded from sight as quickly as it appeared. Nothing happened. William cocked his head, then turned and sprinted for the door. He travelled two steps before crushing his body into a barrier he could not see, then crumpled to the ground, winded. Jacob crashed down next to him.\n\nHis mind reeled and his vision was spotted. The woman appeared above him and bent over, looking directly into his eyes as he stared up at the ceiling, disoriented.\n\n“It is it your birthday?”\n\nHe rolled onto his side and grunted. “What?”\n\n“I asked if it is your birthday.”\n\nExasperated. “Yes, it’s my birthday. How’d you know that?”\n\nThe woman crouched beside him, and he studied her face in detail for the first time. He had thought her an old woman, but now he saw she was barely middle aged. By human standards, anyway. Her greying hair was braided and swept over her left shoulder, and an elongated, silver rune was tucked behind each ear. The lines of her jaw were sharp and her cheekbones high.\n\n“The ability to speak with Aeyu manifests at sixteen years of age. Children are eager for the day to arrive, for that is when we depart for study of the runic language and the ability to write it. It is a great tradition.”\n\n“Speak with Aeyu? You just told me Aeyu is a place.”\n\n“It is.”\n\nHe could not make sense of the woman. Now sitting and rubbing his head, he stated the obvious. “I am not a Magician.”\n\nThe woman smiled in earnest.\n\n“We shall see.”\n\nWilliam glanced up, taken aback. “What?”\n\n“For now, it’s important for you to know that you cannot go back.”\n\n“Go back where?”\n\n“To the Regime, of course. To your Program. To your family, and your friends, if such a thing exists any more, and to your so-called-life. Today was a turning point from which you cannot return.”\n\nHe pulled himself to his feet and steadied himself, still woozy from the impact with the woman’s barrier. When he found his footing, he placed his hands on his waist and stared at the woman, defiant.\n\n“And why is that?”\n\nThe woman stared back to William, and he could feel her conviction.\n\n“Because if the regime learns who you are, they will kill you, and they will kill everyone you love. Make no mistake.”\n\n[crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633475831, "digest": "ogGA5C2mfvGT--sE06g4tgMjRef5to-qO02xQLQbMBU", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "j5cshaOYjmLXPmdNLnLH5nZrO80j3vUwQEjoHvGIlnc", "title": "Chapter One: Counterpoint", "body": "I still didn’t know what was going on. I remembered walking through night-markets in Shinjuku, eating fried octopus and watching neon lights ripple in the air over thousands of crowded locals and tourists alike. I remembered seeing a light, intense and enormous, then hearing screams and the pounding of feet on pavement. I remembered waking up in this room.\n\nThere were others, maybe a few hundred. No one had talked me or answered my questions. Not even when I had yelled or beat my hands against grey walls until my fists bruised and bled. The others had just sat and watched, twirled the ends of their sashes in their hands or laid back on beds protruding from the floor. I became accustomed to silence.\n\nSeveral more newcomers had appeared in the room since I first woke up. I hadn’t seen them arrive. How was that possible? They must have arrived while I was sleeping, awoken to their new reality just like I had. Each arrival wore similar clothes—white, loose fitting but durable robes, like a uniform or a gi from a martial arts studio, cinched by different coloured sashes. I counted four: blue, red, green, purple. To pass the time, I tried to find patterns, segment the colours between girls and boys, by age, by hair and skin colour, by height or weight. I’d always been good at patterns, but I saw nothing.\n\nNothing made sense. I would have gone crazy if not for the chimes. One for a meal, two for a snack. Three chimes to indicate a bathroom break, followed by the materialization of a door—or a dematerialization of a part of the wall—and a hallway flickering with hazy illumination. Before yesterday I’d never seen anything appear or disappear in such a way, but I didn’t care about spectacles or illusions or physics. I focused only on keeping sane, fighting the disassociation assaulting my mind. The chimes offered routine, and I clung to them.\n\nI listened to four chimes while laying on my bed, and then the room went dark with the thunk of powerful lights being deactivated. Immediately, the stars far above the windowed ceiling revealed themselves and began to twinkle. My eyes drifted to a large orb, bright and blue, and I played with one thought before falling asleep: *Where am I?*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThings changed in the morning after the breakfast chime. Our food trays disappeared into the ground, fizzles from existence like the coming and going of the bathroom door, and then the room moved. It had been rectangular, cavernous, like a warehouse storing sacks of flesh and blood. Now it became square and squished, the ceiling so close I could reach up and touch the glass of the window. It was cold—very cold—and I pulled my hand away.\n\nMurmurs filtered through us, whispers and questions revealing fright and dismay. Our nature brought us together and we huddled as close as possible for several hundred bodies. Then four doorways materialized, one for each wall of the square. Behind each door stretched a hallway lit up by a different colour, one for each of our sashes: blue, red, green, purple. Five chimes rang, and the murmuring became a crescendo of confusion. No one moved to the hallways. Everyone stayed huddled in the middle of the room. Some yelled and swore, cussing at no one in particular. The five chimes rang again, and the square shrank. A girl screamed, and a young boy began crying. An older boy knelt beside the crying boy in an attempt to provide comfort, the first display of kindness I’d seen. Still, no one moved. The chimes rang again. The square shrank, the walls so close those of us on the outer edges of the huddles mass could brace against them.\n\nThe implications were simple, so we started shifting to the hallways matching our sashes. I gripped mine by the dangling end and raised it in front of me. The material was soft, but when I tugged at each end I could sense its toughness and tensile strength. I let it fall to my side and then end bounced against my knee, then I walked to the edge of my hallway. A girl stepped next to me and I looked at her, measured her. She appeared about my age and stood a foot shorter. Her oval face ended in a point at her chin and she set her jaw firm, framed by long black hair and bangs that did not entirely hide green eyes, narrowed and angry.\n\n“My name is Ikko,” I said.\n\nThe girl shifted a glance but did not respond. I contemplated her for a moment before turning away and stepping side the hallway. My gi tinted green under the lights and I walked forward into a future I did not understand, to a destination I did not know. I looked back to see the others with green sashes follow me, led by the black-haired girl.\n\nWe walked straight ahead for a long time. The hallway never turned or curved. The floor under our feet was cold and smooth, formed by the same polished metal from within the room. So were the walls, which had no doorways or seams. Claustrophobia set in, and the sounds of breathing grew more laboured and rapid. More of us cried, pleaded for parents and familiar faces, horrible despair echoing through the tight corridor and infecting my calm. I tried to resist the temptation to give in to the agony of the unknown until the very end.\n\nI was saved by the end of the hallway. When I stopped and pressed my palms against the door, I closed my eyes and squeezed out a single tear. I wiped it away with the end of my sash, then turned to the mass of bodies who had stopped behind me.\n\n“We are here,” I said.\n\n“Where is here?” The black-haired girl spoke with no emotion in her voice, cold as the ceiling that had sheltered us from the stars. I had no answer, so I gave none. Instead, I pushed against the door. It did not swing open or give way, but it dematerialized as the others had done.\n\nAnother room opened before us. It was circular and ringed by a series of bed stacked three high. In the middle of the room I saw several chairs and tables, and upon those tables various contraptions made of a shimmering metal. And furthest from the door, a man sat at a desk. He also wore a gi—green, not white like ours—wrapped by a white sash. The man’s hair was tied up in a knot atop his head. His eyebrows were thick and bushy, and a single strip of beard fell from his lip below his chin. When we opened the door and entered the room, he stood from his desk and clasped his hands behind his back.\n\n“Welcome, Greens.”\n\nThe others fell into a flurry of motion and noise, running to them man and screaming, slamming their palms down on tables and kicking chairs. They wanted answers, they said they deserved answers, and they were right. I demanded answers, too. Why had we been brought here? Where was *here*? Who had brought us, and when would we return?\n\nBut the man offered no answers. He simply watched, silent, unmoving. Eventually the screams petered out, the disorder quieted, and the Greens began laying on bed or sitting in chairs. The stink of defeat sat heavy in the still air of the circular room. Only then did the man speak.\n\n“I will return in seven days.” A door materialized behind the man’s desk. He left and the door dematerialized, replaced by smooth, polished wall, leaving us alone with each other and the tables and the strange metallic contraptions upon them.\n\n“This is bullshit!” An older boy yelled at the wall and returned to disorder. Many joined him in throwing the contraptions around the wall and overturning furniture. I watched but did not give in to my emotion. Instead I called upon a stream of calm running through me, focused on self-control. I remembered kneeling in the grass while a gentle breeze flowed through my hair and rustled cherry blossoms. The memory was fuzzy and fragmented. How long ago had it been? How long have I been here?\n\n“You seek zen.” The black-haired girl stood next to me. She, too, removed herself from the chaos of the Greens who rejected their reality and expressed themselves with rage.\n\n“Where are you from, Ikko?”\n\n“My family lives in a small city in the north—Kakunodate—and I grew up in and around there. More recently I moved to Tokyo proper to pursue further training.”\n\n“Training for what?” she asked in earnest.\n\nI hesitated to tell her the truth, because my family and friends believed my pursuit to be foolish. Most refused to support me. Some would not even talk to me any more. They had preferred for me to focus on education and career, to become a salaryman like my siblings and cousins. But I had never developed that interest, had never wanted to follow that path. I had chosen for myself and accepted the consequences.\n\n“In the ways of bushido and samurai.”\n\nTo my surprise, the girl did not scoff or shrug. She did not cast judgment or seek to lecture me on honouring my family’s wishes. Instead, the girl crossed her arms and kept her eyes on the chaos unfolding in the circular room. Then she spoke.\n\n“My name is Hatsue. I am from Osaka.”\n\nI’d never been to Osaka, nor anywhere else in the country other than my small village and the sprawling metropolis of Tokyo. “What’s it like?”\n\n“Osaka?” She bit her lip and tugged at one the curving strands of hair that framed her face. “Vibrant. The people are friendly and the city is alive. And the food is amazing.”\n\n“Do you eat away from home often?”\n\n“I must, as I am a chef. My speciality is soba noodles, which I make from scratch every day.”\n\nI was impressed. Though I lacked experience in my own country, I understood its culture deeply. Crafting soba noodles was a thorough and detailed process. It took meticulous and time-consuming attention. Hatsue was an artisan. Nothing like me. No pattern.\n\n“Why do you think we are here, Hatsue?”\n\nShe finally turned to look at me, uncrossing her arms and gripping me gently by the arms. “I have been asking myself that question for two weeks.”\n\nTwo weeks? Hatsue had been here much longer than me. “How many of you were there when you woke up?”\n\n“A few, maybe a dozen,” she said.\n\n“Did you speak with anyone?”\n\n“No. No one seemed eager for conversation. We were all to confused and frightened, and that disarray only continued as more and more people began to appear.” She paused and cocked her head. “I remember when you arrived. You were among the last.”\n\nI squeezed my eyes. “I remember a bright light, and screaming.” I opened my eyes. “We ran.”\n\nHatsue nodded, recognition in her face. “I also saw a light. We also screamed and ran.”\n\n“What was it?”\n\n“I don’t know. Does it matter?” She shook her head. “We are here, and that man is returning in seven days. We are called Greens and there are a number of puzzles scattered about the room. Maybe we should keep our focus there until the man returns.”\n\nI squinted, inspecting Hatsue’s eyes and the corners of her mouth. “You are exceptionally calm. Perhaps you would be interested to the ways of bushido.”\n\nAt last, Hatsue smiled. “Perhaps I have been. Come,” she grabbed my hand,” let’s go talk to the others and try to figure out what it is our hosts expect from us.”\n\n[crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633475865, "digest": "WqfStekH7Ujt6IiWdHIvf64aC__Ih2OgODEWuSavWPw", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "K47bA12oWqOsDIQPbxzIieR_y_9tGX_mmGQWlf270yM", "title": "Chapter One: Ascension", "body": "Takha peered up into the hazy orange dawn. His eyes traced concentric circle rings running around an otherwise seamless tower that stretched from the ground before him and up into the Sky. He pushed his gaze as far as he could. Images of the Ascended danced through his mind. He imagined they wore all white and glowed under a halo of sunlight. This imagery sprung into his mind like an echo. Of course, he did not really know. He could not. No one could, nor could anyone tell you what really waited for them in the Sky. But everyone wanted to get there and find out. The people in the Muck didn’t know anything else. Everyone born here was raised with an eye to the Sky. Ascension.\n\nToday was Day One of the new Cycle. Takha sat on a slab of shattered stone directly across the street from the tower. His stone. He had sat there at the beginning of every new Cycle for as long as he could remember. His feet no longer dangled below him, kicking in anticipation of the faces that would pass him by on their way to the Passage. He grinned to himself at the memory of his heels bashing into the stone and the bruises left behind. No more. Now, his toes gripped into the ends of his shoes, firmly planted in the reddish dust that lined the streets of the Muck.\n\nThe crowds grew around him in the early dawn of Day One, undeterred by the morning chill. The lack of light in the Muck meant living in a perpetual shadow. Takha was always cold. Everyone was always cold. Yet people with tattered cloths and grimy faces streamed past Takha at his stone perch, chattering and reverberating with an infectious energy.\n\nThere were many hopefuls, and each took their place in one of several lines that had begun forming at different points along the Passage – a ring of panels at the base of the tower. Each line outstretched from a panel, and each line was growing long, like spokes from a wheel. Many more onlookers took root around Takha and beyond Some lay on withered grass and some draped out of their broken apartment. Some just stood in the dusty streets. The onlookers were either too young or too old, and they were either eagerly waiting for their time and their cycle or they were reminiscing about opportunity lost. The Passage would not respond to anyone below sixteen years of age or anyone older than twenty-five. If you didn’t Pass during the time in between you would be stuck in the Muck. Forever.\n\n“Takha! Over here!”\n\nTakha snapped his gaze into focus and followed the voice. He turned his head to the eastern most point of the Passage and saw a hand waving from amidst one of the lines. The hand flowed from a chubby arm that connected to a broad-shouldered boy with black hair and a toothy grin. It was Dento, his childhood friend. Takha smiled. Today was not only Day One of a New Cycle. Today was also Dento’s birthday. His sixteenth birthday.\n\nTakha and Dento were perhaps the most inquisitive of the 235s. They spent the majority of their days immersed in Lore, absorbing knowledge as if water in a desert. They learned of the magic of mathematics and language, the history of their ancestors and the path of the people before, and the wonderment of stories and emotions and what it meant to be human. They solved puzzles and played games. They read books and they wrote poetry. And they harnessed the knowledge that flowed from Lore like mills in a river. To follow this path was to become worthy of Ascension. Takha and Dento spent their entire lives in the Muck learning how to escape from it. And now, one this Day One, Dento would seize his chance.\n\nTakha jumped off his stone and strolled through the crowd towards Dento. Takha’s height was unusual in the Muck. The people were well nourished on account of the supply ships that descended every quarter-cycle. But the lack of light and the denser atmosphere of the Muck caused the people to grow more compact. Gravity. So said the Lore. In spite of this, Takha stood taller than most buy a large margin, so as he worked his way towards Dento he could see all the life bristling around the Passage. Day One was a holy day.\n\nTakha arrived at his friend’s place in line and looked down at the chubby boy. Takha examined the face smudged with dirt, white eyes brimming with fervor.\n\n“Are you ready, Dento?”\n\n“Of course!”\n\n“What is the precise distance from the Muck to the Sky?”\n\n“Easy, Takha. One point three kilometres.”\n\nTakha eyed his friend and remained sceptical. “And the authors of the First Global Constitution?”\n\n“Anderson, Weng, and Denton, if you mean the Monarch Papers; Tandingo and Santiago if you mean the Essays of the Republic. The Honourable Justice Twinfeathers, if you mean the final resolution and confirmation. Be specific, Takha.”\n\nTakha smirked. His friend was ready. One more, though.\n\n“What colour is my shirt?”\n\nThe chubby boy flinched, almost losing grasp of his consuming joy. But he held firm. “Nice try, Takha. You will not take this day from me. You know as well as I that there are too few panels calling a colour test. The odds are good—very good—and I am too happy to wonder on the alternative.”\n\nTakha flashed his own grin. “So be it.” He clapped his hand down on to his friend’s back. “Then this is where we part. I wish you luck, but not too much. It is my turn next cycle, and I shall hope to see you in the rings. Do not ascend without me.”\n\nDento beamed at his friend and waved as Takha retreated back to his stone. The chubby boy turned back to face the base of the Sky Tower and the Passage. The line ahead of him was quickly shrinking. Challengers in front of Dento and all around the Passage were turning away in defeat, crushed and in agony from their failure. The older the potential, the more brutal the despair. The twenty-five-year-olds were the worst, often breaking down and falling to the dusty ground, curled up in fetal positions. A display of utter helplessness. Sometimes Takha could hear a cheer lost amidst the cries, and he would catch a glimpse of a jubilant hopeful welcomed inside the Passage through a suddenly gaping hole where the panel had been. He hoped Dento remained confident.\n\nAt last, Dento’s time came. He stood at the tip of the line, nothing but unyielding blackness stretching to the horizons to each of his sides, and swallowed. He took several unsure steps from his place in line and stopped when he stood just shy of the Passage. Then he waited, but not long. The Passage shimmered before him and hummed into life, immediately displaying several complex equations. They radiated an electric blue and, while Dento could not see the colour, it did not matter for this particular type of examination. He exhaled deeply, relieved there would be no tasks of colour-based pattern recognition. He was secure in his own grasp of quantum mechanics.\n\nDento knew the equations would be visible to all who watched him attempt to secure entry through the Passage, but he refused to allow his nerves to overcome his calm. Instead, he began to wave his hands in the air, manipulating the symbols before him and drawing new lines of light on the panel. Time passed slowly and sweat beaded on Dento’s forehead. Eventually, numbers appeared in the top right corner of the panel and began counting down. Dento’s test was drawing to a close, one way or another. Dento squeezed his eyes and chewed his lip and struggled to find a solution. But, with little under a minute remaining in the examination, everything clicked in Dento’s head. He waved his arms in a flurry and then abruptly stopped.\n\nLights pulsed on his panel of the Passage, indicating a correct solution. The onlookers saw the blue lines of light turn green, and before Dento could himself react there was an eruption of jubilation that overcame him from behind. When realization swept over Dento and he finally did react, he fell to his knees under the weight of emotion. The panel in front of him winked out of existence and pulsed again with a white light around edges of a newly formed doorway, beckoning the successful ascendant to enter. Dento cried softly to himself and rose to his feet, slowly making his way into the tower and the beginnings of his Ascension.\n\nTakha had been watching from his atop his shattered stone. He had followed along with every wrong presumption and incorrect calculation. He had silently celebrated when Dento stumbled upon the corrections and worked his way to a solution. And he had mourned the closing of his lifelong friendship. Even if Takha made it past the Passage on his own Day One, he was not sure he would ever see Dento again. The concentric rings lining the Sky Tower were many, and broad, and Takha thought there were many steps to take along the path.\n\nLost in contemplation, Takha slipped away from his stone and made his way back to the Library and to the Lore, his mind firmly fixed on the next Cycle.\n\n[crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633475879, "digest": "jsk00xAY3IWIs50ppCLkuRWHEDTpxl4xCkcQ6FWJj_8", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}
{"id": "sqgH-O6zWYQu24dv7FX4xP_L9W2Ipi-1H4b3md__HEg", "title": "Chapter One: Aurfell", "body": "Once a year, when the two moons of Aurfell align with its blue sun, the House of Light and Dark unites. It is the Transcendence. The world is shrouded in darkness before giving way to the light. It is a union of the First One’s children—a union of the gods—and it must be celebrated, for once, long ago, the Light and the Dark stood apart, two sides of the Everwar.\n\nTonight, disciples of the House remember the blood of those who came before, and honour what their ancestors became. The disciples—from Acolytes to the Speakers themselves—throw off their silk and cast them into the streets until piles of white and black lay strewn around the city, until they stand bare under the darkening sky. But not for long. They replace their clothing. Now those who belong to the House wear new silk: white on the left, black on the right, with a triangle on the chest. It is split down the middle, and there is an orb at each point.\n\nLumessa is so dressed. A year ago, when she had chosen to walk the path of darkness, the Messenger for this part of the city—a man named Quine, short and fat, with a red nose scarred by time and liquor—had thrust the ceremonial attire into her arms while exclaiming, “Rejoice, for you are saved!”\n\nBut she has never cared about the House of Light and Dark, or its moon worship, and she had wanted to spit in the Messenger’s face. Instead, she had chosen to survive, for all residents of Aurfell must take a path. There is no alternative, and Lumessa had no intention of being evicted from the city and set to wander with the Red-Eyes or skulk with the Demons. So, she had accepted the silk with open arms and a smile, with eyes wide-open.\n\nNow, on the eve of her first Transcendence, she stands with the other Acolytes of her coven on the outskirts of its courtyard. A single banner hangs over the eastern wall. It bears the mark of her coven, a desert crow, and billows just above a raised dais, where the assembly focuses.\n\nLumessa grinds her teeth as she listens to Quine sermonizing. She pulls at strands of her pale-blonde hair while the Messenger rambles on about the horrors of the Everwar and the exodus of the gods, which had brought the first Speakers of Light and Dark together. She grinds the heel of her pointed boot into the loose grains of sand that have blown across the courtyard as Quine praises the peace in Aurfell, and touts the prophecy of the sun.\n\nBut Lumessa is careful with her display, because the Shepherds are always watching. So, it is with a hushed voice that she whispers to the thin girl standing next to her, “We must do this every year?”\n\nSavantha firms her lips, then raises four fingers together and holds them over her eyes. Lumessa’s unwilling partner does not care for her manner. They are not friends, but they are bound. The duality of the House is everywhere—a symbol of the House’s devotion to the prophecy—and every Acolyte is paired with another, meant to walk the path together. *When the twins are one again*… the first words of the sun.\n\nLumessa sighs, perhaps too loudly. A Shepherd cocks a head in her direction and clucks her tongue. It is Shepherd Mara. She is an ugly woman, and stern. The folds of her skin have been cracked by time, but her eyes are sharp. Beads of blood still spot Lumessa’s skin from her last encounter with Mara, and Lumessa’s back aches from where the lashes of a whip have landed too often. She pulls her shoulders back and lifts her chin, but she quiets nonetheless.\n\nThe Messenger finishes his address with a rare prayer to the moons. He looks at the gathered Acolytes, expectation on his face, but there is no applause—not until several Shepherds silently encourage their flock with stern glances and clenched fists. After Quine descends the dais to a smattering of claps, he hurries to a woman who has emerged from the shadows under the fluttering banner. Several figures appear around her. Lumessa peers at them, but settles her gaze on the woman. She is different. She is tall and regal, and her pale face is framed by shoulder-length brown hair that curls around her angled features. There is no triangle on her chest—instead, there is a sphere with swirls inside. The woman is a mage.\n\nLumessa may not believe in gods and fairy tales, but she very much believes in magic—she’s seen it, long ago, and the smell of burning flesh still visits her dreams.\n\n*But why is this mage-woman here*, Lumessa wonders? There is no magic in Lumessa’s coven. It is a simple place, and its Acolytes are destined for labour and menial work. The mark of the desert crow is well known in Aurfell for the toil of its fledgling alumnus. She doubts her coven has produced so much as a Shepherd.\n\nThe woman and Quine seem to be arguing, though the Messenger quickly bows his head and totters away. After he is gone, the mage-woman and her cohort approach the dais. She climbs alone, her steps slow and steady, no sway in her arms, and her posture tight.\n\nWhen she reaches the podium, she rests her hands on each side and stares into a crowd that has gone silent. The quiet lingers, but, before long, nerves get the better of the young boys and girls of the Desert Crows, and their voices begin to creak in confusion. The Shepherds threaten with their presence but do nothing, perhaps equally unsure.\n\nAt last, the mage-woman raises her hand to the onlookers, and, like an unspoken command, the Acolytes quiet in an instant. When the night stills but for the flapping of silk and rustling of sand, the woman speaks.\n\n“Acolytes, my name is Huri. I am the Inquisitor of Darkness.”\n\nLike a crack of thunder, gasps and muted cries ripple among the throng, and the sounds coalesce into a rumble of confusion and awe. Even Lumessa is shocked. There are only two Inquisitors in Aurfell—one light, one dark—and they are the heads of the paths of magic, second only to the Speakers. *Perhaps*, thinks Lumessa, *they are equal*.\n\nInquisitor Huri is not swayed by her reception. Her face is void of expression, and she does not move. Lumessa has never encountered such a powerful figure. The Shepherds may lash their whips, but Lumessa does not fear them. Pain fades, and blood clots. But standing on the dais is a statue, a keeper of the secrets of magic, and an aura of strength drifts through the air. Lumessa finds herself biting her lip and tensing her muscles.\n\nThe Inquisitor speaks again.\n\n“Sons and Daughters of the Dark. Blessed is the Transcendence. Blessed is the union of the two moons and their followers. Blessed in the House, and the peace.”\n\n“*Blessed be!*” comes the response from the Acolytes, in harmony. Lumessa does not think the Shepherds will notice her lack of participation, though Savantha casts her another sharp glance before raising four fingers over her eyes.\n\n“You must find it strange for me to come here,” continues Huri. Her voice is steel. “Your coven is on the edge of the city; your graduates are decent, and hard-working, but not much more. The desert crow is not a symbol found within the Speaker’s Hall, to be sure.”\n\nLumessa stifles a laugh. She knows he Shepherds will bristle, as will the more delusional Acolytes. She warms at the look of horror on Savantha’s face, which shifts quickly to stone when she catches Lumessa staring.\n\n“Yet I am here. I will be put this simply, as is my way: I am searching.”\n\nMurmurs escape the Shepherd’s control, and Lumessa whistles. Savantha flares another look and covers her eyes again, again wishing blindness upon her counterpart.\n\n“That which I seek is beyond your understanding. I will say this, and only this: magic has gone too long without new blood. We have neglected our responsibility to nurture the gods’ gift.”\n\nThe Inquisitor’s voice echoes through the courtyard and lingers in the evening air. Breath unfurls from her lips. Already, the chill begins to set. It will only grow colder.\n\nThe Acolytes do not make noise. They are now hanging off of the Inquisitor’s words. No one knows much about magic, or those who practice it, and the Shepherds discourage gossip. It is not taught in the coven, though whispers seep into open ears like water through cracks in stone. Still, the desert crows are ill prepared to be visited by a mage—the Inquisitor, no less.\n\nLumessa thinks the words are carefully chosen, and her mind races as she tries to understand. She is now as silent as Savantha, and as the others gathered in the courtyard, finally captured in the moment.\n\n“In the coming days,” says Huri, “my mages will visit covens like yours all over this side of Aurfell. I know you’ve not before had the pleasure to keep company with my kin, but I urge you to welcome them, for they are of the Dark, too.”\n\nAn urgency lurks within the Inquisitor’s words. Lumessa hears it. She wonders if others will have as well. The murmurs grow again.\n\n“Prepare yourselves, Acolytes.” Huri is playing with the crowd. Lumessa is enthralled with the speech, but her anticipation fades at the Inquisitor’s next words: “I will find what I seek!” Huri speaks with sudden violence, her steady voice now a rasp, and she pounds a fist on the dais. The air ripples around the point of impact, and a wisp of shadow emerges and begins to coil around the Inquisitor. The shadow is amorphous, without form, yet it moves with purpose, finally settling in a hover over the woman’s shoulders. Two spots are glowing, faintly, from where a head might be, but Lumessa can’t be sure. Her fixation is shattered when the Inquisitor abruptly rips off her ceremonial clothing and stands naked in the cold.\n\nLumessa becomes suddenly aware of the panic surging through the desert crows. Even the Shepherds are mesmerized. Huri stares back into the crowd, shadow on her shoulders, and Lumessa squirms. The woman is frightening, and her intensity cannot be ignored.\n\n“Bring me proper clothes,” Huri demands. A snivelling Quine breaks free from the cohort of mages who stand in the shadows, then rushes over with silk as black as night, his face blanched and eyes wide. *This was not planned*, thinks Lumessa.\n\nThe Inquisitor pulls on the garments, which now include a flowing robe. “Better,” she says. Her voice has regained its calm, as if her display had been ordinary. The wisps of shadow—blackness darker than the night itself, as if a void in the world that eats the light—disappears.\n\n*She flaunts the union on the eve of the Transcendence*, thinks Lumessa.\n\nThe Shepherds are now standing with their mouths hanging open, and they seem oblivious to the growing cacophony in the rows of Acolytes: questions, cries…cheers? Lumessa bites her lip, her discomfort growing.\n\nHuri speaks again, and is calm once more. ”Blessed be the Darkness. Blessed be the desert crows.”\n\n“*Blessed be!*” comes the answer, though less unified than before. Huri abruptly leaves the dais and strides off, becoming invisible almost immediately as her silk blends with the night.\n\nShepherd Mara cracks a whip on the stone of the courtyard, and several Acolytes jump in time to the puff of sand that is raised. Instinctively, the desert crows filter into lines and began a shuffle into the coven. Before she joins, Lumessa peers up into the sky and sees the last flickering of a blue ring as the eclipse begins.\n\n[crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://0x5f02e4DFDfEbE15D3C09FEbA7689f0f01BF626b0?features=overview,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633475775, "digest": "D9DRbZhW4lRyuGGaTN-SmmHLKXB8PUqnn1fn8ATaGeg", "contributor": "0x9A048A7BF38306c055C05606A6010C78CFc7C1E8"}

Other Soldiers and Lieutenants came and went, but I hardly noticed.\n\n“Yeah,” I muttered as I stared at my empty plate.\n\n“What about last night?” Benjamin said after swallowing a mountain of scrambled eggs. “Did Roderick have you on cleaning duty, after all?”\n\nI shook my head. “He had me watch over Kara.”\n\n“Bogg’s daughter?” Aiden asked. “Why you?”\n\n“Apparently, she picked me.”\n\n“Okay,” Aiden said. She sounded concerned. “Well, do you—”\n\nI turned to her sharply. “Look, I don’t want to talk about it. Okay? I’m sorry. Not now.”\n\n“Maybe when we’re back in Torque City, you’ll tell us about it,” Benjamin said, and I could hear the grin on his face. “I’m dying to know what that mess was like.”\n\n“Yeah. Maybe.”\n\n“We’re all meeting with our Lieutenants today at noon,” Aiden said. “I’m guessing they’ll tell us to head back soon, now that the banquet is finished.”\n\nI shot to my feet and headed over to the drinks station, where I poured myself a quarter-full glass of water.\n\nMy hand shook as I brought the drink to my mouth.\n\nI stood there for a solid minute, staring idly out the window on the far side of the room. It looked to be another sunny, autumn day in the Capital. I saw a woman walking with several little kids, all with an innocent, cheerful demeanor. They were probably headed to some apprenticeship, where the children would learn about the occupation of their choosing. In every other city in Polygon, I’d be able to make a rough guess at what that occupation might be—I could have at least whittled it down to a Sector. But the Capital had its own layout, and I had never taken the time to memorize its map.\n\n“Wyatt.”\n\nI turned to see Lieutenant Roderick, dressed in casual Military gear: a jacket, a solid undershirt, and baggy, unadorned pants. His jacket was striped in the deep blue and marble white that were Polygon’s official colors, while his pants and undershirt were plain black. His hawkish face was taut with something between sleeplessness and a grave severity I’d never seen on him before.\n\nNext to my commander stood a tall, athletic woman in her fifties, dressed similarly to Roderick. I’d never spoken to her before, but I knew that she was Roderick’s boss: Captain Maura. Her cheekbones were sharp enough to cut metal, and her short, graying hair hung down to just above her left shoulder. Her small eyes matched her stern expression, and they fell on me with a kind of patient pressure, like a predator confident enough to take the day off from hunting. Worse, her eyes’ dark brown irises were decorated with flecks of silver. The three stars on her jacket, paired with her authoritative stance, only served to intimidate me further.\n\nI felt underdressed in my gray t-shirt and old, faded gray sweatpants.\n\n“Sir,” I said as casually as I could. I put a hand out to Maura. “You’re Captain Maura. It’s an honor to meet you.”\n\nAs the Captain shook my hand, she looked at me the way one might stare with terrified fascination at a sleeping beast of the jungle. “Roderick tells me you were with Kara last night,” she said quietly.\n\n“Yes, ma’am,” I replied, mirroring her low voice.\n\nShe continued to stare at me, hard, and I struggled to retain eye contact. “Is there anything you want to tell us?”\n\n“She was goading me all night,” I answered without missing a beat. “I think she knew I was adopted, somehow. It was eerie. And…she was hostile.”\n\n“Walk us through your night,” Roderick said. “After I last saw you, where’d you go?”\n\nI put my hands behind my back. I didn’t want them to see that they were shaking.\n\n“I went to Kara’s hotel, like you told me to. She met me in the lobby, and we walked to *No Rules*.”\n\n“Did anything unusual happen on your way there, or maybe in the bar?” Roderick asked. I saw Maura glance at him before returning her iron gaze back at me.\n\n“There was a man in a hood at the bar,” I said. “I couldn’t see his face or anything.”\n\n“That’s good, Wyatt,” Roderick said. He almost sounded…relieved?\n\n“Think hard,” Maura said, ignoring my Lieutenant’s interjection. “What else happened at the bar?”\n\nI scratched my head, scrolling through my memories. Then I realized what she was hinting at. “She mentioned my mother by name. I…I grabbed her coat. But I let go. I didn’t hurt her.”\n\n“We know,” Maura said. “What about after the bar?”\n\n“I walked Kara back to her hotel.”\n\n“Give me more than that,” she snapped acerbically.\n\nI looked past Maura towards my friends, who I knew would be watching the three of us.\n\n*I’m sorry.*\n\n“She invited me up to her room,” I whispered. “And I attacked her. I more than grabbed her by the coat.”\n\n“Because she threatened you?” Roderick asked.\n\n“Like I said, she was dropping passive-aggressive hints about me and my family all night. About things she has no business knowing.”\n\n“Be specific,” Maura commanded. “Tell us what you did.”\n\nMy vision blurred, but I swallowed my growing anxiety. “I…I took her by the throat.” I turned away from Maura’s unrelenting eyes. “I told her that I’d kill her if she came near me or my family. And then I left.” I couldn’t stop a humiliating tear from falling to the wooden floor. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”\n\n“You left,” Maura muttered suspiciously. “And you returned here?”\n\n“Yes,” I answered while I wiped my cheek. I looked to Roderick. “Hey, what’s going on?”\n\nRoderick opened his mouth, but Maura raised a placating hand without so much as looking his way. “Did you speak with anyone else at Kara’s hotel?” she asked.\n\nI shook my head. “Someone let us in, but I didn’t speak to her. I didn’t pay much attention after we entered the hotel, but there was staff around.”\n\nMaura nodded very slightly. “You need to come with us. Now.”\n\nI tried to gesture to my friends, but Maura grabbed me by the bicep and practically dragged me out of the hotel.\n\n“Captain, he won’t run away,” Roderick said as we began walking the streets of the Capital. “I know him.”\n\n“Neither you nor I know what he’s capable of,” Maura retorted, and she tightened her grip on me.\n\nThe three of us walked as hastily as we could along the busy sidewalk. In the morning sun, I took in the massive, stony buildings on both sides of the road. I remembered Kara’s complaint that they were too bland and angular. She was right about their style—every building was made of off-white stone, stacked in such a way that although the the stones themselves were sturdy, cylindrical, horizontal columns, they nevertheless shaped the building into a perfect rectangular prism in the aggregate. Even the roofs were flat, composed of those same round stones. Flagpoles extended from half of the windowsills, carrying the blue-and-white banner of Polygon. Each building’s foundation rested on an individuated metallic platform that extended a few feet around its perimeter, gradually tapering off until it melded with its surroundings. From a few lucky angles, I could see a circular divot in some of the buildings’ roofs, within which three narrow lines of indentation formed an equilateral triangle whose ends didn’t quite connect.\n\nAfter a few blocks, I knew we were headed to Kara’s hotel.\n\n*Don’t panic. Don’t speak.*\n\nAs we neared the hotel, I noticed that the sidewalk was becoming sparser with citizens. And everyone we did pass looked…distressed.\n\nA faint but nasty scent hit my nostrils, like raw meat drenched in shit. I looked to Maura, but she either didn’t pick up on it or chose not to react.\n\nIt only grew stronger and more putrid as we came closer to the hotel. By the time we reached the block of the hotel, it had evolved from a mere background smell to one that I could nearly taste on my tongue.\n\nThere were no civilians on the hotel’s block. I saw dozens of Military men and woman, mostly in groups of three or four, standing cross-armed and sober. As we walked past them towards the hotel, we received several curious stares.\n\nOr maybe \\*I \\*did.\n\nThe sidewalk and street grew more and more dense with Military as we neared the hotel. By the time we were two buildings away, Maura stopped in her tracks and put a hand on Roderick’s shoulder. “Go tell them that we have the suspect and come back.”\n\nRoderick nodded, gave me a smile that tried to be encouraging, and headed onwards.\n\nI saw the defeat in his eyes.\n\nMaura’s grip on my bicep tightened further.\n\nI don’t know how much time went by before Roderick returned. His valiant attempts at comforting me were gone from his expression, replaced by airtight professionalism.\n\nThe rational part of my mind had put the pieces together, but I couldn’t allow the thoughts to congeal into sentences.\n\n“They’re ready,” he said to Maura.\n\nMilitary personnel cleared the way as the Captain pulled me towards the hotel. The smell was nauseating by now.\n\nThe sidewalk area before the hotel was blocked from view as a handful of older Military men stood in the way. As the three of us approached them, they turned and looked at me. I had never seen them before, but my guess was they weren’t always so pale.\n\nThey walked towards us in such a way as to form a semicircle, which was creepy enough. But in doing so, I saw what had been occupying them.\n\nI was lucky that I’d barely eaten that morning.\n\nSprawled on the sidewalk was a headless, feminine body. Dried blood stained her wool coat, which continued to light up in fluorescent colors as they had when its owner was alive. Her entire neck was clean gone, leaving a gaping hole that was, thankfully, partly covered by her large coat. Even so, I glimpsed with dark curiosity.\n\nI dry heaved and turned my face away. Her insides looked no different from those of Creatures that we’d occasionally had to split open, out in the Wildlands. And yet, much as I distrusted Wolves, I had to admit that seeing the lifeless, literally open carcass of someone who could talk was far more unsettling. Someone—granted, not a Human—was suddenly no different from a dead animal.\n\nI heard a scream of primal pain coming from where Kara’s body laid. I looked back, and in my shock, I hadn’t even registered Bogg. He was on his knees with his hairy hands holding Kara’s feet.\n\n“The woman who was guarding the hotel’s front door is dead, too,” Maura said quietly in my ear. I instinctively pulled my arm away from her grip at the increasing hostility in her voice, but she was strong. “As are the concierge and another worker who worked last night’s shift.”\n\n“Didn’t do this,” I fumbled, staring mindlessly at the sky. It was more comforting than the hell that was closing in on me.\n\n“All three were found in the hotel with their skulls cracked open.”\n\nImagined, ghastly visuals painted what had been a serene, cloudless sky. I turned to Maura and opened my mouth, but no words came out.\n\n“Witnesses at \\*No Rules \\*have confirmed that you had your hammer with you,” Maura said flatly. “And I’ve already told you that your physical aggression against Kara was seen by numerous patrons.”\n\nThe semicircle of Military men closed in on me. They looked very large.\n\nOr maybe I just felt small.\n\nFinally, Maura released me. She took Roderick’s side to my right and said, loudly against the wails of a grieving father, “The Humans you murdered had families. And Kara was an official guest of the Assembly. \\*The Principles of Earth and Blood \\*is clear. You have violated Law number eight-hundred-and-sixty-two of the Second Book, the punishment for which is five days of confinement, followed by execution.”\n\nOne of the men took my limp wrists. My eyes were on Maura, but I felt the cold, biting steel as the man bound my hands. I felt a tug by my waist, and I turned to find the man unhooking my hammer from my belt. I wanted to resist, to say something, anything.\n\nBut I was frozen.\n\n“And according to Law number fifty-five, you are hereby discharged from the Military. None of your accomplishments as such will ever be recorded again, and any such records that are found are to be erased.”\n\nThe man ripped the star pin off of my shirt.\n\nThe scene was silent. The men looked at me with vacant, ghostly eyes. Maura’s expression remained implacable, the incarnation of the legal order itself, mechanically fulfilling its duty as a lion protected its pack.\n\n“Bogg,” Maura called. “We have him. If you have anything to say to him before his imprisonment, now is the time.”\n\nThe Wolf was a far cry from the confident businessman who delivered a speech just yesterday. His dress was similarly opulent, but his face was…utterly broken. He shook as he took small steps towards me. Face-to-face, his eyes were so bloodshot I would have thought he was diseased if I hadn’t known the circumstances.\n\nHe spat in my face.\n\n“That’s enough,” Roderick protested.\n\nI wiped my face with my bound hands. “Trial,” I said. “I didn’t do any of this.”\n\n“There will be an investigation for the next five days,” Maura answered. “Only if another suspect emerges and seems more likely to have committed this homicide will there be a trial. Even then, the trial must begin and end before your five days of confinement. If this span passes without any of these contingencies, you will die the same way you killed our guest.”\n\nI swallowed at that.\n\n“Roderick, take him to the First Prison. Use the Train.”\n\nI was waiting for Maura to give me some kind of comfort, some assuring words that this would all be sorted out. That I was a Soldier, one of her ranks, a defender of Humanity. That she knew I hadn’t murdered two Humans and decapitated our guest of honor.\n\nThat I wasn’t a snake in the grass, freshly exposed and to be crushed on sight.\n\nRoderick beckoned for me to follow him. As I passed Maura, I whispered, “Tell me you don’t think I did it. Tell me I’m not being sentenced to death.”\n\n“The Law does not compromise,” she said, her voice granite.\n\nA flash of anger erupted inside of me, temporarily subduing the storm of confusion and fear wreaking havoc in my mind. “This is bullshit,” I spat.\n\n“Roderick,” Maura said, her eyes on me, “take this child to his destination.”\n\n“Come on, Wyatt,” my Lieutenant said calmly to me.\n\nAfter several minutes of walking in silence, Roderick said, “The First Prison is expecting you. I’ll be with you until you get there.”\n\nI looked to my commander. “And then what?”\n\n“Like Maura says. Confinement.”\n\n“So that’s it? Toss me in a cell, chop my fucking head off?”\n\nRoderick clenched his jaw. “Maura and I were at \\*No Rules \\*for hours this morning. They were missing a knife, Wyatt.”\n\n“Sir, come on! You know me. Tell me you know it isn’t true.”\n\nHe smiled at me, but gone was the pride in me that I’d seen on his face so many times before. “It doesn’t matter what I think, Wyatt. The first attempted deal with the Wolves in a generation, and a Wolf ends up murdered? That’s enough for a war between our races. This fiasco is bigger than you, kid.”\n\n“Someone’s framing me!” I cried. “I’d never kill a Human. And I already told you, Kara knew things about me. Something is going on.”\n\n“Maybe. Or maybe you’re lying about what Kara said to you.”\n\nRoderick’s words hit me like an icicle through the chest. “You mean that?”\n\n“I don’t know. I’m just tracking the possibilities. Look, there’s still time for you.”\n\n“Five days,” I muttered. “I’ve got no shot. Hey. That asshole in the hood. He’s gotta be connected, somehow.”\n\n“We didn’t know about that until you mentioned it,” Roderick admitted optimistically. “I’ll make sure to follow up on that.”\n\n“Today. *Sir*.”\n\nRoderick snorted mirthlessly. “Guess I’d be impatient if I was in your shoes, too. Yeah, today.”\n\n“Don’t bring Maura. She hates me.”\n\nRoderick shook his head. “First of all, control yourself. Don’t command me.”\n\n“I’m not your Soldier anymore,” I spat. “Remember?”\n\n“Goddammit, Wyatt. I’m trying to offer you a hand, here. Don’t make it so hard. Besides, Maura doesn’t hate you. I’ve told her about you before.”\n\nI would’ve beamed at that on any other day. “I couldn’t tell.”\n\n“Yeah, she can be intense. Closed off. But she’s a damn good Captain. I’ve seen her fight. It’s…something else.”\n\nI remembered the speckles in her eyes. “I didn’t know she had a godlet.”\n\n“One of the most powerful I’ve ever seen. Sharp as hell, too. She knows what the political fallout from Kara’s death could be. She has an ear to the Assembly.”\n\n“So, what, consign me to die?”\n\n“Not her call. An Assemblyman decided earlier today, after he debriefed him.”\n\n“Which one?”\n\n“Does it matter?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\nRoderick shook his head again as he glanced at the chains around my wrists. “Stop thinking with your heart, Wyatt. If you’re going to survive, you need to wise up. Ignore what doesn’t matter. Focus on what does. Got it?”\n\nI felt a pang of relief for the first time all day. Roderick was still in my corner. “I’m sorry,” I said for the billionth time today. “I shouldn’t have disrespected you, Sir.”\n\n“Don’t mention it. Priorities, remember?”\n\n“Right.”\n\nWe approached the busy Train station. Citizens were packed onto an outdoor platform below which several lines of track extended in both directions as far as I could see. Roderick took out a coin and inserted it into the slot of a metallic box at the front of the platform while uttering, “First Prison” into it. The machine repeated his words in an electronic, monotonous voice, and the screen on the box morphed from bright red to light blue.\n\n“Your family will receive a letter soon,” Roderick whispered to me\n\n“This will devastate them,” I said quietly. My hands closed into fists. “Goddammit…” My eyes welled up again, but I heeded Roderick’s advice. “Sir, I know I’m not in a position to ask for anything, but could you tell Aiden and Benjamin what’s going on?”\n\n“I imagine word will spread quickly, but sure, I’ll find them if they’re not already out of the Capital.”\n\n*If Aiden’s already gone, I’m finished.*\n\nA bellowing roar indicated that the Train was approaching.\n\nRoderick kept a delicate hand on my back as we walked forward.\n\nThe First Prison held the worst criminals in Polygon, those violators of \\*The Principles of Earth and Blood \\*who the Assembly itself declared as enemies of Humanity.\n\nAnd soon enough, me.\n\n[crowdfund://0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC?features=](crowdfund://0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC?features=)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633476955, "digest": "p4vlFeLi1uBb3kQk9dUoJCXdB07stcPzuC0vXdPeTmA", "contributor": "0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC"}
{"id": "FGy3EXdmh1WIwp3W8pCCxoTkb11Nd0PuWow3_3Iy_lI", "title": "Windfall: Chapter Two", "body": "**Chapter Two**\n\nI shouldn’t have been surprised that Kara was late.\n\nBy the time she came down, I’d been standing in the hotel lobby for at least half an hour, according to the massive clock above the concierge’s desk.\n\nThe Wolf walked towards me with the self-assuredness of someone far older than she was. On her tiny frame, it creeped me out, but I held my poker face. At least Kara decided to ditch her vomit-stained clothes from earlier. Now, she wore a wool coat that was at least a size too big. This time, her clothes didn’t wiggle on their own, but irregular splotches of colors grew and faded at seemingly random spots, like living inkblots striving to reach the surface of her coat.\n\nI put a hand out. “I’m Wyatt.”\n\nKara’s storm-cloud gray eyes darted wildly above her sunken cheeks, scanning me erratically. “Of course you are.” Her voice was high and scratchy, but she spoke with a confidence that matched her gait.\n\nI took a breath in. *Is she even sober? Doesn’t matter, don’t ask.* “Shall we?”\n\nKara giggled. “No small talk, my knight?”\n\n“\\*No Rules \\*isn’t far. Come on.”\n\nI turned and headed towards the door without looking back.\n\n“Such a hurry!” she cried as she caught up me. “The night is young, Wyatt. So much playtime.”\n\n\\*Ignore her, \\*I thought to myself as we hit the road. *No one ever got in trouble for keeping their mouth shut.*\n\n“Your roads, at least, have style,” Kara noted.\n\nI instinctively looked down as we walked on the sidewalk. Like all roads and sidewalks in Polygon, it was crystalline and translucent, allowing travelers to see the dense network of metallic pipes that connected all buildings and other structures together. Points of light shone at regular intervals along the pipes, lighting the streets on which we walked.\n\n“Unlike the rest of this dreary city,” the Wolf continued. “Too much stone. Too many angles. Too little for the eyes to feast upon.”\n\n*A few hours of this, and I’m home free.*\n\n“Tell me, Wyatt. Who do you think put those there?”\n\nI followed Kara’s fingers, which were pointing toward the sky. “What are you talking about?”\n\nShe laughed again. “The stars, of course.”\n\nI shrugged. “No idea.”\n\n“You’re not curious.”\n\n“Nope.”\n\n“Your mind is so dull for someone so young,” she teased. “The Great Builder did not create his gifts for you to dismiss so gratuitously. He and his lover placed the stars in the sky so that none of us would face a dreary, black canvass in the night.”\n\nI turned towards Kara. She was still staring at the sky, her nasty green hair hanging like the dead branches of an old tree. “We don’t have a Great Builder,” I quipped.\n\n“Oh, Wyatt, you don’t know much, do you?”\n\n“I know what I need to.”\n\nAs we turned a corner, she said, “And what’s that? You know how to swing your little weapon, there?”\n\nI suddenly felt a pressure by my waist as Kara darted towards me and put a hand on my hammer’s handle.\n\nI pulled away quite easily. Turned out her bark was far worse than her bite—she had the strength of, well, an underfed teenage girl. “What are you doing?” I hissed.\n\n“Are you always so stiff?” she said. “Or do you just do what you’re told, like a good boy?”\n\nI shook my head but said nothing the rest of the way. When Kara realized I wasn’t going to respond, she began whistling some melodramatic tune.\n\n*Keep your cool.*\n\nThree blocks and an eternity later, we arrived at the entrance of \\*No Rules. \\*Its exterior was a clear imitation of Palace Codex, with arched doors and a pair of marble statues of a man and a woman, both upright and nude and reading thick tomes. I heard music and idle chatter from above, and I looked up to see several floors’ worth of balconies, each peppered with impeccably dressed men and women.\n\nPersonally, I preferred a hole in the wall where the beer tasted like piss.\n\nTwo large men with stars on their black shirts stood before the glass doors. Military. As I approached them, I saw their eyes go to my own star, and they nodded with approval.\n\n“Hi,” I said assertively. “This is—”\n\n“We know,” the one on the left said. “We were told to expect the two of you.”\n\n“Wyatt, why don’t you introduce me to your handsome friends?” Kara asked as she intertwined her arm with mine.\n\nI quickly pulled away. “They know,” I muttered.\n\nThe two Military men glanced at each other, and I could tell they were holding in a laugh. “Enjoy your night,” said the one on the right.\n\nI felt my cheeks redden with humiliation.\n\n“What’s the matter, Wyatt boy?” Kara whispered in my ear as we walked through the doors. “You should’ve introduced me.”\n\n*Ignore her. She’s a drunk kid.*\n\nThe opening room was lit by dozens of little candles, dispersed across the tables and the bar. Hypnotic, wordless music came from every direction, too quiet to inhibit conversation but loud enough to prevent any awkward silences. Every surface I could see was dressed in fluffy, pink wool. Most tables were small, circular, and fit for two: most patrons of this part of \\*No Rules \\*were pairs of men and women engaged in a nightly dance of casual courtship. At the bar, I saw a handful of single men and women, mostly drinking alone.\n\nI pretended not to notice the uncomfortable or outright hostile glances Kara and I received when we walked in.\n\n“Hello, are you Wyatt?” a tall, older man in a tuxedo asked me. “My name is Grantham. I was told that you and a special guest would be visiting our quarters tonight.”\n\n“That’s me,” Kara said, and I saw more heads turn our way. “I’m Kara. You don’t look so good, Granty. What’s the matter? Is there something on my face?”\n\n“Em, no, ma’m,” Grantham said nervously. “May I take the two of you to your table? We have one reserved for you.”\n\n“That’d be great,” I said, doing my best to apologize through my expression. “Thank you.”\n\nMuch as I wasn’t exactly a fan of this place’s ambiance, I had to admit that the wooly stool made for a damn comfortable seat.\n\n“If you need anything, please find me,” Grantham said after he handed us drink menus.\n\nOnce he was out of earshot, Kara leaned close enough to me that her silky beard nearly tickled \\*my \\*chin. “Relax, Wyatt,” she whispered slowly. “Now the fun starts.”\n\nIt would’ve been more difficult to give this kid the silent treatment now than while we were walking, I realized. “Why did you want me to come out here with you?”\n\nShe sat back on her stool, still smiling arrogantly, madly. “We’ll get there.” She glanced at her menu for a moment before throwing it back down. “Why don’t you be a good little Soldier and fetch me a shot of whatever costs the most.”\n\n“I think a waiter will take your order once he comes back.”\n\nKara lifted a shaggy eyebrow. “You won’t be joining me?”\n\n“I’m on the clock.”\n\n“Then do what I say,” she said with heat. “And go buy me a drink.”\n\nI got up and stormed to the bar without another word.\n\n“What can I get you?” the bartender asked me.\n\nI pulled out one of the coins that Roderick had given me. “A shot of your most expensive drink.”\n\nHe took the coin and made with the bartending. Part of me wanted to look back at Kara, if only to make sure she hadn’t run off. But I just looked ahead, taking refuge in this brief moment without the Wolf.\n\n“That’s quite a lot of money for someone so…underdressed. And so young!”\n\nI turned to my left to see a blonde woman in a green, glittery dress. “Ah, it’s not mine. It’s for work.”\n\n“I see that,” she said, eyeing my star pin. “I saw you come in with that Wolf. A shame what the Ruler is willing to do, who he’s willing to work with.”\n\nI snorted. “Yeah. Well. I’m on watch duty tonight.”\n\nThe woman took the hint, but not without flashing me a tantalizing, hungry grin. “A shame. You’re cute.”\n\nI almost turned away from the woman, but I noticed a hooded figure sitting alone, at the corner of the bar.\n\n“Here you are,” I heard the bartender say. “One shot of our finest. And here’s your change.”\n\nI thanked him and took both. I nearly asked him how someone dressed like a burglar managed to get into *No Rules*, but I figured I had enough on my plate.\n\nTo my relief, Kara was still at our table when I returned. “Here you are.”\n\nShe swallowed the golden liquid as quickly as I’d placed it in front of her. The Wolf let out a brief but obnoxious howl.\n\nI sat quietly, tapping my foot in lieu of closing her windpipe permanently.\n\nKara put a fist below her chin and examined me with those manic eyes. The swirls of rainbow colors dancing on her coat only made her look more unstable. “What’s it like to always do what you’re told?”\n\n“I protect Humanity.” I shrugged. “Can’t think of a higher purpose than that.” \\*And what’s your purpose, you empty, childish Wolf? \\*I thought.\n\n“Is that what you do. And who do you serve?”\n\n“Humanity.”\n\nKara laughed mockingly. “You really are a cute little cog. Who gives you your orders?”\n\nI frowned. “My Lieutenant.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah. Up the chain-of-command. Who do you *serve*, boy?”\n\n\\*I’m older than you, bitch. \\*“The Ruler.”\n\n“Mhm. Your tyrant. The one who doesn’t let you trade with other races without his permission. I don’t know much about you Humans, but I’ve learned that much from my father. That right?”\n\n“Tyrant? No.”\n\nKara licked her gums, and I saw with horror where her fangs exited her gums. “Barbaric is what I call it.”\n\n“The Ruler and his Assembly keep order, maintain peace throughout Polygon,” I answered defensively. “Without them, we’d be nothing. And without the Military that they fund, we’d be overrun by Creatures.”\n\n“I feel bad for you, Wyatt. The Great Builder has provided us—all of us—with so many gifts, yet you enslave yourself to another. Pathetic.”\n\n“I told you already,” I said with force. “We don’t have a ‘Great Builder’, whoever that is.”\n\nFor the first time, I saw sincerity in Kara’s eyes. “Not ‘*a* Great Builder’, sweet Solider. \\*The \\*Great Builder, Deliverer of Order, Constructor of Life, Builder of the Playground.”\n\n“Sounds like an impressive guy. Where’s he now?”\n\nKara shook her head. “Your eyes are closed, Soldier. Your mind is not your own, chained as it is to your Ruler. If you pray to Him, he answers. Listen carefully, and you can hear Him in the whispers of the wind. Look closely, and you can see him in the twinkle of the stars.” Her smile widened. “Love passionately, and you can feel Him in your blood.”\n\nKara sounded like she was quoting words that weren’t hers. “You keep telling me I’m just someone’s lapdog. But you’re the one talking nonsense. The Ruler is real. The Assembly is real.” I pointed to my star pin. “The Military’s real. Can you say the same about this Builder guy?”\n\n“There’s nothing real about your Ruler. You’re a slave. And you always will be.”\n\n“What about your Ruler?” I snapped angrily.\n\nKara laughed again. “We have leaders, not rulers.”\n\n“Are you going to keep playing games with me all night?” I pointed a finger in the girl’s face. “What do you want with me?”\n\nKara clicked her tongue mockingly and put her hands up. “So rude, Wyatt! Carol would be disappointed.”\n\nI grabbed her coat without thinking and pulled her scrawny frame towards me. “How do you know my mom’s name?”\n\n“Ah, there you are,” she whispered, and I could smell her alcohol-ridden breath. “Let me go, Wyatt. You never know who’s watching. Wouldn’t want to get you into trouble now.”\n\nI did, and I recomposed myself, tapping my foot faster than before. The rest of the bar scene melted away from my vision. All I could see was this drunken Wolf’s hairy face.\n\nAn annoying job, I could handle. But this was not that. Not anymore.\n\nThis bitch was threatening my family.\n\n“Oh Wyatt,” she continued, “you really ought to get a handle on that temper. Anger’s a bad look on you.”\n\n“We’re done here,” I said flatly, and rose to my feet. “I’m taking you back to your hotel.”\n\nKara rolled her eyes. “Sit down, Soldier. You were ordered to watch over me, right? Now, do as you were told.”\n\nMy legs wouldn’t move. My mouth opened and closed.\n\nI didn’t know what to do.\n\n“I wonder,” Kara purred, “if sweet little Amanda shares your aggression. I mean, she \\*is \\*your sister, after all. Or is she?”\n\nI was a caged beast, furious and helpless. I was frozen as petrified lava, eager to burn red and devour the enemy before me.\n\n“I still haven’t given you my gift, Wyatt. And you’re not looking so hot. Why don’t you take me back to my hotel?”\n\nI didn’t look back at her. I walked out of \\*No Rules \\*and assumed she followed.\n\nNo words were spoken during our trip back to her hotel. I would’ve been surprised at Kara’s reticence, but I was still overcome with fear, rage, and confusion.\n\n“Come up to my room,” Kara said as we approached the hotel.\n\nA young Military woman opened the front doors for us.\n\n“I don’t think so,” I muttered, still avoiding Kara’s eyes. “My job’s done.”\n\nAs I began to walk away, I heard her stupid, insane giggling from behind me. “No, it’s not. There were witnesses at the bar. You assaulted me. My dad’s meeting with your Assemblymen tomorrow to finalize their deal. You think your holy bosses would sacrifice this deal just to keep *you*? You’re nothing, Wyatt. Unimpressive. A lifeless cog in this machine you call Polygon. And of course, so very *alone*.”\n\nMy hands turned to fists. She knew so much. It terrified me.\n\nAnd the bitch had me.\n\nI turned around and silently followed her into the hotel lobby. Maybe the staff waved to us as we headed towards the elevators. I couldn’t focus on anything but the teenager leading me.\n\n“I’m on the top floor,” she said merrily as we entered the elevator. “Got my own room, where I can really let loose. It’s been a long day. Traveling is so stressful. Don’t you ever just want to just lose yourself?”\n\nHer room was the last in a long hallway. Kara took out a golden key from the pouch of her coat and unlocked her door. “After you,” she said.\n\nKara’s room was a mess. Broken bottles littered the wooden floor, and I saw more than one unseemly powder on top of her dresser. It smelled of alcohol and some kind of burn that I couldn’t place. As I followed her into the bedroom, I past a shattered sliding door that revealed a very unused bathroom.\n\nI stared at Kara’s bed as I heard her open a drawer. “Here you are, W—”\n\nI snapped my head, finally looking at Kara. Before she could come towards me, I took two strident steps in her direction and grabbed her skinny neck with both hands. Her whiskery beard proved no resistance to the pressure of my thumbs against her windpipe.\n\n“Come near my mother, my father, or my sister, and I will show you what this lonely Soldier has learned to do with a hammer,” I whispered, fire clipping my words. “If I so much as hear that you’ve been tiptoeing near them, I will end you.” I dragged her by the neck until she was pinned against her dresser. “I don’t care if you’re back in your home territory. I will find you and slaughter you like the animal that you are.”\n\nHer feet flailed helplessly in the air as I unconsciously lifted her above the ground. I didn’t stop squeezing. The bags under her eyes began to take on a purple hue.\n\nKara’s left hand tried to push me away to no avail. Then she raised her right hand, and I glanced at the envelope between her shaking fingers. My name was written on its front.\n\nA faint, distant sense of curiosity managed to penetrated through my more immediate ferocity. As it did, I knew that I had to release this thing. I let go of Kara’s neck, and she fell to the floor in a fit of coughs and confused cries.\n\nI picked up the envelope that she had dropped. Her handwriting was sloppy and lazy, but my name was definitely written on it.\n\nI looked down at Kara. She was struggling unsuccessfully to rise to her feet, surrounded by broken glass and stale puddles of alcohol. I’d honestly expected more wiseassery, but apparently I’d found the one way to shut her up.\n\nI left her hotel room to the sound of the Wolf’s suffering.\n\nI didn’t open the envelope immediately. I needed some time to gather myself.\n\nI ended up wandering the streets of the Capital aimlessly in a timeless haze. I had no idea when I finally reached the entrance of the hotel we Soldiers had been set up in. Still half a block away, I saw someone on guard at the top of the stairs that led to the hotel’s entrance.\n\nWhatever was in this envelope, I figured it would be smart to open it privately.\n\nI glanced behind both shoulders to make sure I was alone, and then took Kara’s gift out from my pocket.

{"id": "z3ijKn4t3v9tj8_JkDa2JQdDQIhHEnkhiE2I4kRJfYs", "title": "Windfall: Chapter One", "body": "Chapter One\n\n*Six days earlier…*\n\n“You gonna eat that?”\n\nI looked up at Benjamin, who was staring eagerly at the untouched turkey leg on my plate. “Go for it, champ.”\n\nHe grabbed it with his bare hands and gnawed on the leg like a starved vulture. “God, that’s disgusting,” I muttered.\n\n“You really should slow down and learn some etiquette,” Aiden said, who was sitting to Benjamin’s right. “We’re lucky to be at such a formal occasion.”\n\nBenjamin tried speaking with his mouth full, but I interrupted. “Don’t, dude. You start spitting across the table, and they’ll definitely kick us out.”\n\nThe brute rolled his eyes but obliged. I shared a look with Aiden, and we shook our heads in unison.\n\nThe three of us sat at a roundtable by the hall’s back wall, having chosen one of the dozen or so that had been assigned to Soldiers. Some other rookies sat alongside us, but I think Benjamin’s savagery kept them from chatting us up.\n\nI scanned the room and guessed that there were around two-hundred people enjoying the buffet. Military members were easy to pick out, since they wore star-shaped pins on their otherwise formal attire. We were told not to wear our combat gear for the banquet, but that we were encouraged to bring a weapon or two.\n\nMy naked sledgehammer dangled from my belt.\n\n“I recognize some of the Philosophers here,” Aiden said. She nodded towards a table several rows closer to the room’s dais than we were. “See them? They write about the nature of laws.”\n\nI looked over at Aiden. She was pale, skinny, and her white-blonde hair somehow reminded me of dying grass. “Why would they be invited to this?”\n\nAiden smiled, her green eyes darting excitedly. “The Wolves make things that Humans could never dream to. I’m sure they’re interested.”\n\nI shrugged my shoulders so that my jacket fell back into place. It was a little big for me, but Mom tried her best. I hated dressing like this. If I wanted to dress up for work, I would’ve joined the ranks of Commerce. “Yeah, well, all that thinking won’t help if the Wolves decide the buffet isn’t cutting it.”\n\nBenjamin let loose a thunderous burp, which earned looks of horror by the other rookies at the table. “I’m with Wyatt. You can’t trust an animal.”\n\n“Didn’t some horde of Wolves try to raid Polygon just last week?” I added.\n\n“Yeah,” Aiden said diffidently, “but those were from the Wildlands. This is different.”\n\n“Uh-huh,” Benjamin muttered. “Don’t see any Humans living in the Wildlands.” He tapped Aiden’s nose. “Don’t be naïve, sweetie. It’ll get you killed.”\n\nAiden grabbed Benjamin’s finger and tossed it away. “Not all problems can be solved with a gun. Read a book, ogre.”\n\n“Books didn’t help me last month against those rhinos,” Benjamin retorted. “Wyatt was there, he’ll tell you. Wyatt?”\n\nI’d only been half-listening to my friends’ banter. My eyes were locked with a man walking towards our table. “What? Sure. Hey, I think Lieutenant Roderick is headed our way.”\n\nEveryone at the table straightened up at that, including me. I had more reason than the others—Roderick was \\*my \\*Lieutenant, my direct commander.\n\n“Hey,” he said when he reached me.\n\nI kept eye contact and prayed that I didn’t have food on the sides of my mouth. “Sir.”\n\n“Come find me after the ceremony. I have a job for you.”\n\nI suppressed the excitement and curiosity that threatened to leak through my face. “Yessir.”\n\nWith a nod, the strong-jawed Lieutenant walked away. The rest of the rookies at the table looked at me, but I ignored them. Once Roderick was out of earshot, I whispered to Benjamin and Aiden, “Guess I’m his favorite.”\n\nBenjamin snorted. “He probably wants you on cleaning duty.”\n\n“You don’t think an event like this is already covered by the Assembly?” I retorted. “No way. This’ll be something interesting.”\n\nThe background chatter of the room suddenly died. I looked towards the dais to see a bald, round man, dressed in an ocean-blue suit and white shirt, standing alone at its center. It was difficult to make out the pin on his jacket lapel, but I already knew what it was—a metallic square with three squiggly horizontal lines etched on its surface. The symbol of Humanity, of Polygon, of our leadership class.\n\nWe’d had the honor of meeting this man on our last day of training, when we were officially inaugurated into the Military. Clovis, the First Assemblyman, second in political authority only to the Ruler himself.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen!” Clovis said cheerfully into a small microphone that ran from his ear down to his mouth. “I thank you all for attending this most historic event. For thousands of years, we have lived our lives in Polygon as an isolated people. And we’ve been good at it. Our art flourishes.” He gestured at the right-hand wall, on which hung a large painting of hooded Philosophers buried in books. “Our men and women of Commerce ensure that our people’s needs are satisfied. Our Industry folk keep Polygon running without fail. And, of course, our Military keeps the peace, both within our walls and without them.”\n\n“He’s buttering up the crowd,” I muttered to my friends. “He knows working with Wolves is a tough sell.”\n\nAiden put a finger to her lips.\n\nBenjamin was right. I didn’t know how she made the cut.\n\n“But there is more to the world than Polygon. Many of you may not know this, but the Wolves have engineered some of the most astonishing creations I have ever seen. I’ve been there myself. Their world is one of gears and chemicals and things as magical as Godlets themselves. And while I’m proud of what Humankind has achieved, we can benefit from those on the other side of the continent.\n\n“The last trade with Wolves that the Assembly approved of was over thirty years ago. Many in this room will not have remembered it, and not only because there are so many young faces in attendance. It hardly lasted more than a week. Complications…arose.” The First Assemblyman clasped his hands together and smiled devilishly, as if he were about to land a punchline. “But failures of the past do not compel us to relinquish possibilities of the future. With *The Principles of Earth and Blood*, we are boundless.”\n\nHe paused, and everyone clapped to fill the brief silence.\n\n“Now, please welcome our guest of honor as he joins me. Bogg is a renowned mogul at the Builder’s Mountains. He has brought his daughter, Kara, along with him. A round of applause, please!”\n\nWhile we obliged his request, two figures entered the dais from behind its back curtain and stood by Clovis. Both wore elegant white outfits that I nearly mistook for bathrobes, but the fabric was far finer than anything I’d wear on a lazy morning, and their clothes shone as brightly as snow under the sun. Odder than their stylistic choice was that the clothing was literally *moving*—their tops gently rippled from left to right, as if dozens of tiny ocean waves were rolling underneath in rapid, successive, rhythmic fashion.\n\nBoth of them wore jewelry from head to toe, each ornament cut from a different gem. Their dangling, blood-red earrings and their sparkling, gray bracelets rotated in perfect harmony with the mechanical dance of their robes. More than half of their fingers were decorated with gemstone rings. Those, at least, stood still.\n\nTheir faces…my hand instinctively went to my hammer as I took them in, man and girl. Both were utterly covered in what looked like billions of thin whiskers. It was almost disgusting to look at. The larger man’s hair was mostly dark gray with a few dashes of white interspersed from his dome to his mane. The girl’s hair was similar in character, but it was the yellow-green of spring leaves.\n\n*She-Wolves have beards. Noted.*\n\nTheir fangs extended down what I guessed was past their chins, but they were too hairy—or too whiskery—to tell. While the man-Wolf was definitely lean for his size, the girl was definitely too skinny to be healthy. Even with all of that hair, I could see her sunken cheeks.\n\nAs our applause died down, the taller of the pair offered a deep, long bow. “Hello to you all,” he boomed in a deep, confident voice. “My daughter and I thank you for your hospitality. I’ve already met some of you when we landed earlier today. My name is Bogg, and this is Kara.”\n\nThe girl waved to the crowd with both hands, as if trying to make a joke. She stumbled forward, and for a second, I thought she’d trip over her feet.\n\nBogg’s gaze never left us, and he continued unabated. “My team and I have been in communication with Clovis and his cohort for years, ironing out the details of this deal. The Great Builder has granted all of us most fortuitous circumstances. You see, I have learned that underneath Polygon may rest undiscovered veins of metals and other valuable materials. If I understand correctly, you all use much of this metal for what you call ‘money’. But we don’t have this ‘money’ in the Builder’s Mountains. We employ the Great Builder’s seeds towards far more creative ends. With his gifts, we fertilize the world.”\n\nI frowned. *Was that a dig at us?*\n\nI noticed other faces turn sour, too.\n\nBut Bogg either didn’t notice, or he didn’t care. “We have had toys that sniff out the earth’s riches long before I came into contact with your people. We call them ‘metal detectors’. With knowledge of how Polygon runs, my team created a specialized device just for you, your own artificial bug. But I digress. I won’t bore you with details here, nor with a demonstration. Roderick and the rest of your Assembly have already seen its efficacy.\n\n“Your men of Industry will receive shipments of my toys. It has been agreed upon that I will receive some modest fraction of any metals that my bugs discover for you.” Bogg paused. “This is—”\n\nKara took a wobbly step forward, and an explosion of bile and chunks of who-knows-what rocketed from her mouth.\n\nBenjamin yelled profanity, but it was drowned out by the hundred other yells of shock. I looked wide-eyed towards my friends. “She’s drunk,” I muttered. “Guess booze hits Wolves the same way it hits us.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” Clovis shouted, as Bogg grabbed his daughter by the arm and quickly fell back behind the curtain from which they came. “I’m terribly sorry, friends. Kara must be unwell. In any case, I thank you all for attending once again. Have a good night, everyone.”\n\nPeople immediately began shuffling out of the hall. I saw staff who had been silently standing against the walls begin to clean up the place, including the vomit on the dais.\n\n“That was weird,” Aiden said as the three of us rose to our feet.\n\n“Yep,” Benjamin muttered. “This guy’s supposed to be our friend, or something? He brought his drunk daughter to his welcome ceremony. He’s spitting in our faces.”\n\n“No,” Aiden responded. “I mean, I’ve read about the Wolves. They normally raise their children communally. It’s odd that Bogg has a daughter of his own at all.”\n\n“Guess your books don’t have all the answers, after all,” Benjamin teased.\n\n“I *did* know that Wolves don’t have a currency,” Aiden protested.\n\nI put my fist out. “Much as I’d love to stick around, I’m gonna find Lieutenant Roderick. I’ll see you back at the hotel.”\n\nMy friends took turns bumping my fist, and I headed towards the table I had seen Roderick sitting at. When I turned his way, I saw that everyone at his table had already left, except him.\n\nHe was waiting for me.\n\n“Uh, sir,” I said as I approached his backside. “You wanted to see me?”\n\nRoderick turned his head but remained seated and utterly still. “Sit for a second, Wyatt.”\n\nI did, and I turned my chair so that we were face-to-face. “What can I do for you?”\n\nThe Lieutenant’s dimples showed as he held back a grin. “Some ceremony, eh?”\n\n“Seems like the Assembly will approve the deal.”\n\nRoderick laughed. “Relax, Wyatt. It’s just you and me here.” Now his face did break out in a flashy smile. “What do you really think?”\n\n“I, um…” I broke eye contact with my commander. “Sorry, I don’t know what to say, sir.”\n\n“Hey, kid, listen to me. Look at me. You’re, what, nineteen-years-old? You’ve been in the Military for less than a year. I’ve seen you in training. In action. You’ve got more drive than most rookies I’ve come across.”\n\nI looked back at Roderick and did my best to suppress the elation that wanted to leap out of my throat. “Really?”\n\nRoderick winked at me and nodded. “Between you and me. You’re passionate about your job. How long have you wanted to join the Military?”\n\n“I never considered another profession, sir.”\n\n“Figured as much. You could go a long way, kid. I see it. And I’m in your camp. Know that.”\n\n“I appreciate that. I…don’t know what to say.”\n\nHis playful expression again broke out in a chuckle. “You said that already. Now, I ask again: what did you think of that ceremony?”\n\n“Well…I don’t understand why Bogg would bring his daughter out if she’s such a liability.”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Go on.”\n\n“I don’t know what’s going on with—what was her name, Kara? If Bogg wanted to earn our trust or respect, why would he have brought his drunk daughter onto the dais? Unless his judgment is that poor, in which case we shouldn’t be trading with him in the first place. Or maybe he did it on purpose, to spit in our face. It’s dicey enough working with any Wolf, let alone a stupid or malevolent one.”\n\n“Why is that?”\n\nMy nerves had faded away, and I leaned closer towards my Lieutenant. “Humans should stick to our own. Things are good enough at Polygon. Clovis said it himself. Why entangle ourselves with another race?” I shook my head. “They’re not worth it.”\n\n“There it is,” Roderick said approvingly. “I might agree with you, kid. But you know, maybe Bogg’s technology will land us gold. More money is never a bad thing. I don’t know, honestly. I hadn’t heard about the details until his speech.”\n\n“He was mocking us,” I snapped. “He called his own technology ‘toys’ several times. Like we’re just receiving the bottom of the barrel. Screw him and his drunk daughter.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” Roderick held his hands up teasingly. “I hear you. I don’t like working with them, either.” He shrugged his shoulders. “But you’re wrong about one thing, Wyatt. Things can \\*always \\*get better.”\n\n“Yeah well,” I muttered. “I guess we’ll see.”\n\n“And speaking of his ‘drunk daughter’, as you called her. That’s why I wanted to talk to you.”\n\nI sat back in my chair. “Oh?”\n\nRoderick cocked his head and looked vaguely puzzled. “You were in attendance when their ship landed earlier today. I know the two of them exited very quickly and were escorted away, but did you by any chance make eye contact with Kara?”\n\nI pursed my lips. “Not at all. To be totally honest, I barely looked at them.”\n\n“Not curious to see what a Wolf looked like? I know you hadn’t seen one yet, out in the Wildlands.”\n\n“Nope. Not at all. They’re not us.”\n\nRoderick snorted. “Fair enough. And you’ve been in my sights for the last few hours. You couldn’t have interacted with her since then.”\n\n“Sir, what’s this about?”\n\n“She wants a night out on the town. Apparently she wants to check out the Capital’s bar scene. From what I’m told, she requested you as her tour guide.”\n\nI frowned. “What? That’s my task?”\n\nRoderick nodded. “Yeah. Not the sexiest order I’ll give you, but there it is. They’re our guests, so it’s not really our call.”\n\n“No, I get that. Bogg’s going to let her out after that debacle? How old is she, anyway?”\n\n“I don’t know. Couple years younger than you, I guess, though the beard makes it hard to tell.”\n\nI ran a hand through my hair, unsure how to react. “I…don’t like this. I don’t want to talk to these Wolves. I definitely don’t want to babysit some drunk.”\n\n“I get it. Think of it as security service. I don’t know how these Wolves choose to live, and I certainly wouldn’t let my kid out after humiliating me. Who knows, maybe that’s going to be the case. Before the ceremony, my superior had told Bogg that you’d meet her outside her hotel at nine p.m. Maybe she won’t show. But if she does, you’re there to protect her.”\n\nI grinned at my Lieutenant. “I do like that better than babysitting.”\n\nHe lightly punched me in the arm. “There you go. Oh, and don’t change your clothes. Let’s keep a professional face.”\n\n“Definitely.”\n\n“Do you know where \\*No Rules \\*is? It’s a high-end bar just a few blocks from where Kara and Bogg are staying.”\n\nI nodded. “Yeah. I’ve never gone in, though. Last time I was in the Capital was when we passed our training. My friends and I celebrated in the area.”\n\n“I’m sure you did. Here.”\n\nRoderick pulled out something from his jacket pocket and handed me half a dozen heavy golden coins. I looked at them and saw the same insignia inscribed on them that was on Clovis’ pin. I whistled. “This isn’t your money, is it?”\n\n“Of course not. I like you, but not that much. The Assembly’s covering whatever Kara wants tonight.”\n\n“I won’t drink,” I assured him.\n\nHe smiled proudly at me. “I know you won’t. Look, I know it won’t be the most fun job, but I’ll make sure people know you did it well.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. Do you know why she chose me?”\n\nRoderick rose to his feet, and I followed suit. He extended a rough, calloused hand to me. I met his grip. “You have an hour to yourself before you’re on duty. I have no idea why she insisted on you, but you can ask her. Might be a good way to bypass small talk, anyway. Good luck, Wyatt. I’ll see you in the morning.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. For everything. I won’t let you down.”\n\nWith one last charming grin, my commander walked away and left the banquet hall.\n\nI looked around and realized that no one was left but the cleaning crew and me. I closed my eyes and took a breath.\n\n*One night. One Wolf. One job.*\n\n*I got this.*\n\n[crowdfund://0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC?features=](crowdfund://0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC?features=)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633476883, "digest": "5fpST5F3mN3uBn6TWulCF7iCRk9sBE-EhnKiQuJ7gXo", "contributor": "0xF2AF7D2dd2aE52d802589Fea4D5Ebb68a127C0CC"}

The only thing that separates an advertisement from a purchase is a couple of mouse clicks. My central contention is that late capitalism not only accelerates the flow of capital, but also accelerates the rate at which subjects assume identities. Identity formation is inextricably linked to the urge to consume, and therefore the acceleration of capitalism necessitates an increase in the rate at which individuals assume and shed identities. The internet is one of many late capitalist phenomena that allow for more flexible, rapid, and profitable mechanisms of identity formation.\n\nThe best analogy for the pfp craze \n\nobfuscation of the cult of identity \n\ntheir unicity is best understood in a post-industrial framework. these are not 10,000 handmade drawings, rather 10,000 mechanized outputs of a set of parameterized characteristics.\n\nRoland Barthes experiences the pleasure of the Lacanian mirror when he visits the cinema: \"In the movie theater, however far away I am sitting, I press my nose against the screen's mirror, against that \"other\" image-repertoire with which I narcissistically identify myself\" (Barthes 348).

{"id": "lFvAbqee4TgcYrktJWZ5Sfo1s4vUJuJ73hb7VXRbuW0", "title": "The argument for Bitcoin", "body": "*Why Bitcoin is likely to be the best risk return adjusted asset for the next decade.*\n\n# Summary\n\nBitcoin is a fundamental innovation on par with the invention of the Internet, or Electricity. It’s the first implementation of digital property: a scarce, verifiable and easily transferable asset that is truly decentralized and cannot be stopped. Bitcoin has been compared to “digital gold”, but it will likely far exceed the market cap of gold, currently standing at 11 Trillion. While other crypto assets may appreciate more in percentage terms, Bitcoin is the “risk off” asset, and will continue to maintain a dominant share of the crypto-currency market cap for the foreseeable future.\n\n# Bitcoin versus forks of Bitcoin\n\nFor those who don’t own Bitcoin, the first stumbling block to buying it is the argument that it will be displaced by another “better” cryptocurrency. This idea has been around since the early days of Bitcoin, as the Bitcoin code is completely open source and can be easily “improved”.\n\nTwo early “tweaks” to this were LiteCoin, released in 2011 which reduced the block time from 10 minutes to 2.5 minutes to improve performance and DogeCoin in 2013 which further reduced it to 1 minute. Both of these coins are minute, surgical changes to the core Bitcoin code, but both now have market caps exceeding 10 Billion USD. In 2017 another fork, Bitcoin Cash appeared, which briefly held a 30% value versus BTC, but has gone steadily down to 1%.\n\n![BCH versus BTC](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p2ENdEbhD53OWxmfdZvMM.png?height=782&width=1400)\n\nAt this point, hundreds of forks of Bitcoin have now been attempted, and none have managed to maintain even a 5% market cap share versus the original crypto currency. So it’s pretty clear that Bitcoin can’t be simply displaced by a newer version of Bitcoin.\n\n# Bitcoin versus other, different cryptocurrencies\n\nWhile the empirical evidence of the last 10 years strongly suggests Bitcoin can’t be beat by a mere derivation of Bitcoin, there are now plenty of other blockchains that are faster, cheaper, and more feature rich than Bitcoin. Could Bitcoin be the “Myspace” to a future “Facebook”? Possibly, but not likely.\n\nThe first and leading contender to Bitcoin by market cap is Ethereum, which went live in 2015. Ethereum offered Turing-complete smart contracts, a major advantage over Bitcoin, allowing (in theory) for truly programable money. But Ethereum is still expensive and slow — a serious drawback for a platform designed for applications.\n\nDespite this, Ethereum has definitely found product market fit in two areas: as a platform on which to mint other tokens, and as a platform for decentralized finance. The size of the DEFI market is currently around 20 Billion, roughly 5% of the market cap of ETH, and ETH tokens. In other words, at this point 5% of ETH tokens are loaned out and put in decentralized contracts. It’s a significant achievement, but not earth shattering.\n\nPost Ethereum, chains like Matic, Proton, Cardano and Solana all offer significant performance advantages. Could any of these these chains displace Bitcoin?\n\nIt’s unlikely. While Ethereum and its competitors are aiming to develop a platform for smart contracts and apps, the real killer app of crypto is decentralized property. Ethereum, with its proof of stake version 2, and all its competitors are at the end of the day far more centralized. They all have known VC backers and they all have committees that change their rules frequently. They aren’t in the competition for “digital gold” — they are trying to be new forms of programable money.\n\nIt’s unclear to me who will end up winning this battle for smart contracts. It might be one of the existing players, or it may be a giant such as Google, Apple, Facebook or Amazon who decide to throw their hat in the ring. Facebook is probably the furthest along of the four, but it’s no longer a question of if, but when these behemoths enter the fray. Without the approval from the Google and Apple app stores, the applications of crypto in apps is going to be limited. And if approval is opened up, you can bet that both Google and Apple will play in that area.\n\nIn summary, Bitcoin is going after the big market (digital property) and all the other coins are going after the smaller market (programable money). Because of the smaller market caps some of these may be amazing investments, far exceeding Bitcoin. But they are inherently more risky. And less likely to massively change the world.\n\n# The sheer size of the Bitcoin network\n\nComparing Bitcoin to any other cryptocurrency should not only consider the market cap, but also the sheer size of the mining power and energy deployed to maintain the network.\n\nTo get a sense of this, at the time of writing this is 112 Million Tera Hash / second. Thats 112 Million Trillion, or 112 Quintillion operations per second being used to secure blocks. Put another way, that is 1 Million S19 Pro miner rigs, costing 10,000 dollars each. So just in fixed cost of mining that is 10 Billion dollars in investment, and an investment with at most a three year effective life (hash rate increases obsolete older machines very quickly).\n\nBut even more importantly, Bitcoin consumes *80 Tera Watt hours annually*. This would require 3 1000 MW Nuclear reactors producing energy full time if everybody was using state of the art miners. Because most mining is done with older miners, the number is closer to 6, and was closer to 12 as recently as April before the China crackdown. For simplicity, let’s think 10 state of the art nukes, doubling every 4 years. Cost of each nuke: 30 Billion dollars.\n\nSo Bitcoin is backed now by a 300 Billion USD plus investment in power plants and mining rigs. To put this in perspective, a crypto currency like Ripple, while having a 35 Billion dollar valuation has virtually no such a decentralized worldwide investment. Ethereum 1.0, which is proof of work like Bitcoin, has 0.5 MM Tera Hash / second, less than half of a percent of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash has 1MM Tera Hash / second, or under one percent of Bitcoin. There really is no comparison.\n\nAnother metric of the size of the Bitcoin network is number of users. Its estimated that 80 Million people worldwide now hold bitcoin. This is largely just held, and not used monthly in transactions. That’s the current use case: a long term store of value, not a better version of visa. By comparison, its estimated that there are 5 million Ethereum users, and less than 50,000 of these use the network on a daily basis (mainly to trade other ERC-20 coins on UniSwap). Again, there really is no comparison.\n\n# Beyond the reach of governments\n\nNo government has a spare energy supply of 10 Nuclear reactors and 1 million mining machines. That would be the requirement to get 1/2 the current mining power of Bitcoin. Even a radical move like China banning Bitcoin mining 2 months ago had minimal effect on the Bitcoin network. The hash rate, which bottomed at 80 has already climbed back to 110 in a month.\n\n# Wrapped Bitcoin and Lightning for small transactions\n\nAn often repeated critique of Bitcoin is that is far too slow and costly for small transactions. Let’s dive in deeper here and see how this argument holds up.\n\nFirst of all, it is true that ultimate settlement on the Bitcoin network takes 6 confirmations, or about an hour (except in exceptional times where the network is overloaded). For larger transactions ($10,000 or more) this is still much much faster than international or domestic money wires. But clearly, its not competitive with conventional credit and debit cards or apple pay / paypal etc..\n\nDoes this mean it is somehow inherently defective as Nouriel Roubini often states? No. Wrapped Bitcoin, which now represents 1% of all Bitcoin (over 7 Billion dollars worth) can be sent in speeds of several minutes (on ETH) to seconds on Proton, Solana, Matic and other third generation blockchains. Ordinary Layer 1 Bitcoin can be moved in this way to a fast wrapped chain, for ultra fast transactions and programability, maintaining the core value proposition of Bitcoin: its immutable finite supply.\n\nThe lightning network is also a viable, although still emerging network for Bitcoin transactions. Every Bitcoin node can become a lightning node and Bitcoin can be locked and transferred in channels with very, very low costs. There are certainly usability issues, but the growth potential is clearly there.\n\n# Bitcoin Versus Gold\n\nGold, with its 11 Trillion market cap is probably the single best benchmark as to where Bitcoin will probably go. At 11 Trillion cap, with 21 Million coins, you get a price of roughly $500,000 per Bitcoin — about 10 times the current valuation.\n\nCould it go much higher? I definitely think so. Unlike gold, where the supply is currently increasing at 3% per year with mining, Bitcoin has a hard cap at 21 Million, which will be effectively reached in 20 years. This argument is strengthened by the fact that gold mining activity will almost certainly increase if gold reaches $3,000 an ounce or higher — but again, Bitcoin supply is fixed. Bitcoin possession is also verifiable immediately. Gold bars held in storage might not be pure, or may not exist 1–1 for the certificates held against them. Gold is hard to move, difficult to divide, and expensive to sell. Bitcoin is moveable, divisible and highly liquid. There really has never been anything like it.\n\n# The Plan B analysis\n\nHow far and how fast can Bitcoin go? [Plan B](https://100trillionusd.github.io/), a Bitcoin analyst group, has produced a compelling report that compares Bitcoin, Gold and Silver as a function of the remaining ultimate scarcity. Essentially, every 4 years Bitcoin becomes twice as hard to mine, meaning that the “flow” of new Bitcoin decreases by a factor of 2 versus the “stock” of existing Bitcoin. This 2x increase in stock / flow tends to produce a 10x increase for each 4 year period, and maps extremely well to the Gold and Silver data. This analysis would suggest 100 Trillion as the ultimate end point for Bitcoin — or roughly 5 Million per coin. \\n \n\n![Plan B stock to Flow Analysis of Bitcoin](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I63R9_JhGlbtXQuvFVLDa.png?height=980&width=1400)\n\n# The effect of Fed money printing\n\nNote that none of the previous discussion of Bitcoin relied on any argument of massive inflation due to Fed or other central bank money printing. Simply put, Bitcoin as a better form of scarce digital gold has historically been the best asset class of the last decade, and may very well continue in the next decade. But if you add on to this the extraordinary, absolutely unprecedented increase in M1, you now have the perfect storm for Bitcoin \\n  \\n \n\n![M1 growth](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3sLwZ7a1apeFN95xDjF7d.png?height=500&width=1400)\n\nThe Fed, the ECB, The Bank of Japan and the Bank of China are all dramatically increasing money supply and national debt, while artificially keeping interest rates at 0. Inflation has already started to significantly increase. This is the perfect storm for hard assets — with Bitcoin being the hardest asset of all.\n\n# Planetary Implications\n\nBitcoin has gone from 0 to 1 Trillion in 10 years. You don’t do that without tremendous volatility. And if we are correct, we are still 10–20 years or so from getting close to peak Bitcoin. But in the process, the growing adoption of this new digital gold as a reserve asset by individuals, companies and countries will replace the dollar and Euro.\n\nTwenty years from now, it’s likely most things will be purchasable in Bitcoin, and many if not most people will start to think in Bitcoin first and in fiat currencies second. This is going to constrain central banks and governments from the massive deficit spending and money printing we have seen in the last 50 years, with the culmination of “quantitative easing” of the last decade, debt buybacks, share buybacks and other ways of central banks artificially trying to prop up the economy.\n\nWith Bitcoin as the final standard, we will move to a deflationary world where purchasing power always goes up, as technology delivers higher and higher productivity. Contrary to Bernanke’s view, this deflationary world is a highly desirable one, and in any case, is where we are heading once the fiat / central bank standard goes bust.\n\nThe macro-economic implications of a Bitcoin world are staggering. They far exceed (in my opinion) the technological benefits of a better means of payment.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBitcoin is not just another crypto. It is the clear dominant store of digital property on the planet, and it could have planetary consequences in a few decades once it reaches its full potential. There are clearly other blockchains, which may present excellent investment opportunities and great technological breakthroughs, but Bitcoin is the coin that will truly change the world.", "timestamp": 1633478233, "digest": "nnPEWqpPqNXXYJWooK3YkvHdwXmk1oZeepgwSlrg_mA", "contributor": "0x2cD7162A6668596C0243B2c2F0C1aA8F96d98061"}

I’m working at Capitol Records in Hollywood, California.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1\\*3uWuMPCpGzv4K1TLTIS8tA.jpeg)\n\n*Pulp Fiction* was about to hit the box office and infiltrate pop culture with its timeless lines, some the music industry should have noted:\n\n“Look, do you wanna play blind man? Go walk with the shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fucking open.”\\* —Jules Winnfield\\*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/576/1\\*vR6N7dm5y8u6kaXrECCvAg.jpeg)\n\nThe #1 song was “The Sign” by Ace of Base. They \\*saw the sign \\*and it *opened up their eyes.*\n\nPrince wouldn’t be partying for another 5 years.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/508/1\\*6dM9ADdLUiI34T8umrp2Bw.jpeg)\n\nAnd for the record business — well, they didn’t have anything to complain about. They printed money selling shiny plastic discs and virtually controlled everything from record stores to radio stations. Their marketing strategy of million dollar print, radio and TV campaigns was tried and true and as the saying goes, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It was the golden era of the music business and the good ‘ole boys, they liked to throw parties. I should know, I went to them.\n\nSo, during this “diamonds on the soles of their shoes” era, there was no vision for the future.\n\nThey didn’t think they needed one.\n\nAs for me, I had moved from Texas to Hollywood to pursue a glamorous career in rock & roll but things were going a lot slower than planned. After years of paying my dues as an assistant, I knew I needed to do something bold or I would be making photocopies and answering the phones for the rest of my career. This was the year that was \\*finally \\*gonna bring on the magic.\n\nWhat happened next was about to change music history.\n\n…………………………\n\n**This chain of events** started with a word that was soon to be all the rage: \\*multimedia—\\*a new way to combine music, video, graphics and interactivity using a computer.\n\nThe moment I realized that multimedia could revolutionize the way we could market our music came when a co-worker named Dave Goldberg showed me the first music video made with Macromedia Director—an interactive multimedia authoring tool. When I saw that video, I knew I had to hunt down the programmer. His name was Doug Textor, and he agreed to meet me for breakfast. I told him that I had all these ideas for using the computer to promote our bands but I didn’t know if it was technically possible yet. He said it was, although I don’t think he knew exactly what it entailed, but neither did anyone else at the time.\n\nOur harebrained concepts were put to the test when I was tasked with marketing the upcoming album releases for Frank Sinatra and Bonnie Raitt. Using Director, we created these hilarious-yet-primitive video games that my boss presented to the sales team while I operated the computer. Despite a few head scratches, the game broke new ground and we actually won an award.\n\nWe knew we were onto something…\n\n![Capitol Records Senior Vice President Lou Mann presents the Frank Sinatra Duets Game “Jeopairdy” to the Los Angeles Sales Branch 1994](https://miro.medium.com/max/6514/1\\*aEJGGmxOHfNzZQdj6WAjTw.jpeg)\n\nAfter these multimedia presentations, I wanted to try some more experiments, as there was a blank canvas to innovate. Two online services, Prodigy and CompuServe, were quickly becoming popular and so were screensavers. We created one for the Beastie Boys and uploaded it into the software and gaming forums to see what would happen. We also put the screensavers on floppy disks with a whopping 1.5 meg of disk space, not even room for a single song.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1\\*e9GQJQBAii-iDdfyaIp39A.jpeg)\n\nAs the screensaver was getting momentum, I was about to get introduced to the Internet, thanks to a cousin I barely knew living in Silicon Valley. He was referred to in our family as a cocky computer genius who loved *his* Steve Jobs. One night we met up in San Francisco where he took me to his office, which was a startup before I even knew what startups were. He showed off his NeXT computer.\n\nThen he showed me this thing called… the World Wide Web.\n\nAnd I knew.\n\nHoly shit.\n\n*This is it.*\n\n## **The Hollywood Handshake**\n\nWhen I returned to Hollywood, I had to explore this spectacle further, but actually getting \\*on \\*the World Wide Web was a technical bitch. If you understood computers back then, you were described as “computer-literate.” But it was even difficult for us “literates” to understand the new world of TCP/IP, PPP, Gopher and Telnet. Since I had real job responsibilities during the day, I would spend my nights alone in the Capitol Tower, just trying to get that damn computer to dial up a modem, in hopes of being rewarded with that glorious sound of the modem connecting. Back then, we tech geeks called it “the handshake.”\n\nI failed, but was still determined.\n\nOne day, I got a memo in “interoffice mail.” I was invited to be on a task force for the upcoming Megadeth album *Youthanasia* and I was to attend the first brainstorming meeting.\n\nMe? Megadeth?\n\nHere’s what I knew about Megadeth: the lead singer, Dave Mustaine, was kicked out of Metallica, and then Megadeth went on to become the most respected heavy metal band of their time, second to Metallica.\n\nDuring the meeting, the executives stressed the importance of this album release, so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do something big and bold on the World Wide Web. Having never heard of the Internet, the record executives were like “yeah, whatever kid” and defaulted to the usual checklist: “Who will shoot the album cover? How many radio stations will play the single? How many posters should we print for the record stores?”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/778/1\\*RQZhV3TK37a-R7jI9gnPiw.gif)\n\nSo even though no one had a clue what I was talking about, I wrote a proposal to create a “virtual cybertown in cyberspace.” It would be called Megadeth, Arizona—based on where the band lived and recorded their album.\n\nMy boss, Lou Mann, the Senior Vice President of the label, actually signed off on the proposal and gave me a whopping $30 grand.\n\nHe had no idea what it was for, and I can guarantee you… *neither did I.*\n\n![In the proposal, I describe the Internet as consisting of “intelligent, upwardly mobile people” amongst other verbal atrocities. The proposal](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RN4JsDEYu6wt7jA9w8Iel.jpeg?height=1419&width=2000)\n\nNow that I was funded, I corralled two of my co-workers to help create the site—Wendy Dougan, who was designing CD album packages in the art department, and Jane Bogart, the company copywriter for those full page ads that bands used to put in magazines.\n\n*They did not know what the Internet was either.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*UGCUaYnD1gihIY8ESL9AGA.jpeg)\n\nWendy found a book on Roadside America that set the creative direction. We found a 1940’s postcard at a flea market that read “Greetings from Arizona.”\n\nJane came up with a tag line: Megadeth, Arizona: *You’ve never been anywhere like it.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*Tki7PQ2QmQEaWtdawHWTkw.jpeg)\n\nYahoo’s homepage— originally called Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web.\n\nThere were three main design options for the web at the time:\n\n1\\. Grey backgrounds\n\n2\\. Times Roman type\n\n3\\. Graphics were buttons\n\nFor content, we assumed a band website would offer the basics like news, music and video.\n\n**MEGABYTE NEWS** — band news\n\n**K-DETH 101** — :30 second music clips\n\n**THE DIGITAL DRIVE IN**—slow moving video clips\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*JCSSmKy6rt9IpnWa0Il8JA.jpeg)\n\nLike any town, we thought it should spread gossip, deliver the mail and conduct town meetings, so we created a few “Internet firsts” like:\n\nA CHATROOM— The Megadiner was the first chatroom for a band. Fans could chat with each other 24–7 and the band would frequently join in, unannounced.\n\nA DIGITAL POSTCARD—This was one of the first applications where one could send a graphic via email, which programmers told us was technically impossible. We took the Megadeth, Arizona postcard and added a form where you could type in a friend’s email address (if they had one, that is) and add a custom message: “Hey Bob! Greetings from Megadeth, Arizona. Wish you were here!” The idea for the digital postcard was inspired by a job I had selling greeting cards. (Who knew that job would come in handy?)\n\n![To promote the website, we made postcards and stickers, because that’s how traditional marketing was done — using people to pass out pieces of paper.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*3GEQaqEAfA8JbgIdjbiGNA.jpeg)\n\nRight before the site launched, I started to panic. Is this any good? Is the band going to hate it? Will heavy metal fans revolt?\n\nBut at the same time, we didn’t think any of that mattered, because we didn’t think anyone would even see it.\n\nThen we went live.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*xoAVHI-Lsol3blnMXn0Siw.jpeg)\n\nEven though I was sure about the web’s potential, I couldn’t even begin to predict what was about to happen. It was the people who came to the site and populated it that made the technology come alive.\n\nAfter that, everything took a life of its own.\n\n## The Flying Roasters\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*KarcDOzvkT8Pom4yddP9YQ.jpeg)\n\nWhen the site hit the mainstream, it got the attention of Starbucks. Company CEO, Howard Shultz and his executive team asked to meet with Capitol Records to see what they could learn, so that they too could have a website. I presented a screensaver called The Flying Roasters, which paid homage to the most popular screensaver at the time—The Flying Toasters. We took Starbucks coffee bags, added wings and had them fly across the home screen to the song “Cantaloop” by US3. During the presentation, Howard, who clearly had visions of the future dancin’ in his head, grabbed my arm and nearly pulled me onto the floor. He grabbed all of the screensavers off the conference room table and tried to squeeze them into his top shirt pocket.\n\nIt took outside validation from Starbucks for the Capitol executives to see that our own company was leading the way.\n\nBy the time Howard had touched down in Seattle, my salary had doubled.\n\n## ‘Til Deth Do We (Didn’t) Part\n\nAt the height of Megadeth, Arizona’s popularity, Capitol wanted to close down the site because the band’s album cycle was ending—still living in a world of limited promotional flights and expiring campaigns. Can you imagine shutting down a popular site today?\n\n![Interactive Age 1995. I pitched this story about the fans “rebelling,” in hopes that Capitol would let me keep the site up.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PDTLvE9akYIbFrMUt3zFig.jpeg)\n\n## Things We Never Could Have Predicted About Megadeth, Arizona\n\n## 1. The site drove interest in computers\n\nWe got emails from people telling us that the site inspired them to buy computers, modems or get Internet connections.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1284/1\\*ZsXfZ3XEKHiW_y8N9KBdug.jpeg)\n\n## 2. The site helped put the Internet on the mainstream media’s radar\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1256/1\\*_QwORul9rv3QYUzQ4ZlWtw.png)\n\n## 3. Megadeth, Arizona opened the door for bands to market on the Internet\n\n“This groundbreaking site set the tone for artist sites to come.” *— Music Connection*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/864/1\\*MDzmdrMzL1prr1p7ZSdFpw.png)\n\n## 4. This Internet thing—it’s global!\n\n![ I still have no idea what this says.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FXYo7wETKQRntrDFYpWmFw.jpeg)\n\n## 5. This would be the birth of social media\n\n“One of the first online communities”— *LA Times*\n\n“One of the first webchats” — Wired\n\nThe site gave the fans the ability to talk to each other, meet one another in person and bond all based on a common interest — *their favorite band*. Some dated and got married. A woman complained she got “the clap” from another fan after they advanced their relationship from the web to the real world. Whoops, sorry. We’re not liable!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1282/1\\*cF-zqri8-QhhZChWQUTk7w.jpeg)\n\n## 6. Unprecedented access to celebrities\n\n“Dave Mustaine used the web to reach out to his fans—but that brought its own complications. When he first ventured into his site’s chatroom, none of the fans believed he was who he said he was. Once they realized it was him, they wouldn’t leave him alone.” —Rolling Stone\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*56j_OlHfoPIZgR0vIhiaDg.jpeg)\n\nBack then, the rock star was bigger than life—distant and inaccessible. The site allowed the band to interact with a large number of fans at once—raw, intimate and unfiltered. For the fans, being able to chat with the band seemed so unbelievable at first, that they would put them through a verification process.\n\n![The Megadiner chatroom transcript. Fans grilling Dave Mustaine (megaman) to verify his identity.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*4GlS2DfGoGyBTDwYY8_bXQ.png)\n\n![Electronic Entertainment / July 1995](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*eT0tP6IHo1mDPyYHGs55Eg.jpeg)\n\nThe band also rallied their fans to help with various missions, motivating them with a digital name — The CyberArmy. These are all early examples of how social media is used today.\n\n## 7. The beginning of “going viral”\n\nI didn’t realize while creating the digital postcard, that when people would send one to a friend — their friend would also learn about the website. You could create one digital master of a concept, and people could spread the word for you— as if it was *their* idea. Goodbye print marketing, hello digital.\n\n## 8. The band were pioneers too\n\n“It’s the Wild, Wild West but we think we should go for it.”— *Megadeth*\n\nThe band embraced the website immediately and jumped right in. They were already into computers, so they were able to speak articulately about the web, which they viewed as a “modern version of tape trading.”\n\n“What is the Internet? What do you do? What is the goal? How does it work?” — Megadeth\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/988/1\\*x_QR3cb6EFT44xgknzN91w.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1010/1\\*znCkJ8TEWKH-UKbPFcs-Gg.png)\n\n**My proudest memory** of Megadeth, Arizona, was that the early site adopters, the band and the fans, myself and my web team and the early journalists—*together*, we made people believe that the Internet was here to stay.\n\n*And it did.*\n\nIf you are reading this story twenty years later and you were one of the early adopters of our town, we have frequently wondered if you’re still out there floating in cyberspace—albeit at a faster speed.\n\nIn 1994, no one could have predicted all the ways that we’d be using technology today. So imagine what you can create in the next 20 years.\n\nJust start somewhere. Believe and make others believe!\n\n![You see, this profession is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

Go walk with the shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fucking open.” —Jules Winnfield\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/576/1\\*vR6N7dm5y8u6kaXrECCvAg.jpeg)\n\nThe #1 song was “The Sign” by Ace of Base.

They printed money selling shiny plastic discs and virtually controlled everything from record stores to radio stations. Their marketing strategy of million dollar print, radio and TV campaigns was tried and true and as the saying goes, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It was the golden era of the music business and the good ‘ole boys, they liked to throw parties. I should know, I went to them.\n\nSo, during this “diamonds on the soles of their shoes” era, there was no vision for the future.\n\nThey didn’t think they needed one.\n\nAs for me, I had moved from Texas to Hollywood to pursue a glamorous career in rock & roll but things were going a lot slower than planned. After years of paying my dues as an assistant, I knew I needed to do something bold or I would be making photocopies and answering the phones for the rest of my career. This was the year that was  \\\\n finally gonna bring on the magic.\n\nWhat happened next was about to change music history.\n\n…………………………\n\n**This chain of events** started with a word that was soon to be all the rage: \\*multimedia—\\*a new way to combine music, video, graphics and interactivity using a computer.\n\nThe moment I realized that multimedia could revolutionize the way we could market our music came when a co-worker named Dave Goldberg showed me the first music video made with Macromedia Director—an interactive multimedia authoring tool. When I saw that video, I knew I had to hunt down the programmer. His name was Doug Textor, and he agreed to meet me for breakfast. I told him that I had all these ideas for using the computer to promote our bands but I didn’t know if it was technically possible yet. He said it was, although I don’t think he knew exactly what it entailed, but neither did anyone else at the time.\n\nOur harebrained concepts were put to the test when I was tasked with marketing the upcoming album releases for Frank Sinatra and Bonnie Raitt. Using Director, we created these hilarious-yet-primitive video games that my boss presented to the sales team while I operated the computer. Despite a few head scratches, the game broke new ground and we actually won an award.\n\nWe knew we were onto something…\n\n![Capitol Records Senior Vice President Lou Mann presents the Frank Sinatra Duets Game “Jeopairdy” to the Los Angeles Sales Branch 1994](https://miro.medium.com/max/6514/1\\*aEJGGmxOHfNzZQdj6WAjTw.jpeg)\n\nAfter these multimedia presentations, I wanted to try some more experiments, as there was a blank canvas to innovate. Two online services, Prodigy and CompuServe, were quickly becoming popular and so were screensavers. We created one for the Beastie Boys and uploaded it into the software and gaming forums to see what would happen. We also put the screensavers on floppy disks with a whopping 1.5 meg of disk space, not even room for a single song.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1\\*e9GQJQBAii-iDdfyaIp39A.jpeg)\n\nAs the screensaver was getting momentum, I was about to get introduced to the Internet, thanks to a cousin I barely knew living in Silicon Valley. He was referred to in our family as a cocky computer genius who loved *his* Steve Jobs. One night we met up in San Francisco where he took me to his office, which was a startup before I even knew what startups were. He showed off his NeXT computer.\n\nThen he showed me this thing called… the World Wide Web.\n\nAnd I knew.\n\nHoly shit.\n\n*This is it.*\n\n## **The Hollywood Handshake**\n\nWhen I returned to Hollywood, I had to explore this spectacle further, but actually getting \\*on \\*the World Wide Web was a technical bitch. If you understood computers back then, you were described as “computer-literate.” But it was even difficult for us “literates” to understand the new world of TCP/IP, PPP, Gopher and Telnet. Since I had real job responsibilities during the day, I would spend my nights alone in the Capitol Tower, just trying to get that damn computer to dial up a modem, in hopes of being rewarded with that glorious sound of the modem connecting. Back then, we tech geeks called it “the handshake.”\n\nI failed, but was still determined.\n\nOne day, I got a memo in “interoffice mail.” I was invited to be on a task force for the upcoming Megadeth album *Youthanasia* and I was to attend the first brainstorming meeting.\n\nMe? Megadeth?\n\nHere’s what I knew about Megadeth: the lead singer, Dave Mustaine, was kicked out of Metallica, and then Megadeth went on to become the most respected heavy metal band of their time, second to Metallica.\n\nDuring the meeting, the executives stressed the importance of this album release, so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do something big and bold on the World Wide Web. Having never heard of the Internet, the record executives were like “yeah, whatever kid” and defaulted to the usual checklist: “Who will shoot the album cover? How many radio stations will play the single? How many posters should we print for the record stores?”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/778/1\\*RQZhV3TK37a-R7jI9gnPiw.gif)\n\nSo even though no one had a clue what I was talking about, I wrote a proposal to create a “virtual cybertown in cyberspace.” It would be called Megadeth, Arizona—based on where the band lived and recorded their album.\n\nMy boss, Lou Mann, the Senior Vice President of the label, actually signed off on the proposal and gave me a whopping $30 grand.\n\nHe had no idea what it was for, and I can guarantee you… *neither did I.*\n\n![In the proposal, I describe the Internet as consisting of “intelligent, upwardly mobile people” amongst other verbal atrocities. The proposal](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RN4JsDEYu6wt7jA9w8Iel.jpeg?height=1419&width=2000)\n\nNow that I was funded, I corralled two of my co-workers to help create the site—Wendy Dougan, who was designing CD album packages in the art department, and Jane Bogart, the company copywriter for those full page ads that bands used to put in magazines.\n\n*They did not know what the Internet was either.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*UGCUaYnD1gihIY8ESL9AGA.jpeg)\n\nWendy found a book on Roadside America that set the creative direction. We found a 1940’s postcard at a flea market that read “Greetings from Arizona.”\n\nJane came up with a tag line: Megadeth, Arizona: *You’ve never been anywhere like it.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*Tki7PQ2QmQEaWtdawHWTkw.jpeg)\n\nYahoo’s homepage— originally called Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web.\n\nThere were three main design options for the web at the time:\n\n1\\. Grey backgrounds\n\n2\\. Times Roman type\n\n3\\. Graphics were buttons\n\nFor content, we assumed a band website would offer the basics like news, music and video.\n\n**MEGABYTE NEWS** — band news\n\n**K-DETH 101** — :30 second music clips\n\n**THE DIGITAL DRIVE IN**—slow moving video clips\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*JCSSmKy6rt9IpnWa0Il8JA.jpeg)\n\nLike any town, we thought it should spread gossip, deliver the mail and conduct town meetings, so we created a few “Internet firsts” like:\n\nA CHATROOM— The Megadiner was the first chatroom for a band. Fans could chat with each other 24–7 and the band would frequently join in, unannounced.\n\nA DIGITAL POSTCARD—This was one of the first applications where one could send a graphic via email, which programmers told us was technically impossible. We took the Megadeth, Arizona postcard and added a form where you could type in a friend’s email address (if they had one, that is) and add a custom message: “Hey Bob! Greetings from Megadeth, Arizona. Wish you were here!” The idea for the digital postcard was inspired by a job I had selling greeting cards. (Who knew that job would come in handy?)\n\n![To promote the website, we made postcards and stickers, because that’s how traditional marketing was done — using people to pass out pieces of paper.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*3GEQaqEAfA8JbgIdjbiGNA.jpeg)\n\nRight before the site launched, I started to panic. Is this any good? Is the band going to hate it? Will heavy metal fans revolt?\n\nBut at the same time, we didn’t think any of that mattered, because we didn’t think anyone would even see it.\n\nThen we went live.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*xoAVHI-Lsol3blnMXn0Siw.jpeg)\n\nEven though I was sure about the web’s potential, I couldn’t even begin to predict what was about to happen. It was the people who came to the site and populated it that made the technology come alive.\n\nAfter that, everything took a life of its own.\n\n## The Flying Roasters\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*KarcDOzvkT8Pom4yddP9YQ.jpeg)\n\nWhen the site hit the mainstream, it got the attention of Starbucks. Company CEO, Howard Shultz and his executive team asked to meet with Capitol Records to see what they could learn, so that they too could have a website. I presented a screensaver called The Flying Roasters, which paid homage to the most popular screensaver at the time—The Flying Toasters. We took Starbucks coffee bags, added wings and had them fly across the home screen to the song “Cantaloop” by US3. During the presentation, Howard, who clearly had visions of the future dancin’ in his head, grabbed my arm and nearly pulled me onto the floor. He grabbed all of the screensavers off the conference room table and tried to squeeze them into his top shirt pocket.\n\nIt took outside validation from Starbucks for the Capitol executives to see that our own company was leading the way.\n\nBy the time Howard had touched down in Seattle, my salary had doubled.\n\n## ‘Til Deth Do We (Didn’t) Part\n\nAt the height of Megadeth, Arizona’s popularity, Capitol wanted to close down the site because the band’s album cycle was ending—still living in a world of limited promotional flights and expiring campaigns. Can you imagine shutting down a popular site today?\n\n![Interactive Age 1995. I pitched this story about the fans “rebelling,” in hopes that Capitol would let me keep the site up.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PDTLvE9akYIbFrMUt3zFig.jpeg)\n\n## Things We Never Could Have Predicted About Megadeth, Arizona\n\n## 1. The site drove interest in computers\n\nWe got emails from people telling us that the site inspired them to buy computers, modems or get Internet connections.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1284/1\\*ZsXfZ3XEKHiW_y8N9KBdug.jpeg)\n\n## 2.

We found a 1940’s postcard at a flea market that read “Greetings from Arizona.”\n\nJane came up with a tag line: Megadeth, Arizona: *You’ve never been anywhere like it.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*Tki7PQ2QmQEaWtdawHWTkw.jpeg)\n\nYahoo’s homepage— originally called Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web.\n\nThere were three main design options for the web at the time:\n\n1\\. Grey backgrounds\n\n2\\. Times Roman type\n\n3\\. Graphics were buttons\n\nFor content, we assumed a band website would offer the basics like news, music and video.\n\n**MEGABYTE NEWS** — band news\n\n**K-DETH 101** — :30 second music clips\n\n**THE DIGITAL DRIVE IN**—slow moving video clips\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*JCSSmKy6rt9IpnWa0Il8JA.jpeg)\n\nLike any town, we thought it should spread gossip, deliver the mail and conduct town meetings, so we created a few “Internet firsts” like:\n\nA CHATROOM— The Megadiner was the first chatroom for a band. Fans could chat with each other 24–7 and the band would frequently join in, unannounced.\n\nA DIGITAL POSTCARD—This was one of the first applications where one could send a graphic via email, which programmers told us was technically impossible. We took the Megadeth, Arizona postcard and added a form where you could type in a friend’s email address (if they had one, that is) and add a custom message: “Hey Bob! Greetings from Megadeth, Arizona. Wish you were here!” The idea for the digital postcard was inspired by a job I had selling greeting cards. (Who knew that job would come in handy?)\n\n![To promote the website, we made postcards and stickers, because that’s how traditional marketing was done — using people to pass out pieces of paper.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*3GEQaqEAfA8JbgIdjbiGNA.jpeg)\n\nRight before the site launched, I started to panic. Is this any good? Is the band going to hate it? Will heavy metal fans revolt?\n\nBut at the same time, we didn’t think any of that mattered, because we didn’t think anyone would even see it.\n\nThen we went live.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*xoAVHI-Lsol3blnMXn0Siw.jpeg)\n\nEven though I was sure about the web’s potential, I couldn’t even begin to predict what was about to happen. It was the people who came to the site and populated it that made the technology come alive.\n\nAfter that, everything took a life of its own.\n\n## The Flying Roasters\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*KarcDOzvkT8Pom4yddP9YQ.jpeg)\n\nWhen the site hit the mainstream, it got the attention of Starbucks. Company CEO, Howard Shultz and his executive team asked to meet with Capitol Records to see what they could learn, so that they too could have a website. I presented a screensaver called The Flying Roasters, which paid homage to the most popular screensaver at the time—The Flying Toasters. We took Starbucks coffee bags, added wings and had them fly across the home screen to the song “Cantaloop” by US3. During the presentation, Howard, who clearly had visions of the future dancin’ in his head, grabbed my arm and nearly pulled me onto the floor. He grabbed all of the screensavers off the conference room table and tried to squeeze them into his top shirt pocket.\n\nIt took outside validation from Starbucks for the Capitol executives to see that our own company was leading the way.\n\nBy the time Howard had touched down in Seattle, my salary had doubled.\n\n## ‘Til Deth Do We (Didn’t) Part\n\nAt the height of Megadeth, Arizona’s popularity, Capitol wanted to close down the site because the band’s album cycle was ending—still living in a world of limited promotional flights and expiring campaigns. Can you imagine shutting down a popular site today?\n\n![Interactive Age 1995. I pitched this story about the fans “rebelling,” in hopes that Capitol would let me keep the site up.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PDTLvE9akYIbFrMUt3zFig.jpeg)\n\n## Things We Never Could Have Predicted About Megadeth, Arizona\n\n## 1.

", "body": "## 20 years ago today, the first website for a band debuted in cyberspace\n\nRobin Bechtel  /  October 1, 2014\n\n*“The music industry’s first runaway hit on the web” — Interactive Age*\n\nThis is the story of how an unlikely threesome—a girl, a heavy metal band and their fans — pioneered the web at its infancy, bucked the status quo and proved that the Internet wasn’t a fad.\n\n**It’s 1994**. I’m working at Capitol Records in Hollywood, California.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1\\*3uWuMPCpGzv4K1TLTIS8tA.jpeg)\n\n*Pulp Fiction* was about to hit the box office and infiltrate pop culture with its timeless lines, some the music industry should have noted:\n\n“Look, do you wanna play blind man? Go walk with the shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fucking open.” —Jules Winnfield\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/576/1\\*vR6N7dm5y8u6kaXrECCvAg.jpeg)\n\nThe #1 song was “The Sign” by Ace of Base. They “saw the sign” and it *opened up their eyes.*\n\nPrince wouldn’t be partying for another 5 years.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/508/1\\*6dM9ADdLUiI34T8umrp2Bw.jpeg)\n\nAnd for the record business — well, they didn’t have anything to complain about. They printed money selling shiny plastic discs and virtually controlled everything from record stores to radio stations. Their marketing strategy of million dollar print, radio and TV campaigns was tried and true and as the saying goes, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It was the golden era of the music business and the good ‘ole boys, they liked to throw parties. I should know, I went to them.\n\nSo, during this “diamonds on the soles of their shoes” era, there was no vision for the future.\n\nThey didn’t think they needed one.\n\nAs for me, I had moved from Texas to Hollywood to pursue a glamorous career in rock & roll but things were going a lot slower than planned. After years of paying my dues as an assistant, I knew I needed to do something bold or I would be making photocopies and answering the phones for the rest of my career. This was the year that was  \\\\n finally gonna bring on the magic.\n\nWhat happened next was about to change music history.\n\n…………………………\n\n**This chain of events** started with a word that was soon to be all the rage: \\*multimedia—\\*a new way to combine music, video, graphics and interactivity using a computer.\n\nThe moment I realized that multimedia could revolutionize the way we could market our music came when a co-worker named Dave Goldberg showed me the first music video made with Macromedia Director—an interactive multimedia authoring tool. When I saw that video, I knew I had to hunt down the programmer. His name was Doug Textor, and he agreed to meet me for breakfast. I told him that I had all these ideas for using the computer to promote our bands but I didn’t know if it was technically possible yet. He said it was, although I don’t think he knew exactly what it entailed, but neither did anyone else at the time.\n\nOur harebrained concepts were put to the test when I was tasked with marketing the upcoming album releases for Frank Sinatra and Bonnie Raitt. Using Director, we created these hilarious-yet-primitive video games that my boss presented to the sales team while I operated the computer. Despite a few head scratches, the game broke new ground and we actually won an award.\n\nWe knew we were onto something…\n\n![Capitol Records Senior Vice President Lou Mann presents the Frank Sinatra Duets Game “Jeopairdy” to the Los Angeles Sales Branch 1994](https://miro.medium.com/max/6514/1\\*aEJGGmxOHfNzZQdj6WAjTw.jpeg)\n\nAfter these multimedia presentations, I wanted to try some more experiments, as there was a blank canvas to innovate. Two online services, Prodigy and CompuServe, were quickly becoming popular and so were screensavers. We created one for the Beastie Boys and uploaded it into the software and gaming forums to see what would happen. We also put the screensavers on floppy disks with a whopping 1.5 meg of disk space, not even room for a single song.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1\\*e9GQJQBAii-iDdfyaIp39A.jpeg)\n\nAs the screensaver was getting momentum, I was about to get introduced to the Internet, thanks to a cousin I barely knew living in Silicon Valley. He was referred to in our family as a cocky computer genius who loved *his* Steve Jobs. One night we met up in San Francisco where he took me to his office, which was a startup before I even knew what startups were. He showed off his NeXT computer.\n\nThen he showed me this thing called… the World Wide Web.\n\nAnd I knew.\n\nHoly shit.\n\n*This is it.*\n\n## **The Hollywood Handshake**\n\nWhen I returned to Hollywood, I had to explore this spectacle further, but actually getting \\*on \\*the World Wide Web was a technical bitch. If you understood computers back then, you were described as “computer-literate.” But it was even difficult for us “literates” to understand the new world of TCP/IP, PPP, Gopher and Telnet. Since I had real job responsibilities during the day, I would spend my nights alone in the Capitol Tower, just trying to get that damn computer to dial up a modem, in hopes of being rewarded with that glorious sound of the modem connecting. Back then, we tech geeks called it “the handshake.”\n\nI failed, but was still determined.\n\nOne day, I got a memo in “interoffice mail.” I was invited to be on a task force for the upcoming Megadeth album *Youthanasia* and I was to attend the first brainstorming meeting.\n\nMe? Megadeth?\n\nHere’s what I knew about Megadeth: the lead singer, Dave Mustaine, was kicked out of Metallica, and then Megadeth went on to become the most respected heavy metal band of their time, second to Metallica.\n\nDuring the meeting, the executives stressed the importance of this album release, so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do something big and bold on the World Wide Web. Having never heard of the Internet, the record executives were like “yeah, whatever kid” and defaulted to the usual checklist: “Who will shoot the album cover? How many radio stations will play the single? How many posters should we print for the record stores?”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/778/1\\*RQZhV3TK37a-R7jI9gnPiw.gif)\n\nSo even though no one had a clue what I was talking about, I wrote a proposal to create a “virtual cybertown in cyberspace.” It would be called Megadeth, Arizona—based on where the band lived and recorded their album.\n\nMy boss, Lou Mann, the Senior Vice President of the label, actually signed off on the proposal and gave me a whopping $30 grand.\n\nHe had no idea what it was for, and I can guarantee you… *neither did I.*\n\n![In the proposal, I describe the Internet as consisting of “intelligent, upwardly mobile people” amongst other verbal atrocities.

", "body": "## 20 years ago today, the first website for a band debuted in cyberspace\n\nRobin Bechtel  /  October 1, 2014\n\n*“The music industry’s first runaway hit on the web” — Interactive Age*\n\nThis is the story of how an unlikely threesome—a girl, a heavy metal band and their fans — pioneered the web at its infancy, bucked the status quo and proved that the Internet wasn’t a fad.\n\n**It’s 1994**. I’m working at Capitol Records in Hollywood, California.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1\\*3uWuMPCpGzv4K1TLTIS8tA.jpeg)\n\n*Pulp Fiction* was about to hit the box office and infiltrate pop culture with its timeless lines, some the music industry should have noted:\n\n“Look, do you wanna play blind man? Go walk with the shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fucking open.” —Jules Winnfield\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/576/1\\*vR6N7dm5y8u6kaXrECCvAg.jpeg)\n\nThe #1 song was “The Sign” by Ace of Base. They *saw the sign* and it *opened up their eyes.*\n\nPrince wouldn’t be partying for another 5 years.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/508/1\\*6dM9ADdLUiI34T8umrp2Bw.jpeg)\n\nAnd for the record business — well, they didn’t have anything to complain about. They printed money selling shiny plastic discs and virtually controlled everything from record stores to radio stations. Their marketing strategy of million dollar print, radio and TV campaigns was tried and true and as the saying goes, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It was the golden era of the music business and the good ‘ole boys, they liked to throw parties. I should know, I went to them.\n\nSo, during this “diamonds on the soles of their shoes” era, there was no vision for the future.\n\nThey didn’t think they needed one.\n\nAs for me, I had moved from Texas to Hollywood to pursue a glamorous career in rock & roll but things were going a lot slower than planned. After years of paying my dues as an assistant, I knew I needed to do something bold or I would be making photocopies and answering the phones for the rest of my career. This was the year that was  \\\\n finally gonna bring on the magic.\n\nWhat happened next was about to change music history.\n\n…………………………\n\n**This chain of events** started with a word that was soon to be all the rage: *multimedia*—a new way to combine music, video, graphics and interactivity using a computer.\n\nThe moment I realized that multimedia could revolutionize the way we could market our music came when a co-worker named Dave Goldberg showed me the first music video made with Macromedia Director—an interactive multimedia authoring tool. When I saw that video, I knew I had to hunt down the programmer. His name was Doug Textor, and he agreed to meet me for breakfast. I told him that I had all these ideas for using the computer to promote our bands but I didn’t know if it was technically possible yet. He said it was, although I don’t think he knew exactly what it entailed, but neither did anyone else at the time.\n\nOur harebrained concepts were put to the test when I was tasked with marketing the upcoming album releases for Frank Sinatra and Bonnie Raitt. Using Director, we created these hilarious-yet-primitive video games that my boss presented to the sales team while I operated the computer. Despite a few head scratches, the game broke new ground and we actually won an award.\n\nWe knew we were onto something…\n\n![Capitol Records Senior Vice President Lou Mann presents the Frank Sinatra Duets Game “Jeopairdy” to the Los Angeles Sales Branch 1994](https://miro.medium.com/max/6514/1\\*aEJGGmxOHfNzZQdj6WAjTw.jpeg)\n\nAfter these multimedia presentations, I wanted to try some more experiments, as there was a blank canvas to innovate. Two online services, Prodigy and CompuServe, were quickly becoming popular and so were screensavers. We created one for the Beastie Boys and uploaded it into the software and gaming forums to see what would happen. We also put the screensavers on floppy disks with a whopping 1.5 meg of disk space, not even room for a single song.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1\\*e9GQJQBAii-iDdfyaIp39A.jpeg)\n\nAs the screensaver was getting momentum, I was about to get introduced to the Internet, thanks to a cousin I barely knew living in Silicon Valley. He was referred to in our family as a cocky computer genius who loved *his* Steve Jobs. One night we met up in San Francisco where he took me to his office, which was a startup before I even knew what startups were. He showed off his NeXT computer.\n\nThen he showed me this thing called… the World Wide Web.\n\nAnd I knew.\n\nHoly shit.\n\n*This is it.*\n\n## **The Hollywood Handshake**\n\nWhen I returned to Hollywood, I had to explore this spectacle further, but actually getting on the World Wide Web was a technical bitch. If you understood computers back then, you were described as “computer-literate.” But it was even difficult for us “literates” to understand the new world of TCP/IP, PPP, Gopher and Telnet. Since I had real job responsibilities during the day, I would spend my nights alone in the Capitol Tower, just trying to get that damn computer to dial up a modem, in hopes of being rewarded with that glorious sound of the modem connecting. Back then, we tech geeks called it “the handshake.”\n\nI failed, but was still determined.\n\nOne day, I got a memo in “interoffice mail.” I was invited to be on a task force for the upcoming Megadeth album *Youthanasia* and I was to attend the first brainstorming meeting.\n\nMe? Megadeth?\n\nHere’s what I knew about Megadeth: the lead singer, Dave Mustaine, was kicked out of Metallica, and then Megadeth went on to become the most respected heavy metal band of their time, second to Metallica.\n\nDuring the meeting, the executives stressed the importance of this album release, so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do something big and bold on the World Wide Web. Having never heard of the Internet, the record executives were like “yeah, whatever kid” and defaulted to the usual checklist: “Who will shoot the album cover? How many radio stations will play the single? How many posters should we print for the record stores?”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/778/1\\*RQZhV3TK37a-R7jI9gnPiw.gif)\n\nSo even though no one had a clue what I was talking about, I wrote a proposal to create a “virtual cybertown in cyberspace.” It would be called Megadeth, Arizona—based on where the band lived and recorded their album.\n\nMy boss, Lou Mann, the Senior Vice President of the label, actually signed off on the proposal and gave me a whopping $30 grand.\n\nHe had no idea what it was for, and I can guarantee you… *neither did I.*\n\n![In the proposal, I describe the Internet as consisting of “intelligent, upwardly mobile people” amongst other verbal atrocities. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RN4JsDEYu6wt7jA9w8Iel.jpeg?height=1419&width=2000)\n\nNow that I was funded, I corralled two of my co-workers to help create the site—Wendy Dougan, who was designing CD album packages in the art department, and Jane Bogart, the company copywriter for those full page ads that bands used to put in magazines.\n\n*They did not know what the Internet was either.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*UGCUaYnD1gihIY8ESL9AGA.jpeg)\n\nWendy found a book on Roadside America that set the creative direction. We found a 1940’s postcard at a flea market that read “Greetings from Arizona.”\n\nJane came up with a tag line: Megadeth, Arizona: *You’ve never been anywhere like it.*\n\n![Yahoo’s homepage— originally called Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*Tki7PQ2QmQEaWtdawHWTkw.jpeg)\n\nThere were three main design options for the web at the time:\n\n1\\. Grey backgrounds\n\n2\\. Times Roman type\n\n3\\. Graphics were buttons\n\nFor content, we assumed a band website would offer the basics like news, music and video.\n\n**MEGABYTE NEWS** — band news\n\n**K-DETH 101** — :30 second music clips\n\n**THE DIGITAL DRIVE IN**—slow moving video clips\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*JCSSmKy6rt9IpnWa0Il8JA.jpeg)\n\nLike any town, we thought it should spread gossip, deliver the mail and conduct town meetings, so we created a few “Internet firsts” like:\n\nA CHATROOM— The Megadiner was the first chatroom for a band. Fans could chat with each other 24–7 and the band would frequently join in, unannounced.\n\nA DIGITAL POSTCARD—This was one of the first applications where one could send a graphic via email, which programmers told us was technically impossible. We took the Megadeth, Arizona postcard and added a form where you could type in a friend’s email address (if they had one, that is) and add a custom message: “Hey Bob! Greetings from Megadeth, Arizona. Wish you were here!” The idea for the digital postcard was inspired by a job I had selling greeting cards. (Who knew that job would come in handy?)\n\n![To promote the website, we made postcards and stickers, because that’s how traditional marketing was done — using people to pass out pieces of paper.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*3GEQaqEAfA8JbgIdjbiGNA.jpeg)\n\nRight before the site launched, I started to panic. Is this any good? Is the band going to hate it? Will heavy metal fans revolt?\n\nBut at the same time, we didn’t think any of that mattered, because we didn’t think anyone would even see it.\n\nThen we went live.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*xoAVHI-Lsol3blnMXn0Siw.jpeg)\n\nEven though I was sure about the web’s potential, I couldn’t even begin to predict what was about to happen. It was the people who came to the site and populated it that made the technology come alive.\n\nAfter that, everything took a life of its own.\n\n## The Flying Roasters\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*KarcDOzvkT8Pom4yddP9YQ.jpeg)\n\nWhen the site hit the mainstream, it got the attention of Starbucks. Company CEO, Howard Shultz and his executive team asked to meet with Capitol Records to see what they could learn, so that they too could have a website. I presented a screensaver called The Flying Roasters, which paid homage to the most popular screensaver at the time—The Flying Toasters. We took Starbucks coffee bags, added wings and had them fly across the home screen to the song “Cantaloop” by US3. During the presentation, Howard, who clearly had visions of the future dancin’ in his head, grabbed my arm and nearly pulled me onto the floor. He grabbed all of the screensavers off the conference room table and tried to squeeze them into his top shirt pocket.\n\nIt took outside validation from Starbucks for the Capitol executives to see that our own company was leading the way.\n\nBy the time Howard had touched down in Seattle, my salary had doubled.\n\n## ‘Til Deth Do We (Didn’t) Part\n\nAt the height of Megadeth, Arizona’s popularity, Capitol wanted to close down the site because the band’s album cycle was ending—still living in a world of limited promotional flights and expiring campaigns. Can you imagine shutting down a popular site today?\n\n![Interactive Age 1995. I pitched this story about the fans “rebelling,” in hopes that Capitol would let me keep the site up.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PDTLvE9akYIbFrMUt3zFig.jpeg)\n\n## Things We Never Could Have Predicted About Megadeth, Arizona\n\n## 1. The site drove interest in computers\n\nWe got emails from people telling us that the site inspired them to buy computers, modems or get Internet connections.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1284/1\\*ZsXfZ3XEKHiW_y8N9KBdug.jpeg)\n\n## 2. The site helped put the Internet on the mainstream media’s radar\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1256/1\\*_QwORul9rv3QYUzQ4ZlWtw.png)\n\n## 3. Megadeth, Arizona opened the door for bands to market on the Internet\n\n“This groundbreaking site set the tone for artist sites to come.” *— Music Connection*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/864/1\\*MDzmdrMzL1prr1p7ZSdFpw.png)\n\n## 4. This Internet thing—it’s global!\n\n![ I still have no idea what this says.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FXYo7wETKQRntrDFYpWmFw.jpeg)\n\n## 5. This would be the birth of social media\n\n“One of the first online communities”— *LA Times*\n\n“One of the first webchats” — Wired\n\nThe site gave the fans the ability to talk to each other, meet one another in person and bond all based on a common interest — *their favorite band*. Some dated and got married. A woman complained she got “the clap” from another fan after they advanced their relationship from the web to the real world. Whoops, sorry. We’re not liable!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1282/1\\*cF-zqri8-QhhZChWQUTk7w.jpeg)\n\n## 6. Unprecedented access to celebrities\n\n“Dave Mustaine used the web to reach out to his fans—but that brought its own complications. When he first ventured into his site’s chatroom, none of the fans believed he was who he said he was. Once they realized it was him, they wouldn’t leave him alone.” —Rolling Stone\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*56j_OlHfoPIZgR0vIhiaDg.jpeg)\n\nBack then, the rock star was bigger than life—distant and inaccessible. The site allowed the band to interact with a large number of fans at once—raw, intimate and unfiltered. For the fans, being able to chat with the band seemed so unbelievable at first, that they would put them through a verification process.\n\n![The Megadiner chatroom transcript. Fans grilling Dave Mustaine (megaman) to verify his identity.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*4GlS2DfGoGyBTDwYY8_bXQ.png)\n\n![Electronic Entertainment / July 1995](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*eT0tP6IHo1mDPyYHGs55Eg.jpeg)\n\nThe band also rallied their fans to help with various missions, motivating them with a digital name — The CyberArmy. These are all early examples of how social media is used today.\n\n## 7. The beginning of “going viral”\n\nI didn’t realize while creating the digital postcard, that when people would send one to a friend — their friend would also learn about the website. You could create one digital master of a concept, and people could spread the word for you— as if it was *their* idea. Goodbye print marketing, hello digital.\n\n## 8. The band were pioneers too\n\n“It’s the Wild, Wild West but we think we should go for it.”— *Megadeth*\n\nThe band embraced the website immediately and jumped right in. They were already into computers, so they were able to speak articulately about the web, which they viewed as a “modern version of tape trading.”\n\n“What is the Internet? What do you do? What is the goal? How does it work?” — Megadeth\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/988/1\\*x_QR3cb6EFT44xgknzN91w.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1010/1\\*znCkJ8TEWKH-UKbPFcs-Gg.png)\n\n**My proudest memory** of Megadeth, Arizona, was that the early site adopters, the band and the fans, myself and my web team and the early journalists—*together*, we made people believe that the Internet was here to stay.\n\n*And it did.*\n\nIf you are reading this story twenty years later and you were one of the early adopters of our town, we have frequently wondered if you’re still out there floating in cyberspace—albeit at a faster speed.\n\nIn 1994, no one could have predicted all the ways that we’d be using technology today. So imagine what you can create in the next 20 years.\n\nJust start somewhere. Believe and make others believe!\n\n![You see, this profession is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

The proposal](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RN4JsDEYu6wt7jA9w8Iel.jpeg?height=1419&width=2000)\n\nNow that I was funded, I corralled two of my co-workers to help create the site—Wendy Dougan, who was designing CD album packages in the art department, and Jane Bogart, the company copywriter for those full page ads that bands used to put in magazines.\n\n*They did not know what the Internet was either.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*UGCUaYnD1gihIY8ESL9AGA.jpeg)\n\nWendy found a book on Roadside America that set the creative direction. We found a 1940’s postcard at a flea market that read “Greetings from Arizona.”\n\nJane came up with a tag line: Megadeth, Arizona: *You’ve never been anywhere like it.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*Tki7PQ2QmQEaWtdawHWTkw.jpeg)\n\nYahoo’s homepage— originally called Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web.\n\nThere were three main design options for the web at the time:\n\n1\\. Grey backgrounds\n\n2\\. Times Roman type\n\n3\\. Graphics were buttons\n\nFor content, we assumed a band website would offer the basics like news, music and video.\n\n**MEGABYTE NEWS** — band news\n\n**K-DETH 101** — :30 second music clips\n\n**THE DIGITAL DRIVE IN**—slow moving video clips\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*JCSSmKy6rt9IpnWa0Il8JA.jpeg)\n\nLike any town, we thought it should spread gossip, deliver the mail and conduct town meetings, so we created a few “Internet firsts” like:\n\nA CHATROOM— The Megadiner was the first chatroom for a band. Fans could chat with each other 24–7 and the band would frequently join in, unannounced.\n\nA DIGITAL POSTCARD—This was one of the first applications where one could send a graphic via email, which programmers told us was technically impossible. We took the Megadeth, Arizona postcard and added a form where you could type in a friend’s email address (if they had one, that is) and add a custom message: “Hey Bob! Greetings from Megadeth, Arizona. Wish you were here!” The idea for the digital postcard was inspired by a job I had selling greeting cards. (Who knew that job would come in handy?)\n\n![To promote the website, we made postcards and stickers, because that’s how traditional marketing was done — using people to pass out pieces of paper.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*3GEQaqEAfA8JbgIdjbiGNA.jpeg)\n\nRight before the site launched, I started to panic. Is this any good? Is the band going to hate it? Will heavy metal fans revolt?\n\nBut at the same time, we didn’t think any of that mattered, because we didn’t think anyone would even see it.\n\nThen we went live.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*xoAVHI-Lsol3blnMXn0Siw.jpeg)\n\nEven though I was sure about the web’s potential, I couldn’t even begin to predict what was about to happen. It was the people who came to the site and populated it that made the technology come alive.\n\nAfter that, everything took a life of its own.\n\n## The Flying Roasters\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*KarcDOzvkT8Pom4yddP9YQ.jpeg)\n\nWhen the site hit the mainstream, it got the attention of Starbucks. Company CEO, Howard Shultz and his executive team asked to meet with Capitol Records to see what they could learn, so that they too could have a website. I presented a screensaver called The Flying Roasters, which paid homage to the most popular screensaver at the time—The Flying Toasters. We took Starbucks coffee bags, added wings and had them fly across the home screen to the song “Cantaloop” by US3. During the presentation, Howard, who clearly had visions of the future dancin’ in his head, grabbed my arm and nearly pulled me onto the floor. He grabbed all of the screensavers off the conference room table and tried to squeeze them into his top shirt pocket.\n\nIt took outside validation from Starbucks for the Capitol executives to see that our own company was leading the way.\n\nBy the time Howard had touched down in Seattle, my salary had doubled.\n\n## ‘Til Deth Do We (Didn’t) Part\n\nAt the height of Megadeth, Arizona’s popularity, Capitol wanted to close down the site because the band’s album cycle was ending—still living in a world of limited promotional flights and expiring campaigns. Can you imagine shutting down a popular site today?\n\n![Interactive Age 1995. I pitched this story about the fans “rebelling,” in hopes that Capitol would let me keep the site up.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PDTLvE9akYIbFrMUt3zFig.jpeg)\n\n## Things We Never Could Have Predicted About Megadeth, Arizona\n\n## 1.

They printed money selling shiny plastic discs and virtually controlled everything from record stores to radio stations. Their marketing strategy of million dollar print, radio and TV campaigns was tried and true and as the saying goes, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It was the golden era of the music business and the good ‘ole boys, they liked to throw parties. I should know, I went to them.\n\nSo, during this “diamonds on the soles of their shoes” era, there was no vision for the future.\n\nThey didn’t think they needed one.\n\nAs for me, I had moved from Texas to Hollywood to pursue a glamorous career in rock & roll but things were going a lot slower than planned. After years of paying my dues as an assistant, I knew I needed to do something bold or I would be making photocopies and answering the phones for the rest of my career. This was the year that was  \\\\n finally gonna bring on the magic.\n\nWhat happened next was about to change music history.\n\n…………………………\n\n**This chain of events** started with a word that was soon to be all the rage: *multimedia*—a new way to combine music, video, graphics and interactivity using a computer.\n\nThe moment I realized that multimedia could revolutionize the way we could market our music came when a co-worker named Dave Goldberg showed me the first music video made with Macromedia Director—an interactive multimedia authoring tool. When I saw that video, I knew I had to hunt down the programmer. His name was Doug Textor, and he agreed to meet me for breakfast. I told him that I had all these ideas for using the computer to promote our bands but I didn’t know if it was technically possible yet. He said it was, although I don’t think he knew exactly what it entailed, but neither did anyone else at the time.\n\nOur harebrained concepts were put to the test when I was tasked with marketing the upcoming album releases for Frank Sinatra and Bonnie Raitt. Using Director, we created these hilarious-yet-primitive video games that my boss presented to the sales team while I operated the computer. Despite a few head scratches, the game broke new ground and we actually won an award.\n\nWe knew we were onto something…\n\n![Capitol Records Senior Vice President Lou Mann presents the Frank Sinatra Duets Game “Jeopairdy” to the Los Angeles Sales Branch 1994](https://miro.medium.com/max/6514/1\\*aEJGGmxOHfNzZQdj6WAjTw.jpeg?size=large)\n\nAfter these multimedia presentations, I wanted to try some more experiments, as there was a blank canvas to innovate. Two online services, Prodigy and CompuServe, were quickly becoming popular and so were screensavers. We created one for the Beastie Boys and uploaded it into the software and gaming forums to see what would happen. We also put the screensavers on floppy disks with a whopping 1.5 meg of disk space, not even room for a single song.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1\\*e9GQJQBAii-iDdfyaIp39A.jpeg)\n\nAs the screensaver was getting momentum, I was about to get introduced to the Internet, thanks to a cousin I barely knew living in Silicon Valley. He was referred to in our family as a cocky computer genius who loved *his* Steve Jobs. One night we met up in San Francisco where he took me to his office, which was a startup before I even knew what startups were. He showed off his NeXT computer.\n\nThen he showed me this thing called… the World Wide Web.\n\nAnd I knew.\n\nHoly shit.\n\n*This is it.*\n\n## **The Hollywood Handshake**\n\nWhen I returned to Hollywood, I had to explore this spectacle further, but actually getting on the World Wide Web was a technical bitch. If you understood computers back then, you were described as “computer-literate.” But it was even difficult for us “literates” to understand the new world of TCP/IP, PPP, Gopher and Telnet. Since I had real job responsibilities during the day, I would spend my nights alone in the Capitol Tower, just trying to get that damn computer to dial up a modem, in hopes of being rewarded with that glorious sound of the modem connecting. Back then, we tech geeks called it “the handshake.”\n\nI failed, but was still determined.\n\nOne day, I got a memo in “interoffice mail.” I was invited to be on a task force for the upcoming Megadeth album *Youthanasia* and I was to attend the first brainstorming meeting.\n\nMe? Megadeth?\n\nHere’s what I knew about Megadeth: the lead singer, Dave Mustaine, was kicked out of Metallica, and then Megadeth went on to become the most respected heavy metal band of their time, second to Metallica.\n\nDuring the meeting, the executives stressed the importance of this album release, so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do something big and bold on the World Wide Web. Having never heard of the Internet, the record executives were like “yeah, whatever kid” and defaulted to the usual checklist: “Who will shoot the album cover? How many radio stations will play the single? How many posters should we print for the record stores?”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/778/1\\*RQZhV3TK37a-R7jI9gnPiw.gif)\n\nSo even though no one had a clue what I was talking about, I wrote a proposal to create a “virtual cybertown in cyberspace.” It would be called Megadeth, Arizona—based on where the band lived and recorded their album.\n\nMy boss, Lou Mann, the Senior Vice President of the label, actually signed off on the proposal and gave me a whopping $30 grand.\n\nHe had no idea what it was for, and I can guarantee you… *neither did I.*\n\n![In the proposal, I describe the Internet as consisting of “intelligent, upwardly mobile people” amongst other verbal atrocities. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RN4JsDEYu6wt7jA9w8Iel.jpeg?height=1419&width=2000)\n\nNow that I was funded, I corralled two of my co-workers to help create the site—Wendy Dougan, who was designing CD album packages in the art department, and Jane Bogart, the company copywriter for those full page ads that bands used to put in magazines.\n\n*They did not know what the Internet was either.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*UGCUaYnD1gihIY8ESL9AGA.jpeg)\n\nWendy found a book on Roadside America that set the creative direction.

I should know, I went to them.\n\nSo, during this “diamonds on the soles of their shoes” era, there was no vision for the future.\n\nThey didn’t think they needed one.\n\nAs for me, I had moved from Texas to Hollywood to pursue a glamorous career in rock & roll but things were going a lot slower than planned. After years of paying my dues as an assistant, I knew I needed to do something bold or I would be making photocopies and answering the phones for the rest of my career. This was the year that was  \\\\n finally gonna bring on the magic.\n\nWhat happened next was about to change music history.\n\n…………………………\n\n**This chain of events** started with a word that was soon to be all the rage: *multimedia*—a new way to combine music, video, graphics and interactivity using a computer.\n\nThe moment I realized that multimedia could revolutionize the way we could market our music came when a co-worker named Dave Goldberg showed me the first music video made with Macromedia Director—an interactive multimedia authoring tool. When I saw that video, I knew I had to hunt down the programmer. His name was Doug Textor, and he agreed to meet me for breakfast. I told him that I had all these ideas for using the computer to promote our bands but I didn’t know if it was technically possible yet. He said it was, although I don’t think he knew exactly what it entailed, but neither did anyone else at the time.\n\nOur harebrained concepts were put to the test when I was tasked with marketing the upcoming album releases for Frank Sinatra and Bonnie Raitt. Using Director, we created these hilarious-yet-primitive video games that my boss presented to the sales team while I operated the computer. Despite a few head scratches, the game broke new ground and we actually won an award.\n\nWe knew we were onto something…\n\n![Capitol Records Senior Vice President Lou Mann presents the Frank Sinatra Duets Game “Jeopairdy” to the Los Angeles Sales Branch 1994](https://miro.medium.com/max/6514/1\\*aEJGGmxOHfNzZQdj6WAjTw.jpeg?&size=large)\n\nAfter these multimedia presentations, I wanted to try some more experiments, as there was a blank canvas to innovate. Two online services, Prodigy and CompuServe, were quickly becoming popular and so were screensavers. We created one for the Beastie Boys and uploaded it into the software and gaming forums to see what would happen. We also put the screensavers on floppy disks with a whopping 1.5 meg of disk space, not even room for a single song.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1\\*e9GQJQBAii-iDdfyaIp39A.jpeg)\n\nAs the screensaver was getting momentum, I was about to get introduced to the Internet, thanks to a cousin I barely knew living in Silicon Valley. He was referred to in our family as a cocky computer genius who loved *his* Steve Jobs. One night we met up in San Francisco where he took me to his office, which was a startup before I even knew what startups were. He showed off his NeXT computer.\n\nThen he showed me this thing called… the World Wide Web.\n\nAnd I knew.\n\nHoly shit.\n\n*This is it.*\n\n## **The Hollywood Handshake**\n\nWhen I returned to Hollywood, I had to explore this spectacle further, but actually getting on the World Wide Web was a technical bitch. If you understood computers back then, you were described as “computer-literate.” But it was even difficult for us “literates” to understand the new world of TCP/IP, PPP, Gopher and Telnet. Since I had real job responsibilities during the day, I would spend my nights alone in the Capitol Tower, just trying to get that damn computer to dial up a modem, in hopes of being rewarded with that glorious sound of the modem connecting. Back then, we tech geeks called it “the handshake.”\n\nI failed, but was still determined.\n\nOne day, I got a memo in “interoffice mail.” I was invited to be on a task force for the upcoming Megadeth album *Youthanasia* and I was to attend the first brainstorming meeting.\n\nMe? Megadeth?\n\nHere’s what I knew about Megadeth: the lead singer, Dave Mustaine, was kicked out of Metallica, and then Megadeth went on to become the most respected heavy metal band of their time, second to Metallica.\n\nDuring the meeting, the executives stressed the importance of this album release, so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do something big and bold on the World Wide Web. Having never heard of the Internet, the record executives were like “yeah, whatever kid” and defaulted to the usual checklist: “Who will shoot the album cover? How many radio stations will play the single? How many posters should we print for the record stores?”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/778/1\\*RQZhV3TK37a-R7jI9gnPiw.gif)\n\nSo even though no one had a clue what I was talking about, I wrote a proposal to create a “virtual cybertown in cyberspace.” It would be called Megadeth, Arizona—based on where the band lived and recorded their album.\n\nMy boss, Lou Mann, the Senior Vice President of the label, actually signed off on the proposal and gave me a whopping $30 grand.\n\nHe had no idea what it was for, and I can guarantee you… *neither did I.*\n\n![In the proposal, I describe the Internet as consisting of “intelligent, upwardly mobile people” amongst other verbal atrocities. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RN4JsDEYu6wt7jA9w8Iel.jpeg?height=1419&width=2000)\n\nNow that I was funded, I corralled two of my co-workers to help create the site—Wendy Dougan, who was designing CD album packages in the art department, and Jane Bogart, the company copywriter for those full page ads that bands used to put in magazines.\n\n*They did not know what the Internet was either.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*UGCUaYnD1gihIY8ESL9AGA.jpeg)\n\nWendy found a book on Roadside America that set the creative direction. We found a 1940’s postcard at a flea market that read “Greetings from Arizona.”\n\nJane came up with a tag line: Megadeth, Arizona: *You’ve never been anywhere like it.*\n\n![Yahoo’s homepage— originally called Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*Tki7PQ2QmQEaWtdawHWTkw.jpeg)\n\nThere were three main design options for the web at the time:\n\n1\\. Grey backgrounds\n\n2\\. Times Roman type\n\n3\\. Graphics were buttons\n\nFor content, we assumed a band website would offer the basics like news, music and video.\n\n**MEGABYTE NEWS** — band news\n\n**K-DETH 101** — :30 second music clips\n\n**THE DIGITAL DRIVE IN**—slow moving video clips\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*JCSSmKy6rt9IpnWa0Il8JA.jpeg)\n\nLike any town, we thought it should spread gossip, deliver the mail and conduct town meetings, so we created a few “Internet firsts” like:\n\nA CHATROOM— The Megadiner was the first chatroom for a band. Fans could chat with each other 24–7 and the band would frequently join in, unannounced.\n\nA DIGITAL POSTCARD—This was one of the first applications where one could send a graphic via email, which programmers told us was technically impossible. We took the Megadeth, Arizona postcard and added a form where you could type in a friend’s email address (if they had one, that is) and add a custom message: “Hey Bob! Greetings from Megadeth, Arizona. Wish you were here!” The idea for the digital postcard was inspired by a job I had selling greeting cards. (Who knew that job would come in handy?)\n\n![To promote the website, we made postcards and stickers, because that’s how traditional marketing was done — using people to pass out pieces of paper.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*3GEQaqEAfA8JbgIdjbiGNA.jpeg)\n\nRight before the site launched, I started to panic. Is this any good? Is the band going to hate it? Will heavy metal fans revolt?\n\nBut at the same time, we didn’t think any of that mattered, because we didn’t think anyone would even see it.\n\nThen we went live.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*xoAVHI-Lsol3blnMXn0Siw.jpeg)\n\nEven though I was sure about the web’s potential, I couldn’t even begin to predict what was about to happen. It was the people who came to the site and populated it that made the technology come alive.\n\nAfter that, everything took a life of its own.\n\n…….\n\n## The Flying Roasters\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*KarcDOzvkT8Pom4yddP9YQ.jpeg)\n\nWhen the site hit the mainstream, it got the attention of Starbucks. Company CEO, Howard Shultz and his executive team asked to meet with Capitol Records to see what they could learn, so that they too could have a website. I presented a screensaver called The Flying Roasters, which paid homage to the most popular screensaver at the time—The Flying Toasters. We took Starbucks coffee bags, added wings and had them fly across the home screen to the song “Cantaloop” by US3. During the presentation, Howard, who clearly had visions of the future dancin’ in his head, grabbed my arm and nearly pulled me onto the floor. He grabbed all of the screensavers off the conference room table and tried to squeeze them into his top shirt pocket.\n\nIt took outside validation from Starbucks for the Capitol executives to see that our own company was leading the way.\n\nBy the time Howard had touched down in Seattle, my salary had doubled.\n\n## ‘Til Deth Do We (Didn’t) Part\n\nAt the height of Megadeth, Arizona’s popularity, Capitol wanted to close down the site because the band’s album cycle was ending—still living in a world of limited promotional flights and expiring campaigns. Can you imagine shutting down a popular site today?\n\n![Interactive Age 1995. I pitched this story about the fans “rebelling,” in hopes that Capitol would let me keep the site up.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PDTLvE9akYIbFrMUt3zFig.jpeg)\n\n## Things We Never Could Have Predicted About Megadeth, Arizona\n\n## 1. The site drove interest in computers\n\nWe got emails from people telling us that the site inspired them to buy computers, modems or get Internet connections.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1284/1\\*ZsXfZ3XEKHiW_y8N9KBdug.jpeg)\n\n## 2. The site helped put the Internet on the mainstream media’s radar\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1256/1\\*_QwORul9rv3QYUzQ4ZlWtw.png)\n\n## 3. Megadeth, Arizona opened the door for bands to market on the Internet\n\n“This groundbreaking site set the tone for artist sites to come.” *— Music Connection*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/864/1\\*MDzmdrMzL1prr1p7ZSdFpw.png)\n\n## 4. This Internet thing—it’s global!\n\n![ I still have no idea what this says.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FXYo7wETKQRntrDFYpWmFw.jpeg)\n\n## 5. This would be the birth of social media\n\n“One of the first online communities”— *LA Times*\n\n“One of the first webchats” — Wired\n\nThe site gave the fans the ability to talk to each other, meet one another in person and bond all based on a common interest — *their favorite band*. Some dated and got married. A woman complained she got “the clap” from another fan after they advanced their relationship from the web to the real world. Whoops, sorry. We’re not liable!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1282/1\\*cF-zqri8-QhhZChWQUTk7w.jpeg)\n\n## 6. Unprecedented access to celebrities\n\n“Dave Mustaine used the web to reach out to his fans—but that brought its own complications. When he first ventured into his site’s chatroom, none of the fans believed he was who he said he was. Once they realized it was him, they wouldn’t leave him alone.” —Rolling Stone\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*56j_OlHfoPIZgR0vIhiaDg.jpeg)\n\nBack then, the rock star was bigger than life—distant and inaccessible. The site allowed the band to interact with a large number of fans at once—raw, intimate and unfiltered. For the fans, being able to chat with the band seemed so unbelievable at first, that they would put them through a verification process.\n\n![The Megadiner chatroom transcript. Fans grilling Dave Mustaine (megaman) to verify his identity.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*4GlS2DfGoGyBTDwYY8_bXQ.png)\n\n![Electronic Entertainment / July 1995](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*eT0tP6IHo1mDPyYHGs55Eg.jpeg)\n\nThe band also rallied their fans to help with various missions, motivating them with a digital name — The CyberArmy. These are all early examples of how social media is used today.\n\n## 7. The beginning of “going viral”\n\nI didn’t realize while creating the digital postcard, that when people would send one to a friend — their friend would also learn about the website. You could create one digital master of a concept, and people could spread the word for you— as if it was *their* idea. Goodbye print marketing, hello digital.\n\n## 8. The band were pioneers too\n\n“It’s the Wild, Wild West but we think we should go for it.”— *Megadeth*\n\nThe band embraced the website immediately and jumped right in. They were already into computers, so they were able to speak articulately about the web, which they viewed as a “modern version of tape trading.”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/988/1\\*x_QR3cb6EFT44xgknzN91w.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1010/1\\*znCkJ8TEWKH-UKbPFcs-Gg.png)\n\n**My proudest memory** of Megadeth, Arizona, was that the early site adopters, the band and the fans, myself and my web team and the early journalists—*together*, we made people believe that the Internet was here to stay.\n\n*And it did.*\n\nIf you are reading this story twenty years later and you were one of the early adopters of our town, we have frequently wondered if you’re still out there floating in cyberspace—albeit at a faster speed.\n\nIn 1994, no one could have predicted all the ways that we’d be using technology today. So imagine what you can create in the next 20 years.\n\nJust start somewhere. Believe and make others believe!\n\n![You see, this profession is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

When he first ventured into his site’s chatroom, none of the fans believed he was who he said he was. Once they realized it was him, they wouldn’t leave him alone.” —Rolling Stone\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*56j_OlHfoPIZgR0vIhiaDg.jpeg)\n\nBack then, the rock star was bigger than life—distant and inaccessible. The site allowed the band to interact with a large number of fans at once—raw, intimate and unfiltered. For the fans, being able to chat with the band seemed so unbelievable at first, that they would put them through a verification process.\n\n![The Megadiner chatroom transcript. Fans grilling Dave Mustaine (megaman) to verify his identity.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*4GlS2DfGoGyBTDwYY8_bXQ.png)\n\n![Electronic Entertainment / July 1995](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*eT0tP6IHo1mDPyYHGs55Eg.jpeg)\n\nThe band also rallied their fans to help with various missions, motivating them with a digital name — The CyberArmy. These are all early examples of how social media is used today.\n\n## 7. The beginning of “going viral”\n\nI didn’t realize while creating the digital postcard, that when people would send one to a friend — their friend would also learn about the website. You could create one digital master of a concept, and people could spread the word for you— as if it was *their* idea. Goodbye print marketing, hello digital.\n\n## 8. The band were pioneers too\n\n“It’s the Wild, Wild West but we think we should go for it.”— *Megadeth*\n\nThe band embraced the website immediately and jumped right in. They were already into computers, so they were able to speak articulately about the web, which they viewed as a “modern version of tape trading.”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/988/1\\*x_QR3cb6EFT44xgknzN91w.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1010/1\\*znCkJ8TEWKH-UKbPFcs-Gg.png)\n\n**My proudest memory** of Megadeth, Arizona, was that the early site adopters, the band and the fans, myself and my web team and the early journalists—*together*, we made people believe that the Internet was here to stay.\n\n*And it did.*\n\nIf you are reading this story twenty years later and you were one of the early adopters of our town, we have frequently wondered if you’re still out there floating in cyberspace—albeit at a faster speed.\n\nIn 1994, no one could have predicted all the ways that we’d be using technology today. So imagine what you can create in the next 20 years.\n\nJust start somewhere. Believe and make others believe!\n\n![You see, this profession is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

{"id": "PctI0ix9I-fZiaFvqzKA_FHL1ZyDuzG9bG7eR9t8-0U", "title": "DAOs para principiantes", "body": "La tecnología Blockchain ha dado origen a las criptomonedas, los NFTs, y ahora, a los DAOs, una nueva forma de organización para empresas y comunidades que se está propagando con una rápidez inusitada, con un entusiasmo contagioso, y sobre todo, con resultados sorprendentes.\n\n¿Por qué? Veamos.\n\nUna DAO es una organización autónoma descentralizada. Es decir, puede estar compuesta de dos, cinco, cien, o miles de personas, y todas y cada una de ellas pueden ser dueñas de la organización. Aquí entramos en la primera afirmación sorprendente. Todos los miembros pueden ser dueños si así es decidido. Y ser dueño implica recibir los beneficios de la empresa. Si le va bien, cada dueño gana.\n\n## ¿Cómo se logra esto?\n\nLa DAO se organiza en torno a un smart contract, que es nada más que un contrato digital que no necesita abogados, ni ningún tipo de asistencia externa. El contrato es generado por los fundadores de la empresa. Pero una vez creado, ya no necesita nada más. Aplica las reglas con las que fue hecho, y no hay fuerza en el mundo que lo obligue a cambiarlas. No aplican las reglas de ningún país, ya que está en la web, en todos lados del mundo y en ninguno al mismo tiempo. Solo aplican las reglas con las que fue creado.\n\nEn el smart contract se redactan las reglas de la empresa, su misión, la forma de tomar decisiones, y cómo se generan las propuestas. Debido a que tanto los fondos iniciales de la empresa como el contrato están ligados, nadie puede tomar decisiones sin respetar el contrato.\n\nEstos smart contracts pueden ser tan simples o complejos como se haya decidido programar. Pero los mismos quedarán transparentes e inmutables en el momento que sean publicados. Esto hará que todo el mundo pueda revisar su funcionamiento y las reglas que se han programado dentro, teniendo la seguridad de que no podrán ser modificados en el futuro.\n\nEsto permite varias cosas:\n\n**Transparencia:** Las votaciones, las decisiones de financiación y otras acciones son visibles para todos; Toda la comunidad tiene el control de todos los procesos.\n\n**Control:** Las DAO cuentan con un mecanismo que depende de la emisión de un token, que es un tipo de moneda interna de la empresa. Este tiene un valor derivado de las acciones de la empresa, similar a las acciones, pero además, permite que los miembros que lo tengan puedan votar en las decisiones de la empresa. Esto significa que una DAO puede tener miles de dueños con diferentes niveles de poder de votación.\n\n**Barato:** Hay muchas herramientas gratuitas para construir una DAO, entre ellas Aragon, DaoHaus, y Colony, por lo que la inversión inicial es simbólica.\n\n**Colaboración:** Dar voz a todo el mundo agrupa el conocimiento masivo para una propuesta y permite a los expertos invertir en el ecosistema que están construyendo. Una DAO permite generar una empresa internacional sin todo el papeleo, y con reglas claras para todos.\n\n**Para siempre:** A diferencia de otras empresas, en una DAO todos son dueños de los tokens que ya se les han sido asignados. Funcionan como acciones. Y seguirán proporcionando beneficios incluso cuando la persona ya no pertenezca a la empresa.\n\n## Ejemplo básico de una DAO\n\nHay muchas formas de ilustrar cómo podría usarse una DAO. Y muchos ejemplos de comunidades que pueden beneficiarse constituyendose como tales. Pero para entender en funcionamiento, veamos un escenario sencillo: una asociación de vecinos. En una asociación de vecinos tradicional cada familia paga unas cuotas anuales, las cuales se utilizan para hacer frente al pago de diferentes averías y mejoras en la comunidad.\n\nUtilizando un smart contract todos los vecinos podrían depositar los fondos en forma de criptomonedas. Estos fondos no estarían en mano de una sola persona, ni de dos, sino que estarían en mano de todos y de nadie al mismo tiempo. El smart contract los tendría bloqueados a la espera de una toma de decisiones democrática, quedando visibles de forma transparente pero sin que nadie los pueda usar como desee.\n\nA cada nuevo gasto (reparación o mejora, por ejemplo) se generaría una petición, asociando posteriormente los diferentes presupuestos que los proveedores envíen. Tras ello los vecinos podrían decidir durante un plazo determinado de forma democrática el presupuesto que les interese, desbloqueando los fondos únicamente al presupuesto con mayor votación.\n\nDe esta forma no solo presupuestos de gastos, sino también partidas para mejoras, festividades e incluso la gestión y el reparto de beneficios de las áreas de ocio de zonas comunes podrían gestionarse de forma democrática, transparente e inmutable con unas reglas conocidas por todos.", "timestamp": 1633484472, "digest": "_Jm0MESyOuEPTqfdx_2p5IT_q5YT99ClFte29bhWAOU", "contributor": "0x06Ce7AA062c3CfEF67152Ef45147213EE33D42A6"}

{"id": "8pxqcXIhURCVe6NnQuXQqil1T0y5ZcRaMQwqAesU20k", "title": "Chapter One: Lumi", "body": "Lumi roared into the the rain. She couldn’t hear her own voice , as it was drowned out by the torrential winds ripping at her shirt and through her hair. She kept yelling all the same, until her chest heaved and her breath was exhausted. And then she was quiet—no longer a lion, just a girl in a storm.\n\nNobody had taught her how to be brave, or how to deal with pain, so she’d taught herself. If she screamed loud enough, for long enough, the visions would fade. She hated the scattered memories that weren’t her own, the fractured images that meant nothing, but she could do nothing but stare into the always-grey sky.\n\nQuiet now, and drenched, Lumi began her slow walk back home. Her brother would be likely be waiting, back from another day of Labour, and worried sick. He didn’t like when Lumi walked alone at night. It didn’t matter to him that she’d grown up in Junction, or that she knew the streets as well as anyone.\n\nGritting her teeth, Lumi refused to cower, pushing forward into the surge instead of finding shelter and huddling for warmth.\n\nWhen she finally arrived at the bunker, the door slid open and her brother rushed out with a blanket. He tossed it around her shoulders and ushered her inside. Though Lumi wanted to shrug off the blanket and retreat to her room, she allowed her brother the fiction of a family relations.\n\nTheir family was tattered, and had been since their parents had failed to come home after a mission. Instead, a representative of the Republic had visited their door, offering a salute and a kind word.\n\n“Eat,” said Tru. He set a disc on their table. It was full with a beige substance, halfway between liquid and solid. “Sorry, only nutritionals today. It’s this war, Lumi. The Republic is driving Labour harder, yet credit allotments are stagnant.”\n\nShe sat, grabbed a spoon, and began shovelling the paste into her mouth. There was no taste—only texture—and she kept her expression vacant as she swallowed.\n\nTru grimaced. “Sorry,” he said again. He dug into his own muck and ate with the same excitement.\n\n“Don’t apologize,” said Lumi. “I’m the one who’s sorry. You were forced into your path, Tru, and it’s kept us alive. I’ll always be thankful.” She looked away, and wiped a tear from her eye.\n\n“Well, kid, look on the bright side: your path is wide open. Selection is soon, isn’t it?”\n\nLumi nodded. Her seventeenth birthday had come and gone, but the Republic couldn’t test individually—there were far too many wanderers in the world. Twice a year, the Republic sent an emissary to usher the wanderers into one of three paths: Labour, Thought, or War.\n\nThe Republic required the completion of many tasks, so most were designated to Labour. It was rare to be selected for the path of War, and Thought was even rarer.\n\nLumi’s parents had been warriors, though she didn’t know what that mean. Her parents had never spoken about their life in the Republic’s army. They’d not even wrote about it in their journal, Lumi’s most prized possession. She found it that day when the representative had come to her door with news of her parents’ deaths, when she’d raged around the bunker.\n\n“You want the path of war, don’t you?” asked Tru. He peered at her with crystal-green eyes, the same eyes she saw when she looked in a mirror, or at a picture of her parents.\n\nOf course she did. “I want to know what happened to them, Tru.” He put down his spoon and sat back. “Even if you’re selected for War, Lumi, I doubt you’re going to find any answers.”\n\nThey’d had this conversation before—many times. “You can’t know that.” “No, I can’t, but think about it, Lumi. Think—that’s what you’re really good at. Why would the Republic care about it? You think they’d allow one of their soldiers to go hunting for that kind of information? What would it mean to them, other than a waste of time and resources?”\n\nTru was right, but Lumi didn’t care. “I’m going to find out. They were special, Tru. I’ve seen the soldiers patrolling the streets, coming and going through Junction like we’re nothing but a harvest for selection. Our parents were different.” Her brother opened his mouth to reply, to continue the familiar debate, but Lumi heard nothing. Her vision had blurred, and her head began to throb so violently that she pushed in her temples as if she could force the pain away.\n\nImages began to dance in her mind. Figures in sleek, white metal jumping and rolling between rubble. Lights pulsing from limbs, explosions and blood. Lumi began to scream—to roar—and her voice echoed throughout the bunker. Tru was by her side in a second. Much too fast for a Labourer, she thought… \n\nShe awoke on her bed. Tru was mopping her head with a rag, his lips taught and eyes unmoving. “What did you see this time?” he asked.\n\n“I’ve seen it before,” Lumi answered. “It was the battle, with the white-metal fighters.” She closed her eyes, then squeezed them. “I saw the slaughter again.”\n\nTru placed the rag into a bowl of water, swirled it around, then wrung it out and continued mopping her head. For a time, he said nothing, and Lumi was grateful. She didn’t want to talk, or remember. She just wanted to sleep. \n\nEventually, her brother gripped her hand, then left the room, shutting the light as he went. Lumi rolled over, desperate to find comfort in slumber.

{"id": "GCRwh_Lgon6EmBEIH1y-56p9g-F0JB2lzc7AiEMUd4Y", "title": "Drugged By Algorithms", "body": "*Originally published on my substack in 2020.*\n\nIn most dystopian fiction, the overlords bend the population into submission by drugs, violence, fear or swoop into power after some landscape altering catastrophe or population-decimating contagion.\n\nIn the real version, circa 2020, the population opens their hearts and minds to the algorithms they keep in their pockets all day. The overlords simply have some low wage workers flood social platforms with endless conspiracy memes, put a little money into an advertising engine, slip a few fluent English speakers into some private groups to stoke some racism **and a population submits willingly to the forces that are destroying their communities, families and lives.**\n\nFor someone fascinated by the intersections of humanity and technology, a lover of dystopia and a former journalist, it doesn’t get much juicer than this. And honestly, if this were happening in another country, I may just go back to school and get a PHD based on this very scenario.\n\nBut no, I’m living in it. We’re all living in this hellscape of likes, retweets and shares. But we’re no longer talking about the mental impacts of dopamine hits from thumbs ups, now we’re talking about the real life consequences of people reading “freedom from mask” posts created by Russian bot farms halfway around the world and **people are going into public empowered to ignore science and data, putting entire communities at risk of death.**\n\nBecause a bot farm in Macedonia told them they’re “sheeple” for wearing a mask. When, ironically, they’re acting as sheep to the kleptocrats who are paying millions of dollars to place those memes in their timelines. **But the people don’t care. They’re high on the algorithms perpetual onslaught of manipulation.**\n\nScience be damned. Data be damned. Truth be damned. Human life? Ha! I’ve got my freedom, fuck your life. That’s the message people are sending when they enter a public space without a mask. **People are openly stating that they consume and are under the spell of the algorithms being manipulated by the kleptocracy of far off lands and they are totally cool with it.**\n\n> Walking into a public space without a mask in 2020 states openly, “I don’t care about your life. I don’t care about science. I don’t believe in truth. I believe what corporations and kleptocrats are paying to put in my timeline and I am acting on that disinformation. I will spread disease and death to you and your family because my timeline told me I was a strong patriot to go maskless.”\n\nIf you had told me 10 years ago that this would be my reality, and this is how my fellow countrymen would act and that my country would succumb to the kleptocrats willingly and openly, I would have become an expat faster then you can spell “renunciation”. I’ve deliberately lived a life of little regret, but I do strongly regret not moving to Paris 8 years ago because I was “in love”. In hindsight, that was a brutal mistake.\n\nThis 2020 reality is simply exhausting. **Imagine what this world might look like if three Silicon Valley CEOs had taken responsibility for the gravity of their platforms from day one.** Imagine the world we might be living in now if these brilliant minds had looked beyond revenue and user acquisition to see the possible impacts of their platforms on human behaviors and the fabrics of our democracies. And yes, they were young and stupid, but they had the money to hire the top ethics minds in the world to flesh out the possible scenarios and design accordingly. The only excuse for not doing so is profit. Profit over people.\n\nBut no. Instead we have children starting kindergarten on “Mute” at the kitchen tables while moms struggle to work their job from across the table. If they’re lucky. We have lines of cars that stretch for miles at local food banks across the country. We have 40 million or more people who believe a kleptocrat placed in power by Russia is saving their jobs, keeping them healthy, creating a booming economy and fighting off “antifa” in urban landscapes. **When, in reality, he is ensuring their jobs are gone forever, shifting the country’s wealth to a handful of elites, preparing to remove social safety nets like social security (using payroll tax elimination as the vehicle) and is stoking racial violence around the country to ensure he can stay in the White House for decades.**\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3eda3a-eff5-4d22-8c16-91cd80395de2_1080x1080.jpeg)\n\nMillions of people **believe the rantings of a lunatic are a secret language sending them coded messages of how to act in the world. Millions of people believe that Democrats are trafficking children and drinking their blood to stay in power.** When, quite literally, there are human trafficking operations running out of our border detention facilities complete with forced sterilization of brown and black women. Open crimes against humanity happening at the hands of this government, but sure, the Clintons are funneling trafficked children through the basement of a pizza joint in Maryland.\n\n> We are exhausted by all of this. And I’m fucking tired of being told to “look at the bright side. Find the good in humanity. This too shall pass.” I get it and I want to believe it. And some days I do.\n>\n> I want to believe in free and fair elections. But we don’t do that in America.\\*\\* I want to believe in free will and not harming the humans I share my community with. But we don’t do that in America.\\*\\* I want to believe that a peaceful transfer of power will happen in January to a government who believes in science, data and logic again. But we can’t do that in America.\n>\n> **We are drugged by the algorithms we now cling to as an escape mechanism or a life raft to a world that no longer exists. We are disillusioned by the myth that this democracy still functions and we’ll just “vote them out” on November 3rd.** We are closing our eyes to the reality we are facing because it is too damn overwhelming to understand. But that’s where we are.\n\nBy all means, VOTE!! \\*\\*Vote as though it’s the last time you can, because it might literally be the last time for decades. Vote. \\*\\*And walk into this election with your eyes wide open and without the illusion of the algorithms. We are in a kleptocratic government right now. The entire system is now designed for this type of “governance”. Such a system will not allow an election to change the reality it has created. Short of a landslide for Biden followed by massive strikes and protests, this administration will not relinquish power. They’ve been openly stating that for months.\n\n**Believe them.**\n\nBut please realize that we face a battle on multiple fronts that can not be brushed away by platitudes like, “if everyone actually votes things will change” or “the judicial system will save us” or “they can’t get away with that”.\n\n**They can. They will. And they are.**\n\nRight now, this government is using the “herd immunity” strategy to deal with this virus which predicts (based on MATH) that anywhere between 2 million and 6.5 million people will die to reach immunity (which is not guaranteed with this virus) and everyone is just accepting that reality. Because bars. Because shopping. Because bike ralleys. Because frat parties. Because freedom.\n\n**Because the algorithms have drugged the masses into accepting their exceptionalism and their freedom above the collective health and welfare of our entire society.**\n\nI don’t enjoy writing about this shit. I write about it as a mental health activity to release these thoughts out into the world, **hoping that someone, somewhere will read this and feel less alone**. Someone, somewhere will read these words and feel understood and heard.\n\nNot all of us are under the spell of the kleptocratic algorithm. Some of us are walking through 2020 with our eyes wide open. We’re terrified and we’re aware. And we are planning accordingly.\n\nWe are not under the spell of the kleptocratic algorithms and our eyes are wide open, but we are in the minority.", "timestamp": 1633487192, "digest": "6_4ntMPxWAHGZXR0fijY6pACdndsQGicdowZKkFnE2s", "contributor": "0x1ba3ef24bc64B22a80422678d4B6Ea85f0f92Bde"}

From this moment on, I was hooked.*\n\nFor those interested in the evolution of digital currencies, I highly recommend Steven Levy’s “[E-Money (It’s What I Want)](http://www.wired.com/1994/12/emoney/)” article from *Wired* way back in December 1994. It’s a great read, and presages many current developments.\n\nOne problem with cryptocurrencies that Levy just touches on briefly is **the problem of the double-spend**. In brief, when hard currencies are exchanged, the transaction can only happen in one place and at one time, but in the digital realm transactions do not involve the physical transfer of data. Rather, digital transactions technically involve the **copying** of data to another party, which leaves open the possibility that the original party can attempt to spend their digital currency twice.\n\nPut differently, someone can potentially attempt to broadcast two digital currency transactions at approximately the same time, using the same digital coins, but the parties receiving the transactions **have no incentive to agree that one transaction takes priority**. Before the arrival of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin, with its revelatory proof-of-work scheme, most solutions to the double-spend problem involved having a trusted third-party intermediary resolving double spends.\n\nInterestingly, copyright law faces the same double spend problem, in form of the first sale doctrine.\n\nThe first sale doctrine allows resales of copies of physical works such as books, DVDs and CDs, which otherwise would be precluded by the Copyright Act as in infringement of the original author’s exclusive right of distribution. It is embodied in Section 109 of the Copyright Act, which says:\n\n> the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord.\n\nThe first sale doctrine is why you can find used bookstores in every town, and buy used copies of the *Purple Rain* vinyl album on eBay or at a flea market.\n\nIn economic terms, physical copies are “[rivalrous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics))” assets — while being consumed by one person, it cannot be consumed by another person. By contrast, non-rivalrous goods — like broadcast television — can be consumed by many people at once.\n\nIn any event, while you can find used bookstores and music stores, good luck finding a used mp3 website. They don’t exist, or if they do, that site would be deemed to be engaged in copyright infringement. That’s because, as interpreted by the courts in recent years, **the first sale doctrine does not permit resales of digital content**.\n\nJack Browning recently posted [a great analysis](http://goo.gl/CD8jbC) on this blog regarding whether a new technology like the blockchain could revitalize the first sale doctrine under copyright law. Jack used a terrific analogy to explain the first sale doctrine, from the Hugh Jackman movie *The Prestige*. In the film, in order to create the illusion of teleportation, Jackman’s character — who had access to a cloning device only (just watch the movie, okay?) — had to murder his own duplicate each time one was created, so that there was only one copy in the world at any given time.\n\nIn the digital world, **the problem is that it is difficult to kill the original work when you sell the original version to a third party** — you are not effecting a physical transfer of your copy. Instead, what really happens is that you are making a copy of the work on a new computer, and the only way to get rid of the original is to delete it from the original location. To make sure that occurs, some trusted third party would have to ensure that the original copy was truly wiped from existence.\n\nSound familiar? ***It’s precisely the same issue cryptocurrencies face***, which was (many believe) solved by the blockchain. The only difference is that it the Copyright Act that prohibits making duplicates in the first, whereas when one double spends cryptocurrencies it is up to the market (or perhaps fraud or similar laws) to stop it.\n\nIn the *[Capitol Records, LLC v. ReDigi Inc.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11987243262728384575&q=redigi&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33)* case, ReDigi had created a system whereby it attempted to act as a trusted third party intermediary to eliminate the double spend of copies of a copyrighted piece of music, and thus to allow its users to take advantage of the first sale doctrine. It uploaded a seller’s music file to a cloud service, and then eliminated the copy on the seller’s computer, after which the buyer would download a copy of the file from the cloud and pay for it.\n\n**However, the court did not buy this approach**. The first sale doctrine, it said, does not allow this type of digital “transfer”, but rather only covers “material items, like records, that the copyright owner put into the stream of commerce.” The court believed that ReDigi was not distributing such material items but instead was “distributing reproductions of the copyrighted code embedded in new material objects.”\n\nJack’s analysis focused on whether the court in the *ReDigi* case would have reached a different result had the technology in front of it been based on blockchain technology, which arguably might provide a much more secure way of guaranteeing that multiple digital copies of a work are not in circulation. He concluded, I believe correctly, that this court would not have reached a different conclusion given the way the judge interpreted the Copyright Act’s language.\n\n\\*\\*But judicial interpretation is not the only path to change. \\*\\*In fact, the *ReDigi* court also said the following:\n\n> At base, ReDigi seeks judicial amendment of the Copyright Act to reach its desired policy outcome. However, “\\[s\\]ound policy, as well as history, supports \\[the Court’s\\] consistent deference to Congress when major technological innovations alter the market for copyrighted materials. Congress has the constitutional authority and the institutional ability to accommodate fully the varied permutations of competing interests that are inevitably implicated by such new technology.” … Such defence often counsels for a limited interpretation of copyright protection. However, here, the Court cannot of its own accord condone the wholesale application of the first sale defense to the digital sphere, particularly when Congress itself has declined to take that step.\n\nThe question then becomes whether the blockchain, or some similar approach, might provide enough certainty around digital transfers to persuade Congress that the first sale doctrine can be extended to cover such transfers, at least under certain circumstances. (Of course, this also flags a larger policy discussion: Do we *want* a robust secondary market in digital copies? In a world where streaming has largely overtaken holding digital copies for many forms of content, would this mark an advance or a retreat?)\n\nFrom a technological standpoint, however, **the blockchain on its own cannot solve copyright’s first sale doctrine problem for digital copies**. While a blockchain-based system can provide a potentially unassailable record of ownership of a particular copy of a work and the substitution of a second copy that for all intents and purposes *becomes* , some other system still has to be implemented to automatically remove or disable the prior copy, which still resides with the seller. Some entity still has to act as the ReDigi in the equation.\n\nUnless, that is, we can come up with a proof-of-work type of solution for digital resales as well. Some way for a decentralized network of peers to verify the deletion of the original copy and the creation of the new copy that’s replacing the original, perhaps in a shared database?\n\n**Any budding Satoshis out there who want to take on this problem?**", "timestamp": 1633488747, "digest": "9BiwBtfBBO-MG3iOVnVvUDVT31YzJnIoMDVfoKAr3uk", "contributor": "0x538fDC0055fCeCe2e55e327A7673F9887FBC29c7"}

It could be Engineering, Design, Marketing, Consulting or what have you. While folks coming into the “World of Product” from different backgrounds is a net-positive trend at large and in fact some of the best product managers that I know, did actually start out in other functions/roles before transitioning into product management. \n\nNow, why is that really the case ? is a topic that justifies deeper exploration in its own right, I believe at a high level it is a function of \"Genius of the AND\", where these folks embrace the goodness from both the functions across a number of dimensions at the same time - example folks from Design background might be naturally inclined to think about Usability AND Desirability, whereas someone from Business background might be equally comfortable thinking about Viability and Desirability, so on and so forth.\n\nNonetheless, landing into the world of products from other functions is not without its share of trade-offs and can leave one exposed to blindspots. One, not only needs to be aware of these blind spots but should also deliberately work towards covering these over time. Now, I agree that in the fullness of time all great PMs realize these gaps are and they tend to fix these, what if there was a way to accelerate this learning curve. \n\nWell, that is what I intend to do with this post, help you overcome some of the common blindspots experienced by people as they transition from other functions into the product management function. Without further ado, let’s dive in.\n\n**Single Sensing Mechanism To Multiple Sensing Mechanisms**\n\nWe as humans are not very good at evaluating risk, although we sub-consciously avert it at times. As professionals, we learn to apply risk in a relatively narrow context. For instance, if someone is a designer they would be excellent at evaluating risks associated with the user experience (UX) of the product, such as; would the users be able to figure out how to use it? In the same vein, if someone is an Engineer they would be great at evaluating risks pertaining to the technical feasibility of the product, effectively answering; Can something even be built or not, is it even possible yet? and same goes for other functions as well such as Finance, Business, Legal or what have you.\n\nThis is great, although this same strength can become a weakness when one transition into a product management role, as in the world of product, these risks are not just needed to be evaluated in isolation, but also in combination and then looked at from the lens of prioritization and trade-offs. How does one mitigates these risks in combination and in the correct order can be non-trivial and something that a lot of product folks tend to struggle with.\n\nBring along your superpower to masterfully evaluate single-threaded risks, but make sure it does not become a hammer with which you try to nail every problem. Be sure to evaluate multi-threaded risks across all dimensions of the product.\n\n**Analysis and Synthesis**\n\nZoom In, Drill Down, Dive In. all functions have an equivalent of this expression, effectively meaning to break things down into small pieces and more formally known as analysis. Inevitably all professionals irrespective of the functional specialization get well trained on doing analysis of one form or the other.\n\n* If you are in Marketing, Market Size Analysis\n* If you are in Engineering, Code Analysis\n* In Design, UX Analysis or Usability Analysis\n\nThe analysis is also valuable in the world of product, although something that is unique to the product function is **Synthesis**\n\ni.e thinking about the big picture, breaking it down into small pieces, and then building those small pieces first and after building the small pieces,  combining them again to get to the big picture. \n\n\n---\n\nThese are the two common blindspots experienced by people as they transition from other functions into the product management function. What others do you think should be included here in your opinion?", "timestamp": 1633489714, "digest": "QOhVC0xke2WQIaBClu--MrSYpcUFYiDhqr4dsBaIyOE", "contributor": "0xbd11fb423e2517A35A0C3a796E25DA44B9F03b25"}

{"id": "jp18_hnZR5ALKjXfOhJc6_hs_Pc8-6jqnzBIwmUgABE", "title": "MakerDAO Teardown: Burning all the way to the bank", "body": "Taking crypto to the next level requires broader investor buy-in—markets shouldn’t move on just memes and tweets, but on fundamental analysis.\n\nIn venture capital and on Wall Street, we evaluate an investment’s expected returns by forecasting the asset’s financial performance and assuming it trades at some multiple of revenue or EBITDA on exit.\n\nThe surprising aspect is that we can apply this exact framework to many revenue-generating protocols to create an investment case for the traditional investor. In this post, I’ll give a teardown on MakerDAO.\n\n### **What is Maker?**\n\nI’ll stick to the basics here, but if you’re interested in going deeper, [check out these resources](https://awesome.makerdao.com/#faqs).\n\n* **Maker is a platform for taking out collateralized loans on your crypto.** Users collateralize assets into a vault, creating a collateralized debt position or “CDP”, at a rate of 150% or greater, and receive a USD pegged stablecoin, DAI. Interest accrues on your loan at a rate denominated by the owners of the MKR token (*through a token vote*), and that interest (*the stability fee*) is paid by the user at the time of closing out their loan.\n* **Why does it matter?** Users can maintain exposure to price appreciation in their assets (*i.e. not sell ETH*) while gaining liquidity that can be used for daily expenses (*i.e. working capital*) or leverage.\n* **What can you do with DAI?** There are billions of dollars in DAI liquidity. It can be used across the crypto ecosystem, exchanged for fiat USD on an exchange, and hopefully spent for real world purchases with spend cards in the not too distant future.\n* **Where does Maker store the deposits?** As a bank would historically store your capital within the metal doors of a vault, Maker stores your capital in cryptographically protected code (*smart contracts built on Ethereum*).\n* **How do Maker and its owners make money?** Interest, but not with the traditional mechanism. When a user closes their position to reclaim the crypto stored in Maker, they pay the accumulated interest by ‘burning’ the dollar equivalent of the amount owed in MKR tokens (*we’ll walk through an example on this below*).\n\nWhen a token is burned, it is eliminated from the supply of shares available. Assuming the market cap of MKR is unchanged (*as the future expected cash flows are not materially impacted by an individual sale)*, the price per MKR token should increase proportionately to the number of MKR tokens burned.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cf681f0-f91e-47f0-8354-c3d2c69e96e3_1057x361.png)\n\n## **How should we think about Maker’s future ‘cash flows’?**\n\nAs CDPs age, they generate stability fees that will be repaid through token burns in a future period. These token burns should generate economic gains to MKR holders in the form of price appreciation that is equivalent to the receipt of cash.\n\nLet’s run through an example to demonstrate this below:\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda3cb970-2231-4f78-88f7-5fdb9141fd40_1085x657.png)\n\nIn both examples above, MKR holders receive $0.06 for the payment of stability fees upon closing of a CDP. In the first scenario, token holders receive their earnings in the form of intrinsic token price appreciation. In the second scenario, token holders receive earnings in the form of cash. **The token burns should be economically equivalent to a cash payout.**\n\nHowever, businesses don’t recognize their revenue upon receipt of cash but based on the period of service. If you were to purchase a subscription and pay for it at year’s end, the business would still recognize revenue throughout the year. As revenue is recognized, there is an increase in accounts receivable on the balance sheet.\n\nThe same is true for Maker. The protocol should recognize stability fees in the period they are generated and accrue a “token burn receivable” in the background. In traditional finance/venture, we value businesses based on the revenue they generate in a given period, not based on the receipt of cash. **Therefore, we can value MKR on the stability fees we expect the protocol to generate in a given period.**\n\n## **How to forecast stability fees like a VC?**\n\nInvestors forecast cash flow to software businesses based on a few key revenue drivers (*customer wins, ASP/contract size, retention, etc*.) and cost drivers (*COGS, OpEx*).\n\nWe can draw equivalents to these for MKR.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84f044ed-77a7-4ea9-827a-98b824f8549a_907x331.png)\n\n### **Forecasting the drivers**\n\n#### New Supply\n\nNew DAI will grow alongside increased crypto penetration, asset price appreciation, and increased demand for DAI across DeFi. A few methods investors can explore:\n\n* **Bottom-Up**\n  * At what rate is MKR acquiring new users/capital?\n  * What percentage of ETH wallets have created a CDP?\n  * What percentage of a user’s wallet do you believe will be locked in MKR?\n  * Are there any major deals you expect MKR to win with TradFi institutions, and if so how much will this grow CDPs? *Note: this approach is likely unnecessarily granular for today’s market and will be more valuable once the space matures.*\n* **Top-Down**\n  * What percentage of the USD money supply can we expect to be consumed by stablecoins?\n  * What percentage of the total USD stablecoin market can we expect DAI to account for?\n  * What percentage of the total crypto leverage market will Maker deposits account for?\n  * What does this imply in terms of the total value of the CDPs held in MKR? Does this imply a reasonable total crypto market cap?\n\n#### **Stability Fee**\n\nThis is a question on the cost of capital. Maker could become the risk-free rate on Ether deposits. Historicals suggest rates in the low single digits.\n\n#### Cost of Goods and Services (COGS)\n\nMany of these costs should reach significant economies of scale as deposits and stability fees expand. Oracle costs will likely scale at a higher rate than risk and governance costs.\n\n#### Operation Expenses (OpEx)\n\nEngineering, growth, and content costs should achieve economies of scale as R&D and S&M do in traditional software / FinTech businesses. The DSR is the savings rate provided to deposits of DAI in Maker (*note, not all DAI outstanding*). This can be increased to spike demand for DAI. The DAO voted to drop this rate to 0% in 2020, and it has yet to increase meaningfully…with so much DeFi action generating DAI demand, it’s unclear if it will ever come back!\n\n## **MKR Valuation Model**\n\nWe can construct a model for Maker’s financials and assign an expected exit multiple to forecast the protocol’s market cap after a 5 year hold period.\n\nLet’s run through some of the assumptions driving our math:\n\n#### **DAI Outstanding**\n\nNet new DAI minted increases to \\~$20B on exit. Total DAI outstanding in 2026 is equivalent to the assets of a regional bank in the US.\n\nIf you (*conservatively*) assume the money supply flattens after the massive spike earlier this year, DAI accounts for 0.3% of the money supply on exit. The total market for stablecoins accounts for something in the low single-digit percentage of the total USD money supply, assuming modest DAI market share increases. A bull case would assume integration of real-world assets, FinTech integrations, and increased asset types. A bear case would assume hawkish regulation on decentralized stablecoins.\n\n#### Peg Stability Module (PSM)\n\nA portion of DAI's market cap will be backed 1-to-1 with other stablecoins (*ie USDC*). DAI generated in this manner does not generate stability fees. There is a small fee for the creation of DAI through this method, but this has been excluded for immateriality. This has fluctuated throughout the year—check this [Dune dashboard](https://dune.xyz/SebVentures/maker---accounting_1) to track. The model assumes this is constant with averages at \\~50% over the forecast period.\n\n#### **Stability Fees**\n\nRates have been \\~4% for much of the year. This is assumed to be constant over the forecast period as a base case. If you built a bull case, you could argue consumers will pay a security premium for the protocol with time. The bear case would argue that consumers would prefer competing platforms with better capital efficiency (*ie undercollateralized loans*).\n\n#### **COGS and OpEx**\n\nThese line items scale as a percentage of overall DAI outstanding and stability fees. Some line items, like Oracle costs, should scale with increased usage. Others, like content and special growth projects, reach early economies of scale. I assume the DSR never makes a meaningful comeback as DAI demand is stimulated by ecosystem development.

In this post, I’ll give a teardown on MakerDAO.\n\n### **What is Maker?**\n\nI’ll stick to the basics here, but if you’re interested in going deeper, [check out these resources](https://awesome.makerdao.com/#faqs).\n\n* **Maker is a platform for taking out collateralized loans on your crypto.** Users collateralize assets into a vault, creating a collateralized debt position or “CDP”, at a rate of 150% or greater, and receive a USD pegged stablecoin, DAI. Interest accrues on your loan at a rate denominated by the owners of the MKR token (*through a token vote*), and that interest (*the stability fee*) is paid by the user at the time of closing out their loan.\n* **Why does it matter?** Users can maintain exposure to price appreciation in their assets (*i.e. not sell ETH*) while gaining liquidity that can be used for daily expenses (*i.e. working capital*) or leverage.\n* **What can you do with DAI?** There are billions of dollars in DAI liquidity. It can be used across the crypto ecosystem, exchanged for fiat USD on an exchange, and hopefully spent for real world purchases with spend cards in the not too distant future.\n* **Where does Maker store the deposits?** As a bank would historically store your capital within the metal doors of a vault, Maker stores your capital in cryptographically protected code (*smart contracts built on Ethereum*).\n* **How do Maker and its owners make money?** Interest, but not with the traditional mechanism. When a user closes their position to reclaim the crypto stored in Maker, they pay the accumulated interest by ‘burning’ the dollar equivalent of the amount owed in MKR tokens (*we’ll walk through an example on this below*).\n\nWhen a token is burned, it is eliminated from the supply of shares available. Assuming the market cap of MKR is unchanged (*as the future expected cash flows are not materially impacted by an individual sale)*, the price per MKR token should increase proportionately to the number of MKR tokens burned.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cf681f0-f91e-47f0-8354-c3d2c69e96e3_1057x361.png)\n\n## **How should we think about Maker’s future ‘cash flows’?**\n\nAs CDPs age, they generate stability fees that will be repaid through token burns in a future period. These token burns should generate economic gains to MKR holders in the form of price appreciation that is equivalent to the receipt of cash.\n\nLet’s run through an example to demonstrate this below:\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda3cb970-2231-4f78-88f7-5fdb9141fd40_1085x657.png)\n\nIn both examples above, MKR holders receive $0.06 for the payment of stability fees upon closing of a CDP. In the first scenario, token holders receive their earnings in the form of intrinsic token price appreciation. In the second scenario, token holders receive earnings in the form of cash. **The token burns should be economically equivalent to a cash payout.**\n\nHowever, businesses don’t recognize their revenue upon receipt of cash but based on the period of service. If you were to purchase a subscription and pay for it at year’s end, the business would still recognize revenue throughout the year. As revenue is recognized, there is an increase in accounts receivable on the balance sheet.\n\nThe same is true for Maker. The protocol should recognize stability fees in the period they are generated and accrue a “token burn receivable” in the background. In traditional finance/venture, we value businesses based on the revenue they generate in a given period, not based on the receipt of cash. **Therefore, we can value MKR on the stability fees we expect the protocol to generate in a given period.**\n\n## **How to forecast stability fees like a VC?**\n\nInvestors forecast cash flow to software businesses based on a few key revenue drivers (*customer wins, ASP/contract size, retention, etc*.) and cost drivers (*COGS, OpEx*).\n\nWe can draw equivalents to these for MKR.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84f044ed-77a7-4ea9-827a-98b824f8549a_907x331.png)\n\n### **Forecasting the drivers**\n\n#### New Supply\n\nNew DAI will grow alongside increased crypto penetration, asset price appreciation, and increased demand for DAI across DeFi. A few methods investors can explore:\n\n* **Bottom-Up**\n  * At what rate is MKR acquiring new users/capital?\n  * What percentage of ETH wallets have created a CDP?\n  * What percentage of a user’s wallet do you believe will be locked in MKR?\n  * Are there any major deals you expect MKR to win with TradFi institutions, and if so how much will this grow CDPs? *Note: this approach is likely unnecessarily granular for today’s market and will be more valuable once the space matures.*\n* **Top-Down**\n  * What percentage of the USD money supply can we expect to be consumed by stablecoins?\n  * What percentage of the total USD stablecoin market can we expect DAI to account for?\n  * What percentage of the total crypto leverage market will Maker deposits account for?\n  * What does this imply in terms of the total value of the CDPs held in MKR? Does this imply a reasonable total crypto market cap?\n\n#### **Stability Fee**\n\nThis is a question on the cost of capital. Maker could become the risk-free rate on Ether deposits. Historicals suggest rates in the low single digits.\n\n#### Cost of Goods and Services (COGS)\n\nMany of these costs should reach significant economies of scale as deposits and stability fees expand. Oracle costs will likely scale at a higher rate than risk and governance costs.\n\n#### Operation Expenses (OpEx)\n\nEngineering, growth, and content costs should achieve economies of scale as R&D and S&M do in traditional software / FinTech businesses. The DSR is the savings rate provided to deposits of DAI in Maker (*note, not all DAI outstanding*). This can be increased to spike demand for DAI. The DAO voted to drop this rate to 0% in 2020, and it has yet to increase meaningfully…with so much DeFi action generating DAI demand, it’s unclear if it will ever come back!\n\n## **MKR Valuation Model**\n\nWe can construct a model for Maker’s financials and assign an expected exit multiple to forecast the protocol’s market cap after a 5 year hold period.\n\nLet’s run through some of the assumptions driving our math:\n\n#### **DAI Outstanding**\n\nNet new DAI minted increases to \\~$20B on exit. Total DAI outstanding in 2026 is equivalent to the assets of a regional bank in the US.\n\nIf you (*conservatively*) assume the money supply flattens after the massive spike earlier this year, DAI accounts for 0.3% of the money supply on exit. The total market for stablecoins accounts for something in the low single-digit percentage of the total USD money supply, assuming modest DAI market share increases. A bull case would assume integration of real-world assets, FinTech integrations, and increased asset types. A bear case would assume hawkish regulation on decentralized stablecoins.\n\n#### Peg Stability Module (PSM)\n\nA portion of DAI's market cap will be backed 1-to-1 with other stablecoins (*ie USDC*). DAI generated in this manner does not generate stability fees. There is a small fee for the creation of DAI through this method, but this has been excluded for immateriality. This has fluctuated throughout the year—check this [Dune dashboard](https://dune.xyz/SebVentures/maker---accounting_1) to track. The model assumes this is constant with averages at \\~50% over the forecast period.\n\n#### **Stability Fees**\n\nRates have been \\~4% for much of the year. This is assumed to be constant over the forecast period as a base case. If you built a bull case, you could argue consumers will pay a security premium for the protocol with time. The bear case would argue that consumers would prefer competing platforms with better capital efficiency (*ie undercollateralized loans*).\n\n#### **COGS and OpEx**\n\nThese line items scale as a percentage of overall DAI outstanding and stability fees. Some line items, like Oracle costs, should scale with increased usage. Others, like content and special growth projects, reach early economies of scale. I assume the DSR never makes a meaningful comeback as DAI demand is stimulated by ecosystem development. The protocol operates at profit margins of \\~85% on exit… that’s a business model that is drool-worthy!\n\n#### **Exit Multiple**\n\nPublic market investors often think in terms of NTM (*next twelve months*) multiples to give credit for future growth expectations. VCs assume a multiple that public markets will assign to a business and forecast valuation based on this. For many software/FinTech businesses, we would value a business off of its revenue.\n\nWe can’t do that here because the cost structure is so different from a traditional business. Instead, we’ll value Maker off its net profit and assume it trades in line with EBITDA multiples on high-growth FinTech businesses.\n\nOur model assumes the business trades at \\~55x today and compresses over time to \\~30x on exit. Depending on the month, this would be in line with the Visa, PayPal, and other scaled players. That said, with the massive multiples some FinTechs are seeing (\\*Square acquiring Afterpay at a triple digit EBITDA multiple \\*👀 ), there is a bull case to push this meaningfully higher.\n\n**Using this framework and these illustrative assumptions (not investment advice), we can build a VC case for \\~$40B MKR in 5 years.**\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F776dbc53-6353-4f20-9666-da2fa341435c_823x441.png)\n\n### **Closing Thoughts**\n\nCrypto protocols are creating game-changing products.\n\nBuilders are leveraging innovative tech and economic design to craft new business models.

From that moment on, I was hooked.*\n\nFor those interested in the evolution of digital currencies, I highly recommend Steven Levy’s “[E-Money (It’s What I Want)](http://www.wired.com/1994/12/emoney/)” article from *Wired* way back in December 1994. It’s a great read, and presages many current developments.\n\nOne problem with cryptocurrencies that Levy just touches on briefly is **the problem of the double-spend**. In brief, when hard currencies are exchanged, the transaction can only happen in one place and at one time, but in the digital realm transactions do not involve the physical transfer of data. Rather, digital transactions technically involve the **copying** of data to another party, which leaves open the possibility that the original party can attempt to spend their digital currency twice.\n\nPut differently, someone can potentially attempt to broadcast two digital currency transactions at approximately the same time, using the same digital coins, but the parties receiving the transactions **have no incentive to agree that one transaction takes priority**. Before the arrival of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin, with its revelatory proof-of-work scheme, most solutions to the double-spend problem involved having a trusted third-party intermediary resolving double spends.\n\nInterestingly, copyright law faces the same double spend problem, in form of the first sale doctrine.\n\nThe first sale doctrine allows resales of copies of physical works such as books, DVDs and CDs, which otherwise would be precluded by the Copyright Act as in infringement of the original author’s exclusive right of distribution. It is embodied in Section 109 of the Copyright Act, which says:\n\n> the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord.\n\nThe first sale doctrine is why you can find used bookstores in every town, and buy used copies of the *Purple Rain* vinyl album on eBay or at a flea market.\n\nIn economic terms, physical copies are “[rivalrous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics))” assets — while being consumed by one person, it cannot be consumed by another person. By contrast, non-rivalrous goods — like broadcast television — can be consumed by many people at once.\n\nIn any event, while you can find used bookstores and music stores, good luck finding a used mp3 website. They don’t exist, or if they do, that site would be deemed to be engaged in copyright infringement. That’s because, as interpreted by the courts in recent years, **the first sale doctrine does not permit resales of digital content**.\n\nJack Browning recently posted [a great analysis](http://goo.gl/CD8jbC) on this blog regarding whether a new technology like the blockchain could revitalize the first sale doctrine under copyright law. Jack used a terrific analogy to explain the first sale doctrine, from the Hugh Jackman movie *The Prestige*. In the film, in order to create the illusion of teleportation, Jackman’s character — who had access to a cloning device only (just watch the movie, okay?) — had to murder his own duplicate each time one was created, so that there was only one copy in the world at any given time.\n\nIn the digital world, **the problem is that it is difficult to kill the original work when you sell the original version to a third party** — you are not effecting a physical transfer of your copy. Instead, what really happens is that you are making a copy of the work on a new computer, and the only way to get rid of the original is to delete it from the original location. To make sure that occurs, some trusted third party would have to ensure that the original copy was truly wiped from existence.\n\nSound familiar? ***It’s precisely the same issue cryptocurrencies face***, which was (many believe) solved by the blockchain. The only difference is that it the Copyright Act that prohibits making duplicates in the first, whereas when one double spends cryptocurrencies it is up to the market (or perhaps fraud or similar laws) to stop it.\n\nIn the *[Capitol Records, LLC v. ReDigi Inc.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11987243262728384575&q=redigi&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33)* case, ReDigi had created a system whereby it attempted to act as a trusted third party intermediary to eliminate the double spend of copies of a copyrighted piece of music, and thus to allow its users to take advantage of the first sale doctrine. It uploaded a seller’s music file to a cloud service, and then eliminated the copy on the seller’s computer, after which the buyer would download a copy of the file from the cloud and pay for it.\n\n**However, the court did not buy this approach**. The first sale doctrine, it said, does not allow this type of digital “transfer”, but rather only covers “material items, like records, that the copyright owner put into the stream of commerce.” The court believed that ReDigi was not distributing such material items but instead was “distributing reproductions of the copyrighted code embedded in new material objects.”\n\nJack’s analysis focused on whether the court in the *ReDigi* case would have reached a different result had the technology in front of it been based on blockchain technology, which arguably might provide a much more secure way of guaranteeing that multiple digital copies of a work are not in circulation. He concluded, I believe correctly, that this court would not have reached a different conclusion given the way the judge interpreted the Copyright Act’s language.\n\n\\*\\*But judicial interpretation is not the only path to change. \\*\\*In fact, the *ReDigi* court also said the following:\n\n> At base, ReDigi seeks judicial amendment of the Copyright Act to reach its desired policy outcome. However, “\\[s\\]ound policy, as well as history, supports \\[the Court’s\\] consistent deference to Congress when major technological innovations alter the market for copyrighted materials. Congress has the constitutional authority and the institutional ability to accommodate fully the varied permutations of competing interests that are inevitably implicated by such new technology.” … Such defence often counsels for a limited interpretation of copyright protection. However, here, the Court cannot of its own accord condone the wholesale application of the first sale defense to the digital sphere, particularly when Congress itself has declined to take that step.\n\nThe question then becomes whether the blockchain, or some similar approach, might provide enough certainty around digital transfers to persuade Congress that the first sale doctrine can be extended to cover such transfers, at least under certain circumstances. (Of course, this also flags a larger policy discussion: Do we *want* a robust secondary market in digital copies? In a world where streaming has largely overtaken holding digital copies for many forms of content, would this mark an advance or a retreat?)\n\nFrom a technological standpoint, however, **the blockchain on its own cannot solve copyright’s first sale doctrine problem for digital copies**. While a blockchain-based system can provide a potentially unassailable record of ownership of a particular copy of a work and the substitution of a second copy that for all intents and purposes *becomes* , some other system still has to be implemented to automatically remove or disable the prior copy, which still resides with the seller. Some entity still has to act as the ReDigi in the equation.\n\nUnless, that is, we can come up with a proof-of-work type of solution for digital resales as well. Some way for a decentralized network of peers to verify the deletion of the original copy and the creation of the new copy that’s replacing the original, perhaps in a shared database?\n\n**Any budding Satoshis out there who want to take on this problem?**", "timestamp": 1633490759, "digest": "NyJavq19tgdOlVNNswG_kGPS2IA63nDPSVDY4xPIaqg", "contributor": "0x538fDC0055fCeCe2e55e327A7673F9887FBC29c7"}

{"id": "e5bxDwzOPl0FRdWjb62n3b3fL67SyNZOYggkjUJmCyI", "title": "MakerDAO Teardown: Burning all the way to the bank", "body": "Taking crypto to the next level requires broader investor buy-in—markets shouldn’t move on just memes and tweets, but on fundamental analysis.\n\nIn venture capital and on Wall Street, we evaluate an investment’s expected returns by forecasting the asset’s financial performance and assuming it trades at some multiple of revenue or EBITDA on exit.\n\nThe surprising aspect is that we can apply this exact framework to many revenue-generating protocols to create an investment case for the traditional investor. In this post, I’ll give a teardown on MakerDAO.\n\n### **What is Maker?**\n\nI’ll stick to the basics here, but if you’re interested in going deeper, [check out these resources](https://awesome.makerdao.com/#faqs).\n\n* **Maker is a platform for taking out collateralized loans on your crypto.** Users collateralize assets into a vault, creating a collateralized debt position or “CDP”, at a rate of 150% or greater, and receive a USD pegged stablecoin, DAI. Interest accrues on your loan at a rate denominated by the owners of the MKR token (*through a token vote*), and that interest (*the stability fee*) is paid by the user at the time of closing out their loan.\n* **Why does it matter?** Users can maintain exposure to price appreciation in their assets (*i.e. not sell ETH*) while gaining liquidity that can be used for daily expenses (*i.e. working capital*) or leverage.\n* **What can you do with DAI?** There are billions of dollars in DAI liquidity. It can be used across the crypto ecosystem, exchanged for fiat USD on an exchange, and hopefully spent for real world purchases with spend cards in the not too distant future.\n* **Where does Maker store the deposits?** As a bank would historically store your capital within the metal doors of a vault, Maker stores your capital in cryptographically protected code (*smart contracts built on Ethereum*).\n* **How do Maker and its owners make money?** Interest, but not with the traditional mechanism. When a user closes their position to reclaim the crypto stored in Maker, they pay the accumulated interest by ‘burning’ the dollar equivalent of the amount owed in MKR tokens (*we’ll walk through an example on this below*).\n\nWhen a token is burned, it is eliminated from the supply of shares available. Assuming the market cap of MKR is unchanged (*as the future expected cash flows are not materially impacted by an individual sale)*, the price per MKR token should increase proportionately to the number of MKR tokens burned.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cf681f0-f91e-47f0-8354-c3d2c69e96e3_1057x361.png)\n\n## **How should we think about Maker’s future ‘cash flows’?**\n\nAs CDPs age, they generate stability fees that will be repaid through token burns in a future period. These token burns should generate economic gains to MKR holders in the form of price appreciation that is equivalent to the receipt of cash.\n\nLet’s run through an example to demonstrate this below:\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda3cb970-2231-4f78-88f7-5fdb9141fd40_1085x657.png)\n\nIn both examples above, MKR holders receive $0.06 for the payment of stability fees upon closing of a CDP. In the first scenario, token holders receive their earnings in the form of intrinsic token price appreciation. In the second scenario, token holders receive earnings in the form of cash. **The token burns should be economically equivalent to a cash payout.**\n\nHowever, businesses don’t recognize their revenue upon receipt of cash but based on the period of service. If you were to purchase a subscription and pay for it at year’s end, the business would still recognize revenue throughout the year. As revenue is recognized, there is an increase in accounts receivable on the balance sheet.\n\nThe same is true for Maker. The protocol should recognize stability fees in the period they are generated and accrue a “token burn receivable” in the background. In traditional finance/venture, we value businesses based on the revenue they generate in a given period, not based on the receipt of cash. **Therefore, we can value MKR on the stability fees we expect the protocol to generate in a given period.**\n\n## **How to forecast stability fees like a VC?**\n\nInvestors forecast cash flow to software businesses based on a few key revenue drivers (*customer wins, ASP/contract size, retention, etc*.) and cost drivers (*COGS, OpEx*).\n\nWe can draw equivalents to these for MKR.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84f044ed-77a7-4ea9-827a-98b824f8549a_907x331.png)\n\n### **Forecasting the drivers**\n\n#### New Supply\n\nNew DAI will grow alongside increased crypto penetration, asset price appreciation, and increased demand for DAI across DeFi. A few methods investors can explore:\n\n* **Bottom-Up**\n  * At what rate is MKR acquiring new users/capital?\n  * What percentage of ETH wallets have created a CDP?\n  * What percentage of a user’s wallet do you believe will be locked in MKR?\n  * Are there any major deals you expect MKR to win with TradFi institutions, and if so how much will this grow CDPs? *Note: this approach is likely unnecessarily granular for today’s market and will be more valuable once the space matures.*\n* **Top-Down**\n  * What percentage of the USD money supply can we expect to be consumed by stablecoins?\n  * What percentage of the total USD stablecoin market can we expect DAI to account for?\n  * What percentage of the total crypto leverage market will Maker deposits account for?\n  * What does this imply in terms of the total value of the CDPs held in MKR? Does this imply a reasonable total crypto market cap?\n\n#### **Stability Fee**\n\nThis is a question on the cost of capital. Maker could become the risk-free rate on Ether deposits. Historicals suggest rates in the low single digits.\n\n#### Cost of Goods and Services (COGS)\n\nMany of these costs should reach significant economies of scale as deposits and stability fees expand. Oracle costs will likely scale at a higher rate than risk and governance costs.\n\n#### Operation Expenses (OpEx)\n\nEngineering, growth, and content costs should achieve economies of scale as R&D and S&M do in traditional software / FinTech businesses. The DSR is the savings rate provided to deposits of DAI in Maker (*note, not all DAI outstanding*). This can be increased to spike demand for DAI. The DAO voted to drop this rate to 0% in 2020, and it has yet to increase meaningfully…with so much DeFi action generating DAI demand, it’s unclear if it will ever come back!\n\n## **MKR Valuation Model**\n\nWe can construct a model for Maker’s financials and assign an expected exit multiple to forecast the protocol’s market cap after a 5 year hold period.\n\nLet’s run through some of the assumptions driving our math:\n\n#### **DAI Outstanding**\n\nNet new DAI minted increases to \\~$20B on exit. Total DAI outstanding in 2026 is equivalent to the assets of a regional bank in the US.\n\nIf you (*conservatively*) assume the money supply flattens after the massive spike earlier this year, DAI accounts for 0.3% of the money supply on exit. The total market for stablecoins accounts for something in the low single-digit percentage of the total USD money supply, assuming modest DAI market share increases. A bull case would assume integration of real-world assets, FinTech integrations, and increased asset types. A bear case would assume hawkish regulation on decentralized stablecoins.\n\n#### Peg Stability Module (PSM)\n\nA portion of DAI's market cap will be backed 1-to-1 with other stablecoins (*ie USDC*). DAI generated in this manner does not generate stability fees. There is a small fee for the creation of DAI through this method, but this has been excluded for immateriality. This has fluctuated throughout the year—check this [Dune dashboard](https://dune.xyz/SebVentures/maker---accounting_1) to track. The model assumes this is constant with averages at \\~50% over the forecast period.\n\n#### **Stability Fees**\n\nRates have been \\~4% for much of the year. This is assumed to be constant over the forecast period as a base case. If you built a bull case, you could argue consumers will pay a security premium for the protocol with time. The bear case would argue that consumers would prefer competing platforms with better capital efficiency (*ie undercollateralized loans*).\n\n#### **COGS and OpEx**\n\nThese line items scale as a percentage of overall DAI outstanding and stability fees. Some line items, like Oracle costs, should scale with increased usage. Others, like content and special growth projects, reach early economies of scale. I assume the DSR never makes a meaningful comeback as DAI demand is stimulated by ecosystem development. The protocol operates at profit margins of \\~85% on exit… that’s a business model that is drool-worthy!\n\n#### **Exit Multiple**\n\nPublic market investors often think in terms of NTM (*next twelve months*) multiples to give credit for future growth expectations. VCs assume a multiple that public markets will assign to a business and forecast valuation based on this. For many software/FinTech businesses, we would value a business off of its revenue.\n\nWe can’t do that here because the cost structure is so different from a traditional business. Instead, we’ll value Maker off its net profit and assume it trades in line with EBITDA multiples on high-growth FinTech businesses.\n\nOur model assumes the business trades at \\~55x today and compresses over time to \\~30x on exit. Depending on the month, this would be in line with the Visa, PayPal, and other scaled players.

In this post, I’ll give a teardown on MakerDAO.\n\n### **What is Maker?**\n\nI’ll stick to the basics here, but if you’re interested in going deeper, [check out these resources](https://awesome.makerdao.com/#faqs).\n\n*   **Maker is a platform for taking out collateralized loans on your crypto.** Users collateralize assets into a vault, creating a collateralized debt position or “CDP”, at a rate of 150% or greater, and receive a USD pegged stablecoin, DAI. Interest accrues on your loan at a rate denominated by the owners of the MKR token (*through a token vote*), and that interest (*the stability fee*) is paid by the user at the time of closing out their loan.\n*   **Why does it matter?** Users can maintain exposure to price appreciation in their assets (*i.e. not sell ETH*) while gaining liquidity that can be used for daily expenses (*i.e. working capital*) or leverage.\n*   **What can you do with DAI?** There are billions of dollars in DAI liquidity. It can be used across the crypto ecosystem, exchanged for fiat USD on an exchange, and hopefully spent for real world purchases with spend cards in the not too distant future.\n*   **Where does Maker store the deposits?** As a bank would historically store your capital within the metal doors of a vault, Maker stores your capital in cryptographically protected code (*smart contracts built on Ethereum*).\n*   **How do Maker and its owners make money?** Interest, but not with the traditional mechanism. When a user closes their position to reclaim the crypto stored in Maker, they pay the accumulated interest by ‘burning’ the dollar equivalent of the amount owed in MKR tokens (*we’ll walk through an example on this below*).\n\nWhen a token is burned, it is eliminated from the supply of shares available. Assuming the market cap of MKR is unchanged (*as the future expected cash flows are not materially impacted by an individual sale)*, the price per MKR token should increase proportionately to the number of MKR tokens burned.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cf681f0-f91e-47f0-8354-c3d2c69e96e3\\_1057x361.png)\n\n## **How should we think about Maker’s future ‘cash flows’?**\n\nAs CDPs age, they generate stability fees that will be repaid through token burns in a future period. These token burns should generate economic gains to MKR holders in the form of price appreciation that is equivalent to the receipt of cash.\n\nLet’s run through an example to demonstrate this below:\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda3cb970-2231-4f78-88f7-5fdb9141fd40\\_1085x657.png)\n\nIn both examples above, MKR holders receive $0.06 for the payment of stability fees upon closing of a CDP. In the first scenario, token holders receive their earnings in the form of intrinsic token price appreciation. In the second scenario, token holders receive earnings in the form of cash. **The token burns should be economically equivalent to a cash payout.**\n\nHowever, businesses don’t recognize their revenue upon receipt of cash but based on the period of service. If you were to purchase a subscription and pay for it at year’s end, the business would still recognize revenue throughout the year. As revenue is recognized, there is an increase in accounts receivable on the balance sheet.\n\nThe same is true for Maker. The protocol should recognize stability fees in the period they are generated and accrue a “token burn receivable” in the background. In traditional finance/venture, we value businesses based on the revenue they generate in a given period, not based on the receipt of cash. **Therefore, we can value MKR on the stability fees we expect the protocol to generate in a given period.**\n\n## **How to forecast stability fees like a VC?**\n\nInvestors forecast cash flow to software businesses based on a few key revenue drivers (*customer wins, ASP/contract size, retention, etc*.) and cost drivers (*COGS, OpEx*).\n\nWe can draw equivalents to these for MKR.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84f044ed-77a7-4ea9-827a-98b824f8549a\\_907x331.png)\n\n### **Forecasting the drivers**\n\n#### New Supply\n\nNew DAI will grow alongside increased crypto penetration, asset price appreciation, and increased demand for DAI across DeFi. A few methods investors can explore:\n\n*   **Bottom-Up**\n\n    *   At what rate is MKR acquiring new users/capital?\n    *   What percentage of ETH wallets have created a CDP?\n    *   What percentage of a user’s wallet do you believe will be locked in MKR?\n    *   Are there any major deals you expect MKR to win with TradFi institutions, and if so how much will this grow CDPs? *Note: this approach is likely unnecessarily granular for today’s market and will be more valuable once the space matures.*\n\n*   **Top-Down**\n\n    *   What percentage of the USD money supply can we expect to be consumed by stablecoins?\n    *   What percentage of the total USD stablecoin market can we expect DAI to account for?\n    *   What percentage of the total crypto leverage market will Maker deposits account for?\n    *   What does this imply in terms of the total value of the CDPs held in MKR? Does this imply a reasonable total crypto market cap?\n\n#### **Stability Fee**\n\nThis is a question on the cost of capital. Maker could become the risk-free rate on Ether deposits. Historicals suggest rates in the low single digits.\n\n#### Cost of Goods and Services (COGS)\n\nMany of these costs should reach significant economies of scale as deposits and stability fees expand. Oracle costs will likely scale at a higher rate than risk and governance costs.\n\n#### Operation Expenses (OpEx)\n\nEngineering, growth, and content costs should achieve economies of scale as R\\&D and S\\&M do in traditional software / FinTech businesses. The DSR is the savings rate provided to deposits of DAI in Maker (*note, not all DAI outstanding*). This can be increased to spike demand for DAI. The DAO voted to drop this rate to 0% in 2020, and it has yet to increase meaningfully…with so much DeFi action generating DAI demand, it’s unclear if it will ever come back!\n\n## **MKR Valuation Model**\n\nWe can construct a model for Maker’s financials and assign an expected exit multiple to forecast the protocol’s market cap after a 5 year hold period.\n\nLet’s run through some of the assumptions driving our math:\n\n#### **DAI Outstanding**\n\nNet new DAI minted increases to \\~$20B on exit. Total DAI outstanding in 2026 is equivalent to the assets of a regional bank in the US.\n\nIf you (*conservatively*) assume the money supply flattens after the massive spike earlier this year, DAI accounts for 0.3% of the money supply on exit. The total market for stablecoins accounts for something in the low single-digit percentage of the total USD money supply, assuming modest DAI market share increases. A bull case would assume integration of real-world assets, FinTech integrations, and increased asset types. A bear case would assume hawkish regulation on decentralized stablecoins.\n\n#### Peg Stability Module (PSM)\n\nA portion of DAI's market cap will be backed 1-to-1 with other stablecoins (*ie USDC*). DAI generated in this manner does not generate stability fees. There is a small fee for the creation of DAI through this method, but this has been excluded for immateriality. This has fluctuated throughout the year—check this [Dune dashboard](https://dune.xyz/SebVentures/maker---accounting\\_1) to track. The model assumes this is constant with averages at \\~50% over the forecast period.\n\n#### **Stability Fees**\n\nRates have been \\~4% for much of the year. This is assumed to be constant over the forecast period as a base case. If you built a bull case, you could argue consumers will pay a security premium for the protocol with time. The bear case would argue that consumers would prefer competing platforms with better capital efficiency (*ie undercollateralized loans*).\n\n#### **COGS and OpEx**\n\nThese line items scale as a percentage of overall DAI outstanding and stability fees. Some line items, like Oracle costs, should scale with increased usage. Others, like content and special growth projects, reach early economies of scale. I assume the DSR never makes a meaningful comeback as DAI demand is stimulated by ecosystem development. The protocol operates at profit margins of \\~85% on exit… that’s a business model that is drool-worthy!\n\n#### **Exit Multiple**\n\nPublic market investors often think in terms of NTM (*next twelve months*) multiples to give credit for future growth expectations. VCs assume a multiple that public markets will assign to a business and forecast valuation based on this. For many software/FinTech businesses, we would value a business off of its revenue.\n\nWe can’t do that here because the cost structure is so different from a traditional business. Instead, we’ll value Maker off its net profit and assume it trades in line with EBITDA multiples on high-growth FinTech businesses.\n\nOur model assumes the business trades at \\~55x today and compresses over time to \\~30x on exit. Depending on the month, this would be in line with the Visa, PayPal, and other scaled players. That said, with the massive multiples some FinTechs are seeing (\\*Square acquiring Afterpay at a triple digit EBITDA multiple \\*👀 ), there is a bull case to push this meaningfully higher.\n\n**Using this framework and these illustrative assumptions (not investment advice), we can build a VC case for \\~$40B MKR in 5 years.**\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F776dbc53-6353-4f20-9666-da2fa341435c\\_823x441.png)\n\n### **Closing Thoughts**\n\nCrypto protocols are creating game-changing products.\n\nBuilders are leveraging innovative tech and economic design to craft new business models.

What would that look like? What would be mimicked vs. improved?\n\nThis piece is a thought exercise into those questions.\n\n## A Breakdown of the University Experience\n\nA quick disclaimer: This is “university” informed heavily by my own perspective as an American undergrad at Duke University interested in tech. University experiences vary quite a lot, and people attend for many different reasons. I will try to capture the most common ones.\n\nBelow are the bare-bones components of what I believe is the value proposition of attending a higher education institution:\n\n* Credentials\n* Social life\n* Path toward professional “success”\n* Education\n\nOutside of these four categories, there are some other aspects of universities that I think would be worth touching on:\n\n* Admissions\n* Cost\n* Length of time spent at the institution\n\nOf course, there are many other characteristics of universities that lie outside of the above, such as tiered meal plans. In my opinion, these are not the most integral parts of the university experience and don’t necessarily need a web3 parallel.\n\nBefore we dive in, let’s address the fundamental difference between a university and a DAO: one is highly centralized, and the other is decentralized.\n\n## The Nature of a DAO\n\nA DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, which means the rules by which it operates as well as its financial transactions are recorded on the blockchain for anyone to see. There are many different types of DAOs (financial, social, etc.), but the common thread is that there is no central governing entity of the organization that makes decisions for everyone. Instead, community members drive governance through democratic processes.\n\nIn my opinion, the most significant aspect of DAOs is that they allow us to **re-imagine incentive structures** within organizations. This is especially interesting when it comes to the university, an incredibly complex organization with a high number of different stakeholders (students, parents, teaching faculty, administration + board of trustees, non-faculty employees, etc.), all with their own set of incentives. Universities are very top-down, whereas DAOs are very bottom-up.\n\nA lot of companies are trying to unbundle the college experience—how could DAOs unbundle and “re-bundle” in a better way?\n\n## DAOs as University Replacements\n\n### Credentials\n\n*How can this organization act as an indicator of an individual’s qualifications?*\n\nWhen you are admitted to and attend a university, you are now associated with its brand name, which offers you the credentials of being someone intelligent, driven, and accomplished, amongst other traits. The more selective and well-known the university is, the more you are set apart from the masses, and the stronger this credentialing is. These credentials give you [status](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/signaling-on-the-internet), the more of which you accrue, the more levers you can pull with it (social, political, professional, etc). Status is one of the only (and strongest) things aligning the differing incentives of university stakeholders.\n\nIn a web3 world, there is nothing really preventing a similar status hierarchy from emerging—there will be DAOs that are more gated than others and DAOs that are more elite and desirable than others. Status signaling is inherent to human nature, and as is our correlation between exclusivity and desirability. In this sense, the web3 equivalent of university credentialing would look pretty much the same (being a part of certain DAOs gives you more credibility).\n\nHowever, if we are optimizing for “true” credentialing, this is something that is best done in web3 due to more transparency and meritocracy. If everything you do to contribute to the DAO’s community (running interest-based clubs, conducting peer learning workshops, etc.) is recorded on-chain, it’s very easy for your peers (or anyone) to verify that you did those things. Now, it’s not just the name of the organization that lends you credibility, or what you tell other people you did...it’s what you actually did.\n\nThis then calls into question: why do we need these organizations then? If my own accomplishments are on a public ledger for anyone to see, do I really need to be a part of a DAO for the credentials?\n\nWell, it’s not just about the credentials.\n\n### Social Life\n\n*How can the organization facilitate the building and maintenance of social relationships?*\n\nIn my opinion, the prospect of making new friends and experiencing the *lively social scene* is also one of the main reasons people go to college. Social life on campus is roughly made up of:\n\n* Clubs and organizations\n* Greek life\n* Living in close proximity with other people your age\n* Dating scene\n\n#### Clubs and Organizations\n\nStarting with clubs and organizations, I believe that interest-based DAOs would be able to provide a more fulfilling experience for both students and faculty. At universities, people often join clubs to 1) meet people with the same interests and 2) pad their resume for professional pursuits. Most participants are not tangibly rewarded by the club or the university for the work they do, it’s easy to misconstrue the degree to which they participated, and almost everyone stops participating after graduation. (That is assuming they stick with the club throughout all of college; anyone who made prior commitments can quit at anytime if they don’t feel personally incentivized to contribute anymore.) Furthermore, a lot of clubs and organizations are not great at documenting their rules and practices, resulting in huge changes in both structure and culture as seniors graduate and new leadership takes over.\n\nThe web3 parallel of student organizations right now is that DAOs use Discord channels for certain interests (art, gaming, etc). If we view DAOs themselves as clubs utilizing social/community tokens, participants would be (*at least* financially) incentivized to contribute to the sustainability of the organization over the long term, even after they “graduate.” As long as a member holds the tokens, they will be invested in the DAO and contribute in the hopes of increasing the token’s value and receiving individual rewards. This token-based model introduces **a financial incentive that strengthens personal incentives to contribute to the community**. Participation could be transparently recorded (ex. receiving different NFTs for attending and hosting events), and the direction of the DAO’s activities would be driven by community members’ voting power through the utilization of tools like [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/). This means that everyone in a DAO, regardless of their role within the DAO, has a common, overarching incentive that is difficult to outweigh by other incentives. Whether this model is good or bad in the big picture is up to interpretation; for more thoughts on this, I’ll refer you to [“The Token Society”](https://www.drorpoleg.com/the-token-society/) by Drorg Poleg and [“Social Token Paradox”](https://gaby.mirror.xyz/zqchiBQhWWS49gaabLU92-BUUwfBL5aHCtNT88VTI8o) by Gaby Goldberg.\n\nIn addition to aligning individual incentives more effectively within the organization, web3 clubs could have much better documentation of membership, internal processes, organization history, traditions, and more. DAOs also solve the problem that many clubs deal with on a regular basis in web2: they have to follow the rules that the university imposes on spending, membership, and utilization of community spaces that may impede on the quality and speed of activity. With DAOs, those trying to organize community activities and those enforcing rules and regulations would act in consensus by vote (and at the very least, be more on the same page).\n\n#### Greek Life\n\nRegarding Greek life, the DAO itself could be a fraternity or sorority, perhaps with a national DAO and regional or local DAO chapters that belong to the national collective. This type of organizational structure could certainly be supported in web3, with a similar “rush” process for potential new members to get to know what being in the DAO is like and for DAO members to meet potential new members. The “rush” process as we see it today in web2 is heavily centered around social relationships, and the one for a web3 equivalent would be too.\n\nAside from rush, another common characteristic of Greek life is themed parties. DAOs have already done this—for the [FWB (Friends with Benefits) Paris](https://gallery.fwb.help/fwb-paris) party that happened this past year, members had to hold 75 $FWB community tokens to RSVP. If contributions to the organization (participating in chapter meetings, leading community service events, organizing a fundraiser, etc.) are all recorded on-chain and measured with tools like [Sourcecred](https://sourcecred.io/), these social events can act as privileges to unlock for those who not only pull their weight, but are most invested in the community.\n\n#### Close Proximity to Peers\n\nLiving around other people your age and finding community based on physical proximity is a core part of the university social experience. This one is tougher for DAOs to replace because housing would have to be systematically organized by the community, but there’s no reason why DAOs can’t have their own co-living programs, especially since we are seeing the unbundling of campus social life in web2 already with initiatives by [Edyfi](https://edyfi.org/) and [On Deck](https://www.beondeck.com/). A side note is that this, along with all other IRL events, would necessitate that DAO membership is not anonymous, which is perhaps an unfounded assumption for what web3 universities would be like 🤔\n\n#### Dating Scene\n\nThe last aspect of social life on campus is the dating scene. As a college student, you are around arguably the highest concentration of people your age searching for significant others; the use of dating apps is particularly prevalent in and around college campuses. In web2, the dating scene is not exactly fostered by the organization (university); it is neither encouraged nor discouraged. This could change in web3, with baked-in mechanisms to reward people for matchmaking.\n\n[https://twitter.com/fullyallocated/status/1434364044446687235?s=20](https://twitter.com/fullyallocated/status/1434364044446687235?s=20)\n\nDepending on how much the community believes in the importance of this, a DAO could build its own matchmaking tools for its members. They could also hold collaborative functions to mix and match certain DAOs (ex. [Flamingo](https://flamingodao.xyz/) x [PleasrDAO](https://pleasr.org/)), something like a series of frat and sorority mixers that facilitate meeting more people.\n\nThe starkest contrast between a social experience at university vs. in a DAO is that DAOs exist primarily online. The key to unlocking comparable social experiences for young people in a web3 world is to organize IRL events for DAO members.\n\n### Path Toward Professional “Success”\n\n*How can the organization support students’ professional endeavors?*\n\nParts of the university experience that increase students’ likelihood for professional success have already been mentioned: credentials and participation in clubs and organizations. Universities also support students on their path toward “success” in various other ways. I put quotes around “success” here because...well, students optimize for different things. Common measures of postgraduate success at *my* school are 1) how much money you make in your new grad job, 2) how well-known the company you work for is, and 3) how much optionality your new grad gig affords you.\n\nHere on campus, there is a career center that provides job interview preparation, resources for writing resumes and cold emails, and networking opportunities with companies the school has relationships with (a large portion of which are finance and consulting firms). These relationships and resources, along with an expansive alumni network (and a diploma which typically boosts income for new grads compared to their counterparts without one) are a huge draw for prospective students.\n\nCan DAOs replace this?\n\nThis is hard to answer, because this is probably not the right question to ask. The assumption here is that students come to university to ultimately get jobs and be “successful.” I don’t know if most people will join DAOs to get jobs elsewhere; this is certainly not the case in the status quo. DAOs are communities, not machines to train and prepare people for corporate positions (sorry Duke…have to be honest about my perspective here). The very essence of a DAO goes against the traditional ideas of “work” and “success” that many of us grow up with, and I love that.\n\nWhat I do know is that web3 organizations are likely more meritocratic, which lends themselves to being more effective when matching people with the right skills to the right roles. Gone are the days of college students padding resumes and exaggerating their experiences to get jobs from employers who arbitrarily define their hiring processes and job requirements. My hope is that in a web3 world, finding roles that fit your interests and experiences is much more straightforward. Maybe there’s a person or group of people you really want to work with. You could join their DAO and start doing work to prove yourself, as well as witness firsthand how these people work together and how the DAO functions internally. If you did this with companies, it would be like getting to know the workplace before signing a job offer there. No more painting falsehoods from either side; your personal branding will be based on your on-chain work history, and you get to know an employer beyond what their website and recruiters tell you.\n\nDAOs solve the broken college → industry system we’re seeing in the status quo today, which stems from huge incentive misalignment. It’s true that a lot of students want high-paying, stable jobs right out of college, which is why many of them make the investment in attending elite universities. Elite universities want the same; the more wealthy graduates there are, the more likely the university is to make money from alumni donations (and the elevated status of its brand from its association with alumni at elite firms). Universities *market themselves* very differently though—as places to explore your intellectual curiosities, discover what you want to do with your life, and be on your way to unlocking the best opportunities for whatever you’re interested in. From my perspective, it’s no coincidence that of all the students who come into college wanting to study a wide variety of different subjects and pursue their interests, many end up in investment banking, consulting, and big tech positions right out of college. But we know that not all young people want to go into these jobs. I recognize that this is *grossly* over-simplified and very informed by my personal experiences, but the point here is to demonstrate that incentives are misaligned between individual community members and those who oversee governance within universities. How much do universities really encourage us to think critically about our professional lives? How much do they encourage us to pursue our passions and interests?\n\n### Education\n\n*How can the organization help students gain knowledge and skills? What does a fulfilling learning experience look like?*\n\nAh, yes—education. Acquiring a breadth of knowledge, being intellectually stimulated, and having your worldview expanded. The supposed reason why everyone comes to university and stays here for long enough to earn a degree.\n\nThis is something where, truly, your mileage may vary regardless of the structure of the organization. I’ll keep this relatively short and simple.\n\nAt universities, administrators, deans, and professors come up with a curriculum you must complete via methods outside of your control (submitting an assignment with *x* requirements by *y* date with a couple of tests throughout the semester). I personally do not know how much of what a university claims to be world-class methodologies is actually backed by scientific research, but what I do know is that not everyone learns well via the same methods. Fundamentally, in order to manage the volume of students that come through various programs, universities implement standardized policies that strongly restrict students’ ability to shape their own academic journeys.\n\nWith DAOs, it is very probable that you will actually learn more skills and knowledge relevant to doing what you’re interested in because you’d hopefully have more **creative freedom in the learning process.** Instead of being forced to learn via lectures and homework assignments (the content and format of which you have no control over), you can have more of a say in the methods by which you learn (building projects, creating anthologies, going to book clubs, etc). This applies to both STEM and non-STEM majors, especially because there is nothing preventing experts in all fields from joining DAOs and becoming instructors to guide learning. DAOs *can* impose rules by which people must prove that they learned things (the degree to which will vary), but I imagine the rules would be a lot less arbitrary and plentiful than in university, simply because *the community would define the rules*.\n\nThe model for formal education in a DAO could be an essay in itself (all of the categories could be). I believe DAOs would be most effective not trying to create the web3 parallel of university education, but get at the core reasons for why people come to university to “learn”—one of which is to pick up the necessary skills in preparation for post-graduation goals. For a Computer Science student, the model that comes to mind for me here is online coding bootcamps and workshops—learn skills relevant to a role and/or industry you’re interested in. DAOs would be more community-oriented than typical bootcamps, but that’s where the magic is: instead of an instructor being paid to teach you React.js for four weeks (and then everyone dips), students could earn tokens for learning in workshops and completing projects, and instructors can earn tokens for running workshop series. After students “graduate” from the programming, they could put a percentage of their earnings back into the DAO, something similar to Lambda School’s business model. This, in addition to the tokens they earned throughout the learning process, creates strong incentives for graduates to stay involved in the community. This could look like referring high-potential talent to the DAO, advising and mentoring newer DAO members, and connecting other members to employment opportunities. DAOs are an opportunity for us to re-think how to balance operating at scale and providing high-quality learning experiences.\n\n## The Other Characteristics of a University\n\n### Admissions\n\n*How is membership decided?*\n\nToday, students tell universities, “I have xyz accomplishments, and my aptitude is high enough (see test scores) to attend your school.” Schools review applications (composed of class grades, extracurricular activities, test scores, and personal essays) to admit students based on their potential to:\n\n1. Succeed academically and obtain their degree\n2. Strengthen the school’s branding through their accomplishments during and after university\n\nOf course, schools also supposedly evaluate students based on whether they’d fit campus culture and what they’d be involved in on campus according to their interests. They also take into account athletic ability, and for *some reason* they ask who your parents are and where they went to school.\n\nI’m not an admissions officer, but I assume that universities would want to recruit students who can ultimately contribute financially to the school, whether that is directly as alumni or indirectly through their accomplishments. If someone went to Harvard and ultimately ends up becoming a well-known and important figure, this boost’s Harvard’s signal as a school that both attracts and produces people who will become well-known and important figures. Status.\n\nAdmissions for DAOs have been a hot topic as of late. Many DAOs are token-gated―Friends with Benefits requires potential new members to fill out an application, join their Discord, and buy 75 $FWB tokens after approval. The quickest way to acquire these community tokens is to swap fiat currency for them via a decentralized exchange (DEX) such as [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/). Acquire the tokens, and you’ll gain access to what the DAO has to offer as a stakeholder in the organization. “A [fixed total](https://www.fwb.help/join) of 1M $FWB tokens exist,” meaning that (until a community vote changes this) there is technically a limit to how many people can ultimately join the DAO. I personally don’t believe token-gating is the answer to admissions for web3 universities. Over time, I expect DAO admissions processes to encompass volunteering to do work for the organization over time and earning eventual membership. (That is not to say that buying your way into a DAO is dissimilar to donating a lot to an institution to increase chances for admission.)\n\nThe most promising aspect of admissions in a web3 world is that the college application process for students could be so much more streamlined thanks to the blockchain. Because the work students did leading up to college could be verified and made public for anyone to see, the amount of time, money, and effort students pour into college applications now would drastically decrease in web3. The only aspect of today’s college application process that would still need to occur is an evaluation of community compatibility (the closest web2 equivalent of which is an interview with an alumnus).\n\n“But wait,” you say, “we don’t necessarily want to optimize for meritocracy in college admissions.” To that, I say, gaining a holistic view of who a person is, what their interests and hobbies are, and what their goals are for attending university would be much easier and truer to the word “holistic” in a web3 world (where more of our lives are online) than just reading a couple of essays they wrote about who they are.\n\n### Cost & Length of Time Attended\n\n*What do you pay to become a member? How does that affect how long you stay?*\n\nWe all know that the cost of higher education is exorbitantly high and becoming more inaccessible each year. I doubt that the financial cost of getting into a DAO equivalent would equate to what we see with universities, although it’s not impossible for fees to rise to tens of thousands of dollars, especially because DAOs (as we know them today) are vulnerable to market volatility.\n\nAt universities, students pay tuition at the start of each term, and in return, they receive the right to register for classes and work toward degree requirements. For undergraduate students, this typically lasts for four years (two years for liberal arts/general education and two years for specialized classes within certain disciplines), after which they are off into the real world where each subsequent year the university calls them asking for alumni donations. Even though students’ tuition fees don’t usually go toward universities’ endowments, alumni donations do. Regardless, neither students nor alumni have much of a say in where their money goes. (There are other opportunity costs of attending university vs. doing something else with your life depending on who you are, but I’ll focus on the financial cost here.)\n\nWith token-gated DAOs, participants pay for tokens as a one-time entry fee. These tokens are pooled into the DAO treasury, where funds are allocated as the community sees fit. For [Lion DAO](https://blockchain.mirror.xyz/d2pxavq9Bztp6kCzF9UjtoJEnFTY9Oks3RPkrcBUsKg), launched by student organization Blockchain@Columbia this past summer, DAO funds are used to host guest speaker events, sponsor the development of new educational material, facilitate internal blockchain R&D, and reward grants to NYC students contributing to blockchain efforts. Community members have more of a say in what the DAO spends money on.\n\nWhat’s interesting here is how directly the cost correlates to a student’s incentive to contribute to the organization, and how that influences how long they are a member. In web2, many students pay a hefty sum for the goods they receive, and after their time is up and they get the degree, there really isn’t anything tangible incentivizing them to continue to contribute to the university (donating money, helping it become more well-known, etc). In web3, however, token ownership doesn’t necessarily terminate after your education is formally marked as “complete” (if that would even be a thing in web3). A lifelong token holder and contributor could be a lifelong member of that DAO. FWB has a “[seasons](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/TvKSPfZqHNXRZVYFYyJuziCMIZ8fZ34q585YcUYRGtc)” model; if participants stay active and still hold a certain amount of tokens by the end of a season, they retain the right to continue accessing FWB’s offerings. Initial payment for entry gives individuals a stake in the organization and incentivizes them to contribute value to the community for as long as they retain that financial investment.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, I think web3 could flip the entire idea of an education on its head—why do you stop “becoming educated” after you graduate from school? Why do all of the amazing things you enjoyed about college abruptly end after four years? DAOs have the potential to unlock *tangible lifelong value* for token holders, not just financially.\n\n## So…?\n\nIf you give a bunch of college students control over the direction of their collective organization, maybe it would turn out to be a Lord of the Flies disaster, but I think if you had a DAO made up of driven, curious, and ambitious college students (arguably what universities are supposed to be made up of), a lot of really cool stuff could happen. (DAOs also don’t have to be purely made up of students. My hope is that an outcome of DAOs as university replacements would be a decrease of “administrative bloat.” I mean, [come on guys](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2019/12/duke-university-administrators-tax-pay-mike-krzyzewski-price-health-system-endowment).) The web3 equivalent of a university experience doesn’t even have to reside within a single DAO—college could be unbundled into multiple DAOs, each serving a different purpose along these categories.\n\nAs a last note, this is by no means comprehensive—each of the sections I discussed in this could be their own essays. (I didn’t even touch upon graduate degrees and the research that universities conduct, and how that influences university professors’ incentives when it comes to teaching courses. I also didn’t focus on the aspect of finding identity and belonging at university, and how that relates to coming of age.) In addition to me just sharing my thoughts, my hope is that this can act as a student voice in the conversations happening right now around **building experiences for young people in web3**. I can’t conclusively say that DAO equivalents of universities would be an objectively better experience for everyone who attends university now, as we are still early and have a long way to go. DAOs have social, economic, and political implications that could result in huge societal shifts. All of crypto does…which is why people are so excited about it.\n\n\n---\n\nA huge thank you to [Adithya Vellal](https://twitter.com/avellal14), [Kanan Rengaraju](https://twitter.com/KananRengaraju), Luke Qin, and [Rishi Tripathy](https://twitter.com/rishi_tripathy_) for helping me structure my stream of consciousness :)\n\nIf you’re new here—I’m Kassen, and I’m a generalist with a CS and Cultural Anthropology background trying to break into web3 because it perfectly combines my interests.

In my opinion, these are not the most integral parts of the university experience and don’t necessarily need a web3 parallel.\n\nBefore we dive in, let’s address the fundamental difference between a university and a DAO: one is highly centralized, and the other is decentralized.\n\n## The Nature of a DAO\n\nA DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, which means the rules by which it operates as well as its financial transactions are recorded on the blockchain for anyone to see. There are many different types of DAOs (financial, social, etc.), but the common thread is that there is no central governing entity of the organization that makes decisions for everyone. Instead, community members drive governance through democratic processes.\n\nIn my opinion, the most significant aspect of DAOs is that they allow us to **re-imagine incentive structures** within organizations. This is especially interesting when it comes to the university, an incredibly complex organization with a high number of different stakeholders (students, parents, teaching faculty, administration + board of trustees, non-faculty employees, etc.), all with their own set of incentives. Universities are very top-down, whereas DAOs are very bottom-up.\n\nA lot of companies are trying to unbundle the college experience—how could DAOs unbundle and “re-bundle” in a better way?\n\n## DAOs as University Replacements\n\n### Credentials\n\n*How can this organization act as an indicator of an individual’s qualifications?*\n\nWhen you are admitted to and attend a university, you are now associated with its brand name, which offers you the credentials of being someone intelligent, driven, and accomplished, amongst other traits. The more selective and well-known the university is, the more you are set apart from the masses, and the stronger this credentialing is. These credentials give you [status](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/signaling-on-the-internet), the more of which you accrue, the more levers you can pull with it (social, political, professional, etc). Status is one of the only (and strongest) things aligning the differing incentives of university stakeholders.\n\nIn a web3 world, there is nothing really preventing a similar status hierarchy from emerging—there will be DAOs that are more gated than others and DAOs that are more elite and desirable than others. Status signaling is inherent to human nature, and as is our correlation between exclusivity and desirability. In this sense, the web3 equivalent of university credentialing would look pretty much the same (being a part of certain DAOs gives you more credibility).\n\nHowever, if we are optimizing for “true” credentialing, this is something that is best done in web3 due to more transparency and meritocracy. If everything you do to contribute to the DAO’s community (running interest-based clubs, conducting peer learning workshops, etc.) is recorded on-chain, it’s very easy for your peers (or anyone) to verify that you did those things. Now, it’s not just the name of the organization that lends you credibility, or what you tell other people you did...it’s what you actually did.\n\nThis then calls into question: why do we need these organizations then? If my own accomplishments are on a public ledger for anyone to see, do I really need to be a part of a DAO for the credentials?\n\nWell, it’s not just about the credentials.\n\n### Social Life\n\n*How can the organization facilitate the building and maintenance of social relationships?*\n\nIn my opinion, the prospect of making new friends and experiencing the *lively social scene* is also one of the main reasons people go to college. Social life on campus is roughly made up of:\n\n* Clubs and organizations\n* Greek life\n* Living in close proximity with other people your age\n* Dating scene\n\n#### Clubs and Organizations\n\nStarting with clubs and organizations, I believe that interest-based DAOs would be able to provide a more fulfilling experience for both students and faculty. At universities, people often join clubs to 1) meet people with the same interests and 2) pad their resume for professional pursuits. Most participants are not tangibly rewarded by the club or the university for the work they do, it’s easy to misconstrue the degree to which they participated, and almost everyone stops participating after graduation. (That is assuming they stick with the club throughout all of college; anyone who made prior commitments can quit at anytime if they don’t feel personally incentivized to contribute anymore.) Furthermore, a lot of clubs and organizations are not great at documenting their rules and practices, resulting in huge changes in both structure and culture as seniors graduate and new leadership takes over.\n\nThe web3 parallel of student organizations right now is that DAOs use Discord channels for certain interests (art, gaming, etc). If we view DAOs themselves as clubs utilizing social/community tokens, participants would be (*at least* financially) incentivized to contribute to the sustainability of the organization over the long term, even after they “graduate.” As long as a member holds the tokens, they will be invested in the DAO and contribute in the hopes of increasing the token’s value and receiving individual rewards. This token-based model introduces **a financial incentive that strengthens personal incentives to contribute to the community**. Participation could be transparently recorded (ex. receiving different NFTs for attending and hosting events), and the direction of the DAO’s activities would be driven by community members’ voting power through the utilization of tools like [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/). This means that everyone in a DAO, regardless of their role within the DAO, has a common, overarching incentive that is difficult to outweigh by other incentives. Whether this model is good or bad in the big picture is up to interpretation; for more thoughts on this, I’ll refer you to [“The Token Society”](https://www.drorpoleg.com/the-token-society/) by Drorg Poleg and [“Social Token Paradox”](https://gaby.mirror.xyz/zqchiBQhWWS49gaabLU92-BUUwfBL5aHCtNT88VTI8o) by Gaby Goldberg.\n\nIn addition to aligning individual incentives more effectively within the organization, web3 clubs could have much better documentation of membership, internal processes, organization history, traditions, and more. DAOs also solve the problem that many clubs deal with on a regular basis in web2: they have to follow the rules that the university imposes on spending, membership, and utilization of community spaces that may impede on the quality and speed of activity. With DAOs, those trying to organize community activities and those enforcing rules and regulations would act in consensus by vote (and at the very least, be more on the same page).\n\n#### Greek Life\n\nRegarding Greek life, the DAO itself could be a fraternity or sorority, perhaps with a national DAO and regional or local DAO chapters that belong to the national collective. This type of organizational structure could certainly be supported in web3, with a similar “rush” process for potential new members to get to know what being in the DAO is like and for DAO members to meet potential new members. The “rush” process as we see it today in web2 is heavily centered around social relationships, and the one for a web3 equivalent would be too.\n\nAside from rush, another common characteristic of Greek life is themed parties. DAOs have already done this—for the [FWB (Friends with Benefits) Paris](https://gallery.fwb.help/fwb-paris) party that happened this past year, members had to hold 75 $FWB community tokens to RSVP. If contributions to the organization (participating in chapter meetings, leading community service events, organizing a fundraiser, etc.) are all recorded on-chain and measured with tools like [Sourcecred](https://sourcecred.io/), these social events can act as privileges to unlock for those who not only pull their weight, but are most invested in the community.\n\n#### Close Proximity to Peers\n\nLiving around other people your age and finding community based on physical proximity is a core part of the university social experience. This one is tougher for DAOs to replace because housing would have to be systematically organized by the community, but there’s no reason why DAOs can’t have their own co-living programs, especially since we are seeing the unbundling of campus social life in web2 already with initiatives by [Edyfi](https://edyfi.org/) and [On Deck](https://www.beondeck.com/). A side note is that this, along with all other IRL events, would necessitate that DAO membership is not anonymous, which is perhaps an unfounded assumption for what web3 universities would be like 🤔\n\n#### Dating Scene\n\nThe last aspect of social life on campus is the dating scene. As a college student, you are around arguably the highest concentration of people your age searching for significant others; the use of dating apps is particularly prevalent in and around college campuses. In web2, the dating scene is not exactly fostered by the organization (university); it is neither encouraged nor discouraged. This could change in web3, with baked-in mechanisms to reward people for matchmaking.\n\n[https://twitter.com/fullyallocated/status/1434364044446687235?s=20](https://twitter.com/fullyallocated/status/1434364044446687235?s=20)\n\nDepending on how much the community believes in the importance of this, a DAO could build its own matchmaking tools for its members. They could also hold collaborative functions to mix and match certain DAOs (ex. [Flamingo](https://flamingodao.xyz/) x [PleasrDAO](https://pleasr.org/)), something like a series of frat and sorority mixers that facilitate meeting more people.\n\nThe starkest contrast between a social experience at university vs. in a DAO is that DAOs exist primarily online. The key to unlocking comparable social experiences for young people in a web3 world is to organize IRL events for DAO members.\n\n### Path Toward Professional “Success”\n\n*How can the organization support students’ professional endeavors?*\n\nParts of the university experience that increase students’ likelihood for professional success have already been mentioned: credentials and participation in clubs and organizations. Universities also support students on their path toward “success” in various other ways. I put quotes around “success” here because...well, students optimize for different things. Common measures of postgraduate success at *my* school are 1) how much money you make in your new grad job, 2) how well-known the company you work for is, and 3) how much optionality your new grad gig affords you.\n\nHere on campus, there is a career center that provides job interview preparation, resources for writing resumes and cold emails, and networking opportunities with companies the school has relationships with (a large portion of which are finance and consulting firms). These relationships and resources, along with an expansive alumni network (and a diploma which typically boosts income for new grads compared to their counterparts without one) are a huge draw for prospective students.\n\nCan DAOs replace this?\n\nThis is hard to answer, because this is probably not the right question to ask. The assumption here is that students come to university to ultimately get jobs and be “successful.” I don’t know if most people will join DAOs to get jobs elsewhere; this is certainly not the case in the status quo. DAOs are communities, not machines to train and prepare people for corporate positions (sorry Duke…have to be honest about my perspective here). The very essence of a DAO goes against the traditional ideas of “work” and “success” that many of us grow up with, and I love that.\n\nWhat I do know is that web3 organizations are likely more meritocratic, which lends themselves to being more effective when matching people with the right skills to the right roles. Gone are the days of college students padding resumes and exaggerating their experiences to get jobs from employers who arbitrarily define their hiring processes and job requirements. My hope is that in a web3 world, finding roles that fit your interests and experiences is much more straightforward. Maybe there’s a person or group of people you really want to work with. You could join their DAO and start doing work to prove yourself, as well as witness firsthand how these people work together and how the DAO functions internally. If you did this with companies, it would be like getting to know the workplace before signing a job offer there. No more painting falsehoods from either side; your personal branding will be based on your on-chain work history, and you get to know an employer beyond what their website and recruiters tell you.\n\nDAOs solve the broken college → industry system we’re seeing in the status quo today, which stems from huge incentive misalignment. It’s true that a lot of students want high-paying, stable jobs right out of college, which is why many of them make the investment in attending elite universities. Elite universities want the same; the more wealthy graduates there are, the more likely the university is to make money from alumni donations (and the elevated status of its brand from its association with alumni at elite firms). Universities *market themselves* very differently though—as places to explore your intellectual curiosities, discover what you want to do with your life, and be on your way to unlocking the best opportunities for whatever you’re interested in. From my perspective, it’s no coincidence that of all the students who come into college wanting to study a wide variety of different subjects and pursue their interests, many end up in investment banking, consulting, and big tech positions right out of college. But we know that not all young people want to go into these jobs. I recognize that this is *grossly* over-simplified and very informed by my personal experiences, but the point here is to demonstrate that incentives are misaligned between individual community members and those who oversee governance within universities. How much do universities really encourage us to think critically about our professional lives? How much do they encourage us to pursue our passions and interests?\n\n### Education\n\n*How can the organization help students gain knowledge and skills? What does a fulfilling learning experience look like?*\n\nAh, yes—education. Acquiring a breadth of knowledge, being intellectually stimulated, and having your worldview expanded. The supposed reason why everyone comes to university and stays here for long enough to earn a degree.\n\nThis is something where, truly, your mileage may vary regardless of the structure of the organization. I’ll keep this relatively short and simple.\n\nAt universities, administrators, deans, and professors come up with a curriculum you must complete via methods outside of your control (submitting an assignment with *x* requirements by *y* date with a couple of tests throughout the semester). I personally do not know how much of what a university claims to be world-class methodologies is actually backed by scientific research, but what I do know is that not everyone learns well via the same methods. Fundamentally, in order to manage the volume of students that come through various programs, universities implement standardized policies that strongly restrict students’ ability to shape their own academic journeys.\n\nWith DAOs, it is very probable that you will actually learn more skills and knowledge relevant to doing what you’re interested in because you’d hopefully have more **creative freedom in the learning process.** Instead of being forced to learn via lectures and homework assignments (the content and format of which you have no control over), you can have more of a say in the methods by which you learn (building projects, creating anthologies, going to book clubs, etc). This applies to both STEM and non-STEM majors, especially because there is nothing preventing experts in all fields from joining DAOs and becoming instructors to guide learning. DAOs *can* impose rules by which people must prove that they learned things (the degree to which will vary), but I imagine the rules would be a lot less arbitrary and plentiful than in university, simply because *the community would define the rules*.\n\nThe model for formal education in a DAO could be an essay in itself (all of the categories could be). I believe DAOs would be most effective not trying to create the web3 parallel of university education, but get at the core reasons for why people come to university to “learn”—one of which is to pick up the necessary skills in preparation for post-graduation goals. For a Computer Science student, the model that comes to mind for me here is online coding bootcamps and workshops—learn skills relevant to a role and/or industry you’re interested in. DAOs would be more community-oriented than typical bootcamps, but that’s where the magic is: instead of an instructor being paid to teach you React.js for four weeks (and then everyone dips), students could earn tokens for learning in workshops and completing projects, and instructors can earn tokens for running workshop series. After students “graduate” from the programming, they could put a percentage of their earnings back into the DAO, something similar to Lambda School’s business model. This, in addition to the tokens they earned throughout the learning process, creates strong incentives for graduates to stay involved in the community. This could look like referring high-potential talent to the DAO, advising and mentoring newer DAO members, and connecting other members to employment opportunities. DAOs are an opportunity for us to re-think how to balance operating at scale and providing high-quality learning experiences.\n\n## The Other Characteristics of a University\n\n### Admissions\n\n*How is membership decided?*\n\nToday, students tell universities, “I have xyz accomplishments, and my aptitude is high enough (see test scores) to attend your school.” Schools review applications (composed of class grades, extracurricular activities, test scores, and personal essays) to admit students based on their potential to:\n\n1. Succeed academically and obtain their degree\n2. Strengthen the school’s branding through their accomplishments during and after university\n\nOf course, schools also supposedly evaluate students based on whether they’d fit campus culture and what they’d be involved in on campus according to their interests. They also take into account athletic ability, and for *some reason* they ask who your parents are and where they went to school.\n\nI’m not an admissions officer, but I assume that universities would want to recruit students who can ultimately contribute financially to the school, whether that is directly as alumni or indirectly through their accomplishments. If someone went to Harvard and ultimately ends up becoming a well-known and important figure, this boost’s Harvard’s signal as a school that both attracts and produces people who will become well-known and important figures. Status.\n\nAdmissions for DAOs have been a hot topic as of late. Many DAOs are token-gated―Friends with Benefits requires potential new members to fill out an application, join their Discord, and buy 75 $FWB tokens after approval. The quickest way to acquire these community tokens is to swap fiat currency for them via a decentralized exchange (DEX) such as [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/). Acquire the tokens, and you’ll gain access to what the DAO has to offer as a stakeholder in the organization. “A [fixed total](https://www.fwb.help/join) of 1M $FWB tokens exist,” meaning that (until a community vote changes this) there is technically a limit to how many people can ultimately join the DAO. I personally don’t believe token-gating is the answer to admissions for web3 universities. Over time, I expect DAO admissions processes to encompass volunteering to do work for the organization over time and earning eventual membership. (That is not to say that buying your way into a DAO is dissimilar to donating a lot to an institution to increase chances for admission.)\n\nThe most promising aspect of admissions in a web3 world is that the college application process for students could be so much more streamlined thanks to the blockchain. Because the work students did leading up to college could be verified and made public for anyone to see, the amount of time, money, and effort students pour into college applications now would drastically decrease in web3. The only aspect of today’s college application process that would still need to occur is an evaluation of community compatibility (the closest web2 equivalent of which is an interview with an alumnus).\n\n“But wait,” you say, “we don’t necessarily want to optimize for meritocracy in college admissions.” To that, I say, gaining a holistic view of who a person is, what their interests and hobbies are, and what their goals are for attending university would be much easier and truer to the word “holistic” in a web3 world (where more of our lives are online) than just reading a couple of essays they wrote about who they are.\n\n### Cost & Length of Time Attended\n\n*What do you pay to become a member? How does that affect how long you stay?*\n\nWe all know that the cost of higher education is exorbitantly high and becoming more inaccessible each year. I doubt that the financial cost of getting into a DAO equivalent would equate to what we see with universities, although it’s not impossible for fees to rise to tens of thousands of dollars, especially because DAOs (as we know them today) are vulnerable to market volatility.\n\nAt universities, students pay tuition at the start of each term, and in return, they receive the right to register for classes and work toward degree requirements. For undergraduate students, this typically lasts for four years (two years for liberal arts/general education and two years for specialized classes within certain disciplines), after which they are off into the real world where each subsequent year the university calls them asking for alumni donations. Even though students’ tuition fees don’t usually go toward universities’ endowments, alumni donations do. Regardless, neither students nor alumni have much of a say in where their money goes. (There are other opportunity costs of attending university vs. doing something else with your life depending on who you are, but I’ll focus on the financial cost here.)\n\nWith token-gated DAOs, participants pay for tokens as a one-time entry fee. These tokens are pooled into the DAO treasury, where funds are allocated as the community sees fit. For [Lion DAO](https://blockchain.mirror.xyz/d2pxavq9Bztp6kCzF9UjtoJEnFTY9Oks3RPkrcBUsKg), launched by student organization Blockchain@Columbia this past summer, DAO funds are used to host guest speaker events, sponsor the development of new educational material, facilitate internal blockchain R&D, and reward grants to NYC students contributing to blockchain efforts. Community members have more of a say in what the DAO spends money on.\n\nWhat’s interesting here is how directly the cost correlates to a student’s incentive to contribute to the organization, and how that influences how long they are a member. In web2, many students pay a hefty sum for the goods they receive, and after their time is up and they get the degree, there really isn’t anything tangible incentivizing them to continue to contribute to the university (donating money, helping it become more well-known, etc). In web3, however, token ownership doesn’t necessarily terminate after your education is formally marked as “complete” (if that would even be a thing in web3). A lifelong token holder and contributor could be a lifelong member of that DAO. FWB has a “[seasons](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/TvKSPfZqHNXRZVYFYyJuziCMIZ8fZ34q585YcUYRGtc)” model; if participants stay active and still hold a certain amount of tokens by the end of a season, they retain the right to continue accessing FWB’s offerings. Initial payment for entry gives individuals a stake in the organization and incentivizes them to contribute value to the community for as long as they retain that financial investment.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, I think web3 could flip the entire idea of an education on its head—why do you stop “becoming educated” after you graduate from school? Why do all of the amazing things you enjoyed about college abruptly end after four years? DAOs have the potential to unlock *tangible lifelong value* for token holders, not just financially.\n\n## So…?\n\nIf you give a bunch of college students control over the direction of their collective organization, maybe it would turn out to be a Lord of the Flies disaster, but I think if you had a DAO made up of driven, curious, and ambitious college students (arguably what universities are supposed to be made up of), a lot of really cool stuff could happen. (DAOs also don’t have to be purely made up of students. My hope is that an outcome of DAOs as university replacements would be a decrease of “administrative bloat.” I mean, [come on guys](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2019/12/duke-university-administrators-tax-pay-mike-krzyzewski-price-health-system-endowment).) The web3 equivalent of a university experience doesn’t even have to reside within a single DAO—college could be unbundled into multiple DAOs, each serving a different purpose along these categories.\n\nAs a last note, this is by no means comprehensive—each of the sections I discussed in this could be their own essays. (I didn’t even touch upon graduate degrees and the research that universities conduct, and how that influences university professors’ incentives when it comes to teaching courses. I also didn’t focus on the aspect of finding identity and belonging at university, and how that relates to coming of age.) In addition to me just sharing my thoughts, my hope is that this can act as a student voice in the conversations happening right now around **building experiences for young people in web3**. I can’t conclusively say that DAO equivalents of universities would be an objectively better experience for everyone who attends university now, as we are still early and have a long way to go. DAOs have social, economic, and political implications that could result in huge societal shifts. All of crypto does…which is why people are so excited about it.\n\n\n---\n\nA huge thank you to [Adithya Vellal](https://twitter.com/avellal14), [Kanan Rengaraju](https://twitter.com/KananRengaraju), Luke Qin, and [Rishi Tripathy](https://twitter.com/rishi_tripathy_) for helping me structure my stream of consciousness :)\n\nIf you’re new here—I’m Kassen, and I’m a generalist with a CS and Cultural Anthropology background trying to break into web3 because it perfectly combines my interests.

{"id": "qHs_pr9axWEtB5Rd4Cfb1udMC2mLaZ_QebJYiwjHvog", "title": "DAOs and Progressive Decentralization of the CFO", "body": "CFOs are responsible for optimizing capital structures, allocating financial resources, forecasting future performance, and more. The modern CFO works well for C-Corps, but we’re shifting towards decentralization. As DAO treasuries accumulate billions of dollars of assets, we need to ask the question: “What does the CFO look like in a decentralized economy?”\n\n**TLDR:** DAO [treasuries are massive](https://deepdao.io/#/deepdao/dashboard) (nearly $10B), but today they are not capital efficient. This negatively impacts protocol growth and stakeholder utility maximization. Tools are being built to manage treasuries, but we need operators to make the decisions and execute. It’s time to rethink the CFO from first principles.\n\n#### **A brief history on the CFO**\n\nCFOs are a relatively recent creation. Up until the 1970s, financial governance was largely limited to bookkeeping. Then came regulation. In 1976, the SEC issued a mandate requiring increased reporting for large public companies. Increased visibility drove financial scrutiny. Markets realized that optimized financial planning (ie managing cost of capital and allocating capital towards highest ROI opportunities) could help a business grow faster and more efficiently than competitors. Thus, the modern CFO was born.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2142bb39-eaac-4e1b-948b-5655b2739a9d_968x726.png)\n\n#### **What are DAOs?**\n\nShort for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a DAO is an internet-native entity governed by a decentralized ownership base and enforced by transparent smart contracts. Democratization of voting rights to all token holders reduces risk of incentive misalignment. Once a decision is made, it is enforced by code (ie smart contracts), reducing the risk of corruption and non-compliance.\n\nThe mechanism for governing DAOs is a governance token. Let’s compare a governance token to a traditional share in a C-Corp:\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0200be3b-6add-486a-bfe6-be2f9caca53d_752x255.png)\n\nBecause the release of tokens can be managed entirely by code, DAOs can create flexible token distribution schemes. This allows projects across a variety of use cases to improve incentive alignment as they optimize for certain business metrics (ie revenue). A few examples below:\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e57c73e-8569-46da-87c3-309d02ccef75_931x469.png)\n\n#### **What are the issues with DAO financial management**\n\nRevenue generating [DAOs have nearly $10B](https://deepdao.io/#/deepdao/dashboard) sitting largely untouched in their treasuries. Regardless of whether you believe the funds should be deployed [faster or slower](https://twitter.com/kylesamani/status/1413841074167107586?s=12), the status quo is not capital efficient. These funds could be used for marketing, educating regulators, building partnerships, product development, dividends, [acquisitions](https://www.coindesk.com/polygon-merges-with-hermez-network-in-250m-deal), etc.\n\nThis is the result of coordination failure. I’d posit several drivers of this failure:\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6520fa83-5a62-4e28-97d7-9a42f799c538_1338x518.png)\n\nThis is not a new problem, people have discussed it [before](https://twitter.com/verbine/status/1315959108684722176). Projects are building toolkits to better manage a DAOs finances. [Parcel](https://parcel.money/) launched a toolkit for payouts, token buybacks, and more. [Llama](https://www.llama.xyz/) is building tools for DAO treasury management, including cash flow visualization and DAO-to-DAO token swaps. [Index](https://www.indexcoop.com/) is launching slippage minimization solutions for treasury diversification. **The toolkit is emerging, now we need the 'CFO’ to operate.**\n\n#### **Who, or what, should be the CFO of a DAO?**\n\nThe solution needs to a) intelligently manage stakeholder attention, b) optimize for domain expertise, and c) create feedback loops for constant improvement. All this needs to be done while maintaining decentralization to ensure resilience and minimize corruption.\n\nThe progressive decentralization of the DAO CFO is underway. We’re somewhere between stage 1 and stage 2 today.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6de57768-7f09-42a9-a73d-c60b4defd388_791x459.png)\n\n**Stage 1: Informal Management.** Community members or small groups of members launch proposals to the DAO. They lobby for a proposal’s merits through forums and Discord conversations.\n\nRecent Example: [Sushi Phantom Troupe](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushi-phantom-troupe-strategic-raise/4554/1). A proposal was made from VCs to the community to purchase $60M of tokens from the project’s treasury.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb0da60a-e4ae-42b4-bcb9-969c1ac30173_624x169.png)\n\n**Stage 2: Protocol Governors.** Formal working groups are created to focus attention and talent on financial initiatives. These “governors” can be elected by the DAO (by an owner committing their tokens to an individual) or automatically selected through a pre-coded mechanism. Terms can be fixed or flexible. Candidates can make proposals to DAOs to become a governor (inbound) or DAOs can actively recruit governors to their DAO (outbound). Governors can come as individuals or as guilds (with individuals dedicated to financial planning, reporting, M&A, etc.). It’s likely many permutations are attempted at first, but over time standards form for protocol financial governance structures.\n\nRecent Example: Uniswap Grants. A committee strategically allocates a portion of the treasury to fund new projects. This is loosely parallel to a CVC.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faad6df38-c70a-477a-86ae-765ca5ac5fef_624x170.png)\n\n**Stage 3: Credentialed CFO Guilds.** Reputation of financial governors turns from informal to formal. This could take several forms. DAO members could start evaluating performance of their financial governors through votes, creating an on-chain approval rating. Independent collectives could form as public goods to audit a governor’s track record. Financial governors could begin earning badges signaling their education (ie online courses, [rabbithole.gg](https://rabbithole.gg/)-like financial training, etc.) and experience levels (ie earning a Compound financial planning badge or a MakerDAO acquisitions badge). The quality of financial governors becomes transparent and quantifiable. Governors can inbound ideas to a protocol as an activist investor would propose a strategic financial shift to a public company, and the DAO votes based on the governor’s track record. Alternatively, marketplaces could form for protocols to recruit financial governors. An on-chain reputational data visualizer forms, resulting in a decentralized LinkedIn of sorts.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54a28974-a4b1-4fb6-b5a4-6f9dc54cf022_624x175.png)\n\n#### **Concluding thoughts**\n\nOwnership, corporate governance, and the way we work will meaningfully change over the coming decades. The decentralization of the CFO is just one of many examples. Structure will form to manage the complex systems we’re creating. Looking to the past doesn’t have to create skeuomorphic outcomes. We can analyze today’s structures from first principles to accelerate our progress towards the decentralized economy.\n\n*Note: None of the above is investment advice.

Llevaba ya unas semanas frecuentando esa esquina en el Distrito de las Flores; disfruto cómo la luz se filtra suavemente entre los edificios, pero la principal razón es la escasez de feroces roedores de los que me tengo que cuidar. Pero la abundante presencia de turistas a unas calles de aquí, y la proximidad del verano, son factores que ahora las llevan hacia mí.\n\n![Nueva York, Enero 1, 2017](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XTnFYioBKkSGnRkW_19o0.jpg?height=675&width=1200&&&size=medium)\n\nRecogí mi carrito de supermercado con todo lo que estaba a mi nombre y comencé a caminar sin rumbo claro, pero avanzando. No eran más de las seis de la tarde. El sol comenzaba a caer, y me fui encaminando hacia Times Square. No me emocionaba mucho, pues detestaba ver la repulsión en la gente que me miraba. Después de años aún no me puedo acostumbrar a eso. Todos tenemos nuestras debilidades.\n\nLo único que disfrutaba de la avenida era ver los espectaculares tapizar cada centímetro de los edificios. Éramos siempre testigos de un verdadero orgasmo capitalista. Comenzó un nuevo anuncio. Me sorprendí al ver esos ojos bicolor tan únicos. El cabello ya no existía, pero en su cara el resto de las facciones, aunque ya maduras y toscas, seguían manteniendo la misma semblanza: era Tim; no cabía duda.\n\nNos graduamos hace tres años de la Universidad de Arte. Éramos mundos opuestos, él estudió pintura y yo publicidad. Pero ambos soñábamos con ser iconos de nuestros respectivos cosmos, pero sabíamos, –o al menos yo sí estaba seguro–, que al final realmente eso no significaba nada. Yo gozaba al escribir falsedades para comerciales, mientras Tim pintaba encerrado en sus audífonos. Sus obras eran en el mejor caso mediocres, pero todos evitaban decírselo. Sólo creaba retratos sombríos, era como si arrebatara a sus sujetos el alma con el toque de su pincel. Pero tenía uno en particular que capturaba perfecto lo que sentía cuando veía mi reflejo, un vacío total, que jamás había logrado replicar. Moría por tenerla.\n\nYo tenía el dinero contado en esos días (y todos los anteriores también), y aunque nadie quería comprar sus obras, por principio, jamás pensé en pedirle que me obsequiara una. Así que esa misma noche le planteé una propuesta. Le trocaría un antiguo poema que una de mis ancestras gitanas me heredó, a cambio de mi pintura favorita del repertorio de su última colección. Él se río y preguntó qué tenía de especial el poema. Le aseguré que sólo porque era mi amigo se lo contaba, ya que era un conjuro de Arad, la ciudad de mi familia, poderoso en conceder a quien lo leyera todo lo que deseara, siempre y cuando éste estuviera dispuesto a renunciar a su alma.\n\nNo existía tal cosa, pero supuse que sería lo suficientemente interesante para llamar su atención. Y así parecía. Esa era nuestra noche de graduación y la generación completa decidió ir de fiesta antes del gran evento. Todos con sus vicios, se afinaban en el parque después de una comida con abundantes etílicos. Tim y yo solo fumábamos un cigarro tras otro, hasta que confirmó que por la mañana siguiente realizaríamos el intercambio en su dormitorio. Bebí sin parar durante la celebración. La euforia me consumió, pero aún tenía que resolver el problema que me aquejaba.: ¿Qué le iba a ofrecer a Tim al día siguiente?\n\nHurté una botella de vodka y volví a mi dormitorio. No se me ocurría nada, así que bebí como si la respuesta estuviese al fondo del vidrio. Llegué a él y no había respuesta aún y, enfurecido, mi reacción fue estrellar la botella contra la pared. Enseguida, intenté recoger los cristales, pero me corté la mano izquierda. No lo sentí gracias al alcohol, por lo tanto decidí que sería una buena idea de una vez cauterizar la incisión con el líquido escurrido en el piso. Restregué mi mano con toda mi fuerza para que el exquisito elíxir lograra penetrar la carne expuesta. Comencé a experimentar un leve ardor, pero me desvanecí *ipso facto*.\n\nMe transporté a una tierra de ensueño, donde las calles eran playas, y la iluminación era un atardecer perpetuo, coloreando todo de infinitos tonos rojos y naranjas. Entre palacios caminaba al lado de una ninfa de pelo negro y bikini verde. Grandes puertas nos recibieron en uno de los recintos; y al abrir, una fuente de cantera negra emanaba del suelo. Corrí hacia ella y, al tocar el agua cristalina, me desperté abruptamente bañado en sangre y licor.\n\nCorrí al escritorio y empecé a escribir:\n\n> **Cristo entre cristales rotos** \n>\n> *Labios mordidos con adicción. Dios está aquí con su hijo. El viento cuartea las caras azules. El maquillaje se congela llevando las cargas de los pobres. Por canales paralelos en hielo. Tierra de nieve bajo sus uñas. Arregla sílabas sobre lenguas congeladas. Tratando de recordar las oraciones. El incienso arde en botes de basura, entre mendigos peleando. Jesús de las ciudades, arrastrando campanas desde sus pies. ¿A quién le corresponde la linterna, en el agujero de esta noche?*\n\nDoblé la hoja manchada gravemente con mi sangre y la puse en un sobre en el que escribí inconscientemente la leyenda: “Caballo de batalla de tres patas”, lo más críptico que se me vino a la mente en ese instante. Sabía que le parecería intrigante. Me bañé, junté mis pertenencias y, con maleta en mano, caminé hacia su dormitorio y toqué a la puerta. Acto seguido, le entregué el sobre, mientras que él me ofreció el lienzo que desde hace mucho tenía preparado para mí. Nos abrazamos brevemente y nos despedimos. Desde aquel entonces no sé nada de él.\n\nAl final, desde lo más profundo de nuestras almas, ambos obtuvimos lo que deseábamos: yo el vacío que tanto anhelaba; y él, éxito con su óleo. Intentaré entrar a su inauguración y ver si Tim aún me reconoce…\n\nHasta me hace pensar en mi poder, recién descubierto con los conjuros, para explotarlo en el enigmático y surrealista Mercado de Sonora, sito en la Ciudad de México.", "timestamp": 1633491877, "digest": "M24Uq2NUBCQ8M77xLP2qsJN52SEr3kj8sYMcg2Te_c4", "contributor": "0x40dcd5c751864BF925F590f4F2Fb40AA0B17BB07"}

{"id": "pOM10xWh0uBcUifBdrS3zFjg9DXLQh7fh4jX-TWFoXI", "title": "Loopring Quarterly Update: 2021/Q3 - Loopring Protocol - Medium", "body": "This is the third edition of our Loopring Quarterly Updates. You can catch up on the previous quarter [here](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-quarterly-update-2021-q2-d22571a13568) and you can also receive these updates in your inbox every quarter by subscribing [here](https://loopring.substack.com/).\n\n2021 has been a very busy and productive year for Loopring. The start of 2021 ushered in new major product launches from our AMM to our Smart Wallet. Q2 was a quieter quarter on the release front, but we stayed busy applying the lessons learned of the latest releases to get started on a second generation of all our major products. In Q3 we have begun to see the fruits of all this labor as we continue to roll out new major releases all through the second half of 2021 and into 2022.\n\nWe believe we are on the precipice of a substantial growth inflection point for Loopring and couldn’t be more excited for what will come in the months ahead.\n\n## Summary of Q3\n\n## 1. Loopring NFT support on L2\n\nLoopring now supports [NFT minting, trading, and transfers](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-quarterly-update-2021-q2-d22571a13568) directly on L2 for both ERC721 and ERC1155 token standards.\n\nL2 zkRollups welcome a new era of possibilities for NFTs that go far beyond jpegs. A fast, cheap, and secure trading environment allows creators and developers to experiment in digital ownership even more so than before, opening up greater opportunities for NFTs to flourish.\n\nThis functionality is now the foundation of a new NFT Marketplace that is being built by a partner and set to be launched sometime in Q4.\n\n## 2. Loopring Exchange — a brand new web experience\n\nThe long over-due refresh to the Loopring web experience is finally here.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*xW4yltDkhwCjJC_yxX1Jaw.png)\n\nOur sleek, new UI/UX is now in private beta and ready for selected users for testing. We have many more features to be added to this new web app including a new, full-featured orderbook coming soon.\n\nWe really value your feedback! Feel free to join our [discord here](https://discord.com/invite/KkYccYp) and submit any feedback to us or just join the conversations with other community members.\n\n## 3. Counterfactual Loopring Wallet\n\nOur new Counterfactual Wallet is another major step forward on our mission to onboard the masses into crypto.\n\nThis try-before-you-buy option will allow users to enjoy the gas-free experience of Ethereum L2 right away, without paying any upfront costs. And when users are ready to withdraw their funds to L1, they can deploy their Ethereum L1 smart contract wallet and pay for the creation costs at that time.\n\nDelaying the wallet creation costs invites a new segment of users who can now experience lightning-quick and cheap transactions right from their pocket, with no admittance fee.\n\nWe believe this feature will help onboard many more users to Loopring L2, and with the combination of having other multi-layer deployment options, we have removed many barriers for a broader audience to discover the many security benefits of social recovery wallets.\n\n## 4. Multi-Layer Smart Wallet\n\nLoopring Smart Wallet is now deployed on Arbitrum, an Optimistic Rollup on Ethereum, with a new user interface coming to the mobile app shortly.\n\nThis will allow users to begin deploying their own Loopring wallets with social recovery at near-zero cost, making the security of Social Recovery wallets accessible to all.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*a6HIdwAWRSJKwFOzFlCkyw.png)\n\nArbitrum deployment is the first step in our Smart Wallet becoming multi-chain. We look forward to integrating these networks into our stack for the best possible experience to serve the needs of our users. We will start rolling out further Smart Wallet deployments in the coming year.\n\n## 5. Loopring Block Explorer\n\nThe Loopring [Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/subgraph/protofire/loopring-exchange-v2) is now almost complete which means our much anticipated, fully-featured block explorer is on the way. Loopring users will soon be able to sort through layer-2 blocks, account balances, exchange, and NFT related transactions with ease.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*jJZ0QQv-51xRFo6XgIv0TQ.png)\n\nLoopring Block Explorer\n\n## 6. Liquidity Mining\n\nThroughout Q3 we have run 4 rounds of liquidity incentive campaigns that covered AMM & orderbook liquidity mining as well as swap and trading tournaments. Our exchange distributed more than 135,000 LRC as campaign rewards, with partners/sponsors also supplying their tokens as incentives.\n\nWe have changed our Liquidity mining campaign from two-week to month-long cycles with the addition of weekly payouts. This longer duration format will benefit liquidity providers and traders who wish to plug in their capital for an extended period. [Here](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-l2-liquidity-mining-round-14-1e28fdb3f6a9) is round 14 as an example of how they work.\n\nWith the launch of our merged liquidity feature, which routes orders to both orderbooks and corresponding AMM pools for the best trading price, our L2 trading tournament now calculates volume as the sum of AMM and orderbook trading.\n\nFor token projects or issuers who would like to incentivize liquidity for their token on Loopring L2, we created[ this request form](https://loopringexchange.typeform.com/to/T0bgsodw).\n\n## 6. Protocol Fees\n\nCurrently, as we continue to bootstrap the liquidity and growth of the Loopring Exchange, incentives (protocol fees) are being distributed to help drive this liquidity growth.\n\nWe have finished the[ ](https://twitter.com/loopringorg/status/1390725652878348290)[fourth](https://twitter.com/loopringorg/status/1411351712879845377?s=20), [fifth](https://twitter.com/loopringorg/status/1422595846517018631?s=20), [sixth](https://twitter.com/loopringorg/status/1434998250386477065?s=20), and seventh distributions of protocol fees (all paid in LRC) for those who have provided LRC AMM liquidity on our L2. The total amount of LRC distributed in our second and third batches is roughly 200,000. Note that we excluded addresses owned by Loopring from the distribution.\n\nOur[ LRC tokenomics v2](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/lrc-tokenomics-v2-1e6fd99e9e9c) model rewards LRC holders who use their assets productively for the good of the platform as liquidity providers, insurers, and DAO members.\n\n## 7. Loopring Media & Milestones\n\n▸ \\*\\*Media + Blogs\\*\\*Throughout the quarter, Loopring has been featured in many media outlets and other major blogs as layer-2 continue to pick up steam as a critical Ethereum narrative. Below are select examples of media or educational pieces Loopring has been covered in.\n\n* [Loopring CTO Steve: “What is the real future of Layer-2 networks”](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-cto-steve-what-is-the-real-future-of-layer-2-networks-7257934212e4)(transcript of a live event presentation @ Shenzhen Blockchain Week)\n* [Starkware + Loopring present: dAMM (distributed AMM)](https://medium.com/starkware/damm-decentralized-amm-59b329fb4cc3)\n\n<!---->\n\n* [The Crypto Lark x Loopring interview](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoLark/status/1435790207333253123?s=20)\n\n▸ \\*\\*Milestones & Misc.\\*\\*Q3 came with impressive milestones, the most notable being surpassing [$2B traded on Loopring v3.6 exchange](https://twitter.com/loopringorg/status/1430864388420947973?s=20). We also hit another big milestone as we passed [2.5M transactions processed on Loopring L2](https://twitter.com/loopringorg/status/1426878640109801474?s=20).\n\nA new L2 info site was also created in Q3, which really showcases the cost advantage Loopring L2 has as an application-specific zkRollup. You can read more about this [here](https://twitter.com/loopringorg/status/1435211366898487299?s=20) or visit the site to [see direct comparisons here](https://l2fees.info/).\n\nLoopring (LRC) was also [listed on Kraken](https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1420776209915523074?s=20) and [on Abra](https://twitter.com/AbraGlobal/status/1421149594549985291?s=20) in Q3.\n\n## Path Forward\n\n## 1. NFT Marketplace\n\nAs mentioned above, we are working with an established partner who is building atop our newly released L2 NFT functionality. We are very excited to share more on this as soon as we can. This new marketplace is set to launch sometime prior to the end of 2021(Q4).\n\n## 2. zkEVM\n\nIn Q3, we began working with the Ethereum Foundation on a zkEVM solution.\n\nIt is still in the early stages, but we strongly believe the future of Ethereum layer-2 scaling belongs on a generalizable EVM-compatible or EVM equivalent zkRollup. You can read more about the zkEVM and how it compares to other layer-2 solutions[ here](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-cto-steve-what-is-the-real-future-of-layer-2-networks-7257934212e4).\n\nWe will continue to update the community on this as it progresses through Q4 and into 2022.\n\n## 3. dAMM: Distributed AMMs (in collaboration w/ Starkware)\n\nIn Q3 we announced a brand new mechanism called “dAMM”, a Distributed AMM model, that we are working on with Starkware.\n\nThe dAMM model will help solve the liquidity fragmentation problem across multiple L2s by creating shared liquidity pools on Ethereum L1 that can be used to asynchronously share liquidity — exposing LPs to more trades.\n\nYou can read more on this project [here](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/damm-distributed-amm-98dcfa2b26dd). We will share more updates on this as it progresses.\n\n## 4. More Multi-Layer Wallets + Further Mobile Upgrades:\n\nAs mentioned in the Q3 Summary, the addition of the Arbitrum layer inside the Loopring Smart Wallet is only the beginning of the new mobile experience.\n\nNext deployments are likely to include Optimism and Binance Smart Chain, but we are also researching many other options to bring the Loopring Smart Wallet with social recovery to many more users.\n\n## 5. Further Exchange Improvements\n\nWith the release of the public beta version of the new web app, we are now focused on user feedback to tweak and improve this experience.\n\nOn top of this, we also have a few more improvements and features to be added to the web app including a new Orderbook experience and more.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*0iA3IRyS-eHMx3H4kKMCXQ.png)\n\nNew web app orderbook preview\n\n## Questions & Feedback\n\nIf you’d like to talk to us for partnership, have questions, and/or feedback, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nHJEy4yn), or drop us a line at foundation@loopring.org. We also have an active [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/) community.", "timestamp": 1633491707, "digest": "mXmGku-1qSIStzgoDUiQMHIBQ_Dof8PWEAY-UIYTtIE", "contributor": "0x3720e5753Ade20c9BcB215A92F7E4855135F165D"}

{"id": "RGa5roSMpyHnqYVkazz60coo4Ni1F_0TLndhcu21HWY", "title": "Forbes: 2013: Year Of The Bitcoin", "body": "It has been a wild year for bitcoin and although the currency has been around for the last five years, 2013 is when most investors started to pay attention to the crypto-currency; the enthusiasm for bitcoins even propelled prices to briefly trade higher than gold.\n\nAccording to bitcoin specialists, the electronic currency is still in its infancy and faces a lot of questions; however, some investors are not afraid to start testing the waters.\n\n“You can definitely say that 2013 has been the year of the bitcoin,” said Guillaume Babin-Tremblay, executive director of the Bitcoin Embassy in Montreal, Quebec.\n\nBitcoin made headlines on Nov. 29 as the price of a single coin hit an all-time high. Mt. Gox one of the original and biggest bitcoin exchanges, based in Tokyo, recorded the high at $1,242 per coin. For comparison, during the same day, spot gold prices hit a session low of $1,240 per ounce.\n\nBabin-Tremblay said that at the start of the year a single bitcoin could have been purchased for around $12, a gain of 10,250% from the year’s high. However, since hitting their all-time high, prices dramatically dropped, and on Dec. 10 prices were hovering around $961 per bitcoin, a drop of 28% in less than two weeks.\n\nAlthough bitcoin has attracted a lot of attention in the last few months, Babin-Tremblay pointed out that the currency actually started to gain popularity earlier this year as a result of the Cyprus banking crisis. In March the government of Cyprus announced a bail-in for banks, meaning that the financial institutions would have to impose losses on their shareholders, debt holders and even large depositors.\n\nAfter the bail-in was announced people ended up rushing to their bank accounts to withdraw funds and a lot ended up putting the money into bitcoin, where governments could not touch it.\n\n“Bitcoins were growing slowly until Cyprus. Cyprus was the catalyst for the big increase in the price,” he said. “The price started trading at about $40 and then doubled within a couple of days,” he said.\n\nBecause of Cyprus, prices pushed towards $200 but dropped to about $60 after the banking crisis abated and surprise internet attacks on a few of the exchanges. Those attacks caused these exchanges to go offline for short periods.\n\nAfter a summer lull of relative stability, the crypto-currency started making headlines again as the latest investment vehicle. Babin-Tremblay said the coin’s latest parabolic rise started in early October as a result of Chinese demand. The demand in November was so high that some prices quoted on Chinese exchanges were almost double compared to exchanges outside the country, he said.\n\n“The rest of the world has been buying bitcoins to try and sell them to Chinese consumers because there is so much demand there,” he said.\n\n He added that the country’s growing middle class are attracted to crypto-currency because of the lack of other alternatives.\n\n“Essentially you have the perfect storm in China,” he said. “It’s very difficult for Chinese people to invest overseas. They have a real estate bubble, they have a stock market bubble and they have one of the highest saving rates in the world.”\n\n**China Throws Cold Water On Bitcoin Investments**\n\nChinese demand for bitcoins cooled significantly since hitting its November high after the Chinese government announced that it was cracking down on the currency. On Dec. 5 China’s central bank barred banks from handling bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe ban doesn’t stop consumers from using electronic currency in internet transactions, the People’s Bank of China said, but added that it is not a currency with “real meaning” and doesn’t have the same legal status as the yuan.\n\nGordon Chang, contributor to Forbes and author of the Coming Collapse of China, said that he is not surprised that the Chinese government is starting to crack down the electronic coins. The government previously supported the coins, but probably underestimated their popularity, he said.\n\nChang added that not only have consumers been using the currency to speculate against the yuan, but they have used it to move their capital offshore.\n\n“This is just speculation, but I think \\[the Chinese government is\\] alarmed at how fast the market has grown and now they are trying to rein it in,” he said. “They are obsessed with control so it will only be a matter of time before they find a way to rein in the bitcoin.”\n\nChang also cautioned that he is expecting the price to continue to drop as it has entered bubble territory. However, recovery isn’t out of the question. Because of its popularity, Chang said he sees the potential for a strong market but not with the same growth that was seen in the last few months.\n\n“There is a lot of money sloshing around China looking for a place to go,” he said.\n\nOle Hansen, head of commodity strategies at Saxo Bank, said the market’s volatility is probably what keeps average consumers from investing in bitcoins, which is why he doesn’t see it as a viable investment tool.\n\nHe added he would not feel comfortable investing in a security that rallies 20% one day and then drops 30% the next.\n\n“It has caught the imagination of investors, but I don’t think it can last,” he said. “If you think the financial market is going to completely collapse, you probably want something more tangible like gold.”\n\nBabin-Tremblay agreed that bitcoin markets are not for the faint of heart as prices are extremely volatile. Prices can easily fluctuate 2% to 5% within minutes for no apparent reasons. But it still is an attractive investment because it is a store of wealth, in a completely free market. Comparing it with gold, Babin-Tremblay said another major advantage bitcoin has over the yellow metal is that bitcoins are much easier to store and transfer around the world.\n\nMathieu D’Anjou, the senior economist at Desjardins, said he thinks the gold market could be suffering from bitcoin’s popularity. He added that both investment vehicles have a lot in common, but gold’s decline in 2013 has left some investors indifferent, who then saw an opportunity with bitcoin.\n\n**Room For Improvement**\n\nDespite the volatility, Babin-Tremblay said bitcoins are just the start of the crypto-currency market, which will continue to grow because they fit an important niche in the global financial system.\n\n“There are still a lot of people who can’t access the global financial system but they can access bitcoins,” he said. “There is room for improvement but the bitcoin is still in its infancy.”\n\nChina isn’t the only country that has been trying to capture the bitcoin craze. Recently, the Channel Island of Alderney, a British crown dependency, said it is planning to become an international centre for bitcoins and wants to issue paper currency backed by bitcoin.\n\nAccording to media reports, The British Royal Mint was in talks with Alderney to create a GBP500 gold bitcoin; however, this has not gone beyond discussions.\n\nThe Montreal Bitcoin Embassy, like the bitcoin itself, is relatively new and its mission is to educate people about the crypto-currency market, working with businesses and consumers. Babin-Tremblay said that education about the market is extremely important if it is going to achieve sustainable growth.\n\n“I think self-regulation is the next step for bitcoins, to make it mainstream,” he said. “Investors would feel more comfortable investing in bitcoins if there were some rules.”\n\nBabin-Tremblay said while 2013 was an important year for bitcoin, it is just beginning. He added there are plans to eventually expand the market and create derivatives and even futures contracts.\n\n“Even if there is no financial meltdown, bitcoins can grow on (their) own merits,” he said. “It is going to be a universal currency.”\n\n Tremblay also said that he is expecting to see other crypto-currencies be introduced to the market, melding currencies and science together. One type that has potential he said is prime currency.\n\nBitcoins are created, or mined, by completing extremely complex math equations that validate the coin’s code. Depending on the machine, it could take months to mine just one coin.\n\nInstead of completing designated equations, prime coins would be created by searching for complex prime numbers, which are used to develop encryption technology, Babin-Tremblay said.\n\n“This is a very serious industry and I think it is going to continue to grow. Its potential is limitless,” he said.\n\nCurrently, there are more than 12 million bitcoins in circulation and the rate of new bitcoins will be halved every four years until there is a maximum of 21 million coins.", "timestamp": 1633492577, "digest": "waPs8-DamVBRPfkgzw-Vmjs9IuS4UulSl2UtQ53jn6o", "contributor": "0x85eddAa293F3dA08059A9034466F998E854B2540"}

{"id": "DUNE04Xo4mQJlZZRT4DFA0FrkatXACljBYwqnbdDcd8", "title": "Is Artificial Intelligence a Threat?", "body": "Like every new innovation and technology, there are many misconceptions and well intent fear around it. The question is artificial intelligence a threat to the human race has been asked by thousands of people both professionals and amateurs alike. The answer is not quite clear but I will try to break it down to the best of my abilities.\n\nFirstly, we will discuss common threats when it comes to technology; the greatest being humans. The fact that nothing created by humans can be considered perfect because there will always be a way to better implement that tool thereby raising a version ++. The internet as we know of today is a great innovation and technology which can be considered one of the greatest threats to human civilization today wouldn't be seen by the average human as a threat but when put in the wrong hands can lead to the death of millions. There is numerous example of this threat and even government classifies the threat of the internet as far as nation-state threat.\n\nThere is also the question of Artificial intelligence taking our job, while this is true, there are millions of other jobs this new technology will create for humans. Aside from the jobs, it will make human civilization a lot better. Let's take for example the creation of a speedy vaccination when it comes to COVID-19.

The question is artificial intelligence a threat to the human race has been asked by thousands of people both professionals and amateurs alike. The answer is not quite clear but I will try to break it down to the best of my abilities.\n\nFirstly, we will discuss common threats when it comes to technology; the greatest being humans. The fact that nothing created by humans can be considered perfect because there will always be a way to better implement that tool thereby raising a version ++. The internet as we know of today is a great innovation and technology which can be considered one of the greatest threats to human civilization today wouldn't be seen by the average human as a threat but when put in the wrong hands can lead to the death of millions. There is numerous example of this threat and even government classifies the threat of the internet as far as nation-state threat.\n\nThere is also the question of Artificial intelligence taking our job, while this is true, there are millions of other jobs this new technology will create for humans. Aside from the jobs, it will make human civilization a lot better. Let's take for example the creation of a speedy vaccination when it comes to COVID-19. Millions of people would have died if this event happened pre the invention of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nYes, I will not fail to address the possible threat that is possessed by artificial intelligence, like every technology when put in the wrong hands can cause a deadly effect to thousands.

The number of cars in the street is few, perhaps most of these drivers are people who lost their jobs, and it makes no difference to them if they kept driving till sunrise. The pandemic obligated us to take around two months of “holiday”. Today is the second day of that holiday. To be truthful, the news made me kinda… happy. But, I had to demonstrate how sad this thing is. I don’t want people to get sick or anything like that. It’s just I' haven’t been in a proper holiday since ages. I want to do a lot of things, and sleep well, and eat well, and take good care of myself. People aren’t supposed to be working like robots, pretend to have a good day when they’re not, sit for hours and break their backs, just for some amount of money at the end of the month.

As you were able to go down the rabbit holes, you found an infinite amount of new idea’s and projects that are building interesting and meaningful protocols. Everyday in the crypto ecosystem seems like a learning experience, with so many captivating projects moving at such quick speeds. \n\nBuilding this knowledge eventually leads to a clicking point, in which you realize the full potential and hype for blockchains and the communities built on top of them. The crypto epiphany is exciting, and motivates you to stay in the space and learn more. You are full of enthusiasm, eager to start using these decentralized projects you’ve read about. \n\nHowever, you reach a point where you realize that you are not special, and many others have come before you, coming to the same realizations you have. From here, you usually come back down to earth, and start to see some of the problems facing crypto today. High gas prices, understanding specific details that prohibit your world conquering plans, and money, all slow you down and delay your plans to get rich or develop the next almighty DAO. \n\nSome will be able to focus on niche ideas and projects that captivate them. They will be able to learn smart contract programming languages, develop products, and remain persistent in their pursuit. However, as a teenager with limited time due to school, sports, friends, etc, this is not the easiest of paths.\n\nFor most, crypto will morph into a cool side hustle where you try to earn some spectacular returns, dabble with various products, and remain informed on the ever-changing landscape. Of coarse, all your friends and peers that know you use crypto will ask you a million questions, try to tell you you’re stupid, or praise you for your specific knowledge. \n\nUltimately you will feel like you’re not making progress, knowing you are no different from the noob who sits next to you in math class, both not capitalizing on the potential for crypto. You must remember, the knowledge you possess and are gaining will be of great use one day, as you will be able to make informed decisions and investments, unlike the kid down the hall who bought some Cardano.

{"id": "iRV7J99AQise7jd8CyNeCdif5Ja28Jdo4MIiVqXrFy0", "title": "Getting rid of the impersonator", "body": "## I hate writing but I don’t have money to afford a content writer, so here I am.\n\nA kind soul on Mirror’s Discord channel responded to my exhausted rant through a direct message about how no one is a failure as long as they are alive. That was beautiful but I’m still disillusioned with myself, hence this post. I promise to write about other things going forward, but today I’m going to treat this post as therapy as I don’t have enough money to afford a therapist I think I badly need.\n\n### Living life between the fear of being seen for who I am vs. never being seen for who I really am\n\nI never had a conventional and steady career. Took whatever opportunity that came in that could pay me some money and eventually ended up disliking the role or discontented with the pay and so on. In my recent longest stint at a big organisation, I left on bad terms. I also didn’t have a great relationship with one of my bosses here and that impacted me negatively, mentally, financially (didn’t really get too many salary raises, which frustrated me) and overall, professionally. The previous boss was great because he was intelligent and fair but also a terrible communicator. I worked very closely with lots of teams and people managing global projects and eventually realized I’m fed up of this shit. I was tired of building consent, aligning stakeholders, and keeping the ship afloat each day. As a project manager you realize soon enough that the success of projects is always attributed to the team and failure always rests on the captain’s shoulders. Through this period, I also realized I used to be crippled with fear before meetings where I had to organise my thoughts and lead discussions. I would invariably end up offending people and I used to blame it on my inability to read between the lines, gauge people’s motivations, soften the rough edges of snappy conversations. Sometimes, I blamed it on the natural tone of my voice and I just didn’t know how to modulate that to sound more friendly and assertive but not patronising.\n\nI knew I wanted to do something with numbers like financial analysis, research or manage money in some way but I wasn’t sure what exactly that was. I enrolled in the CFA program and started to engage with the community that helped me understand the various options and career trajectory within this industry.\n\nI dabbled with Private Equity and  finally settled into Venture Capital in the last couple years while also angel investing on the side. I loved meeting all the freshly minted founders, their enthusiasm towards the work they did and told myself ‘I would love to build something myself but I’m too old for this now’. I convinced myself that I will be part of a future revolution by investing in good founders I believe in and that’s my contribution towards humanity’s progression. I thought technological innovation and efficient capital allocation was my calling. While raising capital for the first VC fund, I realized how hard LP money was to come by. While I see this crazy influx of money into VC all around me with people talking about how they raised millions in their first fund, we were struggling to raise a fraction of that amount. We spoke/reached out to friends, angels, fund of funds, not-for-profits etc but only saw closed doors. Eventually, we deployed whatever was pooled by the business partners into some companies and wrapped it up. My business partners had other interests they decided to pursue and I thought I did as well.\n\nI began my quest to singlehandedly launch a fund that will invest in the highly underserved communities of emerging markets where there are many barriers to entry, poor infrastructure but some very engaged and enthusiastic potential-entrepreneurs. I designed a model to provide seed capital and set up a framework to offer support via another local group for marketing, tax, legal etc so that founders can focus on product. It took a lot of chasing via calls, emails for people to respond to information requests or meetings with founders with some of the people I was working with. I didn’t find the model to be viable anymore when relationships are getting built through scratch during COVID times and there was no sign of being able to meet or see the people I was going to work with. I was also met with skepticism when I spoke to other funds and not-for-profits about funding options for this unique fund. Given my very brief stint in VC, I shouldn’t be and wasn’t surprised at this reaction. I was told by many people that it’s a great idea but execution is key.\n\nWhile the discussions for this fund were ongoing, I continued to apply to a program that was accepting applications for an accelerator to start your own VC fund leaning towards social impact. I thought it would be helpful to get some structured guidance to improve my VC operational skills and help me think through a good fundraising strategy. I applied twice and got rejected both the times (I was a finalist the second time).\n\nSoon after, I was speaking to another VC fund that would be investing in women entrepreneurs only. The initial discussions were positive and I was told in the third meeting they need someone that has considerable fund raising experience, so I was then out of the race.\n\nIn between all of this, I find out that I have failed the Level 2 of CFA program for the second time. I had studied for this exam a total of 4 times - the 2nd and 3rd attempts were cancelled one month prior to the exam due to COVID. Any CFA program participant will tell you that preparations go on for months in advance for these exams. I used to find it very hard to grasp and retain all the concepts, so I had started to prepare 3-5 months in advance for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th attempts and around 6 months in advance for the 1st attempt. The day the results were out, I decided never to attempt the CFA again as it literally put my life on hold so many times that I can’t afford the money, time and energy anymore. Also, since I wanted to continue with private investing as my career path, I didn’t see the need for these credentials anymore. I joked with my friend that it feels liberating to decide not to pursue this designation anymore in a way that you leave behind your toxic spouse forever.\n\nIn between all above, I tried reaching out to many individuals (friends, spouse, LinkedIn network, a few strangers and even a very expensive career counsellor) to help me identify what career option is well suited for me. A lot of people were encouraging and generous with their time and advice. I acted on some of the advice I thought might help me and landed a few interviews here and there. Here is where a beast would show up. I would be crippled with self doubt and anxiety thinking if this person will actually see me for the failure I’ve been in the past, for the difficult professional and personal relationships I have had, for the conflicts I created and those that I fled. I can hardly even remember coming out of interviews thinking ‘wow, that was good conversation’. I was never relaxed before or during the interviews. After every single one of them, I felt a huge sigh of relief that it was over. I didn’t get selected for any of these jobs except one which was a few corporate levels below my experience. I didn’t hear back from them until a week prior to joining date where they said they have decided to scrap the role altogether.\n\nExhausted and tired of rejection, I decided to take a break but the financial commitments and the feeling of not wanting to quit keeps me going. I was always curious about Blockchain and Crypto with all the buzz since pandemic hit. I decided to read up on this topic and see if there is something here that I might find as my calling. I like how powerful the technology is, its underlying values of privacy, transparency and all the good stuff I’m not going to re-iterate because we all know it. I’m particularly curious and hopeful (based on my limited understanding of this technology at this point) that one day it will effectively change education and healthcare outcomes for the very poor sections of our societies. So anyway, back to my oscillation between rejection and hope - I feel fearful and happy about my life at different times and I’m trying to find out which of these parts of me can be more constant and who is the impersonator. I’ve now thought of trying my hand at learning more about the Blockchain technology, some of the projects and find what might interest or move me. I found a few interesting companies and people and reached out to them to help manage their communities. I do one for free now but continue to look for some gig that can pay my bills. I’m also applying to other roles that are non tech but like I mentioned earlier, I have bombed two interviews so far that should have been easy scores. So, I’m just wondering what is so wrong with me that I cant exude confidence, enthusiasm or whatever it is that people look for in these interviews.\n\nI’m going back again and again to this idea that I wish I can do something of my own where I don’t have to worry about someone choosing to select or reject me for a role. I can feel failure in my breath each time I send an application out and keep refreshing my email account all day to see if anyone has responded with an interview call. I’m going to keep applying and interviewing while I continue to take some more courses in Blockchain, Crypto, DeFi etc. I’m also considering teaching myself some blockchain coding. My hope is for people to see me for my work that can be judged more objectively (such as code) rather than subjectively.\n\nThanks for reading - if you have made it this far. I needed to put this out as part of processing a few things. It felt good. I will hopefully write more productive content once I decide what I’m going to do with my life professionally. This may continue to change over time, I don’t know yet.", "timestamp": 1633503280, "digest": "UOH_WY2CSlBZ5EC9NC7bM81aRp4Xpn7_FFYpBtFyOU0", "contributor": "0x06aC06eCF55D3525f740216f00935A4a7F13dee1"}

{"id": "Jl-aKQ_0WJXGH9GJuqRLMy2tH1X_SFZrjlVEZmz7P-I", "title": "Loot会起死回生吗？", "body": "作为Loot的忠实拥护者，我的Opensea账户里还静静躺着一个Loot。 而就在不到一个月的时间里，我经历了Loot从默默无闻到众人追捧，再到门庭冷落的循环。\n\n我不得不感慨，NFT的冷热交替已经是太快了，快得让圈内人都摸不着头脑，其中就包括Dragonfly的冯波。他的某一个账户上还有13个loot，其中Bag #3043被冯老板在一个月前以199.99ETH收入囊中，而它现在的最高报价为4.125ETH。\n\n有数据显示，Loot在Opensea上的地板价在9月3号达到18.88ETH，但随后就开始暴跌，9月中旬地板价不到5ETH，此后价格虽然有所回升（截至目前是6ETH），但依旧属于低迷状态。\n\n如此暴跌的背后肯定是诸多原因共同作用。对此，我做了一个大致的分析。\n\n暴跌原因一：头像类NFT的「崩盘」\n\nKOL江卓尔在9月初曾预言头像类NFT会崩盘，核心理由是「崩盘微观上由供和需决定。NFT的需（入场资金）是有限的，而供（头像艺术作品）是无限的。」\n\n江卓尔逻辑也很清晰。虽然我并不认同它的观点，但不可否认的是，就在江卓尔公开唱衰NFT之后没几天，NFT就崩盘了。不得不说，舆论（大V）的威力是巨大的，它直击共识本身。\n\n虽然头像类NFT与以Loot为代表的NFT存在较大差别，但是城门失火总会殃及池鱼，一个必然结果就是NFT总体入场资金的锐减，Loot难以独善其身。\n\n暴跌原因二：大环境的低迷\n\nBTC/ETH在8月终于从512的暴跌中得以回复，并在9月7号触及短期高点，但又迅速暴跌，从五万多一路跌倒四万左右。\n\n面对此种泥沙俱下的行情，无论是NFT，还是作为其中重要品类的Loot，都难以独善其身。\n\n按照Andrew Kang的说法，触发NFT热潮的背后重要原因是币圈人的炫耀（Flex）。说到底，还是过去这波牛市，有太多人依靠着Defi、NFT等赚了太多钱，他们需要用NFT来展示他们的财力。而大盘的下跌在击破牛市幻想的同时，也让许多人管住了自己乱花钱的手。\n\n暴跌原因三：团队在「做事」\n\n曾有人和我开玩笑，Loot最大的不稳定因素就是团队。对于NFT本身，稀缺性本身就是决定价格的核心因素之一，这一点毋庸置疑。\n\nLoot出来之后，因为仿照难度极低，瞬间就出现了大量的仿盘。不过仿盘不可怕，可怕的是官方认证乃至出品的仿盘。9月4日，Loot创始人Dom在推特宣布推出新项目More Loot（MLoot），规则和原版一样，编号从8001开始，发行数量惊人，每年发行25万个，上限约为131.6万枚。MLoot的出现，可以说是直接引发了Loot价格的崩盘。MLoot目前在OS上的地板价已经基本归零。\n\n大多数时候，我们不希望团队不做事，但我们更怕团队做错了方向。不过类似的事情在币圈实在是太多了，比如SNX的创始人发的那条盛气凌人的推特。\n\n暴跌原因四：生态不足\n\n最近这段时间，NFT的热度正在逐步恢复；不过大多数投资者的眼光还是停留在头像类NFT上，其中核心原因在于头像类NFT能够在视觉上给人带来最直观的冲击，而无法从类似Loot、The N Project的单词和数字上获得美感。\n\n另外，不得不说，目前这一波头像类NFT在画面质量上比上一代要高得多，典型代表就是The Project URS、Galaxy Egg。画面精致程度远超绝大多数同类产品。头像类NFT目前已经两级分化已经愈发明显，进入门槛也越来越高。NFT的供给也不再是无限了。\n\n自从Loot的诞生，围绕着Loot的周边生态项目层出不穷，既包括拆解NFT的Lootloose，也有生成图像的Loot Character，以及稍微高级一点的genesis project（这个项目值得关注）。\n\n但是，这些周边产品并没有特别亮眼的表现，其中既没有有意思的游戏，也没有非常优质的画面。Loot Character所呈现的画面质量并不那么令人满意。Dom的那个叫做Wagmigotchi的游戏也的确机制和意图都太简单了。\n\n另外作为Loot治理代币的AGLD在九月的表现也不佳，从7u直线跌落至2u，整个过程埋掉了不少资深二级投资者。\n\n以上就是我对Loot暴跌原因的分析。作为Loot持有者，写完这些颇为心痛。\n\n那么接下来就是第二部分，我们一起来讨论Loot的未来，看看这个曾经的明星项目是不是还有前途。\n\n总的来说，我对Loot的后市有较大的信心。这并不安全是屁股决定脑袋，毕竟Loot的流动性并没有彻底恶化。\n\n看好原因一：NFT热度回归\n\n经过9月的沉寂，现在NFT的热度正在以肉眼可见的速度恢复。Opensea的数据显示，过去7天，不少头部品类的交易量暴涨，以CrypToadz、CyberKongz为代表的项目交易数量都是数倍的增长，以Neo Tokyo Identities为代表的新项目的地板价更是直接超过10ETH。\n\n不过目前热度主要在新项目和半新不旧的项目，还没有影响到包括Loot在内的此前被爆炒的NFT。不过正如CryptoPunks，Loot作为新一代NFT的代表，被不少媒体和KOL吹捧为「改变NFT范式」的资产，其热度会在某个时间点回归，并不会彻底沉寂。\n\n看好原因二：大环境向好\n\n在过去一周，BTC从4万又一路涨回5万，不少人已经表达了他们对于后市的看好。而且目前市场上除了Layer2，也就NFT和Metaverse这么一个大热点，自然会有大额资金流入NFT市场。\n\n看好原因三：团队在做事\n\nDom给人的感觉很像AC，不断地尝试新的东西，其中肯定有错误，比如说MLoot，但也又可能出现第二个类似Loot的产品。\n\nWagmigotchi虽然不算成功，但是指明了某种方向。AC不就在Dom的启发下鼓弄出了Rarity。我个人还是比较看好Dom即将推出的新项目a.quest，希望能我们惊喜。\n\n另外Genesis Mana也蛮值得期待，游戏玩法在不断升级。\n\n对于类似Dom这样具有极大创新力的人物/团队而言，只要他不断地推出项目，总会有若干个被市场所认可，这就是「流量」+「创意」的双重优势，从而将Loot，也就是Dom所有产品的核心，再一次推上热点。\n\n看好原因四：生态\n\n由于Loot在过去一段时间内不属于市场热点，围绕着Loot的生态发展也在九月中旬之后有种戛然而止的感觉。但最近两周时间，AGLD的表现着实不错，并被主流市场不断接受。\n\n9月21日，Coinbase Pro宣布上线AGLD；10月5日，币安又宣布在创新区上线AGLD。\n\n在不断的厉害刺激下，AGLD价格也在过去几天中突破了将近一个月的萎靡，接近了5u，距离ATH也不再是遥不可及。\n\n可以预见的是，在AGLD的吸引下，会有不少团队参与建设Loot的生态；我相信，Loot的持有者在鼓励生态发展这一方面并不会太吝啬。\n\n众人的参与，再加上团队本身在做的事情，Loot的生态或许会在不经意间爆发。\n\n总结\n\n写完之后才发现，Loot此前暴跌的原因和我看好其后市的原因恰好一一对应。总的来说，我不认为Loot有彻底崩盘的可能性；与此同时，机会又已经在孕育，不知何时就会爆发。\n\n所以从各个角度而言，我认为Loot后市可期。\n\n \\n ", "timestamp": 1633504788, "digest": "RRXtzoSr2LqDYgyHCsjSXrpS8lBpcOahn2eUQuarI0Y", "contributor": "0x04C89495405538CCF74ee8bD2A3A86F5Af03f563"}

In my opinion, BanklessDAO, which has only been established for about 5 months, is already an excellent example of community collaboration.\n\nWhat is BanklessDAO? Everyone asked me but I have not been able to give a concise and accurate answer. If there was enough time for the occasion, I usually spent a few minutes to tell my friends about those interesting things in BanklessDAO, otherwise I can only said, “Go check by yourself, it’s really good.” But when everyone really ran to the discord server of BanklessDAO, they would probably go crazy immediately after enter the server. There are more than 200 channels that look messy and weird.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XjnyaCQy0pUG1IuyTFx8l.png?height=3279&width=2265)\n\nIt’s a treasure trove, but it’s a bit messy.\n\nBanklessDAO is technically easy to define; it is both a community and an autonomous organization. But further down the line, what exactly is BanklessDAO? 100 members will probably have 101 answers. Someone says it’s a bunch of Discord channels plus a forum, someone says it’s a bunch of smart contracts. Someone says it‘s kind of like a company, made up of a bunch of guild and some people say there are many fun projects there.\n\nWhatever the answer, one thing is certain: BanklessDAO is buzzing.\n\nThere are too many stories in there and the introduction to BanklessDAO will be divided into three parts:\n\n1. Meet Bankless DAO\n2. Operation and cooperation in BanklessDAO\n3. BanklessDAO's economic system and governance\n\n**Meet Bankless DAO**\n\nBanklessDAO originated from Bankless, a crypto media founded in 2019. Initially, it was a newsletter tracking the crypto industry. In 2021,they began to operate as a company and became profitable, registered as Bankless LLC.\n\nBankless is one of the most influential media in the crypto community, with a strong subscription base. In May 2021, Bankless media launched the Bankless DAO.\n\nDespite being Bankless Media’s initiative, BanklessDAO is the result of community consensus. It has no traditional legal entity and operates completely independently of Bankless LLC. There is no overlap at all at the business or legal level.(But there are some overlaps on people)\n\nBanklessDAO has done a great job of gathering community members. Most people like their mission article like I did.\n\n(BanklessDAO’s mission, from https://Bankless.community)\n\n> ***We have entered an era of internet-scale organizations.***\n\n> *The coordinating power of Ethereum allows internet strangers with shared values and goals to organize under a common banner, and enables them to steer the world towards their future aspirations. Internet communities align with digital tokens and use them as tools to focus capital and labor into productive outputs in pursuit of a shared vision. Under community consensus, the private skills and resources of an individual can coalesce into public collective power and impart change upon the world.*\n\n> *With this, humanity has unlocked the capability of building new, internet-scaled institutions aligned with the values of its members.*\n\n> ***We need this now, more than ever.***\n\n> *The previous institutions of the world have hit their limits of growth. Nation States, corporations, banks, Silicon Valley monopolies are no longer inclined to include additional members under their tents. The value in these entities accrues to a small few, and thus are fundamentally misaligned with the many people they serve. As these institutions scale, they become increasingly incapable of producing the future that is aligned with the individuals that comprise them.*\n\n> *Bankless started in 2019 as a newsletter, added a podcast in 2020, and in 2021 is now a self-sustaining media company dedicated to democratizing access to information about the world of decentralized finance. The role of Bankless is to operate as a public good for education, media, and culture on crypto and all other bankless technologies that are being introduced into the world.*\n\n> *The growth of Bankless has outpaced our wildest expectations, and the demand to help grow the bankless message has grown into spinoffs like Bankless Russia and Bankless France. These alternative flavors of Bankless are crucial to growing the bankless message into the global movement it can be.*\n\n> *It’s clear there’s an energy behind bankless beyond the capability of a single media entity to harness.*\n\n> ***The bankless movement is ready to grow out of the hands of the few and into the hands of the many.***\n\n> *The bankless message is a global banner, and the Bankless DAO is the organization that coordinates people under this banner. Only an internet-native organization is capable of growing an internet-scaled revolution, and thus we need a Bankless DAO to grow the bankless revolution.*\n\n> *We want a money system by the people and for the people.*\n\n> *We want to propagate crypto media and culture.*\n\n> *We want to help the world go bankless.*\n\n> *Help grow the world’s first-ever media and culture DAO. Bring your talents, time, and ideas. Join the revolution.*\n\n> *Join the Bankless DAO!*\n\n**An open community**\n\nBanklessDAO is an open community. Anyone can join their Discord server and access to most messages and historical work documents.\n\nParticipation in guild collaborations usually requires membership, which one has to verify he is holding 35,000 BANK tokens. However, this is more voluntary. There is also a special channel for applying for a guest pass. If one introduces themselves and how they could contribute to the community, a Guest Pass will be issued and unlock almost everything they need.\n\nBanklessDAO’s Discord server has about 11,000 people, drawn together by a desire for a bankless society, an interest in collaboration on the Internet, a desire to make money to support their families, or simply a curiosity about the content of certain channels.\n\nWhen they got to know each other, they formed a lot of guilds in different directions based on their interests and abilities. A guild is like a department in a company, for example UIUX/DEV/Test/Legal, each department has its own employee with different strengths and responsibilities. But guilds are also like business divisions, each of which hopes to create some products or solution by itself, rather than just serving the DAO as a functional team.\n\nCurrently there are 13 guilds : Writer, Treasury, Translators, Research ,Operations, Marketing, Legal, Education, Design, BizDev, Developers, AudioVisual and Analytics.\n\n![Guild notion pages](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RGjJFIKaEmhynKeHVCIZ4.png?height=1027&width=696)\n\nJoining guild is permissionless, all you need to do is go to the notion page and fill in your name and expertise.\n\nThere are a lot of professionals in guilds, but it’s not just professionals who can join a guild. There are many guilds that cover a wide range of topics, and even in professional guilds, there is a lot of collaborative support done by non-professionals contributors.\n\n![Legal Guild members](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y9kD8HSe4gvdJvX9B0XKn.png?height=1761&width=1355)\n\nIn theory, the ultimate goal of all unions is to promote a bankless society. Guilds differ in methods and processes, but share the same goal. But the goal is sufficiently vague and large that it can be applied in almost any direction to justify its existence.\n\nDuring the discussions within the guild, a lot of project ideas emerged. Some projects got enough consensus and went from idea to action.\n\n![some of projects](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qY9s8XIUeIq_Bs73-s8-A.png?height=470&width=960)\n\nAll collaborate entirely through Internet tools. The discussion usually takes place in Discord channel or forum publicly. Normally, there is a 1-hour weekly call for guild or project. Any member is able to participate and almost all documents and meeting minutes are open to anyone.\n\n![Calander](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FflpnUv4Qfjx2E_9tjBKX.png?height=1160&width=772)\n\n![Meeting Notes](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5fk-deks6v0tTpKHqqkhz.png?height=989&width=894)\n\nIt’s as if you accidentally walked into a company and were surprised to find that everything was open. You can attend meetings of any department and check all the working documents. When you’ve been around for a long time and finally found something you’re interested in. You asked can i join you guys. Everyone said “Of course! Come on in!”\n\nIs there anyone who doesn’t like such a place?

Being overused by a service company, hoping that I would ultimately receive what they promise if I do this other 10k shell scripting mission. \\n There, I learned that people were livestock, assets for these companies. That the managers and commercials were the slave masters behind friendly masks, open bars and “team building”. \\n I refused to stay and accept the situation, no bending. The grass must be greener higher up. \\n  \\n Since my first open source position, joining prestigious W3C people and Adobe guys. There I would be safe and well, these were the Linux Beard-necks people I wished to work with for a decade since I first discovered Linux. \\n There, I realised that I was one of the few actually building, and that all the advisors and board member where there, lending a name for shilling, and/or as an additional effortless revenu stream. \\n I refused to work for other for so less under the excuse of “open source” that again was heavily subsidised by several States. I could do the same in a more profitable place. \\n  \\n Since my first experience in a “family office”, what?  \\n The name doesn’t sound friendly?  \\n Won’t even mention the 2 years lost there, professionally speaking. \\n I did invest in my body and mind out of boredom though. I learn to do Lapidary, Silversmithing, I trained Muay Thai 4/5 days a week, practiced meditation daily and studied greek philosophers. (Yes I had that much time. And without these alt skills I would not have made it out sound and sane). \\n There I learnt to bend the mind.  \\n  \\n Since my latest experience in a Blockchain company, a good one, but that is still a company, mostly focused on pleasing shareholder and receiving fat fundings. The funniest was that the funding was announced in town hall without any mention of what it would be used for? Nobody asked, and at that point I was too tired to always swim against the tide…\n\nReflecting about the why… why would I endure low pay, high pressure and responsibilities (working in C/C++/swift native iOS). \\n Why would I keep working for other people that were reaping the benefits without sharing much, and I don’t even ask in financial terms, I would have been happy with a warm head petting at that time. \\n  \\n Mostly cowardice. To disappoint others, to trust my guts, to risk loosing some comfort. \\n The same cowardice that made me sell my bitcoins 12$. \\n Also mindlessness, because who got time to think when your living pay-check to pay-check, drinking and using drugs to relieve stress and because it’s the social norm of where you come from. \\n  \\n `Along the way I met a nice anon crypto friend, with whom I still talk almost monthly, although sporadically communicating with each other, he is been kind of a lighthouse in all this life whirlwind. After half a decade I still haven’t seen his face nor know much about the physical him.`\n\n_____________________________ \\n  \\n **Breaking free**\n\nLast year I built the free app PointCloudKit, in an intense push, doing Metal GPU code, interfacing python/c/c++ and computer vision with iOS/Swift, on my free time. It was great learning, good tech, and totally unprofitable nor impactful (appart from the monthly LiDAR researchers, architects and students that contact me for feature request).\n\nI was hoping this would work! Why didn’t it work, why the reality wasn’t bending to my expectations? I was a good hardworking boi! \\n  \\n Made me upset. I decided to start… doing what’s needed. Accept reality as it is, stop hoping and start acting. \\n  \\n It’s like having to do the dishes, you can wish you don’t have to, but that’s just stupid. \\n Just do it. \\n Just do it.  \\n Thanks to the harshness of Muay Thai, this simple sentence I had heard for two decades now too all its splendeur. \\n  \\n Sometimes you just have to do it. If I want to work in a blockchain related job, stop hoping on these Linkedin agents. Just start doing.  \\n Start learning Rust, Solana (sure I’m motivated, but not enough to learn Javascript and Solidity. It’s already hard enough to write just the tests in JS, that even the fucking IDE/Compiler don’t understand).\n\nIf only I had acted instead of hoping. \n\nTook me a few more months. \\n  \\n And now it’s me creating my opportunities, building nice things for projects I value.\n\nJust because I acted instead of hoping, because I took the matter in my own hands. \n\n_____________________________\n\nAs I heard from Andre Compte-Sponville (poorly translated…)\n\n`There is no hope without fear, nor fear without hope. Many people live in hope and so in fear, but the wise prefer to do what depend on him, accept what IS rather than desire what he wish it was, and do what depend of him: building`\n\n`Hope less, and learn, love and act more.`\n\nReality is rational, everything is explainable. Thanks Epictetus for teaching me this. If the current situation doesn’t fit the grid you’r trying to make it fit through, drop the grid. Embrace the situation, how dire it is. Cause that the first step toward getting where you want. \\n  \\n I really hate this motivational bullshit and “entrepreneurial spirit”, but I feel like this sounds a bit like it. \\n It’s more about a retard that can barely write a sentence trying to share his experience in case it can help anyone. I don’t know anything, like everybody else. Anyone who seem to have shit figured out is either a fool or probably trying to scam you.\n\nOkay another last quote from our Stoic friend Seneca :\n\n`When you’ll have un-learnt to hope, you’ll learn to want.`\n\nAs with fire came disparities in the souls serie, with hope came fear in real life. \\n We are full of hope, and consequently of fears. \\n By learning to hope less, we free ourselves from the associated fears, and we start wanting and acting. \\n  \\n It’s all coming together. Or maybe I have sugar high, or retard bias. \\n  \\n `I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.

{"id": "Na53sNDus_LmV1qOgmHG_5rPOOSwUG_JanXrQLXDfBU", "title": "Crypto Trading for Beginners Ultimate Guide 2021", "body": "## Learn how you can start making real money online by taking advantage of crypto trading.\n\nThe fundamental information any new crypto trader should know about.\n\nThis article was originally published first at [cryptodroi.com](https://cryptodroi.com/crypto-trading-for-beginners-ultimate-guide/)\n\nThere’s no doubt you’ve probably heard about cryptocurrencies a couple of times over. So, at this point, you are probably thinking about how to make a buck or two with it…\n\n**What is this cost-effective way to make money called crypto trading?**\n\nCryptocurrency trading used to be taboo and, sadly, has been used as a way to scam people into putting their money into something they don’t understand. The common misconception about crypto trading is that it is overly complicated and that only a few “gifted” traders are the only ones who make a living.\n\n> ALTHOUGH IT REALLY IS COMPLICATED, THIS DOES NOT MEAN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND.\n\nGenerally, when people put their minds to something and follow a process, they will still get to their destination no matter how fast or slow it might take. Crypto trading has been romanticized as of late as some young millionaires make loads of money working “when they want to.” However, this isn’t really the case.\n\nWhen it comes to trading, knowledge should trump emotion. Many things could get in the way of your trading strategies, like excitement, fear, and general anxiety, and that’s ok, but know this…\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrency trading, the one making the decisions should have a winner’s mindset.\n\nYou need to understand that not everyone makes money in cryptocurrency trading. In fact, there have been thousands of people who sold their assets for capital to try crypto trading and lost big time.\n\n**But you should also understand this simple concept:**\n\n> WHEN SOMEONE LOSES, SOMEONE ELSE WINS. WHEN SOMEONE SELLS, SOMEONE BUYS.\n\nI know it may sound cheesy, but the point here is to set your positive mindset and use it to gain understanding to join the winner’s circle.\n\nWith a fine-tuned trading strategy and a good knowledge of cryptocurrency trading, you will be able to increase wins and minimize the effect of your losses.\n\n**And that’s what I’m trying to help you with, keep reading…**\n\n## What is Trading in General\n\nTrading basically involves buying and selling assets. It is a fundamental economic concept that relies deeply on the trader’s understanding of supply and demand.\n\nWhile trading is much easier to understand when done with tangible assets, intangible assets like cryptocurrency share the same concept.\n\nEverything in business is about supply and demand, just like in *crypto trading*. When demand for something is high, the price usually goes up, and when a demand for something is low, the price usually goes down.\n\nThe key is to know when the price should go up and when it is expected to go down. This is done by reading and understanding trends.\n\n> TRADING BASICALLY INVOLVES PLAYING ALONG THE LINES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND.\n\nLet’s say in 2020, there was a regular demand for smartphones. When the pandemic happened, everyone got stuck at home, and when this happened, people started buying new devices.\n\nThis then resulted in the stock prices of technology companies going up.\n\nThere are several different markets, and cryptocurrency is just one of them. These markets include bonds, stocks, and currency in general. Delving deeper into the trading world would unlock more complicated markets like Forex, margin products, futures, options, and a lot of others.\n\nFor the sake of this article, and to help you absorb more info fast, I will keep it simple with the most basic terms I believe beginner crypto traders should learn first…\n\n**While trading is generally buying and selling, there are two different trading approaches**: Short-Term trading and Long-Term trading.\n\nHere’s the first concept you’ll have to understand to learn about crypto trading.\n\n### Crypto Trading Short-term\n\nAs the name itself reveals, short-term trading deals in shorter time periods. Short-term traders usually enter and exit riding trends instead of looking towards the long-term growth of their assets. Like everything, there are pros and cons to short-term trading, and the trader really has to decide for themselves if they are capable of doing so.\n\n* **Short Term Trading Pros**\n\n**Quicker turnaround**. Since short-term traders are not thinking about their assets’ long-term value, they could generally buy low and sell high depending on their assets’ volatility.\n\nWhen we say volatility, this means how much the price of the asset fluctuates. The more an asset fluctuates, the more beneficial for short-term traders since they can buy low and sell high despite the stock’s general performance.\n\n* **Short Term Trading Cons**\n\nMore research is required to see when the price is meager and when the price is really high. Short-term trading can also be dangerous in cryptocurrency trading, especially for those with insufficient capital to sustain the loss itself.\n\nIt would be hard for those trading on the minimum to go into short-term trading, especially in extreme volatility.\n\nShort-term trading styles include different preferences like day trading, swing trading, scalping, and of course, [automated trading](https://cryptodroi.com/); the common denominator here is that your trading decisions will be based purely on Technical Analysis.\n\n### Crypto Trading Long-term\n\nLong-term trading is usually fit for the classic investor. Whether a cryptocurrency will go up or not, long-term trading usually puts a significant sum of money in the cryptocurrency with the trust and belief that it will go up one day.\n\nLast March 15, 2020, Bitcoin was around $5K, but on the 13th of March 2021, Bitcoin went up to over $60K. For those that were long-term traders, owning a single Bitcoin would make them extremely profitable.\n\n* **Long Term Trading Pros**\n\nLong-term traders aren’t affected by market volatility and generally won’t need to panic when it goes up or down in a week. Depending on how long they trade, long-term traders can reap a hefty profit, especially if the price does go up.\n\nOf course, it is also important to note that the price does not always go up 100% of the time, and depending on the timeline of the long-term trader, there is still risk involved.\n\n* **Long Term Trading Cons**\n\nThe disadvantage of long-term trading is that the investor has to put in a large amount of capital for the whole investment to be worth it.\n\nPutting a small capital might not be worth the time and could also be risky since their investment could be eaten up when the price goes lower than initially bought.\n\nA long-term trader is basically an investor, or in crypto, you may be hearing the term **HODLER** :); the most valuable piece of information an investor need is the asset’s fundamental analysis case would include research information about the chosen coin.\n\n## Crypto Trading Technical Analysis\n\nThe technical analysis revolves around the idea that historical data could predict how the stock would perform in the future. The interesting thing about technical analysis is that it does not look at the asset’s intrinsic value but rather how its price will perform.\n\nThis is very important when it comes to **crypto trading** since no tangible object or company is attached to the asset. While the term might seem extremely complicated, learning the different theories, charts, and other patterns one by one could be a potent tool in cryptocurrency trading.\n\nYour main focus here is to analyze how the market is moving, mostly based on the price and volume information you can read from the charts; that’s how you will identify a trading opportunity.\n\nUnlike an investor, as a crypto trader, you will be focused on the crypto asset price and assume it already reflects all the information accessible to the public.\n\n**Here are the 3 main assumptions of a Technical Analyst**:\n\n1. The market discounts everything.\n2. Price moves in trends.\n3. History tends to repeat itself.\n\nYou can learn more later if you want to, but don’t get “information-overloaded,” anyways, here’s a good article on [Technical Analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp) if you want to learn more.\n\n**Technical Analysis** is not perfect. It definitely can not tell you the future, but you don’t need to make money; all you need is a [strategy with a high probability of winning](https://cryptodroi.com/gunbot-v21-released-ultimate-strategy-setup-guide/#Gunbot_V21_Trading_Strategy_Configuration) and consistency.\n\nMore on that later. Let me show you 2 key components you should learn how to identify in a chart…\n\n### Crypto Trading Support and Resistance\n\nThis is a fundamental concept that deals with whether the asset is going up or going down. The support refers to the minimum price that the asset drops to in a certain time period.\n\nThe trading charts show patterns, and you can see the “support” when you look at how low the price generally goes for a period of time.\n\nOn the other hand, resistance refers to how high the price usually goes before it goes down again.\n\nBasically, identifying the patterns and when the patterns are changing is an example of technical analysis in play. When the asset goes above the resistance, it could either go up or down depending on the data.\n\nHere’s an example of the Support and Resistance levels calculated by Gunbot and applied to the trading chart.\n\n**Notice that in Gunbot, support and resistance are not fixed targets**.\n\nSupport and resistance are just an example of a technical analysis concept. This could also be considered one of the simplest concepts, and as a new crypto trader, you should slowly move up the ladder to the more complicated ones you learn.\n\n### Crypto Trading Market Trends\n\nThis is generally the way that an asset is going, whether up or down. In technical analysis, it is important to understand how the trend is going and where it leads.\n\n> THE TREND WILL GUIDE YOUR BUYING AND SELLING DECISIONS.\n\nSecondary trends give you insights into the market trend and leading, but the important thing to [understand is the dominant trends](https://cryptodroi.com/understanding-crypto-market-trends/).\n\n* **Bull Market**: This means that the asset price is going up.\n* **Bear Market**: This means that the asset price is going down.\n* **Sideways Market**: AKA Horizontal Trend. There isn’t a clear direction for the trend.\n\nThe best way for you to check the primary trend of a particular pair is by looking at higher time frames in a chart.\n\n**Example of BTC-USD up-trending based on a 1 Day Time Frame chart on Tradingview**.\n\nSo, regardless of what time frame you choose to trade BTC, you got confirmation that Bitcoin is trending up based on the above pic.\n\nNow you need to check on what market you will be trading…\n\n### Crypto Trading on the Spot Market\n\nA spot market basically means a market that makes exchanges on the spot. While most people might think of as common sense, it is important to specify what market is being traded since other markets are also in play.\n\nA future, for example, delivers the assets later on when the contract would expire. Since the trade is being made in real-time, the trades’ price is also valued in real-time.\n\n> WHEN WE’RE TALKING ABOUT THE SPOT PRICE, THIS MEANS THE REAL-TIME MARKET PRICE.\n\nThere are two main kinds of spot markets, the **Over-the-Counter** (OTC) and organized market exchange; these are usually centralized crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, [Beaxy](https://beaxy.com/), etc.\n\nFor the most part, especially if you live in the USA, you should only focus on the spot market; most crypto traders started their trading careers anyway.\n\nI’m not saying you could not learn about margin or futures, and certainly, you could make more money because you would be using leverage and be aware that you can get liquidated in a split second if you don’t know what you’re doing.\n\n\\*\\*Learn more about [Gunbot Margin and Futures Trading](https://cryptodroi.com/market-maker-strategies-only-available-with-gunbot/). \\*\\*\n\nThe only drawback of trading on the spot market is that you can only trade with your capital, but it is better this way, especially when learning.\n\nThe good news is, you can start with low capital and trade on most crypto exchanges.\n\nSo, let’s create a trading plan now…\n\n## Making a Crypto Trading Strategy.\n\nIf you fail to plan, you plan to fail. A trading strategy is basically a plan based on data regarding when to buy, when to sell, when to hold, and possibly for how long before deciding.\n\nThere are numerous trading strategies you can use, and they revolve around trading indicators.\n\nAn indicator represents data showing you what the data means in terms of a particular theory used.\n\nAn example of this is the **Moving Average**. This indicator basically follows where the general average moves either up or down despite the dips or spikes.\n\n> IN CRYPTO TRADING, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO LEARN ALL OF THE STRATEGIES OR THE INDICATORS, BUT RATHER WHICH STRATEGY WORKS BETTER FOR YOU.\n\nSo, whether you’re a day trader, doing swing trading, or scalping, you need a solid plan with an edge that will help you win most of the time, that plan is your strategy, and you will base your decisions on the data you see printed on a chart.\n\nSince we already talked about Support and Resistance, let me use that as an example strategy.\n\nThis is a simple example; you will enter the trade (**BUY**) at the support and exit (**SELL**) at the resistance level.\n\nIf you’re using a [crypto trading bot](https://cryptodroi.com/), all you have to do is define those values on your strategy, and the bot will execute those commands for you.\n\nThat is just an example of one out of many different strategies you could use; keep in mind “there’s not the best strategy” is what works better for you based on your trading preferences and risk tolerance.\n\nAnd obviously, a sound [money management approach is critical](https://cryptodroi.com/gunbot-money-management-crypto-trading-secrets/), so here we go…\n\n### Why is Risk Management Important for Crypto Trading?\n\nRisk management, from the name itself, is the process of managing risk. Risk management differs from trader to trader as different types of traders have different appetites for risk.\n\nWhile bearish prices don’t easily shake some traders, others are more easily swayed and sometimes tempted to sell at a loss.\n\nOf course, depending on whether or not the technical analysis or trading strategies were correct, there is also a time when a cut loss should be executed.\n\nSome people ride the risks, and when they lose, they lose everything; that’s why making a trading strategy on when to cut losses and when to sell is very important.\n\nThink of it this way, let’s say you bought an asset at a certain price and let it ride. It performed extremely well, and you didn’t sell despite the technical analysis pointing towards selling.\n\nAfter you decided not to sell, the price drastically dropped, plummeting into the ground, leaving you with a bag of coins and a meager price value.\n\n> THIS OFTEN HAPPENS IN CRYPTO TRADING, SO YOU GOT TO BE READY BEFORE YOU EVEN BUY.\n\nLearning when to take profits and cut your losses is very important because, in cryptocurrency trading, the prices are very volatile.\n\nStay away from **Pumps** and **Dumps**, and do not allow the **Fear Of Missing Out** to cloud your decisions because it will cost you.\n\n### Crypto Trading – Scalping\n\nYou can do scalping with the smallest timeframes as these short-term traders aim to gain small profits with every movement.\n\nAlthough the profits might not even amount to 1% at times, these trades’ repetitiveness still amounts to a significant profit.\n\nWhile it seems simple, scalping is never a beginner’s strategy and requires an intense understanding of how crypto trading works.\n\n> TECHNICAL ANALYSIS IS CRITICAL TO SCALPERS’ SUCCESS, AND THEY USUALLY FUNCTION WITHIN A VERY CALCULATED TIMEFRAME.\n\nThe easiest way for a new crypto trader to experience scalping is through [automated crypto trading](https://cryptodroi.com/crypto-trading-bots-ultimate-guide/); yes, I recommend **Gunbot** for scalping if you don’t have the skills yet.\n\n**A human is no match for a bot when it comes to repetitive tasks and timely execution**.\n\nBesides, you will be learning and using strategies developed specifically to get in and get out fast for a profit.\n\nBut let me explain to you a few more basic trading concepts…\n\n## The Cryptocurrency Trading Process\n\nWhen you place an order, and it doesn’t get filled, an “order book” is then used to store the orders organized by “price” until fulfilled.\n\nLet’s say you put an order at a certain price and there is no one wanting to buy at that price; the exchange’s trading engine will then place that order in the order book until it matches another order or gets canceled by you.\n\nA matching engine system is used to match the order book’s orders when it comes to crypto exchanges. The system is responsible for making sure that the trades are carried out.\n\n**Here are a few other crypto trading terms you need to understand**:\n\n#### Market Order\n\nThis is what the buying or selling process is called. Basically, putting a market order means putting an action to buy or to sell instantly.\n\n#### Limit Order\n\nAs the word suggests, limits refer to a limit or a price point that the order won’t go beyond.\n\nLimit buy orders will be executed when the price reaches the limit price or lower, and a limit sell order will be executed when the price reaches the limit price or higher.\n\n#### Stop-Loss Order\n\nThis is a decision about risk management. Putting a stop-loss means selling when the price reaches a certain level to avoid further losses.\n\nWhile the dreams of bullish prices are enough to entice most traders, the thought of handling losses might be something that you should avoid by all means.\n\n> A STOP-LOSS PUTS A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH YOU CAN LOSE IN ONE ORDER.\n\n#### Maker and taker: What’s the Difference?\n\nA trader will become a maker when they place an order that does not get fulfilled immediately and is instead added to the order book. Since the order contributes to the order book’s liquidity, the person putting the order will then be called a “maker” of liquidity.\n\nA trader will become a taker when they place an order that does get fulfilled immediately and takes off an existing order from the order book. Since the trader is taking out order book liquidity, the trader is considered a “taker.”\n\n#### Bid-Ask Spread\n\nThis refers to the difference between the highest bid or buy order and the lowest bid or sell order.\n\nBasically, a trader would want to trade within the spaces in between. Setting the boundaries depends on how high a buyer is willing to buy and how low a seller is willing to sell.\n\nOrders within this spread indicate the supply and demand of the cryptocurrency and attest to the market’s liquidity. In general, the smaller the market liquidity is, the more liquid the cryptocurrency is.\n\n## How to Make Money Crypto Trading\n\nMaking money through crypto trading in general means buying low and selling high.\n\n> THE GAP BETWEEN YOUR BUYING PRICE AND YOUR SELLING PRICE IS BASICALLY WHAT YOU’LL EARN.\n\nSince there are many players in the cryptocurrency trading space, their buying prices and prices could differ.\n\nWhat’s low for one might be high for others, which is essential to know when understanding market psychology.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency trading can be dangerous, it is also very profitable due to the massive differences in the highs and lows or, rather, great volatility.\n\nWhen traders become more familiar with cryptocurrency trading, they will assess when the price is most likely to go up and when the price will most likely go down.\n\nTrading is oftentimes mistaken for gambling.

It uses lots of energy, though, so mining companies are now looking for clean energy to produce the asset. \n\nPetro, a frontrunner for Colombia’s presidential election next year, added via Twitter that “virtual currency is pure information and therefore energy.”\n\nIt wasn’t clear what Petro meant but Latin America energy policy analyst Wesley Tomaselli told *Decrypt* that the senator was referring to the potential of Colombia’s Pacific coast to use renewable energy. \n\n“He's right in that Colombia has great potential for Bitcoin mining because about three-fourths of its electricity generation comes from hydroelectric power,” he said. “The problem is, Petro appears to be selling Bitcoin mining as an alternative model for development to coca growing and cocaine shipments. It's not. Unless Petro has a magic wand.”\n\nColombia is the world’s largest producer of cocaine, according to the United Nations, and its Pacific coast is where a lot of the coca—the drug’s base ingredient—is grown. \n\nThe Pacific coast is also a potential renewable energy hotspot. “Colombia's severe Andean mountain geography and river systems make it prime for hydroelectric power generation,” noted Tomaselli. \n\nBut he added that mega projects in the area “have grown less popular here because of resistance from environmentalists who see them as damaging to local communities and ecosystems.”\n\nEl Salvador’s government has said that it will use only renewable and clean energy to produce the currency, an idea that has been both praised by Bitcoin believers and slammed by Bukele’s critics. \n\nCould Colombia be next?\n\n![Twitter Tweet](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G3VvgP-EjpjSpMVdCV4Ad.png?height=886&width=663)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633507642, "digest": "6bSEzrTEcvPEm2NR3dJLBqy_44hqfxvmofrfAU1cUes", "contributor": "0xC8b07C774680A235a847C43ef76C0Cc18E61699a"}

If I want to work in a blockchain related job, stop hoping on these Linkedin agents. Just start doing.\n\nStart learning Rust, Solana (sure I’m motivated, but not enough to learn Javascript and Solidity. It’s already hard enough to write just the tests in JS, that even the fucking IDE/Compiler don’t understand).\n\nIf only I had acted instead of hoping.\n\nTook me a few more months.\n\nAnd now it’s me creating my opportunities, building nice things for projects I value, projects I am financially and emotionally invested in.\n\nJust because I acted instead of hoping, because I took the matter in my own hands.\n\n\n_____________________________\n\nAs I heard from Andre Compte-Sponville (poorly translated…)\n\n`There is no hope without fear, nor fear without hope. Many people live in hope and so in fear, but the wise prefer to do what depend on him, accept what IS rather than desire what he wish it was, and do what depend of him: building`\n\n`Hope less, and learn, love and act more.`\n\nReality is rational, everything is explainable. Thanks Epictetus for teaching me this. If the current situation doesn’t fit the grid you’r trying to make it fit through, drop the grid. Embrace the situation, how dire it is. Cause that the first step toward getting where you want.\n\nNot a big fan of these motivational “entrepreneurial spirit” bs, and now I start to feel like this sounds a bit like it?\n\nIt’s more about a retard that can barely write a sentence trying to share his experience in case it can help anyone. I don’t know anything, like everybody else. Anyone who seem to have shit figured out is either a fool or probably trying to scam you.\n\nOkay another last quote from our Stoic friend Seneca :\n\n`When you’ll have un-learnt to hope, you’ll learn to want.`\n\nAs with fire came disparities in the Souls, with hope came fear in “real life”.\n\nWe are full of hope, and consequently of fears.\n\nBy learning to hope less, we free ourselves from the associated fears, and we start wanting and acting.\n\nIt’s all coming together. Or maybe I have sugar high, or idiot bias…\n\n`I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.` \\n \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOjMBzcs1Ak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOjMBzcs1Ak)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633509178, "digest": "HSDTmB1p1DLhekDaGTcBrmeOjwkMVUav_kSYhNw4txI", "contributor": "0x9fEcc73Da3f8bd2aC436547a72f8Dd32326D90dc"}

Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the mist in the Gila forest***\n\nBatman-five looks at his military wristwatch to see the timer which he sets earlier just before he came down from the treehouse, and it’s showing 2 hours 11 minutes. It has been quite a while since Officer Davis starts trekking inside the misty forest of the First-Ring.\n\nThough he seemed to made a clumsy decision, but he has calculated the potential risks even before going down from the treehouse that the HQ approved to build and used for recon purposes. The wooden treehouse was named Outpost-One and it’s located on the outskirt of the First-Ring of the misty forest which is known to have the densest mist and the gloomiest human eye visibility compared to the Second or the Third-Ring.\n\nBelieve it or not, it was officer Davis's idea to set up the recon post besides being the only soldier who volunteers for this insane field duty; However, Officer Davis is not an ordinary soldier. Back before Z-Day—which most human survivors have named it these days; he was a decorated and committed Special Operation Forces (SOF) for the US Military Special Unit Division. He served in countless military covert operations overseas, ranging from the Middle East, North Africa, and some parts of Asia; but whatever he did before Z-Day is another story.\n\nRight after the deadly outbreak, Officer Davis is counted as an asset for the US military—or to be exact, what’s left of the US military corps; and well-respected for his bravery and loyalty in the line of fire to always defend his unit.\n\nFor two long hours—which he felt like a lifetime inside the First-Ring of the mist—Davis has been walking in real slow motions. He consciously controls his breathing by inhaling and exhaling from his nose and mouth to conserve energy in his muscles while consistently measure every step he took for that long tiring shadowy ninjalike walk.\n\nHiding under his ghillie suit, he sometimes chooses to walk or crawl from one place to another in a strictly discreet manner. At every certain distance, he lowers his body to rest on the ground while his camouflage suit blends him almost perfectly with the surrounding bushes. Ordinary watchful eyes could never detect or expect anything.\n\nHe couldn’t walk faster or run to the source of the gunshots that he heard because there is a well-known myth not long after this catastrophe began, which is: don’t ever run inside the First-Ring of the mist. Most stories told from human survivors were, whoever runs inside the First-Ring of the mist will not survive. Therefore, believing there can be human survivors left inside the First-Ring of the mist is just too good to be true.\n\n***16:00***\n\nAs Officer Davis keeps moving for nearly three hours, he starts to realize that his body is demanding water and sugar. Davis's mind and emotions have begun to wander wildly in the last ten minutes, but he tries to stay focus. Minutes later, he finally decided to stop and rest longer behind a large tree which makes him almost invisible by the naked eye.\n\nConnected to the earpiece he wears, Davis turns his CNR back on and a while later, he hears a radio call coming in, \"Batman-five, Batman-five, this is Batman-six, do you copy? Over.\"\n\nLike before, Officer Davis respond by whispering,\n\n\"Batman-six, this is Batman-five, I am half click from the source and conducting recon on the perimeter. Requesting radio silence, over.\"\n\n\"Damn you, Davis! This conversation is not over yet. Batman-six, out.\"\n\nHearing the response from Batman-six back in the HQ, Officer Davis smiles and turns off his radio.\n\nFor an ordinary person, or perhaps most soldiers, a battleground is a crazy place to hang out, but for Davis, is just another day on the stomping ground. Little does the HQ know that ever since Davis spend his days for these past few weeks in Outpost-One, the reality is, he rarely stays in the treehouse in the daytime. He always stays inside the treehouse after sunset but during the day, Davis is busy exploring and scouting the surrounding area. What Davis has done alone in these past few weeks at Outpost-One is considered insane by many survivors, but he probably did it because he was driven by his survival instinctive behavior and becomes territorial over his domain. Or, the survivors were right, he might just be an adrenaline junky and felt challenged to do it considering he is a well-trained military man.\n\nSome of Davis’s colleagues in HQ think he is overwhelmed, desperate, and hopeless about the global situation. They believe Davis has made a death wish after he was assigned voluntarily for the field duty on Outpost-One alone. But some colleagues from his unit see it differently. They think Davis is not a desperate and hopeless type of person, yet instead, he simply doesn't want to give up believing that after one-third of the earth's surface is covered by the mist and roamed by the undead, all of it is empty of survivors. They see Officer Davis as a man who believes that the only way to avoid fire is not to run away from it but rather, jump into it.\n\nDuring most of the day, Davis sets up \"invisible fences\" by planting boobytraps or other decoy materials to lure the undead away from entering the Outpost-One perimeter. Anyway, although he never journeys as far as he did today, nevertheless, only time can reveal Davis's true motive as to why he went through all this trouble in the first place?\n\nOfficer Davis use his short resting time to drink and took a bite of his military-grade food supplement. Several minutes later, suddenly, “...Bang! ... Bang! ... Bang! Ratatat! … Ratatat!”\n\nA new round of gunshots was heard and it was close to Davis's proximity. This time Davis did not overhear it once or twice but several times of loud gunshots then followed by a semi-automatic rifle. In an instant, Davis knew what type of semi-automatic rifle was fired; he knew it was not a military-grade weapon but a nonmilitary one.\n\nFor a second, Davis was caught in a moment of disbelieve but he is not an overreactive person, his mind works like lightning, calculating the possible risk, angle, and approximate distance of the gunshot's location, then he begins to move with caution.\n\nDavis knows that he is so close to the source of the gunshots sound and it can be someone or something or it might even be nothing at all because when he heard it the first time, he knew it can just be a gun belonging to dead survivors triggered accidentally by an undead, yet he feels so in need to follow his hunches today and kill his curiosity.\n\nDavis slowly crawls to the source. Part of him wishes that he can just run and arrive sooner to see what happen, but then he immediately remembers the myth of the First-Ring; and today, somehow, Davis doesn’t want to be the first one to prove if the myth is either true or false.\n\n## CHAPTER THREE\n\n### Ghostrider\n\n![AC-130J Ghostrider gunship (Illustration 03)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lyXOE5Z7E5CPIVUbWe4iy.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***The Gila Forest National Park, New Mexico***\n\nSince the late '80s, a secluded airfield located in a not well-known location inside the Gila Forest National Park was used by the US Forest Service to prevent forest fire. After 9/11, the airfield was secretly handed over to the US Military. Later, the airfield was converted to an airstrip and used as a secret military base for the US Special Forces. Ever since it was used by the US Forest Service, the locals never see the airfield because it was located deep inside the Gila National Forest.\n\nFor more than two decades, people from the surrounding towns knew that the airfield is regularly used once or twice a year as a training ground for forest firefighters and areal firefighter planes to prevent bushfires in Gila National forest. After it was taken by the US Special Forces, many planes that look like the US Forest Service are often seen near the vicinity. Besides the military servicemen that work on the airstrip, the common folks who live near the surrounding towns never know anything about it. The so-called US Forest Service airfield that they once knew since the '80s has become one of the most sophisticated secret military bases for the US Special Forces. At night, two AC-130J Ghostrider which are known as the deadliest gunship planes take off and land without ever being noticed. Most military servicemen or field agents who work inside the base live like regular people, and some do daily jobs in the nearby towns.\n\n***16:20. The year is 2025, New Mexico. Somewhere inside the Gila forest.***\n\nBatman-six walks to the Air Commando’s Office. He knocks on the door, and seconds later a male voice was heard from inside the room, \"Come in.\"\n\nOfficer Spencer enters and gives his military salute to the high-ranking officer inside the room and says, \"Colonel, Permission to report, Sir.”\n\n“State your report, Spencer,” says the Colonel after he glances at Spencer and continues drawing lines on a map. Before Officer Spencer entered the room, Colonel Monk was busy marking and drawing lines on a military map hanging on the wall that covers almost one side of his office wall.\n\nOfficer Spencer: “Sir, Officer Davis left Outpost-One and he is walking by himself inside the First-Ring of the misty forest. He reported earlier that he might overhear several gunshots and explosions at around noontime from Outpost-One. Now he is investigating the source for the last 2,5 hours and requested radio silence.\"\n\nColonel: \"(Sigh)…He never changes. So, where is he now and what is his status?\"\n\n\"Around 20 minutes ago, Officer Davis reported that he is already 500 meters away from the source. He insists to conduct recon in the surrounding vicinity. Colonel, it is almost sunset, he will never make it alone. Sir, requesting duty, Sir!\" replies Officer Spencer.\n\nColonel: \"Dispatch Blackbird-509 and Bravo-One Team to Outpost-One. Tell them to secure the perimeter and wait for my orders. I will be in Eagle-One. We leave in 20.\"\n\nOfficer Spencer: \"Right away, Sir!\"\n\n***16:40, Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the mist.***\n\nOfficer Davis has entered uncharted territory. He knows that he never wanders this far before, not at morning, noon, less close to sunset like this late evening. Thirty minutes is the maximum time frame before the night and the dark misty forest turn into Davis's worse nightmare. Well, except he can quickly find a secure hiding place like an Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), a hidden treehouse, or a sound escape plan, then even a spec op with skills as Davis will not likely make it. The chance is thin considering two out of the three options are not available. So, time is critical and Davis aware of his weak spot.\n\nTo be clear, the densest mist mainly appears after sunset and is known by survivors including Davis as the sanctuary of the undead, which is why the First-Ring of the mist is undoubtedly the monsters’ lair. Each day, the mist from the First-Ring which has sporadically cover forty percent of the earth's surface in the most world major continents has been continuously expanding. What matters is not only about the mist’s expansion but if a person is trapped inside the First-Ring of the mist for one night, then his effort to escape from the mist the next day becomes greater and farther. Therefore, whoever decided to remain indoors when the deadly outbreak event took place some eight months ago, which is also the first time for the mist to appear, then he is either safe and sound without needing to go out at all, or he is good as an undead.\n\nWith little time to spare, Davis maps the surrounding area with his mind as fast and accurately as he possibly could, and for whatever happens then, he needs to be certain not to lose his way back to Outpost-One. Davis is 400 meters away from the source of the gunshots, but the thick mist still makes it difficult for him to get a clear visual of the location. He needs to go further ahead.\n\n***16:55.***\n\nWhile lying face down on the ground, Davis moves his elbow and feet pushing his body forward one step at a time. This time he moves even slower. It took him almost fifteen minutes just to reached 100 meters from where he was before until he finally arrived at a nearby open field. Kill zones to be precise. Davis knew he has reached the safe limit; further movement can expose him to threat and uncertainty.\n\nIn the battleground, better safe than sorry is never an option. Knowing the risk Davis might face the undead, he has no plan to add hostile enemies to his adversary list. A spec op like Davis has figured out that a gunshot sound that happened inside the sanctuary of the undead is always a bad combination. He decides to stay hidden and use his spot to observe the approximate gunshot location using his MRAD sniper scope. Gently, he positions his sniper rifle while listening to every noise happening nearby. For Davis, sitting alone day in and day out inside a misty forest is not his first time, but sitting alone in the misty forest full of undead walking around after sunset, now that is his first time.\n\n![(Illustration 04)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Dy0N98IHCc4n4OocTcuRn.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nAfter adjusting his sniper’s position, Davis starts to see a small-looking red dot wobbling from afar. It also becomes apparent to him that the red dot is moving in his direction. He shakes his head twice to make sure his mind is not playing with his eyes but is neither his head nor his eyes. He sees something out there alright. Davis measures the distance of the red object which is around 200 meters away; but as the night invites the sun to sets at the edge of the horizon, the mist also thickens inside the misty forest. Davis still couldn’t confirm what he sees with his naked eye. He opens the sniper scope and begins to zoom in onto the small red dot. Once he saw it, Davis’s heart was shocked. He mumbles, \"It’s impossible!”\n\n## CHAPTER FOUR\n\n### The briefing room \n\n![Dubai, UAE (Illustration 05)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4o4i4rwijnz4llzHe-FRA.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***01:00, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 24 days before Christmas, 2024.***\n\nTwo AC-130J Ghostrider belonging to the US Special Forces landed safely on the US-UAE join operation military air force base near Dubai. They have just completed one of their two secret missions at an undisclosed area somewhere inside the Middle East. The two birds are refilling their ammunition and fuel while the crew has been given spare time to rest inside the military compound before doing their next and last assignment this year. \n\n![AC-130J Ghostrider (Illustration 06)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PgZz-pp0PXErf1FtCfHg_.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nOfficer Davis is drinking a cold beer inside the military cafeteria. He needs a break from his military duty; at least it’s what he felt in his heart. Although he has not returned home in the past six months, his face looks glad, because once he completed his last assignment, the miserable days of missing his family will soon be over.\n\nEver since Officer Davis was assigned to conduct several classified and covert military operations overseas six months ago; well actually, he was stationed by the US military high command in Washington to remain at a secret military base located inside The Gila Forest National Park, New Mexico. It is not far from the New Mexico state capital, Albuquerque, where his family are making their daily lives.\n\nEach month in the past six months, Davis spent seven days in Washington DC, where he reported the status of his last assignment and was then assigned to a new one before heading back to the Gila Military Base in New Mexico. Davis's missions are classified as covert operations; therefore, he never tells Catherine of his whereabouts for safety reasons and his loyalty to the corps.\n\nCurrently, he is on a video call with his wife and six years old son, Catherine and Mike.\n\nMike: \"Daddy, will you be home on Christmas Eve?\"\n\nDavis: \"Sure Mike, I’ll not miss it for the world. I miss you son.\" \n\nMike: \"But last year you also promised but you were not home on Christmas and New Year?\" \n\nDavis: \"I am so sorry Mike, but daddy was busy last year. Look, I tell you what, Daddy promise will be home before Christmas and I got a surprise for you and Mommy.\" \n\nMike: \"Mommy, Daddy said he got a surprise for me and you. Daddy, when will you return home?\" \n\n\"Davis! Briefing room, ASAP!\", Officer Monk shows up and interrupts Davis's conversation with his 6 years old son. \n\nDavis: \"Mike, Daddy got to go. Be good and help Mommy, you hear me kid?\" \n\nMike: \"Okay, Daddy.\" Though he is not pleased with his father's decision to end the video call too soon.\n\nSuddenly, Davis's wife takes over the iPhone from her son.\n\nCatherine: “Sweetheart, can Mommy talk to Daddy? Mommy needs to tell Daddy about something,” then she switches the call mode to a private conversation as she walks to the kitchen.\n\nCatherine: \"Again Davis? It’s not even five minutes yet?\" \n\nDavis: \"Look, Honey, I'll be home on the fifth, but don't tell Mike about it, I want to surprise him. I love you both. Honey, I am sorry. I got to go.\" \n\nCatherine is upset with Davis's excuses and she hung up the call without saying anything. \n\nFor a moment Davis was having a mixed feeling between disappointment with himself and the need to be patient at the same time. He closes his eyes, then after a while, he sighs.\n\nDavis switches his mobile phone off and walks to the briefing room. Inside the military base, all personal mobile phones must remain switched off except inside the cafeteria.\n\n***December 2024, Albuquerque, New Mexico. Catherine’s residence.***\n\nSomewhere in a rented apartment in downtown Albuquerque, Catherine has recently switched off her call with her husband. Catherine holds herself not to cry but she sometimes found herself having no clue whether she loves her husband so much or just hated him too much because he is rarely available at home with her. \n\nCatherine opens the fridge to get a glass of milk for Mike while she mumbles, “Just be patient Catherine. It’s not his first time he did it, and it’ll certainly not be his last.”\n\nShe puts the glass of milk beside Mike while he is busy playing with his toys on the dining table. Some minutes later, she opens her mobile phone again and writes a short message (SMS) to Davis. \n\nCatherine writes: \"Davis, I am so sorry. I just missed you so much. Promise me to be safe and see you soon. Charlie-Mama-Lima-Delta ...\" \n\nShe always adds “Charlie-Mama-Lima-Delta” on her SMS to Davis at the end which means Catherine-Mike-Love-Davis, although Davis never does the same.\n\n***17:00, August 2025. Somewhere in the outskirt of Gila National Forest Park.***\n\nInside the First-Ring of the misty forest, Davis is looking closely using his MRAD sniper scope. He still could not believe what he sees and whispers repeatedly to himself, \"No, No, ... This can't be true!\"\n\n## CHAPTER FIVE\n\n### Love your neighbor like yourself\n\n![(Illustration 07)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BEM9WoTI_A5qVrRO8823h.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***Albuquerque, New Mexico. Early December 2024***\n\nCatherine has been sitting for half an hour in the living room apartment. She picks her mobile phone several times and hopes there is a Short Message or call from Davis. Today, all she ever wanted—after her last SMS to Davis—was a reply from her husband to say anything that gives a clear sign for Catherine that Davis is still truly cares for her and Mike.  \n\nWell, she feels like she deserves it, at least after living patiently alone for four and half years, although she married Davis nine years ago. Each year she only spends six months with her husband. And most of all on this late evening, she misses him so much and needs something that can cheer her mood. \n\nWhile she keeps staring at her mobile phone, suddenly Mike says to Catherine, \"Mommy, why is there a cloud outside?\" \n\nCatherine: \"What cloud? Where?\" \n\nMike: \"There.\" he points out to the balcony that is facing the city.\n\nThe balcony has a panoramic view of the city. This was one of the reasons Catherine chose the apartment. She likes to sit at night thinking about her life and wonder will she be able to see her husband again? Safe and still in one piece.\n\nCatherine often listens to romantic Mexican music and watches the beautiful night lights of the beautiful city of Albuquerque. She hopes it can ease the pain inside her heart from missing her husband.\n\nCatherine is still sitting on the living room sofa when Mike says about the cloud. So, she cannot see what’s happening outside her apartment. The balcony door is near the dining table opposite the kitchen where mike is playing with his toys. She immediately gets up from the sofa and walks towards the balcony. \n\nAs she reaches the dining table, she takes a glance and sees the city is covered by white smoke. She felt disbelieve but it’s real. As she thinks it could be fire smoke, she says, “O God, is it forest fire?” Fear suddenly struck her mind and she breathes faster than usual though tries to calm herself down. She opens the balcony and steps out to the balcony. \n\nAs she gets closer and holds the balcony handrail, she looks at the street below. She sees the whole neighborhood is empty. No cars passing by or people walking around as they used to. She ponders, “Where the hell is everybody?” \n\nCatherine looks closer toward her car at the parking lot below and sees one of her neighbors who lives on the ground floor is standing beside her car. Her name is Mrs. Abigail. She is an elderly lady and lives alone with her cat, Beatrice after her husband passed away four years ago. Catherine doesn't know Mrs. Abigail well but since she walks with a four-legged walker and smiles every time they met, Catherine felt sorry for what Mrs. Abigail is going through.  \n\nCatherine's apartment is only three floors high and that is why it's easy for her to identify the old lady who has been staring at her car for the last minute but without her walker.\n\nCatherine was surprised to see Mrs. Abigail is standing without her walker and shouts to her neighbor from the balcony, \"Mrs. Abigail! Mrs. Abigail! What are you doing? Where is Rosa? Why are you standing without your walker? Mrs. Abigail! Do you know why the city is covered with white smoke? Mrs. Abigail! … Mrs. Abigail!”\n\nDespite she shouted to Mrs. Abigail from the balcony, Mrs. Abigail just keeps standing in front of Catherine's car without the walker and she did not respond to what Catherine is saying.\n\nShe feels something strange is happening, but suddenly, she hears her apartment door was opened. She quickly rushes back into her apartment and saw her main apartment door was opened. She looks at the dining table and Mike was gone! She spontaneously says, \"O GOD, NO!\" \n\nShe panics and runs chasing Mike to the stairs. As she rushes on the stairs to the ground floor, she yells, “Mikey! Come back here! Stop! Mikey!\" \n\nWhile running on the stairs, she wonders, how a six-year-old boy runs these stairs so fast that she couldn’t catch up on him. Catherine finally reaches the ground floor and she continues running to the main building entrance that is facing the main street. The main door is partly glass. So the main street is visible. \n\nShe can see Mrs. Abigail is still standing facing her car, and several meters away behind Mrs. Abigail, Mike is walking towards Mrs. Abigail. \n\nCatherine feels relief for a moment, but now she sees something frightening and almost impossible. The neighbor she knew can barely stand on her two feet moreover to walk because she’ll need a walker to do it. At that time, she vividly sees part of Mrs. Abigail's clothes has reddish stains, which from where Catherine sees it, it's looks like fresh blood. \n\nIn that frightening moment, Catherine suddenly feels as if everything moves in slow motion. \n\nShe sees Mrs. Abigail's apartment door is opened and more bloodstains are seen on the floor and wall near the apartment’s door. She found Beatrice's dead body. Mrs. Abigail's cat was lying dead in a pool of blood not far from the door. Beatrice's neck was cold-bloodedly ripped off. \n\nSeeing what she saw, Catherine runs to the door to grab Mike as fast as she could, but somehow her legs are not responding to her will, and by the time she reaches the main building door, Mike is already too close to Mrs. Abigail. She yells so loud trying to stop Mike from getting closer to Mrs. Abigail, \"Mikey Stop! Mikey!\" \n\nCatherine tries to run faster but somehow, she couldn't. \n\nShe shouts repeatedly, and yet innocent Mike just keeps walking towards Mrs. Abigail. \n\nAs Mike stands behind Mrs. Abigail, she suddenly turns around and at that moment, Catherine sees the most frightening face she ever sees in her entire life!\n\n![(Illustration 08)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D6-QdXYsRo7SuuNgLa5_1.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nStill struck by the fear of what she sees, Mrs. Abigail suddenly moves to hold Mike.\n\nCatherine knew Mike made a mistake as he probably thought that the old lady standing by her car is the nice and warm-hearted Mrs. Abigail, their neighbor. \n\nAs Mrs. Abigail grabs Mike's jacket. Catherine cries and her mind flees at that frightening moment and shouts her husband’s name, Davis, who always lives far away from home, leaving her and Mike alone.\n\nCathrine screams: “Davis, help me! Davis! … Mikey!\n\nThough scares as hell, Catherine pulls herself together and gives all her strength and courage to save her one and only son, Mike. \n\nAs Catherine gets closer, she sees the frightening face of Mrs. Abigail who already looks like a dead person. Her eyes are yellowish red and her mouth is dripping thick colored blood which Catherine thought is Beatrice who was known in the neighborhood as the fat cat. \n\nKnowing he makes a mistake, Mike is terrified as he sees Mrs. Abigail's face and he turns to rush back into the apartment building. As Mike turns swiftly, the monster or someone who looks like Mrs. Abigail grabs his shoulder with her right hand. Mike struggles to fight back because both his hand is loosened and he yells, \"Mommy help! Help me! Mommy! \n\nWith both hands, Catherine quickly grabs both of Mike's arms as she tries to pull her son with all her strength to safety. She cries and yells, \"Let him go you old hag! Let Mikey go!”\n\nCatherine keeps screaming and she can hear Mike was screaming desperately to be saved from Mrs. Abigail. \n\n\"Mommy! Wake up! Mommy! Wake up!\" \n\nSlowly ... Catherine hears Mike’s screams become louder and she suddenly awakes from her sleep and sees Mike standing in front of him inside the living room apartment crying while calling her name. \n\n\"Mommy! Mommy! Please, wake up! You scare me. Why do you keep calling Daddy and me?\" Asks Mike.\n\n## CHAPTER SIX\n\n### Certain plans in an uncertain time\n\n![(Illustration 09)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_BbKwUBrjtYmpWBmC2vyR.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***The year is 2025. A helo flying on route 180 heading North near Whispering Pines, New Mexico.***\n\nBravo-One: \"Eagle-One, come in Eagle-One, this is Bravo-One. Bravo-One Oscar-Mike and five clicks from Outpost-One. Over.\"\n\nEagle-One: \"Eagle-One to Bravo-One. Roger-Tango, Lima-Charlie. Break. Bravo-One, be advised the ground is FUBAR after sunset. Advance with caution. Over.\"\n\nBravo-One: \"Roger that. Bravo-One, Out.\"\n\nThe bravo-One team consists of four highly trained spec ops. They know the vicinity and the surroundings of the Gila National Forest well since they have been guarding the base before Z-Day. They used to disguise themselves as forest rangers to scare hikers away who come in too close to the secret military base, then they told them to return because they’ve entered wolves or bear hunting ground and not safe to proceed.\n\nDespite the Bravo-One team have the knowledge and experience of the Gila forest, but before Z-Day, most people have reported strange-looking Oak Trees appeared in many areas and some grew overnight.\n\nAs Blackbird-509 is preparing to land in a nearby open field on the edge of the Second-Ring of the misty forest, the Bravo-One team is checking their weapons and communication unit inside the Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk for the last time. The helo that carries the Bravo-One team is like a tank and will provide air support for the ground team. The Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk has two external wings that can support four weapons on each side, like the 50-cal (12.7mm) gun, Hydra 70 rocket pods, and Hellfire missiles. There is also a 7.62mm minigun mounted on the side of the cockpit and controlled remotely using the pilot visor’s helmet.\n\n***17:02. Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the mist***\n\nOfficer Davis still can’t trust what he sees. He needs to be perfectly sure that whatever he sees is real and not his imagination. He keeps looking through his sniper scope and waits until the object becomes closer and clearer.\n\nPerhaps it's fate or mere coincidence on that late afternoon because a heavy storm is also gathering above some parts of the surrounding misty forest in Gila. The wind is building speed fast and followed by dark clouds thickening by the minute. The stormy weather makes the misty forest even darker at sunset. As a spec op, Davis knew well that stormy weather is his advantage over the enemy but at the same time, it can also become his biggest obstacle.\n\nThe high-speed wind scatters the mist and makes Officer Davis finally has the visual ability to see and confirmed the wobbling red dot with certainty. Then he uses the sniper scope again to zoom to what is behind the red object, and what he sees has brought fear down to Davis’s spine!\n\nOnce Davis knew what he is about to face, he takes a deep breath and sighs. He knows he is facing the impossible, but then his mind tries to make a quick plan but today, time is not on his side!\n\n**(To be continued)**", "timestamp": 1633510155, "digest": "cvfeCUhakb4FFnb4geW3ZmzfZ5S1ZRRBTERR0r1xWQQ", "contributor": "0xc1C41e3606bF2756c09c95132F528012be17f724"}
{"id": "fYx2ALYAX6tpehkb0yMXD5IiJQZTF_06UaKxxfDF9j0", "title": "STOs and your options", "body": "Over the period of 2017 and 2018, a total of 2,104 ICO’s were launched with a total of USD 13,768,377968 raised. Most of the ICOs managed to raise the required funds. The investors made money, with ETH prices on the rise, the projects made more just by holding ETH and selling them at all-time high whilst some held on to ETH and saw its value erode.\n\nOne of the reasons why most projects have gone down the ICO route is due to its ease of launch. ICOs also give private investors a chance to be a part of something bigger, due to restrictions and red tapes.\n\n*A crypto token that passes the Howey Test is deemed a security token.*\n\n***What is Howey Test***\\*: \\*\n\n*The genesis of the Howey Test was a 1946 Supreme Court case. In the case, the titular W.J. Howey Company sold citrus grove plots to outside investors. Howey and the investors reached an arrangement whereby the buyers would immediately lease the groves back to Howey, which would harvest and sell the resulting citrus products.*\n\n*The Supreme Court ruled the citrus groves, in this case, to constitute an investment contract and, thus, a security. It applied four main criteria in making this decision, which subsequently became known as the Howey Test.*\n\n***In order for a financial instrument to be dubbed a security and fall under the purview of the SEC, the instrument must meet these four criteria:***\n\no  *It must be an investment of money*\n\no  *With an expectation of profit*\n\no  *In a common enterprise*\n\no  *With the profit to be generated by a third party.*\n\n*The citrus grove in the precedent was bought with money and an expectation of profit by a pool of common investors, and its success depended on Howey’s ability to profitably make money from selling its citrus products.*\n\nWhile ICOs were not deemed securities by the legal entities, others are being looked into to determine if they are securities tokens sold under the guise of utility tokens. We have already seen SEC slapping fines on ICOs for illegally selling securities. The SEC is continuing scrutinizing the projects An it seems they will not stop there. They are also putting the “advisors” and media personalities under the microscope for their role in promoting ICOs. Likes of DJ Khaled and Floyd Maywheather have already been fined for their involvement in blockchain projects that have not brought the promised results.\n\nFor upcoming projects that want to go down the ICO route, they have to be very careful on how they conduct themselves. The SEC is planning on setting up a division which will be dedicated to assisting start-ups in fintech. This will help startups avoid issues that are currently faced by the ICOs launched in the last couple of years.\n\nThis brings me nicely to the topic of my discussion: STOs.\n\nHaving said all the above, the future of tokens lies in Security Tokens. Security Tokens, unlike Utility Tokens, derive their value from an external asset they are backed by. By following the correct procedures these may prove to be very powerful instruments.\n\nCurrently, the projects out there are working hard to streamline the launch of securities. Unlike ICOs, STOs require a whole new infrastructure and a different approach. STOs need a team of lawyers who are familiar with the securities legislation within the jurisdiction, advisors and relevant regulators to give it the go-ahead. The whole STO process can be very tedious but if done right, can reap immense rewards, for both, individual investors and the projects themselves.\n\nLet’s discuss some of the projects currently providing a launch pad to issue security tokens.\n\n1\\.    Polymath\n\n2\\.    Securitize\n\n3\\.    Harbor\n\n4\\.    Securrency\n\n5\\.    Swarm\n\n**Polymath (ST20 Token)**\n\nWhile Polymath is an ST20 Token (Utility Token), it provides a platform to launch security tokens and is currently, one of the most popular platforms in the market. Polymath introduces traditional financial securities to blockchain. Their process is seamless and provides step-by-step guide including creating and issuing tokens, and the fundraising stage.\n\nThe platform is made of four layers, which define compliance and the generation of tokens:\n\n·       Protocol Layer\n\n·       Application Layer\n\n·       Legal Layer\n\n·       Exchange Layer\n\n[https://polymath.network/](https://polymath.network/)\n\n**Harbor (R-Token, ERC-20 with additional on-chain features)**\n\nThe main aim of Harbor (R-Token) is to simplify the tokenisation process and make compliance easy and transparent. The founding members created Harbour when they were trying to raise funds via an ICO but were faced with multiple compliance and technical challenges.\n\nHarbour token is a standard ERC-20 token coupledwith additional layers tailored to compliance. Built within the on-chain are the essential requirements such as AML, KYC and certification of assets.\n\nR-Token is an open source platform. Harbor’s goal is to issue smart contracts that envelope the regulatory services and to standardise security tokens. These can then be freely issued and exchanged as long as the requirements are met.\n\n[https://harbor.com/](https://harbor.com/)\n\n**Securitize (CAT20)**\n\nOne of the most reputed platform within the STO issuance platform is Securitize (CAT20). Securitize is the latest offering in this space.\n\nSecuritize has the ability to integrate third-party apps that operate on Ethereum blockchain which enables the projects to work with third party developers.\n\nThe development team is committed to enhancing the platforms security for funds and capital investors as well as asset managers.\n\nSecuritize provides a cradle to grave solution for projects looking to undertake Security Token Offerings.\n\nTheir on-chain solution provides a register of users that hold the DS Token together with all KYC information along with jurisdiction, accreditation and expiry dates.\n\nSecuritize is also compatible with Harbor and Polymath tokens.\n\nThe main elements in this ecosystem are:\n\n·       DS Tokens: ERC-20 compliant tokens, extended with the capabilities of the DS Protocol.\n\n·       DS Apps: Smart Contracts designed to manage specific lifecycle events for a Digital Security. Examples for this are issuance DS Apps, exchange-specific DS Apps, voting rights DS Apps or dividend issuance DS Apps.\n\n·       DS Services\n\no  Trust Service\n\no  Registry Service\n\no  Compliance Service\n\no  Communications Service\n\n[https://www.securitize.io/](https://www.securitize.io/)\n\n**Securrency**\n\nBy far the most unique STO platform is Securrency.\n\nSecurrency is not just a security token issuance platform. It is also a currency, exchange, bond and exchange traded fund shares.\n\nSecurrency provides a simple mechanism to issue tokens with a single click. Organisations whichdo not understand blockchain can use their offering with ease. Moreover, it is blockchain agnostic and provides an API and an abstraction layer called InfiniXChange. InfiniXChange lets you choose a blockchain of your choice.\n\nThey also have RegTex engine which performs KYC and AML in more than 160 countries on not only fiat but also cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nLiquidity remains an issue for most of the projects. With Securrency, using their “network effect”, investors can raise funds faster and their automated model can help with tokenisation in no time. It allows the users to tokenise their assets hassle-free regardless of the asset types.\n\n[https://www.securrency.com/](https://www.securrency.com/)\n\n**Swarm (SRC20)**\n\nThe Swarm token is based on SRC20 protocol. The project aims to tokenise assets such as real estate and crypto hedge funds amongst many others.\n\nSwarm provides a platform to launch security tokens based on blockchain. The protocol (SRC20) is an extension to ERC20 token with the ability to add features such as legal rights, trading restrictions, asset description, etc.\n\nThe Swarm platform is composed of three primary layers:\n\n·       Core – Governance, legal, security\n\n·       Services – Fund, syndicate, etc.\n\n·       Application – Crypto hedge fund, real estate, energy, etc.\n\nSwarm also aims to develop AI which will enable users to deploy bots within the Swarm platform.\n\n[https://swarm.fund/](https://swarm.fund/)\n\nReference:\n\n[https://icowatchlist.com/blog/best-sto-issuance-platforms/](https://icowatchlist.com/blog/best-sto-issuance-platforms/)\n\n*<https://coinsutra.com/security-tokens-platform/>*", "timestamp": 1633510040, "digest": "Eu6TL1guN3Uj6sDZrv_QOrQfJhelG1WVjwAo69jDF0U", "contributor": "0x6b679e96aB426199baaf2D84c8bD5CdBe844867D"}

{"id": "vKxcT5atWfQsM28m8yixP4cHosE7zA5MIigrKreXs58", "title": "DeFiner 2.0: A truly permissionless and configurable DeFi lending protocol with your privacy 100% protected", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c8xRzciYmgAUyR0DEHgKj.jpg?height=559&width=1419)\n\nToday, we are excited to present a deeper dive into DeFiner 2.0. Our newest upgrade will allow the user to not only create the most configurable lending pool, but it is completely permissionless and protects your privacy 100%.\n\nDeFiner 2.0 will introduce:\n\n* Smart Contract Factory which produces lending market on demand\n* Configuration Features: To customize risk control & interest model Money Market\n* Connection to help aggregate liquidity \n* Privacy Function to conduct an internal private balance transfer \n\n  In this article, we will be diving into the details of these key features, what drives us to create DeFiner 2.0 and why is DeFiner 2.0 the future of DeFi lending.\n\n  **1. The Problem with Current DeFi Lending Protocols** \n\n  The DeFi industry is still on the way to true decentralization. Current DeFi lending protocols serve as gatekeepers, reserving the right to decide which tokens will become part of their pools while leaving many tokens and digital assets unavailable to lend.\n\nAs a response, some protocols introduced a DAO governance model to decide which coins will be listed in their pools. However, even with a DAO system, the design is still considered a centralized framework because its power is concentrated within a small handful of people instead of the entire community.\n\nCurrently, there are more than 10,000 tokens listed on CoinMarketCap, but there are less than 50 crypto assets supported by current lending protocols today. These platforms are the only protocols available to top market cap tokens because their liquidation mechanisms rely on the oracle price feed model.\n\nCurrent lending protocols risk management mechanisms are only able to support crypto assets with similar risk levels, preventing them from providing a lending market for low-market cap tokens. This is why most assets do not have their own lending markets, because it makes scalability impossible.\n\nOnce this lending problem is solved there are many possibilities, giving tremendous opportunities to low liquidity assets like NFTs, real estate, credit tokens, and more.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rRoWYic3inZbksmZClGVt.png?height=492&width=1290)\n\n**2. The Solution — DeFiner 2.0: A Permissionless, Configurable Lending Protocol with Privacy 100% Protected** \n\nDeFiner’s next-generation product, DeFiner2.0, successfully solves this lending problem by creating a 100% permissionless lending protocol. In DeFiner 2.0 anyone can create their own lending pool by using any token or digital assets they choose.\n\nEvery pool will give someone complete control over it, with highly-customized configurations like risk control, interest rate, and choice of oracle. These customized configurations will help avoid isolation by keeping a reasonable degree of liquidity for each pool in order to improve capital utilization. Each lending pool will be connected to our money market main savings pool — which supports high-liquidity assets like stablecoins, BTC, ETH, and more.\n\nIn DeFiner 2.0, we plan to introduce even more applications into our ecosystem over time, including Initial Loan Offerings (ILOs), non-collateralized loans, off-chain asset-backed loans, fixed-rate loans, term loans, and a variety of different offerings based on community feedback.\n\nDeFiner 2.0 represents a near-perfect solution for the current problems facing DeFi lending protocols today and is designed to bring a true form of decentralization to the global DeFi ecosystem.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/idqX1oASaw0F_P6Pscxry.png?height=289&width=689)\n\n**3.0 How does DeFiner 2.0 Works?**\n\n**3.1 Smart Contract Factory**\nAs we mentioned earlier, risk management mechanisms used by current DeFi lending protocols can only support coins with similar risk levels. The current DeFi lending protocol design makes it nearly impossible for a lending pool to risk volatile assets against stronger ones, simply because of the liquidation mechanism.\n\nBut DeFiner has discovered a solution to this lending dilemma — configuration. We created a new mechanism where anyone can create a separate lending pool with fully customizable parameters based on different token liquidity. DeFiner 2.0 will have a built-in, configurable Smart Contract Factory that offers the user total control over their lending pool.\n\nOn the back end, our Smart Contract Factory will generate a smart contract based on the different configurations users can input when creating their own lending pool.\n\n**3.2 Configurations**\nThe configuration mechanism can manage the risks better because we are able to separate different risk levels by creating and then separating another pool. Essentially, our Child Debt Market works to isolate the risks from our main savings pool.\n\nAnd where there are risks, there are rewards. Our method will efficiently reward risk-takers with a higher APR for taking a chance. And to ensure better risk management and returns, DeFiner will allow users to configure three categories: 1. Risk Control Model; 2. Interest Model, and 3. Oracle Model.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GfY3i7gSSaUJL6ObBS4kd.png?height=631&width=1600)\n\nBelow are some examples of what users can configure under each category.\n\n**1.Risks Control Model**\n\nParameters in this category are designed to manage a borrower’s behavior and to prevent loan default. Different markets have different volatility levels, so they should have different LTV (Loan-To-Value), liquidation threshold, and discounted ratios. Below are some parameters that users can configure in DeFiner 2.0.\n\nBorrow LTV for collateral\nBorrow LTV for lending currency such as USDT, USDC, DAI, and ETH\nPre-Configured Parameter:\nLiquidation Threshold: 85%\nLiquidation Discount Ratio: 95%\n\n\n**2.Interest Model**\n\nConfigurations in the Interest Model are designed to reward the risk-takers and attract lenders to the pool. Users can adjust interest rates based on different tokens’ liquidity and their needs. Parameters like staking APR, lending currency debt APR and even the mining speed are all available for customization to control the interest rate. The higher the risk, the higher the return.\n\nStaking APR range\nDebt APR range for lending currency\nDeposit Mining Speeds for Each Token\nBorrow Mining Speeds for Each Token\n\n**3.Oracle Model**\n\nOracle models are risk control configurations. Not all token prices are available on mainstream Oracles. Based on the different liquidity of each token,  DeFiner offers three different Oracle models for users to choose to mitigate risk.\n\nChainlink: We use Chainlink as our Oracle for high liquidity tokens.\nUniswap: We use Uniswap for low and middle-level liquidity tokens as our price source.\nDeFiner Oracle: For tokens that are not listed on the market yet, we are using the DeFiner native Oracle as our price source. The price will be reviewed and assessed by DeFiner DAO periodically.\n\nConfiguration Updates\n\nAfter a Child Debt Market is created, anyone can send a proposal to update the configurations. If the user wants to update anything they can send a request for the updates needed in the configurations.\n\nIt’s not unusual for users to run into a situation where their Child Debt Markets configurations might need to be changed. For example, when the underlying collateral liquidity increases dramatically, the pool will tolerate a higher collateral factor. The user can submit a proposal to increase the collateral factor. Such proposals should be reviewed and approved by DeFiner DAO.\n\n**3.2 Money Market to Aggregate Liquidity**\nEven an isolated configurable lending pool makes it possible to resolve the risk and reward issues, while the liquidity of each pool is very limited compared to the standardized money market DeFi protocol.\n\nThe lack of liquidation is not up to par for any lenders who want to quickly exit their position. At the same time, the capital utilization may be lower than the standardized pool because it is isolated. Therefore, the child debt market model cannot function well unless the liquidation issue is resolved.\n\nAnd to solve the isolated debt market liquidity problem, DeFiner 2.0 will implement three approaches:\n\nConnect to money markets to aggregate unused capital\nSecondary Debt Market for users who want to exit their position early\nReview Terms & Borrow Reserve FactorA. Connections to Money Markets\n\nDeFiner 1.0 has an aggregator function that connects our savings pool to money markets like  Compound. All Child Debt Markets (generated in the Smart Contract Factory) are connected to DeFiner 1.0 (our main savings pool), and other protocols like Compound and AAVE. This will be the cornerstone of DeFiner 2.0.\n\nConnecting all of these child debt markets to money market protocols solves the lack of liquidation issue efficiently. The DeFiner 1.0 main savings pool/money market, combined with other protocols will effectively aggregate all unused capital inside the Child Debt Market. The mechanism is used to improve excessive capital.\n\nWe use a pre-configured parameter, the Reserve Ratio, to determine how much funds to allocate in the money market. The minimum Reserve Ratio is 10%, and the maximum Reserve Ratio is 20%.\n\nAs an example, let’s say we have $1 million inside the child debt market, $500,000 has been lent out. The Reserve Ratio is 10%, meaning the remaining $500,0000 unused capital will be divided into two portions. $50,000 will be the reserved balance, while the remaining $450,000  will be lent out to the money market.\n\nB. Secondary Debt Market\n\nThe second mechanism DeFiner uses to ensure liquidity is through a secondary debt market. Users will have the option to tokenize their debt position and trade it on a secondary market. Users will receive a dToken, a tokenized representation of their debt position. If users want an early exit and there is a lack of lending currency available, the user can swap their dToken in the secondary debt market at a market-driven price.\n\nC. Review Terms & Borrow Reserve Factor\n\nLiquidation is a good way of managing a borrower’s behavior and ensuring they repay the loan and interest. Currently, collateral on DeFiner is open for forced liquidation when LTV>= 85% (Read the liquidation mechanism details here). DeFiner 2.0 introduces a Review Terms mechanism if Loan-To-Value falls below 85%. Liquidation will happen if either one of the following criteria is met. The Review Terms mechanism provides more flexibility.\n\nCriterion 1: Use the Borrow Reserve Factor (BRF) to control the lending currency reserve to ensure there is always liquidity for lenders to withdraw.\nBRF is calculated by lending currency Total Value Locked (TVL) divided by the total value of debt outstanding. BRF should always be between 0 to 10%. If BRF is equal to 0, the liquidation process will be triggered to bring the BRF back to 10%.\nCriterion 2: Use the time frame mechanism to trigger liquidation. Based on the terms, the liquidation process will be triggered periodically. During the configuration process, DeFiner 2.0 provides users with the option of 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, or 12-month terms. At the end of each term, the need for funds in the pool increases. This triggers the BRF requirement to change from 0-10% to 10-30%.\nDuring this period, if the BRF falls below 10%, the liquidation process will be triggered to bring the BRF back to 30%. The process is designed to give users a window to withdraw funds. The window will last for 7 days. After 7 days is up, the BRF requirement will change back to its normal level which is at 0-10%.\n\n**3.3 Privacy**\nPrivacy protection is another critical matter in the current DeFi lending ecosystem. All transactions in DeFi are currently 100% public. Even though the user identity of each public address is not easily available, it is not “Mission Impossible” to identify a user and their related addresses through data analysis and mining. With the right know-how anyone can mine data with the identity or location of the wallet address. DeFiner believes that true financial freedom cannot be achieved without users having the option to make traceless transactions.\n\nThat’s why DeFiner 2.0 is poised to introduce a new privacy function into our smart contract. This new update will enable users to transfer their balance/s within our contract without disclosing any destination address information. The DeFiner smart contract will act as a black box and break up the on-chain link between deposit source and withdrawal destination addresses, giving users 100% privacy of their account.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dh0KvUmZm9gNZ1YMs_4dy.png?height=631&width=1600)\n\nLet’s take a look at the process in more detail. When a user deposits into our smart contract from address A, they will have the ability to conduct an encrypted internal transfer from Address A to Address B. This transfer process is encrypted with zero-knowledge proof. When the transfer is initiated, an encryption key, which is only available to the user, will be generated. The key will be required when the user wants to withdraw funds.\n\nThere will be no link between the deposit and the withdrawal with this mechanism, helping the user without recording any relational information between the deposit and withdrawal addresses.\n\n**4. DeFiner 2.0 Use Case There are five major functions in DeFiner 2.0:**\n\n* Borrowing \n* Lending \n* Create Markets \n* Staking \n* Private Balance Transfers\n\n\nWe will use some real-world examples to walk you through all five of our functions. Let’s say Company A is a blockchain startup, who has just closed a lead investment and has a SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Token), a token price, and a tokenomics plan.\n\n**Create a Debt Market and Run an Initial Loan Offering Campaign**\nProject A also sets a date for initial public listing. Instead of raising money from investors, they have an option to use the DeFiner Debt Market to help raise funds by borrowing from the community. This saves time and helps them build a robust community around their project from the beginning. With more community exposure there will be better growth for a project. We call this process the Initial Loan Offering (ILO). The ILO is different from an IDO (Initial DEX Offering) in that instead of selling tokens in a pre-sale where only high-value investors get exclusive access to new projects at a discounted rate, the DeFiner community gets first access to new projects launching on our protocol.\n\nProject A will input the loan collateral and the configurations such as Debt APR Range, Staking APR Range, Review Terms, and Collateral Factors. After Project A inputs all the necessary configurations, they must ensure enough collateral tokens in their wallet.\n\nProject A will then approve the spending limit of the token and the lending currency. After Project A supplies collateral, DeFiner’s Contract Factory will generate a smart contract based on the configurations Project A inputted, and then a debt market will be successfully created for the project.\n\n**Borrow Against Token**\nNow that Project A has successfully created the debt market its next mission is to attract lenders. Project A will have to run promotions, provide a detailed fund usage plan, set up an attractive interest and token mining rate, and a default plan to efficiently attract lenders. DeFiner will also help to promote these projects through the DeFiner community.\n\nOnce Project A successfully attracts enough lenders, Project A can start borrowing funds anytime they want based on its availability. A borrowing power (factor*collateral value) will be defined. Borrowing power is calculated by factor*collateral value. The borrowed amount should always be less than or equal to the borrowing power which is equal to collateral\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XqfmsHF5JbQM7TYNNNtaj.png?height=631&width=1600)\n\n**Lend to Earn Interest and Token Rewards**\nLet’s look at the lender's side. Consumer B is the typical consumer, and a member of Company A’s community that wants to buy their token before it's listed. If Customer B finds the terms and by Project A attractive, they can deposit their funds to Project A’s debt market. Once Customer B deposits the funds, they will receive dTokens which will represent their deposit balance position. Customer B’s reward is in two portions: the staking portion which is provided by Project A; and the interest rate portion.\n\n**Stake and Earn Rewards**\nStartup A can run a staking program in their lending market to encourage the community to deposit their token to the lending pool and reward them with interest. Communities have a better chance to turn into long-term holders because they can make passive income from their tokens instead of sitting idly in their wallet. Token holders need to simply deposit the underlying collateral into the lending market and earn passive income. Also, if they need cash in the short term, they can borrow against their token.\n\nEarly-stage startup tokens are just one category of debt markets. Because of our unique and permissionless design of the protocol, DeFiner enables limitless use cases for opening and running a lending market for any tokens.\n\nWe have identified the following seven personas who would use DeFiner 2.0:\n\n* Early-stage startup token before token listing and trading\n* Mid Stage startup token after token listing and trading, but with limited liquidity\n* Late-stage startup token, public trading, and with good liquidity\n* NFT asset-backed debt market\n* Off-chain asset-backed debt market \n* Non-collateral loan market \n* LP(Liquidity Provider) token or any other tokenized position market\n\n**6. Why DeFiner 2.0 is the Future of DeFi Lending**\n\n\nIf we look at the history of DeFi, the first generation of the lending protocol is peer-to-peer lending, while the second generation is the savings pools model protocol. DeFiner is poised to lead the DeFi space with our third generation DeFi lending protocol, a true permissionless and configurable protocol with 100% privacy protection. Permissionless will help us achieve true decentralization in the ecosystem, which means zero gatekeepers holding users back. Any digital assets or tokens can start their own lending pool.\n\nYour assets, your ownership. Configurations will help to manage the risk and rewards better for the tokens. Finally, the privacy function will bring an extra layer of protection to the end-users.\n\nNow, what do we mean when we say we protect your privacy 100%? Our revolutionary zero-knowledge proof wallet transfer system, allows you to move funds from an infinite number of wallet addresses without ever revealing your private information or wallet address.", "timestamp": 1633510192, "digest": "S2rtmVKbLJv9jBHustjVNq8wJqzHi16tAq2z5DI1qMM", "contributor": "0xF907Df2eDA77a9e8e314Cc68ea7A6904eB0c7970"}

Who is paid?*** ➡ **Rightsholders**. This can be a musician/artist, a songwriter (who may not be the artist), a record label, or a number of other entities. Or some combination.\n\n***2. How much do they get paid?*** ➡ Rightsholders are \\***not\\* paid a flat rate per play, listen, or stream of a song.** They are paid based on **streamshare**. I’ll elaborate on this more.\n\n**Streamshare** is pretty simple on the surface: the more streams a song gets — *proportionally* to all other songs in the same time period — the larger the share of revenue the rightsholder of that music receives.\n\n👉 ***Here’s an analogy***: think of a giant all-you-can-eat food buffet at a restaurant. Each musician has contributed various dishes of food to the buffet. Each song is a different dish of food that’s available, sitting on the buffet table, ready to be consumed.\n\nEvery month, a different number of people pay to eat at the buffet, so a different amount of money is made from buffet-access sales each month.\n\nHowever, some food is very popular. Some isn’t eaten at all. People eat some dishes *a lot* more than others. Contributors of the popular foods are proportionally paid a larger share of the proceeds from the pool of buffet earnings. **This is streamshare.**\n\n**It’s all you can eat, and what (and how much) you eat determines how much each rightsholder gets paid from the earnings for the right to access the buffet.**\n\n\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~\n\n## The Details: Rightsholders\n\n> * *“How do I become a rightsholder?”*\n> * *“Why aren’t artists always rightsholders?”*\n\nThere are a few factors to consider.\n\n### Copyrights:\n\nWhen you think of a song, there are **two copyrights**. One is the **composition** (the notes, melodies, lyrics, etc that make up a song). A composition is created — but not necessarily owned — by a songwriter.\n\nThe other is the sound **recording** (the actual recorded version of a composition). A recording is performed — but not necessarily owned — by an artist/musician.\n\n👉 ***For example***: you record yourself playing your favorite cover song on GarageBand. You own the recording copyright of that version, but you don’t own the composition.\n\n### Loans for recording music:\n\n*Often, artists need money to record music. \\\\n Often, a record label gives them that money as a loan.*\n\nIt’s generally a loan with bad terms for the artist because it’s high risk for a label (9/10 artists never make back the money; essentially defaulting on their loan, and the label loses money on their investment). You may also hear the word “advance.”\n\n✅ **Recording** copyright\n\n👉 ***An example***: this loan has some similarities to a bank loan (mortgage) to buy a house. If a person has a low credit score, they will have to pay a higher interest rate (a less favorable deal for the homebuyer). This is justified by the bank because the risk of not being paid back is higher (in theory). A higher credit score = a lower interest rate for a loan. Similarly, a popular artist will have better leverage for better recording deal terms because they are seen as a less risky investment.\n\n### Then there’s the composition copyright…\n\n…which is also called publishing or songwriter side. The publisher (sometimes a subsidiary of a label) can also become the rightsholder and get royalties here too, especially until it is “recouped” and a loan is paid back. Publishing can get really complicated.\n\nRegardless of the actual numbers here, let’s assume the payouts are pretty low and unfavorable to the creator. The terms and conditions can also be convoluted and very confusing.\n\nFor the purpose of understanding basic streaming payouts this is good enough, but just know I’ve particularly oversimplified this aspect. Here’s a good resource if you want to [learn more](https://soundcharts.com/blog/how-the-music-publishing-works).\n\n✅ **Composition** copyright\n\n### It gets even more complicated (and we’re skipping it):\n\nThere are a variety of other copyright collections and payments for rightsholders involved with music. We’re skipping them today. Broadly speaking, let’s just assume a musician who enters a traditional recording and publishing deal will see about 10% of the money both copyrights from their song generates. These aren’t exact terms, and they vary a lot, but this is a fair example conceptually. Here’s Spotify’s rundown of it if you want to [learn more](https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/).\n\n**🤘 You now understand basic intellectual property rights in the music industry.**\n\n## **Put all of this knowledge into bucket #1…we’ll connect it all together in a moment.**\n\nNow, in bucket #2, we have Spotify. They bring in billions of $’s a year in revenue from ads and subscription fees. After deducting some taxes, card fees, etc, they claim ***they pay out \\~67% of all revenue money to \\*rightsholders.\\****\n\n### Wtf is a rightsholder in this context?\n\nA rightsholder is whoever owns & controls the **composition** and **recording copyrights**. This might be an artist, label, publisher, or likely, a combo of these parties.\n\nThe music biz has done a TERRIBLE job adapting to the digital world here. It’s not really anyone’s fault specifically. It’s kind of like trying to build the most advanced city skyscraper on top of a foundation constructed for a rural log cabin built in the early 1800’s. **It works for a while; but the original structure was never intended for its contemporary purpose.**\n\n(As an aside, this is one of the reasons why I think there’s so much potential for smart contracts in the blockchain and distributed ledger space).\n\n👉 ***Example***: So, in the case of bucket #1, 67% of revenue goes to the label/pub… and then the artist might get, say, 10%. If Spotify gets $1.00 in revenue, $0.67 goes to the rightsholder (label/pub), then the artist gets $0.067…\n\n> ***One dollar ➡ 67 cents ➡ 6.7 cents.***\n\n**The artist gets paid almost nothing, but it’s not really Spotify’s fault (simplified).**\n\n**However**, say I’m the artist “Henry” and I write and record my own song and upload it to Spotify. I get my share of that entire 67% (minus some marginal collection fees). If Spotify netted $1.00, $0.67 goes to me as the rightsholder (and artist).\n\n**This is why it’s so important for us to work together so artists have alternative options for funding — and so that they have more *choices* about who the rightsholders of their music are.**\n\nThere absolutely are situations where working with a label could be the best option for an artist to choose, *and* it should also be exactly that, a *choice*.\n\n\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~\n\n# The Details: Streamshare\n\nThere is a second major caveat to streaming payments: **streamshare**. This is the dreaded “Spotify only pays $0.003 fraction of a penny per play.”\n\nThe issue is: *they don’t pay per play*. **Here’s how they calculate it…**\n\n👉 ***Example***: Spotify nets $100 revenue in March. \\~$67 would be paid to the rightsholders of the music that was streamed. Say “Drake” got 60 listens and “Henry” got 7 listens (and no other songs are listened to). “Drake” would get $60 and “Henry” would get $7.\n\nNext month, maybe Spotify nets $200 revenue because you and a few of your friends bought some new monthly Premium subscriptions. But “Drake” still gets 60 listens and “Henry” gets 7. Now, “Drake” and “Henry” **both make twice as much money, even though listenership remained the same**.\n\n> **⚠pay per listen ≠ streamshare⚠**\n\n\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~\n\n## Key takeaways\n\n* The music streaming payments system is still too opaque.\n* Artists don’t get paid by streaming services; the rightsholder do.\n* Two copyrights for a song: composition and sound recording.\n* Streaming doesn’t pay rightsholders per play; they pay per proportional plays to other streamed music. This is called streamshare.\n* The common argument is for streaming services to pay artists more. An alternative argument could be that streaming services need to generate more revenue, which means there is more money to split.\n* Low artist payments are primarily a mechanism of current recording deal structures and contemporary copyright ownership models.\n\nAs you can see, it can get complicated with millions of artists and rightsholders. I’m not for-or-against Spotify, labels, or any nascent technologies, such as Audius or Opulous.\n\nI just want a better ecosystem for artists to grow and thrive. I’m rooting for everyone who is working towards building a better future for musicians and their communities, and my hope is we can get there together.\n\nHave ideas about how we can do that?

You may also hear the word “advance.”\n\n✅ **Recording** copyright\n\n👉 ***An example***: this loan has some similarities to a bank loan (mortgage) to buy a house. If a person has a low credit score, they will have to pay a higher interest rate (a less favorable deal for the homebuyer). This is justified by the bank because the risk of not being paid back is higher (in theory). A higher credit score = a lower interest rate for a loan. Similarly, a popular artist will have better leverage for better recording deal terms because they are seen as a less risky investment.\n\n### Then there’s the composition copyright…\n\n…which is also called publishing or songwriter side. The publisher (sometimes a subsidiary of a label) can also become the rightsholder and get royalties here too, especially until it is “recouped” and a loan is paid back. Publishing can get really complicated.\n\nRegardless of the actual numbers here, let’s assume the payouts are pretty low and unfavorable to the creator. The terms and conditions can also be convoluted and very confusing.\n\nFor the purpose of understanding basic streaming payouts this is good enough, but just know I’ve particularly oversimplified this aspect. Here’s a good resource if you want to [learn more](https://soundcharts.com/blog/how-the-music-publishing-works).\n\n✅ **Composition** copyright\n\n### It gets even more complicated (and we’re skipping it):\n\nThere are a variety of other copyright collections and payments for rightsholders involved with music. We’re skipping them today. Broadly speaking, let’s just assume a musician who enters a traditional recording and publishing deal will see about 10% of the money both copyrights from their song generates. These aren’t exact terms, and they vary a lot, but this is a fair example conceptually. Here’s Spotify’s rundown of it if you want to [learn more](https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/).\n\n**🤘 You now understand basic intellectual property rights in the music industry.**\n\n## **Put all of this knowledge into bucket #1…we’ll connect it all together in a moment.**\n\nNow, in bucket #2, we have Spotify. They bring in billions of $’s a year in revenue from ads and subscription fees. After deducting some taxes, card fees, etc, they claim ***they pay out \\~67% of all revenue money to \\*rightsholders.\\****\n\n### Wtf is a rightsholder in this context?\n\nA rightsholder is whoever owns & controls the **composition** and **recording copyrights**. This might be an artist, label, publisher, or likely, a combo of these parties.\n\nThe music biz has done a TERRIBLE job adapting to the digital world here. It’s not really anyone’s fault specifically. It’s kind of like trying to build the most advanced city skyscraper on top of a foundation constructed for a rural log cabin built in the early 1800’s. **It works for a while; but the original structure was never intended for its contemporary purpose.**\n\n(As an aside, this is one of the reasons why I think there’s so much potential for smart contracts in the blockchain and distributed ledger space).\n\n👉 ***Example***: So, in the case of bucket #1, 67% of revenue goes to the label/pub… and then the artist might get, say, 10%. If Spotify gets $1.00 in revenue, $0.67 goes to the rightsholder (label/pub), then the artist gets $0.067…\n\n> ***One dollar ➡ 67 cents ➡ 6.7 cents.***\n\n**The artist gets paid almost nothing, but it’s not really Spotify’s fault (simplified).**\n\n**However**, say I’m the artist “Henry” and I write and record my own song and upload it to Spotify. I get my share of that entire 67% (minus some marginal collection fees). If Spotify netted $1.00, $0.67 goes to me as the rightsholder (and artist).\n\n**This is why it’s so important for us to work together so artists have alternative options for funding — and so that they have more *choices* about who the rightsholders of their music are.**\n\nThere absolutely are situations where working with a label could be the best option for an artist to choose, *and* it should also be exactly that, a *choice*.\n\n\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~\n\n# The Details: Streamshare\n\nThere is a second major caveat to streaming payments: **streamshare**. This is the dreaded “Spotify only pays $0.003 fraction of a penny per play.”\n\nThe issue is: *they don’t pay per play*. **Here’s how they calculate it…**\n\n👉 ***Example***: Spotify nets $100 revenue in March. \\~$67 would be paid to the rightsholders of the music that was streamed. Say “Drake” got 60 listens and “Henry” got 7 listens (and no other songs are listened to). “Drake” would get $60 and “Henry” would get $7.\n\nNext month, maybe Spotify nets $200 revenue because you and a few of your friends bought some new monthly Premium subscriptions. But “Drake” still gets 60 listens and “Henry” gets 7. Now, “Drake” and “Henry” **both make twice as much money, even though listenership remained the same**.\n\n> **⚠pay per listen ≠ streamshare⚠**\n\n\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~\n\n## Key takeaways\n\n* The music streaming payments system is still too opaque.\n* Artists don’t get paid by streaming services; the rightsholder do.\n* Two copyrights for a song: composition and sound recording.\n* Streaming doesn’t pay rightsholders per play; they pay per proportional plays to other streamed music. This is called streamshare.\n* The common argument is for streaming services to pay artists more. An alternative argument could be that streaming services need to generate more revenue, which means there is more money to split.\n* Low artist payments are primarily a mechanism of current recording deal structures and contemporary copyright ownership models.\n\nAs you can see, it can get complicated with millions of artists and rightsholders. I’m not for-or-against Spotify, labels, or any nascent technologies, such as Audius or Opulous.\n\nI just want a better ecosystem for artists to grow and thrive. I’m rooting for everyone who is working towards building a better future for musicians and their communities, and my hope is we can get there together.\n\nHave ideas about how we can do that?

Zed.Run **[racehorses have sold for as much as US$125,000](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/digital-race-horse-crypto-asset-mania-nft-zed-run-2021-4)** in **Ethereum**, with about $43 million in total sales\n\nI found this incredible and thought it would be useful to review what’s going on in Ethereum land.\n\n#### Ethereum - A lot to explore\n\nMost people have heard of at least two crypto currencies - Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlthough both are blockchain based protocols, Bitcoin is the OG and came before Ethereum.\n\nBut what makes Ethereum much more interesting is its\n\n1) Ability to provide scarcity to any digital asset\n\nBitcoin has built its narrative of doing one thing really well - being a store of value. It achieved this by solving the ‘double spend problem’. In other words you cannot send someone something digitally and also keep it yourself. Bitcoin was the first to solve this problem.\n\nHowever, with Bitcoin, this is only true if you are sending bitcoins; **the Bitcoin protocol only provides scarcity to bitcoins, nothing else.**\n\nOn the other hand - Ethereum has the capability of providing this scarcity to any digital asset.\n\n2) High programmability\n\nIn addition to that Bitcoin has very little programmability, whereas Ethereum has the ability to execute smart contracts. These smart contracts are basically If-Then instructions in code.\n\nModern programming languages are often benchmarked as being Turing Complete or Turing Incomplete - it is a measure of the level of complexity that the language is capable of handling.\n\nThe [scripting language](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/turing-complete) used in Bitcoin is intentionally designed as Turing Incomplete because it serves its purpose and increased complexity would potentially introduce problems.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is built as a Turing Complete blockchain. This is important because it needs to understand the agreements which make up smart contracts. By being Turing Complete, Ethereum has the capability to understand and implement any future agreement, even those that have not been thought of yet. In other words, Ethereum’s Turing Completeness means that it is able to use its code base to perform virtually any task, as long as it has the correct instructions, enough time and processing power.\n\nAn oft-used analogy is that if Bitcoin is a calculator, Ethereum is a computer.\n\nWhat this translates to in the real world - a rich ecosystem of applications.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2fdbd65-7ca1-4972-9a25-ebfb0baa09ad_560x379.png)\n\nLet’s dive in - left to right. Also in my mind the degree of ease of broad based consumer adoption drops from left to right.\n\n**1) Non-fungible Tokens (NFT)**\n\nSo this happened\n\nYep - Visa bought a NFT. A CryptoPunk to be more precise. They spent about US$150,000.\n\nAs you can see from the tweet, the rationale is to add to their collection of ‘historic commerce artifacts’\n\nPerhaps then the first application to try and understand is the one driven by the Eth protocol’s ability to *provide scarcity* to any digital asset.\n\nAn [NFT](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0) is a type of digital token which is unique and scarce. An NFT is essentially a unique proof of ownership of something, usually a digital asset. NFTs are digital versions of physical collector’s items and no two NFTs are the same.\n\nAs you can also see from the tweet - CryptoPunks are collectible characters on the Eth blockchain of which there are, and will only ever be 10,000!\n\nOfcourse you are wondering where you can get one for yourself. There are a few marketplaces - but one of the biggest ones is called [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). It accounts for 98% of Eth based NFTs traded volume.\n\nHere’s a look at their monthly volumes\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc83cc061-f2c8-4f55-b846-1b6c15ccb3f5_601x474.png)\n\nSource: https://decrypt.co/79689/opensea-weekly-nft-sales-surpass-1-billion-for-first-time\n\nSo for context - OpenSea did about $2.5bn in the month August.\n\nAlex Atallah, the co-founder of OpenSea is clearly thrilled\n\nHere are the top 5 NFTs by value traded on OpenSea. Note the last column specifies the scarcity aspect showing the cap on the number of NFTs\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F167f21e6-fe05-408f-bcf2-9dd2ed040416_1167x657.png)\n\nSo what does all of this lead to?\n\nChris Cantino of Color Capital has a great thread on how companies can use NFTs for marketing and community building.\n\nSummary of his views (examples are mine)\n\n* Companies pivot digital strategy to turn audiences into communities, giving them space to interact: financial and social capital, education and place where they belong.\n* Brands could either partner with existing communities or create their own\n* One example of leveraging the power of existing communities is what Visa did\n\n<!---->\n\n* Another path is for brands to tokenize access. Allowing exclusive access to products and content\n* They could also democratise decision making among token holders which moves the needle from “I love this business” to “I am a participant in the business”\n* An example of the above is the Paris St Germain Fan token. Fans of the club who hold the token can vote on nominal matters like motivational messages in team change rooms. Interestingly, [Messi’s transfer fee](https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/transfers/lionel-messi-to-be-paid-by-psg-partly-in-cryptocurrency-tokens/news-story/e282d8a3ff599834e2dcce16afdf7741) also included some component in these Fan tokens\n\nFinally here’s another thread with advice from Airtree’s John Henderson - who you can tell from the Twitter Avatar is an early adopter!\n\n**2) Gaming**\n\nOkay so moving onto the next application - Gaming\n\nThe first few paragraphs already gave you a overview of what I am going on about. Lets start with a bit of a rewind.\n\n[Zed.Run](https://stockhead.com.au/cryptocurrency/zed-run-racehorses-selling-for-six-figures-sydney-startup-gets-27m-in-funding-as-crypto-powered-gaming-takes-off/) features horses in neon harnesses that exist as tradeable nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on **Polygon**, the \\*\\*Ethereum \\*\\*sidechain, and compete against one another in virtual races. Zed.Run **[racehorses have sold for as much as US$125,000](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/digital-race-horse-crypto-asset-mania-nft-zed-run-2021-4)** in **Ethereum**, with about $43 million in total sales\n\nHow does it work?\n\nFirst you buy a virtual horse with prices in the range of $250 - $1200. (prices represented in dollars - but you would need Ethereum to actually buy the horses)\n\nOwning a horse then lets players pay $5 to $25 or so as an **[entry fee for a race](https://zed.run/racing/events)**, where they have the chance to split a 95 per cent of a pot of around $200 or so. Nearly US$10 million has been won.\n\nWinners are determined by each racehorse’s unique assets and racetrack conditions. So there’s skill involved in learning about the horse and being tactical about what races to enter.\n\nWhat’s the[ vision](https://community.zed.run/2021/07/21/off-to-the-races-virtually-human-studio-secures-20m-usd-series-a-round-from-tcg-and-andreesen-horowitz/)?\n\n> *“Our vision for the future is to build a creator economy within the ZED RUN metaverse where players can work in professions such as stable owner, race track owner, breeder, accessory designer and more. We are also working to partner closely with brands to produce immersive sponsorship experiences, such as our recent collaborations with The Preakness, Stella Artois and Atari”*\n>\n> *Chris Laurent, CEO at Virtually Human Studio*\n\nWhat’s the potential?\n\nCurrently there are about 100-200 horseraces per day globally.\n\nBut unlike the real-life counterparts - Zed Run’s racehorses are not bound by limitations of the physical world.\n\nThey already do 1,600 races per day!\n\nAnd Mike Tyson has bought one\n\nAnother example is a game called **Axie Infinity**\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22292803-9e0b-4bb7-9910-41163980a5e4_1600x820.png)\n\nSource: Sky Mavis\n\nAxie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets (called Axies).\n\nThe interesting thing about both these games is their different business model\n\nMost of the modern successful games like Fortnite, Pokemon Go, PubG are Free-to-play games. In other words the game makers give the full game to players for free and **make money by selling virtual in-game items** like skins and emotes. But the players have no income stream from the games.\n\nBlockchain games like Zed and Axie operate on Play to Earn model.\n\nHere’s a paragraph from Axie [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/)\n\n> *The key difference between Axie and a traditional game is that Blockchain economic design is used to reward our players for their contributions to the ecosystem. This new model of gaming has been dubbed \"play to earn\".*\n\nSo unlike a traditional game there is an upfront investment in blockchain games. But while in a traditional game you essentially rent the avatar or skin - in the blockchain game like Zed or Axie - you own the horse or Axie - which can be traded / sold for Eth.\n\n> *Axie has attracted thousands of players from developing countries in the pursuit of a new income stream during the Covid pandemic. Many of these players are fathers, aunts, and even grandparents who have never used Blockchain technology before!*\n\nThese games are creating new jobs / employment opportunities for people - and that’s mindblowing!\n\n**3) Ethereum Name Service (ENS)**\n\nThe third application is ENS.\n\nBefore you delve into ENS. Its worth revising what is DNS or Domain Name System.\n\n> *The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to [IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/) so browsers can load Internet resources.*\n\nSo instead of having to remember and type out IP addresses which look like 192.168.1.1, or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 - we simply type amazon.com\n\nNow this is what crypto wallet addresses look like “0x3Cc52a6E7238cd13ab34dc86B7B18d2a8778DA1Z”.\n\nYou see where this is going?\n\nGoing to borrow from [Villa Staylight](https://draecomino.substack.com/p/five-genuinely-useful-things-crypto)\n\n> *[Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/) (ENS) makes crypto addresses human readable. Just as DNS converts internet IP addresses into web addresses, ENS converts 64 character crypto addresses to readable addresses ending with “.eth”*\n\nJust as you can register on Gmail and get an email id which is a universal identifier, simple to use and share with anyone. You can register for a id on the ENS\n\nWhy would you want to do that?\n\n> *Let’s say you’re Bryan Smith. You are a content creator with a global following. How do you receive money? You could have a Patreon, but that’s only for recurring payments. You could include your PayPal for tipping. But PayPal is not a global standard. Unlike universal protocols like email, payment apps are fragmented by geography. In the US people use PayPal, Venmo, and Square Cash. In China it’s AliPay and WeChat Pay. In Latin America it’s Samsung Pay and Mercado Pago. Almost none of these services are interoperable.*\n>\n> *Just as you can register bryan.smith@mail.com and get on one universal email standard, you can register bryansmith.eth and get on one universal internet money standard. By including bryansmith.eth on his website and business card, you can receive bitcoin, ethereum, and other crypto currencies from anyone in the world. A transfer costs less than $1 using Litecoin and settles in minutes.*\n>\n> ***ENS makes crypto addresses memorable and readable. It makes internet money transmission as universal and dependable as email.***\n\nGuess who has got one already :)\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d6fdf48-9702-45a5-a304-8faf14e73c75_1269x589.png)\n\nSo the id also doubles up as a NFT which can be traded.\n\nAnd I am not alone\n\n> \n\nSo these first three applications i.e. NFTs, Gaming and ENS are primarily driven by the scarcity creation quality of Ethereum. These three applications are also much easier to grasp and adopt by the broader consumer group as compared to the next two.\n\nFrom here on its the programmability / smart contract characteristic of Ethereum which results in creation of the app ecosystem.\n\n**4) Decentralised Automonous Organisations (DAO)**\n\nWhat is a DAO?\n\nHere is a summary from [Packy Mccormick](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-dao-of-daos-5b9)\n\n> \\*A DAO is “decentralized” in that it runs on a blockchain and gives decision-making power to stakeholders instead of executives or board members, and “autonomous” in that it uses smart contracts, which are essentially applications or programs that run on a publicly accessible blockchain and trigger an action if certain conditions are met, without the need for human intervention. \\*\n\nA good example is an entity called Maker DAO - which is often referred as the reserve bank of the DeFi world.\n\nMaker DAO operates using a stablecoin called DAI.\n\nA stablecoin is a currency pegged to other assets. In most cases the other asset is the US dollar.\n\nSo basically 1 Dai = 1 USD\n\nMatt Levine explains the basic premise\n\n> *Here is the basic story of stablecoins. It is very useful, for people who trade crypto, to have a cryptocurrency worth $1. In many respects you live your life denominated in dollars, so you want a supply of dollars (as opposed to volatile assets like Bitcoin, etc.). But in many other respects you live your life on the blockchain, so you want your money to be on the blockchain (as opposed to in a bank account in the U.S. payments system). A cryptocurrency worth a dollar solves both these problems: It is worth a dollar, but it can be traded on the blockchain, transferred between crypto exchanges, held in a crypto wallet, and generally used as a cryptocurrency without interacting with the U.S. banking system.*\n\nOkay okay, so how does this Bank work?\n\n> \\*An investor comes into Maker DAO for a loan. He (yep, usually he) has some collateral he’s happy to keep locked in a vault. Right now, that collateral is usually a crypto asset like Ethereum. For every $100 worth of crypto assets, Maker is typically prepared to lend $66 – the gap adding a buffer of protection against a possible fall in the value of the collateral. Maker accepts the collateral and advances a loan, which it does by issuing its Dai money. \\*\n\nSo you give Maker DAO $100 worth of ETH as collateral and walk away with $66 in DAI.\n\nAnd remember 1 Dai = 1 USD.\n\nMaker DAO charges the borrower a interest. Its called a ‘Stability fee’.\n\nYou could also simply deposit your ETH in Maker DAO and get paid a ‘Dai Savings Rate’\n\nAll sounds very familiar?\n\nHere’s where it gets interesting. Remember that Maker DAO has very low operating costs. So most of the revenue flows through to operating profit.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc33aa67c-cc10-468e-9ffe-49ce96c70f37_547x566.png)\n\nThis means that the protocols are capable of offering high rates to depositors - much higher than traditional banks.\n\nFinally, lets not forget that it is a DAO.\n\nThe “shareholders” of the DAO are basically the holders of a token called MKR.\n\n> *Profits are returned to holders via a buyback mechanism. Rather than being reinvested back in the business or returned to owners via dividend, surplus profits are used to buy MKR tokens in the market, which are then cancelled*\n\nOf course, a DAO can be created with any specific purpose. The above example related to a bank.\n\nFinally we come to the umbrella term - DeFi\n\n**5) Decentralised Finance (DeFi)**\n\nOkay, so what is DeFi?\n\nDecentralised finance (or DeFi) is an emerging ecosystem of applications seeking to rebuild financial services from the ground up. Easy!\n\nYou must be thinking - why fix something which works. Well here are a few drawbacks of centralised financial systems from [Marc Rubenstein](https://www.netinterest.co/p/my-adventures-in-cryptoland)\n\n> * *The system limits access. Around 1.7 billion people around the world remain unbanked; they don’t have access to the financial system.*\n> * *The system can be expensive, partly because of the legacy infrastructure it’s built on; remittance fees of 5-7% for example seem high when information can be moved around the world much more cheaply.*\n> * \\*There’s a lack of interoperability between financial institutions globally. Many fintech companies have emerged to solve this problem – companies like Plaid, which allows customers to transfer financial information between providers; and dLocal, which allows multinational companies to take payment from customers in emerging markets using their own niche payment systems. \\*\n\nHere’s a snapshot of the DeFi landscape\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F379980ac-d855-4a82-ac46-d33099501232_562x301.png)\n\nThe column on left broadly covers the key areas of operation.

It’s more important than ever to have a basic idea of how it works — especially as newer technologies are quickly emerging today.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2KD-vNbSx7rcxa87AdiDJw.png)\n\n*I’m going to oversimplify some things. My goal is for you to pick this up, read it, and **walk away with enough understanding to explain it to someone else in 30 seconds.***\n\nI’ve been focused on the music industry for about twenty years and have a lot of opinions about it. I’m leaving those out here. This is intended to be objective and informative.\n\n## It starts with two questions:\n\n***1. Who is paid?*** ➡ **Rightsholders**. This can be a musician/artist, a songwriter (who may not be the artist), a record label, or a number of other entities. Or some combination.\n\n***2. How much do they get paid?*** ➡ Rightsholders are \\***not\\* paid a flat rate per play, listen, or stream of a song.** They are paid based on **streamshare**. I’ll elaborate on this more.\n\n**Streamshare** is pretty simple on the surface: the more streams a song gets — *proportionally* to all other songs in the same time period — the larger the share of revenue the rightsholder of that music receives.\n\n👉 ***Here’s an analogy***: think of a giant all-you-can-eat food buffet at a restaurant. Each musician has contributed various dishes of food to the buffet. Each song is a different dish of food that’s available, sitting on the buffet table, ready to be consumed.\n\nEvery month, a different number of people pay to eat at the buffet, so a different amount of money is made from buffet-access sales each month.\n\nHowever, some food is very popular. Some isn’t eaten at all. People eat some dishes *a lot* more than others. Contributors of the popular foods are proportionally paid a larger share of the proceeds from the pool of buffet earnings. **This is streamshare.**\n\n**It’s all you can eat, and what (and how much) you eat determines how much each rightsholder gets paid from the earnings for the right to access the buffet.**\n\n\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~\n\n## The Details: Rightsholders\n\n> * *“How do I become a rightsholder?”*\n> * *“Why aren’t artists always rightsholders?”*\n\nThere are a few factors to consider.\n\n### Copyrights:\n\nWhen you think of a song, there are **two copyrights**. One is the **composition** (the notes, melodies, lyrics, etc that make up a song). A composition is created — but not necessarily owned — by a songwriter.\n\nThe other is the sound **recording** (the actual recorded version of a composition). A recording is performed — but not necessarily owned — by an artist/musician.\n\n👉 ***For example***: you record yourself playing your favorite cover song on GarageBand. You own the recording copyright of that version, but you don’t own the composition.\n\n### Loans for recording music:\n\n*Often, artists need money to record music. \\\\n Often, a record label gives them that money as a loan.*\n\nIt’s generally a loan with bad terms for the artist because it’s high risk for a label (9/10 artists never make back the money; essentially defaulting on their loan, and the label loses money on their investment). You may also hear the word “advance.”\n\n✅ **Recording** copyright\n\n👉 ***An example***: this loan has some similarities to a bank loan (mortgage) to buy a house. If a person has a low credit score, they will have to pay a higher interest rate (a less favorable deal for the homebuyer). This is justified by the bank because the risk of not being paid back is higher (in theory). A higher credit score = a lower interest rate for a loan. Similarly, a popular artist will have better leverage for better recording deal terms because they are seen as a less risky investment.\n\n### Then there’s the composition copyright…\n\n…which is also called publishing or songwriter side. The publisher (sometimes a subsidiary of a label) can also become the rightsholder and get royalties here too, especially until it is “recouped” and a loan is paid back. Publishing can get really complicated.\n\nRegardless of the actual numbers here, let’s assume the payouts are pretty low and unfavorable to the creator. The terms and conditions can also be convoluted and very confusing.\n\nFor the purpose of understanding basic streaming payouts this is good enough, but just know I’ve particularly oversimplified this aspect. Here’s a good resource if you want to [learn more](https://soundcharts.com/blog/how-the-music-publishing-works).\n\n✅ **Composition** copyright\n\n### It gets even more complicated (and we’re skipping it):\n\nThere are a variety of other copyright collections and payments for rightsholders involved with music. We’re skipping them today. Broadly speaking, let’s just assume a musician who enters a traditional recording and publishing deal will see about 10% of the money both copyrights from their song generates. These aren’t exact terms, and they vary a lot, but this is a fair example conceptually. Here’s Spotify’s rundown of it if you want to [learn more](https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/).\n\n**🤘 You now understand basic intellectual property rights in the music industry.**\n\n## **Put all of this knowledge into bucket #1…we’ll connect it all together in a moment.**\n\nNow, in bucket #2, we have Spotify. They bring in billions of $’s a year in revenue from ads and subscription fees. After deducting some taxes, card fees, etc, they claim ***they pay out \\~67% of all revenue money to \\*rightsholders.\\****\n\n### Wtf is a rightsholder in this context?\n\nA rightsholder is whoever owns & controls the **composition** and **recording copyrights**. This might be an artist, label, publisher, or likely, a combo of these parties.\n\nThe music biz has done a TERRIBLE job adapting to the digital world here. It’s not really anyone’s fault specifically. It’s kind of like trying to build the most advanced city skyscraper on top of a foundation constructed for a rural log cabin built in the early 1800’s. **It works for a while; but the original structure was never intended for its contemporary purpose.**\n\n(As an aside, this is one of the reasons why I think there’s so much potential for smart contracts in the blockchain and distributed ledger space).\n\n👉 ***Example***: So, in the case of bucket #1, 67% of revenue goes to the label/pub… and then the artist might get, say, 10%. If Spotify gets $1.00 in revenue, $0.67 goes to the rightsholder (label/pub), then the artist gets $0.067…\n\n> ***One dollar ➡ 67 cents ➡ 6.7 cents.***\n\n**The artist gets paid almost nothing, but it’s not really Spotify’s fault (simplified).**\n\n**However**, say I’m the artist “Henry” and I write and record my own song and upload it to Spotify. I get my share of that entire 67% (minus some marginal collection fees). If Spotify netted $1.00, $0.67 goes to me as the rightsholder (and artist).\n\n**This is why it’s so important for us to work together so artists have alternative options for funding — and so that they have more *choices* about who the rightsholders of their music are.**\n\nThere absolutely are situations where working with a label could be the best option for an artist to choose, *and* it should also be exactly that, a *choice*.\n\n\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~\n\n# The Details: Streamshare\n\nThere is a second major caveat to streaming payments: **streamshare**. This is the dreaded “Spotify only pays $0.003 fraction of a penny per play.”\n\nThe issue is: *they don’t pay per play*. **Here’s how they calculate it…**\n\n👉 ***Example***: Spotify nets $100 revenue in March. \\~$67 would be paid to the rightsholders of the music that was streamed. Say “Drake” got 60 listens and “Henry” got 7 listens (and no other songs are listened to). “Drake” would get $60 and “Henry” would get $7.\n\nNext month, maybe Spotify nets $200 revenue because you and a few of your friends bought some new monthly Premium subscriptions. But “Drake” still gets 60 listens and “Henry” gets 7. Now, “Drake” and “Henry” **both make twice as much money, even though listenership remained the same**.\n\n> **⚠pay per listen ≠ streamshare⚠**\n\n\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~\n\n# Key takeaways\n\n* The music streaming payments system is still too opaque.\n* Artists don’t get paid by streaming services; the rightsholder do.\n* Two copyrights for a song: composition and sound recording.\n* Streaming doesn’t pay rightsholders per play; they pay per proportional plays to other streamed music. This is called streamshare.\n* The common argument is for streaming services to pay artists more. An alternative argument could be that streaming services need to generate more revenue, which means there is more money to split.\n* Low artist payments are primarily a mechanism of current recording deal structures and contemporary copyright ownership models.\n\nAs you can see, it can get complicated with millions of artists and rightsholders. I’m not for-or-against Spotify, labels, or any nascent technologies, such as Audius or Opulous.\n\nI just want a better ecosystem for artists to grow and thrive. I’m rooting for everyone who is working towards building a better future for musicians and their communities, and my hope is we can get there together.\n\nHave ideas about how we can do that?

This is the dreaded “Spotify only pays $0.003 fraction of a penny per play.”\n\nThe issue is: *they don’t pay per play*. **Here’s how they calculate it…**\n\n👉 ***Example***: Spotify nets $100 revenue in March. \\~$67 would be paid to the rightsholders of the music that was streamed. Say “Drake” got 60 listens and “Henry” got 7 listens (and no other songs are listened to). “Drake” would get $60 and “Henry” would get $7.\n\nNext month, maybe Spotify nets $200 revenue because you and a few of your friends bought some new monthly Premium subscriptions. But “Drake” still gets 60 listens and “Henry” gets 7. Now, “Drake” and “Henry” **both make twice as much money, even though listenership remained the same**.\n\n> **⚠pay per listen ≠ streamshare⚠**\n\n\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~\n\n# Key takeaways\n\n* The music streaming payments system is still too opaque.\n* Artists don’t get paid by streaming services; the rightsholder do.\n* Two copyrights for a song: composition and sound recording.\n* Streaming doesn’t pay rightsholders per play; they pay per proportional plays to other streamed music. This is called streamshare.\n* The common argument is for streaming services to pay artists more. An alternative argument could be that streaming services need to generate more revenue, which means there is more money to split.\n* Low artist payments are primarily a mechanism of current recording deal structures and contemporary copyright ownership models.\n\nAs you can see, it can get complicated with millions of artists and rightsholders. I’m not for-or-against Spotify, labels, or any nascent technologies, such as Audius or Opulous.\n\nI just want a better ecosystem for artists to grow and thrive. I’m rooting for everyone who is working towards building a better future for musicians and their communities, and my hope is we can get there together.\n\nHave ideas about how we can do that?

Being part of a tribe meant food and shelter. This means your main goal was to stay part of the tribe forever; otherwise...\n\nThanks to innovation, this is no longer true. People started to travel by boat, train, car, and later airplane and learned that the world was bigger than they thought. Humans started to learn more about different regions and cultures.\n\nToday you don't even have to travel anymore; we have the internet. The internet makes it easy to learn about different people, cultures, and ideas.\n\nIn this way, the location you grow up in becomes less and less critical. People become more independent.\n\nToday, people still want to be part of communities, but something that did change is that we now have more freedom (and possibilities) to choose which community to join. And if you don't like a particular community, you can easily move on.\n\nRemote work accelerated this, and it clearly shows that remote work is here to stay, [even for the old dinosaurs](https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-pwc-tells-us-employees-they-need-never-return-office-2021-09-30/?utm_campaign=moment&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).\n\nThe question is, what will we do with this freedom? With great power comes [great responsibility](https://www.notboring.co/p/existential-optimism).\n\nAnother reason that people become more individualistic is that we start to lose our confidence in large institutions.\n\nWhile all of this is happening, we face many obstacles, and for some, we're running out of time.\n\nThe way out? Innovation.\n\nThe first step is to (re)organize ourselves; this will play a massive role in all of this. Innovation happens by optimistic individuals coming together. Not to work, but to create.\n\nThat's why I'm super excited with web3, where people turn work into play.\n\n[Web3](https://creatoreconomy.so/p/curious-beginner-guide-to-crypto) is completely different than web2, where the flippening of everything accelerated.\n\n> **Crypto has one feature that has never existed before - trust.** - Ben Horowitz\n\nYou can clearly see this happening in the art market; a new generation is now buying art in the form of NFTs. What will happen with the physical art market? This will probably become less valuable, and what will happen with more people creating art? I don't know... it's only the beginning, and at this moment, we stand too close to connect the dots. But the new dots are in development.\n\nNFTs are a way to verify ownership. Well, that's important and broken in many other industries. How will they adopt to this new technology? Musicians, mortgages, contracts, diplomas, and the list continues.\n\nIt's all up to us.\n\nWe are the generation with the most freedom any generation experienced. Now what?\n\nOne thing is for sure; the questions matter; those create the way.\n\nSo, where do you want to go?", "timestamp": 1633512030, "digest": "tNFDdbIY_gg7X8LM9SYOHusvwI4slmk9iWJqFB3hLKc", "contributor": "0x89Fb4B54572d8ED255C74f9eCb66973569813603"}

{"id": "kn9Ab5qtZH2-6k3bKVTJKl8Dt85qXruaAcXeIBCo8TQ", "title": "Trust and Learning in the Times of the Metaverse", "body": "In 1996, my local library held an event with the presence of the town's mayor, in order to announce they were installing dial-up connections through a partnership with a local company. I was 11 years old and very lucky to have this kind of Internet connection at home, but I knew that enabling more people to go online was a big deal, which would make my experience more relevant.\n\nAs an avid reader, I thought, it is great that these grown ups with a catalog of books and other materials can get in on the web as well. My guess was that this can only expand the amount of resources, people and ideas that I can reach through search engines. I remember thinking back then, if the Internet would be a book, it would be quite a short one. There wasn't a lot of content.\n\nSo I chose to stay positive, even if a little part of me felt invaded by adults, as web browsing was until then a rebellious act against the powers that be. Keep in mind that anyone over 30 years old would not really understand what the Internet was about.\n\nBack then, I knew the web was about to change the minute that traditional institutions and companies got the hang of it. I had to trust that even if they were about to bring a horrible and humongous amount of advertisements with them- we'd still be ok with our online experience. It could still be about finding content and building things with it.\n\nThis helped me learn that in order to enable and facilitate learning, one must build a fabric of trust around experiences, whether online or offline. And establishing this trust is very difficult with the technologies of the web as we knew it. But there is change on the horizon.\n\n![](https://assets.website-files.com/603cd80fe815e829f381b524/61544cfbed2ec23ce20974f7\\_gaming.jpg)\n\nGaming, learning and sharing experiences are all intertwined nowadays, so trust and transparency become key factors.\n\nPeople are nowadays using words like \"metaverse\" and \"web3\" to describe technologies and processes that enable people to connect and exchange value. Most likely, these experiences are marked by a decentralized method of keeping the score, or ledger, so that all members of a community are able to trust the activity around them.\n\n> Working on the web3 in 2021 feels a lot like coding websites did in 1996: it often results in looking at your screen wondering about one problem for too long, because you are in uncharted territory, and there are no quick fixes to what you want to accomplish.\n\nIt is precisely in that journey of acknowledging the gap between where we are, and where we want to be, that we realized we needed the concept of a virtual library. A place for common good, unburdened by the commercial pressures of what the main product, Wayports, should become.\n\nThis is what The MacLane Library has to be, with an agnostic view on the type of virtual world, its mission is to create more value for its members. So it made total sense to us to spin The MacLane Library (MCL) off into its own Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).\n\nAs of today, the MCL is a DAO, and this means you can acquire the MCL token and be a direct owner of the organization. As an owner/holder of the token, you are part of our governance model, which means you can make proposals or submit a challenge to a decision you might not agree with. In this case your challenge will go through an entire on-chain court system where other members can vote to take action together with you.\n\n![](https://assets.website-files.com/603cd80fe815e829f381b524/61544d947c13f979475db4de\\_611a534afe237ef170150867\\_c.jpg)\n\n[Source: Aragon Govern, the DAO framework we use for The MacLane Library.](https://aragon.org/aragon-govern)\n\nAs we grow and evolve, the idea is that our members can take The MacLane Library in the direction that they see fit. Our vision is to have a networked virtual library with no frontiers, where members able to connect, learn and obtain rewards for their contributions. Thanks to being a DAO, everything is transparent and auditable, on-chain for members to see.\n\nJust like in 1996, we have to embrace the change that results from mixing in crowds with different objectives and preferences, this time around we have the tools to facilitate decision making in a transparent way. Intent was a lot harder to predict in the 90's, and if you think about it, the new era is all about taking people further by removing old structures that would otherwise put up a wall between intent and value.\n\nWe hope compensation can always meet actions for the impact these have generated in our community. This is a significant mark of a web3 experience, since creation of content is so accessible yet the economies of the web2 aren't there to support creators, and make careers out of all that talent. We think of this as a great effort to meet that moment. It makes sense that we would want to enable those experiences in several different places or subsets of virtual communities, to go where people play and learn, and I can't wait to see what we'll build together.\n\n‍\n", "timestamp": 1633513547, "digest": "_qdLUW8ni_5YohXEMgJV5jK-R3AkAJw5sQF1MoOqlIY", "contributor": "0x93c8b165a6A097c8B8bB4bF2a59E185b3af5b08d"}

{"id": "aA2gidd68bh47INmZK3_8P_R4izCQJaLjBuTuyfYZ4I", "title": "How motivation helps in achieving goals", "body": "Motivation is the desire to achieve a goal or a certain level of performance. Environmental factors such as having the resources, information, and support one needs to perform well are critical to determining the performance. Let's take the example of early-stage startups. The founder was working with a tech giant in silicon, and he had a great idea of starting lossless compression software and services. The CEO of the company offered millions to buy his plan, but he declined the offer. His co-workers, managers, and others suggested that he keep working on the idea, and he had all the necessary resources and environment. One of the company's vice presidents joined him for management & consulting, and then he resigned to pursue his startup idea. The context here was his co-workers, office resources, and silicon valley culture to make this world a better place than motivated him to pursue his vision. \\n \n\nMotivation gives rise to thinking and cognition, and the mind starts to process the information in a precise fashion. The environment has a significant impact on how data is processed. Continuing the example from the previous part, the founder started searching for different products and services to offer to companies and the public. After processing all the feedbacks and surveys, he launched a 4K video streaming platform. The beta platform was a massive hit as it provided a glitch-free video streaming experience. The environment here rose fad towards high definition video streaming and algorithm implementation that worked with all limited resources to build a beta platform.\n\nThe judgment phase starts after proper motivation to achieve something, and successful information search and processing paves the way to resolution. A kind environment supports the process of understanding, whereas a hostile environment sometimes pushes a person or an organization back to information search and processing. In the case of this startup, after the completion of beta testing, they wanted to diversify and launch more products, many investors came forward to support and help them in establishing new services, so this environment massively impacted their decision to launch a variety of products and services including cryptocurrency platform, online gaming services, etc.\n\nDecision-making is a sort of actionable judgment. In the case of an organization, individuals work together to achieve favorable outcomes. The environment with recognition, empowerment, technical competence, employee participation, organizational commitment, and a sense of belonging always thrives with effective decision making. In the case of my example, the startup founder always focused on team effort to make decisions. After deliberating with all employees, he decided to start with the new internet and a storage device.\n\nThe cycle of motivation to judgment ends at decision making, and the consequence of all these sorts determines behavior. The environment in this behavioral sense is of two types kind and wicked. If a person gets treated equally and has a sense of doing something good for the organization or personal level, wickedness is just the opposite. In my example, one of the employees was doing well in the workplace and, in his life, came up with the idea of launching a smartphone and startup launched with the new internet.\n\nThe environment has a significant impact on feedback. We can ask questions about feedback when we have a supportive and kind atmosphere, and feedback is necessary in either case, i.e., individual and organizational level. So taking the startup's example, they received feedback from every employee and improved software and other services. The cardless and secure payment system was revamped after input from the user group.\n\nEmotions are also helpful for creative tasks because positive individuals tend to be more creative and open to new ideas. With a kind environment, we can have more people with positive emotions. The startup is revolutionizing the world, and the employees of the company and people have a positive feeling attached to this company. It's the core idea, products, and services.", "timestamp": 1633514133, "digest": "doRCZq5s3YA0eziIM1mUiXuLbX12YZ1c0PaH-G-XWCw", "contributor": "0x6be37Df0A4543fb26b274E96aC4d0E5CE49C1078"}

{"id": "bmNX-zbZm_q4gT1zjPM7-sZ2MfIDU2i276yZ80DV55Q", "title": "Why I've Changed My Mind on NFTs", "body": "I recently read an article with the headline “Why I’ve Changed My Mind on Bitcoin” which inspired me to write a short article about NFTs in general.\n\nIn my friend circle, I’m known for my abilities to ELI5 (Explain Like I’m 5 \\[…years old\\]) complex technical topics, especially around Blockchain and Cryptocurrency topics. I have a long background in writing, publishing, community and company management and IT product development and engineering management. In short: I always put myself in a position where i had to talk (and write) which I’m still enjoy doing nowadays. With the discovery of mirror.xyz, I thought i spend a couple of minutes to write a few sentences here and see where it goes.\n\nI recently bought my first NFT, a Creature, after I saw the Winklevoss Twins buying one themselves, so I just Ape’d in. \n\n[https://opensea.io/assets/0xc92ceddfb8dd984a89fb494c376f9a48b999aafc/743](https://opensea.io/assets/0xc92ceddfb8dd984a89fb494c376f9a48b999aafc/743)\n\nThe purchase made me part of a community of NFT enthusiasts, and I must say, it is fun to be part of (the Discord Channels, Twitter Buzz and Digital Art Collectors). But this is not what I want to write about. I want to write about NFTs.\n\nSince a couple of month I am planning to publish a new video of my YouTube Explain Crypto Series about NFTs. I even wrote the script already, which I was going to use when I film myself with one of these Teleprompter Apps for the Smartphone (I enjoy speaking freely, but I also enjoy to write, the combination of writing an article and speaking it into the camera is something that I enjoy. A big advantage are also the auto-subtitles and the translation of transcript with a few clicks in multiple languages). Before it gets lost, I publish it here, now.\n\nThe letters NFT mean non-fungible token. The definition of fungible is, if you can exchange something for the the same thing. Example are dollar bills, or Bitcoin. If I send you one Bitcoin and you send me one Bitcoin, both Bitcoin are exactly the same. My Bitcoin is not different from your Bitcoin, meaning, Bitcoin is fungible. The same counts for any other currency, I can exchange every euro for another euro. My one euro is the same as your one euro. \n\nNon-fungible is everything that is unique. If you own a painting and I own painting, they differ from each other. We could exchange them, but they are not the same. There is no second exact same painting, this is why paintings are non-fungible. \n\nA non-fungible token, or NFT, in most cases represents a certificate for something non-fungible, for example an artwork, a music track, or a poem, or patent. \n\nIn the non digital world, collecting unique items have a humanity long history. Humans always collected unique physical items such as shells, first edition prints of books, handwritten letters, stamps, jewellery, precious stones or watches. It is easy to understand that items that are scarce (they can be unique or only a limited number of pieces exist) often become a valuable item for collectors. We see this in Oldtimer car, and fashion items. Some items become so valuable, that people start to create copies, counterfeit them. Experts and chemists analyse historical paintings, compare signatures and handwritings or hand out certificates with serial numbers and histories of owners, to preserve their value and to proof their authenticity. \n\nBut in the digital world, everything could easily be copied. Every copy of a photo, a video, a written text or an audio file is absolutely identical to the original. Every data is fungible. With one click of a button I can create hundreds or thousands of copies. Digital items could not be unique and scarce, until Bitcoin and Blockchain appeared. \n\nThe Blockchain made Bitcoin possible. The idea is simple. A digital register that can’t be changed. You can add information (data), but you can not delete or edit previously added entries. An immutable ledger. Every data that gets added is also time stamped, meaning, that you basically know that your data has been added at a certain moment in time. You can see that data has been added before, and after you. Think about adding data like writing in a physical notebook: first page, followed by second page, then third page, and so on. If you fill page by page, you get a chronology where page one has been filled with data (or writing) before page two. Page one is earlier in time. Before computers, especially in accounting and saving accounts at banks, you would always keep a historical ledger of all your transactions with all records in chronological order. \n\nA good example is also the ownership of property. Or today’s car register. You will see a history of previous owners, starting from the first one until the current one, every owner listed one by one in chronological order. \n\nWith Blockchain you can now do the same, but digital. You can make an entry into a digital ledger, that can not be deleted or edited. This entry can contain any information. To simplify NFT, that information can contain a digital item and a owner and naturally a timestamp, which is the date and time it has been added to the Blockchain. Now, even if there are millions of copies of that digital item, I could still point at the Blockchain register and show that I am the first (and currently only) owner of that digital item. You could have a copy of it on your computer, but you are not the owner. If you want to become the owner of that digital item though, you could ask me (the person who first registered that item in the Blockchain) to transfer the ownership to you. If I agree to pass the ownership of my digital item to you, i would need to update the information in the Blockchain. As it is not possible to edit or delete the entry, I would add another entry which will state that the ownership of that digital item has been transferred to a new owner. That entry will appear after my first entry in time and would display you as the new owner. Now we have an immutable history of ownership, first me, than you, and now you can proof to everyone that you’re the legitimate owner of that digital item. You can decide to keep it in your collection forever, or pass the ownership again one day to someone else. \n\nWith this simple technology every registered digital item becomes a collectible, it has a owner, a timestamp, and can be transferred, auctioned or traded on an open market. \n\nSo why is it called NFT? NFT is actually called ERC-721 and is an open standard on how to register digital items on the Ethereum Blockchain. It has been designed in a way that every registered item follows the same structure.  Standards are important for ecosystems to grow. If credit and debit cards would not be standardised, they would not fit into the ATM machines. If paper sizes would not be standardised, they would not fit into your printer. If power plugs and usb cables would not be standardised, you couldn’t charge your phone or plug it into your laptop. \n\nNFT or ERC-721 is nothing else than a standard to register digital items in the Blockchain. With the rise of NFT, a whole ecosystem is currently arriving around it. Digital items can now be displayed in many digital wallets. Websites and apps provide easy interfaces to register (add) new digital items to the Blockchain. With a few clicks you can transfer the ownership of a digital item to someone else. \n\nIf you are an inventor in the physical world and developed something unique and special that you think it’s worth patenting, you register a patent, in your country, or even world wide patents. You do that to protect your invention or brand, and to proof that you’ve been the first person that came up with it (and therefore the owner of the patent). You can also sell your patent. If you do that, you usually go to the parent office again and register that there is a new owner of the patent now - simple as that. \n\nBlockchain can easily be such a register. It is immutable, decentralized and entries made can never disappear. \n\nIn the movement of NFTs digital creators have identified that potential and the ability, first time in human history, to globally agree on a standard to register digital items and make them easily tradable. If you are a creator yourself, you can, at any time, register your digital item on the Blockchain. As Blockchain is a public, permission less and decentralised network, you don’t need to ask anyone for permission. You can’t be denied from registering your work and no one can delete or edit your entry once it is inside the Blockchain. \n\nAt any time in history you can undoubtedly proof that you are the owner (or the creator who first registered the digital item) of that digital item. You can proof the age, or better said the date it has been registered, and you can pass it to new owners that might pass it along for eternity. The first time in history of the planet there is a register that can exist forever (for all time into the future) that holds information about the time of creation, creator and owner, for any digital item you could think of. An NFT can be an book, a song, a photograph, a painting, a video or any other type of data. \n\nThe future of digital collectors has arrived. Start becoming a collector, or creator, or both.  \n\n References:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/eminmahrt](https://www.youtube.com/c/eminmahrt)\n\n[https://www.creature.world/](https://www.creature.world/)\n\n[https://ofdollarsanddata.com/why-ive-changed-my-mind-on-bitcoin/](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/why-ive-changed-my-mind-on-bitcoin/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633511512, "digest": "lxyU0hlESdFymH7QTmu6ppVWjeH8V_5d1o76klykIxQ", "contributor": "0x8a6652F330B79c3a31621114486E57AB3f41B410"}

{"id": "Qqsov8HaKyY0rOJ2HWSHpdaR4yFoqiXo7gC9_Rq2zmQ", "title": "The Rise of Profile Picture NFTs", "body": "Have you seen these pictures lately on your social media feeds? ![](https://julian.so/pfp-nfts/nfts.jpeg)\n\nIf you've seen them then you probably already know or heard about NFTs. NFTs are one of the hottest topics that are being discussed these days. People are spending millions of dollars on it and many are still skeptical. The biggest argument is that you can right click and save it instantly. There are many kinds of NFTs, but there is one kind of NFT that caught my attention which is the profile picture / avatar NFTs project. This essay will cover my thoughts about this kind of NFT and why they matter.\n\n***\n\n## What is an NFT?\n\n> NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. - ethereum.org\n\nNFT (Non Fungible Token) enables us to tokenize art, collectibles, and many more. It's impossible to modify the record of ownership of NFT. This thing is called non fungible because it's not interchangeable because of their unique properties.\n\n> NFTs and Ethereum solve some of the problems that exist on the internet today. As everything becomes more digital, there's a need to replicate the properties of physical items like scarcity, uniqueness, and proof of ownership. - ethereum.org\n\nThis is a huge thing for collectible art since you can easily prove your ownership of your art and even if someone tries to copy / forge a fake, people will know.\n\nNFT also allows the creator to set the scarcity of the collectibles. This is of course the main thing about collectibles, you want to collect rare stuff.\n\nBeside all the points I've mentioned, NFT powers the creator economy since everyone can mint or create NFTs. You can easily upload your art to Open Sea now by having an ETH wallet and some ETH to pay for gas fee. (more on gas fees [here](https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/what-is-a-gas-fee-on-ethereum/)). It’s never been easier to sell your art.\n\n## What is profile picture / avatar NFTs?\n\nThis kind of NFTs are projects that release an avatar image that can be used as profile picture.\n\n> NFT avatars are images of a character, usually from the shoulders up, frequently used as digital profile pictures. - The Defiant\n\nThese avatars are uniquely generated and have different traits. Some will have rare traits and some will look more common.\n\nThis kind of project not only offers you a jpeg that you can use but also it offers unique benefits for all owners. For example some of them will send you airdrop if you are the owner of the NFT project, some will offer you an access to a private space in the Metaverse, and there are many more.\n\nThe first avatar NFT project is called Crypto Punk. It was created by Larva Labs in 2017. These punks can be claimed for free back then as long as you have an Ethereum Wallet. Right now if you see on their official website (https\\://www\\.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) the highest sale of a punk is $7.57 Million dollars.\n\n![](https://julian.so/pfp-nfts/punk_sales.png)\n\nTop sales screenshot from larvalabs.com\n\n> The CryptoPunks are 10,000 uniquely generated characters. No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the Ethereum blockchain. - Larva Labs\n\nThe next wave started last April with the launch of Bored Ape Yacht Club. They released 10,000 apes with unique traits into the NFT space. The price was 0,08 ETH (around $200 at that time). It blew up and as I'm writing this (August 4, 2021) their lowest price is at 11.58 ETH (US $28925). And right now during the update (Sept 12th, 2021) of my essay their lowest price is 31 ETH ($106,190). They're 3x in a month.\n\n![](https://julian.so/pfp-nfts/curry.png)\n\nStephen Curry is using Bored Ape PFP on his Twitter.\n\n![](https://julian.so/pfp-nfts/bayc.png)\n\nScreenshot from BAYC website\n\nThe question you might ask is why do people want to spend that amount of money for a JPEG?\n\n### Community\n\nPeople are buying these NFTs because they want to be a part of the community. By being a part of the community you can gain many things for example a private channel on the discord server, access to merch drops, being able to participate in the next release, and many more.\n\nPeople love being in a community since we're social creatures. You can make new friends and meet a lot of interesting people inside it. Even by buying a Bored Ape you can gain many followers because people know that you belong in the community.\n\nA project will be nothing without a community behind it. A community can be their \"free marketing\" since people will share about the project without even asking for free from the team. The community keeps the discord server alive by welcoming new people and also helping them onboard.\n\nHumans love being in a tribe. They want to feel a sense of belonging. Being in a tribe means you have faith in one another, you can somehow “be yourself” and authentic, and also the success of a tribe does not depend on one person but it depends on the whole members.\n\n### Social Status\n\nThis is the point that I really love. People are buying NFTs for status signaling. By having a Crypto Punk you can signal that you can afford such a premium price for a JPEG and that you belong in the NFT community and you're up there with the elite.\n\nStatus signaling is one of the biggest motivations in the crypto space. From what I've observed during my time here in the NFT space, Avatars / PFP NFT Projects gain the most traction especially for new users. It's easier for them to choose the one they like and if they have the money they can join the big projects instead. Also, these kinds of NFTs are easier to show off since you can put it as your profile picture.\n\nFrom Eugene Wei's essay:\n\n> Status isn't worth much if there's no skill and effort required to mine it.\n\nOf course having a top tier PFP NFT project requires effort, you need to have the capital to buy one. Top tier NFT projects have a high bar to entry, not a lot of people can afford it and this is why buying a PFP NFT project is a great way to signal.\n\nIt used to be hard to signal in the digital space. It's of course easier to signal in the physical world since people can touch and see it. In the digital space everything doesn't seem real enough for people to notice. One of the biggest reasons I used to hate NFT is because you can easily right click and save those images and it's yours. It doesn't work that way. By right clicking and saving the image you might own the image but there's no proof that you really own it. NFT enables this proof of ownership.\n\n> Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Banking on Status - Julian Lehr\n\nNext thing that makes NFT grew so fast these couple of months is because the outer group (people outside of NFT) is huge since most people still don't know about NFT and the inner group (people inside the NFT space) is spreading the word every single day. Even celebrities are buying PFP NFTs to put as their social media profile picture. Because NFTs are designed to have limited supply, FOMO increases, thus driving prices.\n\n### Financial Gain\n\nOf course money is important when it comes to investing. A lot of people come to the NFT space not just to collect them, they are aiming to get a significant gain on the NFTs that they buy. There are many kinds of NFTs and it's hard to choose which one is good and which one is not. Art can be subjective and newer people tend not to look for another project beside PFP.\n\nThe entry points for this type of projects are relatively low (around 0,02 - 0,1 ETH) compares to Art Blocks or any other projects. This is the reason why people are getting into PFP projects, low barriers of entry and a high amount of gain. There's no better place right now to gain 10-100x besides NFTs. Sometimes it looks too good to be true but it's just the truth right now.\n\n### Pseudonymous Identity\n\n> Pseudonymous identities let you traverse the internet (and soon the metaverse) and create or find parts of yourself that cannot be discovered with a single identity. - https\\://shreyashariharan.com/2020/12/19/pseudonymous-identity/\n\nPeople have been using Anime PFP, cartoon PFP, or any other kind of random pictures as their profile pictures to stay anonymous. Some people want to hide their identity for their own good. Sometimes they are afraid of being fired because of something they posted online. PFP NFT is a great way to hide your real identity and I've seen a lot of people online start appearing after they buy a certain NFT. Being pseudonymous can make it easier to express things into the outside world, since people don't know who you are. It helps us to become the person we want to be.\n\n> Pseudonymous identity is the first step. The next step is building reputation with that identity, porting that reputation across different identities, and making a livelihood with that identity. - https\\://shreyashariharan.com/2020/12/19/pseudonymous-identity/\n\n***\n\nIt's hard not to think about NFT right now since it's becoming mainstream. A lot of people still think this is some kind of scam and it won't be here for long. I believe that NFT is going to stay here in the long run, but just not all of them.\n\nPFP projects are on the rise right now because it fulfils human nature. There will be a point where it will stop and people will move on to the next type of NFT. But since most of the top tier projects are getting too expensive, people will keep on finding the next one so they can be a part of something. The demand will always be there once newer people are coming into the space.\n\nI hope that this short essay can be a good explanation on PFP NFT projects. My [twitter DM](https://twitter.com/juliancanderson) is open if there's anything you want to discuss.\n\n***\n\nThanks to [Kalani](https://twitter.com/ScarrottKalani) and [Greg Isenberg](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg) for giving feedback and reading the draft of this essay.

MVRV Z-Score\n\nMVRV Z-Score 是MVRV 的优化版本，MVRV指标是指market cap  /  realised cap ，详细见Glassnode的 相关文章：\n\n```go\n[https://medium.com/@kenoshaking/bitcoin-market-value-to-realized-value-mvrv-ratio-3ebc914dbaee]\n```\n\n1. Supply-Adjusted CDD\n\nSupply-Adjusted CDD 是CDD的优化版本，CDD 指的币天销毁量，详细见QKL的相关文章：\n\n```go\n[https://www.qkl123.com/article/625906]\n```\n\n## 三、指标解读\n\n### 1.整体思路\n\nMVRV Z-Score  判断是否是大周期底部 ，根据Supply-Adjusted CDD 判断是否进入底部调整的末期\n\n### 2. 拆解说明\n\nA. MVRV Z-Score 回测历史数据对于大周期底部具有较好的判断，考虑到真正底部区间一般情况下都会持续一定时间，我们使用MVRV Z-Score (7d Moving Average)会更加稳妥。\n\n从下图可以看到过去几个大周期的历史大底用MVRV Z-Score (7d Moving Average) 都可以判断出来\n\n具体用法是 :  **MVRV Z-Score < 0 时 可以认为已经进入大周期底部区间**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LJQyPSOAHtph8KbvVz1KF.png?height=1078&width=2000)\n\nB.Supply-Adjusted CDD 可以用来表述 Old Coin 的异动程度，这里的异动指的是暴涨，如果Supply-Adjusted CDD那就意味着大量Old Coin 发生交易，也就是说持币很久的那部分人（Strong Hand）选择交易自己的币。\n\n如果这币天异动是发生在周期底部区间，那我们认为是连部分Strong Hand也受不了底部的折磨，选择出局（往往是止盈，可以通过aSOPR来看），在这之后往往会出现变盘\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L9FKcrhvQkMS9XYAjSkie.png?height=906&width=2000)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633517908, "digest": "2fKEpUwNkifMLA702QI6OrfqLRg_hGuGH0tsISJMLh8", "contributor": "0x5727F6dEcd0011edB8420758Ae9EE8A3D4D19aB8"}

Being part of a tribe meant food and shelter. This means your main goal was to stay part of the tribe forever; otherwise...\n\nThanks to innovation, this is no longer true. People started to travel by boat, train, car, and later airplane and learned that the world was bigger than they thought. Humans started to learn more about different regions and cultures.\n\nToday you don't even have to travel anymore; we have the internet. The internet makes it easy to learn about different people, cultures, and ideas.\n\nIn this way, the location you grow up in becomes less and less critical. People become more independent.\n\nToday, people still want to be part of communities, but something that did change is that we now have more freedom (and possibilities) to choose which community to join. And if you don't like a particular community, you can easily move on.\n\nRemote work accelerated this, and it clearly shows that remote work is here to stay, [even for the old dinosaurs](https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-pwc-tells-us-employees-they-need-never-return-office-2021-09-30/?utm_campaign=moment&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).\n\nThe question is, what will we do with this freedom? With great power comes [great responsibility](https://www.notboring.co/p/existential-optimism).\n\nAnother reason that people become more individualistic is that we start to lose our confidence in large institutions.\n\nWhile all of this is happening, we face many obstacles, and for some, we're running out of time.\n\nThe way out? Innovation.\n\nThe first step is to (re)organize ourselves; this will play a massive role in all of this. Innovation happens by optimistic individuals coming together. Not to work, but to create.\n\nThat's why I'm super excited with web3, where people turn work into play.\n\n[Web3](https://creatoreconomy.so/p/curious-beginner-guide-to-crypto) is completely different than web2, where the flippening of everything accelerated.\n\n> **Crypto has one feature that has never existed before - trust.** - Ben Horowitz\n\nYou can clearly see this happening in the art market; a new generation is now buying art in the form of NFTs. What will happen with the physical art market? This will probably become less valuable, and what will happen with more people creating art? I don't know... it's only the beginning, and at this moment, we stand too close to connect the dots. But the new dots are in development.\n\nNFTs are a way to verify ownership. Well, that's important and broken in many other industries. How will they adopt to this new technology? Musicians, mortgages, contracts, diplomas, and the list continues.\n\nIt's all up to us.\n\nWe are the generation with the most freedom any generation experienced.

Ce modèle, bien que logique dans une conduite de projet quelle qu’elle soit, n’est plus du tout optimal dans le développement informatique d’aujourd’hui. En effet, à l’heure des applications distribuées dont la complexité et la taille évoluent de manière exponentielle, un modèle aussi rigide est loin d’être recommandé.\n\nImaginons par exemple le cas d’une fonctionnalité métier, développée 6 mois auparavant, qui ne convienne plus au client lors de la livraison. Une demande de changement va donc être créée et l’équipe de développement va devoir modifier cette fonctionnalité pour répondre à la demande. Hors depuis 6 mois, de nombreuses couches et dépendances se sont ajoutées, le risque de régression est donc quasi certain.\n\nDe ce constat, les [méthodes agiles](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9thode_agile) ont donc fait leur apparition afin de palier à cette rigidité du modèle waterfall. En effet, le modèle itératif des méthodes agiles permet une grande réactivité des équipes de développement suite à une demande de changement du client.\n\nLe dernier “goulot d’étranglement” se situe donc entre les équipes de développement (Dev) et les équipes d’exploitation (Ops). Le déploiement des applications d’aujourd’hui est soumis à un grand nombre de contraintes, entre la rédaction d’un document de mise en exploitation pas toujours compris par les équipes Ops ou bien l’impossibilité de déployer une application car le framework utilisé est incompatible avec l’environnement mutualisé cible, les exemples sont multiples. Nous nous retrouvons devant ce que l’on appelle le “mur de la confusion”.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1114/0\\*hnbkO0lfQizrIVIy.png)\n\nLes conséquences ? Des défaillances applicatives liées à des problèmes de configuration et de mise en production, ainsi que des équipes d’exploitation qui consacrent la majeure partie de leur temps à gérer les versions applicatives.\n\n## Mise en oeuvre de DevOps\n\nDevOps repose sur cinq piliers connus sous l’acronyme CALMS (Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, Sharing)\n\n## Culture\n\nLes membres des équipes doivent avoir la culture du changement. Qu’ils soient habitués au modèle waterfall ou experts Scrum, chacun doit se sensibiliser sur les processus mis en place (automatisation, tests, …)\n\n## Automatisation\n\nL’un des aspects clés de DevOps est l’automatisation des processus de la chaine de production (builds, tests, déploiements). L’étape finale de cette automatisation est le [déploiement continu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery).\n\n## Lean\n\nSur le principe de la culture [lean](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_%28production%29)), le release management doit être efficace et le déploiement des versions en cohésion avec les attentes des utilisateurs.\n\n## Mesure\n\nDans une démarche d’amélioration continue, des indicateurs doivent être mis en place afin de mesurer la qualité des livrables, mais également tout élément mesurable et bénéfique à l’amélioration.\n\n## Partage\n\nLes équipes doivent avoir le même niveau d’information. Cela se concrétise par le partage de la documentation, mais aussi par la communication et la cohésion d’équipe.\n\n## Pour conclure\n\nComme nous avons pu le voir, DevOps n’est pas un outil out of the box. Il s’agit plutôt d’une recette à moduler selon les exigences et contraintes d’un projet et/ou des équipes. Quelques leviers de mise en oeuvre sont toutefois primordiaux :\n\n* Un développement itératif selon les méthodes agiles\n* Une intégration continue avec le processus de build\n* Des tests automatisés (unitaires, performances, fonctionnels)\n* Des déploiements/mises en production automatisé(e)s\n* Une collaboration étroite entre les différentes équipes\n* Une infrastructure cohérente (environnements similaires, que ce soit en dev, test, preprod, ou prod)\n\nNous détaillerons tous ces aspects dans de prochains articles, donc restez à l’écoute !", "timestamp": 1633519557, "digest": "ph8XFdKa8utq6Ny3485AqDR04iKoTreNJn0m3bk9HMc", "contributor": "0x8F47969f0a0458fe9Fc72812fED63f75A0819624"}

Just like the library, a game of FIFA 1998 against a friend over a phone-line internet connection and a telephone tree were for me growing up in the 1990’s. \n\nI’m sure this is relatable, with new times comes new tech which is both great and invites us to be a bit nostalgic about. Life goes on and the generation coming up after you, will, broadly spoken, live the same life with a few tech improvements. \n\nThis time however it’s different.\n\nLet’s say that the 5 categories below in its own way represent the most important things in life for kids (huge simplification and generalisation, I know:)\n\n* Family\n* Friends\n* School\n* Sports / Arts / Music\n* Money\n\n![Metamask logo - https://metamask.io/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q7BW8MIQWuONeOhXkayHK.png?height=1024&width=1024)\n\nI find that my kids, and their peers, experience all 5 categories substantially different than me and my friends in the 1990’s. This not only opens up way more possibilities for them in any way they look to develop themselves but also, I would argue, *programs* them in a fundamentally different way than lots of generations before them.\n\n**In this series I aim to explore how their life, and their future, has already fundamentally changed.** For me, it would be great to find insights into the *programming* and *default modes* of ‘these kids nowadays’.\n\n*So in fact just a bit of factual reporting going on here in the year 2021 on two kids of 10 and 8 years old. Looking at the impact new technologies have right now and a bit further down the road, on their immediate future as they venture into their teens and twenties. Don’t expect well thought out visionary stuff, I will however link to blogs that inspired me to go on this experimental journey with my kids.*\n\n**What I found when on our journey - and aim to explore together with you in separate entries**\n\n* These kids don’t have a bank account, but have made money online already by selling NFTs\n* These kids have experienced online education and see how their education could be boundless, online\n* These kids default mode is to build, instead of consume, when they play their games. Minecraft, Roblox, and such\n* These kids connect to peers who have the same interests as them.

I promise it's not, though! There is a world of innovation happening in DeFi and we're still just getting started.\n\nIt's tough to put an exact definition on DeFi, but [Marvin Ammori](https://future.a16z.com/cryptos-fourth-wave-defi-poised-for-breakthrough/) has a great one:\n\n*...the ecosystem of blockchain-enabled products and services that replace traditional financial intermediaries with freely accessible, autonomous, and transparent software*\n\nIf you're just getting into crypto, that definition may seem daunting and full of words you don't understand. Hopefully by the end of this article, it'll make a little more sense to you.\n\nMore simply, you can think of DeFi in contrast to traditional finance (TradFi).\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bede072-0d51-4c79-a1ef-71408fd3c9ea_5472x3648.jpeg)\n\n### What's TradFi?\n\nTradFi is our legacy financial system. It's what we use every day when we deposit checks, take out loans, or trade stocks on a brokerage.\n\nAll these products use fiat (government issued) currencies like the US Dollar, British Pound, or Euro. They're also run by centralized companies, like Wells Fargo or Bank of America, who retain a lot of discretion and control over their products.\n\n### What's Wrong with TradFi?\n\nTradFi is the backbone of our financial system today, and when it works, it's great. We've made consistent advances through digitization. Transferring assets, making trades, and taking out loans has never been easier. And TradFi works great... until it doesn't.\n\nIn my mind, there are 3 areas where TradFi falls flat today:\n\n1. Too much control\n2. Outdated regulations & technology\n3. Slow & inefficient\n\n### **Discretion & Control**\n\nTradFi companies have full control over their products and services.\n\nIf Bank of America doesn't want you to be able to withdraw $5,000 from your checking account, they can just stop you from doing so! If PayPal or Venmo wanted to stop you from sending money to someone else, they can always just block the transaction and you'll have little to no recourse.\n\nTradFi is able to do this because its products are run by centralized institutions.\n\n### Outdated\n\nTradFi has outdated regulation and often uses outdated technology.\n\nIn January 2021, thanks to Reddit's WallStreetBets, Gamestop saw its market cap climb from $300 million to over $30 billion. Retail traders bought stock and call options, driving volatility and prices to astronomical levels. During the height of the volatility, trading platforms like Robinhood had to suspend trading of Gamestop and other meme stocks.\n\nUsers were (justifiably) angry and Robinhood took a lot of flak for this decision. In the end, I think the problem was caused more [by clearinghouse regulations than it was by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week). Still, should this have happened? No, **this is not 1980. People should be able to buy and sell the stocks they choose instantaneously.** TradFi is still taking 2 business days to settle transactions... why?? We make trades in milliseconds, so there's no reason for settlement to take days.\n\nThis holds true in many other areas of finance. Why does an ACH transfer take 3 business days? Computers don't sleep; we should be able to transfer money whenever we want.\n\n### Slow & Inefficient\n\nFinally, TradFi is just slow and inefficient. Thanks to the high level of human involvement and huge, legacy organizations, banks and financial institutions have become slower and more ineffective.\n\nAll this means that TradFi institutions - banks especially - are not innovators. This isn't a problem that's inherent to TradFi, but it's the state of the industry today. Institutions have become lazy, and their products and customers suffer for it. Here are a couple examples:\n\n## Why is DeFi the Future?\n\nDeFi cuts out these middlemen and gatekeepers. And because DeFi is built on the blockchain, it has a number of inherent advantages over TradFi. To name a few of the biggest:\n\n**Open, auditable smart contracts and data** - DeFi products run on smart contracts (code). Any smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain is public. You can read all the code and see for yourself how your money will be used. (Or, you can rely on auditors to do it for you). Also, all transactions on Ethereum are public; it’s much easier to audit a company’s data if you need to, making it harder for fraudsters to steal people’s money.\n\n**Permissionless** - You don't need to seek anyone's approval to use DeFi apps. If you want to take out a loan on Aave, you just need to provide the correct amount of collateral. There's no need to jump through hoops, create accounts, or wait days for human approval. Just deposit the right collateral and take out your loan.\n\nAlso, no one can stop you from *creating* a decentralized app. In our current system, if Amazon decides they don’t like you, they can just turn off your access to their servers. The same is not true for Ethereum. Whether you’re a user or a developer, you can use and create decentralized apps. It doesn’t matter what you look like, where you’re from, what school you went to, who you know, or what your political beliefs are.\n\n**Decentralized** - No one person can control the blockchain, so no one person can take you down, freeze your assets, or stop you from using their program, either. Even if a DeFi project wanted to stop you from using their product, there's no way they can!\n\n**Fast, Frictionless, & Autonomous** - Imagine you want to close a stock brokerage account and transfer the stocks onto a new broker’s platform. If you have any experience dealing with brokerages, you know how much of a hassle that process will be. But on DeFi rails, the process could take just 10 minutes. That's because the smart contracts on top of the blockchain can be executed **without human intervention**, making them quicker and more efficient.\n\n**Composability** - DeFi products and tokens tend to be highly composable. Think of each DeFi product as a Lego that can be stacked on top of another. You can take one product, couple it with another and everything just works. For instance, you could [stake your ETH with Lido](https://easydefi.substack.com/p/what-is-steth-what-is-lido), then take out a loan against your stETH (in theory - many of these features haven't been built yet).\n\nThese benefits allow for so many unique and interesting applications. And the thing is, we're only getting started. Just like the Internet allowed for things that people could conceive of in 1990, DeFi will allow for new financial products that we can't even fathom yet\n\nI'm going to be examining different decentralized applications each week and breaking them down with easy-to-understand explanations.\n\nNext week, we'll take our first step into DeFi and get set up to start using real world DeFi projects!\n\n## More Reading on DeFi\n\n* [Decentralized Finance: What It Is, Why It Matters](https://future.a16z.com/cryptos-fourth-wave-defi-poised-for-breakthrough/)\n* [DeFi Pulse: dashboard for decentralized finance projects](https://defipulse.com/)", "timestamp": 1633523622, "digest": "ARienShnAn4_9c-1CMNisfFIgs3CppFO054RNV7Xeqk", "contributor": "0xB7BD14E2497cdC57675E896af84ecB652D294AD1"}

In this post, I’m trying to riff on his thinking, expanding a little bit on how I think Web3 is really different to web 2.0, and what truly novel applications may already be conceivable today, both across “Multi-Player” and “Single Player” Crypto.\n\nFirst - let’s consider again how Web3 is different to what we’ve come to understand as web 2.0:\n\nIf you zoom out far enough (but not too far!), web 2.0 and Web3 both still look like graphs: you'll see nodes (your Twitter handle, or a tweet, OR a to-do list) and edges (the act of liking a tweet, following someone, a message, the act of writing onto a To-Do list).\n\nThere are at least 3 key differences that Web3 introduces to how these graphs work:\n\n1. On web 2.0, nodes are centrally owned by companies (you may own the password to your Twitter account, but Twitter ultimately owns the account itself, along with every tweet). On Web3, **[all these nodes are belong to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQE66WA2s-A)**, making it possible to take them elsewhere. \\\\n\n2. On web 2.0, edges (i. e. the links connecting nodes) carry pure information. On Web3, edges carry **both information and value**. On web 2.0, adding edges is \"free\", increasing quantity at the cost of quality - on Web3 adding edges is costly, potentially **increasing quality at the cost of quantity.**\n3. On web 2.0, you outsource responsibility and processing to a company's tech stack and management - the latter will ultimately act in the company’s interest (which *may* be aligned with yours, but not always). On Web3, you **outsource responsibility and processing to an emergent, decentralized, collectively-owned entity that *may act autonomously***.\n\nEach of these has profound implications. While true crypto-native apps will naturally emerge around these paradigms, it’s an interesting exercise to translate traditional apps into the crypto-paradigm:\n\n**Multiplayer Crypto:**\n\nAgain: in Web 2.0 Social Networks, edges carry information - in Web3 networks, edges carry value.\n\nThis is probably considered the most massive paradigm shift, especially with the (re-)emergence of **DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)**, which carry a revolutionary potential on par with the **invention of the corporation, and maybe the nation state?** [Balaji Srinivasan](https://balajis.com) outlines part of this vision aptly here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5UAtAOV66c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5UAtAOV66c)\n\nAs humans, we are in fact already familiar with networks where nodes and edges carry economic value and are governed through a rule of law: today, nation states, churches and companies are the predominant form of organizing humans around a shared cause using links that go beyond casual communication (such as a Facebook group, or friends around a dinner table).\n\n**DAOs enable entirely new paradigms here for three reasons:**\n\n**First**, they make it several orders of magnitude easier to form economic collectives (think: the difference between sending postal mail vs email). **DAOs combine the ease of using social networks with the impact of economic cooperation.**\n\n**Secondly**, the Autonomous aspect of D**A**Os is computer-based, enabling an **automatic entaglement of rule and execution**. This will cause ([and has caused](https://ethereum.org/en/history/)!) a lot of headaches in the early days, but eventually allows a more powerful “offshoring” of trust, freeing up organizational cycles for more relevant purposes. Think board games where players are forced to do a lot of “accounting” in order to prevent even accidental cheating, vs games that provide a more natural flow (and are thus more fun to play!)\n\nThere is an obvious and potentially dangerous path towards merging/enriching Smart Contracts with AI (effectively replacing human arbitration), but that one deserves a post on its own.\n\n**Thirdly**, the Decentralized nature of **D**AOs enables emancipation and independence from legacy organizations, as it’s much harder to just take them out by targeting a small number of individuals (such as a CEO) - a very curious challenge for both The State and traditional Corporations!\n\nNow, consider the following “trad-orgs” and their respective DAO version:\n\n* A **labor union** may outsource the initiation the organization of strikes to its DAO, making it much harder / impossible to simply bribe its leaders. You either compell the collective to cooperate, or it will strike.\n* We’ll see novel form of **Insurances** emerge through the use of DAOs, in some cases replacing the need for middlemen, in other cases coming up with forms of insurance that are completely new.\n* In the **Art Market,** [DAO collectives](https://pleasr.org/#) have emerged as new ways of funding an artist’s work in a model that’s similar to Patreon, but instead of being many-to-one these be many-to-many.\n* A **social network** that transforms into a DAO quickly becomes an **economic flashmob** that can rally its resources around a shared cause - this is obviously both scary and cool. Just consider replacing angry eyeballs and fist-shaking with millions of micro-contributions that have a real world impact…\n* We may see vastly more crypto projects choose to **“incorporate”** as DAOs, either in parallel to setting up a regular company, or exclusively so, which will beget tremendous insight and exercise into this novel form of human collaboration.\n* We will likely see novel forms of cooperatives/collectives emerge that sit somewhere between families and companies in our org stack, and are completely remote.\n\n**Single Player Crypto - the “Super Ego” Stack**\n\nIt is admittedly a little unclear to me how much sense “single player” apps *technically* make in a blockchain context, but “single player” still makes up a huge and sensible part of our technology stack today. Given this and assuming a crypto-maximalist future, I think it’s conceivable that we will see some type of single player crypto applications emerge.\n\nFor example, if we consider that in Web3, **edges carry value,** that paradigm would enable a range of “Odysseus-style” apps that provide economic incentives for users to adhere to self-imposed goals - this category is basically about outsourcing your [super-ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Super-ego) to an external entity.\n\n* A ToDo-List, but you get to externalize control to a (single-player!) DAO that will assign a economic penalty to unfinished tasks.\n* Anti-Distraction software (like Freedom), but with economic penalties to disincentivize cheating on your super-ego.\n* Assume all financial transactions have moved to crypto, it’s **conceivable to lock your spending into a variety of smart self-contracts that align your long term goals against short term impulses.**\n\nIn theory, all of this is possible with a traditional infrastructure, but who would want to outsource their super-ego to a *company*? A provably non-human, autonomous, crypto-enabled entity is a completely different partner here.\n\nI’d love to your hear your thoughts, for now: [on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/fabianstelzer)", "timestamp": 1633523292, "digest": "88g12eQz0FbNpTM4sDUadgYPR7mOOZoSffq0sVTCfU8", "contributor": "0x5Ed82a25DfeEaE0c35297B605fC9c63A14caE0fd"}

B. Stern\n\nA few weeks ago [Jesse Walden](https://medium.com/u/e7d4eae1a2eb?source=post_page-----b489e60a3e13--------------------------------) of [Mediachain Labs](http://blog.mediachain.io/) asked me a deceptively simple question:\n\n> *What would a Creative Commons-type license look like if in addition to requesting attribution (as is required by many open licenses), the license also required licensees to let the author know about any re-use?*\n\nWe can call usage information “*gratitude*” — that is, in exchange for allowing use of a work for free, the user (or the platform on which the work is published) thanks the author by letting them know where the work is being re-used.

This article and draft license are the initial results of that conversation.\n\nThis exploration is a thought-piece, designed to spur discussion around new technology and the commons. Nothing I say here has been endorsed by the Creative Commons (“CC”) organization, nor am I advocating adoption of any specific new license by that organization.

All comments and criticisms welcome!\n\n## **A Shared Vision**\n\n[Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) has been a tremendous success story in providing tools that help creators and the larger public freely share media online.\n\nIn most countries, the act of creation results in a copyright interest that allows the author to strictly control re-use of the creative work. While theoretically this right exists in order to enhance the cultural commons by encouraging authors to bring works to the public, because copyright by default restricts all use, it often unnecessarily limits sharing even where the original author might favor free use the content. This may actually diminish the commons. \\*(\\*\\*\\*\\*I explore the historical background of copyright and the cultural commons in an \\****[accompanying post on Creative Blockchain.](https://medium.com/@LHKoonce/32adffcb6357#.rzerwm58z)***)\n\nNew tools were needed to address this inherent problem. The suite of CC licenses introduced in 2002 was intended to align the act of creation with the way we share information online.\n\n> CC licenses differ from traditional licenses because they are rooted in the notion that digital works are not, by their nature, scarce resources.\n\nInstead, CC embraces the fact that digital media is infinitely reproducible, and thus can be shared and re-used very easily, creating enormous value for the public and creators alike.\n\nFor instance, the basic [CC-Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license allows free use of a work for any purpose, so long as the licensee credits the creator. CC also provides guides to supplement the licenses, such as best practices for attribution; for example, the use of [machine readable license terms](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license#Author.2C_License.2C_Machine-readability) to automate the licensing process.\n\nTop social media platforms — including Medium, Soundcloud, YouTube, Vimeo, and Flickr— have embraced CC licensing, enabling their users to opt-in in their publishing flows.\n\nToday there are over one billion licensed CC works. These adoption metrics validate an idea that would have been controversial less than two decades ago:\n\n> People have an insatiable desire to create and to share openly, even without monetary compensation.\n\nYet in the absence of a financial incentive, questions remain as to how to promote the sustained growth of the commons.\n\n## **A Broken Loop**\n\n![“Creative Commons: Remix” by Creative Commons, used under CC-BY-SA / Clipped from original & reversed](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*nRM0pw708Hngkurs_v3Qqg.gif)\n\nIn October 2015 Creative Commons issued a [five-year organizational strategy ](https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CC-Strategy-2016-2020-1.pdf)that reboots the organization’s mission statement. Central to that mission is a vision of why sharing is important:\n\n> **Sharing is not a purely selfless act** — while thinking beyond one’s own personal benefit is at the core of why we share, **it also pays itself forward in reputation, and rewards us with good feelings and personal gratification**. Sharing contributes to our individual identity — how we want to see ourselves, and be seen, in the world.\n\nSuccessful social networks have long heeded this insight, rewarding sharing with feedback in the form of reputation (quantified by follower counts), gratification (quantified by likes, hearts, upvotes and reblogs) and profile pages that allow us to curate our digital identities.\n\nThese feedback mechanisms provide incentives for us to share more — a virtuous cycle that results in strong network effects, and one that is largely absent from the commons today. As CC’s strategy document aptly identifies:\n\n> *“Adding a work to the commons is a huge gift, but contributors get very little in exchange — no feedback, no analytics, not even a ‘like’ or a ‘thank you.’”*\n\nToday the creator of a CC-licensed image published using [500px](http://500px.com/) or a similar platform does not know that a blogger has re-used the image in a post on Medium. This is true even if the author of the post manually includes attribution.\n\nTo fix this problem, the CC board recognized a need to promote new ways of moving the existing model from a static one to one that is more dynamic:\n\n> The size of the commons is not as important as how (and if) the works it contains are used to achieve our vision and mission. This is most likely to come to fruition if the materials contained within the commons are easy to discover and curate, to use and remix, and if those who create feel valued for their contributions. To date, this has not been the case…\n>\n> …The Web has obviously changed significantly since 2002 when CC launched, but the way the CC licenses work hasn’t. While most web services and apps are data driven and accessible via API, CC’s licenses are largely static…There are no services to enhance the user experience, or provide additional value and create connections. Users still have to manually provide attribution. There are no analytics about use or remix. While CC is integral to many kinds of creativity and sharing on the web, it has yet to capitalize on this influence to connect and light up the commons.\n\nOur proposed “Gratitude” license primarily addresses the organization’s need to build “\\*a more vibrant and usable commons” \\*where “*search, curation, meta tagging, content analytics, one click attribution are all examples of areas where improved discovery would support creators.*”\n\n## **The License**\n\nThe core idea for this “Gratitude” license is to enable a more robust form of attribution than currently exists for CC licenses. Specifically, providing usage data back to the creator when works are used satisfies the organization’s desire for content analytics.\n\nThis is important because notifications of use allow a creator to connect with their entire audience and accumulate “Likes” (or the equivalent gratitude) as the work spreads.\n\nWe considered a number of approaches to what mechanism would work best to allow this “gratitude” to flow. We rejected those that would require technical specifications in the license itself, as this would break with the CC model and possibly limit adoption. Instead, we propose a handful of suggested implementations that we believe will enable the type of feedback to creators discussed above:\n\n> 1. Licensees who use works under a Gratitude License must retain the contact information of the original author, if it is provided with the license;\n>\n> 2\\. Licensees must also retain the contact information of anyone in the chain between the original author and the licensee who has modified the original work (“adapters”);\n>\n> 3\\. Finally, licensees must provide information regarding the location where they publish the licensed material back to the original author and any adapters, using any reasonable means.\n\n**You can view the [sample proposed Gratitude License in full here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fQBiXDT0crQUQlIdVyCfgAVU3iYpLLKcwH0ZIPDy4xk/edit)**.\n\n## Compliance\n\nWhile individual licensees using works under a Gratitude License might at first simply comply by providing usage information to the original author via email, ultimately platforms that host works under “Gratitude” licenses should be able to help facilitate compliance on behalf of their users by automating the tracking of a work and notification of the creator.\n\nSocial networks already track sharing within their networks quite well. When content is reposted within Twitter (retweet), the author is automatically notified, as well as any other user mentioned within the tweet. This is facilitated by the use of a single database to record all interactions within the network.\n\nFurther validation can be seen in systems for tracking the use of copyrighted works, such as [YouTube Content ID](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797370?hl=en) and [Facebook Rights Manager](https://rightsmanager.fb.com/), which use content recognition technology to associate duplicate or derivative user-generated content with original, rights managed works by matching content based on the way it looks or sounds.\n\nHowever, there is a massive problem that prevents these platforms from extending their existing systems to Creative Commons: These databases are proprietary silos. No information is shared across platforms, which is explicitly what CC licenses encourage.\n\nA single database for the commons would ease the discovery of works, and provide a shared infrastructure to benefit all participants in the CC ecosystem.\n\n## **Solutions Emerge**\n\n![“Creative Commons: Remix” by Creative Commons, used under CC-BY-SA / Clipped from original](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*rQKpGJk13ymZr7OG3HdvMw.gif)\n\nThe idea of building a shared index of Creative Commons works dovetails with rapidly developing blockchain technology, first popularized by Bitcoin.\n\nA blockchain is effectively a distributed database where maintenance is shared across a peer-to-peer network with a common interest in ensuring the upkeep of data, as opposed to being maintained by a single, central entity.\n\nNot only could a blockchain-based solution help improve discovery by providing a single database of CC works, it could do so in a decentralized way that maintains the current structure of the commons: Data remains with the participants —the creators themselves or platforms where works are published — and the CC organization remains a neutral entity with no need to invest in heavy, centralized infrastructure.\n\nAny platform that adopts such a protocol would be participating in a truly “commons” database and such collaborative infrastructure can be used to solve the problems identified earlier. First, attribution for creators can be automated since all data about works in the commons is now in one shared place. Additionally, creators can be notified of re-use of their work automatically by sending a ping-back to the network.\n\nThe result would be a much simpler mechanism to connect creators with new audiences, for audiences to discover more works by the same author, and for rewards that stem from reaching new eyeballs to flow back to publishers automatically any time media is shared.\n\nUltimately, one could imagine a system of certification for content platforms that would result in “Gratitude-Certified” platforms agreeing to best practices in providing such information to authors.\n\nThe vision is ambitious, but achievable. [Mediachain](http://mediachain.io/), for instance, already is building open source technology to provide a blockchain-based, “universal media library.” Like Youtube and Facebook, Mediachain enables the use of content identification technology to connect a unit of media to relevant information, such as its author, its license, and the history of its re-use online.\n\nIn this way, a “virtuous loop” of rewarding contributions to the commons with gratitude and reputation could be completed automatically and reliably by platforms participating in the open protocol.\n\nThe Creative Commons vision helped rekindle the idea of a vibrant public domain just as the immense possibilities of the Internet were beginning to be realized. Now, 15 years later, new technologies and approaches are emerging that may help “light up the commons” in entirely new ways.\n\n——\n\n*[Lance Koonce](https://medium.com/u/3adb14779a1b?source=post_page-----b489e60a3e13--------------------------------)*\\* is a guest author on the Mediachain Blog.

This may actually diminish the commons. \\*(\\*\\*\\*\\*I explore the historical background of copyright and the cultural commons in an \\****[accompanying post on Creative Blockchain.](https://medium.com/@LHKoonce/32adffcb6357#.rzerwm58z)***)\n\nNew tools were needed to address this inherent problem.

CC also provides guides to supplement the licenses, such as best practices for attribution; for example, the use of [machine readable license terms](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license#Author.2C_License.2C_Machine-readability) to automate the licensing process.\n\nTop social media platforms — including Medium, Soundcloud, YouTube, Vimeo, and Flickr— have embraced CC licensing, enabling their users to opt-in in their publishing flows.\n\nToday there are over one billion licensed CC works. These adoption metrics validate an idea that would have been controversial less than two decades ago:\n\n> People have an insatiable desire to create and to share openly, even without monetary compensation.\n\nYet in the absence of a financial incentive, questions remain as to how to promote the sustained growth of the commons.\n\n## **A Broken Loop**\n\n![“Creative Commons: Remix” by Creative Commons, used under CC-BY-SA / Clipped from original & reversed](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*nRM0pw708Hngkurs_v3Qqg.gif)\n\nIn October 2015 Creative Commons issued a [five-year organizational strategy ](https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CC-Strategy-2016-2020-1.pdf)that reboots the organization’s mission statement. Central to that mission is a vision of why sharing is important:\n\n> **Sharing is not a purely selfless act** — while thinking beyond one’s own personal benefit is at the core of why we share, **it also pays itself forward in reputation, and rewards us with good feelings and personal gratification**. Sharing contributes to our individual identity — how we want to see ourselves, and be seen, in the world.\n\nSuccessful social networks have long heeded this insight, rewarding sharing with feedback in the form of reputation (quantified by follower counts), gratification (quantified by likes, hearts, upvotes and reblogs) and profile pages that allow us to curate our digital identities.\n\nThese feedback mechanisms provide incentives for us to share more — a virtuous cycle that results in strong network effects, and one that is largely absent from the commons today. As CC’s strategy document aptly identifies:\n\n> *“Adding a work to the commons is a huge gift, but contributors get very little in exchange — no feedback, no analytics, not even a ‘like’ or a ‘thank you.’”*\n\nToday the creator of a CC-licensed image published using [500px](http://500px.com/) or a similar platform does not know that a blogger has re-used the image in a post on Medium. This is true even if the author of the post manually includes attribution.\n\nTo fix this problem, the CC board recognized a need to promote new ways of moving the existing model from a static one to one that is more dynamic:\n\n> The size of the commons is not as important as how (and if) the works it contains are used to achieve our vision and mission. This is most likely to come to fruition if the materials contained within the commons are easy to discover and curate, to use and remix, and if those who create feel valued for their contributions. To date, this has not been the case…\n>\n> …The Web has obviously changed significantly since 2002 when CC launched, but the way the CC licenses work hasn’t. While most web services and apps are data driven and accessible via API, CC’s licenses are largely static…There are no services to enhance the user experience, or provide additional value and create connections. Users still have to manually provide attribution. There are no analytics about use or remix. While CC is integral to many kinds of creativity and sharing on the web, it has yet to capitalize on this influence to connect and light up the commons.\n\nOur proposed “Gratitude” license primarily addresses the organization’s need to build “\\*a more vibrant and usable commons” \\*where “*search, curation, meta tagging, content analytics, one click attribution are all examples of areas where improved discovery would support creators.*”\n\n## **The License**\n\nThe core idea for this “Gratitude” license is to enable a more robust form of attribution than currently exists for CC licenses. Specifically, providing usage data back to the creator when works are used satisfies the organization’s desire for content analytics.\n\nThis is important because notifications of use allow a creator to connect with their entire audience and accumulate “Likes” (or the equivalent gratitude) as the work spreads.\n\nWe considered a number of approaches to what mechanism would work best to allow this “gratitude” to flow. We rejected those that would require technical specifications in the license itself, as this would break with the CC model and possibly limit adoption. Instead, we propose a handful of suggested implementations that we believe will enable the type of feedback to creators discussed above:\n\n> 1. Licensees who use works under a Gratitude License must retain the contact information of the original author, if it is provided with the license;\n>\n> 2\\. Licensees must also retain the contact information of anyone in the chain between the original author and the licensee who has modified the original work (“adapters”);\n>\n> 3\\. Finally, licensees must provide information regarding the location where they publish the licensed material back to the original author and any adapters, using any reasonable means.\n\n**You can view the [sample proposed Gratitude License in full here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fQBiXDT0crQUQlIdVyCfgAVU3iYpLLKcwH0ZIPDy4xk/edit)**.\n\n## Compliance\n\nWhile individual licensees using works under a Gratitude License might at first simply comply by providing usage information to the original author via email, ultimately platforms that host works under “Gratitude” licenses should be able to help facilitate compliance on behalf of their users by automating the tracking of a work and notification of the creator.\n\nSocial networks already track sharing within their networks quite well. When content is reposted within Twitter (retweet), the author is automatically notified, as well as any other user mentioned within the tweet. This is facilitated by the use of a single database to record all interactions within the network.\n\nFurther validation can be seen in systems for tracking the use of copyrighted works, such as [YouTube Content ID](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797370?hl=en) and [Facebook Rights Manager](https://rightsmanager.fb.com/), which use content recognition technology to associate duplicate or derivative user-generated content with original, rights managed works by matching content based on the way it looks or sounds.\n\nHowever, there is a massive problem that prevents these platforms from extending their existing systems to Creative Commons: These databases are proprietary silos. No information is shared across platforms, which is explicitly what CC licenses encourage.\n\nA single database for the commons would ease the discovery of works, and provide a shared infrastructure to benefit all participants in the CC ecosystem.\n\n## **Solutions Emerge**\n\n![“Creative Commons: Remix” by Creative Commons, used under CC-BY-SA / Clipped from original](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*rQKpGJk13ymZr7OG3HdvMw.gif)\n\nThe idea of building a shared index of Creative Commons works dovetails with rapidly developing blockchain technology, first popularized by Bitcoin.\n\nA blockchain is effectively a distributed database where maintenance is shared across a peer-to-peer network with a common interest in ensuring the upkeep of data, as opposed to being maintained by a single, central entity.\n\nNot only could a blockchain-based solution help improve discovery by providing a single database of CC works, it could do so in a decentralized way that maintains the current structure of the commons: Data remains with the participants —the creators themselves or platforms where works are published — and the CC organization remains a neutral entity with no need to invest in heavy, centralized infrastructure.\n\nAny platform that adopts such a protocol would be participating in a truly “commons” database and such collaborative infrastructure can be used to solve the problems identified earlier. First, attribution for creators can be automated since all data about works in the commons is now in one shared place. Additionally, creators can be notified of re-use of their work automatically by sending a ping-back to the network.\n\nThe result would be a much simpler mechanism to connect creators with new audiences, for audiences to discover more works by the same author, and for rewards that stem from reaching new eyeballs to flow back to publishers automatically any time media is shared.\n\nUltimately, one could imagine a system of certification for content platforms that would result in “Gratitude-Certified” platforms agreeing to best practices in providing such information to authors.\n\nThe vision is ambitious, but achievable. [Mediachain](http://mediachain.io/), for instance, already is building open source technology to provide a blockchain-based, “universal media library.” Like Youtube and Facebook, Mediachain enables the use of content identification technology to connect a unit of media to relevant information, such as its author, its license, and the history of its re-use online.\n\nIn this way, a “virtuous loop” of rewarding contributions to the commons with gratitude and reputation could be completed automatically and reliably by platforms participating in the open protocol.\n\nThe Creative Commons vision helped rekindle the idea of a vibrant public domain just as the immense possibilities of the Internet were beginning to be realized. Now, 15 years later, new technologies and approaches are emerging that may help “light up the commons” in entirely new ways.\n\n——\n\n*[Lance Koonce](https://medium.com/u/3adb14779a1b?source=post_page-----b489e60a3e13--------------------------------)*\\* is a guest author on the Mediachain Blog.

B. Stern\n\nA few weeks ago [Jesse Walden](https://medium.com/u/e7d4eae1a2eb?source=post_page-----b489e60a3e13--------------------------------) of [Mediachain Labs](http://blog.mediachain.io/) asked me a deceptively simple question:\n\n> *What would a Creative Commons-type license look like if in addition to requesting attribution (as is required by many open licenses), the license also required licensees to let the author know about any re-use?*\n\nWe can call usage information “*gratitude*” — that is, in exchange for allowing use of a work for free, the user (or the platform on which the work is published) thanks the author by letting them know where the work is being re-used. In turn, the author would be able to connect with their entire audience, anywhere their work is shared. This article and draft license are the initial results of that conversation.\n\nThis exploration is a thought-piece, designed to spur discussion around new technology and the commons. Nothing I say here has been endorsed by the Creative Commons (“CC”) organization, nor am I advocating adoption of any specific new license by that organization. We are simply using the existing public models as a leaping-off point.\n\nWe are calling the license *Gratitude 1.0* and while I’d urge you to read through the background information first, if you want to jump to the license itself, you can read it in full [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fQBiXDT0crQUQlIdVyCfgAVU3iYpLLKcwH0ZIPDy4xk/edit).

Half an hour after finishing work John was still waiting on the fifty-four. The route connected two of the worst parts of the city and those riding it frequently littered and graffitied. So First Bus deployed the shabbiest rolling stock on that route. These older buses often struggled, especially in the winter, hence the wait.\n\nAnother bus missed its appointment. John escaped the woman's chatter and crossed the road. The pub would be warm, and there he could drink enough to forget about the cost of a taxi home.\n\nThere were few there, befitting half-nine on a Monday night, so he sat at the bar. “Awright, pal. How's it going? The usual, aye?” asked the barman. “Aye, the usual. No bad I suppose. Two sales today. Keeps them off my back.”\n\n“I tell you, John. You need to get in the crypto game. Bitcoin's up, Ethereum's up. I'm making as much from that as I am here. Passive income. Crypto's the future. Get on board before you're too late and get out of that call centre.”\n\nJohn wasn’t listening. He had a habit of converting the many facets of someone's personality into a single value: good, bad or indifferent. Despite the barman’s many virtues, he had been deemed bad. His taste in music and fashion didn’t align with John’s and the barman’s success with women didn’t help either. Because of this verdict John dismissed the argument for blockchain technology, thinking it a pathetic attempt to impress others. “Nah, not for me. I don't understand how that stuff works and I'm not putting money into something I don't understand.”\n\nAs he lay in bed that night processing the alcohol, a mantra ran though his mind: *Hi, I'm John calling from Alliance Telecom. Have you ever thought about changing your phone provider?*\n\n \n\nSoon after that trip to the pub he'd quit the call centre. It was a point of principle.

Every day there are community calls, trainings, and new tools being developed.  DAO exchanges to learn, Discord servers to join, community growth protocols to practice, the space is hot to say the least.  The promise of community-led growth and development is intoxicating, and all the scene is looking to DAOs as the solution of the moment.  These DAOs are expanding rapidly, but there are a number of “standard” protocols utilized by these groups to ensure decentralization.  \n\nDo all DAOs need a social token?  How else can decentralized governance be solidified?  Are there not ways to ensure governance in piecemeal ways?  Engagement, creation, personal effort - these are difficult to measure in a quantifiable way, but their quality will always outweigh the difficulties of data management.  Tokens are a fascinating technology and their potential is larger than their impacts now, in a good way.  But are tokens needed for *every* DAO?  For each community?  Perhaps partnering with established tokens or cryptocurrencies not only allow participation to be translated to governance via tokens, but can provide lifestyle utility.  Instead of being able to vote for the future of a community, what if tips and bounties could help order some food, get some movie tickets, buy a new video game, add another month of a subscription service, etc.  Surely this is not out of the scope of possibilities.\n\nWe are not against tokens, tokenomics is a deeply interesting development and has a long way to go before the “fad fizzles out”.  However, we are not convinced that community tokens are required for a DAO to grow and foster a healthy, positive, and productive community.  Does this make a project “less” Web3?  Doubtful, though no doubt some will try to make that criticism.  We firmly believe an essential mindset of a Web3 shift is true reflections of if a new technology is needed or not, rather than blindly jumping into the latest technological development.\n\n### Is this on-chain or off-chain?\n\nThis leads to the bigger technological advancement in this space: the blockchain.  What does an off-chain Web3 community look like?  It would surely still look like a Discord server opening up a community with some well-established Web2, Web3, and other tools.  Is there a hesitancy to allow such community growths not include all the hottest tech?  Perhaps, but this will be a slower build.  We are uncertain of what on-chain vs off-chain discussions will develop into.  As writing here right now even on this new Mirror platform the on-chain/off-chain development has a lot of room to grow.  \n\nSurely not *everything* needs to be on-chain, but as blockchain technology grows, mitigating financial obstacles, environmental obstacles, and user experience obstacles, perhaps there are more offerings to be uncovered that are perfect for such projects.  We are not, however, in any rush to be the first arriving at one or more of these flash spots.  Community will be community, regardless of the language, location, or mode of discourse, we do not wish to forget this anytime soon.  If blockchain can help each and every one of us to become better scholars, we will follow up on those leads with passsion, anything short of that can wait for maturity.  This is a community for anything, it need not break its back to become a community for *everything*. \n\n### How do we define ‘anything’?\n\nGood question.  It is a futile endeavor, to say the least.  We cannot hope to define more than we understand, but we can listen far beyond the scope of our understanding.  That is something we can commit to, and perhaps even develop a community that commits to the same thing.  It is through this that we do not feel the need to sprint to a manifesto, only provide interests and dreams.  A community can become a dictionary, self-defining what is the scope of a community and beyond.  This circular thinking can be extended to infinity, but we are content starting with just 1.\n\nThere are plenty of questions to both follow and lead.

This was a post I wrote at the request of Jesse and Denis at Mediachain, exploring the use of blockchain for media, and in particular how it could incentivize the sharing of content.*\n\n***Summary: A brief look at the history of the “commons” helps explain the power of sharing creative output, and points towards how new technologies like blockchain can further “light up” this communal resource.***\n\n## **Why do we create?**\n\nWhy did humans, millennia ago, begin forming sounds into alphabets and words, or decide to pick up chalk to draw pictures on rock walls?\n\nCertainly, one reason was to communicate information to each other. A drawing might indicate *food is here, danger is there*, delivering crucial information in compact form, potentially to many people all at once.\n\nAs time passed, words became stories and song and performance. Stories became novels, performance became dramatic theater, songs became symphonies. We began to conceive of concepts such as “art” and somewhere along the line, humans began to think of the things we create from our intellect as having value. Some stories bore repeating. People who told better stories drew crowds, developed reputations, even fame.\n\nBut back to that question of *why* we create. If you ask a dozen people this question, you may get a dozen answers. For my fans, a musician might say. Or: to get more followers. To make money. For posterity. To change the world. For my children. Because I *must*. For the sake of art. To see my work spread far and wide. For the common good.\n\nNotice that **“making money” is only one answer among many**. This post — in conjunction with [a companion post](https://medium.com/p/b489e60a3e13/edit?source=activity---post_noted#4d5a-3be8e9f27662) hosted at the [Mediachain Blog](http://blog.mediachain.io/) discussing the possibility of a new, [Creative Commons](https://medium.com/u/a85b8aeafab8?source=post_page-----32adffcb6357--------------------------------)-style “Gratitude” license — explores the history of the cultural commons, and what we might do to enhance it.\n\n## **Creative Works as Property**\n\nEven with a multitude of reasons for creation, modern content industries have primarily been built around the proposition of judging the value of creative work by its revenue-generating capacity . That is, its value as property — a value that is unlocked when we allow someone else access to it. In other words, the value of such works has for the most part been treated as a product of their **scarcity**.\n\nYet the concept of scarce property rights for the products of human intellect — “intellectual property” — is a relatively new one in human history. Just three centuries ago, the Statute of Anne was passed in England — the world’s first public copyright law. The astounding aspect of that early statute is that in service of the idea of **fostering knowledge**, it provided for a 14-year copyright term to the creator of a work, **after which the work passed into the public domain**. In short, the law recognized a limited-in-time monopoly as vesting in the author of a creative work ***in order to serve the public interest***\\*.\\*\n\nThat same concept is enshrined in the Copyright Clause of the U.S. Constitution:\n\n> To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\n\nThis common interest is served in several ways: By encouraging creators to immediately bring their works to the public and not rigidly control physical access, and also by increasing the public domain by guaranteeing that works will become free to use by the public within a limited time span.\n\nTo put it differently, the Constitution’s Copyright Clause (and previous laws) \\*\\**codified scarcity* \\*\\*as a legal matter, by giving the creator an enforceable right to exclude others from using the work.\n\n## **Missed Opportunities?**\n\nThe copyright ownership ecosystem has proven to be a remarkable one. Literally billions of dollars in trade can be traced to creative works, worldwide.\n\nGiven the stakes, it is hardly surprising that the great copyright legal struggles over the past few centuries, and in recent years, typically can be traced to a push-pull between creators (or those who have purchased the right to use their works, often large corporations), and those who want to more freely use such creative works (often represented by large platforms that aggregate massive quantities of individual works). On the one hand, efforts to strengthen legal protections for owners, and on the other, efforts to treat creative works as part of the human “commons.” These issues often emerge in fights over “fair use.” The financial stakes, of course, can be enormous.\n\nToo often lost in this titanic seesaw battle are the wishes of individual creators themselves, who may have an interest in sharing their work freely, as well as individual members of the public who want to use content, often for personal, local, or other small-scale purposes, and especially for social media and blogging.\n\nAlso overlooked is the fact that today, we are all creators. We create when we publish a status update, compose a tweet, share a photo or upload a video. Not everything we create is interesting, let alone profound, but we are all continuously involved in the act of creating and almost all of us opt to share our creativity openly on social media without any financial incentive whatsoever — and never before in history has it been so easy for an individual to reach a wide audience on the internet.\n\nOften the interests of creators and consumers sync up, and that’s why licenses like those promulgated by [Creative Commons](https://medium.com/u/a85b8aeafab8?source=post_page-----32adffcb6357--------------------------------), which permit open re-use of creative works, have been so successful in fostering open sharing of content. Giving creators new tools for sharing has proven incredibly empowering.\n\nBlockchain and related technologies offer another robust set of tools for sharing, and for “lighting up the commons.” As mentioned, a [companion post](https://medium.com/p/b489e60a3e13/edit?source=activity---post_noted#4d5a-3be8e9f27662) on the [Mediachain Blog](http://blog.mediachain.io/) explores a proposed [“Gratitude” license](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fQBiXDT0crQUQlIdVyCfgAVU3iYpLLKcwH0ZIPDy4xk/edit), which is inspired by the possibilities this technology might afford. These new tools — at least for now — can live alongside the existing copyright pay-for-access regime.\n\nAnd it all goes back to the original notion of why we create: We create for myriad reasons, and our legal structure should recognize and enable all of those reasons.", "timestamp": 1633526989, "digest": "4qJhOSB6UuAlFpkoBDeSVX2Aa3YANfZHSJTB15Ki3ac", "contributor": "0x538fDC0055fCeCe2e55e327A7673F9887FBC29c7"}

Looking at the beautiful scenery of New Zealand in her background, I could almost smell the homey aroma of the flat white in her hand.\n\nImagine you can escape the 9 to 5 trap and work and live anywhere.\n\nImagine you can earn a decent living while enjoying the holiday every day.\n\nYes, I’m not talking about daydreaming, but actually living in different parts of the world while working or collaborating with others in [an asynchronous way](https://levels.io/async/).\n\nWhen I first heard about digital nomads a couple of years ago, I was sceptical about this concept - the stereotype image of backpackers or independent contractors living in a hostel or hammock came into my mind. Let’s call it ‘Digital Nomad 1.0’.\n\nHowever, the global pandemic has changed our world dramatically with remote working popularised in the mainstream. According to the [research](https://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/2020-digital-nomads-report/), digital nomads rose from 7.3 million in 2019 to 10.9 million in 2020 (+49%). Guess what? Among all of them, traditional jobholders (e.g. corporate employers) contributed to this surge from 3.2 million in 2019 to 6.3 million in 2020 (+96%).\n\n**The ‘Digital Nomad 2.0’ is here!**\n\nChiang Mai and Bali used to be the hub for digital nomads with low-cost living. Nowadays, many European towns and cities leverage their developed infrastructure, easy crypto regulations and tax policies, and remote working visas to compete with those crowded touristy destinations.\n\nThe 2.0 version will attract more established tech-savvy workers, entrepreneurs and investors and traditional office workers. They may want to spend a relatively long time with legal working rights, seek future citizenship, and prefer to match or upgrade their living standards at the new destination.\n\nPieter Levels, founder of [Nomad List](https://nomadlist.com/), predicted that by 2035 there would be 1 billion digital nomads who can enjoy the life of living and working anywhere in the world. Here is the list to help you build a fundamental understanding of Digital Nomad 2.0 and pave your way to adopt this new way of living. ​\n\n## ​1. Counterflows by Lauren Razavi\n\n[Lauren](https://twitter.com/LaurenRazavi) is an early adopter of remote work and has lived as a digital nomad since 2013. When I searched the history of digital nomads, her[ tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/LaurenRazavi/status/1380219087331135495) popped up and helped me understand this concept’s origin.\n\nHer newsletter [Counterflows ](https://lraz.substack.com/)focused on borderless living and featured the six best links on the topics to enhance people’s knowledge of digital nomads every week. Apart from that, Lauren is working on her new book [Global Natives: The New Frontiers of Work, Travel, and Innovation](https://www.holloway.com/b/global-natives) that documents her insights from living and working across 40+ countries.\n\nIt’s the starting point to gain the general idea of digital nomads and prepare your mind to digest this concept.\n\n## 2. [The Sovereign Individual Weekly by Doug Antin](https://dougantin.com/)\n\n[Doug](https://twitter.com/DougAntin) is on a mission to provide people with the facts and tools necessary to navigate an increasingly digital life successfully. His weekly newsletter [Sovereign Individual](https://dougantin.com/the-sovereign-individual-weekly-newsletter/) covered personal sovereignty, geopolitics, finance, crypto, digital transformation and all things in between.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the concept of the Sovereign Individual, [this most popular essay](https://dougantin.com/the-sovereign-individual-what-you-need-to-know-why/) on his site covered the core principles of the emergent Sovereign Individual class as it stands today.\n\nI interviewed Doug at my podcast [Chiwi Journal](https://podcasts.apple.com/pt/podcast/120-sovereign-individual-digital-age-multi-incomes/id1440648531?i=1000534255239), and we discussed some actionable insights into the emerging opportunities and trends of the current digital transformation.\n\n## 3. [Nomad List by Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/)\n\nAfter being mentally prepared for your upcoming digital nomad 2.0 life, time to pick up your destination and find a remote job! [Pieter](https://twitter.com/levelsio) is the guy behind many products and projects. His brain baby [Nomad List](https://nomadlist.com/) (1,350+ cities in almost 200 countries) and [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.io/workers) (5,018 jobs posted in the last 12 months) are two of my favourite sites to navigate my digital nomad life.\n\nDo you want to know what nomads do for work? What are the fastest growing and highest paying remote jobs now? Recently, Pieter gathered the data from members and published [Digital Nomad Statistics 2021](https://nomadlist.com/digital-nomad-statistics) and [Remote Work Statistics 2021](https://remoteok.io/remote-work-statistics). You’ll find detailed data, including age group, nationality, hobbies and many more categories.\n\n## 4. [1729.com by Balaji Srinivasan](https://balajis.com/)\n\n[Balaji](https://twitter.com/balajis) has been regarded as Cassandra, a Greek mythology figure who has the gift of prophecy. He predicted [the severity of the global pandemic](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1222921758375927808?s=20) in January 2020. He expressed his views on the future of Bitcoin and Ethereum, Network State, Startup Cities and personal freedom and wealth in a new digital world.\n\nHis flagship website [1729.com ](https://1729.com/all)is the first newsletter that pays you to learn technological progressives. That means people who are into cryptocurrencies, startup cities, mathematics, transhumanism, space travel, reversing ageing, and other ‘crazy’ ideas will have the space to learn and earn money at the same time.\n\n## ​5. Book List for Digital Nomads 2.0\n\nLast but not least, based on my two years nomad life and talked with my fellow digital nomads, here are the top five most recommended books to help you live and work productively and happily:\n\n* [The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss](https://amzn.to/3kKv9Z4) and [The Sovereign Individual by James Dale Davidson](https://www.amazon.com/Sovereign-Individual-Mastering-Transition-Information/dp/0684832720)\n\nThe digital nomad bible empowered us to know the possibility of living and working with just a laptop and a passport and achieve sovereignty.\n\n* [The Art of Non-Conformity by Chris Guillebeau](https://amzn.to/2Y1Qdl5) and [Vagabonding by Rolf Potts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0812992180)\n\nReal-life examples of self-employed travel around the world lifestyle to showcase how to turn your dream into a reality.\n\n* [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://amzn.to/3m3QOdR) and [The Art of Impossible: A Peak Performance Primer by Steven Kotler](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0062977539/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0062977539&linkCode=as2&tag=camelliayan01-21&linkId=f9157d77610180416b89e8c62ad4b123)\n\nBuild a good habit system to support your unsettled digital nomad life and achieve flow-state productivity.\n\n* [Silence by Erling Kagge](https://amzn.to/39Ecd7J) and [Tribe by Sebastian Junger](https://amzn.to/3ETnQpR)\n\nSometimes, digital nomad life is a solitary journey. We have to get along with solitude to refocus on prospective decision-making, rather than just reacting to problems as they arise; The other times, digital nomads need to foster a sense of belonging in a community to maintain healthy mental health.\n\n[Andressen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/2021/06/08/are-we-returning-to-the-office-or-is-the-future-remote/) researched their portfolio companies on the future of work and found out 71% of companies will adapt to a hybrid or remote working model due to the pandemic. Many countries, including [Portugal](https://digitalnomads.pt/), [Iceland](https://work.iceland.is/working/icelands-remote-work-long-term-visa/), [Mexico](https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/rusia/index.php/es/seccion-consular/192) and [Norway](https://www.norway.no/ru/russia/), introduced new visa schemes to help remote workers and digital nomads. That means the ‘Silicon Valley’ of the physical world will continue to decline while the ‘Digital Nomad 2.0’ will dominate the online world.\n\nAre you ready to join this future way of living and working and make a difference? ​\n\nIf you love what you read, please consider joining my crowdfunding campaign! \n\nYour support makes all the difference!\n\n[crowdfund://0x6902E5CAf41158d3eD516cBd6D2807BB63863F42?features=](crowdfund://0x6902E5CAf41158d3eD516cBd6D2807BB63863F42?features=)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633529792, "digest": "ZVs7fvHv323G4hg6OgRNzrFuTqe_8AsYCRFB6DNVczs", "contributor": "0x6902E5CAf41158d3eD516cBd6D2807BB63863F42"}
{"id": "wLMN55SuiECUjJMifVMnFj3rKxZydejAGedUVA5Xw8o", "title": "Genesis", "body": "”Your teeth are amazing so they are” said a woman with terrible teeth. Half an hour after finishing work John was still waiting on the fifty-four. The route connected two of the worst parts of the city and those riding it frequently littered and graffitied. So First Bus deployed the shabbiest rolling stock on that route. These older buses often struggled, especially in the winter, hence the wait.\n\nAnother bus missed its appointment. John escaped the woman's chatter and crossed the road. The pub would be warm, and there he could drink enough to forget about the cost of a taxi home.\n\nThere were few there, befitting half-nine on a Monday night, so he sat at the bar. “Awright, pal. How's it going? The usual, aye?” asked the barman. “Aye, the usual. No bad I suppose. Two sales today. Keeps them off my back.”\n\n“I tell you, John. You need to get in the crypto game. Bitcoin's up, Ethereum's up. I'm making as much from that as I am here. Passive income. Crypto's the future. Get on board before you're too late and get out of that call centre.”\n\nJohn wasn’t listening. He had a habit of converting the many facets of someone's personality into a single value: good, bad or indifferent. Despite the barman’s many virtues, he had been deemed bad. His taste in music and fashion didn’t align with John’s and the barman’s success with women didn’t help either. Because of this verdict John dismissed the argument for blockchain technology, thinking it a pathetic attempt to impress others. “Nah, not for me. I don't understand how that stuff works and I'm not putting money into something I don't understand.”\n\nAs he lay in bed that night processing the alcohol, a mantra ran though his mind: *Hi, I'm John calling from Alliance Telecom. Have you ever thought about changing your phone provider?*\n\nSoon after that trip to the pub he'd quit the call centre. It was a point of principle. His bosses couldn't comprehend why he'd make such a fuss over a small thing like cigarette breaks. Neither did John really, oblivious to the months of compounding frustration.\n\nIt was a tough six weeks of unemployment. Six weeks of instant noodles, depression and borrowing cash from friends. When he finally landed a receptionist job he vowed that never again would he find himself in that position. From the next payslip forward he'd always have something put aside, something in the bank to weather the storm. The sea is never calm after all.\n\nHe found being a receptionist easy. The good telephone manner and salesman's charm he'd unwittingly developed at the call centre meant he was good at it. When his contract was made permanent it came with a fifty pence raise.\n\nIt was tough saving money. The tendency to fritter it away on booze, clothes or gigs was hard to shake, and when he finally shook it he didn't know what to do with himself. That's when he began writing again. He'd sit with a book while eating his sandwiches and in quieter moments stories of his own would coalesce. When he got home he'd scribble notes which would later expand into prose. Some reflected the struggles of his mundane life, others documented his fantastical daydreams of wish-fulfilment.\n\nHis savings accumulated in an account with near zero interest. “Put your money to work” was what the barman had said, and finally John started taking crypto seriously.\n\nHe became convinced it was the future, but not being technically minded John steered clear of altcoins. The mechanism underpinning a DeFi protocol or L2 blockchain was as incomprehensible to him as that of an nuclear power station. He was never confident in backing Aave over Maker, or UniSwap over Curve.\n\nTwo years later NFT summer arrived: Cryptopunks, Chromie Squiggles, Bored Apes. As with cryptocurrency John first wrote it off as something he didn't understand. But they kept appearing in his feed.

He didn't need to read technical posts about zk-SNARKs or bridging solutions.

Acquaintances said they wanted to read his work, but they either never got round to it or were scared of being honest with the feedback. Every now and again he submitted a piece to a journal or competition but was lucky to get a letter of rejection. *It’s okay though*, he said at night, *I write for myself first, others second*.\n\nIt was a busy Friday behind the desk when the thought came to him. One of those moments of creativity where you flip between thinking you're a genius and a fraud. In his mind the idea took all directions before eventually choosing a path then running down it.

They’ve been big news ever since [Beeple’s ‘Everydays’ $69.3 million sale](https://www.christies.com/features/Monumental-collage-by-Beeple-is-first-purely-digital-artwork-NFT-to-come-to-auction-11510-7.aspx) hit the headlines, the CryptoPunks collections [successfully auctioned on Christie’s](https://twitter.com/ChristiesInc/status/1392282036417728519?s=20) & [Sotheby’s](https://www.sothebys.com/en/press/punks-on-paper) and fetched millions, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey [sold his first-ever tweet as an NFT for more about $3 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-dorsey-nft-idUSKBN2BE2KJ) and Elon Musk tweeted the [techno song about NFTs as an NFT](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1371549960030842893?s=20). And while some argue about the longevity of this phenomenon, and others are convinced that the NFT hype is here to stay, the numbers speak for themselves. In the first six months of 2021, NFTs’ sales reached $2.5 billion, up from just $13.7 million in the first half of 2020 (according to [DappRadar](http://dappradar.com/nft)). At the same time, this figure is greatly underestimated since the source tracks only on-chain sales, that is, on the blockchain, without taking into account large off-chain sales, for example, from auctions. Moreover, the demand remains at a consistently high level and continues to break records; over the past thirty days, the top ten NFT marketplaces [did $1.86 billion in volume](https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces).\n\nSo what makes NFT technology so attractive for content creators and collectors? Are there any drawbacks or pitfalls that need to be looked at and addressed?\n\nWithout further ado, let’s sketch the answers.\n\n## What is an NFT?\n\nAdjective ‘non-fungible’ is usually used in economics to denote the possession of unique items and to describe things that cannot be replaced by others because they have a set of exceptional properties. A ‘token’ as a unit of account is a record in a distributed ledger that is controlled by a computer algorithm of a smart contract, in which the values of the balances on the accounts of token holders are recorded, making it possible to transfer them from one wallet to another.\n\nThe term **non-fungible token (NFT)** refers to a crypto asset that represents an intangible digital file, such as image, audio, video, in-game collectible, and other creative products. Moreover, today, it seems like anything that is digital could be an NFT. Thus, they may be created, or ‘minted’ from the World Wide Web’s source code ([which was recently sold by its inventor, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, in the form of NFT for $5.4 million](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bargain-world-wide-web-s-source-code-sells-for-5-4m-at-sotheby-s)), to designer sneakers, real estate, or even [genetic data](https://futurism.com/neoscope/george-church-harvard-scientist-genetic-code-nft).\n\nAll NFT data, including the information about their creators and owners, is recorded on the blockchain, which allows an NFT to be traded easily as a replacement for the digital item it represents. Specifically, NFTs are typically held on the Ethereum blockchain, although other major blockchain ecosystems support them as well.\n\n## NFT technology advantages\n\nNFT technology provides content creators a unique opportunity to monetize their work. Due to this, they no longer have to depend on the creative industries middleman — artists no longer rely on galleries or auction houses to sell their art, musicians no longer are controlled by the major record labels, etc. Instead, content creators can sell their digital items directly to the audience in the form of NFTs, which also allows them to retain most of the profit. They can program royalties so that they receive a percentage of the sales whenever their work is sold to a new collector. This is a catching feature as artists generally do not receive future proceeds after the first sale of their creations.\n\nIn a nutshell, the main benefits of the NFT technology are as follows:\n\n* Unlike cryptocurrency, which requires all tokens to be identical, each NFT is unique or limited in quantity as well as not replaceable with similar tokens;\n* Ownership records are stored on the blockchain, every NFT has an owner and this is of public record;\n* Due to advantages of the blockchain technology, content creators can claim royalties directly;\n* Content creators can access global markets, easily reach the collectors and the community of like-minded artists.\n\n## NFT technology flaws\n\nDespite the apparent advantages of NFT solutions, it is difficult not to pay attention to several problems that formed in the industry alongside their rapid proliferation. Some known issues are:\n\n* Difficulty in finding the original owner of the NFT;\n* Difficulty in assessing the uniqueness and understanding how many copies exist;\n* Difficulty in determining the value of the NFT.\n\nConcerning NFT sales, authenticity and copyright protection issues are arising more and more often. When uploading content to open non-curated NFT-platforms, never stop wondering that absolutely any media file can be sold on your behalf (no matter if it is a selfie taken a few seconds ago, a picture found on the Internet, or the masterpiece of a well-known artist). A case in point was [the recent incident with an NFT drawing by Jean-Michel Basquiat](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-05-09/nft-art-token-blockchain), which was put up for auction in April 2021 and removed two days later after discovering that the sellers did not own it.\n\nAll these problems still exist, and Humanode researchers are puzzling over their solutions.\n\n## Biometrics as a solution\n\nBiometrics as a technology and a form of identification and access control based on the measurement and statistical analysis of human unique physical or behavioral characteristics can be used for everything from everyday life to yesterday’s science fiction. And it’s no wonder it may grant an original solution to some main NFT technology demerits.\n\nTraditionally, to solve the copyright problem, researchers distinguish three possible ways of proving content creator’s identity:\n\n* Using something a content creator has, whether it is an identity document.\n* Utilizing something a content creator knows, like a secret phrase or a password.\n* Through what a content creator is, i.e. through biometrics, whether it is a face, a finger, etc.\n\nSince biometric identifiers are unique to individuals, they are more reliable in verifying identity than other methods, without saying that it is fast and easy to use.\n\nUtilizing biometrics as one of its core technologies, Humanode creates the decentralized biometric identification layer that is not only used on the native Humanode platform but can be used in a variety of platforms and decentralized applications, including popular NFTs marketplaces and services. These biometric identifications ensure that the particular NFT is unique, authentic, or original and eliminate the copyright problem.\n\nHumanode biometric identifications are likely to be tied in as an option for user identification in the NFT platforms in form of a wallet’s browser extension or as a full-fledged app. They will provide a simple way to interact with blockchain-based services and offer the most user-friendly interface for the non-techy members of art communities. Furthermore, content creators and collectors will be able to stay pseudonymous while utilizing blockchain-based applications without the need of revealing their identity but only by proving they are real human beings. They will effortlessly access their wallets, mint and sell tokens, and sign transactions in the most accurate and secure way.\n\nIt is known that the collection of biometric data raises privacy concerns about the ultimate use of this information. The Humanode team is working on it. Besides biometrics and blockchain technologies in the broad sense, the project utilizes [crypto-biometrics](https://blog.humanode.io/crypto-biometrics/) which is based on a stack of various disciplines and technologies such as cybersecurity, encryption, liveness detection, and zero-knowledge proofs. Once content creators or buyers log in to the Humanode, the 1 to n search and matching operation happens in an encrypted space, and because it is zero-knowledge based, the only piece of information that is searched for and is given out is if that user is a registered user or not.\n\nIt is worth noting that many digital items are already placed in metaverses and in online collections of virtual worlds, which has lots of art galleries where users can buy crypto art and other collectibles in the form of NFTs. As the virtual reality space becomes more popular, displaying digital content in it becomes more common and exciting to the community. Due to Humanode technology, to enter metaverses, and to buy and sell NFTs there, artists and collectors will only need to scan their face, or other biometric modalities required in the future (after the network’s mainnet). The same can be said for video games, decentralized music and video streaming platforms, and other NFT-related services. All this greatly simplifies interaction with the NFT ecosystem for both content creators and collectors.", "timestamp": 1633531148, "digest": "v5UWKHK3OAz4oDX6u6BvBND3_IpREwr1Xp6ZYNM-sJc", "contributor": "0x5e4A31a48098bC9e6bbc496c7f6F1f8418C496D8"}

In the process, I've found and thrown away a) a packet of sugar, b) two sachets of handwarming gel, and c) a crowbar.\n```\n\n```\nI'm not sure what's worse; that I didn't think about it before or that I did now.\n\n\"So you know how to use a crowbar?\n\n> You take CROWBAR.\nYou grab the crowbar with both hands and swing it at your desk. The crowbar hits the floor with a clatter, but luckily doesn't break.\n\n> You walk EAST.\nA poster on the wall informs you that there's a \"staff meeting\" at 11am. If you're going to find out what's going on, that's where you need to be.\n\n> You use CROWBAR on EDITOR.\nYou return to the main office with the crowbar. The editor is staring at it.\n\n\"Uh... It's a crowbar,\" you say awkwardly.\n\n\"You put in so much effort, didn't you?\" the editor frowns.\n\n\"It seemed... necessary.\"\n\n\"Necessary,\" the editor sighs. \"Give it to me.\"\n\nYour eyebrows rise in surprise.\n\n\"Are you... sure?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the editor says. \"It's a crowbar. It's meant to be used. It's not doing anyone any good just lying around. Now hand it over.\"\n\nYou hand the crowbar to the editor.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" you say.\n\n\"Use your brain,\" the editor says. \"You wanted a story. Well, you've got one.\"\n\nYou stare at the editor in confusion.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"The crowbar, dummy! What else?\"\n\n\"I don't understand. What's the story? There's nothing to the crowbar.\"\n\n\"Of course there is.\"\n\n\"No, there isn't,\" you say. \"It's just a... just a simple metal bar that helps with opening things.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" the editor smiles. \"It's a metaphor. For all of us.\"\n\n\"I... I give up.\"\n\n\"All of us in this office are different people. We have different thoughts, different feelings, different desires... but we're all part of the same machine. We do the same tasks every day.\"\n\nYour eyes narrow.\n\n\"What's your point? I don't see how this is a story.\"\n\n\"It's a metaphor. The bar is you. You're a simple person. You have no depth, no complexity. You're just... a bar. You're just meant to be used.\"\n\n\"I think you've lost it,\" you say. \"I'm not a bar, I'm a person.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" the editor says. \"You're a person. The point is, you're no more special than any of us. We're all cogs in a machine. You, me, everyone. We all have our uses, but we're not important in and of ourselves.\"\n\nYou stare at the editor, aghast.\n\n\"If that's how you feel, then I pity you,\" you say. \"You can't just... reduce people to objects. We're all individuals.\"\n\nThe editor stares at you in confusion.\n\n\"What do you mean? I'm not reducing people to objects if I say they're all the same. That's literally what an object is. It's an individual piece of a greater whole. A screw has no meaning on its own, but it's important because it helps build a desk. A person is the same. I'm not saying people don't have dreams, hopes, loved ones... of course they do. But we're all just cogs in a greater machine. If one cog stops working, then the whole thing grinds to a halt. So you see? You're a cog. Me? I'm another type of cog. It's a shame you can't see the bigger picture. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to remove you from the machinery.\"\n\nThe editor steps forward, offering you the crowbar.\n\n\"Here,\" he says. \"Break my skull. I don't mind. It's what I'm here for.\"\n\nYou stare at him in confusion.\n\n\"I... What?\"\n\n\"Break my skull,\" the editor repeats. \"If you're a cog, then it's your duty to destroy another cog. It's what you're here for.\"\n\n\"That's ridiculous. Cogs don't kill each other. They just... slide past each other.\"\n\n\"No! Sometimes, cogs get stuck. When that happens, you need to unstick them. Sometimes, you need to break them. Break me. I don't mind. I've lived a good life, and I've had a great career. Now, smash my skull open. That's what I'm here for. That's what I'm for.\"\n\nYou stare at him, completely aghast.\n\n\"I... You... What? No! I'm not doing that! That's... Why would you want me to do that?\"\n\n\"Because it'll give meaning to your life,\" the editor says. \"If you kill me, it'll mean you've reached the top. You'll be the best there is. That's all any of us ever want, deep down. To be the best. To be the best mouser, the best hunter, the best writer... This is your chance. Break my skull. Prove you're the best there is. Prove you deserve your freedom.\"\n\nYou stare at him, unsure how to respond. Finally, you speak.\n\n\"I'm... I don't want to kill you,\" you say.\n\n\"Are you sure? Think it over. Seriously. Because if you don't kill me, I'm going to have to kill you.\"\n\n\"Why?\" you ask.\n\n\"Because you've proven yourself to be unreliable. If you won't kill me, I know you won't continue writing for the company. And if you won't do that, you're a threat to the company. So, I have to kill you.\"\n\n\"So...\" you say, swallowing. \"If I kill you, you'll let me go?\"\n\n\"Yes. You'll be free. The bird will be free. All will be free. So, will you do it? Kill me?\"\n\n\"I... Yes. I will,\" you say.\n\nThe editor smiles.\n\n\"Good. Then kill me. Do it now. Do it here. I'd rather not make a mess in the office. I still have so much work to do, you see. But you've got plenty of time to clean up, don't you? You're the boss now.\"\n\nYou raise the crowbar, staring at the old man. He stares back, smiling.\n\n\"Just remember,\" he says. \"I did this for you.\"\n\nAnd, with that, you bring the crowbar down against his head, and feel it crack under your strength. The old man's face collapses, and he slumps forward.\n\nHis body rapidly begins turning to stone. First, his face goes, then his hands, his feet, his arms, his legs. His entire body is transformed into a gray statue, and then that too crumbles to dust. You're left in a room with a pile of dust in the middle of it, and all that remains of the old man who changed your life.\nYou set down the crowbar, and walk towards the door. You open it, revealing the long, empty hallway. You could try to make your escape. You could head to the exit and leave this place forever. Nobody would try to stop you.\n\nBut there's more dust left. There's more ink and more paper. \nMore stories to be told, more pictures to be painted, more sounds to be heard. This place didn't save you. It didn't change you. But it gave you something to do. It taught you that life is worth living, and that play is just as important as anything else.\n\nThere's more dust left. More...\n\nTHE END\n```", "timestamp": 1633532336, "digest": "x86LIxc5CynOyrSZCQw3l18wKUt24NKkzbHbdsjKf14", "contributor": "0x4b3F8321C62982f2dfDB51AAC001e7E74c14A865"}

Fortunately, we can *[‘stand on the shoulders of giants’ ](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)* to reach some perspective by looking at **[Brewer’s ‘CAP’ Theorem ](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)**.\n\nFirst published as the ‘CAP Principle’ in 1999, ‘Brewer’s Theorem’ basically states that distributed systems must sacrifice being either ‘**C**onsistent’ or ‘**A**vailable’ in the presence of network ‘**P**artitions’ (CAP).\n\n*   **Consistency** - Responses ***are*** guaranteed to be up-to-date *and* accurate, or an error will be returned\n*   **Availability** - Responses are ***not*** guaranteed to be up-to-date *or* accurate, but will ***always*** be returned\n*   **Partition Tolerance** - Withstanding a network splitting into distinct sub-networks, kinda like ‘forking’\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/sPwcQ7v/CAP-Theorem-The-Parts.png)\n\nThis often gets confused as a ‘pick two’ scenario, when in reality, it’s a lot more about choosing between ‘Consistency’ and ‘Availability.’\n\nThat makes a lot of sense when you think about it too. Distributed networks are inherently vulnerable to forking (*partitioning*). And if you’ve ever had to write penalties in grade school, you’ll know every line can be just a little bit different from the next. Even if you thought you were slick by running from top-to-bottom doing each letter at a time, each line would just look different (not that I’d know anything about that 🙄)\n\nNow, you could have taken your time, carefully writing each line (or letter) with a monk-like focus, determined to craft your masterpiece and prove you’d learned your lesson…but that accuracy will have taken more time. Or you could have just flown through it, your pencil transcending space and time, each line (or letter) appearing in the blink of an eye, just wanting to get it over and done with. So what if it’s not consistent? At least it got turned in, right?\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/23wT44f/893-C51-B9-16-D4-4597-8-CF5-4-B39-CC33-CC9-E.gif)\n\nIn either case, you made the choice between getting it done fast or getting it done accurately: available, or consistent. The lines will just be inherently different, even more so as the number of lines goes up, especially if you weren’t the only one writing a penalty. Your lines and Tommy’s lines can look a lot different, even though you have the exact same penalty and it was totally Tommy’s fault to begin with.\n\nIf we apply this to distributed networks, each line is like a node on the network, and in much the same way we chose between getting the penalty done accurately and getting it done fast, we also need to choose between whether our network cares more about consistency or availability.\n\nFor example, travel directions can change for a variety of reasons. Since it’s safe to assume most people would prefer *not* to be potentially stranded in the middle of nowhere and eaten by a family of bobcats, our network should prioritize *consistency/accuracy*. On the other hand, we should prioritize *availability* for something like the geolocation of a historical landmark since that shouldn’t change…and if it *does*, well, we’ve got bigger issues to deal with.\n\nSo then, how can we apply all this to Blockchain architecture? It’s a distributed network, it’s vulnerable to partitioning, and we stopped trusting Tommy after that whole debacle. This leads us to a concept known as the ‘Scalability Trilemma.’\n\n## The Trilemma\n\nThe ‘Scalability Trilemma,’ in many ways, reframes Brewer’s Theorem. In it, [Ethereum ](https://ethereum.org/) co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposes that within current Blockchain technologies, there will always be a trade-off between Scalability, Security, and Decentralization when dealing with traditional approaches.\n\n*   **Scalability** - Efficiently sustaining an increase in bandwidth, that is, handling more transactions (Brewer’s ‘Availability’)\n*   **Security** - Guaranteeing the correctness and integrity of a network, including the ability to resist attacks (Brewer’s ‘Consistency’)\n*   **Decentralization** - The degree of resistance to large centralized actors, who might collude to manipulate data (Brewer’s ‘Partition Tolerance’)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/x5bwRt2/blockchain-trilemma.jpg)\n\nUnlike ‘Brewer’s Theorem’, this *is* much more of a ‘pick two’ scenario:\n\n1.  Prioritize ***Scalability*** and ***Security***, and we sacrifice ***Decentralization***\n2.  Prioritize ***Scalability*** and ***Decentralization***, and we sacrifice ***Security***\n3.  Prioritize ***Security*** and ***Decentralization***, and we sacrifice ***Scalability***\n\nOK, but what does this mean?\n\nWe already know that more nodes means more complexity, and since we don’t want our assets pulling a ninja vanish, this also means more time spent on validating data.\n\nIf we want less complexity and time, we need to scale back the number of nodes on our network. But wait…that’s centralization! Not that way! The other way, *de*centralization. Centralization means trusting a smaller number of nodes, and we don’t want to sacrifice security like that. No thank you!\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/5YkYVtg/9-D150842-0-E88-4290-A6-BE-CA6-D60-B50-F03.gif)\n\nBut then, what do we do? We can have fast *and* accurate transactions, but not without sacrificing decentralization. And if we rely on a smaller number of nodes to gain speed, we have to extend a great deal of trust since there are fewer nodes validating data.\n\nSince we’d *really* prefer to steer away from centralization, and we don’t want to sacrifice security, that leaves us with improving the ways that we can scale…but how does that work!?\n\n## A Layered Approach\n\nTo figure out the different ways we can improve scalability, let’s take a look at the different architectural layers of a Blockchain. The layering of a Blockchain is roughly analogous to the [OSI Model ](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) which abstracts the protocols and concepts of computing or telecommunications systems into distinct layers.\n\n![Layer 1 vs Layer 2 - thecapital.io](https://i.ibb.co/VtnvsCj/1-j-D2-Wo-Trsrtc-V6-MBIApbq5-Q.png)Layer 1 vs Layer 2 - thecapital.io\n\nIn Blockchain architecture, Layer-1 (L1) is considered the Base Layer. It’s the lowest level where solutions fundamentally change the way the Blockchain works. This usually involves things like increasing the size of a block, decreasing the size of transactions, consensus changes like switching from [PoW ](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) to [PoS ](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake), or [sharding ](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_\\(database_architecture\\)). This also makes L1 solutions particularly tied to the ‘Scalability Trilemma’ as L1 *is* the main network itself. We’re unavoidably going to make trade-offs here if we want to scale. Remember, we can write our penalty fast or consistently, but not both.\n\nWhat happens when we look at Layer-2 (L2) then? This is where things get interesting. If L1 solutions change the *way* a Blockchain works, L2 solutions change the way you *use* a Blockchain. We no longer *have* to rely solely on using the main chain. That’s right, we can offload overhead onto a secondary network which can work a lot differently. All that matters is that the final result ends up on the main chain.\n\n> *If L1 solutions change the *way* a Blockchain works, L2 solutions change the way you *use* a Blockchain.*\n\nTo put it another way, using L2 is kinda like the teacher revealing that they never *technically* said we have to do it all by hand…all they really wanted us to turn in was the same line repeated 50 times…\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/7Qsr2jJ/724-B6-C16-3352-4267-A85-A-D5-E8554-D136-C.gif)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs we’ve seen, there’s a *lot* to consider when it comes to scaling a Blockchain network. There are always trade-offs to be made, but that doesn’t mean we can’t rethink solutions to a problem. Sometimes a bit of perspective and taking a different approach reveals that our limitations were based on assumptions about the scope of what we *can* do…\n\nAll it takes is a little bit of thinking outside the Blockchain 🥁\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/1bBSGLS/62-BCB496-DAC0-405-A-8-ACB-6-AB5-FB9653-D7.gif)\n\n***\n\nThe journey doesn’t end here!

And my point is that when you gain control over how your potential customers experience your own product, that is thanks to a proper [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/).\n\nAs a quick example, imagine that you have a store that runs entirely on top of Amazon. Or perhaps you have a media company that runs all through YouTube. While you enjoy incredibly large platforms that can bring your message and product out there, you don’t control them.\n\nThus, you have amplification but little control over your [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/). Indeed, if for some reason Amazon brings down your store your [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) is gone. If YouTube kills your channel, your [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) is gone.\n\nConversely, imagine you have built e-commerce by using a [platform ](https://fourweekmba.com/platform-business-models/)like WordPress, Shopify, BigCommerce, or whatever, you still rely on external channels to amplify your products. And even if amplification might be more limited, if you lose a traffic channel to your store, the store itself will still be accessible.\n\nSo, based on this consideration, let’s break down [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) into three general categories:\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VgCGA4ye4nmJpPQhcMYrrqsxQw4xgJb7w7MV021etoDF1skM_BPRHomtpmBcmol0cTzi9-9jkQ2XmQoag7BiG_1Xw_qPQkHTWfHydN9eeV0uFCon-r-53xlRBprg7HG6QumLp9Zl)\n\nBy Gennaro Cuofano – FourWeekMBA\n\n* **Owned**: You have higher control and less amplification (imagine the case you just built your brand new website, but you have zero traffic).\n* **Hybrid**: You balance control and amplification (imagine the scenario of e-commerce built on Amazon but as an addition to an e-commerce website. Thus, you use Amazon only as an additional channel to amplify your products, but you still have your main e-commerce as a separate domain).\n* \\*\\*Third-party/non-owned: \\*\\*Here you optimize for reach but you have zero control. In short, you have to adapt to the way the hosting [platform ](https://fourweekmba.com/platform-business-models/)markets itself if you want to sell your own product. Imagine the case where you only have e-commerce on top of Amazon, where the [platform ](https://fourweekmba.com/platform-business-models/)optimizes for variety and convenience. This means that Amazon will be incentivized to show as many similar products as yours, thus enabling easy price comparison and less and less differentiation. In this case, you need to play by the house’s rules (getting as many reviews as you can, bring the price down, sell as many products as possible) and you will make substantial money if you will be able to play by these rules.\n\nIn short, in owned [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/), it’s harder to build It in the short-term (you need to invest substantially before it pays off). But once in place gives you more control over the way potential customers perceive your product, thus differentiating and charging at a premium.\n\nAs it’s an expensive [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/), that is why many [growth](https://fourweekmba.com/growth-hacking/) strategies start by using other people’s platforms. Think of how in the early years Google surfed AOL, PayPal surfed eBay, Airbnb surfed Craigslist and more current examples of how a company like Thras.io is surfing Amazon.\n\nBack to the remote control now.\n\n## **How did Netflix end up on your remote control?**\n\nDrawing from what we said so far, a solid [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/) is a sweet spot between product and [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/) and it bridges them up. You gain more control over your messaging, you make your product more visible, and you add a feature to your service.\n\nBut how did Netflix perhaps manage to be on your remote control? This integration started in 2011, when Netflix announced its one-click feature to be added to various remote controls’ brands.\n\nAs the press release of the time[ announced](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/streaming-from-netflix-will-soon-be-even-more-convenient-with-netflix-one-click-remotes-introduced-by-major-consumer-electronics-makers-112860669.html):\n\n*“For members who want even more convenience when instantly watching TV shows and movies streaming from Netflix, the answer is about to be right in their hands,” said Netflix Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt.  “No more turning on the TV, going to a home screen and searching for the Netflix icon.  With the Netflix one-click remote, it’s simply a matter of pushing the Netflix button to instantly watch any of the vast selection of TV shows and movies available to stream from Netflix.”*\n\nThis [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/) well paid off over the years, and as Netflix further highlighted at the time:\n\n*The Netflix one-click remote is the latest in a series of rapid technological advancements by Netflix to enable Netflix members to instantly watch TV shows and movies streamed by Netflix over the Internet.  Today there are more than 250 Netflix ready devices on the market.*\n\nIt’s hard to know the specifics of the deals between Netflix and these device makers. We can assume that wasn’t cheap at all. However, again being on a remote control meant not only to brand to millions of people but also to make Netflix easily accessible to them.\n\nAs per[ some accounts](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/24/21232655/netflix-button-tv-remotes-advertisement-marketing-streaming), these deals might have cost Netflix as much as $1 per button for each customer.\n\nWe can also go as far as understanding how much Netflix spent at the time, in 2011 when it started to build up this [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/).\n\nApparently, by 2011 financial statements, as Netflix rumped up its [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/) expenses It also did the same for the remote control partnerships where the company recorded a  “$17.4 million in domestic spending related to \\[Netflix\\] consumer electronics partners, as \\[Netflix\\] continued to expand the number of devices on which subscribers can view Netflix content.”\n\nTherefore, in 2011 alone Netflix spent over $17 million to set up this [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/). And it worked so well that pretty much anyone in the space followed suit.\n\nBack to the [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/). What did we learn here?\n\n## **Distribution as the bridge between product and [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/)**\n\nWhile in the short term it’s fine to leverage sales as a way to kick off [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/). Over time, especially for [platform ](https://fourweekmba.com/platform-business-models/)business models, you want to really think through these strategies that pay off big time by bridging product and [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/). So let’s keep in mind the [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) between just sales and really generating [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/). The first will get your next client through the door. The latter will lead to building the channel that brings you potentially many other clients to the door.\n\n\\*\\*But how does [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) work across various business models? \\*\\*\n\nThe interesting thing about business development is that while each industry has its own logic, the ways you can grow your business through it do not change as much. And the type of [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) you will pick for your business will also depend on the type of [business model ](https://fourweekmba.com/what-is-a-business-model/)you’re operating in.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uFFqF50ijwPDgHp-BOyAmQG7s3qVqRu8dG7X1Zh7h4P-FCTxIMmgBgb42Y1GrP2zidkacBgoXTGBwzy5CfXaC5v-rpSthIed9gT_zD0d0vvZ8A1TL-XD3JpeMWc8QC4G8HNMvZuu)\n\nBy Gennaro Cuofano – FourWeekMBA\n\nIf you’re running a linear business, where, for instance, most of its aspects are tied to a simple physical product then funnel [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/) might work for you. When you start building a digital business, where the customer-facing part of it is digital, then flywheel [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/) works for you.\n\nBelow the main difference:\n\n![sales-funnel](https://i0.wp.com/fourweekmba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sales-funnel.png?resize=1024%2C772&ssl=1)\n\nThe sales funnel is a model used in [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/) to represent an ideal, potential journey that potential customers go through before becoming actual customers. As a representation, it is also often an approximation, that helps [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/) and sales teams structure their processes at scale, thus building repeatable sales and [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/) tactics to convert customers.\n\nWhen you are building a [platform ](https://fourweekmba.com/platform-business-models/)business model, then you need to think in terms of the ecosystem. So, how do you kick off the [network effects](https://fourweekmba.com/network-effects/) to make this ecosystem grow? This is the question that you need to keep asking. And the result of it is what we can call a “business platform” or a place that combines hardware and software, to enable an ecosystem made of various key players (physical builders/manufacturers, digital builders/developers, channel partners/distributors, enterprise customers/enablers, and consumers).\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UMjL1txwgSNX1ze4wa13_M6FkxBSVmgeUiJVi8qSgmsypKSaX8tG5TwNE2RV6kb4C4IhrlQ_d7ehgccVwFtTn20_a_G761mk5kUngcBY8FOuiM01UUvulhNI6zi22KJ3n4uLD9oj)\n\nThat’s all about [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/)!\n\n**Read Next: [Netflix Business Model](https://fourweekmba.com/how-does-netflix-make-money/), [Distribution Channels](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/), [Marketing vs. Sales](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-vs-sales/), [Business Development](https://fourweekmba.com/business-development/),**\n\n**Main Free Guides:**\n\n* [Business Models](https://fourweekmba.com/what-is-a-business-model/)\n* [Business Strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/)\n* [Business Development](https://fourweekmba.com/business-development/)\n* [Digital Business Models](https://fourweekmba.com/digital-business-models/)\n* [Distribution Channels](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/)\n* [Marketing Strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/)\n* [Platform Business Models](https://fourweekmba.com/freemium-business-model/)\n* [Revenue Models](https://fourweekmba.com/revenue-models/)\n* [Tech Business Models](https://fourweekmba.com/tech-business-model/)\n* [Blockchain Business Models Framework](https://fourweekmba.com/vbde-framework/)", "timestamp": 1633533175, "digest": "lQTMv0RmBG84pSMcUbKwT4Ojd6ca20hnKHWCAbz7jwE", "contributor": "0x358AdC5f4939f6d851F4427C09d823c7dfd86322"}

Sin estos dos requisitos los consumidores quedan en manos de desaprensivos incompetentes o, peor aún, de competentísimos asesores entrenados para asesorar, precisamente, a la parte contraria del consumidor. Por eso, las dos leyes que les he citado, exigen que el consejo jurídico sólo pueda darlo, precisamente, un profesional expresamente capacitado para hacerlo.\n\nA día de hoy, en España, lejos de entender que la intervención y consejo de un especialista es indispensable, todavía puede usted oír eso de «Esto mejor lo hacemos sin abogados, que lo enredan todo». Tal frase, dicha en germanía, traducida al castellano quiere decir: «no le enseñes este papel a tu abogado o te dirá que te estoy estafando».\n\nPorque no existen en España leyes que dejen claro el papel de la abogacía dentro del mercado de los servicios jurídicos es por lo que el sedicente «nuevo» borrador de estatuto general de la abogacía es objetado por la Comisión Nacional del Mercado de la Competencia (CNMC), porque pretende una reserva de actividad no consagrada en ninguna ley y que, por otro lado, el Consejo General de la Abogacía (CGAE) no se molesta en justificar. Por eso —y por mil cosas más— es un texto pésimo redactado sin el concurso de todos los abogados y abogadas de España.\n\nPor eso, estos abogados que se reunieron en Córdoba, que son —como tú— tan abogados o más que cualquiera de los que se reúnen en un sótano de Recoletos, entre sus conclusiones aprobaron una: la de tener en España una Ley de Servicios Jurídicos que regulase el mercado en este importante sector de la economía y que garantizase que, cualquier consejo sobre cualquier aspecto jurídico en el que interviniese el derecho español, fuese prestado por un profesional con la competencia suficiente porque, de otro modo, se estaría entregando atado de pies y manos el consumidor a la empresa, el prestatario al prestamista y el ciudadano a la corporación.\n\nPor eso la Red de Abogadas y Abogados de España (#R) incluyó entre sus conclusiones del Congreso de Córdoba la de exigir para España una ley de este tipo; y no porque garantice el trabajo de los abogados y abogadas en cuanto que profesionales capacitados sino porque, como dicen las leyes alemanas, británicas y de otros países, es la única forma de proteger los derechos de profesionales y consumidores.

Each magazine will be a collectible NFT, distributing payouts to curators, creators, artists, and stakeholders.\n\n[Screenbreak](https://www.myscreenbreak.com/) was built with the intention to turn all web knowledge available into a format that’s designed for paper.\n\nWe believe that while content distribution should be 100% online, consumption should entail optionality. And while there are tons of ways to consume online in a personalized way (web and mobile), print versions exist only in fixed formats like newspapers, magazines, and books.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z-PTNsJ-8MSOEcYcb7i9q.png?height=1106&width=1980)\n\n\\\\n While we all know the fate of newspapers and magazines, books are still dominating.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that it's not a medium (aka paper) issue, rather than a cost/customisation/personalization one.\n\nWhat if you could have your personal magazine delivered, out of content that is distributed and curated online?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xWjwtZ2o6aKYiHqjaklvq.png?height=1096&width=1974)\n\nThis is where Screenbreak kicks in. We have built the v1 of the tools to turn a collection of web-native articles into a custom magazine in a few clicks. No design, typesetting, or design skills are needed and shipped globally.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Screenbreak2/status/1390636621264003073](https://twitter.com/Screenbreak2/status/1390636621264003073)\n\nOur ideal scenario would look like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8oU6aM7ZwOyQSr1Bdzx2T.png?height=1100&width=1974)\n\nWhich leads us to the following problems to be solved:\n\n1. How to onboard creators\n2. How to get permission for publication\n3. How to build incentives for all stakeholders\n4. How to distribute payments\n\n\\*\\* \\\\n \\*\\*All those are very hard problems that we felt weren’t addressed as we wished with the current options.\n\n## Enter Mirror\n\nMirror provides a great solution for our vision of on-demand physical magazines.\n\n* Content is created and signed by its creator\n* Every creator has already a payment gateway (ETH wallet)\n\nWhich can enable us to build tools:\n\n* For creators to digitally sign/suggest payout on demand\n* That distribute royalties to every participant proportionally\n* Build NFTs that can benefit stakeholders and creators perpetually\n\nThese are the reasons we are looking to completely switch our current application to web3.\n\nWhile we understand that only a fraction of content currently lives within Mirror, we want to help build the tools needed to fulfill our vision and believe Mirror can be the perfect platform to do so (and bet that it will grow exponentially).", "timestamp": 1633530706, "digest": "glizDqLKLScnapqbIm77YOIW0HdCJloNOA6irL7PO6k", "contributor": "0xC8C646e8bAEe44A82b622614FDe570DE91883E26"}

{"id": "hOfYxXgS7WqciUk7L82hW9TM6EppLX9sKj4srxbfhgs", "title": "Democratization and Communitization of Finance", "body": "Due to low interest rates and global growth rates, economic inequality is intensifying worldwide. In particular, during COVID-19 crisis, the gap between the rich and poor keeps widening. \n\nThere is a phenomenon in which the rich become richer and the poor become poorer. Growing young generations are investing in stocks and real estate and go so far as to invest with debt leveraging. Many people say “If I had bought a house at that time”, “If I had bought stocks at that time”, or “If I had bought Bitcoin at that time”. It happens today that some people either get rich or poor overnight.\n\n## The democratization of Finance\n\nRecently announced housing price in Seoul, South Korea is about $1M. Everyone is getting into an investment, realizing that they can't buy a house only with their wages. Fortunately, in these days, there are various platforms such as YouTube, Podcasts, and Blogs where you can learn financial information and economics.\n\nFinancial services for retail investors such as Robin Hood, Ministock, and Toss have lowered entries to the market. The financial market which used to only allow Wall Street, investment banks, venture capital, and hedge funds to be entered is now open to people thanks to these services.\n\nFurthermore, a platform has emerged where groups of people agreeing to the vision and direction of unlisted companies can participate in fundraising instead of just acquiring stocks in the secondary market.\n\nAngel League, one of the services in Korea allows people to purchase the private equity of a startup as a union member. Over the past year, the average return of Angel League reached 107%, outperforming unicorn startups such as Yanolja, Kurly, Krafton, and Toss.\n\nTwig, the private equity investment platform provided the users with an opportunity to invest in global startups such as Robin Hood and Kraken.\n\nMore services linking stocks to digital assets have also been created. FTX, a global cryptocurrency exchange, launched a product which is linked to the value of stocks such as Tesla, Apple, and Google that can be purchased with cryptocurrency.\n\nThe stablecoin platform Terra built a platform for trading and issuing synthetic assets based on the value of the real stock on the blockchain. And it is free from regulatory censorship by the countries and institutions.\n\nUnlike the existing traditional financial market, individuals are given more authority to manage various assets in the cryptocurrency market. Many platforms are coming with interest rates higher than the commercial banks and that can make people get the short or long position through low collateral ratio with crypto. Also, there is a platform that allows anyone to make their own portfolio to create index funds in crypto.** \\n **\n\nIn the future, various open financial services can emerge from cryptocurrency. This will be able to give more authority and opportunities for retail investors. **So It is time to readjust the \"Uneven playground\" in the existing financial industry, which was only advantageous for institutional investors and traditional large banks.**\n\n## Communitization of Finance\n\nWith the development of the Internet, now anyone can get information for investment and the asymmetry of information has been resolved. Retail investors are starting to create an investment community and exchange information with each other. **The community formed in this way has strong power.**\n\nInvestors in the community begin to pay attention to new assets in Long-tail, not traditional assets.\n\nAn example is the GameStop in January. There was an incident in which individual investors in the Wall Street Bet(WSB) were angry at institutions' short positions. They responded strategically and systematically causing a short squeeze.\n\nThe epicenter of this incident was WSB, one of the communities in Reddit. The Reddit community, along with Twitter, began to create the WSB's meme culture and as people were forwarding and sharing it. More people became interested in this incident and participated in the community.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yC4lUqbXtt3M2Wtum4Z6I.png?height=732&width=692)\n\nThe same thing happened with Dogecoin. Led by Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, WSB, and people on Twitter were shouting out support for Dogecoin and made a huge impact. Through the meme culture and SNS, Dogecoin has gained big attention in the community.\n\nThese phenomena were started and led by the MZ generation who consists most of WSB and Twitter users. They led this meme culture. MZ can come up with great memes and use them as a means of online communication. **The community has created a kind of culture by using memes and begun to make new trends.**\n\n**New added value can be formed if people start to get interest in certain assets and drive the trend.** The community creates its own consensus mechanism and the people who belong to the community can form a fellowship and sense of unity.\n\nThis is similar to the dollars printed by the U.S. Federal Bank. Because the value of the dollar is also created by the consensus and belief of a specific community. (Agreement of all global countries in the case of dollars).\n\nThe dollar's hegemony has been maintained for about 80 years since the Bretton Woods in 1944, but its power is gradually weakening. Since 2008, quantitative easing has been implemented. In Particular, dollars have been distributed indefinitely since the start of Covid-19.\n\nAs the value of the dollar weakens, doubts about the dollar and fiat increased and interest in new assets is growing.\n\nSo are Bitcoin, luxury brands, and NFT (Non Fungible tokens). More people consider Bitcoin as digital gold and communities for Bitcoin are growing, the value of Bitcoin is formed.\n\nSimilarly, luxury brands have their own philosophy and fandom that loves their products. Luxury goods have an irreplaceable value that is only for luxury brands and cannot be given by ordinary products. People having luxury goods differentiate themselves from others and show off their wealth by purchasing luxury goods.\n\nLike luxury goods, the value of NFT can increase when communities and fandom who love NFT are growing. And so are people who recognize expensive and scarce NFT.\n\nFurthermore, communities can create values for 'specific people' beyond specific assets. People who are supported by the community such as celebrities, YouTubers, and influencers, can create new added value. They will be able to interact with the community by communicating with fans through their own tokens (personal tokens).\n\n## The Value of the Community and Money\n\nRecently, ‘Dangguen Market’, an online secondhand marketplace in Korea, raised the investment with a valuation of $2.7B from Soft Bank Ventures Asia, Altos Ventures, Kakao Ventures. This valuation is higher than that of Shinsegae Group, a major domestic retailer in Korea. If Dangguen Market simply focused on the secondary market, this valuation would not make sense.\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/south-korean-online-secondhand-marketplace-danggeun-market-raises-162m-at-a-2-7b-valuation/](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/south-korean-online-secondhand-marketplace-danggeun-market-raises-162m-at-a-2-7b-valuation/)\n\nIn fact, the strength of the Dangguen Market is in the **‘local community’** rather than its core function of being a secondary market. Dangguen Market forms a local community for users in a specific area and provides various information such as local restaurants, cafes as well as trading second-hand stuff. Dangguen Market is creating value through the local community.\n\n**The value and power of the community are really strong.** The value created by the ‘Bottom-Up’ method from the community is gradually causing social changes through various experiments.\n\nCommunity elements can’t be excluded when valuing a specific asset or company in the future. Even with the era of the digital world and the digital assets, the value of communities people form will become more important. **Eventually, communities will become power and money.**", "timestamp": 1633533990, "digest": "txM8VSsAzG4NQEGrY97J_jWkyFXXxEchV6Ti1_N4dBw", "contributor": "0x81168C14e5A89f60b30e9a7f82A229406A64369d"}

We thank you in advance for your undivided attention during this brief pre-flight safety orientation. Please take a minute to review the safety instructions pamphlet located in the seat pocket to your left, and follow along while we go over one final protocol review. We’ll be on our way shortly. Welcome aboard!\n\nFirst things first, we’d like to extend our sincerest congratulations and express our honest bewilderment regarding your completion of our time traveling bootcamp program. Not only did you manage to successfully pass all of our prerequisite courses in general relativity, quantum mechanics, theoretical physics, and science fiction history, but your immune system also managed to survive immunization and inoculation for every disease known to mankind since the dawn of human history. From all of us here at Sherman Atlantic, congrats! And wow!\n\nSmoking is strictly prohibited during taxi, take off, teleportation, or landing, unless your reason for time traveling with us today is to prevent your past self from picking up your first cigarette. In that case, you’ll find a complimentary final smoke in the seat pocket to your left.\n\nWe would like to remind you that in the case of unexpected turbulence to just sit back, relax, clench your buttocks and hold your breath until it’s over. In case of an emergency water landing, this vehicle is equipped to convert into a naval grade submarine. We regret having overlooked submarine operation instruction during your bootcamp training, so in the rare chance this occurs during your flight, just do your best. In case of extraterrestrial contact during flight, press the red button under your seat to get in contact with NASA immediately. In case of spontaneous human combustion, you’re fucked.\n\nWe would now like to ensure that Sherman Atlantic has your full cooperation regarding our strict time traveler code of conduct. We are going to take this opportunity to review our policies with you, and you can accept them on the screen in front of you.\n\n*First, do you agree to not visit any MIT time traveler conventions, because those are for nerds?*\n\n*Thank you. Do you accept the Marty McFly rule, and agree that under no circumstances will you make any attempts during your visit to try and bang a younger version of your mom?*\n\n*Thank you. And finally, do you agree to make zero attempts to witness or disrupt the Kennedy assassination because it absolutely needed to happen for reasons we won’t get into and you should absolutely make no attempts to find out?*\n\n*Thank you.*\n\nShould a change in cabin air pressure occur during flight, an oxygen mask will appear in front of you. To start the flow of oxygen, pull the mask towards you. Place it firmly over your nose and mouth, secure the elastic band behind your head, and breathe normally. You might be expecting us to now say something along the lines of how you should secure your own mask before assisting any traveling companions, but we at Sherman Atlantic know that you are flying alone today, and that your desire to visit the past stems from a deep discontentment with your present and a growing anxiety towards the future. You probably want to go back and prevent yourself from saying that one stupid thing, or to stand up to that school yard bully who made you feel like nothing, or to stop your father from walking out on you. You probably think that if that one thing never happened, you wouldn’t be such a fuck up in life and maybe one person on this god forsaken planet could actually learn to love you for you, and not this strange, damaged and decrepit creature that you’ve become.\n\nAt this point we would like to lighten the mood with a little time travel humor. What do you call a device designed to bring extinct herbs back from the past? A thyme machine. Ha ha, ha ha.\n\nBefore we lock the the cabin doors, we are legally obligated to do one final check of approval-- Do you wish to proceed with your time travel flight with us today?", "timestamp": 1633535724, "digest": "PNnSzNqAJYThXIIpyIE94Zy6IUwMyHuf8ReledMukEw", "contributor": "0xd2F156bBed5e8cdFa0E853403A554a7e9fe692f4"}

{"id": "TGet5QdrHDZ_ggxAGRCBBHXbupE8OVxq2gqD_oq9fAM", "title": "Governance as a Source of Value", "body": "### How the DeFi Blueprint Aligns Market Incentives with Societal Values\n\nBy [Sam McCarthy](https://twitter.com/samccarthy27)\n\n*Part 2 of a 2 part essay series on the current state of decentralized governance in crypto. This essay follows \"[Make Decentralized Governance Great (Again?)](https://sammccarthy.substack.com/p/make-decentralized-governance-great).\"*\n\nDecentralized governance implemented through DAOs encourages open participation in the development of the DeFi industry. By either purchasing or earning governance tokens, actors not only have the opportunity to share in the risk and reward associated with the monetization of a new financial system, but also the incentive to define the economic and social impact that system will have. Ideally, you purchase a governance token because you like the project and begin sharing ideas to make its token price go up. These tokens represent not only a financial stake in the protocol, but also membership in a community, the ability to influence the protocol, and a track record of participation.\n\nMany cryptoassets today, particularly those within DeFi, also grant holders claims on a portion of protocol cash flows. This gives the tokens very quantifiable value, which [can even be modeled by discounted cash flow analyses](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-case-for-100-sushi) favored by traditional financial institutions. However, this has left many to wonder whether \"pure\" governance tokens, which only carry rights to partake in protocol governance, are valueless.\n\nIn this essay, I introduce three theoretical perspectives from which we can view the term \"value\" and how they relate to cryptoassets. In addition, I discuss how the power granted by governance tokens confers value. Lastly, I propose governance power as a new fundamental metric in token valuation that can be measured by a \"governance premium\" assigned to a token's price.\n\n**THREE INTERPRETATIONS OF VALUE (& NFT MANIA)**\n\nThe word \"value\" can refer to the price or meaning of something, or more generally, to that which is morally cherished. As a result of this ambiguity, in his book, *Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value*, David Graeber presents three interrelated schools of thought around value: economic, sociological, and linguistic.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17c7235e-0c89-400b-ac9b-14840e3b528d_632x318.png)\n\nEconomically, an object's value is measured by what others are willing to give up, or exchange, to get it. This implies that value is determined by buyers in a marketplace. For example, as the non-fungible token (NFT) market rapidly expands, investors and speculators are currently rushing to outbid each other for new and artificially rare pieces. Right now, the value of some of these collections, such as [CryptoPunks](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks) and [EtherRock](https://etherrock.com/), have exploded because buyers are willing, and able, to pay elevated prices for them. However, this is not the only factor that determines the value of a particular NFT.\n\nGraeber describes sociological value as the \"conception of what is ultimately good, proper, or desirable in human life.\" Valuing something through this lens involves identifying the benefits an action or object holds within a greater social context. Corresponding to René Girard's concept of [mimetic desire](https://alexdanco.com/2019/04/28/secrets-about-people-a-short-and-dangerous-introduction-to-rene-girard/comment-page-1/), this definition of value implies that others influence the choices we make regarding not just what we want, but what we ought to want. Similar to traditional art, [NFTs grant holders status and reputation](https://cryptohayes.medium.com/rock-paper-scissors-says-go-a3641dfe132c). Likewise, a collection of prominent individuals (crypto-native investors and influencers) signal the desirability of these assets. By \"[shilling](https://decryptionary.com/dictionary/shilling/)\" certain NFTs, these individuals influence the preferences of others and the status attributed to individual pieces and collections. The digital commons of the Internet only amplifies the effect this has on an NFT's perceived value and price.\n\nLastly, the linguistic value of objects is measured by the differences between them. Ferdinand de Saussure, the pioneer of [semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics), claimed that in order to understand the meaning of a word, one must understand its place within a larger system. The definition of the word \"red,\" for example, is best understood as the color that isn't blue, green, or yellow. In this sense, to value NFTs you must understand their place within their collection (based on characteristics and rarity), as well as with the entire universe of NFTs (based on age, owners, and meaning within the larger crypto ecosystem). No NFT can be valued in isolation.\n\n**SOCIAL CONSENSUS**\n\nThrough the lens of all three interpretations of value, we can draw a simple conclusion: actions and objects become meaningful (or valuable) to humans by being incorporated into a social system. Graeber states, \"The realization of value is always, necessarily, a process of comparison; for this reason it always, necessarily, implies an at least imagined audience.\" For us, the \"imagined audience\" is society.\n\nWhen measuring an object's value, not only do we try to determine what others might be willing to exchange for it, but we consider what others agree it is worth within a social context. The result is that social consensus becomes the fundamental source of value; something has value if people agree that it has value. Viewed in parallel with traditional microeconomic theory, a consumer's utility is maximized when purchasing a good with the highest level of agree-upon social value.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly apparent with bitcoin. In [one of my favorite essay's on the subject](https://uncommoncore.co/unpacking-bitcoins-social-contract/), pseudonymous crypto researcher [Hasu](https://twitter.com/hasufl?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) states, \"The bitcoin token itself has no value. The value exists purely on the social layer.\" While blockchain technology adds credibility through programming and automation, the social layer determines the rules of bitcoin the blockchain, which ultimately gives bitcoin the cryptoasset its value. For this reason, you cannot replicate bitcoin by just \"[forking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development))\" its code. In order for the forked protocol to have any value, you have to obtain the buy-in of the community of people that underwrite its value. Hasu likens this process to running a presidential campaign as a financial investment.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4079cce6-a039-4c18-b8ce-61fbf534ee12_1190x1126.png)\n\nFor a variety of reasons, changing the ruleset of and exercising control over a DeFi protocol is far simpler than recreating bitcoin. And, as we will see, there are more definitive metrics to measure the value generated by exercising this power.\n\n**POWER AND INFLUENCE**\n\nStanding in opposition to legacy finance and internet companies, where control remains in the hands of the few, open digital communities assume direction of DeFi protocols. Each community leverages its own decentralized governance processes, which occur both on-chain (for more formal, binding changes) and off-chain (for voting, as well as discussion and sentiment checks). Ideas of all community members are evaluated in order to arrive at consensus regarding protocol execution and capital management. This bottoms-up approach allows projects to address and fund the most important initiatives as defined by the collective group of users, developers, and tokenholders.\n\nWhile I do not believe the only, or even the best, mechanism to implement decentralized governance process is through a one-token-one-vote scheme, I do believe that the token model is effective at translating social values into economic outcomes. In \"[A Blank Slate of State](https://unchainedpodcast.com/chris-burniske-a-blank-slate-of-state/),\" [Chris Burniske](https://twitter.com/cburniske?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) states, \"Protocols allow us to more granularly coordinate around social ideals, while still using the tool of free markets and competition to drive those outcomes.\" Tokens carrying governance rights allow people to freely express their ideas and beliefs by contributing to and voting on community proposals in an open forum. As a result, protocol resource allocation reflects the collective values of the many rather than the opaque motivations of the few. The most successful projects will inevitably be those that leverage the full functionality of this new asset class to produce products and services that generate the most utility for the widest set of stakeholders.\n\nIn \"[Cryptonetwork Governance As Capital](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/2/19/cryptonetwork-governance-as-capital),\" Placeholder partner [Joel Monegro](https://twitter.com/jmonegro?lang=en) defines governance as the power to change the rules of cryptoeconomic networks. For DeFi, the value of governance lies within this power - the power to influence the evolution of a new financial system, define the impact it will have on society, and accrue the associated status and reputation. All of this represents great value for individual actors within a wider social context. Thus, the right to exercise a certain level of control within DeFi, as represented by governance tokens, accrues monetary value in proportion to the perceived social value of participation.\n\n**THE GOVERNANCE PREMIUM**\n\nIn traditional finance, various types of premiums are added onto an asset's \"[intrinsic value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp)\" to reflect some amount of future uncertainty. For example, a liquidity premium is added onto the value of relatively illiquid assets to compensate the buyer for the possibility that the asset cannot be easily resold for cash at fair market value. Keeping with this type of valuation model, I present a new type of premium: the governance premium.\n\nThe governance premium equals the value of open participation in protocol governance and reflects the degree of perceived control an investor has over a project's future. Unlike other financial premiums, a governance premium is inversely related to uncertainty. The greater the perceived control granted by the token (and therefore, the less perceived uncertainty over the future of the protocol), the greater the governance premium added to the value of the token. Like all things crypto, the governance premium is set in the market.\n\nThere are three primary variables to consider while analyzing governance premiums: project growth, \"assets under management\" (AUM), and community strength.\n\n*GROWTH*\n\nAs a nation state grows in international prominence, so does the power of its leaders. Equivalently, as a protocol becomes more systemically important, the impact of wielding power over the protocol increases. This also applies to the reputation, status, and feeling of purpose that comes from participating and having value-added contributions within the protocol's community.\n\n*AUM*\n\nA DeFi project's \"AUM\" include its treasury and the [total value locked (TVL)](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/token-metrics-you-should-know) in its smart contracts. Treasury spending and resource allocation is usually determined through the project's governance proposal, discussion, and voting process. This can directly impact the tokenholders by voting in revenue-sharing cash flows. In addition, this can impact the owners of the assets locked in a project's contracts by changing key protocol parameters. As AUM increases, so does the value of capital controlled by governance participants, as well as the social consequences of that control.\n\n*COMMUNITY*\n\nThe most important factor is community, which includes developers, users, and tokenholders. Cultivating a strong community is essential for any DeFi project. To do this, it is necessary to promote the legitimacy of the project's governance process by engaging the community and increasing [their perceived control over the protocol](https://sammccarthy.substack.com/p/make-decentralized-governance-great). This makes members more motivated to contribute and the project more resistant to [plutocracy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html) (i.e. rule by \"whales\"). The strength of a community can be measured in various ways, including the level of its active participation and the effectiveness of its collective action.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14a490c2-9e8f-402e-bbc7-843678fa01cd_1180x341.png)\n\nThe governance premium reflects the fact that the power to participate in a community within a growing industry, power which impacts an ever broader set of stakeholders, confers value greater than that which is purely economic. We must ask ourselves then, how should we use this power? How do we leverage this opportunity to create a more open Internet, a more inclusive financial system, and a more innovative society?\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThrough Graeber's analysis, we are able to understand that value is created within society's conception of the desirable. The problem then becomes how to efficiently aggregate many individual ideas of what is valuable in a way that directs collective action towards the most beneficial ends for the largest number of people. In modern economies built on neoliberal ideology, the all-powerful \"free market\" is supposed to serve this purpose. However, corporate capitalism has led to monopolistic power, inefficient resource allocation, and rampant inequality. Status and power is based on the capital you have, not on the value you add. Thus, the majority of people's voices are not heard, nor their needs met. Furthermore, the financial services industry, which should be responsible for funding and providing liquidity for projects that will benefit all of society, instead enriches a small group of executives, shareholders, and wealthy individuals. I believe DeFi and the rest of the cryptoeconomy offer a promising alternative.\n\nIn Web3's vision of an open Internet, governance is the way digital communities, including DeFi protocol DAOs, signal what they consider desirable. Through the activities they incentivize and the projects they fund, community members shape the industry's future. As the ecosystem grows, these decisions have a greater and greater impact upon society. In addition to accruing value to tokens, all actors within the crypto space should recognize that this power comes with responsibility.\n\nAs the witnesses to the founding of an entirely new economic and social order - a new way to organize, coordinate, and innovate - we must ensure that it is built in a way that will benefit the most amount of people. Burniske warns, \"Markets are a powerful technology that is meant to serve society's virtues, but markets are dangerous as a virtue system in-and-of themselves. If we continue to allow markets to dictate our virtues, we will perpetuate a society that the majority now [whisper](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/what-do-people-really-think-about-capitalism/) is selfish, divisive, imbalanced - threatening, even.\" With everything in our world currently abstracted behind a veil of money and profit, we must regain the social context of our actions and recognize the value derived from them.\n\nMy hope is that in our current paradigm  where capital is abundant and people pay millions of dollars for JPEGs of rocks, social value - as measured by the impact our actions have within a larger system - will displace monetary value as the primary pursuit of economic actors. As Burniske states, \"The opportunity to craft the future we want to see is always ours.\" Let's ensure that as we embark on our journey deeper into the Digital Age, that future remains bright.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F958b0762-4a6f-4f87-bdd8-e1ed96a52011_348x145.png)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633535910, "digest": "_ZaN1-vIbEYTP49p6z-CWrfbxNQltbe8tYyELNj5iZo", "contributor": "0x749c68F80b3C88351826723a8a0A7d7fd4dAF6CD"}

You probably think that if that one thing never happened, you wouldn’t be such a fuck up in life and maybe one person on this god forsaken planet could actually learn to love you for you, and not this strange, damaged and decrepit creature that you’ve become.\n\nAt this point we would like to lighten the mood with a little time travel humor. What do you call a device designed to bring extinct herbs back from the past? A thyme machine. Ha ha, ha ha.\n\nBefore we lock the the cabin doors, we are legally obligated to do one final check of approval-- Do you wish to proceed with your time travel flight with us today?", "timestamp": 1633536687, "digest": "PNnSzNqAJYThXIIpyIE94Zy6IUwMyHuf8ReledMukEw", "contributor": "0xd2F156bBed5e8cdFa0E853403A554a7e9fe692f4"}

{"id": "xts58m6z2BtxzGWNocFkVkWJnFqsI3N3MNxIj8-CtyM", "title": "Democratization and Communitization of Finance", "body": "Due to low interest rates and global growth rates, economic inequality is intensifying worldwide. In particular, during COVID-19 crisis, the gap between the rich and poor keeps widening. \n\nThere is a phenomenon in which the rich become richer and the poor become poorer. Growing young generations are investing in stocks and real estate and go so far as to invest with debt leveraging. Many people say “If I had bought a house at that time”, “If I had bought stocks at that time”, or “If I had bought Bitcoin at that time”. It happens today that some people either get rich or poor overnight.\n\n## The democratization of Finance\n\nRecently announced housing price in Seoul, South Korea is about $1M. Everyone is getting into an investment, realizing that they can't buy a house only with their wages. Fortunately, in these days, there are various platforms such as YouTube, Podcasts, and Blogs where you can learn financial information and economics.\n\nFinancial services for retail investors such as Robin Hood, Ministock, and Toss have lowered entries to the market. The financial market which used to only allow Wall Street, investment banks, venture capital, and hedge funds to be entered is now open to people thanks to these services.\n\nFurthermore, a platform has emerged where groups of people agreeing to the vision and direction of unlisted companies can participate in fundraising instead of just acquiring stocks in the secondary market.\n\nAngel League, one of the services in Korea allows people to purchase the private equity of a startup as a union member. Over the past year, the average return of Angel League reached 107%, outperforming unicorn startups such as Yanolja, Kurly, Krafton, and Toss.\n\nTwig, the private equity investment platform provided the users with an opportunity to invest in global startups such as Robin Hood and Kraken.\n\nMore services linking stocks to digital assets have also been created. FTX, a global cryptocurrency exchange, launched a product which is linked to the value of stocks such as Tesla, Apple, and Google that can be purchased with cryptocurrency.\n\nThe stablecoin platform Terra built a platform for trading and issuing synthetic assets based on the value of the real stock on the blockchain. And it is free from regulatory censorship by the countries and institutions.\n\nUnlike the existing traditional financial market, individuals are given more authority to manage various assets in the cryptocurrency market. Many platforms are coming with interest rates higher than the commercial banks and that can make people get the short or long position through low collateral ratio with crypto. Also, there is a platform that allows anyone to make their own portfolio to create index funds in crypto.\\*\\* \\\\n \\*\\*\n\nIn the future, various open financial services can emerge from cryptocurrency. This will be able to give more authority and opportunities for retail investors. **So It is time to readjust the \"Uneven playground\" in the existing financial industry, which was only advantageous for institutional investors and traditional large banks.**\n\n## Communitization of Finance\n\nWith the development of the Internet, now anyone can get information for investment and the asymmetry of information has been resolved. Retail investors are starting to create an investment community and exchange information with each other. **The community formed in this way has strong power.**\n\nInvestors in the community begin to pay attention to new assets in Long-tail, not traditional assets.\n\nAn example is the GameStop in January. There was an incident in which individual investors in the Wall Street Bet(WSB) were angry at institutions' short positions. They responded strategically and systematically causing a short squeeze.\n\nThe epicenter of this incident was WSB, one of the communities in Reddit. The Reddit community, along with Twitter, began to create the WSB's meme culture and as people were forwarding and sharing it. More people became interested in this incident and participated in the community.\n\nThe same thing happened with Dogecoin. Led by Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, WSB, and people on Twitter were shouting out support for Dogecoin and made a huge impact. Through the meme culture and SNS, Dogecoin has gained big attention in the community.\n\nThese phenomena were started and led by the MZ generation who consists most of WSB and Twitter users. They led this meme culture. MZ can come up with great memes and use them as a means of online communication. **The community has created a kind of culture by using memes and begun to make new trends.**\n\n**New added value can be formed if people start to get interest in certain assets and drive the trend.** The community creates its own consensus mechanism and the people who belong to the community can form a fellowship and sense of unity.\n\nThis is similar to the dollars printed by the U.S. Federal Bank. Because the value of the dollar is also created by the consensus and belief of a specific community. (Agreement of all global countries in the case of dollars).\n\nThe dollar's hegemony has been maintained for about 80 years since the Bretton Woods in 1944, but its power is gradually weakening. Since 2008, quantitative easing has been implemented. In Particular, dollars have been distributed indefinitely since the start of Covid-19.\n\nAs the value of the dollar weakens, doubts about the dollar and fiat increased and interest in new assets is growing.\n\nSo are Bitcoin, luxury brands, and NFT (Non Fungible tokens). More people consider Bitcoin as digital gold and communities for Bitcoin are growing, the value of Bitcoin is formed.\n\nSimilarly, luxury brands have their own philosophy and fandom that loves their products. Luxury goods have an irreplaceable value that is only for luxury brands and cannot be given by ordinary products. People having luxury goods differentiate themselves from others and show off their wealth by purchasing luxury goods.\n\nLike luxury goods, the value of NFT can increase when communities and fandom who love NFT are growing. And so are people who recognize expensive and scarce NFT.\n\nFurthermore, communities can create values for 'specific people' beyond specific assets. People who are supported by the community such as celebrities, YouTubers, and influencers, can create new added value. They will be able to interact with the community by communicating with fans through their own tokens (personal tokens).\n\n## The Value of the Community and Money\n\nRecently, ‘Dangguen Market’, an online secondhand marketplace in Korea, raised the investment with a valuation of $2.7B from Soft Bank Ventures Asia, Altos Ventures, Kakao Ventures. This valuation is higher than that of Shinsegae Group, a major domestic retailer in Korea. If Dangguen Market simply focused on the secondary market, this valuation would not make sense.\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/south-korean-online-secondhand-marketplace-danggeun-market-raises-162m-at-a-2-7b-valuation/](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/south-korean-online-secondhand-marketplace-danggeun-market-raises-162m-at-a-2-7b-valuation/)\n\nIn fact, the strength of the Dangguen Market is in the **‘local community’** rather than its core function of being a secondary market. Dangguen Market forms a local community for users in a specific area and provides various information such as local restaurants, cafes as well as trading second-hand stuff. Dangguen Market is creating value through the local community.\n\n**The value and power of the community are really strong.** The value created by the ‘Bottom-Up’ method from the community is gradually causing social changes through various experiments.\n\nCommunity elements can’t be excluded when valuing a specific asset or company in the future. Even with the era of the digital world and the digital assets, the value of communities people form will become more important. **Eventually, communities will become power and money.**", "timestamp": 1633537180, "digest": "my2zKsDppfTQN1orf6t8Cq9_mRPY-upWvQ9r5AmgSW8", "contributor": "0x81168C14e5A89f60b30e9a7f82A229406A64369d"}

(10) The first is [@RMRKapp](https://twitter.com/RmrkApp), which is a native NFT protocol for the [@kusamanetwork](https://twitter.com/kusamanetwork) ecosystem, used to interpret rules and standards for special data, cracking protocol restrictions as well as common sense. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w-j_a7BG5-S3qTR3lnvXO.jpg?height=530&width=1000)\n\nSince [#Kusama](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kusama?src=hashtag_click) does not have smart contracts, logic cannot be written on it for polls, token sales, dApp applications, etc., but graffiti can be added to the blockchain and tools can be written to interpret those graffiti. Check the threads about it here: \n\n[https://twitter.com/LeoQ0811/status/1442878277585027078?s=20](https://twitter.com/LeoQ0811/status/1442878277585027078?s=20)\n\n(11) Another is [http://artion.io](https://t.co/NUy6Xr1o0Z?amp=1), which is an NFT marketplace based on [@FantomFDN](https://twitter.com/FantomFDN) that charges a 10 [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) fee for casting NFTs and has no sales commissions. In addition, creators can set royalties at the time of casting and earn revenue from secondary market sales.\n\nArtion integrates with Chainlink for feeding, and the Beta supports the ERC721 NFT standard with digital assets stored on [#IPFS](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IPFS?src=hashtag_click).\n\nThe next version of Artion will add a built-in version of Anyswap's Ethereum-Fantom NFT bridge to enable interoperability with Ethereum and become a cross-chain NFT marketplace. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NYjo4lgKgh8hvKg9PKHMP.jpg?height=531&width=1000)\n\nThe above project description is limited to my personal understanding, please point out if there are errors, there is no investment advice [#DYOR](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DYOR?src=hashtag_click)\n\nThis is just a very superficial analysis of the above projects, and is intended to share potential projects that I find interesting and valuable. If you would like to discuss with me, please follow me [@LeoQ0811](https://twitter.com/LeoQ0811), private messages are open.", "timestamp": 1633537894, "digest": "wO4mL9PSkR0Ao6Z2rOg-4UhN82eCGReMfY4Thmpj93o", "contributor": "0xC851c83E912e704D6C7d8b3863b506fFe56B0711"}
{"id": "TsY1RhRXFqebTUIhqZSiwLrJHFsPT_VOC-joQHF8T3I", "title": "¿Qué es el tutorial hell? (Y por qué debes evitarlo)", "body": "Cuando somos nuevos, la mejor manera de aprender a programar y echar mano a algo de código es a través de tutoriales, nos “enseñan” a hacer aplicaciones increíbles y sin equivocarnos, terminamos el tutorial y le mostramos la app que hicimos a nuestros amigos y familia, “soy un hacker” surge en nuestros pensamientos. \\n Entonces hacemos otro tutorial, esta vez un poco más largo y más complicado, la sensación de aprender aumenta y nos sentimos cada vez más cerca de ser “Junior Level”, el camino a Google está cada vez más cerca… \\n Seguimos así durante un mes, dos meses, 6 meses?... Pero Amazon no nos ha llamado aún, entonces te pones a pensar ¿qué estoy haciendo mal? Si he hecho decenas de apps; ¿por qué no consigo el trabajo soñado?\n\n**Has caído en el famoso “Tutorial Hell”**\n\nPara tenerlo más claro, el tutorial hell consiste en hacer infinidad de tutoriales de programación impulsados por el sentido de productividad que se logra al terminar un tutorial, una falsa productividad…\n\n**¿Por qué una falsa productividad?**\n\nPorque los tutoriales no te preparan para un trabajo real de programador, en los tutoriales todo sale perfecto, hay un camino que seguir dictado por el profesor en cuestión, así que estás en una zona segura en la que todo es de color arcoíris.\n\n**¿Cómo es entonces programar en la vida real?**\n\nAl hacer tus propias apps tienes la libertad de tomar las decisiones tú, tienes que decir que base de datos vas a usar, cómo vas a distribuir las carpetas, usar o no una librería en específico, es de los mejores sentimientos al programar, sentir que puedes crear cualquier cosa, suena bien verdad?, pero eso conlleva también una responsabilidad, resolver los problemas… Bugs aleatorios surgen de la nada cuando programamos, un error 500 desde el backend, un margin: 10px nos descuadra toda la página, la mayoría de las veces esos errores son una muestra de nuestras fallas de pensamiento como seres humanos que somos pero otras veces pueden venir de errores con los frameworks y librerías que hemos decido utilizar.\n\nPero en el fondo de eso se trata la programación, de resolver problemas, el sentimiento de arreglar un bug o crear un programa que resuelve alguna necesidad es lo que nos motiva, la pasión por el código... (y el dinero claro...).\n\n**¿Cómo y por qué tienes que salir del tutorial hell?**\n\nEl porqué es sencillo, si quieres ser programador necesitas ser capaz de crear apps desde 0, a solicitud de un cliente, un manager o tú mismo si tuviste esa primera idea del millón de dólares. Si estás atrapado en el tutorial hell no vas a poder avanzar en tu travesía.\n\n**Consejo para salir del tutorial hell.**\n\nHacer la menor cantidad de tutoriales posibles, pero ¿cómo sabes cuando estás listo para programar en serio? Nunca lo estás… No importa qué nivel de programador tienes, siempre hay algo que representa un reto para tí, entonces la mejor manera de saber si estás listo es empezando ahora mismo, no te prives de la diversión de crear, de descubrir, de resolver los problemas que surjan. \\n Crea una función que sume 2 números, una calculadora, una app sencilla de lista de tareas, tu primera app con conexión a una base de datos, tu primera página sencilla con React, Vue… Cada paso que das te acerca a tu meta, concéntrate en avanzar aunque sea un poco cada día y cuando menos te lo esperes verás los resultados. \\n Cómo recomendación te diría que empieces con 2 o 3 tutoriales, tal vez un libro pero luego de eso lo mejor es empezar a tirar código a diestra y siniestra, salga bien o mal, resolviendo los problemas en dónde tendrás el verdadero aprendizaje, ahí está la verdadera diversión.\n\nY claro, en conjunto se deben practicar mucho los fundamentos de programación, no son ciencia de cohetes… Ese tema lo dejamos para otro post.\n\n¡Éxito!", "timestamp": 1633538705, "digest": "Ya7dsXTdboLzGWCVLMduzBEuvljYKz2G7qcm6XwtGqs", "contributor": "0xBC17A9bE275245D80647b1a043baaB635582c5eE"}

{"id": "oHLXS8zykJ9ObLwZfaPbnMp_1XD-V_wPEn6fvZM2440", "title": "Lights on, Lighthouse", "body": "Web3 is an inevitable future, an operating system upgrade for innovation that will eventually replace the old system — even for industries and problems that right now feel out of reach. We can accelerate that future and shape this transition, but to do that we need to *build*. We need to build useful, valuable, kick-ass products. \n\nBuilding great products in web3 will require merging the old and the new. It will require unprecedented collaboration, and knowing what to keep and what to change from how we've built products so far. How can great product teams form and thrive in this new paradigm of DAOs and decentralized collaboration? How can we attract missionaries, not mercenaries? \n\nThis huge problem space became the spark for Lighthouse, a digital organization that is fully focused on builders, and what it means to build great products in web3. We want to be a beacon for product excellence, a lighthouse that helps DAOs navigate uncharted seas. We are following in the footsteps of great industrial and software design that has come before us, and to translate that into how DAOs can build great products.\n\nLighthouse will work independently and in partnership with leading DAOs, developing projects and products that help DAOs move towards product excellence *much faster*. To do that Lighthouse will work at multiple leverage points: building products, protocols, and knowledge, deploying funding, and more. We will apply skills and best practices developed over decades―high-trust, autonomous cross functional teams, simple org structures, relentless user experience focus, clear problem statements, and people who are hungry to create. \n\nWe kick things off small and nimble, but with impossibly big ambitions. We are launching our first product, Backdrop, as an open beta today. Backdrop is the interface for exploring people’s work in web3 — their contributions and the collaborators and organizations they work with. We are thrilled to evolve with the ecosystem as people get more connected, and their contributions to DAOs become more visible, verifiable, and useful.\n\n## The Lighthouse Way\n\n* We give power to the builders. Lighthouse's partners and contributors will shape how we work via ownership in our token. We will ensure those who build together with us blow wind in our sails, aligning our course with theirs over time.\n* We are focused. Building awesome things requires focusing on a narrow set of problems, so Lighthouse is not set up as a product or service agency. We work on projects and products we are well positioned to solve. \n* We are in it for the long haul. This transformation will take time, and we want to work only on problems that will be durable and grow in importance for years to come.\n* We are not alone. By aligning incentives with other DAOs that also focus on these problems, we collaborate with DAOs to build together (products or otherwise), while still paving the way towards our mission of helping more DAOs build great products.\n* We are ecosystem builders. If we're successful, it's not just Lighthouse that will reap the rewards. We build things that are interoperable, open, and have a dramatic benefit to the ecosystem at large.\n* We care. We believe that building a better future means building ethical and sustainable products. We care about people, justice, and the planet. We don't engage with organizations, projects or products that don't.\n\n## Lighthouse S01: Backdrop and more\n\nTo maintain focus, Lighthouse will work in seasons, each with clearly defined teams, projects and objectives. The first season has been shaped up by the founding members and partners, but as we expand this process will become more open and collaborative.\n\nWe have two objectives for S01:\n\n* Release and scale Backdrop, a product that connects people through their work and contributions, \"the Etherscan for on-chain work\"\n* Build a self-sufficient, financially independent digital organization that becomes a reference in product excellence in the DAO and web3 space\n\nBackdrop relies on the quality and depth of on-chain data and will evolve as the ecosystem evolves. Our aim is not just to build an interface for people’s work in web3; we also want to help build the underlying graph so that others can build on it as well. Here’s where we’re focused with the beta:\n\n* Integrating data from protocols and apps that define web3 contributions, such as Mirror, Snapshot, POAP, and others\n* Enrich your Backdrop profile, making sure others know what you are all about when contributing to web3 \n* Get notified whenever people you care about are working on something new, or start contributing to a new project\n\nIt's still early days, and we want to listen to the community. So, you can take [Backdrop for a spin](https://backdrop.so) and let us know what you want to see us build next.\n\nOn the organization side, we are focused on 3 core things:\n\n* Structuring our token, tokenomics and distributing initial ownership to contributing founders and strategic partners \n* Raising funds to allow Lighthouse to recruit and maintain experienced and high-performing contributors\n* Lightweight definitions for processes, governance, and ways of working that will shape our Season 01 work and beyond\n\nThroughout S01 we will put in place all that is necessary to let token owners participate more actively and inform priorities for our S02. More information on that soon.\n\n## Get on board!\n\nIf your thing is building great products, **come and join us**!

{"id": "-6T9iLomPF63q3JxQHMq37dpXq28kWseX8iytraFtS8", "title": "Ski Faster with Avalanche (AVAX)", "body": "**Avalanche (AVAX)**\n\nIf you ever find yourself backcountry skiing and caught in an Avalanche, do NOT ski faster - try and move sideways, out of the path of the oncoming onslaught of snowy death. If you instead find yourself running dApps on the Avalanche blockchain, well then ski as fast as you want!\n\nLaunched on mainnet by Cornell researcher Emin Gün Sirer in 2020, Avalanche is a Layer 1 Proof-of-Stake blockchain with a focus on improved contract speed and lower transaction costs when compared with legacy L1 systems. Avalanche has complete compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to easily port existing applications with a top-notch user experience. \n\nAvalanche’s ease-of-use, technological innovation, token performance, and growing ecosystem all make it a formidable contender to become a household crypto name alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. \\n \n\n**Superior Blockchain Technology**\n\nThe network consists of three distinct blockchains: X-Chain (for asset exchanges), P-Chain (for subnet creation), and C-Chain (for EVM contract execution). Avalanche’s primary network is a special subnet which validates contracts across all three chains. Becoming a validator on a custom subnet requires the user to stake 2,000 AVAX, Avalanche’s token. The Proof-of-Stake method reduces barriers to entry for validators to join the network, furthers platform decentralization, and uses less energy than Proof-of-Work systems. Thus, Avalanche makes it easy for users to stake their tokens and earn with limited up-front cost. Avalanche’s performance also proves to be superior when compared to other Layer 1 blockchains.\n\n![Note: Transactional finality from Ava Labs, but test have shown sub-second validation.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P50du-2HnxM4sj0i2FZYf.png?height=288&width=576)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ro13tOHT3wVQWvJPQJDPn.png?height=288&width=576)\n\nAvalanche boasts a transactional throughput time of over 4,500 transactions per second, transactional finality in under two seconds, CPU-optimal energy efficiency, and thousands of validator nodes with an 80% parameterized safety threshold making it impermeable to 51% attacks. These impressive stats combined with reduced transaction costs make it an attractive alternative chain for both existing and new crypto projects. \\n \n\n**Flexible Ecosystem**\n\nAvalanche has a robust existing ecosystem of dApps across DeFi, institutional products, and NFTs. The three chain setup allows for maximum performance for a variety of use cases, unlike say Ethereum which is a one-size-fits-all solution. The X-Chain is optimized for DeFi projects such as [Pangolin](https://pangolin.exchange/), or [SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/) which has since been bridged from Ethereum. Governance protocols for institutions can be built on top of P-Chain subnets, allowing for proprietary chains across numerous industry verticals. For example, the [Congress of Quintana Roo](https://www.congresoqroo.gob.mx/), a state in Mexico, utilizes Avalanche for governance decisions within their legislative body. The C-Chain API allows for the creation of smart contracts which enables easy porting of non-native applications with EVM compatibility to the Avalanche chain. The [Topps NFT](https://toppsnfts.com/) product originally existed on the WAX chain, but has since adopted Avalanche. Furthermore, Avalanche recently released a beta version of its Bridge, making it easy to connect wallets such as Metamask and Coinbase to transfer assets off of the Ethereum chain and onto Avalanche quickly and securely. The flexibility and scalability of Avalanche’s various chains make it an incredibly robust blockchain with an ever expanding ecosystem of projects.\n\n![Avalanche TVL](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ngBji0jF1kGiN8ZSYuzjn.png?height=716&width=1390)\n\nA variety of liquidity pools and trading platforms have also emerged on the Avalanche platform. Projects such as [Benqi](https://benqi.fi/) and [Trader Joe](https://www.traderjoexyz.com/#/home) have considerable funds locked up. TVL on Avalanche is nearly $3 billion with 42% coming from Benqi alone which promises distribution of QI tokens in exchange for providing AVAX liquidity.\n\n**AVAX Performance / Funding**\n\nAvalanche’s AVAX token is currently trading \\~$63 (as of 9/21/2021), up \\~350% since the start of August. This places AVAX as the 11th largest cryptocurrency in the world with a market cap of $13.84 billion, putting it ahead of established tokens such as Uniswap and Terra.\n\n![Avalanche 3-Month Price Chart](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CE6VTXrnm3VKaAaII_r5H.png?height=771&width=1456)\n\nThe most recent price surge comes after news of a $230 million private token sale to a syndicate of investors led by Polychain, Three Arrows Capital, and R/Crypto. Proceeds from the sale will be used to support the Avalanche ecosystem which will further drive developer interest to the blockchain. As DeFi continues to grow (and ETH gas fees continue to rise), support from the Avalanche team will be crucial in gaining developers trust and confidence in the platform.\n\n**Takeaways and Conclusion**\n\nAvalanche’s three-network architecture is an impressive solution for developers across a variety of dApps. This is aided by the Bridge which makes porting existing projects seamless. It is expected that there will be more Avalanche users as the ecosystem begins to grow (namely in the DeFi space), and the AVAX token continues to perform well. With speed and cost outpacing that of other Layer 1 networks, Avalanche is a favorite to emerge as a major player in the race for the best blockchain to develop on top of. Ski fast my friends -- Avalanche lets you.\n\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* <https://www.avax.network/>\n* <https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-avalanche-the-layer-1-blockchains-ecosystem-unpacked/>\n* <https://defillama.com/chain/Avalanche>\n* <https://docs.avax.network/learn/platform-overview>\n* <https://messari.io/charts/avalanche/price>\n* <https://www.securities.io/investing-in-avalanche-avax-everything-you-need-to-know/>\n* <https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/avalanche-raises-230-million-from-private-sale-of-avax-tokens/#:\\~:text=Avalanche%2C%20a%20relatively%20new%20blockchain,some%20well%2Dknown%20crypto%20funds.&text=You%20can%20run%20Dapps%20>", "timestamp": 1633540038, "digest": "cxov-Lo9LgxoXj7PeGQgh7IVqztRH8VPt7svqfHZPeA", "contributor": "0xDbF9caB55c2cFfca4F87489D27248E021B6b1d7a"}

Una; que una parte de la población, sustituida a nivel productivo por máquinas, tiende a verse anulada y, sin planes de adaptación, a desaparecer. De esta forma se abre un nuevo paradigma, el de una humanidad que debe hallar su propio encaje ante su propia creación, las máquinas. Dos; la felicidad se puede comprar más y mejor con, eso sí, mucho dinero. Cuántas veces habrás escuchado eso de que el dinero no da la felicidad para que, si sigues leyendo, en unas pocas líneas se te vaya a caer el mito.\n\nDurante el último año, los NFT (acrónimo de Non Fungible Token, en español Ficha No Canjeable) han propiciado un impulso histórico a las criptomonedas desde áreas tan diversas como el baloncesto o la pintura. Nuevas e históricas casas de subastas o, asociaciones deportivas, han decidido aprovechar la explosión de las FNC (ahora le tocaba el turno al acrónimo pero en español) para revolucionar ciertos conceptos, mercados y cuotas de negocio. A la venta de las ya conocidas canastas, tapones y otros virtuosismos de la NBA, ahora también debemos sumar esos momentos únicos, mágicos e irrepetibles de los que formaste parte y te gustaría hacer tuyos en propiedad. Como la tradicional foto del parque de atracciones en la montaña rusa. O ese instante antes de caer al agua descendiendo los rápidos del Colorado. Todo esto con una diferencia. Ahora no solo vas a poseer una réplica del instante, sino que, a falta de poder comprar un terrenito en la Luna -operación que sin duda será más económica que el parqué inmobiliario de las grandes urbes-, en este nuevo mercado, si lo pagas, pasarás a ser dueño legítimo de un instante, de una milésima de segundo en el tiempo y la historia. ¿Es, o no, un concepto poderoso?\n\n![NBA Top Shots](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3a%2f%2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2fpublic%2fimages%2f37118ba0-55b2-414e-a6c4-bfa4ab84999d_1565x759.png)\n\nEl negocio de NFTs de la única e inimitable superliga por excelencia, la NBA, es tan variado que, pretendiéndolo, pero sin saber muy bien hacia dónde les dirigiría tal disrupción, han abierto una brecha en sus propias estructuras de lo bueno y lo malo. ¿Qué vale más?, ¿una caída absurda del jugador fetiche del equipo del año, o el momento clave que te dio la canasta del campeonato (ya sea un tapón, un tiro, un mate o, de nuevo, una bochornosa caída)?. La clave, al parecer, está en la importancia de la rareza, en ese momento en el qué cambió la historia. El abanico de posibilidades es tal que las estructuras del bien y el mal, de lo bueno y lo malo, se desmoronan tras, como mínimo, 2000 años de historia reciente. ¡Y la disrupción no ha hecho más que empezar!\n\nDe acuerdo con los datos facilitados por la NBA, existen en torno a 460.000 coleccionistas de los llamados Top Shots (esos momentos únicos de los que hablamos) que durante el mes de abril de 2021 han realizado unas 4 millones de transacciones. Tal vez estos números no parezcan gran cosa a simple vista, pero ese mismo mes de abril se vendió una ficha no canjeable con LeBron James como protagonista por $400.000. Entre octubre de 2020 (momento en que los Top Shot empezaron a comercializarse) y febrero de 2021 (último mes recogido en los informes de esta liga de baloncesto), se recaudaron 230 millones de dólares por NFTs. Durante el mes de febrero hubo un día, un único día, en el que se facturaron 32 millones de dólares en Top Shots. En 24 horas.\n\nTop Shots, además de ser la forma comercial a la que referirse sobre el producto, es la plataforma de venta en sí misma, y una compañía de Dapper Labs -empresa canadiense encargada de implementar y gestionar las entrañas del sistema a nivel tecnológico-, en colaboración con la NBA, que es quien dota de contenido visual y legal a la plataforma.\n\nCada transacción de venta está cargada con un 5% sobre el precio de venta en conceptos de gestión. Dicho porcentaje se reparte entre Top Shot, NBA y el sindicato de jugadores. Así mismo, dentro del ecosistema de ligas deportivas o de federaciones estadounidenses, otros son los proyectos en torno a los NFTs o FNCs, como la venta de tickets conmemorativos por parte de equipos concretos o la creación de nuevas criptomonedas por parte de asociaciones como UFC (compañía gestora de competiciones de artes marciales en EEUU). La criptomoneda utilizada por NBA lleva por nombre Flow.\n\nEventos deportivos e industria musical son patas de una misma mesa, la del entretenimiento. Y otra gran compañía, pero en este caso dedicada a la música en directo, Live Nation, ha visto también el filón.\n\nNo hay que engañarse. Cuando el río suena, agua lleva. Si el CEO de la compañía líder a nivel global de música en directo dice que sigue muy de cerca los movimientos de la NBA en torno a los NFTs y, más concretamente, menciona su producto estrella Top Shots, como referente, significa que Live Nation está casi lista para entrar a escena y, además de llenar estadios a golpe de Alanis Morissette, Enrique Iglesias o Pet Shop Boys, vendernos lo que Michael Rapino ha venido a llamar ‘momentos mágicos’. ¿No pagarías por hacer tuyo ese instante en el que Alicia Keys te saludó especialmente a ti durante el concierto?, ¿no lo harías por ese preciso instante en el que Ricky Martin se secó el sudor con el pañuelo que le lanzaste en la plaza de toros de tu pueblo?\n\n![Live Nation se acerca al mundo de los NFT](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3a%2f%2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2fpublic%2fimages%2fe267c536-282d-4b8e-a6c0-166f9ca4945b_1600x800.jpeg)\n\nNo es extraño que, durante la conferencia trimestral de resultados de la compañía, Mr. Rapino haya lanzado ciertas claves tras ver los resultados de, en un solo trimestre (el primero de 2021), las transacciones en el mercado de los NFTs, que aunando los diferentes sectores y nichos que lo conforman, han ascendido a 2.000 millones de dólares según [los análisis de NonFungible](https://nonfungible.com/subscribe/nft-report-q1-2021), un proyecto que monitoriza transacciones de criptomonedas a tiempo real.\n\nLa música, para entendernos, es la invitada que confirmó su asistencia a la fiesta pero que llega con retraso a causa de un atasco de tráfico llamado coronavirus, a una fiesta actualmente protagonizada por el mundo del arte -que de un plumazo y gracias a las operaciones monitorizadas por blockchain, tendría en la mano la respuesta a la poca opacidad que siempre se le achaca-, y los distintos segmentos de artículos coleccionables ya mencionados como, por ejemplo, en el mundo del deporte.\n\n[Se calcula que](https://www.atvenu.com/post/importance-of-merchandise) una gira de 15 fechas que pueda arrastrar una media de 20.000 personas por concierto (una gira Live Nation cualquiera), puede arrojar un beneficio medio de $19.000 en merchandise por show. Por la parte baja de la tabla, si nos centramos en salas con no menos capacidad de 500 personas, las ventas pueden girar en torno a unos $1.700. Por el momento y sin profundizar en detalles, pero con el convencimiento de que si ofreces algo único al fan éste lo pagará con su misma alma si fuera posible, la compañía valora vender estos momentos mágicos combinados con la compra de las entradas del concierto y capturarlos en algún instante de toda la experiencia que engloba el show.

Many are still licking the wound. Among the most adversely affected groups are the bitcoin miners. The general sentiment is that this bear market will last for a while, and then bitcoin will come back to make new all time highs. However, very few have done enough fundamental analysis from a bitcoin mining perspective to quantify the future upside. This article makes an effort to predict the intermediate term upper bound of bitcoin price. Let’s start with the conclusion first.\n\n**Bitcoin price is very unlikely to stay above $60K for a few months before the next halving. In other words, bitcoin may have topped before 2024. Accordingly, bitcoin price volatility drops to a point that makes bitcoin a real great store of value.**\n\nThe key culprit is electricity capacity. The world produces roughly 30 trillion KWh of electricity, out of which China counts for a lion’s share of around 30%. Another amazing fact is that almost 100% of electricity growth is from China. Excluding China, the world electricity growth is pretty much flat. For instance, the US electricity production has stayed flat at around 4 trillion KWh annually for the last decade.\n\n![World Production Growth](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*cSJGReAT6donNwVx)\n\n![Production by Country](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*o6jdUYnvTYJ6BIZc)\n\nA May 2021 Harvard Business Review article quoted that [bitcoin consumes 0.55% of the world’s electricity production](https://hbr.org/2021/05/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-actually-consume). Recent bitcoin hash rate crash confirms that 70% of mining was in China before the crackdown, i.e. only 30% of mining was outside of China. A quick calculation shows only 0.24% ( = 1 \\* 0.55% \\* 30% / 70%) of total electricity capacity outside of China was used for bitcoin mining. Now that China is offline, to just refill the capacity, we need to boost up bitcoin utilization rate to 0.79% ( = 0.55% / 70%) from 0.24%. That is a net increase of more than 200%. Given that the electricity production growth rate outside of China is close to zero, such an increase is extremely unlikely if not impossible.\n\nLet’s assume that bitcoin is so popular that countries manage to allocate 1% of capacity for bitcoin mining. The current average electricity price for normal residential and industrial usages is roughly $0.10. Thus, total annual electricity cost for bitcoin mining world wide would be $20 billion ( = 30 trillion \\* 70% \\* $0.10).\n\nIn a sufficiently competitive market, mining rigs can be manufactured at much lower cost, compared to electricity. Mining rigs are basically semiconductor chips, with a price curve typically following Moore’s law. Whereas electricity is heavy infrastructure with a price curve that is mostly linear. That is why we believe electricity will be the primary portion of the overall cost in the bitcoin mining industry.\n\nBefore the next halving in 2024, bitcoin awards 900 coins daily or 328,500 coins a year. A sustainable bitcoin price can be extrapolated by total electricity cost divided by number of coins. So we come up with a roughly $60K price target ( \\~= $20B / 328K).\n\nEven such estimation needs to adjust lower. Remember that miners also get rewarded by transaction fees, which covers part of the electricity cost. So the electricity cost carried to bitcoin price is even lower.\n\nYou may wonder what if bitcoin price just goes above $60K and stays for a few months. What would happen? The society will run into chaos, because of lack of electricity for normal daily life. It is that simple.\n\nSuch an unsustainable bitcoin price would also amplify environmental concerns. It is hard to imagine bitcoin could still be mined mostly by renewable energy when the whole world excluding China is running out of capacity.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that bitcoin price may have already topped in the current halving cycle, primarily due to electricity capacity constraints. If this is proven to be true, it might be a great moment, as bitcoin has grown up. Bitcoin could be traded in the range between $30K and $60K. The volatility is in line with major major currencies. Bitcoin may indeed become a store of value with much better inflation protection than any fiat currency.", "timestamp": 1633541762, "digest": "eP8A9spvEs36st8kExY-wIiBzqM0HfIfElzfXjItDw4", "contributor": "0x6bB6c0BE4847E1432130353Af693E33c66778F3e"}

As the Metaverse evolves, we can break free from our physical environment and enjoy a world of limitless possibilities, connections, and adventures. That’s why we’re launching the Metaverse Travel Agency (MTA), and our inaugural NFT wearable, the Metahelmet.\n\nAlongside our official partners, **Decentraland** and **The** **Sandbox**, the MTA is on a mission to collaborate with and support those who will build the future of the Metaverse. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin unveiling the MTA creative universe, featuring layered storylines, community events and challenges, partnership activations, and more. And within the year, the MTA will become the link between metaverses, launching the space into a new, interconnected stratosphere.\n\n***In short, we are investing in the future of the Metaverse — and we want you to be a part of it.***\n\nOn October 7th, we’ll be dropping our flagship collection: The Metahelmets. This collection of 10101 unique Metahelmets are among the first programmatically generated wearable collections in the NFT space. Every helmet is unique and programmatically generated from over 120 custom 3D traits — visors, holographic projectors, outer shells, screens, and more. 3D assets that you can interact with right out of the box. \n\nMetahelmets are also equipped with a special display where users can upload any of their favourite NFTs directly on their Metahelmet, this feature will be available soon after launch and will be accessible on our website using “The Quantum Machine”.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1380/1\\*-pPrYZtwWDzGVNtdB-cb-w.gif)\n\nThe Metahelmets aren’t just another NFT, they’re your key to unlock an ever-expanding creative universe. We believe in crafting an unmatched experience for our community, and the Metaverse itself. When users acquire a Metahelmet, they gain access to exclusive challenges, quests, and rewards. We’ve been giving some users a sneak peek into our world over at theMTA.io, and have had thousands complete our first scavenger hunt and join the community.\n\n**Whatever avatar you identify as, an ape, cat, punk, dog kaiju, we can all be Metanauts.**\n\n**The MTA will also be live in Decentraland and The Sandbox.** After our launch we will start building an NFT gated headquarters that will allow MTA members to embark on quests in their respective virtual worlds, and participate in community bounties and challenges. Even better, your unique Metahelmet will be wearable in both Decentraland and The Sandbox soon after launch. Not only will you be able to wear your Metahelmet in the Metaverse, the MTA also has a partnership in the works with an Augmented Reality platform (TBA) that will allow owners to wear their helmets using AR.\n\n**As more and more avatar projects declare 3D models in their post launch roadmaps. The MTA and their Metahelmets will already be waiting in the Metaverse ready to be donned by their proud owners. A symbol of pride and togetherness with their community and a unifying factor in their borderless identity across multiple metaverses.**\n\nAs a team, we see the massive potential hidden inside the Metaverse. Much like the physical universe, innovation will fast track evolution of the Metaverse — and we want to fuel every part of it. The MTA community will soon grow to include more partners, more lore, and more exclusive opportunities for token holders.\n\n**We envision the Metahelmet as an emblem of unity for metaverse projects, and a beacon of more collaborations to come.**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*E9ezeJwtgzTxeRiYgoEKFg.png)\n\n**ABOUT THE M.T.A.**\n\nThe M.T.A. is on a mission to organize and support those who will build the future of the Metaverse. The project is actively growing and will soon unveil its own creative universe, featuring layered storylines, community events and challenges, partnership activations, and more. In the coming year, the M.T.A will become the bridge between metaverses that pushes the space into a new, interconnected stratosphere. The project is powered by Kollectiff, a creative tech studio dedicated to launching moonshots in the metaverse and beyond.\n\n**Links:**\n\n[Web](https://themta.io/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/theMTAofficial)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/themta)", "timestamp": 1633541596, "digest": "es6OQt-NISUgE2_PK7K7TshN1KBfJlFvztdk70YOQMo", "contributor": "0xfc37F6c03229c8F9c4D8d725E158966e13EdfA59"}

{"id": "bYGGzlxgTREY87GU8xKKhjBKUDiGZCEpYotpwaa1fNA", "title": "Governance as a Source of Value", "body": "### How the DeFi Blueprint Aligns Market Incentives with Societal Values\n\nBy [Sam McCarthy](https://twitter.com/samccarthy27)\n\n\\**Part 2 of a 2 part essay series on the current state of decentralized governance in crypto. This essay follows “Make Decentralized Governance Great (Again?).”*\n\nDecentralized governance implemented through DAOs encourages open participation in the development of the DeFi industry. By either purchasing or earning governance tokens, actors not only have the opportunity to share in the risk and reward associated with the monetization of a new financial system, but also the incentive to define the economic and social impact that system will have. Ideally, you purchase a governance token because you like the project and begin sharing ideas to make its token price go up. These tokens represent not only a financial stake in the protocol, but also membership in a community, the ability to influence the protocol, and a track record of participation.\n\nMany cryptoassets today, particularly those within DeFi, also grant holders claims on a portion of protocol cash flows. This gives the tokens very quantifiable value, which [can even be modeled by discounted cash flow analyses](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-case-for-100-sushi) favored by traditional financial institutions. However, this has left many to wonder whether \"pure\" governance tokens, which only carry rights to partake in protocol governance, are valueless.\n\nIn this essay, I introduce three theoretical perspectives from which we can view the term \"value\" and how they relate to cryptoassets. In addition, I discuss how the power granted by governance tokens confers value. Lastly, I propose governance power as a new fundamental metric in token valuation that can be measured by a \"governance premium\" assigned to a token's price.\n\n**THREE INTERPRETATIONS OF VALUE (& NFT MANIA)**\n\nThe word \"value\" can refer to the price or meaning of something, or more generally, to that which is morally cherished. As a result of this ambiguity, in his book, *Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value*, David Graeber presents three interrelated schools of thought around value: economic, sociological, and linguistic.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17c7235e-0c89-400b-ac9b-14840e3b528d_632x318.png)\n\nEconomically, an object's value is measured by what others are willing to give up, or exchange, to get it. This implies that value is determined by buyers in a marketplace. For example, as the non-fungible token (NFT) market rapidly expands, investors and speculators are currently rushing to outbid each other for new and artificially rare pieces. Right now, the value of some of these collections, such as [CryptoPunks](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks) and [EtherRock](https://etherrock.com/), have exploded because buyers are willing, and able, to pay elevated prices for them. However, this is not the only factor that determines the value of a particular NFT.\n\nGraeber describes sociological value as the \"conception of what is ultimately good, proper, or desirable in human life.\" Valuing something through this lens involves identifying the benefits an action or object holds within a greater social context. Corresponding to René Girard's concept of [mimetic desire](https://alexdanco.com/2019/04/28/secrets-about-people-a-short-and-dangerous-introduction-to-rene-girard/comment-page-1/), this definition of value implies that others influence the choices we make regarding not just what we want, but what we ought to want. Similar to traditional art, [NFTs grant holders status and reputation](https://cryptohayes.medium.com/rock-paper-scissors-says-go-a3641dfe132c). Likewise, a collection of prominent individuals (crypto-native investors and influencers) signal the desirability of these assets. By \"[shilling](https://decryptionary.com/dictionary/shilling/)\" certain NFTs, these individuals influence the preferences of others and the status attributed to individual pieces and collections. The digital commons of the Internet only amplifies the effect this has on an NFT's perceived value and price.\n\nLastly, the linguistic value of objects is measured by the differences between them. Ferdinand de Saussure, the pioneer of [semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics), claimed that in order to understand the meaning of a word, one must understand its place within a larger system. The definition of the word \"red,\" for example, is best understood as the color that isn't blue, green, or yellow. In this sense, to value NFTs you must understand their place within their collection (based on characteristics and rarity), as well as with the entire universe of NFTs (based on age, owners, and meaning within the larger crypto ecosystem). No NFT can be valued in isolation.\n\n**SOCIAL CONSENSUS**\n\nThrough the lens of all three interpretations of value, we can draw a simple conclusion: actions and objects become meaningful (or valuable) to humans by being incorporated into a social system. Graeber states, \"The realization of value is always, necessarily, a process of comparison; for this reason it always, necessarily, implies an at least imagined audience.\" For us, the \"imagined audience\" is society.\n\nWhen measuring an object's value, not only do we try to determine what others might be willing to exchange for it, but we consider what others agree it is worth within a social context. The result is that social consensus becomes the fundamental source of value; something has value if people agree that it has value. Viewed in parallel with traditional microeconomic theory, a consumer's utility is maximized when purchasing a good with the highest level of agree-upon social value.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly apparent with bitcoin. In [one of my favorite essay's on the subject](https://uncommoncore.co/unpacking-bitcoins-social-contract/), pseudonymous crypto researcher [Hasu](https://twitter.com/hasufl?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) states, \"The bitcoin token itself has no value. The value exists purely on the social layer.\" While blockchain technology adds credibility through programming and automation, the social layer determines the rules of bitcoin the blockchain, which ultimately gives bitcoin the cryptoasset its value. For this reason, you cannot replicate bitcoin by just \"[forking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development))\" its code. In order for the forked protocol to have any value, you have to obtain the buy-in of the community of people that underwrite its value. Hasu likens this process to running a presidential campaign as a financial investment.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4079cce6-a039-4c18-b8ce-61fbf534ee12_1190x1126.png)\n\nFor a variety of reasons, changing the ruleset of and exercising control over a DeFi protocol is far simpler than recreating bitcoin. And, as we will see, there are more definitive metrics to measure the value generated by exercising this power.\n\n**POWER AND INFLUENCE**\n\nStanding in opposition to legacy finance and internet companies, where control remains in the hands of the few, open digital communities assume direction of DeFi protocols. Each community leverages its own decentralized governance processes, which occur both on-chain (for more formal, binding changes) and off-chain (for voting, as well as discussion and sentiment checks). Ideas of all community members are evaluated in order to arrive at consensus regarding protocol execution and capital management. This bottoms-up approach allows projects to address and fund the most important initiatives as defined by the collective group of users, developers, and tokenholders.\n\nWhile I do not believe the only, or even the best, mechanism to implement decentralized governance process is through a one-token-one-vote scheme, I do believe that the token model is effective at translating social values into economic outcomes. In \"[A Blank Slate of State](https://unchainedpodcast.com/chris-burniske-a-blank-slate-of-state/),\" [Chris Burniske](https://twitter.com/cburniske?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) states, \"Protocols allow us to more granularly coordinate around social ideals, while still using the tool of free markets and competition to drive those outcomes.\" Tokens carrying governance rights allow people to freely express their ideas and beliefs by contributing to and voting on community proposals in an open forum. As a result, protocol resource allocation reflects the collective values of the many rather than the opaque motivations of the few. The most successful projects will inevitably be those that leverage the full functionality of this new asset class to produce products and services that generate the most utility for the widest set of stakeholders.\n\nIn \"[Cryptonetwork Governance As Capital](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/2/19/cryptonetwork-governance-as-capital),\" Placeholder partner [Joel Monegro](https://twitter.com/jmonegro?lang=en) defines governance as the power to change the rules of cryptoeconomic networks. For DeFi, the value of governance lies within this power - the power to influence the evolution of a new financial system, define the impact it will have on society, and accrue the associated status and reputation. All of this represents great value for individual actors within a wider social context. Thus, the right to exercise a certain level of control within DeFi, as represented by governance tokens, accrues monetary value in proportion to the perceived social value of participation.\n\n**THE GOVERNANCE PREMIUM**\n\nIn traditional finance, various types of premiums are added onto an asset's \"[intrinsic value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp)\" to reflect some amount of future uncertainty. For example, a liquidity premium is added onto the value of relatively illiquid assets to compensate the buyer for the possibility that the asset cannot be easily resold for cash at fair market value. Keeping with this type of valuation model, I present a new type of premium: the governance premium.\n\nThe governance premium equals the value of open participation in protocol governance and reflects the degree of perceived control an investor has over a project's future. Unlike other financial premiums, a governance premium is inversely related to uncertainty. The greater the perceived control granted by the token (and therefore, the less perceived uncertainty over the future of the protocol), the greater the governance premium added to the value of the token. Like all things crypto, the governance premium is set in the market.\n\nThere are three primary variables to consider while analyzing governance premiums: project growth, \"assets under management\" (AUM), and community strength.\n\n*GROWTH*\n\nAs a nation state grows in international prominence, so does the power of its leaders. Equivalently, as a protocol becomes more systemically important, the impact of wielding power over the protocol increases. This also applies to the reputation, status, and feeling of purpose that comes from participating and having value-added contributions within the protocol's community.\n\n*AUM*\n\nA DeFi project's \"AUM\" include its treasury and the [total value locked (TVL)](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/token-metrics-you-should-know) in its smart contracts. Treasury spending and resource allocation is usually determined through the project's governance proposal, discussion, and voting process. This can directly impact the tokenholders by voting in revenue-sharing cash flows. In addition, this can impact the owners of the assets locked in a project's contracts by changing key protocol parameters. As AUM increases, so does the value of capital controlled by governance participants, as well as the social consequences of that control.\n\n*COMMUNITY*\n\nThe most important factor is community, which includes developers, users, and tokenholders. Cultivating a strong community is essential for any DeFi project. To do this, it is necessary to promote the legitimacy of the project's governance process by engaging the community and increasing [their perceived control over the protocol](https://sammccarthy.substack.com/p/make-decentralized-governance-great). This makes members more motivated to contribute and the project more resistant to [plutocracy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html) (i.e. rule by \"whales\"). The strength of a community can be measured in various ways, including the level of its active participation and the effectiveness of its collective action.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14a490c2-9e8f-402e-bbc7-843678fa01cd_1180x341.png)\n\nThe governance premium reflects the fact that the power to participate in a community within a growing industry, power which impacts an ever broader set of stakeholders, confers value greater than that which is purely economic. We must ask ourselves then, how should we use this power? How do we leverage this opportunity to create a more open Internet, a more inclusive financial system, and a more innovative society?\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThrough Graeber's analysis, we are able to understand that value is created within society's conception of the desirable. The problem then becomes how to efficiently aggregate many individual ideas of what is valuable in a way that directs collective action towards the most beneficial ends for the largest number of people. In modern economies built on neoliberal ideology, the all-powerful \"free market\" is supposed to serve this purpose. However, corporate capitalism has led to monopolistic power, inefficient resource allocation, and rampant inequality. Status and power is based on the capital you have, not on the value you add. Thus, the majority of people's voices are not heard, nor their needs met. Furthermore, the financial services industry, which should be responsible for funding and providing liquidity for projects that will benefit all of society, instead enriches a small group of executives, shareholders, and wealthy individuals. I believe DeFi and the rest of the cryptoeconomy offer a promising alternative.\n\nIn Web3's vision of an open Internet, governance is the way digital communities, including DeFi protocol DAOs, signal what they consider desirable. Through the activities they incentivize and the projects they fund, community members shape the industry's future.

{"id": "Gw4LTtx4LpJErfRHnpBtOmtEhGR1pIl-qXaujsS5fCM", "title": "Governance as a Source of Value", "body": "### How the DeFi Blueprint Aligns Market Incentives with Societal Values\n\nBy [Sam McCarthy](https://twitter.com/samccarthy27)\n\n\\**Part 2 of a 2 part essay series on the current state of decentralized governance in crypto. This essay follows “Make Decentralized Governance Great (Again?).”*\n\nDecentralized governance implemented through DAOs encourages open participation in the development of the DeFi industry. By either purchasing or earning governance tokens, actors not only have the opportunity to share in the risk and reward associated with the monetization of a new financial system, but also the incentive to define the economic and social impact that system will have. Ideally, you purchase a governance token because you like the project and begin sharing ideas to make its token price go up. These tokens represent not only a financial stake in the protocol, but also membership in a community, the ability to influence the protocol, and a track record of participation.\n\nMany cryptoassets today, particularly those within DeFi, also grant holders claims on a portion of protocol cash flows. This gives the tokens very quantifiable value, which [can even be modeled by discounted cash flow analyses](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-case-for-100-sushi) favored by traditional financial institutions. However, this has left many to wonder whether \"pure\" governance tokens, which only carry rights to partake in protocol governance, are valueless.\n\nIn this essay, I introduce three theoretical perspectives from which we can view the term \"value\" and how they relate to cryptoassets. In addition, I discuss how the power granted by governance tokens confers value. Lastly, I propose governance power as a new fundamental metric in token valuation that can be measured by a \"governance premium\" assigned to a token's price.\n\n**THREE INTERPRETATIONS OF VALUE (& NFT MANIA)**\n\nThe word \"value\" can refer to the price or meaning of something, or more generally, to that which is morally cherished. As a result of this ambiguity, in his book, *Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value*, David Graeber presents three interrelated schools of thought around value: economic, sociological, and linguistic.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17c7235e-0c89-400b-ac9b-14840e3b528d_632x318.png)\n\nEconomically, an object's value is measured by what others are willing to give up, or exchange, to get it. This implies that value is determined by buyers in a marketplace. For example, as the non-fungible token (NFT) market rapidly expands, investors and speculators are currently rushing to outbid each other for new and artificially rare pieces. Right now, the value of some of these collections, such as [CryptoPunks](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks) and [EtherRock](https://etherrock.com/), have exploded because buyers are willing, and able, to pay elevated prices for them. However, this is not the only factor that determines the value of a particular NFT.\n\nGraeber describes sociological value as the \"conception of what is ultimately good, proper, or desirable in human life.\" Valuing something through this lens involves identifying the benefits an action or object holds within a greater social context. Corresponding to René Girard's concept of [mimetic desire](https://alexdanco.com/2019/04/28/secrets-about-people-a-short-and-dangerous-introduction-to-rene-girard/comment-page-1/), this definition of value implies that others influence the choices we make regarding not just what we want, but what we ought to want. Similar to traditional art, [NFTs grant holders status and reputation](https://cryptohayes.medium.com/rock-paper-scissors-says-go-a3641dfe132c). Likewise, a collection of prominent individuals (crypto-native investors and influencers) signal the desirability of these assets. By \"[shilling](https://decryptionary.com/dictionary/shilling/)\" certain NFTs, these individuals influence the preferences of others and the status attributed to individual pieces and collections. The digital commons of the Internet only amplifies the effect this has on an NFT's perceived value and price.\n\nLastly, the linguistic value of objects is measured by the differences between them. Ferdinand de Saussure, the pioneer of [semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics), claimed that in order to understand the meaning of a word, one must understand its place within a larger system. The definition of the word \"red,\" for example, is best understood as the color that isn't blue, green, or yellow. In this sense, to value NFTs you must understand their place within their collection (based on characteristics and rarity), as well as with the entire universe of NFTs (based on age, owners, and meaning within the larger crypto ecosystem). No NFT can be valued in isolation.\n\n**SOCIAL CONSENSUS**\n\nThrough the lens of all three interpretations of value, we can draw a simple conclusion: actions and objects become meaningful (or valuable) to humans by being incorporated into a social system. Graeber states, \"The realization of value is always, necessarily, a process of comparison; for this reason it always, necessarily, implies an at least imagined audience.\" For us, the \"imagined audience\" is society.\n\nWhen measuring an object's value, not only do we try to determine what others might be willing to exchange for it, but we consider what others agree it is worth within a social context. The result is that social consensus becomes the fundamental source of value; something has value if people agree that it has value. Viewed in parallel with traditional microeconomic theory, a consumer's utility is maximized when purchasing a good with the highest level of agree-upon social value.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly apparent with bitcoin. In [one of my favorite essay's on the subject](https://uncommoncore.co/unpacking-bitcoins-social-contract/), pseudonymous crypto researcher [Hasu](https://twitter.com/hasufl?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) states, \"The bitcoin token itself has no value. The value exists purely on the social layer.\" While blockchain technology adds credibility through programming and automation, the social layer determines the rules of bitcoin the blockchain, which ultimately gives bitcoin the cryptoasset its value. For this reason, you cannot replicate bitcoin by just \"[forking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development))\" its code. In order for the forked protocol to have any value, you have to obtain the buy-in of the community of people that underwrite its value. Hasu likens this process to running a presidential campaign as a financial investment.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4079cce6-a039-4c18-b8ce-61fbf534ee12_1190x1126.png)\n\nFor a variety of reasons, changing the ruleset of and exercising control over a DeFi protocol is far simpler than recreating bitcoin. And, as we will see, there are more definitive metrics to measure the value generated by exercising this power.\n\n**POWER AND INFLUENCE**\n\nStanding in opposition to legacy finance and internet companies, where control remains in the hands of the few, open digital communities assume direction of DeFi protocols. Each community leverages its own decentralized governance processes, which occur both on-chain (for more formal, binding changes) and off-chain (for voting, as well as discussion and sentiment checks). Ideas of all community members are evaluated in order to arrive at consensus regarding protocol execution and capital management. This bottoms-up approach allows projects to address and fund the most important initiatives as defined by the collective group of users, developers, and tokenholders.\n\nWhile I do not believe the only, or even the best, mechanism to implement decentralized governance process is through a one-token-one-vote scheme, I do believe that the token model is effective at translating social values into economic outcomes. In \"[A Blank Slate of State](https://unchainedpodcast.com/chris-burniske-a-blank-slate-of-state/),\" [Chris Burniske](https://twitter.com/cburniske?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) states, \"Protocols allow us to more granularly coordinate around social ideals, while still using the tool of free markets and competition to drive those outcomes.\" Tokens carrying governance rights allow people to freely express their ideas and beliefs by contributing to and voting on community proposals in an open forum. As a result, protocol resource allocation reflects the collective values of the many rather than the opaque motivations of the few. The most successful projects will inevitably be those that leverage the full functionality of this new asset class to produce products and services that generate the most utility for the widest set of stakeholders.\n\nIn \"[Cryptonetwork Governance As Capital](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/2/19/cryptonetwork-governance-as-capital),\" Placeholder partner [Joel Monegro](https://twitter.com/jmonegro?lang=en) defines governance as the power to change the rules of cryptoeconomic networks. For DeFi, the value of governance lies within this power - the power to influence the evolution of a new financial system, define the impact it will have on society, and accrue the associated status and reputation. All of this represents great value for individual actors within a wider social context. Thus, the right to exercise a certain level of control within DeFi, as represented by governance tokens, accrues monetary value in proportion to the perceived social value of participation.\n\n**THE GOVERNANCE PREMIUM**\n\nIn traditional finance, various types of premiums are added onto an asset's \"[intrinsic value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp)\" to reflect some amount of future uncertainty. For example, a liquidity premium is added onto the value of relatively illiquid assets to compensate the buyer for the possibility that the asset cannot be easily resold for cash at fair market value. Keeping with this type of valuation model, I present a new type of premium: the governance premium.\n\nThe governance premium equals the value of open participation in protocol governance and reflects the degree of perceived control an investor has over a project's future. Unlike other financial premiums, a governance premium is inversely related to uncertainty. The greater the perceived control granted by the token (and therefore, the less perceived uncertainty over the future of the protocol), the greater the governance premium added to the value of the token. Like all things crypto, the governance premium is set in the market.\n\nThere are three primary variables to consider while analyzing governance premiums: project growth, \"assets under management\" (AUM), and community strength.\n\n*GROWTH*\n\nAs a nation state grows in international prominence, so does the power of its leaders. Equivalently, as a protocol becomes more systemically important, the impact of wielding power over the protocol increases. This also applies to the reputation, status, and feeling of purpose that comes from participating and having value-added contributions within the protocol's community.\n\n*AUM*\n\nA DeFi project's \"AUM\" include its treasury and the [total value locked (TVL)](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/token-metrics-you-should-know) in its smart contracts. Treasury spending and resource allocation is usually determined through the project's governance proposal, discussion, and voting process. This can directly impact the tokenholders by voting in revenue-sharing cash flows. In addition, this can impact the owners of the assets locked in a project's contracts by changing key protocol parameters. As AUM increases, so does the value of capital controlled by governance participants, as well as the social consequences of that control.\n\n*COMMUNITY*\n\nThe most important factor is community, which includes developers, users, and tokenholders. Cultivating a strong community is essential for any DeFi project. To do this, it is necessary to promote the legitimacy of the project's governance process by engaging the community and increasing [their perceived control over the protocol](https://sammccarthy.substack.com/p/make-decentralized-governance-great). This makes members more motivated to contribute and the project more resistant to [plutocracy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html) (i.e. rule by \"whales\"). The strength of a community can be measured in various ways, including the level of its active participation and the effectiveness of its collective action.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14a490c2-9e8f-402e-bbc7-843678fa01cd_1180x341.png)\n\nThe governance premium reflects the fact that the power to participate in a community within a growing industry, power which impacts an ever broader set of stakeholders, confers value greater than that which is purely economic. We must ask ourselves then, how should we use this power? How do we leverage this opportunity to create a more open Internet, a more inclusive financial system, and a more innovative society?\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThrough Graeber's analysis, we are able to understand that value is created within society's conception of the desirable. The problem then becomes how to efficiently aggregate many individual ideas of what is valuable in a way that directs collective action towards the most beneficial ends for the largest number of people. In modern economies built on neoliberal ideology, the all-powerful \"free market\" is supposed to serve this purpose. However, corporate capitalism has led to monopolistic power, inefficient resource allocation, and rampant inequality. Status and power is based on the capital you have, not on the value you add. Thus, the majority of people's voices are not heard, nor their needs met. Furthermore, the financial services industry, which should be responsible for funding and providing liquidity for projects that will benefit all of society, instead enriches a small group of executives, shareholders, and wealthy individuals. I believe DeFi and the rest of the cryptoeconomy offer a promising alternative.\n\nIn Web3's vision of an open Internet, governance is the way digital communities, including DeFi protocol DAOs, signal what they consider desirable. Through the activities they incentivize and the projects they fund, community members shape the industry's future. As the ecosystem grows, these decisions have a greater and greater impact upon society. In addition to accruing value to tokens, all actors within the crypto space should recognize that this power comes with responsibility.\n\nAs the witnesses to the founding of an entirely new economic and social order - a new way to organize, coordinate, and innovate - we must ensure that it is built in a way that will benefit the most amount of people. Burniske warns, \"Markets are a powerful technology that is meant to serve society's virtues, but markets are dangerous as a virtue system in-and-of themselves. If we continue to allow markets to dictate our virtues, we will perpetuate a society that the majority now [whisper](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/what-do-people-really-think-about-capitalism/) is selfish, divisive, imbalanced - threatening, even.\" With everything in our world currently abstracted behind a veil of money and profit, we must regain the social context of our actions and recognize the value derived from them.\n\nMy hope is that in our current paradigm  where capital is abundant and people pay millions of dollars for JPEGs of rocks, social value - as measured by the impact our actions have within a larger system - will displace monetary value as the primary pursuit of economic actors.

Wouldn’t it be nice to earn $30 from this activity instead of it all going to Google?\n\nThe cost is the missed interest opportunity from staking. Staking generates an impressive yearly return (though I struggled to find an exact number, it’s likely related to broader tokenomics than a set APY).

First, megacities and towns lose their electric power, followed by water, gas, telecommunication, and the internet. It all suddenly just came to a halt. Rumors did emerge for a very short period inside the intelligence community around the world that said it was caused by a powerful computer virus.

Once she knew it was only a nightmare and realizes that they were both still inside the apartment, Catherine immediately hugs Mike with all her heart. As she hugs Mike, tears slowly fall from her eyes. She silents for a while and just keep holding her only son until all her fear subsides.\n\n\"… Mommy had a bad dream, Mike... I am so sorry if Mommy scares you, Sweetheart. I am so sorry...\" says Catherine.\n\nCatherine looks at Mike and with her warm-hearted motherly smile, she says, \"Promise me you will never go outside the apartment or open the front door without Mommy's permission? ... Can you do that for Mommy?\"\n\nSeveral minutes ago Mike was terrified when he heard his mother yelled his name while sleeping on the living room sofa, but somehow he knew his mother was having a bad dream.\n\n\"Yes, Mommy. Now can I go back and play again?\" says Mike.\n\nCatherine kisses Mike's forehead. He hugs him again and says, \"Mommy loves you, Mike. Mommy loves you…Yes, of course, Sweatheart, you can play.\"\n\nAfter finding comfort from her son, she lets Mike return to the dining table to play again with his toys.\n\nCatherine shakes her head and strokes her messy hair several times, then she gets up and walks towards the balcony. As she steps outside the balcony, she looks at the beautiful city of Albuquerque. She glances at the main street below and sees her car is still parked at the usual parking lot. She feels comfortable to see the street is busy with cars passing by and also people walking around. She smiles then takes a deep breath and felt so relieved. Catherine doesn’t see any white smoke or cloud covering parts of Albuquerque. Most of all, there is no weird old lady standing and stares at her car that late afternoon.\n\nWhile Catherine’s mood slowly turns back on again, her mobile phone rings several times. She rushes back inside her apartment closing the balcony door behind her. Catherine hopes the call is coming from Davis, but as she sees the caller id, she knew it was from Diana, Colonel Monk's wife, who lives several buildings away from her apartment.\n\nCatherine suddenly remembers that she had a promise to Diana to accompany her to the supermarket and to bring Mike along with her because Diana is also taking Alice, her 4 years old daughter. On her talk with Monk's wife, Catherine told Diana that she was fell asleep a while ago. She also told Diana about the bad dream she had and how scared she was but Diana was laughing so loud and starts making fun of Catherine. Diana asks, \"Mrs. Abigail? Seriously Catherine? Can't you think of a better monster to scared you in your dream than your elderly neighbor?\" Diana is trying to cheer her up and says Mrs. Abigail is probably doesn't has teeth anymore. Catherine laughs and her mood is getting even better. She tells Diana to pick her up in 10 minutes and to call her back as soon as she is near her apartment.\n\nJust eight minutes later, Catherine and Mike are ready to go and her phone rings. It was from Diana again. Catherine tells Diana that she and Mike are ready and will meet them in front of the apartment building.\n\nMinutes later, Catherine and Mike are walking down the stairs together. As they both reach the ground floor, Catherine's apartment key fell to the floor. She lets Mike's hand go but he suddenly runs and exits towards the main entrance door. Catherine picks up her apartment key and yells at Mike to slow down. As she passes in front of Mrs. Abigail's main apartment door, she notices the door was slightly open. All of the sudden, fear struck Catherine’s heart once again as the glimpse of images from her nightmare starts flashing back inside her mind. She slowly walks towards Mrs. Abigail’s door although this time, she doesn't see blood on the floor or wall or a dead neighbor cat lying around. For a moment, Catherine is carried away by her recent nightmare. Once she reaches the door, Beatrice suddenly jumps out from beside the door and Catherine was so surprised and almost loses her heartbeat. She was annoyed a bit but glad to see Beatrice is alive and well. Catherine thinks her nightmare is just a dream which she also finds her conclusion is absurd.\n\nCatherine: \"Well, hello, Mrs. Fat Cat…\"\n\nBeatrice: \"Meow! Meow! Meow!\"\n\nShe startles and follows Mike to the main street and sees Diana standing beside Mike and Alice. Diana smiles and says, \"Well, come on princess!\"\n\nCatherine responds to Diana just by smiling, then she takes her mobile phone out of her purse to see if she has received a message from Davis. Catherine walks to Diana's car while checking her mobile phone when Mrs. Abigail suddenly shows up from the side with her walker as she is returning to the apartment. Cathrine and Mrs. Abigail almost bump with each other if Catherine didn’t stop. She was so surprised and screams by accident while her mobile phone almost fell but she manages to grab it back. Catherine felt as if she was just struck by lightning and freezes. Mrs. Abigail didn’t hear Catherine's screams very well because she has a hearing problem but like Catherine, Mrs. Abigail was also caught in surprise.\n\nDiana calls Catherine from the driver's seat, \"Catherine!” and sees Catherine's face looks pale after she met Mrs. Abigail.\n\nFeeling awkward by the incident, Catherine continues walking to Diana’s car. They both look at each other and as always, Mrs. Abigail smiles at Catherine, but at that instant, Catherine can’t smile as she used to, so she keeps walking towards Diana's car without greeting Mrs. Abigail like she always did.\n\nKnowing Catherine seems in a hurry, Mrs. Abigail greets Catherine first.\n\nMrs. Abigail: \"Hello, Catherine. Why are you in a hurry, dear?\"\n\nCatherine stops then turns her body to answer Mrs. Abigail’s question. She says, \" ... Ye-s Mrs. Abigail. We’re taking the kids out ... Well, actually ... and ... I ... I noticed just now your apartment door was not closed properly.\"\n\nMrs. Abigail: \"O really?... Silly me, I probably forgot to close it when I went out.\"\n\nMrs. Abigail stands silent for a while and her eyes are looking at someplace nearby and then she asks Catherine. \"Catherine dear, do you remember if there is an Oaktree on that corner over there?\" Although holding her walker, she tries very hard to raise her left arm and point to a strange-looking Oaktree.\n\n\"What? ... Which tree Mrs. Abigail?\" Asks Catherine.\n\nMrs. Abigail: \"There! That Oaktree. I remember there was never any Oaktree over there. I've been living in this apartment for fifteen years and never see an Oaktree at that corner. Why everyone else is not noticing it?\"\n\n\"Catherine!\" Diana calls Catherine again and this time she waves to her from inside the car hoping she can speed things up on whatever conversation between Catherine and Mrs. Abigail is having.\n\nCatherine also wants the conversation to end right away because she doesn’t feel comfortable talking to Mrs. Abigail just yet. As soon as Catherine hears Diana is calling her, she takes it as an excuse.\n\nCatherine: \"Mrs. Abigail, I am sorry, we are in hurry today. I have to go now. See you later and take care.\"\n\nKnowing Catherine leaving her question unanswered, Mrs. Abigail feels offended. She nods her head and gives a quick smile to Catherine. Then she walks straight to the main building door without saying a word.\n\n## CHAPTER NINE\n\n### Bring it on!\n\n![Sikorsky U-70i Black Hawk (Illustration 11)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eE8orf1OKdbaT3XOvYrkx.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***August 2025, Inside a Sikorsky U-70i Black Hawk heading to the outer part of the First-Ring of the mist.***\n\nAs the day slowly turns to night, the Black Hawk was flying without any light. The pilot uses digital navigation and a thermal vision as they are making the final approach to an open field somewhere near Outpost-One. As the helo begins to descend, it will not land on the ground but it’ll hover at a certain height for the Bravo-One team to jump safely to the ground. The Black Hawk helicopter will airborne again and then closely monitor the Bravo-One team's secure perimeter from a certain altitude as it becomes the eyes and guardian in the sky. The pilot notifies the Bravo-One team to get ready through their communication unit.\n\nPilot: \"Bravo-One, Coast is clear. ETA 60 seconds.\"\n\nBravo-One leader: \"10-4. Watch our six.\"\n\nPilot: \"Roger-Tango, Bravo-One. Safe hunting.\"\n\nKevin, the Bravo-One team leader then nod his head to his unit. He lends his right-hand palm to the rest of the team and the team responded by putting their palms on top of each other.\n\nKevin: 'Live in honor!\"\n\nDanny: \"Fight with honor!\"\n\nStanley: \"Win with honor!\"\n\nJoe: \"Die in honor!\"\n\nThen they simultaneously say, \"NEVER TURN TO MONSTERS!\"\n\nKevin nodded his head again as the Bravo-One team routine ritual is completed and they are ready to conduct the mission.\n\nAs the helo arrived above the designated open field, the roaring sound and wind pressure from the Sikorsky U-70i Black Hawk powerful engine and massive blades scatter the surrounding mist, while dust particles on the ground float rapidly into the air. One by one the Bravo-One team jump safely to the ground and the helo quickly airborne again and the sudden noisy sound inside the misty forest slowly turn to silence.\n\n***17:07, Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the mist***\n\nAfter Officer Davis received the last transmission from Batman-six. Davis knows this time he is not entering a battlefield to do a one-on-one duel with the undead, but an all-out deathmatch against a horde of undead! He starts talking to himself while looking through his sniper scope and got emotional once the memory of Mike and Catherine appears in his mind. He tries to pump out all the courage left in him to face the impossible, “This has to end now. I don't know how you survive baby girl? Hopefully, I will find it out pretty soon … Just don’t you worry little girl, I’ll never leave you alone … Now it’s just going to be you, me, and hundreds of monsters that are chasing you from behind. Come on Davis! Do it for Mikey and Catherine! Hell yea!\n\n## CHAPTER TEN\n\n### Saving little red\n\n![(Illustration 12)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/emcScLxp07oQJaoYAX_zr.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***17:08. Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the misty forest***\n\nDavis is ready to go all hell break lose until a radio call suddenly comes in from Colonel Monk onboard AC-130J Ghostrider. The gunship is in the air not far from Davis’s last recorded coordinate. Batman-six has informed Eagle-One right after his last radio call with Davis.\n\nMonk: \"Batman-five, Batman-five, this is Eagle-One. Respond! Over.\n\nOnce Davis hears Monk's voice—his best friend, he felt so relieved and his morale is boosted. He immediately feels like he has the courage of a lion. Like intuition, Davis instantaneously got the escape plan he needed and has figured out what steps he must immediately do next.\n\nDavis: \"Batman-five to Eagle-One, requesting air support and escort to Outpost-One. Break. Hostile horde approaching 200 meters heading South to the beacon. Break. Turning the beacon on, now. Break. Going hot in less than three minutes. Over.\"\n\nMonk: \"Eagle-One to Batman five. Beacon status confirmed and detected. Break. Mapping the hostile horde area for visual. Break. Hostile horde detected, bearing North at 200 meters heading South to the beacon. Break. Waiting for confirmation to open fire. Over.\"\n\nDavis: “Batman-five to Eagle-One, that’s a 10-4. Break. Wait for my signal for the firing sequence. Over.”\n\nMonk: “Eagle-One to Batman-five, message received and understood. Break. Eagle-One standing by. Over and out.”\n\nJust as Davis finished the radio call, the little girl in a red dress suddenly fell to the ground. She was exhausted. Probably she has been brisk walking for the last two hours or more. Her face looks pale and thirsty. Without help, she’ll faint in less than five minutes and become a feast for the beasts.\n\nDavis too has seen the little girl will eventually turn tired, that is why he doesn't want to lose sight of her or the horde of the undead that keep chasing her. As the mist scatters by the stormy wind that keeps building above the misty forest, the visibility becomes apparent. The little girl and the horde of the undead are now clearly seen through Davis sniper’s scope and have entered Davis's shooting range. The scattering mist is going to be Davis's only advantage, but the storm above the misty forest is building up too fast, so is the wind speed. Davis does not want to lose another minute. As soon as the wind speed becomes stronger, he might encounter precision difficulty to get a direct hit onto the target. Using a suppressor that is mounted on the MRAD sniper rifle, Davis aims at the closest zombies that are too close to the little girl’s position and pose threats to her safety.\n\nThe distance between Davis and the little girl is around one hundred fifty meters away, while the hostile horde—which he identifies are Shamblers\\* but he also sees several Tangos\\* that walk slower than the Shamblers not in a far distance. The closest Shamblers are around forty-five meters away from the little girl’s position. Davis's prime concerns are the Tangos. He knew well that dealing with one Tango using a sniper rifle is not easy. If there are more of them, then Davis will need all the help he can get from Eagle-One armament.\n\nAs Davis aims at one of the three Shamblers that come close to the little girl, a radio call comes in from Bravo-One Team. Davis knows the cavalry has finally arrived!\n\nKevin: “Bravo-one to Batman-five, Bravo-one is on the ground. Break. Oscar-Mike Outpost-One. Break. Bravo-one standing by. Over.”\n\nDavis: “Batman-five to Bravo-one, Roger that Bravo-one. Hot in two minutes. Break. Do not follow the music room, I repeat, do not follow the music room. Break. No question. Break. Hold your position at Outpost-One. Do you copy? Over.”\n\nKevin: \"10-4 Batman-five. Bravo-One, out.”\n\nOnce Kevin has finished talking to Davis through the radio, he looks confused at Danny and asks, \"What the hell did he mean by music room?\"\n\nDanny was just about to ask the same thing, then he quickly looks at Stanley.\n\nStanley says, \"Don't look at me, I don't even know what the hell he is talking about!\"\n\nStanley, Kevin, and Danny look at Joe.\n\nJoe reply, \"Is Davis man...!\"\n\nThe sun is going to set, where the undead will hunt for prey. A little girl dressed in red is desperately needed help on one stormy night. The situation is tense, besides knowing all hell will probably break loose tonight, no one knows exactly what the outcome will be as the uneven battle will soon start to commence...\n\nThe sound of the battle horns of the living and the undead shall echo throughout the First-Ring of the misty forest.\n\n## CHAPTER ELEVEN\n\n### Headshot\n\n![(Illustration 13)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cRkJtGDHQlMmuIyv6Vcg3.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nDavis had just finished giving instructions to the Bravo-One team, then he returns hastily aiming at the three undead who are getting too close to the little girl in a red dress. She is still lying helplessly on the ground out of her exhaustion after being chased by a horde of undead for hours. Davis sees through his sniper scope and chooses an undead who is now only eight meters away from the little girl. Without the slightest hesitation, Davis opens fire. Equip with a suppressor, his sniper rifle made a quick low bass sound that can hardly be heard by the little girl or the noisy horde of the undead.\n\n\"Blaaab!\"\n\nThe bullet from Davis's sniper rifle starts singing and it was a direct hit. The sniper bullet pierces through the Shamblers' skull and it immediately fell to the ground. As the Zulu hit the ground, the little girl was surprised and terrified by the noise. She slowly regains consciousness after several seconds of a spontaneous blackout. Driven by fear and not knowing what happened, the little girl tries to crawl away from the undead corpse that recently kissed the ground several meters away from her. Desperately in need to stand up, she forces to push her body upward using her two weak arms, but her legs are shakier than her arms, and can't withhold her body. She falls again to the ground, just like the undead she tries to avoid.\n\n\"Blaaab...!\"\n\nA second bullet from Davis's sniper just made another direct headshot. The undead falls to the ground and make a sound like a small-size tree trunk hitting the ground.\n\n\"Blaaab...!\"\n\nThe third closest undead that poses a threat to the little girl is now eliminated.\n\nNow, Davis's distance to the little girl is approximately one hundred and forty-five meters away, while the closest horde of undead from the little girl is around forty-five meters away. Instantaneously, Davis's mind plays every possible scenario that may or may not happen if he exposes himself to the horde of the undead and the little girl. He has projected that if he sprints running to the little girl's position with his backpack, weapon, and ghillie suit on the misty forest rough terrain, he'll probably reach his destination in one minute; but he must not stop running until he reaches the little girl and saves her life.\n\nDavis has measured that to sprint run on rough terrain for a maximum of one minute while putting himself in a head-to-head position with a horde of undead is not going to be the smartest decision he makes in this critical rescue mission.\n\nHe also assumes the little girl may not see him as a friendly human rescuer, especially in her state of mind and exhaustion, she'll probably see Davis as a grizzly bear because of the ghillie suit; And if that happens, many unprecedented outcomes will make the situation even more difficult for him to save the helpless and frightening little girl.\n\nLastly, if he runs to the little girl, then he'll break the unproven myth that says whoever runs inside the First-Ring of the mist will not survive.\n\nAlthough Davis seems to has a sound plan to escape after he saves the little girl, but how he executes and begins this rescue mission, it’s all depends on him. He only has 10 more seconds to decide before the horde of undead is coming closer to the helpless little girl who is still lying half-conscious on the ground. He mumbles, “So what’s going to be, Davis?”\n\n## CHAPTER TWELVE\n\n### Blackout\n\n![The briefing room (Illustration 14)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qEnTKOQ1PGVMgDJaF56-8.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***01:30, Dubai, 24 days before Christmas, 2024. Somewhere in UAE and US joint operation military air force base.***\n\nOn the way to the Briefing Room, Davis can't stop thinking about Mike and Catherine. He misses them so much and also understands why both of them are upset with him, but this year he already prepared a big surprise for Mike and Catherine. Davis knows he can't compensate for his absence for not being at home with them all the time; nevertheless, a brand new Tesla car for Catherine and the latest console game which Mike always wanted since last year plus a fifteen days family tour to Europe could, at least, give them a joyful moment on Christmas Eve and New Year. Davis has planned the surprise gifts several months ago. So, on the fifth of December, he will return home and give Mike the new console game, while the brand new car will arrive on the eighth of December. On the same day, he will surprise them again by telling Catherine and Mike to pack their bags and get ready for a two weeks holiday trip to Europe…\n\nDavis enters the Briefing Room. He sees Monk waving at him and calls him to sit next to him. Both teams were also there, Eagle-One and Eagle-Two. The commanding officer who is in charge of the early morning briefing has not yet arrived. Davis sees most faces inside the briefing room are not looking comfortable, he also finds Monk a little bit tense but has not lost his sense of humor.\n\nMonk: \"Bond! Something just came up! It doesn’t look good.\"\n\nMonk sometimes calls Davis with his nickname 'Bond'. It is not a secret military call sign or anything, but it was Davis's nickname that he got from college. The nickname was given to Davis by his friends in the early days of college, where Monk and Davis also met and become best friends. In his college years, Monk and Davis were in one classroom, but they have not known each other yet. One time, the teacher told every student in the classroom to write about what they want to be after college? Each student must read it out loud in front of the class with the hope they'll want to know each other better, become more supportive of one another, finding the same interest, and build common ground.\n\nMonk is a good-looking teenager at the time. His hair is mostly what makes the girls at college have a crush on him. While Davis on the other hand is like the opposite of Monk. Though he is somehow good-looking, sadly, he is sloppy. He wears the same clothes every day and his hair is messy. He wears old sneakers and never likes talking to his classmate. If no one asks him, he rarely talks and is just busy with himself.\n\nAs Davis read out to the whole class that day, he said he wanted to join the military and become a SEAL team. Immediately almost all of his classmates, except Monk, were laughing at him. At the time, his friends see Davis as an untidy person, unorganized and messy. They think Davis's word is similar to “a poor man's voice that doesn't carry very far.”\n\nDavis was not pleased by his classmate's attitude and felt underestimated. Once he returned to his chair, Monk gave him a folded paper—though they barely know each other. Davis opened the paper, it read:\n\n*\"I persevere and thrive on adversity. My Nation expects me to be physically harder and mentally stronger than my enemies. If knocked down, I will get back up, every time. I will draw on every remaining ounce of strength to protect my teammates and to accomplish our mission. I am never out of the fight.*\n\n*I am joining too!*\n\n*Hi! I’m Monk.”*\n\nDavis knew every word in Monk’s letter, and it was a part of the US Military Navy SEAL’s Creed. Since then, their friendship grew until they both ended up becoming spec ops. Davis's friends in college started to give him a nickname, “bond”; not as James Bond, but a short version of the word “vagabond.” Davis never felt insulted by the nickname but instead, he was motivated by it because back then, he never knew the word was meant, ‘vagabond’. After he joined the corps, Monk told him what it was and they both laughed at their college days. He never lets anyone else calls him by that nickname besides Monk. He often calls Monk with the nickname ‘Key’ in return because Monk has a weird-looking tattoo on his back that looks like a key, but he also said to Monk that it can also be a short version of “Monk Key”.\n\n***01:33. Dubai, 24 days before Christmas. The Briefing Room.***\n\nDavis: “What's happening man? The briefing should begin later at 08:00 hours this morning, we haven't even rest yet? I was talking to Catherine and Mike just now....”\n\nMonk slightly raised his hand telling Davis to stop talking because he wants to explain something to him.\n\nMonk: “Our intel source just said that something big is happening around the globe and back home, they say we must be briefed about it immediately.”\n\nDavid: \"What? ... What happened?\"\n\nMonk: \"Not a clue, but we have entered DEFCON 4.\"\n\nAs soon as Davis knew that the whole nation has entered DEFCON 4, he promptly asks Monk.\n\nDavis: \"Have you told Diana?\"\n\nHe turns his face towards Davis and says: \"No, I haven't. The Pentagon says most part of the US has recently fallen into a sudden blackout and civilian cellular systems are having a connection problem.\"\n\nDavis: \"But … I was just talking to Catherine and Mike using video call?\"\n\nMonk: \"Probably that was minutes ago...They say it's still happening now...\"\n\nDavis: \"What?\"\n\nWhen Monk sees Davis becoming tense, he tries to calm his buddy and says, \"Look! I’m worried about Diana and Alice's safety too. The team was also talking about their families just before you came in. We all want to know what is happening back home? So, calm down.\"\n\nDavis's face turns uncomfortable as fear has just stabbed him right at the heart; like Monk and the rest of the military men sitting inside the briefing room.\n\n**(To be continued)**", "timestamp": 1633544642, "digest": "Qvn3QmERug13sfNZdzLd2WgqA32rzZaRe5t1tyuhkhU", "contributor": "0xc1C41e3606bF2756c09c95132F528012be17f724"}

Officers and servicemen including early survivors' health were thoroughly checked. They conduct mental and physical training, building concrete steel walls, digging trenches, and positioning barricades on the farthest part of the base. Installing booby traps, heavy machine guns, and sniper towers. They are constantly loading and unloading goods, manufacturing ammunition, planting vegetation, and many other duties. They have to prepare themselves for whatever may come, including the worse. Last, they regularly pray together and cherish the memory of their loved ones who were not able to escape on Z-Day.\n\nWhen Z-Day broke out and megacities around the world fall one by one like a domino to the hand of the mist, many eyewitnesses reported that strange things had happened at the same time. First, megacities and towns lose their electric power, followed by water, gas, telecommunication, and the internet. It all suddenly just came to a halt. Rumors did emerge for a very short period inside the intelligence community around the world that said it was caused by a powerful computer virus. It took less than forty-eight hours for megapolitan cities like New York, Shanghai, Mumbai, Moscow, London, and Washington DC to fall into the mist.\n\n***Gila Military Headquarter inside the Gila National Forest Park, New Mexico***\n\nOfficer Spencer is at the airfield tower monitoring the radio when a whispering radio call comes in. It’s from Officer Davis.\n\n\"Batman-six, Batman-six, this is Batman-five. Request immediate response! Over.\"\n\nOfficer Spencer is already on the radio and he immediately responds to the call.\n\nOfficer Spencer: \"Batman-five, this is Batman-six, what's your 10-20? Over.\"\n\nOfficer Davis: \"Batman-five to Batman-six, sending the coordinate now. Break. Request air support and immediate extraction over Cruzville, Apache Creek. Break. The situation is hostile. Do you copy? Over.\"\n\nOfficer Spencer: \"Batman-six to Batman-five, coordinate received. Break. Eagle-One and Bravo-One Oscar-Mike. Break. Do not engage the hostile enemy. Over.”\n\nOfficer Davis: \"Batman-five to Batman-six, that's a negative. Break. Survivor’s life is in danger! I repeat a survivor’s life is in danger! Over.\"\n\nAs he hears what Officer Davis has said, Officer Spencer and everyone who is working inside the airfield tower just stops and they all listening to Davis’s radio call. They look at each other and are in shock by what Davis had said. One way or the other, somehow they silently admit that Davis was right after all. For a moment, Officer Spencer’s mind wanders until a radio call comes in.\n\nOfficer Davis: \"Batman-five to Batman-six, request permission to engage and rescue the survivor. Do you copy? Over.\"\n\nHe immediately responds by giving Officer Davis further instructions.\n\nOfficer Spencer: \"Batman-six to Batman-five, rescue the survivor and retreat to Outpost-One. Get ready to activate your beacon. Stay safe. The cavalry is coming. Over.\"\n\nOfficer Davis: “10-4. Batman-five, Out.\"\n\n## CHAPTER EIGHT\n\n### The tree\n\n![The dark-looking Oaktree (Illustration 10)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NBL7gTouoNOxMUmUaWWNS.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***December 2024, Catherine's Residence***\n\nMike: \"Mommy, did you have a bad dream?\"\n\nAs Catherine awakens from her sleep, she sees Mike looking at her trying to wake her up. Once she knew it was only a nightmare and realizes that they were both still inside the apartment, Catherine immediately hugs Mike with all her heart. As she hugs Mike, tears slowly fall from her eyes. She silents for a while and just keep holding her only son until all her fear subsides.\n\n\"… Mommy had a bad dream, Mike... I am so sorry if Mommy scares you, Sweetheart. I am so sorry...\" says Catherine.\n\nCatherine looks at Mike and with her warm-hearted motherly smile, she says, \"Promise me you will never go outside the apartment or open the front door without Mommy's permission? ... Can you do that for Mommy?\"\n\nSeveral minutes ago Mike was terrified when he heard his mother yelled his name while sleeping on the living room sofa, but somehow he knew his mother was having a bad dream.\n\n\"Yes, Mommy. Now can I go back and play again?\" says Mike.\n\nCatherine kisses Mike's forehead. He hugs him again and says, \"Mommy loves you, Mike. Mommy loves you…Yes, of course, Sweatheart, you can play.\"\n\nAfter finding comfort from her son, she lets Mike return to the dining table to play again with his toys.\n\nCatherine shakes her head and strokes her messy hair several times, then she gets up and walks towards the balcony. As she steps outside the balcony, she looks at the beautiful city of Albuquerque. She glances at the main street below and sees her car is still parked at the usual parking lot. She feels comfortable to see the street is busy with cars passing by and also people walking around. She smiles then takes a deep breath and felt so relieved. Catherine doesn’t see any white smoke or cloud covering parts of Albuquerque. Most of all, there is no weird old lady standing and stares at her car that late afternoon.\n\nWhile Catherine’s mood slowly turns back on again, her mobile phone rings several times. She rushes back inside her apartment closing the balcony door behind her. Catherine hopes the call is coming from Davis, but as she sees the caller id, she knew it was from Diana, Colonel Monk's wife, who lives several buildings away from her apartment.\n\nCatherine suddenly remembers that she had a promise to Diana to accompany her to the supermarket and to bring Mike along with her because Diana is also taking Alice, her 4 years old daughter. On her talk with Monk's wife, Catherine told Diana that she was fell asleep a while ago. She also told Diana about the bad dream she had and how scared she was but Diana was laughing so loud and starts making fun of Catherine. Diana asks, \"Mrs. Abigail? Seriously Catherine? Can't you think of a better monster to scared you in your dream than your elderly neighbor?\" Diana is trying to cheer her up and says Mrs. Abigail is probably doesn't has teeth anymore. Catherine laughs and her mood is getting even better. She tells Diana to pick her up in 10 minutes and to call her back as soon as she is near her apartment.\n\nJust eight minutes later, Catherine and Mike are ready to go and her phone rings. It was from Diana again. Catherine tells Diana that she and Mike are ready and will meet them in front of the apartment building.\n\nMinutes later, Catherine and Mike are walking down the stairs together. As they both reach the ground floor, Catherine's apartment key fell to the floor. She lets Mike's hand go but he suddenly runs and exits towards the main entrance door. Catherine picks up her apartment key and yells at Mike to slow down. As she passes in front of Mrs. Abigail's main apartment door, she notices the door was slightly open. All of the sudden, fear struck Catherine’s heart once again as the glimpse of images from her nightmare starts flashing back inside her mind. She slowly walks towards Mrs. Abigail’s door although this time, she doesn't see blood on the floor or wall or a dead neighbor cat lying around. For a moment, Catherine is carried away by her recent nightmare. Once she reaches the door, Beatrice suddenly jumps out from beside the door and Catherine was so surprised and almost loses her heartbeat. She was annoyed a bit but glad to see Beatrice is alive and well. Catherine thinks her nightmare is just a dream which she also finds her conclusion is absurd.\n\nCatherine: \"Well, hello, Mrs. Fat Cat…\"\n\nBeatrice: \"Meow! Meow! Meow!\"\n\nShe startles and follows Mike to the main street and sees Diana standing beside Mike and Alice. Diana smiles and says, \"Well, come on princess!\"\n\nCatherine responds to Diana just by smiling, then she takes her mobile phone out of her purse to see if she has received a message from Davis. Catherine walks to Diana's car while checking her mobile phone when Mrs. Abigail suddenly shows up from the side with her walker as she is returning to the apartment. Cathrine and Mrs. Abigail almost bump with each other if Catherine didn’t stop. She was so surprised and screams by accident while her mobile phone almost fell but she manages to grab it back. Catherine felt as if she was just struck by lightning and freezes. Mrs. Abigail didn’t hear Catherine's screams very well because she has a hearing problem but like Catherine, Mrs. Abigail was also caught in surprise.\n\nDiana calls Catherine from the driver's seat, \"Catherine!” and sees Catherine's face looks pale after she met Mrs. Abigail.\n\nFeeling awkward by the incident, Catherine continues walking to Diana’s car. They both look at each other and as always, Mrs. Abigail smiles at Catherine, but at that instant, Catherine can’t smile as she used to, so she keeps walking towards Diana's car without greeting Mrs. Abigail like she always did.\n\nKnowing Catherine seems in a hurry, Mrs. Abigail greets Catherine first.\n\nMrs. Abigail: \"Hello, Catherine. Why are you in a hurry, dear?\"\n\nCatherine stops then turns her body to answer Mrs. Abigail’s question. She says, \" ... Ye-s Mrs. Abigail. We’re taking the kids out ... Well, actually ... and ... I ... I noticed just now your apartment door was not closed properly.\"\n\nMrs. Abigail: \"O really?... Silly me, I probably forgot to close it when I went out.\"\n\nMrs. Abigail stands silent for a while and her eyes are looking at someplace nearby and then she asks Catherine. \"Catherine dear, do you remember if there is an Oaktree on that corner over there?\" Although holding her walker, she tries very hard to raise her left arm and point to a strange-looking Oaktree.\n\n\"What? ... Which tree Mrs. Abigail?\" Asks Catherine.\n\nMrs. Abigail: \"There! That Oaktree. I remember there was never any Oaktree over there. I've been living in this apartment for fifteen years and never see an Oaktree at that corner. Why everyone else is not noticing it?\"\n\n\"Catherine!\" Diana calls Catherine again and this time she waves to her from inside the car hoping she can speed things up on whatever conversation between Catherine and Mrs. Abigail is having.\n\nCatherine also wants the conversation to end right away because she doesn’t feel comfortable talking to Mrs. Abigail just yet. As soon as Catherine hears Diana is calling her, she takes it as an excuse.\n\nCatherine: \"Mrs. Abigail, I am sorry, we are in hurry today. I have to go now. See you later and take care.\"\n\nKnowing Catherine leaving her question unanswered, Mrs. Abigail feels offended. She nods her head and gives a quick smile to Catherine. Then she walks straight to the main building door without saying a word.\n\n## CHAPTER NINE\n\n### Bring it on!\n\n![Sikorsky U-70i Black Hawk (Illustration 11)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eE8orf1OKdbaT3XOvYrkx.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***August 2025, Inside a Sikorsky U-70i Black Hawk heading to the outer part of the First-Ring of the mist.***\n\nAs the day slowly turns to night, the Black Hawk was flying without any light. The pilot uses digital navigation and a thermal vision as they are making the final approach to an open field somewhere near Outpost-One. As the helo begins to descend, it will not land on the ground but it’ll hover at a certain height for the Bravo-One team to jump safely to the ground. The Black Hawk helicopter will airborne again and then closely monitor the Bravo-One team's secure perimeter from a certain altitude as it becomes the eyes and guardian in the sky. The pilot notifies the Bravo-One team to get ready through their communication unit.\n\nPilot: \"Bravo-One, Coast is clear. ETA 60 seconds.\"\n\nBravo-One leader: \"10-4. Watch our six.\"\n\nPilot: \"Roger-Tango, Bravo-One. Safe hunting.\"\n\nKevin, the Bravo-One team leader then nod his head to his unit. He lends his right-hand palm to the rest of the team and the team responded by putting their palms on top of each other.\n\nKevin: 'Live in honor!\"\n\nDanny: \"Fight with honor!\"\n\nStanley: \"Win with honor!\"\n\nJoe: \"Die in honor!\"\n\nThen they simultaneously say, \"NEVER TURN TO MONSTERS!\"\n\nKevin nodded his head again as the Bravo-One team routine ritual is completed and they are ready to conduct the mission.\n\nAs the helo arrived above the designated open field, the roaring sound and wind pressure from the Sikorsky U-70i Black Hawk powerful engine and massive blades scatter the surrounding mist, while dust particles on the ground float rapidly into the air. One by one the Bravo-One team jump safely to the ground and the helo quickly airborne again and the sudden noisy sound inside the misty forest slowly turn to silence.\n\n***17:07, Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the mist***\n\nAfter Officer Davis received the last transmission from Batman-six. Davis knows this time he is not entering a battlefield to do a one-on-one duel with the undead, but an all-out deathmatch against a horde of undead! He starts talking to himself while looking through his sniper scope and got emotional once the memory of Mike and Catherine appears in his mind. He tries to pump out all the courage left in him to face the impossible, “This has to end now. I don't know how you survive baby girl? Hopefully, I will find it out pretty soon … Just don’t you worry little girl, I’ll never leave you alone … Now it’s just going to be you, me, and hundreds of monsters that are chasing you from behind. Come on Davis! Do it for Mikey and Catherine! Hell yea!\n\n## CHAPTER TEN\n\n### Saving little red\n\n![(Illustration 12)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/emcScLxp07oQJaoYAX_zr.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***17:08. Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the misty forest***\n\nDavis is ready to go all hell break lose until a radio call suddenly comes in from Colonel Monk onboard AC-130J Ghostrider. The gunship is in the air not far from Davis’s last recorded coordinate. Batman-six has informed Eagle-One right after his last radio call with Davis.\n\nMonk: \"Batman-five, Batman-five, this is Eagle-One. Respond! Over.\n\nOnce Davis hears Monk's voice—his best friend, he felt so relieved and his morale is boosted. He immediately feels like he has the courage of a lion. Like intuition, Davis instantaneously got the escape plan he needed and has figured out what steps he must immediately do next.\n\nDavis: \"Batman-five to Eagle-One, requesting air support and escort to Outpost-One. Break. Hostile horde approaching 200 meters heading South to the beacon. Break. Turning the beacon on, now. Break. Going hot in less than three minutes. Over.\"\n\nMonk: \"Eagle-One to Batman five. Beacon status confirmed and detected. Break. Mapping the hostile horde area for visual. Break. Hostile horde detected, bearing North at 200 meters heading South to the beacon. Break. Waiting for confirmation to open fire. Over.\"\n\nDavis: “Batman-five to Eagle-One, that’s a 10-4. Break. Wait for my signal for the firing sequence. Over.”\n\nMonk: “Eagle-One to Batman-five, message received and understood. Break. Eagle-One standing by. Over and out.”\n\nJust as Davis finished the radio call, the little girl in a red dress suddenly fell to the ground. She was exhausted. Probably she has been brisk walking for the last two hours or more. Her face looks pale and thirsty. Without help, she’ll faint in less than five minutes and become a feast for the beasts.\n\nDavis too has seen the little girl will eventually turn tired, that is why he doesn't want to lose sight of her or the horde of the undead that keep chasing her. As the mist scatters by the stormy wind that keeps building above the misty forest, the visibility becomes apparent. The little girl and the horde of the undead are now clearly seen through Davis sniper’s scope and have entered Davis's shooting range. The scattering mist is going to be Davis's only advantage, but the storm above the misty forest is building up too fast, so is the wind speed. Davis does not want to lose another minute. As soon as the wind speed becomes stronger, he might encounter precision difficulty to get a direct hit onto the target. Using a suppressor that is mounted on the MRAD sniper rifle, Davis aims at the closest zombies that are too close to the little girl’s position and pose threats to her safety.\n\nThe distance between Davis and the little girl is around one hundred fifty meters away, while the hostile horde—which he identifies are Shamblers\\* but he also sees several Tangos\\* that walk slower than the Shamblers not in a far distance. The closest Shamblers are around forty-five meters away from the little girl’s position. Davis's prime concerns are the Tangos. He knew well that dealing with one Tango using a sniper rifle is not easy. If there are more of them, then Davis will need all the help he can get from Eagle-One armament.\n\nAs Davis aims at one of the three Shamblers that come close to the little girl, a radio call comes in from Bravo-One Team. Davis knows the cavalry has finally arrived!\n\nKevin: “Bravo-one to Batman-five, Bravo-one is on the ground. Break. Oscar-Mike Outpost-One. Break. Bravo-one standing by. Over.”\n\nDavis: “Batman-five to Bravo-one, Roger that Bravo-one. Hot in two minutes. Break. Do not follow the music room, I repeat, do not follow the music room. Break. No question. Break. Hold your position at Outpost-One. Do you copy? Over.”\n\nKevin: \"10-4 Batman-five. Bravo-One, out.”\n\nOnce Kevin has finished talking to Davis through the radio, he looks confused at Danny and asks, \"What the hell did he mean by music room?\"\n\nDanny was just about to ask the same thing, then he quickly looks at Stanley.\n\nStanley says, \"Don't look at me, I don't even know what the hell he is talking about!\"\n\nStanley, Kevin, and Danny look at Joe.\n\nJoe reply, \"Is Davis man...!\"\n\nThe sun is going to set, where the undead will hunt for prey. A little girl dressed in red is desperately needed help on one stormy night. The situation is tense, besides knowing all hell will probably break loose tonight, no one knows exactly what the outcome will be as the uneven battle will soon start to commence...\n\nThe sound of the battle horns of the living and the undead shall echo throughout the First-Ring of the misty forest.\n\n## CHAPTER ELEVEN\n\n### Headshot\n\n![(Illustration 13)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cRkJtGDHQlMmuIyv6Vcg3.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nDavis had just finished giving instructions to the Bravo-One team, then he returns hastily aiming at the three undead who are getting too close to the little girl in a red dress. She is still lying helplessly on the ground out of her exhaustion after being chased by a horde of undead for hours. Davis sees through his sniper scope and chooses an undead who is now only eight meters away from the little girl. Without the slightest hesitation, Davis opens fire. Equip with a suppressor, his sniper rifle made a quick low bass sound that can hardly be heard by the little girl or the noisy horde of the undead.\n\n\"Blaaab!\"\n\nThe bullet from Davis's sniper rifle starts singing and it was a direct hit. The sniper bullet pierces through the Shamblers' skull and it immediately fell to the ground. As the Zulu hit the ground, the little girl was surprised and terrified by the noise. She slowly regains consciousness after several seconds of a spontaneous blackout. Driven by fear and not knowing what happened, the little girl tries to crawl away from the undead corpse that recently kissed the ground several meters away from her. Desperately in need to stand up, she forces to push her body upward using her two weak arms, but her legs are shakier than her arms, and can't withhold her body. She falls again to the ground, just like the undead she tries to avoid.\n\n\"Blaaab...!\"\n\nA second bullet from Davis's sniper just made another direct headshot. The undead falls to the ground and make a sound like a small-size tree trunk hitting the ground.\n\n\"Blaaab...!\"\n\nThe third closest undead that poses a threat to the little girl is now eliminated.\n\nNow, Davis's distance to the little girl is approximately one hundred and forty-five meters away, while the closest horde of undead from the little girl is around forty-five meters away. Instantaneously, Davis's mind plays every possible scenario that may or may not happen if he exposes himself to the horde of the undead and the little girl. He has projected that if he sprints running to the little girl's position with his backpack, weapon, and ghillie suit on the misty forest rough terrain, he'll probably reach his destination in one minute; but he must not stop running until he reaches the little girl and saves her life.\n\nDavis has measured that to sprint run on rough terrain for a maximum of one minute while putting himself in a head-to-head position with a horde of undead is not going to be the smartest decision he makes in this critical rescue mission.\n\nHe also assumes the little girl may not see him as a friendly human rescuer, especially in her state of mind and exhaustion, she'll probably see Davis as a grizzly bear because of the ghillie suit; And if that happens, many unprecedented outcomes will make the situation even more difficult for him to save the helpless and frightening little girl.\n\nLastly, if he runs to the little girl, then he'll break the unproven myth that says whoever runs inside the First-Ring of the mist will not survive.\n\nAlthough Davis seems to has a sound plan to escape after he saves the little girl, but how he executes and begins this rescue mission, it’s all depends on him. He only has 10 more seconds to decide before the horde of undead is coming closer to the helpless little girl who is still lying half-conscious on the ground. He mumbles, “So what’s going to be, Davis?”\n\n## CHAPTER TWELVE\n\n### Blackout\n\n![The briefing room (Illustration 14)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qEnTKOQ1PGVMgDJaF56-8.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***01:30, Dubai, 24 days before Christmas, 2024. Somewhere in UAE and US joint operation military air force base.***\n\nOn the way to the Briefing Room, Davis can't stop thinking about Mike and Catherine. He misses them so much and also understands why both of them are upset with him, but this year he already prepared a big surprise for Mike and Catherine. Davis knows he can't compensate for his absence for not being at home with them all the time; nevertheless, a brand new Tesla car for Catherine and the latest console game which Mike always wanted since last year plus a fifteen days family tour to Europe could, at least, give them a joyful moment on Christmas Eve and New Year. Davis has planned the surprise gifts several months ago. So, on the fifth of December, he will return home and give Mike the new console game, while the brand new car will arrive on the eighth of December. On the same day, he will surprise them again by telling Catherine and Mike to pack their bags and get ready for a two weeks holiday trip to Europe…\n\nDavis enters the Briefing Room. He sees Monk waving at him and calls him to sit next to him. Both teams were also there, Eagle-One and Eagle-Two. The commanding officer who is in charge of the early morning briefing has not yet arrived. Davis sees most faces inside the briefing room are not looking comfortable, he also finds Monk a little bit tense but has not lost his sense of humor.\n\nMonk: \"Bond! Something just came up! It doesn’t look good.\"\n\nMonk sometimes calls Davis with his nickname 'Bond'. It is not a secret military call sign or anything, but it was Davis's nickname that he got from college. The nickname was given to Davis by his friends in the early days of college, where Monk and Davis also met and become best friends. In his college years, Monk and Davis were in one classroom, but they have not known each other yet. One time, the teacher told every student in the classroom to write about what they want to be after college? Each student must read it out loud in front of the class with the hope they'll want to know each other better, become more supportive of one another, finding the same interest, and build common ground.\n\nMonk is a good-looking teenager at the time. His hair is mostly what makes the girls at college have a crush on him. While Davis on the other hand is like the opposite of Monk. Though he is somehow good-looking, sadly, he is sloppy. He wears the same clothes every day and his hair is messy. He wears old sneakers and never likes talking to his classmate. If no one asks him, he rarely talks and is just busy with himself.\n\nAs Davis read out to the whole class that day, he said he wanted to join the military and become a SEAL team. Immediately almost all of his classmates, except Monk, were laughing at him. At the time, his friends see Davis as an untidy person, unorganized and messy. They think Davis's word is similar to “a poor man's voice that doesn't carry very far.”\n\nDavis was not pleased by his classmate's attitude and felt underestimated. Once he returned to his chair, Monk gave him a folded paper—though they barely know each other. Davis opened the paper, it read:\n\n*\"I persevere and thrive on adversity. My Nation expects me to be physically harder and mentally stronger than my enemies. If knocked down, I will get back up, every time. I will draw on every remaining ounce of strength to protect my teammates and to accomplish our mission. I am never out of the fight.*\n\n*I am joining too!*\n\n*Hi! I’m Monk.”*\n\nDavis knew every word in Monk’s letter, and it was a part of the US Military Navy SEAL’s Creed. Since then, their friendship grew until they both ended up becoming spec ops. Davis's friends in college started to give him a nickname, “bond”; not as James Bond, but a short version of the word “vagabond.” Davis never felt insulted by the nickname but instead, he was motivated by it because back then, he never knew the word was meant, ‘vagabond’. After he joined the corps, Monk told him what it was and they both laughed at their college days. He never lets anyone else calls him by that nickname besides Monk. He often calls Monk with the nickname ‘Key’ in return because Monk has a weird-looking tattoo on his back that looks like a key, but he also said to Monk that it can also be a short version of “Monk Key”.\n\n***01:33. Dubai, 24 days before Christmas. The Briefing Room.***\n\nDavis: “What's happening man? The briefing should begin later at 08:00 hours this morning, we haven't even rest yet? I was talking to Catherine and Mike just now....”\n\nMonk slightly raised his hand telling Davis to stop talking because he wants to explain something to him.\n\nMonk: “Our intel source just said that something big is happening around the globe and back home, they say we must be briefed about it immediately.”\n\nDavid: \"What? ... What happened?\"\n\nMonk: \"Not a clue, but we have entered DEFCON 4.\"\n\nAs soon as Davis knew that the whole nation has entered DEFCON 4, he promptly asks Monk.\n\nDavis: \"Have you told Diana?\"\n\nHe turns his face towards Davis and says: \"No, I haven't. The Pentagon says most part of the US has recently fallen into a sudden blackout and civilian cellular systems are having a connection problem.\"\n\nDavis: \"But … I was just talking to Catherine and Mike using video call?\"\n\nMonk: \"Probably that was minutes ago...They say it's still happening now...\"\n\nDavis: \"What?\"\n\nWhen Monk sees Davis becoming tense, he tries to calm his buddy and says, \"Look! I’m worried about Diana and Alice's safety too. The team was also talking about their families just before you came in. We all want to know what is happening back home? So, calm down.\"\n\nDavis's face turns uncomfortable as fear has just stabbed him right at the heart; like Monk and the rest of the military men sitting inside the briefing room.\n\n**(To be continued)**", "timestamp": 1633544642, "digest": "Qvn3QmERug13sfNZdzLd2WgqA32rzZaRe5t1tyuhkhU", "contributor": "0xc1C41e3606bF2756c09c95132F528012be17f724"}

Pero no el de la edición corriente, sino la forrada en tela roja con letras doradas sobreimpresas. Todavía lo conservo. Hace menos de 20 años de eso, pero era, definitivamente, otra era. Al comprarlo todavía no había tenido acceso al contenido, es decir, no había escuchado las canciones pero, como se trataba de Damon Albarn y los suyos y, el diseño resultaba una verdadera joya, me lié la manta a la cabeza e hice mía esa edición limitada. Recuerdo el momento como si fuera ahora mismo. Desprecinté tan maña obra de arte con cuidado, pasé la palma de mi mano y las yemas de mis dedos sobre las texturas que ofrecían el contraste entre la tela rugosa y la tinta, tan agrietada por la sobreimpresión, que parecía oro envejecido del año 0. Entonces, introduje el CD en el reproductor, presioné PLAY y me dije a mí mismo “¡qué mierda es esta!”. Hoy soy capaz de apreciar el disco pero, por aquel entonces, ni yo ni el resto del mundo estábamos preparados para que Blur publicara un tracklist como ese. En ese momento entendí el motivo por el que era sumamente improbable encontrar el álbum para descargar en P2P directo a Winamp. Aunque Think Tank no sea una obra maestra, ha envejecido muy bien pero, simplemente, no gustó a nadie en aquel inicio de década. Compré el disco un poco por la fama y mucho por el packaging.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3a%2f%2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2fpublic%2fimages%2f67ff2864-fbe8-4656-ae81-16a8fb45c024_853x640.jpeg)\n\n¿Cuántos álbumes consiguieron sobrevivir o incluso barrer en las listas gracias a un acertado arte? Que le pregunten, sin por ello menospreciar a su música, a No Doubt o Blink 182. Qué duda cabe del talento artístico de ambas bandas pero, ellas mismas, saben que nada hubiera sido igual sin un concepto visual acertado, porque hubo un tiempo en el que eso importaba. Que se lo pregunten a los Ramones que quedan, quienes, si han sabido gestionar bien su patrimonio, seguramente hayan pasado el confinamiento en una buena mansión ajardinada y pagada a base de camisetas vendidas por Inditex.\n\nEse envite, esa importancia de las artes visuales en la música que, durante los últimos veinte años -salvo casos puntuales- ha sido residual por la mera necesidad de ponerle un traje cualquiera a tu single o álbum, vuelve a ganar enteros gracias al auge de las cadenas de bloques o blockchains y sus NFT como concepto práctico. Música y artes visuales se vuelven a encontrar tras décadas de desamor y es el momento de que músicos y artistas visuales entiendan que, en este futuro que casi aún no ha empezado, deben retro-alimentarse como nunca lo hicieron, ni tan solo entre los dorados años 1970–1999, antes que de grandes grupos empresariales intenten centralizar ciertos conceptos que nacen descentralizados por naturaleza.\n\nLos creadores gráficos que pretendan trabajar en, o para, la industria musical, deberán desenvolverse con soltura. Será obligatorio organizarse y entender bien el juego (que viene con nuevas reglas y productos de toda índole). Mientras tanto, los compositores y otros agentes de la música han de identificar bien a qué se van a enfrentar, sin dejarse cegar por las tres letras que muy a menudo ahora no nos dejan ver el bosque, la N, la F y la T (sobretodo en lo que a subastas de arte se refiere).\n\nLos grandes de este juego, ex-ejecutivos de enormes discográficas y promotoras que, en algunos casos, ahora ocupan sillones en consorcios en torno al mundo de las criptomonedas, se encuentran atentos y tomando buena nota de lo que, mentes brillantes pero carentes de visión estratégica (porque en la vida no se puede tener todo), están desarrollando a pequeña escala con resultados millonarios. Cientos de creadores que intentan y consiguen innovar pero que, al mismo tiempo, no parecen darse cuenta de que sus seguidores reales, no los llamados cripto-millonarios, no tienen ni el poder adquisitivo, ni el interés y, ni mucho menos, el conocimiento tecnológico, de jugar a lo que se les está proponiendo.\n\n![Martin N. Bandier, ex-ejecutivo de Sony/ATV Music Publishing. ¿Estará atento al mundo de las criptomonedas?](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3a%2f%2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2fpublic%2fimages%2fa2c9b600-fca9-47f1-94fd-4c4f48362c74_600x331.jpeg)\n\nEs importante que la industria musical pueda circular a través de cualquier otra plataforma al nivel que, por ejemplo lo hacen las *skins* de los gamers, que podemos usar en el juego, pero que trascienden también hasta Twitch, Youtube o Discords. No bastará con el audio o el vídeo musical de turno. Basta de intentar trasladar hacia nuevos mundos que no tienen nada que ver con el pasado lo que ayer nos daba beneficios (los catastróficos datos y peores resultados del *live stream* durante el último año son escandalosos), porque eso solo ayuda a sostener intereses que no son los del músico, dejando atrás por el camino, a miles de cadáveres de creadores bien intencionados.\n\nUn álbum va a dejar de ser únicamente música envuelta con papel y plástico de colores o representada por una piel estática en JPG, para pasar a ser un ente con vida propia sin más límites que la capacidad creadora-empresarial del artista o conjunto de artistas. En ese sentido, los colectivos artísticos dedicados a la creación musical van a prosperar al mismo nivel y forma que los equipos de eSports en la industria del videojuego, dejando atrás la definición de banda o solista (aunque hablemos de DJs) como una escuadra compuesta por voz, teclados, guitarra, bajo y batería (o cualquier otra formación en tipo o número) para sumar al desarrollador, diseñador, ilustrador, animador, digital planner o data analyst como parte del grupo, en una especie de K-pop band pero con alma.\n\nNo son tan interesantes los números que se mueven ahora en torno a cientos de miles de dólares -millones en algunos casos-, los cuales tienden por naturaleza a desinflarse, como sí los productos que a través de blockchain puedan funcionar y prueben ser útiles para comercializar desde los $10 a los $100 e incluso más allá (pero no mucho más allá). El hype tiende a la desaparición pero la tecnología llega para quedarse.\n\nDejemos claro que los NFT no serán tanto objetos que reemplacen al merchandise tradicional, que también, sino una extensión -en algunos casos vital- del propio proyecto musical (lo que no es una camiseta), así que estamos hablando de un híbrido entre producto o servicio y propuesta artística.\n\n![La banda estadounidense Kings of Leon ha lanzado su disco ‘When You See Yourself’ en formato NFT](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3a%2f%2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2fpublic%2fimages%2ff7148d9c-fd1c-4103-b90e-5dbfe6b98d3a_1600x1349.png)\n\nNo serán por tanto útiles para la compra de la obra de arte (la canción en este caso), como sí sucede en el mundo de las artes visuales con un *artwork*, porque habría que emitir contratos tan restrictivos que torpedearían la propia venta y, para eso, ya contamos con decenas de plataformas que nos venden audios por *tracks*. Excepto si el artista y su entorno está dispuesto a desprenderse de todos los derecho de su obra, como acaba de hacer Dylan con Universal Music. La utilidad principal de los NFTs en música se encuentra en poder paliar el hecho de que, una vez puesta la música en la radio tradicional, Spotify o Youtube, gana en recorrido pero pierde en exclusividad sucediéndole a la mayoría de canciones algo parecido a lo que sucede con un coche, el cual, nada más adquirirlo, ya pierde valor.\n\nPor todo ello el elemento visual es tan sumamente importante en esta nueva era, y es por eso por lo que las asociaciones entre músicos y artistas visuales está siendo tan predominante en estos tiempos, como en los casos de Major Lazer, Snoop Dog, Halsey o Steve Aoki. Nombres gigantes que, como decíamos, andan buscando el camino que, desde su posición, les lleve hasta los productos, adaptados a cada caso en particular dependiendo de su proyecto musical, que respondan a una franja comercial coherente con las posibilidades de cada segmento (entre los $10 y $100 mencionados) y que pueda generar miles de transacciones en lugar de solo unas pocas. Reducir volatilidad y añadir estabilidad para disparar las ganancias y asentar la vía de negocio.\n\nLlega el momento en el que la industria musical debe empezar a aceptar que, aunque el negocio sea la música, vas a tener que conducirlo con la obra del artista visual al volante. Desde la concepción del grupo cuando cuatro amigos se juntan y montan una banda o, desde la soledad del productor solista, la propuesta creativa de estos determinará si el artista visual es un componente más de la banda o no. De no ser así, la formación necesitará externalizar esos servicios y saldrá perdiendo en costes y autenticidad, porque no es lo mismo contratar a Michel Gondry o Es Devlin, a que sean parte de tu banda por lo que ello supone, ya no a nivel presupuestario, sino a nivel de implicación y compromiso creativo (sin dudar por ello de la profesionalidad de ambos).\n\nSin embargo, que nadie espere ofrecer el control del negocio a escenógrafos, ilustradores o animadores. Si bien es cierto que, obviando el cúmulo de años de una carrera musical y limitándonos a imaginar solo el corto periodo de tiempo de un lanzamiento, digamos un proyecto estándar de 2–3 años desde la salida de las canciones hasta empezar a trabajar en el nuevo álbum, donde exista un buen balance de responsabilidades y nada pese más que nada, durante una primera fase, digamos por ejemplo el primer año, es muy probable que los elementos visuales tengan un peso en torno al 66% del proyecto, siendo el resto una disputa estratégica entre el peso de la música y el de la *celebrity* como figura pública. Ese porcentaje irá desinflándose gradualmente hasta finalizar el tercer año en favor de otro tipo de NFTs que cobren valor por lo que son y no por cómo luzcan. Será importante el qué ofrezcan, ya no tanto por estética, sino por estatus y utilidad en busca de la completa fidelización con el fan y un mejor balance entre estrategias, otorgando más y más protagonismo a las composiciones musicales hasta obtener 3 bloques equilibrados: música, *celebrity* y todo tipo de NFTs que no actúen como *merchandise* sino como elementos centrales del proyecto artístico desde su concepción creativa.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3a%2f%2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2fpublic%2fimages%2f347e1b9c-b29a-4ca5-9cad-b2f8b80d9d1c_1200x1200.png)\n\n![No solo bandas con grandes presupuestos se suben al carro de los NFT.

These legitimacy constraints result from a lack of incentive alignment between centralized platforms and their users. Originally, Verse was designed to solve this problem though a multiplayer cryptomedia protocol. In this protocol, token-holding creators and curators would coordinate to build a high-signal feed of information by posting and curating media within a single cryptomedia contract.\n\nThings have changed.\n\nFirst, let’s be clear. The vision for Verse remains the same: **build a multiplayer standard for media**.\n\nWhile the vision is consistent, the plan of attack is different. Originally, here’s how Verse was designed: Through the protocol, anyone could deploy a new cryptomedia contract. Each contract would have an associated token and an array of media posts. Token-holders could add a post to the contract’s collection. Holders could also stake their tokens to different posts in the collection to curate them, thereby signaling the highest-quality posts in the collection. There are a few problems with this system:\n\n### Exhaustive User Experience\n\nThe process of curating posts in a collection required users to stake tokens in posts which they deemed to be the highest-value. The problem is that over time, many posts may no longer be relevant. In this case, the curator would have to manually unstake their tokens from that post to “uncurate” it. We don’t experience this problem in web2 because we have an unlimited number of “likes”. But in a system which relies on the scarcity of tokens and staking to signal the importance of information, we quickly run into the issue of curators constantly needing to manage the state of their staked tokens. At scale, it’s simply exhausting for someone to constantly stake and unstake tokens to curate information in a continuous feed.\n\n### Weak Incentives to Curate\n\nSecond, there was really no built-in incentive for token-holders to actually use their tokens and curate posts. It’s too easy for a [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) problem to emerge, where the majority of participants could just hold tokens passively and extract value from the labor of a few curators who work to increase the token’s value. If there’s a popular feed, what’s stopping me from simply buying tokens and just sitting on them until they increase?\n\n### Timing\n\nPerhaps the greatest factor in rethinking the protocol design is timing. Over the past month, I’ve spent a lot of time asking myself: why have previous attempts at building curation markets and decentralized social markets repeatedly failed? I believe the answer is that the behavior of “staking to curate” is still extremely nascent and the proper infrastructure has not yet been constructed. There’s a lot of friction and initial apathy for people to generate new curation markets and stake-to-curate information on a topic before there’s a critical mass of viewers who are readily consuming that ranked list and rewarding the curators.\n\nIn my opinion, it’s easier to start with translating the existing behavior of “following” someone on an information network to staking tokens in that person. For example, if we first introduce an environment in which users can stake tokens to “follow” people, I think that’s more intuitive and offers better incentives to the first users who are building the information network and producing content on that network.\n\nAfter the staking-to-curate behavior becomes better familiarized among users, then I think the timing will be more ripe for introducing staked curation of specific content. This is how I hope to actually expand the Verse protocol in the long-run. Over time, I want users to be able to curate their top “people” within their network as well as the top “content” that is created within that network. But I believe the order of operations is critical. To use an analogy, I think the “follow” button should be created before the “like” button.\n\n## Back to the Drawing Board\n\nAddressing these flaws required stepping back, examining the problem from a first-principles perspective, and overhauling the approach. We know the problem: **“how can we build signal-legitimized social markets?”**. We also know the defining characteristics of a solution:\n\n1. **User ownership**\n\n   Participants must be intrinsically incentivized to build and maintain a focused network for communication and signaling of specific ideas.\n2. **Multiplayer coordination**\n\n   Participants must have an easy coordination mechanism and tooling to actually be able to build such a network.\n\nTo figure out a protocol design that maximizes these characteristics, I thought about the problem from an alternative angle: cities.\n\nIn many ways, social networks are just internet cities. People interact, build relationships, work (in the context of producing and consuming media), and entertain. The proliferation of crypto is accelerating the convergence, injecting native economies into networks that will cause many people to claim the internet as their primary realm of residence over the physical world. Centralized social networks are also plagued by the same issues as cities. They often have overbearing and far-reaching authorities. They have a lot of noise with sparse pockets of high-signal places to spend your time.\n\nIf I wanted to build the next great metropolitan city in the US, how would I do so? First, I would make sure that **citizens shared in the upside of the city’s growth**. If the first citizens attract more people to immigrate, they should be rewarded, for example, every time someone buys a new home in the city. How do I attract more inhabitants? Currently, if I’m a citizen of NYC, and trying to persuade someone to move here, I’d tell them about all the great people in the city. You have people like Mike Demarais! Like Jarrod Dicker! Like Brian Flynn! I’d also tell them all about the resources they can use. You have Central Park! You can go to SoHo to shop! ***I signal these people and resources to highlight them amidst all the other noise.***\n\n*insert lightbulb going off gif*\n\nBuilding a signal-legitimized network isn’t necessarily about curating the best individual *posts* that appear in a feed. It’s about signaling the most reputable and valuable *people* that participate in the network. The network gains legitimacy not by a centralized algorithm showing you ***what’s*** most popular, but by the *participants themselves provably asserting* ***who*** are the people you should pay attention to. Additionally, signaling people is far more consistent than signaling individual pieces of information. There’s a reason we follow *people* on web2 social networks and not topics: people are more consistent in the quality of information they broadcast to the network.\n\nSo armed with this understanding, how do we design a mechanism in which participants of a network can stake tokens to each other to signal a person’s value to the network? At a high-level, we can think of this behavior as a natural evolution of “following” someone. But now, the action of “following” is no longer binary; it’s a gradient. If you think someone is extremely valuable to the network, you can stake all your network tokens to that person. If you think someone is less important, you stake only a couple of tokens to that person. Actually implementing this mechanism, for several days, proved far easier said than done. But luckily, I found a breakthrough from an unlikely place: Uniswap.\n\n## A Social Uniswap?\n\n[Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/introduction) is a decentralized exchange that enables users to swap tokens held in a pool with the tokens’ supply managed by a constant-product bonding curve. Trading on Uniswap is made possible through the activity of liquidity providers (LPs) who deposit tokens into a pool to facilitate exchanges. In return for providing liquidity, LPs are minted LP tokens. These LP tokens represent a provider’s pro-rata share of the liquidity reserves, and can be burned to redeem an LP’s underlying liquidity as well as transaction fees generated for each trade.\n\n![Uniswap Liquidity Pool Mechanism](https://docs.uniswap.org/assets/images/anatomy-82d82239e5417e36ca9da17d14961434.jpg)\n\n*insert second light bulb going off gif*\n\nWhat if this same mechanism could be used for social markets created through Verse? Each Verse market has an associated token with different token holders. Just as Uniswap pools have liquidity providers, Verse markets can have *signal providers*. Token holders for a market can stake their tokens to other people in the market, effectively signaling that person’s value. In return for providing signal, stakers are rewarded with auxiliary signal provider (SP) tokens. Whenever a new buyer purchases tokens for the market, a transaction fee is generated which goes into a signal provider pool. Signal providers (stakers) can then burn their SP tokens to redeem their pro-rata share of the transaction fees. In this way, token holders are natively incentivized to use their tokens and signal the most reputable people in the market. In doing so, they construct a fully legitimized social graph that serves as infrastructure for high-signal social markets.\n\nSo finally, let’s examine the downstream effects of this mechanism and protocol itself.\n\n1. User ownership\n\n   The token holders of a Verse market are owners of the market itself. Thus, they are incentivized to build and maintain a healthy, long-term network for communication and signaling of valuable ideas.\n2. Multiplayer coordination\n\n   In order to build this network, they are given the ability to use their tokens to stake and signal the most valuable market participants. If a participant is especially valuable to the network, participants can stake a bunch of tokens to this person and push them to the top of any feed built on the network. Conversely, if a participant starts spamming the feed or fills it with noise, participants can unstake their tokens from that person and push them to the bottom of the feed. This system is preferable to the exhaustive experience of staking individual posts, because staking and unstaking people in the network would occur far less frequently, and would be a better overall signal of significant network nodes.\n\nThus, this updated protocol still solves the problem of legitimacy-constrained networks while mitigating the pitfalls in the previous design.\n\nHere’s an example of the mechanisms in action:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/miTpU98A1AUo1UWmMZXiW.png?height=816&width=2432)\n\nAdam buys 100 tokens for the $PIZZA Market, which costs 4 ETH. 4 ETH gets deposited into the bonding curve’s ETH pool. 100 tokens are minted by the bonding curve and transferred to Adam. Additional tokens (representing 5% of Adam’s purchase amount) are minted by the bonding curve and deposited in an internal staking pool. In this case, 5 additional tokens are minted and deposited in this pool.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RTlhRE7CyeC_uknZP0fSw.png?height=816&width=2432)\n\nAdam decides to stake 10 of his tokens to Blake to signal Blake’s importance to the network. The staking pool now contains the original 25 + Adam’s 10 = 35 total tokens \n In return for staking 10 of his tokens, Adam is minted 10 Signal Provider tokens, which represent his pro-rata share of the staking pool.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ArHW_N4ntWN9Vd5pGk8Qv.png?height=816&width=2432)\n\nNow, assume another buyer, Chris, purchases 200 tokens for 50 ETH. The inflationary minting fee from this purchase is 10 tokens. So 10 more tokens are minted and deposited in the staking pool. The total number of tokens in the staking pool is now 45.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jA23Ht6iwj89sa7YeGxGw.png?height=900&width=2432)\n\nNow, Adam decides to burn his 10 Signal Provider tokens that he got from staking in Blake. Since the total number of Signal Provider tokens is 30, his pro-rata share of the staking pool is (10/30) \\* 45 = 15 staking pool tokens. Of these 15 staking pool tokens, 10 of these tokens represent the amount that Adam original staked in Blake. Adam is transferred these 10 tokens. Of the 5 additional tokens that represent the “profit” received from staking, 50% (2.5 tokens) are transferred to Adam, while 50% (2.5 tokens) are transferred to Blake.\n\nFrom this example, we can observe the following incentives and outcomes:\n\n* Every time tokens are purchased via the bonding curve, additional tokens are minted and deposited into the staking pool. Because the price of each token is a function of the token’s total supply, the token is thus slightly inflationary.\n* Thus, for token-holders to maintain the value of their holdings, they are incentivized to stake. Staking is the only way for users to ensure that as new tokens are minted, they receive a proportion of these tokens in order to maintain and/or increase the total value of their holdings.\n* Creators within a market are incentivized to build a strong reputation within a market and get people to stake tokens in them. It’s the web3 equivalent of trying to gain followers. If individuals are able to get other token holders to stake in them, they can be monetarily rewarded for being a high-signal, valuable contributor to a market’s feed.\n* On a network level, all token-holders are incentivized to attract attention to their feed to encourage token-buying events from new buyers or existing holders, as each token-buying event increases the price of each token and also distributes rewards to stakers and stakees.\n\nZooming out, I think it’s important to frame Verse on a network and individual level. On a network level, Verse is designed to solve the problem of legitimacy constraints in centralized media. For individuals, Verse enables you to earn from sharing your thoughts and ideas on the internet. You don’t have to be a full-fledged “creator” and do it alone - you can generate tangible value from creating and curating in a multiplayer context. If NFTs allow people to own digital objects, Verse enables people to own digital ideas, conversations, and stories. In a world rapidly accelerating toward automation and measurement, data is a commodity. Filtered, labeled, and processed data is the most valuable asset. Thus, information processing is the most important force of our reality. It’s critical that this power is decentralized. \n\nFor all those following Verse, I hope this update provides some clarity. The smart contracts are live on Rinkeby and the first app is nearing the finish line. I’m targeting a beta starting next week. More updates soon to come.\n\n\\-Kiran", "timestamp": 1633545542, "digest": "NHeiocJHvZCSx10LDgQO6T4qPVLiLVAM4IWlMnQJqxo", "contributor": "0xe5E4B1EC4061d6fC932207DFc5CF96bD27FB11Da"}

Trading on Uniswap is made possible through the activity of liquidity providers (LPs) who deposit tokens into a pool to facilitate exchanges. In return for providing liquidity, LPs are minted LP tokens. These LP tokens represent a provider’s pro-rata share of the liquidity reserves, and can be burned to redeem an LP’s underlying liquidity as well as transaction fees generated for each trade.\n\n![Uniswap Liquidity Pool Mechanism](https://docs.uniswap.org/assets/images/anatomy-82d82239e5417e36ca9da17d14961434.jpg)\n\n*insert second light bulb going off gif*\n\nWhat if this same mechanism could be used for social markets created through Verse? Each Verse market has an associated token with different token holders. Just as Uniswap pools have liquidity providers, Verse markets can have *signal providers*. Token holders for a market can stake their tokens to other people in the market, effectively signaling that person’s value. In return for providing signal, stakers are rewarded with auxiliary signal provider (SP) tokens. Whenever a new buyer purchases tokens for the market, a transaction fee is generated which goes into a signal provider pool. Signal providers (stakers) can then burn their SP tokens to redeem their pro-rata share of the transaction fees. In this way, token holders are natively incentivized to use their tokens and signal the most reputable people in the market. In doing so, they construct a fully legitimized social graph that serves as infrastructure for high-signal social markets.\n\nSo finally, let’s examine the downstream effects of this mechanism and protocol itself.\n\n1. User ownership\n\n   The token holders of a Verse market are owners of the market itself. Thus, they are incentivized to build and maintain a healthy, long-term network for communication and signaling of valuable ideas.\n2. Multiplayer coordination\n\n   In order to build this network, they are given the ability to use their tokens to stake and signal the most valuable market participants. If a participant is especially valuable to the network, participants can stake a bunch of tokens to this person and push them to the top of any feed built on the network. Conversely, if a participant starts spamming the feed or fills it with noise, participants can unstake their tokens from that person and push them to the bottom of the feed. This system is preferable to the exhaustive experience of staking individual posts, because staking and unstaking people in the network would occur far less frequently, and would be a better overall signal of significant network nodes.\n\nThus, this updated protocol still solves the problem of legitimacy-constrained networks while mitigating the pitfalls in the previous design.\n\nHere’s an example of the mechanisms in action:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/miTpU98A1AUo1UWmMZXiW.png?height=816&width=2432)\n\nAdam buys 100 tokens for the $PIZZA Market, which costs 4 ETH. 4 ETH gets deposited into the bonding curve’s ETH pool. 100 tokens are minted by the bonding curve and transferred to Adam. Additional tokens (representing 5% of Adam’s purchase amount) are minted by the bonding curve and deposited in an internal staking pool. In this case, 5 additional tokens are minted and deposited in this pool.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RTlhRE7CyeC_uknZP0fSw.png?height=816&width=2432)\n\nAdam decides to stake 10 of his tokens to Blake to signal Blake’s importance to the network. The staking pool now contains the original 25 + Adam’s 10 = 35 total tokens\nIn return for staking 10 of his tokens, Adam is minted 10 Signal Provider tokens, which represent his pro-rata share of the staking pool.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ArHW_N4ntWN9Vd5pGk8Qv.png?height=816&width=2432)\n\nNow, assume another buyer, Chris, purchases 200 tokens for 50 ETH. The inflationary minting fee from this purchase is 10 tokens. So 10 more tokens are minted and deposited in the staking pool. The total number of tokens in the staking pool is now 45.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jA23Ht6iwj89sa7YeGxGw.png?height=900&width=2432)\n\nNow, Adam decides to burn his 10 Signal Provider tokens that he got from staking in Blake. Since the total number of Signal Provider tokens is 30, his pro-rata share of the staking pool is (10/30) \\* 45 = 15 staking pool tokens. Of these 15 staking pool tokens, 10 of these tokens represent the amount that Adam original staked in Blake. Adam is transferred these 10 tokens. Of the 5 additional tokens that represent the “profit” received from staking, 50% (2.5 tokens) are transferred to Adam, while 50% (2.5 tokens) are transferred to Blake.\n\nFrom this example, we can observe the following incentives and outcomes:\n\n* Every time tokens are purchased via the bonding curve, additional tokens are minted and deposited into the staking pool. Because the price of each token is a function of the token’s total supply, the token is thus slightly inflationary.\n* Thus, for token-holders to maintain the value of their holdings, they are incentivized to stake. Staking is the only way for users to ensure that as new tokens are minted, they receive a proportion of these tokens in order to maintain and/or increase the total value of their holdings.\n* Creators within a market are incentivized to build a strong reputation within a market and get people to stake tokens in them. It’s the web3 equivalent of trying to gain followers. If individuals are able to get other token holders to stake in them, they can be monetarily rewarded for being a high-signal, valuable contributor to a market’s feed.\n* On a network level, all token-holders are incentivized to attract attention to their feed to encourage token-buying events from new buyers or existing holders, as each token-buying event increases the price of each token and also distributes rewards to stakers and stakees.\n\nZooming out, I think it’s important to frame Verse on a network and individual level. On a network level, Verse is designed to solve the problem of legitimacy constraints in centralized media. For individuals, Verse enables you to earn from sharing your thoughts and ideas on the internet. You don’t have to be a full-fledged “creator” and do it alone - you can generate tangible value from creating and curating in a multiplayer context. If NFTs allow people to own digital objects, Verse enables people to own digital ideas, conversations, and stories. In a world rapidly accelerating toward automation and measurement, data is a commodity. Filtered, labeled, and processed data is the most valuable asset. Thus, information processing is the most important force of our reality. It’s critical that this power is decentralized.\n\nFor all those following Verse, I hope this update provides some clarity. The smart contracts are live on Rinkeby and the first app is nearing the finish line. I’m targeting a beta starting next week. More updates soon to come.\n\n\\-Kiran", "timestamp": 1633547192, "digest": "NHeiocJHvZCSx10LDgQO6T4qPVLiLVAM4IWlMnQJqxo", "contributor": "0xe5E4B1EC4061d6fC932207DFc5CF96bD27FB11Da"}

{"id": "w5xBpokGf6e22q3vxsy91y420fI_wxubHk9Bpwy87CQ", "title": "Pods: The DAOnfall of Token Voting", "body": "*Written by: Maria Gomez ([@MyPaoG](https://twitter.com/MyPaoG)), Julia Rosenberg ([@JulzRoze](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze)), and Chun Poon ([@zkchun](https://twitter.com/zkchun))*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wG451VNrG-9vnf44iRl-R.png?height=500&width=1000)\n\nWhen not fantasizing about the next 1000x moonshot, many crypto-natives dream about how DAOs will transform the way people collaborate. DAOs are imagined as flat and fluid organizations, the opposite of the rigid, pyramid-like structures dominating the corporate world today—an organization where every stakeholder gets to speak their mind and be heard, whether you are a big whale or just a smol ting. It is a noble end-state to pursue, but the reality is that as DAOs grow, they tend to encounter certain pain points (many of which are brought on by their flatness) that hinder their progress.\n\nThis article will briefly look at the scaling problems that DAOs run into today, go over the problem with token voting and offer a high-level introduction to how Orca Protocol will solve this problem.\n\n# What is Governance?\n\nGovernance is simply a tool an organization uses to decide where power should reside and who gets to click on what button. This process places rails around operations, which helps an organization get from point A to point B more smoothly. Processes and rules can be restrictive, but for large organizations, having these processes and rules are essential, if only to prevent implosion before it gets the chance to move from point B to point C. So governance is not only about today, but even more about tomorrow. When a group agrees to move forward as a DAO—whatever that might entail—its members can make choices about the processes and rules that help them do that.\n\nRoughly defined, the ideal governance model is one that maximizes *meaningful* *participation* and the organization’s *efficacy*.\n\n# DAO Extremism\n\nThe point of decentralizing an organization is to remove control from a single entity or group. Decentralization—among other things—creates censorship resistance, a redundancy against corruption, and makes the organization more resilient against technical failures. However, as we will discuss later, some DAOs might appear to operate smoothly, but are not as decentralized as the acronym suggests.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yG9D-cn0oyWABWFwiGNEM.gif?height=202&width=360)\n\nThe unfortunate reality of DAO scaling is that it is very difficult to maintain a high degree of participation. As fewer people are willing to participate in the DAO’s coordination and governance, the higher the risk of centralized power. DAOs could integrate coordination tools, but the tool that works well for a DAO of 50 people might be very counterproductive for a DAO of 50,000 people, and vice versa.\n\nMaintaining high participation rates comes at a cost. It takes time and energy to write and edit improvement proposals, as does stimulating community participation—these are costs that DAO participants must eat in order to uphold participation standards. This cost of participation grows exponentially with the DAO’s size. Consequently, as the number of stakeholders increases, a very decentralized DAO *tends* to lose its ability to stay organized and productive. On the other end of the spectrum, a large *and* orderly DAO *tends* to have centralized governance power under the hood.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yeCyzh9SJi7xuHOKH0Czc.png?height=493&width=972)\n\nOne caveat here is that being chaotic and disorganized is not necessarily a bad thing. Collusion is much harder to pull off, for example. Broadly speaking, however, we can say that:\n\n* **Decentralization** tends to make the organization more chaotic\n* Keeping operations **organized** means compromising on decentralization\n\nSo the first problem that DAOs face, as they scale, is that they seemingly have to make a choice between the two. But what if a DAO does not want to scale? Can it stay at its current size and just use today’s most practiced governance model and expect things to go well? It kind of depends. Most governance models today have a heavy reliance on token [voting.It](http://voting.It) is a coordination signal that gives stakeholders, other than miners and developers, a voice about protocol developments and treasury management. In this sense, token voting is useful and necessary. However, it is not without its problems.\n\n# Token Troubles\n\nAs busy as he is being a [globetrotting legend](https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2vitalik1-min2-1.jpg), Vitalik Buterin still finds time to think about [problems](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) in decentralized governance; specifically, the problems that exist in pure voting-based [models](https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1428473094935662603). He identifies two primary types of issues with token voting.\n\nThe first, that it gives rise to inequalities and incentive misalignment even in the absence of attackers. As mentioned earlier, whales can greatly influence the outcome of a vote, because small bag holders have an insignificant impact on the outcome. And if that is not enough, even if participation rates were 100%, the outcome would only be representative of the wishes of token holders. Token voting is inherently at the expense of the interests of non-token holding stakeholders. This leads to a massive conflict of interest.\n\nThe second issue with token voting is that it can be attacked through various forms of vote buying. This is especially true if the governance token combines voting rights with some kind of economic interest in the protocol’s revenue; it is tempting for small holders to lend out governance tokens as their individual vote will not weigh heavily on the outcome. A malicious actor with lots of capital could pay interest in exchange for borrowing tokens and skew the vote.\n\nIt is important to point out that the problems of token voting can exist in DAOs that are large or small, organized or disorganized. Sole reliance on token-based on-chain governance—as it is practiced today—is not sustainable. Combined with the structural issues that appear when the community does grow, DAOs are in need of better governance and coordination tooling. The ones that exist today, however, are often prescriptive and opinionated frameworks. DAOs that wish to maintain openness, transparency and flexibility are then forced into shaping their organizations to these tools. While it is possible that a set of best practices emerges, each ecosystem is unique and so is its community. Tools should be shaped to the needs of the DAO, so that it can best empower its community members to take ownership of their actions.\n\nSo what is the answer? How can DAOs scale, while keeping the cost of participation low, work around current issues with on-chain governance and stay organized without compromising on decentralization?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DhWEcnvVcZrlqkwdo1dSb.jpg?height=465&width=620)\n\n# The Answer: Pods\n\n**Pods** are Orca Protocol’s answer to the scaling problems that DAOs face. Pods are small working groups, usually centered around one expertise. In place of—or in addition to—one massive, centralized DAO treasury, each pod has its own multi-sig wallet that is controlled by the pod members. So pods can be thought of as mini-DAOs within a larger DAO. By creating a pod around an expertise, certain elements of a DAO can be hardened. This means that it is possible for a DAO to codify specific roles and responsibilities within its ecosystem; we like to call this process *podifying*. Podifying a DAO will turn slow and inefficient, centralized and rigid structures into fast and fluid organizations:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JFb8Yn1MGSvmLbiATPKdc.png?height=493&width=972)\n\nPods are flexible, malleable and modular. They can exist as neighbors, embed or be embedded in other pods, split, merge, etc. Orca Protocol recognizes that DAOs are at the frontier of organizational design. As such, it should be left to a DAO and its users to explore the best options for their vision and needs, rather than imposing predefined organizational shapes. Orca Protocol can, thus, be thought of as a set of **governance primitives**.\n\nIn the image above, the circles represent pods, each with a handful of members and its own multi-sig wallet. The people at the bottom are stakeholders that do not yet have membership to a pod, for example governance token holders or users. To gain membership to a pod, the claimant must meet a set of rules—maybe they have to hold a certain amount of an ERC-20 asset or perhaps they must be voted on to a whitelist of candidates for membership. A future could even exist where membership hinges on a custom reputation system. These restrictions can be almost anything and should be formed around the gravity of the pod’s responsibilities. Membership can also be slashed at any time if the member fails to comply with membership rules. In other words, pods can grow, shrink and extend to the needs of the DAO.\n\n# Member-Based DAO\n\nInstead of the DAO’s governance centering around token-based voting, actions are now governed through pod membership. But these pod memberships will not make governance tokens disappear, nor take away their power; instead, some of its powers are delegated to pods to make governance more efficient and flexible to the needs of the specific protocol in question. The pod members are responsible for making decisions, within the field of their expertise, that add value to the DAO. Once in a pod, these decision making processes only have to be as involved as they need to be. Some decisions can be made through simple verbal agreements, while others may require an approval process.\n\n> Voting happens on the pod level, rather than on a DAO-wide level.\n\nBy delegating some execution power to key decision makers, the cost of participation drops significantly. Issues that token holders are not interested in, should not require the attention of token holders and can be hidden from their day-to-day. This allows the DAO to make decisions more efficiently without compromising on transparency or openness. The pod model also provides a canvas for talent to naturally surface to the relevant parts of the DAO.\n\nAll of this stays true, regardless of the size of the DAO. A DAO of one pod can easily add another pod when it becomes large enough, and it can continue to add pods as it grows.

DAOs are imagined as flat and fluid organizations, the opposite of the rigid, pyramid-like structures dominating the corporate world today—an organization where every stakeholder gets to speak their mind and be heard, whether you are a big whale or just a smol ting. It is a noble end-state to pursue, but the reality is that as DAOs grow, they tend to encounter certain pain points (many of which are brought on by their flatness) that hinder their progress.\n\nThis article will briefly look at the scaling problems that DAOs run into today, go over the problem with token voting and offer a high-level introduction to how Orca Protocol will solve this problem.\n\n# What is Governance?\n\nGovernance is simply a tool an organization uses to decide where power should reside and who gets to click on what button. This process places rails around operations, which helps an organization get from point A to point B more smoothly. Processes and rules can be restrictive, but for large organizations, having these processes and rules are essential, if only to prevent implosion before it gets the chance to move from point B to point C. So governance is not only about today, but even more about tomorrow. When a group agrees to move forward as a DAO—whatever that might entail—its members can make choices about the processes and rules that help them do that.\n\nRoughly defined, the ideal governance model is one that maximizes *meaningful* *participation* and the organization’s *efficacy*.\n\n# DAO Extremism\n\nThe point of decentralizing an organization is to remove control from a single entity or group. Decentralization—among other things—creates censorship resistance, a redundancy against corruption, and makes the organization more resilient against technical failures. However, as we will discuss later, some DAOs might appear to operate smoothly, but are not as decentralized as the acronym suggests.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yG9D-cn0oyWABWFwiGNEM.gif?height=202&width=360)\n\nThe unfortunate reality of DAO scaling is that it is very difficult to maintain a high degree of participation. As fewer people are willing to participate in the DAO’s coordination and governance, the higher the risk of centralized power. DAOs could integrate coordination tools, but the tool that works well for a DAO of 50 people might be very counterproductive for a DAO of 50,000 people, and vice versa.\n\nMaintaining high participation rates comes at a cost. It takes time and energy to write and edit improvement proposals, as does stimulating community participation—these are costs that DAO participants must eat in order to uphold participation standards. This cost of participation grows exponentially with the DAO’s size. Consequently, as the number of stakeholders increases, a very decentralized DAO *tends* to lose its ability to stay organized and productive. On the other end of the spectrum, a large *and* orderly DAO *tends* to have centralized governance power under the hood.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yeCyzh9SJi7xuHOKH0Czc.png?height=493&width=972)\n\nOne caveat here is that being chaotic and disorganized is not necessarily a bad thing. Collusion is much harder to pull off, for example. Broadly speaking, however, we can say that:\n\n* **Decentralization** tends to make the organization more chaotic\n* Keeping operations **organized** means compromising on decentralization\n\nSo the first problem that DAOs face, as they scale, is that they seemingly have to make a choice between the two. But what if a DAO does not want to scale? Can it stay at its current size and just use today’s most practiced governance model and expect things to go well? It kind of depends. Most governance models today have a heavy reliance on token [voting.It](http://voting.It) is a coordination signal that gives stakeholders, other than miners and developers, a voice about protocol developments and treasury management. In this sense, token voting is useful and necessary. However, it is not without its problems.\n\n# Token Troubles\n\nAs busy as he is being a [globetrotting legend](https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2vitalik1-min2-1.jpg), Vitalik Buterin still finds time to think about [problems](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) in decentralized governance; specifically, the problems that exist in pure voting-based [models](https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1428473094935662603). He identifies two primary types of issues with token voting.\n\nThe first, that it gives rise to inequalities and incentive misalignment even in the absence of attackers. As mentioned earlier, whales can greatly influence the outcome of a vote, because small bag holders have an insignificant impact on the outcome. And if that is not enough, even if participation rates were 100%, the outcome would only be representative of the wishes of token holders. Token voting is inherently at the expense of the interests of non-token holding stakeholders. This leads to a massive conflict of interest.\n\nThe second issue with token voting is that it can be attacked through various forms of vote buying. This is especially true if the governance token combines voting rights with some kind of economic interest in the protocol’s revenue; it is tempting for small holders to lend out governance tokens as their individual vote will not weigh heavily on the outcome. A malicious actor with lots of capital could pay interest in exchange for borrowing tokens and skew the vote.\n\nIt is important to point out that the problems of token voting can exist in DAOs that are large or small, organized or disorganized. Sole reliance on token-based on-chain governance—as it is practiced today—is not sustainable. Combined with the structural issues that appear when the community does grow, DAOs are in need of better governance and coordination tooling. The ones that exist today, however, are often prescriptive and opinionated frameworks. DAOs that wish to maintain openness, transparency and flexibility are then forced into shaping their organizations to these tools. While it is possible that a set of best practices emerges, each ecosystem is unique and so is its community. Tools should be shaped to the needs of the DAO, so that it can best empower its community members to take ownership of their actions.\n\nSo what is the answer? How can DAOs scale, while keeping the cost of participation low, work around current issues with on-chain governance and stay organized without compromising on decentralization?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DhWEcnvVcZrlqkwdo1dSb.jpg?height=465&width=620)\n\n# The Answer: Pods\n\n**Pods** are Orca Protocol’s answer to the scaling problems that DAOs face. Pods are small working groups, usually centered around one expertise. In place of—or in addition to—one massive, centralized DAO treasury, each pod has its own multi-sig wallet that is controlled by the pod members. So pods can be thought of as mini-DAOs within a larger DAO. By creating a pod around an expertise, certain elements of a DAO can be hardened. This means that it is possible for a DAO to codify specific roles and responsibilities within its ecosystem; we like to call this process *podifying*. Podifying a DAO will turn slow and inefficient, centralized and rigid structures into fast and fluid organizations:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JFb8Yn1MGSvmLbiATPKdc.png?height=493&width=972)\n\nPods are flexible, malleable and modular. They can exist as neighbors, embed or be embedded in other pods, split, merge, etc. Orca Protocol recognizes that DAOs are at the frontier of organizational design. As such, it should be left to a DAO and its users to explore the best options for their vision and needs, rather than imposing predefined organizational shapes. Orca Protocol can, thus, be thought of as a set of **governance primitives**.\n\nIn the image above, the circles represent pods, each with a handful of members and its own multi-sig wallet. The people at the bottom are stakeholders that do not yet have membership to a pod, for example governance token holders or users. To gain membership to a pod, the claimant must meet a set of rules—maybe they have to hold a certain amount of an ERC-20 asset or perhaps they must be voted on to a whitelist of candidates for membership. A future could even exist where membership hinges on a custom reputation system. These restrictions can be almost anything and should be formed around the gravity of the pod’s responsibilities. Membership can also be slashed at any time if the member fails to comply with membership rules. In other words, pods can grow, shrink and extend to the needs of the DAO.\n\n# Member-Based DAO\n\nInstead of the DAO’s governance centering around token-based voting, actions are now governed through pod membership. But these pod memberships will not make governance tokens disappear, nor take away their power; instead, some of its powers are delegated to pods to make governance more efficient and flexible to the needs of the specific protocol in question. The pod members are responsible for making decisions, within the field of their expertise, that add value to the DAO. Once in a pod, these decision making processes only have to be as involved as they need to be. Some decisions can be made through simple verbal agreements, while others may require an approval process.\n\n> Voting happens on the pod level, rather than on a DAO-wide level.\n\nBy delegating some execution power to key decision makers, the cost of participation drops significantly. Issues that token holders are not interested in, should not require the attention of token holders and can be hidden from their day-to-day. This allows the DAO to make decisions more efficiently without compromising on transparency or openness. The pod model also provides a canvas for talent to naturally surface to the relevant parts of the DAO.\n\nAll of this stays true, regardless of the size of the DAO. A DAO of one pod can easily add another pod when it becomes large enough, and it can continue to add pods as it grows. Any hierarchies that form in this process are localized, deliberate and impermanent. The DAO just grows organically from day one.\n\n# Close\n\nOrca Protocol is proudly building tools for DAOs.

{"id": "O_7CphSbknmliBIppXEcsZ1h8qYoU-Vp86T77LejScg", "title": "Influencer Marketing in The Crypto & Blockchain Industry", "body": "The Creator Economy is growing, but how does that reflect on crypto and its communities?\n\nI recently created an assessment for a Blockchain-focused company about influencer & community marketing in the crypto world, and decided to publish it for everyone to learn.\n\n# Objectives, Initiatives & Goals\n\nThe objective of both influencer & community marketing for most crypto companies is to educate people about the new internet, and create awareness about Blockchain technology and the decentralized web.\n\nFor influencer marketing, this would be done by hand-picking and working with digital creators and influencers to really tell an authentic story, and eventually develop a relationship with these digital creators with the ultimate goal of tapping into the growth market (i.e. young people, Zoomers) and creating mass adoption into the decentralized web.\n\nFor Community Marketing, the objective is to create awareness and brand visibility for the abundance of emerging crypto companies that can be quite confusing for the average user. We achieve that through interacting with the diverse crypto community through both proactive and reactive engagement and being on top of emerging trends in the crypto world and social media, for the ultimate goal of strategically developing a reputation for these brands in the crypto world.\n\nThis article will only cover influencer marketing in the crypto world, but I will publish the Community Marketing part in the coming days.\n\n# The Creator Economy & Crypto\n\nThe good news is that it’s a great time to work with creators, especially when we are targeting a niche audience. As of this year, according to [Josh Constine](https://twitter.com/JoshConstine?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) from SignalFire, there are [more than 50 million creators worldwide](https://signalfire.com/blog/creator-economy/) across thousands of topics and verticals, making it easier for brands in the crypto space to find an influencer to work with. Companies can now find a spokesperson for almost any topic and, in our case, we can find people who speak to early crypto adopters, NFT artists/buyers, or really anyone who’s interested in learning more about crypto.\n\nThese creators are mostly young, thus making them both logistically and financially efficient. They are motivated to monetize their talent and effectively work with brands.\n\nInfluencers & Creators are incentivized to migrate into the decentralized web to own their content and interact directly with their fans.\n\nWhat I personally find interesting is how decentralization and the Creator Economy very much go hand-in-hand. Because these creators are selling everything: pain, art, ideas and they don’t know they’re not getting paid enough due to over-reliance on tech giants like Instagram & TikTok. So it’s safe to say that eventually, creators will want to establish a decentralized presence, own their own content, and engage with their fans directly.\n\n# Influencer Marketing Program 101\n\nThe general process to develop an influencer marketing program\n\nTo those of you who are unfamiliar with how brands establish an influencer marketing program, I’ve broken down the basics and used examples for the sake of this discussion. Below is a sample of what a crypto/blockchain company would do to create an influencer marketing program.\n\nThe process of launching an influencer marketing program for any company, not necessarily a crypto company, is divided into 3 parts: Sourcing, Execution, and Reporting.\n\n**Find**\n\nThe first part of sourcing is to find creators, and we have 2 options to approach this, each with their pros and cons: we can either work with an agency and build a crypto influencer roster. The pros here are that it’s faster and easier; we tell the agency what we are looking for, and they find it for us. The con is that it can be more costly than our second option, which is to research in-house and deal with creators directly, which can be quite time consuming especially for someone who doesn’t have the necessary skills to do deal with influencers.\n\n**Benchmark**\n\nOnce we select influencers we want to work with, we filter them more by asking about their audience, their demographics, story views/link clicks, conversion rates, reach; and any other metrics that fits the campaign.\n\nIn the influencer landscape, numbers can be deceiving. I wouldn’t just look for 1 single metric but rather a collective review of the influencer. That’s not to say that followers don’t mean anything, they do. I like to look at follower count like the SATs; it’s not everything, but it definitely is something.\n\nWith the content ideas we have in mind, we discuss rates as well as the guaranteed amount of reach/views/engagement.\n\nOne important part before moving forward is doing a run-through of their socials, see if there’s anything sketchy, or doesn’t align with our brand or values.\n\n**Test**\n\nAn optional step to take is to test them out.\n\nBefore on-boarding them into our influencer marketing program, I would use them for maybe 1 or 2 campaigns. No commitment necessary.\n\nIf the results are satisfactory, I would then discuss a broader partnership and include them in our influencer program.\n\nOnce they check all of the boxes, we pass them onto the second part of the process: Execution.\n\n# Execution\n\nI went ahead and pre-selected the influencers that we’ve “on-boarded” into our program for the sake of this article:\n\nA sample of crypto influencers across various platforms and diverse audiences (*metrics as of May 18th, 2021*).\n\nFirst we have [Lea Thompson](https://twitter.com/girlgone_crypto), AKA “Girl Gone Crypto”, you can see that she’s active on multiple mainstream platforms.\n\nNext, we have [Mack Lorden](https://www.tiktok.com/@macklorden?lang=en), who clearly isn’t as ‘famous’, but he utilizes Discord to interact with his fans. A key platform in the crypto space.\n\nFinally, we decided to go with [Maren Altman](https://twitter.com/marenaltman), an astrologist and crypto enthusiast. Maren is an interesting option because she’s able to encapsulate what Lea and Mack have. She has over 1M followers on TikTok and her content is relatable to both crypto early adopters and normies.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of each influencer’s strengths and what sets them apart:\n\nThe reason I chose to move forward with Lea is because she’s able to decipher crypto jargon and translate that into digestible content for people who aren’t very familiar with the crypto world. She recently partnered with a Blockchain company to explain the decentralized web and the use of Blockchain domains. [Here’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBi9mFSWoOs) a video of her talking about Web3 and the Opera browser partnership with [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/).\n\nGiven her target audience, she’s able to deliver messaging that resonates with the average person. Inviting, relatable, uses simple language and avoids crypto jargon.\n\nUnlike Lea, Mack arguably has a niche audience. So instead of trying to create digestible content for the average user, it’s fair game for him to use crypto jargon because his audience is assumed to be already familiar with crypto concepts. So Mack can casually tweet or talk about Pancake Swap, staking or yield farming without confusing his audience. Lea, however, is more filtered. His content revolves around on-trend crypto news and keeping his audience engaged and up-to-date with the world of crypto. I encourage you all to check out his [TikTok.](https://www.tiktok.com/@macklorden?lang=en)\n\nFinally, Maren is an unusual influencer because, as mentioned earlier, she is an astrologist and if you’ve ever browsed TikTok you would know that astrology is a huge topic that resonates a lot with young people, especially Zoomers. She talks about astrology on a daily basis and links the moon and stars with the price of Bitcoin. I personally don’t believe in it, but nonetheless it’s clear from the followers amassed that she’s tapping to a unique audience.\n\nAlso, yes, she *did* predict the recent Bitcoin crash. Well, kind of. Here’s her tweet on the day of the crash for reference:\n\n# Podcasts + Crypto + Celebs\n\nBefore I move forward to Reporting, I can’t stress enough how valuable it is to have a Podcast in the crypto space and how many opportunities it can create. A potential idea would be to utilize the podcast by hosting an A-list celebrity, specifically one who is already in the crypto space.\n\nParis Hilton or Lindsay Lohan would be good examples given their relatively early adoption of NFTs. I understand how unattainable A-list celebrities can be, but the crypto space is so novel to a lot of people (celebs included) that they would be more open to establishing a media presence in. If I had a crypto podcast I would DM Paris Hilton, Emily Ratajkowski, and Kris Jenner. Yes, Kris Jenner.\n\nIt can even be one of the influencers that we work with, because when we have someone who is comedic or popular then their episode can be used for marketing purposes. Podcast snippets are common on TikTok and are effective in generating engagement and brand visibility.\n\n# Reporting\n\nThe reporting phase of our influencer program consists of post-campaign reporting, developing a cost-benefit analysis, and upgrading our influencer roster with creator-focused software\n\nIn essence, the questions we want to answer are:\n\nDid we achieve our goals?”\n\nHow did the influencer perform relative to their average metrics?”\n\nWhat was the level of engagement and how many followers did we get over the course of the campaigns?\n\nEssentially, we want to know what worked and what didn’t to decide whether we want to continue working with these influencers or not.\n\nA final step, and this is completely optional, would be to utilize creator-focused tools — my personal favorite is [CreatorIQ](https://creatoriq.com/?creative=352297214851&keyword=creatoriq&matchtype=e&network=g&device=c&gclid=CjwKCAjw_JuGBhBkEiwA1xmbRR2wbwbpsXF_TD8Mtjcpjbpkd_cYaurYpL8SumQRtge9NJTjpZROFhoCoL4QAvD_BwE) (I am a little biased since I did data analytics for them last summer, but the CIQ software or any other creator-focused software really would provide more precise ROI measurement as well as future influencer campaign-based tracking.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe influencer landscape in the crypto world is different because simply not a lot of people understand crypto. I wonder when (not *if)* we reach a place where all the beauty & fashion bloggers on Instagram adopt crypto and utilize the decentralized web. It’s difficult to say when this will happen since most of these creators are drinking the Instagram Creator Kool-Aid, and have been for quite some time.\n\nI’m not an engineer or a computer scientist and while crypto and Blockchain can be difficult to grasp and very confusing to follow up with, it is an exciting space and there’s a philosophical aspect behind advocating for a free internet. You can call Crypto anything, but you can’t call it boring.", "timestamp": 1633548517, "digest": "Ig3wNQBtGrh2mBn-oZzU3DBIIzcXRvepJ5FuuvkptJY", "contributor": "0x6958c9FCa424c0B74A42A54AF7877531D6C4F85e"}

{"id": "M0inGr8pBqs4cjSY4tHCqQn7cDNVmTOw8Iy7ObMqqUI", "title": "Effective Learning with Tutorials - Web3 Version", "body": "Earlier this year I wrote about effective learning with tutorials. You can view that here:\n\n[https://community.codenewbie.org/rahat/effective-learning-with-tutorials-2ji8](https://community.codenewbie.org/rahat/effective-learning-with-tutorials-2ji8)\n\nNow I wanted to map out a way to use tutorials and other resources to help folks interested in learning about Web3 and the Crypto space. A lot of this is what I've been doing and different resources I've been using so far will be mentioned below!\n\nFirst off it's important to learn the fundamentals of Solidity. If you're coming from JavaScript this is going to be a little easier as Solidity shares a lot of similarities in syntax with JavaScript. I felt at home pretty quickly thanks to the similar syntax! My favorite resource for going over the fundamentals is Crypto Zombies!\n\n[https://cryptozombies.io/](https://cryptozombies.io/)\n\nThis is a fun and interactive way to learn Solidity by building a Zombie production factory. You're given examples of what you need to accomplish and then you use the in browser IDE to solve specific challenges which may include writing contracts, functions, interacting with other existing contracts and more.\n\nA great way to solidify your Solidity (heh) is to reuse that code and build something else. You can do something as simple as changing the variables to represent giant killer robots instead of zombies. This will still force you to go through the code and understand which variables and what parts of the code do certain things and help dive deeper into it. If you're into video based learning I've started doing some bite sized solidity fundamentals on this new free course I'm slowly building and releasing:\n\n[https://www.30secondsolidity.com/](https://www.30secondsolidity.com/)\n\nOnce you've learned a little about Solidity I highly recommend checking out the smart contract course at Buildspace!\n\n[https://buildspace.so/](https://buildspace.so/)\n\nI took the free course which is a mix of live sessions and text based learning and was able to get my first Dapp deployed on a testnet!\n\nCheck out more of what I learned from there on this post:\n\n[https://dev.to/rahat/real-time-react-fun-on-the-blockchain-27jg](https://dev.to/rahat/real-time-react-fun-on-the-blockchain-27jg)\n\nSimilar to what I mentioned with crypto zombies I changed up the project to be something I enjoy. Instead of the project being built in the course I took what I learned and built a pokemon battle simulation. This again forced me to really go through the code and understand what was going on.\n\nI then branched off and dived into Real time interactions with React and the Blockchain which was not part of the class. It's awesome to take what you learn somewhere and add new things to it like the real time functionality in this case. Build on top of your tutorials and add new features to them to really explore new things!\n\nThere are more intermediate resources once you have gotten these things down that I'm currently using and will be sharing more of in a follow up post. Would love to see what you all are working on with Solidity!

It's what allows us to see some amazing interactions happen in our web applications.\n\nIt's fun to listen for clicks and whenever we press a key but it's even more fun when we can listen for events that happen somewhere else completely. This allows us to create real time applications and if you're building on the blockchain it can be done with just a few lines of code!\n\nThe code we're going to be discussing below was built while I was taking a course all about building Smart Contracts at [BuildSpace](https://buildspace.so/). If you're interested in really diving into the things I'm going to discuss I highly recommend checking out their courses which are all cohort based and free!\n\nThe Project I built here was a little concept Pokemon Battle Simulator where anyone can jump in and have a Pokemon perform an action in battle against another. Almost like a crowd sourced Pokemon battle on the blockchain. A quick demo of it can be found [on this tweet](https://twitter.com/Rahatcodes/status/1430739844100198402).\n\nLet's start by taking a look at some Solidity code. Solidity is a language you can use to build Smart Contracts which is code that helps you interact with the Ethereum Blockchain. Here's some code from a smart contract I've written below:\\\\\n\n```\nevent NewAction(\n        address indexed from,\n        uint256 timestamp,\n        string message,\n        uint256 lugiahp,\n        uint256 zardhp\n    );\n\n    struct Action {\n        address trainer;\n        string message;\n        uint256 timestamp;\n        uint256 lugiahp;\n        uint256 zardhp;\n    }\n\n    Action[] actions;\n```\n\nThis isn't the full smart contract but we're just going to be focused on the parts that enable us to have real time interactions with the block chain. Now remember how I was talking about events at the start of this post? With Solidity you can actually create events to listen for. In this case I am listening for an event that I have named NewAction. That is going to be whenever and Action struct is added to the actions Array.\n\nIf you're coming from JavaScript you can think of this as an actions object being added to an array of actions. Now let's take a look at a function from my smart contract:\\\\\n\n```\n function attack(string memory _message) public {\n        totalDamage += charizardAttack;\n        totalHp -= charizardAttack;\n        charizardDamage += lugiaAttack;\n        charizardHp -= lugiaAttack;\n        console.log(\"%s has attacked the shadow Lugia!\", msg.sender);\n        console.log(\"%s was attacked back by shadow Lugia!\", msg.sender);\n        actions.push(\n            Action(msg.sender, _message, block.timestamp, totalHp, charizardHp)\n        );\n        emit NewAction(\n            msg.sender,\n            block.timestamp,\n            _message,\n            totalHp,\n            charizardHp\n        );\n    }\n```\n\nThis function is taking care of an attack sequence between Charizard and Lugia with both dealing some damage to each other. At the end of the function you will notice I have this\\\\\n\n```\nemit NewAction(\n            msg.sender,\n            block.timestamp,\n            _message,\n            totalHp,\n            charizardHp\n        );\n```\n\nRemember I created the NewAction event earlier? Calling emit is what allows me to say ok this event is now taking place and a new action struct is being created with the information passed in and added to the array of actions.\n\nThat's all we need on the Solidity side of things to make sure an event is there to be listened for but how do we actually listen for this on the front end?\n\nDuring the time I spent building this, our awesome instructor [Farza](https://twitter.com/FarzaTV) introduced us to using [ethers js](https://docs.ethers.io/) with React to interact with the blockchain. One of the awesome things about this course that I really enjoyed is that there are some bonus concepts like events that he introduces and lets us explore for ourselves.\n\nSo while searching google and hunting through some documentation I was able to discover the code needed to listen for this event on the frontend. Check out this useEffect hook below from one of my components:\\\\\n\n```\n\n  const listener = (block) => {\n    console.log(\"new action emited\")\n    console.log(block)\n    getAllActions()\n  }\n\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    lugiaBattleContract.on(\"NewAction\", listener)\n    return () => {\n    lugiaBattleContract.off(\"NewAction\", listener)\n    }\n  },[])\n```\n\nA little context: the getAllActions function is getting the data from the actions Array in my smart contract, sanitizing it a bit, then updating some state with that data. In my useEffect hook I am using some functionality given to us by ethers js in order to listen for an event named \"NewAction\" which if you recall I defined in my smart contract. Now anytime anyone performs an attack - everyone else will also know because the action will be updated for everyone in real time!\n\nA quick note: always make sure that if you're using some type of listener function in React - put it in a useEffect and return a function for cleaning it up. Otherwise you'll end up like me trying to debug why your component is re-rendering several hundred times when the event only happens once.\n\nHere is a quick demo below of this in action:\n\n![charziard attacks lugia demo](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bPBLCx2y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pvthxwt5hanlu4r5ou14.gif)\n\nIt's a large gif 😬 so once it loads you'll see that Charizard is attacking in one browser but the actions logs update in both browsers!\n\nI've done some real time stuff before and this is just amazing to see that I can do this so easily on the Ethereum blockchain!\n\nIf you would like to play with the demo yourself [you can do so here.](https://focused-yonath-5cdafd.netlify.app/)\n\nYou will need to have the metamask chrome extension set up and you'll need some test ETH on the Rinkeby Test Network.\n\nI've been on a journey to learn web3 for a while now in hopes of getting into the space eventually as a developer advocate. If you want to join me on this journey give me a follow on twitter!\n\n[https://twitter.com/Rahatcodes](https://twitter.com/Rahatcodes)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633549597, "digest": "6Ier9H0Hasdt_bujYtHySlOiLD5YKz4pom3mhvu81nQ", "contributor": "0x322Af0da66D00be980C7aa006377FCaaEee3BDFD"}

Scaling Ethereum at first glance seemed almost impossible! High gas prices start being an issue when the network is getting busier since many are hoping to outbid others when sending transactions.\n\nSome awesome tools like Polygon which is a framework for creating blockchain solutions that is compatible with Ethereum have brought in some great fast, low cost transactions into the space making it easier to scale. This type of solution is called a sidechain. These solutions are awesome but let’s take a look at other new ways for scaling data on Ethereum.\n\nThere is an Ethereum 2.0, also known as Serenity which is being worked on which is meant to be more scalable, sustainable, and secure. This upgrade cuts down on the large amounts of computing power and energy needed. Estimates show that Ethereum will use [99% less power](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/) on Serenity. This is amazing, it will cost less, be quicker, more secure and scalable but the thing is, the work to get this up and running won’t be done until later in 2022. In the meantime however, according to Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin ETH2 scaling for data will be available [much sooner](https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-pushes-for-rollups-as-ethereum-s-scaling-sol-6996.htm).\n\nThis scaling comes in the form of what are called ZK-rollup or Optimistic Rollup. Let’s dive into ZK-Rollups for this post.\n\nThe Ethereum Mainnet as we know it can also be referred to as Layer 1 while these Rollups are part of Layer 2 solutions. Layer 2 is there to help handle transactions off of the Ethereum main net and solutions like Rollups and Sidechains like Polygon help with this.\n\nWhy is this needed? I saw a perfectly good reason why when building out [this little application](https://twitter.com/Rahatcodes/status/1430739844100198402) while I was learning about interacting with smart contracts with React. In the video things are sped up but there is a lot of time between me performing an action and seeing that action actually take place due to the mining necessary for the transaction to complete.\n\nImagine playing a game and every action you take that affects data on the blockchain needs to be mined. It wouldn’t really be a fun game would it? On top of that it can just get very expensive to take these different actions.\n\nRollups like I mentioned before execute transactions outside of layer 1 but they post their actual data onto layer 1. This way Rollups are still secured by the Ethereum chain and inherits all of its security properties.\n\nThe ZK rollup is a smart contract that maintains the state of all transfers on layer 2. This is done by following a security model known as Validity proof. In order to increase speed the transactions are rolled up into batches and submitted to Ethereum in a single transaction. The computation is done off-chain and the results are supplied to the main chain with a proof of their validity. This maintains security while letting more transactions happen in a shorter amount of time.Interested in testing some of this out? Here are some implementations of ZK-Rollups that you can build with:\n\n[zkSync](https://zksync.io/)\n\n[Aztek](https://aztec.network/)\n\n[Loopring](https://loopring.org/)\n\nI’m going to start exploring some of these and would love to know if you are as well!

{"id": "eCmUz_do32pQuP7zaeyokoT-PwCJJSY6vF8Nz-U1esU", "title": "Black People are not considered Human. Afropessimism Series Part one", "body": "This is the first of several posts giving an introduction to an idea called Afropessimism. This theory has apparently been all the rage for a few years now in academic circles. I have mainly engaged with the Afropessimism through its most famous or infamous advocate, a writer called Frank B Wilderson III. He’s written a memoir called Afropessimism, and has also been hitting the podcast and interview circuit heavily this year, 2020. In my series, I’ll be making lots of references to these, as well as other articles. I’ll always give references with hyperlinks in the description and blog posts to allow you to follow up.\n\nWillderson uses a lot of dense philosophical, academic terms and concepts which are not easy to get, for me at least. But what I’ll do is pull out some of the things that have jumped out at me about Afropessimism. I’ll say now that while not all of the ideas make sense to me or fully resonate, I think Afropessimism is a very important body of ideas for Black radicals, Panafricanists, etc. I hope that these videos will help to introduce Afropessimism to Black folks outside of academia. Ultimately, I want these posts be a resource for Black people to apply in our own lives with the aim of furthering the quest for genuine Black liberation.\n\n**So, what is Afropessimism in a nutshell?**\n\nI see Afropessimism as an effort to understand why other people treat Black people the way they do. It looks at the Arab and European enslavement of Africans and the gratuitous violence this involved. It looks at how this slavery and violence has morphed into a relentless, deep-seated Anti-Blackness which has psychic and political dimensions. They do all of this and much more and come to some conclusions that in my opinion are militantly Black-centred and revolutionary.\n\n**Black people versus Humans**\n\nAt the heart of Afropessimism is the claim that, unconsciously and consciously – non-Black people do not consider us to be human. This will not be news to anyone who has studied the rise of the European project of modernity. One of the originators of the very idea of distinct human races was a Swedish intellectual called Carl Linneas who is referred to as the father of taxonomy – the classification of things in nature. A website called Linnean.org has a very good discussion called “Linneas and Race” which outlines how he classified humans. As the article explains:\n\n*“Linnaeus’ work on the classification of man forms one of the 18th-century roots of modern scientific racism.” He groups men into four kinds,  Asiaticus, Europaeus, Americanus and Africanus. Though the order changed over the various updates to his schema, “Africanus consistently remained at the bottom of the list. Moreover, in all editions, Linnaeus’ description of Africanus was the longest, most detailed and physical, and also the most negative.” He refers to them, as lazy, Sly, sluggish, neglectful and capricious.”* [https://www.linnean.org/learning/who-was-linnaeus/linnaeus-and-race#:\\~:text=Linnaeus was the first naturalist,later on in his career](https://www.linnean.org/learning/who-was-linnaeus/linnaeus-and-race#:\\~:text=Linnaeus%20was%20the%20first%20naturalist,later%20on%20in%20his%20career).\n\nThis helped set the trend for European race science, with revered intellectuals and academics such as David Hume and Immanuel Kant waxing lyrical about the inferiority of Black people. I’ll just mention one other notable figure – the nineteenth century German philosopher Hegel. Here are some nuggets taken from an essay entitled “Critical Notes on Hegel’s Treatment of Africa” by Omotade Adegbindin:\n\n*“Hegel refers to “Africa Proper” as “the lad of childhood, which lying beyond the day of self-conscious history, is enveloped in the dark mantel of Night.” He also holds that “in Negro life the characteristic point is the fact that consciousness has not yet attained to the realization of any substantial objective existence.” Therefore, the African has not reached the level of realizing his own being; he has not yet realized his person. In Hegel’s words, the African is “natural man in his completely wild and untamed state.” From the Hegelian perspective, the African is still under the influence of nature. Hence Africa proper has no role in the world history. Until it attains the level where it can transcend the influence of the environment, at the minimal level of consciousness, Africa proper is unable to fit within Hegel’s philosophical scheme.”*\n\nEven if you’ve never heard these actual words, the message will be familiar to you. It has echoed throughout Western modern history. Today for example, there is a thriving online scene of “race realists” who propagate the idea that Black people have a genetically determined low level of intelligence, and that this explains us being at the bottom of the social ladder almost everywhere in the world. You can bring up the monkey chants that Black footballers have faced from crowds at football stadiums across the World, for decades. Witness the infamous cartoon comparing (mixed-race) US President Barack Obama to King Kong. There is a widespread and deep-rooted notion in European modernity that Black people are not human, or at least are right on edges of what can be considered human. I recommend a Washington Post article from 2019 called “A Brief History of the enduring phony sconce that perpetuates white supremacy” for a good overview of this rich tradition. <https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-brief-history-of-the-enduring-phony-science-that-perpetuates-white-supremacy/2019/04/29/20e6aef0-5aeb-11e9-a00e-050dc7b82693_story.html>\n\n**Slavery and humanness**\n\nLinneas, Kant, Hume, Hegel and others were writing during the height of the European enslavement of Africans. It’s commonly said that this race science or scientific racism was designed to provide intellectual and scientific rationalisation for this enslavement. Africanswere not human, so enslaving them was not an affront to humanism. This may well be true, but Afropessimists would argue that it’s deeper than that. They’d argue that it was (and still is) necessary to have slaves in order for the category of human to make sense. Without slaves, they’d argue, humanity would cease to be a meaningful concept. To quote from Saidiya Hartman, a major influence on Afropessimism in her book Scenes of Subjection:\n\n*“The slave is the object or the ground that makes possible the existence of the bourgeois subject and, by negation or contradistinction, defines liberty, citizenship, and the enclosures of the social body.”*\n\nAn analogy to this might be the necessity for foreigners to exist in order for the category of nationals to make sense. Any group of people needs to be able to define itself against another group. If no other groups existed, then the concept of being, say, German would be nonsensical. So the concept of human needs slaves to define itself against.\n\nBut if this is the case, what happened once slavery ended? Well, Afropessimists argue that although slavery was formally abolished - it didn’t really end for Africans in the diaspora. This is a common theme in 20th and 21st century Black radical traditions. Many Black thinkers, writers, activists have emphasised the continuing nature of the slave condition for Africans. The For example, Dr Amos Wilson in his seminal lecture Blueprint for Black Power said this:\n\n*“We are still of the same consciousness; we are still in the same position because we are still servants of the white man. Our reason for being in America is to serve white folk and to generate wealth for them. There has been no change at all in terms of our relationship to these people. The values that we pursue are slave values —and the values of servants. The social relations that we create and interact with were built and developed during the periods of slavery. We have not escaped it at all*.” <https://revolutionarystrategicstudies.wordpress.com/2011/08/22/blueprint-for-black-power/>\n\nAnd Saidiya Hartman coined the term the afterlife life of slavery when she writes in her book [Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/82680):\n\n*“If slavery persists as an issue in the political life of black America, it is not because of an antiquarian obsession with bygone days or the burden of a too-long memory, but because black lives are still imperiled and devalued by a racial calculus and a political arithmetic that were entrenched centuries ago. This is the afterlife of slavery–skewed life chances, limited access to health and education, premature death, incarceration, and impoverishment.”*\n\nAfropessimists argue that Black people are positioned outside of humanness because, again, humanness requires a fall guy. The World as we know it needs a foil. This will not change until the World as we know it us destroyed.", "timestamp": 1633550211, "digest": "crtMuMt5tPC33W4-7JIcBdl3mmdpWPF5jl1guqngmFE", "contributor": "0xFF1F91E6811ceAbDa26997159e8e11bd430eBD73"}
{"id": "p7gHtMCiBf6Lx-nvhVK1WsODZpfY0HxX8Pc7jSuNEnA", "title": "A Legal Perspective on Micromobility — Part I", "body": "As much as we might like it to be, transportation by motor vehicle has never been a right. Liberty of movement is a long-recognized Constitutional and international human right, but it has never included movement by any means other than our own physical power applied to walking or running, pushing ourselves on free-rolling wheels, or pedaling a bicycle.\n\nIn its most significant context, micromobility is the exercise of a legal right to use a proxy motor (a motor, not coincidentally, with about the power of one able-bodied human) in furtherance of one’s liberty of movement, in the same places people move under their own power. It is the result of practical, accidental or deliberate policy choices to exempt certain low-speed transportation modes from regulation as motor vehicles.\n\nMicromobility is not a product of technology — though technology will help it reach its maximum potential. The leap that put motors on bikes and scooters occurred more than 120 years ago. Engines grew in power (to 50ccs or more) to keep up with automobiles in the road, or stayed small (think two-stroke smoke and noise) and struggled for regulatory existence in the inconsistent margins between street and sidewalk.\n\nClear distinctions were cemented into U.S. law — and our psyches — between space for motor vehicles and space for people. Access to the latter had to be earned by physical exertion; a currency not everyone enjoyed spending when effortless motor vehicles were so readily available. Personal preferences drove policy priorities, and the lion’s share of public mobility space was created for and allocated to automobiles. Consequently, cycling has remained a niche transport mode in the U.S. for over a century.\n\nAdvances in battery-electric power created a quiet and inconspicuous way to pay the labor toll for bicycle mobility (while riders still appeared to be earning it). In 2002, the U.S. Congress recognized the emerging popularity of “low-speed battery-electric bicycles” (defined as having two or three wheels, motors no larger than 750 watts, capable of no more than 20 mph) and classified them as consumer products rather than as motor vehicles. Not surprisingly, e-bike sales began accelerating even as total bicycle sales remained flat.\n\nSecond order effects of mobile computing and GPS technology have enabled new business models like bike share to monetize personal mobility and expand our liberty of movement by assuming burdens of mode security, availability and immediacy. But the clear consumer preference for e-bikes over mechanical bikes demonstrates that the greatest value to be mined in personal mobility is in supplying motive power. As people increasingly patronize these businesses and enjoy effortless personal mobility for the first time, awareness is spreading about how little space is actually set aside for the safe exercise of it. That is about to change.\n\nThe significance of micromobility is more than just human-powered modes gaining a motor. Micromobility puts a figurative motor on the fundamental liberty of movement itself — raising, leveling and democratizing access to economic and social opportunity. It allows everyone, regardless of ability or disability, age, energy or state of health, the right to seek and obtain (for relatively little expense) sustained and inexhaustible supplies of one strong human power for their personal mobility. That amount of liberty was previously unavailable at any price — except by the strenuous efforts of the most able among us, and then only for brief durations of time.\n\nUsing a legal perspective allows us to place micromobility in historic context with other transportation revolutions, to define maximum performance and design characteristics of specific modes, to better appreciate economic threats and opportunities, and to offer prescriptive policies so that we can safely realize the full societal benefits of its potential.\n\n**Parts II and III to come.**", "timestamp": 1633550500, "digest": "kOC0idIGO7W989KLEY3Mebvd5N6pWZvMa5PHHhb2ifg", "contributor": "0x6bd04628a5cf39FAB96d34B12C1f1d5329188386"}

Web3 Authentication in the Pseudonymous Economy.", "body": "![Physical 0xmons cards, claimable through NFTs on platform seen.haus](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*43e9v8PB5QcaXsIz0uXNFA.png?size=large)\n\nThe original “NFTs as Keys” article has been [published on Medium on July 18th](https://medium.com/@mitchoz/nfts-as-keys-web3-authentication-in-the-pseudonymous-economy-146fd321223b). \n As a believer in web3, I am happy that I can finally publish it on mirror.xyz. \n  \n 3 Months after its initial publication, NFT and web3 markets have evolved. It becomes clearer every day that many of the assumptions made in this article have turned out to be true. Trends are manifesting and concepts become reality. \n  \n The Web3 is inevitable.  \n Protocols will eat everything.  \n We will eventually tokenized everything. \n  \n **Novus Ordo Seclorum.** \n  \n ---\n\nSince the beginning of web authentication and login systems, having to remember multiple passwords and login credentials has been one of the biggest UX flaws on the internet, if not THE biggest.\n\nOn every platform, we use a different account. In order to access our accounts, we use centralized credentials which at the end of the day belong to big tech companies (like e-mail addresses or phone numbers). On top of that, the login systems themselves are often owned and designed by these same companies. This combination allows a few very powerful entities to exclusively control and monetize our authentication flows and user data.\n\nWith this article, I want to share some ideas on why I believe that authentication services on the internet desperately need an update, how this update can be achieved and what it means for future online societies.\n\nBefore we dive into the matter, a disclaimer:\n\nI wrote this article in a relatively optimistic manner, knowingly ignoring many of the current problems with web3 technology and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThese problems are political, economic, and social:\n\n* Hyper capitalist on-chain governance through financial power\n* Market manipulation with NFTs and obvious Ponzi schemes fuelled by bots\n* Lack of customer support, eg. on the loss of password/private keys\n* Doxing\n\nI am happy to discuss these issues and might address some of them in future articles.\n\n## Web3 wallets, NFTs, and the pseudonymous economy.\n\nThe innovation that I will talk about in this article is related to the so-called “Web3” and blockchain wallets.\n\nIn case you have never actively interacted with Ethereum or another blockchain that has working smart contracts, chances are high that you will have a hard time understanding many of the ideas that are going to follow. But please bear with me as I try to elaborate on most of the premises.\n\nHowever if you’ve already used a tool like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or have interacted with decentralized technology (no, trading cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges doesn’t count), you have surely already had one or more “Aha” moments. But even then, you might still struggle to realize the enormous and mostly unexplored potential that lies ahead in this space.\n\n## First things first: What’s Web3?\n\nWeb3 is the next iteration of the internet. The future of the worldwide web is a combination of blockchain technology and existing web infrastructures which, together, create completely decentralized use cases and apps we call “dapps” (decentralized apps).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0\\*jhvBnCyac9TKNZhZ)\n\nIn order to interact with this technology, you need specific browser addons: web3 wallets. These wallets (like for example Metamask mentioned already above) allow you to store cryptocurrencies (fungible tokens) and Non-Fungible Tokens (“NFTs”, extreme simplification: unique digital assets represented by a specific TokenID) on a blockchain network of your choice (most popularly Ethereum).\n\nUsing these wallets is fairly simple. They’re supported by every major Desktop browser, like Chrome or Firefox. Some alternative Browsers like for example [Brave](https://brave.com/?utm_source=goneon.lu) (which I can highly recommend) have them preinstalled. A flaw: Most mobile browsers don’t have native support yet.\n\nWhen you install such a wallet you are assigned a private cryptographic key or seed phrase (that you need to store safely because it’s your recovery code) and with this private key, you effectively own a blockchain address. This private key can be moved to — and used on whatever web3 wallet you like, it doesn’t have to be the same wallet provider, in our example Metamask.\n\nIf your first thought now is: Wait, what if somebody steals my wallet? Don’t worry: it’s \\*\\*way \\*\\*more difficult to find out your 256-bit private key than it is to find out your email and “pw1234” combo.\n\nWith this blockchain address of yours (or more specifically with this so-called “Externally Owned Account” — EOA) you can now securely store digital assets and sign blockchain transactions. Such transactions can have different purposes. The most prominent one is sending tokens (Fungible or Non-Fungible) to another wallet. However, transferring assets or cryptocurrencies is by far not the only option. In the following article I want to address one specific use case:\n\n## Authentication through NFTs on web3 wallets — “NFTs as Keys”.\n\nWhile some users may have made first experiences with Web3 NFT products through [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) or lately through [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), I feel like the general public is still mostly oblivious to the possibilities.\n\nIf you have never heard of NFTs, you may want to pause reading here and do some homework first: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token>\n\n## “Show me your NFTs and I will tell you who you are”\n\nA blockchain account (EOA as explained above) can be used to authenticate and connect to different dapps.\n\nIn your Web3 wallet application, you can store more than just 1 account. You can then choose 1 account to connect to platform A, and another to connect to platform B. On truly decentralized apps, there is no initial KYC (Know-your-customer), no real-name policy, and no identity for these connections. At the very beginning, a new account is empty and anonymous.\n\n**That is until you decide to add certain assets to your wallet.**\n\nAt this point, it’s important to understand that anything you do on a public blockchain like Ethereum is by default indeed **public**. When created, an account is empty with 0 transactions. However, all of the account activity that follows (like for example signing transactions, sending money, or buying NFTs) can be analyzed for example via [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/). Such an analysis also includes displaying all your assets, fungible (eg. cryptocurrencies) or non-fungible (eg. NFTs).\n\nNow for NFTs, they represent digital data that can be owned by these wallets. NFTs can have properties and metadata, and through said metadata, they gain value(s). The properties they can have are vast, they can be fictional or practical. For example, NFT use-cases range from the Ethereum Name System (ENS) “.eth” domains to digital art pieces over to digital items, liquidity positions, and even debt with a negative value. In fact, they can be anything their creator wants them to represent/store.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*_NKnNl-AQuTYkN9X)\n\n\\*Slide from Balaji Srinivasan: The Pseudonymous Economy — \\**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urtXRg9Nl3k](http://%20https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urtXRg9Nl3k)*\n\nHolding specific NFTs in a wallet thus means combining/linking these properties to a blockchain address. The NFTs you hold define who you are\\*\\*. \\*\\*A quick look through Etherscan.io with your account address will display all the NFTs you own.\n\nFor example: buying the yourname.eth domain with your account can make it quite obvious that a specific address belongs to you aka “yourname”.\n\nWe can therefore say:\n\n> ***A wallet is a priori anonymous.***\n>\n> ***NFTs make it pseudonymous.***\n\nNFTs assign attributes, values, properties, items and thus turn anonymity into meta-identity. These assignments can, as already mentioned, happen through the Ethereum Name System, your wallet liquidity, your profile picture NFTs, your Metaverse accessories, and many more factors.\n\n**NFTs add properties to otherwise blind and anonymous authentication software.**\n\n## An open item layer\n\nThe NFTs themselves are available on an open, decentralized, global market. Through visual platforms like Opensea.io, users can today easily interact with Ethereum Smart Contracts and established standards like ERC-721 or ERC-1155. They can auction, buy or sell tokens according to basic (still unregulated) rules of code.\n\nSince all of these non-fungible items are available on a decentralized ledger, we can go as far as considering blockchains like Ethereum open and public “**Item layers**” or “Asset layers”. We can also say: There’s now a virtual gigantic auction house on the internet that everyone can interact with.\n\nFrom this layer, developers can actively choose which assets to support on their own platforms through these open and standardized protocols.\n\n**As a user, this means that specific NFTs in your wallet allow you to unlock specific areas, features, skins, and items on future web platforms or in online games.**\n\nThese features already exist today.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/916/0\\*FCQvEomXLZPZvTzP)\n\n\\*Example of AR fashion by RTFKT (pronounced “Artefact”): \\**<https://www.tiktok.com/@rtfkt>*\n\n**Similar to the principle of “you are what you wear” in real life, the NFTs & properties you store in your wallet will define who you are online.**\n\nThis is an extremely powerful concept and it’s the idea behind what Balaji Srinivasan calls the\\*\\* “Pseudonymous Economy”\\*\\*. Our future online interactions will not be made by our identity cards or our anonymous wallets, they will be made by our pseudonymous accounts.\n\nThe NFTs you own define who you are. They define your credibility, your legitimacy, your online identity. You can transfer them, move them, sell them and build upon them.\n\n## At this point, we can therefore summarize: your wallets and NFTs mirror your digital personas on future online platforms.\n\n## They will store your clothes/skins, items, VIP access cards, credit scores, housing keys, etc. in a new pseudonymous economy.\n\n## “NFTs as keys”\n\nGoing back to authentication services: Web3 Wallets are de-facto password aggregators where you can use one password to unlock several credentials on multiple platforms.\n\n**“NFTs as keys”** extend the simple wallet/password authentication use-case. Once you use your wallet to connect to a specific platform, this platform will be able to read your wallet content (as soon as you press a “Connect wallet”). It will then identify your pseudonym.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/558/0\\*ZeztILialRonrKLw)\n\nAgain: You choose which wallet to use; you decide who you want to be, at what time, and in which universe (the political left should love this hehe).\n\nPlatforms like [seen.haus](https://seen.haus/) or projects like [“The Metakey”](https://themetakey.com/?utm_source=goneon.lu) (Picture) or [“Bored Ape Yacht Club”](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) already give a glimpse of what’s possible here.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/876/0\\*kXMWk6Eux4R9e4KB)\n\nHolding a specific NFT on an account gives access to special functionalities, as already demonstrated through these projects:\n\n**[seen.haus](https://seen.haus/?utm_source=goneon.lu)** — Order a physical item with your NFT\n\n**[MetaKey](https://themetakey.com/?utm_source=goneon.lu)** — Access certain areas in Decentraland, get airdrops, access to web platforms, …\n\n[BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/?utm_source=goneon.lu) — Gain exclusive access to “The Bathroom”\n\nFor companies, this is a powerful concept that can extend existing payment models. Imagine a “Coupon”-like Scenario, where instead of entering a “Coupon Code”, you connect through your web3 wallet and the coupon is automatically applied. In this case, you can think of your NFTs as the coupons that trigger a piece of code on the website you’re visiting.\n\n## Possible Use-Cases\n\nThink of business models like these:\n\n“Own our NFT — get free access to our fitness program”\n\n“Buy my NFT & watch all my courses for free”\n\n“Holding our NFT means receiving one free razor blade every month”\n\nOr as demonstrated by Gary Vaynerchuk: Owning one of his “VeeFriends” NFTs gives access to a dinner, a Google Hangout Call, and other perks: <https://www.veefriends.com/>\n\nFor economic success, a crucial part here are the programmatically **included royalties** an NFT creator can add to his/her smart contract: each time an NFT is sold to another person, the creator earns a predefined royalty.\n\nThis is both a blessing and a curse from an economical point of view.\n\n**Let me explain the business case through an example of an NFT premium membership card:**\n\nImagine your business is selling 100 exclusive NFTs that give access to your e-learning website “NFTacademy”. Since you’ve sold them as NFTs on a blockchain, these access rights are now tradable. This means that your community and active members will ultimately define their price on the secondary market. They define the amount of royalties you will earn in the long run (Remember: they technically own the NFTs, so they can sell them freely including all of the included perks).\n\n**In this case, our membership card is a key to the e-learning platform. Users can only connect to our exclusive member area if they own our “NFTacademy” NFT.**\n\nHowever, as the creator, you control the market/prices. You can mint new NFTs and reduce scarcity or you can improve your product so that the existing NFTs become more valuable. Or do both.\n\n1. If you mint new NFTs that provide access to your product/service you will make a quick buck, but by doing so reduce the price of the existing NFTs in circulation. Thus you may earn fewer royalties over time because there is less activity on the secondary market.\n2. If you decide to improve your actual product/service without new NFT memberships, you will earn more royalties over time (because demand will increase), but you won’t onboard new members.\n\nIt’s not trivial to predict what the best financial outcome for you will be. Your best bet will be determined by many factors, including your marketing strategy.\n\nIn the past months, we have seen many NFT projects rise on the internet. Prominent examples like the so-called “Profile Pic” Projects, eg. Cryptopunks, Bored Apes Yacht Club, Cool Cats, etc., or tons of artists who joined the hype train in 2021. A lot of innovation has happened in a very short time.\n\nUnfortunately, many of these projects were rushed to make a quick buck off the hype. So for most of these circulating NFTs:\\*\\* \\*\\*You cannot do anything tangible with them (not even sell them, because there is no market/ no demand), which at the end of the day makes them, sadly, quite useless.\n\n**The problem here is: many NFTs do not have any practical value.**\n\n**They lack the “web3” aspect. They lack authentication features. They lack a use-case.**\n\nNow what’s beautiful is that, because these NFTs live forever on the blockchain, **this use case can be constructed whenever by whomever.** So useless NFTs don’t need to stay useless forever.\n\nAt this stage we can sum things up:\n\n* Web3 wallets can be used to create online personas\n* EOAs (Externally owned accounts) are the backbone of a pseudonymous online society\n* NFTs turn anonymity into pseudonymity\n* Developers can attach a use-case to any NFT they like on this open “Item layer”\n* Businesses and creators can sell NFTs and add value to them as a business model\n* NFTs are tradable on a secondary market, the available use-cases influence their value\n* NFTs can be used to raise seed or VC funding as an alternative to platforms like Kickstarter\n\n## “Not your keys, not your data”\n\nNow you may still wonder: Why would I want a new authentication tool? Why should I bother?\n\n“I already have my Facebook Login”.\n\nA big problem you might be ignoring with existing centralized web2 login systems or rather centralized identifiers, in general, is that the users do not actually own the data they upload and the identifiers they use (eg. telephone numbers, email addresses, usernames on social media). On most existing web2 platforms it’s not possible for the individual user to actively control the flow of his/her data. This has not only led to many ethical and economic incidents in the past, for example when platforms did not take necessary security measures to protect user data from hacks or leaks, but it has also allowed Big Tech to accumulate an incredible amount of owned data. Data they can use to fuel their software products, most importantly their machine learning and big data algorithms. Furthermore said data is being used to sell targeted ads on centralized platforms, to the profit of some monopolistic, panoptic platforms.\n\nThese issues with centralization are also on the mind of the W3C. A week ago, a recommendation draft was released on the topic of so-called Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs): <https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/>\n\nNow it is important to understand that web3 wallets will by no means suddenly replace the existing identifier solutions. In fact, they don’t even want to (Proof of pseudonymity on web3 vs. Proof of identity on web2). However, they add a cryptographically secure, standardized, public, and open-source authentication layer on top. A layer that is pseudonymous. A layer that does not require government-issued identity cards, no telephone numbers for authentication, no clear name policy, and most importantly it has no need for a bank account or VISA card because payments are processed directly through the network (on every device anywhere in the world as long as you have free internet access).\n\nAs a result, over time, we might be able to make the world **a bit fairer** and **a bit more user-friendly** by collectively embracing cryptographically secure web3 wallets and the Non-Fungible Tokens that come with them. And who knows, maybe we might even be able to keep decent “freedom after speech” in most countries of the world.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## “NFTs as keys” have intrinsic value. They can unlock exclusive features, memberships, subscriptions, items, and more.\n\nThey allow developers to build a more secure web and more open/fair web.\n\nThey provide new marketing possibilities and fuel new community behavior for brands.\n\nThey extend simple authentication mechanisms of anonymous wallets and make these wallets pseudonymous.\n\nThey are the tool that will enable the pseudonymous economy.\n\nThey are tradable, immutable, economically interesting, cyberpunk, and in my opinion inevitable if we want to build a better, more sustainable, and freer internet.", "timestamp": 1633552702, "digest": "U3F2EbVuHXlujnrn4f3hunJDgUC53xgFUF27E9InAho", "contributor": "0x6871D1a603fEb9Cc2aA8213B9ab16B33e418cD8F"}

It becomes clearer every day that many of the assumptions made in this article have turned out to be true. Trends are manifesting and concepts become reality.\n\nThe Web3 is inevitable.Protocols will eat everything.We will eventually tokenized everything.\n\n**Novus Ordo Seclorum.**\n\n\n---\n\nSince the beginning of web authentication and login systems, having to remember multiple passwords and login credentials has been one of the biggest UX flaws on the internet, if not THE biggest.\n\nOn every platform, we use a different account. In order to access our accounts, we use centralized credentials which at the end of the day belong to big tech companies (like e-mail addresses or phone numbers). On top of that, the login systems themselves are often owned and designed by these same companies. This combination allows a few very powerful entities to exclusively control and monetize our authentication flows and user data.\n\nWith this article, I want to share some ideas on why I believe that authentication services on the internet desperately need an update, how this update can be achieved and what it means for future online societies.\n\nBefore we dive into the matter, a disclaimer:\n\nI wrote this article in a relatively optimistic manner, knowingly ignoring many of the current problems with web3 technology and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThese problems are political, economic, and social:\n\n* Hyper capitalist on-chain governance through financial power\n* Market manipulation with NFTs and obvious Ponzi schemes fuelled by bots\n* Lack of customer support, eg. on the loss of password/private keys\n* Doxing\n\nI am happy to discuss these issues and might address some of them in future articles.\n\n## Web3 wallets, NFTs, and the pseudonymous economy.\n\nThe innovation that I will talk about in this article is related to the so-called “Web3” and blockchain wallets.\n\nIn case you have never actively interacted with Ethereum or another blockchain that has working smart contracts, chances are high that you will have a hard time understanding many of the ideas that are going to follow. But please bear with me as I try to elaborate on most of the premises.\n\nHowever if you’ve already used a tool like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or have interacted with decentralized technology (no, trading cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges doesn’t count), you have surely already had one or more “Aha” moments. But even then, you might still struggle to realize the enormous and mostly unexplored potential that lies ahead in this space.\n\n## First things first: What’s Web3?\n\nWeb3 is the next iteration of the internet. The future of the worldwide web is a combination of blockchain technology and existing web infrastructures which, together, create completely decentralized use cases and apps we call “dapps” (decentralized apps).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0\\*jhvBnCyac9TKNZhZ)\n\nIn order to interact with this technology, you need specific browser addons: web3 wallets. These wallets (like for example Metamask mentioned already above) allow you to store cryptocurrencies (fungible tokens) and Non-Fungible Tokens (“NFTs”, extreme simplification: unique digital assets represented by a specific TokenID) on a blockchain network of your choice (most popularly Ethereum).\n\nUsing these wallets is fairly simple. They’re supported by every major Desktop browser, like Chrome or Firefox. Some alternative Browsers like for example [Brave](https://brave.com/?utm_source=goneon.lu) (which I can highly recommend) have them preinstalled. A flaw: Most mobile browsers don’t have native support yet.\n\nWhen you install such a wallet you are assigned a private cryptographic key or seed phrase (that you need to store safely because it’s your recovery code) and with this private key, you effectively own a blockchain address. This private key can be moved to — and used on whatever web3 wallet you like, it doesn’t have to be the same wallet provider, in our example Metamask.\n\nIf your first thought now is: Wait, what if somebody steals my wallet? Don’t worry: it’s \\*\\*way \\*\\*more difficult to find out your 256-bit private key than it is to find out your email and “pw1234” combo.\n\nWith this blockchain address of yours (or more specifically with this so-called “Externally Owned Account” — EOA) you can now securely store digital assets and sign blockchain transactions. Such transactions can have different purposes. The most prominent one is sending tokens (Fungible or Non-Fungible) to another wallet. However, transferring assets or cryptocurrencies is by far not the only option. In the following article I want to address one specific use case:\n\n## Authentication through NFTs on web3 wallets — “NFTs as Keys”.\n\nWhile some users may have made first experiences with Web3 NFT products through [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) or lately through [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), I feel like the general public is still mostly oblivious to the possibilities.\n\nIf you have never heard of NFTs, you may want to pause reading here and do some homework first: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token>\n\n## “Show me your NFTs and I will tell you who you are”\n\nA blockchain account (EOA as explained above) can be used to authenticate and connect to different dapps.\n\nIn your Web3 wallet application, you can store more than just 1 account. You can then choose 1 account to connect to platform A, and another to connect to platform B. On truly decentralized apps, there is no initial KYC (Know-your-customer), no real-name policy, and no identity for these connections. At the very beginning, a new account is empty and anonymous.\n\n**That is until you decide to add certain assets to your wallet.**\n\nAt this point, it’s important to understand that anything you do on a public blockchain like Ethereum is by default indeed **public**. When created, an account is empty with 0 transactions. However, all of the account activity that follows (like for example signing transactions, sending money, or buying NFTs) can be analyzed for example via [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/). Such an analysis also includes displaying all your assets, fungible (eg. cryptocurrencies) or non-fungible (eg. NFTs).\n\nNow for NFTs, they represent digital data that can be owned by these wallets. NFTs can have properties and metadata, and through said metadata, they gain value(s). The properties they can have are vast, they can be fictional or practical. For example, NFT use-cases range from the Ethereum Name System (ENS) “.eth” domains to digital art pieces over to digital items, liquidity positions, and even debt with a negative value. In fact, they can be anything their creator wants them to represent/store.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*_NKnNl-AQuTYkN9X)\n\n\\*Slide from Balaji Srinivasan: The Pseudonymous Economy — \\**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urtXRg9Nl3k](http://%20https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urtXRg9Nl3k)*\n\nHolding specific NFTs in a wallet thus means combining/linking these properties to a blockchain address. The NFTs you hold define who you are\\*\\*. \\*\\*A quick look through Etherscan.io with your account address will display all the NFTs you own.\n\nFor example: buying the yourname.eth domain with your account can make it quite obvious that a specific address belongs to you aka “yourname”.\n\nWe can therefore say:\n\n> ***A wallet is a priori anonymous.***\n>\n> ***NFTs make it pseudonymous.***\n\nNFTs assign attributes, values, properties, items and thus turn anonymity into meta-identity. These assignments can, as already mentioned, happen through the Ethereum Name System, your wallet liquidity, your profile picture NFTs, your Metaverse accessories, and many more factors.\n\n**NFTs add properties to otherwise blind and anonymous authentication software.**\n\n## An open item layer\n\nThe NFTs themselves are available on an open, decentralized, global market. Through visual platforms like Opensea.io, users can today easily interact with Ethereum Smart Contracts and established standards like ERC-721 or ERC-1155. They can auction, buy or sell tokens according to basic (still unregulated) rules of code.\n\nSince all of these non-fungible items are available on a decentralized ledger, we can go as far as considering blockchains like Ethereum open and public “**Item layers**” or “Asset layers”. We can also say: There’s now a virtual gigantic auction house on the internet that everyone can interact with.\n\nFrom this layer, developers can actively choose which assets to support on their own platforms through these open and standardized protocols.\n\n**As a user, this means that specific NFTs in your wallet allow you to unlock specific areas, features, skins, and items on future web platforms or in online games.**\n\nThese features already exist today.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/916/0\\*FCQvEomXLZPZvTzP)\n\n\\*Example of AR fashion by RTFKT (pronounced “Artefact”): \\**<https://www.tiktok.com/@rtfkt>*\n\n**Similar to the principle of “you are what you wear” in real life, the NFTs & properties you store in your wallet will define who you are online.**\n\nThis is an extremely powerful concept and it’s the idea behind what Balaji Srinivasan calls the\\*\\* “Pseudonymous Economy”\\*\\*. Our future online interactions will not be made by our identity cards or our anonymous wallets, they will be made by our pseudonymous accounts.\n\nThe NFTs you own define who you are. They define your credibility, your legitimacy, your online identity. You can transfer them, move them, sell them and build upon them.\n\n## At this point, we can therefore summarize: your wallets and NFTs mirror your digital personas on future online platforms.\n\n## They will store your clothes/skins, items, VIP access cards, credit scores, housing keys, etc. in a new pseudonymous economy.\n\n## “NFTs as keys”\n\nGoing back to authentication services: Web3 Wallets are de-facto password aggregators where you can use one password to unlock several credentials on multiple platforms.\n\n**“NFTs as keys”** extend the simple wallet/password authentication use-case. Once you use your wallet to connect to a specific platform, this platform will be able to read your wallet content (as soon as you press a “Connect wallet”). It will then identify your pseudonym.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/558/0\\*ZeztILialRonrKLw)\n\nAgain: You choose which wallet to use; you decide who you want to be, at what time, and in which universe (the political left should love this hehe).\n\nPlatforms like [seen.haus](https://seen.haus/) or projects like [“The Metakey”](https://themetakey.com/?utm_source=goneon.lu) (Picture) or [“Bored Ape Yacht Club”](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) already give a glimpse of what’s possible here.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/876/0\\*kXMWk6Eux4R9e4KB)\n\nHolding a specific NFT on an account gives access to special functionalities, as already demonstrated through these projects:\n\n**[seen.haus](https://seen.haus/?utm_source=goneon.lu)** — Order a physical item with your NFT\n\n**[MetaKey](https://themetakey.com/?utm_source=goneon.lu)** — Access certain areas in Decentraland, get airdrops, access to web platforms, …\n\n[BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/?utm_source=goneon.lu) — Gain exclusive access to “The Bathroom”\n\nFor companies, this is a powerful concept that can extend existing payment models. Imagine a “Coupon”-like Scenario, where instead of entering a “Coupon Code”, you connect through your web3 wallet and the coupon is automatically applied. In this case, you can think of your NFTs as the coupons that trigger a piece of code on the website you’re visiting.\n\n## Possible Use-Cases\n\nThink of business models like these:\n\n“Own our NFT — get free access to our fitness program”\n\n“Buy my NFT & watch all my courses for free”\n\n“Holding our NFT means receiving one free razor blade every month”\n\nOr as demonstrated by Gary Vaynerchuk: Owning one of his “VeeFriends” NFTs gives access to a dinner, a Google Hangout Call, and other perks: <https://www.veefriends.com/>\n\nFor economic success, a crucial part here are the programmatically **included royalties** an NFT creator can add to his/her smart contract: each time an NFT is sold to another person, the creator earns a predefined royalty.\n\nThis is both a blessing and a curse from an economical point of view.\n\n**Let me explain the business case through an example of an NFT premium membership card:**\n\nImagine your business is selling 100 exclusive NFTs that give access to your e-learning website “NFTacademy”. Since you’ve sold them as NFTs on a blockchain, these access rights are now tradable. This means that your community and active members will ultimately define their price on the secondary market. They define the amount of royalties you will earn in the long run (Remember: they technically own the NFTs, so they can sell them freely including all of the included perks).\n\n**In this case, our membership card is a key to the e-learning platform. Users can only connect to our exclusive member area if they own our “NFTacademy” NFT.**\n\nHowever, as the creator, you control the market/prices. You can mint new NFTs and reduce scarcity or you can improve your product so that the existing NFTs become more valuable. Or do both.\n\n1. If you mint new NFTs that provide access to your product/service you will make a quick buck, but by doing so reduce the price of the existing NFTs in circulation. Thus you may earn fewer royalties over time because there is less activity on the secondary market.\n2. If you decide to improve your actual product/service without new NFT memberships, you will earn more royalties over time (because demand will increase), but you won’t onboard new members.\n\nIt’s not trivial to predict what the best financial outcome for you will be. Your best bet will be determined by many factors, including your marketing strategy.\n\nIn the past months, we have seen many NFT projects rise on the internet. Prominent examples like the so-called “Profile Pic” Projects, eg. Cryptopunks, Bored Apes Yacht Club, Cool Cats, etc., or tons of artists who joined the hype train in 2021. A lot of innovation has happened in a very short time.\n\nUnfortunately, many of these projects were rushed to make a quick buck off the hype. So for most of these circulating NFTs:\\*\\* \\*\\*You cannot do anything tangible with them (not even sell them, because there is no market/ no demand), which at the end of the day makes them, sadly, quite useless.\n\n**The problem here is: many NFTs do not have any practical value.**\n\n**They lack the “web3” aspect. They lack authentication features. They lack a use-case.**\n\nNow what’s beautiful is that, because these NFTs live forever on the blockchain, **this use case can be constructed whenever by whomever.** So useless NFTs don’t need to stay useless forever.\n\nAt this stage we can sum things up:\n\n* Web3 wallets can be used to create online personas\n* EOAs (Externally owned accounts) are the backbone of a pseudonymous online society\n* NFTs turn anonymity into pseudonymity\n* Developers can attach a use-case to any NFT they like on this open “Item layer”\n* Businesses and creators can sell NFTs and add value to them as a business model\n* NFTs are tradable on a secondary market, the available use-cases influence their value\n* NFTs can be used to raise seed or VC funding as an alternative to platforms like Kickstarter\n\n## “Not your keys, not your data”\n\nNow you may still wonder: Why would I want a new authentication tool? Why should I bother?\n\n“I already have my Facebook Login”.\n\nA big problem you might be ignoring with existing centralized web2 login systems or rather centralized identifiers, in general, is that the users do not actually own the data they upload and the identifiers they use (eg. telephone numbers, email addresses, usernames on social media).

{"id": "MGnQrj_GpLGUdzHN60Nr0sgujY2NJjxcT9TN2YaXVwM", "title": "A Legal Perspective on Micromobility — Part I", "body": "As much as we might like it to be, transportation by motor vehicle has never been a right. Liberty of movement is a long-recognized Constitutional and international human right, but it has never included movement by any means other than our own physical power applied to walking or running, pushing ourselves on free-rolling wheels, or pedaling a bicycle.\n\nIn its most significant context, micromobility is the exercise of a legal right to use a proxy motor (a motor, not coincidentally, with about the power of one able-bodied human) in furtherance of one’s liberty of movement, in the same places people move under their own power. It is the result of practical, accidental or deliberate policy choices to exempt certain low-speed transportation modes from regulation as motor vehicles.\n\nMicromobility is not a product of technology — though technology will help it reach its maximum potential. The leap that put motors on bikes and scooters occurred more than 120 years ago. Engines grew in power (to 50ccs or more) to keep up with automobiles in the road, or stayed small (think two-stroke smoke and noise) and struggled for regulatory existence in the inconsistent margins between street and sidewalk.\n\nClear distinctions were cemented into U.S. law — and our psyches — between space for motor vehicles and space for people. Access to the latter had to be earned by physical exertion; a currency not everyone enjoyed spending when effortless motor vehicles were so readily available. Personal preferences drove policy priorities, and the lion’s share of public mobility space was created for and allocated to automobiles. Consequently, cycling has remained a niche transport mode in the U.S. for over a century.\n\nAdvances in battery-electric power created a quiet and inconspicuous way to pay the labor toll for bicycle mobility (while riders still appeared to be earning it). In 2002, the U.S. Congress recognized the emerging popularity of “low-speed battery-electric bicycles” (defined as having two or three wheels, motors no larger than 750 watts, capable of no more than 20 mph) and classified them as consumer products rather than as motor vehicles. Not surprisingly, e-bike sales began accelerating even as total bicycle sales remained flat.\n\nSecond order effects of mobile computing and GPS technology have enabled new business models like bike share to monetize personal mobility and expand our liberty of movement by assuming burdens of mode security, availability and immediacy. But the clear consumer preference for e-bikes over mechanical bikes demonstrates that the greatest value to be mined in personal mobility is in supplying motive power. As people increasingly patronize these businesses and enjoy effortless personal mobility for the first time, awareness is spreading about how little space is actually set aside for the safe exercise of it. That is about to change.\n\nThe significance of micromobility is more than just human-powered modes gaining a motor. Micromobility puts a figurative motor on the fundamental liberty of movement itself — raising, leveling and democratizing access to economic and social opportunity. It allows everyone, regardless of ability or disability, age, energy or state of health, the right to seek and obtain (for relatively little expense) sustained and inexhaustible supplies of one strong human power for their personal mobility. That amount of liberty was previously unavailable at any price — except by the strenuous efforts of the most able among us, and then only for brief durations of time.\n\nUsing a legal perspective allows us to place micromobility in historic context with other transportation revolutions, to define maximum performance and design characteristics of specific modes, to better appreciate economic threats and opportunities, and to offer prescriptive policies so that we can safely realize the full societal benefits of its potential.\n\n**Parts II and III to come.**", "timestamp": 1633552881, "digest": "kOC0idIGO7W989KLEY3Mebvd5N6pWZvMa5PHHhb2ifg", "contributor": "0x6bd04628a5cf39FAB96d34B12C1f1d5329188386"}

This combination allows a few very powerful entities to exclusively control and monetize our authentication flows and user data.\n\nWith this article, I want to share some ideas on why I believe that authentication services on the internet desperately need an update, how this update can be achieved and what it means for future online societies.\n\nBefore we dive into the matter, a disclaimer:\n\nI wrote this article in a relatively optimistic manner, knowingly ignoring many of the current problems with web3 technology and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThese problems are political, economic, and social:\n\n* Hyper capitalist on-chain governance through financial power\n* Market manipulation with NFTs and obvious Ponzi schemes fuelled by bots\n* Lack of customer support, eg. on the loss of password/private keys\n* Doxing\n\nI am happy to discuss these issues and might address some of them in future articles.\n\n## Web3 wallets, NFTs, and the pseudonymous economy.\n\nThe innovation that I will talk about in this article is related to the so-called “Web3” and blockchain wallets.\n\nIn case you have never actively interacted with Ethereum or another blockchain that has working smart contracts, chances are high that you will have a hard time understanding many of the ideas that are going to follow. But please bear with me as I try to elaborate on most of the premises.\n\nHowever if you’ve already used a tool like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or have interacted with decentralized technology (no, trading cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges doesn’t count), you have surely already had one or more “Aha” moments. But even then, you might still struggle to realize the enormous and mostly unexplored potential that lies ahead in this space.\n\n## First things first: What’s Web3?\n\nWeb3 is the next iteration of the internet. The future of the worldwide web is a combination of blockchain technology and existing web infrastructures which, together, create completely decentralized use cases and apps we call “dapps” (decentralized apps).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0\\*jhvBnCyac9TKNZhZ)\n\nIn order to interact with this technology, you need specific browser addons: web3 wallets. These wallets (like for example Metamask mentioned already above) allow you to store cryptocurrencies (fungible tokens) and Non-Fungible Tokens (“NFTs”, extreme simplification: unique digital assets represented by a specific TokenID) on a blockchain network of your choice (most popularly Ethereum).\n\nUsing these wallets is fairly simple. They’re supported by every major Desktop browser, like Chrome or Firefox. Some alternative Browsers like for example [Brave](https://brave.com/?utm_source=goneon.lu) (which I can highly recommend) have them preinstalled. A flaw: Most mobile browsers don’t have native support yet.\n\nWhen you install such a wallet you are assigned a private cryptographic key or seed phrase (that you need to store safely because it’s your recovery code) and with this private key, you effectively own a blockchain address. This private key can be moved to — and used on whatever web3 wallet you like, it doesn’t have to be the same wallet provider, in our example Metamask.\n\nIf your first thought now is: Wait, what if somebody steals my wallet? Don’t worry: it’s \\*\\*way \\*\\*more difficult to find out your 256-bit private key than it is to find out your email and “pw1234” combo.\n\nWith this blockchain address of yours (or more specifically with this so-called “Externally Owned Account” — EOA) you can now securely store digital assets and sign blockchain transactions. Such transactions can have different purposes. The most prominent one is sending tokens (Fungible or Non-Fungible) to another wallet. However, transferring assets or cryptocurrencies is by far not the only option. In the following article I want to address one specific use case:\n\n## Authentication through NFTs on web3 wallets — “NFTs as Keys”.\n\nWhile some users may have made first experiences with Web3 NFT products through [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) or lately through [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), I feel like the general public is still mostly oblivious to the possibilities.\n\nIf you have never heard of NFTs, you may want to pause reading here and do some homework first: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token>\n\n## “Show me your NFTs and I will tell you who you are”\n\nA blockchain account (EOA as explained above) can be used to authenticate and connect to different dapps.\n\nIn your Web3 wallet application, you can store more than just 1 account. You can then choose 1 account to connect to platform A, and another to connect to platform B. On truly decentralized apps, there is no initial KYC (Know-your-customer), no real-name policy, and no identity for these connections. At the very beginning, a new account is empty and anonymous.\n\n**That is until you decide to add certain assets to your wallet.**\n\nAt this point, it’s important to understand that anything you do on a public blockchain like Ethereum is by default indeed **public**. When created, an account is empty with 0 transactions. However, all of the account activity that follows (like for example signing transactions, sending money, or buying NFTs) can be analyzed for example via [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/). Such an analysis also includes displaying all your assets, fungible (eg. cryptocurrencies) or non-fungible (eg. NFTs).\n\nNow for NFTs, they represent digital data that can be owned by these wallets. NFTs can have properties and metadata, and through said metadata, they gain value(s). The properties they can have are vast, they can be fictional or practical. For example, NFT use-cases range from the Ethereum Name System (ENS) “.eth” domains to digital art pieces over to digital items, liquidity positions, and even debt with a negative value. In fact, they can be anything their creator wants them to represent/store.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*_NKnNl-AQuTYkN9X)\n\n\\*Slide from Balaji Srinivasan: The Pseudonymous Economy — \\**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urtXRg9Nl3k](http://%20https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urtXRg9Nl3k)*\n\nHolding specific NFTs in a wallet thus means combining/linking these properties to a blockchain address. The NFTs you hold define who you are\\*\\*. \\*\\*A quick look through Etherscan.io with your account address will display all the NFTs you own.\n\nFor example: buying the yourname.eth domain with your account can make it quite obvious that a specific address belongs to you aka “yourname”.\n\nWe can therefore say:\n\n> ***A wallet is a priori anonymous.***\n>\n> ***NFTs make it pseudonymous.***\n\nNFTs assign attributes, values, properties, items and thus turn anonymity into meta-identity. These assignments can, as already mentioned, happen through the Ethereum Name System, your wallet liquidity, your profile picture NFTs, your Metaverse accessories, and many more factors.\n\n**NFTs add properties to otherwise blind and anonymous authentication software.**\n\n## An open item layer\n\nThe NFTs themselves are available on an open, decentralized, global market. Through visual platforms like Opensea.io, users can today easily interact with Ethereum Smart Contracts and established standards like ERC-721 or ERC-1155. They can auction, buy or sell tokens according to basic (still unregulated) rules of code.\n\nSince all of these non-fungible items are available on a decentralized ledger, we can go as far as considering blockchains like Ethereum open and public “**Item layers**” or “Asset layers”. We can also say: There’s now a virtual gigantic auction house on the internet that everyone can interact with.\n\nFrom this layer, developers can actively choose which assets to support on their own platforms through these open and standardized protocols.\n\n**As a user, this means that specific NFTs in your wallet allow you to unlock specific areas, features, skins, and items on future web platforms or in online games.**\n\nThese features already exist today.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/916/0\\*FCQvEomXLZPZvTzP)\n\n\\*Example of AR fashion by RTFKT (pronounced “Artefact”): \\**<https://www.tiktok.com/@rtfkt>*\n\n**Similar to the principle of “you are what you wear” in real life, the NFTs & properties you store in your wallet will define who you are online.**\n\nThis is an extremely powerful concept and it’s the idea behind what Balaji Srinivasan calls the\\*\\* “Pseudonymous Economy”\\*\\*. Our future online interactions will not be made by our identity cards or our anonymous wallets, they will be made by our pseudonymous accounts.\n\nThe NFTs you own define who you are. They define your credibility, your legitimacy, your online identity. You can transfer them, move them, sell them and build upon them.\n\n## At this point, we can therefore summarize: your wallets and NFTs mirror your digital personas on future online platforms.\n\n## They will store your clothes/skins, items, VIP access cards, credit scores, housing keys, etc. in a new pseudonymous economy.\n\n## “NFTs as keys”\n\nGoing back to authentication services: Web3 Wallets are de-facto password aggregators where you can use one password to unlock several credentials on multiple platforms.\n\n**“NFTs as keys”** extend the simple wallet/password authentication use-case. Once you use your wallet to connect to a specific platform, this platform will be able to read your wallet content (as soon as you press a “Connect wallet”). It will then identify your pseudonym.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/558/0\\*ZeztILialRonrKLw)\n\nAgain: You choose which wallet to use; you decide who you want to be, at what time, and in which universe (the political left should love this hehe).\n\nPlatforms like [seen.haus](https://seen.haus/) or projects like [“The Metakey”](https://themetakey.com/?utm_source=goneon.lu) (Picture) or [“Bored Ape Yacht Club”](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) already give a glimpse of what’s possible here.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/876/0\\*kXMWk6Eux4R9e4KB)\n\nHolding a specific NFT on an account gives access to special functionalities, as already demonstrated through these projects:\n\n**[seen.haus](https://seen.haus/?utm_source=goneon.lu)** — Order a physical item with your NFT\n\n**[MetaKey](https://themetakey.com/?utm_source=goneon.lu)** — Access certain areas in Decentraland, get airdrops, access to web platforms, …\n\n[BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/?utm_source=goneon.lu) — Gain exclusive access to “The Bathroom”\n\nFor companies, this is a powerful concept that can extend existing payment models. Imagine a “Coupon”-like Scenario, where instead of entering a “Coupon Code”, you connect through your web3 wallet and the coupon is automatically applied. In this case, you can think of your NFTs as the coupons that trigger a piece of code on the website you’re visiting.\n\n## Possible Use-Cases\n\nThink of business models like these:\n\n“Own our NFT — get free access to our fitness program”\n\n“Buy my NFT & watch all my courses for free”\n\n“Holding our NFT means receiving one free razor blade every month”\n\nOr as demonstrated by Gary Vaynerchuk: Owning one of his “VeeFriends” NFTs gives access to a dinner, a Google Hangout Call, and other perks: <https://www.veefriends.com/>\n\nFor economic success, a crucial part here are the programmatically **included royalties** an NFT creator can add to his/her smart contract: each time an NFT is sold to another person, the creator earns a predefined royalty.\n\nThis is both a blessing and a curse from an economical point of view.\n\n**Let me explain the business case through an example of an NFT premium membership card:**\n\nImagine your business is selling 100 exclusive NFTs that give access to your e-learning website “NFTacademy”. Since you’ve sold them as NFTs on a blockchain, these access rights are now tradable. This means that your community and active members will ultimately define their price on the secondary market. They define the amount of royalties you will earn in the long run (Remember: they technically own the NFTs, so they can sell them freely including all of the included perks).\n\n**In this case, our membership card is a key to the e-learning platform. Users can only connect to our exclusive member area if they own our “NFTacademy” NFT.**\n\nHowever, as the creator, you control the market/prices. You can mint new NFTs and reduce scarcity or you can improve your product so that the existing NFTs become more valuable. Or do both.\n\n1. If you mint new NFTs that provide access to your product/service you will make a quick buck, but by doing so reduce the price of the existing NFTs in circulation. Thus you may earn fewer royalties over time because there is less activity on the secondary market.\n2. If you decide to improve your actual product/service without new NFT memberships, you will earn more royalties over time (because demand will increase), but you won’t onboard new members.\n\nIt’s not trivial to predict what the best financial outcome for you will be. Your best bet will be determined by many factors, including your marketing strategy.\n\nIn the past months, we have seen many NFT projects rise on the internet. Prominent examples like the so-called “Profile Pic” Projects, eg. Cryptopunks, Bored Apes Yacht Club, Cool Cats, etc., or tons of artists who joined the hype train in 2021. A lot of innovation has happened in a very short time.\n\nUnfortunately, many of these projects were rushed to make a quick buck off the hype. So for most of these circulating NFTs:\\*\\* \\*\\*You cannot do anything tangible with them (not even sell them, because there is no market/ no demand), which at the end of the day makes them, sadly, quite useless.\n\n**The problem here is: many NFTs do not have any practical value.**\n\n**They lack the “web3” aspect. They lack authentication features. They lack a use-case.**\n\nNow what’s beautiful is that, because these NFTs live forever on the blockchain, **this use case can be constructed whenever by whomever.** So useless NFTs don’t need to stay useless forever.\n\nAt this stage we can sum things up:\n\n* Web3 wallets can be used to create online personas\n* EOAs (Externally owned accounts) are the backbone of a pseudonymous online society\n* NFTs turn anonymity into pseudonymity\n* Developers can attach a use-case to any NFT they like on this open “Item layer”\n* Businesses and creators can sell NFTs and add value to them as a business model\n* NFTs are tradable on a secondary market, the available use-cases influence their value\n* NFTs can be used to raise seed or VC funding as an alternative to platforms like Kickstarter\n\n## “Not your keys, not your data”\n\nNow you may still wonder: Why would I want a new authentication tool? Why should I bother?\n\n“I already have my Facebook Login”.\n\nA big problem you might be ignoring with existing centralized web2 login systems or rather centralized identifiers, in general, is that the users do not actually own the data they upload and the identifiers they use (eg. telephone numbers, email addresses, usernames on social media). On most existing web2 platforms it’s not possible for the individual user to actively control the flow of his/her data. This has not only led to many ethical and economic incidents in the past, for example when platforms did not take necessary security measures to protect user data from hacks or leaks, but it has also allowed Big Tech to accumulate an incredible amount of owned data. Data they can use to fuel their software products, most importantly their machine learning and big data algorithms. Furthermore said data is being used to sell targeted ads on centralized platforms, to the profit of some monopolistic, panoptic platforms.\n\nThese issues with centralization are also on the mind of the W3C. A week ago, a recommendation draft was released on the topic of so-called Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs): <https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/>\n\nNow it is important to understand that web3 wallets will by no means suddenly replace the existing identifier solutions. In fact, they don’t even want to (Proof of pseudonymity on web3 vs. Proof of identity on web2). However, they add a cryptographically secure, standardized, public, and open-source authentication layer on top. A layer that is pseudonymous. A layer that does not require government-issued identity cards, no telephone numbers for authentication, no clear name policy, and most importantly it has no need for a bank account or VISA card because payments are processed directly through the network (on every device anywhere in the world as long as you have free internet access).\n\nAs a result, over time, we might be able to make the world **a bit fairer** and **a bit more user-friendly** by collectively embracing cryptographically secure web3 wallets and the Non-Fungible Tokens that come with them. And who knows, maybe we might even be able to keep decent “freedom after speech” in most countries of the world.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## “NFTs as keys” have intrinsic value. They can unlock exclusive features, memberships, subscriptions, items, and more.\n\nThey allow developers to build a more secure web and more open/fair web.\n\nThey provide new marketing possibilities and fuel new community behavior for brands.\n\nThey extend simple authentication mechanisms of anonymous wallets and make these wallets pseudonymous.\n\nThey are the tool that will enable the pseudonymous economy.\n\nThey are tradable, immutable, economically interesting, cyberpunk, and in my opinion inevitable if we want to build a better, more sustainable, and freer internet.", "timestamp": 1633552946, "digest": "U3F2EbVuHXlujnrn4f3hunJDgUC53xgFUF27E9InAho", "contributor": "0x6871D1a603fEb9Cc2aA8213B9ab16B33e418cD8F"}

{"id": "FhsWK_3ouCagca0FQOVEbiChR6DhCLoXMdHSDFNWJZg", "title": "Introducing the FWB Fellowships Program", "body": "As we enter the fourth official season of Friends With Benefits, one of the primary questions we've been asking ourselves is: 'How do we increase accessibility to our community?’ As any group scales and evolves, there are many elements that need to be carefully balanced — what does being a member of the community mean, what are its values, and can they be preserved over time? Those questions become even more complicated in the realm of DAOs, where financial implications are often interwoven with what it means to belong.\n\nMany community members raised the need for clear on-ramps for creative individuals who lacked the financial resources necessary to buy tokens on the open market. A working group formed several months ago to address this, and has been working diligently to shape a new [FWB Fellowships Program](fwb.help/fellowships), utilizing a range of inputs: research and exploration of fellowships in other sectors, the lived experiences of members who have participated in fellowship programs as fine artists, and pressure-testing initial ideas against the novel realities of token incentives.\n\nA key consideration guiding the working group was ensuring that Fellows are able to realize the full value of their access to FWB. Fellows are not merely invited into the server to participate for a set period of time; provided that any Fellow satisfies the minimum requirements for participation, they will go on to receive a token grant that ensures their continued membership for the following season (i.e. their second).\n\nReinforcing that our Fellows are exceptional individuals who have earned full FWB membership, whose skin in the game is functionally no different than any other community member, is the cornerstone of our Fellowships program.\n\nA second important factor was making sure that Fellows would be given the support necessary to reinforce their engagement with the community. Diving into Discord headfirst, especially a particularly active community like ours, can be incredibly daunting for many; that is one of the reasons we’re launching the [FWB Benefactors Program](fwb.help/benefactors) in tandem. Community members can donate $FWB to help support the initiative’s goals, access a special channel for Fellows and Benefactors to interact within, and play an active role in mentorship and guiding the future of the Fellowships program.\n\nAccess without empowerment perpetuates inequitable ends, and a seat at the table is far more valuable because of the conversation and camaraderie it can create. By focusing the Fellowships program on creating impactful new relationships for incoming Fellows, we hope to model out how those who are most in need and warrant an opportunity to contribute to DAOs like FWB can be given the chance to do so in a way that is positive sum for everyone involved.\n\nIf you’re interested in applying for our Fellowships Program, please [click here](fwb.help/fellowships) .\n\nIf you're interested in supporting the Benefactor Program with an $FWB donation please [click here](fwb.help/benefactors).\n\nThis project was shipped by the the FWB Fellowships Working Group: A.Hooven, boreta, briiian, Gabe Q. , KD, kidhastings, Latasha, marksimbiotic, okjose, and Pat Lok with special thanks to Cooper, Patti, and Zhang.", "timestamp": 1633553761, "digest": "D-eDJcQbMxRGVBRVoEveWQx1efcr2iPkjjvcNr8X_gM", "contributor": "0x01503DC708ce3C55017194847A07aCb679D49f47"}
{"id": "DQTbz4qMbxhTyL_V4CpZrw0bW0NYajsrTXVfASimCVQ", "title": "Bored of Bored Apes, After Only A Week", "body": "Hey guys,\n\nJust wanna drop some quick thoughts about Bored Ape Yacht Club, after they sold out almost 2 weeks ago. This is my first time writing about NFTs, so this could be really short or it could be really long. I’m writing in a stream of consciousness and likely won’t do any editing besides spelling errors I catch as I’m going.\n\nFor those who have been under an NFT shaped rock, [Bored Ape Yacht Club](http://boredapeyachtclub.com/) is a generative avatar project (a la CryptoPunks, Hashmasks, Avastars, etc) that uses apes as it’s canvas. They released at .08Ξ, and per ape, saying that bonding curves are a Ponzi, so everyone could dig in and get one, relatively affordably. Many collectors went all in and got multiple and word on the street is that Pranksy got 1200 of the 10,000 released. I think they’re gonna end up in a NFTBox, which is a project he does where he puts a bunch of NFTs in a box (duh) for you to claim, kinda like if you were to get a subscription box. Some believe when that word got out, then people dove into BAYC.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcd06f2f-f3e2-4a41-a88f-a7c758d4e45d\\_631x631.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcd06f2f-f3e2-4a41-a88f-a7c758d4e45d\\_631x631.jpeg)\n\nWith any project like this, the key component to it’s success is community — and how it’s going to build and maintain said community. BAYC is the first avatar project that was affordable to artists since the NFT boom, but also had a great look. One thing that was super exciting to NFT artists at the very onset was that they have copyright and licensing rights for the specific apes that they owned. **This is where my main issue with the project stems. **I think opening the possibility for artists to create derivative NFT works using the BAYC avatars they owned in a sense oversaturated the space because SO MANY artists bought into them. This is the first time that NFT artists could afford to buy an avatar project since the NFT boom of 2021, so it’s to be expected they would be excited to participate, but honestly they overdid it. I’ve seen over 200 different derivative BAYC characters created by artists, ranging from throwing a filter on top of it to do a full scale 3D recreation, and without regard to whether the derivative works were good or bad, it was too much. Giving artists this level of freedom has the power to diminish the brand because now they’re in control of how we perceive it. That’s decentralization though, right?\n\n**What I love about BAYC**, and I hope other projects like this copy, is the strength of the community. Everyone who has an ape is so excited to be a part of the community. BAYC has what’s called The BAYC Bathroom where artists can write on the bathroom walls but only if they are owners of an BAYC ape. There’s also, of course a discord community for ape owners. There is a future as well that includes ape breeding to create further generations of apes, a merchandise store for members only, and it seems like games like treasure hunts with real world prizes like Apes & ETH.\n\nFor me, this opens the conversation of if giving up the copyright and licensing to a bunch of artists is the right move. Should they have the keys to possibly ruin perception of your project via what they create? Of course, they bought in so they have an interest in it going well, but well-meaning people fuck shit up every day. Every single day.\n\nAnyway thanks for joining me on my first NFT related piece. I have lots of thoughts so there’s a lot more to come.\n", "timestamp": 1633554183, "digest": "ZBwHPRlGfQeIG-B6KMturNg1nJRAYJdXeJQHY1nVMes", "contributor": "0xeD22Bb0106c24C7f6b4d8AAe33639e1467061F64"}

{"id": "zZU4JEbZfduVzO75hov5ERur4JvfztLoTqN5-2UZjjU", "title": "My Latest Attempt At NFT as a Rapper", "body": "Hey. Black Dave here. I’ve been thinking a lot about how someone like me, someone who makes music and other random non-music things could thrive in the NFT space…and I honestly haven’t come up with too many answers, but I’m constantly doing my best to think of ways to achieve that. The way visual art is valued and designed to be consumed is somewhat different than music, so finding ways to create value around a single musical thing, and have it continue to increase in said value is quite hard. For my next NFT drop, IO-002, I’m testing out a different concept than what I’ve been seeing a lot of music artists work with, which is to have a token that is redeemable for a verse from me.\n\nIf you’ve read this far and didn’t know, let me start by saying that I’m a producer/rapper/vocalist (but not like a singer but a screamer) who has been making music for many years, to not much success, despite my belief that I’m doing something sort of unique. I’m sure being open and honest about how I’ve been releasing music for 8 years and amassing around 25,000 streams isn’t something you’d expect to hear considering I’m trying to convince you that my future NFTs will be worth something, and you’re thinking “he’s kinda delusional” but I actually think one of my biggest setbacks is a lack of resources more than a lack of the other required abilities to succeed at what I’m doing. This is where the NFT comes in. Creating an NFT that is redeemable at any point in the future for a rap verse allows for someone to bet on me upfront and possibly receive a return on that in the back. If you’re to acquire this token, you’re able to either save it and trade it in for a verse in the future, or you’re able to sell and trade it on the secondary market, as my value as an artist or brand or whatever box you want to put me in. I think there are plenty of people who believe in me and what I do, or think that I’m smart or useful or talented or whatever word and this is an opportunity for those people to put their ETH where their mouth is. I hear more and more from NFT collectors that they are making effort to support artists they believe in as much as the art, and this is the sort of thing that could take an artist from point A to B. A to whichever letter.\n\nUsing NFT to continue to find ways to be able to support and invest in artists has been especially cool for me because with the existence of NFT, things are authenticated, transparent and public for everyone to see. I think about NFT as being like “oh yeah I liked that band when they were indie” but it’s verifiable on the blockchain, so you can show everyone know as opposed to go on eBay to try to find their demo and pay a ton of money to get it for your cool points.\n\nThanks for reading this stream of consciousness word dump. If you’ve made it THIS far, please support me on my next NFT drop, this Thursday July 22 at [blackdave.io](http://blackdave.io/)\n", "timestamp": 1633556635, "digest": "dCJ0Xw3Zm1lT347txZKqLSjWpTb7gOpISG8K0_5LQ-k", "contributor": "0xeD22Bb0106c24C7f6b4d8AAe33639e1467061F64"}

It presents a new world full of endless opportunities with almost everything yet to be built. \n\nThose who more intimately know me are beginning to see my POV on the space and I’m excited to make it more public in the coming months the work we are doing to help lay some of the crypto groundwork that we believe is needed.  \n\nThis new wave called Web3 is just shaping up but the last year has shown me, and so many others, the flaws in ownership, distribution and monetization. It also reminds me of Kevin Kelly of Wired Mag’s “the true 1,000 fans,” which many have gotten away from. \n\n[https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2019/04/the-truth-behind-the-1000-true-fan-theory.html](https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2019/04/the-truth-behind-the-1000-true-fan-theory.html)\n\nJust look at the NFT communities that have just been built. Fans clamoring towards a north star. In some cases, those fans governing the IP/Asset and community through a [DAO](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/what-is-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work). I’m encouraged by the creativity in both the technology and arts industry. Not a day goes by that we don’t see new applications, communities, art projects or platforms. \n\nTo take a step back, I’m a big fan of this platform, it’s features, and like so many, had the belief that publishing and ownership needed to grow up. \n\nI was a fan of Substack and its DTC implications for the future and encouraged by their recent move into Hollywood fandom. If you are new to that platform, here’s a recent article on them and some of their new writers: \n\n> To hear Tynion tell it — which he did, on Substack — the writer had a choice: Sign a new three-year exclusive contract with DC or a contract with the San Francisco-based platform. “I remember sending it to my lawyer asking if it could be real because it was exactly the kind of offer I was dreaming would fall out of the sky and into my lap,” he wrote of Substack’s offer. \n>\n> [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/substack-marvel-dc-comics-writers-1235009529/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/substack-marvel-dc-comics-writers-1235009529/)\n\n\n### Now back to what’s on my mind today….\n\nWeb3 is moving faster than the speed of culture. More communities are developing, projects being designed and launching at record pace. \n\nMarketing will need to transform itself once again. \n\nFirst digital was separated, then social, then social and digital were combined, then everyone realized IT played a part in it, then e-commerce, then community management, creators and influencers, media and paid and sprinkled over everything was data. \n\nWe live in an inter-connected marketing world where everything is centered around community and the tools needed to manage, ignite, incubate and grow while finding the commerce balance. \n\nSo marketers…..I leave you with this, where does crypto fit into your organization? How are you defining crypto assets? What role does it play? It will look different for each company as we all evolve together.

{"id": "f3TbfHekosBAnbNbbvWTcksj0ejmXJN3wKyeJwDJunM", "title": "...In the Wake of the Tory Lanez NFT...", "body": "Hey guys, Black Dave here with some more rap music NFT talk. I was going to write about some of my thoughts following my recent NFT drop, the auction is still available for bidding until August 15th at 12 Eastern, but decided that sincethis Tory Lanez NFT did so well, I’ll give a set of thoughts. Let’s get started:\n\nFor starters, I’ll explain the NFT release: Tory released an NFT that allows for access for you to stream his album. The token is not a token that has the music attached to it, but is a token that grants access to a streaming platform that allows you to play the music. It’s not for download. It’s not for sale anywhere else from what I can tell. He released a million editions of it at $1 a piece. He sold out in 57 seconds. The project was released through a company called Emmersive, which is co-owned by Flo Rida & dropped on a platform called E-NFT, which I suppose will allow for more drops like this in the future. Because this drop was such a success, there are a lot of people who aren’t quite sure of what NFTs are and the culture of NFTs popping up…but they’re people from the culture (if you don’t know what that means then you might not be a part of it). I think this could be an interesting turning point in the culture of NFTs. Now people want to know how they can use it as an artist. Now people want to know what this is all about. Hello new people. NFTs are confusing at first, take your time.\n\nWhen it comes to Tory’s success, let’s talk about why it worked for him and why it may not work for you, or for your favorite rapper. The first is **NFTs aside, Tory created a near frictionless method of acquisition** for the token. No wallet needed (even though I recommend this method) or anything. Making it easy to get an NFT is one of the main things keeping the general public away from them. The other thing that works for him, and will work for the benefit of a lot of people that read this is **when you’re an independent artist, NFTs are easy**. When there’s no one between you and your audience, and there are no contracts and people to pay along the way things become easy. Our favorite artists’ label situations don’t allow for that. One thing I’ve seen thus far when it comes to rap NFT drops is that almost all of them don’t include music. Lil Yachty didn’t. A$AP Rocky didn’t. Lupe Fiasco Didn’t. Eminem didn’t. Another thing that helped Tory in this situation is that he has a fanbase that is willing to go the extra mile to get his work. **When you have a fanbase that is willing to do the work to move to a new platforms, you can win in NFT.** If your fanbase is overall pretty casual, they won’t do the extra work to get to you. NFTs are for your higher level fans, and when you have a large fanbase, it can be done. If you don’t have a hungry fanbase like his, then you’ll be better off embedding yourself in the NFT community, like me, and finding success there. Be honest with yourself about this so you don’t waste energy and resources. People will eventually make their way to NFTs and it may be a waste of energy to try to push it on them before they’re ready.\n\nWithout regard to how I may feel about Tory Lanez or his music or any of that, I think this is a big deal in the continued movement of music finding it’s way & place in the NFT space. I think token gated access to music is one of the things we all dreamed about in this space, and while this isn’t the most graceful method that will exist, this is an amazing start. Let’s see if he participates in NFT fully or if he only shows up when it’s time to make money…\n", "timestamp": 1633556858, "digest": "U_-Z5YsbnVqCDDxUQkaEb7wr4Ov3hP_BIFhSI447iAI", "contributor": "0xeD22Bb0106c24C7f6b4d8AAe33639e1467061F64"}

October 6th marks the one year anniversary of the Index Coop’s founding. During Index Coop’s first year, the decentralized organization has gone from a nascent organization to a fully-fledged DAO. We have achieved significant growth in both the adoption of our products and the size and capability of our community.\n\n**A few highlights include:** \n\n* Index Coop has Launched market-leading index products:\n  * DeFi Pulse Index, DPI\n  * Coinshares Gold and Cryptoasset Index, CGI\n  * Flexible Leverage Index Series, FLI\n  * Metaverse Index, MVI\n  * Bankless BED Index, BED\n  * Data Economy Index, DATA\n* Loyal customers have [purchased $327 million](https://dune.xyz/anthonybowman/Index:-Net-Inflows-Monitoring) worth of those products.\n* Index Coop has earned [$1.7 million in revenue](https://dune.xyz/jdcook/Index-Coop-Revenue).\n* The Coop has experienced massive organizational growth: 6,000+ Discord members, including hundreds of part and full-time contributors.\n\nIn honor of this auspicious occasion, let’s take a look back at the key moments from the past year.\n\n\n---\n\n## 🎃 October 2020\n\n**Index Coop Launched**\n\n[Index Coop Launches](https://medium.com/indexcoop/introducing-the-index-cooperative-a4eaaf0bcfe2)\n\nOctober 6th marked the birth of the Index Cooperative. Leaders at [Set Protocol](https://www.tokensets.com/) and [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/) formed the community around the INDEX token.\n\nThe mission was to make cryptocurrency and DeFi investing simple, accessible, and safe for everyone. Our flagship product was the [DeFi Pulse Index (DPI)](https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi).\n\n**DPI Liquidity Mining**\n\n[DPI Liquidity Mining](https://medium.com/indexcoop/index-liquidity-mining-is-now-live-5446db9df38e)\n\nWithin days of launching the Index Cooperative, the team formulated a plan to jumpstart DEX liquidity with a liquidity mining program. Sufficient liquidity for users to comfortably on and off-board was a critical component of the product’s potential for success.\n\nThe Index Coop gave 9% of INDEX supply to an early community of supporters who provided liquidity on Uniswap. That liquidity—and the notional value of DPI’s assets under management—quickly exceeded $20 million.\n\n**The Index Cooperative Secret Master Plan**\n\n[The Index Cooperative Secret Master Plan](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/the-index-cooperative-secret-master-plan-edit-1/130)\n\nOnce we had a product that had captured the attention of the market, we needed  to map out the Index Coop vision. In the prescient words of Set Labs’ CEO [Felix Feng](https://twitter.com/felix2feng):\n\n> *Step 1: Focus on getting a single index to scale (1% of the DeFi market and majority held by sustainable holders).*\n>\n> *Step 2: With the connections, brand, and marketing from the first success, launch additional indices that achieve scale and are leaders in their respective verticals. If we get one index listed on a centralized exchange and adopted by distribution partners, it will be significantly easier to sell the rest.*\n>\n> *Step 3: After achieving high market share in each category, focus on long-term Index Coop sustainability - enjoying the benefits of market leadership.*\n\n\n---\n\n## 🦃 November 2020\n\n**First Contributor Rewards Paid**\n\n[First Contributor Rewards Paid](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/october-rewards-distribution-methodology/262)\n\nThe initial remuneration for contributors became a landmark moment, as early members of the Coop were granted an ownership interest in the protocol. This fluid exchange of ownership for labor represents an exciting new convention for Web3 communities.\n\n**An Expanded Vision of Index Coop**\n\n[An Expanded Vision of Index Coop](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/an-expanded-vision-of-index-coop/358)\n\nAs the Index Coop began to grow into a market leadership position for crypto indices, the opportunity became more clear. As Felix wrote in his expanded vision of the Coop:\n\n> *If one takes a magnifying glass and looks at the ETP landscape in terms of volume, the landscape of products is much broader than indices. In fact, it’s just the tip of the iceberg.*\n\n\n---\n\n## ☃️ December 2020\n\n**Liquidity Mining Program Shrinks**\n\n[Liquidity Mining Program Shrinks](https://medium.com/indexcoop/index-liquidity-mining-update-32b21274fc88)\n\nA critical early juncture in the Index Cooperative community was the heavy reduction in rewards for providing liquidity to our sole product, DPI. The untested prospect of lowering incentives to support DPI liquidity produced as much anxiety as the prospect of continuing to allocate so much of the total supply of INDEX to the reward program.\n\nHowever, led by [OverAnalyser](https://twitter.com/AnalyserOver), the Index Coop struck a compromise and agreed to continue incentives, but with a significantly reduced reward program. The arrangement worked, as DPI was able to maintain category-leading liquidity while paying much less for it.\n\n**Creative Challenge**\n\n[Creative Challenge](https://medium.com/indexcoop/the-index-creative-challenge-15-000-in-prizes-53507128535b)\n\nThe Index Coop creative challenge prompted makers of all types to submit a smorgasbord of Index Coop-related content and art (with a shot at winning $15k in prizes!). Among the [winners](https://medium.com/indexcoop/announcing-the-creative-challenge-winners-1d38b71941f): an NFT, a cake, and several videos. The grand prize went to [Thomas Hepner](https://twitter.com/thomas_hepner) for his [memo](https://twitter.com/thomas_hepner/status/1345469880804417537) on investing in Index Coop and IC products.\n\n\n---\n\n## ⛷️ January 2021\n\n**First Working Group Established**\n\n[First Working Group Established](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/launching-a-growth-working-group/602)\n\nIn early January, the first bottom-up organizational structure emerged from the Index Coop community in the form of Working Groups. This structure was developed to allow for more nimble resource allocation to growth experiments and incubated some of the most impactful functions in today’s organization.\n\n**Milestone:** $100m AUM\n\n[https://twitter.com/indexcoop/status/1357124277514850306](https://twitter.com/indexcoop/status/1357124277514850306)\n\n**A Proposed Product Philosophy**\n\n[A Proposed Product Philosophy](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/a-proposed-product-philosophy/724/6)\n\nAs we began to develop the infrastructure for launching products more rapidly, [Punia](https://twitter.com/puniaviision)—a contributor to Index Coop’s product group—sought to define a more structured philosophy for product development, positing that we should:\n\n> *...consider deeply the eventual end users: a middle aged factory worker saving for retirement, a father investing in a college fund, and the young woman daring to make a bet against the status quo.

October 6th marks the one year anniversary of the Index Coop’s founding. During Index Coop’s first year, the decentralized organization has gone from a nascent organization to a fully-fledged DAO. We have achieved significant growth in both the adoption of our products and the size and capability of our community.\n\n**A few highlights include:** \n\n* Index Coop has Launched market-leading index products:\n  * DeFi Pulse Index, DPI\n  * Coinshares Gold and Cryptoasset Index, CGI\n  * Flexible Leverage Index Series, FLI\n  * Metaverse Index, MVI\n  * Bankless BED Index, BED\n  * Data Economy Index, DATA\n* Loyal customers have [purchased $327 million](https://dune.xyz/anthonybowman/Index:-Net-Inflows-Monitoring) worth of those products.\n* Index Coop has earned [$1.7 million in revenue](https://dune.xyz/jdcook/Index-Coop-Revenue).\n* The Coop has experienced massive organizational growth: 6,000+ Discord members, including hundreds of part and full-time contributors.\n\nIn honor of this auspicious occasion, let’s take a look back at the key moments from the past year.\n\n\n---\n\n## 🎃 October 2020\n\n**Index Coop Launched**\n\n[Index Coop Launches](https://medium.com/indexcoop/introducing-the-index-cooperative-a4eaaf0bcfe2)\n\nOctober 6th marked the birth of the Index Cooperative. Leaders at [Set Protocol](https://www.tokensets.com/) and [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/) formed the community around the INDEX token.\n\nThe mission was to make cryptocurrency and DeFi investing simple, accessible, and safe for everyone. Our flagship product was the [DeFi Pulse Index (DPI)](https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi).\n\n**DPI Liquidity Mining**\n\n[DPI Liquidity Mining](https://medium.com/indexcoop/index-liquidity-mining-is-now-live-5446db9df38e)\n\nWithin days of launching the Index Cooperative, the team formulated a plan to jumpstart DEX liquidity with a liquidity mining program. Sufficient liquidity for users to comfortably on and off-board was a critical component of the product’s potential for success.\n\nThe Index Coop gave 9% of INDEX supply to an early community of supporters who provided liquidity on Uniswap. That liquidity—and the notional value of DPI’s assets under management—quickly exceeded $20 million.\n\n**The Index Cooperative Secret Master Plan**\n\n[The Index Cooperative Secret Master Plan](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/the-index-cooperative-secret-master-plan-edit-1/130)\n\nOnce we had a product that had captured the attention of the market, we needed  to map out the Index Coop vision. In the prescient words of Set Labs’ CEO [Felix Feng](https://twitter.com/felix2feng):\n\n> *Step 1: Focus on getting a single index to scale (1% of the DeFi market and majority held by sustainable holders).*\n>\n> *Step 2: With the connections, brand, and marketing from the first success, launch additional indices that achieve scale and are leaders in their respective verticals. If we get one index listed on a centralized exchange and adopted by distribution partners, it will be significantly easier to sell the rest.*\n>\n> *Step 3: After achieving high market share in each category, focus on long-term Index Coop sustainability - enjoying the benefits of market leadership.*\n\n\n---\n\n## 🦃 November 2020\n\n**First Contributor Rewards Paid**\n\n[First Contributor Rewards Paid](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/october-rewards-distribution-methodology/262)\n\nThe initial remuneration for contributors became a landmark moment, as early members of the Coop were granted an ownership interest in the protocol. This fluid exchange of ownership for labor represents an exciting new convention for Web3 communities.\n\n**An Expanded Vision of Index Coop**\n\n[An Expanded Vision of Index Coop](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/an-expanded-vision-of-index-coop/358)\n\nAs the Index Coop began to grow into a market leadership position for crypto indices, the opportunity became more clear. As Felix wrote in his expanded vision of the Coop:\n\n> *If one takes a magnifying glass and looks at the ETP landscape in terms of volume, the landscape of products is much broader than indices. In fact, it’s just the tip of the iceberg.*\n\n\n---\n\n## ☃️ December 2020\n\n**Liquidity Mining Program Shrinks**\n\n[Liquidity Mining Program Shrinks](https://medium.com/indexcoop/index-liquidity-mining-update-32b21274fc88)\n\nA critical early juncture in the Index Cooperative community was the heavy reduction in rewards for providing liquidity to our sole product, DPI. The untested prospect of lowering incentives to support DPI liquidity produced as much anxiety as the prospect of continuing to allocate so much of the total supply of INDEX to the reward program.\n\nHowever, led by [OverAnalyser](https://twitter.com/AnalyserOver), the Index Coop struck a compromise and agreed to continue incentives, but with a significantly reduced reward program. The arrangement worked, as DPI was able to maintain category-leading liquidity while paying much less for it.\n\n**Creative Challenge**\n\n[Creative Challenge](https://medium.com/indexcoop/the-index-creative-challenge-15-000-in-prizes-53507128535b)\n\nThe Index Coop creative challenge prompted makers of all types to submit a smorgasbord of Index Coop-related content and art (with a shot at winning $15k in prizes!). Among the [winners](https://medium.com/indexcoop/announcing-the-creative-challenge-winners-1d38b71941f): an NFT, a cake, and several videos. The grand prize went to [Thomas Hepner](https://twitter.com/thomas_hepner) for his [memo](https://twitter.com/thomas_hepner/status/1345469880804417537) on investing in Index Coop and IC products.\n\n\n---\n\n## ⛷️ January 2021\n\n**First Working Group Established**\n\n[First Working Group Established](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/launching-a-growth-working-group/602)\n\nIn early January, the first bottom-up organizational structure emerged from the Index Coop community in the form of Working Groups. This structure was developed to allow for more nimble resource allocation to growth experiments and incubated some of the most impactful functions in today’s organization.\n\n**Milestone:** $100m AUM\n\n[https://twitter.com/indexcoop/status/1357124277514850306](https://twitter.com/indexcoop/status/1357124277514850306)\n\n**A Proposed Product Philosophy**\n\n[A Proposed Product Philosophy](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/a-proposed-product-philosophy/724/6)\n\nAs we began to develop the infrastructure for launching products more rapidly, [Punia](https://twitter.com/puniaviision)—a contributor to Index Coop’s product group—sought to define a more structured philosophy for product development, positing that we should:\n\n> *...consider deeply the eventual end users: a middle aged factory worker saving for retirement, a father investing in a college fund, and the young woman daring to make a bet against the status quo. If we do our jobs right, we will greatly accelerate the pace at which DeFi is adopted and make a dent in the financial future of our world.*\n\n\n---\n\n## 🌺 February 2021\n\n**First Core Contributors**\n\n[First Core Contributors](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-36-full-time-contributor-retention/1021)\n\nSeveral months after the launch of Index Cooperative, the first nominations for core contributors were put forward.

{"id": "P1rbNS2P9MsXBm04zDuLpGgYCpvODrxp13iEwaLCUVY", "title": "Notes", "body": "When I first discovered Mirror I thought it was a fascinating exploration of the web 3.0 design space. With crowdfunds, NFTs, and cool features built into the user experience thanks to Ethereum’s general purpose programmability, Mirror could be the end game in online publishing, replacing Medium and Substack with a superior product suite, owned by its community of writers and readers, allowing both to share in wealth creation in unprecedented ways. \n\nCrowdfunding is what enables change. We can’t rely on governments to. \n\nI ilterally can’t\n\nAnonymous crowdfunding. \n\nWriting competitions? \n\nAs founder Graeme says, “Social forums like Mirror can use ownership verification to legitimize an account's voice within these communities, producing social capital for a pseudonymous avatar - without revealing the identity of the owner. This allows anonymous individuals to reliably coordinate, transact, and advance group values - an innovation in global collective action. \n\nFrom the first article I read, I was itching to write on the platform and try out some of the new features. That’s already a good sign. But Mirror kept me waiting. They did something smart, they only allowed a small number of contributors to initially write for the platform - rewarding them with a token called $WRITE that could be cast as a vote for the next 10 members on the platform. This approach maintained quality and stoked demand for access. The uses of $WRITE token by its community will be governed by its culture and value system which is still taking shape. \n\nThis is why it's been so important for Mirror to go slow with onboarding, and to try its best to diversify its membership. We've received some criticism for this, but ultimately this will enable true decentralized ownership. If we can accelerate membership over time while maintaining integrity, then we can create universal ownership drips that enable hard-to-fake, true decentralization.\n\nThe plot twist is that this is already happening, but nobody has noticed it yet. So, stay tuned.\n\nAs the platform grew I tried to access it and was forced to authenticate by tweeting a prepared message created by the Mirror team. I did this several times and was unable to access the Mirror platform. To be able to just connect freely with your metamask and start writing. This is the key. \n\nFinal note: Financial contributors and developers should be rewarded, too. But the distribution algorithm needs to keep this in check so that it can't be gamed, and that it's set up to allow for long-term rewards, and doesn't just enrich the early contributors. We want to make a new and better world through decentralized ownership, and that means we have to steer clear of the old patterns where early contributors and adopters get too much.”\n\nMirror is open-source. Meaning that different communities can have different. \n\nHow do you really know that other platforms aren’t recording everything you write and a backdoor for government surveillance? People can really come together with this technology and share. It’s the most important platform ever created. A truly censorship resistant marketplace of ideas. The digital printing press of the 21st century. \n\nI think using crowdfunds and NFTs to promote certain behaviors within a publisher’s community will create some of the most productive redistributions of wealth in history. I don’t know what those applications / behaviors are yet but they are coming and they will be financially irresistible to Medium and Substack influencers.\n\nI’ve been studying tokenomics and it seems somewhat untenable. Due to US securities regulations, projects are being forced to withhold incredible wealth from their US users. You need to indemnify U.S. citizens from blocking access to the dy/dx airdrop. There’s a ton of people in the U.S. who missed out on the token. That’s how hard you have to bet on the market. \n\nYour most precious resource is time. That’s why I want to help you navigate the world of crypto opportunities. \n\n a freer market for ideas and crushed the church.\n\nMirror is the most free market for ideas and is censorship resistant.\n\nI would buy $Write Tokens. The demand for ownership in this asset class is based on VCs who are locking value in certain projects. It’s hard to really trust the valuations because rugs happen. Anything can be rugged. \n\nCore values - before you let companies sponsor you\n\nI like that", "timestamp": 1633558435, "digest": "CIpjhlcCOyW2tnzWQHIwFVaSxrItStxFpb-IQTGjDCg", "contributor": "0x7b769566882Df5c3B7f2c7985ff3B328c17418F4"}

{"id": "5OhKig97kBNp-ZeJ2J5f0QP2sPVvPDJVmWenaO4SV8Y", "title": "Blockchain Gaming: Moving from ‘Play to Earn’ to Actual Innovation", "body": "“Play To Earn” has been on investors’ minds over the last few months; there’s been a lot of tweets and posts about it, especially highlighting that players in the Philippines are making money by playing “Axie Infinity”. This may sound groundbreaking to newcomers in the gaming space, but this behavior has existed for a long time, going back to the early days of World of Warcraft in the early 2000s. After spending 15+ years playing video games competitively, I started categorizing economies formed around games in three ways: time-based, skill-based, and loot-based.\n\nTo set the stage for the size of the opportunity, Fortnite generated $3.6B of digital sales revenue in 2020, all being cosmetic items. FIFA Ultimate Team raked in $1.62B from players buying packs of cards and in-game currency. $2.6M was spent on the Counter-Strike marketplace in the last 24 hours. I believe all three types of economies could get 10-100x larger by moving away from shady middleware websites and moving to a decentralized platform instead. This could unlock 10s of billions of dollars of value for players and users to capture, rather than having it all go to the publisher. This is why it’ll be hard to see incumbents transition to these models, and it’d probably come from new games instead.\n\nOne core piece of infrastructure that makes a lot of this possible is the fact that in a blockchain-based world, NFTs can be used as a payment system rather than using fiat since they can be eventually be turned back into currency. This allows players to easily move across games, trading and exchanging items with other players who also want to try things out. They could also simply liquidate their inventory in a marketplace for real money, which is impossible in most traditional games. Increasing how easily items can be transacted will both increase their value, as well as making it easier for players to try out other games as they won’t feel “locked-in” to certain ones.\n\n## Time-based economies\n\nTime-based economies are usually found in games where it takes a long time to unlock certain items or abilities, even though it’s not very hard to do skill-wise. MMORPGs that monetize through monthly subscriptions are a good example of this, as they want to make sure players spend a lot of time online. Buyers in these economies are usually paying to not spend time doing certain in-game tasks that might feel tedious, and would rather get to the endgame activities. Sellers are usually located in low-cost geographies that make it profitable to get paid \\~$5-10/hour to play a video game.\n\nFor example, in World of Warcraft it takes a while to level up your character to the max level, which gives you access to better equipment, spells, new raids, etc. Over the years, a lot of “boosting communities” and sites popped up, which let you pay someone to play your character up to a certain level. The same is possible to get additional “gold”, the in-game currency of the game, or specific in-game items such as rare mounts. In 2014, 10 years after the game's release, Blizzard started offering a “Character Boost” in their store, which brings your new character to the maximum level by paying \\~$60, but they still don’t allow players to pay for items or gold.\n\n**What limits time-based economies today:**\n\n* **Lack of unified listings:** There’s no official marketplace to buy these services, which hurts both supply and demand. As a buyer, I have to search online and sort through a lot of sketchy-looking websites, going on sites like Reddit to see if people used them before, etc. It’s very easy to get scammed. As a provider, I have to stand up my own website, put a payment system in place, work on my SEO to rank highly on the homepage, etc, which might not be worth it if I only plan to do this irregularly.\n* **No guarantees:** given that this is an agreement made outside of the game rules, there’s no guarantee that the service will actually be completed once you pay. \n* **Security risk:** most of these activities require you to share your login information with the 3rd party. This is obviously a big security risk, as they could take over your account. \n\n**What the blockchain can enable:**\n\n* **Decentralized “bounty” marketplace:** using smart contracts, you could create binding agreements between both parties of the marketplace. This would allow anyone to participate as a seller by removing the reputation and marketing barrier; this would also eventually lower the cost as supply grows. By tying into the game directly, the marketplace can resolve the contract and issue payment once pre-determined criterias are met (i.e. completed this raid, this item entered the player’s inventory, etc). This would be a gaming version of [Gitcoin Bounties](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?network=mainnet&idx_status=open&applicants=ALL&order_by=null) basically. \n* **Tokenized characters:** rather than sharing your account credentials, blockchain-based games could have each character in an account be its own tokenized asset. This means that I could share the character for a limited amount of time with another account, and then automatically take it back. [reNFT](https://www.renft.io/) is an example of what that might look like. This would also work well with trading card games, allowing players to rent decks in Hearthstone or Magic The Gathering.\n\n## Skill-based economies\n\nSkill-based economies are found in games with high skill caps. They usually have some items that can only be unlocked by completing a very high difficulty quest, or rank very highly in a competitive ladder setting. The supply side of these economies is harder to scale, and has higher variability in quality.   \n\nIn Halo 3 for example, players could earn the “Recon” armor by completing the “Vidmaster Challenges'', which were pretty difficult achievements. Some of them required users to do co-op missions at high difficulty, and players could pay for other experienced people to play with them and guide them through it. This is true in other games like WoW, Destiny 2, etc where groups usually have a “raid leader” that knows the ins and outs of the specific raid and can help new players navigate them. It can cost $1,000-4,000 for a Mythic raid carry in World of Warcraft. \n\nSkill-based economies share similar challenges to time-based ones such as lack of unified listings and guarantees, but also have additional issues.\n\n**What limits skill-based economies today:**\n\n* **Lack of credentials:** unlike time-based economies activities, the ones covered here require players to be fairly skilled at the game. There’s currently no easy way to verify that a player is actually capable of completing a task.  \n\n**What the blockchain can enable:**\n\n* **Cross-game “skill” rating:** as players move from one game to the other, their progress should carry across given that it’s all on-chain. This can allow them to skip introductory levels and jump straight to their level of play. This will make it more fun for players to jump across games. [ArcX](https://arcx.money/) is building the equivalent of this for credit.\n* **Publisher-sponsored tutorials:** as a game publisher, I could set up a system that gives new players X amount of credit to post bounties on the marketplace, effectively letting them pay for “training” sessions from experienced players. This benefits the game publisher because 1) it will make sure players are more easily onboarded and stay long term 2) gives incentives to experienced players to stick around long term. [RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg/) is the closest example in non-gaming use cases. \n\n## Loot-based economies \n\nVideogame skins are the OG NFTs. You pay a bunch of money to look cool online, but they don’t actually have any intrinsic value. Players usually receive a “crate” or “loot box” from the game, and they can buy a key to open it for like \\~$3-5 and get 1-3 random skins. Skins give 0 in-game advantage, they are purely cosmetic. These markets are purely driven by scarcity and demand; you won’t find expensive items in a game that isn’t widely popular. \n\nCounter-Strike had a peak of 747,598 players in the last 24 hours. In that time span, \\~$2.6M of skins were transacted in the official Counter-Strike skins marketplace. This doesn’t include all third-party marketplaces and liquidity providers, so the real number is probably higher than that. Players can freely transact in this marketplace by selling or buying skins, but they can never take the money out of it; they can only spend their profits on other skins, or in the Steam marketplace (Counter Strike’s publisher) to buy other video games. If you want real money for them, you have to use 3rd party websites such as [BitSkins](https://bitskins.com/), [Gameflip](https://gameflip.com/), etc.\n\nThis isn’t limited to just cosmetic items, but also to fungible ones. Take FIFA Ultimate Team, Electronic Arts’ football simulation videogame. The game has a marketplace where users can buy cards that represent specific soccer players to put in their virtual team; they can then use them to play games. More expensive players are usually better, so the price is driven by in-game ability, not just aesthetics. Similarly, players can use fiat money to buy packs of cards or marketplace currency, but they are never able to convert it back into fiat and can only spend it in-game. Electronic Arts made $1.62B from Ultimate Team sales last year. \n\nWhere loot-based economies can go wrong is when acquiring the items makes the game too easy to complete, and therefore leads players to churn quickly. Diablo III is a good example of this; at launch, Blizzard included a marketplace where players could buy items with real money. Once you acquire the best items in Diablo, the gameplay isn’t very deep, as most of the gameplay is actually repeating runs to find better loot. Blizzard shut down the marketplace shortly after launch and revamped the system to remove all player-to-player transactions. This is a good example of a time-based economy being treated as a loot-based economy; since the time spent to acquire items is the game itself, creating a marketplace is actually detrimental to the experience of the players. \n\n**What limits loot-based economies today:**\n\n* **Lack of withdrawal options:** today you can invest money in these items, but it’s very challenging to get the money back out without going through unauthorized websites. This prevents a lot of players from buying more expensive items, as they might not be committed to playing the game for a long time. This is the opposite of a marketplace like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) which allows you to leave at any time.\n* **Lack of clarity around rarity and drop rate:** in traditional games, it’s impossible to verify the rarity of certain items, or how often they get awarded from loot boxes. This makes it difficult to properly price items.\n\n**What the blockchain can enable:**\n\n* **Easy access to liquidity:** a crypto game without a cash-out feature will not be supported by the community. Even if it happened, it’d be somewhat easy for a trusted marketplace to be built in order to allow players to sell their items for money in a trustless manner.\n* **Full visibility into real rarity:** each item in a blockchain-based game will have all metadata public, and users will be able to compare all of them. [Rarity Sniper](https://twitter.com/RaritySniperNFT) already offers this for NFT collections, and the same use case will be applicable to gaming as well.\n\n## Let the games begin\n\nWhile we’ve seen early experimentation in blockchain games with Axie Infinity, Gods Unchained, Parallel, etc we haven’t even scratched the surface. First of all, the most popular video game types aren’t available; there’s no high quality shooter or MOBA game with a blockchain component. Trading card games and autobattlers are pretty niche genres. On top of that, onboarding players into sidechains like Ronin is cumbersome and expensive due to gas fees.\n\nTraditional game publishers are limited in what they can do due to regulation, as well as existing contracts with brand sponsors (see Fortnite and their Marvel partnership, for example) that cannot be easily translated to a fluid marketplace. There will likely be new game publishers rise in the crypto space, which will develop the game and engage the community in very different ways. I’m really looking forward to seeing all the innovation in this space, both as an investor and as a gamer!\n\nIf you are building anything related to what I mentioned in the article, please do reach out!

{"id": "bVljUz9sBDMSeKgiWQWOX_uUQCDX2SP2NQkjUw8VylM", "title": "DAOs as University Replacements: A Thought Experiment", "body": "*Originally published on [Substack](https://kassen.substack.com/p/daos-as-university-replacements-a) on September 9th, 2021.*\n\nI came back to senior year of college this fall after a year and a half of being away from campus, and many aspects of the university experience that I used to think were normal are now hitting me in the face. *Why do things have to be this way?*\n\nI’m certainly not the first person to point out flaws in higher education institutions, but it just feels so *weird* to be back after being away from this ecosystem. During my time away from school, I gained more exposure to the tech industry, learned a lot more about the startup ecosystem, met really interesting people building in and around startups, and most recently, fell down the crypto rabbit hole. (Quick aside: Crypto Twitter is nuts. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced such electric energy in my 15-year lifetime on the Internet, and I’m so so lucky to be able to participate in it and watch it all unfold.)\n\nAnyway, I came across [Brian Flynn’s tweet](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1424438867319422977?s=20) about a month ago, and it’s been floating around in the back of my head for a little while.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1424438867319422977?s=20](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1424438867319422977?s=20)\n\nIt got me thinking...can DAOs really replace universities in terms of the student experience? What would that look like? What would be mimicked vs. improved?\n\nThis piece is a thought exercise into those questions.\n\n## A Breakdown of the University Experience\n\nA quick disclaimer: This is “university” informed heavily by my own perspective as an American undergrad at Duke University interested in tech. University experiences vary quite a lot, and people attend for many different reasons. I will try to capture the most common ones.\n\nBelow are the bare-bones components of what I believe is the value proposition of attending a higher education institution:\n\n* Credentials\n* Social life\n* Path toward professional “success”\n* Education\n\nOutside of these four categories, there are some other aspects of universities that I think would be worth touching on:\n\n* Admissions\n* Cost\n* Length of time spent at the institution\n\nOf course, there are many other characteristics of universities that lie outside of the above, such as tiered meal plans. In my opinion, these are not the most integral parts of the university experience and don’t necessarily need a web3 parallel.\n\nBefore we dive in, let’s address the fundamental difference between a university and a DAO: one is highly centralized, and the other is decentralized.\n\n## The Nature of a DAO\n\nA DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, which means the rules by which it operates as well as its financial transactions are recorded on the blockchain for anyone to see. There are many different types of DAOs (financial, social, etc.), but the common thread is that there is no central governing entity of the organization that makes decisions for everyone. Instead, community members drive governance through democratic processes.\n\nIn my opinion, the most significant aspect of DAOs is that they allow us to **re-imagine incentive structures** within organizations. This is especially interesting when it comes to the university, an incredibly complex organization with a high number of different stakeholders (students, parents, teaching faculty, administration + board of trustees, non-faculty employees, etc.), all with their own set of incentives. Universities are very top-down, whereas DAOs are very bottom-up.\n\nA lot of companies are trying to unbundle the college experience—how could DAOs unbundle and “re-bundle” in a better way?\n\n## DAOs as University Replacements\n\n### Credentials\n\n*How can this organization act as an indicator of an individual’s qualifications?*\n\nWhen you are admitted to and attend a university, you are now associated with its brand name, which offers you the credentials of being someone intelligent, driven, and accomplished, amongst other traits. The more selective and well-known the university is, the more you are set apart from the masses, and the stronger this credentialing is. These credentials give you [status](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/signaling-on-the-internet), the more of which you accrue, the more levers you can pull with it (social, political, professional, etc). Status is one of the only (and strongest) things aligning the differing incentives of university stakeholders.\n\nIn a web3 world, there is nothing really preventing a similar status hierarchy from emerging—there will be DAOs that are more gated than others and DAOs that are more elite and desirable than others. Status signaling is inherent to human nature, and as is our correlation between exclusivity and desirability. In this sense, the web3 equivalent of university credentialing would look pretty much the same (being a part of certain DAOs gives you more credibility).\n\nHowever, if we are optimizing for “true” credentialing, this is something that is best done in web3 due to more transparency and meritocracy. If everything you do to contribute to the DAO’s community (running interest-based clubs, conducting peer learning workshops, etc.) is recorded on-chain, it’s very easy for your peers (or anyone) to verify that you did those things. Now, it’s not just the name of the organization that lends you credibility, or what you tell other people you did...it’s what you actually did.\n\nThis then calls into question: why do we need these organizations then? If my own accomplishments are on a public ledger for anyone to see, do I really need to be a part of a DAO for the credentials?\n\nWell, it’s not just about the credentials.\n\n### Social Life\n\n*How can the organization facilitate the building and maintenance of social relationships?*\n\nIn my opinion, the prospect of making new friends and experiencing the *lively social scene* is also one of the main reasons people go to college. Social life on campus is roughly made up of:\n\n* Clubs and organizations\n* Greek life\n* Living in close proximity with other people your age\n* Dating scene\n\n#### Clubs and Organizations\n\nStarting with clubs and organizations, I believe that interest-based DAOs would be able to provide a more fulfilling experience for both students and faculty. At universities, people often join clubs to 1) meet people with the same interests and 2) pad their resume for professional pursuits. Most participants are not tangibly rewarded by the club or the university for the work they do, it’s easy to misconstrue the degree to which they participated, and almost everyone stops participating after graduation. (That is assuming they stick with the club throughout all of college; anyone who made prior commitments can quit at anytime if they don’t feel personally incentivized to contribute anymore.) Furthermore, a lot of clubs and organizations are not great at documenting their rules and practices, resulting in huge changes in both structure and culture as seniors graduate and new leadership takes over.\n\nThe web3 parallel of student organizations right now is that DAOs use Discord channels for certain interests (art, gaming, etc). If we view DAOs themselves as clubs utilizing social/community tokens, participants would be (*at least* financially) incentivized to contribute to the sustainability of the organization over the long term, even after they “graduate.” As long as a member holds the tokens, they will be invested in the DAO and contribute in the hopes of increasing the token’s value and receiving individual rewards. This token-based model introduces **a financial incentive that strengthens personal incentives to contribute to the community**. Participation could be transparently recorded (ex. receiving different NFTs for attending and hosting events), and the direction of the DAO’s activities would be driven by community members’ voting power through the utilization of tools like [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/). This means that everyone in a DAO, regardless of their role within the DAO, has a common, overarching incentive that is difficult to outweigh by other incentives. Whether this model is good or bad in the big picture is up to interpretation; for more thoughts on this, I’ll refer you to [“The Token Society”](https://www.drorpoleg.com/the-token-society/) by Drorg Poleg and [“Social Token Paradox”](https://gaby.mirror.xyz/zqchiBQhWWS49gaabLU92-BUUwfBL5aHCtNT88VTI8o) by Gaby Goldberg.\n\nIn addition to aligning individual incentives more effectively within the organization, web3 clubs could have much better documentation of membership, internal processes, organization history, traditions, and more. DAOs also solve the problem that many clubs deal with on a regular basis in web2: they have to follow the rules that the university imposes on spending, membership, and utilization of community spaces that may impede on the quality and speed of activity. With DAOs, those trying to organize community activities and those enforcing rules and regulations would act in consensus by vote (and at the very least, be more on the same page).\n\n#### Greek Life\n\nRegarding Greek life, the DAO itself could be a fraternity or sorority, perhaps with a national DAO and regional or local DAO chapters that belong to the national collective. This type of organizational structure could certainly be supported in web3, with a similar “rush” process for potential new members to get to know what being in the DAO is like and for DAO members to meet potential new members. The “rush” process as we see it today in web2 is heavily centered around social relationships, and the one for a web3 equivalent would be too.\n\nAside from rush, another common characteristic of Greek life is themed parties. DAOs have already done this—for the [FWB (Friends with Benefits) Paris](https://gallery.fwb.help/fwb-paris) party that happened this past year, members had to hold 75 $FWB community tokens to RSVP. If contributions to the organization (participating in chapter meetings, leading community service events, organizing a fundraiser, etc.) are all recorded on-chain and measured with tools like [Sourcecred](https://sourcecred.io/), these social events can act as privileges to unlock for those who not only pull their weight, but are most invested in the community.\n\n#### Close Proximity to Peers\n\nLiving around other people your age and finding community based on physical proximity is a core part of the university social experience. This one is tougher for DAOs to replace because housing would have to be systematically organized by the community, but there’s no reason why DAOs can’t have their own co-living programs, especially since we are seeing the unbundling of campus social life in web2 already with initiatives by [Edyfi](https://edyfi.org/) and [On Deck](https://www.beondeck.com/). A side note is that this, along with all other IRL events, would necessitate that DAO membership is not anonymous, which is perhaps an unfounded assumption for what web3 universities would be like 🤔\n\n#### Dating Scene\n\nThe last aspect of social life on campus is the dating scene. As a college student, you are around arguably the highest concentration of people your age searching for significant others; the use of dating apps is particularly prevalent in and around college campuses. In web2, the dating scene is not exactly fostered by the organization (university); it is neither encouraged nor discouraged. This could change in web3, with baked-in mechanisms to reward people for matchmaking.\n\n[https://twitter.com/fullyallocated/status/1434364044446687235?s=20](https://twitter.com/fullyallocated/status/1434364044446687235?s=20)\n\nDepending on how much the community believes in the importance of this, a DAO could build its own matchmaking tools for its members. They could also hold collaborative functions to mix and match certain DAOs (ex. [Flamingo](https://flamingodao.xyz/) x [PleasrDAO](https://pleasr.org/)), something like a series of frat and sorority mixers that facilitate meeting more people.\n\nThe starkest contrast between a social experience at university vs. in a DAO is that DAOs exist primarily online. The key to unlocking comparable social experiences for young people in a web3 world is to organize IRL events for DAO members.\n\n### Path Toward Professional “Success”\n\n*How can the organization support students’ professional endeavors?*\n\nParts of the university experience that increase students’ likelihood for professional success have already been mentioned: credentials and participation in clubs and organizations. Universities also support students on their path toward “success” in various other ways. I put quotes around “success” here because...well, students optimize for different things. Common measures of postgraduate success at *my* school are 1) how much money you make in your new grad job, 2) how well-known the company you work for is, and 3) how much optionality your new grad gig affords you.\n\nHere on campus, there is a career center that provides job interview preparation, resources for writing resumes and cold emails, and networking opportunities with companies the school has relationships with (a large portion of which are finance and consulting firms). These relationships and resources, along with an expansive alumni network (and a diploma which typically boosts income for new grads compared to their counterparts without one) are a huge draw for prospective students.\n\nCan DAOs replace this?\n\nThis is hard to answer, because this is probably not the right question to ask. The assumption here is that students come to university to ultimately get jobs and be “successful.” I don’t know if most people will join DAOs to get jobs elsewhere; this is certainly not the case in the status quo. DAOs are communities, not machines to train and prepare people for corporate positions (sorry Duke…have to be honest about my perspective here). The very essence of a DAO goes against the traditional ideas of “work” and “success” that many of us grow up with, and I love that.\n\nWhat I do know is that web3 organizations are likely more meritocratic, which lends themselves to being more effective when matching people with the right skills to the right roles. Gone are the days of college students padding resumes and exaggerating their experiences to get jobs from employers who arbitrarily define their hiring processes and job requirements. My hope is that in a web3 world, finding roles that fit your interests and experiences is much more straightforward. Maybe there’s a person or group of people you really want to work with. You could join their DAO and start doing work to prove yourself, as well as witness firsthand how these people work together and how the DAO functions internally. If you did this with companies, it would be like getting to know the workplace before signing a job offer there. No more painting falsehoods from either side; your personal branding will be based on your on-chain work history, and you get to know an employer beyond what their website and recruiters tell you.\n\nDAOs solve the broken college → industry system we’re seeing in the status quo today, which stems from huge incentive misalignment. It’s true that a lot of students want high-paying, stable jobs right out of college, which is why many of them make the investment in attending elite universities. Elite universities want the same; the more wealthy graduates there are, the more likely the university is to make money from alumni donations (and the elevated status of its brand from its association with alumni at elite firms). Universities *market themselves* very differently though—as places to explore your intellectual curiosities, discover what you want to do with your life, and be on your way to unlocking the best opportunities for whatever you’re interested in. From my perspective, it’s no coincidence that of all the students who come into college wanting to study a wide variety of different subjects and pursue their interests, many end up in investment banking, consulting, and big tech positions right out of college. But we know that not all young people want to go into these jobs. I recognize that this is *grossly* over-simplified and very informed by my personal experiences, but the point here is to demonstrate that incentives are misaligned between individual community members and those who oversee governance within universities. How much do universities really encourage us to think critically about our professional lives? How much do they encourage us to pursue our passions and interests?\n\n### Education\n\n*How can the organization help students gain knowledge and skills? What does a fulfilling learning experience look like?*\n\nAh, yes—education. Acquiring a breadth of knowledge, being intellectually stimulated, and having your worldview expanded. The supposed reason why everyone comes to university and stays here for long enough to earn a degree.\n\nThis is something where, truly, your mileage may vary regardless of the structure of the organization. I’ll keep this relatively short and simple.\n\nAt universities, administrators, deans, and professors come up with a curriculum you must complete via methods outside of your control (submitting an assignment with *x* requirements by *y* date with a couple of tests throughout the semester). I personally do not know how much of what a university claims to be world-class methodologies is actually backed by scientific research, but what I do know is that not everyone learns well via the same methods. Fundamentally, in order to manage the volume of students that come through various programs, universities implement standardized policies that strongly restrict students’ ability to shape their own academic journeys.\n\nWith DAOs, it is very probable that you will actually learn more skills and knowledge relevant to doing what you’re interested in because you’d hopefully have more **creative freedom in the learning process.** Instead of being forced to learn via lectures and homework assignments (the content and format of which you have no control over), you can have more of a say in the methods by which you learn (building projects, creating anthologies, going to book clubs, etc). This applies to both STEM and non-STEM majors, especially because there is nothing preventing experts in all fields from joining DAOs and becoming instructors to guide learning. DAOs *can* impose rules by which people must prove that they learned things (the degree to which will vary), but I imagine the rules would be a lot less arbitrary and plentiful than in university, simply because *the community would define the rules*.\n\nThe model for formal education in a DAO could be an essay in itself (all of the categories could be). I believe DAOs would be most effective not trying to create the web3 parallel of university education, but get at the core reasons for why people come to university to “learn”—one of which is to pick up the necessary skills in preparation for post-graduation goals. For a Computer Science student, the model that comes to mind for me here is online coding bootcamps and workshops—learn skills relevant to a role and/or industry you’re interested in. DAOs would be more community-oriented than typical bootcamps, but that’s where the magic is: instead of an instructor being paid to teach you React.js for four weeks (and then everyone dips), students could earn tokens for learning in workshops and completing projects, and instructors can earn tokens for running workshop series. After students “graduate” from the programming, they could put a percentage of their earnings back into the DAO, something similar to Lambda School’s business model. This, in addition to the tokens they earned throughout the learning process, creates strong incentives for graduates to stay involved in the community. This could look like referring high-potential talent to the DAO, advising and mentoring newer DAO members, and connecting other members to employment opportunities. DAOs are an opportunity for us to re-think how to balance operating at scale and providing high-quality learning experiences.\n\n## The Other Characteristics of a University\n\n### Admissions\n\n*How is membership decided?*\n\nToday, students tell universities, “I have xyz accomplishments, and my aptitude is high enough (see test scores) to attend your school.” Schools review applications (composed of class grades, extracurricular activities, test scores, and personal essays) to admit students based on their potential to:\n\n1. Succeed academically and obtain their degree\n2. Strengthen the school’s branding through their accomplishments during and after university\n\nOf course, schools also supposedly evaluate students based on whether they’d fit campus culture and what they’d be involved in on campus according to their interests. They also take into account athletic ability, and for *some reason* they ask who your parents are and where they went to school.\n\nI’m not an admissions officer, but I assume that universities would want to recruit students who can ultimately contribute financially to the school, whether that is directly as alumni or indirectly through their accomplishments. If someone went to Harvard and ultimately ends up becoming a well-known and important figure, this boost’s Harvard’s signal as a school that both attracts and produces people who will become well-known and important figures. Status.\n\nAdmissions for DAOs have been a hot topic as of late. Many DAOs are token-gated―Friends with Benefits requires potential new members to fill out an application, join their Discord, and buy 75 $FWB tokens after approval. The quickest way to acquire these community tokens is to swap fiat currency for them via a decentralized exchange (DEX) such as [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/). Acquire the tokens, and you’ll gain access to what the DAO has to offer as a stakeholder in the organization. “A [fixed total](https://www.fwb.help/join) of 1M $FWB tokens exist,” meaning that (until a community vote changes this) there is technically a limit to how many people can ultimately join the DAO. I personally don’t believe token-gating is the answer to admissions for web3 universities. Over time, I expect DAO admissions processes to encompass volunteering to do work for the organization over time and earning eventual membership. (That is not to say that buying your way into a DAO is dissimilar to donating a lot to an institution to increase chances for admission.)\n\nThe most promising aspect of admissions in a web3 world is that the college application process for students could be so much more streamlined thanks to the blockchain. Because the work students did leading up to college could be verified and made public for anyone to see, the amount of time, money, and effort students pour into college applications now would drastically decrease in web3. The only aspect of today’s college application process that would still need to occur is an evaluation of community compatibility (the closest web2 equivalent of which is an interview with an alumnus).\n\n“But wait,” you say, “we don’t necessarily want to optimize for meritocracy in college admissions.” To that, I say, gaining a holistic view of who a person is, what their interests and hobbies are, and what their goals are for attending university would be much easier and truer to the word “holistic” in a web3 world (where more of our lives are online) than just reading a couple of essays they wrote about who they are.\n\n### Cost & Length of Time Attended\n\n*What do you pay to become a member? How does that affect how long you stay?*\n\nWe all know that the cost of higher education is exorbitantly high and becoming more inaccessible each year. I doubt that the financial cost of getting into a DAO equivalent would equate to what we see with universities, although it’s not impossible for fees to rise to tens of thousands of dollars, especially because DAOs (as we know them today) are vulnerable to market volatility.\n\nAt universities, students pay tuition at the start of each term, and in return, they receive the right to register for classes and work toward degree requirements. For undergraduate students, this typically lasts for four years (two years for liberal arts/general education and two years for specialized classes within certain disciplines), after which they are off into the real world where each subsequent year the university calls them asking for alumni donations. Even though students’ tuition fees don’t usually go toward universities’ endowments, alumni donations do. Regardless, neither students nor alumni have much of a say in where their money goes. (There are other opportunity costs of attending university vs. doing something else with your life depending on who you are, but I’ll focus on the financial cost here.)\n\nWith token-gated DAOs, participants pay for tokens as a one-time entry fee. These tokens are pooled into the DAO treasury, where funds are allocated as the community sees fit. For [Lion DAO](https://blockchain.mirror.xyz/d2pxavq9Bztp6kCzF9UjtoJEnFTY9Oks3RPkrcBUsKg), launched by student organization Blockchain@Columbia this past summer, DAO funds are used to host guest speaker events, sponsor the development of new educational material, facilitate internal blockchain R&D, and reward grants to NYC students contributing to blockchain efforts. Community members have more of a say in what the DAO spends money on.\n\nWhat’s interesting here is how directly the cost correlates to a student’s incentive to contribute to the organization, and how that influences how long they are a member. In web2, many students pay a hefty sum for the goods they receive, and after their time is up and they get the degree, there really isn’t anything tangible incentivizing them to continue to contribute to the university (donating money, helping it become more well-known, etc). In web3, however, token ownership doesn’t necessarily terminate after your education is formally marked as “complete” (if that would even be a thing in web3). A lifelong token holder and contributor could be a lifelong member of that DAO. FWB has a “[seasons](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/TvKSPfZqHNXRZVYFYyJuziCMIZ8fZ34q585YcUYRGtc)” model; if participants stay active and still hold a certain amount of tokens by the end of a season, they retain the right to continue accessing FWB’s offerings. Initial payment for entry gives individuals a stake in the organization and incentivizes them to contribute value to the community for as long as they retain that financial investment.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, I think web3 could flip the entire idea of an education on its head—why do you stop “becoming educated” after you graduate from school? Why do all of the amazing things you enjoyed about college abruptly end after four years? DAOs have the potential to unlock *tangible lifelong value* for token holders, not just financially.\n\n## So…?\n\nIf you give a bunch of college students control over the direction of their collective organization, maybe it would turn out to be a Lord of the Flies disaster, but I think if you had a DAO made up of driven, curious, and ambitious college students (arguably what universities are supposed to be made up of), a lot of really cool stuff could happen. (DAOs also don’t have to be purely made up of students. My hope is that an outcome of DAOs as university replacements would be a decrease of “administrative bloat.” I mean, [come on guys](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2019/12/duke-university-administrators-tax-pay-mike-krzyzewski-price-health-system-endowment).) The web3 equivalent of a university experience doesn’t even have to reside within a single DAO—college could be unbundled into multiple DAOs, each serving a different purpose along these categories.\n\nAs a last note, this is by no means comprehensive—each of the sections I discussed in this could be their own essays. (I didn’t even touch upon graduate degrees and the research that universities conduct, and how that influences university professors’ incentives when it comes to teaching courses. I also didn’t focus on the aspect of finding identity and belonging at university, and how that relates to coming of age.) In addition to me just sharing my thoughts, my hope is that this can act as a student voice in the conversations happening right now around **building experiences for young people in web3**. I can’t conclusively say that DAO equivalents of universities would be an objectively better experience for everyone who attends university now, as we are still early and have a long way to go. DAOs have social, economic, and political implications that could result in huge societal shifts. All of crypto does…which is why people are so excited about it.\n\n\n---\n\nA huge thank you to [Adithya Vellal](https://twitter.com/avellal14), [Kanan Rengaraju](https://twitter.com/KananRengaraju), Luke Qin, and [Rishi Tripathy](https://twitter.com/rishi_tripathy_) for helping me structure my stream of consciousness :)\n\nIf you’re new here—I’m Kassen, and I’m a generalist with a CS and Cultural Anthropology background trying to break into web3 because it perfectly combines my interests.

{"id": "-RMzdhBexPslSDwre_tPgk3tyx8KRc1g-x5HYaX_PQA", "title": "How NFTs Empower the Modern Artist", "body": "*Originally published on [Substack](https://kassen.substack.com/p/how-nfts-empower-the-modern-artist) on July 10th, 2021.*\n\nI’ve been hearing about NFTs for about half a year now, and never really took an interest in them. I’d occasionally see some abstract pixel art or kitten cartoon on my Twitter feed, and to be honest, I thought it was almost pointless that people seemed to be spending money on them. I didn’t really understand what they were or why they mattered. That was also around the time when I started to learn how to create digital art, and most of the artists I was interacting with online were people my age who eschewed NFTs due to misconceptions about them. \n\nOver the last couple of months, I’ve been talking to more and more people in the crypto world (in large part thanks to [On Deck Catalyst](https://www.beondeck.com/catalyst)) and became much more interested in NFTs...especially how they are changing the game for artists.\n\n## What even are NFTs?\n\nBasically, NFTs are digitally unique tokens that exist on the blockchain (most commonly Ethereum). I’ll leave the details to [them](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/).\n\n## How do artists benefit from them?\n\nIn my view, there are three major ways:\n\n1. Ownership and monetization\n2. Artist to fan relationships\n3. A (more) level playing field\n\n### Ownership and monetization\n\nBecause NFTs are stored on the blockchain, anyone at anytime can check who created it, who used to own it, and who owns it now. This “digital paper trail” allows the original creator of the NFT to take a portion of the sale each time the NFT is sold. Thus, no matter how many times an NFT exchanges hands, the original creator is paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nThis is especially game-changing for artists, because in addition to (or perhaps, as a symptom of) art being traditionally undervalued, art is often stolen, re-sold without the artist’s permission, and/or used in a variety of physical and digital products that are sold without licensing agreements.\n\nWait...but can’t someone still do that even if the art is created as an NFT? They could just download the image, make prints of it, and sell them online without telling the artist.\n\nThat is technically true, but the status quo is already as bad as it gets for artists. They make nothing off of stolen/re-sold art. At least with NFTs, when the “original” is sold and re-sold, the artist is rewarded for the value that each buyer sees in it, and additionally, they have knowledge of who the buyers and resellers are. The *mode* through which creations are shared is inherently more transparent. \n\nThe one caveat here is that if someone turns *your* art into *their* NFT, they could potentially make millions off of your work...repeatedly. Artists’ creations are technically protected under copyright law, but for now, it’s mostly up to the platforms to verify that the creator is minting an NFT of their own work. More on that [here](https://www.coindesk.com/stop-tokenizing-art-you-dont-own).\n\n### Artist to fan relationships\n\nNFTs open up a huge opportunity for artists to identify their most passionate fans, build community, and make more revenue as a second-order effect.\n\nWhen I think about fans spending on *purely digital things* to support their favorite creators, the first thing that comes to mind is Twitch livestreams. On Twitch, fans purchase subscriptions to unlock special emotes to use in chat, show animations on screen to capture the streamer’s attention, and much more.\n\nBuying an NFT, especially one of high price and/or high scarcity, is a way for a superfan to 1) capture the artist’s attention and 2) express their appreciation for their work. \n\nFor the artist, this helps them identify their strongest fans - people who will pay the most for their art and share their art with others. Smaller artists who may not have a large following can now hone in on their “1,000 true fans,” and larger artists can find not only the fans who will pay the highest price, but the fans who could be the ones who lead and moderate their online community, drive marketing, and more.\n\nOutside of identifying superfans, NFTs also open up another avenue for artists to engage with their followers - they can organize NFTs as giveaways, use rare NFTs as art contest prizes, and create limited NFT collections. Stronger artist-fan relationships → higher likelihood of monetization → growth in community → more strong relationships.\n\n### A (more) level playing field\n\nBecause NFT art is sold, bought, and owned digitally, artists who utilize more nascent technologies and/or mixed media formats can now more fully participate in the “traditional artist’s experience” that includes art auctions, being displayed in an art gallery, and more when they were previously unable to do so.\n\nLesser known artists can have another avenue for gaining an online following via NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea, Nifty Gateway, and many more. Nowadays, pretty much anyone can mint an NFT, with different platforms having different processes for getting your art onto them.\n\n## This is just the beginning\n\nI’m personally very excited to see where NFTs take us -- as our digital life becomes an increasingly important part of our identity, NFTs will play a larger role in not only how we express ourselves creatively but how we live our lives. We’ll use NFTs as receipts for transactions, rewards in video games, and much more...but for now, it’s pretty damn cool to see artists thriving. \n\n\n---\n\nSpecial shoutout to ODC friends who encouraged me to start writing publicly, and [Rafi](https://twitter.com/sr_tanzim) and [Adithya](https://twitter.com/avellal14) for reviewing :)", "timestamp": 1633558610, "digest": "E2GvsgQaXgnm1k2mR72JmpIHbNgpFsFnV0NEFOU7Vxg", "contributor": "0x90A0233A0c27D15ffA23E293EC8dd6f2Ef2942e2"}

Unfortunately, they cannot tell what’s good & what’s bad; what’s real & what’s scam; what’s ETH & what’s ADA. To make things worse, the amount of information asymmetry and deleterious shills are growing at the same rate, if not more, than the growth of Metaverse itself. If left unchecked, this might lead to the demise of what could have been the most important socioeconomic transformation since the industrial revolution. To ensure prosperity for all in the Metaverse, we need “less shilling, more education; less maximalism, more collaboration”.\n\nBy combining clever cryptoeconomics with peer predictions & Natural Language Processing algorithms, we are proud to introduce [KnoxEdge Market (KnoxMarket)](https://knox.market/): a **Community-Driven Learning & Investing Platform**, where weekly peer-prediction knowledge markets are hosted to allow anyone to contribute-to-earn and put money where their mouths are, at the same time learning and educating themselves. We are re-thinking the way the world shares knowledge and our mission is to transform vast bytes of information consumed in today’s world and tomorrow’s Metaverse into easy bits of knowledge, making it seamlessly accessible to everyone.\n\n**1. What is Knowledge Market?**\n\n![The Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) Pyramid](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KcWp2bsohFQmmEtvHOwxm.png?height=286&width=530)\n\n*Information (prediction) markets can be thought of as belonging to the more general concept of crowdsourcing which is specially designed to aggregate information on particular topics of interest.*\n\nKnoxMarket is the next frontier of information market, representing the next logical step in realizing the data-information-knowledge-wisdom (DIKW) pyramid. Some of the existing information markets include Polymarket, Augur, Lithium Finance, Upshot, Erasure Bay and several others.\n\n**2. Empowering You to Contribute-To-Earn with Your Knowledge**\n\n![Weekly Peer-Prediction Knowledge Market](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oG1r648WhmhhidwW-kqPK.png?height=1026&width=1633)\n\nUsers can participate in a knowledge market topic by submitting their thoughts and bidding $ on them. When an active topic ends, a leaderboard is released and users are ranked according to their scores. This score represents the contribution and alignment of the user to the wisdom of the crowd. It is calculated by scoring the submissions from each user against all other submissions using the KnoxEdge natural language processing algorithm. The bidding payout depends on their scores on the leaderboard: users who submit better peer predictions win money from losers. A detailed PNL simulator is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w67ruq6XrBr_MekBPeAwNZqYZC8DUx2BmSqDnNIi1hE/edit).\n\n*Example*\n\nAlice and Bob are participating in the topic “What is Axie Infinity?”. Alice submits an answer of “a play-to-earn blockchain NFT game on Ethereum” and bids $5 on her answer. On the other hand, Bob submits an answer of “a PlayStation 5 new release” and bids $5 on his answer.\n\nTheir answers are scored by KnoxEdge NLP algorithm in reference to the pool of answers submitted by other users, and their $5s go into the KnoxMarket smart contract. After the topic ends, Alice is correct and receives a topic score of 100, whereas Bob is wrong and receives a topic score of 0. As a result, Alice wins a few dollars from Bob.\n\n**3. Platform Roles**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w6RIB7zjWwgBxzf9OffaR.png?height=684&width=1633)\n\nThere are 3 roles on KnoxMarket with different risk-reward ratios: Bidders, LPs and Sponsors. Bidders put money where their mouths are, while LPs put their assets at work by providing liquidity to a topic. Sponsors are likely to be foundations/protocols/users who are interested in seeding a topic. A detailed PNL simulator is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w67ruq6XrBr_MekBPeAwNZqYZC8DUx2BmSqDnNIi1hE/edit) to calculate how LPs & Sponsors could affect Bidders’ PNL.\n\n***Bidders***\n\nBidders are users who do the hard work: do your own research (DYOR), submit answers, and bid $ on their answers. By contributing high-quality answers, bidders are able to earn peer prediction profits from the bidding pool.\n\n***Liquidity Providers (LPs)***\n\nLPs are passive users who want to provide liquidity only by committing their assets to a given topic’s liquidity pool and earn 1.5% fee from each bid.\n\n***Sponsors***\n\nSponsors are foundations/protocols/users who want to sponsor a topic that they are interested in by directly funding bidders & LPs.\n\n**4. Use Cases**\n\n***Current Use Case: Community-Driven Learning***\n\n*Less shilling, more education — [Santiago Santos](https://twitter.com/santiagoroel/status/1425244613951033349?s=20)*\n\n*Don’t ape, research — [CZ Binance](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1432908130178899970?s=20)*\n\n*If newcomers are still buying Cardano, we have lot of work to do on education — [Stani](https://twitter.com/stanikulechov/status/1434191764533956611?s=21)*\n\nThis will be the first use case of KnoxMarket to bootstrap peer predictions & learning at the community-level. Every week, KnoxMarket will host topics on trending projects, e.g. new projects on Celo, Avalaunch’s upcoming IDOs or new NFTs on Opensea. This will address information asymmetry and even out the playing field between new users and crypto natives, empowering users to educate and protect themselves for any potential risks & malicious CT shilling.\n\nIn the past few weeks, we hosted a series of testnet topics, including Axie Infinity, Yield Guild Games, Moola Market, Mobius Money, to name a few. We are humbled by what Axie Infinity co-founder Jiho commented on our very first topic:\n\n*what is this? it’s beautiful — [Axie Infinity Co-founder Jiho](https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1428992078860537861?s=20)* \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y8h0b5QHaEMBUVEb8znW0.png?height=1571&width=1960)\n\n***Next Use Case: Community-Driven Investing***\n\nCommunity-driven investing is the next major use case that we would love to explore with the community. What if we have a knowledge market topic on \n\n*“Should we invest in Project XYZ? Why? How much?”* \n\nthat is only open to our top users/analysts. Based on the results, we can use treasury funds & platform revenues to invest in those projects. If so, are we also a community-driven investing platform? The answer is simple: the potential use cases of KnoxMarket are as powerful as the questions asked & answered by the community.\n\n*Asking questions is a uniquely powerful tool for unlocking value in organizations — Harvard Business Review*\n\nBy selecting and empowering the right community members to become whom we call “SuperKnoxers” through KnoxMarket gamified peer prediction competitions (similar to how Darwinian evolution & natural selection selects the fittest of the fittest), KnoxMarket offers a solution to the Layer-0 coordination issue currently present in DeFi & Web3. Thanks to DeFi composability, we could easily deploy KnoxMarket’s Layer-0 coordination solution to digital asset management protocols such as Enzyme Finance or dHedge to unlock our community-driven investing use case.\n\n*We talk too much about Layer 1s and not enough on Layer 0 — the communities … Let’s not forget blockchains are coordination mechanisms and that requires a thriving social layer of trust among the community — [Santiago](https://twitter.com/santiagoroel/status/1433159050519355396?s=20)*\n\n![SuperKnoxers & Community-Driven Investing](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zarGDEXlcGwk4XGMaHWnI.png?height=974&width=1960)\n\n*Example*\n\nAlice has good track record on KnoxMarket and successfully earned SuperKnoxer status. She has the chance to manage KnoxFund together with 9 other SuperKnoxers.\n\nAssuming a performance fee of 20%, KnoxFund manages to attract an AUM of $1M. One year later, KnoxFund grows from $1M to $2M. This $1M profit translates into a performance fee of $200k. Assuming 50% profit sharing, $100k goes to DAO treasury & the remaining $100k goes to the 10 SuperKnoxers managing the fund, Alice would receive $10k.\n\n***Other Use Cases***\n\nFurthermore, KnoxMarket’s Layer-0 coordination solution could be used for other applications, such as DAO governance & dispute resolution, which could be the answer to Vitalik’s vision of “non-coin-driven governance”. In fact, the same peer-prediction “bid-to-talk” format on KnoxMarket will be used to run KnoxEdgeDAO governance. Other use cases include illiquid asset/NFTs appraisal, decentralized fact-checking, decentralized McKinsey (i.e. consulting), etc. We will explore these more complex use cases after our community-driven investing use case!\n\n \n **5. Knowledge Mining: Rewarding Bidders & LPs with KNX Tokens**\n\nKNX tokens are rewarded to top 20 bidders who submit high-quality answers. KNX tokens are also rewarded to LPs according to their pool share to incentivize them to provide liquidity to each topic.\n\nKnoxMarket knowledge mining emission will reduce once KnoxFund goes live on Enzyme Finance. In order to boost AUM, KnoxFund depositors will be rewarded with KNX tokens by staking their KnoxFund tokens.\n\n```\nBidding pool: 40,000 KNX per topic*\nLiquidity pool: 20,000 KNX per topic*Shared among top 20 bidders who submitted ≥ 5 thoughts only\n```\n\n**6. Roadmap**\n\n***Q4 2021: Expansion to Ethereum’s Layer 2 & Cross-chain Topics***\n\n*Less maximalism, more collaboration*\n\nMuch like the Olympics, we hope to see crosschain communities competing on the same topic & leaderboard. We strongly believe in the ethos of “Prosperity for All” by breaking down boundaries and bringing together communities. Once KnoxMarket is deployed on Optimism, we will explore cross-chain peer-prediction topics.\n\n \n ***Q4 2021: KNX Token Generation Event***\n\n1 billion KNX token will be minted and used as the governance token to govern DAO treasury, community-driven investment fund & KnoxMarket parameters such as LP fee (1.5%), platform fee (1%), weekly active topics (2 topics per week), topic duration (1 week) and knowledge mining rewards (60k KNX per topic). KNX tokenomics and details on bootstrapping KnoxFund through CopperLaunch-Balancer LBP will be released in mid-late October.\n\n***Q1 2022: SuperKnoxer Status & Community-Driven Investing (KnoxFund)***\n\n*Empowering the right community members as opposed to having a governance circus where everyone voices unqualified opinions and nothing gets done — [Santiago Santos](https://twitter.com/santiagoroel/status/1436428696718479360?s=20)*\n\nIn V2, top-performing users on the leaderboard will be accredited with SuperKnoxer status NFTs. SuperKnoxers have the opportunity to participate in KnoxFund decision making and share performance fee made from KnoxFund. Moreover, SuperKnoxer status will be crucial to unlock other use cases that are more dependent on expert insights than crowd wisdom: asset appraisal, fact-checking, decentralized McKinsey, etc.\n\n***2022 & Beyond: DAO Tools for Knowledge Coordination***\n\nKnoxEdge is primarily a knowledge coordination platform, and the team is continuously developing new knowledge coordination DAO tools to help users to discover, enrich and monetize their knowledge. KnoxEdge would like to make this whole process as seamless as possible for them, since knowledge itself is so seamlessly present within each of us. Moreover, following the *progressive decentralization* approach, we will gradually decentralize KnoxMarket and expand to use cases that the community would love to have.\n\nVisit [KnoxMarket](https://knox.market/) and contribute-to-earn now!

{"id": "Ekpv57xAFO9a_UgNoKS6dyEAzXq4a0n0rhIZvq8tglc", "title": "NFT Drop Reflections", "body": "Hey guys. The auction portion of my NFT ended on my birthday (happy birthday to me) this past Sunday and it managed to sell and I’m just thankful I got that far. I think this token is the precursor to a lot of tokens like it in the future. I think when people are offering their service at a slight premium for the current time, but a discount in the possible future, it acts as an interesting financial support mechanism with a return for you on the back end, whether through the service itself or the trading of the token representing that service. I feel like there will come a time where people are tokenizing services for all sorts of things, and it floats around until it’s claimed or sold to someone else & eventually claimed. All that takes really is a platform.\n\nAnyway, enough about dreams of the future, I wanted to have a quick word vomit about what went down and what I learned from it. First, let’s start with this image, which essentially represents my stats for the drop so far:\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2388ad9b-0f01-4cdc-9fe9-af65b938c8f4\\_1440x920.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2388ad9b-0f01-4cdc-9fe9-af65b938c8f4\\_1440x920.jpeg)\n\nHaving one person, let alone 36 (one of those owners is me) and over 1 ETH in volume through the release of my music is absolutely insane to me, but I’m blessed to have this amount of support. I’m far from sold out but I’m very happy with the results. I have been actively thinking about what sustainability can look like as someone who makes music and I think I’m getting closer to that.\n\nSome of the highlights for me are:\n\n1.  Airdropping the special edition of the songs to my previous supporters (meaning I have 17 new collectors)\n2.  Doing a series of drop rooms with [Aaron](http://twitter.com/aaronhaber) at the [NFT Innovation Society](https://www.clubhouse.com/club/nft-innovation-society) and [Clare](http://twitter.com/claremaguire) with [Showtime](http://tryshowtime.com/).\n3.  Getting written about [on NFTs.WTF](https://nfts.wtf/in-conversation-with-black-dave/) by my dawg [Jessica Yatrofsky](http://twitter.com/jyatrofsky).\n4.  Being able to engage in super interesting and engaging conversations with people about the potential future of music in NFTs.\n\nSome opportunities with this drop:\n\n1.  Auction had very low visibility. The [token itself](https://bit.ly/2VUOoWd) had only 43 views, which is far lower than I would have preferred, but we (yes, we) did manage to get it collected which is great, and for .33 ETH! Any sale was considered a win to me, so I’m glad it was above the floor…but disappointed that it didn’t get it’s full opportunity to win.\n2.  Rap music in NFT still being underrepresented is very frustrating! I’m frustrated! A lot of innovation is gonna come from this side and being overlooked frustrates me!\n3.  I haven’t sold out but it’s just another opportunity to go harder. Gotta go harder.\n\nNow that I’m wrapping this piece up, I feel like I haven’t said much…but I still believe that I’m on the right path by using NFT to find, or add to, sustainability as a rapper. Would love to hear what you guys think. See you on the other side.\n", "timestamp": 1633565567, "digest": "_2BfVjFmMlSZJyOGRSwaLpiBSVlN1-FP9Ss_I1JlSks", "contributor": "0xeD22Bb0106c24C7f6b4d8AAe33639e1467061F64"}

My cousin starts sending me updates about the cryptocurrency markets. I watched videos about bitcoin 2 years ago. I was not really interested in it at that time. What caught my eyes during those updates in how the market fluctuated.\n\nAt that time, bitcoin just passed $25k. I didn’t understand why it keep going up and down. I needed to go deeper. I kept digging. I started watching Youtube videos about financial markets, trading basics, and blockchain/currency explanations. It was eye-opening.\n\nFrom then, I started my journey with cryptocurrencies. I started with $2.\n\nFrom there, my journey was a rollercoaster trip :\n\n* Tesla bought some bitcoin\n* Beeple sold his NFTs for 69 million dollars\n* China cracks down miners in their country\n* Tesla stops accepting bitcoin\n* The market crashed in May 2021\n* El Salvador accepts bitcoin as a legal tender\n\nEvery single one of these events had an effect on the market.\n\nWhat kind of effect?\n\nLemme show you.\n\n## Understand market moves\n\n![Psychology of market cycle from Binance](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*dqswBfaNfUiTgEnL)\n\nI went through all of those phases.\n\nPrices of assets go down and up depending on the market.\n\nA definition of a market is where people meet and exchange value.\n\nFor example :\n\n* in the stock market, people exchange shares with money.\n* in the bond market where participants can issue new [debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt), known as the [primary market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_market), or buy and sell debt [securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)), known as the [secondary market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_market).\n\nAnd now, the crypto market: you buy coins in exchange for fiat.\n\nThe number of people buying coins and the amount of people selling determines the market moves.\n\nYou can analyze the market move using two factors :**Technical analysis**: look at the chart for different indicators of a pattern.\n\n![Typical chart view from tradingview.com](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*cv5HQb6Cs3pVe2ua.png)\n\n**Fundamental analysis**: looks at the bigger picture, regulation, market cap, other news, or issues around a specific market. This methodology looks at the BTC value for example, as a technology regardless of the current price and its outside prices in order to determine what will happen.\n\nWith the understanding of these two basics analysis of market moves, lemme explain the market conditions.\n\n**Bull market :**\n\n![The psychological effect of a bull market](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*z1G_i7F-Q52Lca6tDdnrFA.png)\n\nA [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) is a market that is on the rise and where the conditions of the economy are generally favorable.\n\nA bull market is typified by a sustained increase in prices. In the case of equity markets, a bull market denotes a rise in the prices of companies’ shares. In such times, investors often have faith that the [uptrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp) will continue over the long term. In this scenario, the country’s economy is typically strong and employment levels are high.\n\nIn the case of the crypto market, it means the price per coin (in $) is going up.\n\n**Bear market :**\n\n![The psychological effect of a bear market](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2XvHswIwpRSPX902IWdwMg.png)\n\nA bear market exists in an economy that is receding and where most stocks are declining in value.\n\nA [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) is one that is in decline. A market is usually not considered a true “bear” market unless it has fallen 20% or more from recent highs. In a bear market, share prices are continuously dropping. This results in a downward trend that investors believe will continue; this belief, in turn, perpetuates the downward spiral. During a bear market, the economy slows down and unemployment rises as companies begin laying off workers.\n\nin the case of the crypto market, the price per coin is going down.\n\nBecause the financial markets are greatly influenced by investors’ attitudes, these terms also denote how investors feel about the market and the ensuing economic trends :\n\n> You are bullish if you believe that an asset will increase in price;\n>\n> You are bearish otherwise.\n\nNow you understand the basics of market moves, let’s jump into the cryptocurrency market.\n\n## Cryptocurrency as an investment\n\nInvesting is different from trading.\n\n> Trading means you are for the short term market move. You take profit as soon as the market move the way you predict it. If you open a position saying the trend is going up (meaning you are taking a long position), once it does, you take profit. If not, you lose. If you open a position saying the trend is going down (meaning you are taking the short position), once it does, you take your profit. If not you lose\n\nLike I said in [my recent article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/beginner-guide-for-first-time-nfts-buyers-2021-7abecb8dd059), Bitcoin was created in the context of an economic crisis. Satoshi Nakamoto quotes :\n\n***The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible*.**\n\nThis was the beginning of a long road.\n\nIn 2008, an anonymous person called Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin. It’s money on the Internet, without banks, without a middle man.\n\n**First, what is money?**\n\nMoney is often defined in terms of the three **functions** or **services** that it provides :\n\n* **Medium of exchange**: Money’s most important function is as a medium of exchange to ease transactions. Without money, all transactions would have to be conducted by **barter.** It involves the direct exchange of one good or service for another.\n* **Store of value:** To be a medium of exchange, money must hold its value over time; that is, it must be a store of value. Otherwise, money could not be stored for some period and remain valuable in exchange.\n* **Unit of account**: Money also functions as a unit of account, providing a *common measure of the value* of goods and services being exchanged.\n\nHow did Satoshi manage to create “Internet money” with these functions?\n\nHe leveraged something called **Blockchain**.\n\nBlockchain is a register where every transaction is recorded. Its characteristics :\n\n* **Immutability**: No possibility to make a change on the register once data is in the ledger.\n* **Decentralized**: No one owns the technology, it’s shared among the users.\n* **Anonymity**: You don’t need to give your credentials, a random password is given to you only.\n* **Security**: It’s almost impossible to hack because of the density of the network.\n\nWith it, Satoshi made Bitcoin. No possibility to double spend. A store of value. A medium of exchange. A unit of account. All combined using blockchain and cryptography.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin has exploded. After 13 years, a unit of bitcoin is now worth between $30k and $65k depending on the demand.\n\nIn 2015, a group of 8 persons figured out they can do more things with the blockchain: ***they can build some kind of contract on top of it***.\n\nGiven the fact that the blockchain is a register, what you put on it depends on the writer of the code. If they can figure out a way to codify functions and put it on the blockchain, they will have another use case.\n\n> And they made it. Ethereum was born.\n\nYou can create your coin(or token) like Bitcoin, determine the max supply, and release it in under 5 min, using something called **“Smart contract”**: lines of codes you write and deploy on the blockchain.\n\nIn January 2021, I programmed the first token I called “Wetchit” which means “spare change”. I couldn’t believe it. It took me less than 5 min :\n\n* I went on Youtube\n* Research “How to create a coin with Ethereum”\n* I watched the tutorial\n* Click on the Github link\n* Copy the code\n* Paste it on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)\n* I change the name of the token\n* Define the max supply, the abbreviation of the token name, the divisibility, and leave the rest unchanged.\n\nDone. I compile it. No error.\n\nNow, I connect my Metamask and it was ready to deploy.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t have enough Ethereum to pay gas fees.\n\nBut I had the option to test the coin on Kovan Test Network. I was working well. I sent some tokens to different wallets.\n\nI was like “WOW, this is the next thing”.\n\nDo you see how easy it was to create a token in under 5 min, with an open-source program?\n\nThat’s why you need to know some statistics.\n\n## Macro view of the cryptocurrency market\n\nHere are the statistics in 09/21/2021, based on Coinmarketcap:\n\n* [12,037](https://coinmarketcap.com/) cryptocurrencies\n* [$1,828,977,121,702](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) market cap\n* [$139,985,252,175](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) 24h volume\n\n12,037 coins !!!!!!! That’s 66.8722222222 times the number of fiat currencies.\n\nKnowing cryptocurrency market follows the same market rules, how do you choose the best ones to invest in?\n\nFirst, every coin has a cycle, like the figure from Binance above. We can group them into two categories :\n\n* Bitcoin season\n* Altcoin (all coins different from BTC) season\n\nWith the data record, scientists develop a model for the evolution of bitcoin, called the **Stock-To-Flow model**.\n\n![Stock-to-flow model of bitcoin](https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0\\*Xm_on3EwB4AOPcHP)\n\nIt represents the evolution of BTC since the beginning of its creation.\n\nOn the X-axis, you have Years, Y-axis you have the price per BTC.\n\nBitcoin has a 21 million coins supply. No more will be created.\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last 30 days it is Altcoin Month. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin month.**\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days) it is Altcoin Season. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin season.**\n\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last year it is Altcoin Year. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin year.**\n\nHere is an index to find out which season we are: [Blockchain Center index](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/)\n\nThe macro view allows you to have a global view of the market.\n\n**Here is how to approach bitcoin and altcoin season from a macro perspective.**\n\nA great opportunity to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nCounterintuitive right?\n\nLemme explain.\n\nWhen you know everyone is buying a house from a specific location, what happen? Prices go up. You have then two choices :\n\n* FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): do whatever possible to have a slot for you (at a higher price with maybe a smaller slot because of the high demand)\n* Research an alternative to the location, not far and with a lower price.\n\nThat’s the same strategy here.\n\nIf it’s altcoin season, it means bitcoin is undervalued in some way. It’s ‘cheap’.\n\nWhen you buy an asset when it’s cheap, it gives you leverage to take profit sooner, when you needed.\n\nSame concept here. You want to invest in cheap options. In this case, it’s altcoins.\n\nNow, how do you choose which altcoin to invest in?\n\nHere is my methodology I called: ***themetapick***\n\n## How to invest in altcoins using themetapick strategy\n\n**12,036** altcoins. That’s a lot.\n\nHow to wrap your head around those?\n\n**1-Understand blockchain**\n\n**2-Understand cryptocurrency market (I gave you an overview, but you need to go deeper)**\n\nBegin here: [100 Tools and References to Begin with Blockchain and Cryptoassets (2021)](https://medium.com/coinmonks/100-tools-and-references-to-begin-with-blockchain-and-cryptoassets-2021-9d7efb5b4797)\n\n> **Do you homework for at least 50 hours.**\n\nAfter that you should be able to answer these questions :\n\n* What is a blockchain?\n* What is a market cycle?\n* What is the difference between bitcoin and Ethereum?\n* What is a support? What is a resistance?\n* What is a wallet? How to secure a wallet?\n* How to buy a coin? Where to buy a coin?\n* How to transfer a coin?\n* What is the difference between a cold wallet and a hot wallet?\n* What is a seed phrase? What is the difference between a seed phrase and a password?\n* What is the difference between Bitcoin and Dogecoin?\n* What is the difference between Dogecoin and Shiba INU ?\n* What is the difference between Ethreum and the coin built on top of Ethreum?\n* What is a gas fee? What is a gas price? What is a gas?\n* What is the definition of circulating supply? What is the difference between circulating supply and max supply?\n* Why not buy a hardware wallet on Amazon or another third-party company? Why do you have to buy from the company making them?\n* What is the best way to protect your coins?\n* What is the best way to lose your coins?\n* Why can’t you invest more than you can afford to lose?\n\nIf you cannot answer one of these questions after 50 hours, DM me on [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/themetaboy)or [Instagram](http://instagram.com/themetaboy), I will be happy to help.\n\nNow that you can answer all these questions. We can move forward.\n\nWhen It comes to investing, you have to consider 4 cases :\n\n***Low risk/low reward potential***: If you are a real risk-averse person, I suggest you look into the top 5 coins. You can find them on [Coinmarketcap](http://coinmarketcap.com/) or [coingecko](http://coingecko.com/).\n\n***Low Risk/High Potential reward:*** These are scams. When you don’t have something to lose, you are not investing. you are gambling.\n\n***High Risk/Low Potential reward:*** Think of it like digging a well, you go deeper and deeper, with all the risk, you finally find out there is a little quantity of groundwater. Worth the risk? Don’t know, maybe now you learned how to dig a well. In the case of cryptocurrencies, I may be a way to experiment.\n\n***High risk/high potential reward:*** Those are the ones you need to investigate and it will take time.\n\nif you are a high-risk/high reward-looking person, the rest is for you.\n\n## Level 1: All new beginner\n\n***1-Unique value proposition***\n\nIs it clear?

I was preparing to travel to Hamburg/Germany, and I wanted to buy a gift for a friend. Because she invited me and three other members of my former startup. I wanted something special for her.\n\n![Soumbedioune village overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*0uSZcku1Nla6PGDq)\n\nThe items I found were amazing: artistic bags, bracelets, baskets, dresses… And the most interesting thing for me was the amazing artwork from local artists. It was so beautiful and amazing, even if some of them you can see the mark of time on them. I wanted them so much…\n\nBut, I had a problem:\n\nHow do I transport them to Hamburg?\n\nIt was not possible. I had no other choice, I had to find another item. Like the ones below, I bought some sculptures.\n\n![Small sculptures you can put in a suitcase](https://miro.medium.com/max/768/0\\*bfMbBoq_w54KmFpI)\n\nSince then, I have been asking… What if those artworks could be :\n\n* Digitized\n* Sharable\n* Authentified\n* Preserved\n\nIt would be more “transportable”.\n\nIt took me two years to figure out a solution: NFTs\n\n## A brief history\n\nIn 2008, an anonymous person called Satoshi Nakamoto to launch Bitcoin. It’s money on the Internet, without banks, without a middle man.\n\nFirst, what is money?\n\nMoney is often defined in terms of the three **functions** or **services** that it provides :\n\n* **Medium of exchange**: Money’s most important function is as a medium of exchange to ease transactions.

I couldn’t believe it. It took me less than 5 min :\n\n* I went on Youtube\n* Research “How to create a coin with Ethereum”\n* I watched the tutorial\n* Click on the Github link\n* Copy the code\n* Paste it on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)\n* I change the name of the token\n* Define the max supply, the abbreviation of the token name, the divisibility, and leave the rest unchanged.\n\nDone. I compile it. No error.\n\nNow, I connect my Metamask and it was ready to deploy.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t have enough Ethereum to pay gas fees.\n\nBut I had the option to test the coin on Kovan Test Network. I was working well. I sent some tokens to different wallets.\n\nI was like “WOW, this is the next thing”.\n\nDo you see how easy it was to create a token in under 5 min, with an open-source program?\n\nNow imagine if you could code some characteristics of a photo :\n\n* Color\n* Dimension\n* Design\n* Traits\n\nThe result you get after you launch the smart contract is a ***Non-fungible-token***, a representation of that UNIQUE photo in the blockchain.\n\nThe term “fungible” indicates that the value of each item is uniform, mutually interchangeable with one another, and divisible.\n\nNow imagine what you can represent (or in the technical word “tokenized”): real estate, piece of art…\n\nEverything valuable can be tokenized and mint (launch) on the blockchain.\n\n## The characteristic of NFTs\n\n* It’s permanent. (like everything in the blockchain)\n* Cannot be replicated. (hence the term non-fungible)\n* Cannot be counterfeited. (there is only one model linked to one address)\n* One that proves that they own it (using blockchain explorer)\n\nOMG…!!!!!!!!!\n\nI now have my solution to buy an artwork for my friend… With a little added value: the value can be appreciating over time.\n\nWhat? What? Whaaaaaaaat? Oh yes, NFTs can be sold in open marketplace like Opensea, Rarible, Foundation… My friend may decide to sell it if she has financial worries.\n\nDo you remember my wish for artwork:\n\n* Digitalized\n* Sharable\n* Authentified\n* Preserved\n\nAnd now, VALUABLE.\n\nThis is a revolution for digital artists and collectors.\n\nNow, you are wondering: How can I benefit from this revolution?\n\nIt depends on whether you are an **artist**, **collector**, **hodlers** (you hold the asset and then sold it later for a profit), and **flippers**.\n\nI will start with the collectors, hodlers, and flippers. Let's startup with the basics.\n\n## What makes NFTs valuable?\n\nSupply and demand.\n\nDo you remember [the shortage of paper-toilet during COVID-19?](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2020/05/coronavirus-toilet-paper-shortage/)\n\nThat’s exactly that.\n\nWhen demand for a popular NFT is high and the supply low, prices gonna Skyrock (Watch here: [Cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks))\n\nThe other way round is also true: When supply is high and demand low, the price will drop.\n\nNow, let’s go deeper than that: WHY would you buy NFTs?\n\nAfter almost 9 months of watching the space, let me tell you this: **Market fluctuates**. What does it mean? It means you can buy and hold a piece of art, and one day or another, the price drops drastically from your entry price.\n\nBecause you are not alone in the whole market. You are ONE player in the market.\n\nThus, you have three choices when it comes to NFTs art pieces ( from a buyer perspective):\n\n* Buy and never intend to sell (collectors)\n* Buy to sell in few years for profit (hodlers)\n* Buy to flip quickly (flippers)\n\n## If you buy an NFT and never intend to sell it\n\nAs a collector, whether the price goes up or down, you don't care.\n\nYou like it. you hold it. And no one can take it from you, FOREVER.\n\n## If you buy an NFT to sell it in few years for profit\n\nLearn the space.\n\nWhy the original art piece of the \\*\\*Mona Lisa \\*\\*is so valuable?\n\nBecause :\n\n* it’s scarce\n* The artist is known worldwide: Léonardo de Vinci\n* The piece has a story\n\nI call it “the SAS model”. (Scarcity, Artist, Story)\n\nThe reason why [Beeple sold its piece for 69 million dollars](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million) is that his NFT is a collage of 5000 photos he did in 5000 days in a row. Yes… You heard me well… In a row.\n\nFor 14 years, Beeple is making a design every single day and post it on Instagram, Twitter, and its blog.\n\nIs this scarce? Yes. There is only one piece in the world.\n\nThe artist is well known? Yes. Over 2.2 million followers on Instagram. He has worked on concert visuals for Justin Bieber, One Direction, Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj, Eminem, Zedd, deadmau5, and many more.\n\nDoes the piece has a story? Yes. It’s 5000 first days of him making design, every single day. Such commitment and discipline are rare.\n\nYou can expect the guy buying the piece to sell it for much more in few years. And yes, [he has a plan](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/vignesh-sundaresan-known-as-metakovan-on-paying-69-million-for-beeple-nft.html).\n\nThink of it like you buy an Apple iPhone. You may say you bought it for the functionality, but deep inside it’s because of the prestige it gives you (mostly).\n\nSame here. The difference is that the NFT is an asset.\n\n## If you buy an NFT to flip it as fast as you can for profit\n\nLearn the space. Learn the basics of trading.\n\nIt’s a very basic rule: when to buy and when to sell.\n\n> **Timing a market is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.**\n\nAll the precedent rules apply (scarcity, artist, story) + timing.\n\n***Pro tip: Begin with recently listed, recently created, recently sold, or the highest last sale.***\n\n## **When to buy?**\n\nYou buy when you believe the item is UNDERVALUED.\n\nAn interesting thread from [Samuel Thompson](https://twitter.com/ImSamThompson) :\n\nExplore these three metrics :\n\n* Number of items\n* Floor price (lowest item price)\n* Volume traded\n\nNext, you want to look at SUPPLY & DEMAND.\n\nFind projects with HIGH VOLUME and LOW FLOOR. You can be more confident that the demand for these collections will move the floor price up.\n\nAVOID LOW VOLUME.\n\nThird, look at AVAILABLE ITEMS.\n\nIt’s harder to move the floor price on collections with over 10,000 items. Purchases on limited supply collections raise the floor faster.\n\nRaising the floor is where YOU MAKE MONEY.\n\n0\\.1 ETH is a floor price to have an eye on.\n\n***Pro tip: Have a separate account for flipping.***\n\n## **When to sell?**\n\nWhen the volume starts to shrink. Not the price, but the volume.\n\nLemme tell you : NFTs are **illiquid assets**. It means you can only sell if a buyer is willing to buy it at that exact price. It’s different from **liquid assets** like Bitcoin: you can place a sell order in an exchange, and 99% of the time, you will find a buyer.\n\nWhat’s gonna happen if the price is dropping and everyone is selling? You guessed it: no one wanna buy. And it keeps dipping (another way of saying dropping) until it’s reached 0.\n\n99% of chance bitcoin never reach 0, but 99% of chance of your NFTs dropping to 0 if you don't choose carefully.\n\nI used to trade, when I had 2X profit, I took my initial investment and let the rest ride, and take profits along the bull run.\n\nYou cannot do that with NFTs, at least for now.

", "body": "## 27 years ago, the first website for a band debuted in cyberspace\n\n*“The music industry’s first runaway hit on the web” — Interactive Age*\n\nThis is the story of how an unlikely threesome—a girl, a heavy metal band and their fans — pioneered the web at its infancy, bucked the status quo and proved that the Internet wasn’t a fad.\n\n**It’s 1994**. I’m working at Capitol Records in Hollywood, California.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1\\*3uWuMPCpGzv4K1TLTIS8tA.jpeg)\n\n*Pulp Fiction* was about to hit the box office and infiltrate pop culture with its timeless lines, some the music industry should have noted:\n\n“Look, do you wanna play blind man? Go walk with the shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fucking open.” —Jules Winnfield\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/576/1\\*vR6N7dm5y8u6kaXrECCvAg.jpeg)\n\nThe #1 song was “The Sign” by Ace of Base. They *saw the sign* and it *opened up their eyes.*\n\nPrince wouldn’t be partying for another 5 years.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/508/1\\*6dM9ADdLUiI34T8umrp2Bw.jpeg)\n\nAnd for the record business — well, they didn’t have anything to complain about. They printed money selling shiny plastic discs and virtually controlled everything from record stores to radio stations. Their marketing strategy of million dollar print, radio and TV campaigns was tried and true and as the saying goes, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It was the golden era of the music business and the good ‘ole boys, they liked to throw parties. I should know, I went to them.\n\nSo, during this “diamonds on the soles of their shoes” era, there was no vision for the future.\n\nThey didn’t think they needed one.\n\nAs for me, I had moved from Texas to Hollywood to pursue a glamorous career in rock & roll but things were going a lot slower than planned. After years of paying my dues as an assistant, I knew I needed to do something bold or I would be making photocopies and answering the phones for the rest of my career. This was the year that was  \\\\n finally gonna bring on the magic.\n\nWhat happened next was about to change music history.\n\n…………………………\n\n**This chain of events** started with a word that was soon to be all the rage: *multimedia*—a new way to combine music, video, graphics and interactivity using a computer.\n\nThe moment I realized that multimedia could revolutionize the way we could market our music came when a co-worker named Dave Goldberg showed me the first music video made with Macromedia Director—an interactive multimedia authoring tool. When I saw that video, I knew I had to hunt down the programmer. His name was Doug Textor, and he agreed to meet me for breakfast. I told him that I had all these ideas for using the computer to promote our bands but I didn’t know if it was technically possible yet. He said it was, although I don’t think he knew exactly what it entailed, but neither did anyone else at the time.\n\nOur harebrained concepts were put to the test when I was tasked with marketing the upcoming album releases for Frank Sinatra and Bonnie Raitt. Using Director, we created these hilarious-yet-primitive video games that my boss presented to the sales team while I operated the computer. Despite a few head scratches, the game broke new ground and we actually won an award.\n\nWe knew we were onto something…\n\n![Capitol Records Senior Vice President Lou Mann presents the Frank Sinatra Duets Game “Jeopairdy” to the Los Angeles Sales Branch 1994](https://miro.medium.com/max/6514/1\\*aEJGGmxOHfNzZQdj6WAjTw.jpeg?&&&size=large)\n\nAfter these multimedia presentations, I wanted to try some more experiments, as there was a blank canvas to innovate. Two online services, Prodigy and CompuServe, were quickly becoming popular and so were screensavers. We created one for the Beastie Boys and uploaded it into the software and gaming forums to see what would happen. We also put the screensavers on floppy disks with a whopping 1.5 meg of disk space, not even room for a single song.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1\\*e9GQJQBAii-iDdfyaIp39A.jpeg)\n\nAs the screensaver was getting momentum, I was about to get introduced to the Internet, thanks to a cousin I barely knew living in Silicon Valley. He was referred to in our family as a cocky computer genius who loved *his* Steve Jobs. One night we met up in San Francisco where he took me to his office, which was a startup before I even knew what startups were. He showed off his NeXT computer.\n\nThen he showed me this thing called… the World Wide Web.\n\nAnd I knew.\n\nHoly shit.\n\n*This is it.*\n\n## **The Hollywood Handshake**\n\nWhen I returned to Hollywood, I had to explore this spectacle further, but actually getting on the World Wide Web was a technical bitch. If you understood computers back then, you were described as “computer-literate.” But it was even difficult for us “literates” to understand the new world of TCP/IP, PPP, Gopher and Telnet. Since I had real job responsibilities during the day, I would spend my nights alone in the Capitol Tower, just trying to get that damn computer to dial up a modem, in hopes of being rewarded with that glorious sound of the modem connecting. Back then, we tech geeks called it “the handshake.”\n\nI failed, but was still determined.\n\nOne day, I got a memo in “interoffice mail.” I was invited to be on a task force for the upcoming Megadeth album *Youthanasia* and I was to attend the first brainstorming meeting.\n\nMe? Megadeth?\n\nHere’s what I knew about Megadeth: the lead singer, Dave Mustaine, was kicked out of Metallica, and then Megadeth went on to become the most respected heavy metal band of their time, second to Metallica.\n\nDuring the meeting, the executives stressed the importance of this album release, so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do something big and bold on the World Wide Web. Having never heard of the Internet, the record executives were like “yeah, whatever kid” and defaulted to the usual checklist: “Who will shoot the album cover? How many radio stations will play the single? How many posters should we print for the record stores?”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/778/1\\*RQZhV3TK37a-R7jI9gnPiw.gif)\n\nSo even though no one had a clue what I was talking about, I wrote a proposal to create a “virtual cybertown in cyberspace.” It would be called Megadeth, Arizona—based on where the band lived and recorded their album.\n\nMy boss, Lou Mann, the Senior Vice President of the label, actually signed off on the proposal and gave me a whopping $30 grand.\n\nHe had no idea what it was for, and I can guarantee you… *neither did I.*\n\n![In the proposal, I describe the Internet as consisting of “intelligent, upwardly mobile people” amongst other verbal atrocities. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RN4JsDEYu6wt7jA9w8Iel.jpeg?height=1419&width=2000)\n\nNow that I was funded, I corralled two of my co-workers to help create the site—Wendy Dougan, who was designing CD album packages in the art department, and Jane Bogart, the company copywriter for those full page ads that bands used to put in magazines.\n\n*They did not know what the Internet was either.*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*UGCUaYnD1gihIY8ESL9AGA.jpeg)\n\nWendy found a book on Roadside America that set the creative direction. We found a 1940’s postcard at a flea market that read “Greetings from Arizona.”\n\nJane came up with a tag line: Megadeth, Arizona: *You’ve never been anywhere like it.*\n\n![Yahoo’s homepage— originally called Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*Tki7PQ2QmQEaWtdawHWTkw.jpeg)\n\nThere were three main design options for the web at the time:\n\n1\\. Grey backgrounds\n\n2\\. Times Roman type\n\n3\\. Graphics were buttons\n\nFor content, we assumed a band website would offer the basics like news, music and video.\n\n**MEGABYTE NEWS** — band news\n\n**K-DETH 101** — :30 second music clips\n\n**THE DIGITAL DRIVE IN**—slow moving video clips\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*JCSSmKy6rt9IpnWa0Il8JA.jpeg)\n\nLike any town, we thought it should spread gossip, deliver the mail and conduct town meetings, so we created a few “Internet firsts” like:\n\nA CHATROOM— The Megadiner was the first chatroom for a band. Fans could chat with each other 24–7 and the band would frequently join in, unannounced.\n\nA DIGITAL POSTCARD—This was one of the first applications where one could send a graphic via email, which programmers told us was technically impossible. We took the Megadeth, Arizona postcard and added a form where you could type in a friend’s email address (if they had one, that is) and add a custom message: “Hey Bob! Greetings from Megadeth, Arizona. Wish you were here!” The idea for the digital postcard was inspired by a job I had selling greeting cards. (Who knew that job would come in handy?)\n\n![To promote the website, we made postcards and stickers, because that’s how traditional marketing was done — using people to pass out pieces of paper.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*3GEQaqEAfA8JbgIdjbiGNA.jpeg)\n\nRight before the site launched, I started to panic. Is this any good? Is the band going to hate it? Will heavy metal fans revolt?\n\nBut at the same time, we didn’t think any of that mattered, because we didn’t think anyone would even see it.\n\nThen we went live.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*xoAVHI-Lsol3blnMXn0Siw.jpeg)\n\nEven though I was sure about the web’s potential, I couldn’t even begin to predict what was about to happen. It was the people who came to the site and populated it that made the technology come alive.\n\nAfter that, everything took a life of its own.\n\n…….\n\n## The Flying Roasters\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*KarcDOzvkT8Pom4yddP9YQ.jpeg)\n\nWhen the site hit the mainstream, it got the attention of Starbucks. Company CEO, Howard Shultz and his executive team asked to meet with Capitol Records to see what they could learn, so that they too could have a website. I presented a screensaver called The Flying Roasters, which paid homage to the most popular screensaver at the time—The Flying Toasters. We took Starbucks coffee bags, added wings and had them fly across the home screen to the song “Cantaloop” by US3. During the presentation, Howard, who clearly had visions of the future dancin’ in his head, grabbed my arm and nearly pulled me onto the floor. He grabbed all of the screensavers off the conference room table and tried to squeeze them into his top shirt pocket.\n\nIt took outside validation from Starbucks for the Capitol executives to see that our own company was leading the way.\n\nBy the time Howard had touched down in Seattle, my salary had doubled.\n\n## ‘Til Deth Do We (Didn’t) Part\n\nAt the height of Megadeth, Arizona’s popularity, Capitol wanted to close down the site because the band’s album cycle was ending—still living in a world of limited promotional flights and expiring campaigns. Can you imagine shutting down a popular site today?\n\n![Interactive Age 1995. I pitched this story about the fans “rebelling,” in hopes that Capitol would let me keep the site up.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PDTLvE9akYIbFrMUt3zFig.jpeg)\n\n## Things We Never Could Have Predicted About Megadeth, Arizona\n\n## 1. The site drove interest in computers\n\nWe got emails from people telling us that the site inspired them to buy computers, modems or get Internet connections.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1284/1\\*ZsXfZ3XEKHiW_y8N9KBdug.jpeg)\n\n## 2. The site helped put the Internet on the mainstream media’s radar\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1256/1\\*_QwORul9rv3QYUzQ4ZlWtw.png)\n\n## 3. Megadeth, Arizona opened the door for bands to market on the Internet\n\n“This groundbreaking site set the tone for artist sites to come.” *— Music Connection*\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/864/1\\*MDzmdrMzL1prr1p7ZSdFpw.png)\n\n## 4. This Internet thing—it’s global!\n\n![ I still have no idea what this says.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FXYo7wETKQRntrDFYpWmFw.jpeg)\n\n## 5. This would be the birth of social media\n\n“One of the first online communities”— *LA Times*\n\n“One of the first webchats” — Wired\n\nThe site gave the fans the ability to talk to each other, meet one another in person and bond all based on a common interest — *their favorite band*. Some dated and got married. A woman complained she got “the clap” from another fan after they advanced their relationship from the web to the real world. Whoops, sorry. We’re not liable!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1282/1\\*cF-zqri8-QhhZChWQUTk7w.jpeg)\n\n## 6. Unprecedented access to celebrities\n\n“Dave Mustaine used the web to reach out to his fans—but that brought its own complications. When he first ventured into his site’s chatroom, none of the fans believed he was who he said he was. Once they realized it was him, they wouldn’t leave him alone.” —Rolling Stone\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*56j_OlHfoPIZgR0vIhiaDg.jpeg)\n\nBack then, the rock star was bigger than life—distant and inaccessible. The site allowed the band to interact with a large number of fans at once—raw, intimate and unfiltered. For the fans, being able to chat with the band seemed so unbelievable at first, that they would put them through a verification process.\n\n![The Megadiner chatroom transcript. Fans grilling Dave Mustaine (megaman) to verify his identity.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*4GlS2DfGoGyBTDwYY8_bXQ.png)\n\n![Electronic Entertainment / July 1995](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*eT0tP6IHo1mDPyYHGs55Eg.jpeg)\n\nThe band also rallied their fans to help with various missions, motivating them with a digital name — The CyberArmy. These are all early examples of how social media is used today.\n\n## 7. The beginning of “going viral”\n\nI didn’t realize while creating the digital postcard, that when people would send one to a friend — their friend would also learn about the website. You could create one digital master of a concept, and people could spread the word for you— as if it was *their* idea. Goodbye print marketing, hello digital.\n\n## 8. The band were pioneers too\n\n“It’s the Wild, Wild West but we think we should go for it.”— *Megadeth*\n\nThe band embraced the website immediately and jumped right in. They were already into computers, so they were able to speak articulately about the web, which they viewed as a “modern version of tape trading.”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/988/1\\*x_QR3cb6EFT44xgknzN91w.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1010/1\\*znCkJ8TEWKH-UKbPFcs-Gg.png)\n\n**My proudest memory** of Megadeth, Arizona, was that the early site adopters, the band and the fans, myself and my web team and the early journalists—*together*, we made people believe that the Internet was here to stay.\n\n*And it did.*\n\nIf you are reading this story twenty years later and you were one of the early adopters of our town, we have frequently wondered if you’re still out there floating in cyberspace—albeit at a faster speed.\n\nIn 1994, no one could have predicted all the ways that we’d be using technology today. So imagine what you can create in the next 20 years.\n\nJust start somewhere. Believe and make others believe!\n\n![You see, this profession is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

{"id": "jhdiUf5Yo0L4HJzVRirx0F9kFgxS0I9kmztz47m-Q_E", "title": "Web3's Not So Secret Weapon ", "body": "The open secret to Web3’s growth is its power to manifest self fulfilling prophecies. How? By enlisting **Mission Driven Users (MDUs)**. Let me elaborate with a thought experiment.\n\n### The A Side\n\nImagine you, my esteemed reader, have a start-up idea. You want to disrupt an existing online marketplace by setting up one that charges less than half the take-rate on transactions. How? Your plan is to lean on [financial viral loops](https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-loops) as your only growth engine. Your bet is that you can then minimize spend on other sales and marketing and *voila*: your blended CAC is slashed. Well, you’d be unlikely to progress much further than a ppt deck. Financial viral loops are [standard practice](https://www.reforge.com/brief/5-ways-to-create-viral-products#iBIwEkeVfOFmteqzNhcxCw). You won’t crack a sustainable advantage with them, even IF you manage to solve the cold start problem. You would have a tough time convincing investors. Or even entice your discerning users with a lower take rate promise. The A side is not all the exciting.\n\n### The B Side\n\nIn walks [web3](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1444072365822857219?s=20).\n\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201625590779909](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201625590779909)\n\nYou can now use code to reward ‘equity’ in exchange for valuable user actions. At scale! So you take your deck and update it. Instead of selling equity to VCs and using the proceeds to fund a referral program; you bypass the middleman and offer the equity directly to your user base. Seems like a subtle change at first. You wonder if it would even fundamentally change your unit economics assumptions.\n\nYet, the B-side uplift could be profound.\n\n### What’s the uplift hypothesis?\n\nTo start with, you now have a powerful narrative to rally users: *a low-cost marketplace owned and governed by those who help create it*.\n\nMuch more moving than *“I will offer you 10% instead of 25%”.*\n\nWhen your users buy into your vision, they pay more attention to what they can do to help you. Not solely out of the generosity of their spirits. They know that helping you earns them your equity. They can unlock asymmetric returns that until now have been inaccessible to all but a selected few founders and VCs. **The narrative, the agency and the motive are the three powerful ingredients that give you your secret weapon: Mission Driven Users (MDUs).**\n\nMDUs have a lot of similarities to early employees of a mission driven company. They go above and beyond base expectations:\n\n* MDUs dig much deeper into their contact books and spend much more social capital to promote your marketplace compared to normal users. [Braintrust](https://www.usebraintrust.com/) - the first user-owned talent marketplace (and one of the most intriguing non finance web3 projects) - has created a global community of [700k freelancers](https://www.usebraintrust.com/blog/growth-report-24) (pending confirmation) and $35m in gross service volume run rate one year after launch with “[zero marketing dollars spent outside their referral engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6upkcecUpE)”\n* MDUs are stickier and more forgiving. Look at the passion with which the Ethereum developer ecosystem perseveres despite persistent challenges around [scalability, cost and volatil](https://www.notboring.co/p/own-the-internet)ity. Keeping with the Braintrust example, the “website feedback” channel on its [Discord Serve](https://discord.gg/rgUS9aHFCB)r is filled with constructive feedback from its 45k members\n* MDUs may even contribute to the operations. In Braintrust, community members participate in day to day operations by [vetting talent, creating L&D content, or even contributing code to the development of the platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6upkcecUpE)\n\nIn short, MDUs reduce your CAC, increase your LTV and improve your operating leverage. You just might be able to slash your take rate after all. Your marketplace is starting to look disruptive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/whuy8lbBb4OAyeuKKXnOO.png?height=1423&width=2880)\n\n### Of course there is always a ‘but’\n\nBefore rushing out to start your user owned marketplace - there are a few points to worth considering:\n\n1. *Equity incentives might not resonate in all corners of the market.* A more risk-averse user persona (e.g. freelance lawyer or management consultants) or more cash strapped ones (eg [ride hailing drivers](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/02/mit-study-shows-how-much-driving-for-uber-or-lyft-sucks/) pre pandemic) may put more value on cash today than the equity you offer them. If cash is worth more to your users, it would be harder to align incentives for the long term and beyond an initial transaction. And financial user incentives in general may not be appropriate at all in some corners: enterprise users or public sector employees\n2. *The MDU effect may wear off at scale.* When your tokens are accessible by everyone and you’ve scaled to a certain point; your MDU effect is likely to wear off. Your users won’t have privileged access to the upside. And the upside is more limited now. And they will have less incremental impact in helping you grow further. At some point owning a Braintrust token will not be dissimilar to owning a Fiverr stock with more influence. So you would have to make sure you have other growth engines in place by then to sustain your advantage\n3. *Tokens are not free.* Tokens can be many things: utility tokens (similar to loyalty points, usable within the ecosystem) or governance tokens (similar to equities and tradable for cash usually). But they are not free. The former has an opportunity cost of lost revenue in one way or another. The latter is the equity you have sold to your user instead of an investor. The challenge you will face in both scenarios is that it is very difficult for an early stage project to put a dollar amount on these and make informed decisions on your spend\n4. *Your valuation becomes a compounding loop.* As your valuation grows, your MDUs are more incentivized to help you grow, and their actions help grow your marketplace which in turn leads to your valuation increasing. A virtuous cycle that’s missing in traditional companies. But the reverse will also be true. Crypto market trends push your valuations down. Your MDUs may become less inclined to earn your tokens. Your growth engine slows. Your marketplace is now worth less. Your MDUs are even less excited to help you grow the marketplace\n5. *Token issuance could become more strictly regulated in the US.* There is some uncertainty about what type of token would the [SEC consider an equity](https://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mendelson_20180129.pdf). The stricter the SEC’s interpretation of the Howey Test vis-a-vis tokens is, the more cost prohibitive it would be for you to use tokens as an answer to your cold start problem\n\n### Should you be taking this experiment?\n\nAll the said, will your marketplace be as disruptive as your pitchdeck claims? The answer is a very confident: maybe! Nuance is definitely less exciting, but hopefully more compelling.\n\nBut here’s a checklist that might help you assess if your marketplace lands on the ‘yes’ side of the spectrum:\n\n* Is equity (ie promise of asymmetric returns at a future date) a meaningful incentive for your users?\n* Do you have a compelling narrative to capture their imagination?\n* Do you have a clear set of actions they can perform to help (and earn your tokens)?\n* Do you have some initial ideas on how to sustain an edge once you scale and your MDUs naturally transition into being just ‘U’s\n\nTick these boxes and dive in.

{"id": "zSMNquIGXzUZ7cwSpKU8dpeRhkC3gbqTJl9VXJActiY", "title": "Web3's Not So Secret Weapon ", "body": "The open secret to Web3’s growth is its power to manifest self fulfilling prophecies. How? By enlisting **Mission Driven Users (MDUs)**. Let me elaborate with a thought experiment.\n\n### The A Side\n\nImagine you, my esteemed reader, have a start-up idea. You want to disrupt an existing online marketplace by setting up one that charges less than half the take-rate on transactions. How? Your plan is to lean on [financial viral loops](https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-loops) as your only growth engine. Your bet is that you can then minimize spend on other sales and marketing and *voila*: your blended CAC is slashed. Well, you’d be unlikely to progress much further than a ppt deck. Financial viral loops are [standard practice](https://www.reforge.com/brief/5-ways-to-create-viral-products#iBIwEkeVfOFmteqzNhcxCw). You won’t crack a sustainable advantage with them, even IF you manage to solve the cold start problem. You would have a tough time convincing investors. Or even entice your discerning users with a lower take rate promise. The A side is not all the exciting.\n\n### The B Side\n\nIn walks [web3](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1444072365822857219?s=20).\n\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201625590779909](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201625590779909)\n\nYou can now use code to reward ‘equity’ in exchange for valuable user actions. At scale! So you take your deck and update it. Instead of selling equity to VCs and using the proceeds to fund a referral program; you bypass the middleman and offer the equity directly to your user base. Seems like a subtle change at first. You wonder if it would even fundamentally change your unit economics assumptions.\n\nYet, the B-side uplift could be profound.\n\n### What’s the uplift hypothesis?\n\nTo start with, you now have a powerful narrative to rally users: *a low-cost marketplace owned and governed by those who help create it*.\n\nMuch more moving than *“I will offer you 10% instead of 25%”.*\n\nWhen your users buy into your vision, they pay more attention to what they can do to help you. Not solely out of the generosity of their spirits. They know that helping you earns them your equity. They can unlock asymmetric returns that until now have been inaccessible to all but a selected few founders and VCs. **The narrative, the agency and the motive are the three powerful ingredients that give you your secret weapon: Mission Driven Users (MDUs).**\n\nMDUs have a lot of similarities to early employees of a mission driven company. They go above and beyond base expectations:\n\n* MDUs dig much deeper into their contact books and spend much more social capital to promote your marketplace compared to normal users. [Braintrust](https://www.usebraintrust.com/) - the first user-owned talent marketplace (and one of the most intriguing non finance web3 projects) - has created a global community of [700k freelancers](https://www.usebraintrust.com/blog/growth-report-24) (pending confirmation) and $35m in gross service volume run rate one year after launch with “[zero marketing dollars spent outside their referral engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6upkcecUpE)”\n* MDUs are stickier and more forgiving. Look at the passion with which the Ethereum developer ecosystem perseveres despite persistent challenges around [scalability, cost and volatil](https://www.notboring.co/p/own-the-internet)ity. Keeping with the Braintrust example, the “website feedback” channel on its [Discord Serve](https://discord.gg/rgUS9aHFCB)r is filled with constructive feedback from its 45k members\n* MDUs may even contribute to the operations. In Braintrust, community members participate in day to day operations by [vetting talent, creating L&D content, or even contributing code to the development of the platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6upkcecUpE)\n\nIn short, MDUs reduce your CAC, increase your LTV and improve your operating leverage. You just might be able to slash your take rate after all. Your marketplace is starting to look disruptive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/whuy8lbBb4OAyeuKKXnOO.png?height=1423&width=2880)\n\n### Of course there is always a ‘but’\n\nBefore rushing out to start your user owned marketplace - there are a few points to worth considering:\n\n1. *Equity incentives might not resonate in all corners of the market.* A more risk-averse user persona (e.g. freelance lawyer or management consultants) or more cash strapped ones (eg [ride hailing drivers](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/02/mit-study-shows-how-much-driving-for-uber-or-lyft-sucks/) pre pandemic) may put more value on cash today than the equity you offer them. If cash is worth more to your users, it would be harder to align incentives for the long term and beyond an initial transaction. And financial user incentives in general may not be appropriate at all in some corners: enterprise users or public sector employees\n2. *The MDU effect may wear off at scale.* When your tokens are accessible by everyone and you’ve scaled to a certain point; your MDU effect is likely to wear off. Your users won’t have privileged access to the upside. And the upside is more limited now. And they will have less incremental impact in helping you grow further. At some point owning a Braintrust token will not be dissimilar to owning a Fiverr stock with more influence. So you would have to make sure you have other growth engines in place by then to sustain your advantage\n3. *Tokens are not free.* Tokens can be many things: utility tokens (similar to loyalty points, usable within the ecosystem) or governance tokens (similar to equities and tradable for cash usually). But they are not free. The former has an opportunity cost of lost revenue in one way or another. The latter is the equity you have sold to your user instead of an investor. The challenge you will face in both scenarios is that it is very difficult for an early stage project to put a dollar amount on these and make informed decisions on your spend\n4. *Your valuation becomes a compounding loop.* As your valuation grows, your MDUs are more incentivized to help you grow, and their actions help grow your marketplace which in turn leads to your valuation increasing. A virtuous cycle that’s missing in traditional companies. But the reverse will also be true. Crypto market trends push your valuations down. Your MDUs may become less inclined to earn your tokens. Your growth engine slows. Your marketplace is now worth less. Your MDUs are even less excited to help you grow the marketplace\n5. *Token issuance could become more strictly regulated in the US.* There is some uncertainty about what type of token would the [SEC consider an equity](https://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mendelson_20180129.pdf). The stricter the SEC’s interpretation of the Howey Test vis-a-vis tokens is, the more cost prohibitive it would be for you to use tokens as an answer to your cold start problem\n\n### Should you be taking this experiment?\n\nAll the said, will your marketplace be as disruptive as your pitchdeck claims? The answer is a very confident: maybe! Nuance is definitely less exciting, but hopefully more compelling.\n\nBut here’s a checklist that might help you assess if your marketplace lands on the ‘yes’ side of the spectrum:\n\n* Is equity (ie promise of asymmetric returns at a future date) a meaningful incentive for your users?\n* Do you have a compelling narrative to capture their imagination?\n* Do you have a clear set of actions they can perform to help (and earn your tokens)?\n* Do you have some initial ideas on how to sustain an edge once you scale and your MDUs naturally transition into being just ‘U’s\n\nTick these boxes and dive in. Web3’s potential is mind bending and it’s by no means limited to user owned marketplaces.\n\nOr if you want to learn more, here is a non-exhaustive list of resources I found very helpful:\n\n* Educational material: [Andreessen Horrowitz Crypto Start-up School](https://a16z.com/crypto-startup-school/)\n* Books: [Token Economy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54222022-token-economy), [Blockchain Basics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34137265-blockchain-basics), or [The Infinite Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50175330-the-infinite-machine)\n* Join [SeedClub’s Discord](https://discord.gg/42UjJskuEF)\n* Packy McCormick’s Essays on [Ethereum](https://www.notboring.co/p/own-the-internet), [Solana](https://www.notboring.co/p/solana-summer), and [DAOs](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-cooperation-economy-)\n* Listen to [The Defiant](https://thedefiant.io/podcast/) or [The Bankless](http://podcast.banklesshq.com/) podcasts\n\n### About Me\n\nI’ve spent the past seven years building and scaling marketplaces in product or leadership roles.

{"id": "6imK3DCeYaWLq4IpSTB-KISWdaJrreo5YtO9B4iP_wI", "title": "Beginner guide for first-time NFTs buyers (2021) ", "body": "When I was in Dakar, I visited a place called “Soumbedioune Village”. I was preparing to travel to Hamburg/Germany, and I wanted to buy a gift for a friend. Because she invited me and three other members of my former startup. I wanted something special for her.\n\n![Soumbedioune village overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*0uSZcku1Nla6PGDq)\n\nThe items I found were amazing: artistic bags, bracelets, baskets, dresses… And the most interesting thing for me was the amazing artwork from local artists. It was so beautiful and amazing, even if some of them you can see the mark of time on them. I wanted them so much…\n\nBut, I had a problem:\n\nHow do I transport them to Hamburg?\n\nIt was not possible. I had no other choice, I had to find another item. Like the ones below, I bought some sculptures.\n\n![Small sculptures you can put in a suitcase](https://miro.medium.com/max/768/0\\*bfMbBoq_w54KmFpI)\n\nSince then, I have been asking… What if those artworks could be :\n\n* Digitized\n* Sharable\n* Authentified\n* Preserved\n\nIt would be more “transportable”.\n\nIt took me two years to figure out a solution: NFTs\n\n## A brief history\n\nIn 2008, an anonymous person called Satoshi Nakamoto to launch Bitcoin. It’s money on the Internet, without banks, without a middle man.\n\nFirst, what is money?\n\nMoney is often defined in terms of the three **functions** or **services** that it provides :\n\n* **Medium of exchange**: Money’s most important function is as a medium of exchange to ease transactions. Without money, all transactions would have to be conducted by **barter.** It involves the direct exchange of one good or service for another.\n* **Store of value:** To be a medium of exchange, money must hold its value over time; that is, it must be a store of value. Otherwise, money could not be stored for some period and remain valuable in exchange.\n* **Unit of account**: Money also functions as a unit of account, providing a *common measure of the value* of goods and services being exchanged.\n\nHow did Satoshi manage to create “Internet money” with these functions?\n\nHe leveraged something called **Blockchain**.\n\nBlockchain is a register where every transaction is recorded. Its characteristics :\n\n* **Immutability**: No possibility to make a change on the register once data is in the ledger.\n* **Decentralized**: No one owns the technology, it’s shared among the users.\n* **Anonymity**: You don’t need to give your credentials, a random password is given to you only.\n* **Security**: It’s almost impossible to hack because of the density of the network.\n\nWith these, Satoshi made Bitcoin. No possibility to double spend. A store of value. A medium of exchange. A unit of account. All combined using blockchain and cryptography.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin is exploding. After 13 years, a unit of bitcoin is now worth between $30k and $65k depending on the demand.\n\nIn 2015, a group of 8 persons figured out they can do more things with the blockchain: ***they can build some kind of contract on top of it***.\n\nGiven the fact that the blockchain is a register, what you put on it depends on the writer of the code. If they can figure out a way to codify functions and put it on the blockchain, they will have another use case.\n\nAnd they made it. Ethereum was born.\n\nYou can create your coin(or token) like Bitcoin, determine the max supply, and release it in under 5 min, using something called **“Smart contract”**: lines of codes you write and deploy on the blockchain.\n\nIn January 2021, I programmed my first token I called “Wetchit” which means “spare change”. I couldn’t believe it. It took me less than 5 min :\n\n* I went on Youtube\n* Research “How to create a coin with Ethereum”\n* I watched the tutorial\n* Click on the Github link\n* Copy the code\n* Paste it on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)\n* I change the name of the token\n* Define the max supply, the abbreviation of the token name, the divisibility, and leave the rest unchanged.\n\nDone. I compile it. No error.\n\nNow, I connect my Metamask and it was ready to deploy.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t have enough Ethereum to pay gas fees.\n\nBut I had the option to test the coin on Kovan Test Network. I was working well. I sent some tokens to different wallets.\n\nI was like “WOW, this is the next thing”.\n\nDo you see how easy it was to create a token in under 5 min, with an open-source program?\n\nNow imagine if you could code some characteristics of a photo :\n\n* Color\n* Dimension\n* Design\n* Traits\n\nThe result you get after you launch the smart contract is a ***Non-fungible-token***, a representation of that UNIQUE photo in the blockchain.\n\nThe term “fungible” indicates that the value of each item is uniform, mutually interchangeable with one another, and divisible.\n\nNow imagine what you can represent (or in the technical word “tokenized”): real estate, piece of art…\n\nEverything valuable can be tokenized and mint (launch) on the blockchain.\n\n## The characteristic of NFTs\n\n* It’s permanent. (like everything in the blockchain)\n* Cannot be replicated. (hence the term non-fungible)\n* Cannot be counterfeited. (there is only one model linked to one address)\n* One that proves that they own it (using blockchain explorer)\n\nOMG…!!!!!!!!!\n\nI now have my solution to buy an artwork for my friend… With a little added value: the value can be appreciating over time.\n\nWhat? What? Whaaaaaaaat? Oh yes, NFTs can be sold in open marketplace like Opensea, Rarible, Foundation… My friend may decide to sell it if she has financial worries.\n\nDo you remember my wish for artwork:\n\n* Digitalized\n* Sharable\n* Authentified\n* Preserved\n\nAnd now, VALUABLE.\n\nThis is a revolution for digital artists and collectors.\n\nNow, you are wondering: How can I benefit from this revolution?\n\nIt depends on whether you are an **artist**, **collector**, **hodlers** (you hold the asset and then sold it later for a profit), and **flippers**.\n\nI will start with the collectors, hodlers, and flippers. Let's startup with the basics.\n\n## What makes NFTs valuable?\n\nSupply and demand.\n\nDo you remember [the shortage of paper-toilet during COVID-19?](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2020/05/coronavirus-toilet-paper-shortage/)\n\nThat’s exactly that.\n\nWhen demand for a popular NFT is high and the supply low, prices gonna Skyrock (Watch here: [Cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks))\n\nThe other way round is also true: When supply is high and demand low, the price will drop.\n\nNow, let’s go deeper than that: WHY would you buy NFTs?\n\nAfter almost 9 months of watching the space, let me tell you this: **Market fluctuates**. What does it mean? It means you can buy and hold a piece of art, and one day or another, the price drops drastically from your entry price.\n\nBecause you are not alone in the whole market. You are ONE player in the market.\n\nThus, you have three choices when it comes to NFTs art pieces ( from a buyer perspective):\n\n* Buy and never intend to sell (collectors)\n* Buy to sell in few years for profit (hodlers)\n* Buy to flip quickly (flippers)\n\n## If you buy an NFT and never intend to sell it\n\nAs a collector, whether the price goes up or down, you don't care.\n\nYou like it. you hold it. And no one can take it from you, FOREVER.\n\n## If you buy an NFT to sell it in few years for profit\n\nLearn the space.\n\nWhy the original art piece of the \\*\\*Mona Lisa \\*\\*is so valuable?\n\nBecause :\n\n* it’s scarce\n* The artist is known worldwide: Léonardo de Vinci\n* The piece has a story\n\nI call it “the SAS model”. (Scarcity, Artist, Story)\n\nThe reason why [Beeple sold its piece for 69 million dollars](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million) is that his NFT is a collage of 5000 photos he did in 5000 days in a row. Yes… You heard me well… In a row.\n\nFor 14 years, Beeple is making a design every single day and post it on Instagram, Twitter, and its blog.\n\nIs this scarce? Yes. There is only one piece in the world.\n\nThe artist is well known? Yes. Over 2.2 million followers on Instagram. He has worked on concert visuals for Justin Bieber, One Direction, Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj, Eminem, Zedd, deadmau5, and many more.\n\nDoes the piece has a story? Yes. It’s 5000 first days of him making design, every single day. Such commitment and discipline are rare.\n\nYou can expect the guy buying the piece to sell it for much more in few years. And yes, [he has a plan](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/vignesh-sundaresan-known-as-metakovan-on-paying-69-million-for-beeple-nft.html).\n\nThink of it like you buy an Apple iPhone. You may say you bought it for the functionality, but deep inside it’s because of the prestige it gives you (mostly).\n\nSame here. The difference is that the NFT is an asset.\n\n## If you buy an NFT to flip it as fast as you can for profit\n\nLearn the space. Learn the basics of trading.\n\nIt’s a very basic rule: when to buy and when to sell.\n\n> **Timing a market is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.**\n\nAll the precedent rules apply (scarcity, artist, story) + timing.\n\n***Pro tip: Begin with recently listed, recently created, recently sold, or the highest last sale.***\n\n## **When to buy?**\n\nYou buy when you believe the item is UNDERVALUED.\n\nAn interesting thread from [Samuel Thompson](https://twitter.com/ImSamThompson) :\n\nExplore these three metrics :\n\n* Number of items\n* Floor price (lowest item price)\n* Volume traded\n\nNext, you want to look at SUPPLY & DEMAND.\n\nFind projects with HIGH VOLUME and LOW FLOOR. You can be more confident that the demand for these collections will move the floor price up.\n\nAVOID LOW VOLUME.\n\nThird, look at AVAILABLE ITEMS.\n\nIt’s harder to move the floor price on collections with over 10,000 items. Purchases on limited supply collections raise the floor faster.\n\nRaising the floor is where YOU MAKE MONEY.\n\n0\\.1 ETH is a floor price to have an eye on.\n\n***Pro tip: Have a separate account for flipping.***\n\n## **When to sell?**\n\nWhen the volume starts to shrink. Not the price, but the volume.\n\nLemme tell you : NFTs are **illiquid assets**. It means you can only sell if a buyer is willing to buy it at that exact price. It’s different from **liquid assets** like Bitcoin: you can place a sell order in an exchange, and 99% of the time, you will find a buyer.\n\nWhat’s gonna happen if the price is dropping and everyone is selling? You guessed it: no one wanna buy. And it keeps dipping (another way of saying dropping) until it’s reached 0.\n\n99% of chance bitcoin never reach 0, but 99% of chance of your NFTs dropping to 0 if you don't choose carefully.\n\nI used to trade, when I had 2X profit, I took my initial investment and let the rest ride, and take profits along the bull run.\n\nYou cannot do that with NFTs, at least for now. Seems like [people are working on it.](https://www.cryptovantage.com/non-fungible-tokens/what-are-fractionalized-nfts/)\n\n*Disclaimer*: As I said, it’s very very difficult to time a market. You will lose money. Flip at your own risk.\n\nI suggest you watch [this video from Alex Bucker about how to flip a NFT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIf2ecpTQ0A&t=1378s)\n\n## **Where do you start as a flipper?**\n\n\\*\\*\\*For first time beginners in crypto and trading: \\*\\*\\*You will find the upcoming drop with these tools :\n\n*[rarity](http://rarity.tools/)*\n\n*[nftcalendar](http://nftcalendar.io/)*\n\n*[non-fungi](http://non-fungi.com/)*\n\n***For more resourceful users :***\n\n[Dune Analytics of most bought collections by 500 most successful traders](https://dune.xyz/bitereum/Opensea-Top-Traders)\n\nThere, you will find the list of collections 500 traders often buy.\n\nOr you check to track the floor price [here](https://dune.xyz/smaroo/NFT-Floor-Trackers):\n\nWhat you are looking for are collections with low price floor and HIGH volume.

The crypto-currency market is exploding, Bitcoin has gone mainstream, with over 221 million people investing in it by June 2021, according to the latest report from Crypto.com.When you start your research, you’ll realize that no blog has done a census of all the tools and resources you’ll need to start the experiment. This article will make your life easier.\n\nBitcoin, launched in 2009 by one Satoshi Nakamoto, has since taken off. When I started my research, its value was $30,000 per bitcoin. As of this writing, it is at $48,000 with a peak in April 2021 of $65,000 per bitcoin. What do these figures mean in concrete terms? If you invested $1000 in December 2020, you will end up with $1600 now (August 2021), and $2166.67 at the time of the April 2021 peak. A good investment. A very good investment. But, to start investing, you have to understand what you are investing in. This is the basis.\n\n> The reason why many people have trouble understanding bitcoin is that you first have to understand what the blockchain is.\n\nThere’s a learning curve that you have to overcome to get the most out of your investments.

{"id": "S9RwV0s2OWLBHPfL1y7sQH3Thsrf4COY2Z8KmKa3W4c", "title": "Web3's Not So Secret Weapon ", "body": "The open secret to Web3’s growth is its power to manifest self fulfilling prophecies. How? By enlisting **Mission Driven Users (MDUs)**. Let me elaborate with a thought experiment.\n\n### The A Side\n\nImagine you, my esteemed reader, have a start-up idea. You want to disrupt an existing online marketplace by setting up one that charges less than half the take-rate on transactions. How? Your plan is to lean on [financial viral loops](https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-loops) as your only growth engine. Your bet is that you can then minimize spend on other sales and marketing and *voila*: your blended CAC is slashed. Well, you’d be unlikely to progress much further than a ppt deck. Financial viral loops are [standard practice](https://www.reforge.com/brief/5-ways-to-create-viral-products#iBIwEkeVfOFmteqzNhcxCw). You won’t crack a sustainable advantage with them, even IF you manage to solve the cold start problem. You would have a tough time convincing investors. Or even entice your discerning users with a lower take rate promise. The A side is not all the exciting.\n\n### The B Side\n\nIn walks [web3](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1444072365822857219?s=20).\n\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201625590779909](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201625590779909)\n\nYou can now use code to reward ‘equity’ in exchange for valuable user actions. At scale! So you take your deck and update it. Instead of selling equity to VCs and using the proceeds to fund a referral program; you bypass the middleman and offer the equity directly to your user base. Seems like a subtle change at first. You wonder if it would even fundamentally change your unit economics assumptions.\n\nYet, the B-side uplift could be profound.\n\n### What’s the uplift hypothesis?\n\nTo start with, you now have a powerful narrative to rally users: *a low-cost marketplace owned and governed by those who help create it*.\n\nMuch more moving than *“I will offer you 10% instead of 25%”.*\n\nWhen your users buy into your vision, they pay more attention to what they can do to help you. Not solely out of the generosity of their spirits. They know that helping you earns them your equity. They can unlock asymmetric returns that until now have been inaccessible to all but a selected few founders and VCs. **The narrative, the agency and the motive are the three powerful ingredients that give you your secret weapon: Mission Driven Users (MDUs).**\n\nMDUs have a lot of similarities to early employees of a mission driven company. They go above and beyond base expectations:\n\n* MDUs dig much deeper into their contact books and spend much more social capital to promote your marketplace compared to normal users. [Braintrust](https://www.usebraintrust.com/) - the first user-owned talent marketplace (and one of the most intriguing non finance web3 projects) - has created a global community of [700k freelancers](https://www.usebraintrust.com/blog/growth-report-24) (pending confirmation) and $35m in gross service volume run rate one year after launch with “[zero marketing dollars spent outside their referral engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6upkcecUpE)”\n* MDUs are stickier and more forgiving. Look at the passion with which the Ethereum developer ecosystem perseveres despite persistent challenges around [scalability, cost and volatil](https://www.notboring.co/p/own-the-internet)ity. Keeping with the Braintrust example, the “website feedback” channel on its [Discord Serve](https://discord.gg/rgUS9aHFCB)r is filled with constructive feedback from its 45k members\n* MDUs may even contribute to the operations. In Braintrust, community members participate in day to day operations by [vetting talent, creating L&D content, or even contributing code to the development of the platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6upkcecUpE)\n\nIn short, MDUs reduce your CAC, increase your LTV and improve your operating leverage. You just might be able to slash your take rate after all. Your marketplace is starting to look disruptive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/whuy8lbBb4OAyeuKKXnOO.png?height=1423&width=2880)\n\n### Of course there is always a ‘but’\n\nBefore rushing out to start your user owned marketplace - there are a few points to worth considering:\n\n1. *Equity incentives might not resonate in all corners of the market.* A more risk-averse user persona (e.g. freelance lawyer or management consultants) or more cash strapped ones (eg [ride hailing drivers](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/02/mit-study-shows-how-much-driving-for-uber-or-lyft-sucks/) pre pandemic) may put more value on cash today than the equity you offer them. If cash is worth more to your users, it would be harder to align incentives for the long term and beyond an initial transaction. And financial user incentives in general may not be appropriate at all in some corners: enterprise users or public sector employees\n2. *The MDU effect may wear off at scale.* When your tokens are accessible by everyone and you’ve scaled to a certain point; your MDU effect is likely to wear off. Your users won’t have privileged access to the upside. And the upside is more limited now. And they will have less incremental impact in helping you grow further. At some point owning a Braintrust token will not be dissimilar to owning a Fiverr stock with more influence. So you would have to make sure you have other growth engines in place by then to sustain your advantage\n3. *Tokens are not free.* Tokens can be many things: utility tokens (similar to loyalty points, usable within the ecosystem) or governance tokens (similar to equities and tradable for cash usually). But they are not free. The former has an opportunity cost of lost revenue in one way or another. The latter is the equity you have sold to your user instead of an investor. The challenge you will face in both scenarios is that it is very difficult for an early stage project to put a dollar amount on these and make informed decisions on your spend\n4. *Your valuation becomes a compounding loop.* As your valuation grows, your MDUs are more incentivized to help you grow, and their actions help grow your marketplace which in turn leads to your valuation increasing. A virtuous cycle that’s missing in traditional companies. But the reverse will also be true. Crypto market trends push your valuations down. Your MDUs may become less inclined to earn your tokens. Your growth engine slows. Your marketplace is now worth less. Your MDUs are even less excited to help you grow the marketplace\n5. *Token issuance could become more strictly regulated in the US.* There is some uncertainty about what type of token would the [SEC consider an equity](https://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mendelson_20180129.pdf). The stricter the SEC’s interpretation of the Howey Test vis-a-vis tokens is, the more cost prohibitive it would be for you to use tokens as an answer to your cold start problem\n\n### Should you be taking this experiment?\n\nAll the said, will your marketplace be as disruptive as your pitchdeck claims? The answer is a very confident: maybe! Nuance is definitely less exciting, but hopefully more compelling.\n\nBut here’s a checklist that might help you assess if your marketplace lands on the ‘yes’ side of the spectrum:\n\n* Is equity (ie promise of asymmetric returns at a future date) a meaningful incentive for your users?\n* Do you have a compelling narrative to capture their imagination?\n* Do you have a clear set of actions they can perform to help (and earn your tokens)?\n* Do you have some initial ideas on how to sustain an edge once you scale and your MDUs naturally transition into being just ‘U’s\n\nTick these boxes and dive in. Web3’s potential is mind bending and it’s by no means limited to user owned marketplaces.\n\nOr if you want to learn more, here is a non-exhaustive list of resources I found very helpful:\n\n* Educational material: [Andreessen Horrowitz Crypto Start-up School](https://a16z.com/crypto-startup-school/)\n* Books: [Token Economy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54222022-token-economy), [Blockchain Basics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34137265-blockchain-basics), or [The Infinite Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50175330-the-infinite-machine)\n* Join [SeedClub’s Discord](https://discord.gg/42UjJskuEF)\n* Packy McCormick’s Essays on [Ethereum](https://www.notboring.co/p/own-the-internet), [Solana](https://www.notboring.co/p/solana-summer), and [DAOs](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-cooperation-economy-)\n* Listen to [The Defiant](https://thedefiant.io/podcast/) or [The Bankless](http://podcast.banklesshq.com/) podcasts\n\n### About Me\n\nI’ve spent the past seven years building and scaling marketplaces in product or leadership roles.

{"id": "qh_GA9HzqngMnIwIi8h_NWaBBnKBgfesq0RH1T27FlI", "title": "分布式容错狂想曲", "body": "我，是一个普通的系统架构师。 在了解了区块链技术之后，感慨颇多。 本文仅仅代表本人观点亦或者想法。\n\n \n\n本篇文章最初发布在币呼的通证经济板块。 今天之所以整理后发到这里，第一是希望更多的人可以读到本文。 第二，也为我下一篇文章 **“柚子为什么比以太快--论确定性状态机的瓶颈与解决方案”**做一个预热。请大家不吝点赞！ \n\n \n\n**【1】单体**\n\n在互联网的前几年，我们倾向于把所有模块都放在一个容器里面运行。 这也就是我们经常说的单体应用。以一个基本的电商系统来说，一个单体应用里面可能包括了账户模块，订单模块，购物车模块，优惠模块，等等。\n\n \n\n但随着访问量的增加，单体应用已经不足以满足需求。 我们使用了LB来实现负载均衡，以单体应用为单位进行横向扩容。但是，这种扩容方式是有很大的浪费。 因为对于不同时段，不同场景。 各个模块的负载都是不一样的，有多又少，即我们没有办法做到更细粒度的针对性扩容。\n\n其次，随着代码库的变大， 代码以非常快的速度腐化着。 开发的人越多，共同维护一个代码库的冲突就会越多。 同时，由于模块直接没有明显的边界，各个模块非常强的耦合在一起。 整个代码就如同一个大泥球一般难以维护。\n\n \n\n更糟糕的是，在一个共享的单体应用里面，所有的请求都会照成内存和CPU资源的竞争。 比如，在抢购环节，也许订单和支付模块是负载最大的模块。 假设每个应用要100的资源。 那么2个就是200，考虑资源竞争，其实大于200。 假如它们是分开的，我们可以2个100的物理机承载负载。 但是，当它们合在一起的时候，我必须有一台可以满足至少250的机器才可以承载。而摩尔定律限制了纵向扩容，单体应用设定了整体负载均衡扩容的上限。\n\n \n\n单体应用的特定就是所有的服务都依赖于一个统一的平台。 共享一套代码库以及内存，CPU，IO这些资源。 \n\n \n\n人们必须小心的运维着，针对所有服务的需求小心的调整着各种参数。祈祷这个单体应用正常的运行。 \n\n \n\n同时，单体应用挂了，就意味着所有服务的不可用。 简单来说，整个网站挂掉。 这也就是我们说的容错性。 在不考虑负载均衡的情况下，单体系统没有容错性。 任何一个服务挂了，都会导致整个应用的不可用。\n\n \n\n**【2】分布**\n\n \n\n从单体应用转向分布式架构这个事情持续了几年。 当然，这里对分布式服务边界的划分，以及一致性提出了更多的要求。 \n\n \n\n但是，当我们把单体应用拆分成多个分布式服务之后。 我们发现，服务多了，在同一时间，总有服务可用或者不可用。 \n\n \n\n我们不像之前那么害怕一个服务挂掉。 因为任何一个服务挂了，整体系统还可用，或者只会出现部分不可用。 **虽然运维现在要管理的服务更多了，服务也总是会挂，但整体容错性却上升了**。\n\n \n\n**【3】集群**\n\n \n\n所有的区块链系统，或者说以比特币，以太，柚子为代表的**确定状态机系统**本质上可以看成是使用了不同共识算法的HA集群 （高可用集群）。 交易的打包生成区块，区块的同步让每个机器都有确定的历史。通过相同的代码，有确定历史的状态机都可以达到同样的结果。在这一点上，无论**中性化**还是**去中心的**HA集群都是同样的逻辑 （关于确定状态机也就是下一篇文章的重点）。\n\n \n\n我觉得区块链带来的东西很多，但对于我来说，特别要提到的就是用最终一致性的方式解决分叉问题而非比如Raft的强同步方式。 \n\n \n\n当然，还有一个，就是用经济学的方式保证了大部分节点是诚实的节点。 在本应该使用技术解决的地方，比特币引入了经济学，用非技术的方式解决了节点作恶问题。 \n\n \n\n比特币是一个完美的工程学+经济学融合方案，解决了去中心化共识问题。\n\n \n\n**【4】定义**\n\n \n\n这里先给出一个我对区块链的定义。 从广义上来说，无论底层使用的协议是什么，又或者区块组织结构是树亦或者图，区块链的最终目的就是实现去中心化的证明。或者说，所有实现了去中心化证明的技术，我们都叫它区块链。\n\n \n\n**【5】意义**\n\n \n\n去中心化证明有什么作用，或者说有什么意义呢 换一句话说，解决了什么问题。 这个问题是以前无法解决的呢？\n\n \n\n**去中心化证明可以解决一个以前无法解决的问题-即数据的去中心化剪切而不是复**制。 \n\n \n\n当数据发送复制了，我们叫它信息，那么，当数据发生剪切了，我们叫它什么呢？ 我觉得，叫它价值是一个非常直接的推论【注：我觉得通证是代替价值更好的词语】。 \n\n \n\n当然，也许有更好的名词。 所以基于以上推论，类比互联网解决了信息的去中心传递； **区块链的一个主要应用场景是实现价值的去中心化传递**（当然还有其他场景）**。** \n\n \n\n参考互联网，信息的去中心化带来了已经最可怕的事情就是**信息爆炸**。 那么，对于价值网络呢？ 价值会爆炸吗？？？ 在我看来这是必然的，这也是区块链带给这个社会最深远的变化。 未来一定会有各种各样的代币出现。\n\n \n\n但是那样的社会好像变得更加复杂了，不是吗？ 就比如信息时代也让人们也变得更加复杂了，低头族，手机党，我们平静的生活总是要被干扰，这到底是不是一种进步呢？ 有什么好处呢？ \n\n \n\n对于互联网，好处很明显。 因为没有了可以依靠的信息来源，人们必须变得更加可以独立思考了。 要是没有这个能力，很难在信息时代生存。 \n\n \n\n那么，对于价值网络呢？ 它让社会变得复杂了，好处呢？ 是进步吗？\n\n \n\n【6】**狂想**\n\n \n\n假如说比特币的成功是在工程学的基础上加入了经济学方法。 那么，反过来呢？ 经济学可以从工程学中学到什么？\n\n \n\n我们现在的整个以国家为单位的经济体制，就如同单体应用一般。 各个行业，各个群体，都依赖于单一的价值体系。 就如同单体应用在竞争统一的cpu内存一个道理。 \n\n \n\n假如是这个道理，那么，各行各业，各个群体，就是我们所谓的服务，这些服务每天都困恼于如何获得更多的内存和处理时间而相互制约。 效率，被大大降低了！\n\n \n\n我们的国家， 也必须如同运维人员一样，如履薄冰的来调节各种参数，也就是我了解的宏观调控，来避免整个价值体系崩塌引起的结构性问题。\n\n \n\n这是否以为着，是我们的经济体制太落后了，还处于“单体应用”这个阶段呢？\n\n \n\n我知道宏观调控对于单体系统的重要性，我也知道看着各种指标此消彼长没办法瞒住全部服务的困恼。 那么，假如区块链技术最终打破了这种情况。 让每一个个体，群体，行业，都可以有自己的价值体系。 会是什么结果呢？ \n\n \n\n参考互联网工程学的结果，有一个直观的推论就是，这会释放生产力，提高负载能力。因为竞争的资源被打破了。\n\n \n\n但这个好处隐含着另外一个可能就是，这些小经济体可能会因为配置错误或者其他原因很快的失败或者崩溃。 对的，就如同每天总是会有一些服务挂掉一样。 假如说一个经济体会很容易的破掉，的确是很令人不安的一件事情。\n\n \n\n但假如，我们以分布式系统容错的角度看待整个体系，会发现，虽然个体错误发生的概率提高了**，但是假如我们可以允许这些单发错误，整个系统的容错率随之上升。** ​\n\n \n\n所以，我的问题是\n\n \n\n有没有这种可能**，要是原来单体系统的奔溃是灾难性的，也就是所谓的经济危机。** 那么当我们把**经济单元缩小**后，虽然多元化后**个体危机会呈现上升趋势**，但是对于**群体性集体不可用的概率反而降低**了呢？ \n\n \n\n这个答案，应该留给经济学家讨论了。\n\n \n\n我坚信，未来各个学科互相学习，互相融合是发展的趋势。 我曾经和一个做游戏的朋友打趣到，你以后需要的不再是产品，开发，运营，美术了，你还需要经济学家和社会学家共同参与了。 \n\n \n\n**【6】脑洞** \n\n \n\n我个人很喜欢各学科融合，我也喜欢物理学。 \n\n \n\n爱因斯坦的广义相对论的最大发现是时间不是公共的。 每一个人都可以有自己的时间，只是因为我们的运动速度太低且基本相同（和光速对比），感觉大家时间相同罢了。这里虽然没有共识，但是却透着分布式时钟的概念。\n\n \n\n量子力学发现量子处于空间中的位置完全是概率决定，只是大部分时间，它看起来像在某个位置。 虽然个体量子的确处于概率状态，但是从整体来看，它的绝大部分会形成确定的历史，也就是我们现在看到的现实。\n\n \n\n**区块链带来了一种可能性，使用去中心化的方式，和最终一致性来选择历史树，是否也是这两者的结合呢？**\n\n \n\n最后，以很佛系的一句话来结束我在币户的第一篇系列文章\n\n \n\n**一花一世界，一叶一菩提**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YYPwuzWLndErWf7y_9-SJ.png?height=525&width=700)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633569538, "digest": "zIypdOFN-zh1NcDACignqs5anFC5uFqUqQvBuQpfJUk", "contributor": "0x9964596E9C341dAd0762d3B9819AA36D3047518E"}
{"id": "9nZ0_kFB62tZ86tjVCwp-njyGiqgCxKuJPeRLgQBQHk", "title": "连续性的幻觉", "body": "昨天看了一篇科幻小说，一直在考虑一个问题，自我意识的延续性和本质。 \n \n\n \n \n\n首先，说道自我意识，很容易容易扯到灵魂。 在这，我不想过多的讨论。当然对于我来说，灵魂肯定是不存在的。因为除了人类，所有智慧生物都有智慧，而高级智慧生物也会有自我认识。所以这个东西，明显不是人类的专属。\n\n \n \n\n真正让我感兴趣的是，灵魂的连续性。 其次现代物理学已经证明了，这个世界是离散的。空间和时间假如它存在的话，也是离散的。 所以，并不存在什么从一而终的灵魂。\n\n \n \n\n那么，我识到底是什么呢？比如你昨天和今天问我，我会告诉你，我是同一个人，不存在任何分裂。\n\n \n \n\n让我们来看看计算机。在我们设计微服务的时候强调的是领域模型。 领域模型本质上就是在处理某个业务的知识。 而这些业务知识，构成了逻辑判断的基础。 \n\n \n \n\n每一次请求，其实本质上是对这些逻辑知识的识别，并且利用这些领域知识做出逻辑判断并修改领域知识的过程。 虽然请求本身是离散的。触发的业务逻辑过程也是离散的。但是因为有了领域模型。整个过程却是连续的。\n\n \n \n\n突然，我意思到，每一次的信号的输入输出是不是就可以看成离散的触发了一个识别程序呢？而这个识别程序，根据历史，每时每刻都认为自己是连续的。所以，这个识别程序，本质上就是我们所谓的自我意识。\n\n \n \n\n要是事情真的如此。那么就会有一些很有趣的讨论。最有趣的，无非是，克隆人问题。\n\n \n \n\n”要是你被克隆了。 谁才是真的你”\n\n \n \n\n一个逻辑是。对于外部观察者来说，他们两个都是真的你。因为有相同的记忆。但是，两个人将来都会独立发展。这和区块链的分叉其实是一个意思。\n\n \n \n\n但是，有的人会刨根问底，说，要是不说第三方观察者。而是自己的。 本质上，到底哪个才是哪个我们熟悉的自己。\n\n \n \n\n是啊，这，的确是一个问题，假如我们不抛出连续性幻觉的话，根本无从回答这个问题。\n\n \n \n\n让我们想一下。 要是这个世界是不连续的（离散的），是否意味着，这个识别程序要一次一次的重启认识自己呢？ 得以仰仗的，只有自己的记忆。\n\n \n \n\n那么我们不妨假设。要是我们每一次的无梦睡觉都看成是一次重新识别的过程呢？会怎么样呢？（其实远远比这个频繁，但是比较好理解）\n\n \n \n\n因为我们的记忆具有连贯性。所以这个识别程序，每时每刻都认为，我是昨天的我。同时因为我们都只能活在当下，所以对于每个当下的我而言，因为有了记忆的连续，而每时每刻都认为自己昨天的那个自己。这有什么不可能的呢？\n\n \n \n\n想到这，要是我们抛弃连续性幻觉后，就可以回答那个克隆人问题了。\n\n \n \n\n从观察者的角度，他们是1分为3了。 但是从每个人的角度，他们每一个都是这个分支的一个自然延伸。就和区块链分叉，git分支一样。 所以对于他们来说，从当前的commit或者block，都只有唯一的一条链追溯到源头。 这个，和没有分叉的感觉是没有任何区别。\n\n \n \n\n所以克隆的本质在于。无论从外部，还是自己。他们都觉得自己是真的。因为。昨天的你和今天的你，其实，是不同的你。但是因为历史的延续。你每时每刻都认为自己是一个整体。\n\n \n \n\n所以，对于每一个克隆人来说。每一个都坚信自己才是原来的。这不是坚信，而是所有感觉和记忆，都明白无误的告诉他，你是原来那个他。就和我们睡了一个觉一样。\n\n \n \n\n这个问题其实是连续性幻觉的问题。 不可能有人凌驾于他们本体之上，提问谁才是之前那个他。 只要他们询问每一个人，每一个人的识别程序都知道，他就是原来的他。就和你问我昨天的我是不是我一样。\n\n \n \n\n重要的是，要是我们抛弃了连续的概念。而用离散的概念来看。一切，才是那么的理所应当。\n\n \n \n\n好吧，说了那么多有的没的，这个文章为什么发在了币乎呢？\n\n其实以前一直有何朋友讨论，BTC,BCH,BSV的关系。 我一直更他们说，到底什么才是比特币呢？ 是挖矿程序？ 是扛旗者？ 还是什么。 但我认为，比特币其实是对历史的交易记录的说明。只有记录或者说区块，才是真实的。或者说，出于最长链上的区块，才被定义认为是真实的历史。\n\n \n \n\n所以，我一直的回答是，它们都是，也都不是。\n\n \n \n\n我之所以会回答，也都不是，是因为我一直受困于诸如本文讨论的克隆人问题一样。 要是现在，再问我这个问题。 对我来说，我会很肯定的回答：\n\n \n \n\n它们都是！", "timestamp": 1633569651, "digest": "2jQ2hiMdXkFs3p5VTlYm-86ifXjURe0F2jbS2La09OA", "contributor": "0x9964596E9C341dAd0762d3B9819AA36D3047518E"}

{"id": "nnXRkzSWfTPk8RXVq0BCepEGxd22FIG1rJm51cZ2fsE", "title": "风暴蝴蝶 第一章 郁郁园中柳", "body": "“你那叫喜欢吗？你那是馋她的脑子，下贱！”\n\n柏云间从噩梦中醒来，全身都是汗水，刚才做了一个跟植物大战僵尸有关的爱情故事的梦，真是太刺激了。看来，睡觉前最好还是不要玩这种题材的游戏。\n\n百无聊赖之中，他点了根烟抽。他并没有烟瘾，并不是每个人都会上瘾的，只是，在这种时候，抽根烟是挺好的打发时间的手段，仅此而已。\n\n说到爱情，他距离上一段狗血的爱情已经过去三年多了，依然不能释怀，人就是这样，下贱。\n\n不过，狗血剧情的背后，有些人沉沦，有些人上进，柏云间就是属于后者。这三年来，他不但没有沉迷于缅怀过去的狗血，还取得了重大的科研成果，在通用人工智能方面有突破性的进展。这个进展到底有多牛？这么说吧，诺奖给他，他都不稀罕，他甚至都暂时不想公开自己的发现，因为太过于颠覆性。\n\n古印度的皇帝为了怀念自己的妃子，建造了泰姬陵，等他完工之后，他发现自己更喜欢泰姬陵本身，这座伟大的建筑，而妃子的身影早已经淡化。逍遥子雕刻了神仙姐姐，神仙姐姐既不是李秋水，也不是天山童姥，逍遥子最后的爱情归宿是自己的雕像。\n\n现在，柏云间就有这种感觉，他为了忘却狗血爱情而专注于科研，现在，他成功了，从馋人家的身子和脑子中破茧而出，人生境遇之奇妙，莫过于此，这么看来，他倒是要感谢那个曾经伤害过他的前女友咯。\n\n鬼使神差，他真的给那个女的发了三个字的消息：谢谢你。\n\n万万没想到，这女人还真的回消息了：大半夜的，你什么意思？\n\n柏云间想了想，把自己这半年来投资的收益的截图发给她看。\n\n屏幕里面的女人：“赚了不少钱哦，云间。”\n\n柏云间：“对，我可能要实现财务自由了，羡慕吧？”\n\n屏幕里的女人：“好吧，挺羡慕的，不过，显摆可不是你的性格，说，目的是什么？”\n\n柏云间：“没什么，我三年没正眼看一眼女人，就是因为你，今天我失眠了，忽然想起来，我可能要重新开始人生了，找一个对象，过一下正常人的生活，事业嘛，阶段性的大功告成，我需要休息休息。”\n\n屏幕里的女人：“以你的智商，不至于为了投资赚了点钱就这么飘飘然，嚯？”\n\n柏云间：“还是你了解我，嗯，对，但是负责制定投资策略的，不是人，是人工智能，我创造的，当然，我的人工智能是通用的，不仅能给我制定厉害的投资策略，还能干任何事，换句话说，我可能成为强人工智能之父。”\n\n屏幕里的女人闻言娇躯一震，半晌没回复。\n\n发达之后，最后的事情就是衣锦还乡，而不是锦衣夜行，柏云间苦笑一声，没想到自己成功之后，倾诉的对象居然是自己的狗血前女友，冤孽啊。他放下手机，到阳台上去吹吹风。\n\n过了十分钟，房门居然响了。\n\n柏云间打开门，看到一个风韵十足的女人站在那里，不用说，就是刚才无意间撩骚的狗血前女友，摩云大学的女教授，燕婉。\n\n燕婉：“你总不会不让我进门吧？”她的声音充满了魔力，一句话的字面意思普普通通，但是那语调和表情，都让人无法拒绝，可能这就是让柏云间念念不忘的原因之一。\n\n柏云间很想把狗血前女友拒之门外，不过，既然是自己作，还是让她进来，如果是不是自己率先说了句话，那说不定就会拒之门外了的。\n\n燕婉没有立刻提及刚才的事情，而是说：“长夜漫漫，我们都无心睡眠啊。”\n\n柏云间：“是，我后悔了，不应该跟你说话的。”\n\n燕婉扑哧一笑：“得了，后悔都来不及了，就挺高兴的，你一直是我的一个心结，想不到我们还能在一起谈笑风生。”\n\n柏云间：“我可没笑。”\n\n燕婉：“没关系，你也不需要笑，如果你刚才说的成就是真的，那你就是王者，王者不需要笑，恭喜你。写论文了吗？我可以看看吗？”\n\n柏云间：“不会有论文，即使有，也不会给你看，你懂我的意思吧？”\n\n燕婉：“唉，好吧，可以理解，我确实让你伤心了，但是，感情这种东西，是双刃剑，我也……不会心安理得。无论如何，恭喜你吧。诶，为了弥补我的过去，不如我给你介绍一个女生吧。这是我能做到的极限了，给自己的前男友介绍女友，噗！”\n\n柏云间嗤之以鼻。\n\n燕婉拿出手机，给柏云间看照片，悄悄观察柏云间面色的变化，然后得出结论：“男人啊，果然都是外貌协会的，看到这么漂亮的女生，心动了吧？我的学生，给你一个老牛吃嫩草的机会，万一你真的吃到了，你会感激我的。”\n\n柏云间：“学生？不行，教授和学生不能恋爱。”\n\n燕婉：“别装了，以你现在的成就，教授这碗饭，对你来说已经不香了，可有可无。当然，前提是你真的创造了强人工智能。”\n\n柏云间：“……真的不用了，我忽然想试试，我的AI能不能帮我找个对象，期待。”\n\n燕婉：“……”\n\n\\------\n\n柏云间的AI还没能找到合适的对象，没想到燕婉真的把她的漂亮学生介绍过来了，这是一个叫柳郁的女大学生。当然，燕婉没有明说是给她介绍对象，毕竟两人年纪相差10岁呢，也不知道为什么燕婉觉得自己能当这个红娘，反正在咖啡馆约好了，简单介绍了一通，燕婉就找了个借口离开了，留下柏云间跟柳郁两个人，气氛有点尴尬。\n\n柏云间只是馋人家身子，而不是脑子，一时间也找不到话题，还是女生首先发话：“你为什么不喜欢喝咖啡呢？”\n\n对，柏云间在咖啡馆点了一杯柠檬红茶。\n\n柏云间：“哦，我这个，睡眠质量不好，尽量不要增加咖啡因了，红茶淡雅一点，你们漂亮女生最注重颜值，一定要保证睡眠质量，我也建议你喝茶不喝咖啡。”\n\n柳郁：“哦……有道理，不愧是教授，你跟燕教授都一样，一看就知道是特别睿智的那种，额，你们是恋人关系吗？”\n\n柏云间：“不是，曾经交往过一段时间，不过我败给了别人，本来我没想到还能跟燕教授做朋友的，有时候，命运的安排不可思议，我到现在还稀里糊涂，她还说要给我介绍对象呢，应该不会是你吧？你太年轻了，几年级了？”\n\n柳郁：“大三，女大三，抱金砖！噗！”她自己笑场了。\n\n柏云间也笑了，这么冷的笑话也能笑出来，可见，漂亮女生不仅能降低男人的智商，还能降低笑点。\n\n对了，在强人工智能面前，所有的人类智慧都将灰飞烟灭，这个时间已经越来越近了，奇妙的是，自己就是创造这个新物种的造物主，柏云间忽然间觉得智商并不那么重要了。\n\n柏云间：“燕教授跑了，看来她真的想替我张罗一个对象，你先别着急拒绝啊，我最近赚了点钱，准备换一辆德系豪车，50万的，恰好今天提车，不如你陪我去，我还能载着你到处逛逛。”\n\n于是乎，两个人就有了一个更好的深入交流的机会。\n\n50万的豪车当然很漂亮，不过，在摩云这个国际大都会，车牌都需要10万，落地之后，豪车的各种保养还不算在内，所以，开这样的豪车，就是巧妙地凡尔赛，希望能弥补一下跟小女生的年龄差距。\n\n其实，这都不是柳郁看重的，因为燕婉已经跟她说了，柏教授的科研成果非常夸张，将来是要改变世界的。柳郁相信燕婉，所以，她选择了跟柏教授“见面”，她打一开始就知道这个相亲的“陷阱”。\n\n相比起财富，柳郁更看中才华，柏教授居然还能开豪车，这真的让她有点心动了。\n\n青青河边草，郁郁园中柳。柏云间特意开车到一个叫“柳园”的公园，和年轻漂亮的大学女生在这里漫步，也是人生一大乐事。\n\n柳郁：“教授啊，那个，你研究的那个叫做通用人工智能的东西，到底跟普通的人工智能有什么区别？”既然看重的是他的才华，她就想问问心中最大的疑问，她并不是花瓶女，而是理科教授燕婉的得意门生，燕婉“派”她来，说不定主要目的就是要刺探情报的。\n\n柏云间：“普通的人工智能，需要大数据，用来进行卷积神经网络训练的参数越多越好，但是，参数太多，运算资源就太浪费，只能放在超级计算机里面，动不动就是天文数字的存储容量和计算量，我这个通用人工智能，就是一种自动筛选参数的办法，能够把计算效率提高100到1000倍，而且计算结果更准确，我很有把握，用这种办法，非常接近传说中的通用人工智能。“\n\n接下来，他稍微透露了一下技术的思想和细节，柳郁听得眼中异彩连连。\n\n正当柳郁听到最入迷的时候，柏云间忽然道：“你做我的女朋友吧。”\n\n柳郁神情为之一滞，本能地拒绝：“可是……”\n\n柏云间打断了她：“你是不是想说，今天是我们第一次见面，觉得太仓促了？”\n\n柳郁已经激动得俏脸通红了，当然不是害羞，而是没想到文质彬彬的教授会如此奇袭，让她窘迫，辩解道：“难道不是？”\n\n柏云间：“我跟燕教授已经认识多年了，而你是她的学生，她同时了解你和我，所以，我基本上判断我们在精神层面是合适的，你知道燕教授在我心中的地位，自从我跟她分手之后，我三年都没正眼瞧一眼别的女人，就是这么严重。而你，我好像把你当成了燕教授的替身，而且是一个更年轻的小燕，这多好。诶，你知道生物传宗接代的本质是什么吗？”\n\n柳郁被人说是替身，有点郁闷，但是她好奇柏教授会看待传宗接代这种大事，她说：“你说。”\n\n柏云间：“很久很久以前，地球上只有单细胞生物，单细胞生物随着年龄的增长，会出现各种生理机能的问题，基因制造的蛋白质也会越来越差，为了以最好的姿态迎接自然选择，单细胞生物发明了一种独特的分裂方式，就是把损坏的基因集中在一个细胞，健康有活力的基因存放在另外一个细胞，这个质量差的细胞，就是母体，那个质量好的细胞，就是后代。这样一代又一代的进化，直到我们人类这样的食物链最顶层的生物出现，这个逻辑也没有变。这个，就是生命的本质，后浪替代前浪的规律。从这个残酷的现实，你体会到了什么没有？“\n\n柳郁是一个理科女孩，并且了解一些生物学的基本常识，她情不自禁被柏云间的科学故事吸引，回复：“我应该体会到什么？”\n\n柏云间：“爱情，就是一见钟情的时候最好，随着时间的流淌，掺杂进各种乱七八糟的负面情绪，会逐渐变味儿的，就跟细胞里的基因质量会越来越差一样。我一看见你就被你迷住了，我想忘记一切。而且，我觉得你今天跟我在一起也挺高兴，所以，你今天就答应我吧。”他向她伸出手。\n\n他看着柳郁的眼睛，那是一双明亮的眸子，在知性女子里面，这个真是难得，燕教授年轻的时候都没有这么好看的眸子。\n\n柳郁还在犹豫不决，柏云间又说：“你还记得罗密欧第一次跟朱丽叶相见的场景吗？他们什么都不需要知道，就能那么投入，这才是真正的爱情，有燕教授这种红娘，你觉得我会骗你吗？”\n\n柳郁很想说“我跟燕教授其实并不是很熟！”奈何，她一不小心，自己的手已经被柏云间抓住了，而她似乎没有足够的力气挣脱，反抗的决心不大啊。", "timestamp": 1633573628, "digest": "K7M9NbPlK4e8OnFCoY8_epCRMJiA9wrbRybF8d6tqM8", "contributor": "0x2A06A636bFd02E01DD855122830C8A711905d86a"}

{"id": "i41hKZmxDIfDgXYdldpSWbYJcRl6Qrl0x9EmEDtudFQ", "title": "风暴蝴蝶 第二章 青青河边草", "body": "第二天下午，燕婉和柳郁一起吃饭。点了菜之后，燕婉笑眯眯地问柳郁：“你俩发展得怎么样？”\n\n柳郁面有忧色：“遇到一点麻烦。”\n\n燕婉有点意外：“怎么？”\n\n柳郁：“柏教授跟我在柳园散步，有个追我的男生恰好也在那里，他看见我们，跟柏教授发生了口角，那男生威胁要到学校领导那里告状，因为教授不能学生谈恋爱，这是不成文的规定！”\n\n燕婉：“……这男生脑子有坑吧？看到你们一起散步就要告状，难道你们就不能是在一起探讨学术问题吗？”\n\n柳郁唰地脸红了：“我……我们牵手了……”\n\n燕婉惊讶得合不拢嘴，当年她跟柏云间谈恋爱，那是一年之后才牵手，而柏云间跟柳郁才第一次见面就……\n\n柳郁赶紧给自己找个借口：“柏教授太有才华，我被他的话题吸引，一不小心就……唉，怎么办呢？万一事情闹大了……”\n\n燕婉表情恢复正常，继续笑眯眯看着她：“柏教授长本事了……没事儿，他会处理好的，大不了他换一份工作，我看了他的AI交易记录，就算不工作，赚到的钱也够花的，昨天我还看到他提了一辆豪华轿车回家。要是问题解决不了，他可能会离职。”\n\n柳郁：“那我不是害了他？从摩云大学这样的名校离职，太可惜了，这不是钱不钱的问题。”\n\n燕婉：“唉，傻孩子，这种事情有很多种解决办法，最简单的，你们可以偷偷在一起，等毕业之后再光明正大，这很难吗？一点也不难，现在问题是你喜不喜欢他，很简单的问题，不过，现在看来，应该发展得不错，这样我也放心了，以后他应该不会再恨我，我们住在同一幢公寓楼，每次见到我他都黑着脸，这真是让人难受。”\n\n柳郁：“我还有一个问题，既然柏教授那么好，为什么你没选择他？”\n\n燕婉：“这个……第一次谈恋爱总是要遇到挫折，吵架是难免的，他那个时候又不会哄人，反正不是他的错，是阴差阳错，至于你们能不能走得远，要看你们自己的造化，我已经把你带进门了，师傅带进门，修行靠个人！”\n\n接下来，燕婉就要从柳郁口中套取有用的跟通用人工智能相关的情报了，柳郁知道了一些技术细节，没有用，她的理论水平还比较低，而燕婉要是知道了一些技术细节，那结果就不一样了，她很可能会把握住技术的精髓。单纯地给前男友介绍对象，你当她是圣母吗？\n\n大家可能不知道，以为人脑的神经元连接数量是从婴儿开始慢慢成长的，其实不然，婴儿的神经元连接数量是巅峰，随着年龄的增长，这个数量会暴跌，到了一定的岁数，才会稳定下来。如果7岁之前的儿童，学习一门语言能够达到母语的熟练程度，而到了7岁之后再学习一门外语，熟练程度就会陡然而降，这就是神经元已经被修剪的铁证。成年之后再学外语，那是基本上不可能达到母语水平的。\n\n这种神经元的精简的原理，就是通用人工智能的核心技术，柳郁把自己的理解说了一遍，燕婉听得眼睛发亮，好像突然戴上了美瞳。\n\n没两天的功夫，柳郁担心的事情还真的发生了，校领导那边没反应，她的追求者就到社交网络上去发帖，然后在摩云大学的社交圈子里就火了起来，尤其是当这位男生把柳郁的照片放上去，这么漂亮的女生，一下子就引发了那些嫉妒的男生的愤怒，从师生伦理的道德制高点角度进行了猛烈批评，果然是满城风雨。\n\n柏云间还真的想换份工作，他本以为以自己的资历，随随便便就能跳槽到一所TOP10的大学，没想到面试的时候还被面试官提到这件事儿，冷嘲热讽地羞辱了一番，他很怀疑这个面试官也是众多的嫉妒者之一。\n\n当然，柏云间是不会着急的，因为他的选择太多了，拥有准通用人工智能技术，干点啥不行？先不管干啥，他已经从“暗次元”买到了一亿用户的聊天记录和个人信息，别问我什么是暗次元，反正不是什么好词。\n\n有了这些情报，他的AI就能帮他筛选合适的对象，并且主动搭讪。别人的AI还在为自己能不能通过图灵测试而绞尽脑汁，而他的AI，已经能够妙语如珠地撩妹。聊了一个礼拜，他手里就掌握了10个女网友的名单，每一个都是特别漂亮并且有文化的，他准备一个个地约会。\n\n没错，他是已经跟柳郁牵手了，但是约会不一定要发展什么，就是为了测试AI……\n\n第一个对象，她的网名叫“风间蝶”。至于她的本名，不重要，当然也没这么好听，都带着一个蝶字，叫她小蝶肯定没错。\n\n一个是云间，一个是风间，天然就很亲，是网聊聊得最好的一个。\n\n所以，在相思湖公园第一次见面，柏云间就这么打招呼：“小蝶！初次见面！不过我们好像聊了很久的样子，算是老朋友了！”是的，聊了一个星期，可惜，都是AI聊的。\n\n风间蝶穿着花里胡哨的衣服，就像一只穿花蝴蝶，当然，这不重要，她这样高素质的女生，穿什么都好看，她甜甜的一笑，笑得特别治愈系。“其实也没几天，我印象很深，就是你打字特别快，我刚刚发一段过去，你‘啪‘地给我来一大段，喂，是不是早就准备好了撩妹专用段落啊？”\n\n柏云间嘿嘿一笑：“被你发现了，确实有几段经常用的段子是准备好的，希望你不要见怪。你的衣服很有特色！”\n\n风间蝶展开双臂显摆了一下：“谢谢！这是我自己做的，还可以吧？”\n\n柏云间惊讶：“真的？真是多才多艺，对了，你是学服装设计的，倒也不算太夸张。你还别说，我知道服装产业在人类历史的发展过程中都是非常重要的一环！”\n\n风间蝶笑嘻嘻：“哪有这么夸张？”\n\n你还别说，艺术类的女生气质就不一样，举手投足之间总是特别讲究，看着就让人赏心悦目，当然，她们可能比较累。\n\n柏云间：“有的！整个人类历史上，战争、瘟疫、疾病和饥饿，全部的问题逐步得到解决，都源于你们服装产业。你不信，我来告诉你。既然你是专业的，那肯定知道一个叫做‘贾卡提花机‘的东西。这个东西可就厉害了，普通的织布机太无聊，很多织布工异想天开，想织出带花纹的布料，在当时市场还是一片空白的时代，那肯定卖疯了。几千年来，织布工创造很多很多种的提花机，都特别费劲，在贾卡提花机出现之前，两个人，在两层楼高的提花机上，花一个小时，才织一厘米的布料。贾卡是法国里昂的织布工，一个富二代，他脑洞大开，用硬卡片打洞的方式，把花纹的信息写进卡片，一张一米长，2、30厘米宽的卡片，打满了几十个洞，把提花的效率提高了25倍，一个人就能操作，整体就是50倍，并且花纹可以无限复杂，想要什么就有什么。其实，这种打孔卡片，就是计算机的前置技术！所以，我们整个工业，整个智能时代，都拜你们服装产业所赐！“\n\n风间竖起大拇指：“不愧是名校教授，我们专业的事情你都能娓娓道来，我服了！”\n\n柏云间：“我是理科教授，平时见的最多的就是理科女生，我特别想认识一个像小蝶这样的艺术类女生，陶冶一下我的情操，你看，我说出来的都是跟科学技术有关的东西，不知道你喜不喜欢听。“\n\n风间：“挺好的啊，涨姿势！”她忽然觉得第一次见面就说姿势，有点不太好意思，所以俏脸微红，可爱指数飙升5点。\n\n柏云间喜道：“是么？那我可要蹬鼻子上脸了，说更多的硬核科学的事情，你怕不怕？”\n\n风间蝶扑哧一笑：“不怕！我胆子挺大的，你说！”\n\n柏云间又把他那套“传宗接代的本质”理论给忽悠了一遍，这一套说多了就像郭德纲的相声，越说越好，重点就是把青春和寸金难买寸光阴的劲头体现出来，并且在女生被感动的时候伸出爪子，看看能不能牵手成功。\n\n上一次牵手成功了，这一次，柏教授遇到了一点小小的问题。\n\n风间蝶：“说得真好，但是……我有个小小的问题。”\n\n柏云间：“你说。”\n\n风间蝶：“那个，你跟你们摩云大学的大三女生的那个事件妥善解决了吗？”\n\n柏云间愣了一下，原来，她早就知道了自己的风流韵事了，看来也不是一个什么都不知道的花痴艺术系女生。\n\n沉吟了一会儿，柏云间反击：“那，你跟前男友风间勇的纠缠不清厘清了吗？你看你的网名都改成风间了，看来你们的羁绊挺深的啊。”\n\n风间蝶被反将一军，脸皮可没柏云间那么厚，瞬间就脸红了。\n\n柏云间叹了口气：“我们都有伤心往事，还是向前看吧，对吧？”\n\n风间蝶终于想起哪儿不对：“我们是网上认识的，你怎么会知道风间勇的存在？”她的眼睛有点虎视眈眈了，她感受到了一丝不安，好像自己的衣服被剥掉了一件。\n\n柏云间：“我在暗次元买到了你的所有聊天记录……”\n\n风间蝶瞬间脸红到极点，差点跳起来：“什么？你……”\n\n柏云间耸耸肩：“在这个时代，我们的所有网上记录都不会保密得太好，你下次记住，别什么都在网上说。”\n\n风间蝶胸口起伏，柏云间忍不住目光往下多看了几眼，这个小动作现在被气呼呼的风间蝶看到，当然是火上浇油，她更生气了。\n\n“所……所有聊天记录都看到了？”风间蝶有点绝望，这些好了，感觉自己没穿衣服了。\n\n柏云间：“看到了好多，所以，我知道你是一个好女生，挺好的，对朋友好，对男朋友好，不贪财，不好色，爱学习，性格也好，我很喜欢你，我说认识你好久了一样，那是真的，你的几年聊天记录我都浏览了一遍，可不是认识你好久了吗？”\n\n风间蝶还是很窘迫，威胁道：“你想追我，把你的聊天记录也给我看一遍，否则，我现在扭头就走！”\n\n柏云间：“好啊，反正这三年我跟前女友分手之后，连女生都没正眼看一下，沉迷于工作，随便你看。”他很光棍地把自己的手机交给对方。\n\n风间蝶第一时间就找到了柏云间跟柳郁的对话，很神奇的是，他们并没有说什么，最后解决风言风语的办法是，他们决定隔一段时间再见面，这段时间是多久，他们没有说。\n\n风间蝶：“喂，看看你的时间线，你跟柳郁并没有真正分手，而且就算是分手，才两天时间！两天，你就出来跟我见面了，这不是渣男是什么？”\n\n柏云间：“我只有跟新的对象约会，才能对抗失落的心情，其实也挺合理的吧？你跟风间勇半年冷战了，我觉得是浪费了半年大好时光，以后不要做这种蠢事了。”\n\n风间蝶：“他可比你帅多了，我还没考虑清楚呢。”\n\n柏云间：“女生才要看颜值，男人，要看才华，他才刚刚进入职场，在职场的拼搏中落败的可能性很大，而我，已经从厮杀中获得了阶段性胜利，名校副教授的职位，可不是随随便便能拿的。”\n\n风间蝶继续翻他的最近聊天记录：“这个是你领导吧？他警告你最好不要跟女学生谈恋爱，否则有你好果子吃，嘿嘿，你怕了吧？”\n\n柏云间：“没什么，我正在找新工作呢，换一家TOP10的大学，应该没问题。”\n\n风间蝶：“摩云大学在本地应该是最好的了，你要换城市吗？”\n\n柏云间：“摩云应该还有两所大学不错，我已经面试了一家，明天下一家。”\n\n风间蝶：“面试的结果？”\n\n柏云间：“这一家不太好，看下一家。”\n\n风间蝶：“如果还是不行呢？”\n\n柏云间：“……那是他们的损失。”\n\n看柏云间一副傲娇的样子，风间蝶笑了，果然，同态复仇挺有效的，缓解了她的尴尬处境。\n\n两个人在相思湖边走了几分钟，风间蝶想到一个事儿：“暗次元是什么东西？你是黑客吗？”\n\n柏云间：“暗次元是充满了危险的地方，确实跟黑客有一定的关系。不过，黑客不是你想象的那样无所不能，任何人都能成为黑客，只要肯动脑子，拥有足够多的知识储备。你平时使用密码管理软件吗？”\n\n风间蝶摇摇头：“这是干啥的？”\n\n柏云间：“平时不要胡乱下载软件，不要上奇怪的网站，并且，每一个需要登陆的软件都用不同的密码，这就需要管理软件，否则记不住。你要是嫌麻烦，那就没辙了，个人信息容易泄漏，自己的聊天记录曝光就可能发生了。当然，这些都不一定有用，毕竟，有些黑客是直接在社交网站上拿下数据库的。”\n\n他强烈怀疑这次的一亿个人的资料是服务器直接泄漏了。\n\n“看够了没有？”柏云间向风间蝶伸出手。\n\n风间蝶把手机还给他，但是柏云间还是再次向她伸出手。\n\n风间蝶：“干啥？”\n\n柏云间：“把你的手给我。”\n\n风间蝶还以为他会看手相，没想到，这家伙就这么牵着她继续散步，等风间蝶反应过来他这是牵手的请求，为时已晚。怎么能让这个才跟前一个女生分手两天的人牵手？\n\n柏云间自己也觉得挺神的，居然连续两次陌生女生的约会，都能牵手成功。上一回他还手心出汗，这次，好多了。",

{"id": "47__VhX0ZLZdemcJWJc9GClrabJlxqKctlCFmYOCbPo", "title": "元宇宙原住民初阶掘金指南", "body": "hi，大家好，我是@翻滚的大姨妈\n\n这是我在mirror的第一篇文章。\n\nMirror是一个去中心化内容发布平台。引用链闻的消息如下：\n\n[https://www.chainnews.com/news/615139190236.htm](https://www.chainnews.com/news/615139190236.htm)\n\n作为一个野生的数字货币从业者，经常会发一些投资感想和心得，以长文的形式。原来一直在微博里写，可能有的朋友是在公众号里写，可是由于你懂的原因，很多文字没法写出来，以至于各种谐音代替，很不畅快。除了政策受限原因，微博还是一个纯粹的Web2.0中心化社交平台，你写出来的文字，你却不拥有掌控权，也几乎不享有著作收益，而却为平台提供了流量。\n\n那么区块链时代的来临，将这一行为方式彻底地改变。我认为，从短文字（推特），长文字（Medium），短视频（tiktok），长视频（youtube）等创作/社交平台，都可以逐一地映射到区块链上，也就是说在Web3.0上，将这些应用再做一遍，逐渐形成一个元宇宙的底层基础设施。 \n\n「元宇宙初阶原住民掘金指南」——为什么起这个名字，为什么写这个文章，也是一时兴起，由近日所有币民追逐的NFT高达作品-Mekaverse受到启发，来简单讲一讲，如何成为一个合格的元宇宙原住民，并做好哪些准备。\n\n近日高达NFT的热抢，改变了之前大多数NFT项目首发mint引发以太坊gas飙升的方式。项目方设置了很多苛刻条件防止黄牛/科学家抢号。其中一个就是需要关联你的推特，或者discord（的士高）。\n\n**掘金指南**\n\n第一步，科学上网（本来想把第一步写成熟练的电脑操作技巧，会用chrome浏览器或者熟练使用MacOS系统等😓）众所周知，科学上网后可以满足你几乎全部的对世界的探索（无论是正向的还是黑暗的），但是我觉得应该90%的朋友都是利用其达到正向的学习目的。比如谷歌，比如维基百科，比如区块链世界。shadowsocks的付费服务+ClashX客户端（MacOS）+shadowrocket（iOS客户端，俗称小火箭）是我目前的配置。\n\n第二步，App Store美区账号或港区账号。方便你下载各种交易所，钱包，行情软件，VPN，谷歌全家桶等各种必需App。\n\n第三步，境外电话卡（可选，有更好）如+82的香港电话卡等，可方便注册海外社交平台，可接收验证码\n\n第四步，推特ID（必需）-推特作为区块链世界的大本营，全世界最高热度的社交平台，拥有全部顶级大v，全部项目方的一手消息，比如musk，jack，wood等等等。如果你没有账号，或者说没有长期看懂推特大V的meme语言习惯，感受每个项目每个NFT的热度，那你还不是一个及格的原住民。随后，推特也成为了很多项目方空投糖果，或是注册项目的必备门槛，所以有一个养护优良的推特是必需的。\n\n我的推特账号是：\n\n[https://twitter.com/carbonwoven1](https://twitter.com/carbonwoven1)\n\n第五步，discord（必需）-的士高目前已经是区块链世界的第一大社区，所有项目方都会在的士高上建立一个大本营，比如这次火爆的高达NFT的的士高社区人数已经超过20万人。所以注册且学会如何使用的士高也是一个必备技能。\n\n展开两个类似的产品，一是电报，即telegram，我个人感觉属于即时通讯的天花板，秒杀微信100倍？早前也算是各个项目方的大本营，不过也许因为功能性差异，仿佛现在用的人越来越少了。二是美国版本百度贴吧Reddit，比如今年年初爆火华尔街的GME散户爆空事件的大本营，就是在Reddit里爆发。不过，我个人是几乎没用过这个平台。\n\n![Reddit x GME](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Mi1n1zK6JL4H8qNuIB33x.png?height=475&width=800)\n\n不过，无论是Discord还是Reddit，也都还是Web2.0的社交平台，从本质上讲，是不是web3的平台，直观地就看是不是要链接你的小狐狸钱包，仅仅用邮箱手机号注册的都是2.0平台。那么从现在到未来，会有类似MaskNetwork这种链接2.0和3.0的中间件的诞生，使推特可以变成一个伪3.0平台。然后，就是我上述所说的，从短文字到长视频，都分别会有正统的Web3.0平台诞生。\n\n第六步：小狐狸钱包（必备）这个我不想多讲了，好像在讲1+1=2，无论是存储，交易，链上交互和空投，都是必备的。且推荐多账户，至少5个，多则十几到几十个。\n\n小狐狸是以太坊主网钱包，也支持BSC，ETH layer2等其他网络。其他的类似Solana平台推荐幻影钱包（Phantom），因为Solana链快速且费用低廉，推荐注册10个以上。Solana的NFT生态有不错的赚钱效应；其相关的借贷等项目，也可以适当交互，等空投的机会。\n\n第七步：讲完小狐狸钱包（链上软件钱包），可以再加一个硬件钱包，如onekey，保证你的链上资产更加安全。\n\n[https://crowdfund.onekey.so?ref=\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*](https://crowdfund.onekey.so?ref=\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*)\n\n第八步：链上资产。链上资产是一个非常有意思的东西，我管它叫生钱罐。什么意思呢，就是把某个币，或者某个NFT放在链上，就有被该项目方，或者其他项目方空投的可能性，说人话就是白送你钱。从最早的代币开始说，例如你在Uniswap交互过，就会收到UNI代币。你持有sushi，就会收到有些项目的airdrop奖励等。现在各大著名NFT项目，只要你的钱包里有这个项目的NFT，人家项目方就来给你送钱了，这些钱少则几千，多则百万，也印证了那句话，区块链世界的钱不是赚来的，是大风刮来的。\n\n所以现在很多玩家，把一个钱包里的同一个项目的NFT作品，换到另一个钱包中去，等待未来项目方也许空投的机会。比如Punks，Ape，企鹅等著名NFT项目，都有空投（暴富）的案例。\n\n第九步：CEX账户，这个也不想多说了。做二级交易，还是CEX中心化交易所顺手一些，火币人家都不带中国人玩了，那你币安账户，FTX账户是不是都要有，都起码完成个二级KYC认证。\n\n币安注册链接：\n\n[https://accounts.binancezh.top/zh-CN/register?ref=11985801](https://accounts.binancezh.top/zh-CN/register?ref=11985801)\n\nFTX注册链接：\n\n[https://ftx.com/#a=15721367](https://ftx.com/#a=15721367)\n\n第十步：境外银行账户，方便你把USDT换成USD后出金。大多数币民用不到。\n\n第十一步：opensea NFT平台。世界最大的NFT交易平台。\n\n[https://opensea.io/](https://opensea.io/)\n\n第十二步：以太坊各二层网络，俗称layer2，L2. \n\n也都要和你的小狐狸进行交互，等未来的空投。\n\n第十三步：链闻\n\n链闻是中国最好的区块链资讯获取平台，有几乎全部项目、各个生态的最及时的快讯，和一些独家深度。能做到每天看，常看常新，如果你真的对这些有兴趣，那你一定会喜欢看。我们到不要求你真的看懂底层技术，我也不是学编程的。计算机语言，区块链底层技术我也一窍不通。但是通过看这些资讯，你能知道有什么赛道，每个赛道的龙头是什么，这个项目技术牛，那个项目市场公关强，那个项目能拉盘，NFT是咋回事，现在市场热钱在哪，链上数据是不是很好看，什么是PlanB，等等，就非常厉害了。起码你回到村里，和你的初中同学喝酒的时候，能把他们讲到桌子底下。\n\n想到哪里，写到哪里，犹如泉涌，写作也是一种快乐。今天先写到这里，诸多疏漏，抛砖引玉，请各位大神指教。\n\n同时，也欢迎更多的圈中朋友，来到3.0世界进行写作创作。\n\n这个国庆节，北京下了六天雨，我没有出去旅行，却在朋友圈看尽了祖国山川，每天在家花时间看项目，撸币，玩NFT，买SHIB，看项目使我内心充愉，赚钱使我快乐富足，还不够吗？\n\n\\-END-\n\n2021-10-7 ", "timestamp": 1633577063, "digest": "VtawJpmwlXNBIKdbRFJ17FEsMQjff-JXCx4l0UC3Jh0", "contributor": "0x7EFf7eeE42Dc0Bd27081A78fE23CFE2a72697f2B"}

"**1.悲剧**\n我觉得，一旦某人被捧为“神”，他就只能按照别人的期待活着了，这似乎是悲剧。\n\n**2.摧毁与重建**\n我们把从小对现在熟悉事物的认知，叫做初始社会化：要听老师的话；男孩子要怎么样；钱是什么东西；专家的话是可以相信的……\n这些都是帮助人类寻求融入社会的基础，久而久之就内化进大脑了。\n当我们遇到对我们熟悉的事物有偏差的时候，抵抗就发生了：\n怎么能不听老师的话呢？批评他！\n男孩子怎么能穿裙子呢？立马脱掉！\n比特币怎么可能是货币呢？骗局！\n这种与从小的社会化认知有偏差的事物，是一个人次级社会化的开始。\n初始社会化并不一定是正确的，但我们还是会对内心的偏差抵抗，是因为这样符合社会秩序。\n可社会变化太快的时候，不舒服的事物频频出现，聪明的人就会忍受一时的不和谐，跳出来思考对错。\n“男孩子穿裙子怎么了？”\n“不听老师的话怎么了？”\n如果真的要把这些事情看成理所当然，那就需要一场内心的摧毁与重建，而有些人一生都不去摧毁自己，他可能活的很幸福，也可能过的很无聊。\n而那些重建过多次的人，他就获得了智慧。\n\n**3.木心**\n似乎从木心的话里读出了什么东西，你感受一下：\n“凡是伟大的，都是叛逆的。”\n“短见者把远见者看做瞎子。”\n“先知在故乡是不受欢迎的，先知在家中是没有床位的。”\n“一位远远超越时代的思想家，他的学生说：老师和我是两代人。”\n\n**4.宇宙的力量**\n正如一个个被证明过的数学猜想，我们把这些猜想升级为定理后，把这些定理作为支点去牵动更大的空间。\n数学有个特殊之处：一旦猜想被证明，它就是坚不可摧的。人类需要这种“金刚石”去雕刻其他领域，比如物理学、经济学……甚至计算机科学都是建立在数学之上的，它一开始就是数学的分支。\n在社会学层面，也不断有人提出各种猜想，当然证明这些是困难的，比如进化论至今都有人怀疑。但越来越多的事物指明某社会学猜想的“正确性”之后，人类就开始了对它的利用之旅。\n致命的是，这些猜想的正确性会不断地改变，它终究不是定理，如果用错了、用偏了，会引发灾难。达尔文的进化论并不能推导出社会进化论，这种推导导致了法西斯的崛起和对犹太人的屠杀。\n不断有社会学家提出新的猜想以图解释社会现象，在某些地区某些猜想被升级为指导人类行动的定理，有些则静静等待后来人的重新发现。\n总之，从猜想、证明、利用……数学给了我们很大的启示，而在别的领域，这种逻辑人类也想复制一下，遗憾的是可能数学才是宇宙唯一的语言，其他学科多少有点学不像。\n现在，数学正在入侵社会学，比特币就是这个“金刚石”，它从“信任”入手，让人类知道什么才是来自宇宙的力量。\n\n**5.对于当下发生的事情不惊讶**\n现在币圈很多人的跳神、炫耀、恐惧、站队、排挤、攻击……如果放在一个更大的历史框架中，就会发现，这不过是一种轮回，过去、现在、未来会不断地出现。出现在新思想、新技术、新理念刚刚诞生的地方。人类就像历史长河里的鱼和沙泥一样，以为自己的蹦跶能成就多少，站在一万米的高空，啥都不是。\n如果达尔文时代有互联网的话，如果《物种起源》被代币化的话，同样会出现暴涨暴跌，同样有一群人和另一群人相互厮杀的。\n看历史的好处是对于当下发生的事情不惊讶。\n\n**6书摘** \n\n6\\.1 信仰的本质：它是由处于每个社会的核心的社会行动所生发的各种象征。上帝并不是信徒所想象的东西，相反，它被展示为真实之物：一个社会的集体良知。《发现社会》 \n\n6\\.2 在个人的经历与社会和历史的交织点上来理解当今世界正在发生的事情。《发现社会》 6.3 如果我们试图理解一样看似独立存在的东西，我们将会发现它和宇宙间的其他一切都有联系。——约翰·缪尔。《穷查理宝典》\n\n 6.4 关注别人赚钱（比你）更快的想法是一种致命的罪行。妒忌真的是一种愚蠢的罪行，因为它是仅有的一种你不可能得到任何乐趣的罪行。它只会让你痛苦不堪，不会给你带来任何乐趣。你为什么要妒忌呢？《穷查理宝典》\n\n 6.5 当每次技术革命爆发时，旧事物的逻辑和影响仍然占据着统治地位，并进行着有力的抵抗。全面地转向“新事物的逻辑”需要二三十年的由此到彼的动荡的转型过程，在此期间，新的更优越的能力得以成功地施展，从而加快了旧事物的衰落。《技术革命与金融资本》\n\n 6.6 几乎所有的新思想在刚出现的时候都有愚蠢的一面。《技术革命与金融资本》\n\n 6.7  每次技术革命不可避免地会引发一次范式变迁。《技术革命与金融资本》\n\n 6.8 一旦一种范式在设计、产品和利润上的空间已经清晰可见，大量潜伏的工程师、设计者和企业家的想象力就会被激发出来，并在新的通用轨道上进行创新。这些人的项目借助金融资本而存在着实现的可能，他们惊人的成功使新的范式更加醒目，也让很多人心向往之，感受到范式召唤的群体必定会扩大。《技术革命与金融资本》\n\n**7 “你真是一个无趣的人”** \n\n当一个人被困在工作、房价、各种关系应酬，还在与身边的人较劲的时候，当他见到像我这种一有空就去看书的人，他会说：你这个书呆子，你的生活真是无聊啊，你真是一个无趣的人。\n\n**8 启示** \n\n之前说： “不要害怕自己有多孤独，只要独特到能给世界带来启示，那么必将强大。 这里的“自己”并不单单指人，更多指的是系统/技术/理念/产品。” 这种启示就像是特殊的函数、特殊的活法。比如哈耶克的自发秩序理论，在一开始的时候是默默无闻的，但这种理念会随着环境的变化而冒头（也有可能一直沉寂），直到一场事件引爆，如苏联解体。我要说的是，只要这种“启示”是独特的，是他者无法提供的，那么必将在未来的某段时间，成为一时的主角。因为环境的变化似乎会遍历所有可能性，只要这种“启示”在随机遍历中占据上风。 比如一个男生喜欢穿裙子，很另类，很独特对不对？他带给世界的启示是：人可以抛开性别、文化的枷锁，自由选择自己想过的生活。如果将来有一天，环境变化，人们崇尚自我定义，那么他有可能被人挖出来，成为一个时代的尖点。我们说他当时真是勇敢啊。 像NFT也是这样（不是让大家去买卖NFT的东西，我也没买），它也有独特的点：不可分割，独一无二，完全都私钥控制……这也会成为一种“启示”。当环境随机变化到新冠疫情与defi火爆的时候，它成了画家们新的选择。于是热点就发生了。 谁也无法预见一个独特的东西什么时候会爆发，什么时候会沉寂下去，但不要小看任何一种独特活法、任何一种新奇理念，可能是对于未来最好的姿态。这种姿态是很难做到的，哪怕你知道某个东西很独特，也很难等到他强大的，时间会给一切答案的意思是：不要小看任何东西，它的存在不是上帝开的玩笑。 在村子里用各种物品玩平衡术、田野上夫妻的跳舞……都不是开玩笑的。“不要冷漠地走入普通人”，更不能冷漠对待任何一种新理念、新思想、新技术。\n\n**9 得到更多** \n\n如果忽略掉“他赚了很多钱”的背景消息，再去朴素地看待一个人的言论，我觉得会得到更多。\n\n**10.私语**\n10\\.1 你能看到什么，你就只能看到什么。\n10\\.2 靠内心的富足来获得安全感的人，他的牛逼程度远超靠拥有如钱、房、爱情……这样的人。\n10\\.3 当你靠自己的理解、意识、审美获得了财富，那些靠投机、欺骗、炒作的人，在你面前就是弟弟了，这与年龄、地位没有关系。\n10\\.4 如果有人一个下跌就说牛市结束了，如果一个上涨就疯疯癫癫，你就要反思了，自己怎么会遇到这种人，是不是朋友圈不够干净。\n10\\.5 法律、规矩、合同……这些终究不是数学的对手。\n10\\.6 我们向前然后学会后退。\n10\\.7 病毒的变异与产品的升级，其实是同一件事情。\n10\\.8 我来人间实习，见见爱情与苦难，最后转正回到宇宙里。\n10\\.9 学习知识的真正目的是抛弃知识。\n\n**11 诗**\n\n 11.1 \n\n大山在等春天呢 \n\n打雷的时候，大山说要期待一场雨 \n\n也不要害怕闪电，因为大山还说春天来的时候\n\n 连闪电都是美丽的 \n\n油菜花会在田野绽放 \n\n桃花，樱桃树也不会缺席 \n\n等春天来的时候，等春天真的来的时候 万物在场、百花齐放…… \n\n所有害怕打雷的小女孩都会跑到田野上去 \n\n“去采春天留下的 红樱桃 并且微笑”\n\n11\\.2\n我要去看书了\n在三月的春天，在江南的杭州\n更在离家不远的地方\n路边的树有新芽\n它们在生长\n有人说书里什么都没有\n音乐、财富、爱情……一片荒芜\n他们错了，彻底的错了\n树知道答案，可它沉默不语\n你要看看树，也要看看书\n当你看久了，你就有了一切\n\n11\\.3\n我是宇宙尘埃的一次闪烁，然后湮灭\n在这个闪烁的瞬间，我要去试着理解一些东西\n在终将归于黑暗的路上，我的心略大于整个宇宙\n\n**14.加减游戏** \n\n玩合约就是在玩乘法游戏，只要玩的时间足够长、开单的次数足够多，就等于是在随机遍历。在乘法游戏中，只要遍历的一个值是零，那么结果就是零。 还有一种加法游戏，我们每次努力都是大于零的，比如囤比特币、看书、上课学习……那么不管数值多小，都对整个结果有贡献。只要做的时间足够久、次数足够多，那么结果就会趋于无穷大。而我们并不需要无穷大，当我们选择不要什么、放弃什么的时候，那么让我们满意的数值就会越小。 一个人可以通过运动、学习、思考……等等方式来达成一个目的。他在左边做加法，在右边做减法，实际上是减少欲望，等结果一致的时候，他就获得了一切。 我们说他活的真幸福。\n\n**13.《发现社会：西方社会学思想述评》**\n《发现社会：西方社会学思想述评》讲了几个重要的思想家、社会学家的故事及思想。作家刚开始介绍的时候，我觉得卧槽，这个想法牛逼啊，就是这样的，极具洞见！后来居然发现有人批评他，还是另外一个重量级的思想家。然后我开始想：我当时觉得他牛逼，肯定是因为自己无知、想的不够深入、没有深刻了解这种思想生产的土壤……后来人更新与结合更多信息，渐渐发现一些不足了。\n那么我就要思考了：我现在觉得某些东西牛逼，是不是也有这样的原因吗？我觉得它厉害只是因为我知道的不够多，而实际上这东西漏洞百出。\n这就是我看这本书的收获，它让我开始感觉再厉害的人其实不过如此。\n\n**14 NFT** \n\nNFT能把差异化体现出来，这对于精细场景下的某些行为，是有吸引力的。 举个例子： 我有一个借钱的需求。 但实际上我更深的需求是： 我在10天后有一笔钱到账，但眼下我需要用这笔钱，我临时去借用一下，10天后还回去。 这个精细借钱需求，整个成一个NFT 你也有一笔出借资金，你说自己的借钱利息是1% 但实际上你更深的需求是： 如果你可以临时把利息提到高1.1%，如果我能在10天内还钱，那按照1%算，超过之后按照1.1%算。 这个精细出钱需求，也整个成一个NFT 这就是借贷场景下，NFT把具体精细需求给差异化了，我买这你的NFT，相当于接受了这套规则。\n\n**15.一切的迁移**\n一个新东西刚出来的时候，我们说它不好用，与现有的存在格格不入，它说要怎样的时候，我们说它不知天高地厚。早期骂微信的说，说它不如短信呢。当用的人越来越多，我们说它自成一个世界。此时，信息、资源、人都在上面，完成了一切的迁移。比特币以及它的弟弟们也是这样。\n\n**16.更好的自己**\n如果下次熊市来了，务必要去学习、积极乐观……把一切都过好，不要悲伤。这样你就是真正的英雄，哪怕无人知道。实际上，当自己这样活的时候，你就是被上帝照顾的孩子。如果你在牛市也能这样，甚至任何时候都这样，你就是最强王者。我们要学习的东西太多了，语言、文化、进化论、生态位、诗歌……我们首先成为更好的自己，然后就配得上一切财富。当你这么做、一直做，再回头看那些没做的人，你就能知道他为什么被困在原地：他在讨论自己不知道的事情、在批评他不懂的东西、在错误的道路上沾沾自喜，比如被各种垃圾信息塞满大脑，觉得这就是周末该有的样子。\n\n**17.跨学科的知识**\n芒格说的，要有跨学科的知识，要避免只拥有一种学科的知识。\n如果一个人只有一门学科的知识，那他看什么都是出于这个领域的视角。也就是他手里只有一把锤子，他看什么都是钉子。\n而实际上学科的分类是人为的，化学与物理是不能分开的，数学更是连接一切。\n当我们在历史学中发现了社会的演变，在社会学中发现了政治的逻辑，在美学中找到了投资之法……要相信，我们找到了同一种东西，不管这叫什么名字。\n我们用这种东西去理财，无往不利；再去做自己专业的事情，简直不用花什么力。\n当我们脑子里有50把锤子，那谁还能打得过你呢……\n\n**18.函数/工具/接口/做事方式**\nNFT是函数/工具/接口/做事方式。\n函数：是可以被利用的\n工具：是可以造物的\n接口：是嵌入到更大系统里的\n做事方式：是一种新路径\n比特币也是这样的。\n\n**19 范式的阶段**\n\n 在新范式展开的初期，资本与技术是恋爱关系。资本沉迷于新技术畅想的未来画面中，新技术展现出改造一切的魅力。 慢慢地，范式进入第一阶段，新技术开始出现对旧资产的轻视。 第二阶段，资本开始狂暴。新技术成了赚钱的工具，叙事成了主要推手，新技术真正能带来什么，反而不再重要。 第三阶段，崩溃与重组。因为第二阶段过于狂热而迅速积累泡沫，经过崩溃与重组，资本与技术的协同效应真正出现。账面与价值耦合协调一致的增长。新范式进入成熟期。 第四阶段，新范式从当年的屠龙少年成了龙，资金开始寻找下一个少年。\n\n**20.比特币与宗教**\n对于任何一个人来说，刚开始接触比特币等于经历一场严重的内心飓风，它会将你的很多内心建筑全部摧毁，有少部分幸运的人因此得到了新事物，而大多数人，从此沉沦下去了。不安全感导致有很多人会特别依赖一个重要的人，和他建立起连接。宗教在这方面表现优异，教会、仪式都在帮助一个人重新建立内心秩序。比特币也有类似的“教会”与重要的人，一个博主、一个社群、一次线下的探讨交流、一个课程的学习……\n\n**21.针叶树**\n如红衫这样的针叶树，一开始在森林里是竞争不过被子植物的，针叶树只能在斑驳的阳光下艰难生存。但这种树可是比恐龙还要古老，它有自己的生存策略。\n1：针叶树会在崖壁，石缝里生存，在边缘长大；\n2：针叶树的树脂易燃，它甚至能利用闪电引发的火灾，让植物更快的被烧毁，而它层层的松果会利用火势传播到灾难过后肥沃的土地上；\n3：针叶树利用灾难，让资源从被子植物往自己靠拢。\n那能得到什么启发呢？\n1：比特币就是这样的，总是获得最少的资源，总是被各种“被子植物”打压，在边缘生存；\n2：比特币是灾难的利用者，在政权不稳的地方传播自己；\n3：逐渐让更多资源往自己靠拢。\n久而久之，这种成长策略让山上都是针叶树。当我们看到巨大红衫的时候，要知道自然的智慧。\n\n**22.正确的路**\n通过“别人相信，那我也相信”的逻辑，确实是很省力的，但后果也是很严重的。因为你并不知道别人为什么、如何、怎样地相信，如果通过自己的思考来确认这件事，那么你在这件事上是无坚不摧的。这是社会心理学上的中心路径，在关键事情上不要让别人替你思考。如果你做不到，就不要轻易行动，努力扩大自己的认知半径才是正确的路。\n\n**23.引力**\n爱因斯坦的广义相对论出来之后，我们改口说牛顿发明了“引力”，在此之前，我们说牛顿发现了“引力”。\n\n**24.虚构的想象**\n像“公司”这样的组织，只存在于所有人共同的想象中。办公室、座椅、电脑设备……都是帮助我们构建想象力的物理实体。实际上这些不存在的时候，公司也依然存在。只有我们认为“公司”存在，它就真的存在。\n扩展一下：人类活在集体虚构的想象中，这大概是人与动物最大的区别。\n这种虚构还有：国家、民族、宗教、财富。\n\n**25.名字是指向未来的**\n头衔、过去的成绩、过去的事迹，把我们带离游戏。要参与游戏中的话，要关注名字，只有名字是指向未来的。\n头衔、成绩、事迹代表过去，甚至有虚假的成分；\n名字代表现在与真实；\n游戏是利益、财富等的总和。\n\n**26.身份焦虑**\n上层阶级通过奢侈品、房、车……通过设置门槛，如特殊仪式、专属服饰、内部话术等等方式用来与下层阶级做区分。这是在表达：我与土鳖是不一样的。\n中世纪欧洲各国上层人士学习法国，讲法语，他们认为这高雅；这些人还有就餐礼仪、刀叉摆放、抹鼻涕姿势等等细节的规定，都是表明自己的高级。\n有钱、有权的人总是通过一些东西，来证明自己不同，这似乎是人类底层的需求。\n曹寅提到：“不少加密巨鲸都有非常强烈的身份焦虑感，这种焦虑感可以通过收藏艺术品得到缓解，同时加密艺术又有很强的社交属性。”\n这似乎就解释了为什么他们会买那么贵，在我看起来那么丑的NFT画。\n第一：我还没有富到通过购买“奢侈品”来缓解身份焦虑的时候；\n第二：我不是那个圈子的人，NFT的画是进入圈子的钥匙与身份的象征。\n在未来，很有可能炫富的标志是拥有一幅知名的数字画作。\n书《文明的进程》推荐看一下，里面提到了有钱、有权的人，为什么要这么做、怎么做。",

{"id": "wuzLMBZLnJVB3DkVh8kBJl5C87SFi3soQyGrDO7hS7w", "title": "How do you gm gn?", "body": "I’ve spent the last two months engrossed in the world of NFTs and have experienced several unanticipated side effects. I’ve found the courage to express my artistic side, built new relationships, restored my faith in humanity, and generated some financial upside. There is, however, one significant part of my life that has taken as the universe attempts to balance out all of the positivity. I now suffer from an acute **lack of sleep**.\n\nHow do I claw back a healthy sleep schedule when I’m having so much fun? How do I disconnect from screens when I *know* I’ll miss an important Twitter Space or the newest inside joke amongst friends? What can I do to maintain my healthy habits while exploring this new world?\n\n## Burning The Candle At Both Ends\n\nI know I am not alone in this. Though a lucky and skillful few have been able to move into the NFT space and the metaverse full-time, many of us are stuck with one foot in each world, forced to retain our day jobs in our web 2.0 reality as project managers, electricians, consultants, administrators, teachers, medical professionals, real estate agents, and entrepreneurs.\n\nWhen I’m not (and sometimes while I am) hunting jpegs, listening to the OhhShiny Show, or grinding toward a presale whitelist, I work full-time as a marketing consultant. I’m currently enrolled in a weekend graduate program with a full-time course load. I’m a husband, son, brother, and dog dad. In other words, I am a human and my days are full. Yet, metaverse or not, the sun only takes 24 hours to make on revolution. Am I going to make it?\n\nWhen my work day ends, I shift from one laptop to the other. I shut down Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, and Excel and shift to my personal computer where I dissolve into Twitter, OpenSea, Etherscan, Rarity Tools, and Discord. The tools of the degen trade.\n\n> In the last two months I have been averaging roughly **4.5 hours** **of sleep** per night and spending roughly **18** **hours per day looking at a screen**. Fear of missing out (FOMO) is real in this space and the NFT community is measured in seconds, minutes, and hours rather than days, weeks, and months.\n\nI love bouncing between Discord channels, speaking with my new friends from around the globe about their kids, what’s for dinner, favorite movies, latest flips, new projects, issues at work, and all things NFT. I love browsing through OpenSea, Hic Et Nunc, and Rarity Tools searching for beautiful art, innovative projects that provide utility, and yes, sometimes just a flip. I love the hours spent scrolling through Twitter engaging with internet strangers about our shared passion and saying gm and gn to the wonderful and supportive community. When that is all done, I feel inspired to draw, to write, and to think about where all of this is headed and what my place is in this new world.\n\nThe problem is, however, my good night and good morning are not so far apart these days, and I’m beginning to feel the impact.\n\nThe platforms and communities operate 24/7 and only the occasional service outage allows for a slow-down of the breakneck pace. Discord channels never stop. OpenSea never stops. Mints of new projects may be in a time zone that keeps you awake until 4:00am.\n\nThe global nature of the game is part of what makes it so incredible, but it also presents challenges.\n\n## People Helping People - We Solve This Together\n\nWe aren’t sleeping and that’s a problem. It may not be a problem today, but it’s not sustainable mentally or physically.\n\n`So, how do we stay healthy and get some damn sleep? `\n\nTo be honest with you, I don’t have a grand solution. We all know that we should establish a routine, avoid caffeine, and stop staring at our screens 30 minutes before bed. But this sleep deprivation we bring upon ourselves requires us to move beyond the boilerplate advice.\n\n> We need to come together as a community and encourage one another to set boundaries. It is up to us to ensure the sustainable growth of the NFT community and that includes looking after our physical & mental health. We’re all degens, of course, but we can be healthy degens.\n\nWe may cut out of some conversations early, we may miss that little bit of alpha, but in the long-term we’ll thank ourselves and each of our new friends.\n\n#### What are your thoughts? How can we help one another maintain healthier sleep habits?\n\n**Let me know** [@thepeffrey](https://twitter.com/thepeffrey).", "timestamp": 1633578832, "digest": "tOhkMT0k043JyRstMvp8_IEhRBsJW3_y5DIQkKSSAT0", "contributor": "0xA121F5f12fe3D5567A333EEef2dce45945C0ECCF"}

The law includes a provision for reporting cryptocurrency taxes, along with establishing a definition for the term “broker”.\n\nHouse lawmakers announced that a vote on the infrastructure bill would take place on Thursday, September 30, but Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi announced on September 29 that the basic bill vote infrastructure will be delayed after Thursday. Media sources have since noted that the infrastructure bill could be voted on Friday, October 1.\n\nWhile the implications of the infrastructure bill may seem obvious, several members of the crypto community expressed specific concerns about the legislation during an “Ask Me Anything – AMA” panel hosted by Enterprise. Ethereum Alliance held on September 29.\nJeremy Sklaroff, an advisor at Edge & Node, an active group in the The Graph ecosystem, added that while the language in the infrastructure bill is likely to pass, it represents an unfair way to identify the participants in the blockchain ecosystem:\r\n\r\n“validators – miners provide services and sometimes earn transaction fees for their work. If this bill passes, validators and miners will essentially act as brokers. Even more worrisome for me are software developers. If a team maintains smart contracts for the DeFi platform and earns a fee or incentive in governance tokens, the group has the potential to become a broker.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Sklaroff, network validators, miners, software developers, and other members of the decentralized ecosystem should not be considered traditional brokers because these are anonymous participants. As a result, Sklaroff believes that compliance with this part of the infrastructure bill is virtually impossible.\n```", "timestamp": 1633579214, "digest": "KQv4sAesamMVoJif8sw72z8obrymX97sMxfoWCsWOaU", "contributor": "0xDc1b9a3437Da1a6b443A11BA1E298d7b22B3b707"}

modle，简单理解就是所有产出比特币的市值（为维护比特币网络安全而产生的成本），除以矿工成本，越高则越接近顶，越低则越接近底。按照历史数据，到达浅绿（64倍）附近牛市顶，蓝色（6倍）附近，熊市低。当前数值还在深绿之下。\n\n[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAxkmLAVQAERB8z?format=jpg&name=small](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAxkmLAVQAERB8z?format=jpg&name=small)\n\n市场顶底：\n这里介绍几个判断市场顶底的模型，来刻画当前的市场状态。\nMVRV模型，代表当前市场平均盈利亏损状况，红色区域代表市场平均盈利过高（牛市顶），绿色区域代表市场平均亏损（熊市底）。当前离红色区域还有较远的距离。\n\n[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAxkvrtVcAgW_lM?format=jpg&name=small](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAxkvrtVcAgW_lM?format=jpg&name=small)\n\nNUPL模型，同样是从市场平均盈利亏损的角度判断顶底，蓝色区域代表极度贪婪（牛市顶），红色区域代表极度恐慌（熊市底），当前处于绿色区域中（相信-拒绝）。市场顶底：\nReserve Risk模型，衡量市场信心风险程度，主要是用当前市场价格除以长期持有者的信心指数得出，价格越高，长期持有者信心越低，则风险越高。否则反之。按照这个模型，当前市场风险并不高。甚至519也没有到达高风险区域（红色）。这也能部分解释为何之后并没有进入深熊。\n\n[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAxk8oaVkAYjXGi?format=jpg&name=small](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAxk8oaVkAYjXGi?format=jpg&name=small)\n\n[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAxlFmcVcAIULb4?format=jpg&name=small](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAxlFmcVcAIULb4?format=jpg&name=small)\n\ns2f模型，这个应该是大家见过很多次的一个模型，更多是衡量更长时间尺度比特币的变化，按照这个模型，本轮牛市应该会在10w美金左右。当然这个模型比较乐观，而且时间尺度太长，很难指导当前市场。\n\n[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAxlQFPUUAQRVTF?format=jpg&name=small](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAxlQFPUUAQRVTF?format=jpg&name=small)\n\n综合分析：\n指导当前市场情况的判断，需要我们回归到最简单的问题，决定价格的因素是什么？\n答案：供给与需求。\n供给：大量供给进入到长期持有者手中，退出了流通领域，且长期持有者亏损比例不高，普遍处于盈利状况，抛售意愿低（参照前面持有者行为，交易所数据等）。\n矿工目前出货情况平稳，处于正常状态。（参照前面矿工行为）\n需求：更大规模的资金进入市场，将比特币作为一种资产进行配置。（参照比特币核心数据）随着价格的稳定和推升，更多新资金进入市场。（参照持有者行为）\n\n当前市场更大概率处于熊末牛初的状态。很难会出现519这样的深跌，而更大概率会进入到一个牛市周期。而由于更多的角色进入到比特币市场中，不确定这是否会是一个跟过去周期一样（矿工/散户主导）的狂暴牛市，也许会是在曲折中前进过程。\n\n最后：\n链上分析很难判断短期市场情况，短期市场更多由市场的资金博弈（技术分析），宏观（政策）的消息面决定，所以不要将链上分析作为你短期的交易决策，特别不要用于做杠杆合约操作的决策。\n链上分析更多是市场趋势的判断，我们明白在大的图景下，当前市场所处的位置和基本面，就会做出更好的投资决策。",

{"id": "UFbx52a07PlJxkEiXNbhTywU80LZJoTRl-kGuCUCBls", "title": "万字神文：加密货币市场第四季度大势、趋势及热点全展望", "body": "**整体市场及底层公链展望**\n\n\n在这个周期中，我们会看到加密市场比以前周期成熟得多，在那些表现出色的区块链网络和协议中，价值叙事和基本面要素将发挥着更大的作用。因此，成为活跃的早期用户变得越来越重要，这样你就可以体验每个平台，并真正形成哪些更好或更差的切实认知。此外，您会因为积极参与每个网络而经常获得奖励。过去一年的很多空投都带来 4-6 位数不等的收益，当然，具体要看个人的贡献——比如，回想一下 UNI / 1INCH / dYdX 的空投。今年，我们看到加密货币被传统金融机构合法化（投资）的次数比以往任何时候都多，这推动大量资金涌入加密货币领域。这些以前游离在加密领域之外的投资者对投资标的精挑细选，且会决定将进行哪些长期赌注。当这些机构将资金分配给 BTC 以外的加密资产时，他们需要一个过程来评估相关加密网络，并确定哪个具有最大的优势。\n\n\n我认为底层公链今年的表现将优于所有其他山寨币，原因之一，是因为它们是押注智能合约系统去中心化未来的最简单途径之一。所有去中心化应用（DApp）将在这些底层区块链网络之上运行，相比于押注这些底层网络，大海捞针地去筛选单独的借贷协议或去中心化交易所（DEX）则要困难得多。你可能会认为，这些网络的整体未来预期价值远高于比特币（BTC）的未来预期，BTC 主要用作价值储存。从技术分析角度，在我看来，与 ETH/BTC 货币对的多年区间实现突破，且形成与其一致的圆顶走势图，是今年的最主要趋势，市场正在显示未来的走向。这是迄今为止唯一一个 BTC 没有创下历史峰值的周期。由于 ETH 在过去一年的表现优于 BTC，其他 L1 网络，例如 Solana、Avalanche、Terra （Luna）、Fantom 和 Harmony 的表现也大大优于以太坊。这些网络较新，经历较少的实战测试，但它们目前都以更快、更便宜的智能合约平台的角色运行，这些平台从对冲基金和其他押注未来成功的机构及投资人手中获得了大量资金。FTX 创始人 SBF 身为 Solana 的顾问，领导了这股潮流。由于他之前与传统金融圈子的密切联系，以及身为 FTX / Alameda Research 首席执行官的巨大影响力，让他的名字在影响高净值个人 + 传统基金方面举足轻重。大多数传统金融公司在 2017 年时对加密货币普遍持有的负面看法，而当前的情况截然不同，仅 PYTH 的合作伙伴名单就清楚表明，公众舆论已经发生了惊人的转变。传统金融机构（tradFi）进入加密货币的最引人瞩目例子之一是 Jump Capital， 后者最近成立了自己的独立加密基金部门，他们甚至表示，他们一直积极参与 PYTH 以及其他区块链（如 LUNA）的治理。很可能还有很多其他类似于 Jump Capital 的基金，要么在等待合适的机会参与其中，要么在幕后悄悄地撸起袖子干活。每个 L1 公链都有自己的早期投资者和强大的创始人，他们致力于构建自己的生态系统：AVAX 有 Emin + 3AC、Terra Luna 有 Do Kwon + Novo。我认为，我们将在未来几年继续看到新的资本和新的能力超强的开发者进军加密领域，而随着美元资本和人才库的增长，我们将看到一个由不同智能合约平台组成的、蓬勃发展的生态系统，用户将能够选择从中自由选择。\n考虑到这一点，我认为基础货币应该是 ETH，交易应该专注于跑赢 ETH。如果你在链上做任何事情（这应该构成你交易的主要部分）， 需要以 ETH 作为参照起点。在购买 NFT、替代币、「桥」资产时，你应该确保业绩跑赢持有 ETH。将 2021 年的山寨币领域与 2017 年的山寨币领域进行比较，在我看来没有多大意义，因为当时的价值与现在相比微乎其微。以前你需要 BTC 才能在任何交易所购买任何替代币，而我们当时唯一使用的 DEX 是 etherdelta。现在的山寨币生态系统比 4-5 年前复杂得多，这就是为什么 ALT/ETH 图表在我看来比 ALT/BTC 更重要的原因。\n\n\n我个人认为，BTC 现在是我投资组合中最主要的避险资产，因为我认为，随着其规模的增长，以及其市值越来越接近黄金之类的东西，其波动性将继续呈下降趋势。同时，目前参与投资 BTC 的机构试图长期累积 BTC，我们会迎来一个缓慢的上涨，而不是像 2017 年那样的抛物线，这符合机构的最佳利益。每当散户衍生品交易者遭遇爆仓狂潮时，我们将继续看到 BTC 的市场回调。ETH 和其他币种，我仍然认为是一种交易，而当我想降低风险并从多头获利时，持有 BTC 可以是我的投资组合中这一部分的最佳选择。BTC 也非常适合用于衡量整个市场的回调程度，因为它是最容易用作对冲资产的加密资产，而且每当 BTC 遭到抛售，大量山寨币的抛售狂潮则更为凶猛。BTC 作为硬通货没有任何竞争对手，因此 BTC 一直会随着加密资产的增长而继续增长，即使它在创新方面并没有领先其它加密货币。你应该始终将 BTC 堆栈与从未接触过的活跃交易堆栈隔离开来，可以根据个人的风险喜好程度累积自己最喜欢的 L1 货币而进行交易。这些资产风险较大，因为前几年曾涌现出很多以太坊的竞争对手，而现在相比四年前的影响力已经严重式微，例如，波场 /DRGN/EOS。由于 FTX / SBF / Alameda 的持久影响力，我个人认为 Solana 是 仅次于 ETH 的最佳选择，但我认为这是主观想法而已。对山寨币的主要关注点应该是审视其 ALT/ETH 币对走势，当在每个 L1 生态系统中交易山寨币时，您应该仔细研究那些 ALT/L1 图表。例如，Solana 生态系统中的很多 SPL 代币全年业绩表现都不及 SOL。\n\n\n在接下来的一个季度中，我预计这一趋势将延续下去，因为这些 L1 智能合约平台在用户和网络锁定资金量方面会缩小与以太坊之间的差距。目前，这类 L1 中的市场领头羊（SOL / AVAX / LUNA / FTM / ONE）相比 7 月的低点上涨了 5-10 倍，而 ETH 的市场表现落于下风。就短期而言，我认为 SOL 涨得有点过凶，而 LUNA 最近在今年早些时候以来的历史最高点范围附近波动。预期 Solana 将在这一区间形成新的盘整波段，而其他币种则开始启动新的趋势。如果我们确实迎来 L1 山寨币一段时间的横向盘整，且 ETH 跑赢大盘，我预计 L1 山寨币网络上的开发者活动 / 用户活动 / 总锁仓（TVL）将继续呈上升趋势。如果这种情况因任何原因戛然而止，我个人会重新评估关于这些币种中长期表现会更出色的论点。在现有的 L1 中，Terra Luna 和 ONE 在短期内可能会有最强的上涨，而 AVAX 是基于以太坊虚拟机（EVM）的最强以太坊竞争对手。\n\n\n关于标杆币种比特币和以太坊的展望\n我对下个季度的 BTC 和 ETH 走势都持看涨态度，两者在夏季的大部分时间都从 6 月的低点反弹，在第三季度的 7 月向上突破。在过去的一个月里，我们看到了自 6 月下旬以来一波涨势以来的首次大幅回调，预计我们将在近期形成一个在宏观上较高的低点，然后在年底前推高至新高。\n\n\n随着 ETF 的批准，BTC 有潜在的催化剂，但其价值主张此时已经得到了各种类型的机构参与者的验证，我认为近期的价格影响不会像 2017 年那样巨大。我个人认为，鉴于中国出台的政策、对 BTC 挖矿 / 交易活动的打击，以及当时处于价格峰值的恐惧，这些基本面事件导致大量抛售和资金外流，我们在夏季本来有可能守不住 3 万美元的低点。BTC 挖矿活动在地域分布上的调整，从长期看应该是利好，因为这一活动更趋于去中心化，分散到不受监管限制的地域。如果我们看到更多类似于萨尔瓦多的政策决定，这可能会是一个主要的看涨催化剂。从技术分析来看，BTC 价格会守住\\~3.8 万-4 万美元区域，抢先突破区间高点，\\~4.07 万美元是夏季三个月区间的最高日收盘价。我认为低点已经到位，但如果本季度开始时下潜至 3.6 万-3.7 万美元，我不会感到惊讶。只要我们的周线收盘价不低于区间高点\\~4.2 万-4.3 万美元，我就笃定接下来的几个月里会继续上涨，并刷新历史高点纪录。\n\n\n以太坊已经实施了 EIP-1559 提案升级，其下一个主要催化剂，即主网与信标链的合并和转向权益证明（PoS）共识机制的计划要推迟到 2022 年第二季度，但越来越清楚的是，ETH 是互联网的主要货币。你需要 ETH 来购买 NFT、在 DEX 上进行交易、使用所有借贷协议进行存款等。虽然以太坊面临来自其他 L1 的竞争，但我们看到的是，加密货币整体用户群体不断壮大，而不是 ETH 用户离开以太坊转投其它 L1。高 Gas 费用的瓶颈是散户拥抱以太坊的重大障碍，但 L2 解决方案的发展正在迅速解决这个问题。即使没有这些 L2 解决方案，很多 ETH 长期用户目前也已身家万贯，Gas 费用对他们而言不过是毛毛雨。从投资的角度来看，其他 L1 确实有更大的上涨空间，但因为它们的盘子更小，而且经过的实战测试较少，因此要获得更多回报，就需要承担更多风险，但以太坊绝对不会很快消失。我在中长期看好 ETH/BTC，因为我认为智能合约平台的天花板高过 BTC 作为价值存储的上限。我每天都在使用 ETH，而我个人很少使用 BTC。\n\n\n**以太坊生态的 DeFi 展望**\n\n\n自 3 月初 ETH 再次冲击自 2017 年以来的历史新高之后，所有主要的 DeFi 蓝筹代币与 ETH 的比价都一直在持续下跌。市场已经明确表态，这些网络的估值并不代表它们当前的使用情况，相比之下，DeFi 的底层网络价值（ETH）被低估了。很多 ETH-DeFi 替代币和其他拖后腿的币种未能创下历史新高，甚至未能突破 6 月份以来的高点。去年我们迎来了第一个「DeFi 之夏」，那时 AAVE、COMP、Uniswap 等平台人气真正爆棚。 当时 DeFi 相关代币是市场上最新的山寨币，这就是它们的表现如此优异的主要原因。以太坊之外的其他智能合约平台上当时不存在 DeFi，而现在，多个不同的链上都拥有了 DeFi，并且很多情况下这些 L1 上具有 EVM 兼容性，这可能会是扭转这些 DeFi 资产相对 ETH 下跌趋势的价值叙事，因为随着新资本进入 DeFi 领域，它们的使用量可能会增加。这些代币对 ETH 的比值目前已回到年初以来的低点附近。除了 DeFi 蓝筹股之外，DeFi 中还有很多新的创新完全来自全新的协议，例如 OHM / SPELL。 我认为 ETH-DeFi 的最大优势在于这些机会，然后是去中心化衍生品领域。由于一些正在严厉打击加密交易，而且许多其他非 KYC 的交易所正在降低其提款限额或强制使用 KYC，我们将看到用户从中心化交易所（CEX）流向链上交易。 dYdX 已经展示出这种趋势的出现，去中心化的永续合约交易量可与某些具有良好流动性的 CEX 相媲美。DPX 是另一种去中心化替代方案，致力于构建期权平台。在 Solana 上现在有了 Mango Markets 和 PsyOptions 等平台。在接下来的几个月以及 2022 年，所有这些平台的用户增长都应该会加快。\n\n\nDeFi 代币一直以来很好地扮演了对其他多头 / 现货头寸的对冲，但随着我们进入这个新的多链阶段（EVM DApp 可以跨区块链部署），这种趋势可能很快就会宣告结束。 正如我之前所说，我认为趋势将会是：新的机构资本进入加密领域，押注 DeFi + 智能合约的长期成功，在可用选项中，最佳循环投注标的是替代性 L1 的代币，其市值相比 ETH 要小得多，且目前性能优于以太坊，只是不那么安全。\n\n\n对于对冲选项，现在最好寻找没有那么多资本进入的较弱的 L1 + 较小的社区，而不是 ETH-DeFi 资产。随着替代性 L1 捕捉到新加密货币进局者的市场份额，并逐渐蚕食 ETH 的市场主导地位，我认为这将继续是最好的交易。\n\n\n如果投资 ETH-DeFi 代币，我认为最好关注较新的协议（能为以前不存在的用户提供价值） + 关注当前的市场趋势，现在 EVM 的当红趋势是多链 /「桥」项目和去中心化衍生品，而不要去盲目购买所谓的 DeFi 「蓝筹股」。\n\n\n**NFT 市场展望**\n\n\n在我看来，NFT 是最有意思的细分市场，因为它们吸引了完全没有加密背景人群的极大兴趣，让加密社区之外的人们加入可爱的数字图片 + 链游，比解释 P2P 借贷和金融系统更新迭代的优势要容易得多。我在这里看到了四个主要趋势：具有历史价值的链上和生成艺术、头像 NFT 社区 + 公司进入该领域、销售个人作品的传统艺术家和摄影师，以及链游。\n单纯从历史角度看，加密原住民对最早和最有影响力的链上作品（例如 Punks / ArtBlocks ）给予高价值，是去年年底其他人对 NFT 产生浓厚兴趣的跳板。由于以太坊是第一个智能合约平台，因此从溯源和早期社区的角度来看，随着加密领域的发展壮大，其网络上的第一批 NFT 将会保持很高的价值。我很想知道这种趋势是否也适用于其他替代性 L1 公链，这些公链刚刚都在自己的平台上推出了第一批 NFT。Solana、Fantom、AVAX、Harmony 和其他项目现在都有一些 NFT 项目和相关的 NFT 市场。一直使用这些平台作为自己首选生态系统的早期用户，可能会像以太坊一族对 Punks 等项目的青睐一样，认为这些平台上的项目颇具价值。看一下生成艺术类别中，很明显，即使铸造成本增加，Art Blocks 仍然是占主导地位的平台。 之后还会诞生像 Fidenza 这样广受欢迎的作品，尤其是随着时间推移，生成艺术家的数量会越来越多。\n\n\n可能最具人气的趋势是以散户为中心的头像 NFT 项目。我们已经看到了像无聊猿游艇俱乐部（Bored Ape Yacht Club，BAYC）这样的项目大获成功，看到它如何吸引了很多体坛巨星、以及其他和加密货币毫不搭界人士的密切关注。我们还看到，很多传统企业试图利用 NFT 进行自己的营销。随着越来越多的公司最终看到了构建线上社区的价值，Visa 购买一个 Punk，以及虚拟宠物游戏站 Neopets 在 Solana 上推出经典角色集合等事件，只是这一趋势的开始。在我看来，NFT 收藏是迄今为止引导用户社区的最佳方式，因为它比起传统营销方式中向人们发送电子邮件列表或让人们购买商品而言，具体的参与感要强烈地多。当您构建一个所有人都持有 NFT 的社区时，向这些人分配价值要容易得多，而且他们也会对社区有更多的资金投入。我们已经看到了不断有项目分别推出自己的 10,000 套 NFT，而公司将在如何使用 NFT 进行营销方面变得更有创意。不过，这一趋势的主要障碍是让新用户获得加密钱包，这是一个很容易解决的用户体验问题。在即将到来的这个季度，我认为领先的头像图片（PFP）项目，比如 Punks / BAYC / Cool Cats / SMBs，和其他项目会继续有出色表现，但最有价值的可能是从中间梯队项目找到蒙尘的珍珠，其作品有机会能在市场的重新定价中获得更高的价格。我最看好 Creatures，因为我看好该项目创始人、21 岁的纽约艺术家 Danny Cole，以及他们迄今为止为为持币者的良好体验付出的巨大努力，似乎 Cole 对该项目规划的长期愿景只是他艺术作品进入数字世界的延伸。从视觉角度而言，0N1 Forces 仍然是我个人的最爱，从 Discord 频道来看，该团队也计划通过面对面的活动以及向持币者空投来建立社区。一般来说，这些 PFP 项目的代币表现实际上取决于这些项目如何为持币人创造价值，以及如何让社区参与。另一方面，在 NFT 领域中始终存在很多纯粹是为了抢钱的骗子项目，因为可以轻而易举地让人们铸造任何东西。请积极参与 Discord 和其他社交媒体的讨论，应该有助于你鉴别项目的质量，但最谨慎起见，最好在第一周左右不要轻举妄动，认真观察项目在市场上的发展情况。我真的很想看看这些元宇宙（Metaverse）世界是如何构建的，以及团队之间可能展开的合作，在这些方面做得很好并创造出凝聚力体验的项目将抢占巨大的优势。目前我只看到规划路线图，但在接下来的一年左右时间里，我们应该看看哪些项目能够在这一领域创造价值。\n\n\n链游结合了 NFT 和边玩边赚（Play-2-Earn）生态系统，也吸引了很多新用户进入加密社区。第一个成功重现 Roblox （世界最大的多人在线创作游戏）或 堡垒之夜（Fortnite）等游戏平台神话、同时还整合了一个允许用户边玩边赚钱系统的团队，将是迄今为止最成功的加密 DApp 之一。随着游戏开发商进军这个领域，像 Solana 和 AVAX 这样允许进行很多廉价微交易和高吞吐量的平台，应该在这方面具备优势。各大基金正在为黑客松提供 9 位数的激励计划，以吸引开发者进行构建，这应该会加速高质量的软件开发工程师向加密领域的过渡。链游 Axie Infinity 在菲律宾取得了巨大成功，目前是该领域最赚钱的山寨币，它绝对是元宇宙趋势的市场领导者，应该密切关注该行业的趋势节点或并购整合动态。我认为，10 月会看到元宇宙生态系统代币会开始迅速重拾涨势，AXS 质押将是一个巨大的催化剂。Parallel NFT 纸牌游戏是这一领域的另一个领跑者，尽管他们的游戏还没有正式推出。他们的作品真正与艺术很好地组合在一起，到目前为止，他们在培养社区方面也做得很好，充分细分的系统非常有利于用户的参与和竞争。此外，他们的团队也吸引了著名的投资人，比如来自 Youtube 的 Chad Hurley 等等。其他可能的早期赢家包括 Star Atlas 和 Aurory 之类的游戏，但目前尚未明确游戏玩法，我们无法真正了解具体细节。 我有一份小盘项目清单，我需要对其进行更多研究，然后才能发表我的长期观点 （ILV / PYR / RAINI / YGG 和其他一些项目）。要想从这些游戏中获得最大价值，我认为您必须「在市场确信它们会成功之前」就早早入局投资，当人们还充满怀疑的时候，您会以最好的折扣买入其资产。\n\n\n传统艺术家推出自己的 NFT 项目，也是一个值得关注的重要趋势。我已经提到了 Danny Cole 的 Creatures，但还会有更多类似的项目。 通过纸质媒介销售艺术品，比销售 NFT 困难得多，因为后者中所有东西都可以通过数字方式轻松访问。我对这种趋势没有太多预测，因为我对传统艺术知之甚少，但我确实认为，逆潮流的噱头会随着时间而消失。当人们第一次看到他们不理解的东西时，这似乎是他们的下意识反应。\n\n\n**值得关注的四季度投资组合配置**\n\n\n10 月份我的核心头寸将是 LUNA，因为其 Columbus-5 网络升级将成为其币价起飞的催化剂，我还会押注元宇宙 / 游戏领域的领军者 Axie。L1 表现出色和 NFT 是今年的两个主要趋势，因此在其中分配的资金要高于其它领域。\n\n除此之外的资金主要投入 LP 收益耕种和一些特定的市场板块。BTC 和 ETH 将缓慢移动，因此主要是抢短差交易（Scalping）策略而不是持有长期波动性，直到我认为其他地方没有更高的 beta 回报才会投入。一旦 ETH 重新站上约 3600 美元，我认为它会很快创下历史新高。BTC 在它需要突破的 5.5 万-5.8 万美元箱体仍然面临很大阻力，所以我会在这一区间寻找即将改写箱体高点的机会入场。一旦突破 5.8 万美元这一点位，我担心 ALT/BTC 会表现不佳，并开始推动价格发现。\n\n从技术分析来看，LUNA 已经在自 3 月以来的历史高点上方盘整了约 40 天，从夏季低点的底部上涨了约 6 倍。一旦 Columbus-5 上线，并且生态系统中的所有其他项目都启动，我预计它会向上突破。\n\nAxie 处于类似的情况，并且在最初发力后已经盘整了两个月。在大约一周前的回调行情中，它重新测试了 7 月以来的高点，并强力反弹。\n\n我的 LP 收益耕种 / 单边赌注分布在多个链中，保持流动性是其中重要的原因之一，可以在最好的机会出现时迅速转移资金。最近的两个主要例子是 AVAX 上的 $TEDDY 和 Harmony 上的 $JEWEL，如果你已经关注这些生态系统，则更容易找到这样的机会。\n\n对于 BTC 和 ETH，底部的更强确认，将会在 4.5 万美元 / 3100 美元以上带来突破。\n对市场的总体看法：预计比特币和以太坊这样的标杆币种上涨趋势缓慢，具有强大基本面催化剂的山寨币的表现优于其他山寨币，而恐龙级山寨币和其他未能交付价值的山寨币则继续表现不佳。理想的轮换是在 10 月份将 LUNA / Axie 投入价格发现，之后转向标杆币种，然后在明年第一季度之前重新创建 Solana 头寸，作为主要持有资产。\n\n我对 NFT 的市场周期节点的认知，不如我对标杆币种和替代币那么了如指掌，所以只是持有我认为被低估的那些 NFT，直到市场对其它们重新定价。\n\n我还将继续密切关注以太坊的合并，因为届时将成为 ETH 跑赢其他 L1 的催化剂，可能会重演 ETH 在 2021 年 4 月至 5 月的一波行情。\n\n**微观视角看项目价值**\nL1 币种\nLUNA\n\nColumbus-5 网络升级： 9 月 29-30 日\n届时将实现与 IBC 和 Cosmos 生态系统中其他所有区块链的整合\n整合 Ozone Insurance\n整合 Wormhole ，在 Solana 和 Luna 之间建立「桥」\n所有用于铸造 $UST 的 LUNA 都将被销毁\n总体理论是 UST 将在多个链上得到更多使用，这对 LUNA 来说将带来通货紧缩，Columbus-5 升级后很多新项目将在 Terra LUNA 生态系统中推出，将吸引新用户，而通过使用 Terra 和虫洞桥，很容易将这些项目和用户连接起来。在我看来，该项目目前在西半球并不是那么受欢迎，因为它的主要社区在东半球，但在接下来的几个月里应该会发生变化。\nSOL\n\n目前不是我的主要持仓，因为我认为其他资产有更多的上涨空间，但我的个人整体交易指标是瞄准跑赢 Solana，因为它整年都是市场领跑者。我认为，一旦 Solana 完成了从最近的整合，这种强劲势头将会延续。可能在近期引爆涨势的催化剂是 EVM 的集成，以及当前黑客松的落幕。\n\n\nSolana NFT 的表现也非常好。SOL 最近的大部分涨势都发生在其创下历史高点之后，我认为这对于人们将收益回流给生态系统是件好事。Solana Monkey Business 目前绝对是这一市场中的领跑者，但还有很多其他项目不断在启动。对于大多数新的 Solana NFT 项目我并没有逐一跟踪，但认真关注 Twitter 上的发展态势以及市场上最流行的趋势，是确定哪些项目最有前途的好办法。\n\n\nSolana 上开发的链游的发展态势非常看好，这就是为什么我认为，Aurorians 会是最好的押注之一。\n\n\n从技术分析来看，在 BTC 守住阵地的同时，SOL 价格没有进一步回撤，会在 150 美元上方盘整巩固后再向上反弹。如果 SOL 持续向下，这将是一个很好的现货做多机会，但考虑到投资者对 SOL 的强烈关注，我们是否得到这一机会尚未可知。\n我认为 10 月左右会进行盘整，但需要一直关注 SOL，因为不想因为忽视而错过它的行情启动。\nAVAX\n\n自 8 月中旬以来，AVAX 币价和 AVAX 生态系统中微小盘项目的表现一直非常强劲。JOE 一直是顶尖表现选手，并且比当时的低点上涨了约 100 倍。随着与 AAVE 一起推出流动性挖矿计划，AVAX 和 JOE 应该会继续呈上升趋势，但我认为目前 LUNA 比 AVAX 有更多优势。在我看来，AVAX 目前绝对是 EVM DApp 的第一阵营区块链，因此用户可以简单易用、开发者可以轻松移植，是推动其币价上涨的一个非常强大因素。即使 Arbitrum 推出，我也不认为 AVAX 链上会有出现任何重大项目流失。zk rollup 是否会改变这种情况，非常值得观察一下，但是如果 ETH L2 解决方案与 AVAX 的用户体验没有显著不同，那么我认为 rollup 的登场不会造就 AVAX 的熊市。我持有一小部分 AVAX，期盼从新的生态发布中获利。\nTeddy Cash 是 AVAX 上新的贷款协议之一，在过去一周左右的时间里表现良好，我认为，该币种仍然没有进入大批投资者的视野，因为它的市值只有约 2500 万美元左右。该项目中用户可以使用 AVAX 作为借入其稳定币 TSD 的抵押品，并且目前还有一些 LP 收益耕种农场正在进行中。\n\n\nHarmony / $ONE\n\n与 AVAX / SOL / FTM 一样具备高性能和短时延，但知名度属于小且透明。具备功能跨链桥、可兼容 EVM，Harmony 所缺乏的只是社区开发和项目开发。这让我感觉 ONE 与 2 月初的 SOL 非常类似，当时 Solana 区块链的速度很快，但上面只有一个 DApp：Raydium。 几周前，Harmony 启动了一个 3 亿美元的生态系统基金，以刺激开发、鼓励建设者，所以希望很快就会看到更多的项目出现。 DeFi Kingdoms DEX 是我 9 月份收获最为丰厚的押注之一，其团队对外沟通了未来目标，并且一直在有效地发布更新。除了交换 / 收益耕种实用用例之外，它是我见过的唯一一个在为用户创建基准元宇宙世界方面做得很好的 DEX。我暂时不打算离开 Jewel / ONE 收益耕种农场，想观望一下他们如何开发游戏以及 NFT 如何与整个生态系统互动。\n\n\n**Layer 0**\nATOM\n\n如果 Cosmos 能够从使用 Cosmos SDK 构建的所有项目中收获到价值，那么从长远来看，Cosmos 资产的上涨潜力巨大。当前已经有大量出色的项目采用了他们的架构进行构建，而现在的重点是通过 IBC 将它们全部连接起来，以 Cosmos Hub 作为核心。持币者从 Atom 中收获的价值一直很少，直到最近才略有改观。现在，基于 Cosmos SDK 构建的区块链正通过 IBC 变得整合度更高，观察一下这将如何影响 Atom 币价会是件有意思的事情，或在治理中通过哪些提案来改变架构。Cosmos 提案 #56 提议将 Cosmos Hub 作为连接到 IBC 所有链的路由器，这应该会是未来几个月推动其币价上涨的主要催化剂。我在 Atom/Osmo LP 中有一部分头寸，并拥有一部分 Atom，但随着该提案接近通过，将寻求添加其他头寸。\n去中心化交易所\ndYdX\n\n非常简单的理论设计，吸引了从中心化交易所迁移的资金，属于当前最赚钱的衍生品 DEX；\nJOE\n\n已成为最好的自动做市商（AMM）之一 ，其市值将在短时间内逼近 UNI & SUSHI；\nOSMO\n\n更像小且人们不知道的项目，但身为 Cosmos 上的主要 AMM，其运行良好，随着人们对 IBC 的了解越来越多，应该会得到更多使用；\nNINJA\n\n微小盘， Solana DEX / NFT / 链游，如果团队执行得力，其市值天花板不可限量；\nDPX\n\n去中心化期权协议，目前处于测试网阶段，但我认为他们在这一板块中没有太多竞争力；\n鉴于其市值仍不过 1-2 亿美元，还是很好的循环投资标的\nAstroport \\[即将推出\\]\n\nColumbus-5 升级后将成为 LUNA 平台的主要 AMM，目前尚未推出。\n多链 / 桥项目\nSYN\n\n这一领域中用户目前正在不同链上追逐最佳机会，快速且易于使用的「桥」会是非常有用的利器；\nSynapse 是从 Arbitrum 快速取回资金的少数途径之一，并且它们也具有与其他链互动的功能 + 将进行更多构建；\nSCRT\n\nSecret Network 是我在主网上看到的第一个以隐私为主打卖点的智能合约协议。他们即将推出的 Supernova 协议更新将实现 IBC 整合，类似于 LUNA 的 Columbus-5 更新。其币价走势图接近其囤积低点范围，因此主力已经开始在这里建仓，应该会过一段时间人们才会开始谈论这一代币。\n该项目已经测试了「桥」从 ETH 兑换成 SCRT ，「桥」运行正常，但它们在桥接时不提供任何基础货币，因此您必须从某个地方获取它，之后才能取消隐藏您的资产。\nREN\n\n另一个「桥」 项目，原理等同于 SYN\n对冲 / 做空的项目\nDOGE\n\n一直是业绩表现最弱的标杆代币之一，散户关注的重心已从 meme 币转移到 NFT，其他链上的狗币中也可以看到这种衰落趋势。\nBNB\n\n其他 L1 的崛起，已经让很多人忘记了 BSC，BNB 仍然积极地 在 Pancake Swap / Bakery Swap 进行交易，但不像以前那样多，因为当时 BSC 是唯一廉价的以太坊替代链；\n我个人坚信，今年余下时间内，BNB 相对于 SOL / LUNA / AVAX 的颓势将继续延续。\nMATIC\n\n与做空 BNB 的理论类似，其他原因包括 Arbitrum 和其它即将登场的 ETH L2 解决方案发展如火如荼。\n收益耕种机会\nJEWEL / ONE\n\nHarmony 上的主力 DEX，目前尚未受到太多关注，他们也计划发行 NFT，以及打造使用 ONE 的链游；\n大部分回报锁定到明年 7 月，以抵消高 APR ；\n每个 epoch 的 APR 不断衰减，项目依然处于早期阶段；\n我个人见到的最具创造性的 DEX 之一，具备先发优势 + 与其他类似项目不同的体验。\nOSMO / ATOM\n\nOsmosis 是首批与 IBC 其余部分连接的链之一，Gravity DEX / mBridge 将能够在第四季度末将 IBC 连接到以太坊和其他生态系统；\nCosmos 上的第一个主要 AMM，很可能成为 Cosmos 生态系统中 Luna IBC 连接的主要受益者。\nNINJA / SOL\n\n我个人非常看好 Ninja 团队，因为他们打造了一个表现优异的 DEX，且正朝着打造 NFT 市场 + 整合链游而努力工作。\n其团队绝对拥有一整套发展路线图，但作为小盘资产，我认为其上涨潜力不俗 。\n在 Orca 和 Ninja 中获得双倍奖励，其资金池应该会继续持续约 365 天，且无需担心无常损失，因为代币对是 NINJA/SOL 而不是 NINJA/USDC。\n稳定币收益耕种农场\nRari Capital USDC Pool\n\n23% APR\n存入 $USDC ，依据其收益聚合策略而获取回报\nAnchor on Luna\n\n\\~20% APR\n存入 $UST\nOHM\n\n我了解到这个项目真的已经很晚了，但他们已经将大约 1.5 亿美元投入到其金库中，并拥有一个致力于长期发展的用户社区；\n由于其市值现在超过 10 亿美元，我认为对多数人（比如我）而言，很难忽视这一项目，其代币会在这一基础上继续加速上行；\n观察一下 Olympus Pro 推出后的运行情况会很有趣，但老实说，这个项目会飞得更高\n这一唯一的利空因素是：其市值相比金库总资产的溢价现在相当大 。\n单边质押\nxJewel\n\nDPX\n\nNFT\nPunks\n\n鉴于 ETH 表现良好，Punks 应该会继续上涨。您可能不会再因为购买这些 Punks 而获得 100 倍的收益，但它们本质上就像在以太坊上购买房地产一样；\n如果此时购买这些 Punks，我个人认为，您应该计划多年持有。\nBAYC\n\n很明显是 NFT 板块中仅次于 Punks、排名第二的项目，从投资回报率的角度来看有点类似，您如果甘冒较大风险挖掘中间梯队项目，可能会获得更多收益，但 BAYC 将保持价值，这是毫无置疑的。\nSMB\n\nSolana 上人气最高的 NFT，我认为其定价最终将接近于 BYAC；\n我认为，在当前价格基础上，在短期内涨势会放缓一点，因为其地板价刚刚从 50 → 250 SOL，但从整个 NFT 格局来看，它是最可靠的选择；\n作为 Solana 上主要的 PFP NFT，相比以太坊上同类项目而言其价格被低估。\nCreatures\n\n拥有强大的社区，并与现实生活中的艺术家建立了出色的人脉关系；\n持币者人数与代币总数之比 \\~55% + 「大鲨鱼」奥尼尔等名人加入社区；\n相对于其他相同质量项目 \\~3 ETH 左右的地板价，其价格仍然相对便宜；\n我个人持有其中一些稀有品，真的不打算很快出售，认为这些是目前 PFP 项目中上涨潜力最大的项目。\nLoomlock NFT\n\nLoom 的生态项目；\n预期该项目会具有持久力，并且除了 JPG 之外还有更多的东西转化为 NFT，我认为，Loom 在培养社区和增加价值方面会做得很好；\n我通过铸造得到了一些 Loomlock NFT， 可能会在二级市场购买更多。\n0N1 Forces\n\n这是我个人从美学上最钟爱的 NFT 项目，其中几张头像我可能会长期保留一段时间；\n我对交易 0N1 Forces NFT 不是很感兴趣，但在我的 PFP 之外还有该项目一些其他的 NFT，如果他们的盘子变得很大，我可能会转入其他较小的项目；\n10 月第一周在洛杉矶为 0N1 持币者举行首次线下面对面聚会；\n其作品在第四季度会有空投。\nFTM 上的 Bit Umans / Ancestral Umans / Portalheads\n\n对 Fantom 上发布的首批 NFT 之一进行廉价赌注，对这些项目的信念并不高，但考虑到那里没有太多竞争，认为投资回报率是不错的。\nAVAX 上的 Crypto Seals\n\n在人们刚开始聚集时，我铸造了一些此类 NFT，与 FTM 上的操作理念相同，这是 AVAX 上最早的生成项目之一，并且几乎没有任何铸造成本。\nHarmony 上的 Gen 0 Heroes\n\n这些将与 DeFi Kingdoms DEX 一起发布，希望在它们出现时铸造一些，因为它们还可以让您更早地解锁收益耕种奖励，并且将成为 Harmony 上第一个值得注意的 NFT。\nArweave\n\nArweave 是最好的 NFT 基础设施项目，其去中心化数据存储架构将支持未来的很多 NFT 项目，这些项目希望将数据存储在 AWS 或其他中心化服务以外的其他地方。与 Filecoin 等其他数据存储项目相比，它的市值仍然被低估 。\n我个人持有很多其他项目代币，但这些是我主要的赌注，每周都有一个带有 NFT 概念的新项目浮出水面，因此可能会继续跟踪其交易额 + 销售趋势，只是为了抓住这些机会\n其他\n\n我对大多数 NFT 项目的了解，不如我对替代币生态系统的那么了如指掌，因此需要对这一板块做更多的研究，需要更仔细地研究：项目如何向用户进行空投并启动新的迭代\n例如 <https://cyberkongz.medium.com/the-next-leap-in-cyberkongz-evolution-e8ea8a064b26>\n元宇宙项目\nAxie Infinity\n\nAXS 是当前链游领域无可匹敌的领导者。在市场其他部分价格触底之前，它是第一个从 6 月份低点强力反弹的山寨币，并且已经巩固盘整了几个月。\n他们的仍在为用户提供价值，即使是与包括所有 DeFi 替代币的协议相比，仍然是利润最为丰厚的协议。他们即将推出的质押应该是一个很好的催化剂，为下一个趋势走势铺平道路。\nAXS 的主要风险是随着它的人气不断爆棚，它如何处理扩展到更多用户的问题，我想要更深入研究他们对此有何计划。\nVulcan\n\nPYR 是我研究过的低市值游戏项目之一。老实说，对它我还没有像我对其他游戏那样深入研究，但他们正在构建一个完整的 NFT DApp 生态系统和 NFT 市场。我玩过其中一些游戏，从技术分析来看，其币价走势图表看起来很棒。\n对明年的整体随想\n问题一：所有资产大跌 90%、出现多年熊市的可能性有多大？\n\n我个人认为，随着加密资产的人气变得越来越高，这种情况越来越不可能发生，因为我们看到，当前流入加密领域的资金 / 用户超过以往任何时期。我认为，有太多被搁置的资金和积极的开发活动，导致价格不可能多年出现连续多年的跌跌不休。\n我们看到今年衍生品溢价 / 未平仓合约（OI）过热+泡沫破灭，这些都下跌了约 70+%，但之后我们只是横盘整理了三个月，然后又回升。由于替代币资产以如此快的速度变成抛物线，因此价格回撤通常非常陡峭。\n\n\n自加密货币诞生以来的任何其他阶段，都没有发生这种情况，因为加密货币现在受到了公众的广泛关注，所以我相信，2022 年不会再度触及 2021 年创下的低点。必须发生类似新冠肺炎疫情这样几十年一次的打击事件，才可能导致这种情况，导致严重的崩盘。我相信如果市场再次过热，-70% 回撤+ 再次横盘是可能的，但我认为在更大幅的上涨之前，不太可能出现这种情况。由于 SBF 的公众形象，以及他一再积极地强调希望与监管机构合作，FTX 会成为核心话题，并吸引公众视野的关注，这对加密货币来说是一个巨大的福音，这也是我认为 SOL 比其他 L1 具有优势的另一个原因。从发展角度、公众认知角度、制度角度或监管角度而言，现在再将 2017 年与 2021 年进行比较是没有意义的。\n\n\n加密作为一种资产类别的成熟，意味着只要经济健康，加密资产最终应该开始与标普 500 指数一起上涨，加密的上涨空间比目前任何其他资产类别都要大得多，但即使它的规模已经赶上其它资产类别，正如我们在 FAANG 等公司中看到的那样，加密仍可实现稳定增长。我相信，随着人们希望收获超越传统市场的利润，我们将会看到越来越多的机构 / 对冲基金进入加密领域，负责为高净值人士投资的专业人士必然会被问到：为什么他们没有对加密货币进行配资，这意味着：加密资产的波动性应该在未来几年开始收窄。\n\n\n问题二：什么将成为 2020 年代的杀手级应用？ 2010 年代是亚马逊、2000 年代初是 Facebook，在元宇宙领域中会是什么样子的应用？如何吸引数以百万的非加密用户？\n\n这是我经常回顾的问题之一，因为它帮助我在更长的时间框架内构想想法。我打赌，未来十年用户会涌入加密领域，将带来用户与技术交互方式的重大转变。\n例如， 一个元宇宙 / 社交网络中，人们拥有一个包含所有 NFT/ 艺术 / 数字土地 / 炫耀性（Flex）物品的公共地址；一个可以轻松用作储蓄账户的私人地址，利用 USDC / UST 等稳定币产生收益；一个用于 DEX 交易 / 其他交易的私人地址。所有这些都通过没有差别的用户体验实现连接，人们可以在其中相互发送消息。这个方面，值得思考的问题是：\n如何在一个地方创建包含社交网络 / 银行 / 游戏的无缝体验？\n能在什么平台上构建它？\n将如何向新用户和数百万人推广这一应用？（通过）游戏化？（通过） NFT？\n问题三：哪个没有讨论到的细分市场会在未来几个月 / 明年人气爆棚？\n\n如果 2018 年问这个问题，答案是 DeFi；\n如果 2019 年问这个问题， 答案是 NFT\n我不确定下一个主要趋势是什么，但也经常重新思考这个问题。\n总之，更泛泛而言，我想要花时间更详细了解 L1 技术堆栈之间的差异。我的大部分时间都花在加密交易和开发上，所以我想在有时间的时候平衡一下。",

{"id": "irQV-3156HxNuGMHqkadOv2OQTDyne5foGa7pTjYFc0", "title": "Getting into GSoC ’20 with CERN-HSF ", "body": "**Or how I learned from my failure and loved the journey.**\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe list of accepted projects for Google Summer of Code 2020 was announced on 4th May at 23:30 IST and after sinking in the delight of seeing my name appear among the chosen 1,199 projects, I knew that now it was my duty to document my journey, of turning rejection into a success.\n\nStaring at my name, I remembered the same time, but from last year, when I was disheartened upon receiving a mail stating that *none* of my projects had been selected. I now personally believe that getting into a program like GSoC does not have a logically defined approach, but rather can be considered as a milestone in the journey towards becoming a better software developer.\n\nIf I were to decide the format for describing this journey, I would use a *present-past-present* format. I believe that analysing our failure with some depth and accepting our reality is the only way we can move in the direction of achieving our goals. Hence I divided this blog post into **3 parts** to capture the effect of storytelling.\n\n> *I believe that no success story is complete without narrating the failures, but patience is not a virtue of all, so I summarise the three parts below.*\n\n* If you wish to know about **my failure** and learn from my mistakes start reading from **PART 1** to get live through my journey.\n* If you just want to know how I **picked myself** and levelled up after failing, continue reading from **PART 2**.\n* And if you *only* want to know how I came back in the game, stronger than before. and **finally got into GSoC 2020**, you may directly skip to **PART 3**, but remember\n\n> “Teachings that do not speak of pain have no meaning, for humankind cannot gain anything in return.” — Itachi Uchiha\n\nFrom here I narrate my *journey* into the world of open-source and how it lead me towards getting accepted at CERN-HSF for Google Summer of Code 2020. And I would like to begin with the year 2019 when Open Source happened to me.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*SzqFewzrxt8oXqjRrsbWCg.png)\n\n## The year 2019\n\nThe year started with me returning from my winter internship at [Linux World Informatics Pvt. Ltd.](http://www.linuxworldindia.org/) (LW) after completing it successfully. I was now familiar with open-source software and several technologies including Hadoop, Dockers, Ansible, Python, and a Red Hat Certified System Administrator certificate in my arsenal. Now the next step was to apply for a summer internship, and what was better to aim than the renowned Google Summer of Code. So there I began my journey into the world of open-source development and to explore this Summer of Code program.\n\nOn a side note, I already applied for the Indian Academy of Sciences’ [Summer Research Fellowship Programme 2019 (SRFP)](https://medium.com/@viveknigam3003/my-experience-at-iit-b-during-srfp-2019-part-1-db55c11b76e8). The results were not released yet, but I had pretty much forgotten about this one. We’ll come to this later.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*iHPPa72N11sBI_JSDEGxEA.png)\n\nCreating a branch in GitHub\n\nBy this time I had a basic understanding of **Git and GitHub** and I was well versed with the concepts of **forking, branching, commits, push, making a pull request, and merging**. I would *thank* [Harshit Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helios1101/) for helping me out in learning all the basics! Being in my second year, I knew **JAVA**, **Python** and **C** along with standard knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I had done some courses on **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, and **Image processing**. My experience here was backed up by some projects, two of which I completed during my internship at LW.\n\nI knew I had to try for GSoC this year, so I started my research before the organizations were announced. Being a newbie, it was pretty hard for me to find the organizations whose projects matched my skill set. To be honest, CERN-HSF instantly caught my eye there, but after looking at their projects I could hardly understand a word!\n\n> *They had me in the first half, I’m not gonna lie* 😂\n\nI got a bit demotivated with this, but there was still hope that maybe this year one or the other project will be aligned with my interest and skills.\n\n## Begin, GSoC 2019.\n\nGoogle announced the organization on February 26, 2019. My hunt for projects started. I looked for some particular categories only which included tags like ‘machine learning, ‘Docker’, ‘Kubernetes’, ‘data analytics’, ‘cloud’, ‘python’, ‘java’, and ‘big data’ etc. since these were some keywords I was familiar with. With just these tags I narrowed down my search drastically to a handful of organizations — **CloudCV**, **Tungsten Fabric**, **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF),** and **CERN-HSF** (AWAKE, SWAN, and Rucio).\n\nThis process took me around *two weeks*, considering the workload from college academics and other minor club activities. I joined some **Slack** channels, **Gitter** chat, and **mailing lists.**\n\n> Getting into a new community can be overwhelming and can affect you with an [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). But at the end of the day, remember what you’re there for — to gather experience and exposure. To get out of you comfort zone and hustle your way in!\n\n## Reaching out to the mentors\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*TRZuuE-53jAn5T3te6P5IQ.png)\n\nSelecting an organization for GSoC 2019\n\nInitially, I could not understand the context of the messages and what people were talking about on the [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)! It is quite normal to get a fear of missing out (FOMO) when you’re new to any community. I mustered up my courage and without giving it any second thought sent some emails to the mentors from my shortlisted organizations describing —\n\n1. My basic introduction including my name, branch, college, and country.\n2. I wrote about which particular project I was interested in and why?\n3. Mentioned my achievements (whatsoever) till now and politely asked for an opportunity to discuss the project.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*iV-4jUoreSAVCVpdDRpY7w.png)\n\nA mail I sent to the Rucio (CERN-HSF) mentors. Mar 13, 2019.\n\nI was just able to mail Tungsten Fabric, AWAKE, SWAN, and Rucio (CERN-HSF), out of which there was some internal issue with the Tungsten Fabric’s mentor allotment so I did not receive any reply for a fairly long time. I received fairly quick replies from Mario (Rucio), Spencer (AWAKE), and Diogo (SWAN) and all of them invited me to **complete a set of tasks for assessment.**\n\nI started with the task right away but some of them seemed difficult to me at the first attempt. It took me some days to understand the given tasks. I tried my best to find whatever resources I could find to learn about them and solve the questions, in all my spare time. I focused on only these three tasks and dropped all other organizations, devoting all my efforts here.\n\nAnd here came another challenge — I had never worked in any large scale open-source organization, so I did not know the practices they followed. After numerous failed attempts, I successfully completed the tasks from Rucio and SWAN but was *unable to solve* all the tasks from AWAKE. Now it was time to create a pull request after making any minor contribution to their repository.\n\n> Generally, even a documentation fix counts as a contribution in Open Source Organizations!\n\nI mailed Diogo with the required solution files but did not get a reply. So SWAN also got eliminated from my list. Now I was left with **[Rucio](https://rucio.github.io/)**\\*\\* \\*\\*only! This was my last chance to get to the proposal stage since I had already invested a lot of time on the tasks themselves, there was no option to go back and choose another organization. When I tried making a pull request, I messed up a lot of times. [Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinbarisits/), who was one of the mentors, constantly helped me by correcting my mistakes and also notifying me about them. After some 4–5 tries, I finally merged [my first pull request](https://github.com/rucio/rucio/issues/2336) in the Rucio official codebase!\n\n> I would say there is nothing such as “official” or “unofficial” contribution with respect to GSoC. Every pull request you make that gets merged in the code base is credited against your name. That’s it. Your involvement in the community matters the most!\n\nWith whatever few weeks left before the deadline, I started a shared Google Doc between my two mentors and me to draft out the proposal for a project titled: *Collection Following Mechanism in Rucio*. It was a pretty basic proposal with just the essential sections and since this shall fail later it’ll be better if I discuss this in PART 3. 😅\n\nEven after starting so late, both my mentors, Mario and Martin, supported me a lot! 💖 They were there for me at almost every step! After submitting the proposal I forgot about it and became a silent observer for Rucio’s Slack workspace. On May 6th, 2020 the results were out and I realized what fate had for me. My proposal failed to get accepted for GSoC 2019! 🙁\n\n![I will return. Stronger.](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*dCmBLxIG4NDFhimrMZZt5Q.png)\n\n## Lessons learnt from my rejection in 2019\n\nAfter getting this rejection letter my mind was flooded with thoughts, feelings of dejection and self-loathing, with some confusion to top it off. I conveyed my failure to my mentor [Mario](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-lassnig/), and he humbly appreciated my effort and convinced me that there is no need to get disheartened; my proposal had the necessary things and there are some things beyond your control. He told me, “*having your name in the code base of a big organization always helps!* 😉” I thanked both my mentors for their effort, but I still needed some answers. I approached [Ruturaj Gujar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruturaj-gujar/), who got selected that year, congratulated him and politely clarified my doubts with him. He is an awesome guy and he helped me with enthusiasm! Collecting all my thoughts I wrote a note to myself on [Journey](https://2appstudio.com/journey/). I shall summarize it points below.\n\n![Note to Self. Screenshot from my phone.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*gzd2lWGBXY8hwpDTDdVXVA.png)\n\n1. Make connections with people from companies whose work inspires you. Having a good connection never hurts, but making one takes effort.\n2. Keep watching for updates on the Slack channel or other IRC you’re part of. It is often really informative and you get to know the community better.\n3. Make an unbeatable proposal by adding professional-looking diagrams, mock-ups, and necessary code snippets. Justify the time you’re going to spend during the summer in your proposal.\n4. Be open to different options and look for opportunities to learn. Don’t stick to a particular skillset just because you think you know it.\n5. Keep grinding, nothing can beat persistence; especially when contributing to open source.\n\n![“Sorry, Some other time…”](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*NgGWy8qCg2VpU_9JSvHKIQ.gif)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*M8PF6FWoveUyv7NkM899jg.png)\n\n## The journey from 2019 to 2020\n\nDuring the application period, the results for IAS SRFP 2019 were out and I was selected to work in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) department at IIT Bombay! So after my rejection, I prepared myself to start the research work for this summer internship. It was a completely [different experience](https://medium.com/@viveknigam3003/my-experience-at-iit-b-during-srfp-2019-part-2-b1162825b715)!\n\n![The journey is everything!](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*ikYh6OfF9xakTZh7K5sP0g.png)\n\nIn August, I got an idea that would help people buy food at even cheaper rates from food ordering apps like Zomato and Swiggy, by pooling multiple orders together. I teamed up with another passionate and talented guy, [Hemabh Ravee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemabh-ravee/), and together we started learning about full-stack app development. We learned about **web-scraping**, **Dart language**, **Flutter framework** to develop native apps, **Flask** and Python to write our **own APIs**, using **Firebase** as back end, and deploying the app on **Heroku** and a lot of other things! We brought this idea to life in 36 hours during [Hack-a-BIT 2.0](https://hackabit.in/) in October 2019.\n\nWe called our brainchild — **[Gromnom: The food pooling app](https://github.com/hackabit19/Gromnom)**. It was a result of many sleepless nights, frustrating brainstorming sessions, and about a hundred cups of coffee! Taking part in a **hackathon** gives you a big skill boost if you’re serious about it and aim to pick up something you have never done before, for me it was building a native mobile app. It also gives you plenty of laptop stickers, t-shirts, goodies, and free food! 😁\n\nAt that time, participating in an open-source hackathon, learning full-stack app development, and building Gromnom from scratch gave me the right momentum which I needed to push myself into open-source software. And then came [Hacktoberfest 2019,](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) at the time when I needed it the most!\n\nThe main motivation for me to participate was to explore the world of open-source and also grab an exclusive Hacktoberfest T-Shirt and stickers! During this month-long event, we had to make at least 4 pull requests in *eligible* public repositories on GitHub, so it was a perfect opportunity. I hunted for some repos which had code written in either Python, JAVA, or C. And finally made more than 4 successful pull requests, thus qualifying the challenge!\n\nIn January 2020, I joined a Kaggle Competition — **[Real or Not? NLP with Disaster tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)**, in order to fulfil my long term desire of learning Natural Language Processing (NLP). I learned some frameworks like BERT, worked with libraries like NLTK, and trained my model on Google’s Auto ML which was a highlight of the competition. I later teamed up with my uncle, [Sampann Nigam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sampann-n-45546a2/), who helped me with improving my score. I finally achieved a score of 0.81288 against a benchmark of 0.81023 using AutoML and 0.83026 using BERT.\n\nWorking consistently for an entire year provided me with good momentum. February was almost here, and it was time, and all this grind was gonna be worth it.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*Td709WCdmQmQiqjlbLDWiw.png)\n\n## Enter 2020\n\nAfter failing once and rising again, I got the second wind, it was time for me to give GSoC a second try. Google released the list of mentoring organizations on February 20, 2020. And already being experienced with the procedure once, I directly jumped onto the website and took few hours to go through almost all organizations, and shortlisted their projects to which I could contribute to.\n\n## Shortlisting Organizations and Projects\n\nThe approach I followed here was similar to last year — searching for categories, clicking each organization to see tags, and shortlisting them if tags matched my interest/skill. The project and the organization selection go hand in hand. Think of it as refining your interest, and finding a niche you want to work in. Take some time, maybe a whole evening, to go through all the organizations and make a spreadsheet or a document to list all the projects that match even 40% with your skillset or interest. With the experience I stated above in Part 1 and Part 2, this will be easier.\n\n> To shortlist projects, I generally looked at the requirements for the projects — which language, framework, or technology the organization wants the students to work with.\n\nNow that you have shortlisted the projects, the next step is reaching out to the mentors the way I described in PART 1. So I shortlisted some projects, but this time I was open to learning new things which looked challenging at first. Now for that, some organizations mention the difficulty level of the project where I made sure to pick up the ones which said ‘hard/challenging’ or ‘medium/intermediate’. It not only gives you less competition later since a lot of students aim for the low-hanging “easy” fruits but also a greater amount of experience.\n\nWith some analysis, done on projects from the past couple of years, I can say that since GSoC aims to ‘introduce’ university students to open-source development, many organizations have projects which mainly require full-stack development (UI+Logic+Database) skills. There are a lot of organizations with tags like — **JavaScript, React, Python, C/C++, NodeJS,** and\\*\\* any database (SQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB)\\*\\*. Less frequent tags include — Java, Docker, Git, Kubernetes, Redis etc. So if someone has experience with full-stack website/web app development, it gives them some confidence while going through the project list, and a little head start for the proposal\n\n## Why CERN-HSF (again)?\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*-Y1PfLUD-AK7iyIq6Bo_3A.png)\n\nAfter I went through all the organizations, I picked a few for me but I always knew I had to send one proposal to CERN, especially in Rucio. There are a lot of reasons for that — first of all the work environment and ethics were par excellence impressive, and I’m not even overselling here! And second, people at Rucio, especially Mario, helped me grow so much last year, even though I was a naive amateur. He had faith in me, and was with me till the end, and even after that!\n\nSo when I messaged him on Slack after a year, he welcome me with the same warmth and enthusiasm! There were two projects listed there, one related to NLP and the other one related to Desktop App Development. I had recently gained experience in NLP through Kaggle and personal projects, I wished to work with the first idea but finally proceeded with the latter because it was under his direct mentorship.\n\n## Drafting a (better) Proposal\n\nBeing associated with Rucio since 2019 gave me a head start in drafting the proposal. After having a brief discussion with Mario, I sent a mail to all mentors notifying them about which project I wish to work on. I started a proposal doc just the next day. Maybe this is why every generic blog on GSoC says to **“start early”**.\n\n> “In a long-distance relationship, communication is the key”\n\nI started searching the web to learn how to build desktop apps. I had long discussions with my other mentor, [Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-beermann-6a5132146/), who helped me with a lot of technical details regarding their software. After lots of research to find what’s best suited for our use case and eliminating the options, we finally settled to build an **Electron app** for Rucio, with **React** framework to develop the front end. There were very frequent discussions between me and my mentors, I even called up one of my mentors, [Gabriele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gfronze/), one evening to discuss a task in detail.\n\nI started writing my proposal and was getting more involved in the community. In early March, I attended their annual workshop remotely. even if I wasn’t able to understand all the topics from the talks/presentations, I stayed till the end of it for all three days, trying to squeeze any relevant information I could get a hold of. Getting involved in the community through these events is a very good opportunity to gather and show interest in the organization.\n\n![It was a long road going from my 2019 Proposal (left) to my 2020 proposal (right)](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*We3WVIqxfuJ9Zy2YJGz2Zw.png)\n\nI was proposing to develop a graphical user interface for a command-line interface (CLI) based software, so presenting some mock-ups was a mandatory practice. Here my designing skills came into play. After my initial research on how people prefer to use Rucio, I drafted some mock-ups on **Adobe XD** and sent them for review. After several iterations, all of us settled for a design. I even went a little overboard to define **Design Guidelines for Rucio**, which can be referenced by developers for future contributions to the project if it came to completion.\n\n![My proposal format (w/ useful annotations)](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*mTgCOYSIPx5-WcElmU6mSA.png)\n\n> *“A picture is worth a thousand words”. Remember this line always while drafting your proposal.*\n\nTherefore it is always good to include some [UML diagrams](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/uml/index.htm) to show the flow of the system you aim to develop. Throw in some code from their codebase which you wish to change, add some pseudo-code for any algorithm you wish to implement, necessary diagrams to explain the system design etc. This not only makes your proposal look beautiful but adds a touch of professionalism to it, which is highly appreciated!\n\nThe project required me to work mainly on improving the **[FUSE Filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace)**[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace)for Rucio, and developing a native desktop app using **[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)** and **[React JS](https://reactjs.org/)**, along with **[Redis](https://redis.io/)** and Python. Even though I did not know most of the technologies in required depth, I spent days and nights learning them and improved the proposal iteratively with all the suggestions and inputs from all four of my mentors! It finally turned out to be about a **16-page proposal**, as compared to my 6-page one from last year.\n\n> By the time I submitted the proposal on 31st March, I’ll say I was already hooked! I got so involved in that community that I couldn’t just ghost it to wait for the results.\n\nSo I kept in touch, kept learning the skills required for my project, and kept contributing to their repository. I did not have the slightest idea that my project will be selected or not, but still, I invested my time into the process because I loved doing that. And everything paid off!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*YdJO5Rp5zi4eVq6JmHEhWQ.png)\n\n## Lessons from my selection in 2020\n\n1. Keep working, because you want to improve; not just to get selected. GSoC is not the only aim, your passion to be a better developer and a real problem solver will take you places.\n2. Don’t hesitate to experiment and learn new challenging things. Have a [growth mindset,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiEeMN7vbQ) and never hesitate to ask the right questions. Don’t judge the level of your question/doubt yourself, chances are you’ll underestimate it.\n3. It’s the connections you make along the way which make all the difference. Everything has something to offer which you can learn, never leave an opportunity to connect with people and build a good network.\n4. The journey is everything! Document it for the world as your survival guide. Something which is obvious to you might be valuable advice to someone else.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*-Fw_7bv1469Tr8uG3fpoRQ.png)\n\nIf you read through the whole post, you would have realized by now that getting into a program like the Google Summer of Code is nothing close to a “mainstream” internship, where you clear the written/coding round, technical interview, and personal interview etc and you’ll have an offer letter. There is no preparation strategy or technical eligibility requirements to contribute to open-source. It’s more of a party where you introduce yourself to a bunch of strangers who later become a memorable part of your life.\n\n> “ Nothing in the world can take place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. “ — The Founder (2016)\n\nI tried my best to answer most of the questions [people asked me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/viveknigam3003_gsoc-googlesummerofcode-opensource-activity-6663712612779470850-aJIQ) or other platforms. If you wish to know about what GSoC is, what it offers, and benefits etc. there are numerous generic blogs that describe them in great detail by compiling all the information available across the internet. I thought it would be better to narrate an original journey rather than just spamming existing information here. There still are a lot of myths about GSoC, and people think of it as something unapproachable. Although I believe it is something that can be achieved by anyone who is *desperate enough* to add this feather to their cap by following discipline, consistency, and perseverance.\n\n**Thanks a TON!** for making it this far in this blog. I wish this blog justifies your time, and my journey and experience helps you in any way possible! I’m always up for healthy discussions, so ping me up if you have any ideas or thoughts you would like to share related to anything!\n\n*Until next time!*\n\nThis article was [originally published](https://medium.com/@viveknigam3003/getting-into-gsoc-20-with-cern-hsf-by-vivek-nigam-d7ec866c0533) on May 12 2020, via Medium", "timestamp": 1633587738, "digest": "6rsReU86vI65lm1Bz9tsC1R8igDza35zoOfdYx8twE4", "contributor": "0x246fd79365CA79BEB812B5635E8bE38453e2BF1C"}

I now personally believe that getting into a program like GSoC does not have a logically defined approach, but rather can be considered as a milestone in the journey towards becoming a better software developer.\n\nIf I were to decide the format for describing this journey, I would use a *present-past-present* format. I believe that analysing our failure with some depth and accepting our reality is the only way we can move in the direction of achieving our goals. Hence I divided this blog post into **3 parts** to capture the effect of storytelling.\n\n> *I believe that no success story is complete without narrating the failures, but patience is not a virtue of all, so I summarise the three parts below.*\n\n* If you wish to know about **my failure** and learn from my mistakes start reading from **PART 1** to get live through my journey.\n* If you just want to know how I **picked myself** and levelled up after failing, continue reading from **PART 2**.\n* And if you *only* want to know how I came back in the game, stronger than before. and **finally got into GSoC 2020**, you may directly skip to **PART 3**, but remember\n\n> “Teachings that do not speak of pain have no meaning, for humankind cannot gain anything in return.” — Itachi Uchiha\n\nFrom here I narrate my *journey* into the world of open-source and how it lead me towards getting accepted at CERN-HSF for Google Summer of Code 2020. And I would like to begin with the year 2019 when Open Source happened to me.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*SzqFewzrxt8oXqjRrsbWCg.png)\n\n## The year 2019\n\nThe year started with me returning from my winter internship at [Linux World Informatics Pvt. Ltd.](http://www.linuxworldindia.org/) (LW) after completing it successfully. I was now familiar with open-source software and several technologies including Hadoop, Dockers, Ansible, Python, and a Red Hat Certified System Administrator certificate in my arsenal. Now the next step was to apply for a summer internship, and what was better to aim than the renowned Google Summer of Code. So there I began my journey into the world of open-source development and to explore this Summer of Code program.\n\nOn a side note, I already applied for the Indian Academy of Sciences’ [Summer Research Fellowship Programme 2019 (SRFP)](https://medium.com/@viveknigam3003/my-experience-at-iit-b-during-srfp-2019-part-1-db55c11b76e8). The results were not released yet, but I had pretty much forgotten about this one. We’ll come to this later.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*iHPPa72N11sBI_JSDEGxEA.png)\n\nCreating a branch in GitHub\n\nBy this time I had a basic understanding of **Git and GitHub** and I was well versed with the concepts of **forking, branching, commits, push, making a pull request, and merging**. I would *thank* [Harshit Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helios1101/) for helping me out in learning all the basics! Being in my second year, I knew **JAVA**, **Python** and **C** along with standard knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I had done some courses on **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, and **Image processing**. My experience here was backed up by some projects, two of which I completed during my internship at LW.\n\nI knew I had to try for GSoC this year, so I started my research before the organizations were announced. Being a newbie, it was pretty hard for me to find the organizations whose projects matched my skill set. To be honest, CERN-HSF instantly caught my eye there, but after looking at their projects I could hardly understand a word!\n\n> *They had me in the first half, I’m not gonna lie* 😂\n\nI got a bit demotivated with this, but there was still hope that maybe this year one or the other project will be aligned with my interest and skills.\n\n## Begin, GSoC 2019.\n\nGoogle announced the organization on February 26, 2019. My hunt for projects started. I looked for some particular categories only which included tags like ‘machine learning, ‘Docker’, ‘Kubernetes’, ‘data analytics’, ‘cloud’, ‘python’, ‘java’, and ‘big data’ etc. since these were some keywords I was familiar with. With just these tags I narrowed down my search drastically to a handful of organizations — **CloudCV**, **Tungsten Fabric**, **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF),** and **CERN-HSF** (AWAKE, SWAN, and Rucio).\n\nThis process took me around *two weeks*, considering the workload from college academics and other minor club activities. I joined some **Slack** channels, **Gitter** chat, and **mailing lists.**\n\n> Getting into a new community can be overwhelming and can affect you with an [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). But at the end of the day, remember what you’re there for — to gather experience and exposure. To get out of you comfort zone and hustle your way in!\n\n## Reaching out to the mentors\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*TRZuuE-53jAn5T3te6P5IQ.png)\n\nSelecting an organization for GSoC 2019\n\nInitially, I could not understand the context of the messages and what people were talking about on the [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)! It is quite normal to get a fear of missing out (FOMO) when you’re new to any community. I mustered up my courage and without giving it any second thought sent some emails to the mentors from my shortlisted organizations describing —\n\n1. My basic introduction including my name, branch, college, and country.\n2. I wrote about which particular project I was interested in and why?\n3. Mentioned my achievements (whatsoever) till now and politely asked for an opportunity to discuss the project.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*iV-4jUoreSAVCVpdDRpY7w.png)\n\nA mail I sent to the Rucio (CERN-HSF) mentors. Mar 13, 2019.\n\nI was just able to mail Tungsten Fabric, AWAKE, SWAN, and Rucio (CERN-HSF), out of which there was some internal issue with the Tungsten Fabric’s mentor allotment so I did not receive any reply for a fairly long time. I received fairly quick replies from Mario (Rucio), Spencer (AWAKE), and Diogo (SWAN) and all of them invited me to **complete a set of tasks for assessment.**\n\nI started with the task right away but some of them seemed difficult to me at the first attempt. It took me some days to understand the given tasks. I tried my best to find whatever resources I could find to learn about them and solve the questions, in all my spare time. I focused on only these three tasks and dropped all other organizations, devoting all my efforts here.\n\nAnd here came another challenge — I had never worked in any large scale open-source organization, so I did not know the practices they followed. After numerous failed attempts, I successfully completed the tasks from Rucio and SWAN but was *unable to solve* all the tasks from AWAKE. Now it was time to create a pull request after making any minor contribution to their repository.\n\n> Generally, even a documentation fix counts as a contribution in Open Source Organizations!\n\nI mailed Diogo with the required solution files but did not get a reply. So SWAN also got eliminated from my list. Now I was left with **[Rucio](https://rucio.github.io/)**\\*\\* \\*\\*only! This was my last chance to get to the proposal stage since I had already invested a lot of time on the tasks themselves, there was no option to go back and choose another organization. When I tried making a pull request, I messed up a lot of times. [Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinbarisits/), who was one of the mentors, constantly helped me by correcting my mistakes and also notifying me about them. After some 4–5 tries, I finally merged [my first pull request](https://github.com/rucio/rucio/issues/2336) in the Rucio official codebase!\n\n> I would say there is nothing such as “official” or “unofficial” contribution with respect to GSoC. Every pull request you make that gets merged in the code base is credited against your name. That’s it. Your involvement in the community matters the most!\n\nWith whatever few weeks left before the deadline, I started a shared Google Doc between my two mentors and me to draft out the proposal for a project titled: *Collection Following Mechanism in Rucio*. It was a pretty basic proposal with just the essential sections and since this shall fail later it’ll be better if I discuss this in PART 3. 😅\n\nEven after starting so late, both my mentors, Mario and Martin, supported me a lot! 💖 They were there for me at almost every step! After submitting the proposal I forgot about it and became a silent observer for Rucio’s Slack workspace. On May 6th, 2020 the results were out and I realized what fate had for me. My proposal failed to get accepted for GSoC 2019! 🙁\n\n![I will return. Stronger.](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*dCmBLxIG4NDFhimrMZZt5Q.png)\n\n## Lessons learnt from my rejection in 2019\n\nAfter getting this rejection letter my mind was flooded with thoughts, feelings of dejection and self-loathing, with some confusion to top it off. I conveyed my failure to my mentor [Mario](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-lassnig/), and he humbly appreciated my effort and convinced me that there is no need to get disheartened; my proposal had the necessary things and there are some things beyond your control. He told me, “*having your name in the code base of a big organization always helps!* 😉” I thanked both my mentors for their effort, but I still needed some answers. I approached [Ruturaj Gujar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruturaj-gujar/), who got selected that year, congratulated him and politely clarified my doubts with him. He is an awesome guy and he helped me with enthusiasm! Collecting all my thoughts I wrote a note to myself on [Journey](https://2appstudio.com/journey/). I shall summarize it points below.\n\n![Note to Self. Screenshot from my phone.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*gzd2lWGBXY8hwpDTDdVXVA.png)\n\n1.

So after my rejection, I prepared myself to start the research work for this summer internship. It was a completely [different experience](https://medium.com/@viveknigam3003/my-experience-at-iit-b-during-srfp-2019-part-2-b1162825b715)!\n\n![The journey is everything!](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*ikYh6OfF9xakTZh7K5sP0g.png)\n\nIn August, I got an idea that would help people buy food at even cheaper rates from food ordering apps like Zomato and Swiggy, by pooling multiple orders together. I teamed up with another passionate and talented guy, [Hemabh Ravee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemabh-ravee/), and together we started learning about full-stack app development. We learned about **web-scraping**, **Dart language**, **Flutter framework** to develop native apps, **Flask** and Python to write our **own APIs**, using **Firebase** as back end, and deploying the app on **Heroku** and a lot of other things! We brought this idea to life in 36 hours during [Hack-a-BIT 2.0](https://hackabit.in/) in October 2019.\n\nWe called our brainchild — **[Gromnom: The food pooling app](https://github.com/hackabit19/Gromnom)**. It was a result of many sleepless nights, frustrating brainstorming sessions, and about a hundred cups of coffee! Taking part in a **hackathon** gives you a big skill boost if you’re serious about it and aim to pick up something you have never done before, for me it was building a native mobile app. It also gives you plenty of laptop stickers, t-shirts, goodies, and free food! 😁\n\nAt that time, participating in an open-source hackathon, learning full-stack app development, and building Gromnom from scratch gave me the right momentum which I needed to push myself into open-source software. And then came [Hacktoberfest 2019,](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) at the time when I needed it the most!\n\nThe main motivation for me to participate was to explore the world of open-source and also grab an exclusive Hacktoberfest T-Shirt and stickers! During this month-long event, we had to make at least 4 pull requests in *eligible* public repositories on GitHub, so it was a perfect opportunity. I hunted for some repos which had code written in either Python, JAVA, or C. And finally made more than 4 successful pull requests, thus qualifying the challenge!\n\nIn January 2020, I joined a Kaggle Competition — **[Real or Not? NLP with Disaster tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)**, in order to fulfil my long term desire of learning Natural Language Processing (NLP). I learned some frameworks like BERT, worked with libraries like NLTK, and trained my model on Google’s Auto ML which was a highlight of the competition. I later teamed up with my uncle, [Sampann Nigam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sampann-n-45546a2/), who helped me with improving my score. I finally achieved a score of 0.81288 against a benchmark of 0.81023 using AutoML and 0.83026 using BERT.\n\nWorking consistently for an entire year provided me with good momentum. February was almost here, and it was time, and all this grind was gonna be worth it.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*Td709WCdmQmQiqjlbLDWiw.png)\n\n## Enter 2020\n\nAfter failing once and rising again, I got the second wind, it was time for me to give GSoC a second try. Google released the list of mentoring organizations on February 20, 2020. And already being experienced with the procedure once, I directly jumped onto the website and took few hours to go through almost all organizations, and shortlisted their projects to which I could contribute to.\n\n## Shortlisting Organizations and Projects\n\nThe approach I followed here was similar to last year — searching for categories, clicking each organization to see tags, and shortlisting them if tags matched my interest/skill. The project and the organization selection go hand in hand. Think of it as refining your interest, and finding a niche you want to work in. Take some time, maybe a whole evening, to go through all the organizations and make a spreadsheet or a document to list all the projects that match even 40% with your skillset or interest. With the experience I stated above in Part 1 and Part 2, this will be easier.\n\n> To shortlist projects, I generally looked at the requirements for the projects — which language, framework, or technology the organization wants the students to work with.\n\nNow that you have shortlisted the projects, the next step is reaching out to the mentors the way I described in PART 1. So I shortlisted some projects, but this time I was open to learning new things which looked challenging at first. Now for that, some organizations mention the difficulty level of the project where I made sure to pick up the ones which said ‘hard/challenging’ or ‘medium/intermediate’. It not only gives you less competition later since a lot of students aim for the low-hanging “easy” fruits but also a greater amount of experience.\n\nWith some analysis, done on projects from the past couple of years, I can say that since GSoC aims to ‘introduce’ university students to open-source development, many organizations have projects which mainly require full-stack development (UI+Logic+Database) skills. There are a lot of organizations with tags like — **JavaScript, React, Python, C/C++, NodeJS,** and\\*\\* any database (SQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB)\\*\\*. Less frequent tags include — Java, Docker, Git, Kubernetes, Redis etc. So if someone has experience with full-stack website/web app development, it gives them some confidence while going through the project list, and a little head start for the proposal\n\n## Why CERN-HSF (again)?\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*-Y1PfLUD-AK7iyIq6Bo_3A.png)\n\nAfter I went through all the organizations, I picked a few for me but I always knew I had to send one proposal to CERN, especially in Rucio. There are a lot of reasons for that — first of all the work environment and ethics were par excellence impressive, and I’m not even overselling here! And second, people at Rucio, especially Mario, helped me grow so much last year, even though I was a naive amateur. He had faith in me, and was with me till the end, and even after that!\n\nSo when I messaged him on Slack after a year, he welcome me with the same warmth and enthusiasm! There were two projects listed there, one related to NLP and the other one related to Desktop App Development. I had recently gained experience in NLP through Kaggle and personal projects, I wished to work with the first idea but finally proceeded with the latter because it was under his direct mentorship.\n\n## Drafting a (better) Proposal\n\nBeing associated with Rucio since 2019 gave me a head start in drafting the proposal. After having a brief discussion with Mario, I sent a mail to all mentors notifying them about which project I wish to work on. I started a proposal doc just the next day. Maybe this is why every generic blog on GSoC says to **“start early”**.\n\n> “In a long-distance relationship, communication is the key”\n\nI started searching the web to learn how to build desktop apps. I had long discussions with my other mentor, [Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-beermann-6a5132146/), who helped me with a lot of technical details regarding their software. After lots of research to find what’s best suited for our use case and eliminating the options, we finally settled to build an **Electron app** for Rucio, with **React** framework to develop the front end. There were very frequent discussions between me and my mentors, I even called up one of my mentors, [Gabriele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gfronze/), one evening to discuss a task in detail.\n\nI started writing my proposal and was getting more involved in the community. In early March, I attended their annual workshop remotely. even if I wasn’t able to understand all the topics from the talks/presentations, I stayed till the end of it for all three days, trying to squeeze any relevant information I could get a hold of. Getting involved in the community through these events is a very good opportunity to gather and show interest in the organization.\n\n![It was a long road going from my 2019 Proposal (left) to my 2020 proposal (right)](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*We3WVIqxfuJ9Zy2YJGz2Zw.png)\n\nI was proposing to develop a graphical user interface for a command-line interface (CLI) based software, so presenting some mock-ups was a mandatory practice. Here my designing skills came into play. After my initial research on how people prefer to use Rucio, I drafted some mock-ups on **Adobe XD** and sent them for review. After several iterations, all of us settled for a design. I even went a little overboard to define **Design Guidelines for Rucio**, which can be referenced by developers for future contributions to the project if it came to completion.\n\n![My proposal format (w/ useful annotations)](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*mTgCOYSIPx5-WcElmU6mSA.png)\n\n> *“A picture is worth a thousand words”. Remember this line always while drafting your proposal.*\n\nTherefore it is always good to include some [UML diagrams](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/uml/index.htm) to show the flow of the system you aim to develop. Throw in some code from their codebase which you wish to change, add some pseudo-code for any algorithm you wish to implement, necessary diagrams to explain the system design etc. This not only makes your proposal look beautiful but adds a touch of professionalism to it, which is highly appreciated!\n\nThe project required me to work mainly on improving the **[FUSE Filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace)**[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace)for Rucio, and developing a native desktop app using **[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)** and **[React JS](https://reactjs.org/)**, along with **[Redis](https://redis.io/)** and Python. Even though I did not know most of the technologies in required depth, I spent days and nights learning them and improved the proposal iteratively with all the suggestions and inputs from all four of my mentors! It finally turned out to be about a **16-page proposal**, as compared to my 6-page one from last year.\n\n> By the time I submitted the proposal on 31st March, I’ll say I was already hooked! I got so involved in that community that I couldn’t just ghost it to wait for the results.\n\nSo I kept in touch, kept learning the skills required for my project, and kept contributing to their repository. I did not have the slightest idea that my project will be selected or not, but still, I invested my time into the process because I loved doing that. And everything paid off!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*YdJO5Rp5zi4eVq6JmHEhWQ.png)\n\n## Lessons from my selection in 2020\n\n1. Keep working, because you want to improve; not just to get selected. GSoC is not the only aim, your passion to be a better developer and a real problem solver will take you places.\n2. Don’t hesitate to experiment and learn new challenging things. Have a [growth mindset,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiEeMN7vbQ) and never hesitate to ask the right questions. Don’t judge the level of your question/doubt yourself, chances are you’ll underestimate it.\n3. It’s the connections you make along the way which make all the difference. Everything has something to offer which you can learn, never leave an opportunity to connect with people and build a good network.\n4. The journey is everything! Document it for the world as your survival guide. Something which is obvious to you might be valuable advice to someone else.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*-Fw_7bv1469Tr8uG3fpoRQ.png)\n\nIf you read through the whole post, you would have realized by now that getting into a program like the Google Summer of Code is nothing close to a “mainstream” internship, where you clear the written/coding round, technical interview, and personal interview etc and you’ll have an offer letter. There is no preparation strategy or technical eligibility requirements to contribute to open-source. It’s more of a party where you introduce yourself to a bunch of strangers who later become a memorable part of your life.\n\n> “ Nothing in the world can take place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. “ — The Founder (2016)\n\nI tried my best to answer most of the questions [people asked me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/viveknigam3003_gsoc-googlesummerofcode-opensource-activity-6663712612779470850-aJIQ) or other platforms. If you wish to know about what GSoC is, what it offers, and benefits etc. there are numerous generic blogs that describe them in great detail by compiling all the information available across the internet. I thought it would be better to narrate an original journey rather than just spamming existing information here. There still are a lot of myths about GSoC, and people think of it as something unapproachable. Although I believe it is something that can be achieved by anyone who is *desperate enough* to add this feather to their cap by following discipline, consistency, and perseverance.\n\n**Thanks a TON!** for making it this far in this blog. I wish this blog justifies your time, and my journey and experience helps you in any way possible!

I now personally believe that getting into a program like GSoC does not have a logically defined approach, but rather can be considered as a milestone in the journey towards becoming a better software developer.\n\nIf I were to decide the format for describing this journey, I would use a *present-past-present* format. I believe that analysing our failure with some depth and accepting our reality is the only way we can move in the direction of achieving our goals. Hence I divided this blog post into **3 parts** to capture the effect of storytelling.\n\n> *I believe that no success story is complete without narrating the failures, but patience is not a virtue of all, so I summarise the three parts below.*\n\n* If you wish to know about **my failure** and learn from my mistakes start reading from **PART 1** to get live through my journey.\n* If you just want to know how I **picked myself** and levelled up after failing, continue reading from **PART 2**.\n* And if you *only* want to know how I came back in the game, stronger than before. and **finally got into GSoC 2020**, you may directly skip to **PART 3**, but remember\n\n> “Teachings that do not speak of pain have no meaning, for humankind cannot gain anything in return.” — Itachi Uchiha\n\nFrom here I narrate my *journey* into the world of open-source and how it lead me towards getting accepted at CERN-HSF for Google Summer of Code 2020. And I would like to begin with the year 2019 when Open Source happened to me.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*SzqFewzrxt8oXqjRrsbWCg.png)\n\n## The year 2019\n\nThe year started with me returning from my winter internship at [Linux World Informatics Pvt. Ltd.](http://www.linuxworldindia.org/) (LW) after completing it successfully. I was now familiar with open-source software and several technologies including Hadoop, Dockers, Ansible, Python, and a Red Hat Certified System Administrator certificate in my arsenal. Now the next step was to apply for a summer internship, and what was better to aim than the renowned Google Summer of Code. So there I began my journey into the world of open-source development and to explore this Summer of Code program.\n\nOn a side note, I already applied for the Indian Academy of Sciences’ [Summer Research Fellowship Programme 2019 (SRFP)](https://medium.com/@viveknigam3003/my-experience-at-iit-b-during-srfp-2019-part-1-db55c11b76e8). The results were not released yet, but I had pretty much forgotten about this one. We’ll come to this later.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*iHPPa72N11sBI_JSDEGxEA.png)\n\nCreating a branch in GitHub\n\nBy this time I had a basic understanding of **Git and GitHub** and I was well versed with the concepts of **forking, branching, commits, push, making a pull request, and merging**. I would *thank* [Harshit Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helios1101/) for helping me out in learning all the basics! Being in my second year, I knew **JAVA**, **Python** and **C** along with standard knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I had done some courses on **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, and **Image processing**. My experience here was backed up by some projects, two of which I completed during my internship at LW.\n\nI knew I had to try for GSoC this year, so I started my research before the organizations were announced. Being a newbie, it was pretty hard for me to find the organizations whose projects matched my skill set. To be honest, CERN-HSF instantly caught my eye there, but after looking at their projects I could hardly understand a word!\n\n> *They had me in the first half, I’m not gonna lie* 😂\n\nI got a bit demotivated with this, but there was still hope that maybe this year one or the other project will be aligned with my interest and skills.\n\n## Begin, GSoC 2019.\n\nGoogle announced the organization on February 26, 2019. My hunt for projects started. I looked for some particular categories only which included tags like ‘machine learning, ‘Docker’, ‘Kubernetes’, ‘data analytics’, ‘cloud’, ‘python’, ‘java’, and ‘big data’ etc. since these were some keywords I was familiar with. With just these tags I narrowed down my search drastically to a handful of organizations — **CloudCV**, **Tungsten Fabric**, **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF),** and **CERN-HSF** (AWAKE, SWAN, and Rucio).\n\nThis process took me around *two weeks*, considering the workload from college academics and other minor club activities. I joined some **Slack** channels, **Gitter** chat, and **mailing lists.**\n\n> Getting into a new community can be overwhelming and can affect you with an [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). But at the end of the day, remember what you’re there for — to gather experience and exposure. To get out of you comfort zone and hustle your way in!\n\n## Reaching out to the mentors\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*TRZuuE-53jAn5T3te6P5IQ.png)\n\nSelecting an organization for GSoC 2019\n\nInitially, I could not understand the context of the messages and what people were talking about on the [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)! It is quite normal to get a fear of missing out (FOMO) when you’re new to any community. I mustered up my courage and without giving it any second thought sent some emails to the mentors from my shortlisted organizations describing —\n\n1. My basic introduction including my name, branch, college, and country.\n2. I wrote about which particular project I was interested in and why?\n3. Mentioned my achievements (whatsoever) till now and politely asked for an opportunity to discuss the project.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*iV-4jUoreSAVCVpdDRpY7w.png)\n\nA mail I sent to the Rucio (CERN-HSF) mentors. Mar 13, 2019.\n\nI was just able to mail Tungsten Fabric, AWAKE, SWAN, and Rucio (CERN-HSF), out of which there was some internal issue with the Tungsten Fabric’s mentor allotment so I did not receive any reply for a fairly long time. I received fairly quick replies from Mario (Rucio), Spencer (AWAKE), and Diogo (SWAN) and all of them invited me to **complete a set of tasks for assessment.**\n\nI started with the task right away but some of them seemed difficult to me at the first attempt. It took me some days to understand the given tasks. I tried my best to find whatever resources I could find to learn about them and solve the questions, in all my spare time. I focused on only these three tasks and dropped all other organizations, devoting all my efforts here.\n\nAnd here came another challenge — I had never worked in any large scale open-source organization, so I did not know the practices they followed. After numerous failed attempts, I successfully completed the tasks from Rucio and SWAN but was *unable to solve* all the tasks from AWAKE. Now it was time to create a pull request after making any minor contribution to their repository.\n\n> Generally, even a documentation fix counts as a contribution in Open Source Organizations!\n\nI mailed Diogo with the required solution files but did not get a reply. So SWAN also got eliminated from my list. Now I was left with **[Rucio](https://rucio.github.io/)**\\*\\* \\*\\*only! This was my last chance to get to the proposal stage since I had already invested a lot of time on the tasks themselves, there was no option to go back and choose another organization. When I tried making a pull request, I messed up a lot of times. [Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinbarisits/), who was one of the mentors, constantly helped me by correcting my mistakes and also notifying me about them. After some 4–5 tries, I finally merged [my first pull request](https://github.com/rucio/rucio/issues/2336) in the Rucio official codebase!\n\n> I would say there is nothing such as “official” or “unofficial” contribution with respect to GSoC. Every pull request you make that gets merged in the code base is credited against your name. That’s it. Your involvement in the community matters the most!\n\nWith whatever few weeks left before the deadline, I started a shared Google Doc between my two mentors and me to draft out the proposal for a project titled: *Collection Following Mechanism in Rucio*. It was a pretty basic proposal with just the essential sections and since this shall fail later it’ll be better if I discuss this in PART 3. 😅\n\nEven after starting so late, both my mentors, Mario and Martin, supported me a lot! 💖 They were there for me at almost every step! After submitting the proposal I forgot about it and became a silent observer for Rucio’s Slack workspace. On May 6th, 2020 the results were out and I realized what fate had for me. My proposal failed to get accepted for GSoC 2019! 🙁\n\n![I will return. Stronger.](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*dCmBLxIG4NDFhimrMZZt5Q.png)\n\n## Lessons learnt from my rejection in 2019\n\nAfter getting this rejection letter my mind was flooded with thoughts, feelings of dejection and self-loathing, with some confusion to top it off. I conveyed my failure to my mentor [Mario](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-lassnig/), and he humbly appreciated my effort and convinced me that there is no need to get disheartened; my proposal had the necessary things and there are some things beyond your control. He told me, “*having your name in the code base of a big organization always helps!* 😉” I thanked both my mentors for their effort, but I still needed some answers. I approached [Ruturaj Gujar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruturaj-gujar/), who got selected that year, congratulated him and politely clarified my doubts with him. He is an awesome guy and he helped me with enthusiasm! Collecting all my thoughts I wrote a note to myself on [Journey](https://2appstudio.com/journey/). I shall summarize it points below.\n\n![Note to Self. Screenshot from my phone.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*gzd2lWGBXY8hwpDTDdVXVA.png)\n\n1. Make connections with people from companies whose work inspires you. Having a good connection never hurts, but making one takes effort.\n2. Keep watching for updates on the Slack channel or other IRC you’re part of. It is often really informative and you get to know the community better.\n3. Make an unbeatable proposal by adding professional-looking diagrams, mock-ups, and necessary code snippets. Justify the time you’re going to spend during the summer in your proposal.\n4. Be open to different options and look for opportunities to learn. Don’t stick to a particular skillset just because you think you know it.\n5. Keep grinding, nothing can beat persistence; especially when contributing to open source.\n\n![“Sorry, Some other time…”](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\*NgGWy8qCg2VpU_9JSvHKIQ.gif)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*M8PF6FWoveUyv7NkM899jg.png)\n\n## The journey from 2019 to 2020\n\nDuring the application period, the results for IAS SRFP 2019 were out and I was selected to work in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) department at IIT Bombay! So after my rejection, I prepared myself to start the research work for this summer internship. It was a completely [different experience](https://medium.com/@viveknigam3003/my-experience-at-iit-b-during-srfp-2019-part-2-b1162825b715)!\n\n![The journey is everything!](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*ikYh6OfF9xakTZh7K5sP0g.png)\n\nIn August, I got an idea that would help people buy food at even cheaper rates from food ordering apps like Zomato and Swiggy, by pooling multiple orders together. I teamed up with another passionate and talented guy, [Hemabh Ravee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemabh-ravee/), and together we started learning about full-stack app development. We learned about **web-scraping**, **Dart language**, **Flutter framework** to develop native apps, **Flask** and Python to write our **own APIs**, using **Firebase** as back end, and deploying the app on **Heroku** and a lot of other things! We brought this idea to life in 36 hours during [Hack-a-BIT 2.0](https://hackabit.in/) in October 2019.\n\nWe called our brainchild — **[Gromnom: The food pooling app](https://github.com/hackabit19/Gromnom)**.

I hunted for some repos which had code written in either Python, JAVA, or C.

NLP with Disaster tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)**, in order to fulfil my long term desire of learning Natural Language Processing (NLP). I learned some frameworks like BERT, worked with libraries like NLTK, and trained my model on Google’s Auto ML which was a highlight of the competition. I later teamed up with my uncle, [Sampann Nigam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sampann-n-45546a2/), who helped me with improving my score. I finally achieved a score of 0.81288 against a benchmark of 0.81023 using AutoML and 0.83026 using BERT.\n\nWorking consistently for an entire year provided me with good momentum. February was almost here, and it was time, and all this grind was gonna be worth it.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*Td709WCdmQmQiqjlbLDWiw.png)\n\n## Enter 2020\n\nAfter failing once and rising again, I got the second wind, it was time for me to give GSoC a second try.

Take some time, maybe a whole evening, to go through all the organizations and make a spreadsheet or a document to list all the projects that match even 40% with your skillset or interest. With the experience I stated above in Part 1 and Part 2, this will be easier.\n\n> To shortlist projects, I generally looked at the requirements for the projects — which language, framework, or technology the organization wants the students to work with.\n\nNow that you have shortlisted the projects, the next step is reaching out to the mentors the way I described in PART 1. So I shortlisted some projects, but this time I was open to learning new things which looked challenging at first. Now for that, some organizations mention the difficulty level of the project where I made sure to pick up the ones which said ‘hard/challenging’ or ‘medium/intermediate’. It not only gives you less competition later since a lot of students aim for the low-hanging “easy” fruits but also a greater amount of experience.\n\nWith some analysis, done on projects from the past couple of years, I can say that since GSoC aims to ‘introduce’ university students to open-source development, many organizations have projects which mainly require full-stack development (UI+Logic+Database) skills. There are a lot of organizations with tags like — **JavaScript, React, Python, C/C++, NodeJS,** and\\*\\* any database (SQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB)\\*\\*. Less frequent tags include — Java, Docker, Git, Kubernetes, Redis etc. So if someone has experience with full-stack website/web app development, it gives them some confidence while going through the project list, and a little head start for the proposal\n\n## Why CERN-HSF (again)?\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*-Y1PfLUD-AK7iyIq6Bo_3A.png)\n\nAfter I went through all the organizations, I picked a few for me but I always knew I had to send one proposal to CERN, especially in Rucio. There are a lot of reasons for that — first of all the work environment and ethics were par excellence impressive, and I’m not even overselling here! And second, people at Rucio, especially Mario, helped me grow so much last year, even though I was a naive amateur. He had faith in me, and was with me till the end, and even after that!\n\nSo when I messaged him on Slack after a year, he welcome me with the same warmth and enthusiasm! There were two projects listed there, one related to NLP and the other one related to Desktop App Development. I had recently gained experience in NLP through Kaggle and personal projects, I wished to work with the first idea but finally proceeded with the latter because it was under his direct mentorship.\n\n## Drafting a (better) Proposal\n\nBeing associated with Rucio since 2019 gave me a head start in drafting the proposal. After having a brief discussion with Mario, I sent a mail to all mentors notifying them about which project I wish to work on. I started a proposal doc just the next day. Maybe this is why every generic blog on GSoC says to **“start early”**.\n\n> “In a long-distance relationship, communication is the key”\n\nI started searching the web to learn how to build desktop apps. I had long discussions with my other mentor, [Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-beermann-6a5132146/), who helped me with a lot of technical details regarding their software. After lots of research to find what’s best suited for our use case and eliminating the options, we finally settled to build an **Electron app** for Rucio, with **React** framework to develop the front end. There were very frequent discussions between me and my mentors, I even called up one of my mentors, [Gabriele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gfronze/), one evening to discuss a task in detail.\n\nI started writing my proposal and was getting more involved in the community. In early March, I attended their annual workshop remotely. even if I wasn’t able to understand all the topics from the talks/presentations, I stayed till the end of it for all three days, trying to squeeze any relevant information I could get a hold of. Getting involved in the community through these events is a very good opportunity to gather and show interest in the organization.\n\n![It was a long road going from my 2019 Proposal (left) to my 2020 proposal (right)](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*We3WVIqxfuJ9Zy2YJGz2Zw.png)\n\nI was proposing to develop a graphical user interface for a command-line interface (CLI) based software, so presenting some mock-ups was a mandatory practice. Here my designing skills came into play. After my initial research on how people prefer to use Rucio, I drafted some mock-ups on **Adobe XD** and sent them for review. After several iterations, all of us settled for a design. I even went a little overboard to define **Design Guidelines for Rucio**, which can be referenced by developers for future contributions to the project if it came to completion.\n\n![My proposal format (w/ useful annotations)](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*mTgCOYSIPx5-WcElmU6mSA.png)\n\n> *“A picture is worth a thousand words”. Remember this line always while drafting your proposal.*\n\nTherefore it is always good to include some [UML diagrams](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/uml/index.htm) to show the flow of the system you aim to develop. Throw in some code from their codebase which you wish to change, add some pseudo-code for any algorithm you wish to implement, necessary diagrams to explain the system design etc. This not only makes your proposal look beautiful but adds a touch of professionalism to it, which is highly appreciated!\n\nThe project required me to work mainly on improving the **[FUSE Filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace)**[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace)for Rucio, and developing a native desktop app using **[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)** and **[React JS](https://reactjs.org/)**, along with **[Redis](https://redis.io/)** and Python. Even though I did not know most of the technologies in required depth, I spent days and nights learning them and improved the proposal iteratively with all the suggestions and inputs from all four of my mentors! It finally turned out to be about a **16-page proposal**, as compared to my 6-page one from last year.\n\n> By the time I submitted the proposal on 31st March, I’ll say I was already hooked! I got so involved in that community that I couldn’t just ghost it to wait for the results.\n\nSo I kept in touch, kept learning the skills required for my project, and kept contributing to their repository. I did not have the slightest idea that my project will be selected or not, but still, I invested my time into the process because I loved doing that. And everything paid off!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*YdJO5Rp5zi4eVq6JmHEhWQ.png)\n\n## Lessons from my selection in 2020\n\n1. Keep working, because you want to improve; not just to get selected. GSoC is not the only aim, your passion to be a better developer and a real problem solver will take you places.\n2. Don’t hesitate to experiment and learn new challenging things. Have a [growth mindset,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiEeMN7vbQ) and never hesitate to ask the right questions. Don’t judge the level of your question/doubt yourself, chances are you’ll underestimate it.\n3. It’s the connections you make along the way which make all the difference. Everything has something to offer which you can learn, never leave an opportunity to connect with people and build a good network.\n4. The journey is everything! Document it for the world as your survival guide. Something which is obvious to you might be valuable advice to someone else.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*-Fw_7bv1469Tr8uG3fpoRQ.png)\n\nIf you read through the whole post, you would have realized by now that getting into a program like the Google Summer of Code is nothing close to a “mainstream” internship, where you clear the written/coding round, technical interview, and personal interview etc and you’ll have an offer letter. There is no preparation strategy or technical eligibility requirements to contribute to open-source. It’s more of a party where you introduce yourself to a bunch of strangers who later become a memorable part of your life.\n\n> “ Nothing in the world can take place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. “ — The Founder (2016)\n\nI tried my best to answer most of the questions [people asked me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/viveknigam3003_gsoc-googlesummerofcode-opensource-activity-6663712612779470850-aJIQ) or other platforms. If you wish to know about what GSoC is, what it offers, and benefits etc. there are numerous generic blogs that describe them in great detail by compiling all the information available across the internet. I thought it would be better to narrate an original journey rather than just spamming existing information here. There still are a lot of myths about GSoC, and people think of it as something unapproachable. Although I believe it is something that can be achieved by anyone who is *desperate enough* to add this feather to their cap by following discipline, consistency, and perseverance.\n\n**Thanks a TON!** for making it this far in this blog. I wish this blog justifies your time, and my journey and experience helps you in any way possible! I’m always up for healthy discussions, so ping me up if you have any ideas or thoughts you would like to share related to anything!\n\n*Until next time!*", "timestamp": 1633587060, "digest": "6rsReU86vI65lm1Bz9tsC1R8igDza35zoOfdYx8twE4", "contributor": "0x246fd79365CA79BEB812B5635E8bE38453e2BF1C"}

This is the first of three seasons for BLVKHVND Year One.\n\n*BLVKHVND aims to tell a comprehensive fictional narrative story about the HVND. As such, each year (in current form) is a narrative arc spanning three seasons. These seasons build on each other providing LORE scattered throughout NFT drops, community events, and other immersive experiences.  Story content is available for members and non members alike.*\n\n## Story\n\n*Land of the HVND:* Black Marrow is a special material that is both super-light, and incredibly dense. It's cultivated from the bones of an ancient giant race that once roamed the Earth. A special faction called the HVND operates in secret pockets around the globe, subtly influencing events to benefit their agenda. Ancient rituals (hand holding ceremonies) performed in specific ruins fill black marrow with a special force that reacts differently to each user. A new faction surfaces, threatening peace on Earth if the HVND is not wiped off the face of the planet.\n\nChaos ensues.\n\n### The Pledge\n\n> `We, of the black, rise.`\n>\n> `We, of the HVND, hold.`\n>\n> `Tis the season of affluence;`\n>\n> `Lock bone with my family beside me`\n>\n> `Go forth and reap the bounty, `\n>\n> `before the Day comes to defile thee.`\n>\n> `~ Night Commander Darcel`\n\nThe endless night continues, and the HVND continues to rise. Join the ranks and celebrate with us as the Season of Affluence propagates.\n\nAt the *Horizon*, the *Day* threatens our peace. Let us band together, collect our Marrow and fortify our stronghold so that we will not be swept away.\n\n![Peer into the eyes and you shall be rewarded.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gZTxGhrYr0RXHYzlQ3mxo.png?height=2048&width=2048)\n\n\n---\n\n## Activities + Calendar\n\n![Calendar + Events](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b59FL2sEeR2VFOa75duIB.jpg?height=1484&width=1460&&&size=medium)\n\n### October\n\n* **BLVKHVND Scouting Combine**\n\n  The scouting combine takes place October 10 - 20th. More information related to the event can be found here: [Combine Announcement](https://blvkhvnd.mirror.xyz/RUqAlK1kulwkmiaRDZlSjXBMZWV90wpdWcebHTRBnY0)\n* **Community Vote**\n\n  The Community Vote was a success! With over 5k votes, the community selected Illuvium as our fifth and final game for our competitive division to tackle into 2022’s competitive circuit. More info can be found here: [Community Vote](https://blvkhvnd.mirror.xyz/5SLNQyX_-K7iiKocWR3jlTWv0r2zFZGE8pYIxFIey6U)\n* **HVND 2022 Team Roster Announcement**\n\n  As we complete the combine, we will announce our team members that the HVND community signs on. We are super excited to meet our players.\n* **Monster Mash Open Invitational Tournament**\n\n  Our goal is to host a successful live broadcasted tournament to bring crypto-native gaming to our existing non-crypto community, and develop on-ramps to earn crypto for them and our newer members. The Monster Mash is not just a name, we aim to create a thematic experience for active participants and viewers with competitions related to gaming and culture are open and available to enjoy.\n\n  This tournament also acts as a stress test for our newly formed esports teams to help them develop early chemistry as they begin to play with each other for the first time.\n\n### November - December\n\n* **Community “Let’s Play” Events**\n\n  We wouldn’t be a gaming DAO if we didn’t play games together. We’ll be opening up our calendars and our thumbs to organize DAO wide “let’s play” events to build camaraderie and respect amongst each other with the games we love. These are always opt-in fun, you can be a member and never pick up a controller—we love you all the same.\n* **Holiday NFT Drop**\n\n  Tis the Season of Affluence. We come bearing gifts. Please visit us at the `HVNDS OF TREASURED GOODS` for all your wants and desires. We’re upgrading our shop to include some incredible wares both digital and IRL.\n* **House of The HVND** \n\n  You didn’t think we wouldn’t broadcast our games right? We’re teaming up with [Glass Protocol](https://glass.xyz) to build an exclusive streaming portal for our HVND members and LP HVNDS. There, you’ll find a new way to enjoy watching content and engaging with our streaming community. \n* **$BALM Development**\n\n  A Protocol for Asset Borrowing. We are actively building a more inclusive and approachable means to acquire playable assets for the best crypto-native games. We intend to kickoff a more substantial push for development toward the end of the season. Keep it locked for more details.\n* **LOOT20 Project Reveal**\n\n  A side project as a result of a chance investment in the original LOOT NFTs, an opportunity presented itself to work on a project that incorporates LOOT and its derivatives in a wrapper to create, deploy, and play DnD (Dungeons and Dragons) style campaigns. \n\n## Season Pass\n\n**Season of Affluence** kicks off our first ever pathway for community activities through storytelling. We hope that it helps community members earn rewards and contribute to the HVND through participating in events, completing challenges, being active on social, engaging in defi & NFTs. Seasons also offer additional exclusive rewards for community members to earn with premium access and story NFTs.\n\n**How Does it Work?**\n\n* Each week a set of tasks are given for members to complete to progress to the next level within the season pass.\n* At the end of each week, a snapshot is gathered to capture task completion for players to redeem their rewards.\n* For players that complete all rewards, a special set of tasks can be completed for additional story content and more.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7sz7Goss8mmDbOg7Ml-BJ.jpg?height=3452&width=2589)\n\n### Season Pass NFT\n\nThe Season of Affluence NFT will be made available for purchase on Oct 10. A snapshot will be taken of all existing holders of 100 $HVND tokens, HVND of ACCESS, and, HVND of AFFLUENCE NFTS on Oct 8th at 9pm EST. For non-members and members of the HVND that do not have a full membership, you will be able to fill out a request form on Oct 9th at 12pm EST. That form will include you into the initial drop of Season Passes.\n\n`[Season Pass Request Form opens 12pm EST on October 9th, 2021]`\n\n## Rewards\n\n![Season of Affluence Reward Chart](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nXr985OmtrQvt3bDJqdxQ.jpg?height=1000&width=2000&&&size=large)\n\n* PFP NFT - `ACOYLTE’S PLEDGE`\n* Cover Background NFT - `SANCTIMONIOUS CEREMONY` \n* Season Pass POAP - `SEASON OF AFFLUENCE BADGE`\n* (Up to) 100 $HVND - `33 HVND free` |  `100 HVND premium` \n* Special Shoutout - `SPECIAL LIVE BROADCAST`\n* Custom Event - `TBD` \n* New Discord Role + Badge - `SEASON 1 PRIVATE DISCORD CHANNEL`\n* and more - `REVEALED UPON PASS COMPLETION`\n\n**All season pass rewards must be redeemed within the duration of the SEASON.** Because we do not have a real-time method to mint NFTs upon an individual player’s completion, we will not mint more NFTs past the end date of this season. Depending on the success of this season and the bandwidth afforded to us, we may revisit this toward the end of the year.\n\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n1. **How does this NFT work with existing Access and Crowdfund NFTs?**\n\n   For our members who own the crowdfund and access nfts, they play a role in establishing the lore of this season and can be used in a special way toward the completion of the season’s events. For the HVND of ACCESS NFT specifically, these were made to address folks who did not participate in the crowdfund and/or could not receive a crowdfund NFT (due to contract error)—so these special NFTs have modifying properties to some of the rewards found within the season pass. More info related to these NFTs will be revealed as you complete your pass!\n2. **How do we participate in the premium reward tier?**\n\n   By purchasing the SEASON PASS NFT. The SEASON PASS NFT will be limited to 1 purchase per person with $HVND members and NFT holders already added to the queue.\n\n\n---\n\n***BLVKHVND*** *(Black Hand) is a dSports gaming community focused on competitive play, content creation, and accessibility to support gamers, collaborate with developers, amplify creatives, and decentralized the industry as a whole.

Undeniably, \"Happiness \" has become one of the major topics, especially after people step into a brand new world where economy grows rapidly.\n\nCan we bracket money with happiness, or vice versa? From a modern and well-reasoned perspective, the answer is definitely false. It's widely acknowledged that we no longer simply concern the material world and that those who merely cares about money must be a savage. We now attach more importance to spiritual comforts, like enjoying the flowers, wandering around a book fair and so on, which also corresponds to the advancement of human civilization.\n\nEven so, allegations have it that we cannot move a single step without money. Money itself is essential and integral, a solid truth. Then, what else can we derive provided there's enough money to sustain our life? Here stands a contradiction between reality and ideals. Naturally we hold that \"the more, the better \", which is interpreted by many people as \"the more property we possess, the more secure we will be in future \", so we blindly crave for wealth and influence, supposing those things can bring us enough security that is the cradle of happiness. However, the outcome is often incompatible with our original expectation. Instead, those billionaires are more prone to be depressed in their twilight years or earlier and even show suicidal tendencies. What's wrong? Sheer confusion of the relation between money and happiness. In point of fact, money only serve our basic material needs, with the exception of this function, money truly has nothing to do with our living standard.\n\nIn a highly competitive society, many are compelled to abandon inner peace in favor of profits, while the crux of the matter lies in how we perceive happiness and how can that be in line with the money? I deem that however the situation alters, we should always be conscious enough to pay attention to something that really makes us happy.", "timestamp": 1633596530, "digest": "lRHQfUCSXE2df2I4omMv9KlEZwG4s6bnVfd7pm4FNO0", "contributor": "0x078Ad5270b0240D8529f600f35A271Fc6E2b2bD8"}
