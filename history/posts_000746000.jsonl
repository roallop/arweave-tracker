I’ve been thinking more and more about this concept of modern friends recently, particularly because I’ve made a lot of them this year.\n\nPerhaps I am even writing about friendship in the first place because I realize now more than ever how rare it is, and more importantly, how immeasurable in value it is. This past week, I reread one of my favorite books, [*On Friendship*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27409858-on-friendship) by Alexander Nehamas, which I believe should be read by all of us who care about our friends:\n\n> *“My own view is that friendship is essential to our becoming who we are. It provides a context within which we can, more or less safely, try different ways of being, different approaches to life, and our friends, to whom we open ourselves and by whom we are willing to be influenced and directed, play a central role in what becomes of us.”* — Alexander Nehamas\n\nFriendship has never been easy to understand or define — even [Michel de Montaigne](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/montaigne/), in his essay “[Of Friendship](http://naomigryn.com/Ebooks/Of-Friendship-Montaigne.pdf),” found it impossible to account for all the reasons why he loved his closest friend. But these questions and parameters have only become more muddled since we began interacting with friends (and strangers, too) in digital spaces. How do we define a friendship in a virtual world? What is the value of a Facebook friend, or a follow on Twitter? And what happens when the line between IRL and URL becomes too blurred to distinguish?\n\nThe Internet is [really big](https://www.worldwidewebsize.com/), and it can also be [really lonely](https://www.cnet.com/features/how-tech-and-social-media-are-making-us-feel-lonelier-than-ever/). “Part of the problem of social media is that there is no equivalent to the scientific glassblowers’ sign, or the woodworker’s open door, or Dafna and Jesse’s sandwich boards,” writes [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/). **“On the internet, if you stop speaking, you disappear.”** To me, maintaining some sense of activity and intimacy in online spaces is a bit like [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu), like a call into the crowd: *I am here*.

And, for better or for worse, it’s an always-on megaphone to share what’s on your mind.\n\nTo differentiate between our friends, our modern friends, our acquaintances, our colleagues, and everything in between, we can look to [Dunbar’s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number), which states that we can maintain some level of *knowing* a person across 150 people.

That’s up to you.\n\n> *“We are lent into each other’s keeping.”* — [Tomasz Tunguz](https://tomtunguz.com/lent-into-each-others-keeping/)\n\nI never thought my tribe would consist of so many modern friends.

{"id": "5KDoAom_qm3NQXyX1IkVAlL6-OjJqFn982nUIRa7ncY", "title": "The Opening", "body": "I like to think of investing in new things a bit like a football running play. Imagine you are the running back. You’ve been handed the football and you are looking for a hole to open up and run through. What you really want is some running room beyond the opening.\n\nWe’ve known for a while that crypto is the next big tech architecture. We’ve known that once the wave breaks on the shore, there will be enormous opportunities unleashed. Like the web. Like mobile. Like the PC.\n\nBut what has been hard to see is the opening. It wasn’t trading/speculating, although that has been huge. Coinbase announced yesterday that 68 million verified users. It wasn’t DeFi, although that has also been huge.\n\nWhat we have been looking for is the consumer opportunity to emerge. Until you have billions of consumers around the world using a technology, you don’t have a new wave to ride. So like the running back, you wait and hope you don’t get hit.\n\nBut in the last few months, the opening is emerging. In slow motion. I can see the left tackle move his man off the line. I can see the left guard move his man off the line. And there is running room. The defensive backs are on the other side of the field.\n\nI’ve always thought the opening would be at the intersection of gaming, online communities, and social networks. Why? Because those are the mainstream consumer experiences where geeks tend to be the first adopters.\n\nBut it is hard to take on the existing gaming companies with a new architecture. The user experience around new stuff always sucks and who wants to play a game with a shitty UI? It is also hard to take on the existing social nets. Why would someone with a million followers on Instagram or TikTok or Twitter leave those behind for a new social net? So the existing incumbents are the defensive line. They look impenetrable. Until they aren’t. That’s when the opening emerges.\n\nThe opening is emerging around NFT experiences, [something we’ve been excited about for quite a while now](https://avc.com/2018/05/video-of-the-week-dieter-shirley-and-non-fungible-tokens/). But not the NFTs that Sothebys sells for $69mm. Not even the CryptoPunk that sells for $7.5mm. But when [a party](https://avc.com/2021/08/funding-friday-partybid/) emerges online that anyone is invited to attend and the 500 person group picks up a punk with a party hat and they all change their social network avatar to this, well that got my attention.\n\n![](https://avc.com/content/uploads/2021/08/https\\_\\__bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images\\_32fc8190-ddb5-4409-bd66-721018a06b7a\\_786x786.png)\n\nPartyBid is cool. That’s why I wrote about it on Friday. [TopShot](https://avc.com/2020/08/nba-top-shot-2/) is cool. And so is Axie. And so is the Bored Ape Yacht Club. But what is cooler is that these NFT experiences are operating at the interaction of gaming, communities, and social nets. And they are not taking on any of the incumbents directly. They are building on top of them all.\n\nI am not saying NFTs are the next big thing. I am saying that consumer experiences built on a crypto stack are the next big thing. I am saying that NFT experiences are showing the way. They are the left tackle that you can run behind into the opening. Where enormous opportunity exists.\n", "timestamp": 1628681471, "digest": "rjT0_tFp1AQFgRHzLWc6uSyIkwfxxYHMbXQXY6j-bG8", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

Ticket holders began their portal travel towards the faraway world of Elektra. By digging for clues and decrypting hidden messages, travellers have so far unlocked Elektra's Sonic Forcefield, landed on the surface of Elektra, found an ancient letter from a group called The Zeph, and discovered a [Log device with a message on it from Cat & Alpha](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/HaQAd8PInTpf-I7EUzqDh03JVpwJX3oQmZzBpAZcKqo) -- 2 travellers who got swept into a blackhole along the way to Elektra.

We are currently in the middle of Phase 1. More info related to the project roadmap will soon be available of elektra.camp\n\n### Phase 1: Songcamp Elektra\n**Dates:** June 28 - August 19 2021\n\n**Goals:**\n* Create the first chapter in the Elektra story\n* Create audio-visual artwork that tells that story\n* Create an interactive web3 experience that delivers that story\n* Create 3 songs + 1 audio-visual piece (i.e. the supernova) that saves Elektra\n* Create 3 audio-visual pieces that act as centrepieces to the Elektra world and story, and vault them in the Elektra treasury\n\n### PHASE 2: Elektra DAO\n**Dates:** Begin to establish during camp, with the first official ElektraDAO call on September 1 2021 \n* Establish decentralized influence over the future of Elektra via the $ELEKTRA token\n    * Develop Elektra’s tokenomics design and distribution to incentivize high-quality participation in the project through collective ownership and governance\n    * Create a committee of camp participants + backers to continue developing the Elektra project\n    * Initial proposed tokenonmics distribution → August 9 2021\n* Develop and execute on proposals that move the Elektra story, art and project forward\n    * **EXPAND** — increase the reach and distribution of the story and art we’ve already created. Ideas: \n        * An ELEKTRA album release — audio story + songs\n        * A re-release of the Elektra interactive game that is gated by $ELEKTRA and/or Portal Tickets\n        * Alternative web3 routes to distribution + monetization of the story and artwork\n    * **ADVANCE** — continue to develop future chapters of the Elektra story and world. Ideas:\n        * Write Chapter 2 and onward of the Elektra story\n        * Create more audio-visual pieces that tell that story\n        * Create more levels to the Elektra interactive game\n        * Create more songs for future chapters\n        * Create a feature film :)", "timestamp": 1628694820, "digest": "LKv_0fUHtVg4imYjEQXZA_OGgK7DwllmKPieaIqYdVc", "contributor": "0xfC4852B5e3aF65058CdfE1D1dce26946c0C1975f"}

We are currently in the middle of Phase 1. More info related to the project roadmap will soon be available of elektra.camp\n\n### Phase 1: Songcamp Elektra\n**Dates:** June 28 - August 19 2021\n\n**Goals:**\n* Create the first chapter in the Elektra story\n* Create audio-visual artwork that tells that story\n* Create an interactive web3 experience that delivers that story\n* Create 3 songs + 1 audio-visual piece (i.e. the supernova) that saves Elektra\n* Create 3 audio-visual pieces that act as centrepieces to the Elektra world and story, and vault them in the Elektra treasury\n\n### PHASE 2: Elektra DAO\n**Dates:** Begin to establish during camp, with the first official ElektraDAO call on September 1 2021 \n* Establish decentralized influence over the future of Elektra via the $ELEKTRA token\n    * Develop Elektra’s tokenomics design and distribution to incentivize high-quality participation in the project through collective ownership and governance\n    * Create a committee of camp participants + backers to continue developing the Elektra project\n    * Initial proposed tokenonmics distribution → August 9 2021\n* Develop and execute on proposals that move the Elektra story, art and project forward\n    * **EXPAND** — increase the reach and distribution of the story and art we’ve already created. Ideas: \n        * An ELEKTRA album release — audio story + songs\n        * A re-release of the Elektra interactive game that is gated by $ELEKTRA and/or Portal Tickets\n        * Alternative web3 routes to distribution + monetization of the story and artwork\n    * **ADVANCE** — continue to develop future chapters of the Elektra story and world. Ideas:\n        * Write Chapter 2 and onward of the Elektra story\n        * Create more audio-visual pieces that tell that story\n        * Create more levels to the Elektra interactive game\n        * Create more songs for future chapters\n        * Create a feature film :)", "timestamp": 1628705631, "digest": "LKv_0fUHtVg4imYjEQXZA_OGgK7DwllmKPieaIqYdVc", "contributor": "0xfC4852B5e3aF65058CdfE1D1dce26946c0C1975f"}

{"id": "v8R0rJxYS7ejkrPcbRzSn_r3aqdaeMwaFP-q6BKEm5c", "title": "Why I became the first citizen of CityDAO", "body": "Last week the nascent CityDAO [publicly announced its launch](https://city.mirror.xyz/mZOpFWkTi0M2lVE1PsT1e2sJwdUT4PdgetHw_S4hS5A). Part of this was auctioning off the “First Citizenship” as an NFT, and I won! Friends started asking me what it was and why I would spend 6.52 ETH on it. The short answer is because I want to support the project. Here’s why.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/81b72ef0-d4d3-4a12-bcce-1ed4b869f0cb.jpg?height=708&width=1440)\n\n## Garden Breakouts\n\nSupport for decentralization is growing. But we are still mainly in a walled garden. Inside the garden is a community fostering paradigm-shifting technologies, like open-source blockchains, decentralized autonomous organizations, and free access to economic opportunities. Outside, the world carries on. Growing pressure is forming cracks in the walls. My thesis is to try and look for them. \n\nIn a revolution, it isn’t the idea or technology itself that affects change. It is the people that recognize the opportunity and breathe purpose into the tools. So here we have an opportunity (the crack) and the tools. CityDAO is the leader adding purpose. Democratizing large scale land ownership, using the tools of tokenization and decentralized governance. **Together this is a breakout.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/499fb24d-8803-4ea0-81df-e15351e54ddc.jpg?height=708&width=1440)\n\n## Timing\nTiming is also critical. Wyoming became the first place in the world to recognize DAOs as legal entities. A crack has appeared!\n\nBill Gross [famously identifies](https://youtu.be/bNpx7gpSqbY) timing as the biggest reason startups succeed. We have been experimenting with various top-down approaches to managing space in the physical world since the birth of humanity. Everything from feudalism to modern cities. Recent tech-centered experiments have included islands, crypto cities, even barges. I was part of DTP Las Vegas in the early days as it attempted to build a city in a city (RIP Tony ❤️).\n\nGrassroots approaches also exist. Too many to name. I had the privilege of living in rural Hawaii for six years integrating with the community. It is like a federation of experiments in land use. Within a couple thousand square miles, there were Kin Domains, Hawaiian Hui’s, intentional communities (various types), traditional subdivisions, and everything in between.\n\nWith every iteration of land management, we do our best with the tools at our disposal. This is true of approaches both from the top and bottom. Most changes have been incremental and small. The most progressive attempts may have been too early and ran into walls. Decentralized approaches were not supported in the law. For centralized approaches, walls have been things like lack of community input and the inability to govern.\n\n**I believe CityDAO is the answer to these blockers.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b719ff2b-891e-4df3-8410-cf7ca03a555d.jpg?height=708&width=1440)\n\n## Community\n\nLast but not least is [the community](https://discord.com/invite/QAtRtdMZXb).\n\nThe new world of decentralized organizations puts communities first. Now more than ever, success won’t be determined by technocratic founders. It is the age of grassroots. Success relies on the community’s culture. Who it attracts, what the ethos becomes. Even with a great purpose, timing, and opportunity (crack), DAOs won’t succeed without a healthy community. This is the killer product.\n\nCityDAO was built on this formula for success. **It is attracting and fostering an outstanding, mission-driven community.** As a bonus, it is attracting talent from outside of crypto, another clear sign of leaving the garden. This alone makes me bullish.\n\n----\n\n*To find out what it’s like being First Citizen of CityDAO, keep tabs on me on Twitter [@JustinKalland](https://twitter.com/JustinKalland)*", "timestamp": 1628712622, "digest": "7rtqWC6DBNHbIt87xCPUqkmFcw_3u_ZAK6vahn2IhOI", "contributor": "0xF49A19f72d0E106df462CfD6B5BEBE42b6001616"}

It provides a context within which we can, more or less safely, try different ways of being, different approaches to life, and our friends, to whom we open ourselves and by whom we are willing to be influenced and directed, play a central role in what becomes of us.”* — Alexander Nehamas\n\nFriendship has never been easy to understand or define — even [Michel de Montaigne](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/montaigne/), in his essay “[Of Friendship](http://naomigryn.com/Ebooks/Of-Friendship-Montaigne.pdf),” found it impossible to account for all the reasons why he loved his closest friend. But these questions and parameters have only become more muddled since we began interacting with friends (and strangers, too) in digital spaces. How do we define a friendship in a virtual world? What is the value of a Facebook friend, or a follow on Twitter? And what happens when the line between IRL and URL becomes too blurred to distinguish?\n\nThe Internet is [really big](https://www.worldwidewebsize.com/), and it can also be [really lonely](https://www.cnet.com/features/how-tech-and-social-media-are-making-us-feel-lonelier-than-ever/). “Part of the problem of social media is that there is no equivalent to the scientific glassblowers’ sign, or the woodworker’s open door, or Dafna and Jesse’s sandwich boards,” writes [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/). **“On the internet, if you stop speaking, you disappear.”** To me, maintaining some sense of activity and intimacy in online spaces is a bit like [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu), like a call into the crowd: *I am here*. As I’ve heard [Blake Robbins](https://twitter.com/blakeir) put it before, Twitter is the global town square. It’s where [friendships are formed](https://twitter.com/pitdesi/status/1333518018798780416?s=20) and where [careers are made](https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1237057565898375169?s=20). And, for better or for worse, it’s an always-on megaphone to share what’s on your mind.\n\nTo differentiate between our friends, our modern friends, our acquaintances, our colleagues, and everything in between, we can look to [Dunbar’s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number), which states that we can maintain some level of *knowing* a person across 150 people. This number is limited in part due to our memory, as well as the effort it takes to maintain the relationships themselves.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BD8lSktmx8HugyyP5z9ZnQ.png)\n\n*Dunbar’s number, as illustrated by [Sketchplanations](https://sketchplanations.com/dunbars-number-150)*\n\n* * *\n\nDunbar also identified that a person’s social network appears to follow traditional scaling laws, with the number of people in each level usually increasing by a factor of three. So a person might have 5 close friends, 15 in their extended or “super” family, 50 in their clan, and 150 in their tribe. Where those people come from? That’s up to you.\n\n> *“We are lent into each other’s keeping.”* — [Tomasz Tunguz](https://tomtunguz.com/lent-into-each-others-keeping/)\n\nI never thought my tribe would consist of so many modern friends. It’s the upside, I guess, of being a digital native, of spending this time on the Internet. These social networks are so wonderful because they allow for small, repeated interactions with so many people (related: [Familiarity and Belonging](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/familiarity-and-belonging), by [Simon Sarris](https://twitter.com/simonsarris)).\n\nI largely put this post together as an ode to the modern friends I’ve made this year. So as 2020 comes to a close, I want to say thank you, for now I am no longer afraid of talking to strangers. :)\n\n> *“What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.”* — Aristotle\n\n* * * \n\nLooking to offer more passive support?
