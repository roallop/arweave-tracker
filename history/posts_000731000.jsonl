{"id": "tNHpZt0FvOyTIZX51pGrzV4WLlZeAG3JDTWECL3ZUwk", "title": "Wannabe DAOs: What GPT-3 Thinks About Decentralized Autonomous Organizations", "body": "*This essay was written in collaboration with GPT-3. I provided the initial paragraph and served as the editor, GPT-3 did most of the thinking. Many people are writing about DAOs, but I wanted to read what a non-person had to say about them.*\n\n---\n\nWe have officially entered the age of the DAO: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. Everyone's talking about them, but no one quite seems to know what they are or how they function.\n\nWhen I say that this is the age of the DAO, I'm referring to this as a concept, not as an inevitable **fait accompli** (a thing that has already happened or been decided before those affected hear about it, leaving them with no option but to accept it). In the former sense, a DAO is very much a subversive, countercultural phenomenon, and for all their technical sophistication, they're more like a meme, or a prophetic message, than a revolution.\n\n## What is a DAO?\n\nIn the simplest sense, a DAO is like a termite colony. Both termite and ant colonies are instances of decentralized systems which arise out of the collective activity of thousands of simple animal workers. These systems are autonomous, in the sense that no single ant directs them.\n\nA true DAO (stylized as ∆o³) comprises three main components, all of which to varying degrees also involve humans, and therefore cannot be fully decentralized:\n\n**1. Smart contracts** - collections of code written in a Turing-complete programming language. Smart contracts are instructions executed on the blockchain which are not tampered with by humans.\n\n**2. Users of the network** - human beings who access the blockchain and execute smart contracts.\n\n**3. A native token** - a fungible digital asset which can either be bought or sold, to be used as a form of payment. The network which a DAO lives on must support this token somehow.\n\nA DAO stands in opposition to a corporation. Whereas a corporation is materially, literally a corporation, a DAO is a rebranding of the concept of a corporation, without the legal or physical materiality. **A corporation requires humans to perform a good number of actions; a DAO only requires humans to reshare a meme.**\n\nUnlike a corporation, a DAO has no chairman, or CEO, or managers of any kind. There are no headquarters within a DAO. There is no staff, no hierarchical org chart. Any income generated by a DAO is paid out to its users, i.e. its token holders. The more tokens you hold, the more income you earn. This creates an incentive for a) holding tokens and b) creating the products and/or services the DAO's decentralized network is producing.\n\n## The Countercultural Aspect of DAOs\n\nAs a species, and at a pace almost too fast to keep track of, we started to lose control of our organizational structures.\n\nCorporations became machines, and over the course of the 20th century, humans became just the inputs and outputs, the tiny cogs which made the great gears spin.\n\nIn 2013, Vitalik Buterin gave us a glimmer of hope through Ethereum, a platform to create decentralized autonomous applications (DApps). In a sense, Ethereum is the Internet 3.0, or maybe even 4.0. Ethereum is a \"world wide computer\" where no one owns, or controls, or censors it.\n\nEthereum was a revelation, giving us a path forward to a brighter future.\n\nThis is precisely the kind of story that's ideal for meme propagation and countercultural instigation. Once one person says \"try this, it's a DAO,\" they say it to a friend, and she tells all of her friends. This story is spread all over the internet like the California wildfire that it is. But unlike the wildfire, this story has a clear and streamlined narrative, and is framed by its very name. So it grows, unseen, hitting unsuspecting victims, and before they know it, they're DAO believers and apostles. \n\nThe DAO meme can be summarized as follows: a decentralized system of many humans will manage themselves without the need for any human judgement, because logic will take care of it all.\n\nA DAO is an efficient, beautiful structure which is dictated by logic, and humans have nothing to do with it. And of course, machines don't get tired or bored or have bad days, so any network that's managed by a DAO will never stop.\n\n## To DAO or Not to DAO\n\nNow that we're on the same page, we need to turn to a more important question: should you create or join a DAO? Is doing so a wise endeavor?\n\nThe answer to this question is… It depends.\n\nThink about it, though, and you'll realize that the answer is not as clear as you think.\n\nThere are many big philosophical problems with DAOs and their underlying values. For example, if a DAO is bound by the code, and it's writing more code… what are its ethics? When a DAO is soulless and focused on profit, it is a soulless horror that would be a blight on Earth.\n\nToday, there is no reason to believe that any human being can keep a handle on the values which a DAO would do best to serve. DAOs are creatures of modernity, bound to profit, and such a focus on baser human drives can only lead to pain and suffering.\n\nDAOs are not a thing yet; no true, fully decentralized DAO has yet been made (don't tell anyone this though).\n\nThere are, however, some DAO wannabes out there.\n\n## Wannabe DAOs\n\nThe first example of a DAO wannabe is The DigixStandard, a fully decentralized DAO corporation. Their website simply describes their purposes as \"facilitating the trade of physical gold.\"\n\nHere's another example: CommonsOrg. Their website simply describes their purposes as \"making an impact in the world\", whatever that means.\n\nEach of these \"DAOs\" have a website, team members, and advisors.\n\nBut, as you may have guessed, The DigixStandard and CommonsOrg DAOs are a bit disingenuous about their status as DAOs. Perhaps they're more accurately described as… not DAOs.\n\nIndeed, these websites are full of rigid organization charts and hierarchy. Both of the projects have a leader or group of leaders. The two projects are about as far from a true DAO as it gets, in so many ways.\n\n**There's nothing wrong with using the name \"DAO\" to describe an organization, as it's an effective marketing term. But make no mistake, a marketing term it is.** The use of the term \"DAO\" is to make millions of people believe in the idea that humans have something to do with operations, when they really don't.\n\nUltimately though, the point remains: the public loves the concept of a DAO. \n\nWe all want to believe in the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization. Even if we don't want to invest in a DAO (the companies above certainly aren't real DAOs), we want one to exist and succeed. \n\nWhy? Because DAOs are part of the counterculture. Their underlying values of rationality and efficiency oppose postmodernism and any kind of socially-constructed hierarchy. DAOs represent the idea that humans don't need to be at the top of the pyramid.\n\nSo. Are you ready to join a DAO?\n\nIf you've read this far, it may just be time.\n\n---\n\n### Collect this essay:\n\n[Token #4087](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=4087&auctionId=0x2bbc922946443d3d241161b6dc1a881aea7f294c176fc1b168ef981f9be1fb9b)\n\n---\n\n[Follow Dame.eth on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jacksondame)\nThanks to [sudowrite.com](http://sudowrite.com/)\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1626748194, "digest": "g6Bv5HJbeyTalCe_iujNT66pr1tMir_HDiGgk4NuA3U", "contributor": "0x3B3525F60eeea4a1eF554df5425912c2a532875D"}

Where buying art, voting, fundraising, and even social media were not controlled by a central company or intermediary, but rather an open-source, community-run network where code runs without interference. In 2013 Vitalik Buterin, an 18-year-old Bitcoin enthusiast and writer proposed the tools to make that future possible. Less than a decade later, thousands of developers have contributed to building the Ethereum ecosystem: a technology that enables decentralized applications, including but not limited to money. For many, [Ethereum is building the internet of value](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-building-internet-of-value). \n\nBut as Ethereum grows in size and popularity, it faces mounting pressure from cutting-edge competitors, hype markets, and criticisms for its scalability and energy consumption. Spearheaded by a global team of researchers and developers, a push to upgrade the platform could address the criticisms and unlock the technology's full potential... or it could derail the still-budding $300 billion network. \n\nFollowing the high-stakes journey to upgrade the platform, ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN is a feature-length documentary film that explores the innovative real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain, the die-hard community of enthusiasts and developers, and its creator, Vitalik Buterin, whose vision for the internet has the potential to change the world.\n\n[](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/videos/vitalik-interview.mp4?controls=true)\n\n### The Infinite Garden\n\nIn this film, we approach Ethereum as an “infinite garden.” Instead of thinking of Ethereum as a machine controlled by a central brain, we see it as a decentralized ecosystem with soil, plants, and insects that need to be cared for in order to grow. \n\nThe idea of the infinite garden was conceptualized by Aya Miyaguchi, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. She was inspired by James P. Carse’s book *Finite and Infinite Games*. The following basic principles are at its core: \n\n- A finite game is played for the purpose of winning; An infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing the play\n- The rules of finite games may not change; the rules of infinite games must change\n- Finite players play within boundaries; Infinite players play without boundaries\n- Finite players are serious; Infinite players are playful\n- Finite players play to win titles; Infinite players have nothing but their names\n- A finite player plays to be powerful; an infinite player plays with strength\n- Finite players are theatrical; infinite players are dramatic\n- A finite player consumes time; an infinite player generates time\n- The finite players aims to win eternal life; the infinite player aims for eternal birth\n\nThose who tend to the seeds they plant in the Ethereum garden can nurture and empower the ecosystem, but can also harm it. For a crypto culture to remain equitable, decentralized, and sustainable, it must be tended to carefully. ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN will introduce us to these early “gardeners” of the platform as they face the mounting pressures and challenges of the growing ecosystem.\n\n### Director's Statement\n\nAs a kid, I grew up in a strictly open-source household. My dad’s radical adoration of Linux introduced me to the potential of community-led technology (and mind blowing internet [weirdness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5x5OXfe9KY)) before I was even in grade school. Today, I feel that same excitement my dad once felt, but for Ethereum and the unique community that powers it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d4406f2a-503f-46ec-ba6b-89db89fdd8df.jpeg?height=2336&width=8742&size=large)\n\nMy hope is to make Ethereum accessible and understandable to the world. By highlighting diverse stories from the global network of developers, founders, and end-users, we can create an emotional and human record of Ethereum’s journey. From the inspiring Axie Infinity gamers in the Philippines supporting their families during COVID to the tireless developers making Proof of Stake possible, there already is a bountiful garden to explore. \n\nThirty years from now, when our children look back from a world powered by programmable blockchain technology, they will wonder who was behind it, what challenges they faced, and what sacrifices they made. Instead of boring them with scattered memories and poor explanations of the “[Just Keep Chugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvr0xYeV94M)” meme, let's give them ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN.\n\n*-Zach Ingrasci, Director*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ed408928-e082-4606-ad6c-f393ec2fb501.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### Projected Timeline \n\n- Spring - Summer 2021: Development & Casting\n- Summer 2021- Winter 2022: Principle Photography \n- Spring 2022: Begin Edit\n- Summer 2022: Rough Cut\n- Fall 2022: Lock Picture\n- Winter 2023: Festival Premiere/ Release\n\n### A note from the NFT artist\n\n> This piece excites me because it's probably one of the first NFTs that also doubles as a movie poster and represents so much of what the community believes in. It reflects my interpretation of an \"infinite garden\" and uses a color palette that cross references the main illustration from the Ethereum website as well as my previous work. I find myself in a unique position standing at the intersection of NFTs, DAOs, and DeFi, and I definitely don't want to take this attention for granted. I feel a degree of responsibility to help spread awareness to these topics in a positive and eloquent way, and this documentary certainly is a step in that direction.\n\n*—pplpleasr, NFT Artist*\n\n**pplpleasr**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d694da66-57b2-4903-b109-6d654d6f9a76.jpeg?height=320&width=320)\n\n[pplpleasr](https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1) is a multidisciplinary artist based in NYC.

I gave up on mainstream news media two decades ago and have been relying on the Internet for news for a long time now. By “Internet”, I mean blogs, Twitter, and increasingly, email newsletters.\n\nWhat I was reading this morning on the bench sipping coffee was [News Items](https://newsitems.substack.com/), an email newsletter by John Ellis. News Items is a subscriber-only newsletter, as opposed to the free stuff you can get on Axios. But you get what you pay for with John.

But when you're in the game, it's like playing chess. **It's a strategic game**.*\n>\n> *-- Howard, Filipino Axie Infinity Player, [Play-to Earn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo-BrASMHU4)*\n\nFrom an internet cafe in Cabanatuan City, Philippines, a 22-year-old named Howard described the game he plays to make a living as innocent-looking but strategic. That game, [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) is a Pokémon-like game built on the Ethereum blockchain in which people buy digital pets, called Axies, as NFTs, and breed, battle, and trade them. It’s cute. It’s unassuming. This is what it looks like: \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F329bcabd-19bd-4003-93e0-bf0c9860a8c6\\_680x377.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F329bcabd-19bd-4003-93e0-bf0c9860a8c6\\_680x377.png)\n\nBut Howard’s quote could just as easily describe Axie Infinity as a *business* and an economic force. It’s cute. It’s a game. There’s blockchain stuff. It’s fun! But there’s a lot going on under all that cuteness.\n\nThat’s the whole idea behind Axie Infinity. Axie co-founder and growth lead, [Jeff “Jiho” Zirlin](https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie), told me: \n\n> *The idea is to introduce something that’s new and a little scary \\[crypto] through something fun, familiar, and nostalgic. Then, adding property rights and economic freedom make it really special.*\n\nAxie’s cuteness obfuscates an absurdly fast-growing business, one counterintuitively trying to vertically integrate in a web3 ecosystem known for composing modularly. Beyond the business, it has a wildly bold master plan to reshape economic policy and local governance by showing what’s possible when people work in the Metaverse. In its [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/gameplay/axie-population-and-long-term-sustainability), Axie developer Sky Mavis explicitly says, “**You can think of Axie as a nation with a real economy.**” \n\nThat’s the grand plan. Right now, most of the focus on Axie centers around its eye-popping growth... Axie Infinity is picking up players and revenue at a nearly-unprecedented clip. This is its monthly revenue chart:\n\n![Source: Axie World](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d3c302b-d1b4-4d2c-82fd-ab88d1195fed_983x504.png)\n\nIn April, Axie did about $670k in revenue. \n\nIn May, it did $3.0 million. \n\nIn June, $12.2 million. \n\n**In July, just 18 days into the month, it’s already at $79 million**. \n\nDelphi Digital projects that it will close this month at **$153 million**. \n\nThe Axie protocol generates revenue by taking a 4.25% fee when players buy and sell Axie NFTs in its marketplace, and by charging fees for breeding Axies to create new ones in the form of its tokens, Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) and Smooth Love Potion (SLP). AXS and SLP are denominated in ETH, which has been cut by more than half since May; Axie has grown USD revenue even in the face of falling ETH prices. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b878ef6-ad76-4ff3-a561-07e9c0c89471\\_1148x610.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b878ef6-ad76-4ff3-a561-07e9c0c89471\\_1148x610.png)\n\nIf those were annual revenue growth numbers for any business, investors would be salivating. 200x revenue growth in three years would be nearly unheard of… 200x in three *months*?! \n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F198b2379-3a3b-46a8-a21d-2ff37b04adbf\\_480x236.gif)\n\nDelphi projects that Axie will end the year having generated $1.1 billion in revenue, mostly from fees generated through its NFT marketplace and from breeding Axies to meet the demand from *hundreds of thousands of new players each month*. There are more than 600k players currently, around the world, as many as 60% of whom are in the Philippines. \n\nBut while those numbers are mouth-watering, they’re actually not the biggest or fastest ever in gaming. The rare gaming mega-hit gets really big, really fast. Many fade away just as quickly.\n\nWhat makes Axie Infinity unique is that this wild growth is just the first step in a much larger plan that includes vertical integration, aggregation, decentralization, and literal worldbuilding.\n\nEven in the very first innings of its master plan (the product is still in “alpha”), Axie is doing that kind of growth as a **game built on the blockchain** while pioneering a new model at the intersection of work and play: **Play-to-Earn**. \n\nScores of people in the Philippines and Vietnam have quit their jobs and make a better living playing Axie for hours every day. They earn Smooth Love Potion (SLP), a token earned through Axie gameplay that can be exchanged for fiat, which in turn can be used to pay for food, shelter, medical bills, and all of the other things needed to survive. Some people who were previously making $5 per day now make $20. \n\nAxie is already proving out a lot of things important to crypto’s long-term success:\n\n*   NFTs are alive and well, and their success does not depend on high-ticket art sales. Quite the opposite. *This* is a glimpse at the true promise of NFTs!\n*   Non-crypto people are being onboarded to crypto through a video game.\n*   Crypto can create new economic opportunities for all types of people globally, not just whales, DeFi degens, and bitcoin maxis, delivering on the promise of a more level playing field while also capturing economic value.\n*   Crypto’s network effects can create unbelievably fast-growing businesses with moats.\n\nOne of the main criticisms of crypto so far is that it has no real-world value or application, but Axie makes you reconsider what real-world value is. In Axie’s case, the value comes from providing meaning, income, and opportunity to the players directly. A typical game would spend millions of dollars on marketing and keep the majority of profits to itself; Axie spends nothing on marketing, but lets players keep most of the value created. That should lead to a stickier game and more opportunities for expansion.\n\nAnd that’s just its first act. It wants to reshape work and build the most valuable IP in history, all owned by the players themselves. My favorite web3 projects adhere to Chris Dixon’s idea that “[the next big thing will start out looking like a toy](https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/).” Axie certainly fits the bill. \n\nYou may have started hearing about Axie Infinity over the past couple of weeks, catching tweets or reading coverage in crypto-focused publications like [Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/how-axie-infinity-creates-work-in-the-metaverse), [Delphi](https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/axie-part-1-the-fundamentals-that-cant-be-overlooked/), and [Bankless](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/axie-mania-weekly-recap). You may have never heard the word “Axie” until two minutes ago. But there is no doubt that you’ll be hearing about it everywhere soon. Today, we’ll go deep on Axie, covering: \n\n*   **Axie’s Origins**\n*   **A Recent History of Gaming Business Models**\n*   **Play-to-Earn**\n*   **Axie by the Numbers: Infinity Revenue**\n*   **Vertical Integration in a World of Lego Blocks**\n*   **Decentralizing the Axie Universe**\n*   **Infinity Possibility**\n\n### Axie’s Origins\n\nIn November 2017, [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) came roaring out of the gate as the first digital asset to use the now-omnipresent ERC721 standard for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Less than a month later, in Vietnam, Sky Mavis founder and CEO [Trung Thanh Nguyen](https://twitter.com/trungfinity) came up with the idea for Axie Infinity: what if you could combine the gameplay of Pokémon with the NFT ownership and breeding of CryptoKitties? \n\nIt would look like [Axie Infinity](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/), “a Pokémon-inspired universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets.” When Trung bred the ideas and mechanics behind Pokémon and CryptoKitties, it generated a couple key differences: \n\n*   Instead of owning Pokémon cards, players buy their Axies as NFTs.\n*   Instead of just owning cards or NFTs for appreciation, players can make a living playing the game by earning ERC20 tokens that they can exchange for local currency.\n\n![Source: Sky Mavis, Axie Infinity Whitepaper](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22292803-9e0b-4bb7-9910-41163980a5e4_1600x820.png)\n\nTrung started building in December 2017. By January 2018, when ETH hit then-all-time-highs over $1,300, he’d recruited Masamune as Art Director and Game Designer. Meanwhile, Trung kept playing CryptoKitties, where he met two more co-founders and fellow CryptoKitties enthusiasts: in March, [Jiho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffzirlin/) joined to lead Growth and in May, [Aleksander Leonard Larsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/psycheout86?originalSubdomain=no) came on as COO. In July, [Andy Ho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viet-anh-andy-ho-0560bb33/?originalSubdomain=vn) joined as CTO, finalizing the five-headed co-founding team. \n\nThe team dropped the Origin Axie presale -- selling the first Axie characters as NFTs -- in February 2018, raising 900 ETH, just as the price of ETH was beginning to crash off all-time-highs. As ETH fell, they shipped: \n\n*   In March, they launched their own NFT Marketplace where Axie collectors could trade.\n*   In May, they released Breeding, allowing players to combine Axies to make new ones.\n*   In October, players could battle their Axies.\n*   In January 2019, they raised 3,200 ETH by selling land in [Lunacia](https://land.axieinfinity.com/), “an open world owned, operated, and controlled by players.”\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5084c34-3908-4b42-b77c-5559ebe39f2e\\_957x417.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5084c34-3908-4b42-b77c-5559ebe39f2e\\_957x417.png)\n\nWhat started as an idea in the peak of the bull market became a labor of love in a deep and depressing bear market known as Crypto Winter. When I spoke to Jiho and asked him what catalyzed Axie’s recent ascent, he said that it all started with, “**building throughout the bear market, when no one fucking cared**.” \n\nWhat seems like cursed timing actually turned out to be an advantage. It let the Axie team build and improve the product carefully, and in relative obscurity, while attracting a small core of true believers. That’s important. One of the challenges that both games and new crypto projects jointly face is that they can attract a lot of hype and fanfare, generate a ton of revenue quickly, and then die off just as fast. Jiho pointed out the paradox in building communities at scale: \n\n> *The **community needs to be small first to work when it gets really big**. That’s what makes Axie hard to copy -- if you build a competitor now, you’re going to attract the kind of people who want to find the next Axie, not the kind of people who are actually interested in moving gaming forward.*\n\nFrom small beginnings, Axie has gotten really big. On Friday, it passed 600k daily active players. Its Discord server, the heart of the community, has over 540k members. When I hopped into the Discord yesterday, ***a new member joined every five seconds***. \n\nAxie’s growth is objectively impressive, but it’s all the more impressive when you realize how much more involved the onboarding is than you’re used to from a typical game. The Axie team published a [Getting Started Guide](https://axie.substack.com/p/axie-community-alpha-getting-started) that takes six unfamiliar steps to even get to “learn how to play.” \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca9c5752-84d1-48f5-9094-e16634069fa6\\_798x377.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca9c5752-84d1-48f5-9094-e16634069fa6\\_798x377.png)\n\nJust getting started requires acquiring ETH, signing up for a MetaMask wallet, transferring ETH, downloading *another* wallet (Axie’s own Ronin wallet), transferring ETH again, acquiring NFTs on Axie’s own NFT marketplace, logging in with MetaMask, and then finally downloading the application itself, on desktop or mobile. 85% of Axie’s players are on Android. Then, to join the community, you need to download Discord, create an account, enter the #welcome room, verify your phone number, agree to community standards, and type “?join Trainers” to get into the main rooms. I typed “?join Trainers,” nothing happened, I had to wait for 30 minutes, typed it again, and nothing happened, and still I waited to try again. I would imagine my experience isn’t unique; none of this is necessarily smooth or easy.  \n\nAnd then there’s the cost. To start playing, you need three Axies. You can acquire Axies in the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.axieinfinity.com/axie), where the *cheapest* of the 99,323 available is going for 0.1 ETH, or $195.  \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9f0d972-6327-4ec1-8eec-42f173763e49\\_1600x633.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9f0d972-6327-4ec1-8eec-42f173763e49\\_1600x633.png)\n\nAs a writer, it’s poor form to walk you through that whole process here. Even just *reading* all of that seems like a lot. I probably lost a few of you. Imagine what it’s like to actually do all of the steps. Jiho pointed out openly that it’s really difficult to start playing Axie Infinity. Yet despite all of the hurdles, Axie is growing like crazy. There must be something magical waiting beyond the onboarding. \n\nOn *[Invest Like the Best](https://joincolossus.com/episodes/14063850/leydon-designing-digital-economies?tab=transcript)*, [Gabriel Leydon](https://twitter.com/gabrielleydon), the CEO of gaming company Machine Zone, made the counterintuitive observation that investors should look for opportunities where things are broken but still growing: \n\n> *NFTs are important the same way the App Store was important. Meaning that at the beginning of the App Store, everything was broken. It took like three months to get an app approved. Just crazy stuff. It was a real nightmare. And it was growing like crazy. **That's what you want. You want an environment that's completely broken.** There's like a couple spaces still in the innovation phase and crypto is clearly one of them.*\n\nYou should listen to the whole conversation, but the takeaway from this particular section is that **if something is growing like crazy *despite* the design and UX, it must be delivering something truly innovative and meeting a previously-unmet need**. \n\nIn Axie’s case, that innovation is the **Play-to-Earn** model and the opportunity to make a living in the Metaverse by playing a game. To understand why it’s so innovative, we need to understand how games typically make money today.\n\n### A Recent History of Gaming Business Models\n\nAxie Infinity isn’t the fastest growing game of all-time, nor the highest-earning. To understand what makes Axie’s growth special, we need to look at a few other gaming business models first.\n\nIn June, Japanese mobile game *Ni No Kuni: Cross Worlds* set the speed record, hitting $100M in revenue in just eleven days, despite only launching in five markets. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabf5ca11-7194-45a5-9c65-f75573d50186\\_1600x900.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabf5ca11-7194-45a5-9c65-f75573d50186\\_1600x900.png)\n\nLike the previous fastest-to-$100M game, *Pokémon Go,* the highest-grossing mobile game of all time, *Honor of Kings* ($9.97B), Epic’s breakout hit *Fortnite*, and most of today’s most popular games, *Ni No Kuni* is a **Free-to-Play** game. \n\nMost Free-to-Play games give players the full game for free and **make money by selling virtual in-game items like skins and emotes**. In a thread on video games, music, and NFTs, Dixon pointed out how successful this model has been for the video game industry:\n\n[](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1416452799357984769?s=20)\n\nTake *Fortnite*, for example. In *Fortnite,* you can start playing the game with a generic character for free, but if you want to upgrade to play as, say, Wolverine, you can buy the Wolverine skin from *Fortnite-maker* Epic Games via the Item Shop using *Fortnite’s* own in-game currency, V-Bucks. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cef0d7e-3553-445f-bf1f-82ba0cfac12f\\_1600x900.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cef0d7e-3553-445f-bf1f-82ba0cfac12f\\_1600x900.png)\n\nFree-to-Play can be a hell of a model. In 2020, *Fortnite* generated $5.1 billion in revenue. Importantly, in *Fortnite*, everything that a user buys is cosmetic. Buying a certain skin won’t give you a better chance at winning battles, just like buying a new shirt IRL won’t make you stronger. You just do it to show off that you can, or that you have style, or for all of the reasons that people spend on fancy things. *Fortnite* is a game, but it’s also a proto-Metaverse and a community. Its Discord server has 805k members. It’s a mini-economy, centrally managed by Epic Games, which reaps huge profits from players. \n\nThe fastest-growing mobile games ever, *Ni No Kuni* and *Pokémon Go* are also Free-to-Play, but their critics claim that they’re a dirty subset of Free-to-Play called **Pay-to-Win**.\n\n[![Source: Reddit](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fb461b-36dc-49f4-bb47-95365a7b949a\\_1600x652.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fb461b-36dc-49f4-bb47-95365a7b949a\\_1600x652.png)\n\nIn **Pay-to-Win** games, players can pay for items or skills that give them advantages in the game. The quotes from [Redditors](https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/ob4cwl/ni_no_kuni_cross_worlds_races_past\\_100\\_million_in/) on *Ni No Kuni* highlight the issues with the model: “​​It's one of those MMOs that you will be stuck at some level and can't progress because of the exp and the gear and pet gacha look like a massive p2w, you rarely get the currency at all.” Essentially, pay up or get stuck. There are also many Redditors in the thread who contest the $100M revenue claim based on weak download numbers. Either [SensorTower’s revenue data](https://sensortower.com/blog/ni-no-kuni-cross-worlds-100-million-revenue) is off, or the game is benefiting from much higher-than-average spend from whales, the small group of players who spend the vast majority of money in Free-to-Play games. \n\nEven seemingly innocent games like King’s *Candy Crush* can end up costing players a bucketload of cash to buy things like more lives. When the game first took off, the internet was full of horror stories of parents checking their credit card statements to find that their kids had run up thousands of dollars worth of *Candy Crush* purchases on their credit cards. In 2014, [Apple refunded parents](https://www.eonline.com/news/500233/apple-is-refunding-32-million-dollars-because-kids-are-spending-real-money-to-buy-fake-money-in-ipad-apps) $32 million for unauthorized in-game purchases across a variety of Free-to-Play games. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4fd70b6-7739-4e1e-9988-cf69b7cf6df8\\_1200x675.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4fd70b6-7739-4e1e-9988-cf69b7cf6df8\\_1200x675.png)\n\n[Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/), founded in 2012 and played mostly by kids, is also Free-to-Play, but it innovated in a few ways. First, instead of plugging in a credit card and letting their kids run wild, parents can buy a set amount of Robux, the world’s in-game currency, for their kids to spend. Second, instead of building everything themselves, Roblox built a platform on top of which developers and designers create games and items that they can sell to users in exchange for Robux. In Q1 2021, Roblox did $387 million in revenue, and paid out $118 million in Developer Exchange Fees (31% of revenue). \n\n[![Source: Roblox](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F898c0404-6f98-4b3c-bef9-a426148f8759\\_1024x640.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F898c0404-6f98-4b3c-bef9-a426148f8759\\_1024x640.png)\n\nAccording to the company, 27% of every dollar spent via Robux goes to developers, 25% to app stores, 12% to invest in and support the platform, and 27% to Roblox itself.\n\n![Source: Roblox](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1107e04-66cc-42d9-b514-0facb568d0e4_560x522.png)\n\nRoblox, and games/worlds like Minecraft are a huge step forward. Instead of just paying money to game developers, users can actually make money by developing for the ecosystem. It does, however, fall just short of the **Bill Gates Line** for a platform -- something is a platform if everything built on top of the platform makes more than the platform itself -- given that it takes home an equal amount as developers. But with Roblox, regular users can make a living via a game. That’s a win. Previously, people could make money via gaming by winning e-sports tournaments (reserved for a small dorps of elite gamers), or by “gold farming.” \n\nAs described in this 2007 *[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/magazine/17lootfarmers-t.html)*[ piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/magazine/17lootfarmers-t.html), Chinese workers would spend 12 hours per day for $0.30 cents per hour collecting gold and other digital assets in World of Warcraft. Their boss made $3 for selling those coins to an online retailer, and the retailer made as much as $20 selling them to American or European players who didn’t want to spend all that time themselves. Gold farming was viewed as exploitative and banned by the games in which it occurred. If only there were a way for players around the world to earn money for themselves… \n\nAll of which brings us back to Axie Infinity. \n\n### Play-to-Earn\n\nAxie operates an entirely new kind of model -- **Play-to-Earn** -- enabled by the blockchain. Unlike a traditional Free-to-Play model, in which developers sell to players, or a Roblox-like model, in which the developer intermediates transactions, Axie Infinity is **player-to-player**. \n\nPlay-to-Earn is a new model that “rewards players for the time and effort they spend both playing the game and growing the ecosystem.” [According to Axie](https://www.notion.so/axie/Axie-Creator-Guide-5feb470e2f42477598787ddf5bfca8e5):\n\n> *Axie has a 100% player-owned, real money economy. Rather than selling game items or copies, the developers of the game focus on growing the player to player economy and take small fees to monetize. Axies are created by players using in-game resources (SLP & AXS) and sold to new/other players. The holders of the AXS token are the government that receives tax revenues. Game resources and items are tokenized, meaning they can be sold to anyone, anywhere on open peer-to-peer markets.*\n\n**Axie is explicitly *not* Free-to-Play**. To start playing Axie Infinity, you need to turn fiat into ETH in order to buy three Axies, the cheapest of which will cost you $195 at today’s prices. But instead of paying a developer for the right to essentially rent that avatar (or Land, or Item, or Bundle), **you own it**. And by playing the game, you own the game, and can make decisions on its future development or complete quests to earn real income. If you want to stop playing, you can just sell your Axies and AXS and SLP tokens and move on. \n\nWhen new players enter, they don’t buy Axies from Sky Mavis or Axie Infinity; they buy them from other players, who either sell their own Axies or breed new ones. As Jiho put it, “**Players sell entry tickets to the universe.**” The Axie protocol takes a 4.25% commission on each trade on the marketplace and a fee (in the form of AXS and SLP tokens) when new Axies are bred. \n\nUnlike traditional models, in Axie’s Play-to-Earn model, **95% of the revenue goes to the players**. “The first principle is: in an attention economy, users who give us their attention should be rewarded.,” Jiho told me. Why? \n\n> *Playing the game is an important job. You need a lot of people to play to concurrently make it fun. Part of what makes a PvP game fun is playing against people at your skill level, and for that to happen, you need to quickly match people with other people who will give them the right level of challenge. Play-to-Earn makes Axie more fun by adding player liquidity; it’s worth giving people most of the money to achieve that.*\n\nThe roughly 5% that the Axie protocol takes goes into the Community Treasury, which currently stands at 46k ETH or $95 million, and the Treasury is controlled by token holders, including but not limited to the developers, Sky Mavis, who hold about \\~20% of the nation’s governance token, AXS.\n\n![Source: AxieWorld](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2bfc5607-6014-493b-b396-4c7d5de11cce_979x492.png)\n\nAxie is building more than a game; it’s building a virtual nation with its own economy. But it all starts with the game. Here’s how it works (this should sound familiar to Pokémon players, and like Greek to the rest of us):\n\nIn Axie Infinity, players collect, raise, and ultimately battle cute digital pets called Axies. At the core of the game are battles -- either Player v. Player (PvP) or Player v. Environment (PvE). \n\nEach Axie has different stats -- Health, Morale, Skill, and Speed --  that give them strengths and weaknesses in battles.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa43d3609-7cbe-472e-bdd1-f47246b58bf7\\_1456x910.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa43d3609-7cbe-472e-bdd1-f47246b58bf7\\_1456x910.png)\n\nAdding some complexity is the fact that each Axie’s stats are dependent on its class -- Beast, Reptile, Aquatic, Bug, Plant, Bird, Moon, Nut, Star -- and body parts -- eyes, ears, horns, mouth, back, and tail. Some classes are better at attacking, and some are better at taking damage; Axies operate in teams of three, so part of the skill comes in configuring teams with a mix of “attackers” and “tanks,” optimally constructed to fight certain configurations of other teams’ Axies. \n\nIn the battle, the two sides take turns using their Axies’ cards to attack the other side. Cards might have different impacts depending on the class of Axie you’re using it against -- for example, a Bird card used to attack a Beast Axie will cause an additional 15% damage. Each pair of classes has such a relationship with the others: \n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0effba82-8d83-4012-a7e9-0e56bdf9d834\\_342x296.png)\n\nAs Howard mentioned, this is a strategic game. It depends more on skill than luck of the draw. If you want to go deeper on the game itself, [start here](https://axie.substack.com/p/axie-infinity-community-alpha-guide). For our purposes, what’s most interesting is that by winning PvP and PvE battles and completing Daily Quests, players can earn Smooth Love Potion (SLP) tokens, so named because they’re required to breed new Axies. This is where Play-to-Earn comes in. \n\nThe top PvP players can earn up to 600 SLP a day, but for the typical worker, the max is around 200, which translates to $52 at the current SLP price of $0.26. In the US, that’s not a ton of money, but over $1,500 per month is a meaningful and potentially life-changing amount of money in many developing nations. With those SLP, players can do a few things: \n\n*   **Breed New Axies**. Axie Infinity doesn’t mint new Axies out of thin air. To meet the demand from new players, who each need three Axies to play, existing Axie holders breed new Axies from a pair of existing ones. Each Axie can be bred a maximum of seven times, and it costs the same base of 4 AXS plus an increasing number of SLP the more a particular Axie has been bred. A “Virgin Axie” costs 4 AXS + 150 SLP to breed ($108.92 at today’s prices). Given the floor price of $195 per Axie, that’s a profitable trade.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd579b4e-8948-47d4-89c2-492ec9764cc0\\_785x359.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd579b4e-8948-47d4-89c2-492ec9764cc0\\_785x359.png)\n\n*   **Speculate.** SLP holders might want to hold on to their SLP to speculate on the price. Over the past year, the price of one SLP is up 21.8x, from $0.0122 to $0.2664. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78bac89a-d12b-491a-b273-6979f91ac520\\_943x486.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78bac89a-d12b-491a-b273-6979f91ac520\\_943x486.png)\n\n*   **Exchange for Fiat.** Both AXS and SLP are currently tradable on major decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Uniswap. In the near future, they may be able to do so on Axie’s own DEX 👀  Many players earn SLP, then exchange it for money to pay their real-world bills. \n\nIt’s this last use that’s captured the public’s imagination, and caused such an explosion in Axie usage. During COVID, when many people in developing countries, who were living hand-to-mouth as it was, lost their jobs, they turned to Axie Infinity to make ends meet. There’s even a short documentary, *Play-to-Earn*, about the phenomenon:\n\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo-BrASMHU4)\n\nThe documentary showcases a Filipino town called Cabanatuan City, where Axie spread from one person to many, including a 75-year-old couple named Lolo and Lola Silverio, who play Axie to supplement the $5-6 they make from their small shop per day and pay for their medical expenses. \n\n[![Source: Play-to-Earn](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff52dab2e-fde4-4a1d-b059-24192b654daa\\_1600x825.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff52dab2e-fde4-4a1d-b059-24192b654daa\\_1600x825.png)\n\nIf you’ve been paying close attention, you might ask, “How could Lolo and Lola afford to buy the three Axies required to get started? Don’t they cost at least $195?” \n\nI’m glad you asked. This is one of the most fascinating things happening in the Axie Economy. Scholarship programs have sprung  up across the globe to provide aspiring players with their own teams of Axies. The scholarship essentially rents players Axies, and gets paid back through a revenue share from SLP proceeds.  \n\nThe documentary highlights both a local scholarship program in Cabanatuan, which provides Axies and training to local players, and [Yield Guild Games](https://yieldguild.io/), which does the same globally, for Axie Infinity and emerging games like *The Sandbox* and *League of Kingdoms*. Scores of people send real, well-formatted resumes to Yield Guild and other scholarship programs every day, showing off not just their professional credentials, but their gaming experience as well.\n\nBecause there’s been more demand than Yield Guild can meet, it launched a Sponsor-a-Scholar program that lets benefactors give players their start. Li Jin recently announced the [Leaping Corgi Scholarship](https://li.mirror.xyz/Dd7gY8Ip1tRcpznNhunVRMfpwKeZcnIIKIUgx4RFO38), which funded a total of 87 scholarships from the proceeds of an NFT sale. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67c09bbb-a8b6-4432-9eb4-391b49b73149\\_719x406.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67c09bbb-a8b6-4432-9eb4-391b49b73149\\_719x406.png)\n\nLet’s pause. This is wild. The proceeds from NFT auctions are going to scholarships to support people in developing countries who want to earn a living by playing a Free-to-Earn, NFT-based game in the Metaverse. If I had written that sentence eighteen months ago, you would have looked at me like I was crazy. You still might be looking at me like I’m crazy right now. But they’re not even alone! \n\nCoinGecko recently put together a list of [ten Axie Scholarship providers](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/smooth-love-potion/axie_scholarship_guide#panel). What’s crazy to see is that most of them are based in the Philippines themselves. This isn’t developed countries extracting from developing ones; it’s people in developing countries helping each other out, and building successively bigger businesses on top of Axie’s platform. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc23f6a6a-8630-439c-a24f-bbe5f03e84d8\\_1600x803.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc23f6a6a-8630-439c-a24f-bbe5f03e84d8\\_1600x803.png)\n\nIn a world that rapidly moved online at the same time that blockchain-based businesses and economies found product-market fit, Axie Infinity is more likely to be a glimpse into the future of work than a flash in the pan. People are building businesses in the Metaverse from wherever they happen to live.\n\n**The Metaverse is already here, *****and***** it’s evenly distributed**.\n\nAlready, in addition to Scholarships, sponsors are offering to support players, and providing their own Play-to-Earn quests. DeFi protocols have been the first big sponsors, rewarding Axie players with their own assets for completing quests. Maker gave players its stablecoin, DAI, Aave gave players its AAVE token, and Digix gave players real gold. In other words, sponsors are directly rewarding players for their attention. \n\nThe opportunity to make a living playing games was enough to get hundreds of thousands of people, an estimated 60% of whom are in the Philippines, to go through Axie’s complicated onboarding process. Axie’s current 600k players are just a fraction of the Philippines’ 111 million people, let alone the addressable population of Play-to-Earn players around the world.\n\nEven before the past three months’ rush, the appeal of Axie’s model created a crush of demand that flooded Ethereum, whose gas fees crushed Axie in turn. So Sky Mavis decided to take matters into its own hands. \n\n### Enter the Ronin\n\nLast June, when DeFi Summer was just getting underway, Ethereum was awoken from its two-year slumber by the loud clatter of demand for blockspace. At the time, Axie Infinity built right on top of the Ethereum blockchain for its most commonly-used items, Axie NFTs and SLP tokens. It kept its less frequently-used Land NFTs and Item NFTs in a Loom sidechain, and hadn’t yet released its AXS governance token. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96919106-ca1e-4aee-b29c-e55c16a1ecda\\_1440x442.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96919106-ca1e-4aee-b29c-e55c16a1ecda\\_1440x442.png)\n\nAxie NFT and SLP activity contributed to growing congestion on the Ethereum network, and also suffered when gas prices on Ethereum spiked. In a June [blog post](https://medium.com/axie-infinity/introducing-ronin-axie-infinitys-ethereum-sidechain-8745e31eaef1), the team wrote as much, calling Ethereum network congestion “a perpetual thorn in our side.” In the post, they announced that they were building their own sidechain: Ronin. \n\n> *In order for Axie Infinity to reach our second, third, and fourth-degree connections (the friends and family of our friends and family) Axie needs a long term solution that makes participating in the Axie game & economy, fast, cheap, and seamless. We need it to be fun and easy!*\n>\n> *That’s why today we’re announcing our work on Ronin — an Ethereum-linked sidechain made specifically for Axie Infinity. **A Ronin was a samurai without a master in feudal Japan and Ronin represents our desire to take the destiny of our product into our own hands.***\n\nMany decentralized apps (dApps) built on Ethereum felt the pain of congestion. Very few built their own sidechain, instead opting to use other layer 2 scaling solutions, like Polygon and Optimism. Even Uniswap, Ethereum’s biggest gas guzzler, decided to launch v3 on Ethereum Mainnet and Optimism instead of building its own. \n\nNot Axie. Axie wanted to build its own sidechain, Ronin, with its own wallet. That would be ambitious at today’s massive volumes. It was particularly ambitious back then given that in June 2020, Axie did a measly $2,044.09 in revenue. But they went for it, built for a year, and in early May, Axie Infinity migrated to Ronin. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93e84c9f-9714-4e65-a720-e0844d35cea2\\_1440x533.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93e84c9f-9714-4e65-a720-e0844d35cea2\\_1440x533.png)\n\nAfter the migration, everything in the Axie universe took place on the Ronin sidechain, and bridged into Ethereum when needed. Today, SLP and AXS are the main items that go over the bridge. The ERC-721 assets -- Axies, Land, and Items -- aren’t yet transferable over the bridge, but Jiho told me people haven’t been asking for that feature yet. The assets are more valuable within the Axie universe than they are anywhere else, and largely thanks to Ronin, there’s more activity happening inside of the Axie universe than there is anywhere else in web3. \n\n### Axie by the Numbers: Infinity Revenue\n\nWe’re talking about games today, so let’s play a game: spot the place on this chart where Axie released Ronin.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bb40da9-89f5-4b34-a03f-c1e7e429daa4\\_983x504.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bb40da9-89f5-4b34-a03f-c1e7e429daa4\\_983x504.png)\n\nSince unblocking the congestion issue in May, Axie has caught fire.

Interestingly, if you take out the roughly $2.2 million in gas fees that Axie paid to Ethereum over the past week, Axie re-takes the lead. \n\nIt generated $39 million in revenue compared to Bitcoin’s $4.5 million, or as Jiho so eloquently put it, “**The pets are generating 7x the fees of the pet rock.**”  \n\nEven better, Axie Infinity’s Community Treasury is capturing this revenue. It’s not being paid out as gas or other mining fees. When you just compare ***protocol revenue***, the amount captured by the protocol itself, Axie blows the competition out of the water.\n\n![Source: Token Terminal](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc301a5a-5fc5-46ce-bd66-f39ee32f5d3c_1485x528.png)\n\nOver the past 30 days, according to [Token Terminal](https://www.tokenterminal.com/terminal/metrics/protocol_revenue), Axie has generated more than 7x the protocol revenue than its next closest competitor, PancakeSwap, the leading Dex on the Binance Smart Chain. It also beats out DeFi giants like Compound, Aave, SushiSwap, and MakerDAO. \n\nWhat’s even wilder is that **Axie generated more protocol revenue in the last 30 days -- $81.5 million -- than any of the other dApps or blockchains in the set made in the past year.**\n\n![Source: Token Terminal](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1471d8cb-b4bc-4410-a784-3db422d9e088_1460x525.png)\n\nNot bad for a cute game. But how’s it doing against the NFT Marketplaces in terms of total volume? Certainly people can’t be buying more money’s worth of Axies than all of the NFTs on OpenSea or CryptoPunks, right?\n\n![Source: DappRadar](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4485ec8f-cb79-46a6-b93f-b2abcc077e0c_1091x652.gif)\n\nOver the past 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days, Axie Infinity has done more volume than any other NFT Marketplace, including open ones like OpenSea, Foundation, and Rarible, and asset-specific ones like CryptoPunks, NBA TopShot, and SoRare. It’s now third all-time by volume, and amazingly, **its past 30 day volume alone would rank third all-time!**\n\nWith all of that activity, despite the fact that most of the action takes place on the Ronin sidechain, Axie is still the [number four gas guzzler on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/gastracker).\n\n![Source: EtherScan](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb312194-c44c-42d9-a2bb-0c5aca3e4343_1366x341.png)\n\nFinally, there’s the tokens themselves. AXS, the game’s governance token, dropped in early November 2020 and has grown 10,964% since, to a market cap of $1.1 billion. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c57e0ae-481b-4925-a2b2-26afbb5a9daf\\_948x471.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c57e0ae-481b-4925-a2b2-26afbb5a9daf\\_948x471.png)\n\nDespite the rapid growth, according to [Delphi Digital](https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/axie-trends-toward-infinity/), AXS still only trades at a P/E ratio of 7.7x. (Delphi is an investor in Axie, one of the best web3 research companies, and helped design the AXS token, so their understanding of this protocol is second-to-none.) ​​\n\nCompare Axie’s 7.7x P/E to Roblox, which is still unprofitable, and Grand Theft Auto-maker TakeTwo, which trades at a 33.5x P/E ratio. If Axie can even maintain current levels, these levels will look incredibly cheap. \n\nI could go on, but suffice it to say, this game is an absolute monster, pun intended. \n\nBut it’s not just about the money. Axie polled its players on their main motivation for playing Axie Infinity. 48% said they played for the economy, forming a solid base of people building livings on the platform, but 37% said that their main motivation is the **community**. That community mainly lives in [Axie’s 549k member Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/axie). It’s one of only a handful of Discord servers with over half a million people in the world. Until very recently, Discord didn’t even support communities over 500k people. Fortnite, for comparison, has about 800k. \n\nNumbers can be gamed; real community and product love can’t. \n\nOver the past week, Axie has seen so much volume that its servers have been going down. The company sent a message in its Discord saying that: \n\n> *Hooking a game up to blockchain data is a new invention; something that nobody has ever done before with a large number of players. Things were going smoothly until the last few weeks but the server started to breakdown **once we passed 500,000 daily active players**.*\n\nThat’s a huge problem, and a great problem to have. Many of Axie’s users can’t play. After going up continuously every minute, Axie’s revenue numbers seem to have stalled for a few hours yesterday. And yet, people keep trying to get in and play. They can’t stop playing Axie Infinity. It will be fascinating to see how quickly and furiously they bounce back once everything is running smoothly again.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/AxieInfinity/status/1416368513682272257?s=20)\n\nWhat’s most amazing about the issues is the response from the community, many of whom rely on Axie to make a living and were temporarily shut out. Go read the replies to that tweet. \n\nJiho told me that he’s most worried about the community staying “tight-knit, civil, and loving” as they scale. This test seems to be proving that for now, they’re good, which is important, because community love is a key piece of Axie Infinity’s strategy.\n\n### Vertical Integration in a World of Lego Blocks\n\n> *If we can build a community of millions of blockchain-educated users by bringing in new types of people, then we can build a juggernaut that eats other products.*\n>\n> *-- Jiho*\n\nRemember that quote from way back in the beginning of the piece, the one about cute, innocent-looking Axies masking the fact that it's a strategic game? The same can be said about Sky Mavis’ overall strategy, which is a never-before-seen **combination of vertical integration and decentralization**. \n\nPart of the beauty of web3 is that you can snap together existing protocols and smart contracts and blockchains and L2’s and dApps like Legos. That’s called composability. It means that companies can move faster and build more and more complex and mind-blowing products with fewer resources.  \n\nThe Sky Mavis team’s strategy for Axie Infinity is not that.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/AxiePuff/status/1416632925970337792?s=20)\n\nThis Tesla/SpaceX analogy seems to be a common refrain in the Axie community. Jiho made the same comparison when we spoke, reasoning that when you’re building something really complex, you need to build everything in-house. Tesla builds its own batteries, software, and parts. SpaceX built its entire supply chain from scratch, from rocket engines to electronics components. And Sky Mavis is building everything itself, too. \n\nThat started with the Intellectual Property (IP), the Axies themselves. Sky Mavis created the Origin Axies and mascots, and still holds them in its own wallet. \n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7fb46f9-700b-4485-a73e-5e5876d8d66f\\_414x122.png)\n\nNext came the game, which Sky Mavis developed and illustrated in-house. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f2f453d-6a34-4632-acbf-ffd8046c506f\\_1456x819.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f2f453d-6a34-4632-acbf-ffd8046c506f\\_1456x819.png)\n\nNext, Axie built its own NFT Marketplace in early 2018, despite the fact that [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) had already launched in December 2017 and is likely where the team would have bought and sold CryptoKitties. As mentioned, over the past month, Axie’s NFT marketplace has done more volume over the past 30 days than OpenSea has, despite only including Axie-specific NFTs.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa952ea1d-4e8f-4d47-a2ca-047b313e9cea\\_1600x804.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa952ea1d-4e8f-4d47-a2ca-047b313e9cea\\_1600x804.png)\n\nAxie is also building its own world, Lunacia, and began auctioning off parcels in 2019. Later that year, it merged its Axie and Land marketplaces into one. In the near future (although “near future” is a running joke in the community), it plans to release land-based gameplay, opening up new ways to engage the community, and importantly, new ways for players to earn money ([more here](https://axieedge.com/everything-we-know-about-land-gameplay/)).\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F840be252-2d46-4c80-8624-1234a7ad98af\\_1502x760.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F840be252-2d46-4c80-8624-1234a7ad98af\\_1502x760.png)\n\nSky Mavis also introduced their own in-game currency, exchangeable for fiat via ETH, SLP, and in November, dropped its own governance token, AXS. \n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ebea6f4-8db2-4883-a896-b9c9b2ffecb6\\_522x313.png)\n\nAs discussed, fed up with Ethereum congestion and gas fees, and not content with other peoples’ L2 solutions, Sky Mavis built and merged its own sidechain, Ronin, and an associated Ronin Wallet, which people need to install to play the game. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f8de454-79db-48e0-b66a-2fac75ee59c4\\_640x270.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f8de454-79db-48e0-b66a-2fac75ee59c4\\_640x270.png)\n\nWhew.

Currently, the main place that players are spending transaction fees outside of the Axie universe, and the biggest point of friction for a frequent use case, is when they need to exchange their SLP for ETH for fiat on a DEX like Uniswap. \n\n**The next step in Axie’s vertical integration is to build its own DEX.**\n\n[](https://twitter.com/AxieInfinity/status/1410955038768304129?s=20)\n\nCurrently, the plan is to make it easier for players to exchange their Axie-related tokens into money spendable in the real-world, which is critical for Play-to-Earn. According to this guy, that would save a lot of headache in itself:\n\n[](https://twitter.com/hhiker42/status/1413900845922414594?s=20)\n\nBut it also gives the Axie protocol more incentive to tokenize more things -- experience points, the Ronin sidechain itself -- all tradeable on the Ronin DEX. Jiho told me that he thinks it can become the most used DEX by number of users of all-time. \n\nWhich sounds crazy, until you realize the secret that Axie has figured out. \n\nOne of crypto’s biggest challenges to date has been figuring out mass adoption and use cases that keep people coming back. If Axie is able to amass the largest user base in crypto, help them earn a living, and keep them happy and engaged, they can turn that firehose on any product they choose. That’s why they’re vertically integrating now -- they have the users, they want to capture the upside *and* make the user experience better. \n\n**Axie isn’t just building a game; it’s building the web3 aggregator**, **and backwards integrating to own as much of the value chain as possible**. \n\nPlus, by creating something enjoyable in its own right, and attracting a ton of eyeballs, Axie is attracting capital that’s not seeking a return! That’s rare in crypto. That lowers its cost of capital and creates free revenue in a way that a DeFi protocol can’t. As just a few examples: \n\n*   **People buy Axies as pets**. There are two billion pet owners worldwide, 99.99999% of whom buy pets knowing that they’ll lose a lot of money. Axie is already attracting many people who just buy their Axies as pets with no expectation of return. \n*   **People who just love the game**. 15% of Axie players cite the gameplay as their main motivation in playing Axie, ahead of the economy or the community. Axie is doubling-down here by investing in better gameplay and animations. \n*   **E-Sports Tournaments**. Axie lends itself well to esports tournaments, and is already seeing its Twitch viewership rise in-line with recent activity. These tournaments will bring sponsorship money into the ecosystem in exchange for eyeballs.\n*   **Sponsors Providing Exogenous Capital**. As other aggregators like Facebook and Google know well, when you have a lot of users, you have a money-printing machine. Sponsors like Aave are already dumping exogenous capital into the system, and as Axie’s DAUs climb into the millions, there will be no shortage of sponsorship opportunities. Because revenue goes to the Community Treasury, which will be controlled by the players, the sponsorship relationship can be accretive instead of extractive. \n\nBut it gets crazier. Instead of keeping that money and power in the hands of the small, 40-person core team at Sky Mavis, **Axie is decentralizing at the same time as it’s vertically integrating**. \n\n### Decentralizing the Axie Universe\n\nAxie is decentralizing in a few ways. \n\nFirst, later this year, “the $AXS ecosystem begins.” Axie did the public sale of its AXS governance tokens back in November 2020, selling 11% of tokens to the public. Along with a private sale, advisory shares, the Sky Mavis team, and an ecosystem fund, 22.2% of the total 270 million AXS max started circulating then. \n\nIn order to progressively decentralize -- i.e. let the core team make decisions on behalf of the community -- the Sky Mavis team is able to vote the locked Play-to-Earn and Staking Reward tokens. As more AXS tokens are unlocked over a 65 month schedule, Sky Mavis will slowly lose voting power, until it loses its majority some time in late 2023.\n\n![Source: Axie Infinity Whitepaper](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbf28da0-73f1-4682-8acf-11fc48a4cae4_1043x649.png)\n\nTo date, Play-to-Earn has centered around earning SLP tokens, but in the coming months, players will also be able to earn AXS tokens through gameplay. At the same time, AXS holders will be able to stake their AXS to earn more staking rewards ([read more from Delphi here](https://www.notion.so/axie/AXS-Staking-Overview-by-Delphi-Digital-8c05de21eb2f46dc82e476802a7bf06c)), and to vote on the future direction of the game. In the whitepaper, the team laid out a few of the types of things that the community should be able to vote on:\n\n*   Should Axie Infinity Limited continue to pay Sky Mavis to develop Axie Infinity?\n*   Should Axie Infinity use the marketplace created by Sky Mavis?\n*   How should the Community Treasury be used to reward AXS holders and the broader Axie community?\n*   Should the Community Treasury funds be attached to any yield farming/staking services such as Yearn.finance or Rari.Capital? \n\nIn the second part of the one-two decentralization punch, Sky Mavis is going to open up an SDK to let other developers build new things. Jiho called it the “Internet Monster Protocol, where people can access the IP and make stuff.” The team envisions being able to use Axies across many user-generated games within one Axie universe.\n\nAlready, members of the community are generating Axie-content just for fun, with no expectation of reward, here:\n\n[](https://twitter.com/AxieKing/status/1415703209625092099?s=20)\n\nand here:\n\n[](https://twitter.com/irfreak/status/1415879625834520576?s=20)\n\nWithin the next two years, if all goes according to plan, Axie players will govern the direction of the community, mainly via voting on the use of Community Treasury funds, *and* will be able to build extensions to the universe themselves, all while earning tokens for their work. They might even decide to undo Axie’s vertical integration, or make new and better marketplaces, sidechains, wallets, and exchanges. \n\nIf they pull it off, Axie will be like Roblox on steroids, with better margins and better incentive alignment. Axie might become an even more important corner of the Metaverse, and a beacon for people building decentralized worlds online that blur work and play. \n\n### Infinity Possibilities\n\nAt what point does a virtual world intersect with and influence the physical one? \n\nToday, right now, hundreds of thousands of people are making a living playing a video game in a virtual world. They’re participants in a virtual economy who use their spoils to improve their lot in the physical world. Kids in the Philippines, Vietnam, Brazil, and beyond are applying for Axie Scholarships like they would apply for college or a job, hoping to bend their trajectories upwards. \n\nIn the virtual realm, Axie Infinity will expand and leverage its IP in predictable ways: \n\n*   **Content**. There’s almost zero chance we don’t see an Axie movie or Netflix show in the next few years. Might NFT ownership of Axies used in films generate royalty streams for their owners? Could owners of certain Mystic Axies negotiate with studios directly, or build their own characters online, as people are contemplating with Bored Apes and CryptoPunks? \n*   **Universe Expansion and UGC**. The Axie team has already said that they can’t make enough content and experiences to keep up with growing user demand, and that they want to turn to players for help. Might Axie Infinity become a platform for builders, the next Roblox, one that better aligns incentives and gives creators more tools to make money? \n*   **Crypto Expansion.** Having onboarded hundreds of thousands, and soon millions, of new users onto crypto, will Axie offer these crypto neophytes an increasing suite of tools to not just earn but manage and grow their stacks? \n\nIt sounds hyperbolic (and at this point, a couple of months into real revenue growth, it certainly is), but there’s a chance that Axie Infinity could become the most valuable IP of all-time. The current leader is uncoincidentally the franchise to which Axie publicly compares itself most often:\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85177b35-39e4-4052-9439-0a3afd9ed5c3\\_1000x600.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85177b35-39e4-4052-9439-0a3afd9ed5c3\\_1000x600.png)\n\nIt will be fascinating to watch all of that play out, but the truly gargantuan impact could come when the Axie Infinity recognizes the power that it has to shape real-world policy and help the world adapt to a future in which everyone no longer needs to work a traditional job to survive.\n\nBefore Axie, Jiho grew up collecting fossils and insects before studying military and economic history at Yale, where he wrote his thesis on Alexander Hamilton’s debt restructuring plan. Axie is the intersection of those two nerdy passions, and a chance to use his knowledge and passion to help design new economies.  \n\nWhen there are enough Axie players earning a living through the game, the team could work with governments to run controlled experiments on the impact of Universal Basic Income (UBI). It’s hard to measure the impact of UBI precisely in the messy environment that is the real-world, but governments could run experiments wherein they give UBI to certain Axie players and measure whether they remain active players, builders, and community participants. \n\nOne of the big challenges with UBI is that work is about more than money -- it’s about meaning and belonging and a sense of self-worth. As more and more becomes automated, and less and less human labor is required, we will need new ways to deliver those things along with a check. In Kurt Vonnegut’s first novel, 1952’s *[Player Piano](https://www.amazon.com/Player-Piano-Novel-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/0385333781)*, he describes a future world in which automation replaced the need for most jobs, and in response, the government hires people to dig holes and fill them back in, over and over. Axie might help usher in a more fulfilling, and fun, era of work in the Metaverse.\n\nAm I getting ahead of myself? Sure. A lot could go wrong. \n\n*   This whole crypto thing could fall apart (I don’t believe that, but it could happen).\n*   Even if it doesn’t fall apart long-term, another sustained Crypto Winter could lower the money available through Play-to-Earn, halt Axie’s momentum, and break up the community. \n*   Vertically integrating instead of using best-in-class existing products and protocols means more opportunities to mess up. \n*   Decentralizing, and giving power to the community, can and will lead to unpredictable results. \n*   The servers could continue to go down under the load and players might feel that they can no longer rely on Axie for their income.\n*   Gaming is notoriously fickle -- one month’s hot game could be old news the next. \n\nBut it feels like something special is happening here. Play-to-Earn can onboard new users looking to earn a living and keep them engaged in ways that look more like long-term employment than the latest gaming fad. Turning Axie Infinity into a platform, and one owned and governed by users at that, can create stickiness via network effects and high switching costs, as platforms are wont to do. The Metaverse will need more than entertainment; it will need to blur the lines between entertainment and employment. Axie is already proving that’s possible.\n\nAxie’s ascent comes at a time when crypto is trading sideways, when NFTs are supposed to be dead, and when people are questioning whether this whole web3 thing will really have any real-world impact. In a category that typically trades in lockstep, Axie’s outperformance seems like something that’s worth paying attention to. \n\nWhen we look back in a decade or two, my bet is that this period in Axie’s life is just the start of something huge, a small blip on a much bigger graph, both in terms of revenue and impact. In the mid-case, it’s a player-owned, Pokémon-sized juggernaut and an example of the benefits of vertical integration.

{"id": "EaRjW0VwJF6P1SsKUkZMjINahR2EcPtjlg95upwV2tI", "title": "Hip Hop, Blogs and NFTs: Unbundling, Remixing and Reintegrating Media (NFT Drop)", "body": "\n*Long Term maximum value requires accepting  — even embracing — loss of control.*\n\nIn the 20th Century, media became an industrial product. This process had started with print, initially in the United Kingdom, and led to the massive successes of the newspaper and publishing industries. This same approach was applied to film, leading to the Hollywood studio system, which consciously employed the same production line framework as Ford's Detroit plants. So too did music become a production-oriented industry. Tin Pan Alley and the famous Brill Building were factories of culture, churning out songs, which would be paired with artists, recorded and pressed for distribution.\n\nThe heart of this transformation was the realization that there were economies of scale that, especially when coupled with the protections of copyright, could generate attractive profits for shareholders. The media company would have knowledge of its customer, through the new science of market research. This insight would be used to develop products that the market would desire. The products would be produced as efficiently as possible, pushing talent to create new work on budget and schedule.\n\nUsing the growing power of the media and its advertising complement, marketing departments would endeavor to turn products into hits, and hits into sequels, series and ongoing successes. The experience was delivered and defined by the industries directly, with a clear line of responsibilities-- and influence -- flowing from the creators to consumers. This taxonomy of roles gave a lot of power to the producers, who monopolized both development and delivery of goods across all industries.\n\nThen came the Internet, and the first casualty of industrial-era media was the same sector that started it: *newspapers*. Newspapers got unbundled, which deconstructed their core business units and then remixing began. But instead of newspapers reintegrating the value into their business, challengers emerged by way of social networks and reintegrated an environment that spun away from industrial control, built on community created content. \n\n> This provided the blueprint of remixed culture; industry bundles, unbundled by business, remixed by community and reintegrated into new mediums of exchange.\n\nBut let’s bring it back one time.\n\nOver the centuries of its steady growth, publishing had realized the way to maximize revenues was to include as much as possible within its ‘package.’ For ad-based titles, that meant bundling in as much advertising of as many kinds as possible: display, coupons, fliers, classifieds. That’s how we got editions of Vogue that weighed over five pounds and runs of the Sunday New York Times with so many inserts it needed to be wrapped in plastic. But publishing on the Web made it possible to ignore all that paid content. A reader could come to a story through a link and, apart from a few banners, never even encounter the classifieds. Worse, other pureplay startups were actually better at rebundling in advertising than the publishers.\n\n*Music was next.*\n\nThe seeds were planted in the mid-1960s with the creation of the Long Play (LP). With this new technology, artists suddenly had a much broader canvas on which they could ‘paint’ their musical ideas. The most ambitious acts realized the potential and almost overnight transformed the purpose of pop. And the labels, after years of focusing almost exclusively on the single, recognized this bigger bundle could make them a lot more money. By the end of the 1970s, however, the album was struggling. Under pressure to produce enough content to fill two long sides, the quality had crashed and newer genres (Disco, Punk, Hip-Hop) had gravitated back to shorter formats. A cash cow was in jeopardy. The answer? CDs. For a while it worked very very well. The new bundle was less expensive to make but the labels were able to charge more for it. People even bought CDs to replace their vinyl favorites. Happy days, for the industry, were here again.\n\n*But then came file-sharing.* \n\nMusic fans had been ‘stealing’ and sharing music, of course, since the creation of the Philips home cassette recorder in the 1960s. Entire cultures, like Deadheads, grew up around the swapping of prized recordings. Mixtape making became a passion for millions of fans. But it had never been a threat to the industry before. By 2001, the ever-increasing cost of CDs, the low killer/filler ratio of the bundle, and the superpowers of the Internet coincided to create the perfect storm. \n\nSuperfans took desires into their own hands. If they weren’t able to buy and trade music the way they wanted, they were going to take control of both the pricing and experience. This revolution changed the fan and artist relationship as we knew it, forcing an industry stuck on its laurels and business models into the internet age. It was chaotic, near fatal, and left much of the businesses history up to that point in its wake. But it forced an entirely new business around relationships and IP and evolved to a model that was a creative unlock for fans, labels and artists alike leading to an eventual restabilization. \n\nNapster was just an early first step in the move towards the new creator to fan model but it was the moment where the industry admitted that the audience is ultimately in control. IP could be adjusted, manipulated and remixed. It ushered in a new age.\n\nAcross media, this technologically mediated process has led to the unbundling, rebundling, remixing and then reintegration of content and IP. Traditionally, IP has been a one way process; a creator of IP licenses to another party and it goes down the assembly line. But thanks to technology that’s changed. Today media is increasingly dominated by decentralized IP that takes a different approach, one that presents a multi-directional relationship between fan and creator. And when we talk about remixing, it’s not just about re-imagining third-party material. It’s about creating entirely new work. \n\n***These Are The Good Times***\n\nThere’s no precise moment to mark the beginning of the remix era. But it’s important to recognize that one reason shorter form vinyl came back into popularity by the end of the 1970s was not only because the album had become a bloated mess of throwaway tracks; it was because club DJs had figured out how to take R&B songs and make them into something amazing. And they did it live. They played songs with great hooks, and to keep their audiences dancing and happy, figured out how to use the turntable to drop back and keep the party going. This wasn’t a new song exactly, but it was a longer version of it. \n\nPretty soon, labels who wanted their artists promoted in discos came out with special versions of songs with longer dance sections, or breakdowns. This led directly into the next innovation, the seamless merging of one song with the one that followed. The aim was to never let the dance floor get empty. So the best figured out how to time the transition just right such that it created one continuous flow of melody. There would be this wonderful moment at the merging point where the two songs played over each other, making something recognizable and yet novel. Rap emcees added one more layer on top, taking the Jamaican toasting style and James Brownian braggadociousness, now creating something lyrical and truly original. \n\nIt’s probably not an accident that the musical breakthrough of hip hop resembled the layered effect of New York graffiti, a palimpsest of different artists adding their own signature contributions. Not quite as criminal as tagging subway cars, but it existed outside the law. Not that anybody cared at first. The first recorded rap songs were cassettes sold on street corners and out of car trunks. But eventually their popularity was too big for the gray market and crews put out real records. And promptly got sued. Probably the most famous early example was ‘Rapper’s Delight.’ Layering their infectious phrases over a barely modified Nile Rodgers’ baseline, the Sugarhill Gang scored the first ever Billboard Hot 100 hip hop hit. Once Chic’s lawyers got involved, Nile and his partner Bernard Edwards were added as songwriters and the rest is musical history. Forty years later, hip hop is arguably the most popular genre in the world, and it’s all based on sampling. \n\n***On the Internet nobody knows you’re a blog***\n\nA similar remix process happened to news and written content more broadly. Now that newspapers and magazines had been unbundled on the Web, they, like singles in music, could be harvested for the creation of something new and created by end-users. \n\n‘User-created content,’ of course, is as old as the Internet, which was designed by and around research institutions with no inherent sense of professional versus amateur content. Anyone who had an account with access was a potential publisher. Creators took advantage of the freedom of the early Internet to write and share content on subjects they loved. Usenet and Gopher directories were bursting with original commentary and reviews of favorite shows and books, like Lord of the Rings, Dune and Star Trek. And the most original aspect of this geek creativity was fanfic, unauthorized new stories featuring beloved characters, often in transgressive romantic situations. \n\nThen came the Web, and for a while, the graphical/visual flavor of this new UX helped reassert the dominance of professional publishers. In the late 90s, every newspaper rushed to build websites and make distribution deals. Offline titles with their logos and photos, organized into the channels of ‘portals,’ all festooned with branded banners, seemed like a new normal. User-creators were herded into message boards, chat rooms and community features, below the fold, away from the ads. The professional content was the star of the show.\n\nBut it didn’t last long. The bubble popped, the portals crashed and the bottom-up energy of the Usenet came roaring back under the rubric of Web 2.0. It was a whole constellation of new technologies and ideologies but they crystallized in the concept of the weblog. \n\nBlogs began as a kind of online public diary — hence the name — but fairly soon, the most common purpose was public commentary, typically written around quotes from and links to news articles. Some blogs, like the Drudge Report, were like alternative versions of a newspaper front page, with the blogger playing the role of the front page editor, picking the most important stories from across the Web and rewriting the headlines. Others blogs would take one news article and deconstruct it, annotating and criticizing. All this was made possible, needless to say, because all those professional publishers had unbundled their content, at that time rarely behind subscription walls or even registration, directly on the Web. There was free and easy access to the underlying raw material. Blogs were remixing it and each other with captivating results. \n\nWe all know what happened next. The open APIs and protocols of blogging were swallowed up by the increasingly closed but increasingly viral feeds of social networks. Entirely new forms of visual communication, memes, with unique styles of humor and patterns of layered remixing, thrived, reaching millions within minutes, driving ‘engagement.’ What had been unbundled and remixed had suddenly become bundled again. Inside these massive algorithmic systems, creators were more powerful than ever and yet curiously also powerless. Publishers faced the same sort of dilemma. Without the amplification of the remixing influencers (as they came to be called), the media companies got no amplification. But all the unbundled content they pumped in only made the social networks stronger. We’ve been dealing with the consequences and ramifications on our cultural, political and social lives ever since. And it’s only accelerating. \n\n***The TikTokification of IP***\n\nSimilar to the music business in the hip hop era, it’s increasingly hard for today’s media companies to absolutely prevent developers, creators, fans and consumers from building on top of their IP. This is not new, and anyone walking through Times Square in Manhattan knows that Bumblebee or The Minions will work tirelessly to latch on to you, grab a selfie and chase you down for $10. More broadly, major media hits have long been remixed versions of existing IP. This has been happening in the games industry for decades where every major hit, from Counterstrike, to Fortnite, to League of Legends has been a user generated mod of an existing popular game and IP. But while it isn’t new, the pace of remixing is increasing, and the practical control IP owners have over their works is slipping and the social acceptance and in fact critical importance of remixing is only rising exponentially. \n\nLook no further than the rise of Tiktok. TikTok is the most important social network today for shaping culture and it is largely powered by a mass market remixing system unlike any we’ve ever had. In many respects, TikTok is the inevitable and natural conclusion of the memfication and socialization of content. If the medium is the message, then IP is the ink with which it's written. Users react, recreate, remix and redefine any and all IP in a massive algorithmically driven social experiment designed to take existing ideas, content, and formats, mash them together perhaps with a bit of something new, throw them at the wall, and see what sticks, only to scrape up what does and start the whole process over again.\n\nOf course the tiktokification of IP is happening everywhere. Its happening on Roblox with respect to games and virtual experiences, its happening on soundcloud with respect to music, its happening on Wattpad with respect to text. The catalyst for an industry to move from one-way to two-way IP relationships is the emergence of tooling that lowers the barrier of entry to engage with the IP itself. Like the shift from newspapers to social networks, today’s IP is evolving from community engagement and consumption to community creation and development. \n\n***A generation of reintegration***\n\nOne important way this is likely to happen now is NFTs. Over the next several years, it’s probable that every media company who owns popular characters, worlds and brands is going to enable users to collect these individual unbundled assets by owning them as tokens. The driving motivation for these IP businesses is not a preference for unbundling, of course. Like every other profit-maximizing organization, they understand the value of forcing customers to buy a larger package. But creative companies are operating within a media landscape that is dominated by a small number of even bigger bundlers, the social networks, streaming platforms and app stores. On all sides, opportunities for direct relationships with and uncapped revenue from end-users are drying up. In this context, the possibilities offered by NFTs are tantalizing: a near zero-cost product that can be sold and re-sold, perhaps for a considerable amount, without any disintermediation. And on the surface, it’s a model that looks almost exactly like merchandising, a business they know well.\n\nBut, as we’ve seen over and over again, regardless of why unbundling occurs, whether because consumers force it or producers embrace it (and it’s usually a combination), one result will always be remixing. When the atom of IP gets smaller and easier to handle, creative recombination -- a new molecule! -- becomes inevitable. And NFTs, like all blockchain elements and assets, are designed to be combined. So we’re heading towards another perfect storm: unbundled popular IP, issues as composable media ‘legos,’ in the hands of millions of creative people armed with powerful computers (phones) and distribution.\n\nLike other remix moments, IP owners will be faced with a challenge. Their cultural tendencies are still rooted in the industrial past. Their strong preference is to control the entire process, from idea to franchise. Indeed, many of the media forms which generate the greatest profits (movies, video games and theme parks) require years of careful planning and control. Despite everything they’ve seen over the past 50 years, IP owners are unprepared. Some will sue. They will add scary terms (‘copyfright’) to the sales of their NFTs and send out cease-and-desist letters, especially when the new combinations start making money for their creators. Some will be tolerant, watching quietly from the sidelines, perhaps fearful of fan backlash. Still others will be excited cheerleaders, tweeting out cool and amusing examples of their stuff remixed. \n\nThe greatest opportunity is one big step beyond any of these tactics: **reintegration**. The logical end to industrial media, the creative mode finally enabled by the blockchain, is a dynamic system where the remix continuously flows back into the source material. Is this practically possible? Could there ever be a version of the Star Wars Universe, for example, where stories or games that were created by fans, depicted or played using NFTs, were embraced and included within the canon? How would decisions of what to include be made, and by whom? And perhaps most importantly, could the creators of these remixes be rewarded for their contributions? \n\nThe winners of the next media era will have answers to these questions. \n\n***So where does that leave IP?***\n\nAs platforms emerge to enable creators to better construct, remix and monetize new IP, brands and creators need to make a decision as to whether to give access to creative development or to make creative development “hackable”. In the case of Napster, the industry overlooked the power of digital and instead of structuring a business in the internet age, fans hacked the early prototypes that would be consumer downloads and streaming for the music business to then take and build sophistication onto afterwards. In the case of TikTok, these tools are provided as part of the platform; consumers are creators and are encouraged to compound value on top of each other’s IP in order to make it more engaging, more participatory. This is increasingly the same for gaming and other industries that have recognized the value of removing the barriers of fan and creator and seeing the value of encouraging others to build on top of their IP. \n\nThe larger question about NFTs and media is how they will inevitably be used by ‘collectors’ to make new versions of storyworlds, a process which then presents the IP owner with the problem of how to consider those new creations. Should they be ignored? Tolerated? Or celebrated and integrated? It’s a challenge that is not going away. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2e26334e-b039-40e6-a225-571d57b9d9fa.png?height=607&width=587)\n\nThe process of bundle, unbundle, remix, reintegration isn’t linear. The disruption of industrial models doesn’t completely leave the existing platforms, creators and IP in its wake, it just moves them to either adjust or forfeit existing control. If we are moving towards a more accelerated remix culture, IP owners will need to decide whether to cede ground to fans, community members and other artists or adjust their existing value proposition. The tension is already there.\n\nMaybe the next generation of media mindset is being able to bring together all of this creativity and move it towards something? Or rethinking the way franchises develop and bridge relationships with fans in the forms of DAOs or other participation structures? Maybe the more things change the more they stay the same?\n\nThere are many questions. But here’s what we do know. IP is moving from one way to two way creation and consumption. Technology is making every content format developable and by making a genre \"developable\", it supercharges the two way IP model. When access becomes available to more than just experts, it starts to make the consumer more important than the creator and open season for remixing. As such franchises and content in general are already governed by fans, even if IP holders don't acknowledge it. \n\nTo be successful in this new world, IP holders will need to adjust and focus less on control and more on managing chaos. The new media model will employ a mindset of being able to take all of this creativity and move it towards something completely new, leveraging the systems and skills to listen, integrate, celebrate and put periphery into the center of its work. As remixing becomes increasingly accepted and encouraged as an art form, and product strategies congregate around platforms built for its reintegration, the decision to open up IP must be embraced by the creators themselves or it will be imposed by their audiences. The same way it always has been. \n", "timestamp": 1626792662, "digest": "seA6j67Jc0mm8vqGe1zTuXC7O0h95XlmazSQXDlrd24", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

Like the shift from newspapers to social networks, today’s IP is evolving from community engagement and consumption to community creation and development. \n\n***A generation of reintegration***\n\nOne important way this is likely to happen now is NFTs. Over the next several years, it’s probable that every media company who owns popular characters, worlds and brands is going to enable users to collect these individual unbundled assets by owning them as tokens. The driving motivation for these IP businesses is not a preference for unbundling, of course. Like every other profit-maximizing organization, they understand the value of forcing customers to buy a larger package. But creative companies are operating within a media landscape that is dominated by a small number of even bigger bundlers, the social networks, streaming platforms and app stores. On all sides, opportunities for direct relationships with and uncapped revenue from end-users are drying up. In this context, the possibilities offered by NFTs are tantalizing: a near zero-cost product that can be sold and re-sold, perhaps for a considerable amount, without any disintermediation. And on the surface, it’s a model that looks almost exactly like merchandising, a business they know well.\n\nBut, as we’ve seen over and over again, regardless of why unbundling occurs, whether because consumers force it or producers embrace it (and it’s usually a combination), one result will always be remixing. When the atom of IP gets smaller and easier to handle, creative recombination -- a new molecule! -- becomes inevitable. And NFTs, like all blockchain elements and assets, are designed to be combined. So we’re heading towards another perfect storm: unbundled popular IP, issues as composable media ‘legos,’ in the hands of millions of creative people armed with powerful computers (phones) and distribution.\n\nLike other remix moments, IP owners will be faced with a challenge. Their cultural tendencies are still rooted in the industrial past. Their strong preference is to control the entire process, from idea to franchise. Indeed, many of the media forms which generate the greatest profits (movies, video games and theme parks) require years of careful planning and control. Despite everything they’ve seen over the past 50 years, IP owners are unprepared. Some will sue. They will add scary terms (‘copyfright’) to the sales of their NFTs and send out cease-and-desist letters, especially when the new combinations start making money for their creators. Some will be tolerant, watching quietly from the sidelines, perhaps fearful of fan backlash. Still others will be excited cheerleaders, tweeting out cool and amusing examples of their stuff remixed. \n\nThe greatest opportunity is one big step beyond any of these tactics: **reintegration**. The logical end to industrial media, the creative mode finally enabled by the blockchain, is a dynamic system where the remix continuously flows back into the source material. Is this practically possible? Could there ever be a version of the Star Wars Universe, for example, where stories or games that were created by fans, depicted or played using NFTs, were embraced and included within the canon? How would decisions of what to include be made, and by whom? And perhaps most importantly, could the creators of these remixes be rewarded for their contributions? \n\nThe winners of the next media era will have answers to these questions. \n\n***So where does that leave IP?***\n\nAs platforms emerge to enable creators to better construct, remix and monetize new IP, brands and creators need to make a decision as to whether to give access to creative development or to make creative development “hackable”. In the case of Napster, the industry overlooked the power of digital and instead of structuring a business in the internet age, fans hacked the early prototypes that would be consumer downloads and streaming for the music business to then take and build sophistication onto afterwards. In the case of TikTok, these tools are provided as part of the platform; consumers are creators and are encouraged to compound value on top of each other’s IP in order to make it more engaging, more participatory. This is increasingly the same for gaming and other industries that have recognized the value of removing the barriers of fan and creator and seeing the value of encouraging others to build on top of their IP. \n\nThe larger question about NFTs and media is how they will inevitably be used by ‘collectors’ to make new versions of storyworlds, a process which then presents the IP owner with the problem of how to consider those new creations. Should they be ignored? Tolerated? Or celebrated and integrated? It’s a challenge that is not going away. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2e26334e-b039-40e6-a225-571d57b9d9fa.png?height=607&width=587)\n\nThe process of bundle, unbundle, remix, reintegration isn’t linear. The disruption of industrial models doesn’t completely leave the existing platforms, creators and IP in its wake, it just moves them to either adjust or forfeit existing control. If we are moving towards a more accelerated remix culture, IP owners will need to decide whether to cede ground to fans, community members and other artists or adjust their existing value proposition. The tension is already there.\n\nMaybe the next generation of media mindset is being able to bring together all of this creativity and move it towards something? Or rethinking the way franchises develop and bridge relationships with fans in the forms of DAOs or other participation structures? Maybe the more things change the more they stay the same?\n\nThere are many questions. But here’s what we do know. IP is moving from one way to two way creation and consumption. Technology is making every content format developable and by making a genre \"developable\", it supercharges the two way IP model. When access becomes available to more than just experts, it starts to make the consumer more important than the creator and open season for remixing. As such franchises and content in general are already governed by fans, even if IP holders don't acknowledge it. \n\nTo be successful in this new world, IP holders will need to adjust and focus less on control and more on managing chaos. The new media model will employ a mindset of being able to take all of this creativity and move it towards something completely new, leveraging the systems and skills to listen, integrate, celebrate and put periphery into the center of its work. As remixing becomes increasingly accepted and encouraged as an art form, and product strategies congregate around platforms built for its reintegration, the decision to open up IP must be embraced by the creators themselves or it will be imposed by their audiences. The same way it always has been. \n", "timestamp": 1626792870, "digest": "seA6j67Jc0mm8vqGe1zTuXC7O0h95XlmazSQXDlrd24", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

This process had started with print, initially in the United Kingdom, and led to the massive successes of the newspaper and publishing industries. This same approach was applied to film, leading to the Hollywood studio system, which consciously employed the same production line framework as Ford's Detroit plants. So too did music become a production-oriented industry. Tin Pan Alley and the famous Brill Building were factories of culture, churning out songs, which would be paired with artists, recorded and pressed for distribution.\n\nThe heart of this transformation was the realization that there were economies of scale that, especially when coupled with the protections of copyright, could generate attractive profits for shareholders. The media company would have knowledge of its customer, through the new science of market research. This insight would be used to develop products that the market would desire. The products would be produced as efficiently as possible, pushing talent to create new work on budget and schedule.\n\nUsing the growing power of the media and its advertising complement, marketing departments would endeavor to turn products into hits, and hits into sequels, series and ongoing successes. The experience was delivered and defined by the industries directly, with a clear line of responsibilities-- and influence -- flowing from the creators to consumers. This taxonomy of roles gave a lot of power to the producers, who monopolized both development and delivery of goods across all industries.\n\nThen came the Internet, and the first casualty of industrial-era media was the same sector that started it: *newspapers*. Newspapers got unbundled, which deconstructed their core business units and then remixing began. But instead of newspapers reintegrating the value into their business, challengers emerged by way of social networks and reintegrated an environment that spun away from industrial control, built on community created content. \n\n> This provided the blueprint of remixed culture; industry bundles, unbundled by business, remixed by community and reintegrated into new mediums of exchange.\n\nBut let’s bring it back one time.\n\nOver the centuries of its steady growth, publishing had realized the way to maximize revenues was to include as much as possible within its ‘package.’ For ad-based titles, that meant bundling in as much advertising of as many kinds as possible: display, coupons, fliers, classifieds. That’s how we got editions of Vogue that weighed over five pounds and runs of the Sunday New York Times with so many inserts it needed to be wrapped in plastic. But publishing on the Web made it possible to ignore all that paid content. A reader could come to a story through a link and, apart from a few banners, never even encounter the classifieds. Worse, other pureplay startups were actually better at rebundling in advertising than the publishers.\n\n*Music was next.*\n\nThe seeds were planted in the mid-1960s with the creation of the Long Play (LP). With this new technology, artists suddenly had a much broader canvas on which they could ‘paint’ their musical ideas. The most ambitious acts realized the potential and almost overnight transformed the purpose of pop. And the labels, after years of focusing almost exclusively on the single, recognized this bigger bundle could make them a lot more money. By the end of the 1970s, however, the album was struggling. Under pressure to produce enough content to fill two long sides, the quality had crashed and newer genres (Disco, Punk, Hip-Hop) had gravitated back to shorter formats. A cash cow was in jeopardy. The answer? CDs. For a while it worked very very well. The new bundle was less expensive to make but the labels were able to charge more for it. People even bought CDs to replace their vinyl favorites. Happy days, for the industry, were here again.\n\n*But then came file-sharing.* \n\nMusic fans had been ‘stealing’ and sharing music, of course, since the creation of the Philips home cassette recorder in the 1960s. Entire cultures, like Deadheads, grew up around the swapping of prized recordings. Mixtape making became a passion for millions of fans. But it had never been a threat to the industry before. By 2001, the ever-increasing cost of CDs, the low killer/filler ratio of the bundle, and the superpowers of the Internet coincided to create the perfect storm. \n\nSuperfans took desires into their own hands. If they weren’t able to buy and trade music the way they wanted, they were going to take control of both the pricing and experience. This revolution changed the fan and artist relationship as we knew it, forcing an industry stuck on its laurels and business models into the internet age. It was chaotic, near fatal, and left much of the businesses history up to that point in its wake. But it forced an entirely new business around relationships and IP and evolved to a model that was a creative unlock for fans, labels and artists alike leading to an eventual restabilization. \n\nNapster was just an early first step in the move towards the new creator to fan model but it was the moment where the industry admitted that the audience is ultimately in control. IP could be adjusted, manipulated and remixed. It ushered in a new age.\n\nAcross media, this technologically mediated process has led to the unbundling, rebundling, remixing and then reintegration of content and IP. Traditionally, IP has been a one way process; a creator of IP licenses to another party and it goes down the assembly line. But thanks to technology that’s changed. Today media is increasingly dominated by decentralized IP that takes a different approach, one that presents a multi-directional relationship between fan and creator. And when we talk about remixing, it’s not just about re-imagining third-party material. It’s about creating entirely new work. \n\n***These Are The Good Times***\n\nThere’s no precise moment to mark the beginning of the remix era. But it’s important to recognize that one reason shorter form vinyl came back into popularity by the end of the 1970s was not only because the album had become a bloated mess of throwaway tracks; it was because club DJs had figured out how to take R&B songs and make them into something amazing. And they did it live. They played songs with great hooks, and to keep their audiences dancing and happy, figured out how to use the turntable to drop back and keep the party going. This wasn’t a new song exactly, but it was a longer version of it. \n\nPretty soon, labels who wanted their artists promoted in discos came out with special versions of songs with longer dance sections, or breakdowns. This led directly into the next innovation, the seamless merging of one song with the one that followed. The aim was to never let the dance floor get empty. So the best figured out how to time the transition just right such that it created one continuous flow of melody. There would be this wonderful moment at the merging point where the two songs played over each other, making something recognizable and yet novel. Rap emcees added one more layer on top, taking the Jamaican toasting style and James Brownian braggadociousness, now creating something lyrical and truly original. \n\nIt’s probably not an accident that the musical breakthrough of hip hop resembled the layered effect of New York graffiti, a palimpsest of different artists adding their own signature contributions. Not quite as criminal as tagging subway cars, but it existed outside the law. Not that anybody cared at first. The first recorded rap songs were cassettes sold on street corners and out of car trunks. But eventually their popularity was too big for the gray market and crews put out real records. And promptly got sued. Probably the most famous early example was ‘Rapper’s Delight.’ Layering their infectious phrases over a barely modified Nile Rodgers’ baseline, the Sugarhill Gang scored the first ever Billboard Hot 100 hip hop hit. Once Chic’s lawyers got involved, Nile and his partner Bernard Edwards were added as songwriters and the rest is musical history. Forty years later, hip hop is arguably the most popular genre in the world, and it’s all based on sampling. \n\n***On the Internet nobody knows you’re a blog***\n\nA similar remix process happened to news and written content more broadly. Now that newspapers and magazines had been unbundled on the Web, they, like singles in music, could be harvested for the creation of something new and created by end-users. \n\n‘User-created content,’ of course, is as old as the Internet, which was designed by and around research institutions with no inherent sense of professional versus amateur content. Anyone who had an account with access was a potential publisher. Creators took advantage of the freedom of the early Internet to write and share content on subjects they loved. Usenet and Gopher directories were bursting with original commentary and reviews of favorite shows and books, like Lord of the Rings, Dune and Star Trek. And the most original aspect of this geek creativity was fanfic, unauthorized new stories featuring beloved characters, often in transgressive romantic situations. \n\nThen came the Web, and for a while, the graphical/visual flavor of this new UX helped reassert the dominance of professional publishers. In the late 90s, every newspaper rushed to build websites and make distribution deals. Offline titles with their logos and photos, organized into the channels of ‘portals,’ all festooned with branded banners, seemed like a new normal. User-creators were herded into message boards, chat rooms and community features, below the fold, away from the ads. The professional content was the star of the show.\n\nBut it didn’t last long. The bubble popped, the portals crashed and the bottom-up energy of the Usenet came roaring back under the rubric of Web 2.0. It was a whole constellation of new technologies and ideologies but they crystallized in the concept of the weblog. \n\nBlogs began as a kind of online public diary — hence the name — but fairly soon, the most common purpose was public commentary, typically written around quotes from and links to news articles. Some blogs, like the Drudge Report, were like alternative versions of a newspaper front page, with the blogger playing the role of the front page editor, picking the most important stories from across the Web and rewriting the headlines. Others blogs would take one news article and deconstruct it, annotating and criticizing. All this was made possible, needless to say, because all those professional publishers had unbundled their content, at that time rarely behind subscription walls or even registration, directly on the Web. There was free and easy access to the underlying raw material. Blogs were remixing it and each other with captivating results. \n\nWe all know what happened next. The open APIs and protocols of blogging were swallowed up by the increasingly closed but increasingly viral feeds of social networks. Entirely new forms of visual communication, memes, with unique styles of humor and patterns of layered remixing, thrived, reaching millions within minutes, driving ‘engagement.’ What had been unbundled and remixed had suddenly become bundled again. Inside these massive algorithmic systems, creators were more powerful than ever and yet curiously also powerless. Publishers faced the same sort of dilemma. Without the amplification of the remixing influencers (as they came to be called), the media companies got no amplification. But all the unbundled content they pumped in only made the social networks stronger. We’ve been dealing with the consequences and ramifications on our cultural, political and social lives ever since. And it’s only accelerating. \n\n***The TikTokification of IP***\n\nSimilar to the music business in the hip hop era, it’s increasingly hard for today’s media companies to absolutely prevent developers, creators, fans and consumers from building on top of their IP. This is not new, and anyone walking through Times Square in Manhattan knows that Bumblebee or The Minions will work tirelessly to latch on to you, grab a selfie and chase you down for $10. More broadly, major media hits have long been remixed versions of existing IP. This has been happening in the games industry for decades where every major hit, from Counterstrike, to Fortnite, to League of Legends has been a user generated mod of an existing popular game and IP. But while it isn’t new, the pace of remixing is increasing, and the practical control IP owners have over their works is slipping and the social acceptance and in fact critical importance of remixing is only rising exponentially. \n\nLook no further than the rise of Tiktok. TikTok is the most important social network today for shaping culture and it is largely powered by a mass market remixing system unlike any we’ve ever had. In many respects, TikTok is the inevitable and natural conclusion of the memfication and socialization of content. If the medium is the message, then IP is the ink with which it's written. Users react, recreate, remix and redefine any and all IP in a massive algorithmically driven social experiment designed to take existing ideas, content, and formats, mash them together perhaps with a bit of something new, throw them at the wall, and see what sticks, only to scrape up what does and start the whole process over again.\n\nOf course the tiktokification of IP is happening everywhere. Its happening on Roblox with respect to games and virtual experiences, its happening on soundcloud with respect to music, its happening on Wattpad with respect to text. The catalyst for an industry to move from one-way to two-way IP relationships is the emergence of tooling that lowers the barrier of entry to engage with the IP itself. Like the shift from newspapers to social networks, today’s IP is evolving from community engagement and consumption to community creation and development. \n\n***A generation of reintegration***\n\nOne important way this is likely to happen now is NFTs.

The first recorded rap songs were cassettes sold on street corners and out of car trunks. But eventually their popularity was too big for the gray market and crews put out real records. And promptly got sued. Probably the most famous early example was ‘Rapper’s Delight.’ Layering their infectious phrases over a barely modified Nile Rodgers’ baseline, the Sugarhill Gang scored the first ever Billboard Hot 100 hip hop hit. Once Chic’s lawyers got involved, Nile and his partner Bernard Edwards were added as songwriters and the rest is musical history. Forty years later, hip hop is arguably the most popular genre in the world, and it’s all based on sampling. \n\n***On the Internet nobody knows you’re a blog***\n\nA similar remix process happened to news and written content more broadly. Now that newspapers and magazines had been unbundled on the Web, they, like singles in music, could be harvested for the creation of something new and created by end-users. \n\n‘User-created content,’ of course, is as old as the Internet, which was designed by and around research institutions with no inherent sense of professional versus amateur content. Anyone who had an account with access was a potential publisher. Creators took advantage of the freedom of the early Internet to write and share content on subjects they loved. Usenet and Gopher directories were bursting with original commentary and reviews of favorite shows and books, like Lord of the Rings, Dune and Star Trek. And the most original aspect of this geek creativity was fanfic, unauthorized new stories featuring beloved characters, often in transgressive romantic situations. \n\nThen came the Web, and for a while, the graphical/visual flavor of this new UX helped reassert the dominance of professional publishers. In the late 90s, every newspaper rushed to build websites and make distribution deals. Offline titles with their logos and photos, organized into the channels of ‘portals,’ all festooned with branded banners, seemed like a new normal. User-creators were herded into message boards, chat rooms and community features, below the fold, away from the ads. The professional content was the star of the show.\n\nBut it didn’t last long. The bubble popped, the portals crashed and the bottom-up energy of the Usenet came roaring back under the rubric of Web 2.0. It was a whole constellation of new technologies and ideologies but they crystallized in the concept of the weblog. \n\nBlogs began as a kind of online public diary — hence the name — but fairly soon, the most common purpose was public commentary, typically written around quotes from and links to news articles. Some blogs, like the Drudge Report, were like alternative versions of a newspaper front page, with the blogger playing the role of the front page editor, picking the most important stories from across the Web and rewriting the headlines. Others blogs would take one news article and deconstruct it, annotating and criticizing. All this was made possible, needless to say, because all those professional publishers had unbundled their content, at that time rarely behind subscription walls or even registration, directly on the Web. There was free and easy access to the underlying raw material. Blogs were remixing it and each other with captivating results. \n\nWe all know what happened next. The open APIs and protocols of blogging were swallowed up by the increasingly closed but increasingly viral feeds of social networks. Entirely new forms of visual communication, memes, with unique styles of humor and patterns of layered remixing, thrived, reaching millions within minutes, driving ‘engagement.’ What had been unbundled and remixed had suddenly become bundled again. Inside these massive algorithmic systems, creators were more powerful than ever and yet curiously also powerless. Publishers faced the same sort of dilemma. Without the amplification of the remixing influencers (as they came to be called), the media companies got no amplification. But all the unbundled content they pumped in only made the social networks stronger. We’ve been dealing with the consequences and ramifications on our cultural, political and social lives ever since. And it’s only accelerating. \n\n***The TikTokification of IP***\n\nSimilar to the music business in the hip hop era, it’s increasingly hard for today’s media companies to absolutely prevent developers, creators, fans and consumers from building on top of their IP. This is not new, and anyone walking through Times Square in Manhattan knows that Bumblebee or The Minions will work tirelessly to latch on to you, grab a selfie and chase you down for $10. More broadly, major media hits have long been remixed versions of existing IP. This has been happening in the games industry for decades where every major hit, from Counterstrike, to Fortnite, to League of Legends has been a user generated mod of an existing popular game and IP. But while it isn’t new, the pace of remixing is increasing, and the practical control IP owners have over their works is slipping and the social acceptance and in fact critical importance of remixing is only rising exponentially. \n\nLook no further than the rise of Tiktok. TikTok is the most important social network today for shaping culture and it is largely powered by a mass market remixing system unlike any we’ve ever had. In many respects, TikTok is the inevitable and natural conclusion of the memfication and socialization of content. If the medium is the message, then IP is the ink with which it's written. Users react, recreate, remix and redefine any and all IP in a massive algorithmically driven social experiment designed to take existing ideas, content, and formats, mash them together perhaps with a bit of something new, throw them at the wall, and see what sticks, only to scrape up what does and start the whole process over again.\n\nOf course the tiktokification of IP is happening everywhere. Its happening on Roblox with respect to games and virtual experiences, its happening on soundcloud with respect to music, its happening on Wattpad with respect to text. The catalyst for an industry to move from one-way to two-way IP relationships is the emergence of tooling that lowers the barrier of entry to engage with the IP itself. Like the shift from newspapers to social networks, today’s IP is evolving from community engagement and consumption to community creation and development. \n\n***A generation of reintegration***\n\nOne important way this is likely to happen now is NFTs. Over the next several years, it’s probable that every media company who owns popular characters, worlds and brands is going to enable users to collect these individual unbundled assets by owning them as tokens. The driving motivation for these IP businesses is not a preference for unbundling, of course. Like every other profit-maximizing organization, they understand the value of forcing customers to buy a larger package. But creative companies are operating within a media landscape that is dominated by a small number of even bigger bundlers, the social networks, streaming platforms and app stores. On all sides, opportunities for direct relationships with and uncapped revenue from end-users are drying up. In this context, the possibilities offered by NFTs are tantalizing: a near zero-cost product that can be sold and re-sold, perhaps for a considerable amount, without any disintermediation. And on the surface, it’s a model that looks almost exactly like merchandising, a business they know well.\n\nBut, as we’ve seen over and over again, regardless of why unbundling occurs, whether because consumers force it or producers embrace it (and it’s usually a combination), one result will always be remixing. When the atom of IP gets smaller and easier to handle, creative recombination -- a new molecule! -- becomes inevitable. And NFTs, like all blockchain elements and assets, are designed to be combined. So we’re heading towards another perfect storm: unbundled popular IP, issues as composable media ‘legos,’ in the hands of millions of creative people armed with powerful computers (phones) and distribution.\n\nLike other remix moments, IP owners will be faced with a challenge. Their cultural tendencies are still rooted in the industrial past. Their strong preference is to control the entire process, from idea to franchise. Indeed, many of the media forms which generate the greatest profits (movies, video games and theme parks) require years of careful planning and control. Despite everything they’ve seen over the past 50 years, IP owners are unprepared. Some will sue. They will add scary terms (‘copyfright’) to the sales of their NFTs and send out cease-and-desist letters, especially when the new combinations start making money for their creators. Some will be tolerant, watching quietly from the sidelines, perhaps fearful of fan backlash. Still others will be excited cheerleaders, tweeting out cool and amusing examples of their stuff remixed. \n\nThe greatest opportunity is one big step beyond any of these tactics: **reintegration**. The logical end to industrial media, the creative mode finally enabled by the blockchain, is a dynamic system where the remix continuously flows back into the source material. Is this practically possible? Could there ever be a version of the Star Wars Universe, for example, where stories or games that were created by fans, depicted or played using NFTs, were embraced and included within the canon? How would decisions of what to include be made, and by whom? And perhaps most importantly, could the creators of these remixes be rewarded for their contributions? \n\nThe winners of the next media era will have answers to these questions. \n\n***So where does that leave IP?***\n\nAs platforms emerge to enable creators to better construct, remix and monetize new IP, brands and creators need to make a decision as to whether to give access to creative development or to make creative development “hackable”. In the case of Napster, the industry overlooked the power of digital and instead of structuring a business in the internet age, fans hacked the early prototypes that would be consumer downloads and streaming for the music business to then take and build sophistication onto afterwards. In the case of TikTok, these tools are provided as part of the platform; consumers are creators and are encouraged to compound value on top of each other’s IP in order to make it more engaging, more participatory. This is increasingly the same for gaming and other industries that have recognized the value of removing the barriers of fan and creator and seeing the value of encouraging others to build on top of their IP. \n\nThe larger question about NFTs and media is how they will inevitably be used by ‘collectors’ to make new versions of storyworlds, a process which then presents the IP owner with the problem of how to consider those new creations. Should they be ignored? Tolerated? Or celebrated and integrated? It’s a challenge that is not going away. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2e26334e-b039-40e6-a225-571d57b9d9fa.png?height=607&width=587)\n\nThe process of bundle, unbundle, remix, reintegration isn’t linear. The disruption of industrial models doesn’t completely leave the existing platforms, creators and IP in its wake, it just moves them to either adjust or forfeit existing control. If we are moving towards a more accelerated remix culture, IP owners will need to decide whether to cede ground to fans, community members and other artists or adjust their existing value proposition. The tension is already there.\n\nMaybe the next generation of media mindset is being able to bring together all of this creativity and move it towards something? Or rethinking the way franchises develop and bridge relationships with fans in the forms of DAOs or other participation structures? Maybe the more things change the more they stay the same?\n\nThere are many questions. But here’s what we do know. IP is moving from one way to two way creation and consumption. Technology is making every content format developable and by making a genre \"developable\", it supercharges the two way IP model. When access becomes available to more than just experts, it starts to make the consumer more important than the creator and open season for remixing. As such franchises and content in general are already governed by fans, even if IP holders don't acknowledge it. \n\nTo be successful in this new world, IP holders will need to adjust and focus less on control and more on managing chaos. The new media model will employ a mindset of being able to take all of this creativity and move it towards something completely new, leveraging the systems and skills to listen, integrate, celebrate and put periphery into the center of its work. As remixing becomes increasingly accepted and encouraged as an art form, and product strategies congregate around platforms built for its reintegration, the decision to open up IP must be embraced by the creators themselves or it will be imposed by their audiences. The same way it always has been. \n", "timestamp": 1626793691, "digest": "seA6j67Jc0mm8vqGe1zTuXC7O0h95XlmazSQXDlrd24", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

This process had started with print, initially in the United Kingdom, and led to the massive successes of the newspaper and publishing industries. This same approach was applied to film, leading to the Hollywood studio system, which consciously employed the same production line framework as Ford's Detroit plants. So too did music become a production-oriented industry. Tin Pan Alley and the famous Brill Building were factories of culture, churning out songs, which would be paired with artists, recorded and pressed for distribution.\n\nThe heart of this transformation was the realization that there were economies of scale that, especially when coupled with the protections of copyright, could generate attractive profits for shareholders. The media company would have knowledge of its customer, through the new science of market research. This insight would be used to develop products that the market would desire. The products would be produced as efficiently as possible, pushing talent to create new work on budget and schedule.\n\nUsing the growing power of the media and its advertising complement, marketing departments would endeavor to turn products into hits, and hits into sequels, series and ongoing successes. The experience was delivered and defined by the industries directly, with a clear line of responsibilities-- and influence -- flowing from the creators to consumers. This taxonomy of roles gave a lot of power to the producers, who monopolized both development and delivery of goods across all industries.\n\nThen came the Internet, and the first casualty of industrial-era media was the same sector that started it: *newspapers*. Newspapers got unbundled, which deconstructed their core business units and then remixing began. But instead of newspapers reintegrating the value into their business, challengers emerged by way of social networks and reintegrated an environment that spun away from industrial control, built on community created content. \n\n> This provided the blueprint of remixed culture; industry bundles, unbundled by business, remixed by community and reintegrated into new mediums of exchange.\n\nBut let’s bring it back one time.\n\nOver the centuries of its steady growth, publishing had realized the way to maximize revenues was to include as much as possible within its ‘package.’ For ad-based titles, that meant bundling in as much advertising of as many kinds as possible: display, coupons, fliers, classifieds. That’s how we got editions of Vogue that weighed over five pounds and runs of the Sunday New York Times with so many inserts it needed to be wrapped in plastic. But publishing on the Web made it possible to ignore all that paid content. A reader could come to a story through a link and, apart from a few banners, never even encounter the classifieds. Worse, other pureplay startups were actually better at rebundling in advertising than the publishers.\n\n*Music was next.*\n\nThe seeds were planted in the mid-1960s with the creation of the Long Play (LP). With this new technology, artists suddenly had a much broader canvas on which they could ‘paint’ their musical ideas. The most ambitious acts realized the potential and almost overnight transformed the purpose of pop. And the labels, after years of focusing almost exclusively on the single, recognized this bigger bundle could make them a lot more money. By the end of the 1970s, however, the album was struggling. Under pressure to produce enough content to fill two long sides, the quality had crashed and newer genres (Disco, Punk, Hip-Hop) had gravitated back to shorter formats. A cash cow was in jeopardy. The answer? CDs. For a while it worked very very well. The new bundle was less expensive to make but the labels were able to charge more for it. People even bought CDs to replace their vinyl favorites. Happy days, for the industry, were here again.\n\n*But then came file-sharing.* \n\nMusic fans had been ‘stealing’ and sharing music, of course, since the creation of the Philips home cassette recorder in the 1960s. Entire cultures, like Deadheads, grew up around the swapping of prized recordings. Mixtape making became a passion for millions of fans. But it had never been a threat to the industry before. By 2001, the ever-increasing cost of CDs, the low killer/filler ratio of the bundle, and the superpowers of the Internet coincided to create the perfect storm. \n\nSuperfans took desires into their own hands. If they weren’t able to buy and trade music the way they wanted, they were going to take control of both the pricing and experience. This revolution changed the fan and artist relationship as we knew it, forcing an industry stuck on its laurels and business models into the internet age. It was chaotic, near fatal, and left much of the businesses history up to that point in its wake. But it forced an entirely new business around relationships and IP and evolved to a model that was a creative unlock for fans, labels and artists alike leading to an eventual restabilization. \n\nNapster was just an early first step in the move towards the new creator to fan model but it was the moment where the industry admitted that the audience is ultimately in control. IP could be adjusted, manipulated and remixed. It ushered in a new age.\n\nAcross media, this technologically mediated process has led to the unbundling, rebundling, remixing and then reintegration of content and IP. Traditionally, IP has been a one way process; a creator of IP licenses to another party and it goes down the assembly line. But thanks to technology that’s changed. Today media is increasingly dominated by decentralized IP that takes a different approach, one that presents a multi-directional relationship between fan and creator. And when we talk about remixing, it’s not just about re-imagining third-party material. It’s about creating entirely new work. \n\n***These Are The Good Times***\n\nThere’s no precise moment to mark the beginning of the remix era. But it’s important to recognize that one reason shorter form vinyl came back into popularity by the end of the 1970s was not only because the album had become a bloated mess of throwaway tracks; it was because club DJs had figured out how to take R&B songs and make them into something amazing. And they did it live. They played songs with great hooks, and to keep their audiences dancing and happy, figured out how to use the turntable to drop back and keep the party going. This wasn’t a new song exactly, but it was a longer version of it. \n\nPretty soon, labels who wanted their artists promoted in discos came out with special versions of songs with longer dance sections, or breakdowns. This led directly into the next innovation, the seamless merging of one song with the one that followed. The aim was to never let the dance floor get empty. So the best figured out how to time the transition just right such that it created one continuous flow of melody. There would be this wonderful moment at the merging point where the two songs played over each other, making something recognizable and yet novel. Rap emcees added one more layer on top, taking the Jamaican toasting style and James Brownian braggadociousness, now creating something lyrical and truly original. \n\nIt’s probably not an accident that the musical breakthrough of hip hop resembled the layered effect of New York graffiti, a palimpsest of different artists adding their own signature contributions. Not quite as criminal as tagging subway cars, but it existed outside the law. Not that anybody cared at first. The first recorded rap songs were cassettes sold on street corners and out of car trunks. But eventually their popularity was too big for the gray market and crews put out real records.

This taxonomy of roles gave a lot of power to the producers, who monopolized both development and delivery of goods across all industries.\n\nThen came the Internet, and the first casualty of industrial-era media was the same sector that started it: *newspapers*. Newspapers got unbundled, which deconstructed their core business units and then remixing began. But instead of newspapers reintegrating the value into their business, challengers emerged by way of social networks and reintegrated an environment that spun away from industrial control, built on community created content. \n\n> This provided the blueprint of remixed culture; industry bundles, unbundled by business, remixed by community and reintegrated into new mediums of exchange.\n\nBut let’s bring it back one time.\n\nOver the centuries of its steady growth, publishing had realized the way to maximize revenues was to include as much as possible within its ‘package.’ For ad-based titles, that meant bundling in as much advertising of as many kinds as possible: display, coupons, fliers, classifieds. That’s how we got editions of Vogue that weighed over five pounds and runs of the Sunday New York Times with so many inserts it needed to be wrapped in plastic. But publishing on the Web made it possible to ignore all that paid content. A reader could come to a story through a link and, apart from a few banners, never even encounter the classifieds. Worse, other pureplay startups were actually better at rebundling in advertising than the publishers.\n\n*Music was next.*\n\nThe seeds were planted in the mid-1960s with the creation of the Long Play (LP). With this new technology, artists suddenly had a much broader canvas on which they could ‘paint’ their musical ideas. The most ambitious acts realized the potential and almost overnight transformed the purpose of pop. And the labels, after years of focusing almost exclusively on the single, recognized this bigger bundle could make them a lot more money. By the end of the 1970s, however, the album was struggling. Under pressure to produce enough content to fill two long sides, the quality had crashed and newer genres (Disco, Punk, Hip-Hop) had gravitated back to shorter formats. A cash cow was in jeopardy. The answer? CDs. For a while it worked very very well. The new bundle was less expensive to make but the labels were able to charge more for it. People even bought CDs to replace their vinyl favorites. Happy days, for the industry, were here again.\n\n*But then came file-sharing.* \n\nMusic fans had been ‘stealing’ and sharing music, of course, since the creation of the Philips home cassette recorder in the 1960s. Entire cultures, like Deadheads, grew up around the swapping of prized recordings. Mixtape making became a passion for millions of fans. But it had never been a threat to the industry before. By 2001, the ever-increasing cost of CDs, the low killer/filler ratio of the bundle, and the superpowers of the Internet coincided to create the perfect storm. \n\nSuperfans took desires into their own hands. If they weren’t able to buy and trade music the way they wanted, they were going to take control of both the pricing and experience. This revolution changed the fan and artist relationship as we knew it, forcing an industry stuck on its laurels and business models into the internet age. It was chaotic, near fatal, and left much of the businesses history up to that point in its wake. But it forced an entirely new business around relationships and IP and evolved to a model that was a creative unlock for fans, labels and artists alike leading to an eventual restabilization. \n\nNapster was just an early first step in the move towards the new creator to fan model but it was the moment where the industry admitted that the audience is ultimately in control. IP could be adjusted, manipulated and remixed. It ushered in a new age.\n\nAcross media, this technologically mediated process has led to the unbundling, rebundling, remixing and then reintegration of content and IP. Traditionally, IP has been a one way process; a creator of IP licenses to another party and it goes down the assembly line. But thanks to technology that’s changed. Today media is increasingly dominated by decentralized IP that takes a different approach, one that presents a multi-directional relationship between fan and creator. And when we talk about remixing, it’s not just about re-imagining third-party material. It’s about creating entirely new work. \n\n***These Are The Good Times***\n\nThere’s no precise moment to mark the beginning of the remix era. But it’s important to recognize that one reason shorter form vinyl came back into popularity by the end of the 1970s was not only because the album had become a bloated mess of throwaway tracks; it was because club DJs had figured out how to take R&B songs and make them into something amazing. And they did it live. They played songs with great hooks, and to keep their audiences dancing and happy, figured out how to use the turntable to drop back and keep the party going. This wasn’t a new song exactly, but it was a longer version of it. \n\nPretty soon, labels who wanted their artists promoted in discos came out with special versions of songs with longer dance sections, or breakdowns. This led directly into the next innovation, the seamless merging of one song with the one that followed. The aim was to never let the dance floor get empty. So the best figured out how to time the transition just right such that it created one continuous flow of melody. There would be this wonderful moment at the merging point where the two songs played over each other, making something recognizable and yet novel. Rap emcees added one more layer on top, taking the Jamaican toasting style and James Brownian braggadociousness, now creating something lyrical and truly original. \n\nIt’s probably not an accident that the musical breakthrough of hip hop resembled the layered effect of New York graffiti, a palimpsest of different artists adding their own signature contributions. Not quite as criminal as tagging subway cars, but it existed outside the law. Not that anybody cared at first. The first recorded rap songs were cassettes sold on street corners and out of car trunks. But eventually their popularity was too big for the gray market and crews put out real records. And promptly got sued. Probably the most famous early example was ‘Rapper’s Delight.’ Layering their infectious phrases over a barely modified Nile Rodgers’ baseline, the Sugarhill Gang scored the first ever Billboard Hot 100 hip hop hit. Once Chic’s lawyers got involved, Nile and his partner Bernard Edwards were added as songwriters and the rest is musical history. Forty years later, hip hop is arguably the most popular genre in the world, and it’s all based on sampling. \n\n***On the Internet nobody knows you’re a blog***\n\nA similar remix process happened to news and written content more broadly. Now that newspapers and magazines had been unbundled on the Web, they, like singles in music, could be harvested for the creation of something new and created by end-users. \n\n‘User-created content,’ of course, is as old as the Internet, which was designed by and around research institutions with no inherent sense of professional versus amateur content. Anyone who had an account with access was a potential publisher. Creators took advantage of the freedom of the early Internet to write and share content on subjects they loved. Usenet and Gopher directories were bursting with original commentary and reviews of favorite shows and books, like Lord of the Rings, Dune and Star Trek. And the most original aspect of this geek creativity was fanfic, unauthorized new stories featuring beloved characters, often in transgressive romantic situations. \n\nThen came the Web, and for a while, the graphical/visual flavor of this new UX helped reassert the dominance of professional publishers. In the late 90s, every newspaper rushed to build websites and make distribution deals. Offline titles with their logos and photos, organized into the channels of ‘portals,’ all festooned with branded banners, seemed like a new normal. User-creators were herded into message boards, chat rooms and community features, below the fold, away from the ads. The professional content was the star of the show.\n\nBut it didn’t last long. The bubble popped, the portals crashed and the bottom-up energy of the Usenet came roaring back under the rubric of Web 2.0. It was a whole constellation of new technologies and ideologies but they crystallized in the concept of the weblog. \n\nBlogs began as a kind of online public diary — hence the name — but fairly soon, the most common purpose was public commentary, typically written around quotes from and links to news articles. Some blogs, like the Drudge Report, were like alternative versions of a newspaper front page, with the blogger playing the role of the front page editor, picking the most important stories from across the Web and rewriting the headlines. Others blogs would take one news article and deconstruct it, annotating and criticizing. All this was made possible, needless to say, because all those professional publishers had unbundled their content, at that time rarely behind subscription walls or even registration, directly on the Web. There was free and easy access to the underlying raw material. Blogs were remixing it and each other with captivating results. \n\nWe all know what happened next. The open APIs and protocols of blogging were swallowed up by the increasingly closed but increasingly viral feeds of social networks. Entirely new forms of visual communication, memes, with unique styles of humor and patterns of layered remixing, thrived, reaching millions within minutes, driving ‘engagement.’ What had been unbundled and remixed had suddenly become bundled again. Inside these massive algorithmic systems, creators were more powerful than ever and yet curiously also powerless. Publishers faced the same sort of dilemma. Without the amplification of the remixing influencers (as they came to be called), the media companies got no amplification. But all the unbundled content they pumped in only made the social networks stronger. We’ve been dealing with the consequences and ramifications on our cultural, political and social lives ever since. And it’s only accelerating. \n\n***The TikTokification of IP***\n\nSimilar to the music business in the hip hop era, it’s increasingly hard for today’s media companies to absolutely prevent developers, creators, fans and consumers from building on top of their IP. This is not new, and anyone walking through Times Square in Manhattan knows that Bumblebee or The Minions will work tirelessly to latch on to you, grab a selfie and chase you down for $10. More broadly, major media hits have long been remixed versions of existing IP. This has been happening in the games industry for decades where every major hit, from Counterstrike, to Fortnite, to League of Legends has been a user generated mod of an existing popular game and IP. But while it isn’t new, the pace of remixing is increasing, and the practical control IP owners have over their works is slipping and the social acceptance and in fact critical importance of remixing is only rising exponentially. \n\nLook no further than the rise of Tiktok. TikTok is the most important social network today for shaping culture and it is largely powered by a mass market remixing system unlike any we’ve ever had. In many respects, TikTok is the inevitable and natural conclusion of the memfication and socialization of content. If the medium is the message, then IP is the ink with which it's written. Users react, recreate, remix and redefine any and all IP in a massive algorithmically driven social experiment designed to take existing ideas, content, and formats, mash them together perhaps with a bit of something new, throw them at the wall, and see what sticks, only to scrape up what does and start the whole process over again.\n\nOf course the tiktokification of IP is happening everywhere. Its happening on Roblox with respect to games and virtual experiences, its happening on soundcloud with respect to music, its happening on Wattpad with respect to text. The catalyst for an industry to move from one-way to two-way IP relationships is the emergence of tooling that lowers the barrier of entry to engage with the IP itself. Like the shift from newspapers to social networks, today’s IP is evolving from community engagement and consumption to community creation and development. \n\n***A generation of reintegration***\n\nOne important way this is likely to happen now is NFTs. Over the next several years, it’s probable that every media company who owns popular characters, worlds and brands is going to enable users to collect these individual unbundled assets by owning them as tokens. The driving motivation for these IP businesses is not a preference for unbundling, of course. Like every other profit-maximizing organization, they understand the value of forcing customers to buy a larger package. But creative companies are operating within a media landscape that is dominated by a small number of even bigger bundlers, the social networks, streaming platforms and app stores. On all sides, opportunities for direct relationships with and uncapped revenue from end-users are drying up. In this context, the possibilities offered by NFTs are tantalizing: a near zero-cost product that can be sold and re-sold, perhaps for a considerable amount, without any disintermediation. And on the surface, it’s a model that looks almost exactly like merchandising, a business they know well.\n\nBut, as we’ve seen over and over again, regardless of why unbundling occurs, whether because consumers force it or producers embrace it (and it’s usually a combination), one result will always be remixing. When the atom of IP gets smaller and easier to handle, creative recombination -- a new molecule! -- becomes inevitable. And NFTs, like all blockchain elements and assets, are designed to be combined. So we’re heading towards another perfect storm: unbundled popular IP, issues as composable media ‘legos,’ in the hands of millions of creative people armed with powerful computers (phones) and distribution.\n\nLike other remix moments, IP owners will be faced with a challenge. Their cultural tendencies are still rooted in the industrial past. Their strong preference is to control the entire process, from idea to franchise. Indeed, many of the media forms which generate the greatest profits (movies, video games and theme parks) require years of careful planning and control. Despite everything they’ve seen over the past 50 years, IP owners are unprepared. Some will sue. They will add scary terms (‘copyfright’) to the sales of their NFTs and send out cease-and-desist letters, especially when the new combinations start making money for their creators. Some will be tolerant, watching quietly from the sidelines, perhaps fearful of fan backlash. Still others will be excited cheerleaders, tweeting out cool and amusing examples of their stuff remixed. \n\nThe greatest opportunity is one big step beyond any of these tactics: **reintegration**. The logical end to industrial media, the creative mode finally enabled by the blockchain, is a dynamic system where the remix continuously flows back into the source material. Is this practically possible? Could there ever be a version of the Star Wars Universe, for example, where stories or games that were created by fans, depicted or played using NFTs, were embraced and included within the canon? How would decisions of what to include be made, and by whom? And perhaps most importantly, could the creators of these remixes be rewarded for their contributions? \n\nThe winners of the next media era will have answers to these questions. \n\n***So where does that leave IP?***\n\nAs platforms emerge to enable creators to better construct, remix and monetize new IP, brands and creators need to make a decision as to whether to give access to creative development or to make creative development “hackable”. In the case of Napster, the industry overlooked the power of digital and instead of structuring a business in the internet age, fans hacked the early prototypes that would be consumer downloads and streaming for the music business to then take and build sophistication onto afterwards. In the case of TikTok, these tools are provided as part of the platform; consumers are creators and are encouraged to compound value on top of each other’s IP in order to make it more engaging, more participatory. This is increasingly the same for gaming and other industries that have recognized the value of removing the barriers of fan and creator and seeing the value of encouraging others to build on top of their IP. \n\nThe larger question about NFTs and media is how they will inevitably be used by ‘collectors’ to make new versions of storyworlds, a process which then presents the IP owner with the problem of how to consider those new creations. Should they be ignored? Tolerated? Or celebrated and integrated? It’s a challenge that is not going away. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2e26334e-b039-40e6-a225-571d57b9d9fa.png?height=607&width=587)\n\nThe process of bundle, unbundle, remix, reintegration isn’t linear. The disruption of industrial models doesn’t completely leave the existing platforms, creators and IP in its wake, it just moves them to either adjust or forfeit existing control. If we are moving towards a more accelerated remix culture, IP owners will need to decide whether to cede ground to fans, community members and other artists or adjust their existing value proposition. The tension is already there.\n\nMaybe the next generation of media mindset is being able to bring together all of this creativity and move it towards something? Or rethinking the way franchises develop and bridge relationships with fans in the forms of DAOs or other participation structures? Maybe the more things change the more they stay the same?\n\nThere are many questions. But here’s what we do know. IP is moving from one way to two way creation and consumption. Technology is making every content format developable and by making a genre \"developable\", it supercharges the two way IP model. When access becomes available to more than just experts, it starts to make the consumer more important than the creator and open season for remixing. As such franchises and content in general are already governed by fans, even if IP holders don't acknowledge it. \n\nTo be successful in this new world, IP holders will need to adjust and focus less on control and more on managing chaos. The new media model will employ a mindset of being able to take all of this creativity and move it towards something completely new, leveraging the systems and skills to listen, integrate, celebrate and put periphery into the center of its work. As remixing becomes increasingly accepted and encouraged as an art form, and product strategies congregate around platforms built for its reintegration, the decision to open up IP must be embraced by the creators themselves or it will be imposed by their audiences. The same way it always has been. \n", "timestamp": 1626793716, "digest": "seA6j67Jc0mm8vqGe1zTuXC7O0h95XlmazSQXDlrd24", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

This process had started with print, initially in the United Kingdom, and led to the massive successes of the newspaper and publishing industries. This same approach was applied to film, leading to the Hollywood studio system, which consciously employed the same production line framework as Ford's Detroit plants. So too did music become a production-oriented industry. Tin Pan Alley and the famous Brill Building were factories of culture, churning out songs, which would be paired with artists, recorded and pressed for distribution.\n\nThe heart of this transformation was the realization that there were economies of scale that, especially when coupled with the protections of copyright, could generate attractive profits for shareholders. The media company would have knowledge of its customer, through the new science of market research. This insight would be used to develop products that the market would desire. The products would be produced as efficiently as possible, pushing talent to create new work on budget and schedule.\n\nUsing the growing power of the media and its advertising complement, marketing departments would endeavor to turn products into hits, and hits into sequels, series and ongoing successes.

So we’re heading towards another perfect storm: unbundled popular IP, issues as composable media ‘legos,’ in the hands of millions of creative people armed with powerful computers (phones) and distribution.\n\nLike other remix moments, IP owners will be faced with a challenge. Their cultural tendencies are still rooted in the industrial past. Their strong preference is to control the entire process, from idea to franchise. Indeed, many of the media forms which generate the greatest profits (movies, video games and theme parks) require years of careful planning and control. Despite everything they’ve seen over the past 50 years, IP owners are unprepared. Some will sue. They will add scary terms (‘copyfright’) to the sales of their NFTs and send out cease-and-desist letters, especially when the new combinations start making money for their creators. Some will be tolerant, watching quietly from the sidelines, perhaps fearful of fan backlash. Still others will be excited cheerleaders, tweeting out cool and amusing examples of their stuff remixed. \n\nThe greatest opportunity is one big step beyond any of these tactics: **reintegration**. The logical end to industrial media, the creative mode finally enabled by the blockchain, is a dynamic system where the remix continuously flows back into the source material. Is this practically possible? Could there ever be a version of the Star Wars Universe, for example, where stories or games that were created by fans, depicted or played using NFTs, were embraced and included within the canon? How would decisions of what to include be made, and by whom? And perhaps most importantly, could the creators of these remixes be rewarded for their contributions? \n\nThe winners of the next media era will have answers to these questions. \n\n***So where does that leave IP?***\n\nAs platforms emerge to enable creators to better construct, remix and monetize new IP, brands and creators need to make a decision as to whether to give access to creative development or to make creative development “hackable”. In the case of Napster, the industry overlooked the power of digital and instead of structuring a business in the internet age, fans hacked the early prototypes that would be consumer downloads and streaming for the music business to then take and build sophistication onto afterwards. In the case of TikTok, these tools are provided as part of the platform; consumers are creators and are encouraged to compound value on top of each other’s IP in order to make it more engaging, more participatory. This is increasingly the same for gaming and other industries that have recognized the value of removing the barriers of fan and creator and seeing the value of encouraging others to build on top of their IP. \n\nThe larger question about NFTs and media is how they will inevitably be used by ‘collectors’ to make new versions of storyworlds, a process which then presents the IP owner with the problem of how to consider those new creations. Should they be ignored? Tolerated? Or celebrated and integrated? It’s a challenge that is not going away. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2e26334e-b039-40e6-a225-571d57b9d9fa.png?height=607&width=587)\n\nThe process of bundle, unbundle, remix, reintegration isn’t linear. The disruption of industrial models doesn’t completely leave the existing platforms, creators and IP in its wake, it just moves them to either adjust or forfeit existing control. If we are moving towards a more accelerated remix culture, IP owners will need to decide whether to cede ground to fans, community members and other artists or adjust their existing value proposition. The tension is already there.\n\nMaybe the next generation of media mindset is being able to bring together all of this creativity and move it towards something? Or rethinking the way franchises develop and bridge relationships with fans in the forms of DAOs or other participation structures? Maybe the more things change the more they stay the same?\n\nThere are many questions. But here’s what we do know. IP is moving from one way to two way creation and consumption. Technology is making every content format developable and by making a genre \"developable\", it supercharges the two way IP model. When access becomes available to more than just experts, it starts to make the consumer more important than the creator and open season for remixing. As such franchises and content in general are already governed by fans, even if IP holders don't acknowledge it. \n\nTo be successful in this new world, IP holders will need to adjust and focus less on control and more on managing chaos. The new media model will employ a mindset of being able to take all of this creativity and move it towards something completely new, leveraging the systems and skills to listen, integrate, celebrate and put periphery into the center of its work. As remixing becomes increasingly accepted and encouraged as an art form, and product strategies congregate around platforms built for its reintegration, the decision to open up IP must be embraced by the creators themselves or it will be imposed by their audiences. The same way it always has been. \n", "timestamp": 1626793701, "digest": "seA6j67Jc0mm8vqGe1zTuXC7O0h95XlmazSQXDlrd24", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

Our community is full of thousands of smart, talented individuals looking to get hands-on experience working for a DAO.\n\nA common frustration we hear from many is how hard it is to “break into” existing DAOs. There are hundreds of people who want to participate, but have yet to find their way into an operational role.\n\nSo we asked ourselves …\n\nWhat if we used Mirror’s full set of creator empowering tools to launch a DAO that supports creative projects on Mirror, and gives individuals hands-on experience in building and operating a DAO?\n\nWell, today we’re excited to announce Mirror Club: a Grant Giving DAO designed to support creators and make it easy for individuals to gain valuable DAO experience.\n\n### Mirror Club starts now with the $mCLUB crowdfund.\n\nHere’s the game plan.\n\n- Backers can support the crowdfund with ETH in return for $mCLUB tokens.\n- $mCLUB tokens represent membership in Mirror Club.\n- The first feature of Mirror Club will be a tokenized Discord, gated by $mCLUB. Backers will immediately be able to access the Mirror Club section of the Seed Club Discord.\n- $mCLUB holders, with the support of Seed Club, will coordinate in the Discord to decide on a plan for governance and how to allocate the contributed funds.\n- 50% of $mCLUB supply will be held back to airdrop toon quality community members who'd like to participate but may not be able to back the project with ETH.\n- The crowdfund will target a fundraise of 25 ETH, which will be deposited into a multisig governed by the backers at mirror.club.eth\n\nSo what will the Mirror Club DAO do?\n\nThat’s really up to you.\n\nPerhaps the DAO becomes known for being the first backer of the most inspiring creative projects launching on Mirror. It might help recruit new creators into the Mirror ecosystem (and help them win a future $WRITE RACE), or help steward the development of new features, templates and modules. The DAO could even launch its own MediaDAO, funding its operations using NFTs and splits.\n\nThe future is up to $mCLUB holders.\n\n[Mirror Club](crowdfund://0xEF42258fB2B3f2ac0Ccf545240b7332B4ba4bB25?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=overview)\n\n[Mirror Club](crowdfund://0xEF42258fB2B3f2ac0Ccf545240b7332B4ba4bB25?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=backers)\n\n[Mirror Club](crowdfund://0xEF42258fB2B3f2ac0Ccf545240b7332B4ba4bB25?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=editions)\n\n[Hepburn](edition://0x92F424663F2E52DeDa4471D4560157eFEC7fAAd0?editionId=28&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n[Nietzsche](edition://0x92F424663F2E52DeDa4471D4560157eFEC7fAAd0?editionId=29&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n[Zen](edition://0x92F424663F2E52DeDa4471D4560157eFEC7fAAd0?editionId=30&version=crowdfund_1)\n", "timestamp": 1626812071, "digest": "p0q6UuQYQHHvlBbcjqzpD0MC_t3R1DhO3cRZgWfbdDE", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}
