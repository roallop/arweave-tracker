There is no standard recycling percentage in the market, but I think 20-25% is fairly common.\n\nWe do this at USV very aggressively. It allows us to put the entire fund to work and recoup the management fee load. A $100mm venture capital fund will pay something like $20mm in management fees over a ten-year life. So it would only actually invest $80mm into startups. But if that fund recycled $20mm back into new investments, it could put the entire $100mm to work even after paying the $20mm in management fees.\n\nSometimes it is also possible to use recycling to invest more than the fund actually raised. We have done that in a number of funds. Our first fund was a $125mm fund, but we only called something like $110mm from our investors and I think we ultimately put to work something like $140mm.\n\nThese might feel like small moves, but they can be very big moves when you are trying to make 3x or more on a fund. Three times $110mm is $330mm. Three times $140mm is $420mm.\n\nOf course you have to be smart about what you recycle and what do you not recycle. Most venture capital funds have investments where you get your money back or a bit more. It could be an early exit where the founders got a great offer they could not refuse. Or it could be an investment that only sort of worked. Those are great opportunities to recycle capital. You get your money back or a bit more, and then you put it back to work.\n\nIt can also make sense to take a little money off the table on a rocket ship type investment and recycle that. But doing too much of that sort of thing can reduce the returns in a fund instead of amplifying them. I have made that mistake and do not plan to do it again.\n\nPortfolio and fund management in a venture capital firm is not something that is often discussed. The biggest driver of performance is finding the right opportunities and getting into them at the right time. So that is where most people in venture capital focus their time and energy and rightly so.\n\nBut I believe that proper portfolio management; getting the right diversification in a portfolio, managing liquidity opportunities, and aggressive recycling can make a big difference in fund and firm performance and we dedicate real time and energy to these issues at USV. I think it has made a difference for us over the years.\n", "timestamp": 1617273632, "digest": "PcNvPBD2z-cYM5HDkML508ukILraWi1A6iRr2LmEQ2E", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

{"id": "vvxn-s9FoUg5xmxuj_teOnVWHoCZrwNol_UbBvfTG1g", "title": "Staking's Free Rider Problem", "body": "Every community has givers and takers. Some give. Some take.\n\nSome give and take.\n\nThe takers usually outnumber the givers. Those that balance giving and taking are rare.\n\n# All Take No Give\n\nValidator communities on staking networks are no exception. \nSpend a little time in validator chat groups to see this imbalance in action.\n\nYou‚Äôll see many people asking for help. You‚Äôll see fewer people offering to help. Those you see help are usually the same people, helping again and again.\n\nYou might expect the larger, better resourced validators to be the ones helping. It makes sense to believe that the more resources a validator has, the larger the staff it might have too.\n\nSo it‚Äôs reasonable to believe that these validators have more time to spend in the chats. If that‚Äôs the case, you might expect to see them offering to help and even, maybe, contributing tools and resources back to the community.\n\nThey also tend to have some of the biggest stakes and are earning the most fees as a result. This means they're extracting a lot of value from the network and its community.\n\n# And It's Not Who You Might Think\n\nYet spend some time in these communities and you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs often the smaller, independent validators who are answering the questions and making tangible contributions on a regular basis. \n\nIn fact, it‚Äôs rare to see representatives from the big validator companies in the chats at all.\n\nThey do tend to pop up during network upgrades, for example. They‚Äôre usually asking the questions, not answering them.\n\nThe recent Cosmos Stargate upgrade brought this idea home for me. In the weeks leading up to the upgrade, very few, if any, reps from the big validator companies were in the testnet chats or the chats helping prepare for the upgrade. Yet they did appear once the upgrade was underway and they needed something.\n\nTake, for example [this peers list I started](https://hackmd.io/_JcgQw5iTC66aspJWxhrxw). Early in the upgrade process there wasn‚Äôt a list of peers to use.\n\nI started this document and left it open for anyone to edit. Take a look at who contributed. More importantly, notice who‚Äôs absent.\n\nYou‚Äôll see that most of the contributions were made by smaller\noperators. Yet the list was used by the largest exchanges and staking as a service infrastructure operators.\n\nIn fact, someone from the latter asked in the chat if there was a list of peers. I responded with a link to the list and suggested he add a node as well.\n\nHis response? \n\nNada, nothing, zilch.\n\nIn another example, during a subsequent Cosmos emergency security upgrade, someone from one of the biggest exchanges emerged out of nowhere. He started asking quite a few questions, some of which indicated he might be somewhat new to Cosmos and hadn't done a lot of research on his own. He first turned to the community for help instead.\n\nIn addition, you don't see these companies sharing any tools with the validator communities. They guard their tools and keep them close to their vest. Maybe they see them as their competitive advantage.\n\n# The Free Riding Imbalance\n\nThese examples illustrate the validator free riding problem. In a nutshell, those validators extracting the most value to the network contribute the least.\n\n# Balancing the Scales\n\nHow can networks and their communities correct this imbalance? One way is to encourage delegators to not stake to these validators. \n\nThis may be a lost cause though. Many token holders of these networks don't care about the issue. They'll stake to the lowest fee, most convenient validators. While not a completely hopeless endeavor, this approach needs to be supplemented by other actions.\n\nIdeally, validators who don't contribute value wouldn't be able to extract value. This is difficult to implement.\n\nSo rather than punish those who don't contribute value, networks should find ways to reward those that create value. \n\nThis includes those active in the chats who both take AND give. Foundation delegations are a start, yet aren't enough.\n\n# At Least Start Talking About It\n\nThere are other creative ways to neutralize or at least diminish this problem too. Networks and their communities need to start taking action now, before these value extractors get an even bigger lead, taking staking even closer to a [decentralized doomsday scenario](https://thedefiant.io/rich-getting-richer-in-pos-chains-by-chainflows-chris-remus/).\n\nAnother easy way to stem the tide is to at least discuss the issue in public. Hopefully this post helps encourage this discussion.\n\n#KeepStakeDecentralized üí™", "timestamp": 1617281598, "digest": "jgE2Pxrm41ngkv-HoudSDnkGqii6KLGbyKfQyupWup4", "contributor": "0x53b91350a481C1ad80f12127d10524793c9a7E89"}
