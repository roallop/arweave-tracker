I’ve heard the term “analog summer” used to describe this moment. If the past 15 months have been a digital lockdown, then the next three months are going to mark a return to analog activities; beaches, parks, concerts, bars, restaurants, nightlife, etc, etc.\n\nWe’ve already seen the effect of this change in behavior in our portfolio companies, many of which benefited significantly from the digital lockdown. Digital providers of education, entertainment, shopping, and so much more had banner months in 2020 and the first half of 2021.\n\nI am looking forward to the analog summer. I can’t wait to do all of the things that we could not do in the last year and a half. I think it will be a much-needed return to normal for all of us.\n\nAs for our portfolio and the tech sector more broadly, I am not too concerned about the return to normal. These businesses all got a huge boost in business over the last year and they aren’t going to give it all back. But their growth rates will be more like what they were in 2019 than 2020. And they will be growing from a much larger base.\n\nI think we all learned some new behaviors during the pandemic and while we are eager to shed some of them this summer, I think we will keep a lot of them going forward. The covid pandemic will mark an inflection point in the adoption of digital services and our analog summer, as great as it is going to be, will not change that.\n", "timestamp": 1624273157, "digest": "g1DclLxlXGojJ9aL0lZFVg-O-JIfEZjanKv0TzDDBrI", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

Since August 2020, the number of wallets holding $FF tracked tokens has grown over 1400%, while the number of tokens tracked increased from 9 to 25.

It remains the most widely held social token, with over 3,200 holders. $WHALE saw particularly fast growth between mid-February and mid-March this year, being introduced to over 1400 (~43%) new wallets in that timespan.

The number of active daily DeFi wallets crossed over 15,000 last July and has grown to over 50,000 daily active wallets, even after a significant decrease since a peak of over 100,000 in May 2021.

Forefront community member RantumBits conducted an on-chain analysis of the 25 tokens listed on [Forefront Market](https://forefront.news/market), as measured in the [Dune Analytics dashboard](https://duneanalytics.com/rantum/Social-Tokens) on the number of wallets holding tokens, and their trading activity. *(Note: price activity will be added to the dashboard once tokens are added to Dune’s database.)*\n\nWhile there’s much left to explore, here are four key takeaways that have us excited:\n\n## First, more people are holding social tokens than ever before.\n\nOver 16,000 wallets now hold social tokens, with over 10,000 new wallets introducing social tokens since the beginning of this year. Since August 2020, the number of wallets holding $FF tracked tokens has grown over 1400%, while the number of tokens tracked increased from 9 to 25. While Forefront doesn’t track every token in the space, the growth here is indicative of much larger trends across the ecosystem. \n\n## Second, three main communities are responsible for most social token exposure.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/742c736c-42df-462d-88d2-7c05f0bfd28e.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\n[$WHALE](https://forefront.news/creators/whale), introduced in May 2020, became the most-held social token by wallet count in September of last year. It remains the most widely held social token, with over 3,200 holders. $WHALE saw particularly fast growth between mid-February and mid-March this year, being introduced to over 1400 (~43%) new wallets in that timespan. Much of this growth can be attributed to the peak of NFT hype, as new users were being introduced to crypto at an unprecedented pace.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3c42d344-3d01-4bb1-9e83-e25ac03b466f.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\nWhile growth has slowed recently for $WHALE, new tokens have launched with even more impressive growth. [$FWB](https://forefront.news/creators/friends-with-benefits-pro) quickly took over the #2 spot after its relaunch following the Roll hack, before relinquishing the position to [$BANK](https://forefront.news/creators/bankless-dao) upon its airdrop in May 2021. In particular, the success of communities like $FWB following the Roll hack demonstrates that the growth of the last year is here to stay.\n\n## Third, new tokens are launching to larger audiences.\n\nAfter an impressive launch by $FWB to over 1800 wallets, $BANK surpassed that launching to over 2500 wallets. $BANK growth has continued at a fast rate, and it could take the top spot in the coming months, if not weeks. However, the growth of these tokens is not solely responsible for the rise of the space at large.\n\nThe market share of social tokens continues to diversify as new tokens are introduced. Rather than wallets shifting between social tokens in their portfolio, the pie continues to expand. Still, over 50% of wallets that hold Social Tokens can be attributed to 3 tokens mentioned above: $WHALE, $FWB, and $BANK. The next tier is much more widely distributed, with the next 10 tokens making up over 30% of all wallets holding social tokens.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0c81a79b-393e-47f8-b6d0-e4fa222bf72a.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\n## Fourth, social tokens are being traded, not just held.\n\nIn terms of DEX activity, $BANK leads both for the number of trades and token volume. $WHALE and $FWB are both among the most widely traded, as are $1337, $SEEN and $ROBOT. At its peak in May 2021, the number of token traders exceeded 100,000 in one day. \n\n## Social Tokens Poised for Growth\n\nWhile social token growth has exploded to over 16,000 wallets this year, it’s important to put that in context. The number of active daily DeFi wallets crossed over 15,000 last July and has grown to over 50,000 daily active wallets, even after a significant decrease since a peak of over 100,000 in May 2021. Social tokens don’t necessarily require the same level of daily activity and this comparison can serve as an indicator of the growth potential ahead for social tokens. \n\n> With the space maturing rapidly, one question is apparent: Will the next catalyst of social token growth be an existing community or a new token that breaks into the mainstream?\n\n*If you enjoyed this post, be sure to leave a tip.

The kind of happiness that can only come with witnessing a journey of triumph over circumstance and knowing you played a very small part in its course.\n\n\nThe message was from Brandon, whose journey I have had the privilege of following for the past three years. We first \"met\" back in 2018 when he started working on some of the non code bounties we had setup on Bounties Network and joined our community. Meeting people discovering crypto for the first time and enabling their involvement without any technical knowledge was one of my favourite things about the work we did - especially in that 2018 level crypto landscape. We started chatting and I got to know a bit about him, his story and his genuine passion for what **crypto could be - “a tool for the betterment of society as a whole”.**\n\n\n[Our first interview was in 2019](https://medium.com/bounties-network/bounties-network-community-profile-brandon-walsh-233ea93e8886) and for me it was one of the first true confirmations that what we were doing with this tech had meaning. A meaning well beyond the spoils of an obscure casino at the edges of the internet dominated by \"few\" narratives. This was a levelling of the playing field that could change the course of lives stuck between cemented lines of lack.\n\nFast forward two years and here we both are, catching up after some tumultuous yet truly transformative times. But I'd like to let Brandon tell his story, in his own words and through his own experiences.\n\n**S: We've kept in touch since our last interview, through some tough times in 2020 but really truly reconnected a few weeks ago. How have you been? Tell me everything!**\n\n\n**Brandon:** Well... my life has changed so much.\nI am an artist now. I am on Twitter. And I am no longer homeless. Something made possible by a handful of bull run art sales, and the gracious support from some very special people, yourself included Simona.\n\nFor the first time in my life I have my own bed, my own desk, and my own bathtub. (Which I literally soaked in for almost my entire first week living here). I have an awesome camera and phone, and I have the laptop that you and all the awesome people [pooled together and made possible](https://twitter.com/Sim_Pop/status/1178342264164233216?s=20). The laptop that allowed me to move past making art exclusively on my phone!\n\nI really owe it all to the Ethereum ecosystem. It was not only all of the possibilities that Ethereum offers, but the people that make up its community, that really helped to change my life. \n\nMost people come into the crypto world as investors, traders, or developers. I began my journey as an observer. I had very little prior exposure to technology. I had never been a participant in any type of financial market or community. Money was not part of my reality. But I wanted it to be. I dreamed about the security and safety that money would bring. When I heard about crypto, I needed to know more.\nI dug through forums. I read white-papers. I watched Telegram rooms for hours. I didn't post threads, participate in ICOs, or engage with others in chat. I just observed. Observing is what I knew. It's what I have always done. What I always have been. The silent observer; out of sight and out of mind.\n\nI have always been uncomfortable with having an identity as a \"homeless\" person. Not just because it changes how I was seen and treated, but because it changed how I felt about myself. But I am here talking about it, because I feel it is important that my experience be shared. Because this is a side of crypto that has so much potential, but I don't think people understand or really believe that it can work the way it did for me.\n\nEthereum is not a speculative asset for me. It's not something I invest in or trade. **Ethereum is the tool that allows me to manage my own money, to work, to socialize, and to network.**\n\n**S: It's essentially an integral part of your life. How did that all happen for you, that assimilation?**\n\n\n**Brandon:** When you are homeless, it’s almost impossible to find legitimate work. Most people won’t even consider hiring someone who is homeless. The ones who do, usually try to take advantage of you. \n\nIn 2018 I discovered the Bounties Network. It was a decentralized online gig economy, where anyone could be an employer or an earner. Job fulfilment and payment was handled via a smart contract. Being homeless was suddenly not a barrier. I was never denied the ability to complete a task because I didn’t have a mailing address, reliable transportation, or work history. I was never taken advantage of or shorted on a payment. It was my first real experience being able to perform work without having to endure all of the negative feelings that usually came with it. \n\nThere was one task I completed in the Summer of 2019 that sticks out. I spent almost six hours wading through city canals picking up assorted trash and plastic. I stepped on multiple thorns, soaked my only pair of shoes, and at the end of the day I smelled like...well....a city canal. The minute I was done with the job, I was signed into my web3 wallet and submitting my task completion.  \n\nAbout an hour later, I was paid about $20 in ETH. I took about half, converted it to Bitcoin, and transferred it to my Cashapp card. With that I had tooth pain medicine and some food to eat. And with the rest of the ETH, I had just enough gas to mint a few NFTs on a brand new platform I had just joined called SuperRare. \n\nI was happy that evening. I felt useful. I felt good about myself. I was actually smiling. I wasn’t in pain. I wasn’t hungry.  \n\nTo some, the work or the money may not have seemed worth it. To me, it was one of the best days I can remember. \n\nBy the start of 2020, Bounties Network had sadly lost its funding and tasks were no longer available. But as that chapter of my journey was ending, I was beginning the next by creating and selling crypto art on SuperRare. \n\nSuperRare is a crypto art platform where artists sell one of one artwork as NFTs. I had first learned of NFTs in 2018 on Bounties Network, having made some for various tasks and jobs, like the crypto cards for a Venezuela project. I became aware that people were making and selling NFTs on a few different platforms, and ended up joining the telegram channel for SuperRare. I had not been making digital art for very long, so it was a little intimidating at first, but that quickly faded. \n\nI couldn’t believe how amazing everyone was. From the owners to the artists, every single person was kind and incredibly supportive. One of the owners, Zach, encouraged me to apply to the platform. I did, and to my surprise, I was accepted. \n\n\nThe NFT space now has gotten lots of attention, and a lot of things have changed. Although it has brought an increase in sales, I do miss the early days. Back then, there was a much different spirit, both in the people and the artwork. It felt very much like a family. I made most of my artwork on my phone, and I did not have a consistent style at all. Art was still very much a place of discovery for me. But that was ok, because the artwork that was being made seemed to be more about expression rather than commercialization. There wasn’t any pressure or need to conform or compete. Money wasn’t really the focus for anybody, and honestly, it felt so good just to make a sale, that I accepted just about any offer, even if it was only for a few dollars. \n\nWhen all the hype started, everything started to feel a bit strange. There were so many new artists, with impressive and intricate 3D artwork, that I began to doubt myself and shy away from the platform a bit. But still, a lot of my old artwork started selling and reselling, eventually I had the confidence to come back and start creating again. With the money from those recent sales, along with the support of a few special people in the community, I was able to get enough money to finally get off the streets. I now have an apartment, my own bed, a computer and a desk. Something I never would have dreamed possible just a year ago. \n\n\nMy style is still up in the air. I am still looking for my signature. So I decided to go back to something very close to my heart. Something  that I have been creating for many years....writing poetry. Poetry has always been my escape and my therapy. It was the thing that took my mind off my surroundings. And allowed me to express myself, even when there was nobody around to talk to. \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/25534)\n\n\n**S: I am proud to say I am already a collector of your work and I am excited to check out your poetry series. Any closing thoughts?**\n\n**Brandon:** Ethereum is its own world. There is layer upon layer upon layer. I mean that not on a technical level, but a human one. This place is filled with the best human beings that I have ever encountered.\n\nThe entire experience as a whole, is magical: The mindset. The possibilities. Anyone who has truly immersed themselves into what Ethereum has to offer knows that it isn't about money. **It's about empowering humanity.**\n\nEthereum opened doors for me that did not exist out in the real world. It gave me so many things, but **most importantly it gave me myself.**\n\nI am a citizen of Ethereum, not a user.\nEthereum is where my friends are.\nEthereum is where my job is.\nEthereum is where my purpose is.\n\nI haven't been homeless since the day I landed on Bounties Network in 2018.\n\n**This is my real home.**\n", "timestamp": 1624280811, "digest": "yK6oz2Rbhv5r0ycII-fziwrTeUf55XLEuaokA518AoA", "contributor": "0x54BeCc7560a7Be76d72ED76a1f5fee6C5a2A7Ab6", "nft": "{\"nftTransactionHash\": \"0x520c8b9a8e9eae7940a03b00e4f1a9df6ed5116fa58da10bc1de6a241a49c931\"}"}

We cover what tokenized access and subscriptions look like, ongoing experiments with the tech, as well as the numerous advantages over traditional SaaS. We purposefully don’t dive specifically into other important benefits that token economies can provide services willing to decentralize, such as governance, DAOs, etc. We mainly focus on the argument that all or most SaaS and creator businesses can and should tokenize subscriptions to their services.\n\nTokenized services are especially powerful for creators, allowing them to focus on providing a good service, finding customers who want the service (a market fit), and focusing on bringing that customer value. This is good for customers since they can pay less and have a better experience. It’s good for creators since they can sustain their businesses. \n\n## The rest of this [article](https://mgate.io/go/nmsMvDlYdUG-) is restricted to token holders. \n\n### To [enter](https://mgate.io/go/nmsMvDlYdUG-), you must own (any of the below): \n\n- 1000 FF tokens\n- 1 ForeFront NFT\n- 100 YUP tokens\n- 60 FWB tokens\n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e20ac873-c8b8-43d6-bb09-2e6b4fc21da2.jpeg?height=326&width=1280)](https://mgate.io/go/nmsMvDlYdUG-)\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1624287278, "digest": "xNefWqSahUklxHWteREcL9dSUzS1jbb-u6R6j0NLWvk", "contributor": "0x4303Ddc9943D862f2B205aF468a4A786c5137E76"}

I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn’t meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you’d think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend’s living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn’t just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it’s not just a technology. It’s a philosophy. It’s a belief system. It’s a way of viewing the world. It’s about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you’re batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood. I remember the “aha moment” when I wrote my first smart contract. With just a few lines of code and a private key, I was able to transfer an internet-native currency anywhere in the world in seconds. \n\nI didn’t have to sign up for Stripe. I didn’t have to use the Plaid API to connect a bank account. I didn’t have to check if TransferWise supported payments for a specific country. There was no centralized party. Just a peer-to-peer cryptonetwork called Ethereum. It was pretty damn mindblowing.\n\nAfter the first few weeks at Dharma, I was confident that DeFi and crypto were the future. But I also got the itch to work on some of my own ideas. I wanted to build software for creative people. Writers. Artists. Musicians. Online teachers. I strongly believe our world depends on these types of people having the tools they need to serve their communities as best they can.\n\nFrankly, I also thought it would take a couple years before the crypto industry had the infrastructure in place for a mainstream consumer app to be built.\n\n\nSo I ended up leaving Dharma to take some time off and explore a few startup ideas. But a couple months ago I read a [manifesto](https://cryptomedia.wtf/) by [Zora](https://zora.co/) that changed how I thought about crypto.\n\nIt described a world where crypto could be used to give any digital media file (eg an image, a song, an essay, digital art, etc.) property rights. It explained how cryptonetworks could turn digital media into liquid financial assets, secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts.\n\nAlthough the individual ideas weren’t new, they were combined and articulated in a way that just made sense. And not just to me.\n\n[Digital artists](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9), [athletes](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html), [social media influencers](https://cryptoslate.com/logan-paul-nfts-sell-3-5-million-worth-on-first-day-of-release/), [tech executives](https://scottbelsky.medium.com/the-furry-lisa-cryptoart-the-new-economy-of-digital-creativity-6cb2300ea081), [media executives](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI), and [journalists](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1366554892035219462) that never took the crypto weirdos seriously, seem to be taking notice.\n\nBut let’s be real. Is this latest NFT craze a bubble? Probz. Yet, is there at least a kernel of value in the idea of ownership over creative work? I think so.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell, there’s been a lot of talk about high transaction fees and lack of scalability in these systems. Although I do think these problems should and will get fixed, a lack of technical scalability is kinda the point.\n\nCryptonetworks trade off technical scalability for social scalability.\n\nFacebook is technically scalable because it’s a social network that processes millions of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is socially scalable because it’s a trillion dollar economic network without a centralized authority.\n\nCrypto isn’t just a technological revolution. It’s also a revolution in capital formation and human coordination. How creative projects are funded. How groups of people are incentivized. How organizations are structured.\n\nYears from now, when I’m old and senile, I believe we’ll look back at this period as an [Internet Renaissance](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1343210395704541189) of sorts. \n\nA time where we dared to fight back against systems that have been designed for centuries to elevate certain groups and keep others disenfranchised.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe all this crypto stuff really is just an intellectual ideal that’ll never work in practice. Regardless, I think it’s at least worth trying.", "timestamp": 1624290256, "digest": "pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

{"id": "iBnB3STiyGhbnm9f9Y0_JfhtR3dgP5D1NLvbENXr608", "title": "Constraints, Containers and Games: Early Thoughts On Songcamp 2", "body": "*Hey. It’s been a while.* \n\n*Here’s what we’ve been up to the last few weeks, and how it’s helped shape our thinking around Songcamp 2 — which (btw) is imminently approaching.* \n\n*Thanks for being here. :)*\n\n# Squad Phone Experiments\n\nEvery Monday at 4pm ET, Songcamp has ***The Call*** — a 1-hour community-wide call on the squad phone voice channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wHsJD2sTpc). \n\nThis call has happened every single week for 12 weeks now, ever since Songcamp’s inception. (You can read our genesis story [here](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/K9i_cjk1zep0ESfu71Wj5by2zrHOIopAvZ5iSmDJYY0).)\n\nTypically this call is a time to talk general updates, answer questions, and introduce newcomers to our community. \n\nOver the last few weeks, however, our calls have taken on a different shape. \n\nIn the experimental nature that Songcamp was born with, we’ve started playing around with **making collective decisions** and **taking collective action** on these calls. \n\nWelcome to the *squad phone experiments*...\n\n### Experiment No.1 — The Vote\n\nThree weeks ago, we had our first vote. Up until then, our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/songcamp_) handle was @songcampdotband. It was long and hard to read quickly and we wanted a change. \n\nOn that week’s call, we supplied a list of 10 pre-populated name suggestions to get things rolling. We threw the list up on Discord and everyone on the call voted with emojis.. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c0f6a467-169e-4b2d-a63c-ec82aacbb73a.jpg?height=620&width=1188)\n\nThe short and sweet **@songcamp_** was the clear winner. \n\nNext, we prompted everyone to come up with their own handle suggestions to try and beat @songcamp_.\n\nIdeas started flooding the chat. We chose the ones that got some quick excitement (via comments and emoji reactions) and threw them in a second vote. The results were as follows: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/songcamp_/status/1399486989506912257\n\nThe process of making this decision together was a ton of fun. Just to see the emoji numbers shooting up, the alternative ideas populating the chat, people unmuting themselves and reacting to their favourites. The simple act of group participation created this vital and intimate energy, and we wanted more of it. \n\nSo the following week, we took it up a notch…\n\n### Experiment No. 2 — The Identicon Design Workshop\n\nI was very inspired by the [Pre-Brand x Zora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjczwDE9kmw) collective design event I participated in back in late 2020. I wanted to do something similar with Songcamp, where we’d all jump into a Figma design file together and co-create our Twitter avatar. \n\nThe idea was to give each participant on the call their own “workstation” to make something, and at the end of the call we’d smush all the pieces together to create one big Songcamp identicon.\n\nI spoke with Peace Node ([@](https://twitter.com/peace_node)) on the idea, and he thought we could each create our own pixelated identicon akin to Ethereum [blockies](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/vanity-blockie-miner-for-ethereum-902fccf0a427). I loved the idea. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f465223c-c6e1-4fe5-9108-a9eefe63e449.png?height=556&width=1515)\n\nWe went about creating 36 workstations in a Figma design file, each with its own blank 8x8 bit square. The instructions were to fill your identicon in with the Paint Fill tool, and write a sentence or two about your piece. We would then amalgamate everyone’s identicons into one big Songcamp identicon.\n\nHere’s what those workstations looked like:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a924d800-efc8-481d-8470-297b2a840273.png?height=920&width=1412)\n\nWhen our call started we gave some light instructions and dropped the [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/bZ6We4jHx8erQK3xYWLJkm/SONGCAMP-IDENTITY). What happened next was electric…\n\nColored mice started flying about the screen and everyone got to creating their piece. More and more people showed up in the file, and we had to create more workstations on the fly. \n\nBy the end, we had co-created a Songcamp identicon of ~ 60 personal identicons — each with their own flavors. What we ended up with was a mosaic of loud beauty that just screamed fun.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b0160420-4e8b-421a-bc0d-280b5be78785.jpg?height=1368&width=1718)\n\nhttps://twitter.com/matthewchaim/status/1402017697790148616\n\nThe energy during this experiment was palpable. The multi-colored mice flying across the screen, exuberant voices popping in and out of the voice chat, rainbows upon rainbows of kaleidoscopic goodness filling our eyes with every passing second. \n\nAs you can see, some people took the constraints given and “broke the rules” in fun and creative ways. One such piece ended up looking like the original 8x8 square had exploded in every direction..\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d89891be-2683-425a-9795-5d469ac64762.png?height=138&width=138)\n\nAnother fun element that arose organically during the event was a self-organizing swarm of “*helpers*”. People who knew Figma well and finished their pieces early on were quick to help when others expressed confusion or a need for assistance on the call. Before I could even find the workstation in need myself, 3 to 6 people had already shown up and solved the problem within seconds. This allowed beginners to participate just as easily as experts, and erased any requirement for “design skills” to take part. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0a334db2-a2bc-492b-8c39-9740f540bb71.png?height=1256&width=2036)\n\nWe went from *collective decision making* (voting) to *collective creation* (design), and now we were really on a roll. So on our next call, we brought it up a level yet again…\n\n\n### Experiment No. 3 — The Minicamp\n\nTo see how much art we could create as a group in such a short amount of time really got the wheels turning…\n\n*We were able to create 60 identicons in less than an hour together. What if we could run a songcamp in less than an hour?*\n\nThe following Monday we decided to try and answer that question. \n\nSince we didn’t know who would be showing up to the call, and whether or not they would have access to audio or visual production tools, we started with a few votes to read the room…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/19fa6fa2-17a4-4cb2-ab33-5044cc9658fa.png?height=726&width=1664)\n\nWe threw the above question up and asked for honest responses to get a feel if running this minicamp was realistic. As you can see, most said *No* — meaning they either couldn’t or didn’t want to participate in an impromptu songcamp. \n\nHowever, 16 affirmative answers seemed like enough potential participants to warrant the next question…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9e450eed-1525-4b43-97a0-73ef4b454a81.png?height=442&width=1038)\n\nSince we had figured beforehand that running ~3 rooms would be ideal, this worked out perfectly. \n\nWe quickly organized text and voice channels for 3 rooms — each populated with 1 or 2 producers, a vocalist, and 1 or 2 visual artists. \n\nEach group was given the following explicit constraint: **the task here is not to make *great* art. It is to make art in 40 minutes.**\n\nWhile each team got to work, the rest of us discussed ideas of what we could do with the resulting artwork. \n\nAdrian Tavares ([@](https://twitter.com/AdrianRicard0)) had the great idea of creating this [brainstorming prompt](https://app.sli.do/event/wk2wmmpu/live/ideas) on the app Slido, where we could all throw in ideas anonymously and vote on them. This helped get the juices flowing, and we threw around some fun possibilities. \n\nBecause the results of this short art-making experiment were so unknown, we didn’t come to any clear plan. It instead kicked us into some interesting conversations around the sanctity of the creative process.\n\nWhen the 40 minutes were up, the teams were asked to return to the main call and share the minisongs and cover artworks they’d created. Here’s what they made… \n\nhttps://audius.co/songcamp/soma-440783\n\nhttps://audius.co/songcamp/golden-hour-440784\n\nhttps://audius.co/songcamp/in-a-rush-440790\n\nSuffice to say, we were all blown away. \n\nIn 40 minutes, they all created sprouting songs that each held such beautiful power and potential. The cover artworks also encapsulated that improvised energy and beauty. \n\nWe couldn’t believe they’d gone from strangers, to collaborators who could make something so resonant in well under an hour. \n\nThis experiment wasn’t to determine how quickly art can be made. Rest assured we want to create space for collective creation to be baked in its own time. But it was once again super fun to see people show up with no prior knowledge of the plan, and throw down like this on a random Monday afternoon. \n\nThe energy to make art together is very much *here*. \n\n## Constraints, Containers and Games\n\nIn all 3 of these *squad phone experiments*, we essentially built little **games** that we could play together. \n\nAll of them have their own **constraints** — parameters that close the loop and let us reach a desired result. These constraints are time-bound, scope-bound, and space-bound... *vote on these 10 things, make this 8x8 thing on Figma, make a minisong in 40 minutes*. \n\nThey also each rely on the **containers** that we supplied: the prompted questions with emoji-style voting, the Figma workstations with templated assets, the Discord text and voice channels to meet and communicate with collaborators.\n\nOne more ingredient that is worth adding explicitly to the mix is **incentives**. In these games, the incentives to play were simply to have fun. Naturally, these incentives can grow — from *having fun* and *making friends* to *owning something* and *making money* and *winning something* and *social signaling* etc.\n\n**It is with these ingredients that we can build games for *collective creation***. \n\nAs we build better and better games, with more exciting constraints and more sophisticated containers + incentives, it is my belief that we will reach e**scape velocity in co-creation**. We will get so good and symphonic at doing stuff together, that large swarms of people will begin to move together with the dexterity and agility of small groups of individuals — with the added leverage of more minds, more skills, more computers, more etc… \n\nThus the goal of a community like Songcamp is to build these games — and the ingredients therein — to reach unforeseen levels of co-creation. \n\n## Songcamp 2 as a Modestly Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game\n\n*Songcamp Genesis* took the format of an in-real-life songwriting camp and ported it online, with the added support of a visual team and release squad. \n\nWe attempted to solve the problem of a lot of songwriting camps — great songs are made but they don’t make it out the door. They get stuck living dormant on hard drives, and their true value is never realized. \n\nIf the goal is to make great art and share that art publicly, then there is an inherent problem with that game. For most songwriting camps, the game is to make a certain number of songs with a certain group of people in a certain amount of time. Then, the game ends. \n\nTo release that music through any funnel typical of the music industry, you are effectively entering an altogether different game — one where many people with many conflicting incentives are involved. And thus, a lot of music doesn’t make it out into the world. \n\nWhen we were running the first songcamp, many people asked a similar question around what this camp was *really* about — was it about collective creation, or was it about using web3 tools to carve out new value streams for the resulting artwork?\n\nMy answer was typically “*both*”.\n\nBut now my answer is changing. For I don’t think the two are separate at all. They are actually a lot more flush than we let on.\n\nMost music is created collaboratively. Creating music is a social experience. But legacy systems have squeezed that sense of co-creation out of public view. Again, due to incentives pushing us toward certain games. The game most artists are playing is a very independent one: build a personal artist brand, and tuck all the collaborative work it takes to build that brand underneath and out of view. \n\nMusic is also *experienced* collaboratively. Listening to music is a social experience, and for most of human history this was at the forefront. But so much of our online experience of music is quite siloed. We stream music in our own little algorithmic corners, without much sense of community related to our online music experiences. \n\n**So what if we could conjoin these collaborative experiences into one, and build a game that both artists and audiences can play together?**\n\nThe goal of web3 is not to financialize every little thing.

It’s been a while.* \n\n*Here’s what we’ve been up to the last few weeks, and how it’s helped shape our thinking around Songcamp 2 — which (btw) is imminently approaching.* \n\n*Thanks for being here. :)*\n\n# Squad Phone Experiments\n\nEvery Monday at 4pm ET, Songcamp has ***The Call*** — a 1-hour community-wide call on the squad phone voice channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wHsJD2sTpc). \n\nThis call has happened every single week for 12 weeks now, ever since Songcamp’s inception. (You can read our genesis story [here](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/K9i_cjk1zep0ESfu71Wj5by2zrHOIopAvZ5iSmDJYY0).)\n\nTypically this call is a time to talk general updates, answer questions, and introduce newcomers to our community. \n\nOver the last few weeks, however, our calls have taken on a different shape. \n\nIn the experimental nature that Songcamp was born with, we’ve started playing around with **making collective decisions** and **taking collective action** on these calls. \n\nWelcome to the *squad phone experiments*...\n\n### Experiment No.1 — The Vote\n\nThree weeks ago, we had our first vote. Up until then, our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/songcamp_) handle was @songcampdotband. It was long and hard to read quickly and we wanted a change. \n\nOn that week’s call, we supplied a list of 10 pre-populated name suggestions to get things rolling. We threw the list up on Discord and everyone on the call voted with emojis.. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c0f6a467-169e-4b2d-a63c-ec82aacbb73a.jpg?height=620&width=1188)\n\nThe short and sweet **@songcamp_** was the clear winner. \n\nNext, we prompted everyone to come up with their own handle suggestions to try and beat @songcamp_.\n\nIdeas started flooding the chat. We chose the ones that got some quick excitement (via comments and emoji reactions) and threw them in a second vote. The results were as follows: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/songcamp_/status/1399486989506912257\n\nThe process of making this decision together was a ton of fun. Just to see the emoji numbers shooting up, the alternative ideas populating the chat, people unmuting themselves and reacting to their favourites. The simple act of group participation created this vital and intimate energy, and we wanted more of it. \n\nSo the following week, we took it up a notch…\n\n### Experiment No. 2 — The Identicon Design Workshop\n\nI was very inspired by the [Pre-Brand x Zora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjczwDE9kmw) collective design event I participated in back in late 2020. I wanted to do something similar with Songcamp, where we’d all jump into a Figma design file together and co-create our Twitter avatar. \n\nThe idea was to give each participant on the call their own “workstation” to make something, and at the end of the call we’d smush all the pieces together to create one big Songcamp identicon.\n\nI spoke with Peace Node ([@](https://twitter.com/peace_node)) on the idea, and he thought we could each create our own pixelated identicon akin to Ethereum [blockies](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/vanity-blockie-miner-for-ethereum-902fccf0a427). I loved the idea. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f465223c-c6e1-4fe5-9108-a9eefe63e449.png?height=556&width=1515)\n\nWe went about creating 36 workstations in a Figma design file, each with its own blank 8x8 bit square. The instructions were to fill your identicon in with the Paint Fill tool, and write a sentence or two about your piece. We would then amalgamate everyone’s identicons into one big Songcamp identicon.\n\nHere’s what those workstations looked like:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a924d800-efc8-481d-8470-297b2a840273.png?height=920&width=1412)\n\nWhen our call started we gave some light instructions and dropped the [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/bZ6We4jHx8erQK3xYWLJkm/SONGCAMP-IDENTITY). What happened next was electric…\n\nColored mice started flying about the screen and everyone got to creating their piece. More and more people showed up in the file, and we had to create more workstations on the fly. \n\nBy the end, we had co-created a Songcamp identicon of ~ 60 personal identicons — each with their own flavors. What we ended up with was a mosaic of loud beauty that just screamed fun.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b0160420-4e8b-421a-bc0d-280b5be78785.jpg?height=1368&width=1718)\n\nhttps://twitter.com/matthewchaim/status/1402017697790148616\n\nThe energy during this experiment was palpable. The multi-colored mice flying across the screen, exuberant voices popping in and out of the voice chat, rainbows upon rainbows of kaleidoscopic goodness filling our eyes with every passing second. \n\nAs you can see, some people took the constraints given and “broke the rules” in fun and creative ways. One such piece ended up looking like the original 8x8 square had exploded in every direction..\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d89891be-2683-425a-9795-5d469ac64762.png?height=138&width=138)\n\nAnother fun element that arose organically during the event was a self-organizing swarm of “*helpers*”. People who knew Figma well and finished their pieces early on were quick to help when others expressed confusion or a need for assistance on the call. Before I could even find the workstation in need myself, 3 to 6 people had already shown up and solved the problem within seconds. This allowed beginners to participate just as easily as experts, and erased any requirement for “design skills” to take part. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0a334db2-a2bc-492b-8c39-9740f540bb71.png?height=1256&width=2036)\n\nWe went from *collective decision making* (voting) to *collective creation* (design), and now we were really on a roll. So on our next call, we brought it up a level yet again…\n\n\n### Experiment No. 3 — The Minicamp\n\nTo see how much art we could create as a group in such a short amount of time really got the wheels turning…\n\n*We were able to create 60 identicons in less than an hour together. What if we could run a songcamp in less than an hour?*\n\nThe following Monday we decided to try and answer that question. \n\nSince we didn’t know who would be showing up to the call, and whether or not they would have access to audio or visual production tools, we started with a few votes to read the room…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/19fa6fa2-17a4-4cb2-ab33-5044cc9658fa.png?height=726&width=1664)\n\nWe threw the above question up and asked for honest responses to get a feel if running this minicamp was realistic. As you can see, most said *No* — meaning they either couldn’t or didn’t want to participate in an impromptu songcamp. \n\nHowever, 16 affirmative answers seemed like enough potential participants to warrant the next question…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9e450eed-1525-4b43-97a0-73ef4b454a81.png?height=442&width=1038)\n\nSince we had figured beforehand that running ~3 rooms would be ideal, this worked out perfectly. \n\nWe quickly organized text and voice channels for 3 rooms — each populated with 1 or 2 producers, a vocalist, and 1 or 2 visual artists. \n\nEach group was given the following explicit constraint: **the task here is not to make *great* art. It is to make art in 40 minutes.**\n\nWhile each team got to work, the rest of us discussed ideas of what we could do with the resulting artwork. \n\nAdrian Tavares ([@](https://twitter.com/AdrianRicard0)) had the great idea of creating this [brainstorming prompt](https://app.sli.do/event/wk2wmmpu/live/ideas) on the app Slido, where we could all throw in ideas anonymously and vote on them. This helped get the juices flowing, and we threw around some fun possibilities. \n\nBecause the results of this short art-making experiment were so unknown, we didn’t come to any clear plan. It instead kicked us into some interesting conversations around the sanctity of the creative process.\n\nWhen the 40 minutes were up, the teams were asked to return to the main call and share the minisongs and cover artworks they’d created. Here’s what they made… \n\nhttps://audius.co/songcamp/playlist/minicamp-demos-53353\n\nSuffice to say, we were all blown away. \n\nIn 40 minutes, they all created sprouting songs that each held such beautiful power and potential. The cover artworks also encapsulated that improvised energy and beauty. \n\nWe couldn’t believe they’d gone from strangers, to collaborators who could make something so resonant in well under an hour. \n\nThis experiment wasn’t to determine how quickly art can be made. Rest assured we want to create space for collective creation to be baked in its own time. But it was once again super fun to see people show up with no prior knowledge of the plan, and throw down like this on a random Monday afternoon. \n\nThe energy to make art together is very much *here*. \n\n## Constraints, Containers and Games\n\nIn all 3 of these *squad phone experiments*, we essentially built little **games** that we could play together. \n\nAll of them have their own **constraints** — parameters that close the loop and let us reach a desired result. These constraints are time-bound, scope-bound, and space-bound... *vote on these 10 things, make this 8x8 thing on Figma, make a minisong in 40 minutes*. \n\nThey also each rely on the **containers** that we supplied: the prompted questions with emoji-style voting, the Figma workstations with templated assets, the Discord text and voice channels to meet and communicate with collaborators.\n\nOne more ingredient that is worth adding explicitly to the mix is **incentives**. In these games, the incentives to play were simply to have fun. Naturally, these incentives can grow — from *having fun* and *making friends* to *owning something* and *making money* and *winning something* and *social signaling* etc.\n\n**It is with these ingredients that we can build games for *collective creation***. \n\nAs we build better and better games, with more exciting constraints and more sophisticated containers + incentives, it is my belief that we will reach e**scape velocity in co-creation**. We will get so good and symphonic at doing stuff together, that large swarms of people will begin to move together with the dexterity and agility of small groups of individuals — with the added leverage of more minds, more skills, more computers, more etc… \n\nThus the goal of a community like Songcamp is to build these games — and the ingredients therein — to reach unforeseen levels of co-creation. \n\n## Songcamp 2 as a Modestly Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game\n\n*Songcamp Genesis* took the format of an in-real-life songwriting camp and ported it online, with the added support of a visual team and release squad. \n\nWe attempted to solve the problem of a lot of songwriting camps — great songs are made but they don’t make it out the door. They get stuck living dormant on hard drives, and their true value is never realized. \n\nIf the goal is to make great art and share that art publicly, then there is an inherent problem with that game. For most songwriting camps, the game is to make a certain number of songs with a certain group of people in a certain amount of time. Then, the game ends. \n\nTo release that music through any funnel typical of the music industry, you are effectively entering an altogether different game — one where many people with many conflicting incentives are involved. And thus, a lot of music doesn’t make it out into the world. \n\nWhen we were running the first songcamp, many people asked a similar question around what this camp was *really* about — was it about collective creation, or was it about using web3 tools to carve out new value streams for the resulting artwork?\n\nMy answer was typically “*both*”.\n\nBut now my answer is changing. For I don’t think the two are separate at all. They are actually a lot more flush than we let on.\n\nMost music is created collaboratively. Creating music is a social experience. But legacy systems have squeezed that sense of co-creation out of public view. Again, due to incentives pushing us toward certain games. The game most artists are playing is a very independent one: build a personal artist brand, and tuck all the collaborative work it takes to build that brand underneath and out of view. \n\nMusic is also *experienced* collaboratively. Listening to music is a social experience, and for most of human history this was at the forefront. But so much of our online experience of music is quite siloed. We stream music in our own little algorithmic corners, without much sense of community related to our online music experiences. \n\n**So what if we could conjoin these collaborative experiences into one, and build a game that both artists and audiences can play together?**\n\nThe goal of web3 is not to financialize every little thing. It’s to *play better games*, where constraints, containers and incentives are designed to align a group of like-minded people so they can build a coherent shared vision. \n\nThis is what we will attempt with Songcamp 2 — a multiplayer game that blurs the lines between game-builder and game-player, between artist and audience, between owner and fan.\n\n### Join us would ya...\n\nWe're on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/songcamp_) + [Discord](url) + we're about to launch a **newsletter** so you should...\n\n", "timestamp": 1624291519, "digest": "yGNUV17mGvKcVmtuND680u6f4Cxv6e1ngTKxkuvOJ8Y", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

It’s been a while.* \n\n*Here’s what we’ve been up to the last few weeks, and how it’s helped shape our thinking around Songcamp 2 — which (btw) is imminently approaching.* \n\n*Thanks for being here. :)*\n\n# Squad Phone Experiments\n\nEvery Monday at 4pm ET, Songcamp has ***The Call*** — a 1-hour community-wide call on the squad phone voice channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wHsJD2sTpc). \n\nThis call has happened every single week for 12 weeks now, ever since Songcamp’s inception. (You can read our genesis story [here](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/K9i_cjk1zep0ESfu71Wj5by2zrHOIopAvZ5iSmDJYY0).)\n\nTypically this call is a time to talk general updates, answer questions, and introduce newcomers to our community. \n\nOver the last few weeks, however, our calls have taken on a different shape. \n\nIn the experimental nature that Songcamp was born with, we’ve started playing around with **making collective decisions** and **taking collective action** on these calls. \n\nWelcome to the *squad phone experiments*...\n\n### Experiment No.1 — The Vote\n\nThree weeks ago, we had our first vote. Up until then, our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/songcamp_) handle was @songcampdotband. It was long and hard to read quickly and we wanted a change. \n\nOn that week’s call, we supplied a list of 10 pre-populated name suggestions to get things rolling. We threw the list up on Discord and everyone on the call voted with emojis.. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c0f6a467-169e-4b2d-a63c-ec82aacbb73a.jpg?height=620&width=1188)\n\nThe short and sweet **@songcamp_** was the clear winner. \n\nNext, we prompted everyone to come up with their own handle suggestions to try and beat @songcamp_.\n\nIdeas started flooding the chat. We chose the ones that got some quick excitement (via comments and emoji reactions) and threw them in a second vote. The results were as follows: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/songcamp_/status/1399486989506912257\n\nThe process of making this decision together was a ton of fun. Just to see the emoji numbers shooting up, the alternative ideas populating the chat, people unmuting themselves and reacting to their favourites. The simple act of group participation created this vital and intimate energy, and we wanted more of it. \n\nSo the following week, we took it up a notch…\n\n### Experiment No. 2 — The Identicon Design Workshop\n\nI was very inspired by the [Pre-Brand x Zora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjczwDE9kmw) collective design event I participated in back in late 2020. I wanted to do something similar with Songcamp, where we’d all jump into a Figma design file together and co-create our Twitter avatar. \n\nThe idea was to give each participant on the call their own “workstation” to make something, and at the end of the call we’d smush all the pieces together to create one big Songcamp identicon.\n\nI spoke with Peace Node ([@](https://twitter.com/peace_node)) on the idea, and he thought we could each create our own pixelated identicon akin to Ethereum [blockies](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/vanity-blockie-miner-for-ethereum-902fccf0a427). I loved the idea. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f465223c-c6e1-4fe5-9108-a9eefe63e449.png?height=556&width=1515)\n\nWe went about creating 36 workstations in a Figma design file, each with its own blank 8x8 bit square. The instructions were to fill your identicon in with the Paint Fill tool, and write a sentence or two about your piece. We would then amalgamate everyone’s identicons into one big Songcamp identicon.\n\nHere’s what those workstations looked like:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a924d800-efc8-481d-8470-297b2a840273.png?height=920&width=1412)\n\nWhen our call started we gave some light instructions and dropped the [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/bZ6We4jHx8erQK3xYWLJkm/SONGCAMP-IDENTITY). What happened next was electric…\n\nColored mice started flying about the screen and everyone got to creating their piece. More and more people showed up in the file, and we had to create more workstations on the fly. \n\nBy the end, we had co-created a Songcamp identicon of ~ 60 personal identicons — each with their own flavors. What we ended up with was a mosaic of loud beauty that just screamed fun.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b0160420-4e8b-421a-bc0d-280b5be78785.jpg?height=1368&width=1718)\n\nhttps://twitter.com/matthewchaim/status/1402017697790148616\n\nThe energy during this experiment was palpable. The multi-colored mice flying across the screen, exuberant voices popping in and out of the voice chat, rainbows upon rainbows of kaleidoscopic goodness filling our eyes with every passing second. \n\nAs you can see, some people took the constraints given and “broke the rules” in fun and creative ways. One such piece ended up looking like the original 8x8 square had exploded in every direction..\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d89891be-2683-425a-9795-5d469ac64762.png?height=138&width=138)\n\nAnother fun element that arose organically during the event was a self-organizing swarm of “*helpers*”. People who knew Figma well and finished their pieces early on were quick to help when others expressed confusion or a need for assistance on the call. Before I could even find the workstation in need myself, 3 to 6 people had already shown up and solved the problem within seconds. This allowed beginners to participate just as easily as experts, and erased any requirement for “design skills” to take part. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0a334db2-a2bc-492b-8c39-9740f540bb71.png?height=1256&width=2036)\n\nWe went from *collective decision making* (voting) to *collective creation* (design), and now we were really on a roll. So on our next call, we brought it up a level yet again…\n\n\n### Experiment No. 3 — The Minicamp\n\nTo see how much art we could create as a group in such a short amount of time really got the wheels turning…\n\n*We were able to create 60 identicons in less than an hour together. What if we could run a songcamp in less than an hour?*\n\nThe following Monday we decided to try and answer that question. \n\nSince we didn’t know who would be showing up to the call, and whether or not they would have access to audio or visual production tools, we started with a few votes to read the room…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/19fa6fa2-17a4-4cb2-ab33-5044cc9658fa.png?height=726&width=1664)\n\nWe threw the above question up and asked for honest responses to get a feel if running this minicamp was realistic. As you can see, most said *No* — meaning they either couldn’t or didn’t want to participate in an impromptu songcamp. \n\nHowever, 16 affirmative answers seemed like enough potential participants to warrant the next question…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9e450eed-1525-4b43-97a0-73ef4b454a81.png?height=442&width=1038)\n\nSince we had figured beforehand that running ~3 rooms would be ideal, this worked out perfectly. \n\nWe quickly organized text and voice channels for 3 rooms — each populated with 1 or 2 producers, a vocalist, and 1 or 2 visual artists. \n\nEach group was given the following explicit constraint: **the task here is not to make *great* art. It is to make art in 40 minutes.**\n\nWhile each team got to work, the rest of us discussed ideas of what we could do with the resulting artwork. \n\nAdrian Tavares ([@](https://twitter.com/AdrianRicard0)) had the great idea of creating this [brainstorming prompt](https://app.sli.do/event/wk2wmmpu/live/ideas) on the app Slido, where we could all throw in ideas anonymously and vote on them. This helped get the juices flowing, and we threw around some fun possibilities. \n\nBecause the results of this short art-making experiment were so unknown, we didn’t come to any clear plan. It instead kicked us into some interesting conversations around the sanctity of the creative process.\n\nWhen the 40 minutes were up, the teams were asked to return to the main call and share the minisongs and cover artworks they’d created. Here’s what they made… \n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76900ebe-55b7-4aeb-9015-29b14cfd8ca2.png?height=1140&width=1140)](https://audius.co/songcamp/soma-440783)\n\nListen to [\"SOMA\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/soma-440783)\n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/377c24d9-d694-4eeb-b264-a458456d3841.jpg?height=1080&width=1080)](https://audius.co/songcamp/golden-hour-440784)\n\nListen to [\"Golden Hour\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/golden-hour-440784)\n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8455715a-1028-4338-b16d-31fc7f03a12b.png?height=1080&width=1080)](https://audius.co/songcamp/in-a-rush-440790)\n\nListen to [\"In A Rush\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/in-a-rush-440790)\n\nSuffice to say, we were all blown away. \n\nIn 40 minutes, they all created sprouting songs that each held such beautiful power and potential. The cover artworks also encapsulated that improvised energy and beauty. \n\nWe couldn’t believe they’d gone from strangers, to collaborators who could make something so resonant in well under an hour. \n\nThis experiment wasn’t to determine how quickly art can be made. Rest assured we want to create space for collective creation to be baked in its own time. But it was once again super fun to see people show up with no prior knowledge of the plan, and throw down like this on a random Monday afternoon. \n\nThe energy to make art together is very much *here*. \n\n## Constraints, Containers and Games\n\nIn all 3 of these *squad phone experiments*, we essentially built little **games** that we could play together. \n\nAll of them have their own **constraints** — parameters that close the loop and let us reach a desired result. These constraints are time-bound, scope-bound, and space-bound... *vote on these 10 things, make this 8x8 thing on Figma, make a minisong in 40 minutes*. \n\nThey also each rely on the **containers** that we supplied: the prompted questions with emoji-style voting, the Figma workstations with templated assets, the Discord text and voice channels to meet and communicate with collaborators.\n\nOne more ingredient that is worth adding explicitly to the mix is **incentives**. In these games, the incentives to play were simply to have fun. Naturally, these incentives can grow — from *having fun* and *making friends* to *owning something* and *making money* and *winning something* and *social signaling* etc.\n\n**It is with these ingredients that we can build games for *collective creation***. \n\nAs we build better and better games, with more exciting constraints and more sophisticated containers + incentives, it is my belief that we will reach e**scape velocity in co-creation**. We will get so good and symphonic at doing stuff together, that large swarms of people will begin to move together with the dexterity and agility of small groups of individuals — with the added leverage of more minds, more skills, more computers, more etc… \n\nThus the goal of a community like Songcamp is to build these games — and the ingredients therein — to reach unforeseen levels of co-creation. \n\n## Songcamp 2 as a Modestly Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game\n\n*Songcamp Genesis* took the format of an in-real-life songwriting camp and ported it online, with the added support of a visual team and release squad. \n\nWe attempted to solve the problem of a lot of songwriting camps — great songs are made but they don’t make it out the door. They get stuck living dormant on hard drives, and their true value is never realized. \n\nIf the goal is to make great art and share that art publicly, then there is an inherent problem with that game. For most songwriting camps, the game is to make a certain number of songs with a certain group of people in a certain amount of time. Then, the game ends. \n\nTo release that music through any funnel typical of the music industry, you are effectively entering an altogether different game — one where many people with many conflicting incentives are involved. And thus, a lot of music doesn’t make it out into the world. \n\nWhen we were running the first songcamp, many people asked a similar question around what this camp was *really* about — was it about collective creation, or was it about using web3 tools to carve out new value streams for the resulting artwork?\n\nMy answer was typically “*both*”.\n\nBut now my answer is changing. For I don’t think the two are separate at all. They are actually a lot more flush than we let on.\n\nMost music is created collaboratively. Creating music is a social experience. But legacy systems have squeezed that sense of co-creation out of public view. Again, due to incentives pushing us toward certain games. The game most artists are playing is a very independent one: build a personal artist brand, and tuck all the collaborative work it takes to build that brand underneath and out of view. \n\nMusic is also *experienced* collaboratively. Listening to music is a social experience, and for most of human history this was at the forefront. But so much of our online experience of music is quite siloed. We stream music in our own little algorithmic corners, without much sense of community related to our online music experiences. \n\n**So what if we could conjoin these collaborative experiences into one, and build a game that both artists and audiences can play together?**\n\nThe goal of web3 is not to financialize every little thing. It’s to *play better games*, where constraints, containers and incentives are designed to align a group of like-minded people so they can build a coherent shared vision. \n\nThis is what we will attempt with Songcamp 2 — a multiplayer game that blurs the lines between game-builder and game-player, between artist and audience, between owner and fan.\n\n### Join us would ya...\n\nWe're on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/songcamp_) + [Discord](url) + we're about to launch a **newsletter** so you should...\n\n", "timestamp": 1624292033, "digest": "yGNUV17mGvKcVmtuND680u6f4Cxv6e1ngTKxkuvOJ8Y", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

And thus, a lot of music doesn’t make it out into the world. \n\nWhen we were running the first songcamp, many people asked a similar question around what this camp was *really* about — was it about collective creation, or was it about using web3 tools to carve out new value streams for the resulting artwork?\n\nMy answer was typically “*both*”.\n\nBut now my answer is changing. For I don’t think the two are separate at all. They are actually a lot more flush than we let on.\n\nMost music is created collaboratively. Creating music is a social experience. But legacy systems have squeezed that sense of co-creation out of public view. Again, due to incentives pushing us toward certain games. The game most artists are playing is a very independent one: build a personal artist brand, and tuck all the collaborative work it takes to build that brand underneath and out of view. \n\nMusic is also *experienced* collaboratively. Listening to music is a social experience, and for most of human history this was at the forefront. But so much of our online experience of music is quite siloed. We stream music in our own little algorithmic corners, without much sense of community related to our online music experiences. \n\n**So what if we could conjoin these collaborative experiences into one, and build a game that both artists and audiences can play together?**\n\nThe goal of web3 is not to financialize every little thing. It’s to *play better games*, where constraints, containers and incentives are designed to align a group of like-minded people so they can build a coherent shared vision. \n\nThis is what we will attempt with Songcamp 2 — a multiplayer game that blurs the lines between game-builder and game-player, between artist and audience, between owner and fan.\n\n### Join us would ya...\n\nWe're on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/songcamp_) + [Discord](url) + we're about to launch a **newsletter** so you should...\n\n", "timestamp": 1624291953, "digest": "yGNUV17mGvKcVmtuND680u6f4Cxv6e1ngTKxkuvOJ8Y", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

It’s been a while.* \n\n*Here’s what we’ve been up to the last few weeks, and how it’s helped shape our thinking around Songcamp 2 — which (btw) is imminently approaching.* \n\n*Thanks for being here. :)*\n\n# Squad Phone Experiments\n\nEvery Monday at 4pm ET, Songcamp has ***The Call*** — a 1-hour community-wide call on the squad phone voice channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wHsJD2sTpc). \n\nThis call has happened every single week for 12 weeks now, ever since Songcamp’s inception. (You can read our genesis story [here](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/K9i_cjk1zep0ESfu71Wj5by2zrHOIopAvZ5iSmDJYY0).)\n\nTypically this call is a time to talk general updates, answer questions, and introduce newcomers to our community. \n\nOver the last few weeks, however, our calls have taken on a different shape. \n\nIn the experimental nature that Songcamp was born with, we’ve started playing around with **making collective decisions** and **taking collective action** on these calls. \n\nWelcome to the *squad phone experiments*...\n\n### Experiment No.1 — The Vote\n\nThree weeks ago, we had our first vote. Up until then, our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/songcamp_) handle was @songcampdotband. It was long and hard to read quickly and we wanted a change. \n\nOn that week’s call, we supplied a list of 10 pre-populated name suggestions to get things rolling. We threw the list up on Discord and everyone on the call voted with emojis.. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c0f6a467-169e-4b2d-a63c-ec82aacbb73a.jpg?height=620&width=1188)\n\nThe short and sweet **@songcamp_** was the clear winner. \n\nNext, we prompted everyone to come up with their own handle suggestions to try and beat @songcamp_.\n\nIdeas started flooding the chat. We chose the ones that got some quick excitement (via comments and emoji reactions) and threw them in a second vote. The results were as follows: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/songcamp_/status/1399486989506912257\n\nThe process of making this decision together was a ton of fun. Just to see the emoji numbers shooting up, the alternative ideas populating the chat, people unmuting themselves and reacting to their favourites. The simple act of group participation created this vital and intimate energy, and we wanted more of it. \n\nSo the following week, we took it up a notch…\n\n### Experiment No. 2 — The Identicon Design Workshop\n\nI was very inspired by the [Pre-Brand x Zora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjczwDE9kmw) collective design event I participated in back in late 2020. I wanted to do something similar with Songcamp, where we’d all jump into a Figma design file together and co-create our Twitter avatar. \n\nThe idea was to give each participant on the call their own “workstation” to make something, and at the end of the call we’d smush all the pieces together to create one big Songcamp identicon.\n\nI spoke with Peace Node ([@](https://twitter.com/peace_node)) on the idea, and he thought we could each create our own pixelated identicon akin to Ethereum [blockies](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/vanity-blockie-miner-for-ethereum-902fccf0a427). I loved the idea. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f465223c-c6e1-4fe5-9108-a9eefe63e449.png?height=556&width=1515)\n\nWe went about creating 36 workstations in a Figma design file, each with its own blank 8x8 bit square. The instructions were to fill your identicon in with the Paint Fill tool, and write a sentence or two about your piece. We would then amalgamate everyone’s identicons into one big Songcamp identicon.\n\nHere’s what those workstations looked like:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a924d800-efc8-481d-8470-297b2a840273.png?height=920&width=1412)\n\nWhen our call started we gave some light instructions and dropped the [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/bZ6We4jHx8erQK3xYWLJkm/SONGCAMP-IDENTITY). What happened next was electric…\n\nColored mice started flying about the screen and everyone got to creating their piece. More and more people showed up in the file, and we had to create more workstations on the fly. \n\nBy the end, we had co-created a Songcamp identicon of ~ 60 personal identicons — each with their own flavors. What we ended up with was a mosaic of loud beauty that just screamed fun.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b0160420-4e8b-421a-bc0d-280b5be78785.jpg?height=1368&width=1718)\n\nhttps://twitter.com/matthewchaim/status/1402017697790148616\n\nThe energy during this experiment was palpable. The multi-colored mice flying across the screen, exuberant voices popping in and out of the voice chat, rainbows upon rainbows of kaleidoscopic goodness filling our eyes with every passing second. \n\nAs you can see, some people took the constraints given and “broke the rules” in fun and creative ways. One such piece ended up looking like the original 8x8 square had exploded in every direction..\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d89891be-2683-425a-9795-5d469ac64762.png?height=138&width=138)\n\nAnother fun element that arose organically during the event was a self-organizing swarm of “*helpers*”. People who knew Figma well and finished their pieces early on were quick to help when others expressed confusion or a need for assistance on the call. Before I could even find the workstation in need myself, 3 to 6 people had already shown up and solved the problem within seconds. This allowed beginners to participate just as easily as experts, and erased any requirement for “design skills” to take part. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0a334db2-a2bc-492b-8c39-9740f540bb71.png?height=1256&width=2036)\n\nWe went from *collective decision making* (voting) to *collective creation* (design), and now we were really on a roll. So on our next call, we brought it up a level yet again…\n\n\n### Experiment No. 3 — The Minicamp\n\nTo see how much art we could create as a group in such a short amount of time really got the wheels turning…\n\n*We were able to create 60 identicons in less than an hour together. What if we could run a songcamp in less than an hour?*\n\nThe following Monday we decided to try and answer that question. \n\nSince we didn’t know who would be showing up to the call, and whether or not they would have access to audio or visual production tools, we started with a few votes to read the room…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/19fa6fa2-17a4-4cb2-ab33-5044cc9658fa.png?height=726&width=1664)\n\nWe threw the above question up and asked for honest responses to get a feel if running this minicamp was realistic. As you can see, most said *No* — meaning they either couldn’t or didn’t want to participate in an impromptu songcamp. \n\nHowever, 16 affirmative answers seemed like enough potential participants to warrant the next question…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9e450eed-1525-4b43-97a0-73ef4b454a81.png?height=442&width=1038)\n\nSince we had figured beforehand that running ~3 rooms would be ideal, this worked out perfectly. \n\nWe quickly organized text and voice channels for 3 rooms — each populated with 1 or 2 producers, a vocalist, and 1 or 2 visual artists. \n\nEach group was given the following explicit constraint: **the task here is not to make *great* art. It is to make art in 40 minutes.**\n\nWhile each team got to work, the rest of us discussed ideas of what we could do with the resulting artwork. \n\nAdrian Tavares ([@](https://twitter.com/AdrianRicard0)) had the great idea of creating this [brainstorming prompt](https://app.sli.do/event/wk2wmmpu/live/ideas) on the app Slido, where we could all throw in ideas anonymously and vote on them. This helped get the juices flowing, and we threw around some fun possibilities. \n\nBecause the results of this short art-making experiment were so unknown, we didn’t come to any clear plan. It instead kicked us into some interesting conversations around the sanctity of the creative process.\n\nWhen the 40 minutes were up, the teams were asked to return to the main call and share the minisongs and cover artworks they’d created. Here’s what they made… \n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76900ebe-55b7-4aeb-9015-29b14cfd8ca2.png?height=1140&width=1140)](https://audius.co/songcamp/soma-440783)\n\nListen to [\"SOMA\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/soma-440783)\n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/377c24d9-d694-4eeb-b264-a458456d3841.jpg?height=1080&width=1080)](https://audius.co/songcamp/golden-hour-440784)\n\nListen to [\"Golden Hour\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/golden-hour-440784)\n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8455715a-1028-4338-b16d-31fc7f03a12b.png?height=1080&width=1080)](https://audius.co/songcamp/in-a-rush-440790)\n\nListen to [\"In A Rush\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/in-a-rush-440790)\n\nSuffice to say, we were all blown away. \n\nIn 40 minutes, they all created sprouting songs that each held such beautiful power and potential. The cover artworks also encapsulated that improvised energy and beauty. \n\nWe couldn’t believe they’d gone from strangers, to collaborators who could make something so resonant in well under an hour. \n\nThis experiment wasn’t to determine how quickly art can be made. Rest assured we want to create space for collective creation to be baked in its own time. But it was once again super fun to see people show up with no prior knowledge of the plan, and throw down like this on a random Monday afternoon. \n\nThe energy to make art together is very much *here*. \n\n## Constraints, Containers and Games\n\nIn all 3 of these *squad phone experiments*, we essentially built little **games** that we could play together. \n\nAll of them have their own **constraints** — parameters that close the loop and let us reach a desired result. These constraints are time-bound, scope-bound, and space-bound... *vote on these 10 things, make this 8x8 thing on Figma, make a minisong in 40 minutes*. \n\nThey also each rely on the **containers** that we supplied: the prompted questions with emoji-style voting, the Figma workstations with templated assets, the Discord text and voice channels to meet and communicate with collaborators.\n\nOne more ingredient that is worth adding explicitly to the mix is **incentives**. In these games, the incentives to play were simply to have fun. Naturally, these incentives can grow — from *having fun* and *making friends* to *owning something* and *making money* and *winning something* and *social signaling* etc.\n\n**It is with these ingredients that we can build games for *collective creation***. \n\nAs we build better and better games, with more exciting constraints and more sophisticated containers + incentives, it is my belief that we will reach e**scape velocity in co-creation**. We will get so good and symphonic at doing stuff together, that large swarms of people will begin to move together with the dexterity and agility of small groups of individuals — with the added leverage of more minds, more skills, more computers, more etc… \n\nThus the goal of a community like Songcamp is to build these games — and the ingredients therein — to reach unforeseen levels of co-creation. \n\n## Songcamp 2 as a Modestly Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game\n\n*Songcamp Genesis* took the format of an in-real-life songwriting camp and ported it online, with the added support of a visual team and release squad. \n\nWe attempted to solve the problem of a lot of songwriting camps — great songs are made but they don’t make it out the door. They get stuck living dormant on hard drives, and their true value is never realized. \n\nIf the goal is to make great art and share that art publicly, then there is an inherent problem with that game. For most songwriting camps, the game is to make a certain number of songs with a certain group of people in a certain amount of time. Then, the game ends. \n\nTo release that music through any funnel typical of the music industry, you are effectively entering an altogether different game — one where many people with many conflicting incentives are involved. And thus, a lot of music doesn’t make it out into the world. \n\nWhen we were running the first songcamp, many people asked a similar question around what this camp was *really* about — was it about collective creation, or was it about using web3 tools to carve out new value streams for the resulting artwork?\n\nMy answer was typically “*both*”.\n\nBut now my answer is changing. For I don’t think the two are separate at all. They are actually a lot more flush than we let on.\n\nMost music is created collaboratively. Creating music is a social experience. But legacy systems have squeezed that sense of co-creation out of public view. Again, due to incentives pushing us toward certain games. The game most artists are playing is a very independent one: build a personal artist brand, and tuck all the collaborative work it takes to build that brand underneath and out of view. \n\nMusic is also *experienced* collaboratively. Listening to music is a social experience, and for most of human history this was at the forefront. But so much of our online experience of music is quite siloed.

Naturally, these incentives can grow — from *having fun* and *making friends* to *owning something* and *making money* and *winning something* and *social signaling* etc.\n\n**It is with these ingredients that we can build games for *collective creation***. \n\nAs we build better and better games, with more exciting constraints and more sophisticated containers + incentives, it is my belief that we will reach e**scape velocity in co-creation**. We will get so good and symphonic at doing stuff together, that large swarms of people will begin to move together with the dexterity and agility of small groups of individuals — with the added leverage of more minds, more skills, more computers, more etc… \n\nThus the goal of a community like Songcamp is to build these games — and the ingredients therein — to reach unforeseen levels of co-creation. \n\n## Songcamp 2 as a Modestly Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game\n\n*Songcamp Genesis* took the format of an in-real-life songwriting camp and ported it online, with the added support of a visual team and release squad. \n\nWe attempted to solve the problem of a lot of songwriting camps — great songs are made but they don’t make it out the door. They get stuck living dormant on hard drives, and their true value is never realized. \n\nIf the goal is to make great art and share that art publicly, then there is an inherent problem with that game. For most songwriting camps, the game is to make a certain number of songs with a certain group of people in a certain amount of time. Then, the game ends. \n\nTo release that music through any funnel typical of the music industry, you are effectively entering an altogether different game — one where many people with many conflicting incentives are involved. And thus, a lot of music doesn’t make it out into the world. \n\nWhen we were running the first songcamp, many people asked a similar question around what this camp was *really* about — was it about collective creation, or was it about using web3 tools to carve out new value streams for the resulting artwork?\n\nMy answer was typically “*both*”.\n\nBut now my answer is changing. For I don’t think the two are separate at all. They are actually a lot more flush than we let on.\n\nMost music is created collaboratively. Creating music is a social experience. But legacy systems have squeezed that sense of co-creation out of public view. Again, due to incentives pushing us toward certain games. The game most artists are playing is a very independent one: build a personal artist brand, and tuck all the collaborative work it takes to build that brand underneath and out of view. \n\nMusic is also *experienced* collaboratively. Listening to music is a social experience, and for most of human history this was at the forefront. But so much of our online experience of music is quite siloed. We stream music in our own little algorithmic corners, without much sense of community related to our online music experiences. \n\n**So what if we could conjoin these collaborative experiences into one, and build a game that both artists and audiences can play together?**\n\nThe goal of web3 is not to financialize every little thing. It’s to *play better games*, where constraints, containers and incentives are designed to align a group of like-minded people so they can build a coherent shared vision. \n\nThis is what we will attempt with Songcamp 2 — a multiplayer game that blurs the lines between game-builder and game-player, between artist and audience, between owner and fan.\n\n### Join us would ya...\n\nWe're on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/songcamp_) + [Discord](url) + we're about to launch a **newsletter**, so you should...\n\n", "timestamp": 1624292845, "digest": "yGNUV17mGvKcVmtuND680u6f4Cxv6e1ngTKxkuvOJ8Y", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

It’s been a while.* \n\n*Here’s what we’ve been up to the last few weeks, and how it’s helped shape our thinking around Songcamp 2 — which (btw) is imminently approaching.* \n\n*Thanks for being here. :)*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0264aab7-4769-4b20-88ab-9e1968de0253.png?height=1234&width=1886)\n\n# Squad Phone Experiments\n\nEvery Monday at 4pm ET, Songcamp has ***The Call*** — a 1-hour community-wide call on the squad phone voice channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wHsJD2sTpc). \n\nThis call has happened every single week for 12 weeks now, ever since Songcamp’s inception. (You can read our genesis story [here](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/K9i_cjk1zep0ESfu71Wj5by2zrHOIopAvZ5iSmDJYY0).)\n\nTypically this call is a time to talk general updates, answer questions, and introduce newcomers to our community. \n\nOver the last few weeks, however, our calls have taken on a different shape. \n\nIn the experimental nature that Songcamp was born with, we’ve started playing around with **making collective decisions** and **taking collective action** on these calls. \n\nWelcome to the *squad phone experiments*...\n\n### Experiment No.1 — The Vote\n\nThree weeks ago, we had our first vote. Up until then, our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/songcamp_) handle was @songcampdotband. It was long and hard to read quickly and we wanted a change. \n\nOn that week’s call, we supplied a list of 10 pre-populated name suggestions to get things rolling. We threw the list up on Discord and everyone on the call voted with emojis.. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c0f6a467-169e-4b2d-a63c-ec82aacbb73a.jpg?height=620&width=1188)\n\nThe short and sweet **@songcamp_** was the clear winner. \n\nNext, we prompted everyone to come up with their own handle suggestions to try and beat @songcamp_.\n\nIdeas started flooding the chat. We chose the ones that got some quick excitement (via comments and emoji reactions) and threw them in a second vote. The results were as follows: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/songcamp_/status/1399486989506912257\n\nThe process of making this decision together was a ton of fun. Just to see the emoji numbers shooting up, the alternative ideas populating the chat, people unmuting themselves and reacting to their favourites. The simple act of group participation created this vital and intimate energy, and we wanted more of it. \n\nSo the following week, we took it up a notch…\n\n### Experiment No. 2 — The Identicon Design Workshop\n\nI was very inspired by the [Pre-Brand x Zora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjczwDE9kmw) collective design event I participated in back in late 2020. I wanted to do something similar with Songcamp, where we’d all jump into a Figma design file together and co-create our Twitter avatar. \n\nThe idea was to give each participant on the call their own “workstation” to make something, and at the end of the call we’d smush all the pieces together to create one big Songcamp identicon.\n\nI spoke with Peace Node ([@](https://twitter.com/peace_node)) on the idea, and he thought we could each create our own pixelated identicon akin to Ethereum [blockies](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/vanity-blockie-miner-for-ethereum-902fccf0a427). I loved the idea. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f465223c-c6e1-4fe5-9108-a9eefe63e449.png?height=556&width=1515)\n\nWe went about creating 36 workstations in a Figma design file, each with its own blank 8x8 bit square. The instructions were to fill your identicon in with the Paint Fill tool, and write a sentence or two about your piece. We would then amalgamate everyone’s identicons into one big Songcamp identicon.\n\nHere’s what those workstations looked like:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a924d800-efc8-481d-8470-297b2a840273.png?height=920&width=1412)\n\nWhen our call started we gave some light instructions and dropped the [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/bZ6We4jHx8erQK3xYWLJkm/SONGCAMP-IDENTITY). What happened next was electric…\n\nColored mice started flying about the screen and everyone got to creating their piece. More and more people showed up in the file, and we had to create more workstations on the fly. \n\nBy the end, we had co-created a Songcamp identicon of ~ 60 personal identicons — each with their own flavors. What we ended up with was a mosaic of loud beauty that just screamed fun.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b0160420-4e8b-421a-bc0d-280b5be78785.jpg?height=1368&width=1718)\n\nhttps://twitter.com/matthewchaim/status/1402017697790148616\n\nThe energy during this experiment was palpable. The multi-colored mice flying across the screen, exuberant voices popping in and out of the voice chat, rainbows upon rainbows of kaleidoscopic goodness filling our eyes with every passing second. \n\nAs you can see, some people took the constraints given and “broke the rules” in fun and creative ways. One such piece ended up looking like the original 8x8 square had exploded in every direction..\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d89891be-2683-425a-9795-5d469ac64762.png?height=138&width=138)\n\nAnother fun element that arose organically during the event was a self-organizing swarm of “*helpers*”. People who knew Figma well and finished their pieces early on were quick to help when others expressed confusion or a need for assistance on the call. Before I could even find the workstation in need myself, 3 to 6 people had already shown up and solved the problem within seconds. This allowed beginners to participate just as easily as experts, and erased any requirement for “design skills” to take part. \n\nWe went from *collective decision making* (voting) to *collective creation* (design), and now we were really on a roll. So on our next call, we brought it up a level yet again…\n\n\n### Experiment No. 3 — The Minicamp\n\nTo see how much art we could create as a group in such a short amount of time really got the wheels turning…\n\n*We were able to create 60 identicons in less than an hour together. What if we could run a songcamp in less than an hour?*\n\nThe following Monday we decided to try and answer that question. \n\nSince we didn’t know who would be showing up to the call, and whether or not they would have access to audio or visual production tools, we started with a few votes to read the room…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/19fa6fa2-17a4-4cb2-ab33-5044cc9658fa.png?height=726&width=1664)\n\nWe threw the above question up and asked for honest responses to get a feel if running this minicamp was realistic. As you can see, most said *No* — meaning they either couldn’t or didn’t want to participate in an impromptu songcamp. \n\nHowever, 16 affirmative answers seemed like enough potential participants to warrant the next question…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9e450eed-1525-4b43-97a0-73ef4b454a81.png?height=442&width=1038)\n\nSince we had figured beforehand that running ~3 rooms would be ideal, this worked out perfectly. \n\nWe quickly organized text and voice channels for 3 rooms — each populated with 1 or 2 producers, a vocalist, and 1 or 2 visual artists. \n\nEach group was given the following explicit constraint: **the task here is not to make *great* art. It is to make art in 40 minutes.**\n\nWhile each team got to work, the rest of us discussed ideas of what we could do with the resulting artwork. \n\nAdrian Tavares ([@](https://twitter.com/AdrianRicard0)) had the great idea of creating this [brainstorming prompt](https://app.sli.do/event/wk2wmmpu/live/ideas) on the app Slido, where we could all throw in ideas anonymously and vote on them. This helped get the juices flowing, and we threw around some fun possibilities. \n\nBecause the results of this short art-making experiment were so unknown, we didn’t come to any clear plan. It instead kicked us into some interesting conversations around the sanctity of the creative process.\n\nWhen the 40 minutes were up, the teams were asked to return to the main call and share the minisongs and cover artworks they’d created. Here’s what they made… \n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76900ebe-55b7-4aeb-9015-29b14cfd8ca2.png?height=1140&width=1140)](https://audius.co/songcamp/soma-440783)\n\nListen to [\"SOMA\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/soma-440783)\n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/377c24d9-d694-4eeb-b264-a458456d3841.jpg?height=1080&width=1080)](https://audius.co/songcamp/golden-hour-440784)\n\nListen to [\"Golden Hour\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/golden-hour-440784)\n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8455715a-1028-4338-b16d-31fc7f03a12b.png?height=1080&width=1080)](https://audius.co/songcamp/in-a-rush-440790)\n\nListen to [\"In A Rush\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/in-a-rush-440790)\n\nSuffice to say, we were all blown away. \n\nIn 40 minutes, they all created sprouting songs that each held such beautiful power and potential. The cover artworks also encapsulated that improvised energy and beauty. \n\nWe couldn’t believe they’d gone from strangers, to collaborators who could make something so resonant in well under an hour. \n\nThis experiment wasn’t to determine how quickly art can be made. Rest assured we want to create space for collective creation to be baked in its own time. But it was once again super fun to see people show up with no prior knowledge of the plan, and throw down like this on a random Monday afternoon. \n\nThe energy to make art together is very much *here*. \n\n## Constraints, Containers and Games\n\nIn all 3 of these *squad phone experiments*, we essentially built little **games** that we could play together. \n\nAll of them have their own **constraints** — parameters that close the loop and let us reach a desired result. These constraints are time-bound, scope-bound, and space-bound... *vote on these 10 things, make this 8x8 thing on Figma, make a minisong in 40 minutes*. \n\nThey also each rely on the **containers** that we supplied: the prompted questions with emoji-style voting, the Figma workstations with templated assets, the Discord text and voice channels to meet and communicate with collaborators.\n\nOne more ingredient that is worth adding explicitly to the mix is **incentives**. In these games, the incentives to play were simply to have fun. Naturally, these incentives can grow — from *having fun* and *making friends* to *owning something* and *making money* and *winning something* and *social signaling* etc.\n\n**It is with these ingredients that we can build games for *collective creation***. \n\nAs we build better and better games, with more exciting constraints and more sophisticated containers + incentives, it is my belief that we will reach e**scape velocity in co-creation**. We will get so good and symphonic at doing stuff together, that large swarms of people will begin to move together with the dexterity and agility of small groups of individuals — with the added leverage of more minds, more skills, more computers, more etc… \n\nThus the goal of a community like Songcamp is to build these games — and the ingredients therein — to reach unforeseen levels of co-creation. \n\n## Songcamp 2 as a Modestly Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game\n\n*Songcamp Genesis* took the format of an in-real-life songwriting camp and ported it online, with the added support of a visual team and release squad. \n\nWe attempted to solve the problem of a lot of songwriting camps — great songs are made but they don’t make it out the door.

Here’s what they made… \n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76900ebe-55b7-4aeb-9015-29b14cfd8ca2.png?height=1140&width=1140)](https://audius.co/songcamp/soma-440783)\n\nListen to [\"SOMA\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/soma-440783)\n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/377c24d9-d694-4eeb-b264-a458456d3841.jpg?height=1080&width=1080)](https://audius.co/songcamp/golden-hour-440784)\n\nListen to [\"Golden Hour\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/golden-hour-440784)\n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8455715a-1028-4338-b16d-31fc7f03a12b.png?height=1080&width=1080)](https://audius.co/songcamp/in-a-rush-440790)\n\nListen to [\"In A Rush\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/in-a-rush-440790)\n\nSuffice to say, we were all blown away. \n\nIn 40 minutes, they all created sprouting songs that each held such beautiful power and potential. The cover artworks also encapsulated that improvised energy and beauty. \n\nWe couldn’t believe they’d gone from strangers, to collaborators who could make something so resonant in well under an hour. \n\nThis experiment wasn’t to determine how quickly art can be made. Rest assured we want to create space for collective creation to be baked in its own time. But it was once again super fun to see people show up with no prior knowledge of the plan, and throw down like this on a random Monday afternoon. \n\nThe energy to make art together is very much *here*. \n\n## Constraints, Containers and Games\n\nIn all 3 of these *squad phone experiments*, we essentially built little **games** that we could play together. \n\nAll of them have their own **constraints** — parameters that close the loop and let us reach a desired result. These constraints are time-bound, scope-bound, and space-bound... *vote on these 10 things, make this 8x8 thing on Figma, make a minisong in 40 minutes*. \n\nThey also each rely on the **containers** that we supplied: the prompted questions with emoji-style voting, the Figma workstations with templated assets, the Discord text and voice channels to meet and communicate with collaborators.\n\nOne more ingredient that is worth adding explicitly to the mix is **incentives**. In these games, the incentives to play were simply to have fun. Naturally, these incentives can grow — from *having fun* and *making friends* to *owning something* and *making money* and *winning something* and *social signaling* etc.\n\n**It is with these ingredients that we can build games for *collective creation***. \n\nAs we build better and better games, with more exciting constraints and more sophisticated containers + incentives, it is my belief that we will reach e**scape velocity in co-creation**. We will get so good and symphonic at doing stuff together, that large swarms of people will begin to move together with the dexterity and agility of small groups of individuals — with the added leverage of more minds, more skills, more computers, more etc… \n\nThus the goal of a community like Songcamp is to build these games — and the ingredients therein — to reach unforeseen levels of co-creation. \n\n## Songcamp 2 as a Modestly Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game\n\n*Songcamp Genesis* took the format of an in-real-life songwriting camp and ported it online, with the added support of a visual team and release squad. \n\nWe attempted to solve the problem of a lot of songwriting camps — great songs are made but they don’t make it out the door. They get stuck living dormant on hard drives, and their true value is never realized. \n\nIf the goal is to make great art and share that art publicly, then there is an inherent problem with that game. For most songwriting camps, the game is to make a certain number of songs with a certain group of people in a certain amount of time. Then, the game ends. \n\nTo release that music through any funnel typical of the music industry, you are effectively entering an altogether different game — one where many people with many conflicting incentives are involved. And thus, a lot of music doesn’t make it out into the world. \n\nWhen we were running the first songcamp, many people asked a similar question around what this camp was *really* about — was it about collective creation, or was it about using web3 tools to carve out new value streams for the resulting artwork?\n\nMy answer was typically “*both*”.\n\nBut now my answer is changing. For I don’t think the two are separate at all. They are actually a lot more flush than we let on.\n\nMost music is created collaboratively. Creating music is a social experience. But legacy systems have squeezed that sense of co-creation out of public view. Again, due to incentives pushing us toward certain games. The game most artists are playing is a very independent one: build a personal artist brand, and tuck all the collaborative work it takes to build that brand underneath and out of view. \n\nMusic is also *experienced* collaboratively. Listening to music is a social experience, and for most of human history this was at the forefront. But so much of our online experience of music is quite siloed. We stream music in our own little algorithmic corners, without much sense of community related to our online music experiences. \n\n**So what if we could conjoin these collaborative experiences into one, and build a game that both artists and audiences can play together?**\n\nThe goal of web3 is not to financialize every little thing. It’s to *play better games*, where constraints, containers and incentives are designed to align a group of like-minded people so they can build a coherent shared vision. \n\nThis is what we will attempt with Songcamp 2 — a multiplayer game that blurs the lines between game-builder and game-player, between artist and audience, between owner and fan.\n\n### Join us would ya...\n\nWe're on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/songcamp_) + [Discord](url) + we're about to launch a **newsletter**, so you should...\n\n", "timestamp": 1624293840, "digest": "yGNUV17mGvKcVmtuND680u6f4Cxv6e1ngTKxkuvOJ8Y", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

It’s been a while.* \n\n*Here’s what we’ve been up to the last few weeks, and how it’s helped shape our thinking around Songcamp 2 — which (btw) is imminently approaching.* \n\n*Thanks for being here. :)*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7cdcd2be-f1b5-49b4-b808-bc60a15b18f8.jpg?height=1151&width=2047)\n\n# Squad Phone Experiments\n\nEvery Monday at 4pm ET, Songcamp has ***The Call*** — a 1-hour community-wide call on the squad phone voice channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wHsJD2sTpc). \n\nThis call has happened every single week for 12 weeks now, ever since Songcamp’s inception. (You can read our genesis story [here](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/K9i_cjk1zep0ESfu71Wj5by2zrHOIopAvZ5iSmDJYY0).)\n\nTypically this call is a time to talk general updates, answer questions, and introduce newcomers to our community. \n\nOver the last few weeks, however, our calls have taken on a different shape. \n\nIn the experimental nature that Songcamp was born with, we’ve started playing around with **making collective decisions** and **taking collective action** on these calls. \n\nWelcome to the *squad phone experiments*...\n\n### Experiment No.1 — The Vote\n\nThree weeks ago, we had our first vote. Up until then, our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/songcamp_) handle was @songcampdotband. It was long and hard to read quickly and we wanted a change. \n\nOn that week’s call, we supplied a list of 10 pre-populated name suggestions to get things rolling. We threw the list up on Discord and everyone on the call voted with emojis.. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c0f6a467-169e-4b2d-a63c-ec82aacbb73a.jpg?height=620&width=1188)\n\nThe short and sweet **@songcamp_** was the clear winner. \n\nNext, we prompted everyone to come up with their own handle suggestions to try and beat @songcamp_.\n\nIdeas started flooding the chat. We chose the ones that got some quick excitement (via comments and emoji reactions) and threw them in a second vote. The results were as follows: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/songcamp_/status/1399486989506912257\n\nThe process of making this decision together was a ton of fun. Just to see the emoji numbers shooting up, the alternative ideas populating the chat, people unmuting themselves and reacting to their favourites. The simple act of group participation created this vital and intimate energy, and we wanted more of it. \n\nSo the following week, we took it up a notch…\n\n### Experiment No. 2 — The Identicon Design Workshop\n\nI was very inspired by the [Pre-Brand x Zora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjczwDE9kmw) collective design event I participated in back in late 2020. I wanted to do something similar with Songcamp, where we’d all jump into a Figma design file together and co-create our Twitter avatar. \n\nThe idea was to give each participant on the call their own “workstation” to make something, and at the end of the call we’d smush all the pieces together to create one big Songcamp identicon.\n\nI spoke with Peace Node ([@](https://twitter.com/peace_node)) on the idea, and he thought we could each create our own pixelated identicon akin to Ethereum [blockies](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/vanity-blockie-miner-for-ethereum-902fccf0a427). I loved the idea. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f465223c-c6e1-4fe5-9108-a9eefe63e449.png?height=556&width=1515)\n\nWe went about creating 36 workstations in a Figma design file, each with its own blank 8x8 bit square. The instructions were to fill your identicon in with the Paint Fill tool, and write a sentence or two about your piece. We would then amalgamate everyone’s identicons into one big Songcamp identicon.\n\nHere’s what those workstations looked like:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a924d800-efc8-481d-8470-297b2a840273.png?height=920&width=1412)\n\nWhen our call started we gave some light instructions and dropped the [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/bZ6We4jHx8erQK3xYWLJkm/SONGCAMP-IDENTITY). What happened next was electric…\n\nColored mice started flying about the screen and everyone got to creating their piece. More and more people showed up in the file, and we had to create more workstations on the fly. \n\nBy the end, we had co-created a Songcamp identicon of ~ 60 personal identicons — each with their own flavors. What we ended up with was a mosaic of loud beauty that just screamed fun.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b0160420-4e8b-421a-bc0d-280b5be78785.jpg?height=1368&width=1718)\n\nhttps://twitter.com/matthewchaim/status/1402017697790148616\n\nThe energy during this experiment was palpable. The multi-colored mice flying across the screen, exuberant voices popping in and out of the voice chat, rainbows upon rainbows of kaleidoscopic goodness filling our eyes with every passing second. \n\nAs you can see, some people took the constraints given and “broke the rules” in fun and creative ways. One such piece ended up looking like the original 8x8 square had exploded in every direction..\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d89891be-2683-425a-9795-5d469ac64762.png?height=138&width=138)\n\nAnother fun element that arose organically during the event was a self-organizing swarm of “*helpers*”. People who knew Figma well and finished their pieces early on were quick to help when others expressed confusion or a need for assistance on the call. Before I could even find the workstation in need myself, 3 to 6 people had already shown up and solved the problem within seconds. This allowed beginners to participate just as easily as experts, and erased any requirement for “design skills” to take part. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/60a24000-c574-4ec9-ad96-c263f4cabe42.png?height=1256&width=2036)\n\nWe went from *collective decision making* (voting) to *collective creation* (design), and now we were really on a roll. So on our next call, we brought it up a level yet again…\n\n\n### Experiment No. 3 — The Minicamp\n\nTo see how much art we could create as a group in such a short amount of time really got the wheels turning…\n\n*We were able to create 60 identicons in less than an hour together. What if we could run a songcamp in less than an hour?*\n\nThe following Monday we decided to try and answer that question. \n\nSince we didn’t know who would be showing up to the call, and whether or not they would have access to audio or visual production tools, we started with a few votes to read the room…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/19fa6fa2-17a4-4cb2-ab33-5044cc9658fa.png?height=726&width=1664)\n\nWe threw the above question up and asked for honest responses to get a feel if running this minicamp was realistic. As you can see, most said *No* — meaning they either couldn’t or didn’t want to participate in an impromptu songcamp. \n\nHowever, 16 affirmative answers seemed like enough potential participants to warrant the next question…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9e450eed-1525-4b43-97a0-73ef4b454a81.png?height=442&width=1038)\n\nSince we had figured beforehand that running ~3 rooms would be ideal, this worked out perfectly. \n\nWe quickly organized text and voice channels for 3 rooms — each populated with 1 or 2 producers, a vocalist, and 1 or 2 visual artists. \n\nEach group was given the following explicit constraint: **the task here is not to make *great* art. It is to make art in 40 minutes.**\n\nWhile each team got to work, the rest of us discussed ideas of what we could do with the resulting artwork. \n\nAdrian Tavares ([@](https://twitter.com/AdrianRicard0)) had the great idea of creating this [brainstorming prompt](https://app.sli.do/event/wk2wmmpu/live/ideas) on the app Slido, where we could all throw in ideas anonymously and vote on them. This helped get the juices flowing, and we threw around some fun possibilities. \n\nBecause the results of this short art-making experiment were so unknown, we didn’t come to any clear plan. It instead kicked us into some interesting conversations around the sanctity of the creative process.\n\nWhen the 40 minutes were up, the teams were asked to return to the main call and share the minisongs and cover artworks they’d created. Here’s what they made… \n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76900ebe-55b7-4aeb-9015-29b14cfd8ca2.png?height=1140&width=1140)](https://audius.co/songcamp/soma-440783)\n\nListen to [\"SOMA\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/soma-440783)\n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/377c24d9-d694-4eeb-b264-a458456d3841.jpg?height=1080&width=1080)](https://audius.co/songcamp/golden-hour-440784)\n\nListen to [\"Golden Hour\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/golden-hour-440784)\n\n[![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8455715a-1028-4338-b16d-31fc7f03a12b.png?height=1080&width=1080)](https://audius.co/songcamp/in-a-rush-440790)\n\nListen to [\"In A Rush\" on Audius](https://audius.co/songcamp/in-a-rush-440790)\n\nSuffice to say, we were all blown away. \n\nIn 40 minutes, they all created sprouting songs that each held such beautiful power and potential.
