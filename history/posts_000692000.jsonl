Hamming, The Art of Doing Science and Engineering*\n\n---\n\nIn any area of expertise, it's really the primitives that unlock creativity and higher performance. This is true whether it's mastering the deadlift for functional movement disciplines, [Salt, Fat, Acid and Heat](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/) for cooking, or something like zero-knowledge-proof verification in crypto. Mastering the fundamentals enable masterful art to happen.\n\n> As you discover the secrets of *Salt*, *Fat*, *Acid* and *Heat*, you'll find yourself improvising more and more in the kitchen. Liberated from recipes and precise shopping lists...you can make anything taste good.\n*Samin Nosrat, Salt Fat Acid Heat*\n\nMy own experience has been that the most valuable time spent learning is to study the core primitives in depth. I'll give some examples to motivate this, using features we built this year for Mirror.\n\n## Exhibit A - $WRITE Race\n\n[$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) has been successful. But how did it come about? In a discussion that [Denis](https://d.mirror.xyz/) and I had about onboarding new users, while I was on a vacation in Eagle Lake, CA., we articulated a clear problem: we wanted to have the best users join, but we didn't want to be responsible to choose those people ourselves. We wanted the community to develop organically - almost like a living organism.\n\nI first joined crypto through some time spent at a friend's company, [Numerai](https://numer.ai/), where I learned about staking using tokens on Ethereum. There is overlap between staking and $WRITE Race, because both are trying to solve the problem of generating high-quality suggestions from a group of people. Both products losely solve that problem by constraining submission via a token, and promising a reward in exchange.\n\nHere, understanding the problem-solution relationship for staking on Etheruem was key to unlocking the mechanism of $WRITE Race. Even if we didn't directly use staking, it was familiarity with that paradigm that unlocked our creativity.\n\n![@strollinghome thinking deeply about crypto primitives in the morning at Eagle Lake](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/40276c11-2d98-44b4-8b37-80b1f8ac6367.jpeg?height=1200&width=1600)\n        \n## Exhibit B - Splits\n\nMany protocols have attempted ways to split funds among a group of accounts. I've seen a dozen of these contracts, and most of them can't scale beyond a dozen recipients because they don't have the right primitive to unlock scalability.\n\nOur solution with [Splits](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw) was to use Merkle Proofs to allow unlimited split allocations, which proved to be popular. I was familiar with Merkle Proofs from having read deeply through the Uniswap Merkle Distributor.\n\nJust being familiar with Merkle Proofs unlocked a whole new feature, when the problem was presented.\n  \n[](https://twitter.com/viamirror/status/1389627591120785411?s=20)\n\n## Exhibit C - Crowdfunds and Scaling Crowdfunds\n\nMirror Crowdfunds have been very successful. We've managed to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for an incredibly diverse set of projects - from [Essays](https://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0) to [Novels](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) to [Products](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4).\n\nBehind the success of Crowdfunds is a deep understanding simple primitive - minting and burning ERC20 tokens. We mint an ERC20 token when someone contributes to the project, and we burn it when they want to claim the underlying ETH. If you aren't deeply familiar with this mechanism, it might not occur to you as the way to approach the Crowdfunding problem, and you might opt instead for a generic data structure to hold the allocations. I've seen a few implementations like this, and they're just inherently very limited. ERC20s unlock so much more.\n\nMore sophisticated is the scaling of Crowdfunds. We scale Crowdfunds by deploying a single logic contract, and then [delegating to that contract](https://github.com/mirror-xyz/crowdfund/tree/main/contracts) from each individual crowdfund. This is the proxy pattern that is popular in the Ethereum space. But it really takes being familiar with the pattern to know how to apply this well.\n\n## Exhibit D - Signing\nOutside of Ethereum, we use a few primitives for cryptographically signing content. In fact, we use this for all verification on the Mirror platform, and have no login sessions. This will allow us to prove that the content comes from the author, regardless of whether we have an API running or not. This will be critical for our decentralization plans.\n\nThe signing keys are also not the same as the user's Ethereum public key. This is important, because it allows users to interact on the platform — writing, commenting (soonish), etc — without needing to take our an Ethereum wallet that might have funds on it just to sign a blog post entry.\n\nUnderstanding how to do this (quickly) meant having deep familiarity with the types of cryptographic signatures that are supported on Ethereum, the browser, and how to string them together to make something that is a good product experience.\n\n---\n\nI hope I've motivated the case to learn the primitives.

Hamming, The Art of Doing Science and Engineering*\n\n---\n\nIn any area of expertise, it's really the primitives that unlock creativity and higher performance. This is true whether it's mastering the deadlift for functional movement disciplines, [Salt, Fat, Acid and Heat](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/) for cooking, or something like zero-knowledge-proof verification in crypto.

I'll give some examples to motivate this, using features we built this year for Mirror.\n\n## Exhibit A - $WRITE Race\n\n[$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) has been successful. But how did it come about? In a discussion that [Denis](https://d.mirror.xyz/) and I had about onboarding new users, while I was on a vacation in Eagle Lake, CA., we articulated a clear problem: we wanted to have the best users join, but we didn't want to be responsible to choose those people ourselves. We wanted the community to develop organically - almost like a living organism.\n\nI first joined crypto through some time spent at a friend's company, [Numerai](https://numer.ai/), where I learned about staking using tokens on Ethereum. There is overlap between staking and $WRITE Race, because both are trying to solve the problem of generating high-quality suggestions from a group of people. Both products losely solve that problem by constraining submission via a token, and promising a reward in exchange.\n\nHere, understanding the problem-solution relationship for staking on Etheruem was key to unlocking the mechanism of $WRITE Race. Even if we didn't directly use staking, it was familiarity with that paradigm that unlocked our creativity.\n\n![@strollinghome thinking deeply about crypto primitives in the morning at Eagle Lake](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/40276c11-2d98-44b4-8b37-80b1f8ac6367.jpeg?height=1200&width=1600)\n        \n## Exhibit B - Splits\n\nMany protocols have attempted ways to split funds among a group of accounts.

But if you're new here, here's a lil explainer:\n\n- Holding $IMPOSSIBLE tokens not only proves you helped make the book happen in the first place, but also gives you a stake in the financial success of the book.\n- Once the book is completed, the text will be minted as an NFT on Zora and put up for a reserve auction.\n\n- When the NFT sells, the smart contract funnels funds back to $IMPOSSIBLE holders in proportion to the amount of $IMPOSSIBLE they hold.\n\n-  At that point, backers can choose to sell their $IMPOSSIBLE tokens on an exchange such as Uniswap, redeeming them for ether, or carry on holding them. Holders will receive financial upside whenever the NFT is auctioned again in the future.\n\n- $IMPOSSIBLE holders will be able to play a governance role by taking part in Snapshot polls relating to *Conversations on AI*.\n\n- That's not all. Hold on for a full explanation of additional benefits below.\n\n## When will the conversations happen?\n\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over. \n\nAfter that, the publication of the book will happen in two stages.\n\n### Stage 1\n\nOnce the conversations have all taken place, they'll be published on Mirror as an eBook of approximately 50000 words. This will be free for all to read, thanks to the original backers and holders of the $IMPOSSIBLE token, whose names will be in included the acknowledgements and logged forever on the blockchain.\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThis is where things really start to get interesting. \n\nBefore the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to all readers, not just holders of $IMPOSSIBLE. \n\nOne to three of these will be published alongside the main dialogues in the first full print and electronic edition of the book.\n\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*. But with Mirror's help we're giving things a web3 twist.\n\n\n\n![Still from Metahaven's \"The Sprawl\"](https://thefader-res.cloudinary.com/private_images/w_1800,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best/screen_shot_2016-04-20_at_21.52.37_rqwpvi/screenshot-from-i-the-sprawl-i.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Who will design the book?\nWe're excited to say that editorial design for the book and for Impossible Object's future titles will be by the incredible Metahaven.\n\nNot only will Metahaven be doing editorial design for *Conversations on AI*; in line with a plan that will be repeated with future Impossible Object titles, the front cover image will be minted as a standalone NFT and auctioned a little further down the line. \n\nSome of the proceeds of this will go to iODAO, Impossible Object's creator DAO.\n\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1464387a-458e-4d20-b694-34e576c840a0.png?height=409&width=430)\n\n\n\n## How much are you aiming to raise?\n\nWe're aiming to raise up to 25 ETH, which will go to:\n\n- Our dialogists: Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester, Reza Negarestani and Nick Srnicek\n- Our designer, Metahaven\n- The costs of producing, marketing and distributing the book\n- The development of web3 functionality on Impossible Object's website and forthcoming Discord server, giving $IMPOSSIBLE holders access to the benefits that this entails.\n\n## What are the different tiers of backer rewards?\n\n**Every backer**\n- $IMPOSSIBLE tokens at the rate: 1 ether = 1000 $IMPOSSIBLE\n- Proportional stakes in the sale of the book's NFT as described above.\n- Proportional voting power in polls relating to the book.\n- Your name in the book's acknowledgements.\n\n**0.25 ether and above**\n- The above, plus...\n- A copy of the trade paperback\n- Invitation to a 2 hour Zoom roundtable on AI with participants in the book.\n\n**0.75 ether and above**\n- The above, plus...\n- A signed copy of the book.\n- A call with Reza Negarestani about anything at all (not necessarily AI).\n\n", "timestamp": 1621804583, "digest": "hqkBkj6ttSQfHvgdArGYPNgw9JkrlLAyZqC5UWqk3s0", "contributor": "0xc46E9a66FDdC8D1a69529d86E668236f02957F1b"}

We want to bring more people out to the cabins to help answer it. \n\n[PICTURE OF GROUP]\n\nThis is a crowdfund for one year of cumulative time living and building at Creator Cabins in the Texas Hill Country. We're situated on 28 acres of land about 45 minutes from downtown Austin, and we just built a new cabin designed as a collaborative co-living and working space for independent online creators. It's the first node in what we hope will one day be a [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/):\n\n[PICTURE OF CABIN]\n\nWe're setting up a DAO to manage the crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens, which can be used to vote for residency proposals. While the DAO will ultimately govern the use of the funds, here's a rough sketch of how we are thinking about structuring the program:\n\nWe want to crowdfund 12 months worth of time staying at the cabins. This would allow us to fund 12 creators to come for a one-month stay each. We have four bedrooms available, so we could run three cohorts of four creators each. \n\nThe DAO will set up an open application process (perhaps similar to $WRITE RACE), and the winners will be invited to Creator Cabins outside of Austin, TX to work on their proposals. At the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their residency. The NFTs could be held and curated by the CabinDAO treasury or sold with a split of the proceeds going to the artist and back to the DAO.\n\nWho is eligible for a residency? Anyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of creators: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders, YOU. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of Web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide. \n\nWe are budgeting 1/3rd of an ETH per creator-week for room and board, so 16 ETH can fund 3 cohorts (12 creators for a total of 48 weeks at the cabins). THe DAO will retain 50% of tokens to give to artists upon completion of their residencies, future supporters of the residency program, and whoever else the DAO decides to grant them to.\n\nThis project came together over the course of a two-week stay at Creator Cabins. We didn't go into our stay intending to make this——the plan emerged from two weeks of interesting conversations and collaboration at the cabins. In particular, we'd like to thank <<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>.

It also creates robustness against local changes in climate, regulation, and social norms.\n\nInspired by Balaji's essay on [The Location Stack](https://1729.com/location/) for technological progressives and conversations at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) this past week, we've been thinking through a rough sketch of the tech stack for decentralized cities:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9eff57a-48ee-4e01-bce5-6a71e784d038.jpeg?height=1725&width=1307)\n\nLike a computer, a decentralized city has hardware and software. **Hardware is the physical space**: the land, the infrastructure, and the buildings. **Software is the virtual layer**: incorporation, governance, and social interaction. \n\nThis separation allows decentralized cities to operate with compatible and interchangeable hardware and software architectures. If a physical node in the network doesn't agree with decisions being made, they can spin up a new virtual governance layer. And if a physical location becomes an untenable place to continue living, the community can migrate to a new location without losing its social and governance layers. \n\n**By decoupling these functions, everyone has a plausible [path to exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty) and try something different.** You can imagine that virtual \"governments\" would gain and lose physical locations over time, and that physical locations could be part of multiple social and governance layers, depending on their needs:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/49e05c2c-07d5-44b5-9038-803cac2a07ab.png?height=1099&width=1704)\n\n\n## Hardware for a decentralized city\n\nThere are three layers of the physical hardware stack:\n\n1. Land\n2. Infrastructure\n3. Buildings\n\n### Land: Develop multiple exurban locations\n\nWhile the metaverse will increase our time spent in virtual realities, we still need to live in good old-fashioned physical reality. And if you want to be able to control your physical space, you need to own land.\n\nWhile decentralized cities need land, a key difference that separates them from conventional cities is that the land isn't all in one place. Multiple physical nodes in the network allow flexibility and a plausible path to exit from any specific location. \n\nWhere should these nodes be located? The best living locations through quality-of-life factors like:\n\n- **Cost**: housing, food, taxes...\n- **Environment**: climate, access to nature...\n- **Infrastructure**: internet speed, airports, healthcare...\n- **Culture**: access to dining, museums, concerts...\n- **Regulation**: the ability to build, experiment...\n\n**We believe that exurban environments provide the best trade-off among these factors for decentralized cities. They have relatively low costs and regulations and provide access to both nature and urban areas.**\n\nUnincorporated areas approximately 30 minutes - 1 hour outside of core urban areas seem to be ideal. For example, we've located the first Creator Cabins location in an exurban sweet spot, out in nature but only 45 minutes from downtown Austin:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac2d734f-8a1d-4e38-9f59-c8c59639f090.jpg?height=1512&width=1926)\n\n\n### Infrastructure: Go off-grid \n\nTo build a robust decentralized city node, off-the-grid technologies make up the core infrastructure tech stack. Solar panels, fixed wireless or satellite internet, a well, and a septic system can provide for an entirely independent retreat. Here are some pictures of our infra set-up:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5085a095-c5d9-4873-b302-035da188e624.jpg?height=1333&width=1961)\n\nThere are probably several whole posts to be written about lessons learned putting in our infrastructure. But generally speaking, these technologies have gotten good enough that you can create a functioning outpost on your own infrastructure nearly anywhere in the world. With the proliferation of 5G and Starlink, internet access will soon be very fast in most places. \n\n\n### Buildings: design for community and flexibility\n\nThe physical buildings should be suited to the target citizens of your decentralized city. We recommend [A Pattern Language](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199) as a guide to the principles of spatial design of physical communities. In our case, we designed our new cabin from the ground up for creator co-living and working. It features private bedroom suites with built-in desks and large connected public areas for social interaction and collaboration: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e626a4ec-2085-4f7c-910e-c8ee2d05120f.png?height=1708&width=2462)\n\nWe partnered with [Forte Shelter](https://www.forteshelter.com/) to pre-fabricate this cabin out of shipping containers. It's an inherently modular and extensible design. While pre-fab construction is not a panacea, **it also allows the flexibility to install similar cabins anywhere in the world and move existing cabins to new locations if needed**:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11103b3b-578b-46f0-914f-4cab39355273.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\n\nOther flexible living options like [Kibbo](https://www.kibbo.com/) could allow for even easier migration of living spaces. Chenoe Hart has written about [the ways in which self-driving technology may blur the lines between vehicles and buildings](https://reallifemag.com/perpetual-motion-machines/). \n\n\n## Software for a decentralized city\n\nDecentralized cities run on three primary layers of the software stack:\n\n1. Incorporation\n2. Governance\n3.

But the underlying assumption is that the place you live is also the place you will be governed. This may always be true, but it doesn't have to be. \n\nTraditionally, cities are in a single place and are incorporated locally. But much like startups now incorporate in Delaware regardless of where they do business, **cities may start to incorporate in one place and then do their work in many places.** Wyoming creating a legal structure for DAOs could make it a compelling option for incorporating a city. \n\nI am not a lawyer, and state laws aren't going anywhere.

They are our best guess from initial exploration of the idea maze, not an ideal solution. We'd love to hear from other people thinking about building innovative living spaces and organizing social and governance structures. **After all, only through many experiments with hardware and software stacks will we start to evolve a network of nodes in the first decentralized cities. **\n\n\nAcknowledgements: thanks to Jon Gold, Zachary Fleischmann, Lauren Alexander, XXX \n\n", "timestamp": 1621821511, "digest": "-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}
{"id": "Y-LcjtvMFkuDXkHm9JVTpQXQ0UdPrlPNTJCGN9jJH4c", "title": "Tech stack for decentralized cities", "body": "A [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/) is a network of **distinct physical locations tied together by shared governance and culture.** It allows people to maintain close social ties and norms while moving around to different places. It also creates robustness against local changes in climate, regulation, and social norms.\n\nInspired by Balaji's essay on [The Location Stack](https://1729.com/location/) for technological progressives and conversations at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) this past week, we've been thinking through a rough sketch of the full tech stack for decentralized cities:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9eff57a-48ee-4e01-bce5-6a71e784d038.jpeg?height=1725&width=1307)\n\nLike a computer, a decentralized city has hardware and software. **Hardware is the physical space**: the land, the infrastructure, and the buildings. **Software is the virtual layer**: incorporation, governance, and social interaction. \n\nThis separation allows decentralized cities to operate with compatible and interchangeable hardware and software architectures. If a physical node in the network doesn't agree with decisions being made, they can spin up a new virtual governance layer. And if a physical location becomes an untenable place to continue living, the community can migrate to a new location without losing its social and governance layers. \n\n**By decoupling these functions, everyone has a plausible [path to exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty) and try something different.** You can imagine that virtual \"governments\" would gain and lose physical locations over time, and that physical locations could be part of multiple social and governance layers, depending on their needs:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/49e05c2c-07d5-44b5-9038-803cac2a07ab.png?height=1099&width=1704)\n\n\n## Hardware for a decentralized city\n\nThere are three layers of the physical hardware stack:\n\n1. Land\n2. Infrastructure\n3. Buildings\n\n### Land: Develop multiple exurban locations\n\nWhile the metaverse will increase our time spent in virtual realities, we still need to live in good old-fashioned physical reality. And if you want to be able to control your physical space, you need to own land.\n\nWhile decentralized cities need land, a key difference that separates them from conventional cities is that the land isn't all in one place. Multiple physical nodes in the network allow flexibility and a plausible path to exit from any specific location. \n\nWhere should these nodes be located? The best living locations through quality-of-life factors like:\n\n- **Cost**: housing, food, taxes...\n- **Environment**: climate, access to nature...\n- **Infrastructure**: internet speed, airports, healthcare...\n- **Culture**: access to dining, museums, concerts...\n- **Regulation**: the ability to build, experiment...\n\n**We believe that exurban environments provide the best trade-off among these factors for decentralized cities. They have relatively low costs and regulations and provide access to both nature and urban areas.**\n\nUnincorporated areas approximately 30 minutes - 1 hour outside of core urban areas seem to be ideal. For example, we've located the first Creator Cabins location in an exurban sweet spot, out in nature but only 45 minutes from downtown Austin:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac2d734f-8a1d-4e38-9f59-c8c59639f090.jpg?height=1512&width=1926)\n\n\n### Infrastructure: Go off-grid \n\nTo build a robust decentralized city node, off-the-grid technologies make up the core infrastructure tech stack. Solar panels, fixed wireless or satellite internet, a well, and a septic system can provide for an entirely independent retreat. Here are some pictures of our infra set-up:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5085a095-c5d9-4873-b302-035da188e624.jpg?height=1333&width=1961)\n\nThere are probably several whole posts to be written about lessons learned putting in our infrastructure. But generally speaking, these technologies have gotten good enough that you can create a functioning outpost on your own infrastructure nearly anywhere in the world. With the proliferation of 5G and Starlink, internet access will soon be very fast in most places. \n\n\n### Buildings: design for community and flexibility\n\nThe physical buildings should be suited to the target citizens of your decentralized city. We recommend [A Pattern Language](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199) as a guide to the principles of spatial design of physical communities. In our case, we designed our new cabin from the ground up for creator co-living and working. It features private bedroom suites with built-in desks and large connected public areas for social interaction and collaboration: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e626a4ec-2085-4f7c-910e-c8ee2d05120f.png?height=1708&width=2462)\n\nWe partnered with [Forte Shelter](https://www.forteshelter.com/) to pre-fabricate this cabin out of shipping containers. It's an inherently modular and extensible design. While pre-fab construction is not a panacea, **it also allows the flexibility to install similar cabins anywhere in the world and move existing cabins to new locations if needed**:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11103b3b-578b-46f0-914f-4cab39355273.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\n\nOther flexible living options like [Kibbo](https://www.kibbo.com/) could allow for even easier migration of living spaces. Chenoe Hart has written about [the ways in which self-driving technology may blur the lines between vehicles and buildings](https://reallifemag.com/perpetual-motion-machines/). \n\n\n## Software for a decentralized city\n\nDecentralized cities run on three primary layers of the software stack:\n\n1. Incorporation\n2. Governance\n3. Social\n\n### Remote incorporation\n\nIn Balaji's [Location Stack](https://1729.com/location/) post, he asks for people to help research options for jurisdictions friendly to tech progressives. Posts like [this one](https://dougantin.com/remote-work-the-tech-enabled-exit/) walk-through options for living tailored to local governance preferences. But the underlying assumption is that the place you live is also the place you will be governed. This may always be true, but it doesn't have to be. \n\nTraditionally, cities are in a single place and are incorporated locally. But much like startups now incorporate in Delaware regardless of where they do business, **cities may start to incorporate in one place and then do their work in many places.** Wyoming creating a legal structure for DAOs could make it a compelling option for incorporating a city. \n\nI am not a lawyer, and state laws aren't going anywhere.

{"id": "SdD8yxIZsNHGABT51ShDh4Ja8RlYuB4M9yNVmDSqY8w", "title": "The journey to releasing my first NFT", "body": "After more than 7 months of checking out the Web3 (crypto) space — reading on how blockchain tech works, and projects being made here and there — I recently minted my first NFT.\n\n***Note:** Everything mentioned here are my experiences in the Ethereum blockchain. Always remember to check whether the wallet and the platform you're minting on are on the same blockchain network.*\n\n-----\n\n### How did I find out about NFTs, Web3, and stuff\nBefore I share how I got to mint my first NFT, let me share how the fuck did I get in to this wild world of crypto and Web3.\n\nI don't recall exactly how, but I'm sure it's because of how [**RAC**](https://twitter.com/rac) — a Grammy-award winning producer — has back-to-back projects happening in the space. I think this was around October 2020, but I'd like to assume I've heard of these even earlier.\n\nFrom NFTs, the super wild [**$TAPE**](https://zora.co/rac/tape) project — a token representing a physical cassette tape, — to issuing his own social token, [**$RAC**](https://blog.ourzora.com/introducing-rac), where token holders can have access to a private area in his Discord server, get discounts to merch, or even get to interact with him more.\n\nI also was introduced to Audius because of one stream he did on Twitch! [**Audius**](https://audius.co/feed) is like Soundcloud, except you (the artist) have a say on what happens to the platform. You want to have a subscription feature? Vote using the tokens given to you every time you post! **The platform's future is in the artists' hands.**\n\nAll these projects were so fascinating to see. With more focus on NFTs, the mere fact that digital artists can make a living out of JUST doing things digitally is amazing to me. No need to print your digital works as stickers, prints, posters, etc. Blockchain technology made it possible for one specific file to be called THE official one. Because of that, all the other copies scattered around the internet, and the ones to be made by saving a copy of the same file, are worthless. **The original file gets value.**\n\n### How I was able to mint my first NFT\n\nMinting (*making*) an NFT can cost around US$40-$100 in gas (*transaction*) fees on a good day, and a disgusting $400-$800 on a bad one (although why would you mint during a bad day, lol). Gas fees don’t go to the platform, but rather the people running the whole Ethereum network.\n\nIn the Philippines, $40 is already 10+% of what an entry level employee is making monthly, while $100 is like 1/3 of the same salary. **Anyway, bottomline, it's just so fucking expensive for people here.**\n\n![Sees how much I need to mint an NFT](https://media.giphy.com/media/Y4JE51QwzefMLfknfq/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\nI honestly considered saving up for a mint fund, in hopes that I can get my money back and more. That doesn't mean I'm just here for the money. I'm also here for people to validate that my work has value, maybe even greater than what I would've expected.\n\nPosting on Instagram and Twitter, getting likes for my posts, and I can't make a living out of it because all the money goes to the platforms?! **I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THIS LOGIC AFTER KNOWING ABOUT NFTs.** Did I mention that if your NFT is resold in the secondary market, you get a cut of the resale???!!!\n\nThen, while I was looking around the Creator x Crypto side of Twitter, I discovered Mint Fund.\n\n[**Mint Fund**](https://twitter.com/themintfund) is a community project that helps artists in being able to mint their first NFT by giving a grant that's enough to cover for gas fees. **They prioritize funds to BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ artists especially outside North America and Europe.** They are also working on great projects for the space like making a crowdfund for an open-source protocol.\n\nI signed up for the grant a week after they launched, but sadly didn't get in the first batch. It just meant that I was still on the waitlist! I got an email around mid or late April saying that I got in the second batch. GURL, I WAS SHOOKT. I SAW THE EMAIL WHEN I WOKE UP. Now THAT's how you start a good day!\n\n![Walking out of my bedroom after seeing the email](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT1R9ZbWoZgo0leM5G/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\n***Side Note:** For artists in South East Asia, you might also want to apply at [**First Mint Fund**](https://twitter.com/firstmintfund)! It's another community project giving grants to artists so that they can mint their first NFT.*\n\n### Minting process\n\nY'all... minting an NFT is ***EASY AS FUUUUUUUCK.*** Uploaded the file, entered some details, clicked \"Proceed\", set up a price, and I'm done. No complicated shit!\n\nBut if you're starting from nowhere, you should get an Ethereum wallet (like [**Metamask**](https://metamask.io/)) first, AND WRITE THAT SEED PHRASE DOWN (YES, THE 12 RANDOM WORDS). The seed phrase is like the ultimate password. Lose it, lose everything in your wallet.\n\nNow with that wallet, you can start connecting it to platforms like Zora, Rarible, Foundation, and more. If the platform is open to the public to mint on it, then go ahead!\n\nFor NFT platforms on the Tezos blockchain, like *hic et nunc* and Kalamint, I think Temple is one of the most used wallets there.\n\nAgain, EZ SHIT! But I do understand that it can get, or it looks overwhelming. If that's the case, just shoot me a DM on Twitter ([**@belgiangwaffles**](https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles))! I'll be happy to help you out. 😊\n\n### And here it is...\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3003)\n\n[Read about the concept and what minting an NFT means to me in this post.](https://gianferrer.mirror.xyz/faYgip4c1BwVbr0UvuVE3Oae2OaKCmlmOxBIgrxFcZc)\n*You also might wanna... you know... make a bid or sumn...* 🥺👉👈\n\n### Zora as my chosen platform\n\nI chose [**Zora**](https://zora.co/) as the platform where I'll mint my first NFT for various reasons.\n- I feel like it's not as saturated as other open platforms.\n- They don't get a cut from my sale.\n- I have the option to not have a timed auction being started when somebody bids with my asking price.\n\n    I just feel like that it hypes the price more than the artwork itself, which I don't want to be the case. Also, I want to be able to pick who gets my piece, and not just someone because it was automated. The owner is as important as the piece, IMO.\n\n- Also, from my understanding, I can sell the same NFT on other platforms with the creator share still attached to it, so I am not stuck with Zora.\n\n    I have to verify if I understood this correctly. 💀\n\n- Lastly, I don't want to set my asking price with ETH. Speaking of...\n\n### Fun Fact: I'm not selling it for money.\n\n~~Now this, I think, is what the locals don't know, especially the outsiders hating on all of this, lmao.~~ Depending on where you mint your NFT, you can choose to sell your works NOT for money — ETH, or stablecoins (crypto that will forever be worth $1) like DAI or USDT — but for social tokens.\n\n![Yes. I'm not asking for money.](https://media.giphy.com/media/SXeezvYc8uRUc/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\nRemember the $RAC token I was talking about earlier? I'm asking for something like that.\n\nIt's like exchanging a print, postcard, painting, whatever, for access to someone's Netflix account for a period of time, or live in the buyer's house for a month. Sure, these things have monetary value, and so does social tokens, but I'm not interested in that.\n\nMy asking price is **60 $FWB** ([**Friends with Benefits**](https://fwb.help/)) which is enough for me to enter the FWB Discord server and apply to be a member. The membership, for me, is a way to widen my network especially with fellow creators in the crypto space. I want to get to know more people, see what kind of crazy projects they're up to, learn from them, exchange ideas, and maybe just chill with them as well. That's what I wish to get in exchange for my NFT.\n\nActually, you can swap your crypto to FWB. My asking price could've been the ETH or DAI equivalent of 60 FWB, but I think that's an easier route. For me, it means way more if someone from FWB sees my work and actually bids on it with their FWB tokens. It's like a cosign from a member, **legitimizing that I SHOULD be with them.**\n\n### What's next?\n\n~~Win the fuckin’ $WRITE Race!!!~~\n\nMy next goal is to join a social token community or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)! I want to know how these things work in a member's perspective, especially if I have a say on the governance of the community or organization.\n\nTHE MONEY SIDE OF CRYPTO IS TOO BORING FOR ME. The People side of crypto is where the fun is all at.\n\nI already got some $FF by [**Forefront**](https://forefront.market/). So I think I'm about to experience some of that soon.\n\nBut for now, let's **#GetGianInFWB** LMAOOOOOOO.

I'm a 22-year-old graphic designer and creative entrepreneur from the Philippines. That's in South East Asia, like Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia.\n\nHere's what I've been up to with my life.\n\n---\n\n### School\n\nI took up Organizational Communication in college, which is like a mix of public relations, branding, and knowing how organizations work. I don't even know if I'm giving justice to my course with this definition, LMAO. IT'S BEEN A WHILE.\n\nI stopped a year before I'm supposed to do my thesis. I thought that a diploma wasn't worth it anymore, and am still questioning the credibility of a diploma. What does it mean if a person has a diploma, more so, from one of the Top 4 universities in the country, especially for a creative? I cared more about branding and visual identities (we're talking beyond logos), and the only way I'm supposed to be good at it is by practice. Don't get me wrong, I value education and love my major subjects — which I love and found super interesting even thought they were hard — but I don't understand why the educational system is what it is.\n\nI have been in a Leave of Absence since mid-2019, and have no intentions of returning, even if I have earned the money to sustain myself AND pay for my education.\n\nUnofficial College Dropout. Do I aspire to be the next Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates? ***Fuck no!*** I'll be the only Gian Ferrer!\n\n### Creative Businesses\n\nWhile in college (I was 19 this time), I made my first brand called estitiks, which makes fun of what's #aesthetic. I usually sell stickers taking note of graphic design trends (like gradients and duotones) and mixing them up with crass or witty statements. It's me thinking \"Will people buy this even if the statement is so stupid or mean, because it's pretty?\"\n\nBefore the pandemic, I've joined over 40 events (from small indie gigs, art conventions, to music festivals), about 10 stores (some even inside malls), and a handful of pop-ups, selling my stuff.\n\n< Me selling in events or stores >\n\nRight now, I'm always thinking whether I've actually outgrown the brand and stop, or not. It's been a few years, and I feel like I've matured... even a little. IDK...\n\nDuring my time building estitiks, I also organized a few events, usually small gatherings for creatives. This led to me making another brand, HOHOL events.\n\n< Picture of Kape Birthday or HOHOLocal >\n\nHOHOL events is an event organizing group focusing more on making meaningful connections. We try to lower pedestals for the people we want to feature, making attendees remember that these artists, musicians, or whoever is on stage are people as well, just like them. The spotlight is on everyone.\n\nWe launched late 2019, so we weren't able to do a lot of stuff yet, but during our short run we were able to have over 200 attendees total in our three events.\n\n### Freelancing\n\n---\n\n### The Road Less Travelled\n\nI think a reoccurring thing happening in my life is that I choose the road less travelled. From unofficially dropping out of school — giving me less chances of getting a high-paying job locally —, building my own brands from scratch instead of being a part of one, to even getting myself into this wild world of Web3 / Crypto where outsiders just talk shit.\n\nIt's always been a lonely road, even if you meet partners or new friends that are there to support you. I just feel like nobody understands me fully, being an LGBT+ graphic designer from the Philippines, who's in the pursuit to sustaining themselves, creating stuff, and helping others along the way. Writing this paragraph just made me realize that there's more to me, even though I don't feel it (yet?) Maybe I'm asking too much from people. IDK.\n\n![I saw this GIF and got me a little bit emotional because this is a great visual of what I feel. Anyway, stream \"Dark\" on Netflix.

What does it mean if a person has a diploma, more so, from one of the Top 4 universities in the country, especially for a creative? I cared more about branding and visual identities (we're talking beyond logos), and the only way I'm supposed to be good at it is by practice. Don't get me wrong, I value education and love my major subjects — which I love and found super interesting even thought they were hard — but I don't understand why the educational system is what it is.\n\nI have been in a Leave of Absence since mid-2019, and have no intentions of returning, even if I have earned the money to sustain myself AND pay for my education.\n\nUnofficial College Dropout. Do I aspire to be the next Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates? ***Fuck no!*** I'll be the only Gian Ferrer!\n\n### Creative Businesses\n\nWhile in college (I was 19 this time), I made my first brand called estitiks, which makes fun of what's #aesthetic. I usually sell stickers taking note of graphic design trends (like gradients and duotones) and mixing them up with crass or witty statements. It's me thinking \"Will people buy this even if the statement is so stupid or mean, because it's pretty?\"\n\nBefore the pandemic, I've joined over 40 events (from small indie gigs, art conventions, to music festivals), about 10 stores (some even inside malls), and a handful of pop-ups, selling my stuff.\n\nRight now, I'm always thinking whether I've actually outgrown the brand and stop, or not. It's been a few years, and I feel like I've matured... even a little. IDK...\n\nDuring my time building estitiks, I also organized a few events, usually small gatherings for creatives. This led to me making another brand, HOHOL events.\n\nHOHOL events is an event organizing group focusing more on making meaningful connections. We try to lower pedestals for the people we want to feature, making attendees remember that these artists, musicians, or whoever is on stage are people as well, just like them. The spotlight is on everyone.\n\nWe launched late 2019, so we weren't able to do a lot of stuff yet, but during our short run we were able to have over 200 attendees total in our three events.\n\n### Freelancing\n\n---\n\n### The Road Less Travelled\n\nI think a reoccurring thing happening in my life is that I choose the road less travelled. From unofficially dropping out of school — giving me less chances of getting a high-paying job locally —, building my own brands from scratch instead of being a part of one, to even getting myself into this wild world of Web3 / Crypto where outsiders just talk shit.\n\nIt's always been a lonely road, even if you meet partners or new friends that are there to support you. I just feel like nobody understands me fully, being an LGBT+ graphic designer from the Philippines, who's in the pursuit to sustaining themselves, creating stuff, and helping others along the way. Writing this paragraph just made me realize that there's more to me, even though I don't feel it (yet?) Maybe I'm asking too much from people. IDK.\n\n![I saw this GIF and got me a little bit emotional because this is a great visual of what I feel. Anyway, stream \"Dark\" on Netflix. That show is g o o d  s h i t.](https://media1.tenor.com/images/1b398a6be179c96c990564e8e260413c/tenor.gif?height=850&width=1580)\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have various friend groups that I all love, but I feel like I haven't found my tribe yet. Will I find them in the world of Web3? I don't know. But anyways...\n\nHello, people of Web3! I'm Gian, and it's nice to meet you!", "timestamp": 1621828140, "digest": "gkC-lb8B-STXV3D9WwS2iL5laNlZU3kLHvJ3JQ0SmbE", "contributor": "0x2bD5d2e3d5852AD9960638083cb7c9F493E7A597"}
