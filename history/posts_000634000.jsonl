You need some $WRITE to vote. Because $WRITE isn’t widely distributed yet, we’re bootstrapping voting power by airdropping $WRITE to existing members and anyone who joins the Mirror waitlist. You can join [here](https://mirror.xyz/wait).\n2. The amount of $WRITE will be distributed in two tiers:\n    1. Existing members with publications get 1 $WRITE. Since they’re actively creating value for the platform through content, we feel they deserve it.\n    2. All new applicants who [join the waitlist](https://mirror.xyz/wait) will receive 0.01 $WRITE. We see this as a first step in what we hope is a long term relationship.\n3. The more $WRITE you have, the more your vote counts. The weight of your vote = $WRITE balance x 1000.\n4. You can only vote once per round, staking all your votes on a single candidate.\n5. Participants are ranked on the leaderboard based on total votes.\n6. The first round of $WRITE RACE will last 12 hours. When the clock runs out, the top ten applicants will each receive 1 $WRITE token, enough to join Mirror and start a publication.\n7. Whether or not you win, your continued participation in $WRITE RACE represents an investment in Mirror. That, too, will be rewarded with a little $WRITE.\n8. Celebrate, go home, stretch, rest.\n\n*After each round, a summary of participation and the results will be published on-chain using a Merkle root verification contract, inspired by the UNI airdrop implementation. Voters will be able to redeem their $WRITE on mainnet by submitting a Merkle proof on-chain, thereby claiming their tokens. This will be as simple as claiming UNI tokens.*\n\n__\n\nSo what’s gonna happen? We have no idea, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nMaybe the prominent voices will reign supreme. Maybe an up-and-coming voice will climb the ranks and blow our minds. Maybe your favorite writer will get in. Maybe *you’ll* get in. Maybe you’ll discover a writer or two you’ve never heard of, whether they get in or not. Whatever happens, we hope it’s inspiring. We hope to learn from this first round ways to improve subsequent rounds. We hope to create a tool that benefits everyone as much as it surprises us.\n\nStart your engines. Connect your wallets.
