{"id": "ux59Ok4STf9hLgyKtm2l4o8y6NtYuNPgrnPagXIi-C4", "title": "a16z：Investing in Friends With Benefits (a DAO) - Andreessen Horowitz", "body": "The next frontier in computing, which will take shape this decade, is building apps on programmable blockchains. Programmable blockchains are interesting for the same reason that innovation on smartphones spiked after opening up development to third parties via app stores. We are now seeing waves of brilliant, creative people building new products and services on top of blockchains that are disrupting industries and reaching mainstream adoption. DeFi was the first wave of blockchain killer apps that broke out about a year ago, followed by NFTs and crypto gaming experiences this year. What comes next is hard to predict, but DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) are likely to have an enormous impact on the adoption of web3 products. \n\nDAOs are internet-native, global collectives that share resources, build products, and work together toward common goals. To appreciate what is so powerful about this new method of organizing communities and aligning incentives to funnel creative energy, let’s look at history. Venice is known as a focal point of the Italian Renaissance, but almost none of the most groundbreaking inventions of the age originated there. Double-entry bookkeeping was imported from the Levant. The Arabic numerals that made it possible were originally from India. The industrial advances used to run the whole operation came from China. \n\nWhat Venice did have—and became renowned for—was a radically elevated merchant class with ownership and representation in government, which enabled them to assemble the best of the world’s resources. New ideas, concepts, and inventions could be combined, organized, scaled, and sometimes even reinvented in Venice. The result was explosive: in the 13th century, Venice became the richest and most powerful city in Europe, and despite dozens of regime changes (amazingly, the heads of state were called “Doges”), it was able to hold this title for hundreds of years. \n\nIn addition to borderless resource assembly, DAOs also enable bottom-up innovation and community building, from which new ideas can be incubated and scaled. A more recent historical comparison is the Homebrew Computer Club, a Silicon Valley forum for sharing ideas where Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak debuted the first Apple computer in 1976. Truly disruptive innovations often look like toys at the outset, and emerge when groups of smart people get together and collaborate on hobbies they’re passionate about.\n\nWhat we’re seeing in web3 feels familiar in many ways. Today, artists are using NFTs to capture the full value of their work. Talented engineers with only an internet connection are contributing to the most important blockchain infrastructure, regardless of their age, gender, or pedigree. Like Venice did for early modern Europe, web3 is redefining how global talent pools their knowledge and work together. And like the Homebrew Computer Club in the 1970s, communities of smart, passionate, “hobbyists” are gathering in forums to tinker with a new set of primitives to build groundbreaking products and experiences. Those communities are being organized today via DAOs, the web3 group coordination primitive. \n\nUntil recently, DAOs were used mostly to secure DeFi protocols, and DAO members consisted primarily of highly technical contributors. [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/) (Friends With Benefits) represents a new kind of DAO. Founded initially as a token-gated Discord server, FWB has become the de facto home of web3’s growing creative class. Joining FWB requires a written application, which the community itself reviews and votes on, as well as a minimum buy-in of $FWB tokens, which represent meaningful ownership in the DAO. In addition to capturing the upside of the DAO’s creative output, the tokens come with governing power over a community treasury. By aligning the incentives of the next generation of artists, creators, and builders, FWB is enabling a different kind of renaissance for the next evolution of the internet. Fittingly, they describe themselves as a digital city.\n\nWe have long believed the creative class is among the most under-monetized talent pools in web2, driving the vast majority of the cultural value and capturing little of it in return. The average American consumer spends a third of their waking hours streaming music, and yet only 1% of music artists are able to make a living through streaming. Crypto offers a dramatically more incentive-aligned way for creatives to monetize their passions, but we also recognize that the adoption hurdles have remained significant. FWB serves as the port city of web3, introducing a culturally influential class to crypto by putting human capital first. \n\nSince its humble beginnings as a social experiment in September 2020, FWB has grown to nearly 2000 members and its community has driven an outsized portion of the cultural value in web3. DAO members have launched a (now canonical)[ token-gated events app](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/XU5\\_RYsow8fDbbckryr2snNyfrMV8HTJ0N39Cjkfy3s), [an NFT gallery](https://gallery.fwb.help/), a web3-focused [editorial venture](https://www.fwb.help/wip), a virtual music studio, and a [real-time community dashboard](https://www.fwb.help/pulse), in addition to a series of [parties](https://www.fwb.help/wip/fwb-paris) around the world. Their next venture, FWB Cities, aims to scale the DAO’s IRL footprint, partnering with city-specific spaces, communities, and experiences to bring real world benefits to the FWB membership. In this way, FWB Cities offers a glimpse into the very first IRL metaverse and will make the entry fee even more accessible to more people.\n\nBecause of FWB, it’s now possible to envision a world where the first time you interact with crypto is when you walk into a bar or attend your friend’s concert. Our goal is to offer guidance as FWB navigates the complexities that come with the next phase of DAO maturity. We plan to actively [participate in governance](https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program/) and we will empower key community members through delegation. We’re thrilled to be a part of the FWB community as they lead the charge toward mainstream adoption of web3.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

The world’s first DECENTralized independent label; the DECENT choice for artists. We are creating efficiency and fairness in the historically inequitable music industry by putting artists and fans on the same team.\n\nOur NFT platform allows artists to mint and auction NFTs collateralized by royalty revenues. By tying investors’ ROI to artists’ royalty growth rates, Decent creates a synergistic flywheel between fans, investors, and musicians, incentivizing fans to market on behalf of artists. Just as streaming platforms democratized audiences, we aim to democratize ownership with Decent.\n\n## Music as Work-to-Rent\n\nTo date, middlemen and intermediaries have controlled music's funding, promotion, and data channels.  Monopolistic control over distribution and capital has enabled these middlemen to rate-limit industry success and normalize extractive pricing, resulting in artists earning only \\~12% of the value that they create.  More draconian still, “making it” as an artist generally entails relinquishing 80% - 90% of their master rights.  Taken together, these statistics highlight music to be the only industry in which participants are expected to mortgage their future only to mortgage their present.\n\n## Why Decent?\n\n**With Decent, artists will always retain 100% of the master rights to their music.**  We aim to mitigate the music industry’s feudal paradigm of work-to-rent and replace it with an economic system predicated on the integrity of strictly-enforced property rights.  A system that rewards artists’ creativity and determination, treating each copyright as the cornerstone of a vibrant career rather than a time card.\n\nUsing our smart contracts and royalty vaults, artists can raise money for future projects, cultivate an invested fanbase, and maintain ownership of their intellectual property (IP). Artists determine what percentage of their royalty revenues they would like to make investable for fans and for how long, making the funding process flexible and customizable. To raise capital, artists will auction royalty-backed NFTs priced in accordance with the artists’ incumbent popularity and the duration of the contract.\n\nBy supporting an artist’s auction, participants will build out portfolios of their favorite artists, effectively joining their team. Fans-turned-teammates will have access to exclusive opportunities to participate in the creative journey like never before and can even be rewarded with airdrops when their artist communities succeed.\n\nCutting out the traditional record label “middleman” unlocks previously gate-kept value for both the artist and fan, who take up a symbiotic relationship driven by financial and emotional interests. With Decent, artists will have access to all the resources of a traditional label (funding, marketing, distribution, community) without having to surrender large portions of their IP. And when they succeed, the fans who supported them from the beginning will be the beneficiaries, not a third party corporation.\n\nAs Decent artists develop with help from their newfound teammates, the entire Decent community will reap the benefits.  Decent’s marketplace fees will be split between the Decent Treasury and Community Rewards Matching Pools to provide the users with ownership over the platform.\n\n## Roadmap: What’s Next?\n\nJoin Decent to accelerate artists’ careers and reinvent one of the world’s most antiquated economic structures. **Artists:** receive capital and a team to accelerate your career - your fans want to bet on you and contribute to your journey. **Fans:** build your own label and receive exposure to the exciting, new asset class of music royalties while supporting the creation of art you care about.\n\nSign up for our waitlist [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeeBf6PKTrFZGjo49oUoriBSTO5pfiPS4c5K18ktJcJ8HzGZQ/viewform).\n\n[Website](https://decent.xyz)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/decentdotxyz)", "timestamp": 1635387607, "digest": "qsvUuJOGdjj_o49zqtIaSx8wh-92usgJMkkomv-LHNs", "contributor": "0x673Fc290d919684A1B1E46AA69152f7b56FBADD8"}

\\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[6\\]。また、比叡山延暦寺は、国宝である[根本中堂](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%B6%E6%9A%A6%E5%AF%BA%E6%A0%B9%E6%9C%AC%E4%B8%AD%E5%A0%82)をはじめとして、複数の国宝や数多くの重要文化財を保有しています。このように、比叡山延暦寺は歴史的文化的に重要な場所であり、かつては現存しているよりも遥かに多くの文化財や史料を保有していました。\n\nしかし、比叡山延暦寺の文化財や史料は、[1571年の延暦寺焼打ち（元亀の法難）](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))で被害を受け、その多くが失われました。そのため、かつての延暦寺の境内に存在した寺社の様子を伝える史料は数少ないです。\n\n『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、比叡山延暦寺の境内や坂本地区の寺社を描いた現存する古絵図の中では、もっとも詳細なものであるとされており、[1571年](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))以前に存在した可能性のある寺社も描かれています \\[7\\]。そのため、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、かつての比叡山延暦寺に存在した寺社の様子を知るための貴重な史料です。\n\n###

109,378円\n\n第1鋪と第2鋪の2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、縦横サイズが大きいために、国立公文書館は、1回の撮影で地図全体を1枚の写真におさめることができませんでした。 （※第1鋪と第2鋪の縦横サイズは、それぞれ、幅280cm×高さ187.5cm、幅279cm×高さ187.5cm です。） そのため、国立公文書館は、それぞれの地図ごとに、1枚の地図を複数回に分けて撮影しました。 それによって、2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの古地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の古地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\nぼくは、16枚ずつに分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪と第2鋪の古地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\nぼくは、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、これらの古地図の画像ファイルを、ウィキメディア・コモンズのウェブサイトで、パブリックドメインとして公開しました。\n\n*

{"id": "c8b1QqbDPLUA7ggutiOztfuYkefv8Wg1muajK6CuNRo", "title": "METAVERSE AND THE IDEAL WORLD", "body": "Before talking about the ideal world, let's first discuss the political system, economic systems, and ideology of the currently existing society.\n\nMany people think that the concept of the country has always existed. This is an illusion. The entire history of humanity has lasted millions of years from primitive society. However, the first country near the Nile River began to appear bout 5000 to 7000 years ago. In China, we all know that it was in the Xia Dynasty around the 21st century BC, right? Why did that country appear? And will it exist forever in the future? Let's think about this, the emergence of the country, this is the form of a tribe with dozens of people or hundreds of people in primitive society. At that time it was impossible for too many people to gather together. People were in the era of gathering and hunting, if too many people gathered together, there would not be enough food, so there is no conditions to form a country. With the emergence of the agricultural era, the energy density human could gather is much much higher. What does it mean? That is to say, compared to one hectare of forest with one hectare of cultivated land, no doubt cultivated land can feed more people. Therefore, human beings could make large-scale gatherings possible, and then cities and nations can be formed. So the forming of a country is related to technology. It’s the technology that determines the country, not technology determines the form of the country. So geopolitics has been around for thousands of years. However, In a longer time dimension, will it continue to exist?\n\nFirst of all, from the biological point of view, the current genetic sequencing and archaeology have fully proved that modern humans evolved from early Homo sapiens in Africa. We are the same in terms of blood relationships and genetics. No matter which country you are from, Whether it is black, brown, or white, everyone comes from a unified ancestor.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, Today, the civilization of industry and commerce have highly developed, we carried out an unparalleled global division of labor. Any commodity, like a mobile phone, a car, may have the American chip, the Japanese semiconductor included, and the Chinese assembled, right? Many products around us have already condensed the wisdom and labor of people from all over the world, so this is a global collaboration in the economy, which is integrated.\n\nThought and ideology. In history, due to differences in ideology, ideology, and religious beliefs, constant and endless conflicts, and killings have been causing. But for modern society, you can learn about different cultures and different thinking at your fingertips through the Internet. For example, many Chinese understand the way of thinking of Western countries, such as concepts like freedom, democracy, and equality. They also study Western political systems. Americans also study Chinese culture and political systems, right? So in terms of way of thinking, technology has laid the foundation for humans to understand and tolerate each other.\n\nBut currency, there is still no global integration. A philosopher said that the modern monetary system is the greatest slavery. The current monetary system has three problems:\n\n1. Inflation: The Federal Reserve dilutes people's wealth through continuous currency issuance. It is the eternal shackles on the people. In any country’s legal currency system, its genes are destined to be an inflation currency, and there is no solution for the inflation problem;\n2. The inefficiency of cross-border transfers: the currencies of various countries in the world are not unified, the United States has the US dollar, China has the RMB, the Russian ruble, the Indian rupee, and so on. In the process of international economic and trade exchanges, the flow of money will be hindered and frictional. International remittances are time wasted and are costly. Currency has to go through different bank accounting systems, and there are foreign exchange settlement losses, many of which require manual processing. Therefore, after Qin Shihuang unified the six countries, the first thing to do was to unify weights and measures, unify currency, otherwise, it would be difficult to conduct transactions. Today, with the integration of the global economy and trade, we still do not have a unified currency.\n3. The US dollar uses its currency status to isolate and sanction other countries. The US-led SWIFT system can exclude other countries’ banks from entering their system, preventing other countries from conducting normal trade with other countries. It even freezes the assets of other governments and enterprises. This type of event has occurred many times in history.\n\nWhen I learned about Bitcoin in 2013 for the first time, I instantly understood the problems that Bitcoin was trying to solve.\n\nAbove all, I just want to state that politics, economics, and thinking, and ideologies have been constantly changing. There are still a lot of problems in the current economic and political systems in the world. Our future generations will look back to our current political and economic systems in the future, and they will certainly ask why we use such a backward system.\n\nTherefore, the ideal society should be a society without discrimination against certain nationality, no political oppression, and no war anymore; regardless of religious and ethnic differences; currency is unified, without economic oppression and trade friction, economic rules are transparent and freely chosen by the people, A new world where everyone can realize their self-worth. Readers may think that this is just a dream, a Utopia that could never be achieved. Then I want to say that this solution has arrived, the answer is METAVERSE!\n\nIn METAVERSE, do people’s nationalities, races and religious beliefs matter? Is there any political oppression? Is there a METAVERSE police will arrest you and state that your remarks are contrary to the political purpose of METAVERSE? Does Cryptocurrency have national boundaries? Will anyone block you and prevent you from trading on ETH? Are the protocols of ETH, SOLANA, ICP, etc. transparent? Are you free to choose between different protocols, ETH, EOS, ICP, and other different chains? But in the real world, you can choose the nationality you like freely, right? In the Metaverse, there will be various divisions of labor soon. Everything in it needs us to build. like literary works, artistic works, the basic construction in the metaverse, the design and generation of various objects, and so on. There will be production, transactions, consumption, and social activities. Details will be discussed in the next chapter. Hopefully, everyone would find their place and belonging in the metaverse.\n\nIn summary, METAVERSE for the first time makes a perfect ideal world come true, which is in the minds of idealists for thousands of years. Mankind is about to enter a new era. The currency is unified, economic rules are transparent, there is no political oppression, regardless of nationality, religion, and race.

Meaning instead of getting normal rebase awards, that yield will go directly into the pot for one big reward for three lucky OHMies. Plus, the beauty of using $sOHM is that the prize pool continuously grows with every epoch!\n\nIf you don’t win, you can leave your $sOHM in the pool and try again for the next drawing or withdraw the original amount you put in. However, to ensure that OHMies aren’t entering right before the drawing and immediately withdrawing, there’s a 3% early exit fee. To avoid the fee, all you need to do is stay in the pool for 6 days (3,3 — get it?).\n\nLike all prize pools, you’re:\n\n*   Saving your tokens in an account with a chance to reward you or your frens.\n*   Eligible to win until you withdraw.\n*   Able to withdraw your deposit at any time after the 6 day fairness period\n\nJoin 3,3 Together now on [PoolTogether](https://app.pooltogether.com/pools/mainnet/sOHM) or directly on the Olympus DAO [App](https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/33-together).\n\n## **3,3 Together FAQ:**\n\n## What is 3,3 Together?\n\n3,3 Together is a no loss prize pool for sOHM tokens. Based on the idea of “[Prize savings accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize-linked_savings_account)” it offers the chance to win large prizes without risking your deposited amount. This is possible because the prizes are made up of the sOHM staking rewards for all depositors.\n\nWhen you deposit your sOHM tokens into the 3,3 Together you don’t receive any staking rewards. Instead, the staking rewards of everyone are combined and given out randomly as prizes every 3 days.\n\nThe sOHM prize pool was created with the [PoolTogether protocol](https://pooltogether.com/).\n\n## Will I lose my staking rewards?\n\nYes! The prize is created by combining the staking rewards from all deposits. That means when you deposit you will no longer get your staking rewards. You will still get your original deposit amount back. For example, if you deposit 10 sOHM you will withdraw 10 sOHM\n\n## Will I lose my sOHM?\n\nNo! This is a no loss prize pool. If you deposit 1 sOHM you will be able to withdraw 1 sOHM. Keep in mind though, while deposited you will not receive the staking rewards. Those go to the prize.\n\n## Do I need to re-enter for every prize?\n\nNo! You are automatically eligible to win all prizes until you’ve withdrawn.\n\n## What is the early exit fee?\n\nTo keep the system fair there is a time decay early exit fee. This prevents someone from depositing, having a chance to win and then withdrawing immediately after. The early exit fee is 3% and it decays linearly to 0% over 6 days. Assuming it has been more than 6 days since your last deposit, you can withdraw freely.\n\n## What are my chances to win?\n\nYour chances to win are directly proportional to the amount of sOHM you deposit. If there is a total of 100 sOHM deposited and you deposit 1 sOHM you will have a 1% chance to win.\n\n## How do I know this is fair?\n\nThe winner is selected using the Chainlink VRF oracle.\n\n## How do I know if I win?\n\nThe tokens are automatically transferred to the winners wallet! You will see your token balance increase.\n\n## Isn’t it better just to hold my sOHM?\n\nThat is completely up to your preference! If you’d prefer to just earn the staking rewards then you should hold your sOHM. Think of this as an additional option to put your sOHM to use. You won’t get the standard staking rewards but you will have a chance to win large prizes. Keep in mind, you can always do both!\n\n## About Olympus DAO:\n\nOlympusDAO is building a global, community-owned and decentralized economy to introduce stability & transparency back into financial markets and create financial inclusion for all.

{"id": "tjGy8R7GYjyNXk_GhtNFBk7-JCe75rx9Yj8xQ1z9JMM", "title": "Self-directed, lifelong learning, Part I — A paradigm shift", "body": "## Educational institutions want you to think in terms of “years and grades” — as if learning or knowledge had a definitive start and end dates, or that all learners can be measured the same.\n\n![Author unknown.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1070/1\\*Cybn6JJSdbzH8UOZ1e-zOg.jpeg)\n\nWhen we go to school we’re introduced to a set curriculum and a class schedule outlining what our course load will look like for the next 9 months. We’re put on a schedule of what we’ll read, what we’ll see and experience. The underlying idea is that someone else knows what we need to know, and they come just in time to teach us. Furthermore, there’s a defined timeframe with the destination of an “education” firmly in sight. It’s built around an idea that we’ll all be the same and we’ll all end up in the same place. And this space is known as the bell curve.\n\nAnd like all institutions, modern education is caught up in multiple layers of bureaucracy, politics and business. Too often, the primary goal of education, particularly among modern policymakers, is to create what is called “a well-rounded workforce.” Or to ensure that a labor pool possesses the socialization and communication skills to ‘succeed’ in corporate environments. In this regard, learning is reduced to the lowest common denominator — decided by someone else. Personal learning goals and self-directed interests must be subjugated to the greater goals of corporate business models. One can see this play out in Silicon Valley mindsets as it relates to new ‘edtech’ startups ready to capitalize on our most valuable resource — youth. More on this in a different post.\n\nThe underlying strategy for conventional schooling is reductionist. Formal educational programs and working environments are essentially reductionist too. Education design is focused on the limitations of the individual — what they can and cannot handle, what what they know, and how they learn. Educational systems such as modern colleges and companies work to mold us into a standardized individual, and they do this through formal education and socialization.\n\n![Image Credit: Yau Hoong Tang (Flickr)](https://miro.medium.com/max/900/1\\*zN8o3sam5R1Mlwb81ZtgQA.gif)\n\n## The Self-Directed Learning Lens\n\nTo get anything out of self-directed learning, you have to rebel against the assumptions of formal education that there’s only a set of things you should know to be a successful employee or learner. We must reject the concept of the acceptable and the homogenized.\n\nTo be your own teacher, you have to be able to be your own best ally AND your worst enemy. It requires self awareness to self-regulate, and self awareness requires introspection — thinking about what we want and more importantly, why we want it. Even after you figure out what you want, you have to put it out in the universe, and eventually drown out the voices that seek to pull you back to formalized education…and an outdated conception of work.\n\nIt takes effort, tenacity and denial. We often think creativity and learning are byproducts of flow, where our brains expand, cool ideas come to us and everything just flows naturally. The truth of the matter is something completely different.\n\nCreativity, learning and productivity don’t come to you magically (well, sometimes :P). More often, though, you have to open the hood, look inside, knock on a few things and maybe do some things you might not expect, that might scare you at times.\n\nBut this is good. It’s about breaking things down, putting things together, experimenting, constructing, operating and deconstructing your way, not to an answer, necessarily — but to a better question. Increasing your capacity for self-reflection, self-regulation and metacognition will serve you in ways you can’t imagine. Or maybe, you can :)\n\n## Learning — and the Process of Making the Self Visible\n\nSelf-directed learning is difficult because in order to truly get what you want out of education, you have to create not just a path of your own design, but sometimes the map itself!\n\nYou have to be willing to take risks, and navigate uncharted territories, which is scary, and no one is knocking on your doors telling you to do it. Learning is difficult later in life, because we learn risk-taking and survival skills when we are children, but along the way we start to lose them. We cling to the conventional ways of learning, and what’s accepted in the workplace and by society.\n\nLearning for the sake of learning, or learning to make something happen requires self-motivation and putting energy into something intangible — sometimes to the point of exhaustion. Self-engaged learning is often viewed as a waste of time. The prevailing belief is that once you’re ‘an adult’, it’s time to get down to business — it’s time to start earning a living. However, autonomy and self-determination may be the very connector between learning and work. It’s often the impetus for long-term success and happiness.\n\n![Author unknown.](https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1\\*uLqta2rwl9aEPYgbRrOfeg.png)\n\n## How to Get Started\n\nTo get started, you have to initiate the metacognitive process, which implies the time commitment to learn, to create and to be observant. You must learn to think about learning — what it means to you and how it can be practically applied in your life. Next, you have to make time to learn, and just as importantly, admit that you don’t have all the answers. Learning is about asking the right questions, sensemaking and exploring possible solutions. It requires commitment, hard work and risk-management. It’s often inconvenient, uncomfortable and messy. But oh, so so worth it.\n\n### Remember:\n\n**You can learn at any time, at any age, and about anything.**\n\n**You have the ultimate decision about what you learn. If you don’t get what you want out of it, you don’t have to do it anymore.**\n\n**You can get access to knowledge at any time if you ask the right questions, and put the time and effort into doing it.**\n\n**Your goals are your goals, and so long as they’re moral, authentic, and legal — you should pursue them.**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*n8aX_aSM__kowiCHlvMiBg.png)\n\n* Twitter: <https://twitter.com/futurescouts>\n* Facebook: <https://www.facebook.com/futurescouts.cc>\n* Instagram: <https://instagram.com/futurescouts>\n* Medium: [https://gazette.futurescouts.cc](https://gazette.futurescouts.cc/)\n* LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/company/future-scouts>\n\n*Contact one of our Phyle leaders through the website, and follow us on the socials to keep up to date.*", "timestamp": 1635400306, "digest": "LBY3jppT42vlax6HaatRZdrQf80CIGrOp29cASD2Gbo", "contributor": "0x2d3547e5D3c5d188Edf9C4E0BA71F11b1B3d45dD"}

你的钱包里有什么？\n\n如果你曾经在以太坊（或任何启用智能合约的区块链）上进行过交易，那么你可能已经在区块浏览器上查找过，并看到了这堆信息。\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gvutqn1ndyj30s60ol76c.jpg)\n\n学习阅读交易的细节将是所有以太坊数据分析和知识的基础，所以让我们来介绍所有的部分以及如何在SQL中使用它们。**我将使用[Dune Analytics](https://dune.xyz/browse/dashboards)来运行我的查询**，但还有许多其他工具，你可以用来查询链，如Big Query和Flipside Crypto。\n\n如果你对SQL和以太坊完全陌生，我建议先阅读：[初学者概述](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-guide-to-basic-sql-while-learning-ethereum-at-the-same-time-9eac17a05929)。\n\n## 指南概述\n\n我们将分四个层次介绍交易：\n\n1. 事务的基础知识\n2. 函数调用和状态\n3. 内部交易 (Traces)\n4. 日志 (Events Emitted)\n\n作为我们交易实例的基础，我们将使用Mirror Crowdfund合约。简单地说，这是一个智能合约，允许你向该合约捐赠ETH，以获得ERC20（可替换）或ERC721（NFTs）代币。合约的创建者可以通过关闭众筹基金来提取这些资金。这绝不是一个简单的合约，但我想在这里说的是，你不需要了解所有的solidity代码来开始分析--你只需要知道如何浏览上面的四个层次。\n\n我们要研究的三个交易是：\n\n1. 创建/部署众筹合约\n2. 向合约缴纳的ETH\n3. 关闭和提取合约中的资金\n\n题外话，我们也刚刚开放了众筹给任何人使用，所以如果你好奇或想创建一个众筹，请到mirror.xyz/dashboard开始。\n\n## 创建/部署众筹合约\n\n第一个交易:\n[0x5e5ef5dd9d147028f9bc21127e3de774a80c56a2e510d95f41984e6b7af1b8db](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5e5ef5dd9d147028f9bc21127e3de774a80c56a2e510d95f41984e6b7af1b8db)\n\n让我们从交易的基本情况开始。\n\n1. 每笔交易都有一个独特的keccak256交易哈希值（**transaction hash**），包括几个不同的变量\n2. 有一个基于交易开采时间的相关区块号码（**blocknumber**），通常每15秒就有一个新的区块被创建。\n3. **From**是签署交易的人，**To**是被交互的合约地址\n4. **Value**是指从签名者的钱包中转移的ETH价值。即使该值为0，也不意味着交易中没有转移ETH。\n5. **Gas**有点复杂（尤其是EIP-1559），但只要记住这个公式：Gas Price \\* Gas Used by Transaction = Transaction Fee\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gvuv1t4k6yj311r04jjsm.jpg)\n\n这是函数调用和传入的参数的字节码。前8个字符（4个字节）是函数签名**0x849a3aa3**，是函数名称和参数类型的哈希值。然而，这个哈希并不一定是唯一的，这有可能导致被黑等安全问题。在这个案例中，这个函数调用合约功能来创建众筹合约（它是一个代理，但我们不会去讨论这个问题）。\n\nFunction:createCrowdfund((uint256,uint256,bytes32)\\[\\], (address,uint256), string, string, address, address, uint256, uint256, uint256)\n\n如果你点击 \"decode input data\"（解码输入数据），这就会显示出来，你也可以看到各种变量值的设置。随后的每64个字符（32字节）都是不同的输入变量。众筹有三个层次的版本。在BLVKHVND的这次众筹中，他们使用的数量为1000、250和50，价格分别为0.1、0.3和1ETH。\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gvuvabzieuj30sc05x3z3.jpg)\n\n注意，价格实际上显示为100000000000000000 ，这是因为前18个零代表小数。我们必须在数据中通过除以10^18来进行转换。\n\n这是一个很大的问题，让我们开始查询吧。Dune有一个名为ethereum.transactions的表，其中有我们上面谈到的自第一个区块以来每笔交易的所有变量。我们可以查询这个表，看看在过去几个月里0x849a3aa3的出现。\n\n```SQL\nSELECT * FROM ethereum.transactions \nWHERE \"block_time\" > now() - interval '3 months'\nAND \"data\" is not null\nAND SUBSTRING ( encode(\"data\", 'hex'), 1, 8 ) = '849a3aa3'\n```\n\nethereum.transactions是一个非常大的表，所以如果你在没有过滤器的情况下查询，查询会超时（需要30分钟以上）。按区块时间过滤通常是最有用的，在这种情况下，我们要取3个月内发生的所有行。另外，许多交易只是ETH转账，没有附加任何数据，所以我们将通过只保留数据不为空来过滤掉。现在为了检查函数签名，我们需要将数据从十六进制编码成一个字符串，然后使用SUBSTRING只取位置1到位置8的字符。\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gvuvgw8fh0j314k0c7q6q.jpg)\n\n现在是复杂的部分，内部事务和事件的排列。对于这一点，看一下代码会更容易。如果你进入etherscan的[合约标签](https://etherscan.io/address/0x15312b97389a1dc3bcaba7ae58ebbd552e606ed2#code)，在文件1 of 10上做ctrl+f，你会发现以下代码（我编辑了一些片段，使其更易读）。\n\n```solidity\nfunction createCrowdfund(\n        ...variables...\n    ) external returns (address crowdfundProxy) {\n        ...some variable prep code...\n\n        crowdfundProxy = address(\n            new CrowdfundWithPodiumEditionsProxy{\n                salt: keccak256(abi.encode(symbol_, operator_))\n            }(treasuryConfig, operator_)\n        );\n\n        emit CrowdfundDeployed(crowdfundProxy, name_, symbol_, operator_);\n\n        ...register to treasury code...\n    }\n```\n\n这里的第一个关键行是crowdfundProxy = address(contract_to_be_created)，这就是部署新的合约并创建一个CREATE 0类型的内部交易。\n\n转移ETH也会创建一个CALL类型的内部交易，我们将在下一个交易中看到它。\n\n我们可以通过如下sql查询所有被创建的众筹合约：\n\n```SQL\nSELECT tx.\"block_time\", tx.\"from\", tr.\"type\", tr.\"code\"\nFROM ethereum.transactions tx \nLEFT JOIN ethereum.traces tr ON tx.\"hash\"=tr.\"tx_hash\" --tracks internal transactions\nWHERE tx.\"to\" = '\\x15312b97389a1dc3bcaba7ae58ebbd552e606ed2' -- crowdfund podiums edition\nAND tr.\"type\" = 'create' \n```\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gvuw7xx752j314g0aswif.jpg)\n\n我们需要ethereum.transactions，因为我们想过滤只与工厂合约相关联的交易内部交易）。这样做的主要原因是内部交易并不总是与整体交易有相同的目的合约地址（To）。我们可以在事务哈希上连接这些表，然后只过滤create类型的内部事务。\n\n这里的第二个关键行是emit CrowdfundDeployed，它创建了一个存储在节点中的日志，但不在块中。如果你看下日志，会发现EditionCreated事件也被排了出来，但这是来自另一个实际创建ERC721代币的合约（因此是不同的合约地址）。\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gvuwl19y7wj311q0j1418.jpg)\n\n与函数签名类似，事件也有一个唯一的哈希值，位于Topic 0中。对应上面的事件：0x5133bb164b64ffa4461bc0c782a5c0e71cdc9d6c6ef5aa9af84f7fd2cd966d8e是CrowdfundDeployed的哈希值，0xbaf1f6ab5aa5406df2735e70c52585e630f9744f4ecdedd8b619e983e927f0b6是EditionCreated的哈希值。\n\n我们可以通过查询dune中的ethereum.logs表，可以看到所有被创建的众筹：\n\n```SQL\nSELECT * FROM ethereum.logs\nWHERE \"topic1\"='\\x5133bb164b64ffa4461bc0c782a5c0e71cdc9d6c6ef5aa9af84f7fd2cd966d8e'::bytea\n```\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gvuwnv9wzzj314f0axjv1.jpg)\n\ntopic2和topic3通常保存ETH转账的数据，不然事件数据将显示在数据栏中。我们将在后面详细介绍如何处理这个问题。\n\n日志是非常有用的，因为它们可以用来排列状态变量，而不仅仅是函数调用值（TheGraph使用日志来为GraphQL查询建立子图模型）。接下来，我们将动用我们所涉及的一切来研究ETH对我们新创建的众筹合约的贡献（地址：0x320d83769eb64096ea74b686eb586e197997f930 ）。\n\n*如果你能走到这一步，那么你已经通过了所有艰难的概念。给自己拍拍胸脯吧! 在接下来的两节中，我们将真正进入细节，所以如果你需要的话，可以休息一下。*\n\n## 向合约缴纳的ETH\n\n第二个交易：\n[0xd4ce80a5ee62190c5f5d5a5a7e95ba7751c8f3ef63ea0e4b65a1abfdbbb9d1ef](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd4ce80a5ee62190c5f5d5a5a7e95ba7751c8f3ef63ea0e4b65a1abfdbbb9d1ef)\n\n这个交易比较容易理解。Jesse支付了1个ETH，从BLVKHVND众筹中铸造了一个tokenId 167的NFT。他还得到了1000个HVND，这是众筹基金根据捐款规模发放的ERC20代币。\n\n但是，如果我们想看看在一段时间内筹集了多少ETH，或者卖出了多少个NFT呢？有时合约会在etherscan上的Read Contract里有一个查看功能，你可以看到总余额。但目前这个案例中，合约并没有这个功能。\n\n记住，函数调用会改变状态数据，我们需要通过对交易历史的汇总来拼凑整体状态数据。有时，合约的整体状态可以在事件中发出，比如Compound V2的AccrueInterest事件。\n\n在我们的例子中，需要在一个查询中做两件事来获得贡献的ETH总量：\n\n1. 获取调用了\"**contribute**\"方法的交易\n2. 通过过滤具有**CALL**类型的内部交易，求出转移的ETH总量\n\n记住，可以通过对etherscan上的输入数据（input data）进行解码来获得方法的函数签名（function signature）。\n\n```SQL\nSELECT SUM(tr.\"value\"/1e18) as contribution FROM ethereum.transactions tx \nLEFT JOIN ethereum.traces tr ON tx.\"hash\" = tr.\"tx_hash\"\n--transactions filtering \nWHERE tx.\"to\" = '\\x320d83769eb64096ea74b686eb586e197997f930'::bytea\nAND tx.\"data\" is not null\nAND SUBSTRING ( encode(tx.\"data\", 'hex'), 1, 8 ) IN ('a08f793c', 'ce4661bb')\n--traces filtering \nAND tr.\"success\"\nAND tr.\"value\" > 0\nAND tr.\"call_type\" = 'call'\n```\n\n严格来说，还有一个叫做contributionForPodium的方法，这就是我们在上面检查两个函数签名的原因。CALL类型实际上在操作码层面也有子类型，所以我们需要指定具体的基础调用类型的调用（如果你熟悉delegatecall，那么你会知道这将给我们一个双数）。我们加上交易哈希，然后除以10^18，得到正确的ETH的值。\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gvuxa9lrvjj309203s0sm.jpg)\n\n让我们来看看最后一笔交易，在这里，数据开始变得非常棘手。\n\n## 关闭和提取合约中的资金\n\n第三个交易：\n[0xe9d5fefde77d4086d0f64dd1403f9b6e8e12aac74db238ebf11252740c3f65a8](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe9d5fefde77d4086d0f64dd1403f9b6e8e12aac74db238ebf11252740c3f65a8)\n\n在这个交易中，我们可以看到转移了337个ETH和1,012,965个HVND代币（后者在第一次交易中由operatorPercent方法处理）。在这个函数被调用后，合约会正常的ERC20的方式执行。\n\n在一个众筹已经结束的情况下，我们可以从这个交易的数据中得到筹集的总额--比如在CALL类型的内部交易中转移的价值。不过，最好是把它和一个事件联系起来，以防有一些我们不知道的转账行为。但是，等等，为什么日志是不可读的？\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gvuxh59to9j30od0mf0vl.jpg)\n\n好吧，这就是我们开始进入一些相当混乱的模式的地方了。早些时候我提到，这个众筹基金是作为代理部署的--这意味着它就像一个空的USB，插在实际持有逻辑规则的电脑上。创建USB要比电脑便宜得多--这种逻辑规则对链上也适用（除了gas花费的成本）。如果你想更详细的了解代理模式，可以看看OpenZeppelin团队的[这篇好文章](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-state-of-smart-contract-upgrades/)。\n\n在这种情况下，计算机被称为逻辑规则，只部署一次。代理被多次部署，它没有合约代码中的逻辑功能或事件。因此，etherscan并不具备在日志中显示解码数据的能力。那么，我们如何把这些拼凑起来呢？我们可以采取事件的keccak256哈希值，就像我们对函数签名所做的那样。但在这里，阅读代码将帮助你节省一些时间。如果你去查看工厂合约上的Read Contract，你会看到逻辑合约的地址。\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gvuxoiy02fj30au034dfs.jpg)\n\n在那里，我们可以找到代码中的closeFunding()函数：\n\n```solidity\nfunction closeFunding() external onlyOperator nonReentrant {\n        ...code...\n\n        _mint(operator, operatorTokens);\n        // Announce that funding has been closed.\n        emit FundingClosed(address(this).balance, operatorTokens);\n\n        ...ETH value transfers...\n    }\n```\n\nETH价值转移不会发出事件，因为它们只是内部交易。而如果你熟悉ERC20标准的运作方式，你就会知道mint实际上创建了一个转移事件（意味着已经涵盖了我们的第一个事件）。这意味着FundingClosed必须是第二个日志，主题为0x352ce94da8e3109dc06c05ed84e8a0aaf9ce2c4329dfd10ad1190cf620048972。你能想出为什么不可能是第三条日志吗（提示：前两条日志和第三条日志之间有什么关键区别）？\n\n有了这些知识，我们就可以像其他事件一样，通过一些花哨的数据解码来查询这个事件（记住参数是每64个字符（32字节）。我们必须把它变成一个字符串来切分，然后我们把它改成一个数字，再除以10^18来去掉小数。\n\n```SQL\nSELECT \"contract_address\", \n        bytea2numeric( decode ( SUBSTRING ( encode(\"data\", 'hex') , 1, 64 ), 'hex'))/1e18 as eth_raised, \n        bytea2numeric ( decode ( SUBSTRING ( encode(\"data\", 'hex') , 65 , 64 ), 'hex'))/1e18 as tokens_allocated_owned\nFROM ethereum.logs\nWHERE \"topic1\"='\\x352ce94da8e3109dc06c05ed84e8a0aaf9ce2c4329dfd10ad1190cf620048972'::bytea\nAND \"contract_address\"='\\x320d83769eb64096ea74b686eb586e197997f930'::bytea\n```\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gvuyfpj43vj30xc02xaa6.jpg)\n\n恭喜你，你现在知道如何处理ethereum.transactions、ethereum.traces和ethereum.logs。它们总是可以通过交易哈希来连接，然后剩下的就是知道如何用encode/decode、substring和一些bytea操作符来处理数据。Woohoo!\n\n我们也可以对上一个事务中的contribute方法做这个练习。因为这一切都发生在代理合同上。\n\n## 把它们放在一起\n\n现在，如果我们不得不去跟踪函数签名和事件主题--以及对每个查询中的所有变量进行解码--我想我们现在都会放弃数据分析。幸运的是，大多数数据服务都有一些合约解码的变化，这意味着我可以给一个合约地址，ABI和Dune将为我解决解码的问题。这样一来，事件/功能就变成了它们自己的表，我就可以很容易地用这个来做之前的\"total contributions\"查询。\n\n```SQL\nWITH \n    union_sum as (\n        SELECT SUM(\"amount\")/1e18 as raised FROM mirror.\"CrowdfundWithPodiumEditionsLogic_evt_Contribution\"\n        WHERE \"contract_address\"='\\x320d83769eb64096ea74b686eb586e197997f930'\n        \n        UNION ALL \n        \n        SELECT SUM(\"amount\")/1e18 as raised FROM mirror.\"CrowdfundWithPodiumEditionsLogic_evt_ContributionForEdition\"\n        WHERE \"contract_address\"='\\x320d83769eb64096ea74b686eb586e197997f930'\n    )\n    \nSELECT SUM(\"raised\") FROM union_sum\n```\n\n<https://dune.xyz/queries/192571>\n\n值得庆幸的是，这种查询的可读性更强，更容易编写。他们甚至还照顾到了代理/工厂的逻辑模式--感谢团队! 如果没有这个抽象，我保证数据分析的编写会混乱十倍，调试会糟糕一百倍。Dune还有很多其他有用的表格，比如Prices.usd用于每日代币价格，dex.trades用于所有主要交易所的所有代币交易（以及事件nft.trades用于OpenSea NFT交易）。\n\n虽然大部分时间你都在玩解码数据，但了解这些数据下面的真正内容将帮助你在Web3中更快地提高水平！此外，你现在是以太坊的使用者。另外，你现在可以流利地使用etherscan了--我保证这将是未来每个密码工作中重要的一部分。我希望这对你有帮助，如果你需要一些帮助，请随时联系我。\n\n# 写在最后\n\n**数据里藏着黄金屋，学会分析链上数据是一把掘金铲，虽然有些难，但还是应该花时间去做。**\n\n我试着用上面学到的内容，对我发起的一个众筹做了个简单的数据分析：\n\n```SQL\nselect count(tx.*) as Backers ,  SUM(tx.\"value\"/1e18) as Raised,

{"id": "dVLIv4IrLs1CHxc9nYXlpQCirAwUxSojrW28rnj7fuM", "title": "everPay Protocol Light Paper", "body": "everPay\\[1\\] is a real-time blockchain payment protocol built by everFinance. Locking up crypto assets from public chains into smart contracts can help map them into its protocol for users to make transfers and payments. everPay reduces the transaction cost to as few as 1 dollar for up to a million transactions. The storage-based Consensus paradigm frees everPay from performance limitations and makes it a rival for traditional internet applications in TPS, which depends on nothing but the application architecture and server performance.\n\neverPay is used for token payment as Stripe\\[2\\] is for fiat payments. The everPay protocol has important blockchain properties —— transparency, trustworthiness and immutability. It allows anyone to become a detector in order to monitor ledger changes within the system. Besides, an explorer is available for any user to view the everPay ledger, thus ensuring one-to-one mapping between locked-up assets and its wrapped counterparts in circulation.\n\n## Storage-based Consensus Paradigm\n\nThe storage-based Consensus paradigm\\[3\\]\\[4\\] (Abbreviated as SCP) is the next-generation paradigm for blockchain application development proposed by everFinance. In Ethereum’s model, computations are executed by all the full nodes, which then generate and store the global state for query. Different from it, the SCP manages to separate computation from storage. To be more specific, the blockchain is merely used for data storage, while the off-chain clients/servers are responsible for executing all the computations and storing all the states generated.\n\nThe SCP uses off-chain smart contracts, which can be written in any programming language, with all the inputs coming from a storage-based blockchain. In this paradigm, the blockchain is very much like a hard drive and the off-chain smart contracts can be run on any device with computing capabilities. Using a blockchain as a hard drive ensures the immutability and traceability of the stored data, which is thus guaranteed to be trusted. As a result, off-chain smart contracts can ensure the ultimate consistency of state by performing computations on trustable data.   \n\nThe applications built on top of the SCP feature both the transparency and trustworthiness of blockchains as well as the high performance and availability of traditional internet applications. The SCP has the following advantages:\n\n![Empowerment by SCP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PRRFz13TB_tuK3jCgoKDI.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\n1. Composability: Business operations between traditional financial services requires account checking, which is complex and error-prone. Using a SCP can include all the financial transaction records in the blockchain, thereby converting the traditional financial services into blockchain applications. This facilitates not only automated account checking, but also rapid coordination and efficient combination of applications.\n2. Low Development Barriers: Smart contracts are required to be written in Solidity using an EVM, while off-chain computation programs can be written in any programming language. That Makes it so developers can convert traditional applications into blockchain applications.\n3. No Performance Limitation: Off-chain computation delivers superior performances similar to traditional applications because the off-chain servers can process massive transactions. In this way, the TPS merely depends on the machine performance of servers and the technical architecture of applications.\n4. Low Consensus Cost: It’ll only cost 1 dollar to process up to a million transactions.\n\nThe SCP is designed by the inspirations of Arweave’s smart contract SmartWeave and Ethereum’s L2 scaling solution Rollup, which improves their availability.\n\n### Improvements on SmartWeave\n\n> [SmartWeave](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/SmartWeave) is a smart contracting platform built on top of the Arweave network. It allows users and developers to build programs whose execution is trustable and decentralized. One of the unique features of SmartWeave is the process of lazy evaluation, which removes the burden of processing smart contracts from the nodes and moves it to the users. This means that, instead of running every piece of code on every machine in the network, contract states are computed locally on the machines that request them.\n\nSmartWeave\\[5\\] is a decentralized contract platform that is open to all. The off-chain computation enabled by SmartWeave delivers higher scalability at the expense of introducing a new problem. The problem lies in that SmartWeave is prone to DDoS attacks, which means a large amount of invalid data is transmitted to all the computing nodes via Arweave, leading to latency in consensus and unavailability. When DDoS attackers maliciously send massive false transactions to the blockchain, node clients have to download them before verifying, therefore taking up a large part of bandwidth. In this case, valid transactions are submerged in the flood of false transactions, lowering the accuracy rate of data. To some extent, DDoS attacks may even lead to latency in client state computation.\n\nTo prevent DDoS attacks and ensure the availability of applications, everFinance has introduced a coordinator to compute and verify all the data of applications for the first time, and then includes batches of data into the chain. The coordinator acts like a rollup built on top of Ethereum by packaging transactions in batches, then including them into the chain. All the data packaged can be verified, SmartWeave’s “lazy evaluation” ensures verifiability, and Rollups guarantee the data accuracy which helps avoid DDoS attacks.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\nThe everPay protocol operates on top of a DAO with complete transparency and verifiability. The DAO applies the SCP in both data sharing and computation. The DAO members fall into three categories —— a coordinator, detectors and watchmen. The DAO has an independent component ProposalHub, which is used to collect and aggregate the proposals and signatures of the DAO members and then execute proposals.\n\n![How we work](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bKtANsUL0YvcUn8MZSujH.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\nIn the protocol, all of the DAO members integrate the same off-chain smart contract code, and conform to uniform business rules. Without independent data communication, the contract programs among different members completely rely on Arweave for data communication and downloading. The contract programs will connect Arweave for data downloading, and transactions will be processed in the same sequence as they are stored in Arweave. After obtaining transaction data, the contract programs will compute them in the off-chain smart contracts to generate the final state with consistency.\n\n### The Coordinator\n\nThe coordinator verifies transactions and then includes valid ones onto the blockchain. Each and every transaction is verified in real time, a batch of verified transactions will eventually be packaged into a batch that will then go onto the blockchain. When receiving users’ transactions, the coordinator’s server will perform computation and verification in real time, and then update its balance to the latest state. The coordinator is a highly available back-end service program that guarantees the sequence and validity of transactions. It will include a batch of transactions into the chain according to the time order every few minutes.\n\nDespite its ability to verify transactions and include them onto the chain, the coordinator is unable to attack the DAO ledger. The reason for it is that all the DAO members verify the ledger on their own. A consensus is reached on the basis of the off-chain smart contract programs and trustable data instead of being determined by the coordinator. With the SCP ensuring its objectivity, the consensus is actually not affected by any of the DAO members. In the DAO, the coordinator is just like an accountant who only maintains the ledger, but has no access to the assets. The cross-chain transfer of assets is handled by watchmen. For in-depth details, go to the “Watchmen” section.\n\nTo ensure an optimal user experience as well as real-time transactions, the coordinator has an independent node for now. It can censor transactions when putting them in order. However, the censorship timeframe can be as little as 10 minutes from transaction collection to inclusion onto the chain. It is important to note that a single-node coordinator may result in transaction censorship and ordering. To limit these risks, an everPay token will be created in order to enable mechanisms like staking and slashing. \n\n### Detectors\n\nThe off-chain everPay protocol smart contract code will be open sourced so that it can be run on anyone’s device to compute the everPay transactions.\n\nAnyone can be a detector in everPay’s protocol as long as they download the off-chain smart contract code. It will automatically load the transaction data onto Arweave, then they’ll be able to compute and verify transactions. When their programs sync to the latest Arweave block, detectors will obtain the final state of the application. Since all the detectors run the same everPay protocol code with immutable and traceable on-chain data as an input, the final state obtained by each detector is consistent.\n\n### Watchmen\n\nIn the everPay protocol, watchmen play a crucial role in multi-sig governance. They are responsible for creating and signing proposals. A proposal will be executed only when it is signed by most of (i.e. more than 51% of) the watchmen.\n\nThe ultimate everPay protocol security is ensured by the objectivity of the SCP and the Arweave network. Watchmen can manage the assets locked by users through proposals. When creating a proposal, watchmen need to handle it with the off-chain smart contract code. Moreover, proposals are created and signed in automated ways. Since the final state generated via the off-chain smart contract and on-chain trustable data is immutable, the everPay protocol will automatically detect it and create a quick response if any watchman submits any invalid proposals.\n\nWatchmen guarantee the legitimacy of multi-sig governance. In the SCP, the consensus is secured by Arweave’s perpetual storage. Even if there are only a few watchmen, a strong consensus can be built around the application. However, just as any upgrade of an Ethereum node needs to be accepted by miners, any change to the off-chain smart contract requires approval of watchmen. If a program to be upgraded is agreed upon by watchmen, the process of creating proposals needs to be adapted to it. \n\n### ProposalHub \n\nThe proposalHub is used to collect the signed proposals from watchmen in order to be executed. Despite the fact that it is not required, ProposalHub can boost the efficiency in collecting and executing the signed proposals.\n\n# Account System\n\nThe everPay account system is a highly flexible support to account systems of various blockchains. \n\nWhen a blockchain wallet that everPay supports is connected to everPay, the wallet address will be set as the ID of the corresponding everPay account by default. For example, if the Ethereum wallet 0x263…859 is connected to everPay, the ID of the corresponding everPay account will be same as the Ethereum wallet address; if the Arweave wallet 5NP...HXo is connected to everPay, the ID of the corresponding everPay account will be same as the Arweave wallet address. Furthermore, all the everPay transactions are signed using the private keys that correspond to the everPay account IDs.\n\neverPay currently supports Ethereum and Arweave. As a growing number of blockchains are supported, everPay will allow more blockchain addresses to be set as everPay account IDs in the near future.\n\n## Internet Account\n\neverPay also supports traditional internet accounts so that your email addresses or phone numbers can be set as account IDs. In addition, the WebAuthn\\[6\\] technology allows everPay to use the encryption chip embedded in devices like phones to be the private key of an everPay account. To ensure account security, your everPay account can be bound to your hardware device. When making an everPay transaction, you need to sign it by calling in the encryption chip in your hardware through biological recognition. If your device is lost or needs to be changed, your everPay account can be recovered through your email account in a secure way. Take the Gmail account recovery for example. To avoid forgery, all the emails are signed using Google’s security key, which can be verified with cryptography. With the signature verification functionality of emails, everPay’s account system can verify the signed email content for account recovery.\n\nAnother method of account recovery is contact verification. You can set multiple key contacts as guards for your account in advance. For account recovery, you can replace the public key of your everPay account by using signatures of multiple guards. The method is very similar to that of the smart contract wallet Argent.\n\n# Payment OpActions\n\nTo adapt to different payment scenarios, everPay supports a variety of opActions. Users and merchants can use different payment opActions according to their demands. As the payment businesses expand, everPay will support more payment opActions.\n\nAll the payment opActions can be integrated into applications by downloading the everpay-js SDK. It requires only a few lines of code to call the opActions in order to make transactions.\n\n### Basic OpActions\n\n**Mint**\n\nBefore making payments, you need to deposit native assets from other blockchains into everPay first. When making deposits, you only need to pay the transaction fees charged by the blockchains where the deposits come from. Different chains have different mint times, deposits from Ethereum require 6 blocks to confirm, while those from Arweave require 15 Arweave blocks. When successful, the balance on your everPay account will increase accordingly.\n\n**Burn**\n\nYou can burn the assets in your everPay account to get them back to their native blockchains. For this to occur, you have to wait for watchmen to detect your burn transaction after it is packaged with other transactions and included into Arwearve. Watchmen will verify all the burn transactions independently and then create corresponding burn proposals. As long as a burn proposal is signed by over 51% of watchmen, it will be executed on the native blockchain to unlock the original assets. After it succeeds, the balance on your everPay account will decrease accordingly. The burned assets will then return to their native blockchain.\n\n**Transfer**\n\nYou can make a transfer as long as your everPay account holds assets. However, the transfer differs from a blockchain transfer, which charges you a gas fee in order to pay miners. An everPay transfer in its essence is a meta transaction, which means you can pay the transaction fee with the assets to be transferred. It needs you to sign with your own everPay private key. All the transfers sent to the coordinator are verified instantly, and the invalid ones dismissed.\n\nTo date, everPay has supported the account models for Ethereum and Arweave. Making it that recipient address in a transfer can be either Ethereum or Arweave addresses, but the recipient is not required to register in everPay, which supports any valid Ethereum or Arweave address by default. In the future, everPay will integrate more blockchains to support their account systems. Integrating Internet accounts in the future will allow assets to be transferred between blockchain accounts and Internet accounts.\n\n### Bundle\n\neverPay allows multiple transfers to be bundled in a single transaction for execution, which is equivalent to the transactional execution of multiple transfers. When you make a bundle transaction, each of the transfers bundled in it must be executed successfully. If any of them fail, the whole bundled transaction will be reverted.\n\nIn addition to making payments to multiple recipients at once, a bundled transaction can be used in decentralized token swaps where the transfers among multiple counterparties are bundled in a single transaction. This can help ensure that the transfer bundles will be settled only after each of them are done successfully.\n\n### Aswap\n\nAswap is a transaction opAction specially designed for the orderbook mode. Different from a bundled transaction, an aswap transaction refers to an atomic swap of assets between a makers and a takers. If the makers and takers transaction amounts do not match, the aswap transaction will be reverted.\n\n### Timelock\n\nIn certain trading scenarios, before a transaction is settled between two parties, one’s assets may need to be locked for a period of time until the other provides proof. \n\nLet’s see how a time lock protects both buyers and sellers from fraud during online shopping. For example, Buyer A pays Seller B some money for Item c. After Seller B receives the order, it will take 3 days to send Item c to Buyer A. In this case, there may be two kinds of fraud:\n\n1. When Seller B is dishonest: After being paid, Seller B does not send Item c to Buyer A.\n2. When Buyer A is dishonest: After receiving Item c, Buyer A does not pay Seller B.\n\nA timelock can help protect them from these types of fraud cases. With a timelock, the payment from Buyer A to Seller B can be locked for up to 4 days, which requires proof in order to be unlocked. If Seller B provides a proof within a specified period, he will receive the payment; if not, the payment will be returned to Buyer A.\n\neverPay supports a variety of proof-to-unlock payment timelocks, such as the information on Ethereum, third-party arbitration, etc.\n\n# Use Cases\n\n### Real-time Payment\n\neverPay provides you with nearly the same transfer experience as traditional payment service providers.\n\nWhen making a blockchain transaction, you need to wait for the transaction to be packaged into a block, which may take several seconds to a few minutes varying with different blockchains. Such transaction experience is far from satisfying daily demands. However, everPay assigns the task of collecting transactions to a coordinator, thereby ensuring all the transfers can be verified in real time. When receiving users' transactions, the coordinators server will compute and verify them immediately, and then return the transaction state within milliseconds. \n\n![everPay's Ecology](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tzaPfxWBPvjIyqMJDfDdM.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\n### Cross-chain Token Transfer\n\nThe SCP empowers everPay with the native feature of cross-chain\\[7\\] token transfer. By integrating Ethereum and Arweave, everPay can map AR, which is Arweave’s native token, to WAR 1:1 on Ethereum. WAR(Wrapped AR)\\[8\\], which is the ERC20 format of AR, is governed by the everPay DAO with transparency and 100% verifiability. everPay offers a user-friendly cross-chain transfer experience. You can deposit AR to your everPay account via Arweave’s wallet ArConnect and withdraw its ERC20 counterpart to any Ethereum address. The whole process can be completed within an hour.\n\neverPay will expand its cross-chain functionality to more blockchains and tokens. In the future, it is expected to be a token relay and payment layer that supports multiple blockchains.\n\n### Smart Account\n\neverPay supports both blockchain accounts and internet accounts. Off-chain computation maximizes the flexibility of the everPay account system.\n\nThe threshold of the existing blockchain accounts is too high for average users. Asymmetric cryptography proves to be difficult to comprehend and the mismanagement of seed phrases leads to frequent leak of private keys. To solve these problems, everPay has built smart accounts with higher security ensured by binding accounts with hardware devices, and better usability enhanced by the biometric technology of hardware devices. Smart accounts offer the same experience as the existing internet accounts, making it easier for users to use blockchains.\n\n### Swap\n\nIn the payment opActions, bundle transactions and aswap transactions are basic tools in building a decentralized exchange\\[9\\].\n\nA bundled transaction allows swaps among multiple counterparties. If one of the swaps fails, the entire bundled transaction will be rolled back. With bundle transactions, users and market makers can swap tokens in a decentralized manner. After a bundle transaction is signed by all the transfer parties, all of the transfers included in it can be concluded only when the requirements on both sides are met.\n\nAn aswap transaction is a basic payment opAction for decentralized exchanges in orderbook mode. A user can place an order at a given price with his signature, and any third party that accepts the price can fulfill the order. Both the maker and the taker can make a swap only at a given price.\n\n### Financial Management\n\neverPay will provide users with cross-chain aggregated financial management services. Using off-chain computation to aggregate the financial management demands of users and execute them at once on Layer 1 can greatly reduce the cost of on-chain financial management. Plus with everPay’s smart accounts, the threshold of on-chain financial management is also lowered, bringing users the same experience as that of traditional financial products.\n\nWhen users sign the financial management contracts using their private keys, the corresponding assets will be locked in everPay with a timelock. Watchmen will interpret these financial management contracts and create proposals. Valid proposals signed by over 51% of watchmen will be executed on Ethereum.\n\n# Token and Governance\n\nAt an early stage, everPay uses a DAO joined by established organizations to govern consensus. With the development of use cases and technologies, everPay will gradually replace the current governance model with a token governance model while ensuring security and ease of use. \n\nFor now, everPay will not develop a detailed token offering plan and will focus on the infrastructure build as well as the ecological construction. We will actively explore the token governance model and transition to a full DAO when appropriate.\n\n# Roadmap\n\n### 2021\n\n* Support the bundle opAction\n* Support decentralized token swaps\n* PST cross-chain\n* Seek for watchmen partners\n\n### 2022\n\n* Payment opActions\n  * aswap\n  * timelock\n* Internet account system\n  * Gmail accounts can be used to register and manage everPay accounts.\n* Integrate more blockchains\n  * Ethereum’s homogeneous chains like BSC\n  * Cardano\n  * Solona\n  * Polkadot\n  * Near\n\n### 2023\n\n* Aggregated wealth management services\n  * Support aggregated wealth management on Ethereum\n  * Support aggregated wealth management on other blockchains\n* Fiat payment and OTC\n  * everPay will support fiat payment.\n  * OTC on/off-ramp\n\n## Reference\n\n\\[1\\] everPay: A Trusted Cross-chain Payment Protocol.

{"id": "XUF4XdV07q3l3hNrxj9b3PbizglWd2kO37Tt4ovaHbA", "title": "everPay Protocol Light Paper", "body": "everPay\\[1\\] is a real-time blockchain payment protocol built by everFinance. Locking up crypto assets from public chains into smart contracts can help map them into its protocol for users to make transfers and payments. everPay reduces the transaction cost to as few as 1 dollar for up to a million transactions. The storage-based Consensus paradigm frees everPay from performance limitations and makes it a rival for traditional internet applications in TPS, which depends on nothing but the application architecture and server performance.\n\neverPay is used for token payment as Stripe\\[2\\] is for fiat payments. The everPay protocol has important blockchain properties —— transparency, trustworthiness and immutability. It allows anyone to become a detector in order to monitor ledger changes within the system. Besides, an explorer is available for any user to view the everPay ledger, thus ensuring one-to-one mapping between locked-up assets and its wrapped counterparts in circulation.\n\n## Storage-based Consensus Paradigm\n\nThe storage-based Consensus paradigm\\[3\\]\\[4\\] (Abbreviated as SCP) is the next-generation paradigm for blockchain application development proposed by everFinance. In Ethereum’s model, computations are executed by all the full nodes, which then generate and store the global state for query. Different from it, the SCP manages to separate computation from storage. To be more specific, the blockchain is merely used for data storage, while the off-chain clients/servers are responsible for executing all the computations and storing all the states generated.\n\nThe SCP uses off-chain smart contracts, which can be written in any programming language, with all the inputs coming from a storage-based blockchain. In this paradigm, the blockchain is very much like a hard drive and the off-chain smart contracts can be run on any device with computing capabilities. Using a blockchain as a hard drive ensures the immutability and traceability of the stored data, which is thus guaranteed to be trusted. As a result, off-chain smart contracts can ensure the ultimate consistency of state by performing computations on trustable data.   \n\nThe applications built on top of the SCP feature both the transparency and trustworthiness of blockchains as well as the high performance and availability of traditional internet applications. The SCP has the following advantages:\n\n![Empowerment by SCP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PRRFz13TB_tuK3jCgoKDI.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\n1. Composability: Business operations between traditional financial services requires account checking, which is complex and error-prone. Using a SCP can include all the financial transaction records in the blockchain, thereby converting the traditional financial services into blockchain applications. This facilitates not only automated account checking, but also rapid coordination and efficient combination of applications.\n2. Low Development Barriers: Smart contracts are required to be written in Solidity using an EVM, while off-chain computation programs can be written in any programming language. That Makes it so developers can convert traditional applications into blockchain applications.\n3. No Performance Limitation: Off-chain computation delivers superior performances similar to traditional applications because the off-chain servers can process massive transactions. In this way, the TPS merely depends on the machine performance of servers and the technical architecture of applications.\n4. Low Consensus Cost: It’ll only cost 1 dollar to process up to a million transactions.\n\nThe SCP is designed by the inspirations of Arweave’s smart contract SmartWeave and Ethereum’s L2 scaling solution Rollup, which improves their availability.\n\n### Improvements on SmartWeave\n\n> [SmartWeave](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/SmartWeave) is a smart contracting platform built on top of the Arweave network. It allows users and developers to build programs whose execution is trustable and decentralized. One of the unique features of SmartWeave is the process of lazy evaluation, which removes the burden of processing smart contracts from the nodes and moves it to the users. This means that, instead of running every piece of code on every machine in the network, contract states are computed locally on the machines that request them.\n\nSmartWeave\\[5\\] is a decentralized contract platform that is open to all. The off-chain computation enabled by SmartWeave delivers higher scalability at the expense of introducing a new problem. The problem lies in that SmartWeave is prone to DDoS attacks, which means a large amount of invalid data is transmitted to all the computing nodes via Arweave, leading to latency in consensus and unavailability. When DDoS attackers maliciously send massive false transactions to the blockchain, node clients have to download them before verifying, therefore taking up a large part of bandwidth. In this case, valid transactions are submerged in the flood of false transactions, lowering the accuracy rate of data. To some extent, DDoS attacks may even lead to latency in client state computation.\n\nTo prevent DDoS attacks and ensure the availability of applications, everFinance has introduced a coordinator to compute and verify all the data of applications for the first time, and then includes batches of data into the chain. The coordinator acts like a rollup built on top of Ethereum by packaging transactions in batches, then including them into the chain. All the data packaged can be verified, SmartWeave’s “lazy evaluation” ensures verifiability, and Rollups guarantee the data accuracy which helps avoid DDoS attacks.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\nThe everPay protocol operates on top of a DAO with complete transparency and verifiability. The DAO applies the SCP in both data sharing and computation. The DAO members fall into three categories —— a coordinator, detectors and watchmen. The DAO has an independent component ProposalHub, which is used to collect and aggregate the proposals and signatures of the DAO members and then execute proposals.\n\n![How we work](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bKtANsUL0YvcUn8MZSujH.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\nIn the protocol, all of the DAO members integrate the same off-chain smart contract code, and conform to uniform business rules. Without independent data communication, the contract programs among different members completely rely on Arweave for data communication and downloading. The contract programs will connect Arweave for data downloading, and transactions will be processed in the same sequence as they are stored in Arweave. After obtaining transaction data, the contract programs will compute them in the off-chain smart contracts to generate the final state with consistency.\n\n### The Coordinator\n\nThe coordinator verifies transactions and then includes valid ones onto the blockchain. Each and every transaction is verified in real time, a batch of verified transactions will eventually be packaged into a batch that will then go onto the blockchain. When receiving users’ transactions, the coordinator’s server will perform computation and verification in real time, and then update its balance to the latest state. The coordinator is a highly available back-end service program that guarantees the sequence and validity of transactions. It will include a batch of transactions into the chain according to the time order every few minutes.\n\nDespite its ability to verify transactions and include them onto the chain, the coordinator is unable to attack the DAO ledger. The reason for it is that all the DAO members verify the ledger on their own. A consensus is reached on the basis of the off-chain smart contract programs and trustable data instead of being determined by the coordinator. With the SCP ensuring its objectivity, the consensus is actually not affected by any of the DAO members. In the DAO, the coordinator is just like an accountant who only maintains the ledger, but has no access to the assets. The cross-chain transfer of assets is handled by watchmen. For in-depth details, go to the “Watchmen” section.\n\nTo ensure an optimal user experience as well as real-time transactions, the coordinator has an independent node for now. It can censor transactions when putting them in order. However, the censorship timeframe can be as little as 10 minutes from transaction collection to inclusion onto the chain. It is important to note that a single-node coordinator may result in transaction censorship and ordering. To limit these risks, an everPay token will be created in order to enable mechanisms like staking and slashing. \n\n### Detectors\n\nThe off-chain everPay protocol smart contract code will be open sourced so that it can be run on anyone’s device to compute the everPay transactions.\n\nAnyone can be a detector in everPay’s protocol as long as they download the off-chain smart contract code. It will automatically load the transaction data onto Arweave, then they’ll be able to compute and verify transactions. When their programs sync to the latest Arweave block, detectors will obtain the final state of the application. Since all the detectors run the same everPay protocol code with immutable and traceable on-chain data as an input, the final state obtained by each detector is consistent.\n\n### Watchmen\n\nIn the everPay protocol, watchmen play a crucial role in multi-sig governance. They are responsible for creating and signing proposals. A proposal will be executed only when it is signed by most of (i.e. more than 51% of) the watchmen.\n\nThe ultimate everPay protocol security is ensured by the objectivity of the SCP and the Arweave network. Watchmen can manage the assets locked by users through proposals. When creating a proposal, watchmen need to handle it with the off-chain smart contract code. Moreover, proposals are created and signed in automated ways. Since the final state generated via the off-chain smart contract and on-chain trustable data is immutable, the everPay protocol will automatically detect it and create a quick response if any watchman submits any invalid proposals.\n\nWatchmen guarantee the legitimacy of multi-sig governance. In the SCP, the consensus is secured by Arweave’s perpetual storage. Even if there are only a few watchmen, a strong consensus can be built around the application. However, just as any upgrade of an Ethereum node needs to be accepted by miners, any change to the off-chain smart contract requires approval of watchmen. If a program to be upgraded is agreed upon by watchmen, the process of creating proposals needs to be adapted to it. \n\n### ProposalHub \n\nThe proposalHub is used to collect the signed proposals from watchmen in order to be executed. Despite the fact that it is not required, ProposalHub can boost the efficiency in collecting and executing the signed proposals.\n\n# Account System\n\nThe everPay account system is a highly flexible support to account systems of various blockchains. \n\nWhen a blockchain wallet that everPay supports is connected to everPay, the wallet address will be set as the ID of the corresponding everPay account by default. For example, if the Ethereum wallet 0x263…859 is connected to everPay, the ID of the corresponding everPay account will be same as the Ethereum wallet address; if the Arweave wallet 5NP...HXo is connected to everPay, the ID of the corresponding everPay account will be same as the Arweave wallet address. Furthermore, all the everPay transactions are signed using the private keys that correspond to the everPay account IDs.\n\neverPay currently supports Ethereum and Arweave. As a growing number of blockchains are supported, everPay will allow more blockchain addresses to be set as everPay account IDs in the near future.\n\n## Internet Account\n\neverPay also supports traditional internet accounts so that your email addresses or phone numbers can be set as account IDs. In addition, the WebAuthn\\[6\\] technology allows everPay to use the encryption chip embedded in devices like phones to be the private key of an everPay account. To ensure account security, your everPay account can be bound to your hardware device. When making an everPay transaction, you need to sign it by calling in the encryption chip in your hardware through biological recognition. If your device is lost or needs to be changed, your everPay account can be recovered through your email account in a secure way. Take the Gmail account recovery for example. To avoid forgery, all the emails are signed using Google’s security key, which can be verified with cryptography. With the signature verification functionality of emails, everPay’s account system can verify the signed email content for account recovery.\n\nAnother method of account recovery is contact verification. You can set multiple key contacts as guards for your account in advance. For account recovery, you can replace the public key of your everPay account by using signatures of multiple guards. The method is very similar to that of the smart contract wallet Argent.\n\n# Payment OpActions\n\nTo adapt to different payment scenarios, everPay supports a variety of opActions. Users and merchants can use different payment opActions according to their demands. As the payment businesses expand, everPay will support more payment opActions.\n\nAll the payment opActions can be integrated into applications by downloading the everpay-js SDK. It requires only a few lines of code to call the opActions in order to make transactions.\n\n### Basic OpActions\n\n**Mint**\n\nBefore making payments, you need to deposit native assets from other blockchains into everPay first. When making deposits, you only need to pay the transaction fees charged by the blockchains where the deposits come from. Different chains have different mint times, deposits from Ethereum require 6 blocks to confirm, while those from Arweave require 15 Arweave blocks. When successful, the balance on your everPay account will increase accordingly.\n\n**Burn**\n\nYou can burn the assets in your everPay account to get them back to their native blockchains. For this to occur, you have to wait for watchmen to detect your burn transaction after it is packaged with other transactions and included into Arwearve. Watchmen will verify all the burn transactions independently and then create corresponding burn proposals. As long as a burn proposal is signed by over 51% of watchmen, it will be executed on the native blockchain to unlock the original assets. After it succeeds, the balance on your everPay account will decrease accordingly. The burned assets will then return to their native blockchain.\n\n**Transfer**\n\nYou can make a transfer as long as your everPay account holds assets. However, the transfer differs from a blockchain transfer, which charges you a gas fee in order to pay miners. An everPay transfer in its essence is a meta transaction, which means you can pay the transaction fee with the assets to be transferred. It needs you to sign with your own everPay private key. All the transfers sent to the coordinator are verified instantly, and the invalid ones dismissed.\n\nTo date, everPay has supported the account models for Ethereum and Arweave. Making it that recipient address in a transfer can be either Ethereum or Arweave addresses, but the recipient is not required to register in everPay, which supports any valid Ethereum or Arweave address by default. In the future, everPay will integrate more blockchains to support their account systems. Integrating Internet accounts in the future will allow assets to be transferred between blockchain accounts and Internet accounts.\n\n### Bundle\n\neverPay allows multiple transfers to be bundled in a single transaction for execution, which is equivalent to the transactional execution of multiple transfers. When you make a bundle transaction, each of the transfers bundled in it must be executed successfully. If any of them fail, the whole bundled transaction will be reverted.\n\nIn addition to making payments to multiple recipients at once, a bundled transaction can be used in decentralized token swaps where the transfers among multiple counterparties are bundled in a single transaction. This can help ensure that the transfer bundles will be settled only after each of them are done successfully.\n\n### Aswap\n\nAswap is a transaction opAction specially designed for the orderbook mode. Different from a bundled transaction, an aswap transaction refers to an atomic swap of assets between a makers and a takers. If the makers and takers transaction amounts do not match, the aswap transaction will be reverted.\n\n### Timelock\n\nIn certain trading scenarios, before a transaction is settled between two parties, one’s assets may need to be locked for a period of time until the other provides proof. \n\nLet’s see how a time lock protects both buyers and sellers from fraud during online shopping. For example, Buyer A pays Seller B some money for Item c. After Seller B receives the order, it will take 3 days to send Item c to Buyer A. In this case, there may be two kinds of fraud:\n\n1.

With a timelock, the payment from Buyer A to Seller B can be locked for up to 4 days, which requires proof in order to be unlocked. If Seller B provides a proof within a specified period, he will receive the payment; if not, the payment will be returned to Buyer A.\n\neverPay supports a variety of proof-to-unlock payment timelocks, such as the information on Ethereum, third-party arbitration, etc.\n\n# Use Cases\n\n### Real-time Payment\n\neverPay provides you with nearly the same transfer experience as traditional payment service providers.\n\nWhen making a blockchain transaction, you need to wait for the transaction to be packaged into a block, which may take several seconds to a few minutes varying with different blockchains.

Locking up crypto assets from public chains into smart contracts can help map them into its protocol for users to make transfers and payments. everPay reduces the transaction cost to as few as 1 dollar for up to a million transactions. The storage-based Consensus paradigm frees everPay from performance limitations and makes it a rival for traditional internet applications in TPS, which depends on nothing but the application architecture and server performance.\n\neverPay is used for token payment as Stripe\\[2\\] is for fiat payments. The everPay protocol has important blockchain properties —— transparency, trustworthiness and immutability. It allows anyone to become a detector in order to monitor ledger changes within the system. Besides, an explorer is available for any user to view the everPay ledger, thus ensuring one-to-one mapping between locked-up assets and its wrapped counterparts in circulation.\n\n## Storage-based Consensus Paradigm\n\nThe storage-based Consensus paradigm\\[3\\]\\[4\\] (Abbreviated as SCP) is the next-generation paradigm for blockchain application development proposed by everFinance. In Ethereum’s model, computations are executed by all the full nodes, which then generate and store the global state for query. Different from it, the SCP manages to separate computation from storage. To be more specific, the blockchain is merely used for data storage, while the off-chain clients/servers are responsible for executing all the computations and storing all the states generated.\n\nThe SCP uses off-chain smart contracts, which can be written in any programming language, with all the inputs coming from a storage-based blockchain. In this paradigm, the blockchain is very much like a hard drive and the off-chain smart contracts can be run on any device with computing capabilities. Using a blockchain as a hard drive ensures the immutability and traceability of the stored data, which is thus guaranteed to be trusted. As a result, off-chain smart contracts can ensure the ultimate consistency of state by performing computations on trustable data.\n\nThe applications built on top of the SCP feature both the transparency and trustworthiness of blockchains as well as the high performance and availability of traditional internet applications. The SCP has the following advantages:\n\n![Empowerment by SCP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PRRFz13TB_tuK3jCgoKDI.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\n1. Composability: Business operations between traditional financial services requires account checking, which is complex and error-prone. Using a SCP can include all the financial transaction records in the blockchain, thereby converting the traditional financial services into blockchain applications. This facilitates not only automated account checking, but also rapid coordination and efficient combination of applications.\n2. Low Development Barriers: Smart contracts are required to be written in Solidity using an EVM, while off-chain computation programs can be written in any programming language. That Makes it so developers can convert traditional applications into blockchain applications.\n3. No Performance Limitation: Off-chain computation delivers superior performances similar to traditional applications because the off-chain servers can process massive transactions. In this way, the TPS merely depends on the machine performance of servers and the technical architecture of applications.\n4. Low Consensus Cost: It’ll only cost 1 dollar to process up to a million transactions.\n\nThe SCP is designed by the inspirations of Arweave’s smart contract SmartWeave and Ethereum’s L2 scaling solution Rollup, which improves their availability.\n\n### Improvements on SmartWeave\n\n> [SmartWeave](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/SmartWeave) is a smart contracting platform built on top of the Arweave network. It allows users and developers to build programs whose execution is trustable and decentralized. One of the unique features of SmartWeave is the process of lazy evaluation, which removes the burden of processing smart contracts from the nodes and moves it to the users. This means that, instead of running every piece of code on every machine in the network, contract states are computed locally on the machines that request them.\n\nSmartWeave\\[5\\] is a decentralized contract platform that is open to all. The off-chain computation enabled by SmartWeave delivers higher scalability at the expense of introducing a new problem. The problem lies in that SmartWeave is prone to DDoS attacks, which means a large amount of invalid data is transmitted to all the computing nodes via Arweave, leading to latency in consensus and unavailability. When DDoS attackers maliciously send massive false transactions to the blockchain, node clients have to download them before verifying, therefore taking up a large part of bandwidth. In this case, valid transactions are submerged in the flood of false transactions, lowering the accuracy rate of data. To some extent, DDoS attacks may even lead to latency in client state computation.\n\nTo prevent DDoS attacks and ensure the availability of applications, everFinance has introduced a coordinator to compute and verify all the data of applications for the first time, and then includes batches of data into the chain. The coordinator acts like a rollup built on top of Ethereum by packaging transactions in batches, then including them into the chain. All the data packaged can be verified, SmartWeave’s “lazy evaluation” ensures verifiability, and Rollups guarantee the data accuracy which helps avoid DDoS attacks.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\nThe everPay protocol operates on top of a DAO with complete transparency and verifiability. The DAO applies the SCP in both data sharing and computation. The DAO members fall into three categories —— a coordinator, detectors and watchmen. The DAO has an independent component ProposalHub, which is used to collect and aggregate the proposals and signatures of the DAO members and then execute proposals.\n\n![How we work](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bKtANsUL0YvcUn8MZSujH.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\nIn the protocol, all of the DAO members integrate the same off-chain smart contract code, and conform to uniform business rules. Without independent data communication, the contract programs among different members completely rely on Arweave for data communication and downloading. The contract programs will connect Arweave for data downloading, and transactions will be processed in the same sequence as they are stored in Arweave. After obtaining transaction data, the contract programs will compute them in the off-chain smart contracts to generate the final state with consistency.\n\n### The Coordinator\n\nThe coordinator verifies transactions and then includes valid ones onto the blockchain. Each and every transaction is verified in real time, a batch of verified transactions will eventually be packaged into a batch that will then go onto the blockchain. When receiving users’ transactions, the coordinator’s server will perform computation and verification in real time, and then update its balance to the latest state. The coordinator is a highly available back-end service program that guarantees the sequence and validity of transactions. It will include a batch of transactions into the chain according to the time order every few minutes.\n\nDespite its ability to verify transactions and include them onto the chain, the coordinator is unable to attack the DAO ledger. The reason for it is that all the DAO members verify the ledger on their own. A consensus is reached on the basis of the off-chain smart contract programs and trustable data instead of being determined by the coordinator. With the SCP ensuring its objectivity, the consensus is actually not affected by any of the DAO members. In the DAO, the coordinator is just like an accountant who only maintains the ledger, but has no access to the assets. The cross-chain transfer of assets is handled by watchmen. For in-depth details, go to the “Watchmen” section.\n\nTo ensure an optimal user experience as well as real-time transactions, the coordinator has an independent node for now. It can censor transactions when putting them in order. However, the censorship timeframe can be as little as 10 minutes from transaction collection to inclusion onto the chain. It is important to note that a single-node coordinator may result in transaction censorship and ordering. To limit these risks, an everPay token will be created in order to enable mechanisms like staking and slashing.\n\n### Detectors\n\nThe off-chain everPay protocol smart contract code will be open sourced so that it can be run on anyone’s device to compute the everPay transactions.\n\nAnyone can be a detector in everPay’s protocol as long as they download the off-chain smart contract code. It will automatically load the transaction data onto Arweave, then they’ll be able to compute and verify transactions. When their programs sync to the latest Arweave block, detectors will obtain the final state of the application. Since all the detectors run the same everPay protocol code with immutable and traceable on-chain data as an input, the final state obtained by each detector is consistent.\n\n### Watchmen\n\nIn the everPay protocol, watchmen play a crucial role in multi-sig governance. They are responsible for creating and signing proposals. A proposal will be executed only when it is signed by most of (i.e. more than 51% of) the watchmen.\n\nThe ultimate everPay protocol security is ensured by the objectivity of the SCP and the Arweave network. Watchmen can manage the assets locked by users through proposals. When creating a proposal, watchmen need to handle it with the off-chain smart contract code. Moreover, proposals are created and signed in automated ways. Since the final state generated via the off-chain smart contract and on-chain trustable data is immutable, the everPay protocol will automatically detect it and create a quick response if any watchman submits any invalid proposals.\n\nWatchmen guarantee the legitimacy of multi-sig governance. In the SCP, the consensus is secured by Arweave’s perpetual storage. Even if there are only a few watchmen, a strong consensus can be built around the application. However, just as any upgrade of an Ethereum node needs to be accepted by miners, any change to the off-chain smart contract requires approval of watchmen. If a program to be upgraded is agreed upon by watchmen, the process of creating proposals needs to be adapted to it.\n\n### ProposalHub\n\nThe proposalHub is used to collect the signed proposals from watchmen in order to be executed. Despite the fact that it is not required, ProposalHub can boost the efficiency in collecting and executing the signed proposals.\n\n# Account System\n\nThe everPay account system is a highly flexible support to account systems of various blockchains.\n\nWhen a blockchain wallet that everPay supports is connected to everPay, the wallet address will be set as the ID of the corresponding everPay account by default. For example, if the Ethereum wallet 0x263…859 is connected to everPay, the ID of the corresponding everPay account will be same as the Ethereum wallet address; if the Arweave wallet 5NP...HXo is connected to everPay, the ID of the corresponding everPay account will be same as the Arweave wallet address. Furthermore, all the everPay transactions are signed using the private keys that correspond to the everPay account IDs.\n\neverPay currently supports Ethereum and Arweave. As a growing number of blockchains are supported, everPay will allow more blockchain addresses to be set as everPay account IDs in the near future.\n\n## Internet Account\n\neverPay also supports traditional internet accounts so that your email addresses or phone numbers can be set as account IDs. In addition, the WebAuthn\\[6\\] technology allows everPay to use the encryption chip embedded in devices like phones to be the private key of an everPay account. To ensure account security, your everPay account can be bound to your hardware device. When making an everPay transaction, you need to sign it by calling in the encryption chip in your hardware through biological recognition. If your device is lost or needs to be changed, your everPay account can be recovered through your email account in a secure way. Take the Gmail account recovery for example. To avoid forgery, all the emails are signed using Google’s security key, which can be verified with cryptography. With the signature verification functionality of emails, everPay’s account system can verify the signed email content for account recovery.\n\nAnother method of account recovery is contact verification. You can set multiple key contacts as guards for your account in advance. For account recovery, you can replace the public key of your everPay account by using signatures of multiple guards. The method is very similar to that of the smart contract wallet Argent.\n\n# Payment OpActions\n\nTo adapt to different payment scenarios, everPay supports a variety of opActions. Users and merchants can use different payment opActions according to their demands. As the payment businesses expand, everPay will support more payment opActions.\n\nAll the payment opActions can be integrated into applications by downloading the everpay-js SDK. It requires only a few lines of code to call the opActions in order to make transactions.\n\n### Basic OpActions\n\n**Mint**\n\nBefore making payments, you need to deposit native assets from other blockchains into everPay first. When making deposits, you only need to pay the transaction fees charged by the blockchains where the deposits come from. Different chains have different mint times, deposits from Ethereum require 6 blocks to confirm, while those from Arweave require 15 Arweave blocks. When successful, the balance on your everPay account will increase accordingly.\n\n**Burn**\n\nYou can burn the assets in your everPay account to get them back to their native blockchains. For this to occur, you have to wait for watchmen to detect your burn transaction after it is packaged with other transactions and included into Arwearve. Watchmen will verify all the burn transactions independently and then create corresponding burn proposals. As long as a burn proposal is signed by over 51% of watchmen, it will be executed on the native blockchain to unlock the original assets. After it succeeds, the balance on your everPay account will decrease accordingly. The burned assets will then return to their native blockchain.\n\n**Transfer**\n\nYou can make a transfer as long as your everPay account holds assets. However, the transfer differs from a blockchain transfer, which charges you a gas fee in order to pay miners. An everPay transfer in its essence is a meta transaction, which means you can pay the transaction fee with the assets to be transferred. It needs you to sign with your own everPay private key. All the transfers sent to the coordinator are verified instantly, and the invalid ones dismissed.\n\nTo date, everPay has supported the account models for Ethereum and Arweave. Making it that recipient address in a transfer can be either Ethereum or Arweave addresses, but the recipient is not required to register in everPay, which supports any valid Ethereum or Arweave address by default. In the future, everPay will integrate more blockchains to support their account systems. Integrating Internet accounts in the future will allow assets to be transferred between blockchain accounts and Internet accounts.\n\n### Bundle\n\neverPay allows multiple transfers to be bundled in a single transaction for execution, which is equivalent to the transactional execution of multiple transfers. When you make a bundle transaction, each of the transfers bundled in it must be executed successfully. If any of them fail, the whole bundled transaction will be reverted.\n\nIn addition to making payments to multiple recipients at once, a bundled transaction can be used in decentralized token swaps where the transfers among multiple counterparties are bundled in a single transaction. This can help ensure that the transfer bundles will be settled only after each of them are done successfully.\n\n### Aswap\n\nAswap is a transaction opAction specially designed for the orderbook mode. Different from a bundled transaction, an aswap transaction refers to an atomic swap of assets between a makers and a takers. If the makers and takers transaction amounts do not match, the aswap transaction will be reverted.\n\n### Timelock\n\nIn certain trading scenarios, before a transaction is settled between two parties, one’s assets may need to be locked for a period of time until the other provides proof.\n\nLet’s see how a time lock protects both buyers and sellers from fraud during online shopping. For example, Buyer A pays Seller B some money for Item c. After Seller B receives the order, it will take 3 days to send Item c to Buyer A. In this case, there may be two kinds of fraud:\n\n1. When Seller B is dishonest: After being paid, Seller B does not send Item c to Buyer A.\n2. When Buyer A is dishonest: After receiving Item c, Buyer A does not pay Seller B.\n\nA timelock can help protect them from these types of fraud cases. With a timelock, the payment from Buyer A to Seller B can be locked for up to 4 days, which requires proof in order to be unlocked. If Seller B provides a proof within a specified period, he will receive the payment; if not, the payment will be returned to Buyer A.\n\neverPay supports a variety of proof-to-unlock payment timelocks, such as the information on Ethereum, third-party arbitration, etc.\n\n# Use Cases\n\n### Real-time Payment\n\neverPay provides you with nearly the same transfer experience as traditional payment service providers.\n\nWhen making a blockchain transaction, you need to wait for the transaction to be packaged into a block, which may take several seconds to a few minutes varying with different blockchains. Such transaction experience is far from satisfying daily demands. However, everPay assigns the task of collecting transactions to a coordinator, thereby ensuring all the transfers can be verified in real time. When receiving users' transactions, the coordinators server will compute and verify them immediately, and then return the transaction state within milliseconds.\n\n![everPay's Ecology](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tzaPfxWBPvjIyqMJDfDdM.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\n### Cross-chain Token Transfer\n\nThe SCP empowers everPay with the native feature of cross-chain\\[7\\] token transfer. By integrating Ethereum and Arweave, everPay can map AR, which is Arweave’s native token, to WAR 1:1 on Ethereum. WAR(Wrapped AR)\\[8\\], which is the ERC20 format of AR, is governed by the everPay DAO with transparency and 100% verifiability. everPay offers a user-friendly cross-chain transfer experience. You can deposit AR to your everPay account via Arweave’s wallet ArConnect and withdraw its ERC20 counterpart to any Ethereum address. The whole process can be completed within an hour.\n\neverPay will expand its cross-chain functionality to more blockchains and tokens. In the future, it is expected to be a token relay and payment layer that supports multiple blockchains.\n\n### Smart Account\n\neverPay supports both blockchain accounts and internet accounts. Off-chain computation maximizes the flexibility of the everPay account system.\n\nThe threshold of the existing blockchain accounts is too high for average users. Asymmetric cryptography proves to be difficult to comprehend and the mismanagement of seed phrases leads to frequent leak of private keys. To solve these problems, everPay has built smart accounts with higher security ensured by binding accounts with hardware devices, and better usability enhanced by the biometric technology of hardware devices. Smart accounts offer the same experience as the existing internet accounts, making it easier for users to use blockchains.\n\n### Swap\n\nIn the payment opActions, bundle transactions and aswap transactions are basic tools in building a decentralized exchange\\[9\\].\n\nA bundled transaction allows swaps among multiple counterparties. If one of the swaps fails, the entire bundled transaction will be rolled back. With bundle transactions, users and market makers can swap tokens in a decentralized manner. After a bundle transaction is signed by all the transfer parties, all of the transfers included in it can be concluded only when the requirements on both sides are met.\n\nAn aswap transaction is a basic payment opAction for decentralized exchanges in orderbook mode. A user can place an order at a given price with his signature, and any third party that accepts the price can fulfill the order. Both the maker and the taker can make a swap only at a given price.\n\n### Financial Management\n\neverPay will provide users with cross-chain aggregated financial management services. Using off-chain computation to aggregate the financial management demands of users and execute them at once on Layer 1 can greatly reduce the cost of on-chain financial management. Plus with everPay’s smart accounts, the threshold of on-chain financial management is also lowered, bringing users the same experience as that of traditional financial products.\n\nWhen users sign the financial management contracts using their private keys, the corresponding assets will be locked in everPay with a timelock. Watchmen will interpret these financial management contracts and create proposals. Valid proposals signed by over 51% of watchmen will be executed on Ethereum.\n\n# Token and Governance\n\nAt an early stage, everPay uses a DAO joined by established organizations to govern consensus. With the development of use cases and technologies, everPay will gradually replace the current governance model with a token governance model while ensuring security and ease of use.\n\nFor now, everPay will not develop a detailed token offering plan and will focus on the infrastructure build as well as the ecological construction. We will actively explore the token governance model and transition to a full DAO when appropriate.\n\n# Roadmap\n\n### 2021\n\n* Support the bundle opAction\n* Support decentralized token swaps\n* PST cross-chain\n* Seek for watchmen partners\n\n### 2022\n\n* Payment opActions\n  * aswap\n  * timelock\n* Internet account system\n  * Gmail accounts can be used to register and manage everPay accounts.\n* Integrate more blockchains\n  * Ethereum’s homogeneous chains like BSC\n  * Cardano\n  * Solona\n  * Polkadot\n  * Near\n\n### 2023\n\n* Aggregated wealth management services\n  * Support aggregated wealth management on Ethereum\n  * Support aggregated wealth management on other blockchains\n* Fiat payment and OTC\n  * everPay will support fiat payment.\n  * OTC on/off-ramp\n\n## Reference\n\n\\[1\\] everPay: A Trusted Cross-chain Payment Protocol.

This influx has brought us exciting projects, some of which distinguish themselves by amazing 3D, animated, AI generated human-robotoid digital paintings showcasing an exciting intersection of art and technology. Other projects have focussed on combining NFTs with some sort of intricate game mechanic and/or utility. With projects like VeeFriends, the brainchild of Gary Vaynerchuk, it is becoming more and more apparent that aspects of utility are an integral part to the NFT space. In no offense to Gary, I will state that the art featured in VeeFriends couldn’t hold up on its own without the concept of exclusivity and context of club memberships that is inherent to the project, or rather the NFTs itself. This (potential) utility ingrained into NFTs is the main reason why NFT maximalists have already pronounced traditional art as dead, signaling that NFTs have won a battle between opponents meeting at eye level. But they are missing a key point: NFTs are not in competition with traditional art as they exist in a space where traditional art has no access to begin with. As a baseline, NFTs can serve as cultural artefacts just as much as their analogue counterparts while providing a much higher stability of existence. NFTs can’t be wiped out by the elements or by wars waged by mankind. Their existence will surpass even when humans cease to exist. Their cultural value is significant now and will be enormous in a couple of centuries. And the best part: Ownership can be proven and access to perks can be granted immediately.\n\n**The maximalists are correct in their belief in NFTs, but ironically, they are still underestimating the potential.**\n\n## **Addressing NFTs teething problems, Fair Price & True Value**\n\nLet’s halt the song of praise for a moment and address some of the key problems that plague the NFT space in its current form and are less to do with the technology itself but with the prevailing market dynamics: The NFT space has seen an influx of thousands of projects, overpromising and under-delivering. Telling apart legitimate projects from straight-up scams can be difficult at times and just as in any market where money is to be made, malevolent actors are engaging in fraudulent activity — promising the world and disappearing with funds once minting has concluded. Essentially “pulling the rug” on the project. Another economic challenge is determining fair prices for initial minting. Most projects just follow the hivemind and set mint prices to what they believe to be most accepted by the market — a huge red flag that I advise everyone in the NFT space to look out for. After all, prices should be determined by the true value of the product that you’re selling or at least account for and be set in the context of your operating costs. Setting the price arbitrarily to what the market has already deemed acceptable is entirely disconnected from what your product is supposed to be worth (or you believe it to be worth). Have you ever wondered why mint prices are set in ETH but don’t change even if Ethereum prices fluctuate heavily? The answer is simple: The project leaders have either no understanding of the true value of their product or they’re heavily overpricing because the market will pay regardless if the marketing is good and the hype is big enough.\n\n## **Determining True Value**\n\nHere’s the bad news: Telling an NFTs true value before a project has gone live (read: before minting) is incredibly hard. You, the person minting, carry most of the associated risk because of the information asymmetry between you and the project’s leaders — something that is well known and researched in the field of economics as the principal-agent problem. While the issuer of an NFT usually perfectly understands what costs are associated with the project, how many real followers he or she has gathered throughout his channels, and most importantly, what his/her plans are once the revenue has been generated through the mint, you rely on simple heuristics, word of mouth and the spoken words of influencers to approximate the true value. A perfect breeding ground for scams.\n\n## **Understanding Your Role and the (Fair) Distribution of Risk**\n\nIf the foundation of the problem is information asymmetry, the basic principle of solving this problem would be the reduction of said asymmetry. This can be done in various ways, e.g. presenting the project team, laying out a roadmap and outlining the costs associated with launching the project, however this could still be empty signals. After all, even if you provide a roadmap and put your name and face on a website. What keeps you from not delivering on the promises made? There is no legal contract binding you to any of the roadmap items that were promised to your community. As such, you have no obligation and in some cases no stake in carrying on with the project once the mint is done and revenue is generated. Sure, secondary sales are a thing, but now the project leaders are the ones assuming the risk as they are now the ones who have to put in the work without any guarantee of the project to take off afterwards. This sudden shift of risk has already brought countless projects to a halt. Not necessarily because the malevolence was planned, but because the founders suddenly found themselves assuming all the risk and moving on became the better economic decision.\n\nThis makes one very important aspect obvious: As it turns out, *you were an investor and not a customer in the first place*. In no other market is it currently possible to receive funding for a future project under these lax circumstances. If you’re seeking an investment for your business, you have to convince investors with a full-fledged business plan providing cost and revenue projections spanning a couple of years as well as provide proof that you’re actually capable of running a business. In most cases, you already have some sort of revenue from your existing business and are planning on expanding through additional funding. The NFT space has made everyone an investor in a mass market, but with one very important caveat: They don’t perceive themselves as investors and as such, they don’t demand documentation and can’t demand accountability. Again, a perfect breeding ground for scams.\n\nAt this point, you may be asking yourself: Is there actually any way to fairly distribute the risk AND reduce the information asymmetry between the two parties and the short answer is: *no, there isn’t*. But having a look at where each party’s risks are coming from will lead us much closer to an answer than we currently have when observing market dynamics. While the project team has to invest in development, artist(s), marketing campaigns, social media management as well as provide their own labor, the entire risk for the minter is expressed solely through the mint price. As such, a mint price of 0 shifts the risk *entirely* to the project team. Not generating revenue through a mint process, means that costs have to be recuperated through the actual execution of the project. But why would anyone want to assume that amount of risk?\n\n## **Solving The Problems**\n\nIn my article I have outlined several issues with the NFT space, but failed to provide a clear solution. The fact of the matter is that a clear solution does not exist per se, but you as an investor or mere participant in the NFT community should understand the prevailing dynamics and identify projects that offer the right distribution of risks, information and equity.\n\nHowever, instead of a perfect solution, I’m presenting you (and offering you to participate) in the project that I have envisioned with my team and that seeks to solve the problems outlined in this article to the best extent possible. We believe to have found a setup that works for everyone and evenly distributes the risk, but attributes it at different time points. Let me present to you **The Ghostwriters Guild**.\n\n## **The Ghostwriters Guild NFT**\n\nAt its very core, the Ghostwriters Guild is a NFT-based, decentralised organisation of authors from around the world, collectively writing, editing and publishing novels under shared copyright.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*A3FOaSpdPNlTdVwjAsy7cw.png)\n\nEveryone of you will have played the game where you add word by word and create some funky sentences. Well, GG is like that but still a bit different and with a distinct purpose. The main idea is to write an actual novel, but instead of the free-flowing nature of the word-by-word game, we are writing sentence by sentence and ensuring quality and continuity through crowd intelligence.\n\nSo how does this work exactly?\n\nTo start off, we’re dropping a collection of 5,000 unique NFTs in **FAIR & FREE minting**, granting access to the Ghostwriters Guild. Yes, you read that right. **The price is zero (0)**. It’s noteworthy that only holders of these NFTs will be able to participate in writing & voting. The AI generated NFT badges (seen below) feature various attributes of your writing persona, such as a pen name, your favourite drink and your writing style. *Of course you can still write as you please — this just serves as an inspiration*.\n\nOf course, they are fairly generic in their visual appearance, a design choice that we made intentionally, because these NFTs serve the distinct purpose of membership. Their value is derived from the utility that is provided by the project. The basic idea behind this operating model is that an active community is essential to most NFT projects, yet the community usually rarely receives a fair share for their input. By offering free, yet limited memberships, we ensure that every bit of value that is created through the community, is reaped by it.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*_HrV8LXtE41D4BCOVpg27w.png)\n\nExample of the NFT that will be available for minting.\n\nAs a member of the GG, you will be able to contribute to our discord’s private channels where the entire creative process takes place: We start off by choosing the first sentence of the novel out of three predetermined submissions. From that point on, every Ghostwriter will be able to submit their suggestions and votes will be held on the best submissions as we continue along the story, sentence by sentence.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*443xmxLAjd_lQNqCZPkXMw.png)\n\nOnce and only IF we have fostered an active community and the process of writing has picked up, we will release a high quality PFP collection, extending membership to GG. We will issue another 5,000 PFPs for a mint price that will be set in USD values (or rather its equivalent in ETH) per NFT, where we will be seeking to recuperate the project costs. Needless to say, all GG badge holders will receive the first right to buy at the fixed price, whereas we will seek to raise the price for the public mint.\n\nUpon finishing Volume I, we release it as the first ever collectively written NFT novel, providing fractional shares to all current GG NFT holders. Additionally, we will publish Volume I as an ebook, distributing 80% revenue equally among Ghostwriters, while the remaining 20% will be used to reward those contributors with at least one accepted submission. For you math wizards out there: This equals 100% of the entire novel’s revenue.\n\nWe won’t address future plans too much, because much of those will depend on how the community develops and in which direction the project will see its natural progression. One thought experiment was to create derivative NFTs from the content of the first novel and release it to the general public and to distribute the entire revenue to all Ghostwriters. Other projects have demonstrated that getting into details too much can hinder organic development. Our understanding of the Ghostwriters Guild is a community of equals and as such, we want the project’s future plans to be based on what the community comes up with.\n\nWe’re completely flipping the script on how NFT projects work, because we believe this is how they *should work*. It’s actually crazy that I have to spell it out, but we firmly believe that NFT projects should offer utility \\*before \\*they generate revenue and not the other way around. By setting the mint price to 0, we as a team assume the entire risk of the project which means that we, just like every other community member, have an equal stake in its development. This configuration has some impact on our project’s roadmap or rather its lack thereof. While we have a vague plan of how we would like to proceed in the very near future (read: 1–2 months), we haven’t made any plans further than that. Not being able to make any promises is the luxury of assuming the risk.\n\nYou can join the [Ghostwriters Guild’s Discord](https://discord.gg/5vAF84kbxp) and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GhostwritersNFT).", "timestamp": 1635405043, "digest": "uKq19v3FRbUZz1xRjYlFgVqWGYjjp4K213rUIXZmLqg", "contributor": "0x473803aBB217127321fcF961830E6E31192e7083"}
{"id": "3RNRHBqo1RevUfSXmkGLrcbffEV0W7Av4Jz8a9K5r_4", "title": "everPay Protocol Light Paper", "body": "everPay\\[1\\] is a real-time blockchain payment protocol built by everFinance. Locking up crypto assets from public chains into smart contracts can help map them into its protocol for users to make transfers and payments. everPay reduces the transaction cost to as few as 1 dollar for up to a million transactions. The storage-based Consensus paradigm frees everPay from performance limitations and makes it a rival for traditional internet applications in TPS, which depends on nothing but the application architecture and server performance.\n\neverPay is used for token payment as Stripe\\[2\\] is for fiat payments. The everPay protocol has important blockchain properties —— transparency, trustworthiness and immutability. It allows anyone to become a detector in order to monitor ledger changes within the system. Besides, an explorer is available for any user to view the everPay ledger, thus ensuring one-to-one mapping between locked-up assets and its wrapped counterparts in circulation.\n\n## Storage-based Consensus Paradigm\n\nThe storage-based Consensus paradigm\\[3\\]\\[4\\] (Abbreviated as SCP) is the next-generation paradigm for blockchain application development proposed by everFinance. In Ethereum’s model, computations are executed by all the full nodes, which then generate and store the global state for query. Different from it, the SCP manages to separate computation from storage. To be more specific, the blockchain is merely used for data storage, while the off-chain clients/servers are responsible for executing all the computations and storing all the states generated.\n\nThe SCP uses off-chain smart contracts, which can be written in any programming language, with all the inputs coming from a storage-based blockchain. In this paradigm, the blockchain is very much like a hard drive and the off-chain smart contracts can be run on any device with computing capabilities. Using a blockchain as a hard drive ensures the immutability and traceability of the stored data, which is thus guaranteed to be trusted. As a result, off-chain smart contracts can ensure the ultimate consistency of state by performing computations on trustable data.\n\nThe applications built on top of the SCP feature both the transparency and trustworthiness of blockchains as well as the high performance and availability of traditional internet applications. The SCP has the following advantages:\n\n![Empowerment by SCP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PRRFz13TB_tuK3jCgoKDI.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\n1. Composability: Business operations between traditional financial services requires account checking, which is complex and error-prone. Using a SCP can include all the financial transaction records in the blockchain, thereby converting the traditional financial services into blockchain applications. This facilitates not only automated account checking, but also rapid coordination and efficient combination of applications.\n2. Low Development Barriers: Smart contracts are required to be written in Solidity using an EVM, while off-chain computation programs can be written in any programming language. That Makes it so developers can convert traditional applications into blockchain applications.\n3. No Performance Limitation: Off-chain computation delivers superior performances similar to traditional applications because the off-chain servers can process massive transactions. In this way, the TPS merely depends on the machine performance of servers and the technical architecture of applications.\n4. Low Consensus Cost: It’ll only cost 1 dollar to process up to a million transactions.\n\nThe SCP is designed by the inspirations of Arweave’s smart contract SmartWeave and Ethereum’s L2 scaling solution Rollup, which improves their availability.\n\n### Improvements on SmartWeave\n\n> [SmartWeave](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/SmartWeave) is a smart contracting platform built on top of the Arweave network. It allows users and developers to build programs whose execution is trustable and decentralized. One of the unique features of SmartWeave is the process of lazy evaluation, which removes the burden of processing smart contracts from the nodes and moves it to the users. This means that, instead of running every piece of code on every machine in the network, contract states are computed locally on the machines that request them.\n\nSmartWeave\\[5\\] is a decentralized contract platform that is open to all. The off-chain computation enabled by SmartWeave delivers higher scalability at the expense of introducing a new problem. The problem lies in that SmartWeave is prone to DDoS attacks, which means a large amount of invalid data is transmitted to all the computing nodes via Arweave, leading to latency in consensus and unavailability. When DDoS attackers maliciously send massive false transactions to the blockchain, node clients have to download them before verifying, therefore taking up a large part of bandwidth. In this case, valid transactions are submerged in the flood of false transactions, lowering the accuracy rate of data. To some extent, DDoS attacks may even lead to latency in client state computation.\n\nTo prevent DDoS attacks and ensure the availability of applications, everFinance has introduced a coordinator to compute and verify all the data of applications for the first time, and then includes batches of data into the chain. The coordinator acts like a rollup built on top of Ethereum by packaging transactions in batches, then including them into the chain. All the data packaged can be verified, SmartWeave’s “lazy evaluation” ensures verifiability, and Rollups guarantee the data accuracy which helps avoid DDoS attacks.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\nThe everPay protocol operates on top of a DAO with complete transparency and verifiability. The DAO applies the SCP in both data sharing and computation. The DAO members fall into three categories —— a coordinator, detectors and watchmen. The DAO has an independent component ProposalHub, which is used to collect and aggregate the proposals and signatures of the DAO members and then execute proposals.\n\n![How we work](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bKtANsUL0YvcUn8MZSujH.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\nIn the protocol, all of the DAO members integrate the same off-chain smart contract code, and conform to uniform business rules. Without independent data communication, the contract programs among different members completely rely on Arweave for data communication and downloading. The contract programs will connect Arweave for data downloading, and transactions will be processed in the same sequence as they are stored in Arweave. After obtaining transaction data, the contract programs will compute them in the off-chain smart contracts to generate the final state with consistency.\n\n### The Coordinator\n\nThe coordinator verifies transactions and then includes valid ones onto the blockchain. Each and every transaction is verified in real time, a batch of verified transactions will eventually be packaged into a batch that will then go onto the blockchain. When receiving users’ transactions, the coordinator’s server will perform computation and verification in real time, and then update its balance to the latest state. The coordinator is a highly available back-end service program that guarantees the sequence and validity of transactions. It will include a batch of transactions into the chain according to the time order every few minutes.\n\nDespite its ability to verify transactions and include them onto the chain, the coordinator is unable to attack the DAO ledger. The reason for it is that all the DAO members verify the ledger on their own. A consensus is reached on the basis of the off-chain smart contract programs and trustable data instead of being determined by the coordinator. With the SCP ensuring its objectivity, the consensus is actually not affected by any of the DAO members. In the DAO, the coordinator is just like an accountant who only maintains the ledger, but has no access to the assets. The cross-chain transfer of assets is handled by watchmen. For in-depth details, go to the “Watchmen” section.\n\nTo ensure an optimal user experience as well as real-time transactions, the coordinator has an independent node for now. It can censor transactions when putting them in order. However, the censorship timeframe can be as little as 10 minutes from transaction collection to inclusion onto the chain. It is important to note that a single-node coordinator may result in transaction censorship and ordering. To limit these risks, an everPay token will be created in order to enable mechanisms like staking and slashing.\n\n### Detectors\n\nThe off-chain everPay protocol smart contract code will be open sourced so that it can be run on anyone’s device to compute the everPay transactions.\n\nAnyone can be a detector in everPay’s protocol as long as they download the off-chain smart contract code. It will automatically load the transaction data onto Arweave, then they’ll be able to compute and verify transactions. When their programs sync to the latest Arweave block, detectors will obtain the final state of the application. Since all the detectors run the same everPay protocol code with immutable and traceable on-chain data as an input, the final state obtained by each detector is consistent.\n\n### Watchmen\n\nIn the everPay protocol, watchmen play a crucial role in multi-sig governance. They are responsible for creating and signing proposals. A proposal will be executed only when it is signed by most of (i.e. more than 51% of) the watchmen.\n\nThe ultimate everPay protocol security is ensured by the objectivity of the SCP and the Arweave network. Watchmen can manage the assets locked by users through proposals. When creating a proposal, watchmen need to handle it with the off-chain smart contract code. Moreover, proposals are created and signed in automated ways. Since the final state generated via the off-chain smart contract and on-chain trustable data is immutable, the everPay protocol will automatically detect it and create a quick response if any watchman submits any invalid proposals.\n\nWatchmen guarantee the legitimacy of multi-sig governance. In the SCP, the consensus is secured by Arweave’s perpetual storage. Even if there are only a few watchmen, a strong consensus can be built around the application. However, just as any upgrade of an Ethereum node needs to be accepted by miners, any change to the off-chain smart contract requires approval of watchmen. If a program to be upgraded is agreed upon by watchmen, the process of creating proposals needs to be adapted to it.\n\n### ProposalHub\n\nThe proposalHub is used to collect the signed proposals from watchmen in order to be executed. Despite the fact that it is not required, ProposalHub can boost the efficiency in collecting and executing the signed proposals.\n\n# Account System\n\nThe everPay account system is a highly flexible support to account systems of various blockchains.\n\nWhen a blockchain wallet that everPay supports is connected to everPay, the wallet address will be set as the ID of the corresponding everPay account by default. For example, if the Ethereum wallet 0x263…859 is connected to everPay, the ID of the corresponding everPay account will be same as the Ethereum wallet address; if the Arweave wallet 5NP...HXo is connected to everPay, the ID of the corresponding everPay account will be same as the Arweave wallet address. Furthermore, all the everPay transactions are signed using the private keys that correspond to the everPay account IDs.\n\neverPay currently supports Ethereum and Arweave. As a growing number of blockchains are supported, everPay will allow more blockchain addresses to be set as everPay account IDs in the near future.\n\n## Internet Account\n\neverPay also supports traditional internet accounts so that your email addresses or phone numbers can be set as account IDs. In addition, the WebAuthn\\[6\\] technology allows everPay to use the encryption chip embedded in devices like phones to be the private key of an everPay account. To ensure account security, your everPay account can be bound to your hardware device. When making an everPay transaction, you need to sign it by calling in the encryption chip in your hardware through biological recognition. If your device is lost or needs to be changed, your everPay account can be recovered through your email account in a secure way. Take the Gmail account recovery for example. To avoid forgery, all the emails are signed using Google’s security key, which can be verified with cryptography. With the signature verification functionality of emails, everPay’s account system can verify the signed email content for account recovery.\n\nAnother method of account recovery is contact verification. You can set multiple key contacts as guards for your account in advance. For account recovery, you can replace the public key of your everPay account by using signatures of multiple guards. The method is very similar to that of the smart contract wallet Argent.\n\n# Payment OpActions\n\nTo adapt to different payment scenarios, everPay supports a variety of opActions. Users and merchants can use different payment opActions according to their demands. As the payment businesses expand, everPay will support more payment opActions.\n\nAll the payment opActions can be integrated into applications by downloading the everpay-js SDK. It requires only a few lines of code to call the opActions in order to make transactions.\n\n### Basic OpActions\n\n**Mint**\n\nBefore making payments, you need to deposit native assets from other blockchains into everPay first. When making deposits, you only need to pay the transaction fees charged by the blockchains where the deposits come from. Different chains have different mint times, deposits from Ethereum require 6 blocks to confirm, while those from Arweave require 15 Arweave blocks. When successful, the balance on your everPay account will increase accordingly.\n\n**Burn**\n\nYou can burn the assets in your everPay account to get them back to their native blockchains. For this to occur, you have to wait for watchmen to detect your burn transaction after it is packaged with other transactions and included into Arwearve. Watchmen will verify all the burn transactions independently and then create corresponding burn proposals. As long as a burn proposal is signed by over 51% of watchmen, it will be executed on the native blockchain to unlock the original assets. After it succeeds, the balance on your everPay account will decrease accordingly. The burned assets will then return to their native blockchain.\n\n**Transfer**\n\nYou can make a transfer as long as your everPay account holds assets. However, the transfer differs from a blockchain transfer, which charges you a gas fee in order to pay miners. An everPay transfer in its essence is a meta transaction, which means you can pay the transaction fee with the assets to be transferred. It needs you to sign with your own everPay private key. All the transfers sent to the coordinator are verified instantly, and the invalid ones dismissed.\n\nTo date, everPay has supported the account models for Ethereum and Arweave. Making it that recipient address in a transfer can be either Ethereum or Arweave addresses, but the recipient is not required to register in everPay, which supports any valid Ethereum or Arweave address by default. In the future, everPay will integrate more blockchains to support their account systems. Integrating Internet accounts in the future will allow assets to be transferred between blockchain accounts and Internet accounts.\n\n### Bundle\n\neverPay allows multiple transfers to be bundled in a single transaction for execution, which is equivalent to the transactional execution of multiple transfers. When you make a bundle transaction, each of the transfers bundled in it must be executed successfully. If any of them fail, the whole bundled transaction will be reverted.\n\nIn addition to making payments to multiple recipients at once, a bundled transaction can be used in decentralized token swaps where the transfers among multiple counterparties are bundled in a single transaction. This can help ensure that the transfer bundles will be settled only after each of them are done successfully.\n\n### Aswap\n\nAswap is a transaction opAction specially designed for the orderbook mode. Different from a bundled transaction, an aswap transaction refers to an atomic swap of assets between a makers and a takers. If the makers and takers transaction amounts do not match, the aswap transaction will be reverted.\n\n### Timelock\n\nIn certain trading scenarios, before a transaction is settled between two parties, one’s assets may need to be locked for a period of time until the other provides proof.\n\nLet’s see how a time lock protects both buyers and sellers from fraud during online shopping. For example, Buyer A pays Seller B some money for Item c. After Seller B receives the order, it will take 3 days to send Item c to Buyer A. In this case, there may be two kinds of fraud:\n\n1. When Seller B is dishonest: After being paid, Seller B does not send Item c to Buyer A.\n2. When Buyer A is dishonest: After receiving Item c, Buyer A does not pay Seller B.\n\nA timelock can help protect them from these types of fraud cases. With a timelock, the payment from Buyer A to Seller B can be locked for up to 4 days, which requires proof in order to be unlocked. If Seller B provides a proof within a specified period, he will receive the payment; if not, the payment will be returned to Buyer A.\n\neverPay supports a variety of proof-to-unlock payment timelocks, such as the information on Ethereum, third-party arbitration, etc.\n\n# Use Cases\n\n### Real-time Payment\n\neverPay provides you with nearly the same transfer experience as traditional payment service providers.\n\nWhen making a blockchain transaction, you need to wait for the transaction to be packaged into a block, which may take several seconds to a few minutes varying with different blockchains. Such transaction experience is far from satisfying daily demands. However, everPay assigns the task of collecting transactions to a coordinator, thereby ensuring all the transfers can be verified in real time. When receiving users' transactions, the coordinators server will compute and verify them immediately, and then return the transaction state within milliseconds.\n\n![everPay's Ecology](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tzaPfxWBPvjIyqMJDfDdM.png?height=900&width=1800)\n\n### Cross-chain Token Transfer\n\nThe SCP empowers everPay with the native feature of cross-chain\\[7\\] token transfer. By integrating Ethereum and Arweave, everPay can map AR, which is Arweave’s native token, to WAR 1:1 on Ethereum. WAR(Wrapped AR)\\[8\\], which is the ERC20 format of AR, is governed by the everPay DAO with transparency and 100% verifiability. everPay offers a user-friendly cross-chain transfer experience. You can deposit AR to your everPay account via Arweave’s wallet ArConnect and withdraw its ERC20 counterpart to any Ethereum address. The whole process can be completed within an hour.\n\neverPay will expand its cross-chain functionality to more blockchains and tokens. In the future, it is expected to be a token relay and payment layer that supports multiple blockchains.\n\n### Smart Account\n\neverPay supports both blockchain accounts and internet accounts. Off-chain computation maximizes the flexibility of the everPay account system.\n\nThe threshold of the existing blockchain accounts is too high for average users. Asymmetric cryptography proves to be difficult to comprehend and the mismanagement of seed phrases leads to frequent leak of private keys. To solve these problems, everPay has built smart accounts with higher security ensured by binding accounts with hardware devices, and better usability enhanced by the biometric technology of hardware devices. Smart accounts offer the same experience as the existing internet accounts, making it easier for users to use blockchains.\n\n### Swap\n\nIn the payment opActions, bundle transactions and aswap transactions are basic tools in building a decentralized exchange\\[9\\].\n\nA bundled transaction allows swaps among multiple counterparties. If one of the swaps fails, the entire bundled transaction will be rolled back. With bundle transactions, users and market makers can swap tokens in a decentralized manner. After a bundle transaction is signed by all the transfer parties, all of the transfers included in it can be concluded only when the requirements on both sides are met.\n\nAn aswap transaction is a basic payment opAction for decentralized exchanges in orderbook mode. A user can place an order at a given price with his signature, and any third party that accepts the price can fulfill the order. Both the maker and the taker can make a swap only at a given price.\n\n### Financial Management\n\neverPay will provide users with cross-chain aggregated financial management services. Using off-chain computation to aggregate the financial management demands of users and execute them at once on Layer 1 can greatly reduce the cost of on-chain financial management. Plus with everPay’s smart accounts, the threshold of on-chain financial management is also lowered, bringing users the same experience as that of traditional financial products.\n\nWhen users sign the financial management contracts using their private keys, the corresponding assets will be locked in everPay with a timelock. Watchmen will interpret these financial management contracts and create proposals. Valid proposals signed by over 51% of watchmen will be executed on Ethereum.\n\n# Token and Governance\n\nAt an early stage, everPay uses a DAO joined by established organizations to govern consensus. With the development of use cases and technologies, everPay will gradually replace the current governance model with a token governance model while ensuring security and ease of use.\n\nFor now, everPay will not develop a detailed token offering plan and will focus on the infrastructure build as well as the ecological construction. We will actively explore the token governance model and transition to a full DAO when appropriate.\n\n# Roadmap\n\n### 2021\n\n* Support the bundle opAction\n* Support decentralized token swaps\n* PST cross-chain\n* Seek for watchmen partners\n\n### 2022\n\n* Payment opActions\n  * aswap\n  * timelock\n* Internet account system\n  * Gmail accounts can be used to register and manage everPay accounts.\n* Integrate more blockchains\n  * Ethereum’s homogeneous chains like BSC\n  * Cardano\n  * Solona\n  * Polkadot\n  * Near\n\n### 2023\n\n* Aggregated wealth management services\n  * Support aggregated wealth management on Ethereum\n  * Support aggregated wealth management on other blockchains\n* Fiat payment and OTC\n  * everPay will support fiat payment.\n  * OTC on/off-ramp\n\n## Reference\n\n\\[1\\] everPay: A Trusted Cross-chain Payment Protocol.

将自己与社区联系起来 - 但 BAYC 证明代表品牌只是拼图的一部分 ， 现在，品牌可以利用社区的力量并让该社区参与交易，25/Supreme 围绕他们的社区创建了一个品牌。 数百人与他们的社区一起创造了一个故事。 现在，无聊猿游艇俱乐部允许社区创建品牌并撰写其故事。 这只是一个强大的新业务结构的开始。\n每个 NFT 项目都应该有一个 .nft 域名。在下面标记您的收藏夹，以便我们为它们提供一个\n1/一百分符号派对爆竹 12 个月，大量 alpha 和 100 集！ 上周，我们在第 100 集达到了令人难以置信的里程碑#TheUnstoppablePodcast. 对于我们过去的每一位客人，我们非常感谢您分享您的知识并帮助我们教育每个进入#web3！ 2/ 与加密内容爱好者交谈，例如@jarroddicker 像已经传奇的艺术家@pplpleasr1 和 DeFi OG 之类的@CamiRusso ，这是一个疯狂的旅程。 挥手对于我们所有的听众，我们感谢您加入我们的旅程！3/ 非常感谢@ddwchen 谁开始了这一切， 您可以在我们的 YouTube 频道上观看我们过去的所有剧集！4/ 与此同时，我们有巨大的鞋子要填补！举手 公共广播扩音器开始寻找新的播客主机和 web3 牧羊人。 眼睛对这个机会感兴趣？更多详情如下\n\\*\\*The Sandbox， @TheSandboxGame，The Sandbox is a virtual #gaming world where players can build, own, and monetize their gaming experiences.元宇宙 \\*\\*\n还有谁喜欢绿色植物？ 我们把头埋在树上探索#TheSandbox游戏制作人， 参与其中，将您的想象力变为现实！ 在这里下载食指指背往右指https://bit.ly/3nhpLMU\n你找到你的近邻了吗？#metaverse ? 获取更多$SAND一起参与这个#Giveaway！\nLady Pixy 的万圣节系列：与创作者见面\n@borgetsebastien 在虚拟生命 + 社会峰会上发言，主办方@theculturedao 和@virtualbeings1 .敬请关注本周五周六！ 更多细节食指指背往右指http://virtual-beings-summit.com\nSAND Play的截止日期@VoxEdit 大赛快到了！ 食指指背往右指提交您的运动主题#voxel 31 日的作品有机会赢得 100,000 的一部分$SAND/ 土地 /#NFT和实物奖品！\nSandbox Metaverse 是许多赢得虚拟 LANDS 的 NFT 合集的所在地国家公园为他们的社区举办各种体验。 我们想更新下面的地图，通过分享您的标签和坐标 (X,Y) 帮助我们找到您的地图\nRarity Game， @RarityGame， Welcome wanderer!

{"id": "8-TY1UDwdP37q14zGB4yyBBgaFvDQ5dn_YLUMDcgiwo", "title": "What NFTs Promise Music Creators—And What They Actually Do", "body": "*This is a three part series unpacking three fundamental promises made by web3—ownership, community, and legitimacy. You are reading Part 1.* \n\nWeb3 promises to revolutionize the music industry by enabling ownership, community and legitimacy. This essay focuses on one part of that promise: ownership. More specifically, ownership of digital assets. For us in the music biz, that means — ownership of digital music.\n\nWeb3 technology and the innovations it spurs (NFTs for instance) are often touted as the shiny new tools that will spark the revival of ownership in the music industry. A product of the post-napster generation, I was always curious about what the music industry’s *ownership era* looked like, and why industry folks look back on it with such fond nostalgia. I found my answers in Steve Knopper’s Book: Appetite for Self-Destruction (yeah yeah I know!) which provides an in-depth account of the music industry’s heyday excesses. \n\nHere’s the TL;DR: In the music industry’s *ownership era* — fans bought vinyls, CDs, cassettes and mp3s, labels largely controlled the capital-intensive means of production, which made executives flush with cash. Especially during the years 1986 to 1999, when CD sales were at an all time high. Post-napster, in the new digital millennium rife with piracy, music was heavily devalued, and industry revenues plummeted. Music came to be perceived as FREE on the internet, and labels wasted their time and remaining money trying to individually sue stoner kids living in their parents’ basement.  \n\nAfter much pain and hardship, the likes of Spotify “saved” the music industry by ushering in what’s commonly known as the *access era*—almost every piece of music on earth can now be ubiquitously accessed, on demand. \n\nBut this universal and ubiquitous access to music created another problem: it made the talent market universally accessible, and we all know how that goes:\n\n<https://twitter.com/YashBagal/status/1219241991680118784?s=20> \n\n<https://twitter.com/YashBagal/status/1372683449505607682?s=20> \n\n<https://twitter.com/dada_drummer/status/1304775129549934596?s=20> \n\nBut now with web3, the music industry seems to have cycled back to a new version of an old age: talk to a crypto-pilled early adopter, and they’re sure to tell you that we’ve moved from ownership (CDs, cassettes, downloads) to access (streaming on Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, etc) and back to ownership (NFTs, fractional ownership, etc.) NFTs admittedly offer a radical shift from the dog-eat-dog, numbers game the music industry is today — where success means virality, stream counts, and engagement rates. However, there is an inherent problem with the blanket assumption that ownership is seeing a resurgence. To put it in relative terms, the extent to which ownership is seeing  a come-back, is similar to the ‘revival’ of Vinyl. It’s fringe. It’s niche. And its proponents are hell bent to convince you otherwise. \n\nThe central question is this — why would someone want to own a specific piece of music today if most of it is available on demand? \n\nIn an illuminating essay called *[Why Own Anything](https://twitter.com/lessin/status/1445453780393234442?s=20),* Sam Lessin outlined three reasons why individuals own anything: \n\n1. Financial Capital \n2. Social Capital \n3. Utility and/or Pleasure \n\nLet’s unpack each one of these within the context of music. \n\n## Financial Capital\n\nIndividuals might be willing to pay money to own an asset today with the hope that it accrues value or be a source of future cash flows. Ditto Music’s Opulous for example, [enables](https://opulous.org/Opulous.pdf) music creators to offer copyright-backed NFTs to their fans in exchange for: \n\n* Future royalty earnings (cash flow)\n* Hope that value increases (future sale)\n* Exclusive rewards: backstage passes, gig tickets, merchandise. (financial savings) \n\nDoes a fan invest to support the artist? Does the fan invest in hopes of future financial returns? Fans and financial investors may have very different interests and NFTs weave those two groups together. Who someone decides to support financially may not necessarily be linked with whom they are a fan of. \n\nWith my supporter hat on, I’d probably buy NFTs offered by artists I’m a fan of. Amazing folks such as Feng Suave and Sports Team. With my investor hat on, I’d probably think it's a better bet to invest in Adele, or Lorde, or Taylor Swift! \n\nAnd this is precisely what most music consumers might do. The large majority of music consumers will decide to invest in “blue-chip” artists rather than making more riskier investments in the obscure, experimental, and alternative acts they love. (but clearly don’t trust with their money!) \n\nThis brings up an uncomfortable possibility: Yes, NFTs are framed as fans supporting the emerging middle class of music creators. But practically, will it just lead to upper class fans (i.e. those who have the means to pay) supporting upper class artists?  (i.e. those who are already on the favorable end of a highly skewed power law) \n\nWill the power law persist, stronger than ever? Just like the 1% of artists driving 90% of the streams today, will 1% of artists attract 90% of investments tomorrow? It’s possible. \n\nLiron Shapira [summed it up](https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/chris-dixons-crypto-claims-are-logically-flimsy-a26cc8906b3f) pretty well: \n\n*“Whether or not NFTs are in the picture, the hardest challenge for artists is how to compete in a market where the supply of songs far exceeds the supply of hours per listener per day.”*\n\nThe good news however, is that all of this may not really matter. Streaming payouts are currently pro rata, which has made it a numbers game, and a zero sum one. There is one pie and everyone’s clawing for a piece. Web3 however, is inherently user-centric due to its decentralized structure. Each artist runs their own patisserie delivering their own pie, on their own terms, to their 1000 true fans. Heck it need not even be a pie, it could be a brownie for all I care! The point is, music creators are free, and not locked into any specific DSP. They can use this autocracy to directly connect with fans—nurturing and monetizing those relationships as they please. \n\nMoreover, fans can co-create value alongside the music creators they love! This is not some idealistic philosophy that web2 ‘artist-first’ companies love to spew. It makes logical sense: In the current music industry, value accrues towards the center of the network. The only way to increase the value of an IP asset aka music copyright, is to have it exploited by a central stakeholder with market control and domain specific expertise *a.k.a* Record Labels. Today, the Majors control huge swathes of the digital music supply chain, and have the capital and the human resources to make their music heard. \n\nThings are radically different on the other side, in a web3 world where fans own a piece of their favorite artist’s music. Micro invested fans, or fractional owners of music don’t have market control or expertise to increase the value of the asset they have a stake in. These fans may be able to provide financial capital to the artists they love, but can’t really provide business expertise. In a decentralized music industry however, this doesn’t matter either! Music creators will be able to seamlessly co-create with other music creators, and invested (token holding) fans will be able to directly connect with other fans. Value will accrue at the edges of the network, away from central intermediaries: DSPs, and social media platforms which act as powerful gatekeepers today.  \n\n<https://twitter.com/YashBagal/status/1232352795581394946?s=20> \n\nBas Grasmayer wrote a fascinating essay about fan clubs structured as DAOs. Imagine that as a part of an artist’s release strategy, they assign some percentage of their song’s copyright to their fan club (structured as a DAO), with future royalties flowing into the DAO’s treasury. Micro-invested fans could use that shared treasury to collectively hire managers, agents and other music business professionals to help develop the artist they’ve invested in. It’s not a giant leap to envision a web3 native version of [Hipgnosis](https://www.hipgnosissongs.com/investment-objective-and-policy) structured as a DAO, facilitating portfolio management for micro investors. \n\nIt’s important to note that platforms that enable fractional ownership in the copyright of a song [have existed](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/would-you-invest-your-own-money-into-your-favorite-artists-music-872744/) for a long time now. Equity crowdfunding platforms like [Corite](https://corite.com/), [Global Rockstar](https://www.globalrockstar.com/#/projects) and [Songbook](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/this-uk-startup-allows-fans-to-earn-royalties-from-an-artists-music/) have offered fans the ability to be fractional owners of music, but haven’t really picked up steam. This is because they equate fractional ownership in copyrights with retail investing in the stock market. To me however, ownership in music seems to be fueled more by fandom than by pure financial interest. Therefore, we need web3 networks that prioritize fan base development and community building features over features that promote financial returns.  \n\n**Rights Management—The Boring Elephant in the Room** \n\nEven though NFTs offer a new way for fans to invest in music, how that money flows back to fans is still based on legacy technology. Multiple owners of a song’s copyright will only add to the already abysmal metadata problem that has plagued the industry since time immemorial. Payouts will inevitably be complicated for web3 networks to handle. Even for one conventional pop song, every single recording artist, songwriter, producer and invested fan will have to be onboarded to web3 before they get paid. In an interview for Cadence, Philly based producer Yuri Beats spoke about his experience selling his publishing rights as an NFT through Royalty Exchange for $51,000.\n\n*“The fact that this was an NFT does not mean that the calculation of royalties is occurring on the blockchain. It's occurring manually behind the scenes. This is a step towards more on-chain components and accountability around royalty distribution.”* \n\nMoreover, the music industry runs on opacity and is rife with NDAs. Technology that ushers in transparency is still limited by archaic contractual standards that may take a while to shake off. You can only be transparent about things you are legally permitted to disclose. (More on this in Part 3!) \n\nI see these as minor road bumps which will fall into place as more elements of the music supply chain are brought on-chain. Currently however, it’s like fitting brand new taps without changing the existing cloggy plumbing. \n\n## Social Capital\n\nAnother main reason we own things is because doing so helps us play status games. In a previous essay, I wrote about the signalling embedded in the ownership of digital assets: \n\n*“..NFTs are rarely about the content. They are about the community. Anybody who is willing (and able) to pay $475 to see a $69 million JPEG is probably worth meeting. The same can be said about some of the other hyped NFTs: Buying a pixelated CryptoPunk for upwards of 23 ETH (\\~$80,000) gives you access to a community of individuals who have the willingness and ability to pay the same. It’s expensive signalling, just like important execs taking private jets to meet clients (instead of just sending a Zoom link). We are social animals, and social signals are very important.”*\n\nBut Sam points out a key difference between the ownership of physical assets versus digital assets. Owning a rare vinyl or piece of art is valuable because they are illiquid assets (for the most part). They are hard to acquire and cannot be easily traded. Digital assets in the cryptoverse are highly liquid. Anybody can go to OpenSea, Foundation or any other NFT marketplace and buy, sell, or trade these products. This reduces their perceived value, i.e. the social capital associated with owning them. What are the social conventions around the ownership of audio files as NFTs? Where can fans display them? And will anybody care? Only time will tell. \n\nIf everything is ownable, it will fundamentally change what we consider “ownership”\n\n<https://mobile.twitter.com/ljin18/status/1449163388425285636> \n\n## The rising tides of groupthink \n\nThe social hype and celebrity involvement around NFTs is directly tied to their financial value, exposing fan-investors to significant risks:\n\n*“As Water & Music [reported previously](https://www.waterandmusic.com/music-nft-market-update-q2-2021-sales-down-by-over-90-but-artists-are-still-experimenting/), the music NFT market reached its peak just over six months ago — generating nearly $27 million in primary sales in a month, thanks largely to blockbuster campaigns from the likes of 3LAU, RAC, Steve Aoki and Diplo. Since then, primary sales have plummeted by over 95% to just around $1.5 million a month on average, with almost no celebrity drops in sight.”* \n\nWe often talk about NFTs letting fans empower the middle class of artists. But what about the upper class of celebrity artists affecting the middle class of fans? When investors also happen to be fans, there is an irrational increase in risk appetite, in what is largely an unregulated space. \n\nWhen social and financial forces are inextricably linked, it leads to many unique challenges. But let's take a moment to explore the (amazing!) opportunities: \n\nFractional ownership could enable artists to deploy the most effective micro influencer campaign we’ve ever seen. Ownership in a song could lead to organic evangelism. As an emerging artist, offering your fans a portion of your song as something they can own and rightfully call theirs, opens up the most potent promotional method we’ve known since our gossipy hunter-gatherer days — word of mouth. Fans who literally own the song will be even more incentivized to promote it. \n\nFractional ownership could even enable smarter promotional campaigns: Instead of paying an influencer marketing agency $10,000 to deploy 10 micro-influencers, you could offer each of those influencers a 1% share in the song you want them to promote. Their financial compensation could be tied to their actual performance instead of their existing social following! Creating engaging content and the results that content drives could all lead to higher equity in the song itself. Currently, many emerging creators who play an influential role in the virality of a song don’t have a financial upside in the song’s success. Fractional ownership could give these creators skin in the game. Emerging and enthusiastic creators would receive a better financial compensation (based on the streams that they drive for example) rather than a disinterested celebrity’s half-hearted post. And all of this could be potentially baked into a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Exciting stuff indeed. \n\nToday however, these behaviours are still locked into centralized web2 platforms. Opulous, for example, [states](https://opulous.org/Opulous.pdf) that “fans will not only receive royalty payments, but also unlock exclusive rewards (...) by sharing it on social media”. But these activity-based rewards are not embedded into the smart contract. If I create a TikTok based on an artist’s latest single, and it leads to 25000 streams, will I therefore be entitled to 1 backstage pass? Currently, my success is still beholden to how TikTok’s FYP recommends my content, what Spotify considers an official stream, and Opulous’s own policies. ($OPUL holders are not vested with governance rights presently.) \n\nIt's also important to note that which NFT gets owned and the social hype around them is still controlled by centralized web2 platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, etc. Web3 platforms struggle with discovery due to their decentralized, p2p structure. \n\n**Side Note:** Just because centralized web2 platforms control discovery doesn’t mean they understand how the cryptoverse works. TikTok recently tried to leverage its ability to aid discovery among its [1 billion MAUs ](https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-one-billion-monthly-active-users/)to launch it’s own NFT collection, [partnering](https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/09/30/tiktok-dropping-nft-collection-lil-nas-x-bella-poarch-brittany-broski/) with the likes of Lil Nas X and Bella Poarch. But [recent investigation](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/tiktok-nfts-lil-nas-x-bella-poarch-1239785/) from the Rolling Stone suggests that Lil Nas X has pulled out of the campaign, and Bella Poarch is reconsidering her involvement as well. The currently unfolding fiasco just underscores how little web2 platforms understand the factors that drive ownership and community in the cryptoverse. \n\n## Utility and/or Pleasure\n\nWe now come to the third and final reason why people own things. On the utility side of things, it is quite clear — owning an NFT of an audio file is not useful. You do not need to own the file to listen to it, just like you don’t need to own a jpeg to see it. In terms of pleasure, it is a subjective realm and beauty lies in the eye (ears?) of the beholder. Music is a great source of pleasure for us all, and the degree of pleasure we derive from it is hard to get into without attempting to define what art is—a lifelong pursuit for some. All this to just say: let’s skip this one for now! :) \n\n## Concluding Thoughts\n\n*Until now*, the unpleasant reality about the business of music was that what’s good for the consumer and what’s good for the creator were often located on opposite ends of the spectrum. *Financially supporting* music creators to help build a healthy middle class was in stark contrast to f*inancially investing* in music creators, hoping for hyper growth in the value of the copyright they create. \n\n** \n **Web3 promises to change that. Creators and fans can “win” together. But a question worth asking is what does winning *actually* mean? Web3 blurs the line separating fans and investors—fundamentally changing the music industry as we know it. But when *art* and *commerce* become inextricably linked, it risks becoming entertainment.

{"id": "cE1bv-geIMLl2lh0jC1Alm2HrZLPncIep1IeX6yMsEo", "title": "Why everyone hates the word ‘influencer’ and what it really means", "body": "There are few words more hated on the internet than “influencer”. Try googling “why I hate the word influencer” and you will find one blogpost after another with this exact title. Some of them explain why they hate being called an influencer, and others why they hate influencers, but they all have one thing in common — “influencer” is a bad word.\n\nI was very curious when I started hearing this, because this space (whatever we want to call it) is growing massively in terms of people involved and value created. I’m going to try to chronicle and break down why this word is so hated, what it really means and what this industry is all about.\n\nNon-influencers seem to hate the word influencer because they kind of hate influencers. The word conjures images of reality celebrity, artifice, undeserved riches, wastefulness and vanity. The particular brand of ‘influencer’ imagined is the fashion/lifestyle/travel variety.\n\n> *“I too hate the word “influencer”. I believe it leads Instagrammers to have an inflated sense of self-importance. It’s both annoying and pretentious.” — [unnamed Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fc0om9/i_hate_the_word_influencer/)*\n\nThe fact that these imagined people are also [making a ton of money](https://daisychains.co/2020/03/11/why-i-hate-the-word-influencer/) from ‘influencing’ (read: manipulating) others into consuming products just adds insult to injury.\n\nPeople who could reasonably be called influencers hate the word because of the negative connotations (described above) that it carries. If the world thinks influencers are pretentious, vain, overpaid salespeople you wouldn’t want to be called an influencer either. Content creators share their passions, authentic selves and product recommendations to the audience they have worked hard to build. Most of them are extremely hardworking and often not earning enough money to support themselves fully from their side hustle — they feel grossly misunderstood by the term ‘influencer’.\n\n# So what exactly is an influencer?\n\nWithout getting too bogged down in semantics, let’s break down what influencers actually do. Starting at the beginning: anyone who could be called an influencer has probably spent years building an online audience by regularly sharing high-quality content that others find valuable. Some started with the goal of growing their audience to support a full-time business and others grew organically, but the common thread is that they regularly (most likely daily in the context of Instagram) posted content that others found valuable.\n\nIt isn’t possible to build a massive following without dedicating time and energy into producing quality content — with increased competition on social media, the quality bar has only been rising in recent years. And it certainly isn’t possible to build any kind of following if your content isn’t valuable to people. Unless you are giving them value, people will not follow you. So it’s clear that those we call influencers have worked hard and created value for others.\n\n# The business models available to content creators\n\nSo let’s talk about the elephant in the room: brand deals. Before we get into that, I think it would be helpful to break down the different types of revenue available to someone who has built a big online following by sharing valuable content. While there are some variations within them, we can identify 5 basic models:\n\n* Advertising (getting paid for eyeballs)\n* Subscriptions (getting paid for access to content/community)\n* Commerce (getting paid for digital or physical products or services)\n* Donations (getting paid for making people feel good)\n* Social tokens (getting paid for access, donation and ownership)\n\nI would argue that any type of content creator with a substantial enough following could make money through any of these models, but the convenience depends on their primary platform. People who mainly produce videos on YouTube can easily make money through ads via the YouTube partner program, and they can also set up channel memberships in order to monetize from subscriptions. Those using the live-streaming feature on YouTube can also accept donations. Blogging lends itself well to advertisement via the website, and newsletter writing can easily be monetized via subscriptions (for example via medium or sub stack). But what about the main ‘influencer platform’ Instagram?\n\n# The role of Instagram in the rise of the influencer\n\nInstagram does not share its advertising revenue with content creators. As a side note Instagram made [$24 billion](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/instagram-statistics/) in advertising revenue in 2020. None of that went to creators, even though they are the reason Instagram is able to sell ads. Without valuable content on the platform, nobody would use Instagram. It also doesn’t provide a way for creators to gate part of their content behind a subscription, and it doesn’t have a donation mechanism built in.\n\nInstagram has been moving more into commerce lately, but really the only way content creators on Instagram have been able to monetize their audience is through doing their own advertising via brand deals and affiliate links. This has been the genesis of the “influencer”.\n\nNow that we’ve seen why Instagrammers tend to monetize via brand deals, let’s get into the nuts and bolts of it.\n\n> *“Aspyn Ovard has 2.2 million followers, so she could reasonably charging around $20,000 for this photograph. Yet, even if she did her hair and makeup specifically for this photo, and tidied her room and edited it with a custom setting, it’s unlikely she spent more than a couple of hours creating this image. Therefore, she’s pretty much charging $10,000 per hour” ([source](https://daisychains.co/2020/03/11/why-i-hate-the-word-influencer/))*\n\n# Content creators are value creators for their audience, but they sell the value to brands\n\nLet’s go back to the concept of value creation. I already mentioned that if someone has a big audience on any platform, it means they are providing something of value — their content satisfies the needs of the people who follow them by providing education, inspiration or entertainment. You may doubt the value of some specific content to *you*, but even if you find fashion posts to be meaningless, they are clearly worth something to the people who consume them.\n\nNow let’s talk about another kind of value — the value of access to an audience. Because content creators themselves need to find a market for their content, they need to focus on a specific niche and satisfying the needs and wants of that specific audience ([more on niches here](https://ghost.org/blog/find-your-niche-creator-economy/)). Granted, this isn’t how many content creators think of their audience (usually they think of the content first and then look for the audience), but even if it came about accidentally, the fact is that audiences around creators tend to have common characteristics. This is one reason why access to these audiences is valuable for brands.\n\nAnother reason is that creators have built trust with their audience. One distinguishing feature of content entrepreneurship vs other types of businesses is that the individual personality, talents and passions of the creator permeate the business. This human connection builds trust with the audience in a way that brands struggle to do naturally.\n\nIn the best case, creators use their platforms to recommend products they genuinely love and can stand behind. Anything else can quickly erode trust and lose followers. When influencers misuse their audience’s trust to recommend irrelevant or bad products, or they promote products too frequently, there is a corrective mechanism. Followers who cease to enjoy a creator’s content are one button away from breaking off the relationship.\n\n# Price is determined by value to the buyer not cost to the seller\n\nSo now that we have an understanding of the value that influencers offer their audience, and the value that influencers can offer brands, let’s talk about the money in the equation. As we learned in the quote above, someone with 2.2 million followers could be earning $20,000 for an Instagram post, which might put their hourly rate at $10,000. I’ve heard the 1% of followers rule of thumb before, but the exact numbers don’t really matter here — the fact is that a lot of people seem to think that influencers are making too much money for too little work.\n\n> *“If you’re an influencer, and you’re working with a company, invest the time equivalent to the money they are investing in you. It’s only fair” (same [source](https://daisychains.co/2020/03/11/why-i-hate-the-word-influencer/) as above)*\n\nThere are a couple things wrong with this line of reasoning. First, products and services in the market are not priced based on how much they cost someone, but how much they are worth to someone. If content creators charged brands a flat 10% profit on the cost of producing a single post, they would be vastly underselling their value. The brands would be the big winners in this equation, not the entrepreneurs who have spent years building up an online following and work hard everyday to inspire, educate and entertain their audience without any payment from that audience.\n\nAnother mistake is to underestimate the time, effort and number of people involved in producing content. Professional content creators, influencer or otherwise, have not only spent years producing high quality content on the daily with no pay, but they need their one brand deal per week (or insert time frame here) to support all of the unpaid content that they work to produce for their audience. Not to mention the fact that many creators employ professionals both for the creation side of their business and the business operations side — photographers, video editors, accountants, marketing managers and more support many mid- to large- size content creator businesses.\n\n# Hatred of the word ‘influencer’ is based on a misunderstanding of value exchange in online content creation\n\nThe hatred of the word influencer is based in a lot of misunderstanding and individual examples of poor behavior, but the confusion is rooted deeper than just the word “influencer” and is based on a misperception of the growing world of online content entrepreneurship. Creators who successfully grow a following are undeniably offering something valuable to that audience. They deserve to monetize and build a business around that, regardless of which of the revenue types suits them best or is available to them on the platform they use. In my view, growing an online following by producing content and building a business around it is a legitimate and honorable way to become an entrepreneur and live life on your own terms. The real villains here are platforms like Instagram who have lined the pockets of investors by selling advertising on top of content produced by creators for free.\n\nIn case you were wondering, I personally have no loyalty to the word “influencer”, but I don’t think it’s a bad word. However, I think there are far more useful terms like “content creator”, “creator” and “content entrepreneur” which address a wider group of people who don’t monetize via brand sponsorships alone.\n\nIf you are a creator and are interested in reading more about the business of content creation, check out my website [The Creator Startup](https://delicious-nightshade-660.notion.site/The-Creator-Startup-8d9672d77632461e8368328c0fd7bc49).", "timestamp": 1635412806, "digest": "jo-lGq_ktZ-OiBT3ElLc37vNWefMHc7sHmgRHM8Ok-Q", "contributor": "0x51aC35f16451Ba0AB5B74e4bF5dF7f0A95e1666d"}

Well, it’s time to actually build out the DAO, now (hehe it rhymes).\n\nHere’s what I see as essential next steps, in no particular order:\n\n* Create the $SEOL token\n  * Figure out tokenomics\n* Recruit key contributors\n* Create and launch the website\n  * Keep it simple for now\n* Communicate the various membership tiers and requirements to rank up\n* Create and launch Production 0 and related NFTs\n  * Proof-of-concept\n  * Purpose is to communicate what exactly Productions should be and look like and feel like\n  * Generate initial amount of revenue\n\nBut after reading up a bit on building great communities, I’ve learned that the most important thing, of course, is cultivating that awesome community \\~vibe\\~.\n\nGood vibes come from engaged, intrinsically motivated members.\n\n[This article](https://club.mirror.xyz/hUCOZNvJ7uQI7DXOAmz3Rr-yt82o9gTiJx5T5srD5tc) from Seed Club really shed some light on the basics of community building.\n\nIn summary, attracting, recruiting, and engaging the right people is essential for a community to thrive.\n\nI have so many grand plans floating inside my head for what Seolis could eventually become.\n\nInsane digital experiences, crazy IRL events, creative retreats, co-living houses, etc.\n\nBut at its core, Seolis (and really any DAO) will always be about the people. And I mustn’t forget that.\n\nSo expect a lot of activity from me on the Discord! \n\nI really want to hold a community gathering sometime soon to hear people’s voices, get to know you all, and discuss everyone’s goals, ideas, and visions for Seolis.\n\nOh, and I decided to also film frequent vlogs documenting my work and thought process as I build Seolis out. \n\nI was definitely going back and forth in my head with the idea, but I decided it'd be a great opportunity to really connect with everyone. \n\nWords are great, but there’s something about watching and listening to someone talk. Plus, I don’t think there’s anyone out there right now documenting the DAO creation process on video, so I’ll get to be the first!\n\nThe first vlog is right [here](https://youtu.be/119JZBn0ElE).\n\nThank you so much for being part of this amazing community. I feel like we’re all on one big epic journey, and I'm so, so excited for it all 🏔\n\nBest,\n\nEric\n\nPS: If you have experience in setting up DAOs, or know anyone who might, would love to have a chat!

The users then become stakeholders in the platform\n* If under-appreciated users created network effects, agents will create exponential hyper-network effects\n* Cracking the right token model and allowing users to enjoy the value creation can unleash wild growth opportunities in Web3\n\n### The hybrid token model\n\nAn increasing number of web 3 startups are choosing a hybrid token and equity model. This new model is a new and exciting primitive in web 3, and it allows for protocols, dapps, centralized companies, and startups to share the value creation that was historically shareholder exclusive, with users and participants of the protocol.\n\nHybrid tokens ‘curve-out’ equity value to additional stakeholders, allowing them to enjoy the success of the platform. The main idea around a hybrid model is to create a token that has a utility within the platform. The token is not a security and is not eligible to profits the company makes, but rather enables different kinds of interactions within the platform such as voting on feature changes, discounts on platform fees (e.g. lower fees in exchanges), or platform participation. Although the token is not eligible to profit rights as equity, it also enjoys a growing demand as the product/platform succeeds.\n\nHybrid models solve so of the misalignment between early users and the platform. Web aggregators such as social networks use early users to build the network, putting a lot of work, enthusiasm and actively building and contributing to it. When you invited friends to Facebook in 2008 you expanded the network. When you shared an image or wrote a blog post you expanded the network. These early users are the reason this network could scale and all of us can enjoy it today. Hybrid tokens are about sharing that value creation with them and about alignment.\n\n### From users to agents\n\nHybrid models incentivize users to become agents of the platform. They know that if the platform succeeds, they might enjoy an economic upside on the token they are holding. In many cases, this is connected to some kind of decentralization of the product/ network.\n\nHybrid models can solve a lot of the problems that are familiar with web 2 apps, like an incentive for central platforms to use the [attract and extract](https://youtu.be/rW8GrxQYPbI?t=42) model or monetize users’ data.\n\nEarly users are incentivized to become power users, help the platform grow, and acts as its best agent. This model is in essence much fairer towards users because it rewards the loyal users that helped to build success and believed in the project from the early days.\n\n### Incentive Alignment Creates Hyper Network Effect\n\nIf I knew that I hold an asset that is correlated to the success of the platform, what would I do as a user?\n\nAn early Facebook user would probably invite all of his friends, share a ton of content and images, and will be really excited about the growth of the network. So tokens allow for network growth, much faster than the regular network effect we know. This is what we call a ‘hyper network effect’.\n\n### Some examples\n\nUsing a hybrid approach can have different forms. We would like to point out a few examples, that although are essentially different, all share the same idea that users can participate in the success of the project without owning equity, but rather other digital assets that make them stakeholders.\n\n[Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) is a play-to-earn digital game in which users can earn by playing and participating in the Axie universe, inspired by Pokémon. Users can use their Axis to battle other users and earn ERC-20 tokens (‘Smooth Love Potions’), breed their Axis, or sell them on the market. The mix of users being able to play, trade and earn, combined with addictive game dynamics, has brought Axie revenues to explode through the roof, with $330B in protocol revenues until today (yes, 330 billion dollars). Instead of the founders building a centralized marketplace and controlling the Axie universe, they have opened it up so users can enjoy the tremendous growth throughout playing, earning, or just speculating. This approach has shared the amazing Axie Infinity universe growth with day-to-day users, creating a recursive cycle of highly engaged users.\n\n[Rally](https://rally.io/) is a social tokens platform on which different creators can issue their own social tokens. The social token is used by creators for direct engagement with their audience, create unique gated content, and helping creators build their own monetization channel. The Rally token, RLY, serves as the beating heart of this creator economy — users can purchase creator tokens using RLY, hold it, or stake them in DeFi protocols and earn yield.\n\nRally platform constantly encourages users to participate and support creators, by airdropping them with RLY tokens when buying and holding creator tokens. The airdropped RLY tokens can be used to purchase and support more creator tokens and earn more RLY in turn — a participate-to-earn model, turning users into highly engaged agents.\n\n[ZED RUN](https://zed.run/) is a digital horse racing game in which users can buy horses on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/zed-run-official). The horses are ERC-20 tokens that are fully transferable and tradable as digital assets, plus they can be bred with other horses so the owner can earn fees on breeding.\n\nWhile these NFTs are part of participation in the game (you need a horse to participate in a race), users of the platform get exposure to its success by buying and breeding digital horses. This can create an addictive participation cycle that makes users ultra engaged.\n\n### Questions when issuing a hybrid token model\n\nWhen designing a hybrid token approach within your platform, some key important questions to ask are -\n\n* Are we issuing tokens in a way that encourages users to participate?\n* Are we transforming users into agents? will they be incentivized to grow the platform?\n* Can early users be exposed to the major upside? How can we help them become long-term stakeholders?\n* Are we generous to our users? How can we share our success with them?\n\n### This is just the beginning\n\nHybrid models are still in the exploration phase but can be a powerful tool both for startups as a growth hacking tool and both for the users that can enjoy the success of the platform through token price appreciation.\n\nWe believe slicing the traditional equity value to different stakeholders tiers (which are not just shareholders and early investors) is one of the strongest primitives in web3 and crypto, and can create user alignment in a way that was not possible before.\n\nSome cynics will try to claim this as a sophisticated way to disguise security. This is a complete misunderstanding of a new financial primitive that is not classified under stocks/bonds/commodities.\n\nHybrid models are around creating a rich space of digital assets, which are programmable and play different roles within the digital economy.

同样是个内容产品，产品的名字就叫半成品。低频更新，里面包含一些关于文化、Web3 和未来的思考。每一篇文章还会单开一个频道供会员进行讨论，而所有的讨论内容最终也会被加到文章中，作为内容输出的一部分。\n* Gatekeeper - 一个用于在线下活动中验证链上身份状态的应用，被使用在所有 FWB 线下活动中。\n* 画廊 - 一个 NFT 展示及拍卖平台。\n* FWB 大学 - 一个 Web3 培训产品，尚未上线。\n* 各类 Event – 无论是线下还是线上，各类的 Event 其实也是 FWB 的核心产品。\n\n在 BanklessDAO 里我们看到，成员聚在一起后出现了热烈的讨论，并且迅速形成了很多由公会推进的项目。在 FWB 里，这么多有意思的人在一起，就没碰撞出什么吗？\n\n有的，而且更多。但在 FWB 里，成员碰撞出来的 idea 大都自己组合下资源直接开干了。并不会等 DAO 的资助或者纳入 DAO 的框架进行协作。实际上 FWB 里已经至少碰撞出了几十个项目和新的 DAO。尤其在过去的 NFT Summer，这帮人更是如鱼得水脑洞大开，恨不得 24 小时都在搞新项目。\n\n### FWB DAO 的组织\n\n截止到 9 月初完成 1000 万美元融资的时候，FWB 只有一位全职员工。\n\n但它有超过 2000 个成员，成员里有大约 200 个贡献者，并形成了 31 个承担重要职责的活跃贡献者 (lead)。\n\n他们通过七个不同方向的分工，构成了 FWB 的组织结构。\n\n![揭秘 a16z 青睐的 DAO 组织 FWB：思考世界的下个版本](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/1adbbc36c38485aec08584ef59e6b848.jpg-article)\n\n**社论团队**\n\n社论团队负责引导社区的文化和范围，并在未来负责对外的文化输出。\n\n负责每周文摘和「半成品」两个产品。\n\n**会籍团队**\n\n负责会籍申请审核，由一个 15 人的委员会组成。\n\n负责几个会员多元化项目，用于支持各类有多元化背景但资金不足的成员加入 FWB。\n\n负责线上活动。\n\n负责拓展其他会员福利。\n\n**产品团队**\n\n负责社区所需要的产品设计和开发。\n\n完成了 Gatekeeper，画廊两个项目。更多新项目进行中。\n\n**城市团队**\n\n负责城市 SubDAO 的组织运行。\n\n**活动团队**\n\n负责各类线下活动的策划、运营和组织。\n\n**合作团队**\n\n负责各类生态合作。\n\n**DAO 团队**\n\n负责 DAO 基础组织运营、战略、财政管理。\n\n### 创造世界的下一个版本\n\nFWB 是多元和复杂的。它像是俱乐部，又超越俱乐部。一个成员可以很现实的关注 Trading 频道里有没有在聊财富密码，NFT 频道里有什么新项目，或者只是参加各种活动，认识有意思的人，享受美好时光拓展人脉。但也有更多人对于文化，Web3 以及他们能对社会哪些方面带来影响有极大的热情。他们在不断碰撞，思考这个世界的下一个版本是什么样，并试图创造出来。当然这二者并不冲突，一边通过聚会认识更多志同道合的人，享受社交的乐趣，一边共同思考和创造未来，无论能不能成，都是非常美好的事。\n\n大家每天都在 hanging out，享受美好时光，而不是像 banklessDAO 那样形成一个个公会，把所有人塞进去，以高度结构化的方式在组织整个 DAO 的运作。造成的结果就是几乎没有什么文档留存下来，更别说形成一个社区 Wiki。关于历史和思考往往都留在一些关键人员和早期成员的脑子中。\n\n但它又是一个有着如此复杂特质的社区，在频道里逛几天根本不足以理解这个社区。为了了解 FWB 到底是什么，我翻阅频道里的大量历史信息，阅读了所有的提案及相关详细文档，听了大约 10 小时的 podcast 采访和各类媒体文章，最终才勉强拼凑出了 FWB 的模样和特质。\n\n但对于这样一个小世界，短短几周的探索真的不敢说对它了解的有多深，有些信息和理解甚至有可能是错误的。但好的社区是有这样的魔力，无论你以什么目的来到这里，最终会被它感染，产生归属的热情。未来 FWB 到底能长成什么样，我很期待。\n\n时间回到 9 月初，FWB 拿到了 A16z 为首的几家机构一千万美元的投资。由于 FWB 是个 DAO，接受这个投资本身也需要成员的同意。于是有一个提案被发起，详细描述了为什么要接受投资以及这个钱用来做什么，提案高比例获得了通过。\n\n提案的最后这么写道：\n\n> 如果把 FWB 看做一个数字城市，这个提案是我们发展城市郊区的方式。\n>\n> 当我们将这些扩展到整个社区，我们也会把一个模型融进这个社会的血脉。在这个模型中，互联网中的陌生人可以聚在一起并重新定义我们创造和资助文化的方式。\n>\n> 那些从第一天起就和我们在一起的兄弟姐妹们，让这个血誓成为一个新篇章的开始。\n>\n> 拿起你的点心，让别人听到你的声音。\n>\n> We’re all gonna make it.", "timestamp": 1635413726, "digest": "OC0D6ajmBrKXNaeVpd1hS99_3U_dwfciiUO5wc47UiU", "contributor": "0xAE623c8B158C3dF75b4f0f3886cA36b49b72f3e9"}
{"id": "QT9XpiVkpvWIk6p-latzkpaX3xGO1xFXMSRvLy5fnpA", "title": "How to Find Market-Fit as a Content Entrepreneur", "body": "## “Make something people want” — Y Combinator Motto by Paul Graham\n\nProduct-market fit is a fundamental and beautifully simple concept known in tech startups, but it hasn’t yet had enough influence in the wider business world. The framework of market-fit is an incredibly useful tool for understanding how to create value for customers and grow the business, and it is very applicable for content creators.\n\nAs a tech product manager and startup entrepreneur, I hope to bring some of my learnings from the startup playbook into the world of content creation. In this post, I will explain the concept of product-market fit, how to get there and how to know you’ve found it. When you finish reading, you’ll be able to think of your business in the framework of market fit and use it to grow your success.\n\n*I’ll be referring to ‘content-market fit’ when I mean ‘product-market fit’ in the context of content creation businesses, and ‘product-market fit’ refers to the original concept as applied to tech startups.*\n\n# Content — market fit is when your content satisfies the needs of an audience\n\nAccording to Eric Ries, ‘product-market fit’ describes a state where the product resonates with a wide set of customers ([source](https://a16z.com/2017/02/18/12-things-about-product-market-fit/)). Early stage startups chase product-market fit because finding it means that their product solves the customer’s problem — in other words, they have found the ‘right’ product. After startups find product-market fit they can focus on growth — once they know the product is ‘right’, it makes sense to invest into growing the customer base. Pouring money into growing something that hasn’t found market-fit yet is a huge risk and often a path to failure ([source](https://steveblank.com/2010/08/23/solving-the-innovators-dilemma-customer-development-in-a-big-company/)).\n\nProduct-market fit is sometimes called ‘market-product’ fit, in order to emphasize the fact that the market comes first (check out [this article](https://brianbalfour.com/essays/market-product-fit)). The key takeaway from this concept is that in order to be successful, a business must understand the needs and problems of the customers they are serving, and develop a product that meets those needs.\n\n## Starting with the product instead of the customer is putting the cart before the horse — it’s like offering a solution before you know what the problem is.\n\nApplied to content creation businesses, this concept tells us to look at the audience we want to serve and try to find content that satisfies their needs,instead of starting with the content and looking for the audience. By starting with the customer and their needs, we make sure we are creating content that a group of people actually wants to see and engage with.\n\nBack to Paul Graham’s motto: “make something people want”.\n\n# Getting to content-market fit\n\nIn the context of tech startups, the process of getting to product-market fit starts with defining a target market and understanding its members([source](https://brianbalfour.com/essays/market-product-fit)). For example, we might want to build a product for working parents. The next step would be to speak with different kinds of working parents to understand their motivations and challenges. If there is a wide variation between the challenges of different kinds of parents, we would split our market into multiple customer types and focus just on one type (for example, working single parents). If the market is defined too broadly, its unlikely that one single product would meet everyone’s needs.\n\nWe can use the same approach in the context of content creation. For example, I might choose to target millennial dog owners who live in cities, because I fall into this group so I already understand and relate to my potential customers. Next, I could talk to members of my potential audience to understand their motivations, challenges and needs.\n\nOnce the target market is defined and needs are understood, it’s all about trying to satisfy the market with your content. In tech startups, we often start by forming a hypothesis and then testing it. For example, I might form the hypothesis that millennial dog owners who live in cities want to find the most dog-friendly spots in their town and then test content that solves this need. Based on the response, I would adapt my content over time to better fulfill the desires of my audience. You can read more about optimizing for product-market fit [here](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit).\n\n# How do you know that you have found content-market fit\n\nThere are multiple signals that an early-stage startup has found product-market fit. Three favorites are a high NPS (net-promoter score), good retention, and at least 40% of users say they would be “very disappointed” if they could no longer user the product ([source](https://brianbalfour.com/essays/product-market-fit)).\n\n[NPS](https://www.netpromoter.com/know/) is a standardized score used by companies that measures how likely their customers are to recommend a product. A high NPS means the customers are very likely to recommend a product, which is taken to mean that the product meets their needs well. To apply this to your content startup, you could try to survey your audience to [measure your own NPS](https://www.hotjar.com/net-promoter-score/), or keep tabs on how much of your weekly traffic is coming from others sharing your link. This should give you a pretty good measure of whether your audience is so thrilled with your content that they are sharing it with their friends.\n\nRetention measures how many customers are returning to the product over time. If a company has bad retention, it means that many users used the product once and never came back. Good retention is when most users come back over and over again. Retention is an indicator of product-market fit, because if a product meets the needs of the customer they will keep using it! Usually, retention is measured using cohort analysis (read more [here](https://www.projectbi.net/blog/what-retention-rate-definition-guide)), but I don’t know if major content platforms provide the data you would need to run this type of analysis. As an alternative, I would consider looking at the engagement rate over time — if a high percentage of your total followers is engaging with each new piece of content, this is a signal that you have content-market fit.\n\nThe third test of product-market fit is very simple and easy to apply to content creation — you ask a random sample of your audience how disappointed they would be if they no longer had access to the content. If at least 40% say they would be “very disappointed”, you have a signal that your content is very important to your audience. You can check out more about how to run a product-market fit survey [here](https://pmfsurvey.com/).\n\nThere is no single measure of content-market fit — you need to look at it from different angles and use your intuition. If you feel like you are constantly pushing your content out there but getting little traction, you probably don’t have content-market fit. If you’re seeing organic growth, high engagement and people are telling their friends about you, then it looks like you’re onto something. After you have found content-market fit, it’s all about growing your audience. You can read about that in the next post in this series.", "timestamp": 1635413906, "digest": "NKlAlOvLLCAalta1suekStZGNn4SfhAExW7IvIL3P5U", "contributor": "0x51aC35f16451Ba0AB5B74e4bF5dF7f0A95e1666d"}

{"id": "H_XxMQK_-ZG41bIBZOW8QHh6CK7axQSB6lNMgkRxVxw", "title": "How to Grow Your Audience With the Growth Loop Framework", "body": "## This framework used by top tech companies is perfect for content creators looking to to grow their audience.\n\nTake a moment to ask yourself — **how does your audience grow**?\n\nYour answer to this question is your growth hypothesis. Regardless of whether you want to grow your audience on Instagram, YouTube, Facebook or Twitter, it is the single most important question you need to be able to answer as a content creator after you have found content-market fit (more on that [here](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-find-market-fit-as-a-content-entrepreneur-4ecc9292b12b)).\n\nWhile content-market fit is about figuring out who your audience is and what content serves their needs, your growth hypothesis is your plan for how to reach more and more people over time. It is called a hypothesis because it is a strategy that you need to test to see if it works and adapt over time. Growth loops have become an increasingly common framework for answering the growth hypothesis in tech startups.\n\nI’m not here to give you tactical advice for hustling your way to more followers - as a tech product manager and startup entrepreneur my goal is to bring valuable strategic frameworks from the startup world into the realm of content businesses.\n\nIn this article, I will explain what a growth loop is and how you can leverage them to create exponential audience growth.\n\n# Why should you care about growth loops?\n\nImagine if you had to choose between the following two growth strategies:\n\n* **Strategy** **A** leads you to reliably add 100 new followers per week\n* **Strategy** **B** leads you to reliably add 10 new followers per week, and each follower gets one friend to follow you each week\n\nWhich strategy sounds better?\n\nIf you do the math, after 10 weeks strategy A would lead you to 1000 followers and strategy B would lead you to 10,230 followers. This is because of the magic of compound growth. If each new follower brings you another person per week, you are doubling your follower count each week. You don’t need to invest as much time and money to source new followers with ads and promotions because your audience is doing the work for you.\n\nThis is the basis of the growth loop framework, and it is used by top tech companies worldwide to fuel their exponential growth.\n\n# The growth loop\n\nGrowth loops are “closed systems where the inputs through some process generate more of an output that can be reinvested in the input” (from an article by [Reforge](https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-loops)). Here is a diagram adapted from the same source:\n\n![The basic growth loop adapted from Reforge](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dmtaF2yNP6kn_AANu9HIG.jpg?height=968&width=1147)\n\nWhat this describes in practice is a situation where the actions of users (or followers), directly result in more users/followers.\n\nA real and familiar example might help make this clearer. Everyone knows Zoom since it blew up during the pandemic, but it used to be a small new entrant into a market full of big competitors including Skype, Cisco and Microsoft ([source](https://www.productled.org/foundations/what-is-product-led-growth#Chap1)).\n\nZoom used the following powerful growth loop to rise to hundreds of millions of users: any user of Zoom could create a virtual meeting and invite anyone by email, even if they were not a user of Zoom. This might sound obvious now, but think back to when Skype was the tool of choice. In order to call someone on Skype, you both had to have Skype accounts and be connected within the platform.\n\nTo call someone on Zoom, you just needed their email address. This made Zoom more frictionless, and each Zoom user who created a call with a non-user was introducing someone new to the platform ([source](https://www.thoughtlytics.com/newsletter/growth-loops)). Even if only some of the new users ended up creating accounts on Zoom, it was still enough to lead to compounding growth.\n\nThe average number of new users that each additional user brings to the platform is also known as the k factor ([source](https://phiture.com/mobilegrowthstack/the-essential-guide-to-crafting-a-successful-growth-loop-aca591aa3dca/)). Not to trigger another pandemic memory, but the k factor is kind of like the r factor used to describe the contagion of the coronavirus (how many new people are infected by each person who catches coronavirus).\n\nNow that I’ve shown you the power of growth loops, I will explain 3 different growth loops that you can tap into as a content creator.\n\n# Three growth loops you can use as a content creator\n\n# Growth loop #1 — the social sharing growth loop\n\nIn the social sharing growth loop, an existing follower shares your content either to all their followers via reposting or to a specific person via a private message. This leads to new people discovering you and some percentage of them following you. These then become new followers who will see your content and share it with their networks. You can see how the loop continues to reinforce your growth as more people follow you:\n\n![The social sharing growth loop](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IN9NGzkHFBIrkWbwI98Qk.jpg?height=940&width=1105)\n\nWhile it may seem like this growth loop just ‘happens naturally’ if you’re using a social media platform, there are things you can do to drive it. Anything you do that encourages people to share your content will add fuel to this engine, but strategies generally fall into two buckets:\n\n1. Produce content that people are naturally inclined to share\n2. Incentivize your audience to share\n\nSome examples of content that people are naturally inclined to share: funny videos, educational content or something that has some FOMO attached, like a time-limited deal. It goes without saying that the content has to already resonate with your audience for them to want to share it.\n\nThere are a multitude of ways to incentivize your audience to share your content, which will depend on your exact situation. One example I canthink of is as a newsletter writer you could consider giving your audience referral codes and grant them a free month of the paid newsletter for every new subscriber they refer (read more about how [PayPal pioneered this strategy here](https://viral-loops.com/blog/paypal-referral-program-case-study/)).Another classic example is the giveaway that asks people to tag their friends in a post.\n\nRemember that the strategy you choose has to fit to your content and feel like a win-win to your audience or it could fall flat.\n\n# Growth loop #2 — the social ranking growth loop\n\nThis growth loop happens naturally on social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. These platforms already have discovery built-in — they have mechanisms like ‘related content’ and ‘people you should follow’, whereby they may recommend your profile or content to people who have not yet discovered you.\n\nYou are more likely to be recommended in this way if your content gets a lot of engagement relative to the number of people who saw it. If 10 people saw your video and 9 of them watched it all the way through and commented on it, you have a very high engagement ratio and the platforms will take this as a signal of quality. The content will then be ranked higher on the platform and surfaced to more users who don’t yet follow you.\n\n![The social ranking growth loop](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iAEh4lELFSof6F6j1ZvWY.jpeg?height=983&width=1143)\n\nAgain, this growth loop might seem like it ‘just happens’ on social platforms, but you can influence it by trying to increase engagement with your content. Try to hook new viewers into your video by avoiding long-winded introductions and encourage them to leave comments by replying and making yourself available. On Twitter you may tag people or ask questions to turn passive viewers into engaged followers.\n\nThink about how this growth loop can work for you with your specific situation and focus on the framework and strategy rather than just the tactics mentioned.\n\n# Growth loop #3 — the meta UGC growth loop\n\nThe user-generated content (UGC) growth loop is how platforms like Instagram and YouTube became so big — by creating ‘user-generated’ content, the first content creators attracted other people to the platform, who then started creating their own content and attracting more people and so on.\n\nAs a content creator, you are already producing UGC and thus contributing to the growth loop of the platform you use, but you can also encourage your followers to create content in response to your content and use that to fuel your growth. If users produce content in response to yours and attribute you, then anyone who sees their content will also see yours.\n\n![The meta UGC growth loop](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EhDHDD0gFBL8cLw5RtjNO.jpg?height=1002&width=1156)\n\nThere are several examples of this growth loop that will make it more concrete. Duets on TikTok are a very well-known example — if a follower takes your video and produces a Duet of it, all of their followers will then also be exposed to your video. Twitter is another example of a platform that has this growth loop built in — the retweet allows followers to produce their own content in response to you while still quoting you.\n\nA third example I have come across is a popular blog that has a very active comments section and regularly creates [new posts](https://cupofjo.com/2021/10/reader-comments-on-kindness-2/) that are aggregations of popular reader comments on a specific topic. I’d imagine that the readers featured would be inclined to share the post in which they are mentioned, creating a combination of a UGC and social sharing growth loop.\n\nGrowth loops are one of the most powerful ideas behind the exponential growth of some of the biggest tech startups (ironically especially the startups offering content platforms). I hope that I have shown how they can be an essential framework for thinking about how to expand your audience sustainably and consistently with little continued investment. Let me know in the comments if you discovered any growth loops for content creators that I didn’t think of.\n\nI publish weekly articles that aim to help content creators by applying lessons from the tech startup playbook to content creation businesses. I also have a website called [The Creator Startup](https://delicious-nightshade-660.notion.site/The-Creator-Startup-8d9672d77632461e8368328c0fd7bc49) where I have aggregated useful resources for creators at every stage of their journey.", "timestamp": 1635414201, "digest": "bftZoI1fHkOpFFHH-Rc305HJkfHcC0UNn1tYmh0SUkY", "contributor": "0x51aC35f16451Ba0AB5B74e4bF5dF7f0A95e1666d"}

Both creators and collectors benefit from noiseless on-chain marketplaces where they can safely nourish fertile links.\n\n## General Overview\n\nDriven by the burning desire to offer NFT enthusiasts the decentralized experience they deserve, **Nil’s initial contributors introduce the Nil DAO, a decentralized cooperative leveraging the Nil Protocol V1.**\n\nThis article will serve as an overview of the mechanism implied in the Nil V1. The journey is just beginning, and contributors are confident the Nil fair launch will ignite a powerful federating movement serving creators all around the world.\n\n## Essential Concepts\n\n**At the core of Nil resides the concepts of creator’s ownership over their platform in addition to permissionless curation.**\n\nOperating simultaneously on Nil, those parties unlock powerful leverage for participants,  among which curating activities serve the artists while offering them a considerable network of passionate collectors.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3frthlkDVDeo-njxxzuPH.png?height=1148&width=2560&&&&size=large)\n\n## Artists\n\n* **Creators apply to join the Nil cohort.** To be labeled, their request needs to be supported by the curator’s community.\n* **Once part of the Nil cohort, creators enjoy the most creator-friendly launchpad.** Abstracting technical complexity, Nil offers them extensive distribution options: community granularity, pricing flexibility, time sequencing modularity, and more.\n* **Exploiting the_N_projects community,** Nil represents a built-in amplification network of collectors looking to collect and support creators in their journey.\n* Initially, **Nil DAO will not charge any primary fees.**\n* In addition to their sales revenues, **creators generate $NIL** proportionally to the support demonstrated by the N stakeholders. Creators gain ownership over the ecosystem they contribute to, the greater their input, the greater their holdings.\n* There is a premium for joining the Nil ecosystem early on. The earlier a creator releases on the platform, the greater the $NIL proportion they generate.\n* $ETH is the standard currency used to sell on Nil. Even tho, creators can choose to accept $NIL as a payment method, giving them **control over the $NIL supply as well as the $NIL demand.**\n* Nil Labeled creators finally enjoy a lifelong brand moat additionally to exclusive access to the Nil cohort and anechoic chambers for creators to prosper with their peers.\n\n## Curators\n\n* **Stake your N and $NIL to become a curator.**\n* **When staking tokens, curators generate Curating Power (CP).**\n* Curators spend their CP to support applying creators. By carrying them early on, curators serve as their mécène, a contribution for which they will ad Vitam perceive up to 20% of the $NIL generated by those supported creators. This mechanism will be introduced in a post-launch release.\n\n#### Curators should rather start accumulating CP which will very soon fuel the Nil ecosystem. Start staking your n and $NIL.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OsHGWrqrt2BrYlNGjVcnx.png?height=4320&width=7680&&&&size=large)\n\n* Curators constantly arbitrage between allocating their CP to popular creators massively supported or spreading it over the next talents for which they will perceive a great part of their generated $NIL.\n\n## Referral Program\n\n* **Additionally, the Nil Referral Program incentives peer-to-peer collaboration.**\n* **Referrers perceives forever 6.66% of the $NIL generated by the creators they introduce to Nil.** This design incentive individuals to let the Nil flow among the world.\n\n## Collectors\n\n* **Save cash.** There are no fees on Nil.\n* **Benefit from community-curated drops**,  increasing their time efficiency. This curation relies on game theory, maximizing the efficiency of the process.\n* Purchase and **mint from talented artists** in a secured way.\n* N Holders will generally benefit from gas war free drops, making their collector journey fairer and less expensive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RzY9F3qhQj6L-wuV2c3rq.png?height=1080&width=1920&&&&size=large)\n\n## Cruise with us\n\nThis is the first article of a series dedicated to digging into the Nil Protocol mechanisms. Watch out, this is just the beginning.\n\n* Join the Nil community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7n33TDN4Tw)\n* Follow Nil on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nil__dao)\n* Start onboarding artists and be proactive. **Nil DAO will always favor hackers&painters.**", "timestamp": 1635414632, "digest": "qU0CbbCSnSo63CLfAqNaL2z4S4oXqtX2ij5cCSJOFU4", "contributor": "0x73e3E8a583cC7b9b4baa0fa8B6b5241D17Ff7D36"}

{"id": "MbYOtSYVhD5d3YiBzPqYoeSyNlFoadUyufTQl-buCLw", "title": "用Zdog做一个(伪)3D的小宇宙App图标", "body": "之前简单玩了玩Zdog，用它制作了一个非常简单的3D版小宇宙图标，把过程中遇到的一些趣事分享给大家。\n\n## Zdog简介\n\nZdog是一个绘制伪3D模型的库，可以输出成Canvas或者svg。模型的geometry是在3D空间中进行计算的，渲染出来的是想被拍平的2D图像。\n\n基于这种特性，Zdog有着一些自己的特点，例如可以更好的画出「圆」的东西。3D中球体的geometry可能是由很多个三角形拼起来的，而Zdog实际渲染出的球体其实是一个平面的圆形，相比真正的球体简单了很多。\n\n对比threejs之类专门绘制3D图像的库，Zdog没有诸如mesh, texture, material, geometry之类的概念，只需要实例化自带的图形然后将他们添加到画布上就能看到图像出现在显示器上了。但也是由于一切都被简化了，像[z-fighting](https://zzz.dog/extras#z-fighting)之类的问题非常容易出现，下文的例子中就遇到了。\n\n## Quick Start\n\n使用Zdog非常简单，只需要创建一个`<canvas>`，实例化一个`Illustration` 和任意的图形，执行一下render方法就可以获得画面了。\n\n```jsx\n// create illo\nlet illo = new Zdog.Illustration({\n  // set canvas with selector\n  element: '.zdog-canvas',\n});\n\n// add circle\nnew Zdog.Ellipse({\n  addTo: illo,\n  diameter: 80,\n  stroke: 20,\n  color: '#636',\n});\n\n// update & render\nillo.updateRenderGraph();\n```\n\n当然，这样得到的画面是静止的，想要让画面动起来我们就需要不断的修改画面里的内容并且渲染，在web里最常用的就是`requestAnimationFrame` 函数了。我们只需要将上面只调用了一次的`updateRenderGraph` 函数的代码修改为如下代码，就能得到不停绕y轴旋转的图形了。\n\n```jsx\nfunction animate() {\n  // rotate illo each frame\n  illo.rotate.y += 0.03;\n  illo.updateRenderGraph();\n  // animate next frame\n  requestAnimationFrame( animate );\n}\n// start animation\nanimate();\n```\n\n## 制作过程\n\n开始编写代码之前，我们可以简单观察一下小宇宙的App图标，它能被简单的抽象为三部分：\n\n1. 中心的蓝色球体\n2. 周围的黑色环带\n3. 颜色为#fbf4f3的背景\n\n其中我们只需要给1和2制作3D模型即可。我们依次创建了`Illustration` , `Shape`和`Ellipse` 之后，将他们添加到画面中就能得到如下图形（图1）了。\n\n此时我们将环带稍加旋转就会，就会出现前面提到的z-fighting问题（如图2所示），这是由于Zdog的计算比较简单，此时`Shape`和`Ellipse` 其实都是位于原点出，Zdog并不能真正知道二者谁在谁的前面。我这里采用了一个取巧的方法，即不用一个完整的`Ellipse` ，而是使用两个半环拼凑在一起，这样当环带和球体的位置关系如图2所示时，就能算出前半环，球体以及后半环三者之间的层叠关系了（如图3）。\n\n实际代码中我们创建了一半环之后可以调用`copyGraph` 方法再原处生成一个一样的半环然后将其旋转半圈即可凑成一个环，为了让2个半环更像一个整体，我们可以将他们添加到同一个`Anchor`中（类似于group的概念）。\n\n接下来我们为图像添加旋转效果（虽然实际上环带并不是以这种方式围绕行星转动的）。由于3D中的旋转涉及到一些图形学的知识，这里我会直接给出一种简单好理解的方式。感兴趣的同学这里可以了解一下图形学中使用[四元组和欧拉角来描述旋转的方式以及万向锁问题](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/362410159)。\n\n首先我们让整个`Illustration` 在z方向上旋转`Zdog.TAU / 8` （`TAU`是Zdog中的常数，等于2*π*），之后在每一帧都去修改圆环所在`Anchor` 在y方向上的rotation。这样对两个不同的object做旋转就能避免同时修改一个物体上z和y方向上的rotation。最后我们可以使用Zdog自带的`easeInOut` 函数让旋转看起来更加自然一些。\n\n## 最终代码及成果\n\n[https://codepen.io/SunskyXH/pen/zYKOjGV](https://codepen.io/SunskyXH/pen/zYKOjGV)\n\n## 结尾\n\nZdog简单方便易上手，但经过上面的编码之后你应该也发现了：了解学习相关的基础知识才能让我们很好得解决开发中具体遇到的问题。最近也在学习blender，用它做了一个和上面类似的模型（怎么感觉没有zdog画的好看呢），希望有机会和同事们多多交流。", "timestamp": 1635420589, "digest": "z1PbOq-thqaV2I9Dkqye7P0rshbYcMJXCT6jpp6eukU", "contributor": "0x2B6607bF41d2295fe51df244B42e4D8db094edF3"}

While my personal story, as does everyone’s, comes with its share of struggle and nuance, exploring that is not the intention behind my first attempt to break into this new environment that is Web 3.0. I am writing this after almost half a year of inquiry into this developing new world enabled by the apparent adoption of Ethereum as the primary network to Engineer our future as humans on this earth.\nI have always been different. I have thought in a way I perceived as more ‘grandiose’ than others. I was often ostracized for having larger than life visions and not focusing on the minutia and what ‘mattered’. I always thought the only way to truly think about what ‘mattered’, was to zoom out, to the largest scale, and start there. This may be why my religious proclivities have not waned, despite my deep respect and passion for the pursuit of truth, of which religion is now only an artifact, a remnant of our old-world methods of finding this truth. It is precisely this religious introduction that drove my interest to the study of Geology, and our history on this earth from non-life to life, and the seemingly infinite gulf that still lies between. I still, despite my passion for science, find our religious stories beautiful; and in fact, having spent the time I have learning about this bourgeoning Ethereum community, I am drawn to one specific story from my life that I find tremendously uncanny.\n\n![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/13/7e/8c/137e8c8ee47a632fb20843fd293a4f61.jpg)\n\nThis motif of a ‘city in the sky’ is something reincarnated in many forms from within the human experience. It’s likely the roots of this concept converge to our most primitive truth-seeking/trust-forming mechanism: Early human tribalism and its ultimate proliferation into religiosity. As we left the jungles and trees, we found the need to begin to manufacture trust. This is what makes us humans so, well, human. We have each other’s backs. We formed circles, looking outward into the darkness for harm, to protect the inside of the organism that was the foundational societal unit. As language matured, and societies took root, the developing world began to collect it’s most resolute, most coherent picture of the world in ancient scripts such as the Coran, the Bible, and so on. It is here we saw this motif begin to take form. This story of a great city waiting for us, Zion, a place for refuge and peace from the world beyond ourselves. One great example comes from the book of Hebrews:\n\n> 11: 13-16 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off were assured of them, embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 14 For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland. 15 And truly if they had called to mind that country from which they had come out, they would have had opportunity to return. 16 But now they desire a better, that is, a heavenly country. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.\n\nOf course, the great thinkers of our modern age have never quite entertained the literal interpretations of such emphatic claims. Our philosophers dig into the beating heart behind the words that is the very core of our humanness; Our hunger to belong, to commune, and be accepted as the humble pilgrims and strangers of earth that we are; And our glimmering hope to walk celestial streets of gold in a ‘City in the Sky’.\n\nBut did we ever think we would see it? Were these haughty claims rooted in real belief or was this language a proxy to inculcate generations thereafter to dream to actualize such a city. Have we now arrived? Have we all been witnessing the construction of this City in the Sky, streets bustling with code, and tokens trickling through the air?\n\nLooking now to our current predicament in this western world - the real fuel behind the inception of this entire Decentralizing movement (of which I am still feeling quite late to the party, even though I keep hearing I’m still ‘very early’)- I still see much to be desired. For decades our more centralized methods of operating have begun to show some very serious fatal flaws that have caused the dissolution of the founding missions of these institutions. In tech, for instance, we’ve seen artificial plays to aggregate/manipulate eyeballs; candy crush and flappy bird, to click bait and Instagram market. Across the board, the near Orwellian neology puts on full display our societal stratification: Influencer status and supply shortages, verified and 100k SUBS, inflation is transitory, flagged for misinformation, gain-of-function, and … the list goes on. Is this really it? This disperse, incoherent, random unfolding of independent events pushing and vying for more engagement, more ad space, and ultimately more institutional power over the once idealized sovereign individual?\nIn my opinion, It is starting to look like we are rapidly approaching a panic button moment. A ‘break glass in case of emergency’, or perhaps several of these moments. We will see massive migrations to a decentralized world hosted on Web 3.0, and now in response to such migrations to these communities, it is only reasonable to expect an acceleration in the dissolving of our current institutions. What happens when our goals are met, and the central banking institutions realize their ultimate and inevitable subservience to the blockchain? I am not even remotely convinced that these migrations will all occur in lockstep, in one smooth sweep with little to no breaks in ‘uptime’ to our society moreover.\n\nThese are the things I imagine most individuals in this space already know. But I am still feeling left with the question:\n\nHow does this physically translate? Where is the real-world instantiation of this ‘City in the Sky’ we are building? And by we I of course mean you all. I have been just a mere observer thus far, looking for a way to zoom all the way out, and see the true trajectory of how this ‘City’ can maximize its ability to safehouse those seeking shelter from the debris of a collapsing institutional landscape. How do we bring the entry point into the metaverse offline, and into the physical world, and what would that even look like? Is it an educational institution? Is it the post-secondary educational alternative? Is it a country club for hodlers? Is it the workplace of the new age? Or is it a hybrid of all the above, much like a city?\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dailyhodl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ethereum-breakout-1.jpg?fit=1365%2c800&ssl=1&resize=1280%2c720)\n\nIt is here where my thoughts become less in focus because, quite frankly, I am terrified. Despite having always considered myself technically inclined relative to most (especially being still only 25), I am constantly finding myself feeling far out of my depth in this space. I feel as though I’ve barely even made it thus far, and I know that fear might be emblematic of society writ large. For the short time I’ve been a working adult, in the central finance lending space - ironically enough, I am still concerned at the cost of acquisition for the laymen into Web 3.0. The only way I see a hope for this space to fully invoke it’s potential for good, to as many souls as it can, is to bring the barrier to entry as close to the mainstream as possible. And this, must certainly tether this ‘city in the sky’ to the place where the ‘mainstream’ lives, and thinks, and breathes: this physical, off-chain earth. The way I see it, there are two discrete outcomes that will only be realized after it is too late: we can continue to meta-develop this world while we watch the world around us crumble, A.K.A. software eats the world. Or, we build a physical apparatus, a chokepoint between the physical humans and nonphysical elements in the Metaverse, to maximize the blockchains ability to proliferate our humanness. There must be a point where the blockchain pops up into the world and begins to re-establish our need for institutional order, and to meet the current model where it is to facilitate its reconstruction into the Metaverse.", "timestamp": 1635423239, "digest": "YyzKeh6mbXaomqnEL0oY0oBarvU8rwGXWIITPydoWCo", "contributor": "0x95A04A8a4baC8e70D6985b19AF9efB6DA187BC5D"}
{"id": "SPLducPd_lP4hNIATHaHwLmG18kSbhI5wXdPtBdLobs", "title": "Blockchains & Cryptocurrencies in Tanzania", "body": "**In Mid June of 2021, the President of Tanzania, Mrs. Samia Suluhu Hassan, made a speech that sent ripples of excitement and speculation around the world. In reference to the revolutionary phenomenon of blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency assets, she stated the following:** \n\n**“We have witnessed the emergence of a new journey through the internet. - I know that throughout the nation...they have not accepted or started using these routes. However, my call to the Central Bank is that you should start working on that development. - The Central Bank should be ready for the changes and not be caught unprepared.”**\n\n**Upon hearing this news, you may be wondering…What is Blockchain? & What are Cryptocurrencies? In short, Blockchain is a form of digital ledger that is completely secure and decentralized. This means that it does not depend on any third party (such as a bank, hospital, or school) to enable record keeping, peer-to-peer transactions, and contractual agreements. As a flexible and fast-growing industry, Blockchain has vast potential to fundamentally change the way people and businesses interact with each other and store information. Many promising open-source projects exist, such as Ethereum, Chainlink, Polkadot, and Cardano, that work transparently with people all over the world to explore and develop useful applications in several industries such as healthcare, education, and finance.** \n\n**In the financial sector, the most famous example of a Cryptocurrency that lives on its own Blockchain is Bitcoin, which was recently accepted as legal tender by the Central American Nation of El Salvador. Our northern neighbor of Ethiopia has also partnered with Cardano to enable millions of high school students to own their own secure digital identities on the Blockchain. In a world where so much power is held by large institutions and the most elite members of society, this technology gives common people freedom, security, and far more control over their own lives. In my humble opinion, Mama Suluhu is very wise to advise us all to learn and prepare ourselves for this liberating technological revolution.**\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1635423412, "digest": "OfL0HopE5soYRSulSJw_av8y8gWEgmLFytTvLdm8c7Q", "contributor": "0x8d4Ac6b8cE54d59921A14a624193De4FdED632B1"}

Of course, this application will have more far-reaching implications than just the travel industry.\n\n\\*\\*Main Benefits:\n\\*\\*✔️ Reduce the risk of personal identity fraud\n✔️ Facilitate verification of personal identification\n✔️ Provide more security and privacy to travellers sharing their IDs.\n \n **Active projects:**\n\n* [Civic](https://www.civic.com/)\n* [Metadium](https://www.metadium.com/about#rec109090032)\n* [Tykn](https://tykn.tech/)\n\n# Challenges & Roadblocks\n\nSo why are we still not booking hotels and flights through blockchain systems? With any new technology, there is an adoption curve and a lot of heavy lifting required both in building the technology and getting people to use it. For now, here are a few of the many challenges and roadblocks that lie ahead:\n\n**Operability with legacy systems**\n\nThink channel managers, central reservation systems, property management systems, etc. The new protocols and systems will need to integrate with some of these to drive adoption.\n\n**Building out a digital infrastructure**\n\nFor these new systems to work there is a need for simple front-end and back-end interfaces that make it easy to plug and play.\n\n**Adoption from small and medium businesses**\n\nIn general, airlines have a massive scale and are able to invest in these types of new technologies early on. However, real change will come when small-to-medium-sized businesses (independent hotels, museums, etc.) join the new world of travel distribution.\n\n![Project database](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8-E2PT71pdYHq0vtgC8R1.png?height=242&width=1176)\n\n# Blockchain Projects\n\nI have already referred to some current projects that are building blockchain-based solutions for the travel industry, there are more so I created a [database](https://view.monday.com/1420665103-3fb9cfb3a106d979fff5c7edecff7beb?r=use1); to add a project, [click here](https://forms.monday.com/forms/f117c41b49ecac891cb16a6824b02e40?r=use1).\n\nOne of the next newsletters will take a deep dive into one of these projects.\n\n> *Thank you for reading!\n> If you have any questions? ideas? comments?

{"id": "r-fSAsderVOdMYIpx-CKxPf39A388vsEFfVL9JGPjPI", "title": "A brief history of travel distribution", "body": "*Originally published on [world.hey.com/luca.cosivi](https://world.hey.com/luca.cosivi) on June 28 2021.*\n\nIn this newsletter, you'll get to know how travel distribution evolved in two different time periods:\n\n* Thomas Cook and the advent of travel agents (1841-1996)\n* Online Travel Agents (1996-2020)\n\nBut first, let's make something clear, something that this pandemic might have allowed us to forget.\n\n### Humans and travel.\n\nHumans have been travelling for thousands of years and the Covid pandemic is a speck of dust in our 300,000-year history as Homo Sapiens. Nonetheless, the way we travel, and the reasons why, have changed throughout history. Unfortunately, if you try to understand how humans travelled more than 15,000 years ago, you must rely on limited methods: fossils, genetics, and present-day hunter-gatherer communities, for example.\n\nFor most of history, we didn't rely on intermediaries to plan our trips; we just walked, foraged, hunted, and set up camp. Today's world is different, and since modern tourism began, intermediaries big or small have been a game-changer, enabling millions of us to visit places we couldn't have dreamt of before. That brings us to Thomas Cook, the father of tourism.\n\n## Thomas Cook\n\nThomas Cook from Leicester, England, was the founder of the travel agency that bears his name. In the history books, he is credited as the first person to commercialise travel. In 1841, Thomas created the first organised trip and acted as the first travel agent.\n\nThe thrill of travel quickly spread across the English midlands, and improved workers’ conditions enabled more and more people to take part. In 1855, Thomas Cook organised the first continental trip across Europe. The next 150-years were mostly characterised by strong growth and the proliferation of mass tourism across the world.\n\nHowever, in mid-2019 Thomas Cook (the agency) filed for bankruptcy, marking the end of an era. Although in reality, the end of this era started a few decades earlier, when travel agents started to go online. Traditional travel agents started to lose more and more market share to a new breed of company that took the business model online in the late 1990s.\n\n## Online Travel Agents\n\nThe year 1996 was a significant one for the industry, as Booking.com, Expedia and Travelocity all launched that year. Although they were not the first to bring travel products online, they were the first to allow travellers to access them directly (skipping ‘traditional’ travel agents).\n\nAirlines, however, had already started to develop and connect to the Global Distribution System (eAAsy Sabre) since 1986. This \"delay\" of 10-years between airlines being connected to the internet compared to hotels seems to be showing up again in the adoption of Blockchain (more on that in the next newsletter).\n\nDennis Schaal, an Executive Editor at Skift, published an extensive report on the development of online travel \\[2\\]. He divided this history into three parts:\n\n* Pre-online travel agency 1985-1993\n* The key launches 1996-1998\n* Consolidation & evolution 1999 onwards\n\nThis market has been in \"consolidation mode\" for a long time and today the two main players dominate two of the most important regions: Booking.com in Europe and Expedia Inc. in North America. This reflects these two companies’ origins, in Europe and the US respectively, anchoring their market share in these geographies, even though they both operate worldwide.\n\nThe two major changes in the market in the last decade are the start of Google Travel and the growth of Airbnb. However, from a structural point of view, the industry hasn't changed a lot, data and contracts are still highly concentrated in the hands of a few players.\n\nIs it a problem though? for travellers? after all booking a trip is easier than ever before. Well, it doesn't take a genius to understand that many cities have inflated hotel prices due to their high commission rates and rate parity agreements.You can see the similarities with the current [tensions that Apple is facing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/30/apple-eu-law-app-store-iphone-ipad-music-streaming) on its high commission fees in the app store. However, the difference is that using an iPhone is a rather sleek experience, but browsing for accommodations on booking.com is an often frustrating, lengthy and stressful experience for most travellers.\n\nAll due respect should be given to booking.com and Expedia for their contribution to the travel industry, but it is time to innovate and start adding value to travellers and accommodation providers again. I wouldn't be surprised to see them facing the same fate as Thomas Cook did in 2019 in the next decade (more on the \"why\" in the next newsletter).\n\n### Historical Timeline\n\nHere is a simplified timeline of the recent history of online travel.\n\n![online travel historical timeline](https://world.hey.com/luca.cosivi/0a262f8e/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSWlYWkJvPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--10e7f2ba05639335bdc04ad67751c3c766d2ba0d/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--9333ff4f088aa9239bed4b0a224e37f2c7bab42d/online%20travel%20timeline.png?&size=medium)\n\n\\*\\*References\n\\*\\*\\[1\\] <https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/essential-timeline-understanding-evolution-homo-sapiens-180976807/>\n\\[2\\] <https://skift.com/history-of-online-travel/>\n\n\\*\\*Next Newsletter\n\\*\\*I've decided to merge the next two newsletters in one, you'll learn the basics of blockchain technology (plain English) and the implications it will have on the online travel industry.\n\nMy [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lucarioams) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucacosivi/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/lucarioams)", "timestamp": 1635425822, "digest": "HgadSjltR2HkWC4iAhKu79kB2y7oN6gR-7NxJ6iJAGM", "contributor": "0x0e65396AFcF37C2743BFE3A6771c3345028A2c6c"}

{"id": "HWunMzfQx5Hx3Kv33Pxxqkbh2P5zjugh_RXZIliZO1w", "title": "Winding Tree, a deep dive.", "body": "*Originally published on [world.hey.com/luca.cosivi](https://world.hey.com/luca.cosivi) on October 6, 2021.*\n\nThis deep dive was made possible after a [conversation](https://bit.ly/3iDZHdw) I had with the Head of Product, [Mathieu Tahon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtahon/). Whether this is the first time you have heard of Winding Tree, or you have been following them since 2017, this article covers the basics and what is coming for the company. From now on I will refer to Winding Tree as WT. If you need a refresher on the current applications of blockchain technology and the main problems these aim to solve, you can reach my last newsletter [here](https://world.hey.com/luca.cosivi/blockchain-technology-and-the-online-travel-industry-a1a99bdd).\n\n# Introduction to WT\n\nLaunched in 2017, WT was one of the first projects that aimed to decentralise the world of online travel distribution. It claimed to offer a viable alternative for travel suppliers, which were using distribution solutions such as Amadeus, Sabre, Booking, or Expedia.\n\nSince I started looking into WT, I’ve taken many different steps to try to understand what they are up to; reading their White Paper, blogs, articles, joining their Telegram chat, looking into developer documentation and GitHub repositories, all things I highly recommend you do (links at the end). However, if you are new to the world of blockchain technology and online travel marketplaces, I believe that the best way to understand it is to look at the products that make this decentralised travel distribution possible. \n\nBut before I give you a breakdown of each of these, let me explain the underlying technology the WT team has leveraged to build their ecosystem.\n\n# Smart Contracts\n\nIf this is the first time you have read the term ‘smart contracts’, get ready for a short explanation. In one of my [last newsletters](https://world.hey.com/luca.cosivi/blockchain-technology-and-the-online-travel-industry-a1a99bdd), I gave a very brief explanation about what blockchain technology is, and explained that today the use cases have expanded well beyond digital currency. This is mainly thanks to smart contracts, a term initially coined by Nick Szabo in 1994 (some suspect he might be Satoshi Nakamoto). However, the term was popularised by Vitalik Buterin with the creation of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) (today the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation). \n\nNick Szabo defined a smart contract in 1994 as [“a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract”](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html). That definition still stands today, but it has been expanded and brought to life thanks to the [original Ethereum White Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/blob/old-before-deleting-all-files-go-to-wiki-wiki-instead/old-whitepaper-for-historical-reference.md) published by Vitalik Buterin in 2013. Thanks to its open-source nature, Ethereum has allowed developers to create decentralised applications ([dApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) with a very high amount of flexibility. \n\nHere is an example, let’s take traditional supply chains, which still require a high number of approvals and due diligence to reduce risk or fraud when making deliveries or payments. Now, we can create smart contracts that executes:  \n \n\n> if x amount of flour is delivered \n then pay the supplier x amount per kilo. \n\n \n It seems simple, however, this entire process often requires more than a smart contract - and some will often call them dumb contracts. This is because for most smart contracts you still need a connection to the real world. That is where oracles come in; oracles are a third-party service that provide smart contracts with external information, serving as bridges between blockchains and the outside world. In the example I gave above that could be the data from the scale weighing the flour (click [here](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/blockchain-oracles-explained) for more information on oracles).\n\nAnother popular oversimplification to understand the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is to think of Bitcoin as a calculator and Ethereum as a smartphone. \n\nIf you want to learn more about smart contracts I’d recommend reading [Nick Szabo’s article](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html) from 1994, the [Ethereum White Paper, ](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)or you can start by watching [this explainer video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp). \n\n**So how does WT leverage smart contracts?**\n\nWT uses the Ethereum network to create permissionless access to its marketplace. However, as most projects built on top of Ethereum do, WT created and issued their own native token and side-applications, which provided the functionalities needed to run an online travel marketplace. The token is called Lif and fuels the ecosystem by verifying all the transactions that happen in the marketplace. So, to be part of the marketplace and expose inventory, suppliers need to have a Lif stake. WT is currently writing a second white paper, and I suspect that it will contain some key updates about the functionalities and purpose of the Lif token within the ecosystem. \n\nSmart contracts are not created every time a booking happens on the platform; that would not even be possible with the current capabilities of the Ethereum network in terms of transaction speeds and costs. The only time a smart contract transaction is created is when an organisation becomes a verified member of the marketplace, which is why to become a member you must pay a transaction fee in ETH, Ethereum’s token. However, users will then send transactions to the smart contract to modify the state of the blockchain.\n\n# Winding Tree Ecosystem\n\nHere is an overview of the products that make the WT ecosystem a viable alternative to current OTAs and GDS. \n\n**The Marketplace**\n\nThis is the heart of the WT ecosystem and the first “product” that was built by the team. It enables people to join the network and start exposing their inventories. The team has worked towards removing the barriers to joining the marketplace by making it a simple process. However, there are still steps that involve using a cryptocurrency wallet (such as [Meta Mask](https://metamask.io/)) After you have been registered on the marketplace you can start adding your [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) endpoint (which enables you to expose inventory and receive bookings). It might not be as simple as signing up on [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) or Expedia, but I believe that WT will eventually get there, which will be key to driving adoption.\n\nThe marketplace already has a few pages of registered institutions, including travel agents, booking platforms and hotels. What is less clear is whether companies such as Lufthansa, KLM and Etihad are actively using the marketplace, despite announcements of their adoption in recent years.\n\n### Glider\n\nGlider is a set of two products, which act as real-life examples of ways to use the WT protocol to sell or buy travel products. \n\n**glider.travel**\n\nBy clicking on [glider.travel](https://glider.travel/hotels) you can see a simple example of an OTA built by the WT team. I believe the goal was to give an example of an OTA and empower people to get started and build OTAs on top of WT. You can also technically copy the open-source code [here](https://github.com/windingtree/glider-ota) and start your own OTA on top of WT. However, it is not as simple as building a website on a no-code platform as many integrations and developments are still needed, especially on the back-end. \n\nI wonder if any successful projects have been able to fully build an OTA on top of WT? Having been involved in a similar project at the start of this year it was not as easy as it seemed. However, the WT team was very helpful and provided our team with a lot of guidance. I hope that in their upcoming plans to increase the adoption of WT, more development is done on the Glider OTA to make it easier to use the WT protocol. This will be especially important when it comes to building the back-end infrastructure needed to connect inventories and the content from hotels and airlines. \n\n**Glider aggregator**\n\nThe Glider Aggregator is a back-end service that forwards the booking requests received from the WT marketplace to airlines and hotels. Again, the [code](https://github.com/windingtree/glider-aggregator) is open-source and offers [documentation](https://production.b2b.glider.travel/api/docs/) on how to make requests to the marketplace. Nevertheless, the same problem remains that non-tech-savvy travel agents won’t necessarily understand how to start buying inventory. Most importantly there needs to be a large amount of inventory to attract users to start using this channel. \n\n**Rooms**\n\n[Rooms](https://rooms.windingtree.com/) is a more recent and very exciting product built by WT, which offers a lightweight solution for suppliers that don’t necessarily use APIs, a CRS, or a PMS. Any supplier can log into Rooms, add their available inventory with a friendly interface and start accepting bookings throughout the WT marketplace. Again, [the code](https://github.com/windingtree/rooms) is open source for anyone to contribute or use. \n\nI believe this will be a key product to drive adoption with smaller suppliers, who frequently end up paying the highest commission fees as they have less leverage in negotiations with OTAs. Additionally, given that WT Glider Aggregator only integrates with eRevMax, a CRS and PMS for hotels, it is important to allow hotels that work with different PMS or CRS to start connecting to the WT ecosystem while the integrations are developed. On the airline side, WT confirmed that they are integrated with Air Canada.\n\n**ORGid**\n\nLaunched at the start of this year, ORGiD is a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Solution for organisations. It functions as a decentralised business registry that makes it easy to verify someone's identity. The main goal is to increase trust within the network by limiting the possibilities for scams or phishing attempts, which have been on the rise in the blockchain space \\[[source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-investment-scams/)\\]. Even though some community members might wonder why WT focused on creating this solution and not on expanding the adoption of the eco-system, I believe it was a key component to truly make WT a trusted permissionless marketplace. \n\nIf you want to learn more about it you can browse the open-source code [here](https://github.com/windingtree/org.id), and read an in-depth explanation of it [here](https://blog.windingtree.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-org-id-6c1c6172ae55). \n  \n All of these products come together to create a more efficient model for online travel distribution.\n\n![          Simplified distribution flow on Winding Tree](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/II-suh3FADovrMtUfJHG5.png?height=336&width=634)\n\n## Future Outlook\n\nThe WT team has been working on some major updates and solutions to solve some of their problems, such as the lack of adoption or clarity around the project. \n\n**Updated Token**\n\nIn response to many requests from the community to update the original Lif token, a new token was released in September. The new token will enable more compatibility with the growing Ethereum ecosystem, allowing holders to trade it on decentralised exchanges, such as [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), and potentially allow for use cases on layer 2 solutions, such as [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/). All in all, this expands the scope of the Lif token as well as making it a more attractive project. For a full list of details on the new token click [here](https://blog.windingtree.com/lif-token-upgrade-fa07387a7ba7).\n\n**White Paper v2**\n\nThe WT team has started writing a new White Paper. The reason for this is because the [original White Paper](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eb7f4828b5a4f0e027b4c23/t/5ffcacb29c1b726c15c3af9c/1610394808376/White_Paper_EN.pdf), published in 2017, is outdated as most of the goals and aspirations have been achieved. Expect a strong focus on how the team plans to grow adoption, an updated Roadmap and an explanation of the new Lif token. You can check out the new White Paper under construction [here](https://github.com/windingtree/white-paper-v2). \n\n**Simard Oü** \n\nSimard OÜ is a licensed travel agency independent of the WT Foundation and accredited by the IATA. Up until now, it seems to have only been used to accept payments. However, a few weeks ago [simard.io](http://simard.io/) showed up and had a simple countdown clock. After some speculation on the Telegram chat, the countdown ended and the announcement was very vague; check it out for yourself. I received limited information about this, but I can share that it will be a for-profit entity, which will be a key player in driving the adoption of the WT protocol. The goal is for it to mainly offer services to larger companies that want support in integrating with WT. \n\nIn my opinion, this is a very smart strategy, similar to the one taken by the Cardano network, which has formed a trinity of the [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/) (the non-profit legal custodian), [IOG](https://iohk.io/) (the engineering arm) and [Emurgo](https://emurgo.io/) (consulting services). \n\n**Becoming a DAO**\n\nFinally, WT has taken some steps towards becoming a [decentralised autonomous organisation](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) (DAO). An example of this can be seen on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/windingtree.eth), where holders of Lif have been able to have an input on governance by choosing and creating proposals or voting on them.\n\nMy next newsletter will most probably be an in-depth guide to the world of DAOs, so if you are an expert or enthusiast feel free to reach out.\n\n# Relevant Blockchain Projects \n\nWT is unique with regards to its solution of creating a permissionless marketplace for the entire travel industry. However, there are more projects that are implementing blockchain technology in different ways; here are some of them:\n\n* [Travala.com](http://travala.com/): Powered by the Binance smart chain and a partnership with Booking and Expedia\n* [Dtravel](https://www.dtravel.com/): Newly launched platform backed by Travala, aiming to be an Airbnb alternative.\n* [LockTrip](https://locktrip.com/): Ambitious project that started on Ethereum and has now has an in-house blockchain solution\n* [Trips](https://tripscommunity.com/): Community approach built on Ethereum aiming to become an alternative to OTAs\n* [Bistroo](https://bistroo.io/): a competitor to food delivery apps Bistroo has lower fees and puts restaurants, food shops, and their customers back in control. \n\nThere are of course other players such as [Fairbnb](https://fairbnb.coop/) or the [Air France & KLM](https://www.airfranceklm.com/en) group, which have internal projects that aim to implement blockchain technology for different use cases, such as governance. \n\n# Useful Links\n\nIf you want to read my notes and answers from the talk I had with Mathieu click [here](https://bit.ly/3iDZHdw). \n\nHere are some useful links if you want to learn more about WT:\n\n[Website](https://windingtree.com/) \n [Telegram](https://t.me/windingtree) \n [Blog](https://blog.windingtree.com/)  \n [Documentation](https://developers.windingtree.com/) \n [White Paper](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eb7f4828b5a4f0e027b4c23/t/5ffcacb29c1b726c15c3af9c/1610394808376/White_Paper_EN.pdf) \n [GitHub](https://github.com/windingtree) \n [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/windingtree/) \n [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFuemEOhCfenYMoNdjD0Aew)\n\nRelated articles on WT:\n\n<https://www.travel-industry-blog.com/travel-technology/blockchain/#Blockchain_use_case_in_travel_Winding_Tree>\n\n<https://oberhummer.com/winding-tree-bitcoin-travel-might-flawed/#sthash.Yx1SfvL0.dpbs> \n \n\n> *Thank you for reading! \n If you have any questions?

{"id": "oHLykZbqsFCYKjrPbXTpVxTMxvEc0zip5iowXfqfhHs", "title": "Online Travel Distribution - a decade from now.", "body": "*Originally published on [world.hey.com/luca.cosivi](https://world.hey.com/luca.cosivi) on October 7, 2021.*\n\nYesterday, I posted a [new newsletter](https://bit.ly/2YrN1PK) that took a deep dive into Winding Tree. I read it again and felt I should add a short personal take on what the future of online travel distribution might look like, let's say 10-years from now.\n\nI believe that there are two possible futures for the world of online travel distribution, one where companies like Booking, Expedia, Amadeus, Sabre are pretty much non-existent and one where they still dominate.\n\n# Scenario A\n\nIn the next 5 to 10 years, Airlines will slowly move towards driving more direct bookings and joining marketplaces like Winding Tree. By the end of this decade, over 80% of their bookings will be coming through distribution channels that are at least half as expensive as GDSs (currently at around 10% per booking). \n\nIn 2025, after front-end applications are more user-friendly, integrations with major PMSs are easy to set up and adoption of blockchain technology is even more mainstream we will see small and big hotels move in the same direction as the airlines did. \n\n# Scenario B\n\nMajor intermediaries go through a deep transformation of their business model and find new ways of generating revenue and growth while adopting blockchain technology-based distribution. \n\nBig internal transformations are not impossible for big corporations, but for now, there aren’t any signals for change from the major OTAs or GDSs.\n\nTake for example [this](https://www.volkskrant.nl/kijkverder/v/2019/oud-werknemers-over-booking.com-het-is-een-grote-chaos/) investigation by a Dutch newspaper on [Booking.com](http://booking.com/), that interviewed more than a dozen employees that raised serious concerns about their tech stack as they still use Perl an outdated and unpopular programming language. So, if an internet company is struggling to hire developers to maintain its platform running It doesn’t seem like they will start to learn and develop a dAAP on [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html) (Ethereum’s programming language) anytime soon.\n\n*If you don’t have access to the article you can check [this](https://www.computable.nl/artikel/nieuws/development/6777910/250449/developers-schetsen-gitzwart-beeld-van-bookingcom.html) one that refers to it.*\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe truth is that both scenarios have intermediaries, the only difference is the power and influence they have on the market. Intermediaries are not bad until they become gatekeepers of innovation and progress. \n\nI believe this to be the case when it comes to OTAs and GDSs, the high number of commissions have squeezed the bottom lines of many hotels and airlines which then gets trickled down to travellers. By giving just 5% back to suppliers (that do not have an oligopoly status) we can expect many of them to put that towards giving more value to customers.\n\nThe reality is that there is a lot of work in either scenario and external factors that will influence the timelines I presented such as [rate parity](https://www.hospitalitynet.org/panel/125000112.html) regulations. \n\n> *Thank you for reading! \n If you have any questions?

{"id": "KV8_W96ptp02TmskEtZc5XKHBQIIogYx1EIJ1_wMd10", "title": "DAOs, a beginner’s guide", "body": "*Originally published on [world.hey.com/luca.cosivi](https://world.hey.com/luca.cosivi) on October 13 2021.*\n\nMy goal with this newsletter is to introduce you to DAOs (decentralised autonomous organisations). I am working on and will eventually publish an ultimate guide, which will go more in-depth into many of these concepts and provide you with many more examples.\n\nWhen I found out about DAOs, I became obsessed. It was like discovering what the organisation of the future will look like. Maybe like the feeling that millennials felt when they entered a Google campus in the early 2000s. The only difference was that there was no campus; it was a bustling discord server with a governance platform, where from day one you get ownership, voting rights and pretty much full transparency on everything going on.\n\n# What is a DAO?\n\nIn essence, a DAO can be any type of organisation; the only difference is that its governance process is programmed into smart contracts and when decisions are made they are recorded into the blockchain. Think of your organisation’s rules, but in code. Most DAOs are highly decentralised to the point where there is no one person that can take major decisions, such as changing the governance process. \n\nThere are no international standards; they vary as to how decentralised or autonomous they are. However, when looking into a DAO you will often find the following characteristics:\n\n* Ability to vote on proposals created by members\n* Holders can purchase or receive governance tokens\n* A governance model that includes the ability to create motions or disputes\n* A high level of transparency when it comes to treasury management or payments\n\nThe first DAO was created in 2016, although the concept had already been introduced earlier in 2013 by Dan Larimer ([here](https://letstalkbitcoin.com/is-bitcoin-overpaying-for-false-security)) and Vitalik Buterin ([here](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i-1379644274)).\n\n# The DAO\n\nThe first DAO was a real-life experiment that ended horribly wrong. \n\nIn 2016, the DAO was created on top of Ethereum, with the aim to function as a venture fund for new projects. Decisions would be made by all members owning tokens, and it raised around $150m (12.7m Ether at the time). This was the first viral moment for DAOs. However, less than two months after going live a hacker managed to exploit part of the code and take away Ether worth US$50m at that time (if you want to know more about how that code was exploited, click [here](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/de/Documents/Innovation/Deloitte_Blockchain_Institute_Whitepaper_The_DAO.pdf).) \n\nThis eventually led to a very controversial decision to hard fork the network; the original “hacked” network is called today [Ethereum Classic](https://ethereumclassic.org/).\n\nThis was not good PR for DAOs and led to many very ambitious projects not getting as much attention as they should. Nevertheless, the community kept working and today there are hundreds of DAOs and dozens of tools that make it easy to create one without even needing blockchain or programming knowledge.\n\n# DAO examples & tools\n\nThe best way to truly understand DAOs today is to become part of one or look at real ones. Not all the examples I give you here have the same principles or levels of decentralisation and automation embedded within how they work; however, for most DAOs it is a step-by-step process to get there.\n\n**DAO examples**\n\n**[Project Catalyst](https://cardanocataly.st/)**\n\nStarted last year, with the aim of becoming a key part of the governance and funding of the [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) network, with a treasury of $1 billion. Funds run every six weeks, when members of the Cardano community can create proposals for new business ideas and are then voted on by [ADA](https://cardano.org/what-is-ada/) token holders. The voting period for Fund 6 is currently happening right now, so if you want to know more about it or even become part of it click [here](https://projectcatalyst.org/resources). \n\n \n There are already tens of thousands of members participating in Catalyst by creating proposals, being community advisors, or voting.\n\n**[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)**\n\nThe largest [decentralised exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange) for the Ethereum network, and the largest DAO by market cap. Since last September, anyone holding the UNI token has been able to vote or delegate their vote on decisions that help the day-to-day operations of the exchange. [Here](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/QmcpJ8Qm9V4LfK5ncpPvGpCEkzt2uV9jahueX2CR9YLGVv) is an example of one of the latest votes.\n\n**[The LAO](https://www.thelao.io/)**\n\nA group of blockchain enthusiasts who want to support the growth of the Ethereum network. The LAO presents itself as the future of venture capital. It has already invested more than $50M and blockchain founders are starting to want to be associated with them due to their ethos. If you want to know more about venture DAOs, you should read [this](https://www.decentralised.co/the-future-of-venture-capital/) article.\n\n**DAO** **Tools** \n\nRunning a DAO is a daunting task; you don’t just have to think about your value proposition for customers from the get-go but must figure out your voting mechanism and internal governance process. To help with that, some tools and tech stacks have been built in the past few years:\n\n**[Llama](https://llama.community/#/)**\n\nA simple tool that helps members of communities visualise crypto treasuries. It is a key implementation tool, which makes it easier for people to understand transactions that are made in a DAO.\n\n**[Colony](https://colony.io/)**\n\nA 360° solution to run a DAO with a very innovative way of decentralising the process of assigning budgets to certain domains of an organisation. However, due to the high Ethereum gas prices you need to wait until their v2 solution running on [xDai](https://www.xdaichain.com/) is launched to create an organisation. \n\n**[Aragon](https://aragon.org/)**\n\nA suite of tools that enables you to run a DAO, with a very user-friendly approach. It recently acquired Vocdoni, a digital voting solution for public and private organisations. This enables people to vote without having a personal crypto wallet, which will be important to drive adoption early on. \n\nThere are many more tools out there, and many will be covered in my forthcoming newsletters. But If you want to dive into the rabbit hole right away you can click [here](https://airtable.com/shrvTvbCA5B0UQ4fL). \n\n# Future\n\nFor now, DAOs are mainly reserved for companies that live mostly on the internet. However, I can’t stop thinking about what the implications will be when the tools and principles used by DAOs go mainstream. I believe it could become a competitive advantage for more traditional companies to implement many of these tools and principles. Imagine a hotel that gave you a small share of ownership and voting power as soon as you become an employee. Many of the governance processes that happen today involving advisory boards, boards of directors, internal committees, and a long list of lawyers and auditors could be scaled up to the entire organisation without harming the quality of governance, but actually improving it.  \n   \n Today, with our current legal and financial frameworks, the situation I describe above wouldn't be feasible for a business owner. \n\nThe future picture isn’t completely rosy, however; there are many issues that DAO founders and tool builders need to solve, such as:\n\n* Lack of voter participation\n* The legal status of the organisation and members\n* Security and privacy, as another hack could be devastating\n\n \n Many of these problems are already being tackled by companies like Aragon or lawmakers and given the convincing picture below, I believe they will be sorted. DAOs are here to stay.  \n \n\n![A DAO vs Traditional Company (Aragon)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dnybLmueq1YZWVdBmaEgm.png?height=1572&width=1520)\n\n> *Thank you for reading! \n If you have any questions?

It generated 4x more volume than V2 with only half the TVL required.\n\nDespite the capital efficiency, why do people still keep their liquidity in V2? With the volume / TVL ratio of 2.79 in V3 and only 0.71 in V2, you should earn at least 3.8 times more if you migrate to V3 right?\n\nWell, the true story is not so simple.\n\n## V3 and Capital Efficiency\n\nTo understand how v3 works, let’s take a look at their unique mechanic: concentrated liquidity.\n\n“In Uniswap v3, LPs can concentrate their capital within custom price ranges, providing greater amounts of liquidity at desired prices. In doing so, LPs construct individualized price curves that reflect their own preferences.\n\nLPs can combine any number of distinct concentrated positions within a single pool. For example, an LP in the ETH/DAI pool may choose to allocate $100 to the price ranges $1,000-$2,000 and an additional $50 to the ranges $1,500-$1,750.”\n\nSource:  <https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/>\n\nMoreover,  “Swap fees are not automatically reinvested as they were in previous versions of Uniswap. Instead, they are collected separately from the pool and must be manually redeemed when the owner wishes to collect their fees.”\n\nSource: <https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/fees>\n\nOn V3 not only do you have to actively monitor and adjust your position to get the best yield, you also have to manually claim the rewards if you want to compound them.

It generated 4x more volume than V2 with only half the TVL required.\n\nDespite the capital efficiency, why do people still keep their liquidity in V2? With the volume / TVL ratio of 2.79 in V3 and only 0.71 in V2, you should earn at least 3.8 times more if you migrate to V3 right?\n\nWell, the true story is not so simple.\n\n## V3 and Capital Efficiency\n\nTo understand how v3 works, let’s take a look at their unique mechanic: concentrated liquidity.\n\n“In Uniswap v3, LPs can concentrate their capital within custom price ranges, providing greater amounts of liquidity at desired prices. In doing so, LPs construct individualized price curves that reflect their own preferences.\n\nLPs can combine any number of distinct concentrated positions within a single pool. For example, an LP in the ETH/DAI pool may choose to allocate $100 to the price ranges $1,000-$2,000 and an additional $50 to the ranges $1,500-$1,750.”\n\nSource:  <https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/>\n\nMoreover,  “Swap fees are not automatically reinvested as they were in previous versions of Uniswap. Instead, they are collected separately from the pool and must be manually redeemed when the owner wishes to collect their fees.”\n\nSource: <https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/fees>\n\nOn V3 not only do you have to actively monitor and adjust your position to get the best yield, you also have to manually claim the rewards if you want to compound them. On v2, the only thing you need to do is deposit your funds into the LP pool.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gb5qXy04qvaUwqW0cM9gb.png?height=1404&width=2296)\n\n*Note: you can use this [Uniswap v3 Fee calculator](https://uniswapv3.flipsidecrypto.com/) to understand more on how different ranges affect your yield on V3.*\n\nThis effectively gives an edge to a small group of people who:\n\n* Have a working strategy and are hedging to battle against the high impermanent loss on concentrated position.\n* Have capital that is large enough to outweigh the high gas fee on each rebalancing position / claiming reward on Ethereum.\n\nIndeed this small group of people will see their capital efficiency increase by 4000x compared to others. \n\n## What happens if I just provide liquidity to Uniswap V3 the same way I would on V2?\n\nTo evaluate the impact of not adjusting your position on V3, let’s use [this Uniswap calculator](https://one-dash-yonas.herokuapp.com/uni_pool/0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8) and look at the USDC / ETH pool with a 0.3% swap fee.\n\n![Source: https://one-dash-yonas.herokuapp.com/uni_pool/0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QuYU6AiniyEXmPlDjEaWq.png?height=115&width=512)\n\nThe widest liquidity concentration in the last 30 days is around 20% - 30% with most of the day being only around 5%.

将我们的思考、感官和操作跟预设好的规则，画面，程序进行交互，\n\n从而完成某个任务，获得成就感和愉悦感。\n\n但直到2年前，\n\n一款叫做《健身环大冒险》的游戏出现， 将运动与游戏程序相结合，\n\n让Switch从相对小众的掌机游戏领域彻底火出了圈。\n\n也让玩家通过付出体力，进行运动锻炼，获得了健康和精神意义上的满足。\n\n健身环的成功恰恰表明，当游戏兼具体育和运动属性时，\n\n它往往能获得更广的用户接受度，并占领除玩家群体之外的蓝海市场。\n\n而我们今天要介绍的这款链游：[dotmoovs](https://dotmoovs.com/)\n\n也正是在主打运动和比拼的元素。\n\n**通证：MOOV**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/r2UU2TkC69QeTGYaVT5dt.png?height=704&width=1366)\n\n## dotmoovs是什么？\n\n### 在你喜欢的运动中挑战任何人\n\ndotmoov给自己的宣传口号是：\n\n**让你在最喜欢的运动中挑战任何人。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4MIm3OftjFqITYGP7eLyr.png?height=1014&width=1730)\n\n也正是由于这个目标，\n\n让dotmoov显得与我们之前介绍的链游完全不同。\n\n传统的链游都是通过游戏策划和产品设计来制造挑战，\n\n而dotmoov则主打运动比赛。\n\n比如颠足球， 系统将根据等级和算法来匹配对手，\n\n并通过图像识别来裁定谁颠球的数量更多，\n\n从而完成发起挑战--运动--结果判定的全过程。\n\n整个流程由一款名为 Dotmoovs的APP承载，\n\n> APP目前可在商城进行下载\n\n其APP使用流程如下：\n\n1-APP中会预置一个钱包功能，在此可以查看用户的MOOV余额，也可以对MOOV进行存取\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yz9wMaTdIaoIGVrlk7MTA.png?height=1280&width=590)\n\n2-选择喜欢的运动，系统根据算法在全球匹配对手（目前仅有花式颠球项目，测试版）进行比赛\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xKIaSIwyJNO03hE1J0kbT.png?height=1280&width=590)\n\n3-决定是否要为这场比赛下注（消耗MOOV）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9r0Lp0U_rXloHBy5_nQaC.png?height=1280&width=590)\n\n4-将手机置于合理距离，倒计时准备后开始进行颠球，AI进行判罚\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M5k_PYIp1eYdeDEYmqsXi.png?height=796&width=1280)\n\n5-根据结果奖励MOOV\n\n同时在上述的挑战中，\n\nAPP将通过手机的摄像头+图像识别算法来判定有效颠球数和是否作弊。\n\n从dotmoov的团队履历来看，\n\n其多数成员都是AI/数据科学/生物学/机器视觉方面的专家，\n\n所以，也许团队在技术方面有所保障。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DxGu8aOa5AD4rnn5K4Hx-.png?height=1172&width=1760)\n\n## 质押Moov，开启体育比赛的新型举办方式\n\n在dotmoovs的设计中，\n\n除了参与比赛的选手外，\n\n任何的品牌方，体育俱乐部，体育组织机购等，\n\n都可以通过质押Moov来举办自己的比赛，\n\n同时自定义比赛的奖励，规则和相关的NFT，并定义NFT的分发方式。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kw6q22qgUmdJlpY3EwXvP.png?height=740&width=1016)\n\n在这个设计中，\n\nMOOV质押行为实际上成为了举办比赛的资质核验，\n\n同时也增强了MOOV的实用性。\n\n以上则为这款游戏的全部内容，\n\n包括产品的核心概念、APP的使用流程以及MOOV的下注和质押作用。\n\n目前dotmoov APP还在测试中，\n\n正式版本还没有明确的时间点，感兴趣的朋友可以在商城中下载相关APP进行体验。\n\n## 两大球星代言，通过活动制造出圈潜力\n\ndotmoovs首先上线的比赛项目是足球，\n\n由于是欧洲团队，\n\n他们也就很自然的请到了两位足球明星来做代言：\n\n退役的葡萄牙传奇巨星路易斯菲戈，\n\n以及现役葡萄牙球员，曾为C罗的国家队队友，夸雷斯马。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HaVL2vq5e-XIiahWRopaM.png?height=900&width=1280)\n\n虽然这两位已不在足球运动的一线，\n\n但他们仍然具备不小的名气，尤其是已退役的菲戈。\n\n他们的代言，\n\n一方面说明项目方具备一定的资金基础，\n\n同时也许项目方也正在努力让这个项目出圈。\n\n也许后续项目方还会请到更多的人气球星，\n\n观察dotmoovs的推特我们可以看到，\n\n目前他们正在进行一项投票\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OQaITkFPaNh3JloeNha5w.png?height=1344&width=1186)\n\n内容是希望看到哪些球星使用dotmoovs app进行颠球对决，\n\n其中小罗纳尔多和内马尔呼声最高。\n\n虽然我们无法得知项目方后续还会找到哪位明星来代言，\n\n但在世界范围内，足球是第一大运动。\n\n而dotmoovs若能达到足球迷皆知的地步，\n\n他的潜力也许就会随之爆发。\n\n## 运动版的PalytoEarn，也许天花板不会很高\n\n### 运动场景受限，以及结果的公平性难以保证\n\ndotmoovs的需求和使用场景大概率是存在的。\n\n但是其场景能不能得到延伸，需求到底有多大，\n\n是我们需要关注的问题。\n\n> 将一个手机架起来，\n>\n> 录制一段视频，\n>\n> 并由AI计算最终得分，\n>\n> 最终判定奖励情况。\n\n在整个链路中，\n\n也许当你发现，你需要先把手机架起来才能录制视频的时候，\n\n可能已经开始觉得麻烦。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Uhkcb7P2emei3MBfsV53t.png?height=1190&width=1950)\n\n同时，如果你在运动过程中恰好到了摄像头之外，\n\n最终的得分应该如何保证公平性。\n\n以上的场景，\n\n都可能是dotmoovs需要去解决的问题。\n\n### 虽然竞争对手较少，但其资源都更雄厚\n\n在运动领域，\n\n除了我们常说的Chiliz之外，\n\n近期Binance也与Lazio展开了合作。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1HChHU-jmZPO4fDvpvlzk.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\n虽然以上两者，\n\n都还没有开发跟dotmoovs直接竞争的产品，\n\n但两者在资源上的优势，\n\n也许是我们不得不去考虑的问题。\n\n谁是这个赛道的最终龙头，\n\n现在还无法得知。\n\n但能感受到的是， 这个赛道已经有越来越多的项目在布局。\n\n当更多人通过dotmoov类似的app进行比赛和运动时，\n\n其实也是通证激励和NFT奖励，\n\n在运动健身这个领域的逐渐落地。\n\n除了激励问题外，更重要的还有认知问题。\n\n更多这类项目的出现，\n\n将更有可能打开圈外人对区块链相关概念的认知。\n\n而当认知逐渐觉醒时，\n\n你，准备好起跑和运动起来了吗？\n\n>

In their oneiric pursuit, they come across Morpheans, sentient beings who gradually became independent from the  consciousness of dreamers, and emerged as natives to 0nir0, the dreams that  would prevail if all dreamers were gone.**\n\n**0nir0 is currently live as an NFT project.**\n\n**More details: <https://jaen.art/0nir0>**\n\n**Discord: <https://discord.gg/D7A923QCqr>**\n\n**September 2021**\n\n## 🌜\n\nThe Dreamer woke up in a dream - in an open space, devoid of any place to feel the comfortable and warm embrace of the dark. Soon, a strange bazaar grew up from nowhere, and people started to flock in wildly. The noise seemed to reverberate from everywhere, and no words could be understood. The colours of the scene unapologetically lived their own life, going from dull greys to a crazy chromatic cocktail in waves.\n\nA three-eyed, cat-like creature started to shed its hair, losing its colours along with it. Then, everything became more crowded, blurry, grey, and the undefined echoes filled up the space until there was no room left for any sense.\n\nThe Dreamer slimed away from this bloated landscape, finally reaching a small forest. With a sigh of relief, they slowly walked up to a moss-covered tree trunk, which was going through a tranquil chromatic tide of anthracite and purple hues. They sat on it, and found a white and shiny artefact laying on the ground. A wolf-shaped mask.\n\nIt wasn’t so much of a mask, though, but rather something like an organ, a face that had been lost ages ago. The Dreamer lost sight of it as they became one.\n\n🌜 You cannot own what you are 🌜\n\nThey remembered something intimate, a peculiar taste, a hunger for a comfortable solitude and an adventurous independance. This soothing reunion with bits of oneself came with a rather bizarre aftertaste: if reality was a candle, the flame had just vanished.\n\nThe Lone Wolf decided to take some time alone, to breathe and heal the heart. The moss on the trunk was growing bigger and smaller with every breath. Soon, the whole forest was quietly, subtly expanding and shrinking in unison, appearing significantly deeper than before. Further away, a warm yet shaky light painted an orange glow on the trees. Intrigued, the Lone Wolf cautiously and silently walked towards its source.\n\n> ***Extract from the Lone Wolf’s dream diary -***\n> *Things here feel foreign yet familiar. Having not been here before, the thickets surrounding me provide a strange comfort. I feel one with them here. There is a sense of belonging similar to meeting an acquaintance again after eons. With each step I take, the forest knows where I must go, and lays the path ahead of me. Why do I feel a pull towards this flickering light? My guts start to feel heavy. There is a level of anxiousness which grows as I get closer to the light, yet like a moth I can’t fight the urge to keep on walking. I stop for a moment to take a deep breath and the forest shimmers around me in unison. My mind feels clear even in this uncertainty, and even before I’m ready to walk, the path reveals itself clearer than before. I know I must keep on walking, and so I walk.*\n\n## 🌲🌲🌲\n\nAfter walking a long time, the Lone Wolf realised that while getting closer to the warm light, it was at a speed that grew slower and slower, to the point they began to question whether they would eventually reach it. Maybe the speed wasn’t the problem. Were time and space silently conspiring against the reunion?\n\nFinally acknowledging the failure in progress, a bittersweet realisation came: the warm embrace might never come, but there was something to be found in the walk towards it. The hunger for it, the burning longing. It wasn’t the destination, and it wasn’t the journey either.\n\n🔥 The Lone Wolf was the orange light waiting to happen 🔥\n\nThey continued bathing in the paradox for a while, excited by the hunt, facing the dreadful abyss of never coming to a close.\n\nOnce both flavours seemed to have settled in their heart, the fiery hues vanished suddenly, in a whimper. Or rather, they seemed to be subtly infusing the whole forest, now.\n\nLooking back, the black-hooded dreamer found a stone well painted in blue to the left, and a red swing to the right. Both had a smokey petrichor scent.\n\n> *Self-acceptance. This feeling, it feels new. I’m going to be ok, no matter what happens. I know I will be ok. I could try to run from my anxiousness and distract myself enough to forget about it for a little while, but I know that this nagging feeling isn’t going to go away. It has power over me until I keep avoiding it. When I’m not facing it, it’s gaining a grip on me. The forest around me seems calmer, less erratic on my realization. I gave it power, and now I no longer want to give it power. No matter what I do, no matter what decisions I make, no matter what circumstances arise or where I find myself, I am going to be ok. Why miss futures that have yet to happen, when I can enjoy the now. From this thought, my surroundings seem brighter and I see that I’m the epicentre of this. I am fine. Breathe. I slowly take it all in and breathe out. I see a well in front of me, and I realise that I don’t know what I look like. I haven’t seen myself yet. As such, I head towards the well with new found excitement.*\n\nThe well was empty. It was quite shallow, though, and one could clearly see its bottom. There were two wolves standing there, staring back at the dreamer. A young red wolf, fiercely playing with a calmer and older blue wolf. They slowly turned around the circular well, and they eventually morphed into water, which rose until the well was filled. On the surface of the liquid mirror, the dreamer discovered a white wolf mask - a blue eye and a red eye that couldn’t seem to decide on which side of the face to dwell, a black snout, and a small round black circle on the forehead.\n\n![https://knownorigin.io/gallery/349250-0nir0-the-lone-wolf](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PjECuIpn4UBLjS9XUrUBo.gif?height=600&width=600)\n\nThe Lone Wolf slowly took the mask out, only to discover the same mask behind it. For now, they felt like a binary glass ceiling had been reached in terms of knowing themselves. Excited and scared, they acknowledged they couldn’t go further alone. That sweet, familiar solitude would have to be put away as it was time to find someone else. As they gazed mindlessly at the surface of the water, they suddenly realised they were underwater. A softly glowing landscape full of ancient ruins, gigantic seaweeds, at the bottom of the Sea.\n\n## 🌊\n\n> *Being underwater brings along a calmness that is hard to describe. I’m free to go wherever I want to, do what I want to or move as much as I want to. There is a gentle reminder of resistance, a small price to pay for moving. You get used to it but it’s always there. A gentle reminder forever looming. I move through the underwater forest, brushing past the seaweed with every stroke, and it seems to be getting thicker the deeper I go. I keep pushing along until I see a clearing when I finally reach the ruins.*\n\nIn the ruins, the physics of water did not apply anymore, which felt even stranger when the Lone Wolf realised there’s no air bubble to be seen. It was like the surface, albeit with a submarine light. The stone walls turned out to form a labyrinth, inhabited by huge glowing sea slugs, paying absolutely no attention to the Dreamer. The black-hooded oneironaut walked for a while, taking turns randomly, until they found a red-hooded silhouette, pulling the antennae of a sea slug. His face was a mask, just like them, but made of pointy shapes and a large evil grin.\n\n«Who are you?» cautiously asked the Lone Wolf. «Who gives a fuck?» answered the red-hooded man. «The Chief of Mischief feels about right, so you can call me that.»\n\n![https://knownorigin.io/gallery/2267000-0nir0-the-chief-of-mischief-5-5](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WW4ol8sFMxlrr3UjvGK53.jpg?height=2160&width=2160)\n\n> *Even though I’ve just met this man, I’ve gotta say, he is pretty fucking rude. Has he earnt this brash attitude through even brasher means? I dunno, maybe but either way this is the first person I’ve seen since the forest, and what a way to meet someone. I’m curious as to why he seems to be pulling antennas of the glowing sea-slugs. Not that the slugs seem to mind, but still quite peculiar regardless. Finally getting my words together as I ask «What are you doing here and why are you pulling antennas of these slugs?»*\n\n\"I live here, duh-\nCan’t you see the house above us?\nI’ve lived here for about... well, I don’t really know - I suppose one loses track of time when they’ve been banished. But enough about that - apparently I’m such an ass that no one from Balterian really wanted to be friends - even though I prefer the term \"mischievous\".\n\nIt seems I can’t help but talk about myself, can I? Well, there are five of us, so it only makes sense - allow me to introduce myself - some call me the Chief of Mischief, but I prefer the name \"Gravitus\" - I live in the house above us, and I have five, errr, wonderful personalities, if you can call it that.\"\n\"Yeah, I’m Gravitus too -\n\"Oh, won’t you shut up? You’re always talking out of turn, Gravitus. Anyways, let’s talk about the slugs\" says the demented red hood before licking the dew from the slug’s eyestalks.\n\"They secrete what’s called \"persona deminish\", it helps me mold all five personalities into one - when the five of us are all tugging at one another, we can be very unpleasant to be around.\n\nWhen we meld, however, that all fades for a while. So I set up shop here - it only makes sense, as I’m trying to figure out how to synthesise their goop - let’s go up, shall we?\"\n\nThen, Gravitus farted.\n\n> *That truly did take a pleasant turn. Gravitus, that’s a name befitting the wearer of the mask, as you can’t help but gravitate towards them. I’m left to wonder which Gravitus was the rude one because seriously, fuck that guy. The one who I just spoke to seems nice though. Thinking about persona deminish a bit more... Have I passed such items which I didn’t know possess peculiar properties? That begs the question, how did Gravitus figure this out? Were they taught, or did they do their own research? How did they even know where to begin? Who else is out there who knows the answers to questions that even Gravitus has? In wondering these questions, I must admit that I am infact the rude one now by not responding to Gravitus’ invitation to their abode. Cautiously optimistic, I accept the invitation and follow their lead.*\n\nThe red and black silhouettes climbed the labyrinth’s wall, helped by a few stones sticking out. As they walked on the narrow walls, the labyrinth felt like a living organism: its paths shifted, its walls subtly expanded and contracted, in an unintelligible symphony of crackles and mineral tones. The Lone Wolf focused on their feet to avoid falling down, until they reached a narrow staircase.\n\nThe Chief of Mischief looked back, with his immutable sharp grin, and warned the Dreamer: «we’re going up, but we’re also kinda going down.» Then, with a high-pitched voice sounding like a rusty blue tit «It’s on, I’m fucking down!».\n\nAs the Lone Wolf climbed up the stairs, they ended up moving down. The more they went up, the more they went down. Soon, their feet were engulfed by the wall, going through it as if it were nothing. Well, a kind of slightly dirty and greasy nothing, if one was honest. They reached a dimly lit, yellow ochre room. With an awkward half-proud half-embarrassed gesture, Gravitus pointed out the strange workshop. «The fucking ‘shop, in case you’d be stupid - şørrý før thi§ rude Ğ - sorry not sorry»... anyway, the Lone Wolf quickly lost interest in the monodialogue going nowhere, punctuated by an occasional belch, as they got lost in the contemplation of the goop synthetising contraption - an absurd collection of glass vessels, in which all sorts of colorful liquids interacted with each other, sometimes the glass itself stretching out. At the end of the chain, a yellow and blue thick liquid looking like it was expanding in other dimensions, hurting the brain and the eyes just looking at it. *Persona deminish*. «Almost done, but there’s something missing that doesn’t allow it to be really real.» Gravitus looked down, almost sad and serious - «Thi§ płace is phøneý anýway.»\n\nHe looked up instantly, grabbed a jar on the side, filled with the authentic slimey substance, and without further notice, threw the goop at the Lone Wolf’s face, yelling «WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON’T NEED PERSONA DEMINISH BUT GO WITH IT ANYWAY?!»\n\nEverything turned black for the black hood.\n\n## 👤\n\nThe black robe of the Lone Wolf was just an empty pile of cloth, now.\n\n“To be honest, we like the lingering nature of being alone any- wait, what’s this?”\nGravitus saw something white and shiny under what was left of the dreamer.\n\n“This is new… No one’s ever left a mask before - but enough about that, let’s add it to our trinket bucket.”\n\nThe weird red-hooded dreamer picked up the wolf mask and threw it in a big rusty bucket, and pondered about the absurdity of it all. Them included.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lgdgsn_QF76-7rgwnImdk.jpg?height=600&width=1223)\n\n[split://0x113ECad698a86031E01BDa19EB4985c94951BE01](split://0x113ECad698a86031E01BDa19EB4985c94951BE01)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635431190, "digest": "MQlHAUGykf81fdLwMnT_KDZNN9g8pVD0ikTz3ych2hU", "contributor": "0x2918cedA641716Fd6BdA3CcF691c3B54D4C87b6e"}

In their oneiric pursuit, they come across Morpheans, sentient beings who gradually became independent from the  consciousness of dreamers, and emerged as natives to 0nir0, the dreams that  would prevail if all dreamers were gone.**\n\n**0nir0 is currently live as an NFT project.**\n\n**More details: <https://jaen.art/0nir0>**\n\n**Discord: <https://discord.gg/D7A923QCqr>**\n\n**September 2021**\n\n## 🌜\n\nThe Dreamer woke up in a dream - in an open space, devoid of any place to feel the comfortable and warm embrace of the dark. Soon, a strange bazaar grew up from nowhere, and people started to flock in wildly. The noise seemed to reverberate from everywhere, and no words could be understood. The colours of the scene unapologetically lived their own life, going from dull greys to a crazy chromatic cocktail in waves.\n\nA three-eyed, cat-like creature started to shed its hair, losing its colours along with it. Then, everything became more crowded, blurry, grey, and the undefined echoes filled up the space until there was no room left for any sense.\n\nThe Dreamer slimed away from this bloated landscape, finally reaching a small forest. With a sigh of relief, they slowly walked up to a moss-covered tree trunk, which was going through a tranquil chromatic tide of anthracite and purple hues. They sat on it, and found a white and shiny artefact laying on the ground. A wolf-shaped mask.\n\nIt wasn’t so much of a mask, though, but rather something like an organ, a face that had been lost ages ago. The Dreamer lost sight of it as they became one.\n\n🌜 You cannot own what you are 🌜\n\nThey remembered something intimate, a peculiar taste, a hunger for a comfortable solitude and an adventurous independance. This soothing reunion with bits of oneself came with a rather bizarre aftertaste: if reality was a candle, the flame had just vanished.\n\nThe Lone Wolf decided to take some time alone, to breathe and heal the heart. The moss on the trunk was growing bigger and smaller with every breath. Soon, the whole forest was quietly, subtly expanding and shrinking in unison, appearing significantly deeper than before. Further away, a warm yet shaky light painted an orange glow on the trees. Intrigued, the Lone Wolf cautiously and silently walked towards its source.\n\n> ***Extract from the Lone Wolf’s dream diary -***\n> *Things here feel foreign yet familiar. Having not been here before, the thickets surrounding me provide a strange comfort. I feel one with them here. There is a sense of belonging similar to meeting an acquaintance again after eons. With each step I take, the forest knows where I must go, and lays the path ahead of me. Why do I feel a pull towards this flickering light? My guts start to feel heavy. There is a level of anxiousness which grows as I get closer to the light, yet like a moth I can’t fight the urge to keep on walking. I stop for a moment to take a deep breath and the forest shimmers around me in unison. My mind feels clear even in this uncertainty, and even before I’m ready to walk, the path reveals itself clearer than before. I know I must keep on walking, and so I walk.*\n\n## 🌲🌲🌲\n\nAfter walking a long time, the Lone Wolf realised that while getting closer to the warm light, it was at a speed that grew slower and slower, to the point they began to question whether they would eventually reach it. Maybe the speed wasn’t the problem. Were time and space silently conspiring against the reunion?\n\nFinally acknowledging the failure in progress, a bittersweet realisation came: the warm embrace might never come, but there was something to be found in the walk towards it. The hunger for it, the burning longing. It wasn’t the destination, and it wasn’t the journey either.\n\n🔥 The Lone Wolf was the orange light waiting to happen 🔥\n\nThey continued bathing in the paradox for a while, excited by the hunt, facing the dreadful abyss of never coming to a close.\n\nOnce both flavours seemed to have settled in their heart, the fiery hues vanished suddenly, in a whimper. Or rather, they seemed to be subtly infusing the whole forest, now.\n\nLooking back, the black-hooded dreamer found a stone well painted in blue to the left, and a red swing to the right. Both had a smokey petrichor scent.\n\n> *Self-acceptance. This feeling, it feels new. I’m going to be ok, no matter what happens. I know I will be ok. I could try to run from my anxiousness and distract myself enough to forget about it for a little while, but I know that this nagging feeling isn’t going to go away. It has power over me until I keep avoiding it. When I’m not facing it, it’s gaining a grip on me. The forest around me seems calmer, less erratic on my realization. I gave it power, and now I no longer want to give it power. No matter what I do, no matter what decisions I make, no matter what circumstances arise or where I find myself, I am going to be ok. Why miss futures that have yet to happen, when I can enjoy the now. From this thought, my surroundings seem brighter and I see that I’m the epicentre of this. I am fine. Breathe. I slowly take it all in and breathe out. I see a well in front of me, and I realise that I don’t know what I look like. I haven’t seen myself yet. As such, I head towards the well with new found excitement.*\n\nThe well was empty. It was quite shallow, though, and one could clearly see its bottom. There were two wolves standing there, staring back at the dreamer. A young red wolf, fiercely playing with a calmer and older blue wolf. They slowly turned around the circular well, and they eventually morphed into water, which rose until the well was filled. On the surface of the liquid mirror, the dreamer discovered a white wolf mask - a blue eye and a red eye that couldn’t seem to decide on which side of the face to dwell, a black snout, and a small round black circle on the forehead.\n\n![https://knownorigin.io/gallery/349250-0nir0-the-lone-wolf](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PjECuIpn4UBLjS9XUrUBo.gif?height=600&width=600)\n\nThe Lone Wolf slowly took the mask out, only to discover the same mask behind it. For now, they felt like a binary glass ceiling had been reached in terms of knowing themselves. Excited and scared, they acknowledged they couldn’t go further alone. That sweet, familiar solitude would have to be put away as it was time to find someone else. As they gazed mindlessly at the surface of the water, they suddenly realised they were underwater. A softly glowing landscape full of ancient ruins, gigantic seaweeds, at the bottom of the Sea.\n\n## 🌊\n\n> *Being underwater brings along a calmness that is hard to describe. I’m free to go wherever I want to, do what I want to or move as much as I want to. There is a gentle reminder of resistance, a small price to pay for moving. You get used to it but it’s always there. A gentle reminder forever looming. I move through the underwater forest, brushing past the seaweed with every stroke, and it seems to be getting thicker the deeper I go. I keep pushing along until I see a clearing when I finally reach the ruins.*\n\nIn the ruins, the physics of water did not apply anymore, which felt even stranger when the Lone Wolf realised there’s no air bubble to be seen. It was like the surface, albeit with a submarine light. The stone walls turned out to form a labyrinth, inhabited by huge glowing sea slugs, paying absolutely no attention to the Dreamer. The black-hooded oneironaut walked for a while, taking turns randomly, until they found a red-hooded silhouette, pulling the antennae of a sea slug. His face was a mask, just like them, but made of pointy shapes and a large evil grin.\n\n«Who are you?» cautiously asked the Lone Wolf. «Who gives a fuck?» answered the red-hooded man. «The Chief of Mischief feels about right, so you can call me that.»\n\n![https://knownorigin.io/gallery/2267000-0nir0-the-chief-of-mischief-5-5](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WW4ol8sFMxlrr3UjvGK53.jpg?height=2160&width=2160)\n\n> *Even though I’ve just met this man, I’ve gotta say, he is pretty fucking rude. Has he earnt this brash attitude through even brasher means? I dunno, maybe but either way this is the first person I’ve seen since the forest, and what a way to meet someone. I’m curious as to why he seems to be pulling antennas of the glowing sea-slugs. Not that the slugs seem to mind, but still quite peculiar regardless. Finally getting my words together as I ask «What are you doing here and why are you pulling antennas of these slugs?»*\n\n\"I live here, duh-\nCan’t you see the house above us?\nI’ve lived here for about... well, I don’t really know - I suppose one loses track of time when they’ve been banished. But enough about that - apparently I’m such an ass that no one from Balterian really wanted to be friends - even though I prefer the term \"mischievous\".\n\nIt seems I can’t help but talk about myself, can I? Well, there are five of us, so it only makes sense - allow me to introduce myself - some call me the Chief of Mischief, but I prefer the name \"Gravitus\" - I live in the house above us, and I have five, errr, wonderful personalities, if you can call it that.\"\n\"Yeah, I’m Gravitus too -\n\"Oh, won’t you shut up? You’re always talking out of turn, Gravitus. Anyways, let’s talk about the slugs\" says the demented red hood before licking the dew from the slug’s eyestalks.\n\"They secrete what’s called \"persona deminish\", it helps me mold all five personalities into one - when the five of us are all tugging at one another, we can be very unpleasant to be around.\n\nWhen we meld, however, that all fades for a while. So I set up shop here - it only makes sense, as I’m trying to figure out how to synthesise their goop - let’s go up, shall we?\"\n\nThen, Gravitus farted.\n\n> *That truly did take a pleasant turn. Gravitus, that’s a name befitting the wearer of the mask, as you can’t help but gravitate towards them. I’m left to wonder which Gravitus was the rude one because seriously, fuck that guy. The one who I just spoke to seems nice though. Thinking about persona deminish a bit more... Have I passed such items which I didn’t know possess peculiar properties? That begs the question, how did Gravitus figure this out? Were they taught, or did they do their own research? How did they even know where to begin? Who else is out there who knows the answers to questions that even Gravitus has? In wondering these questions, I must admit that I am infact the rude one now by not responding to Gravitus’ invitation to their abode. Cautiously optimistic, I accept the invitation and follow their lead.*\n\nThe red and black silhouettes climbed the labyrinth’s wall, helped by a few stones sticking out. As they walked on the narrow walls, the labyrinth felt like a living organism: its paths shifted, its walls subtly expanded and contracted, in an unintelligible symphony of crackles and mineral tones. The Lone Wolf focused on their feet to avoid falling down, until they reached a narrow staircase.\n\nThe Chief of Mischief looked back, with his immutable sharp grin, and warned the Dreamer: «we’re going up, but we’re also kinda going down.» Then, with a high-pitched voice sounding like a rusty blue tit «It’s on, I’m fucking down!».\n\nAs the Lone Wolf climbed up the stairs, they ended up moving down. The more they went up, the more they went down. Soon, their feet were engulfed by the wall, going through it as if it were nothing. Well, a kind of slightly dirty and greasy nothing, if one was honest. They reached a dimly lit, yellow ochre room. With an awkward half-proud half-embarrassed gesture, Gravitus pointed out the strange workshop. «The fucking ‘shop, in case you’d be stupid - şørrý før thi§ rude Ğ - sorry not sorry»... anyway, the Lone Wolf quickly lost interest in the monodialogue going nowhere, punctuated by an occasional belch, as they got lost in the contemplation of the goop synthetising contraption - an absurd collection of glass vessels, in which all sorts of colorful liquids interacted with each other, sometimes the glass itself stretching out. At the end of the chain, a yellow and blue thick liquid looking like it was expanding in other dimensions, hurting the brain and the eyes just looking at it. *Persona deminish*. «Almost done, but there’s something missing that doesn’t allow it to be really real.» Gravitus looked down, almost sad and serious - «Thi§ płace is phøneý anýway.»\n\nHe looked up instantly, grabbed a jar on the side, filled with the authentic slimey substance, and without further notice, threw the goop at the Lone Wolf’s face, yelling «WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON’T NEED PERSONA DEMINISH BUT GO WITH IT ANYWAY?!»\n\nEverything turned black for the black hood.\n\n## 👤\n\nThe black robe of the Lone Wolf was just an empty pile of cloth, now.\n\n“To be honest, we like the lingering nature of being alone any- wait, what’s this?”\nGravitus saw something white and shiny under what was left of the dreamer.\n\n“This is new… No one’s ever left a mask before - but enough about that, let’s add it to our trinket bucket.”\n\nThe weird red-hooded dreamer picked up the wolf mask and threw it in a big rusty bucket, and pondered about the absurdity of it all.

As a result, most land, and its accompanying natural resources, are often utilized by a singular party, to the detriment of everyone else. We see this in resource management, NIMBY debates, empty condos, etc.\n\nWhile the modern view is a giant leap above the even more exclusionary practices of the past, where only nobles could own land, it is still a system that needs evolution.\n\nLand especially is a natural resource inherent to the Earth and her children.\n\nOur current diction of “landlords” and “tenants” are subtle social programming reminding us of feudalistic systems that we need to ascend from.\n\n### Pathology\n\nThe unhealthiness of the system is an attribute of the growing wealth divide happening, at the very least, in the United States between those who own and those who do not. Such social problems affect us all. Human society is an integrated and interdependent system - where the rich in countries with large wealth divides tend to not live as long as the rich in countries with a more equitable distribution of wealth.\n\nIt is our duty as builders in Web3 to create new positive sum systems around ownership. We’ve seen it bleed through to ownership over software platforms, but for us to manifest the full impact of this new paradigm, we need to touch Layer 0 - the physical world. We can create better economic games for both landowners and tenants that create integrated success for all.\n\n# How\n\n### Tools\n\nEthereum enables the digitization of assets.\n\nOnce digitized, such assets can be integrated into positive-sum economic games that are able to generate far more value for all parties than what is possible in the world prior. For example, liquidity mining is being used to bootstrap financial protocols to become competitive with traditional finance spearheaded by Compound and Yearn. In it, the protocol developers, the users, and liquidity providers all benefit from virtuous economic loops.\n\nLand and housing currently have ever-advancing digital interfaces pioneered by Web2 companies like Zillow and AirBnb, but these assets have stayed rooted in archaic ledgers. Similar to neobanks and the financial ecosystem - real estate technology uses advanced interfaces built on the same self-serving infrastructure of the past.\n\nWe can upgrade the fundamental infrastructure upon which housing is governed.\n\n### MVP\n\nWhat is clear is that for any new economic system that thinks about housing differently - prioritizing accessibility and distributed ownership, we must evolve past the existing infrastructure.\n\nTo begin with, we can play with the smallest unit of ownership - the lease. We can deconstruct the 12-month lease into individual NFTs representing ownership over each of the 12 months.1 NFT representing ownership for January, another for February, and so on.\n\n### Future\n\nIn the future, once housing deeds exist as digital assets on the blockchain, we can fractionalize or tokenize the ownership such that those using or living on the property accrue ownership.\n\nFor example, today someone who rents an apartment for 5+ years ends up accruing 0 ownership in the actual apartment itself. While we have accepted that as an inherent part of the owner <-> user dynamic, what Web3 has taught us is that there is real impact in giving ownership into the hands of people that actively use the platform. Maybe renters should incur some ownership in the apartment they live in and maintain. With some fractionalization or tokenization, streaming ownership to a tenant is totally possible!\n\nLandlords can compete with each other to give away ownership to attract people to live in their space. Effectively making people ape into ownership! Naturally, there is a lot that is being ignored in this high-level theorization - like the advantage to current owners for diluting their ownership. I don’t have very many answers here, but we can imagine some low-hanging financial benefits in decreasing mortgage requirements, transferring debt load, and less operational overhead costs.\n\nIt feels unlikely this will make immediate sense in high-demand areas like NYC or San Francisco, but it may make a world of difference in developing areas like Wyoming. One can imagine a property developer wanting to develop Jacksonhole can utilize ownership incentives to entice remote workers to move in. Live in this complex or buy a house in this neighborhood and be streamed ownership!\n\nNaturally, individuals moving there increase the value of the property, increasing the wealth in the local economy, and creating a virtuous economic cycle. Integrated success through distributed ownership!\n\n# What\n\n### Experiment\n\nEnough theory. What is happening today is that I am turning the months of December, January, and February of my apartment into individual NFTs that people can buy and redeem to stay at my place. My apartment is located in the East Village - super close to Equinox, Whole Foods, Target, Thompkins Square Park, and basically all the cool bars.\n\nIn its current form, it really isn’t much different from a sublease. Maybe I can attach a 10% resale percentage that potentially gives me a monetization on secondary markets for my lease. Eventually, an auction mechanism for my remaining months to improve price discovery.\n\nHowever, the hope is that when digitized, we can discover really cool things to do with it, and we can begin exploring this space.\n\nI encourage everyone reading this who feels trapped in their 12-month lease to [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/7z4TWPhCm6), tokenize their lease, and see what cool shit can happen! We can create a governance token that is distributed to people who tokenize their lease to increase this new apartment market liquidity, and as remuneration for community members that took the risk and got harassed by their landlords.\n\n### Redemption\n\nTo actually redeem the NFT to stay in my place, you’ll need to DM me on Telegram/Twitter/Discord and I’ll still need you to sign a whole sublease thing, unfortunately. Maybe stake like $500 as a security deposit.\n\nI know this is super mega lame, but hey man baby steps. Redeeming may require transferring the NFT to some burn address. Open to feedback on the best mechanism to do this.\n\nOr you can just keep the NFT for vibes as the first example of a housing contract existing on-chain and not redeem!\n\n## What will I do\n\nI’m excited to see what happens when we can actually have NFTs represent legal ownership over things that exist in the real world.\n\nI have no idea what I’ll be doing in the months when people redeem my apartment, I’ll likely just fuck-off somewhere random for that month. If you have an extra room or wanna hang out, DM me!\n\nThis feels like a fun, cool futuristic step. Let’s think as big as we can with NFTs, DeFi, and Web3!\n\n# Props\n\nMega props to James Duncan for being the only one to tell me that this isn’t a fucking stupid idea and for motivating me to create!\n\nShout out to Mr. Clean for providing the initial idea spark and for providing new areas of exploration.\n\n# Relevant Links\n\n[Pictures and Video of my apartment](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F6SGu6orBwXA2GtUIADuXWOl9k7HfYjp?usp=sharing) \\[my room is the master\\].\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/7z4TWPhCm6) for us to coordinate around uploading more housing into Web3.\n\n[Collection on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/holon-housing) to purchase the NFT.", "timestamp": 1635431869, "digest": "13EYhkOirEJNxpJB6PssN-2tLs6R1VRinhWc2mwLlbg", "contributor": "0x421f223e19877D9765Ecd6e8EC4812457229B36A"}

In their oneiric pursuit, they come across Morpheans, sentient beings who gradually became independent from the  consciousness of dreamers, and emerged as natives to 0nir0, the dreams that  would prevail if all dreamers were gone.**\n\n**0nir0 is currently live as an NFT project.**\n\n**More details: <https://jaen.art/0nir0>**\n\n**Discord: <https://discord.gg/D7A923QCqr>**\n\n**September 2021**\n\n## 🌜\n\nThe Dreamer woke up in a dream - in an open space, devoid of any place to feel the comfortable and warm embrace of the dark. Soon, a strange bazaar grew up from nowhere, and people started to flock in wildly. The noise seemed to reverberate from everywhere, and no words could be understood. The colours of the scene unapologetically lived their own life, going from dull greys to a crazy chromatic cocktail in waves.\n\nA three-eyed, cat-like creature started to shed its hair, losing its colours along with it. Then, everything became more crowded, blurry, grey, and the undefined echoes filled up the space until there was no room left for any sense.\n\nThe Dreamer slimed away from this bloated landscape, finally reaching a small forest. With a sigh of relief, they slowly walked up to a moss-covered tree trunk, which was going through a tranquil chromatic tide of anthracite and purple hues. They sat on it, and found a white and shiny artefact laying on the ground. A wolf-shaped mask.\n\nIt wasn’t so much of a mask, though, but rather something like an organ, a face that had been lost ages ago. The Dreamer lost sight of it as they became one.\n\n🌜 You cannot own what you are 🌜\n\nThey remembered something intimate, a peculiar taste, a hunger for a comfortable solitude and an adventurous independance. This soothing reunion with bits of oneself came with a rather bizarre aftertaste: if reality was a candle, the flame had just vanished.\n\nThe Lone Wolf decided to take some time alone, to breathe and heal the heart. The moss on the trunk was growing bigger and smaller with every breath. Soon, the whole forest was quietly, subtly expanding and shrinking in unison, appearing significantly deeper than before. Further away, a warm yet shaky light painted an orange glow on the trees. Intrigued, the Lone Wolf cautiously and silently walked towards its source.\n\n> \\*\\*Extract from the Lone Wolf’s dream diary -\\*\\**Things here feel foreign yet familiar. Having not been here before, the thickets surrounding me provide a strange comfort. I feel one with them here. There is a sense of belonging similar to meeting an acquaintance again after eons. With each step I take, the forest knows where I must go, and lays the path ahead of me. Why do I feel a pull towards this flickering light? My guts start to feel heavy. There is a level of anxiousness which grows as I get closer to the light, yet like a moth I can’t fight the urge to keep on walking. I stop for a moment to take a deep breath and the forest shimmers around me in unison. My mind feels clear even in this uncertainty, and even before I’m ready to walk, the path reveals itself clearer than before. I know I must keep on walking, and so I walk.*\n\n## 🌲🌲🌲\n\nAfter walking a long time, the Lone Wolf realised that while getting closer to the warm light, it was at a speed that grew slower and slower, to the point they began to question whether they would eventually reach it. Maybe the speed wasn’t the problem. Were time and space silently conspiring against the reunion?\n\nFinally acknowledging the failure in progress, a bittersweet realisation came: the warm embrace might never come, but there was something to be found in the walk towards it. The hunger for it, the burning longing. It wasn’t the destination, and it wasn’t the journey either.\n\n🔥 The Lone Wolf was the orange light waiting to happen 🔥\n\nThey continued bathing in the paradox for a while, excited by the hunt, facing the dreadful abyss of never coming to a close.\n\nOnce both flavours seemed to have settled in their heart, the fiery hues vanished suddenly, in a whimper. Or rather, they seemed to be subtly infusing the whole forest, now.\n\nLooking back, the black-hooded dreamer found a stone well painted in blue to the left, and a red swing to the right. Both had a smokey petrichor scent.\n\n> *Self-acceptance. This feeling, it feels new. I’m going to be ok, no matter what happens. I know I will be ok. I could try to run from my anxiousness and distract myself enough to forget about it for a little while, but I know that this nagging feeling isn’t going to go away. It has power over me until I keep avoiding it. When I’m not facing it, it’s gaining a grip on me. The forest around me seems calmer, less erratic on my realization. I gave it power, and now I no longer want to give it power. No matter what I do, no matter what decisions I make, no matter what circumstances arise or where I find myself, I am going to be ok. Why miss futures that have yet to happen, when I can enjoy the now. From this thought, my surroundings seem brighter and I see that I’m the epicentre of this. I am fine. Breathe. I slowly take it all in and breathe out. I see a well in front of me, and I realise that I don’t know what I look like. I haven’t seen myself yet. As such, I head towards the well with new found excitement.*\n\nThe well was empty. It was quite shallow, though, and one could clearly see its bottom. There were two wolves standing there, staring back at the dreamer. A young red wolf, fiercely playing with a calmer and older blue wolf. They slowly turned around the circular well, and they eventually morphed into water, which rose until the well was filled. On the surface of the liquid mirror, the dreamer discovered a white wolf mask - a blue eye and a red eye that couldn’t seem to decide on which side of the face to dwell, a black snout, and a small round black circle on the forehead.\n\n![https://knownorigin.io/gallery/349250-0nir0-the-lone-wolf](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PjECuIpn4UBLjS9XUrUBo.gif)\n\nThe Lone Wolf slowly took the mask out, only to discover the same mask behind it. For now, they felt like a binary glass ceiling had been reached in terms of knowing themselves. Excited and scared, they acknowledged they couldn’t go further alone. That sweet, familiar solitude would have to be put away as it was time to find someone else. As they gazed mindlessly at the surface of the water, they suddenly realised they were underwater. A softly glowing landscape full of ancient ruins, gigantic seaweeds, at the bottom of the Sea.\n\n## 🌊\n\n> *Being underwater brings along a calmness that is hard to describe. I’m free to go wherever I want to, do what I want to or move as much as I want to. There is a gentle reminder of resistance, a small price to pay for moving. You get used to it but it’s always there. A gentle reminder forever looming. I move through the underwater forest, brushing past the seaweed with every stroke, and it seems to be getting thicker the deeper I go. I keep pushing along until I see a clearing when I finally reach the ruins.*\n\nIn the ruins, the physics of water did not apply anymore, which felt even stranger when the Lone Wolf realised there’s no air bubble to be seen. It was like the surface, albeit with a submarine light. The stone walls turned out to form a labyrinth, inhabited by huge glowing sea slugs, paying absolutely no attention to the Dreamer. The black-hooded oneironaut walked for a while, taking turns randomly, until they found a red-hooded silhouette, pulling the antennae of a sea slug. His face was a mask, just like them, but made of pointy shapes and a large evil grin.\n\n«Who are you?» cautiously asked the Lone Wolf. «Who gives a fuck?» answered the red-hooded man. «The Chief of Mischief feels about right, so you can call me that.»\n\n![https://knownorigin.io/gallery/2267000-0nir0-the-chief-of-mischief-5-5](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FWW4ol8sFMxlrr3UjvGK53.jpg&w=3840&q=90)\n\n> *Even though I’ve just met this man, I’ve gotta say, he is pretty fucking rude. Has he earnt this brash attitude through even brasher means? I dunno, maybe but either way this is the first person I’ve seen since the forest, and what a way to meet someone. I’m curious as to why he seems to be pulling antennas of the glowing sea-slugs. Not that the slugs seem to mind, but still quite peculiar regardless. Finally getting my words together as I ask «What are you doing here and why are you pulling antennas of these slugs?»*\n\n\"I live here, duh! Can’t you see the house above us? I’ve lived here for about... well, I don’t really know - I suppose one loses track of time when they’ve been banished. But enough about that - apparently I’m such an ass that no one from Balterian really wanted to be friends - even though I prefer the term \"mischievous\".\n\nIt seems I can’t help but talk about myself, can I? Well, there are five of us, so it only makes sense - allow me to introduce myself - some call me the Chief of Mischief, but I prefer the name \"Gravitus\" - I live in the house above us, and I have five, errr, wonderful personalities, if you can call it that.\"\n\"Yeah, I’m Gravitus too - \"Oh, won’t you shut up? You’re always talking out of turn, Gravitus. Anyways, let’s talk about the slugs\" says the demented red hood before licking the dew from the slug’s eyestalks.\"They secrete what’s called \"persona deminish\", it helps me mold all five personalities into one - when the five of us are all tugging at one another, we can be very unpleasant to be around.\n\nWhen we meld, however, that all fades for a while. So I set up shop here - it only makes sense, as I’m trying to figure out how to synthesise their goop - let’s go up, shall we?\"\n\nThen, Gravitus farted.\n\n> *That truly did take a pleasant turn. Gravitus, that’s a name befitting the wearer of the mask, as you can’t help but gravitate towards them. I’m left to wonder which Gravitus was the rude one because seriously, fuck that guy. The one who I just spoke to seems nice though. Thinking about persona deminish a bit more... Have I passed such items which I didn’t know possess peculiar properties? That begs the question, how did Gravitus figure this out? Were they taught, or did they do their own research? How did they even know where to begin? Who else is out there who knows the answers to questions that even Gravitus has? In wondering these questions, I must admit that I am infact the rude one now by not responding to Gravitus’ invitation to their abode. Cautiously optimistic, I accept the invitation and follow their lead.*\n\nThe red and black silhouettes climbed the labyrinth’s wall, helped by a few stones sticking out. As they walked on the narrow walls, the labyrinth felt like a living organism: its paths shifted, its walls subtly expanded and contracted, in an unintelligible symphony of crackles and mineral tones. The Lone Wolf focused on their feet to avoid falling down, until they reached a narrow staircase.\n\nThe Chief of Mischief looked back, with his immutable sharp grin, and warned the Dreamer: «we’re going up, but we’re also kinda going down.» Then, with a high-pitched voice sounding like a rusty blue tit «It’s on, I’m fucking down!».\n\nAs the Lone Wolf climbed up the stairs, they ended up moving down. The more they went up, the more they went down. Soon, their feet were engulfed by the wall, going through it as if it were nothing. Well, a kind of slightly dirty and greasy nothing, if one was honest. They reached a dimly lit, yellow ochre room. With an awkward half-proud half-embarrassed gesture, Gravitus pointed out the strange workshop. «The fucking ‘shop, in case you’d be stupid - şørrý før thi§ rude Ğ - sorry not sorry»... anyway, the Lone Wolf quickly lost interest in the monodialogue going nowhere, punctuated by an occasional belch, as they got lost in the contemplation of the goop synthetising contraption - an absurd collection of glass vessels, in which all sorts of colorful liquids interacted with each other, sometimes the glass itself stretching out. At the end of the chain, a yellow and blue thick liquid looking like it was expanding in other dimensions, hurting the brain and the eyes just looking at it. *Persona deminish*. «Almost done, but there’s something missing that doesn’t allow it to be really real.» Gravitus looked down, almost sad and serious - «Thi§ płace is phøneý anýway.»\n\nHe looked up instantly, grabbed a jar on the side, filled with the authentic slimey substance, and without further notice, threw the goop at the Lone Wolf’s face, yelling «WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON’T NEED PERSONA DEMINISH BUT GO WITH IT ANYWAY?!»\n\nEverything turned black for the black hood.\n\n## 👤\n\nThe black robe of the Lone Wolf was just an empty pile of cloth, now.\n\n“To be honest, we like the lingering nature of being alone any- wait, what’s this?”\n\nGravitus saw something white and shiny under what was left of the dreamer.\n\n“This is new… No one’s ever left a mask before - but enough about that, let’s add it to our trinket bucket.”\n\nThe weird red-hooded dreamer picked up the wolf mask and threw it in a big rusty bucket, and pondered about the absurdity of it all. Them included.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FLgdgsn_QF76-7rgwnImdk.jpg&w=3840&q=90)\n\n[split://0x113ECad698a86031E01BDa19EB4985c94951BE01](split://0x113ECad698a86031E01BDa19EB4985c94951BE01)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635432353, "digest": "IktvUc9wP7iBtvwUYsfTvOe3RS6uN8nUSrS8td4w094", "contributor": "0x2918cedA641716Fd6BdA3CcF691c3B54D4C87b6e"}

It’s our way of rewarding students and the community for their contributions. It’s also a way to support BEN and to have a say in BEN’s initiatives through our DAO.\n\nToken liquidity is an important part of any DAO, and we are excited to experiment with rewarding liquidity providers.\n\nThis walkthrough will serve as a guide to begin participating in BEN’s liquidity mining program and what you can expect moving forward. \n\n## Step 1: Make sure you have the xDAI network setup on your MetaMask!\n\n**Here is the link to setting up MetaMask along with how to add the xDAI network to your MetaMask:** \n\n* **[MetaMask Setup ​​](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup)**\n\n**xDAI Network Details:** \n\n* **Network Name: xDai**\n* **New RPC URL: [https://rpc.xdaichain.com/](https://rpc.xdaichain.com)**\n* **Chain ID: 0x64**\n* **Symbol: xDai**\n* **Block Explorer URL: <https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet>**\n\n## Step 2: Head over to Omnibridge.\n\n>  **Pro Tip: Before going to Omnibridge, make sure you’ve swapped your ETH to WETH! We highly recommend doing so thru [matcha.xyz](https://matcha.xyz/markets/1/0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2)**\n\n* Once you’ve obtained some WETH, go to [Omnibridge](https://omni.xdaichain.com/bridge).\n* If this is your first time using Omnibridge, you’ll first need to connect your wallet.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p2iCUf1EzpObiwUknOej_.png?height=852&width=1999)\n\nYou can do so by tapping on the ‘Connect’ button and select which wallet you’re using (we’ll be using MetaMask for this walkthrough). \n\n* Upon selecting which wallet you’re using (e.g. MetaMask), you’ll be navigated to the Omnibridge interface. \n* You’ll notice there are two key section: (1) ‘From’ and (2) ‘To’  \n\nSince we are sending (bridging) our WETH FROM ETH Mainnet over TO the xDAI   network proceed to arrange your set up as presented below: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZzOxpA6BAJdg7u9VHaV1Z.png?height=598&width=1999)\n\n## Step 3: Transfer your WETH to xDAI Chain\n\n* Go ahead and enter the amount of WETH you’d like to transfer under the ‘From’ section. \n\nThe equivalent amount will populate under the xDAI Chain (‘To) section. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tfBa5VZQocTY-70-6JwNL.png?height=720&width=1999)\n\n* **In order to proceed with the transfer, you’ll first need to unlock your WETH by tapping/clicking on ‘Unlock’.** \n* **Lastly, once the ‘Unlock’ transaction is confirmed, you can continue the transfer process by tapping/clicking ‘Transfer’.**\n\n## Step 4: Get some BENcoin. \n\n* After receiving your WETH, head over to [Swapr](https://swapr.eth.link/#/swap?chainId=100). \n\nIf you’re familiar with the Uniswap interface, you’ll notice that Swapr offers a near-identical approach.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9nPa2_Hqrbcp5WptfJe1l.png?height=964&width=1999)\n\n* In order to participate in the BEN’s liquidity mining program, you’ll first need to get some BENcoin to start. \n\nLuckily, you’ve already transferred some WETH! As you would on Uniswap, in the ‘From’ section, tap on the drop down menu and select WETH as the asset you’d like to exchange for BEN. \n\nUnder the ‘To’ section, you may have a hard time searching for $BEN since it is not a whitelisted asset on Swapr’s token list.  \n  \n As an alternative, proceed to copy & paste the token’s contract address into the search bar.  \n  \n BEN contract address: 0x33198acCA4b0EB6d9134eC8639c1C142102A07b7\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Iq2gqK-_CZRzqs5OABpot.png?height=1028&width=1042)\n\n* **After you’ve selected both assets, enter the amount of WETH you’d like to swap for BEN** \n\n> > 2 Reminders: \n>\n> 1. In order to provide liquidity to the BEN/WETH pair you’ll need a 50:50 ratio of both assets. \n> 2. Similar to how we use ETH to pay gas fees on the Ethereum Mainnet, xDAI is the primary asset used to pay for gas fees on the xDAI Network.

{"id": "yfphigmlaYPeNxQdZqVA-7SY20DTnmy8i2_V75ndHDE", "title": "OurNetwork Learn: Web3's Learn-to-Earn Data Cohort Program", "body": "*Applications are now closed, please follow along in the public materials link (coming out November 1st, 2021).*\n\nOurNetwork contributors and the Dune team are partnering up to bring to fruition Web3's first learn-to-earn data program. We'll spend 30 days teaching a cohort of 30 students how to analyze data in Web3 and communicate their work publicly.\n\nThe program uses an application system, so there's no buying your way into this cohort. Even if you don't make it into the cohort, all material will be released publicly on Mirror for anyone to follow along with. We'll go into the specifics soon, but first...\n\n**Let's break down this program more intentionally:**\n\n* **Why 30 days and 30 students:** We decided to build upon the [30for30](https://www.ship30for30.com/) cohort model, which really grabbed our attention. It's a small enough group that the teachers can really form a bond with and help each student. We'll probably play with this number more in future programs. I don't think I need to tell you that learning any new skill is about consistency, and doing something for 30 days straight is a great starting point.\n* **Learn-to-earn is a novel mechanism for students:** This is something we're all really excited about. Our program will be free to take part in, with a one-week open application process. Students who are accepted will get an NFT that gives them access to all parts of the course. There will also be ETH bounties that scale up each week, which will exist to motivate course completion and reward stellar efforts. All ETH will come from our sponsors, detailed later on below.\n* **Communicating publicly is about learning, integrity, and community ethos:** Web3 is all about learning and presenting in public. Whether that is on Twitter, Discord, Discourse, or some other platform, it doesn't matter - as long as you are connecting with the community directly. Sharing your work will force you to communicate more clearly in your data visualizations and story, and also force a much higher standard of learning and integrity - you can't just gloss over the details anymore. You're going to be wrong many times, but you'll be much better off afterward (with new friends by your side now too).\n* **It's time to flip the switch for teachers:** I'm a firm believer that I am where I am today because of the astounding and compassionate teachers that have supported me in my past. There's always some intermediary that ends up taking the credit (like a school name), making it hard to attribute students' success back to their teachers. On top of that, teachers also end up with a low financial compensation to effort ratio. In this program, everything occurs on-chain, so there will forever be a link between the content, students, and teachers. And while I won't reveal any other details now, you can begin to imagine how involving DAO tokens in this program could give teachers more upside and attribution through their students' future successes (and vice versa).\n\nI hope you're as excited about this as we all are. It's time to dive into the details and people behind this program👇🏽\n\n## Course Syllabus\n\nThe course will be staffed by six OurNetwork contributors alongside two Dune team members, shown below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/adVsx8MblkZ3d2qO6ivfM.png?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n**As mentioned, the course will be taught over a 30 day period, starting on October 25th and ending on November 24th.**\n\nAll content will be released publicly with one week delays as Mirror entry editions (NFTs). For each lecture, if you collect the corresponding edition then you'll get access to extra content on [glass.xyz](http://glass.xyz). *If you collect all 8 lecture NFTs, there may or may not be some special reward for you.* 😉 All proceeds from collecting those entries will go directly to the teachers through the use of splits.\n\nThere will be 2 lectures a week, with focus groups an hour a day to work through queries and dashboards. We may adjust this if the pace is too fast/difficult for everyone.\n\n**Week one:** Learning to become an Etherscan detective, *no using premade tables yet!*\n\n* **Lecture 1:** Looking at basic call and event data on Ethereum L1.\n  * navigation on Dune, and how to do basic SELECT queries on data tables.\n* **Lecture 2:** Creating basic statistics for L2 data and bridges potentially.\n  * how to do aggregate, group by, and CTE queries\n\n**Week two:** Making sense of smart contracts, *specifically learning to work with composability!*\n\n* **Lecture 3:** Decoding smart contracts into data tables and working with data from multiple events\n  * How to do basic joins and unions, and using Dune Decode\n  * Using tables `prices.usd` to get to more informed data tracking.\n* **Lecture 4:** Querying across DeFi and DAOs\n  * More advanced joins, and windows/partitions.\n  * Introduce `dex.trades`.\n\n**Week three:** Putting it all together, *to become an open-source query Dune Wizard!*\n\n* **Lecture 5:** Creating complex but reusable queries.\n  * How to create User Generated Views and Materialized views\n* **Lecture 6:** Working with NFTs\n  * Working with `nft.trades` and NFTs more generally\n\n**Week four:** Dashboards and Storytelling, *really connect with the community behind the data!*\n\n* **Lecture 7:** Telling stories with your charts, formatting well\n* **Lecture 8:** All about using parameters for really custom and flexible dashboards.\n\n## Protocol Sponsorships\n\nA data course is nothing without good data. We could have chosen the protocol datasets arbitrarily, but we wanted to build a deeper relationship between students and protocol teams. As such, we have created protocol sponsorships with some of the top teams on Ethereum that have shown a strong history of data analytics and storytelling.\n\nThese protocols will be the primary focus for all course content and work published by students. They will appear on all course material as well, and have special access in our discord to work with students. All the ETH from sponsors will go directly to bounties for students - none of it goes to the teachers, Dune, or OurNetwork.\n\nWe have 1 ETH commitments from three protocol sponsors who we're super excited to work with:\n\n1. **Rabbithole**: RabbitHole is the place to learn and earn crypto while discovering the latest crypto applications\n2. **Genie Swap**: The First NFT Marketplace Aggregator. Buy and sell multiple NFTs across all major markets in a single transaction.\n3. **Index Coop:** Index Coop creates and maintains the world's best crypto index products.\n\nFor our final sponsor, we're going to do an open auction starting at 0.5 ETH. **Once the first bid is in, the auction will last for three days.** If you want to be a sponsor and have any questions about the program, [feel free to DM me](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297). *Please note you should only bid if you are a protocol on Ethereum Mainnet or Polygon.*\n\n[auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=5647&auctionId=0x18ffb2f94304106bbac87803e5aa2698b872aca1fb90f1058a6ccb6641221d28](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=5647&auctionId=0x18ffb2f94304106bbac87803e5aa2698b872aca1fb90f1058a6ccb6641221d28)\n\n## Student Applications\n\nNow you're probably wondering, how do I get into this program?\n\nWe've created a short application form which you can **[find here](https://form.typeform.com/to/WkL10RU8).** We're not looking for technical experience, we're looking for someone *who is genuinely interested in using data for the good of the Web3 community and comes from a diverse background*. So think of creative ways you can showcase all that, in this form or otherwise!\n\n**We'll be reviewing the applications up until October 20th 6pm EST.** **On October 22nd 10 AM EST we will release the admitted list on Mirror, where students will be able to claim their membership with an NFT.**\n\nBest of luck to you all, we look forward to welcoming our first class very, very soon. ❤️\n\n\\-Andrew Hong", "timestamp": 1635435038, "digest": "7kL5D5wq4tNUzarKj9WEiTzX2OQjf5WOQmuzISzMrDM", "contributor": "0x2Ae8c972fB2E6c00ddED8986E2dc672ED190DA06"}

{"id": "nQe1q9riyFawRBJEV7MvmzgerSdLatsd3d1krK-keXc", "title": "My Take on Mech Master — The Rising NFT PlayToEarn Star", "body": "I’ve always been a fan of Transformers and other popular sci-fi, as well as lately became interested in cryptocurrencies and NFTs, so imagine my surprise when I found out about a game that combines both: Mech Master.\n\nThis new mech game will introduce a mech universe around the defense of Earth from upcoming attacks from the outside worlds. Homo Deus (the future inhabitants of our planet) will need all the help they need, so they will join us, existing inhabitants (Homo Sapiens), to prepare for the darkest of hours and stand as a united front against any and all attackers.\n\nTogether we will build mechas and construct new territories that will be the frontlines of this war. Giant robots protecting Earth in space — what could be better? Actually, it gets even better — you need to build out a team of five mechas, not just one. Just to make everything even more interesting there will also be different tiers of mechas, their equipment, and pilots, five tiers to be exact: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary. The game will also have a recycling mechanism which will allow you to improve the tier by recycling 5/10 items from a lower tier to get to the next.\n\nWell, if you have a look at these Mech Masters, you’ll see that they couldn’t be more badass: <https://twitter.com/i/status/1440243009514213381>\n\nAlso check out this first Mech Master sneak preview: <https://twitter.com/i/status/1437012747707842563>\n\nMech Masters will have 7 races, each with their own equipment and abilities: **Legion, Ravager, Aerial, Alien, Giant, Relic, Shapeshifter.**\n\nIn addition to different races there will also be 8 different Mecha elements that will have additional advantages against each other: **Air, Water, Fire, Ice, Earth, Thunder, Dark, Light**.\n\nAll the Mechas, Pilots, and Moonbases will be represented as NFTs (Mechas and Pilots — ERC-721, Moonbases — ERC-1155).\n\nSo, long story short, this is going to be one awesome game. I can’t wait to get my hands on the mechas and start building out the Moonbase, to be first man on the Moon, at least among all the people I know ;)\n\nImagine to be given the freedom of building out everything the planet would need to protect ourselves against an alien invasion of similar mechas. That’s where you come in — build the territories, develop your bases, gather resources, and, of course, fight other mechas for the survival of manhood (and Mech Tokens).\n\nWhat I like most is that I’ll be even able to earn crypto from it thanks to its PlayToEarn model. So, basically, I can be early to the game launch and build out my bases with giant robots, aaaaand make money in the process. Especially given the fact that it is yet to gain a large userbase, I’m quite sure all the tokens earned in the early days will make me a nice profit in the future. So that’s that — I am getting in on this, so consider this a pledge to Mech Master, the new rising star in the NFT games universe.\n\nJust have a look at the preview on YouTube: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7i3GdidgEY>\n\nAnd if you’re reading this, you’re not that late to the action yet, the game is yet to be released. Even more, you can still get into the IDO, which will happen on October 24th, 2021. More details can be found in the official announcement: <https://mechmaster.medium.com/mech-master-ido-date-changed-as-a-necessary-step-to-move-faster-46c7916840f2>\n\nFor more information about the game I suggest to visit Mech Master homepage: <https://mechmaster.io/#/>\n\nAnd follow their twitter: <https://twitter.com/MechMaster_IO>\n\nFacebook page: <https://www.facebook.com/mechmaster.io>\n\nTelegram group: <https://t.me/MechMaster_Official>\n\n\\#mecha #gunpla #gamefi #mechmaster #nft #NFTgaming #NFTGames #NFTs #NFTCollectibles #NFTMarketplace #PlayToEarn", "timestamp": 1635435782, "digest": "kQJUWTJLi1iWH-WlRQFE8Lyfu6KqXm6RaD5mVWckOiU", "contributor": "0xC7F4cdb175b1885e95B8F49CCBbD3F929Ab7D1BA"}

It is continually created and updated, with articles on new events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. Because everybody can help improve it, Wikipedia has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia. Besides quantity, its contributors work on improving quality, removing or repairing misinformation, and other errors. Over time, articles tend to become more comprehensive and balanced. However, because anyone can click \"edit\" at any time and add content, any article may contain undetected misinformation, errors, or [vandalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism).

Nupedia had an elaborate system of [peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) and required highly qualified contributors, but articles' writing was slow. During 2000, [Jimmy Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales) (founder of Nupedia and co-founder of Bomis), and [Larry Sanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Sanger), whom Wales had employed to work on the encyclopedia project, discussed ways of supplementing Nupedia with a more open, complementary project. Multiple sources suggested that a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) might allow public members to contribute material, and Nupedia's first wiki went online on January 10, 2001.\n\nThere was considerable resistance on the part of Nupedia's editors and reviewers to the idea of associating Nupedia with a website in the Wiki format, so Sanger gave the new project the name \"Wikipedia\" and it was launched on its own domain, wikipedia.com, on January 15 (now called [\"Wikipedia Day\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Day) by some users). The [bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)) and [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)) (in San Diego) were donated by Wales. Other current and past Bomis employees who have worked on the project include [Tim Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Shell), one of the cofounders of Bomis and its current CEO, and programmer Jason Richey.\n\nIn May 2001, a large number of non-English Wikipedias were launched—in [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language), [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language), [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language), [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto), [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language), [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language), [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language), [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language), [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language), [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language), [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language), [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language), and [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language).

Over time, this generally results in an upward trend of quality and a growing consensus over a neutral representation of information.\n\nUsers should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from the start: they may contain false or debatable information. Indeed, many articles start their lives as displaying a single viewpoint; and, after a long process of discussion, debate, and argumentation, they gradually take on a [neutral point of view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV) reached through [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus). For a while, others may become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint that can take some time—months or years perhaps—to achieve better-balanced coverage of their subject. In part, this is because editors often contribute content in which they have a particular interest and do not attempt to make each article they edit comprehensive. However, additional editors eventually expand and contribute to articles and strive to achieve balance and comprehensive coverage. Also, Wikipedia operates several internal resolution processes that can assist when editors disagree on content and approach. Usually, editors eventually reach a consensus on ways to improve the article.\n\nExternal video [\"Using Wikipedia\" with John Green, from Crash Course's Navigating Digital Information series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih4dY9i9JKE), YouTube video\n\nThe *ideal* Wikipedia article is well written, balanced, [neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view), and encyclopedic, containing comprehensive, notable, [verifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability) knowledge. An increasing number of articles reach this standard over time, and many already have. Our best articles are called [Featured Articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles) (and display a small star in the upper right corner of the article), and our second-best tier of articles are designated [Good Articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_Articles). However, this process can take months or years to be achieved through editors' concerted effort. Some articles contain statements that have not yet been fully [cited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CITE). Others will later be augmented with new sections. Some information will be considered by later contributors to be insufficiently founded and, therefore, may be removed.\n\nWhile the overall trend is toward improvement, it is important to use Wikipedia carefully if it is intended to be used as a research source. Individual articles will vary in quality and maturity by their nature. [Guidelines and information pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Researching_with_Wikipedia) are available to help users and researchers do this effectively, as is an article that summarizes third-party studies and assessments of the [reliability of Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_of_Wikipedia).", "timestamp": 1635436323, "digest": "6q1zWGq9fseq_hI0FOLM6XaKn0Wy_pDIu_ZlSBlibDg", "contributor": "0xa443c2A577B31791a49a29CF56c6d4062A4e3809"}
{"id": "XqixlRzObPVnB9ixD1AQ25TG3wQ8UX2a2fdgtDWuOKA", "title": "Strengths, weaknesses, and article quality", "body": "Wikipedia's greatest strengths, weaknesses, and differences arise because it is open to anyone. According to editorial guidelines and policies, it has a large contributor base, and its articles are written by consensus.\n\n* Wikipedia is **open to a large contributor base**, drawing many editors from diverse backgrounds. This allows Wikipedia to reduce regional and cultural bias found in many publications significantly and makes it very difficult for any person or group to [censor and impose bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_censored). A large, diverse editor base also provides access and breadth on subject matter otherwise inaccessible or poorly documented. Many editors contributing at any moment can produce encyclopedic articles and resources covering newsworthy events within hours or days of their occurrence. Like any publication, Wikipedia may reflect the cultural, age, socio-economic, and other biases of its contributors. There is no systematic process to make sure [\"obviously important\" topics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_articles_all_languages_should_have) are written about, so Wikipedia may suffer unexpected oversights and omissions. While *anyone may alter most* articles, in practice, editing will be performed by a certain [demographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic) (younger rather than older, male rather than female, literate, rich enough to afford a computer, et cetera) and may, therefore, show some bias. Some topics may not be covered well, others in great depth.\n* Allowing **anyone to edit** Wikipedia makes it easily vandalized *and* susceptible to unverified information, which requires removal. See [Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism). While blatant vandalism is usually easily spotted and rapidly corrected, Wikipedia is more subject to subtle viewpoint promotion than a typical reference work. However, a bias that would be unchallenged in a traditional reference work is likely to be eventually challenged or considered on Wikipedia. While Wikipedia articles generally attain a good standard after editing, it is important to note that fledgling articles and those monitored less well may be susceptible to vandalism and insertion of false information. Wikipedia's radical openness also means any given article may be, at any given moment, in a bad state, such as in the middle of a large edit or a controversial rewrite. Many contributors do not yet comply fully with key [policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines) or may add information without [citable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CITE) sources. Wikipedia's open approach tremendously increases the chances that any particular factual error or misleading statement will be relatively promptly corrected. Numerous editors at any given time are monitoring [recent changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges) and edit articles on their [watchlists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Watchlist).\n* Wikipedia is **written by open and transparent consensus**—an approach with its pros and cons. Censorship or imposing \"official\" points of view is complicated and usually fails after a time. Eventually, all notable views become fairly described for most articles, and a [neutral point of view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV) reached. In reality, the process of reaching consensus may be long and drawn-out, with articles fluid or changeable for a long time while they find the \"neutral approach\" all sides can agree on. Reaching neutrality is occasionally made harder by [extreme-viewpoint contributors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tendentious_editing). Wikipedia operates a full editorial dispute resolution process that allows time for discussion and resolution in-depth. Still, it also permits disagreements to last for months before poor-quality or biased edits are removed. A common conclusion is that Wikipedia is a valuable resource and provides a good reference point on its subjects.\n* That said, articles and subject areas sometimes suffer from significant omissions, and while misinformation and vandalism are usually corrected quickly, this does not always happen. (See for example [this incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_biography_controversy) in which a person inserted a fake biography linking a prominent journalist to the Kennedy assassinations and Soviet Russia as a joke on a co-worker which went undetected for four months, saying afterward he \"didn't know [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) was used as a serious reference tool.\")\n* Wikipedia is **written largely by amateurs**. Those with expert credentials are given no additional weight. Wikipedia is also not subject to any peer review for scientific, medical, or engineering articles. One advantage of having amateurs write in Wikipedia is that they have more free time on their hands to make rapid changes in response to current events. The wider the general public interest in a topic, the more likely it is to attract contributions from non-specialists.\n\nThe [MediaWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki) software that runs Wikipedia retains a history of all edits and changes. Thus information added to Wikipedia never \"vanishes\" irreversibly. Discussion pages are an important resource on contentious topics. Therefore, serious researchers can often find a wide range of vigorously or thoughtfully advocated viewpoints not present in the consensus article. As with any source, the information should be checked. A 2005 editorial by a [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) writer comments that these debates are probably symptomatic of cultural changes that are happening across all sources of information (including search engines and the media) and may lead to \"a better sense of how to evaluate information sources.\" [\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About#cite_note-3)", "timestamp": 1635436385, "digest": "5lfEok_HKDH7gKoKr5sIalV2LJFqftaPTgywfC-i8ok", "contributor": "0xa443c2A577B31791a49a29CF56c6d4062A4e3809"}

First, it is not limited in space: it can keep growing as fast as people add.\n\nSecond, there are no qualifications required to be able to author its articles. It draws from a vast pool of contributors: the whole world. This, and the first advantage mentioned above, have enabled Wikipedia to become the most comprehensive encyclopedia on Earth.\n\nThird, a paper encyclopedia remains static (stays the same) and falls out of date until its next edition. Wikipedia is more dynamic: You don't have to wait for the next edition to come out (there are no editions), as Wikipedia is published online as it is written online. Articles are made available as is, regardless of what stage of development they are in. *You* can update Wikipedia at any moment. People do so continually [around the clock](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/around_the_clock), thereby helping each other keep abreast of the most recent events everywhere and the latest facts in every subject.\n\nFourth, Wikipedia has a meager \"publishing\" cost for adding or expanding entries, as it is online, with no need to buy paper or ink for distribution. This has allowed it to be made available for free, making it more accessible to everyone. This has also enabled Wikipedia to be independently developed and published in many different languages simultaneously by people literate in each. Of the 290+ different language Wikipedias, 137 of them have 10,000 or more articles.\n\nFifth, Wikipedia has a low environmental impact [in some respects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_paper), since it never needs to be printed. However, computers have their own [environmental cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers_and_the_environment).\n\nSixth, Wikipedia is extra-linear (more than linear). Instead of in-line explanations, Wikipedia incorporates [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) in the form of [wikilinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikilink). Throughout its content is a robust network of links, providing another dimension of knowledge accessibility. The encyclopedia also has correlated to [tables of contents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Outlines) and [indexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Indices), with each entry in them hyperlinked to an article on the topic specified.\n\nSeventh, each Wikipedia article provides an introduction summarizing the more extensive detail of its contents.\n\nEighth, being open to anyone to edit, articles on Wikipedia are subject to additions that might be erroneous or written poorly, which in turn are subject to being corrected or rewritten. It is a community effort, with most people involved helping to improve the work, fixing problems they encounter along the way.

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online\npayments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a\nfinancial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main\nbenefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.\nWe propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.\nThe network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of\nhash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing\nthe proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of\nevents witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As\nlong as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to\nattack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The\nnetwork itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort\nbasis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest\nproof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.\n\n1. Introduction\n   Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as\n   trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for\n   most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.\n   Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot\n   avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the\n   minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,\n   and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must\n   be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.\n   A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties\n   can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments\n   over a communications channel without a trusted party.\n   What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,\n   allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted\n   third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers\n   from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In\n   this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed\n   timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The\n   system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any\n   cooperating group of attacker nodes.\n   1\n2. Transactions\n   We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the\n   next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner\n   and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of\n   ownership.\n   The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend\n   the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every\n   transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to\n   issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent.\n   The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the\n   company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.\n   We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier\n   transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care\n   about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to\n   be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and\n   decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be\n   publicly announced \\[1\\], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the\n   order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the\n   majority of nodes agreed it was the first received.\n3. Timestamp Server\n   The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server works by taking a\n   hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a\n   newspaper or Usenet post \\[2-5\\]. The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the\n   time, obviously, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in\n   its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.\n   2\n   Block\n   Item Item ...\n   Hash\n   Block\n   Item Item ...\n   Hash\n   Transaction\n   Owner 1's\n   Public Key\n   Owner 0's\n   Signature\n   Hash\n   Transaction\n   Owner 2's\n   Public Key\n   Owner 1's\n   Signature\n   Hash\n   Verify\n   Transaction\n   Owner 3's\n   Public Key\n   Owner 2's\n   Signature\n   Hash\n   Verify\n   Owner 2's\n   Private Key\n   Owner 1's\n   Private Key\n   Sign\n   Sign\n   Owner 3's\n   Private Key\n4. Proof-of-Work\n   To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proofof-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash \\[6\\], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.\n   The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the\n   hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number\n   of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.\n   For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the\n   block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU\n   effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed\n   without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block\n   would include redoing all the blocks after it.\n   The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision\n   making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone\n   able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority\n   decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested\n   in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the\n   fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to\n   redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the\n   work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up\n   diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.\n   To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time,\n   the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of\n   blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.\n5. Network\n   The steps to run the network are as follows:\n\n\n1. New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.\n2. Each node collects new transactions into a block.\n3. Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.\n4. When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.\n5. Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.\n6. Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the\n   chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.\n   Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on\n   extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some\n   nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,\n   but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proofof-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other\n   branch will then switch to the longer one.\n   3\n   Block\n   Prev Hash Nonce\n   Tx Tx ...\n   Block\n   Prev Hash Nonce\n   Tx Tx ...\n   New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. As long as they reach\n   many nodes, they will get into a block before long. Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped\n   messages. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and\n   realizes it missed one.\n\n\n1. Incentive\n   By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned\n   by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides\n   a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.\n   The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending\n   resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\n   The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is\n   less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of\n   the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered\n   circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation\n   free.\n   The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to\n   assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it\n   to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to\n   find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than\n   everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.\n2. Reclaiming Disk Space\n   Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before\n   it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,\n   transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree \\[7\\]\\[2\\]\\[5\\], with only the root included in the block's hash.\n   Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do\n   not need to be stored.\n   A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are\n   generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes \\* 6 \\* 24 \\* 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems\n   typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of\n   1\\.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in\n   memory.\n   4\n   Block Block\n   Block Header (Block Hash)\n   Prev Hash Nonce\n   Hash01\n   Hash0 Hash1 Hash2 Hash3\n   Hash23\n   Root Hash\n   Hash01\n   Hash2\n   Tx3\n   Hash23\n   Block Header (Block Hash)\n   Root Hash\n   Transactions Hashed in a Merkle Tree After Pruning Tx0-2 from the Block\n   Prev Hash Nonce\n   Hash3\n   Tx0 Tx1 Tx2 Tx3\n3. Simplified Payment Verification\n   It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep\n   a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying\n   network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch\n   linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for\n   himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,\n   and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.\n   As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more\n   vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify\n   transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated\n   transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to\n   protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid\n   block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to\n   confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to\n   run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.\n4. Combining and Splitting Value\n   Although it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a\n   separate transaction for every cent in a transfer. To allow value to be split and combined,\n   transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs. Normally there will be either a single input\n   from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two\n   outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.\n   It should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those\n   transactions depend on many more, is not a problem here. There is never the need to extract a\n   complete standalone copy of a transaction's history.\n   5\n   Transaction\n   In\n   ...\n   In Out\n   ...\n   Hash01\n   Hash2 Hash3\n   Hash23\n   Block Header\n   Merkle Root\n   Prev Hash Nonce\n   Block Header\n   Merkle Root\n   Prev Hash Nonce\n   Block Header\n   Merkle Root\n   Prev Hash Nonce\n   Merkle Branch for Tx3\n   Longest Proof-of-Work Chain\n   Tx3\n5. Privacy\n   The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the\n   parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly\n   precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in\n   another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending\n   an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is\n   similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of\n   individual trades, the \"tape\", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.\n   As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them\n   from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input\n   transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk\n   is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to\n   the same owner.\n6. Calculations\n   We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest\n   chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such\n   as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are\n   not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block\n   containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back\n   money he recently spent.\n   The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial\n   Random Walk. The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its\n   lead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the\n   gap by -1.\n   The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's\n   Ruin problem. Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an\n   infinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven. We can calculate the probability he ever\n   reaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows \\[8\\]:\n   p = probability an honest node finds the next block\n   q = probability the attacker finds the next block\n   qz = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind\n   qz={\n   1 if p≤q\n   q/ p\n   z\n   if pq}\n   6\n   Identities Transactions Trusted\n   Third Party Counterparty Public\n   Identities Transactions Public\n   New Privacy Model\n   Traditional Privacy Model\n   Given our assumption that p > q, the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks the\n   attacker has to catch up with increases. With the odds against him, if he doesn't make a lucky\n   lunge forward early on, his chances become vanishingly small as he falls further behind.\n   We now consider how long the recipient of a new transaction needs to wait before being\n   sufficiently certain the sender can't change the transaction. We assume the sender is an attacker\n   who wants to make the recipient believe he paid him for a while, then switch it to pay back to\n   himself after some time has passed. The receiver will be alerted when that happens, but the\n   sender hopes it will be too late.\n   The receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before\n   signing. This prevents the sender from preparing a chain of blocks ahead of time by working on\n   it continuously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at\n   that moment. Once the transaction is sent, the dishonest sender starts working in secret on a\n   parallel chain containing an alternate version of his transaction.\n   The recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and z blocks have been\n   linked after it. He doesn't know the exact amount of progress the attacker has made, but\n   assuming the honest blocks took the average expected time per block, the attacker's potential\n   progress will be a Poisson distribution with expected value:\n   =z\n   q\n   p\n   To get the probability the attacker could still catch up now, we multiply the Poisson density for\n   each amount of progress he could have made by the probability he could catch up from that point:\n   ∑\n   k=0\n   ∞\n   \n   k\n   e\n   −\n   k!\n   ⋅{\n   q/ p\n   z−k \n   if k≤z\n   1 if kz}\n   Rearranging to avoid summing the infinite tail of the distribution...\n   1−∑\n   k=0\n   z\n   \n   k\n   e\n   −\n   k!\n   1−q/ p\n   z−k \n   \n   Converting to C code...\n   \\#include <math.h>\n   double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z)\n   {\n   double p = 1.0 - q;\n   double lambda = z \\* (q / p);\n   double sum = 1.0;\n   int i, k;\n   for (k = 0; k <= z; k++)\n   {\n   double poisson = exp(-lambda);\n   for (i = 1; i <= k; i++)\n   poisson \\*= lambda / i;\n   sum -= poisson \\* (1 - pow(q / p, z - k));\n   }\n   return sum;\n   }\n   7\n   Running some results, we can see the probability drop off exponentially with z.\n   q=0.1\n   z=0 P=1.0000000\n   z=1 P=0.2045873\n   z=2 P=0.0509779\n   z=3 P=0.0131722\n   z=4 P=0.0034552\n   z=5 P=0.0009137\n   z=6 P=0.0002428\n   z=7 P=0.0000647\n   z=8 P=0.0000173\n   z=9 P=0.0000046\n   z=10 P=0.0000012\n   q=0.3\n   z=0 P=1.0000000\n   z=5 P=0.1773523\n   z=10 P=0.0416605\n   z=15 P=0.0101008\n   z=20 P=0.0024804\n   z=25 P=0.0006132\n   z=30 P=0.0001522\n   z=35 P=0.0000379\n   z=40 P=0.0000095\n   z=45 P=0.0000024\n   z=50 P=0.0000006\n   Solving for P less than 0.1%...\n   P < 0.001\n   q=0.10 z=5\n   q=0.15 z=8\n   q=0.20 z=11\n   q=0.25 z=15\n   q=0.30 z=24\n   q=0.35 z=41\n   q=0.40 z=89\n   q=0.45 z=340\n7. Conclusion\n   We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. We started with\n   the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of\n   ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we\n   proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions\n   that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes\n   control a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes\n   work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are\n   not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can\n   leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what\n   happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of\n   valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on\n   them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.\n   8\n   References\n   \\[1\\] W. Dai, \"b-money,\" <http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt>, 1998.\n   \\[2\\] H.

The name can also be translated as 'kingdom of the evening;. Medieval Arab historians and geographers sometimes referred to Morocco as *al-Maghrib al-Aqṣá* (المغرب الأقصى (meaning 'the Farthest West') to distinguish it from neighbouring regions then called *al-Maghrib al-Awsaṭ* (المغرب الأوسط, meaning '[the Middle West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria)') and *al-Maghrib al-Adná* (المغرب الأدنى, meaning '[the Nearest West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia)').[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-22)\n\nThe word *Morocco* is derived from the name of the city of [Marrakesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrakesh), which was its capital under the [Almoravid dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almoravid_dynasty) and the [Almohad Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_Caliphate).[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-23) The origin of the name Marrakesh is disputed,[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-24) but it most likely comes from the [Berber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_languages) words *amur (n) akush* (ⴰⵎⵓⵔ ⵏ ⴰⴽⵓⵛ), meaning 'Land of God'.[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-25) The modern Berber name for Marrakesh is *Mṛṛakc* (in the [Berber Latin script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_Latin_alphabet)). In [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language), Morocco is known as *Fas*, a name derived from its ancient capital of [Fes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fes).

"因为yuque很多的链接放不上去，经常被封，所以只能搬家到GitHub上来。今天给大家整理一下我常用的一些币圈工具，有的网站如果登陆不了，可能就需要科学上网了，工具箱之前分一和二，分别为币圈常用工具和DeFi/NFT常用工具，近期将接触到了。\n\n## ###币圈常用的基础工具\n\n一：经常用的时候我用的主要是以下三大所，这三家所的注册网址时常更换，所以大家注册的，一定要多注意，防止注册了一下自动网址，这里我也分享一下我的链接，有需要的可以自取，币安会变得更加安全和隐私一些。\n\n* 币安交易平台： <https://accounts.binancezh.top/zh-CN/register?ref=NDFR0BI0>\n* 火币交易平台： <https://www.huobi.pk/zh-cn/topic/invited/?invite_code=yw393&t=1625022228845>\n* OK交易平台： <https://www.ouyi.fit/join/2022893?src=from:ios-share>\n* FTX交易所： <https://ftx.com/#a=19108022>\n\n二：去中心化钱去中心化钱袋，现在我常用的有三个：imtoken、metamask和tokenpocket。 hecodefi产品的时候，会有链上的链接。当前我的大部分资产是在imken和币安上。要学会如何使用metamask，非常方便，而且metamask上的很多克隆克隆坊的项目，地址都是一样的，所以也很方便，比如：heco、bsc、oec、matic、fantom等等，都是可以公用的一个地址（不过要说的话，要选各自的通道上的链）。\n\n* imtoken下载地址： [https://www.token.im](https://www.token.im/)\n* metamask下载地址：\\` [https://www.metamask.io](https://www.metamask.io/)\n* tokenpocket下载地址： [https://www.tokenpocket.pro](https://www.tokenpocket.pro/)\n\n三：常用的VPN（科学上网）我常用expressvpn，这个vpn使用很容易很稳定，属于全球用户量最大的vpn产品之一，相反是，没有中文，并且第一次登陆注册的时候需要其他vpn，才能登陆，如果你科学上网频次比较高的话，建议使用付费版的。\n\n你，还有一个安卓手机常用的一个VPN，佛跳墙VPN，我很少用直接的，复制网页到浏览器是正常下载的，链接在这个世界（这个链接会经常变） ，如果登陆不了就证明已经改变了，只能在谁有这个应用上可以复制最新的地址）：[https](https://getftq.internetedu.site/)://getftq.internetedu.site/\n\n* expressvpn下载地址（有我的推荐码）：

expressvpn下载地址（没我的推荐码）：[https](https://expressvpn.com/)：[//expressvpn.com](https://expressvpn.com/)\n\n四：常用的K线看盘工具及十字盘提起（网站和app） Aicoin和TradingView\n\n* 下载和网页地址分别为： [https://aicoin.com](https://aicoin.com/) <https://cn.tradingview.com/> aicoin近期因为政策原因，需要科学上网才可以登陆。\n* 币coin：专业的链上监控以及盯盘提醒（做合约人群或者日内交易者使用较多） <https://bcoin.info/>\n* 实时报道的财经资讯工具：金十数据（做合约或者短线必备工具） <https://www.jin10.com/>\n* 合约持仓、资金费率查询：[www.bybt.com](http://www.bybt.com/)\n\n五：常用的数据查询平台\n\n1）非小号，我刚进入币圈的时候，下载的第一个app就是非小号，上面有各种币的参数等等，包括兑换查询，成绩等，很好用的一个软件。\n\n2）一小段链123，类似非小号，一小段于12更偏重的指标的集合，比如你的币数据和各种指标的集合，比如你观察定投指数、屯指数、逃顶指数、币天指数等等。\n\n3）玻璃节点，这个网站是一个棒棒的一个链上指标大全，指标非常丰富，结果你想看近期到底是短期持有的人卖币的多，还是长期持有卖币的多，比如你想看最近转入的币多还是创业的币多。也是很多大V经常使用的一个，纯中文网站。\n\n4）cryptoquant，和glassnode都属于链上指标工具\n\n5）新货币分析和行情网址：coingecko和coinmarketcap种已经不是小号了，还有很多特别喜欢的，特别是小币比较全，包括CMC币安收购。\n\n* 非小号下载地址： [https://www.feixiaohao.com](https://www.feixiaohao.com/) 备用网址：feixiaohao.info\n* 区块链123地址： [https://www.qkl123.com](https://www.qkl123.com/)\n* glassnode地址：

<https://coinmarketcap.com/zh/>\n\n六：常用的一些信息平台\n\n1）国内常用的：Odaily星球日报、巴比特、币乎\n\n前两个是圈圈新闻实时报道平台，并且也有一些深度的海内外的文章，也常常能发现巨大的诱因。首发就是币乎，同时币乎输出文章还有奖励奖励。\n\n* 星球日报下载：[https](https://www.odaily.com/)://www.odaily.com/\n* 巴比特下载： <https://www.8btc.com/>\n* 币乎下载： <https://bihu.com/>\n\n2）海外常用的优质的资讯类网站：[https://cointelegraph.com/ ](https://cointelegraph.com/) [https://cointelegraphcn.com/（中文版）](https://cointelegraphcn.com/%EF%BC%88%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89)

Telegram，好比国内的微信，twitter好比国内的微博，不一样的是，他们更加开放，里面的内容是五花八门，一般的项目，都会有这两个官方账号，所以一般大家如果发现什么空投项目，也可以看看，如果这两个都没有的话，估计也不是什么优质空投。当然，telegram上的骗子群组很多，很多模仿了官方的社群，有一次我就被拉到了一个诈骗的一个群里，竟然也给对方打了以太坊，后来才发现是一个假的官方社群，所以大家要多加小心，凡是要私钥和助记词的统统拉黑。\n* 电报下载：[https](https://telegram.org/) : [//telegram.org/](https://telegram.org/)\n* 推特下载：[https](https://twitter.com/) : [//twitter.com/](https://twitter.com/)\n* discord下载：

Diurna — 罗马元老院对其公民的正式通知。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6DsSTtuxFvSTZgbNRHUeo.png?height=470&width=800)\n\n注意：本协议与其他早期Defi项目不同，充满实验性与风险。协议以经过审计的OlympusDAO合约为基础，但是包含为了适配Moonriver所作出的诸多修改，并实现了一些附加特性。我们计划与审计机构合作，在发布后保持持续审计。\n\nRomeDAO是一个社区项目，核心成员包含来自OlympusDAO社区的开发者、研究员以及社区建设者。\n\n我们的初衷是帮助扩展OlympusDAO生态至Kusama/Polkadot体系，同时实验新的债券类型与机制设计。我们从一开始就在考虑如何更好地兼顾ROME的供应扩张与金库增长。我们预计在广阔的Kusama/Polkadot生态中，市场对于高收益率和储备货币存在着巨大的需求。\n\n我们在Moonriver（Kusama）上的实验活动为我们最终扩展到Moonbeam（Polkadot）做好了准备。我们迫不及待地想成为这两条链上DeFi的基础。\n\n请注意，我们没有获得与OlympusDAO的正式合作或认可。他们已经明确表示不支持Time、Klima、Temple和我们喜欢的其他项目分叉。虽然我们没有以任何官方身份与他们合作，但我们希望他们继续鼓励和支持我们的使命。许多OlympusDAO早期贡献者和社区成员都是我们团队的关键组成。\n\n## 在本文中我们将概述一下内容：\n\n* 机制设计\n* 代币经济\n* 国库方向\n* 智能合约&前端/设计\n* 社区&增长\n* 白名单&启动\n\n## I. 机制设计\n\n作为OlympusDAO的早期成员和贡献者，我们团队致力于推出由国库支持的非挂钩储备货币。我们研究了无风险价值（RFV），并在协议拥有流动性（POL）方向上努力。\n\n自OlympusDAO推出的7个月以来，他们已经在RFV中积累了1.29亿美元，并拥有几乎所有自身的流动性，这使得国库资产的市值达到4.96亿美元。我们可以从他们的巨大成功中学到很多东西，但也有很多东西可以改进。\n\n**如你所见，我们将在Moonriver上发布。**我们相信Kusama生态系统的实验性质，并相信其在更广阔的Polkadot生态系统中作为EVM兼容链将发挥重要作用。Moonriver上已经具备了大量流动性，这是Romies在Kusama生态中创建重要价值的稳定基础。\n\n**以下是我们的计划：**\n\n为了从一开始建立健康的国库，我们将推出以下债券类型，接受两种稳定币和一个LP：\n\n* Magic Internet Money（MIM）\n* DAI\n* ROME/MOVR Solarbeam LP\n\n注意：如果对MIM和DAI的需求过高，导致Moonriver的流动性无法支撑，我们将暂时接受USDC作为稳定币选项，因为USDC是Moonriver生态中流动性最厚的稳定币。也就是说，我们期望通过MIM和DAI拥有足够的流动性。\n\n我们正在与对OlympusDAO政策有影响力的人员以及研究者合作，以最终确定债券参数以及后续设计。为了向OlympusDAO团队表示诚意，我们的一名关键政策成员也是他们DAO的最初政策贡献者之一。我们很高兴他能加入我们团队。\n\n为了将流动性引入生态系统，我们正在与一个主要的跨链桥合作，该桥打算利用RomeDAO的发布将其生态用户引入Moonriver。随着我们确定有关该合作伙伴的更多细节，我们将发布公告。他们将帮助我们最终与OHM绑定。不过就目前而言，绑定OHM并不是首要任务。\n\n最后，为了透明起见，我们正在探索将Sushi作为Solarbeam以外的额外流动性选项。优先考虑Solarbeam是因为他们致力于Moonriver生态系统并且已经具有一定流动性，但我们预计最终也会为Moonriver上的Sushi增加流动性。\n\n![Solarbeam交易对](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t7z9AKVH_c1zEyjQPyVDc.png?height=743&width=700)\n\nSushi已经在Moonriver上推出，但流动性较差。我们有可能成为他们最大的流动性池，并成为Moonriver Sushiswap上的主要流动性池。目前而言，我们将通过ROME/MOVR债券，成为Solarbeam的主要流动性池。\n\n总之，我们相信我们可以成为Moonriver生态中的引领者。通过在生态内外部建立合作伙伴关系，我们将为Moonriver以及更广阔的Kusama和Polkadot生态吸引关注和资金。\n\n## II. 代币经济\n\n激励社区贡献者、创始人和开发人员是所有项目的关键。许多项目筹集风投资金，为创始人、投资人和其他利益相关者保留大量代币。我们不会这样做。\n\n面对风投展示出的极大兴趣，我们对他们说了同样的话，“对不起，请在社区后面排队。”\n\n[https://twitter.com/romedaofinance/status/1450256044001738755?s=20](https://twitter.com/romedaofinance/status/1450256044001738755?s=20)\n\n因此，为了创建一个繁荣的罗马社会，我们正在采取另一种方式，我们认为这种方式更能与社区保持一致并促进透明度。我们不会向风投、顾问或任何利益相关者分配我们的代币。相反，100%的ROME将通过债券与抵押，掌握在社区手中。从第一天起，创始人将与社区绑定在一起。\n\n您是对我们协议感兴趣的VC吗？非常好！没有特殊待遇。没有折扣。没有归属条款。请与我们其他人一起！\n\n代币分配：\n\n* 社区：100%\n* VC：0%\n* 顾问：0%\n\n与OlympusDAO类似，用户也将从RomeDAO中获取高额APY，随着金库的扩张调整供应增长，随着情况发展小心评估跑道。\n\n**所以我们将如何为项目的持续发展提供资金？**\n\n作为为我们的工作筹集资金的替代方案，协议将自发布之日的初始2个月时间内，采用DAO对债券征收10%税额的方案。该税额将收取国库创造价值的10%，作为团队专用的DAO资产，以奖励贡献者、支付开发者，并确保协议能够持续发展和创新。着10%将来供应债券而产生的基础资产。\n\n两个月后，我们将以代币持有者的快照投票方式，提议减少对罗马市民的税费。减少到5%是有可能的，但我们将与社区合作找到一个合理的百分比。\n\n我们希望关于如何激励社区和创始团队的讨论可以展示民主的价值，以及繁荣生态发展。\n\n我们相信，这种为项目提供资金的形式，比OlympusDAO以及其他生态系统采取的预留代币更加透明。我们相信，这10%的税收可以让社区团结起来，让他们通过债券来赚取代币、增加国库，并为罗马的建设者提供一小笔资金，以创造一个繁荣社会。\n\n我们不会为自己或其他任何人保留一定比例一定比例的ROME代币。我们相信，大量未归属代币的储备只会创造来自创始人的抛压，他们最终会出售并确定大量利润。相反，我们的创始人将与社区成员一起参与购买债券。\n\n最后一个兴趣点：用于支付开发者的10%税额的一部分将用于持续从公开市场购买ROME。随着时间的推移，我们将定期更新这些资产的状态及其向贡献者的分配情况。我们还可以更积极地将这10%税费灵活部署到有助于Moonriver生态系统发展的活动中。\n\n## III. 国库方向\n\nRome的债券和国库价值累积不仅仅创造一个简单的国库。它将创造一个机制，起机制将证明比现有的国库支持储备货币更加透明。\n\n我们正在引入国库董事的概念。在启动时，这些董事将完全来自于团队内，决定如何部署国库资产。这些决定将极其保守。然而，在推出后不久，该流程将允许ROME持有者就国库的分配方式进行投票。\n\n这样一来，ROME国库将由社区投票分配，真正地成为一种RomeDAO的民主程序。我们目前正在设计一个UI，它将展示国库中资产的流动视图、分配情况、当前增长，以及预计的短期和长期增长。每个月，我们都会根据社区的判断，为持续维护和重新分配国库资产进行一次投票。\n\n更灵活的资金管理使社区能够产生更多的资产收益，通过积极地将资产分配给可以创造最大价值的协议，鼓励更繁荣的Moonriver生态系统。我们相信，积极部署到Kusama和Polkadot生态系统将使能够既为我们的国库创造有吸引力的收益机会，同时成为Kusama和Polkadot上项目成长的基础。\n\n## IV. 智能合约&前端/设计\n\n我们的智能合约已经基本上可以部署了，因为合约是在已经经过审核的OlympusDAO合约基础上，针对债券类型进行了细微修改，并针对Moonriver进行了兼容性修改。我们目前正在进行最终修改并在测试网上为部署进行准备工作。**请注意，修改意味着合约当前是未经审计且具有实验性的。Kusama是一个实验性区块链，Moonriver更是如此，我们也是一个实验性的协议。**\n\n在前端方面，我们聘请了DeFi中最好的设计师之一来帮助打造独特的用户体验。所需要做的就是分享我们社区的能量，并将她从她的全职工作中拖过来。她的初始设计正在进行中，我们的前端开发人员为发布进行准备。我们希望在启动时使用新的设计，但是如果在启动时这些新设计还没准备好，我们将使用当前设计——采用罗马主题颜色的OlympusDAO前端。\n\n我们打算在下周开始分享设计模型，并在我们的测试网上挑选出一批忠实的罗马人。\n\n## V. 社区&增长\n\n希望我们现在已经清楚地表明我们是多么关心建立一个繁荣的社区（Romies）。我们的团队对Romies的激励有很多想法。积极参与治理、长期质押并与其他Romies(III, III)结盟的RomeDAO参与者将受到奖励。\n\n自发布的72小时内，我们的Discord频道已经增长到5000romies，超过500个服务器助推。我们最喜欢的DeFi项目大多也就拥有50个助推。与此同时，我们的Twitter粉丝也增长到3000名，我们对社区优先的民主罗马承诺能够引起如此共鸣，我们并不惊讶。\n\n我们的增长团队已经在为执行我们的路线图而忙碌，在我们的聊天中出现了一个小高潮：\n\n在叙事和营销之间的完美平行关系中，我们可以以领导人类有史以来最伟大征服的那些人相同的精神，来开展营销活动。像我们的祖先一样，我们将确定目标，协同开发，并通过运动来发展和扩大我们的帝国来执行我们的使命。\n\n我们将赢得战争，一场接一场的战争，远扬我们的气质。我们是**$ROME**。\n\n我们的第一个战役：罗马-一特鲁里亚战争。\n\n我们发起的每个竞选活动都由我们的参议院（核心/团队）角色带头，然后在我们认为合适的情况下通过投票任命治理者角色。随着我们扩大领土（垂直、渠道、合作伙伴关系），我们可以在我们扩大时将治理领土的职责交给总督。我们绝不能在战火纷飞、资源匮乏的边疆失控。随着我们的扩展，竞选活动将要求治理者在**$ROME**的规则下履行他们的职责。\n\n类似的，战役将开启新的机会，这些机会让我们专注，但也展示了我们在人数和狡猾战术方面的实力。在我们开展新活动时，我们会发布更新的路线图，将我们的扩张可视化。我们可以从罗马历史中参考著名领土（战役）名称：\n\n* 伊特鲁西（Etruscans）\n* 拉丁（Latins）\n* 萨莫奈（Samnites）\n* 高卢（Gauls）\n* 希腊（Greeks）\n* 迦太基（Carthaginians）\n\n每片领土可能有不止一场战役（pt1，pt2等），因此我们可以随着时间的推移将他们分开。\n\n目前，我们只是一支统一的罗马军队，准备开始罗马在意大利半岛的扩张。**让伊特鲁西战役开始吧。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U__g8TY2z1hm5fCTpErQv.png?height=534&width=700)\n\n## IV. 白名单&发布（III,III）\n\n跳过此部分？NGMI。\n\n在10月期间，我么一直在努力打造我们的团队、合约和合作伙伴关系。按照目前的开发速度，我们预计发布时间会在11月初至中旬。\n\n这给了我们充足的时间来巩固我们的合作伙伴关系，确保所有合约完善并就绪，让我们的社区熟悉 Moonriver，并协调我们的社区以开始建设繁荣的罗马社会。\n\n我们正在仔细确保我们的发布安全，如果这意味着一个更稳定和更安全的罗马，我们并不急于发布。虽然我们是一个在实验链上启动的实验项目，但我们相信 Moonriver、Moonbeam 以及 Polkadot 和 Kusama 生态系统已准备好在价值项目中爆发。我们希望确保我们的项目作为整个生态系统的稳定储备资产，以供未来几代 Romies 使用。\n\n白名单流程将在临近发布时公布，以避免我们的方法过于儿戏。\n\n我们将继续定期更新，保持在 Discord 和 Twitter 上联络，继续我们伟大共和国的发展。\n\n为罗马。为共和国。Gloria

Diurna — 罗马元老院对其公民的正式通知。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6DsSTtuxFvSTZgbNRHUeo.png?height=470&width=800)\n\n注意：本协议与其他早期Defi项目不同，充满实验性与风险。协议以经过审计的OlympusDAO合约为基础，但是包含为了适配Moonriver所作出的诸多修改，并实现了一些附加特性。我们计划与审计机构合作，在发布后保持持续审计。\n\nRomeDAO是一个社区项目，核心成员包含来自OlympusDAO社区的开发者、研究员以及社区建设者。\n\n我们的初衷是帮助扩展OlympusDAO生态至Kusama/Polkadot体系，同时实验新的债券类型与机制设计。我们从一开始就在考虑如何更好地兼顾ROME的供应扩张与金库增长。我们预计在广阔的Kusama/Polkadot生态中，市场对于高收益率和储备货币存在着巨大的需求。\n\n我们在Moonriver（Kusama）上的实验活动为我们最终扩展到Moonbeam（Polkadot）做好了准备。我们迫不及待地想成为这两条链上DeFi的基础。\n\n请注意，我们没有获得与OlympusDAO的正式合作或认可。他们已经明确表示不支持Time、Klima、Temple和我们喜欢的其他项目分叉。虽然我们没有以任何官方身份与他们合作，但我们希望他们继续鼓励和支持我们的使命。许多OlympusDAO早期贡献者和社区成员都是我们团队的关键组成。\n\n## 在本文中我们将概述一下内容：\n\n* 机制设计\n* 代币经济\n* 国库方向\n* 智能合约&前端/设计\n* 社区&增长\n* 白名单&启动\n\n## I. 机制设计\n\n作为OlympusDAO的早期成员和贡献者，我们团队致力于推出由国库支持的非挂钩储备货币。我们研究了无风险价值（RFV），并在协议拥有流动性（POL）方向上努力。\n\n自OlympusDAO推出的7个月以来，他们已经在RFV中积累了1.29亿美元，并拥有几乎所有自身的流动性，这使得国库资产的市值达到4.96亿美元。我们可以从他们的巨大成功中学到很多东西，但也有很多东西可以改进。\n\n\\*\\*如你所见，我们将在Moonriver上发布。\\*\\*我们相信Kusama生态系统的实验性质，并相信其在更广阔的Polkadot生态系统中作为EVM兼容链将发挥重要作用。Moonriver上已经具备了大量流动性，这是Romies在Kusama生态中创建重要价值的稳定基础。\n\n**以下是我们的计划：**\n\n为了从一开始建立健康的国库，我们将推出以下债券类型，接受两种稳定币和一个LP：\n\n* Magic Internet Money（MIM）\n* DAI\n* ROME/MOVR Solarbeam LP\n\n注意：如果对MIM和DAI的需求过高，导致Moonriver的流动性无法支撑，我们将暂时接受USDC作为稳定币选项，因为USDC是Moonriver生态中流动性最厚的稳定币。也就是说，我们期望通过MIM和DAI拥有足够的流动性。\n\n我们正在与对OlympusDAO政策有影响力的人员以及研究者合作，以最终确定债券参数以及后续设计。为了向OlympusDAO团队表示诚意，我们的一名关键政策成员也是他们DAO的最初政策贡献者之一。我们很高兴他能加入我们团队。\n\n为了将流动性引入生态系统，我们正在与一个主要的跨链桥合作，该桥打算利用RomeDAO的发布将其生态用户引入Moonriver。随着我们确定有关该合作伙伴的更多细节，我们将发布公告。他们将帮助我们最终与OHM绑定。不过就目前而言，绑定OHM并不是首要任务。\n\n最后，为了透明起见，我们正在探索将Sushi作为Solarbeam以外的额外流动性选项。优先考虑Solarbeam是因为他们致力于Moonriver生态系统并且已经具有一定流动性，但我们预计最终也会为Moonriver上的Sushi增加流动性。\n\n![Solarbeam交易对](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t7z9AKVH_c1zEyjQPyVDc.png?height=743&width=700)\n\nSushi已经在Moonriver上推出，但流动性较差。我们有可能成为他们最大的流动性池，并成为Moonriver Sushiswap上的主要流动性池。目前而言，我们将通过ROME/MOVR债券，成为Solarbeam的主要流动性池。\n\n总之，我们相信我们可以成为Moonriver生态中的引领者。通过在生态内外部建立合作伙伴关系，我们将为Moonriver以及更广阔的Kusama和Polkadot生态吸引关注和资金。\n\n## II. 代币经济\n\n激励社区贡献者、创始人和开发人员是所有项目的关键。许多项目筹集风投资金，为创始人、投资人和其他利益相关者保留大量代币。我们不会这样做。\n\n面对风投展示出的极大兴趣，我们对他们说了同样的话，“对不起，请在社区后面排队。”\n\n[https://twitter.com/romedaofinance/status/1450256044001738755?s=20](https://twitter.com/romedaofinance/status/1450256044001738755?s=20)\n\n因此，为了创建一个繁荣的罗马社会，我们正在采取另一种方式，我们认为这种方式更能与社区保持一致并促进透明度。我们不会向风投、顾问或任何利益相关者分配我们的代币。相反，100%的ROME将通过债券与抵押，掌握在社区手中。从第一天起，创始人将与社区绑定在一起。\n\n您是对我们协议感兴趣的VC吗？非常好！没有特殊待遇。没有折扣。没有归属条款。请与我们其他人一起！\n\n代币分配：\n\n* 社区：100%\n* VC：0%\n* 顾问：0%\n\n与OlympusDAO类似，用户也将从RomeDAO中获取高额APY，随着金库的扩张调整供应增长，随着情况发展小心评估跑道。\n\n**所以我们将如何为项目的持续发展提供资金？**\n\n作为为我们的工作筹集资金的替代方案，协议将自发布之日的初始2个月时间内，采用DAO对债券征收10%税额的方案。该税额将收取国库创造价值的10%，作为团队专用的DAO资产，以奖励贡献者、支付开发者，并确保协议能够持续发展和创新。着10%将来供应债券而产生的基础资产。\n\n两个月后，我们将以代币持有者的快照投票方式，提议减少对罗马市民的税费。减少到5%是有可能的，但我们将与社区合作找到一个合理的百分比。\n\n我们希望关于如何激励社区和创始团队的讨论可以展示民主的价值，以及繁荣生态发展。\n\n我们相信，这种为项目提供资金的形式，比OlympusDAO以及其他生态系统采取的预留代币更加透明。我们相信，这10%的税收可以让社区团结起来，让他们通过债券来赚取代币、增加国库，并为罗马的建设者提供一小笔资金，以创造一个繁荣社会。\n\n我们不会为自己或其他任何人保留一定比例一定比例的ROME代币。我们相信，大量未归属代币的储备只会创造来自创始人的抛压，他们最终会出售并确定大量利润。相反，我们的创始人将与社区成员一起参与购买债券。\n\n最后一个兴趣点：用于支付开发者的10%税额的一部分将用于持续从公开市场购买ROME。随着时间的推移，我们将定期更新这些资产的状态及其向贡献者的分配情况。我们还可以更积极地将这10%税费灵活部署到有助于Moonriver生态系统发展的活动中。\n\n## III. 国库方向\n\nRome的债券和国库价值累积不仅仅创造一个简单的国库。它将创造一个机制，起机制将证明比现有的国库支持储备货币更加透明。\n\n我们正在引入国库董事的概念。在启动时，这些董事将完全来自于团队内，决定如何部署国库资产。这些决定将极其保守。然而，在推出后不久，该流程将允许ROME持有者就国库的分配方式进行投票。\n\n这样一来，ROME国库将由社区投票分配，真正地成为一种RomeDAO的民主程序。我们目前正在设计一个UI，它将展示国库中资产的流动视图、分配情况、当前增长，以及预计的短期和长期增长。每个月，我们都会根据社区的判断，为持续维护和重新分配国库资产进行一次投票。\n\n更灵活的资金管理使社区能够产生更多的资产收益，通过积极地将资产分配给可以创造最大价值的协议，鼓励更繁荣的Moonriver生态系统。我们相信，积极部署到Kusama和Polkadot生态系统将使能够既为我们的国库创造有吸引力的收益机会，同时成为Kusama和Polkadot上项目成长的基础。\n\n##

Budući da troškovi uvijek postoje, potrebno je pronaći način na koji možemo izvući vrijednost. Vaši podaci i vrijeme vaša su plaća. Da smo tada znali ono što znamo sada, možda bismo izabrali drugačije.\n\nOsim toga, vrlo je važno imati na umu da je veća priča zapravo pozitivnija unatoč tomu što je izvlačenje vrijednosti na Webu 2.0 izvršeno od strane platformi društvenih mreža. Pojedinci su mogli stvarati sadržaj, dijeliti ga sa svijetom i primati plaću bez napuštanja svog doma.\n\nUnatoč toj slobodi koja nam omogućuje da se izrazimo i budemo plaćeni za vrijednost koju stvaramo, znamo da Internet nije toliko slobodan kao što je prvotno bilo zamišljeno.\n\nPristup webu, objavljivanje sadržaja i primanje plaće uključuje brojne davatelje usluga koji vrebaju u pozadini. Ti davatelji usluga mogu blokirati vaš sadržaj, zaustaviti vaša plaćanja ili vas jednostavno u potpunosti ukloniti s platforme. Svaki je pružatelj usluga potencijalna točka cenzure. Svaki od njih u stanju je izvući vrijednost.\n\nBlockchain je tehnologija koja eliminira potrebu za posrednicima i koja posjeduje snagu kojom može ukloniti nepotrebne pružatelje usluga koji stoje između autora i potrošača. Kada govorimo o blockchain tehnologiji nailazimo na jedan zanimljiv paradoks - njezina najveća kvaliteta manifestira se u činjenici da je najvrjednija kada izvlači što je manje moguće vrijednosti od svojih korisnika.\n\nFacebook ne bi trebao prodavati vaše podatke, a da vam ne plati. YouTube ne bi trebao imati veću zaradu od oglašavanja od vas. Twitter ne bi smio zabraniti ili blokirati vaše tweetove jer se ne slaže s vama.\n\nZato smo kreirali platformu Subsocial. Radi se o Web 3.0 tehnologiji s koja jamči suverenitet podataka. Vi kontrolirate podatke koje stvarate. Vaš sadržaj, vaša vrijednost.\n\nPregled\n\nSubsocial je otvorena platforma koja svakome omogućuje pokretanje vlastitih decentraliziranih društvenih mreža i tržišta otpornih na cenzuru. Platforma Subsocial će vam pomoći da stvorite vlastitu decentraliziranu verziju globalno popularnih stranica kao što su Medium, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Discourse, Patreon, OnlyFans itd.\n\nNaš softver koristi Substrate blockchain okvir i IPFS za decentraliziranu pohranu datoteka koji omogućuju personalizirani izvor tekućih vijesti i obavijesti, transparentnu reputaciju, pretraživanje cijelog teksta, bogate formate sadržaja bez žrtvovanja sustava SEO (optimizacija tražilice).\n\nUpotreba sustava Substrate platformi Subsocial omogućuje da se poveže s proširenjem Polkadot i Kusama. Polkadot je sljedeća generacija blockchain protokola koji ujedinjuje čitavu mrežu namjenski izgrađenih blockchaina, pružajući im mogućnost besprijekorne međusobne komunikacije i uzajamnog djelovanja unutar zadanog opsega. Polkadot će osigurati međulančanu interakciju, kao i zajedničku sigurnosnu platformu na kojoj se Subsocial može proširiti, ali i ostati siguran.\n\nPlatforma Subsocial društvena je mreža koja ne poznaje nikakva ograničenja.\n\nArhitektura\n\nPlatforma Subsocial više je od blogging platforme koja nudi plaćanja u kriptovaluti. Radi se o revolucionarnoj platformi koja povezuje društvene mreže s decentraliziranim financijama. Ovo je financijska društvena mreža koja predstavlja spoj društvene mreže i decentraliziranih financija (DeFi). Kako bismo bolje objasnili po čemu se razlikujemo od jednostavnih blogging platformi, moramo predstaviti našu arhitekturu na visokoj razini.\n\nUkratko ćemo vas upoznati sa sljedećim temama: gdje se sadržaj objavljuje i kako se može unovčiti putem brojnih temeljnih načina na kojima radimo i koje što prije želimo učiniti dostupnima. Ovaj će vam rad otkriti i mnoštvo reputacijskih vrsta te načine na koje rješavamo reputacijska pitanja.\n\nUz platformu Subsocial ne morate pokretati vlastiti blockchain za društvenu mrežu. Na lancu platforme Subsocial, koji će pružiti zajedničke efekte umrežavanja, može djelovati mnoštvo različitih društvenih mreža. Mreža je prema zadanim postavkama otporna na cenzuru, međutim, svaka zajednica može postaviti vlastita moderacijska pravila.\nObjave i prostori\n\nTemeljni elementi platforme Subsocial su prostori, obajve, komentari, lajkovi i pratitelji. Ovi elementi poznati su svima koji su koristili bilo koju platformu društvenih mreža.\n\nNajbolji način za njihovo razumijevanje usporedba je s poznatim platformama:\n\nProstori su slični:\n\nBlogovima na platformi Blogger\nPublikacijama na platformi Medium\nGrupama ili stranicama na platformi Facebook\nRačunima na platformama Twitter i Instagram\nKanalima na platformi YouTube\nPoslužiteljima na platformi Discord\nForumima na platformi Discourse\n\nObjave su slične:\n\nObjavama na platformi Facebook\nČlancima na platformi Medium\nTweetovima na platformi Twitter\n\nŠto kažete na nešto naprednije? Kako možemo ponovno stvoriti popularne platforme za Web 3.0 koristeći platformu Subsocial?\n\nAirbnb – popisi apartmana su prostori, dok su recenzije objave\nQuora – pitanje je objava, odgovori su komentari/odgovori.\nStack Overflow -\n\nAutori odgovora mogu biti nagrađeni, npr. od strane onoga tko je postavio pitanje\nRaspodjela isplata također se može podijeliti između onoga što vlasnik pitanja i zajednica smatraju najboljim odgovorom.\n\nPatreon/OnlyFans – podržani korisnici mogu biti predstavljeni kao prostori koji su nagrađeni putem plaćenih pretplata i glasova zajednice itd.\n\nSve objave i prostori povezani su s parovima javnih ključeva (računima). To znači da se sav sadržaj može precizno pripisati autoru i/ili vlasniku objava. Korištena kriptografija istovjetna je onoj upotrijebljenoj na platformama Polkadot i Kusami. Platforma Subsocial podržava proširenje platforme Polkadot u obliku {.js} koje omogućuje jednostavno upravljanje ključevima u pregledniku ili, u budućnosti, izvanmrežnim trezorom putem sustava Parity Signer.\n\nUz ugrađenu podršku za IPFS, vaš prostor može iskoristiti prednosti decentraliziranih usluga poslužitelja.\n\nSvi su kodovi otvorenog izvora i omogućuju prilagodbu pristupnog korisničkog sučelja, a prilagođeni su potrebama vaše zajednice. Za više pojedinosti pogledajte JS SDK platforme Subsocial. Ako imate ideju za novu funkcionalnost lanca, možete predložiti značajku ili stvoriti zahtjev za povlačenjem putem repozitorija čvorova platforme Subsocial.\n\nIdentitet\n\nNa platformi Subsocial dopuštamo izradu korisničkog profila. Radi se o jedinstvenom identitetu koji se može koristiti u bilo kojoj zajednici izgrađenoj povrh platforme Subsocial. Vjerujemo da bi se u budućnosti ovaj identitet mogao ponovno koristiti na drugim paralancima.\n\nDruštvena mreža u vlasništvu korisnika\n\nNa trenutnim društvenim mrežama imamo vrlo ograničene informacije o tome kako se upravlja platformom. Djelomičan razlog zašto je to tako leži u činjenici da nemamo vlasništvo nad platformom. Najveće tvrtke koje su u vlasništvu društvenih mreža zarađuju milijarde dolara od kojih autorima sadržaja ide samo jedan mali dio profita, dok korisnici ne dobivaju apsolutno nikakav dio zarade. Čak i kao dioničarima matične tvrtke, naš će udio biti gotovo neznatan.\n\nNa platformi Subsocial korisnici su vlasnici mreže. Uz vlasnike tokena, koji mogu sudjelovati u cjelokupnom upravljanju platformom Subsocial, upravljanje svakim prostorom u kojem su učlanjeni omogućeno je i korisnicima. Svaki prostor djeluje poput decentralizirane autonomne organizacije (DAO), gdje članovi mogu biti vlasnici i pomoći u upravljanju prostorom. Upravljanje prostorom je neobavezno, ali vjerujemo da će mnogi prostori odlučiti prihvatiti ovu značajku.\n\nAko se ne radi o vašim ključevima, onda to nisu vaši podaci\n\nObjavljivanje sadržaja na web-mjestu u vlasništvu tvrtki koje posjeduju tradicionalne društvene mreže pretpostavlja mala prava nad načinom na koji se sadržaj unovčava ili cenzurira. Štoviše, vaše vjerodajnice za prijavu pohranjuju se u njihovoj središnjoj bazi podataka. Morate vjerovati da će te tvrtke moći zaštititi vaše privatne podatke, a već smo ranije svjedočili brojnim situacijama u kojim je došlo do povrede podataka u vlasništvu najvećih tvrtki koje djeluju u Web 2.0 prostoru (uključujući Facebook i Twitter). Ne postoji način na koji možete provjeriti prodaju li te tvrtke vaše podatke.\n\nTehnologije koje pokreću paradigmu Web 3.0 omogućuju korisnicima da zadrže vlasništvo nad vlastitim podacima. Umjesto da objavljujete sadržaj na platformi u vlasništvu velikih društvenih mreža, sadržaj sada možete objavljivati i monetizirati potpuno neovisno o trećim stranama. Vaše vjerodajnice za prijavu pohranjuju se lokalno, i to na vašim uređajima, a ne u centraliziranoj bazi podataka.\n\nMonetizacija\n\nNapojnice\n\nNapojnice mogu biti plaćene po objavi, komentaru ili prostoru. Osim autorima sadržaja, nagrade mogu biti isplaćene i osobama koje su objavile dobar komentar/odgovor.\n\nPretplate\n\nJedna ključna značajka koja nije dostupna na prethodnim blockchain web-mjestima za blogove uključivanje je pretplate. Ova značajka od iznimne važnosti koja pretpostavlja unovčavanje sadržaja dostupna je na popularnim Web 2.0 platformama kao što su Patreon, SubStack i OnlyFans.\n\nPojava pretplata u ekosustavu kreiranja sadržaja omogućila je ljudima da počnu samostalno raditi i puno se detaljnije povezivati sa svojim obožavateljima. Dok su prije pojave ovakvih stranica YouTube oglasi nudili nešto poput proxyja, te su stranice otišle korak dalje i omogućile su objavljivanje privatnog sadržaja za različite razine pretplatnika.\n\nNajveći je nedostatak to što ove platforme mogu blokirati ili ukloniti sadržaj koji im se ne sviđa, a osim toga, autori svoj sadržaj povjeravaju vlasnicima platforme. Koliko besplatnog sadržaja može vidjeti tim koji stoji iza platforme OnlyFans? Uklanjanje točaka povjerenja važno je za blockchain ekosustav.\n\nTehnički dio dodavanja pretplata u Subsocial lanac je jednostavan, međutim, još uvijek treba provesti određena istraživanja o tome kako postupati s hostingom za privatni sadržaj na decentraliziran način, a da se pritom očuva privatnost autora.\n\nProdaja ili najam sadržaja\n\nBlockchain tehnologija omogućuje istinsko vlasništvo: budući da ga posjedujete, svoj biste sadržaj trebali moći prodati ili preprodati. Ova dinamika zapravo nije moguća na Webu 2.0: vaš sadržaj može uključivati vaše ime koje obično nije kriptografski potpisano niti pohranjeno u javnoj glavnoj knjizi. Vlasništvo u Webu 2.0 prilično je nejasno, a njegova provedba zahtijeva pravne ugovore.\n\nUz platformu SubSocial moguće je prodavati sadržaj, kao i iznajmljivati postove ili prostore. Vi zadržavate vlasništvo i ostvarujete određeni prihod, dok najmoprimac zadržava pravo na promet ostvaren posjetom korisnika. Navedimo primjer:\n\n\\*NAPOMENA\n\nAko ste napisali popularnu objavu na neku temu (npr. e-trgovina), a objava privuče tisuće pregleda mjesečno, onda je moguće pretpostaviti da je drugi vlasnik prostora upoznat s činjenicom da vaša objava privlači mnogo prometa. Na platformi SubSocial svoju biste objavu na određeno vrijeme mogli iznajmiti drugom prostoru i na taj način ostvariti pravo na prikupljanje autorskih naknada za svoj trud.\n\nPametni ugovori\n\nKorisnici platforme Subsocial nisu ograničeni na ugrađenu funkciju unovčavanja koju izvorno pruža lanac. Korisnici mogu implementirati pametne ugovore kako bi pokazali beskrajnu kreativnost u unovčavanju svog sadržaja i ugleda. Moguće je izraditi različite algoritme za unovčavanje koji su napredniji ili prilagođeniji vašoj zajednici. Pogledajmo dva primjera koji ilustriraju visok stupanj prilagodbe unovčavanja koje nudi platforma Subsocial:\n\nObjava može biti vlasništvo više autora, a isplate se mogu modificirati u skladu s udjelom u vlasništvu, kao i u skladu s brojem lajkova ili odgovora.\nProstor može pokrenuti jedinstvene tjedne natječaje koji bi nagrađivali autore tri najpopularnije objave na temelju broja lajkova i dijeljenja.\n\nNadamo se da ćemo uspjeti pružiti istu razinu kreativnosti koja je u prisutna u decentraliziranom financijsku sustavu unutar Ethereuma. Svjesni smo da bez pametnih ugovora decentralizirani financijski sustav unutar Ethereuma ne bi bio moguć. Interakcija između mnogih DeFi projekata izraz je sastavljanja pametnih ugovora.\n\nDruštvene financije (SoFi): kombinacija decentraliziranih financija (DeFi) i društvenih mreža\n\nDruštvene financije (SoFi) predstavljaju naš pogled na područja u kojima blockchain tehnologija može revolucionirati plaćanja za društvene mreže. Platforma Subsocial gradi SoFi alate decentraliziranih financijskih primitiva koji su optimizirani za društveno umrežavanje.\n\nOsim što je važno da autori sadržaja ubiru plodove svojega rada, važno je i da zajednica može slobodno odlučiti koga će promovirati i nagraditi, što bi već trebalo biti jasno iz ovog rada. SoFi, međutim, preuzima ta temeljna načela kako bi ih nadogradila i omogućila razvojnim programerima da postanu kreativniji i osmisle napredne prilagođene značajke.\n\nS pametnim ugovorima koji su dostupni unutar platforme Subsocial, zajednici se pruža mogućnost da stvori vlastite SoFi primitive koji se mogu sastaviti, slične onima iz DeFi prostora. Tijekom Hackusama-e, tim Subsocial počeo je graditi primitive kao što su napojnice i plaćene pretplate koje će biti dostupne tijekom pokretanja. Nadamo se da ćemo tijekom vremena izvođenja dodati NFT-ove i pay-per-view značajku.\n\nDruštveni tokeni\n\nTokenizirajte svoj Subsocial prostor društvenim tokenima kako biste izgradili i unovčili svoj prostor. Vaši pratitelji mogu postati suvlasnici prostora i, ako žele, sudjelovati u upravljanju. Suvlasnički prostor u svojoj je suštini DAO. To je nešto čega ćemo se dotaknuti u kasnijem odjeljku.\n\nUgrađeni AMM DEX za društvene tokene, koji je prilagođen platformi Subsocial, omogućit će korisnicima da lako razmjenjuju društvene tokene bez da moraju brinuti o tome trebaju li pokušati prodavati vlastite tokene i prebacivati njihovo vlasništvo s jedne osobe na drugu.\n\nS obzirom na snagu platforme Polkadot, vašim ćete tokenima moći trgovati i razmjenjivati ih za DOT, KSM i ostale društvene parachain tokene, uključujući i stabilne coine poput onih koje razvijaju Acala i Bandot.\n\nStabilni coini\n\nVažno je imati izvor prihoda (napojnice, plaćene pretplate) koji ne ovisi o ekstremnoj volatilnosti karakterističnoj za kriptovalute. Kao što je spomenuto u prethodnom pododjeljku, to će biti lako uz platformu Polkadot.\n\nUloge i dopuštenja\n\nPlatforma Subsocial izvorno nudi četiri ugrađene i dinamičke uloge. Vlasnici prostora mogu utvrditi i zatim dinamički ažurirati ulogu za bilo koji Subsocial račun, kao i odrediti koja su dopuštenja povezana s tom ulogom.\n\nU nastavku su navedene četiri ugrađene uloge:\n\nUloga\nOpis\nNitko\nBilo koji račun na Subsocial blockchainu\nSvatko\nNijedan račun\nPratitelj\nBilo koji račun koji prati konkretni prostor\nVlasnik prostora\nTrenutni vlasnik konkretnog prostora\n\nUloge mogu imati različita dopuštenja prema želji vlasnika prostora ili moderatora prostora. Kao i kod drugih platformi društvenih mreža, važno je definirati dopuštenja uzimajući u obzir sljedeća pitanja:\n\nTko može kreirati objave i pisati komentare unutar prostora?\nJe li moguće urediti objavu ili komentar?\nJe li moguće izbrisati objavu ili komentar?\nJe li moguće glasati za objavu, protiv nje ili ju podijeliti?\n... i još mnogo toga.\n\nPrimjer: prostor nalik platformi Twitter\n\nNa primjer, ako želite svoj prostor učiniti sličnim platformi Twitter, u njega biste trebali implementirati sljedeće dozvole:\n\nU konkretnom prostoru samo vlasnik može pisati objave\nOnemogućivanje uređivanja objava i komentara\nOnemogućivanje negativnih glasova\n\nUloge i dopuštenja omogućuju da prostor bude fleksibilan, osoban te da definira preciznu kontrolu pristupa. To vam pomaže u upravljanju prostorom kada on predstavlja skupinu ljudi kao što je zajednica, organizacija ili tim.\n\nModeriranje\n\nJedna tema koja je važna za decentralizirani tehnološki ekosustav upravljanje je njegovim moderiranjem. Platforma Subsocial odupire se cenzuri ne blokirajući sadržaj na temeljnoj razini (na lancu). No isto tako razumijemo kako je nužno da vam pružimo mogućnost moderiranja vašeg osobnog prostora kako biste mogli ukloniti nepovezani sadržaj i trolane objave te urediti neprikladan sadržaj.\n\nJedinstveni skup moderacijskih pravila koji je primjerice prisutan na platformi Twitter previše je strog i tjera sve korisnike da usvoje iste perspektive kako bi izbjegli cenzuru. Moderiranje po prostoru znači \"vaš prostor, vaša pravila\". Ovim pravilima upravlja lanac. Osim toga, moguće je modificirati korisničko sučelje kako bi se omogućila veća kontrola nad prikazanim sadržajem.\n\nRazličiti prostori mogu imati različita moderacijska pravila, ali svi dijele isti blockchain. Platforma Subsocial ljepilo je koje povezuje sve prostore.\n\nProstori kao DAO-i\n\nFunkcionalnost koju pružaju moduli iz značajke Uloge i dopuštenja podsjeća na karakteristike DAO-a. To jest, prostor na platformi Subsocial može funkcionirati poput DAO-a. Platforma Subsocial dozvoljava više vlasnika (putem višestrukog potpisa) koji mogu kontrolirati i unovčavati sadržaj.\n\nSvaki prostor može imati svoj vlastiti token, stoga se vlasništvo nad prostorom može predstaviti kao udio u tokenu prostora. Slično tomu, svaki se prostor može razvijati vlastitim mehanizmom upravljanja (uključujući upravljanje vlasnika tokena). Kao rezultat toga, svaki prostor može imati vlastiti trezor koji kontroliraju njegovi vlasnici tokena.\n\nUpravljanje se može koristiti za modificiranje dozvola unutar prostora, uloga, odabir moderatora te čak za kolektivno donošenje odluka o tome kako blokirati neželjeni sadržaj.\n\nKako bi se olakšalo trgovanje tokenima unutar različitih prostora, tokeni će se prvo moći zamijeniti za Subsocial tokene.\n\nSkalabilnost\n\nPlatforma Subsocial omogućuje zajednicama da kreiraju vlastiti prostor povrh Subsocial lanca, tako da sve zajednice dijele isti temeljni blockchain. To pruža zajedničke mrežne efekte: korisnici će se jednostavno moći pridružiti bilo kojoj zajednici na bilo kojem alternativnom klijentu na platformi Subsocial. Osim toga, svatko s Polkadot ili Kusama adresom može se lako pridružiti Subsocial zajednici.\n\nMogućnost nadogradnje\n\nSupstrat omogućuje besprijekornu nadogradnju blockchaina bez tvrdog račvanja (hard fork). Na platformama Polkadot i Kusami već smo svjedočili provedbi nadogradnje vez tvrdog račvanja. Isti mehanizmi upravljanja i nadogradnje na lancu dostupni su za sve blockchaine temeljene na Supstratu.\n\nOvaj pristup blockchain tehnologiji savršen je za platformu Subsocial. Vjerujemo da nije moguće znati sve unaprijed. Funkcionalnost i parametri platforme u potpunosti će se morati mijenjati kada članovi zajednice pronađu bugove ili kada dođe vrijeme za provedbu neophodnih poboljšanja.\n\nMogućnost prilagodbe\n\nU svojoj srži naš je softver otvorenog koda i modularnog dizajna. Platforma Subsocial omogućuje gotovo potpuno prilagođavanje potrebama zajednice. Ovo je, nadamo se, očito iz prethodnih odjeljaka, ali nije na odmet upoznati se s brojnim načinima na koje se naš softver može koristiti:\n\nPrilagodba korisničkog sučelja putem našeg alata JS SDK\nImplementacija pametnih ugovora za nove metode unovčavanja\nNasljeđivanje značajki iz drugih prostora\nPrigođavanje upravljačkih procesa unutar konkretnog prostora\nModeriranje sadržaja u skladu s željema publike\nPokretanje vlastitog lanca pomoću našeg otvorenog koda\n\nMeđulančana interakcija s para-lancima\n\nJedan od najuzbudljivijih aspekata platforme Polkadot sposobnost je da jedan para-lanac bez prethodne provjere stupa u interakciju s drugim. To također znači da bi se bilo koji token s platforme Polkadot mogao koristiti za plaćanja na platformi Subsocial. Primarni interes za ovakvu vrstu transakcije vjerojatno će iskazati osobe koje pretplatu žele platiti koristeći se DOT, KSM, ACA ili izvornim SubSocial tokenima.\n\nUpravljanje\n\nU prethodnom smo odjeljku opisali kako vlasnici prostora na raspolaganju imaju nekoliko mogućnosti za upravljanje vlastitim prostorom. Upravljanje prostorom pokušali smo učiniti što fleksibilnijim kako bismo ga prilagodili zahtjevima vlasnika.\n\nOsim toga, na Subsocial para-lancu također postoji upravljački sloj. Baš kao što je to slučaj na platformi Polkadot, vlasnici Subsocial tokena moći će glasati o prijedlozima koji se pojavljuju na lancu.\n\nUpravitelji lanca odlučit će na koji će se način lanac nadograđivati i kako će se trošiti novac iz trezora. Nadogradnje mogu postati novi moduli koji pružaju nove funkcionalnosti za sve prostore i koji odlučuju bi li se platforma Subsocial trebala integrirati s ostalim društvenim mrežama.\n\nTrezor\n\nTrezor platforme Subsocial skup je tokena na razini lanca koji se mogu potrošiti na prijedloge koje su iznijeli članovi zajednice u svrhu daljnjeg napretka projekta i njegovog ekosustava. Prema našim predviđanjima, trezor bi trebao sponzorirati razvoj lanca, stvaranje različitih web i mobilnih aplikacija, alternativnih algoritama povezanih s prikazom tekućeg sadržaja, rast zajednice i marketing.\n\nU usporedbi s, recimo, trezorom platforme Kusama, postoji jedna značajka za koju nam se čini da se može poboljšati. Naša bi platforma trebala imati tri vijeća koja će upravljati gore navedenim rashodima trezora. Svako vijeće u idealnom će slučaju biti sastavljeno od stručnjaka iz konkretne domene: tehnologije, UX-a i marketinga.\n\nBudućnost verzije 1.0\n\nU ovom odjeljku ćemo razmotriti moguće značajke koje bi mogle postati dio budućih verzija platforme Subsocial.\n\nPay-Per-View\n\nZnačajka koju trenutno istražujemo je Pay-Per-View (PPV). Preliminarno istraživanje pokazalo je da bi se ta značajka mogla implementirati korištenjem pouzdanog okruženja za izvršavanje, sličnom onomu iz projekta SubstraTEE.\n\nTrgovina za algoritme društvenog umrežavanja\n\nObjave, tweetovi i novosti koje ispunjavaju izvor tekućih vijesti na najpopularnijim web stranicama za društveno umrežavanje kontroliraju nevidljivi algoritmi koji imaju ogroman utjecaj na naš život. Milijarde ljudi koristi društvene mreže kojima upravlja nekoliko ogromnih korporacija, ali nitko ne može vidjeti kako algoritam funkcionira niti odabrati prikladniji algoritam koji odgovara ukusima korisnika. To vrijedi za platforme YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Medium i, prema našem mišljenju, za sve ostale platforme društvenih mreža na Webu 2.0.\n\nFiltriranje informacija svojevrsna je moć koju te tvrtke imaju nad nama. Njihovi algoritmi osmišljeni su i stalno se poboljšavaju radi njihove zarade, a ne zbog sadržaja koji bi nas najviše zanimao. Sličan problem ogleda se i u filtriranju oglasa. Postoji ravnoteža između količine oglasa po sesiji korisnika i ogorčenosti korisnika u slučaju da je tijekom sesije prikazano previše oglasa. Još jednom ponavljamo, ovi algoritmi nisu javni.\n\nOsmislili smo način na koji možemo riješiti taj problem: trgovinu za algoritme koji popunjavaju izvor tekućih vijesti. Time bismo korisnicima omogućili da biraju između različitih algoritama filtriranja, tako da se sadržaj u korisničkom sučelju može pojaviti redoslijedom koji najbolje odgovara željama korisnika. Ako se pokaže da jedan algoritam ne radi, može se zamijeniti drugim.\n\nNapredno moderiranje\n\nJedan od proizvoda skaliranja saznanje je da bi velika zajednica mogla imati puno iskustva s kvalitetnim moderiranjem i održavanjem blokiranog sadržaja. U prostoru koji je posvećen djeci, važno je blokirati sadržaj koji se smatra krajnje nepoželjnim.\n\nNa drugom kraju skale mogu biti tisuće malih zajednica koje imaju samo jednog moderatora ili nemaju isto iskustvo ili nemaju vremena pratiti najnoviji sadržaj koji treba blokirati.\n\nOvaj se problem može riješiti tako da se zajednicama omogući nasljeđivanje načina moderiranja iz većeg prostora unutar platforme Subsocial. To će rasteretiti manje zajednice i omogućiti učinkovito upravljanje neželjenim sadržajem.\n\nRazdijeljena reputacija\n\nJedan od ključnih mehanizama koji gradimo raspoređivanje je reputacije po prostoru i oznaci. Usporedite ovo s platformom Reddit koja ima samo jedan sustav reputacije: umjesto konkretne reputacije za određeni subreddit, ova platforma nudi opću reputaciju za cijelu web stranicu. Ova generička karma (ugled) ne pokazuje gdje je korisnik točno stekao reputaciju. Stručnjaci za financijska tržišta vjerojatno nisu stručnjaci za, recimo, nogomet i kirurgiju.\n\nReputacijski sustav koji mi planiramo uvesti nalik je sustavu razdijeljene reputacije s platforme Stack Overflow (Stack Exchange). Ovaj pristup omogućuje napredne značajke oslanjajući se na vašu konkretnu reputaciju:\n\nPrilikom glasanja u anketi, vaša reputacija po prostoru može se koristiti za ponderiranje vašeg glasa.\nPrilikom sudjelovanja u izazovu ili natjecanju s poticajem, reputacija u određenom prostoru može se koristiti kao koeficijent za određivanje udjela u nagradi. Pravedne nagrade zahtijevaju konkretnu reputaciju.\n\nS obzirom na prilagodbu koja je omogućena pametnim ugovorima, prostori bi mogli proširiti ili nadjačati sustav reputacije ugrađen u osnovni lanac. Vlasnici prostora ili članovi njihove zajednice mogu stvoriti alternativne formule za izračunavanje reputacije i načina na koji se ona koristi.\n\nEkonomija tokena\n\nEkonomija tokena i njihova distribucija\n\nEkonomija tokena (\"tokenomija\") definira upotrebu tokena, uključujući čimbenike koji određuju njihovu ponudu i potražnju.\n\nDistribucija tokena početna je raspodjela sudionika u bloku geneze (tj. tko posjeduje koliki postotak tokena pri pokretanju mreže).\n\nPotražnja – tko želi posjedovati Subsocial tokene?\n\nSudionici unutar Subsocial ekosustava morat će pribaviti Subsocial tokene kako bi izvršili radnje. Sljedeći popis prikazuje tipične grupe ljudi koji će potraživati tokene.\n\nZa plaćanje transakcija kao i za ulaganje ili ostvarivanje prava na besplatne transakcije, korisnici trebaju posjedovati tokene.\nKorisnici koji su ujedno i autori sadržaja posjedovanjem tokena ostvaruju pravo da njihov sadržaj bude postavljen kao prioritet (u određenom smislu, ovdje se radi o \"marketingu\")\nLjudi koji žele sudjelovati u upravljanju (ovako se oblikuje razvoj Subsocial ekosustava na decentraliziran način).\nPravo na pristup posebnom sadržaju (posebnim prostorima)\nZa pokretanje validacijskog čvora na para-lancu kolatorima su potrebni tokeni.\nKorisnici koji žele kupiti token konkretnog prostora to mogu učiniti isključivo pomoću glavnih Subsocial token\n\nPonuda – koga će mreža nagraditi?\n\nPostoje određeni sudionici unutar mreže koji obavljaju vitalne funkcije za održavanje integriteta i dostupnosti mreže, stoga će takvi sudionici biti nagrađeni Subsocial tokenima. Ovdje se radi o obliku inflacije isplaćene iz bloka s nagradama.\n\nKolatori (oni koji proizvode blokove na Subsocial lancu)\nTrezor\nSudionici u PLO-u (korisnici koji polažu sigurnosni depozit za aukciju na para-lancu)\n\nRazmotrili smo i pitanje trebaju li sljedeći akteri koji su dio našeg ekosustava biti nagrađeni izvornim Subsocial tokenima, s naglaskom da ti akteri kreiraju svoje vlastite tokene unutar platforme Subsocial. To znači da će prostori unutar platforme Subsocial odabrati kako će nagraditi sljedeće aktere:\n\nAutore sadržaja\nIzdavače\nInfluencere\nModeratore\n\nKorisnost tokena\n\nGlavni token pogodan je za niz različitih upotreba koje ćemo opisati u nastavku. Glavna svrha tokena omogućiti je autorima da svoj sadržaj unovče na različite načine. Imajte na umu da su neke od ovih značajki još u razvoju.\n\nTransakcije\nUnovčavanje sadržaja\nNapojnice\nPretplata\nProdaja i najam prostora\nImplementacija pametnih ugovora\nImplementacija novih tokena (npr. Tokena prostora ili društvenih tokena)\nGlasanje u upravljanju (za dodatne pojedinosti pogledajte Lightpaper)\n\nDistribucija tokena\n\nPočetna distribucija\n\nPrilikom pokretanja Subsocial blockchaina očekujemo da će tokeni biti distribuirani na sljedeći način.\n\n10% - privatna prodaja tokena (15-25% tokena od navedenih 10% bit će otključeno tijekom TGE-a, s razdobljem stjecanja prava od 2 godine)\n25% - tim i savjetnici (bez otključavanja za vrijeme TGE-a, s razdobljem stjecanja prava duljim od 2 godine)\n65% - razvoj ekosustava:\n25% Kusama PLO\n15% razvojne potpore\n10% marketing\n5% autori sadržaja\n5% kolatori\n5% airdropovi za postojeće zajednice: Polkadot, Kusama, Steem, Hive\n\nTGE = Događaj generiranja tokena. Radi se o događaju koji uključuje početno kreiranje tokena koji će se održati nakon pokretanja mreže Subsocial.\n\nKovanje tokena (poslije njihova stvaranja)\n\nNakon što mreža krene s radom, započinje proizvodnja novih blokova s tokenima koji će kao nagrada biti proslijeđeni važnim sudionicima mreže. Ovaj postupak predstavlja oblik inflacije tokena.\n\nPrema našem planu, u prvoj godini neće biti inflacije tokena zato što će nagrade za ključne sudionike biti uključenje u početni blok. U ovom slučaju, ključni sudionici su kolatori i sudionici u PLO-u.\n\nOd druge godine planiramo krenuti s inflacijom po stopi od 10% (od ukupne ponude). Parametri se mogu prilagoditi kako bi odražavali tržišne uvjete. Moramo osigurati da inflacija ne odvrati nove ljude od pridruživanja ekosustavu, ali da bude dovoljno visoka da nagradi određene važne sudionike za obavljanje potrebnih funkcija (kolatori).\n\nUkupni iznos inflacije tijekom godine mogao bi se rasporediti u sljedećim iznosima (ovi se brojevi mogu mijenjati od strane upravljačke strukture):\n\n25% za kolatore (i nominatore)?\n25% za trezor\n25% za autore sadržaja\n25% za nagradni fond budućih PLO-a\n\nTrezor\n\nPlatforma Subsocial slijedit će postupke platformi Polkadot i Kusama implementacijom trezora na lanac koji kontroliraju vlasnici tokena. Planiramo imati dva vijeća, jedno tehničko, a drugo usmjereno na rast ekosustava.\n\nNismo donijeli konačnu odluku o tome kada će se pokrenuti upravljanje na lancu (a time i trezor).\n\nKao što je gore navedeno, plan nam je da trezor primi 25% inflacijskih nagrada.\n\nPara-lanac i para-nit\n\nLanac razvijen sa sustavom Supstrate u različitim trenucima svog života može poprimiti jedno od tri stanja: neovisni lanac s osiguranim mostom, para-lanac ili para-nit. (izvor)\n\nPlatforma Subsocial planira biti para-lanac platforme Kusama, a ako to bude uspješno provedeno, onda ćemo razmotriti i pokretanje para-lanca za proširenje Polkadot, ali ne možemo jamčiti da će se to dogoditi.\n\nAko platforma Subsocial ne bude uspjela pokrenuti para-lanac, razmotrit ćemo pokretanje para-niti. U tom se slučaju neće generirati tokeni za korisnike koji su željeli sudjelovati u PLO-u (jer akcija nije uspjela).\n\nKao para-nit, trebali bismo kupiti KSM ili DOT tokene kako bismo platili uključivanje bloka. Za pokrivanje ovog troška, jedna od opcija bila bi prodaja našeg izvornog tokena unutar lanca.\n\nResursi\n\nAcala Token Economy Paper <https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala-white-paper/blob/master/Acala_Token_Economy_Paper.pdf>\nSubsocial Lightpaper (Monetization)\nPolkadot Parathreads <https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/ru/learn-parathreads>\n\nČesto postavljana pitanja\n\nŠto je Subsocial?\n\nPlatforma Subsocial skup je Substrate paleta s internet korisničkim sučeljem koje svakome omogućuje pokretanje vlastite decentralizirane društvene mreže ili zajednice. Platforma Subsocial nije decentralizirana društvena mreža, poput Twittera ili Facebooka, već platforma za izgradnju društvenih mreža.\n\nOdakle potječe ime platforme?\n\nPlatforma Subsocial bit će temeljna arhitektura na kojoj se grade društvene mreže budućnosti. Prefiks Sub odnosi se na dvije stvari:\n\nPlatforma Subsocial bit će osnovni sloj koji podržava sve društvene mreže izgrađene na njemu\nPlatforma Subsocial izgrađena je na tehnologiji Substrate\n\nJe li platforma Subsocial para-lanac platformi Kusama ili Polkadot?\n\nTrenutno ne, ali u budućnosti planiramo licitirati za para-lančani utor, vjerojatno na platformi Kusama. Najveća prepreka trenutno je činjenica da para-lančani blokovima trenutno treba previše vremena za pružanje kvalitetnog korisničkog iskustva na platformi Subsocial.\n\nNa koji se način platforma Subsocial može usporediti s platformama Facebook, Twitter, Instagram itd.?\n\nBudući da platforma Subsocial nije društvena mreža, već platforma za izgradnju društvenih mreža, ovdje se radi o usporedbi krušaka i jabuka. Međutim, društvene mreže izgrađene na platformi Subsocial imat će brojne prednosti u usporedbi s društvenim mrežama Webu 2.0 kao što su decentralizacija, otpor cenzuri, višestruke mogućnosti decentralizirane monetizacije (bez posrednika koji mogu uzeti svoj dio) i razne druge prednosti rada na blockchainu.\nKoje su prednosti izgradnje zajednice na platformi Subsocial?\n\nZbog nekih od gore navedenih značajki, platforma Subsocial omogućit će vam stvaranje puno živahnije i uključenije zajednice. Koristeći društvene tokene i značajke decentraliziranog upravljanja, članovi zajednice moći će postati sudionici na do sada nikada viđen način. Budući da platforma Subsocial predstavlja protokol otporan na cenzuru, ne postoji središnje tijelo koje može kontrolirati vašu zajednicu. Umjesto toga, sama zajednica može odrediti vlastitu moderaciju i pravila članstva.\n\nKoje su prednosti korištenja platforme Subsocial za korisnike?\n\nNa tradicionalnim društvenim mrežama većina korisnika nikada ne prima nikakvu naknadu za vrijednost koju pružaju mreži. S društvenim mrežama izgrađenim na platformi Subsocial, korisnici će zapravo moći ostvariti korist od sadržaja koji proizvode, i to putem različitih metoda unovčavanja, kao što su napojnice, pretplate, društveni tokeni, prodaja oglasnog prostora i još mnogo toga. Uz to što će sadržavati trgovinu algoritmima, platforma Subsocial svojim će korisnicima pružiti kontrolu nad sadržajem koji im je dostupan.\n\nNije mi u potpunosti jasno kako koristiti platformu Subsocial. Što mogu učiniti?\n\nPlatforma Subsocial još uvijek je u beta fazi, no naš tim radi na poboljšanju korisničkog sučelja i iskustva. Ako imate bilo kakvih pitanja, obratite nam se na čavrljanju unutar platformi Telegram ili Discord.\n\nHoće li se održati IDO?\n\nU ovom trenutko to nam nije u planu.\n\nHoće li se održati IEO?\n\nTim trenutno istražuje IEO-a, no još uvijek nije ništa nije objavljeno. Za sve najnovije informacije, pratite naš kanal s najavama.\n\nPostoji li način za dobivanje besplatnih tokena koji bi se koristili na platformi Subsocial?\n\nBesplatan token iz našeg fonda možete dobiti nakon što ispunite kratku anketu.\n\nKako mogu kupiti Subsocial tokene?\n\nSubsocial tokeni trenutno se ne mogu kupiti.\n\nKako glasi naziv Subsocial tokena?\n\nNaziv tokena glasi SUB.\n\nKoji je ukupni broj tokena dostupnih u ponudi?\n\nU ponudi se nalazi ukupno 100 milijuna tokena.\n\nDa li je SUB ERC20 token?\n\nNe. platforma Subsocial ima svoj vlastiti izvorni token izgrađen na Substrate blockchain okviru. Naš token koristi istu tehnologiju kao tokeni DOT, KSM, KAR i ostali tokeni lanaca temeljenih na tehnologiji Supstrate.\n\nGdje mogu pogledati pametne ugovore platforme Subsocial?\n\nNa platformi Subsocial ne postoje pametni ugovori, jer je izgrađena kao prilagođeni blockchain utemeljen na Substrate blockchain okviru. Subsocial blockchain optimiziran je za operacije povezane s radom društvenih mreža i ima vrlo niske naknade.\n\nImate li lightpaper?\n\nSubsocial Lightpaper\n\nGdje se mogu upoznati s ekonomijom tokena platforme Subsocial?\n\nEkonomija tokena platforme Subsocial\n\nKako mogu započeti s korištenjem platforme Subsocial?\n\nU svom pregledniku instalirajte proširenje Polkadot.js. Ovo proširenje omogućuje vam potpisivanje transakcija u Subsocial blockchainu. Slično je pregledniku MetaMask (proširenje preglednika za Ethereum).\n\nU pregledniku Chrome, instalirajte putem Chrome web store\nU pregledniku Firefox, instalirajte putem Firefox add-ons\n\nNakon što ste instalirali proširenje Polkadot, kreirajte (ili uvezite) svoj račun kako biste se putem ove poveznice mogli prijaviti na Subsocial web dapp (decentraliziranu aplikaciju). Da biste koristili decentraliziranu aplikaciju, trebat će vam Subsocial tokeni, stoga posjetite našu fond za tokene.\n\nMogu li platformu Subsocial koristiti na mobilnom uređaju?\n\nObjave i komentare možete čitati na mobilnim uređajima. S mobilnih uređaja trenutno nije moguće objavljivati, komentirati, davati pozitivne/negativne glasove, dijeliti ili pratiti zato što naš trenutna web decentralizirana aplikacija zahtijeva proširenje Polkadot.js za potpisivanje transakcija, a moderni mobilni preglednici (kao što su Chrome i Firefox) ne podržavaju proširenje. Naša mobilna aplikacija u fazi je razvoja.\n\nPostoji li egzistencijalni depozit na platformi Subsocial?\n\nEgzistencijalni depozit na betanetu trenutno iznosi 0,1 SUB. Ovaj se iznos može promijeniti u budućnosti ovisno o ukupnoj ekonomiji tokena platforme Subsocial.\n\nImam problema s proširenjem Polkadot{.js}. Što da napravim?\n\nMoj se račun ne prikazuje ispravno\n\nJoš jednom provjerite je li vaše proširenje povezano s web decentraliziranom aplikacijom. Ako je povezano, probajte osvježiti stranicu.\n\nNe vidim nove račune iz proširenja Polkadot.js\n\nAko ne vidite nove Polkadot{.js} račune na web decentraliziranoj aplikaciji u gornjem desnom kutu, pokušajte se odjaviti i zatim ponovno učitajte stranicu i ponovno se prijavite.\n\nPonovno sam učitao stranicu, ali nije pomoglo\n\nPreporučamo ponovno učitavanje stranice s čišćenjem predmemorije (Ctrl+F5 u većini preglednika).\n\nMoja transakcija nije uspješno provedena\n\nU većini slučajeva, ponovno učitavanje stranice unutar Subsocial web decentralizirane aplikacije trebalo bi riješiti vaš problem. Ako i dalje imate problema sa slanjem transakcija (prilikom praćenja prostora, kreiranja objave ili komentara, glasovanja, itd.), prijavite to na jednom od naših službenih čavrljanja (po mogućnosti glavno čavrljanje na engleskom jeziku).\n\nKoje su službene društvene poveznice?\n\nSve naše najvažnije poveznice dostupne su ovdje.\n\nČavrljanja na platformi Telegram\n\nEngleski (glavno čavrljanje): <https://t.me/Subsocial>\n中文 (kineski): <https://t.me/SubsocialChinese>\n日本語 (japanski): <https://t.me/SubsocialJapanese>\nEspañol (španjolski): <https://t.me/SubsocialSpanish>\nFrançais (francuski): <https://t.me/joinchat/8Amh4naeRLAyMzYy>\nItaliano (talijanski): <https://t.me/SubsocialItalian>\nРусский (ruski): <https://t.me/SubsocialRussian>\nTiếng-Việt (vijetnamski): <https://t.me/SubsocialVietnam>\nTürkçe (turski): <https://t.me/SubsocialTurkish>\nDeutsch (njemački): <https://t.me/SubsocialGerman>\n\nPostoji li ikakva dokumentacija o ugovorima, privatnosti ili pravnom statusu?\n\nUvjeti korištenja\n\nPravilnik o privatnosti\n\nPotraživanje tokena od strane vlasnika DOT/KSM tokena\n\nKada je napravljena snimka zaslona koja prikazuje bilancu DOT i KSM tokena?\n\nNapravljene su dvije snimke zaslona za tokene Polkadot i Kusama. Jedna 15. travnja 2021., a druga 21. svibnja 2021.\n\nOvdje se nalazi snimka zaslona od 15. travnja za DOT, ovdje snimka zaslona od 21. svibnja za DOT, ovdje se nalazi snimka zaslona od 15. travnja za KSM i ovdje se nalazi snimka zaslona od 21. svibnja za KSM.\n\nKada će sudionici koji ispunjavaju uvjete moći zatražiti svoje Subsocial tokene?\n\nDatum još nije objavljen. Za sve najnovije informacije pratite naš kanal s najavama.\n\nPotraživanje tokena za vlasnike Uptrennd (1UP) tokena\n\nKada je napravljena snimka zaslona koja prikazuje bilancu 1UP tokena?\n\nSnimka zaslona koja prikazuje bilancu 1UP tokena napravljena je 4. svibnja 2021.\n\nKada će sudionici koji ispunjavaju uvjete moći zatražiti svoje Subsocial tokene?\n\nDatum još nije objavljen. Za sve najnovije informacije pratite naš kanal s najavama.\n\nKako platforma Subsocial pohranjuje sadržaj i podatke korisnika?\n\nPlatforma Subsocial koristi InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) za pohranu sadržaja korisnika. Da biste saznali više o tome kako se IPFS uklapa u Subsocial sustav, pogledajte ovaj članak.\n\nČesto postavljana pitanja o potraživanju tokena\n\nKoji računi ispunjavaju uvjete za potraživanje tokena?\n\nPrihvatljivost se temelji na dvama snimkama zaslona od 15. travnja i 21. svibnja 2021. godine koje prikazuju vlasnike DOT i KSM tokena. Da bi ispunjavao uvjete, račun mora imati najmanje 1 DOT token tijekom obje snimke zaslona ili najmanje 0,1 KSM tijekom obje snimke zaslona.\n\n1. rujna napravili smo snimku zaslona koja prikazuje sve račune koji su sudjelovali u bilo kojoj od pobjedničkih crowdloan kampanja do tog datuma (Karura, Moonbeam, Khala, Shiden, Bifrost, KILT, Basilisk i Calamari). Svi računi sadržani u ovoj snimci također ispunjavaju uvjete, međutim, doprinosi za crowdloan kampanju moraju biti izvršeni putem proširenja Polkadot.js. Stanje novčanika na burzama i doprinosi za crowdloan kampanju izvršeni putem burzi ili web-mjesta trećih strana kao što su Zenlink ili Bifrost-ov SALP ne ispunjavaju uvjete.\n\nZašto postoji nekoliko krugova potraživanja tokena?\n\nSubsocial zajednica rasprostranjena je po cijelom svijetu. Budući da smo vodili računa o različitim vremenskim zonama i radnom vremenu, zahtjeve za potraživanje tokena podijelili smo u nekoliko krugova koji će se odvijati u različitim vremenskim okvirima.\n\nMogu li zatražiti tokene iz novčanika Polkawallet/Fearless/Trust?\n\nNe. Trenutačno nijedan mobilni novčanik ne podržava platformu Subsocial, što je u potpunosti izvan naše kontrole. Međutim, služeći se preglednikom na stolnom računalu svoj račun možete uvesti u Polkadot.js koristeći početnu frazu, što će vam omogućiti da zatražite svoje tokene.\n\nDa biste pronašli početnu fazu na Fearless novčaniku napravite sljedeće: idite na Postavke > Računi > Informacije > Izvezi\n\nDa biste pronašli početnu fazu na Polkawallet novčaniku napravite sljedeće: idite na Profil > Upravljanje računom > Izvoz računa > Mnemoniraj\n\nDa biste pronašli početnu fazu na Trust novčaniku napravite sljedeće: idite na Postavke > Novčanici > Kliknite na 3 točke na novčaniku koji želite zatražiti > Prikaži frazu za oporavak\n\nMogu li zatražiti tokene sa Ledger računa?\n\nNe. Ledger trenutno ne podržava platformu Subsocial, što je u potpunosti izvan naše kontrole. Međutim, ako imate početnu frazu na svom Ledger računu, služeći se preglednikom na stolnom računalu svoj račun možete uvesti u Polkadot.js koristeći početnu frazu, što će vam omogućiti da zatražite svoje tokene.\n\nMogu li potraživanje izvršiti sa svog telefona?\n\nDa. Pogledajte vodič koji je dostupan ovdje.\n\nVeć sam zatražio tokene. Mogu li ih zatražiti opet?\n\nSvaki račun koji ispunjava uvjete potraživanje može izvršiti samo jednom. Na primjer, ako je račun koji ispunjava uvjete podnio zahtjev tijekom 1. kruga, tokene ne može potraživati tijekom 2., 3. ili 4. kruga. Ako imate više računa koji ispunjavaju uvjete, potraživanje ćete moći izvršiti samo jednom za svaki račun koji ispunjava uvjete.\n\nDao sam svoj doprinos u crowdloan kampanji, zašto ne ispunjavam uvjete?\n\nPrihvaćamo samo doprinose koji su izvršeni prije 24. rujna i to putem proširenja Polkadot.js. Bilo koji doprinos crowdloan kampanji izvršen putem burze bit će označen neprihvatljivim. Svi doprinosi crowdloan kampanji izvršeni putem drugih web stranica, kao što su Zenlink ili Bifrost-ov SALP, neće biti prihvaćeni.\n\nMoje se proširenje Polkadot.js ne može povezati s web stranicom. Što nije u redu?\n\nAko imate problema s povezivanjem, slijedite sljedeće korake:\n\nProvjerite je li na vašem Polkadot.js računu uključena značajka \"Dopusti upotrebu na bilo kojem lancu\"\nProvjerite jeste li dopustili mreži app.subsocial.network pristup vašem Polkadot.js računu\nAžurirajte svoje meta podatke\nIsključite AdBlock\nPonovno učitajte stranicu (to učinite samo jednom - nemojte ponovno učitavati stranicu više puta).\n\nTrebam li posjedovati DOT, KSM ili SUB tokene da bih izvršio potraživanje?\n\nNe. Transakcije potraživanja tokena besplatne su za sve račune koji ispunjavaju uvjete.\n\nŠto su SUB tokeni? Što mogu učiniti s njima?\n\nSUB tokeni izvorni su tokeni Subsocial blockchaina i koriste se za interakciju s mrežom. glavna mreža platforme Subsocial još nije pokrenuta, ali naša je beta mreža aktivna i nudi funkcionalan proizvod. Svoje SUB tokene možete koristiti za stvaranje prostora, kreiranje objave postova i interakciju s drugim članovima na platformi Subsocial, tako da ih pratite, komentirate i glasate za njihove objave. Drugim ćete korisnicima u budućnosti moći slati napojnice u obliku SUB tokena i još mnogo toga. Platforma  Subsocial radi na poboljšanju interakcije s korisnicima, zbog čega svojim korisnicima i pruža mogućnost potraživanja tokena.\n\nNa platformi Subsocial možete kreirati svoj vlastiti prostor i profil.\n\nŠto će se dogoditi s mojim tokenima kada se pokrene glavna mreža?\n\nVećina tokena bit će prebačena s beta mreže na glavnu mrežu, a većina korisnika će imati isti saldo tokena kao i na beta mreži.\n\nU kojem će vremenskom okviru biti otvoreni sljedeći krugovi potraživanja tokena?\n\n1. krug započet će u 5h UTC+0 u četvrtak, 7. listopada 2021. Početak 3. i 4. kruga bit će objavljen naknadno.\n\nČesto postavljana pitanja o potraživanju tokena putem mobitela\n\nMogu li svoje tokene zatražiti putem mobitela?\n\nMožete. Ali budući da trenutno nema mobilnih novčanika koji podržavaju platformu Subsocial, morat ćete koristiti mobilni web-preglednik koji podržava web proširenja, a samim time i proširenje Polkadot.js. Yandex je trenutno jedini mobilni preglednik koji podržava proširenja. Morate instalirati preglednik Yandex sa slovom\"Я\" na crvenoj pozadini, jer proširenje Polkadot.js ne radi stabilno u klasičnom pregledniku Yandex. Preuzmite ga ovdje.\n\nSada trebamo instalirati proširenje Polkadot.js. Otvorite preglednik Yandex. Slijedite ovu poveznicu i kliknite na gumb Preuzmi za Chrome (ova će značajka raditi u pregledniku Yandex). Ova vas poveznica prebacuje u trgovinu Chrome. Pritisnite gumb \"Instaliraj\" i ponovno potvrdite pritiskom na gumb \"Instaliraj proširenje\".\n\nZatim trebamo uvesti račun s kojeg želimo izvršiti potraživanje, koristeći JSON datoteku ili mnemoničku početnu frazu. Otvorite već instalirano proširenje Polkadot.js. Nova kartica s ekstenzijom trebala se otvoriti automatski nakon instalacije proširenja Polkadot.js. Ako se to nije dogodilo, idite na stranicu i kliknite \"Prijava\" u gornjem desnom kutu - proširenje će se otvoriti u novoj kartici. Na zaslonu ćete vidjeti pozdravnu poruku. Pritisnite \"Razumijem, pusti me da nastavim\".\n\nNaš račun (putem kojeg želimo zatražiti tokene) potom moramo uvesti u mobilno proširenje. Ako račun uvozite putem početne fraze, kliknite na \"+\" u gornjem desnom kutu zaslona i odaberite \"Vrati račun iz sigurnosne kopije JSON datoteke\" ili \"Uvezi račun iz već postojeće početne faze\". Zatim u retku \"sigurnosna kopija datoteke\" odaberite svoju JSON datoteku (ako je nemate, možete je izvesti iz novčanika koji koristite, npr. Mathwallet), u redak \"lozinka\" unesite trenutnu lozinku (ne novu lozinku!). Ako svoj račun uvezete pomoću početne fraze, morat ćete unijeti početnu frazu, a zatim smisliti novu lozinku.\n\nČestitamo, spremni ste potraživanje tokena! U ovoj verziji preglednika neće biti skočnih prozora jer će se potvrde transakcije pojaviti u novoj kartici, tako da ćete se sami morati prebaciti na novu karticu jer se ne otvara automatski.\n\nRječnik\n\nProstori\n\nProstori su mjesto na platformi Subsocial na kojem se nalazi sadržaj - sve objave moraju biti kreirane unutar Prostora. Svi korisnici mogu slobodno kreirati onoliko Prostora koliko žele. Prostor može funkcionirati kao osobni prostor ili kao zajednica. Korisnici mogu pratiti Prostore kako bi na svom izvoru tekućih vijesti vidjeli objave iz tog Prostora. Vlasnik Prostora može moderirati Prostor, kao i promijeniti način na koji je postavljen. Na primjer, vlasnik može dopustiti pratiteljima objavljivanje u Prostoru ili onemogućiti negativne glasove. Ako to želi, vlasnik svoj Prostor može učinkovito transformirati u DAO.\n\nPrijenos vlasništva\n\nPrijenos vlasništva nad Prostorom omogućuje da drugu osobu postavite za vlasnika, što sa sobom nosi sve ovlasti i odgovornosti koje vlasništvo pretpostavlja. Prijenos vlasništva dvostrani je proces - nakon što pokrenete prijenos, primatelj mora prihvatiti vlasništvo nad Prostorom.\n\nUrednici Prostora\n\nVlasnik Prostora može postaviti druge račune kao njegove urednike. Funkcija urednika omogućuje vam objavljivanje u Prostoru te uređivanje i skrivanje objava koje kreirate u Prostoru (ne možete uređivati ili sakrivati postove drugih osoba). Ova je značajka korisna za stvari kao što su zajednički blogovi ili novine.\n\nObjave\n\nObjave predstavljaju način na koji sadržaj postavljate na platformu Subsocial (tekst, audio zapisi, fotografije ili videozapisi). Objave moraju biti kreirane u Prostoru. Objave je moguće komentirati, kao i glasati za ili protiv njih. Objave se mogu dijeliti u drugim Prostorima.\n\nKomentari\n\nKomentari su odgovori na objavu koji su vidljivi ispod nje.\n\nPozitivni glasovi\n\nPozitivni glas reakcija je na objavu koja označava da vam se objava sviđa. Broj glasova koji podupiru objavu vidljiv je svima.\n\nNegativni glasovi\n\nNegativan glas reakcija je na objavu koja označava da vam se objava ne sviđa. Broj glasova koji ne podupiru objavu vidljiv je svima.\n\nDijeljenje\n\nDijeljenje objave slično je retweetanju tweeta na platformi Twitter. Dijeljenju objave možete dodati komentar koji će biti lako uočljiv. Dijeljenje objave slično je objavi, jer se objave moraju dijeliti na Prostorima. Dijeljenja se također mogu pozitivno ili negativno ocijeniti, komentirati i dijeliti.\n\nIzvor tekućih vijesti\n\nVaš izvor tekućih vijesti zbirka je objava iz Prostora koje pratite.\n\nProfil\n\nVaš je profil povezan s adresom vašeg Subsocial računa i predstavlja pregled vaših aktivnosti na platformi Subsocial. Na svom računu možete postaviti profilnu sliku i korisničko ime, kao i poveznicu na osobnu web stranicu. Ispod sažetka vašeg profila nalazi se zbirka svih vaših objava, komentara, reakcija i Prostora. Da biste se saznali dodatne informacije o drugim korisnicima, možete pregledati njihove profile.\n\nAdresa računa\n\nAdresa računa je upravo to što i jest, adresa vašeg računa. Adrese su obično dugi nizovi slova i brojeva, a koriste se za provođenje transakcija na blockchain mrežama. U ekosustavu Substrate svaki račun ima više adresa jer postoji više lanaca. Dostupnost lanaca ovisi o novčaniku koji koristite.\n\nNovčanik\n\nKriptovalutni novčanik jednostavan je softver koji vam osigurava kontrolu nad vašim kriptovalutama. Odvojen je od vašeg računa, jer se iz više novčanika možete prijaviti na jedan račun. Primjeri novčanika uključuju Polkadot.js, Polkawallet, Fearless Wallet i Metamask.\n\n[SUB.ID](http://SUB.ID)\n\n[Sub.ID](http://Sub.ID) alat je koji je, kao dar ekosustavu Substrate, izradio Subsocial tim. Njegov je cilj poboljšati korisničko iskustvu u ekosustavu. Jedan od glavnih problema s Polkadot.js novčanikom jest taj što nije postavljen na način koji omogućuje lak i nesmetan pristup različitim lancima, te što ne pruža mogućnost promatranja većeg broja lanaca odjednom. [Sub.id](http://Sub.id) omogućuje vam da istovremeno vidite svoja salda i adrese za više Substrate lanaca. Ako vam netko drugi pruži samo jednu od svojih Substrate adresa, možete ih potražiti na alatu [Sub.id](http://Sub.id) i pronaći njihove adrese za druge lance. To će vam olakšati plaćanje napojnica, jer ih možete platiti na bilo kojem Substrate lancu koji želite.\n\nTokeni Prostora\n\nProstori mogu kreirati vlastiti token samo za taj Prostor i koristiti ga u razne svrhe. Tokenima se može pružiti upravljačka moć te se mogu distribuirati članovima prostora u svrhu transformacije Prostora u DAO. Tokeni mogu omogućiti udio u prihodu, u trenutku kada se prihodi od oglasa iz Prostora distribuiraju među vlasnicima tokena. Tokeni Prostora bit će prenosivi i razmjenjivi.\n\nPolkaverse\n\nPolkaverse još je jedan front-end sustav sposoban za povezivanje sa Subsocial blockchainom. Napravljen kako bi pokazao da, za razliku od tradicionalnih društvenih mreža, platforma Subsocial odvaja front-end sustave od back-end sustava, omogućujući programerima da izgrade dodatne front-end sustave koji odgovaraju njihovim potrebama i preferencijama. Sustav Polkaverse sličan je glavnoj Subsocial aplikaciji. Razlika je u tome što je posvećen proširenju Polkadot i Kusama ekosustavima i što omogućuje lančanu integraciju identiteta s Polkadot i Kusama blockchaina.\n\nPodmreža\n\nPodmreža predstavlja front-end sustav (web-stranica/aplikacija) izgrađen za povezivanje sa Subsocial lancem koji prikazuje samo pododjeljak sadržaja. Sustav Polkaverse dobar je primjer. Ako jednog dana netko napravi front-end sustav sličan Instagramu koji prikazuje sadržaj samo sa slikama, to bi bio još jedan dobar primjer podmreže.\n\nIdentitet na lancu\n\nRazličiti Substrate blockchainovi sadrže identitete na lancu, što korisnicima omogućuje da pruže dodatne informacije o sebi (kao što su ime, adresa e-pošte, Twitter račun itd.) koje, uz malu naknadu, ako to želi, može provjeriti neovisna treća strana.\n\nDAO\n\nDecentralizirana autonomna organizacija. DAO-ovi u osnovi funkcioniraju kao normalne tvrtke ili neprofitne organizacije. Jedina je razlika u njihovoj hijerarhijskoj strukturi. Naime, DAO-vi nemaju izvršnog direktora na vrhu i hrpu radnika na dnu, već svakome pružaju jednake uvjete, budući da se članovi nagrađuju u skladu s doprinosom koji su pružili.\n\nSubstrate\n\nSupstrate predstavlja okvir koji se u osnovi sastoji od građevnih blokova koji se nazivaju palete i koji programerima omogućuju jednostavnu izgradnju najmodernijih blockchaina. Supstrate je izgrađen programskim jezikom Rust, a kreirao ga je dr. Gavin Wood, koji je kreirao Ethereum. Platforma Subsocial izgrađen je sa Substrate-om.\n\nValidatori\n\nValidatori čvorova održavaju blockchainove putem sustava konsenzusa. Oni omogućuju ispravno funkcioniranje mreže bez ikakvih nesuglasica između strana o tome koji su se događaji odvili u lancu. Validatori čvorova računala su koja pokreću operateri čvorova. U zamjenu za svoje usluge dobivaju tokene.\n\nIPFS\n\nInterPlanetary File System decentralizirana je mreža za pohranu koju obično koriste blockchain projekti kojima je potrebno rješenje za pohranu. Funkcionira slično torrent mreži, gdje korisnici preuzimaju sadržaj na svoje uređaje i uploadaju ga ljudima koji mu žele pristupiti. Operatori IPFS čvora mogu odabrati koji će sadržaj hostati na svom čvoru. Platforma Subsocial koristi IPFS za pohranu multimedijskih sadržaja.\n\nCID\n\nCID-ovi su identifikatori sadržaja, a koriste se kao adrese za datoteke smještene na IPFS mreži. CID se generira iz kriptografskog hasha sadržaja, što znači da u slučaju promjene sadržaja dolazi i do promjene CID-a.\n\nUloge\n\nUloge predstavljaju skupine dopuštenja unutar Prostora koje vrijede za svakog člana kojemu je dodijeljena konkretna uloga. Na primjer, Prostor može kreirati ulogu moderatora i dati mu dopuštenje za skrivanje objava i blokiranje korisnika iz tog određenog Prostora.\n\nDopuštenja\n\nDopuštenja vam omogućuju upravljanje nad svojim Prostorima. Na primjer, samo vi ili netko tko prati Prostor možete objavljivati i uređivati objave. Ako ih ne volite, upotrebom dopuštenja možete onemogućiti značajke kao što su glasovi protiv ili komentare. Dopuštenja se mogu dodijeliti raznim ulogama unutar Prostora.\n\nModeriranje\n\nNa platformi Subsocial moderiranje se odvija samo unutar Prostora. Vlasnik Prostora ili imenovani moderatori jedini imaju pravo moderiranja. Za razliku od tradicionalnih društvenih mreža, na platformi Subsocial ne postoji središnji autoritet koji ima pravo moderiranja. To znači da izvan Prostora nema moderiranja. Nitko ne može izbrisati vaš Prostor ili ga moderirati umjesto vas, osim ako ga vi ne postavite za moderatora. JEDINI način na koji netko može moderirati vaš sadržaj jest ako objavljujete sadržaj koji se nalazi na IPFS čvoru, a operater čvora je odlučio prestati s njegovim hostanjem. Međutim svatko može slobodno hostati svoj IPFS čvor.\n\nCenzura\n\nCenzura je pojava tijekom koje netko ili nešto ograničava vašu slobodu izražavanja. Iako možete biti cenzurirani u Prostorima drugih ljudi, ne možete biti cenzurirani u Prostorima koje posjedujete.\n\nPlaćanje napojnice\n\nPlaćanje napojnice najjednostavniji je način da nekoga nagradite za sadržaj koji je kreirao, bez obzira na to radi li se o članku, videozapisu ili šali koja vas je nasmijala. Napojnice se uplaćuju izravno na račun koji je kreirao objavu ili komentar, bez posrednika koji uzimaju svoj dio kao što je to slučaj na postojećim platformama za monetizaciju sadržaja.\n\nPretplate\n\nPretplate će vam omogućiti da primate ponavljajuća plaćanja za pristup autorovom Prostoru ili drugom jedinstvenom sadržaju. Učestalost plaćanja bit će određena od autora sadržaja. Na primjer, autor može ponuditi dnevnu pretplatu umjesto mjesečne.\nStručne mreže\n\nNa panelu stručnjaka, Prostori će moći odabrati ili glasanjem odlučiti koji je sadržaj najbolji. Autori koji su objavili sadržaj s najviše glasova dobit će nagrade.\n\nPay-Per-View\n\nPPV omogućuje jednokratno pristupanje sadržaju uz fiksnu naknadu. Ako sadržaju želite ponovno pristupiti, morat ćete ponovno platiti.\n\nOglašavanje\n\nKako bi ostvarili prihod, vlasnici Prostora ili upravni odbori moći će prodavati oglasni prostor u svom Prostoru. Vlasnik ili odbor mogu prikupiti taj prihod, podijeliti ga među svim vlasnicima Space tokena koji su članovi tog tog prostora ili ga potrošiti na bilo koji drugi način.\n\nIzvanlančane usluge\n\nSubsocial tim nudi različite izvanlančane usluge koje poboljšavaju korisničko iskustvo na platformi Subsocial kao što su funkcija pretraživanja, obavijesti (uključujući obavijesti e-poštom i ažuriranja izvora tekućih vijesti), osobne postavke i telegramski bot u fazi razvoja za obavijesti.\n\nObavijesti\n\nObavijesti vas upozoravaju na osobe koje prate vas ili bilo koji vaš Prostor, glasaju ili komentiraju i dijele vaše objave.\n\nPretraživanje cijelog teksta\n\nZnačajka pretraživanja omogućuje vam pretragu teksta prema bilo kakvim ključnim riječima. Na primjer, pretraživanje Prostora, objava, autora, oznaka i komentara.", "timestamp": 1635439508, "digest": "bunJuD-PNPtZR95LtDipU3F5VQjIq5hfRE2UghVhG_M", "contributor": "0xd57722111412Bf8fD260827426202A04de47899F"}

Between its ear-worm melodies, varying vocal delivery, and clever voice-over outro, “not a summer song” packs a quick, digestible punch in a way few others could replicate—especially at this age.\n\nnamou is just getting started, but this debut single proves that he has all of the ingredients to really scale in this space.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW0ShStARpo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW0ShStARpo)\n\n[https://twitter.com/beforethedata/status/1453764109938270220](https://twitter.com/beforethedata/status/1453764109938270220)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635439410, "digest": "8UARm0iLVBwhCi3pBkYdD-tvf7OF-fntrYIwia2Fceo", "contributor": "0xdFBB06683a882E827907422dbFE836E5430fE2aC"}
{"id": "tn_gindKQvFI9g9KUHf0akM4Xqb5ydU-4rF6qXgeVJ8", "title": "How to Mint a Witch", "body": "If you've never minted an NFT before, it can be a daunting process! We've put together a guide to help you navigate through the different steps you'll need to follow.\n\n## Preparing a Wallet\n\nTo mint an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain, you'll need both Ether (ETH) and a wallet that can hold your NFT.\n\nThe easiest way to do both at the same time is to download [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/), an iOS app that allows you to create a wallet and add up to $500 a week using Apple Pay. If that amount works for you, you can go straight to Minting.\n\nHowever, if you need more than $500, follow these next steps.\n\n### Creating a Wallet\n\nFirst, create an Ethereum wallet that you can use to conduct your transactions and hold your NFTs. A few options that we support are Metamask, WalletConnect (which works for Rainbow and many other wallets), and Coinbase Wallet (which is different from a Coinbase.com account).\n\nYour Ethereum wallet will have a public address on the Ethereum network, which is where you can send and receive tokens like Ether and NFTs.\n\n### Buying Ether\n\nThe easiest way to buy Ether, the currency used on Ethereum, is to use a crypto exchange.\n\nWe recommend Coinbase for beginners. Note that this [Coinbase.com](http://Coinbase.com) account is *different* from a Coinbase Wallet account—it is an account for Coinbase's exchange, which allows you to trade currencies like USD for cryptocurrencies like Ether.\n\n1. Create an account and buy some Ether.\n   1. Make sure that you have *more* Ether than you need for the cost of the mint—each Ethereum transaction requires \"gas,\" the network fees that go into processing blockchain transactions. Gas fees vary by the type of transaction and depending on the level of activity in the Ethereum network, but minting an NFT can cost as much as $150 in gas when there's high traffic. For example, the witches cost 0.07 ETH each to mint, so you may want to have 0.1 ETH per witch on hand.\n2. Once you've bought your Ether, transfer it by sending it to the address of the wallet you just created earlier. Now you're ready to mint an NFT!\n\n# Minting\n\nWhen you \"mint\" an NFT, you're interacting with a smart contract on the blockchain and making a transaction to create a new token under that contract, which you will then own. For Crypto Coven, you can either mint through our website (beginner-friendly) or directly through Etherscan (more advanced).\n\n### Website (Beginner-Friendly)\n\nThe easiest way to mint a witch is through the [Crypto Coven website](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/), since we'll handle a lot of the complexity for you.\n\n1. You'll need to connect your wallet to our website using the \"Connect Wallet\" button—a modal will open, and you'll need to choose the wallet type you created earlier.\n   1. If you created a [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) wallet (or any other WalletConnect-enabled wallet), click the WalletConnect option. You'll see a QR code you need to scan. In Rainbow, you'll want to press the \"Discover\" button on the upper-right corner of the main screen, then the QR scanner icon on the upper-right corner of the next screen. Once you're there, scan the code on your screen, and you should be connected to our website.\n2. Once your wallet is connected, select the number of witches you'd like to mint, with a max of three. Then click \"Mint,\" and you should see an overview of the transaction you're about to create in your wallet, with the option to confirm it.\n3. In most cases, the transaction should take a few moments and then complete. Hooray, you've just minted your first NFT!\n\nIf gas is surging or the contract hits the total limit of witches to mint, there is a possibility that your transaction will fail, which means that you will lose some or even all of the gas you paid. The reason that this scenario can happen is that *any* transaction on Ethereum requires gas to execute—you always have to pay for the computations you're enacting on the network. [Here](https://info.etherscan.com/reason-for-failed-transaction/) are some common reasons transactions can fail.\n\n### Etherscan (Advanced)\n\nIf you'd like to interact directly with the smart contract, you can mint witches on Etherscan. Etherscan only supports Metamask or WalletConnect, so Coinbase Wallet will not work for this method.\n\n1. Go to our smart contract in Etherscan—we’ll include the link once it’s deployed. It should have a green checkmark on the \"Contract\" tab to indicate that the source code is deployed and verified.\n2. You can click on the \"Read Contract\" button to check if the sale is active.\n   1. If you're participating in the public sale, make sure that `isPublicSaleActive` is set to `true` before you attempt to mint a witch—otherwise, your transaction will be reverted, and you may lose gas.\n   2. If you're participating in the community sale, you will need to have already added your wallet address to the list in order to mint a witch. Make sure that `isCommunitySaleActive` is set to `true` before you attempt to mint a witch. Otherwise, your transaction will be reverted, and you may lose gas.\n3. Now head over to the \"Write Contract\" view. Here, you'll need to connect your wallet to Etherscan by clicking the \"Connect to web3\" button. Once you're connected, you can start creating transactions under the smart contract.\n4. Now it's time to do the minting!\n   1. If you're participating in the public sale, head to the function that just says `mint`. The price per witch in the public sale is 0.07 ETH, so multiply that by the number of witches you want to mint (up to three). Enter that total in the `payableAmount` field, along with the number of witches you want in the `numberOfTokens` field.\n   2. If you're participating in the community sale, you'll need to go to the function named `mintCommunitySale` instead.\n      1. The community sale price per witch is 0.05 ETH. Multiply that by the number of witches you want to mint (up to three) and enter that total in the `payableAmount` field.\n      2. Enter the number of witches you want in the `numberOfTokens` field.\n      3. The last field you'll need is your proof, which is how we verify that your address is on our list for this sale. You can retrieve your proof by finding your wallet address at a URL we’ll link when it’s ready. Copy the proof associated with your address and paste it into the `merkleProof` field in Etherscan. It should look like a list of hashes:\n\n         ```\n         [\"0xe970...52d9\",\"0xe970...52d9\",\"0xe970...52d9\",\"0xe970...52d9\"]\n         ```\n5. In most cases, the transaction should take a few moments and then complete. And… now you’ve got got your witch.\n\n# Viewing Your Witch\n\nYou won't be able to see your witch immediately after minting! Once a day, we reveal all witches minted in the past day, so you'll see a placeholder in your wallet until the next reveal. Once that's happened, you should be able to view your witch in your wallet or marketplaces like OpenSea and Zora!", "timestamp": 1635439432, "digest": "V1zX1gDrzVDCVvFo8VtCpggqx2-fcHSjetF0LNTFBLI", "contributor": "0x4537611D7972550f23A04F1A6f4D20ec8e83722F"}
{"id": "Y8dOq6C52XUDDVCO95wf-Bo1Bfk8RvmQ8VsYMsZYTkE", "title": "SUBSOCIAL NETWORK", "body": "Uvod\n\nMnogi od nas prijavili su se na Facebook nesvjesni što znači koristiti besplatni proizvod. Budući da troškovi uvijek postoje, potrebno je pronaći način na koji možemo izvući vrijednost. Vaši podaci i vrijeme vaša su plaća. Da smo tada znali ono što znamo sada, možda bismo izabrali drugačije.\n\nOsim toga, vrlo je važno imati na umu da je veća priča zapravo pozitivnija unatoč tomu što je izvlačenje vrijednosti na Webu 2.0 izvršeno od strane platformi društvenih mreža. Pojedinci su mogli stvarati sadržaj, dijeliti ga sa svijetom i primati plaću bez napuštanja svog doma.\n\nUnatoč toj slobodi koja nam omogućuje da se izrazimo i budemo plaćeni za vrijednost koju stvaramo, znamo da Internet nije toliko slobodan kao što je prvotno bilo zamišljeno.\n\nPristup webu, objavljivanje sadržaja i primanje plaće uključuje brojne davatelje usluga koji vrebaju u pozadini. Ti davatelji usluga mogu blokirati vaš sadržaj, zaustaviti vaša plaćanja ili vas jednostavno u potpunosti ukloniti s platforme. Svaki je pružatelj usluga potencijalna točka cenzure. Svaki od njih u stanju je izvući vrijednost.\n\nBlockchain je tehnologija koja eliminira potrebu za posrednicima i koja posjeduje snagu kojom može ukloniti nepotrebne pružatelje usluga koji stoje između autora i potrošača. Kada govorimo o blockchain tehnologiji nailazimo na jedan zanimljiv paradoks - njezina najveća kvaliteta manifestira se u činjenici da je najvrjednija kada izvlači što je manje moguće vrijednosti od svojih korisnika.\n\nFacebook ne bi trebao prodavati vaše podatke, a da vam ne plati. YouTube ne bi trebao imati veću zaradu od oglašavanja od vas. Twitter ne bi smio zabraniti ili blokirati vaše tweetove jer se ne slaže s vama.\n\nZato smo kreirali platformu Subsocial. Radi se o Web 3.0 tehnologiji s koja jamči suverenitet podataka. Vi kontrolirate podatke koje stvarate. Vaš sadržaj, vaša vrijednost.\n\nPregled\n\nSubsocial je otvorena platforma koja svakome omogućuje pokretanje vlastitih decentraliziranih društvenih mreža i tržišta otpornih na cenzuru. Platforma Subsocial će vam pomoći da stvorite vlastitu decentraliziranu verziju globalno popularnih stranica kao što su Medium, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Discourse, Patreon, OnlyFans itd.\n\nNaš softver koristi Substrate blockchain okvir i IPFS za decentraliziranu pohranu datoteka koji omogućuju personalizirani izvor tekućih vijesti i obavijesti, transparentnu reputaciju, pretraživanje cijelog teksta, bogate formate sadržaja bez žrtvovanja sustava SEO (optimizacija tražilice).\n\nUpotreba sustava Substrate platformi Subsocial omogućuje da se poveže s proširenjem Polkadot i Kusama. Polkadot je sljedeća generacija blockchain protokola koji ujedinjuje čitavu mrežu namjenski izgrađenih blockchaina, pružajući im mogućnost besprijekorne međusobne komunikacije i uzajamnog djelovanja unutar zadanog opsega. Polkadot će osigurati međulančanu interakciju, kao i zajedničku sigurnosnu platformu na kojoj se Subsocial može proširiti, ali i ostati siguran.\n\nPlatforma Subsocial društvena je mreža koja ne poznaje nikakva ograničenja.\n\nArhitektura\n\nPlatforma Subsocial više je od blogging platforme koja nudi plaćanja u kriptovaluti. Radi se o revolucionarnoj platformi koja povezuje društvene mreže s decentraliziranim financijama. Ovo je financijska društvena mreža koja predstavlja spoj društvene mreže i decentraliziranih financija (DeFi). Kako bismo bolje objasnili po čemu se razlikujemo od jednostavnih blogging platformi, moramo predstaviti našu arhitekturu na visokoj razini.\n\nUkratko ćemo vas upoznati sa sljedećim temama: gdje se sadržaj objavljuje i kako se može unovčiti putem brojnih temeljnih načina na kojima radimo i koje što prije želimo učiniti dostupnima. Ovaj će vam rad otkriti i mnoštvo reputacijskih vrsta te načine na koje rješavamo reputacijska pitanja.\n\nUz platformu Subsocial ne morate pokretati vlastiti blockchain za društvenu mrežu. Na lancu platforme Subsocial, koji će pružiti zajedničke efekte umrežavanja, može djelovati mnoštvo različitih društvenih mreža. Mreža je prema zadanim postavkama otporna na cenzuru, međutim, svaka zajednica može postaviti vlastita moderacijska pravila.\nObjave i prostori\n\nTemeljni elementi platforme Subsocial su prostori, obajve, komentari, lajkovi i pratitelji. Ovi elementi poznati su svima koji su koristili bilo koju platformu društvenih mreža.\n\nNajbolji način za njihovo razumijevanje usporedba je s poznatim platformama:\n\nProstori su slični:\n\nBlogovima na platformi Blogger\nPublikacijama na platformi Medium\nGrupama ili stranicama na platformi Facebook\nRačunima na platformama Twitter i Instagram\nKanalima na platformi YouTube\nPoslužiteljima na platformi Discord\nForumima na platformi Discourse\n\nObjave su slične:\n\nObjavama na platformi Facebook\nČlancima na platformi Medium\nTweetovima na platformi Twitter\n\nŠto kažete na nešto naprednije? Kako možemo ponovno stvoriti popularne platforme za Web 3.0 koristeći platformu Subsocial?\n\nAirbnb – popisi apartmana su prostori, dok su recenzije objave\nQuora – pitanje je objava, odgovori su komentari/odgovori.\nStack Overflow -\n\nAutori odgovora mogu biti nagrađeni, npr. od strane onoga tko je postavio pitanje\nRaspodjela isplata također se može podijeliti između onoga što vlasnik pitanja i zajednica smatraju najboljim odgovorom.\n\nPatreon/OnlyFans – podržani korisnici mogu biti predstavljeni kao prostori koji su nagrađeni putem plaćenih pretplata i glasova zajednice itd.\n\nSve objave i prostori povezani su s parovima javnih ključeva (računima). To znači da se sav sadržaj može precizno pripisati autoru i/ili vlasniku objava. Korištena kriptografija istovjetna je onoj upotrijebljenoj na platformama Polkadot i Kusami. Platforma Subsocial podržava proširenje platforme Polkadot u obliku {.js} koje omogućuje jednostavno upravljanje ključevima u pregledniku ili, u budućnosti, izvanmrežnim trezorom putem sustava Parity Signer.\n\nUz ugrađenu podršku za IPFS, vaš prostor može iskoristiti prednosti decentraliziranih usluga poslužitelja.\n\nSvi su kodovi otvorenog izvora i omogućuju prilagodbu pristupnog korisničkog sučelja, a prilagođeni su potrebama vaše zajednice. Za više pojedinosti pogledajte JS SDK platforme Subsocial. Ako imate ideju za novu funkcionalnost lanca, možete predložiti značajku ili stvoriti zahtjev za povlačenjem putem repozitorija čvorova platforme Subsocial.\n\nIdentitet\n\nNa platformi Subsocial dopuštamo izradu korisničkog profila. Radi se o jedinstvenom identitetu koji se može koristiti u bilo kojoj zajednici izgrađenoj povrh platforme Subsocial. Vjerujemo da bi se u budućnosti ovaj identitet mogao ponovno koristiti na drugim paralancima.\n\nDruštvena mreža u vlasništvu korisnika\n\nNa trenutnim društvenim mrežama imamo vrlo ograničene informacije o tome kako se upravlja platformom. Djelomičan razlog zašto je to tako leži u činjenici da nemamo vlasništvo nad platformom. Najveće tvrtke koje su u vlasništvu društvenih mreža zarađuju milijarde dolara od kojih autorima sadržaja ide samo jedan mali dio profita, dok korisnici ne dobivaju apsolutno nikakav dio zarade. Čak i kao dioničarima matične tvrtke, naš će udio biti gotovo neznatan.\n\nNa platformi Subsocial korisnici su vlasnici mreže. Uz vlasnike tokena, koji mogu sudjelovati u cjelokupnom upravljanju platformom Subsocial, upravljanje svakim prostorom u kojem su učlanjeni omogućeno je i korisnicima. Svaki prostor djeluje poput decentralizirane autonomne organizacije (DAO), gdje članovi mogu biti vlasnici i pomoći u upravljanju prostorom. Upravljanje prostorom je neobavezno, ali vjerujemo da će mnogi prostori odlučiti prihvatiti ovu značajku.\n\nAko se ne radi o vašim ključevima, onda to nisu vaši podaci\n\nObjavljivanje sadržaja na web-mjestu u vlasništvu tvrtki koje posjeduju tradicionalne društvene mreže pretpostavlja mala prava nad načinom na koji se sadržaj unovčava ili cenzurira. Štoviše, vaše vjerodajnice za prijavu pohranjuju se u njihovoj središnjoj bazi podataka. Morate vjerovati da će te tvrtke moći zaštititi vaše privatne podatke, a već smo ranije svjedočili brojnim situacijama u kojim je došlo do povrede podataka u vlasništvu najvećih tvrtki koje djeluju u Web 2.0 prostoru (uključujući Facebook i Twitter). Ne postoji način na koji možete provjeriti prodaju li te tvrtke vaše podatke.\n\nTehnologije koje pokreću paradigmu Web 3.0 omogućuju korisnicima da zadrže vlasništvo nad vlastitim podacima. Umjesto da objavljujete sadržaj na platformi u vlasništvu velikih društvenih mreža, sadržaj sada možete objavljivati i monetizirati potpuno neovisno o trećim stranama. Vaše vjerodajnice za prijavu pohranjuju se lokalno, i to na vašim uređajima, a ne u centraliziranoj bazi podataka.\n\nMonetizacija\n\nNapojnice\n\nNapojnice mogu biti plaćene po objavi, komentaru ili prostoru. Osim autorima sadržaja, nagrade mogu biti isplaćene i osobama koje su objavile dobar komentar/odgovor.\n\nPretplate\n\nJedna ključna značajka koja nije dostupna na prethodnim blockchain web-mjestima za blogove uključivanje je pretplate. Ova značajka od iznimne važnosti koja pretpostavlja unovčavanje sadržaja dostupna je na popularnim Web 2.0 platformama kao što su Patreon, SubStack i OnlyFans.\n\nPojava pretplata u ekosustavu kreiranja sadržaja omogućila je ljudima da počnu samostalno raditi i puno se detaljnije povezivati sa svojim obožavateljima. Dok su prije pojave ovakvih stranica YouTube oglasi nudili nešto poput proxyja, te su stranice otišle korak dalje i omogućile su objavljivanje privatnog sadržaja za različite razine pretplatnika.\n\nNajveći je nedostatak to što ove platforme mogu blokirati ili ukloniti sadržaj koji im se ne sviđa, a osim toga, autori svoj sadržaj povjeravaju vlasnicima platforme. Koliko besplatnog sadržaja može vidjeti tim koji stoji iza platforme OnlyFans? Uklanjanje točaka povjerenja važno je za blockchain ekosustav.\n\nTehnički dio dodavanja pretplata u Subsocial lanac je jednostavan, međutim, još uvijek treba provesti određena istraživanja o tome kako postupati s hostingom za privatni sadržaj na decentraliziran način, a da se pritom očuva privatnost autora.\n\nProdaja ili najam sadržaja\n\nBlockchain tehnologija omogućuje istinsko vlasništvo: budući da ga posjedujete, svoj biste sadržaj trebali moći prodati ili preprodati. Ova dinamika zapravo nije moguća na Webu 2.0: vaš sadržaj može uključivati vaše ime koje obično nije kriptografski potpisano niti pohranjeno u javnoj glavnoj knjizi. Vlasništvo u Webu 2.0 prilično je nejasno, a njegova provedba zahtijeva pravne ugovore.\n\nUz platformu SubSocial moguće je prodavati sadržaj, kao i iznajmljivati postove ili prostore. Vi zadržavate vlasništvo i ostvarujete određeni prihod, dok najmoprimac zadržava pravo na promet ostvaren posjetom korisnika. Navedimo primjer:\n\n\\*NAPOMENA\n\nAko ste napisali popularnu objavu na neku temu (npr. e-trgovina), a objava privuče tisuće pregleda mjesečno, onda je moguće pretpostaviti da je drugi vlasnik prostora upoznat s činjenicom da vaša objava privlači mnogo prometa. Na platformi SubSocial svoju biste objavu na određeno vrijeme mogli iznajmiti drugom prostoru i na taj način ostvariti pravo na prikupljanje autorskih naknada za svoj trud.\n\nPametni ugovori\n\nKorisnici platforme Subsocial nisu ograničeni na ugrađenu funkciju unovčavanja koju izvorno pruža lanac. Korisnici mogu implementirati pametne ugovore kako bi pokazali beskrajnu kreativnost u unovčavanju svog sadržaja i ugleda. Moguće je izraditi različite algoritme za unovčavanje koji su napredniji ili prilagođeniji vašoj zajednici. Pogledajmo dva primjera koji ilustriraju visok stupanj prilagodbe unovčavanja koje nudi platforma Subsocial:\n\nObjava može biti vlasništvo više autora, a isplate se mogu modificirati u skladu s udjelom u vlasništvu, kao i u skladu s brojem lajkova ili odgovora.\nProstor može pokrenuti jedinstvene tjedne natječaje koji bi nagrađivali autore tri najpopularnije objave na temelju broja lajkova i dijeljenja.\n\nNadamo se da ćemo uspjeti pružiti istu razinu kreativnosti koja je u prisutna u decentraliziranom financijsku sustavu unutar Ethereuma. Svjesni smo da bez pametnih ugovora decentralizirani financijski sustav unutar Ethereuma ne bi bio moguć. Interakcija između mnogih DeFi projekata izraz je sastavljanja pametnih ugovora.\n\nDruštvene financije (SoFi): kombinacija decentraliziranih financija (DeFi) i društvenih mreža\n\nDruštvene financije (SoFi) predstavljaju naš pogled na područja u kojima blockchain tehnologija može revolucionirati plaćanja za društvene mreže. Platforma Subsocial gradi SoFi alate decentraliziranih financijskih primitiva koji su optimizirani za društveno umrežavanje.\n\nOsim što je važno da autori sadržaja ubiru plodove svojega rada, važno je i da zajednica može slobodno odlučiti koga će promovirati i nagraditi, što bi već trebalo biti jasno iz ovog rada. SoFi, međutim, preuzima ta temeljna načela kako bi ih nadogradila i omogućila razvojnim programerima da postanu kreativniji i osmisle napredne prilagođene značajke.\n\nS pametnim ugovorima koji su dostupni unutar platforme Subsocial, zajednici se pruža mogućnost da stvori vlastite SoFi primitive koji se mogu sastaviti, slične onima iz DeFi prostora. Tijekom Hackusama-e, tim Subsocial počeo je graditi primitive kao što su napojnice i plaćene pretplate koje će biti dostupne tijekom pokretanja. Nadamo se da ćemo tijekom vremena izvođenja dodati NFT-ove i pay-per-view značajku.\n\nDruštveni tokeni\n\nTokenizirajte svoj Subsocial prostor društvenim tokenima kako biste izgradili i unovčili svoj prostor. Vaši pratitelji mogu postati suvlasnici prostora i, ako žele, sudjelovati u upravljanju. Suvlasnički prostor u svojoj je suštini DAO. To je nešto čega ćemo se dotaknuti u kasnijem odjeljku.\n\nUgrađeni AMM DEX za društvene tokene, koji je prilagođen platformi Subsocial, omogućit će korisnicima da lako razmjenjuju društvene tokene bez da moraju brinuti o tome trebaju li pokušati prodavati vlastite tokene i prebacivati njihovo vlasništvo s jedne osobe na drugu.\n\nS obzirom na snagu platforme Polkadot, vašim ćete tokenima moći trgovati i razmjenjivati ih za DOT, KSM i ostale društvene parachain tokene, uključujući i stabilne coine poput onih koje razvijaju Acala i Bandot.\n\nStabilni coini\n\nVažno je imati izvor prihoda (napojnice, plaćene pretplate) koji ne ovisi o ekstremnoj volatilnosti karakterističnoj za kriptovalute. Kao što je spomenuto u prethodnom pododjeljku, to će biti lako uz platformu Polkadot.\n\nUloge i dopuštenja\n\nPlatforma Subsocial izvorno nudi četiri ugrađene i dinamičke uloge. Vlasnici prostora mogu utvrditi i zatim dinamički ažurirati ulogu za bilo koji Subsocial račun, kao i odrediti koja su dopuštenja povezana s tom ulogom.\n\nU nastavku su navedene četiri ugrađene uloge:\n\nUloga\nOpis\nNitko\nBilo koji račun na Subsocial blockchainu\nSvatko\nNijedan račun\nPratitelj\nBilo koji račun koji prati konkretni prostor\nVlasnik prostora\nTrenutni vlasnik konkretnog prostora\n\nUloge mogu imati različita dopuštenja prema želji vlasnika prostora ili moderatora prostora. Kao i kod drugih platformi društvenih mreža, važno je definirati dopuštenja uzimajući u obzir sljedeća pitanja:\n\nTko može kreirati objave i pisati komentare unutar prostora?\nJe li moguće urediti objavu ili komentar?\nJe li moguće izbrisati objavu ili komentar?\nJe li moguće glasati za objavu, protiv nje ili ju podijeliti?\n... i još mnogo toga.\n\nPrimjer: prostor nalik platformi Twitter\n\nNa primjer, ako želite svoj prostor učiniti sličnim platformi Twitter, u njega biste trebali implementirati sljedeće dozvole:\n\nU konkretnom prostoru samo vlasnik može pisati objave\nOnemogućivanje uređivanja objava i komentara\nOnemogućivanje negativnih glasova\n\nUloge i dopuštenja omogućuju da prostor bude fleksibilan, osoban te da definira preciznu kontrolu pristupa. To vam pomaže u upravljanju prostorom kada on predstavlja skupinu ljudi kao što je zajednica, organizacija ili tim.\n\nModeriranje\n\nJedna tema koja je važna za decentralizirani tehnološki ekosustav upravljanje je njegovim moderiranjem. Platforma Subsocial odupire se cenzuri ne blokirajući sadržaj na temeljnoj razini (na lancu). No isto tako razumijemo kako je nužno da vam pružimo mogućnost moderiranja vašeg osobnog prostora kako biste mogli ukloniti nepovezani sadržaj i trolane objave te urediti neprikladan sadržaj.\n\nJedinstveni skup moderacijskih pravila koji je primjerice prisutan na platformi Twitter previše je strog i tjera sve korisnike da usvoje iste perspektive kako bi izbjegli cenzuru. Moderiranje po prostoru znači \"vaš prostor, vaša pravila\". Ovim pravilima upravlja lanac. Osim toga, moguće je modificirati korisničko sučelje kako bi se omogućila veća kontrola nad prikazanim sadržajem.\n\nRazličiti prostori mogu imati različita moderacijska pravila, ali svi dijele isti blockchain. Platforma Subsocial ljepilo je koje povezuje sve prostore.\n\nProstori kao DAO-i\n\nFunkcionalnost koju pružaju moduli iz značajke Uloge i dopuštenja podsjeća na karakteristike DAO-a. To jest, prostor na platformi Subsocial može funkcionirati poput DAO-a. Platforma Subsocial dozvoljava više vlasnika (putem višestrukog potpisa) koji mogu kontrolirati i unovčavati sadržaj.\n\nSvaki prostor može imati svoj vlastiti token, stoga se vlasništvo nad prostorom može predstaviti kao udio u tokenu prostora. Slično tomu, svaki se prostor može razvijati vlastitim mehanizmom upravljanja (uključujući upravljanje vlasnika tokena). Kao rezultat toga, svaki prostor može imati vlastiti trezor koji kontroliraju njegovi vlasnici tokena.\n\nUpravljanje se može koristiti za modificiranje dozvola unutar prostora, uloga, odabir moderatora te čak za kolektivno donošenje odluka o tome kako blokirati neželjeni sadržaj.\n\nKako bi se olakšalo trgovanje tokenima unutar različitih prostora, tokeni će se prvo moći zamijeniti za Subsocial tokene.\n\nSkalabilnost\n\nPlatforma Subsocial omogućuje zajednicama da kreiraju vlastiti prostor povrh Subsocial lanca, tako da sve zajednice dijele isti temeljni blockchain. To pruža zajedničke mrežne efekte: korisnici će se jednostavno moći pridružiti bilo kojoj zajednici na bilo kojem alternativnom klijentu na platformi Subsocial. Osim toga, svatko s Polkadot ili Kusama adresom može se lako pridružiti Subsocial zajednici.\n\nMogućnost nadogradnje\n\nSupstrat omogućuje besprijekornu nadogradnju blockchaina bez tvrdog račvanja (hard fork). Na platformama Polkadot i Kusami već smo svjedočili provedbi nadogradnje vez tvrdog račvanja. Isti mehanizmi upravljanja i nadogradnje na lancu dostupni su za sve blockchaine temeljene na Supstratu.\n\nOvaj pristup blockchain tehnologiji savršen je za platformu Subsocial. Vjerujemo da nije moguće znati sve unaprijed. Funkcionalnost i parametri platforme u potpunosti će se morati mijenjati kada članovi zajednice pronađu bugove ili kada dođe vrijeme za provedbu neophodnih poboljšanja.\n\nMogućnost prilagodbe\n\nU svojoj srži naš je softver otvorenog koda i modularnog dizajna. Platforma Subsocial omogućuje gotovo potpuno prilagođavanje potrebama zajednice. Ovo je, nadamo se, očito iz prethodnih odjeljaka, ali nije na odmet upoznati se s brojnim načinima na koje se naš softver može koristiti:\n\nPrilagodba korisničkog sučelja putem našeg alata JS SDK\nImplementacija pametnih ugovora za nove metode unovčavanja\nNasljeđivanje značajki iz drugih prostora\nPrigođavanje upravljačkih procesa unutar konkretnog prostora\nModeriranje sadržaja u skladu s željema publike\nPokretanje vlastitog lanca pomoću našeg otvorenog koda\n\nMeđulančana interakcija s para-lancima\n\nJedan od najuzbudljivijih aspekata platforme Polkadot sposobnost je da jedan para-lanac bez prethodne provjere stupa u interakciju s drugim. To također znači da bi se bilo koji token s platforme Polkadot mogao koristiti za plaćanja na platformi Subsocial. Primarni interes za ovakvu vrstu transakcije vjerojatno će iskazati osobe koje pretplatu žele platiti koristeći se DOT, KSM, ACA ili izvornim SubSocial tokenima.\n\nUpravljanje\n\nU prethodnom smo odjeljku opisali kako vlasnici prostora na raspolaganju imaju nekoliko mogućnosti za upravljanje vlastitim prostorom. Upravljanje prostorom pokušali smo učiniti što fleksibilnijim kako bismo ga prilagodili zahtjevima vlasnika.\n\nOsim toga, na Subsocial para-lancu također postoji upravljački sloj. Baš kao što je to slučaj na platformi Polkadot, vlasnici Subsocial tokena moći će glasati o prijedlozima koji se pojavljuju na lancu.\n\nUpravitelji lanca odlučit će na koji će se način lanac nadograđivati i kako će se trošiti novac iz trezora. Nadogradnje mogu postati novi moduli koji pružaju nove funkcionalnosti za sve prostore i koji odlučuju bi li se platforma Subsocial trebala integrirati s ostalim društvenim mrežama.\n\nTrezor\n\nTrezor platforme Subsocial skup je tokena na razini lanca koji se mogu potrošiti na prijedloge koje su iznijeli članovi zajednice u svrhu daljnjeg napretka projekta i njegovog ekosustava. Prema našim predviđanjima, trezor bi trebao sponzorirati razvoj lanca, stvaranje različitih web i mobilnih aplikacija, alternativnih algoritama povezanih s prikazom tekućeg sadržaja, rast zajednice i marketing.\n\nU usporedbi s, recimo, trezorom platforme Kusama, postoji jedna značajka za koju nam se čini da se može poboljšati. Naša bi platforma trebala imati tri vijeća koja će upravljati gore navedenim rashodima trezora. Svako vijeće u idealnom će slučaju biti sastavljeno od stručnjaka iz konkretne domene: tehnologije, UX-a i marketinga.\n\nBudućnost verzije 1.0\n\nU ovom odjeljku ćemo razmotriti moguće značajke koje bi mogle postati dio budućih verzija platforme Subsocial.\n\nPay-Per-View\n\nZnačajka koju trenutno istražujemo je Pay-Per-View (PPV). Preliminarno istraživanje pokazalo je da bi se ta značajka mogla implementirati korištenjem pouzdanog okruženja za izvršavanje, sličnom onomu iz projekta SubstraTEE.\n\nTrgovina za algoritme društvenog umrežavanja\n\nObjave, tweetovi i novosti koje ispunjavaju izvor tekućih vijesti na najpopularnijim web stranicama za društveno umrežavanje kontroliraju nevidljivi algoritmi koji imaju ogroman utjecaj na naš život. Milijarde ljudi koristi društvene mreže kojima upravlja nekoliko ogromnih korporacija, ali nitko ne može vidjeti kako algoritam funkcionira niti odabrati prikladniji algoritam koji odgovara ukusima korisnika. To vrijedi za platforme YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Medium i, prema našem mišljenju, za sve ostale platforme društvenih mreža na Webu 2.0.\n\nFiltriranje informacija svojevrsna je moć koju te tvrtke imaju nad nama. Njihovi algoritmi osmišljeni su i stalno se poboljšavaju radi njihove zarade, a ne zbog sadržaja koji bi nas najviše zanimao. Sličan problem ogleda se i u filtriranju oglasa. Postoji ravnoteža između količine oglasa po sesiji korisnika i ogorčenosti korisnika u slučaju da je tijekom sesije prikazano previše oglasa. Još jednom ponavljamo, ovi algoritmi nisu javni.\n\nOsmislili smo način na koji možemo riješiti taj problem: trgovinu za algoritme koji popunjavaju izvor tekućih vijesti. Time bismo korisnicima omogućili da biraju između različitih algoritama filtriranja, tako da se sadržaj u korisničkom sučelju može pojaviti redoslijedom koji najbolje odgovara željama korisnika. Ako se pokaže da jedan algoritam ne radi, može se zamijeniti drugim.\n\nNapredno moderiranje\n\nJedan od proizvoda skaliranja saznanje je da bi velika zajednica mogla imati puno iskustva s kvalitetnim moderiranjem i održavanjem blokiranog sadržaja. U prostoru koji je posvećen djeci, važno je blokirati sadržaj koji se smatra krajnje nepoželjnim.\n\nNa drugom kraju skale mogu biti tisuće malih zajednica koje imaju samo jednog moderatora ili nemaju isto iskustvo ili nemaju vremena pratiti najnoviji sadržaj koji treba blokirati.\n\nOvaj se problem može riješiti tako da se zajednicama omogući nasljeđivanje načina moderiranja iz većeg prostora unutar platforme Subsocial. To će rasteretiti manje zajednice i omogućiti učinkovito upravljanje neželjenim sadržajem.\n\nRazdijeljena reputacija\n\nJedan od ključnih mehanizama koji gradimo raspoređivanje je reputacije po prostoru i oznaci. Usporedite ovo s platformom Reddit koja ima samo jedan sustav reputacije: umjesto konkretne reputacije za određeni subreddit, ova platforma nudi opću reputaciju za cijelu web stranicu. Ova generička karma (ugled) ne pokazuje gdje je korisnik točno stekao reputaciju. Stručnjaci za financijska tržišta vjerojatno nisu stručnjaci za, recimo, nogomet i kirurgiju.\n\nReputacijski sustav koji mi planiramo uvesti nalik je sustavu razdijeljene reputacije s platforme Stack Overflow (Stack Exchange). Ovaj pristup omogućuje napredne značajke oslanjajući se na vašu konkretnu reputaciju:\n\nPrilikom glasanja u anketi, vaša reputacija po prostoru može se koristiti za ponderiranje vašeg glasa.\nPrilikom sudjelovanja u izazovu ili natjecanju s poticajem, reputacija u određenom prostoru može se koristiti kao koeficijent za određivanje udjela u nagradi. Pravedne nagrade zahtijevaju konkretnu reputaciju.\n\nS obzirom na prilagodbu koja je omogućena pametnim ugovorima, prostori bi mogli proširiti ili nadjačati sustav reputacije ugrađen u osnovni lanac. Vlasnici prostora ili članovi njihove zajednice mogu stvoriti alternativne formule za izračunavanje reputacije i načina na koji se ona koristi.\n\nEkonomija tokena\n\nEkonomija tokena i njihova distribucija\n\nEkonomija tokena (\"tokenomija\") definira upotrebu tokena, uključujući čimbenike koji određuju njihovu ponudu i potražnju.\n\nDistribucija tokena početna je raspodjela sudionika u bloku geneze (tj. tko posjeduje koliki postotak tokena pri pokretanju mreže).\n\nPotražnja – tko želi posjedovati Subsocial tokene?\n\nSudionici unutar Subsocial ekosustava morat će pribaviti Subsocial tokene kako bi izvršili radnje. Sljedeći popis prikazuje tipične grupe ljudi koji će potraživati tokene.\n\nZa plaćanje transakcija kao i za ulaganje ili ostvarivanje prava na besplatne transakcije, korisnici trebaju posjedovati tokene.\nKorisnici koji su ujedno i autori sadržaja posjedovanjem tokena ostvaruju pravo da njihov sadržaj bude postavljen kao prioritet (u određenom smislu, ovdje se radi o \"marketingu\")\nLjudi koji žele sudjelovati u upravljanju (ovako se oblikuje razvoj Subsocial ekosustava na decentraliziran način).\nPravo na pristup posebnom sadržaju (posebnim prostorima)\nZa pokretanje validacijskog čvora na para-lancu kolatorima su potrebni tokeni.\nKorisnici koji žele kupiti token konkretnog prostora to mogu učiniti isključivo pomoću glavnih Subsocial token\n\nPonuda – koga će mreža nagraditi?\n\nPostoje određeni sudionici unutar mreže koji obavljaju vitalne funkcije za održavanje integriteta i dostupnosti mreže, stoga će takvi sudionici biti nagrađeni Subsocial tokenima. Ovdje se radi o obliku inflacije isplaćene iz bloka s nagradama.\n\nKolatori (oni koji proizvode blokove na Subsocial lancu)\nTrezor\nSudionici u PLO-u (korisnici koji polažu sigurnosni depozit za aukciju na para-lancu)\n\nRazmotrili smo i pitanje trebaju li sljedeći akteri koji su dio našeg ekosustava biti nagrađeni izvornim Subsocial tokenima, s naglaskom da ti akteri kreiraju svoje vlastite tokene unutar platforme Subsocial. To znači da će prostori unutar platforme Subsocial odabrati kako će nagraditi sljedeće aktere:\n\nAutore sadržaja\nIzdavače\nInfluencere\nModeratore\n\nKorisnost tokena\n\nGlavni token pogodan je za niz različitih upotreba koje ćemo opisati u nastavku. Glavna svrha tokena omogućiti je autorima da svoj sadržaj unovče na različite načine. Imajte na umu da su neke od ovih značajki još u razvoju.\n\nTransakcije\nUnovčavanje sadržaja\nNapojnice\nPretplata\nProdaja i najam prostora\nImplementacija pametnih ugovora\nImplementacija novih tokena (npr. Tokena prostora ili društvenih tokena)\nGlasanje u upravljanju (za dodatne pojedinosti pogledajte Lightpaper)\n\nDistribucija tokena\n\nPočetna distribucija\n\nPrilikom pokretanja Subsocial blockchaina očekujemo da će tokeni biti distribuirani na sljedeći način.\n\n10% - privatna prodaja tokena (15-25% tokena od navedenih 10% bit će otključeno tijekom TGE-a, s razdobljem stjecanja prava od 2 godine)\n25% - tim i savjetnici (bez otključavanja za vrijeme TGE-a, s razdobljem stjecanja prava duljim od 2 godine)\n65% - razvoj ekosustava:\n25% Kusama PLO\n15% razvojne potpore\n10% marketing\n5% autori sadržaja\n5% kolatori\n5% airdropovi za postojeće zajednice: Polkadot, Kusama, Steem, Hive\n\nTGE = Događaj generiranja tokena. Radi se o događaju koji uključuje početno kreiranje tokena koji će se održati nakon pokretanja mreže Subsocial.\n\nKovanje tokena (poslije njihova stvaranja)\n\nNakon što mreža krene s radom, započinje proizvodnja novih blokova s tokenima koji će kao nagrada biti proslijeđeni važnim sudionicima mreže. Ovaj postupak predstavlja oblik inflacije tokena.\n\nPrema našem planu, u prvoj godini neće biti inflacije tokena zato što će nagrade za ključne sudionike biti uključenje u početni blok. U ovom slučaju, ključni sudionici su kolatori i sudionici u PLO-u.\n\nOd druge godine planiramo krenuti s inflacijom po stopi od 10% (od ukupne ponude). Parametri se mogu prilagoditi kako bi odražavali tržišne uvjete. Moramo osigurati da inflacija ne odvrati nove ljude od pridruživanja ekosustavu, ali da bude dovoljno visoka da nagradi određene važne sudionike za obavljanje potrebnih funkcija (kolatori).\n\nUkupni iznos inflacije tijekom godine mogao bi se rasporediti u sljedećim iznosima (ovi se brojevi mogu mijenjati od strane upravljačke strukture):\n\n25% za kolatore (i nominatore)?\n25% za trezor\n25% za autore sadržaja\n25% za nagradni fond budućih PLO-a\n\nTrezor\n\nPlatforma Subsocial slijedit će postupke platformi Polkadot i Kusama implementacijom trezora na lanac koji kontroliraju vlasnici tokena. Planiramo imati dva vijeća, jedno tehničko, a drugo usmjereno na rast ekosustava.\n\nNismo donijeli konačnu odluku o tome kada će se pokrenuti upravljanje na lancu (a time i trezor).\n\nKao što je gore navedeno, plan nam je da trezor primi 25% inflacijskih nagrada.\n\nPara-lanac i para-nit\n\nLanac razvijen sa sustavom Supstrate u različitim trenucima svog života može poprimiti jedno od tri stanja: neovisni lanac s osiguranim mostom, para-lanac ili para-nit. (izvor)\n\nPlatforma Subsocial planira biti para-lanac platforme Kusama, a ako to bude uspješno provedeno, onda ćemo razmotriti i pokretanje para-lanca za proširenje Polkadot, ali ne možemo jamčiti da će se to dogoditi.\n\nAko platforma Subsocial ne bude uspjela pokrenuti para-lanac, razmotrit ćemo pokretanje para-niti. U tom se slučaju neće generirati tokeni za korisnike koji su željeli sudjelovati u PLO-u (jer akcija nije uspjela).\n\nKao para-nit, trebali bismo kupiti KSM ili DOT tokene kako bismo platili uključivanje bloka. Za pokrivanje ovog troška, jedna od opcija bila bi prodaja našeg izvornog tokena unutar lanca.\n\nResursi\n\nAcala Token Economy Paper <https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala-white-paper/blob/master/Acala_Token_Economy_Paper.pdf>\nSubsocial Lightpaper (Monetization)\nPolkadot Parathreads <https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/ru/learn-parathreads>\n\nČesto postavljana pitanja\n\nŠto je Subsocial?\n\nPlatforma Subsocial skup je Substrate paleta s internet korisničkim sučeljem koje svakome omogućuje pokretanje vlastite decentralizirane društvene mreže ili zajednice. Platforma Subsocial nije decentralizirana društvena mreža, poput Twittera ili Facebooka, već platforma za izgradnju društvenih mreža.\n\nOdakle potječe ime platforme?\n\nPlatforma Subsocial bit će temeljna arhitektura na kojoj se grade društvene mreže budućnosti. Prefiks Sub odnosi se na dvije stvari:\n\nPlatforma Subsocial bit će osnovni sloj koji podržava sve društvene mreže izgrađene na njemu\nPlatforma Subsocial izgrađena je na tehnologiji Substrate\n\nJe li platforma Subsocial para-lanac platformi Kusama ili Polkadot?\n\nTrenutno ne, ali u budućnosti planiramo licitirati za para-lančani utor, vjerojatno na platformi Kusama. Najveća prepreka trenutno je činjenica da para-lančani blokovima trenutno treba previše vremena za pružanje kvalitetnog korisničkog iskustva na platformi Subsocial.\n\nNa koji se način platforma Subsocial može usporediti s platformama Facebook, Twitter, Instagram itd.?\n\nBudući da platforma Subsocial nije društvena mreža, već platforma za izgradnju društvenih mreža, ovdje se radi o usporedbi krušaka i jabuka. Međutim, društvene mreže izgrađene na platformi Subsocial imat će brojne prednosti u usporedbi s društvenim mrežama Webu 2.0 kao što su decentralizacija, otpor cenzuri, višestruke mogućnosti decentralizirane monetizacije (bez posrednika koji mogu uzeti svoj dio) i razne druge prednosti rada na blockchainu.\nKoje su prednosti izgradnje zajednice na platformi Subsocial?\n\nZbog nekih od gore navedenih značajki, platforma Subsocial omogućit će vam stvaranje puno živahnije i uključenije zajednice. Koristeći društvene tokene i značajke decentraliziranog upravljanja, članovi zajednice moći će postati sudionici na do sada nikada viđen način. Budući da platforma Subsocial predstavlja protokol otporan na cenzuru, ne postoji središnje tijelo koje može kontrolirati vašu zajednicu. Umjesto toga, sama zajednica može odrediti vlastitu moderaciju i pravila članstva.\n\nKoje su prednosti korištenja platforme Subsocial za korisnike?\n\nNa tradicionalnim društvenim mrežama većina korisnika nikada ne prima nikakvu naknadu za vrijednost koju pružaju mreži. S društvenim mrežama izgrađenim na platformi Subsocial, korisnici će zapravo moći ostvariti korist od sadržaja koji proizvode, i to putem različitih metoda unovčavanja, kao što su napojnice, pretplate, društveni tokeni, prodaja oglasnog prostora i još mnogo toga. Uz to što će sadržavati trgovinu algoritmima, platforma Subsocial svojim će korisnicima pružiti kontrolu nad sadržajem koji im je dostupan.\n\nNije mi u potpunosti jasno kako koristiti platformu Subsocial. Što mogu učiniti?\n\nPlatforma Subsocial još uvijek je u beta fazi, no naš tim radi na poboljšanju korisničkog sučelja i iskustva. Ako imate bilo kakvih pitanja, obratite nam se na čavrljanju unutar platformi Telegram ili Discord.\n\nHoće li se održati IDO?\n\nU ovom trenutko to nam nije u planu.\n\nHoće li se održati IEO?\n\nTim trenutno istražuje IEO-a, no još uvijek nije ništa nije objavljeno. Za sve najnovije informacije, pratite naš kanal s najavama.\n\nPostoji li način za dobivanje besplatnih tokena koji bi se koristili na platformi Subsocial?\n\nBesplatan token iz našeg fonda možete dobiti nakon što ispunite kratku anketu.\n\nKako mogu kupiti Subsocial tokene?\n\nSubsocial tokeni trenutno se ne mogu kupiti.\n\nKako glasi naziv Subsocial tokena?\n\nNaziv tokena glasi SUB.\n\nKoji je ukupni broj tokena dostupnih u ponudi?\n\nU ponudi se nalazi ukupno 100 milijuna tokena.\n\nDa li je SUB ERC20 token?\n\nNe. platforma Subsocial ima svoj vlastiti izvorni token izgrađen na Substrate blockchain okviru. Naš token koristi istu tehnologiju kao tokeni DOT, KSM, KAR i ostali tokeni lanaca temeljenih na tehnologiji Supstrate.\n\nGdje mogu pogledati pametne ugovore platforme Subsocial?\n\nNa platformi Subsocial ne postoje pametni ugovori, jer je izgrađena kao prilagođeni blockchain utemeljen na Substrate blockchain okviru. Subsocial blockchain optimiziran je za operacije povezane s radom društvenih mreža i ima vrlo niske naknade.\n\nImate li lightpaper?\n\nSubsocial Lightpaper\n\nGdje se mogu upoznati s ekonomijom tokena platforme Subsocial?\n\nEkonomija tokena platforme Subsocial\n\nKako mogu započeti s korištenjem platforme Subsocial?\n\nU svom pregledniku instalirajte proširenje Polkadot.js. Ovo proširenje omogućuje vam potpisivanje transakcija u Subsocial blockchainu. Slično je pregledniku MetaMask (proširenje preglednika za Ethereum).\n\nU pregledniku Chrome, instalirajte putem Chrome web store\nU pregledniku Firefox, instalirajte putem Firefox add-ons\n\nNakon što ste instalirali proširenje Polkadot, kreirajte (ili uvezite) svoj račun kako biste se putem ove poveznice mogli prijaviti na Subsocial web dapp (decentraliziranu aplikaciju). Da biste koristili decentraliziranu aplikaciju, trebat će vam Subsocial tokeni, stoga posjetite našu fond za tokene.\n\nMogu li platformu Subsocial koristiti na mobilnom uređaju?\n\nObjave i komentare možete čitati na mobilnim uređajima. S mobilnih uređaja trenutno nije moguće objavljivati, komentirati, davati pozitivne/negativne glasove, dijeliti ili pratiti zato što naš trenutna web decentralizirana aplikacija zahtijeva proširenje Polkadot.js za potpisivanje transakcija, a moderni mobilni preglednici (kao što su Chrome i Firefox) ne podržavaju proširenje. Naša mobilna aplikacija u fazi je razvoja.\n\nPostoji li egzistencijalni depozit na platformi Subsocial?\n\nEgzistencijalni depozit na betanetu trenutno iznosi 0,1 SUB. Ovaj se iznos može promijeniti u budućnosti ovisno o ukupnoj ekonomiji tokena platforme Subsocial.\n\nImam problema s proširenjem Polkadot{.js}. Što da napravim?\n\nMoj se račun ne prikazuje ispravno\n\nJoš jednom provjerite je li vaše proširenje povezano s web decentraliziranom aplikacijom. Ako je povezano, probajte osvježiti stranicu.\n\nNe vidim nove račune iz proširenja Polkadot.js\n\nAko ne vidite nove Polkadot{.js} račune na web decentraliziranoj aplikaciji u gornjem desnom kutu, pokušajte se odjaviti i zatim ponovno učitajte stranicu i ponovno se prijavite.\n\nPonovno sam učitao stranicu, ali nije pomoglo\n\nPreporučamo ponovno učitavanje stranice s čišćenjem predmemorije (Ctrl+F5 u većini preglednika).\n\nMoja transakcija nije uspješno provedena\n\nU većini slučajeva, ponovno učitavanje stranice unutar Subsocial web decentralizirane aplikacije trebalo bi riješiti vaš problem. Ako i dalje imate problema sa slanjem transakcija (prilikom praćenja prostora, kreiranja objave ili komentara, glasovanja, itd.), prijavite to na jednom od naših službenih čavrljanja (po mogućnosti glavno čavrljanje na engleskom jeziku).\n\nKoje su službene društvene poveznice?\n\nSve naše najvažnije poveznice dostupne su ovdje.\n\nČavrljanja na platformi Telegram\n\nEngleski (glavno čavrljanje): <https://t.me/Subsocial>\n中文 (kineski): <https://t.me/SubsocialChinese>\n日本語 (japanski): <https://t.me/SubsocialJapanese>\nEspañol (španjolski): <https://t.me/SubsocialSpanish>\nFrançais (francuski): <https://t.me/joinchat/8Amh4naeRLAyMzYy>\nItaliano (talijanski): <https://t.me/SubsocialItalian>\nРусский (ruski): <https://t.me/SubsocialRussian>\nTiếng-Việt (vijetnamski): <https://t.me/SubsocialVietnam>\nTürkçe (turski): <https://t.me/SubsocialTurkish>\nDeutsch (njemački): <https://t.me/SubsocialGerman>\n\nPostoji li ikakva dokumentacija o ugovorima, privatnosti ili pravnom statusu?\n\nUvjeti korištenja\n\nPravilnik o privatnosti\n\nPotraživanje tokena od strane vlasnika DOT/KSM tokena\n\nKada je napravljena snimka zaslona koja prikazuje bilancu DOT i KSM tokena?\n\nNapravljene su dvije snimke zaslona za tokene Polkadot i Kusama. Jedna 15. travnja 2021., a druga 21. svibnja 2021.\n\nOvdje se nalazi snimka zaslona od 15. travnja za DOT, ovdje snimka zaslona od 21. svibnja za DOT, ovdje se nalazi snimka zaslona od 15. travnja za KSM i ovdje se nalazi snimka zaslona od 21. svibnja za KSM.\n\nKada će sudionici koji ispunjavaju uvjete moći zatražiti svoje Subsocial tokene?\n\nDatum još nije objavljen. Za sve najnovije informacije pratite naš kanal s najavama.\n\nPotraživanje tokena za vlasnike Uptrennd (1UP) tokena\n\nKada je napravljena snimka zaslona koja prikazuje bilancu 1UP tokena?\n\nSnimka zaslona koja prikazuje bilancu 1UP tokena napravljena je 4. svibnja 2021.\n\nKada će sudionici koji ispunjavaju uvjete moći zatražiti svoje Subsocial tokene?\n\nDatum još nije objavljen. Za sve najnovije informacije pratite naš kanal s najavama.\n\nKako platforma Subsocial pohranjuje sadržaj i podatke korisnika?\n\nPlatforma Subsocial koristi InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) za pohranu sadržaja korisnika. Da biste saznali više o tome kako se IPFS uklapa u Subsocial sustav, pogledajte ovaj članak.\n\nČesto postavljana pitanja o potraživanju tokena\n\nKoji računi ispunjavaju uvjete za potraživanje tokena?\n\nPrihvatljivost se temelji na dvama snimkama zaslona od 15. travnja i 21. svibnja 2021. godine koje prikazuju vlasnike DOT i KSM tokena. Da bi ispunjavao uvjete, račun mora imati najmanje 1 DOT token tijekom obje snimke zaslona ili najmanje 0,1 KSM tijekom obje snimke zaslona.\n\n1. rujna napravili smo snimku zaslona koja prikazuje sve račune koji su sudjelovali u bilo kojoj od pobjedničkih crowdloan kampanja do tog datuma (Karura, Moonbeam, Khala, Shiden, Bifrost, KILT, Basilisk i Calamari). Svi računi sadržani u ovoj snimci također ispunjavaju uvjete, međutim, doprinosi za crowdloan kampanju moraju biti izvršeni putem proširenja Polkadot.js. Stanje novčanika na burzama i doprinosi za crowdloan kampanju izvršeni putem burzi ili web-mjesta trećih strana kao što su Zenlink ili Bifrost-ov SALP ne ispunjavaju uvjete.\n\nZašto postoji nekoliko krugova potraživanja tokena?\n\nSubsocial zajednica rasprostranjena je po cijelom svijetu. Budući da smo vodili računa o različitim vremenskim zonama i radnom vremenu, zahtjeve za potraživanje tokena podijelili smo u nekoliko krugova koji će se odvijati u različitim vremenskim okvirima.\n\nMogu li zatražiti tokene iz novčanika Polkawallet/Fearless/Trust?\n\nNe. Trenutačno nijedan mobilni novčanik ne podržava platformu Subsocial, što je u potpunosti izvan naše kontrole. Međutim, služeći se preglednikom na stolnom računalu svoj račun možete uvesti u Polkadot.js koristeći početnu frazu, što će vam omogućiti da zatražite svoje tokene.\n\nDa biste pronašli početnu fazu na Fearless novčaniku napravite sljedeće: idite na Postavke > Računi > Informacije > Izvezi\n\nDa biste pronašli početnu fazu na Polkawallet novčaniku napravite sljedeće: idite na Profil > Upravljanje računom > Izvoz računa > Mnemoniraj\n\nDa biste pronašli početnu fazu na Trust novčaniku napravite sljedeće: idite na Postavke > Novčanici > Kliknite na 3 točke na novčaniku koji želite zatražiti > Prikaži frazu za oporavak\n\nMogu li zatražiti tokene sa Ledger računa?\n\nNe. Ledger trenutno ne podržava platformu Subsocial, što je u potpunosti izvan naše kontrole. Međutim, ako imate početnu frazu na svom Ledger računu, služeći se preglednikom na stolnom računalu svoj račun možete uvesti u Polkadot.js koristeći početnu frazu, što će vam omogućiti da zatražite svoje tokene.\n\nMogu li potraživanje izvršiti sa svog telefona?\n\nDa. Pogledajte vodič koji je dostupan ovdje.\n\nVeć sam zatražio tokene. Mogu li ih zatražiti opet?\n\nSvaki račun koji ispunjava uvjete potraživanje može izvršiti samo jednom. Na primjer, ako je račun koji ispunjava uvjete podnio zahtjev tijekom 1. kruga, tokene ne može potraživati tijekom 2., 3. ili 4. kruga. Ako imate više računa koji ispunjavaju uvjete, potraživanje ćete moći izvršiti samo jednom za svaki račun koji ispunjava uvjete.\n\nDao sam svoj doprinos u crowdloan kampanji, zašto ne ispunjavam uvjete?\n\nPrihvaćamo samo doprinose koji su izvršeni prije 24. rujna i to putem proširenja Polkadot.js. Bilo koji doprinos crowdloan kampanji izvršen putem burze bit će označen neprihvatljivim. Svi doprinosi crowdloan kampanji izvršeni putem drugih web stranica, kao što su Zenlink ili Bifrost-ov SALP, neće biti prihvaćeni.\n\nMoje se proširenje Polkadot.js ne može povezati s web stranicom. Što nije u redu?\n\nAko imate problema s povezivanjem, slijedite sljedeće korake:\n\nProvjerite je li na vašem Polkadot.js računu uključena značajka \"Dopusti upotrebu na bilo kojem lancu\"\nProvjerite jeste li dopustili mreži app.subsocial.network pristup vašem Polkadot.js računu\nAžurirajte svoje meta podatke\nIsključite AdBlock\nPonovno učitajte stranicu (to učinite samo jednom - nemojte ponovno učitavati stranicu više puta).\n\nTrebam li posjedovati DOT, KSM ili SUB tokene da bih izvršio potraživanje?\n\nNe. Transakcije potraživanja tokena besplatne su za sve račune koji ispunjavaju uvjete.\n\nŠto su SUB tokeni? Što mogu učiniti s njima?\n\nSUB tokeni izvorni su tokeni Subsocial blockchaina i koriste se za interakciju s mrežom. glavna mreža platforme Subsocial još nije pokrenuta, ali naša je beta mreža aktivna i nudi funkcionalan proizvod. Svoje SUB tokene možete koristiti za stvaranje prostora, kreiranje objave postova i interakciju s drugim članovima na platformi Subsocial, tako da ih pratite, komentirate i glasate za njihove objave. Drugim ćete korisnicima u budućnosti moći slati napojnice u obliku SUB tokena i još mnogo toga. Platforma  Subsocial radi na poboljšanju interakcije s korisnicima, zbog čega svojim korisnicima i pruža mogućnost potraživanja tokena.\n\nNa platformi Subsocial možete kreirati svoj vlastiti prostor i profil.\n\nŠto će se dogoditi s mojim tokenima kada se pokrene glavna mreža?\n\nVećina tokena bit će prebačena s beta mreže na glavnu mrežu, a većina korisnika će imati isti saldo tokena kao i na beta mreži.\n\nU kojem će vremenskom okviru biti otvoreni sljedeći krugovi potraživanja tokena?\n\n1. krug započet će u 5h UTC+0 u četvrtak, 7. listopada 2021. Početak 3. i 4. kruga bit će objavljen naknadno.\n\nČesto postavljana pitanja o potraživanju tokena putem mobitela\n\nMogu li svoje tokene zatražiti putem mobitela?\n\nMožete. Ali budući da trenutno nema mobilnih novčanika koji podržavaju platformu Subsocial, morat ćete koristiti mobilni web-preglednik koji podržava web proširenja, a samim time i proširenje Polkadot.js. Yandex je trenutno jedini mobilni preglednik koji podržava proširenja. Morate instalirati preglednik Yandex sa slovom\"Я\" na crvenoj pozadini, jer proširenje Polkadot.js ne radi stabilno u klasičnom pregledniku Yandex. Preuzmite ga ovdje.\n\nSada trebamo instalirati proširenje Polkadot.js. Otvorite preglednik Yandex. Slijedite ovu poveznicu i kliknite na gumb Preuzmi za Chrome (ova će značajka raditi u pregledniku Yandex). Ova vas poveznica prebacuje u trgovinu Chrome. Pritisnite gumb \"Instaliraj\" i ponovno potvrdite pritiskom na gumb \"Instaliraj proširenje\".\n\nZatim trebamo uvesti račun s kojeg želimo izvršiti potraživanje, koristeći JSON datoteku ili mnemoničku početnu frazu. Otvorite već instalirano proširenje Polkadot.js. Nova kartica s ekstenzijom trebala se otvoriti automatski nakon instalacije proširenja Polkadot.js. Ako se to nije dogodilo, idite na stranicu i kliknite \"Prijava\" u gornjem desnom kutu - proširenje će se otvoriti u novoj kartici. Na zaslonu ćete vidjeti pozdravnu poruku. Pritisnite \"Razumijem, pusti me da nastavim\".\n\nNaš račun (putem kojeg želimo zatražiti tokene) potom moramo uvesti u mobilno proširenje. Ako račun uvozite putem početne fraze, kliknite na \"+\" u gornjem desnom kutu zaslona i odaberite \"Vrati račun iz sigurnosne kopije JSON datoteke\" ili \"Uvezi račun iz već postojeće početne faze\". Zatim u retku \"sigurnosna kopija datoteke\" odaberite svoju JSON datoteku (ako je nemate, možete je izvesti iz novčanika koji koristite, npr. Mathwallet), u redak \"lozinka\" unesite trenutnu lozinku (ne novu lozinku!). Ako svoj račun uvezete pomoću početne fraze, morat ćete unijeti početnu frazu, a zatim smisliti novu lozinku.\n\nČestitamo, spremni ste potraživanje tokena! U ovoj verziji preglednika neće biti skočnih prozora jer će se potvrde transakcije pojaviti u novoj kartici, tako da ćete se sami morati prebaciti na novu karticu jer se ne otvara automatski.\n\nRječnik\n\nProstori\n\nProstori su mjesto na platformi Subsocial na kojem se nalazi sadržaj - sve objave moraju biti kreirane unutar Prostora. Svi korisnici mogu slobodno kreirati onoliko Prostora koliko žele. Prostor može funkcionirati kao osobni prostor ili kao zajednica. Korisnici mogu pratiti Prostore kako bi na svom izvoru tekućih vijesti vidjeli objave iz tog Prostora. Vlasnik Prostora može moderirati Prostor, kao i promijeniti način na koji je postavljen. Na primjer, vlasnik može dopustiti pratiteljima objavljivanje u Prostoru ili onemogućiti negativne glasove. Ako to želi, vlasnik svoj Prostor može učinkovito transformirati u DAO.\n\nPrijenos vlasništva\n\nPrijenos vlasništva nad Prostorom omogućuje da drugu osobu postavite za vlasnika, što sa sobom nosi sve ovlasti i odgovornosti koje vlasništvo pretpostavlja. Prijenos vlasništva dvostrani je proces - nakon što pokrenete prijenos, primatelj mora prihvatiti vlasništvo nad Prostorom.\n\nUrednici Prostora\n\nVlasnik Prostora može postaviti druge račune kao njegove urednike. Funkcija urednika omogućuje vam objavljivanje u Prostoru te uređivanje i skrivanje objava koje kreirate u Prostoru (ne možete uređivati ili sakrivati postove drugih osoba). Ova je značajka korisna za stvari kao što su zajednički blogovi ili novine.\n\nObjave\n\nObjave predstavljaju način na koji sadržaj postavljate na platformu Subsocial (tekst, audio zapisi, fotografije ili videozapisi). Objave moraju biti kreirane u Prostoru. Objave je moguće komentirati, kao i glasati za ili protiv njih. Objave se mogu dijeliti u drugim Prostorima.\n\nKomentari\n\nKomentari su odgovori na objavu koji su vidljivi ispod nje.\n\nPozitivni glasovi\n\nPozitivni glas reakcija je na objavu koja označava da vam se objava sviđa. Broj glasova koji podupiru objavu vidljiv je svima.\n\nNegativni glasovi\n\nNegativan glas reakcija je na objavu koja označava da vam se objava ne sviđa. Broj glasova koji ne podupiru objavu vidljiv je svima.\n\nDijeljenje\n\nDijeljenje objave slično je retweetanju tweeta na platformi Twitter. Dijeljenju objave možete dodati komentar koji će biti lako uočljiv. Dijeljenje objave slično je objavi, jer se objave moraju dijeliti na Prostorima. Dijeljenja se također mogu pozitivno ili negativno ocijeniti, komentirati i dijeliti.\n\nIzvor tekućih vijesti\n\nVaš izvor tekućih vijesti zbirka je objava iz Prostora koje pratite.\n\nProfil\n\nVaš je profil povezan s adresom vašeg Subsocial računa i predstavlja pregled vaših aktivnosti na platformi Subsocial. Na svom računu možete postaviti profilnu sliku i korisničko ime, kao i poveznicu na osobnu web stranicu. Ispod sažetka vašeg profila nalazi se zbirka svih vaših objava, komentara, reakcija i Prostora. Da biste se saznali dodatne informacije o drugim korisnicima, možete pregledati njihove profile.\n\nAdresa računa\n\nAdresa računa je upravo to što i jest, adresa vašeg računa. Adrese su obično dugi nizovi slova i brojeva, a koriste se za provođenje transakcija na blockchain mrežama. U ekosustavu Substrate svaki račun ima više adresa jer postoji više lanaca. Dostupnost lanaca ovisi o novčaniku koji koristite.\n\nNovčanik\n\nKriptovalutni novčanik jednostavan je softver koji vam osigurava kontrolu nad vašim kriptovalutama. Odvojen je od vašeg računa, jer se iz više novčanika možete prijaviti na jedan račun. Primjeri novčanika uključuju Polkadot.js, Polkawallet, Fearless Wallet i Metamask.\n\n[SUB.ID](http://SUB.ID)\n\n[Sub.ID](http://Sub.ID) alat je koji je, kao dar ekosustavu Substrate, izradio Subsocial tim. Njegov je cilj poboljšati korisničko iskustvu u ekosustavu. Jedan od glavnih problema s Polkadot.js novčanikom jest taj što nije postavljen na način koji omogućuje lak i nesmetan pristup različitim lancima, te što ne pruža mogućnost promatranja većeg broja lanaca odjednom. [Sub.id](http://Sub.id) omogućuje vam da istovremeno vidite svoja salda i adrese za više Substrate lanaca. Ako vam netko drugi pruži samo jednu od svojih Substrate adresa, možete ih potražiti na alatu [Sub.id](http://Sub.id) i pronaći njihove adrese za druge lance. To će vam olakšati plaćanje napojnica, jer ih možete platiti na bilo kojem Substrate lancu koji želite.\n\nTokeni Prostora\n\nProstori mogu kreirati vlastiti token samo za taj Prostor i koristiti ga u razne svrhe. Tokenima se može pružiti upravljačka moć te se mogu distribuirati članovima prostora u svrhu transformacije Prostora u DAO. Tokeni mogu omogućiti udio u prihodu, u trenutku kada se prihodi od oglasa iz Prostora distribuiraju među vlasnicima tokena. Tokeni Prostora bit će prenosivi i razmjenjivi.\n\nPolkaverse\n\nPolkaverse još je jedan front-end sustav sposoban za povezivanje sa Subsocial blockchainom. Napravljen kako bi pokazao da, za razliku od tradicionalnih društvenih mreža, platforma Subsocial odvaja front-end sustave od back-end sustava, omogućujući programerima da izgrade dodatne front-end sustave koji odgovaraju njihovim potrebama i preferencijama. Sustav Polkaverse sličan je glavnoj Subsocial aplikaciji. Razlika je u tome što je posvećen proširenju Polkadot i Kusama ekosustavima i što omogućuje lančanu integraciju identiteta s Polkadot i Kusama blockchaina.\n\nPodmreža\n\nPodmreža predstavlja front-end sustav (web-stranica/aplikacija) izgrađen za povezivanje sa Subsocial lancem koji prikazuje samo pododjeljak sadržaja. Sustav Polkaverse dobar je primjer. Ako jednog dana netko napravi front-end sustav sličan Instagramu koji prikazuje sadržaj samo sa slikama, to bi bio još jedan dobar primjer podmreže.\n\nIdentitet na lancu\n\nRazličiti Substrate blockchainovi sadrže identitete na lancu, što korisnicima omogućuje da pruže dodatne informacije o sebi (kao što su ime, adresa e-pošte, Twitter račun itd.) koje, uz malu naknadu, ako to želi, može provjeriti neovisna treća strana.\n\nDAO\n\nDecentralizirana autonomna organizacija. DAO-ovi u osnovi funkcioniraju kao normalne tvrtke ili neprofitne organizacije. Jedina je razlika u njihovoj hijerarhijskoj strukturi. Naime, DAO-vi nemaju izvršnog direktora na vrhu i hrpu radnika na dnu, već svakome pružaju jednake uvjete, budući da se članovi nagrađuju u skladu s doprinosom koji su pružili.\n\nSubstrate\n\nSupstrate predstavlja okvir koji se u osnovi sastoji od građevnih blokova koji se nazivaju palete i koji programerima omogućuju jednostavnu izgradnju najmodernijih blockchaina. Supstrate je izgrađen programskim jezikom Rust, a kreirao ga je dr. Gavin Wood, koji je kreirao Ethereum. Platforma Subsocial izgrađen je sa Substrate-om.\n\nValidatori\n\nValidatori čvorova održavaju blockchainove putem sustava konsenzusa. Oni omogućuju ispravno funkcioniranje mreže bez ikakvih nesuglasica između strana o tome koji su se događaji odvili u lancu. Validatori čvorova računala su koja pokreću operateri čvorova. U zamjenu za svoje usluge dobivaju tokene.\n\nIPFS\n\nInterPlanetary File System decentralizirana je mreža za pohranu koju obično koriste blockchain projekti kojima je potrebno rješenje za pohranu. Funkcionira slično torrent mreži, gdje korisnici preuzimaju sadržaj na svoje uređaje i uploadaju ga ljudima koji mu žele pristupiti. Operatori IPFS čvora mogu odabrati koji će sadržaj hostati na svom čvoru. Platforma Subsocial koristi IPFS za pohranu multimedijskih sadržaja.\n\nCID\n\nCID-ovi su identifikatori sadržaja, a koriste se kao adrese za datoteke smještene na IPFS mreži. CID se generira iz kriptografskog hasha sadržaja, što znači da u slučaju promjene sadržaja dolazi i do promjene CID-a.\n\nUloge\n\nUloge predstavljaju skupine dopuštenja unutar Prostora koje vrijede za svakog člana kojemu je dodijeljena konkretna uloga. Na primjer, Prostor može kreirati ulogu moderatora i dati mu dopuštenje za skrivanje objava i blokiranje korisnika iz tog određenog Prostora.\n\nDopuštenja\n\nDopuštenja vam omogućuju upravljanje nad svojim Prostorima. Na primjer, samo vi ili netko tko prati Prostor možete objavljivati i uređivati objave. Ako ih ne volite, upotrebom dopuštenja možete onemogućiti značajke kao što su glasovi protiv ili komentare. Dopuštenja se mogu dodijeliti raznim ulogama unutar Prostora.\n\nModeriranje\n\nNa platformi Subsocial moderiranje se odvija samo unutar Prostora. Vlasnik Prostora ili imenovani moderatori jedini imaju pravo moderiranja. Za razliku od tradicionalnih društvenih mreža, na platformi Subsocial ne postoji središnji autoritet koji ima pravo moderiranja. To znači da izvan Prostora nema moderiranja. Nitko ne može izbrisati vaš Prostor ili ga moderirati umjesto vas, osim ako ga vi ne postavite za moderatora. JEDINI način na koji netko može moderirati vaš sadržaj jest ako objavljujete sadržaj koji se nalazi na IPFS čvoru, a operater čvora je odlučio prestati s njegovim hostanjem. Međutim svatko može slobodno hostati svoj IPFS čvor.\n\nCenzura\n\nCenzura je pojava tijekom koje netko ili nešto ograničava vašu slobodu izražavanja. Iako možete biti cenzurirani u Prostorima drugih ljudi, ne možete biti cenzurirani u Prostorima koje posjedujete.\n\nPlaćanje napojnice\n\nPlaćanje napojnice najjednostavniji je način da nekoga nagradite za sadržaj koji je kreirao, bez obzira na to radi li se o članku, videozapisu ili šali koja vas je nasmijala. Napojnice se uplaćuju izravno na račun koji je kreirao objavu ili komentar, bez posrednika koji uzimaju svoj dio kao što je to slučaj na postojećim platformama za monetizaciju sadržaja.\n\nPretplate\n\nPretplate će vam omogućiti da primate ponavljajuća plaćanja za pristup autorovom Prostoru ili drugom jedinstvenom sadržaju. Učestalost plaćanja bit će određena od autora sadržaja. Na primjer, autor može ponuditi dnevnu pretplatu umjesto mjesečne.\nStručne mreže\n\nNa panelu stručnjaka, Prostori će moći odabrati ili glasanjem odlučiti koji je sadržaj najbolji.

联创一龙：我们已为区块链人人可用做好了准备](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/8f8a9924205bc05204df8d5d11aca766.jpg-article)\n\n10 月 26 日，由万向区块链实验室主办的第七届区块链全球峰会正式在上海开幕。NEAR 联合创始人一龙通过录播连线的方式接入现场，发表了《NEAR 重新想象的世界》主题演讲，以下是现场视频和相关文字：\n\n大家好，我是 NEAR Protocol 联合创始人。今天我想为大家介绍一下 NEAR 的生态，包括 NEAR 生态的现状以及未来的发展方向，让我们开始吧！\n\n![NEAR 联创一龙：我们已为区块链人人可用做好了准备](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/82767962eb2d92e7a1e191a986fd4c90.jpg-article)\n\nNEAR 是什么呢？NEAR 首先是一个 DApp 开发者平台。我们正着手打造一种新的应用开发方式，它为用户提供了大量的新方式来赚取收入、开发应用、吸引用户参与，同时将数据的所有权交给用户。NEAR 系统底层有一条 layer1 分片区块链，可确保这些应用基于这一可扩容的基础设施编写并易于使用。易于使用一直是我们关注的关键因素之一，NEAR 从创立之初就将其作为设计原则，我们认为去中心化应用应该像当前的互联网应用一样易于使用。\n\nNEAR 并不仅仅是由某个公司建立的，而是由一个巨大的、由多个项目组成的巨大生态建立的。因为 Guild （公会）的存在，社区得以参与 NEAR 生态。参与者和贡献者互相支持，使这个生态取得成功。NEAR 在去年 10 月便已上线，到现在已经一年多的时间了，欢迎大家亲自体验。\n\n![NEAR 联创一龙：我们已为区块链人人可用做好了准备](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/486adce68d536f346a20ffb7ffcc64fe.jpg-article)\n\n因为我们的重点在于开发者体验，所以我们正着手打造一个通用性极强的生态系统。我们希望确保每一位开发人员，无论他们想要使用哪种方法，都能够找到一个适合自己的位置，并连接到 NEAR 的生态系统。\n\n我们的生态丰富多样，比如 Aurora 是基于 NEAR 区块链开发的 EVM。它提供了一种环境，可以让以太坊现有的 EVM 合约，直接部署在 Aurora 上启动它们，甚至不需要更改任何代码，原生通证也是 ETH，通过 Aurora 引擎自动转换来支付 NEAR 的 gas。我们也通过章鱼网络（超链接）支持 substrate 应用链，它允许用户连接任何类型的额外逻辑。这种逻辑可能不太适合链上计算，通过这种方式以及与区块链上的其他应用程序进行完全可互操作的通信。\n\n显然，我们的原生 runtime 最初是为那些刚接触区块链的开发人员设计的，他们熟悉像 typescript 这样的语言，或更新的且发展迅速的语言比如 rust。它为你提供了一个完全异步的、可扩容的开放平台，在那里你可以根据自己的需要构建拥有不同程度复杂性的应用。\n\n虽然上述这些都是为开发人员设计的，但正如我所说，重点是易用性。我们希望确保开发人员能够构建可供大规模采用的应用程序，现在只有 NEAR 为此做好了准备，因为 NEAR 可以引导非技术用户，这些用户不知道加密学或者私钥、地址等一系列名词。NEAR 区块 1 秒的最终性，几乎是瞬间实现的，并在一定程度上简化了流程，让你感觉你在使用一个互联网应用，同时仍然拥有我们想要的所有这些区块链属性。这些优势让区块链人人可用奠定了基础。\n\n![NEAR 联创一龙：我们已为区块链人人可用做好了准备](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/643ca2b533baec17f86e69dd0d7130c3.jpg-article)\n\n大规模使用意味着需要扩容，你需要能够在基础设施层面上实现这一点。NEAR 从成立之初就被设计成了分片区块链，所以我们正计划在 11 月份对我们的主网进行再分片，让网络的性能提升了 4 倍。\n\n这个过程包含多个步骤，基本是对我们动态扩容愿景的实现。我们目前正在对状态进行分片，分片会在一月份的时候增加大量的验证节点，他们将开始处理交易。处理方式也是并行的，我们会在 2022 年的第三季度实现分片最终阶段。我们会通过动态再分片拥有最终形态的扩容支持，时间大概在 2022 年年底。\n\n分片是这样一个 idea：随着网络和用量的增长，理想状态下我们可能拥有数十亿用户。我们将动态地改变网络中的分片数量以适应该用量，同时我们仍将对每个人保持低费用、低成本，即使网络有非常多的应用和用户。所以这很像一种适合大规模采用的终极基础设施，更重要的是，这种设施已经可用了。\n\n![NEAR 联创一龙：我们已为区块链人人可用做好了准备](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/7ffb37dfbf20bc8235c30ee04ae75cd7.jpg-article)\n\n并非所有的数据以及处理都在公链进行，我们将发布对私有分片的支持。私有分片是这样的一个 idea：你可以在公司防火墙或企业内部运行一个 NEAR 网络分片，在你的企业内部运行防火墙，所有的私有数据和计算都将在那里进行，不会蔓延到公链。你不需要一个联盟来建立它，可以自行启动并开始使用它。你可以在那里启动应用程序，这些应用程序通过与公链的连接，现在可以在公链应用和其他私有分片部署之间交互。\n\n私有分片可让您构建一系列用例，如跟踪多家医院的医疗数据并准确了解数据的去向，或者在不透露数据的情况下，证明某人是否患有某种疾病。同样，大学可以证明某人的 GPA 超过了某个门槛而不会透露学生的所有分数。因此这为您提供了下一波使用案例，即如何将所有这些公司中的私有数据连接在一起，并开始建立强大的协议和应用程序。当我们着手搭建 NEAR 时，我们有这样的愿景：取代人们都在使用的许多现有应用，真正实现这种由自治型 DApp 组成的庞大的生态系统。\n\n![NEAR 联创一龙：我们已为区块链人人可用做好了准备](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/2893e848cf4539b900efe0c1cf1a8e68.jpg-article)\n\n然后聊聊我们的现状。目前我们生态中已有大量应用，它们都是很强大的工具和组件。我们有金融应用，人们可与其交互。NFT 和游戏应用也十分令人激动，我们还成立了用于治理社区组织的 DAO，有很多社区都在使用该工具，显然大量的工具基础设施都借鉴了 DAO。\n\n![NEAR 联创一龙：我们已为区块链人人可用做好了准备](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/1a2965b64bfcb4204fd83f5cfe0e1fcc.jpg-article)\n\n我想重点介绍一个非常酷的案例。今年的淘宝造物节上有一场 NFT 的销售活动，它让那些之前从未拥有过 NFT 的用户可以直接在淘宝下单，注册一个 NEAR 钱包，然后购买 NFT，从而参与到加密经济中。这真的很酷，因为所有这些东西都集中在一起，向所有人展示了 NEAR 简单易上手的优势。\n\n为了进一步增加 NEAR 的易用性，NEAR 即将上线 opera 浏览器。所有的 opera 浏览器用户都可拥有 NEAR 钱包，和 NEAR 应用程序进行无缝交互，无需安装任何应用或进行任何设置。请继续对我们保持关注！\n\n![NEAR 联创一龙：我们已为区块链人人可用做好了准备](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/f1883e60fa5b65b13fa648cb4307e1ee.jpg-article)\n\n现在，我想重点介绍几个已经在 NEAR 上运行的应用程序，其中之一是令我非常兴奋的 NEAR Crowd。因为这是我们在开始开发 NEAR 之前一直在思考的 idea 之一。这是一种通过链上社区收集数据的众包理念，如果你熟悉的话，这类似于亚马逊土耳其机器人，亚马逊土耳其机器人是一个平台，你可以让人们做一些任务，他们为获得一些小额收入选择接受这些任务。使用像以太坊这样的平台是不可能做到这一点的，因为即使是现在最小的费用，也有 10 到 20 美元，前面提到的任务金额通常比这小得多，也便宜得多。\n\n因此自 4 月份推出以来，新的 NEAR Crowd 平台现在总共有 2000 至 3000 名用户，每天有 1500 名活跃用户。人们每天都在那里工作，我们已经收集了超过一百万个数据样本。更重要的是，这使人们能够获得谋生需要的收入，从厌恶自己的工作这一心态，向他们愿为某个平台、社区或生态工作这样的心态转变，并在某种程度上获得不错的收入并参与加密经济。\n\n![NEAR 联创一龙：我们已为区块链人人可用做好了准备](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/0114efb1a75d4d2bf5523ba9bb6fd178.jpg-article)\n\n我想重点介绍另一个的应用是 Sputnik DAO （Astro），它是 DAO 的基础设施。我真的不喜欢 DAO 这个名字，因为它有点误导，我更喜欢数字合作这样的称呼，你可以让许多人聚在一起，以数字化的形式共同拥有这个组织，并有能力做一些事情比如管理应用、管理协议、共同投资、协调捐款并支付费用。比如说，作为一个团队，你想要完成一些工作，你可以给它分配一定数量的钱，然后给完成这项工作的人支付这笔钱。这类工具已经被社区和 NEAR 公会用来协调工作、投资、对开发哪些项目进行决策做出决定。您可在 astrodao.com 或 sputnik.fund 查看，来与不同的界面交互。\n\n![NEAR 联创一龙：我们已为区块链人人可用做好了准备](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/23fc4132c99bcc034d895350ca3a92fb.jpg-article)\n\n接下来我会向大家分享未来的发展方向。我们有一个长期愿景，但人们现在可以做些什么呢？就目前来看，下一波新浪潮将会是一套开放网络应用程序的通用协议，这些东西将为日常应用提供动力，如即时通讯工具和社交网络这些缺失的部分，从而开始真正创造出巨大的网络效应，以达到我们大规模采用的目的。比如， 有一个社交图谱协议，该协议允许人们拥有关于其他朋友身份的数据以及工作人员和朋友之间的关系数据，并能够在不同的应用程序之间切换，所有这些都集成到这些应用程序中，想象一下这样的脸书和领英。\n\n![NEAR 联创一龙：我们已为区块链人人可用做好了准备](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/bb4f7dffb090681f7b6aa37febb30194.jpg-article)\n\n不断学习很重要，不断自我教育也很重要。向大家推荐几个 NEAR 的网站，其中一个是 NEAR blog，我们试图在那里发布 NEAR 的技术，以及在更广泛的生态系统中存在的其他技术的一个概览。另一方面，我们推出了 NEAR 大学栏目，我们希望通过该栏目，为大家开发真实的应用，让人们学习如何成为开发人员，非技术人员和技术人员都可参加。\n\n![NEAR 联创一龙：我们已为区块链人人可用做好了准备](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/794ab8a1795b4ac61b90821c8f20b26e.jpg-article)\n\n最后要说的是，总的来说，在开放网络整个生态中有很多机会，我在此诚邀各位创业者和开发人员参加。希望大家加入这个行列，找到一个协议或平台应用，甚至是一个你有兴趣为之做出贡献的生态系统并开始行动起来。我们有很多途径可以让你获得资金，如 grants，社区和创业基金，MetaWeb Ventures，创业加速器 OWC，以及为你的项目提供投资的风投等投资基金\n\n谢谢大家！\n\n**免责声明：本文仅供参考，不得被用作法律、税务、投资、理财或任何其他建议。**\n\n[!NEAR

Os preços variam de minuto a minuto, em um mercado que funciona 24/7 e com perigos em muitos diferentes níveis.\n\nO Bitcoin, embora esteja por aí por mais de uma década e tenha visto muitas outras moedas aparecerem e desaparecerem, não está livre de risco.\n\nEntão não aposte as economias da sua vida em nenhuma moeda.\n\n## Pesquise profundamente\n\nAntes de investir em qualquer quantia significativa de dinheiro em qualquer moeda digital, gaste algumas horas pesquisando a tecnologia para você compreender qual a proposta de valor e os riscos (\"Alguém vai comprar de você a um preço mais alto\" não é proposta de valor)\n\nLeia tudo o que você encontrar sobre o assunto, entre nas comunidades e nos mailings dos devs, ouça os podcasts. Leia livros não somente sobre criptomoedas, mas também sobre criptografia, teoria dos jogos e modelos econômicos.\n\nParticipe de meetups (tão logo o Covid-19 não ofereça mais perigo), faça muitas perguntas e se você não estiver entendendo o que você está escutando, não tenha vergonha de pedir para alguém explicar. Se ainda assim você não compreender, não assuma que o problema é você: as pessoas podem apenas estar falando bobagens. Desconfie de pessoas que investem tempo em te ajudar mas estão apenas querendo vender o próprio peixe (porque assim que ela te convencer a comprar, provavelmente os preços vão subir e ela será muito beneficiada).\n\nE mesmo que você esteja convencido, procure os céticos e considere seus argumentos.\n\nAssim que você considerar que pesquisou tudo o que havia disponível, tenha a certeza de que ainda não foi o suficiente.\n\n## Resista ao FOMO\n\nSe o único motivo pelo qual você está investindo em algo é para evitar *perder o bonde*, corre o sério risco de perder tudo.\n\nFear of missing out é o caminho certo para você perder toda a riqueza que conseguiu acumular através dos anos. O problema é a reação instintiva a algo que deveria ser pesquisado primeiro.\n\nConheça o que você está comprando. Abrir um app e ver que uma moeda subiu 30% nas últimas 24 horas não é pesquisa e você pode ser o azarado a se expor a uma moeda que está em vias de cair vertiginosamente.\n\nTodas as moedas têm baleias, todas as moedas tem pump and dump (e seus promotores marketeiros). Não se entregue à pressão do mercado. Avalie essa oportunidade de investimento pelos seus méritos.\n\nPesquise e pesquise novamente.\n\n## Se parece bom demais para ser verdade, provavelmente é\n\nO ecossistema de criptomoedas está repleto de charlatães. Vemos 'especialistas' por todos os lados. Todos os projetos que aparecem 'irão ultrapassar o Bitcoin'. O único caminho é pesquisar.\n\nCompradores e vendedores precisam estar atentos. Algumas exchanges oferecem alavancagem de até 100x e a impressão de que é muito fácil lucrar está ali a um clique de você perder tudo em segundos.\n\n## Não confie, verifique\n\nScammers, golpistas, são abundantes nesse mercado. Muitos se passam por influenciadores, utilizando contas falsas somente com o intuito de fazer você enviar pequenas quantidades de cripto com a promessa de retorno multiplicado e garantido. Ou pedem o envio de qualquer quantia somente para validar o endereço.\n\nLinkando com o tópico anterior, tudo o que parece bom demais para ser verdade acende um sinal vermelho de alerta.\n\n## Cuidado com o viés de unidade\n\nSó porque uma moeda está custando R$1, não significa que ela é mais barata que um bitcoin a $60k. Nem todas as moedas são criadas da mesma forma.\n\nTemos milhares de criptomoedas diferentes, que emulam o Bitcoin ou tentam resolver os seus 'problemas'. E todas variam em muitos níveis quando do suporte ou da descentralização.\n\nDeterminar o valor de uma moeda começa perguntando o porquê dela ter sido criada. Qual a sua utilidade? Quem está trabalhando nela? Qual o tamanho da comunidade de desenvolvedores? Quão ativo é o repositório no github? Qual o histórico dos devs? Considere que uma construção demanda manutenção constante e estruturas abandonadas ficam suscetíveis a problemas.\n\nÉ crucial entender qual o modelo de segurança envolvido - proof-of work, proof-of-stake, ou outro? Se for o primeiro, qual o hashrate comparado ao de outras coins PoW? E se você não estiver ainda habituado a esses termos, você não está pronto ainda para investir.\n\n## Not your keys, not your coins\n\nCriptomoedas são ativos como o dinheiro cash ou jóias, significando que o detentor do mesmo é o real dono. E uma vez perdido ou roubado, se foi para sempre.\n\nÉ por isso que você sempre escutará para não deixar as chaves criptográficas nas mãos de um terceiro, como uma exchange. Há muitos casos de hacking, rug pulls ou exit scams nesse mercado, devido a muitos lugares não terem uma regulação para este mercado.\n\nO mercado DeFi ainda é muito novo e muitas falhas ainda irão acontecer, e mesmo grandes plataformas como a Binance sofrem com falhas recentemente.\n\nNo entanto, se você for o guardião das suas próprias chaves criptográficas (com um dispositivo de hardware, papel, metal, etc.) pode ser fácil se bagunçar ou se perder, e é por isso que muitas pessoas terceirizam a guarda das chaves.\n\nCripto é sobre trade-offs. Você é organizado e disciplinado para não perder um pedaço de papel ou esquecer a sua 'seed' (aquela sequência de palavras que recupera a sua chave privada)? Se não, você deve ficar confortável com alguém guardando as chaves por você e todos os riscos que isso envolve, principalmente em caso de eventualidades.\n\n## Você pode comprar uma fração de bitcoin (e da maioria das outras criptos)\n\nVocê não precisa comprar um bitcoin inteiro. Bitcoin possui oito casas decimais. Caso esteja curioso como ele funciona, você pode comprar R$10 para ter essa experiência. Melhor ainda de transferir uma quantia para uma carteira em sua posse. A experiência de ter seu bitcoin com você pela primeira vez só pode ser sentida, e não explicada.\n\n## Entenda sobre taxação e impostos\n\nO Brasil já possui regras sobre como certos impostos incidem sobre os investimentos em criptomoedas. Não ache que você consegue enganar o fisco ao operar em uma exchange, pois todas as transações são reportadas aos reguladores. Todas. Converse com um contador, explique o que você está fazendo e compreenda como e em quais situações você terá que pagar impostos.\n\nMesmo não sendo plenamente regulamentado, saiba que recentemente o presidente do Banco Central já avisou que no Brasil eles identificarão qualquer transação de criptomoeda.\n\n## Compre usando a técnica do preço médio e não se preocupe tanto com o preço atual\n\nVocê pode ter uma vida e ainda investir em criptomoedas. Os mercados flutuam todos os dias, todas as horas, minuto a minuto, mas qualquer cripto que valha a pena será um investimento de longo prazo. Se você quiser uma boa dose de dopamina, vá saltar de paraquedas. Normalmente está aí a diferença entre um investidor e um apostador.\n\nE é possível investir sem ficar obcecado? Sim, e uma das alternativas mais seguras é utilizar a técnica do preço médio. Compre em intervalos regulares (diariamente? semanalmente? mensalmente? Você escolhe) e não olhe mais para o preço.\n\nSe você estiver olhando para o longo prazo, não se sentirá pressionado a vender ou aumentar a sua posição baseado nos movimentos de curto-prazo.\n\nO sentido deste artigo não é assustar e afastar as pessoas dessa área tão fascinante e potencialmente tão transformadora, mas garantir a quem chegar que esteja atento e de olhos abertos a certos detalhes desse mercado.", "timestamp": 1635442782, "digest": "iIijEYXCxiwXUEgNUs183iyI0QDf1l1jk6-Y82i_uyw", "contributor": "0x395cCC5CBF47717f1D4Dec6a7e050B8c3972642f"}
{"id": "vJ-uiompYS-DlF-cHKiPhcSywV-Tpd9RioS3Xq0sGeA", "title": "[ Convex Research ] Wallets de Criptomoedas", "body": "## O que são wallets de criptomoedas?\n\nPodemos fazer uma analogia com as nossas carteiras, onde guardamos nosso dinheiro e nossos cartões. A diferença é que essas são digitais e nelas armazenaremos nossos cripto-ativos como criptomoedas, tokens, NFTs, credenciais, etc.\n\nTecnicamente, normalmente as wallets são peças de software que gerenciam as chaves privadas, usadas para assinar as transações que são enviadas para os blockchains de cada protocolo ou criptomoeda.\n\nPodemos utilizar uma mesma chave privada para derivarmos diversos endereços de wallet, permitindo que tenhamos, por exemplo, uma wallet para cada tipo de situação: uma pessoal, uma profissional, uma atuando como poupança e uma para interagirmos com certos softwares.\n\n## Custodial ou não-custodial?\n\nExiste uma diferenciação muito importante entre as wallets custodiais e as não-custodiais.\n\nBasicamente, se o aplicativo de wallet gerenciar a própria chave privada, como descrito acima, significa que esta é uma wallet não-custodial. \n\nNela, os fundos ficam sob sua guarda e responsabilidade. E é muito importante que a chave privada (ou a seed - aquela sequência de palavras) seja armazenada com segurança, inclusive com backups e preferencialmente de maneira offline. Uma vez perdida a chave privada, não será possível recuperar a sua wallet em caso de formatação ou perda do dispositivo. \n\nEmbora esse tipo de wallet nos exija uma maior diligência e responsabilidade, ela possui mais segurança e nos traz maior autonomia sobre nossos ativos.\n\nPor outro lado, as wallets custodiais normalmente apresentam melhor usabilidade, visto que os fundos nela armazenados, são gerenciados por um terceiro ao qual confiamos a guarda da nossa chave privada.\n\nUma melhor usabilidade implica, infelizmente, em centralização e maior risco para os nossos fundos. E por quê?\n\nUm exemplo de wallet custodial são as fornecidas por exchanges. Os aplicativos mobile das exchanges apenas mostram nossos saldos e é a exchange quem armazena e gerencia a nossa chave privada. E armazenam a nossa, assim como as de outros milhares de clientes.\n\nAo fazer isso, as exchanges se tornam um ponto de vulnerabilidade, muito cobiçado por hackers. Basicamente, por exemplo, ao invés de o hacker tentar invadir centenas de milhares de dispositivos mobile diferentes, ele prepara um ataque à uma exchange e, em caso de sucesso, terá acesso aos fundos de muitos clientes ao mesmo tempo.\n\nAtaques à exchanges acontecem a todo momento e muitos fundos são perdidos. Mesmo as grandes exchanges, que possuem controles de segurança e compliance muito mais rígidos, estão suscetíveis a ataques. Podemos citar uma falha de segurança muito recente na Coinbase, que permitiu que aproximadamente seis mil clientes tivessem suas criptomoedas roubadas.\n\nDentro do ecossistema é comum utilizarmos o termo *‘not your keys, not your coins’* (sem suas chaves, sem suas moedas - o que é uma verdade), mas a escolha entre uma wallet custodial e uma não-custodial deve sempre tentar balancear a usabilidade e a segurança, para que você tenha encontre um equilíbrio no seu dia-a-dia.\n\nExemplo: se você faz trade diariamente, deixe na exchange somente o montante adequado para os trades, e o restante (assim como o lucro realizado), armazene em uma wallet não-custodial, com você.\n\n## Tipos de wallets não-custodiais\n\nExistem diversos tipos de wallets não-custodiais, com diferentes níveis de segurança e usabilidade. Para se ter idéia, podemos armazenar nosso bitcoin até em papel!\n\nEmbora não seja o meio mais recomendado, pois papel pode pegar umidade ou ser destruído em caso de incêndio, é uma maneira muito utilizada para armazenar a chave privada de maneira off-line, fora da internet. \n\nChamadas de *paper wallets*, elas contém impressos (algumas delas mostrando um qr-code) a chave privada (para conseguir sacar os valores) e um endereço público (para efetuar os depósitos). Elas são muito úteis quando se deseja presentear alguém com criptomoedas.\n\nUma alternativa mais durável que a *paper wallet*, são as wallets de metal: você grava a seed em uma placa de metal para evitar a deterioração por umidade ou a destruição por fogo.\n\nWallets de software são muito utilizadas e podem aparecer em formato de aplicativo mobile, desktop ou plugin para browser. Alguns exemplos bastante conhecidos são a Trust Wallet, Metamask, a Electrum ou a Exodus.\n\nA dica aqui é tratar a wallet mobile como a carteira que você leva ao bolso: você não guarda todo o seu salário na carteira que anda pela rua todos os dias. Utilize a wallet mobile para valores pequenos, e somas maiores ficam em um dispositivo mais adequado e seguro, como uma wallet desktop ou uma hardware wallet.\n\nAs hardware wallet são equipamentos que normalmente permanecem offline (também conhecidos como cold wallets, por não estarem diretamente conectadas à internet) e apresentam um nível de segurança muito alto para fazer o gerenciamento de milhares de criptomoedas.\n\nNestes dispositivos, a sua chave privada fica armazenada em um chip e nunca é exposta publicamente. A interação com o computador normalmente se dá através da porta usb, por bluetooth ou mesmo exibindo um qr-code que será lido pelo computador.\n\nExistem fabricantes que se destacam no mercado como a Ledger, Trezor ou a Passport e, embora mais caras, apresentam um nível de segurança muito alto contra hacking ou falhas - e são muito aconselháveis para o armazenamento seguro dos seus cripto-ativos.", "timestamp": 1635442871, "digest": "QmQeYybFEgAL4F_srPqadXKcDKDXHxIw_CZdWQnv9v0", "contributor": "0x395cCC5CBF47717f1D4Dec6a7e050B8c3972642f"}

Beem offers creators the most advanced video and NFT tools in one place to create new content and experiences, engage and grow their community, monetize their craft, and bring their fans into the Open Metaverse, while maintaining control over their intellectual property.\n\n### Beem is a tokenized virtual venue and toolkit for interactive live events, video distribution, community engagement and content monetization.\n\n![live events on Beem](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yyYL0QsAjACPwofKUhDZ7.png?height=1687&width=2817)\n\nOn Beem, creators can **upload their content**, **distribute it** easily for free or for a fee, and **create interactive live events** in a few clicks with full ticketing management. They can invite guests and fans on stage and interact seamlessly with their communities via live video and chat. Participants can join from any device (desktop browser, iOS and Android apps) and easily cast the show to their TV through Airplay or Chromecast. Creators can also stream their event to other platforms such as YouTube Live, Twitch or Facebook Live to reach the largest audience possible and bring those followers into their own space on Beem **for more interaction and greater monetization**. The content created during these live events is recorded and then available to be replayed. Creators can get paid in cash or in crypto, as we natively accept both forms of payment. Soon, each piece of content, event ticket and content access key created on Beem will be an **[NFT](https://digiday.com/media/wtf-is-an-nft/)** (Non-Fungible Token, a unique digital asset representing a certificate of ownership or access to an assigned item), unlocking real content ownership and direct fandom relationships.\n\nWe started working on Beem in early 2018 (stealth name: Unchained, check out our [whitepaper](https://assets.website-files.com/5ffe37090082ae5274693991/6170a559e360594446e4a950_Unchained%20WP%20-%20V%201.2.pdf)) on the principle that **NFTs will power [Web3](https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b)**, the next evolution of the digital economy, thanks to tokenized content ownership, decentralized intellectual property rights management, programmatic royalties and digital collectibles.\n\n![let's quickly skip to the ownership economy please](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooadBOm38DTtH6cDpy5op.png?height=1155&width=2056)\n\nWe knew that the video space was the most promising to apply these concepts, and we set our aim at creating a complete **blockchain-based video platform** for creators and their communities. But we soon realized that the Web3 technologies were not mature and scalable enough for mass-market deployment and adoption. We decided to start by building the most challenging part of the platform, a state-of-the-art high-performance, low latency video stack with live content and ticketing management systems. We created it, launched it, and market-proved it.  \n **Creators and audiences alike loved it!**\n\n \n In the last 12 months, creators have been using [Beem](https://watchbeem.com/) to **host live concerts**, **podcast recordings**, **interactive workshops**, **film premieres** and festivals with **live Q&As**, and **engaging fundraisers**. Beem has provided a unique stage for thousands of public and private events, with tens of thousands of user registrations, and dozens of thousands USD raised for nonprofits and cultural projects. We gained invaluable feedback from both our creators and their communities. We discovered that after experiencing a **unified toolkit** like Beem, creators don’t plan to go back to the messy patchwork of Zoom, YouTube Live, Vimeo, Streamyard, Eventbrite, Mailchimp, Patreon, and the dozen other tools they currently use to grow their business, connect with their communities and distribute and monetize their content. \n \n\n```\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/639859358?h=032012caef&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" title=\"Zoom vs. Beem\"></iframe></div><script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"></script>\n```\n\nEstablished creators and businesses can also choose to use our white-label solution and fully customize their space with their **own URL, identity, branding, content, and events**. They have direct access to their audience with tools to engage and interact with, as well as analytics to know everything about their live events performance, content distribution, and expected income while **maintaining ownership over their content**.\n\n## Entering the ownership economy\n\n \n Who actually owns the content on the internet? Where is it stored? How can we verify its IP (Intellectual Property) ownership? Many creators are getting their accounts [deleted without explanation](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1447629947284099077), or their content gets suddenly demonetized. This means the abrupt end of their revenue stream, of their community, and potentially of the entire personal brand and the business they worked hard to build over years. Protecting and controlling their content storage, their online presence (audience and community) and their IP (assets, brand, identity) have now become paramount to them.\n\nWe strongly believe that NFTs will be progressively adopted as the **leading standard** to solve most of the shortfalls of **digital media**, **content ownership**, and **monetization**:\n\n* Content distribution from centralized gatekeeping platforms is being replaced by **direct-to-fan distribution** with creators being their own platform, only using tech infrastructures such as Beem as underlying distribution protocols\n* As automatically-enforced **social contracts**, NFTs and social tokens allow communities to gather around common passions, interests and goals, and profit from it socially and potentially financially, without being tied to a specific platform. The traditional 20th-century marketing approach is replaced by **community building** where fans become genuine stakeholders of a creator’s work by contributing time and money at every step of the creative process. They do so in exchange for a stake, ownership, royalties, revenues, and **social signalling** along with **privileges** inside the community such as exclusive events, premium content **unlocking**, loyalty and **fanship** systems, and participation in the creator’s decisions ([VeeFriends](https://nftevening.com/veefriends-how-gary-vee-made-utility-the-new-thing-with-his-top-nft-collection/) is an example of this) \n* As digital assets that can be minted (created) by anyone with proven and guaranteed **scarcity** and verifiable source of **provenance**, **ownership** and **historicity**, NFTs allow the market to put a value on a digital item and can command a premium for rarity and scarcity with high demand \n \n\nAt Beem, we are now deploying NFT [smart contracts](https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts) at the core of our system to create a **seamless interface** between the performance and usability of Web2 and the [ownership economy](https://variant.fund/writing/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software) enabled by Web3. We started on the Ethereum blockchain, but we believe in a **multi-chain future** and are already integrating other chains and [Layer 2s](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrency-layer-2-scaling-solutions). By allowing creators to mint NFTs with the metadata stored on decentralized storage like IPFS and Arweave, Beem will offer a streamlined and **transparent IP ownership solution for video creators** who want to securely store and distribute their content. The content (media + metadata) is interoperable and doesn't depend on a centralized infrastructure, so the creator is in full control of it.\n\n![high level view of the decentralized infrastructure](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M2VNw3aDodvt6DL8jrZEi.png?height=1022&width=1409)\n\nAs for the monetization, Beem already offers multiple solutions to creators (both in crypto and [fiat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp)): **ticketing**, **pay-per-view**, **tips** and **fundraising**, brands **sponsorships**, and soon **token-gating** (NFTs and social tokens) with fan **subscriptions**, digital **collectibles**, and physical **merch** stores. As we progressively deploy our smart contracts, we will add new ways for creators to automatically **split revenues** and royalties between different participants, enabling the creation of **media Distributed Autonomous Organizations** ([DAOs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2021/06/01/what-are-daos-and-why-you-should-pay-attention/)).\n\n## The video stack of the Open Metaverse\n\n \n In 2021 NFTs went mainstream as more and more people and [large corporations](https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/spongebob-nft-viacomcbs-recur-1235088069/#!) understand their use and foresee their potential. Indeed, NFTs can carry multiple characteristics and underlying values: **characters** more or less **exclusive** and valued ([Bored Apes](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bored-ape-yacht-club-the-celebrity-nft-of-choice), [Cool Cats](https://www.coolcatsnft.com/), etc.), **virtual real estate** (in [SandBox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/) maybe next to [SnoopDogg’s mansion](https://medium.com/sandbox-game/the-sandbox-partners-with-snoop-dogg-to-bring-legendary-rapper-into-the-metaverse-e064e866ed40) - owned by himself), a piece of **generative art** ([Art Blocks](https://www.artblocks.io/) collections) or a **music album** (from [3LAU](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/3lau-streaming-rights-royalties-nft-crypto-marketplace-1230638/) for example). They become (part of) your **online identity** and signal your passion and emotional attachment while allowing you to access communities with special privileges - your VIP entry to a global club.\n\n![do you have your Snoop Dogg private party pass?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YiCMGSDpRUf0iddDHJZ4g.png?height=433&width=691)\n\nWhen combined with **enhanced visualization** (virtual worlds, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality), **gamification** (open games, play-to-earn), content & personal **brand creation** (creators economy), and **decentralization** (democratized and permissionless playfield) with **digital asset ownership** it all converges into the so-called **Open Metaverse**, the shared virtual space where digital assets and identities are interconnected and fluid. \n **Blockchains are the fabric of those universes and NFTs are the building blocks.**\n\nAt Beem, we believe that NFTs will be a crucial part of the toolbox of every video creator, curator and influencer as most communities are evolving to much richer experiences happening in live interactive virtual events. Soon on Beem, creators and their communities will be able to create token-gated events and content: only people with a specific token in their wallet will be able to access them, creating a stronger sense of community for all the holders. Anyone will be able to showcase their NFTs on stage, use them as their avatar or 3D model on camera, in the chat and in their profile, maintaining their Metaverse identities inside their virtual communities. Beem’s long-term engagement is to continuously enrich the platform to allow deeper cultural and technical integrations for more pervasive Metaverse experiences. \n\n## Take ownership of Beem\n\n \n Beem sits at the intersection of **3 markets in hypergrowth**: the **creators economy** ([$100B+](https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-earnings-benchmark-report/), +50% YoY), **live virtual events** ([$100B](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/virtual-events-market), expected to grow at a 24% CAGR for the next 6 years), and **NFTs** (probably [>25B$ in 2021](https://www.reuters.com/article/fintech-nft-q3-idCAKBN2GU298), growing x275 YoY). Beem generates revenues through a commission model that is a fair and transparent model for everyone: we charge up to 15% on ticket sales and video revenues, with a reduced commission for collectibles and merch, fundraising, and additional revenue streams. We also charge a monthly fee to creators and businesses who upgrade to a customized white-labeled environment (called BeemPro).\n\nOur globally distributed team comes from a partnership between [Grey Juice Lab](https://www.greyjuicelab.com/about), a worldwide market leader in **video distribution** and **content licensing**, and [3SS](https://www.3ss.tv/), the most advanced multi-device carrier-grade video platform provider, led by entrepreneurs with strong experience in consumer-facing video services and crypto products. To experiment with premium content, we reached licensing deals with Major Studios such as **Paramount** for their most iconic titles to be used during fan-produced live interactive experiences.\n\nWe are here for the long run, with a 10 year vision: becoming the **leading video content and talent marketplace of Web3**. We envision a suite of decentralized protocols managing how any piece of digital content can be bought, rented, prepaid, crowdfunded, leased, staked, [fractionalized](https://fractional.art/), marketed, distributed and monetized in multiple ways, in a direct interaction between creators, brands, and their fans and communities. To allow creators to coordinate the creation of content, Beem will also make it easy to find talent, contract them, collaborate with them live on video and give them immediate shared ownership over the content and its attached revenue streams through media DAOs. Communities will then get rewarded to participate in the [content curation process](https://hackernoon.com/what-are-token-curated-registries-and-decentralized-lists-d33fa42ba167) as well as the marketing of this content.\n\nNow the best part: **we want you to be part of our journey toward becoming the most vibrant Web3 video ecosystem**. Our objective is to raise $10M in the coming year to execute on our bold vision. On top of VCs, it is of paramount importance for us to give you, our early community, the ability to invest and get your fair share of Beem’s success. Likewise, we’ve reserved equity to reward Beem’s most committed creators. **It’s time for creators to become stakeholders in their means of production!** If we are to make Beem a huge success, we want this success to be shared.\n\nFor that reason, we’ve launched a [rolling SAFE](https://blog.fairmint.co/a-new-era-of-high-resolution-fundraising-the-rolling-safe-1fb67eee68ab), available today on [invest.watchbeem.com](https://invest.watchbeem.com/). It behaves like a traditional [SAFE](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/) (Simple Agreement for Future Equity - a model pioneered by Y Combinator), except that it’s continuous, i.e. there are no rounds happening every now and then, reserved for a select few. Indeed, we wanted our rolling SAFE to be as inclusive and fair as possible:\n\n* **Inclusive**: our rolling SAFE never closes, it is literally always open for investment. You can invest today, tomorrow, in a few months or next year\n* **Fair**: the earlier you invest, the more attractive valuation you’ll secure. To reward earlier investors, the valuation of our rolling SAFE increases as we raise more money\n\nIf you want to be part of the greatest journey to reinvent video creation, distribution and monetization for Web3, don’t delay: [join us today](https://invest.watchbeem.com/).\n\nInvestments can be made through bank transfers, as well as in crypto (BTC, ETH, USDC). All the documents can be accessed and signed online, so in 10 min you can become an investor in Beem. Additionally, you have full visibility in real-time of the value of the company, how much was raised to date, and from how many investors.\n\nParticipation in Beem comes with full transparency: we’re building in public, and anyone can take part in our daily discussions, get a first peek at our new features, help us bootstrap the content curation process, or request a free demo by joining us on our Discord 👉  [watchbeem.com/discord](https://watchbeem.com/discord)\n\nAlso, **we’re hiring** 👋\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1635447801, "digest": "rbIsxr_OEDyhOMEX8UsDYyL-m_IR6mRM8CgopLTOkpI", "contributor": "0x42a63047a1cD8449e3E70aDEB7363C4Ca01DB528"}
{"id": "8Gb6-_ADvNF4Bx9z8QaLyuNWVF8quVA0La7gB6H0Xnw", "title": "Why DAO?", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CI3H84Y76wm77mc8dIsDa.gif?height=270&width=480)\n\nCommunities are inherently valuable. They bring together members’ resources, skills, knowledge, and experiences to create value for members and other people who engage with them. From crowd-sourcing advice to supporting non-profit causes and even reality show favourites, communities have historically been used to accomplish and advance all kinds of goals. For instance, in many African societies, community-based initiatives like cooperative societies are an age-long vehicle for enabling millions of unbanked people to access credit and other financial services.\n\nAs we have spent more of our time on the internet over the last few years, we’ve created and established more of these communities online. We’re part of groups on WhatsApp, Facebook, Reddit, Quora and so on. These internet-based communities are able to leverage even more resources and run more efficiently because there are no geographical boundaries to membership. People from different backgrounds can bring diverse perspectives and skills to make their communities more valuable. The influence and value of these communities are also able to reach more people worldwide. Communities no longer have to be made up of just people who look like us; they can be formed around more diverse factors like ideologies, hobbies, and even arbitrary interests.\n\nDepending on the community goals, physical communities can often create and give financial value to their members. For instance, a local community of teachers could pool money together to start a business that allows the members to split profits. They can do this because it’s easier to develop the level of trust and coordination required to manage financial resources when community members are in close proximity to one another.\n\nThis isn’t the case for online communities where members tend to be strangers spread out across the globe. It’s near impossible to build trust and coordinate decisions. For instance, if you’re part of an online group of digital art enthusiasts and your group decides to go beyond discussing art to maintaining a collection, it could be almost impossible to manage. As such, the financial value created by internet-based communities today ends up being captured by the community “leader” or the host platform (e.g. Reddit).\n\n**To financially co-ordinate, members would need:**\n\n* A legal backing to enforce rules and regulations within the group. To do that, you would need to register the community as an entity. It becomes a logistical nightmare if it’s a large group of people from different countries, as is typical with internet-based communities. You’d have to handle conflict over what jurisdiction the entity should be in and any other complications that arise because the law isn’t always interoperable across borders.\n* A bank account to make and receive payments. Again, we have the same logistical and legal challenges from the point above. You’d need to be able to pool money together and manage the group’s finances transparently and conveniently. This requires the community to trust one person (or a few people) to act as custodian(s) of the fund. Even if members vote a certain way, they have to trust the custodians to do right by them. If pieces from a collection get sold, you also have to figure out disbursements to individual accounts.\n* A scalable way to make decisions in a manner that is democratic and fair. While a public poll could work for some kinds of decisions, coordinating high-stakes (i.e. financial) activities with strangers demands the most transparent tools for making and enforcing decisions. You need to ensure that no single community member can change anything without the group’s explicit consent.\n\nThese points boil down to the need to have a central theoretically-neutral entity that the group/community can “trust” — whether it’s a government, a bank or a voting tool. Having members across the globe makes the first two nearly impossible. It makes it difficult to create any kind of sustainable community-owned organisation with a financial component.\n\nA Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an internet-native type of organisation that solves these problems using [blockchain technology](https://digitalartifacts.substack.com/p/blockchains). It eliminates the need to trust any human or central entity by maintaining these three parts of the organisation on a publicly accessible and unchangeable ledger called a blockchain.\n\nThe rules of a DAO are written as code (in smart contracts) and deployed to the blockchain. Once deployed, they will consistently execute as written and cannot be changed except through a previously agreed-upon mechanism. DAOs don’t receive their legitimacy from a government (agency); instead, they do so through their community’s coordination and incentive structures and the rules enforced on the blockchain.\n\n**Going back to the previous example, here’s how organising your online group of art enthusiasts as a DAO would work:**\n\n* It would be “registered” on the blockchain as a smart contract or set of smart contracts. Before the DAO is established, members agree on the rules and regulations, and those rules are converted into code and become the organisation’s binding constitution. The code is visible to all. Once deployed to the blockchain, they can only change the smart contract by a method already programmed into it. Because anyone with a wallet address can participate, there’s no geographical limitation. Everybody is a citizen of the internet, and the rules are enforced equally.\n* Voting in DAOs is done on the blockchain (referred to as on-chain governance), so everybody can see the results. The winning decisions are executed automatically as part of the smart contract. Community members could all be in the same place or distributed — it doesn’t matter. The community can reach conclusions in a manner that is democratic, inclusive and transparent.\n* The DAO’s fund (called a treasury) will also be held transparently on the blockchain. The smart contract will contain and enforce the rules around how funds will be disbursed. For instance, you could decide that at least 60% of the DAO members must sign a transaction before sending money out of the treasury. You could also program it to send 60% of art sales revenue into the DAO treasury and disburse the rest to members according to their contribution. This will all happen automatically and transparently, and you won’t need any member to oversee it after the contract has been deployed.\n\nYou can think of DAOs as a cross between a company and a cooperative society. While it’s a separate entity that can conduct business, employ other people, make investments etc., it is owned by all the members, and they get to participate in decision making.\n\nMost DAOs have a token that is used for governance. Each member of the DAO is a shareholder (or token holder) and can vote to the degree of their token ownership. They can propose changes within the organisation and rally other members to vote for their ideas. In some cases, e.g. with Uniswap’s UNI token, the DAO’s governance token also has market value and can be traded. This leads to additional value accrual to DAO members if the token price rises in the market. However, a noteworthy argument against having governance tokens with market value is that it could lead to misalignment of incentives such that it attracts people who only care about flipping the token for a profit but don’t care about the DAO’s mission.\n\n### DAO Applications\n\n* Product-Building DAOs: You can set up a DAO to build and launch products for public use. For instance, PartyDAO was created to build PartyBid, a tool that allows people to bid on digital assets collectively. The DAO started with an [initial crowdfund](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) on the Ethereum blockchain that was open to people from everywhere in the world. Backers would fund with Ether and receive $PARTY tokens. Holders of the $PARTY token own the product and any other product that the DAO launches. They collectively make decisions about the product(s), and as the product grows, they’ll receive any financial upside.\n* User-owned Products: Organizations can use the DAO structure to empower users of a product to become owners. Users can receive ownership tokens that give them decision-making abilities and entitle them to profits. Redistributing profit to users in this way tends to make the users even stronger product evangelists. An example of this is the decentralised publishing platform and DAO, Mirror. Users can become owners of the platform by earning and burning their $WRITE token. As more users contribute to the platform’s growth by publishing high-quality content, they will eventually also earn financial rewards. Imagine every Facebook user being able to make decisions about how Facebook is governed and being entitled to a revenue share in Facebook.\n* Independent Media Organizations: Special interest media groups such as journalists could form a DAO focused on publishing the kinds of stories they want to tell without restrictions from “top management”. Through the DAO, they can crowdfund as a collective, hire writers (who might not be DAO members), commission work for revenue, publish their work and split profits. The members can be anywhere on the planet and could even be pseudonymous. They don’t need to know each other, and they would still be able to coordinate effectively.\n* Venture DAOs: A group of people could create a DAO as a vehicle to invest in ventures and projects as a collective. They would pool together their funds in the DAO treasury and vote together on deals. The DAO can also own non-fungible digital assets, and its members will essentially hold ownership stakes of the asset. [Komorebi Collective](https://syndicate.io/syndicate/komorebi_collective) is a Venture DAO focused on funding female and non-binary crypto founders.\n\n### Considerations to organising as a DAO\n\nWhile DAOs are effective for coordinating financial incentives and decisions in community-based groups, they are not suited for all kinds of organisations.\n\nThere are cases in which having several decision-makers could slow down or reduce the quality of decision making. Some DAOs mitigate this problem by allowing token holders to delegate their votes to other users. DAOs requiring a high degree of mission alignment or knowledge solve this by restricting membership access to only people to meet specific pre-defined criteria. For instance, Mirror’s $WRITE tokens aren’t available for sale publicly. Every week Mirror airdrops ten tokens to prospective members who are voted in by existing members. The culture and community DAO, Friends With Benefits requires prospective members to fill out an application to get approved even if they have the required tokens. There is ongoing research and several theories about the optimal number of DAO members to maintain speed and quality in decision-making.\n\nAnother primary consideration with setting up as a DAO is that vulnerabilities can be fatal. Since with DAOs, the smart contract is essentially law, if there are any bugs deployed to the blockchain, it will enforce them as part of the contract. Fixing these vulnerabilities will require DAO members to submit proposals and vote, all of which can take some time depending on the previously written rules in the contract. Generally speaking, there is no “human mediation” to speed up the process or make any quick fixes until all the rules are followed. This is by design and is one of the things that makes smart contracts so powerful and valuable.\n\nLastly, because DAOs are not yet popularly recognised as legal entities that can run separately from the owners by governments, they are currently more suited to organising digital over physical property. However, some progressive governments are beginning to give DAOs legitimacy within their jurisdiction. The Wyoming government recently passed the Wyoming DAO bill legitimising DAOs as a type of organisation similar to an LLC that can “form and operate for any lawful purpose, regardless of whether for profit” separately from the individual members.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDAOs can be used to achieve anything from one-off projects to non-profit initiatives, full-blown companies, and long-term projects. Like LLCs (Limited Liability Companies), they function as a unit through which a group of people (or entities) can collaborate and create all kinds of value. Rather than bind us to geography or a central entity, they allow us to coordinate around jointly developed value in a  borderless, permissionless and transparent way.\n\nDAOs also present a new way for people with varying commitment levels to own and run an organisation. Most DAOs have a core team that oversees the day-to-day activities and other members who contribute to varying degrees and receive commensurate rewards. Regardless of their commitment level, members are incentivised to go above and beyond because they benefit directly when the DAO’s goals are achieved.\n\n### Getting Involved\n\n* Any group of people can create a DAO to achieve a common goal. [Colony](https://colony.io/) and [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) are two popular tools for creating DAOs. You can find a comprehensive list of tools for building your DAO [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16IDgIyPcfwJGG-zmXeMAenYbePQVHkc2P6WCwKEZgpk/edit#gid=970924127)\n* You could also join or contribute to an existing DAO.

{"id": "9l4ojsAVWsryfNLdd3fetqr7PJjPu8AZ7Wt6NlsUKAk", "title": "Why DAO?", "body": "## Making sense of the fuss about DAOs.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gbuw_e9XZMlqZSQAHJRtv.gif?height=270&width=480)\n\nCommunities are inherently valuable. They bring together members’ resources, skills, knowledge, and experiences to create value for members and other people who engage with them. From crowd-sourcing advice to supporting non-profit causes and even reality show favourites, communities have historically been used to accomplish and advance all kinds of goals. For instance, in many African societies, community-based initiatives like cooperative societies are an age-long vehicle for enabling millions of unbanked people to access credit and other financial services.\n\nAs we have spent more of our time on the internet over the last few years, we’ve created and established more of these communities online. We’re part of groups on WhatsApp, Facebook, Reddit, Quora and so on. These internet-based communities are able to leverage even more resources and run more efficiently because there are no geographical boundaries to membership. People from different backgrounds can bring diverse perspectives and skills to make their communities more valuable. The influence and value of these communities are also able to reach more people worldwide. Communities no longer have to be made up of just people who look like us; they can be formed around more diverse factors like ideologies, hobbies, and even arbitrary interests.\n\nDepending on the community goals, physical communities can often create and give financial value to their members. For instance, a local community of teachers could pool money together to start a business that allows the members to split profits. They can do this because it’s easier to develop the level of trust and coordination required to manage financial resources when community members are in close proximity to one another.\n\nThis isn’t the case for online communities where members tend to be strangers spread out across the globe. It’s near impossible to build trust and coordinate decisions. For instance, if you’re part of an online group of digital art enthusiasts and your group decides to go beyond discussing art to maintaining a collection, it could be almost impossible to manage. As such, the financial value created by internet-based communities today ends up being captured by the community “leader” or the host platform (e.g. Reddit).\n\n**To financially co-ordinate, members would need:**\n\n* A legal backing to enforce rules and regulations within the group. To do that, you would need to register the community as an entity. It becomes a logistical nightmare if it’s a large group of people from different countries, as is typical with internet-based communities. You’d have to handle conflict over what jurisdiction the entity should be in and any other complications that arise because the law isn’t always interoperable across borders.\n* A bank account to make and receive payments. Again, we have the same logistical and legal challenges from the point above. You’d need to be able to pool money together and manage the group’s finances transparently and conveniently. This requires the community to trust one person (or a few people) to act as custodian(s) of the fund. Even if members vote a certain way, they have to trust the custodians to do right by them. If pieces from a collection get sold, you also have to figure out disbursements to individual accounts.\n* A scalable way to make decisions in a manner that is democratic and fair. While a public poll could work for some kinds of decisions, coordinating high-stakes (i.e. financial) activities with strangers demands the most transparent tools for making and enforcing decisions. You need to ensure that no single community member can change anything without the group’s explicit consent.\n\nThese points boil down to the need to have a central theoretically-neutral entity that the group/community can “trust” — whether it’s a government, a bank or a voting tool. Having members across the globe makes the first two nearly impossible. It makes it difficult to create any kind of sustainable community-owned organisation with a financial component.\n\nA Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an internet-native type of organisation that solves these problems using [blockchain technology](https://digitalartifacts.substack.com/p/blockchains). It eliminates the need to trust any human or central entity by maintaining these three parts of the organisation on a publicly accessible and unchangeable ledger called a blockchain.\n\nThe rules of a DAO are written as code (in smart contracts) and deployed to the blockchain. Once deployed, they will consistently execute as written and cannot be changed except through a previously agreed-upon mechanism. DAOs don’t receive their legitimacy from a government (agency); instead, they do so through their community’s coordination and incentive structures and the rules enforced on the blockchain.\n\n**Going back to the previous example, here’s how organising your online group of art enthusiasts as a DAO would work:**\n\n* It would be “registered” on the blockchain as a smart contract or set of smart contracts. Before the DAO is established, members agree on the rules and regulations, and those rules are converted into code and become the organisation’s binding constitution. The code is visible to all. Once deployed to the blockchain, they can only change the smart contract by a method already programmed into it. Because anyone with a wallet address can participate, there’s no geographical limitation. Everybody is a citizen of the internet, and the rules are enforced equally.\n* Voting in DAOs is done on the blockchain (referred to as on-chain governance), so everybody can see the results. The winning decisions are executed automatically as part of the smart contract. Community members could all be in the same place or distributed — it doesn’t matter. The community can reach conclusions in a manner that is democratic, inclusive and transparent.\n* The DAO’s fund (called a treasury) will also be held transparently on the blockchain. The smart contract will contain and enforce the rules around how funds will be disbursed. For instance, you could decide that at least 60% of the DAO members must sign a transaction before sending money out of the treasury. You could also program it to send 60% of art sales revenue into the DAO treasury and disburse the rest to members according to their contribution. This will all happen automatically and transparently, and you won’t need any member to oversee it after the contract has been deployed.\n\nYou can think of DAOs as a cross between a company and a cooperative society. While it’s a separate entity that can conduct business, employ other people, make investments etc., it is owned by all the members, and they get to participate in decision making.\n\nMost DAOs have a token that is used for governance. Each member of the DAO is a shareholder (or token holder) and can vote to the degree of their token ownership. They can propose changes within the organisation and rally other members to vote for their ideas. In some cases, e.g. with Uniswap’s UNI token, the DAO’s governance token also has market value and can be traded. This leads to additional value accrual to DAO members if the token price rises in the market. However, a noteworthy argument against having governance tokens with market value is that it could lead to misalignment of incentives such that it attracts people who only care about flipping the token for a profit but don’t care about the DAO’s mission.\n\n### DAO Applications\n\n* Product-Building DAOs: You can set up a DAO to build and launch products for public use. For instance, PartyDAO was created to build PartyBid, a tool that allows people to bid on digital assets collectively. The DAO started with an [initial crowdfund](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) on the Ethereum blockchain that was open to people from everywhere in the world. Backers would fund with Ether and receive $PARTY tokens. Holders of the $PARTY token own the product and any other product that the DAO launches. They collectively make decisions about the product(s), and as the product grows, they’ll receive any financial upside.\n* User-owned Products: Organizations can use the DAO structure to empower users of a product to become owners. Users can receive ownership tokens that give them decision-making abilities and entitle them to profits. Redistributing profit to users in this way tends to make the users even stronger product evangelists. An example of this is the decentralised publishing platform and DAO, Mirror. Users can become owners of the platform by earning and burning their $WRITE token. As more users contribute to the platform’s growth by publishing high-quality content, they will eventually also earn financial rewards.

Through the DAO, they can crowdfund as a collective, hire writers (who might not be DAO members), commission work for revenue, publish their work and split profits. The members can be anywhere on the planet and could even be pseudonymous. They don’t need to know each other, and they would still be able to coordinate effectively.\n* Venture DAOs: A group of people could create a DAO as a vehicle to invest in ventures and projects as a collective. They would pool together their funds in the DAO treasury and vote together on deals. The DAO can also own non-fungible digital assets, and its members will essentially hold ownership stakes of the asset. [Komorebi Collective](https://syndicate.io/syndicate/komorebi_collective) is a Venture DAO focused on funding female and non-binary crypto founders.\n\n### Considerations to organising as a DAO\n\nWhile DAOs are effective for coordinating financial incentives and decisions in community-based groups, they are not suited for all kinds of organisations.\n\nThere are cases in which having several decision-makers could slow down or reduce the quality of decision making.

As a result, most land, and its accompanying natural resources, are often utilized by a singular party, to the detriment of everyone else. We see this in resource management, NIMBY debates, empty condos, etc.\n\nWhile the modern view is a giant leap above the even more exclusionary practices of the past, where only nobles could own land, it is still a system that needs evolution.\n\nLand especially is a natural resource inherent to the Earth and her children.\n\nOur current diction of “landlords” and “tenants” are subtle social programming reminding us of feudalistic systems that we need to ascend from.\n\n### Pathology\n\nThe unhealthiness of the system is an attribute of the growing wealth divide happening, at the very least, in the United States between those who own and those who do not. Such social problems affect us all. Human society is an integrated and interdependent system - where the rich in countries with large wealth divides tend to not live as long as the rich in countries with a more equitable distribution of wealth.\n\nIt is our duty as builders in Web3 to create new positive sum systems around ownership. We’ve seen it bleed through to ownership over software platforms, but for us to manifest the full impact of this new paradigm, we need to touch Layer 0 - the physical world. We can create better economic games for both landowners and tenants that create integrated success for all.\n\n# How\n\n### Tools\n\nEthereum enables the digitization of assets.\n\nOnce digitized, such assets can be integrated into positive-sum economic games that are able to generate far more value for all parties than what is possible in the world prior. For example, liquidity mining is being used to bootstrap financial protocols to become competitive with traditional finance spearheaded by Compound and Yearn. In it, the protocol developers, the users, and liquidity providers all benefit from virtuous economic loops.\n\nLand and housing currently have ever-advancing digital interfaces pioneered by Web2 companies like Zillow and AirBnb, but these assets have stayed rooted in archaic ledgers. Similar to neobanks and the financial ecosystem - real estate technology uses advanced interfaces built on the same self-serving infrastructure of the past.\n\nWe can upgrade the fundamental infrastructure upon which housing is governed.\n\n### MVP\n\nWhat is clear is that for any new economic system that thinks about housing differently - prioritizing accessibility and distributed ownership, we must evolve past the existing infrastructure.\n\nTo begin with, we can play with the smallest unit of ownership - the lease. We can deconstruct the 12-month lease into individual NFTs representing ownership over each of the 12 months.1 NFT representing ownership for January, another for February, and so on.\n\n### Future\n\nIn the future, once housing deeds exist as digital assets on the blockchain, we can fractionalize or tokenize the ownership such that those using or living on the property accrue ownership.\n\nFor example, today someone who rents an apartment for 5+ years ends up accruing 0 ownership in the actual apartment itself. While we have accepted that as an inherent part of the owner <-> user dynamic, what Web3 has taught us is that there is real impact in giving ownership into the hands of people that actively use the platform. Maybe renters should incur some ownership in the apartment they live in and maintain. With some fractionalization or tokenization, streaming ownership to a tenant is totally possible!\n\nLandlords can compete with each other to give away ownership to attract people to live in their space. Effectively making people ape into ownership! Naturally, there is a lot that is being ignored in this high-level theorization - like the advantage to current owners for diluting their ownership. I don’t have very many answers here, but we can imagine some low-hanging financial benefits in decreasing mortgage requirements, transferring debt load, and less operational overhead costs.\n\nIt feels unlikely this will make immediate sense in high-demand areas like NYC or San Francisco, but it may make a world of difference in developing areas like Wyoming. One can imagine a property developer wanting to develop Jacksonhole can utilize ownership incentives to entice remote workers to move in. Live in this complex or buy a house in this neighborhood and be streamed ownership!\n\nNaturally, individuals moving there increase the value of the property, increasing the wealth in the local economy, and creating a virtuous economic cycle. Integrated success through distributed ownership!\n\n# What\n\n### Experiment\n\nEnough theory. What is happening today is that I am turning the months of December, January, and February of my apartment into individual NFTs that people can buy and redeem to stay at my place. My apartment is located in the East Village - super close to Equinox, Whole Foods, Target, Thompkins Square Park, and basically all the cool bars.\n\nIn its current form, it really isn’t much different from a sublease. Maybe I can attach a 10% resale percentage that potentially gives me a monetization on secondary markets for my lease. Eventually, an auction mechanism for my remaining months to improve price discovery.\n\nHowever, the hope is that when digitized, we can discover really cool things to do with it, and we can begin exploring this space.\n\nI encourage everyone reading this who feels trapped in their 12-month lease to [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/7z4TWPhCm6), tokenize their lease, and see what cool shit can happen! We can create a governance token that is distributed to people who tokenize their lease to increase this new apartment market liquidity, and as remuneration for community members that took the risk and got harassed by their landlords.\n\n### Redemption\n\nTo actually redeem the NFT to stay in my place, you’ll need to DM me on Telegram/Twitter/Discord and I’ll still need you to sign a whole sublease thing, unfortunately. Maybe stake like $500 as a security deposit.\n\nI know this is super mega lame, but hey man baby steps. Redeeming may require transferring the NFT to some burn address. Open to feedback on the best mechanism to do this.\n\nOr you can just keep the NFT for vibes as the first example of a housing contract existing on-chain and not redeem!\n\n## What will I do\n\nI’m excited to see what happens when we can actually have NFTs represent legal ownership over things that exist in the real world.\n\nI have no idea what I’ll be doing in the months when people redeem my apartment, I’ll likely just fuck-off somewhere random for that month. If you have an extra room or wanna hang out, DM me!\n\nThis feels like a fun, cool futuristic step. Let’s think as big as we can with NFTs, DeFi, and Web3!\n\n# Props\n\nMega props to James Duncan for being the only one to tell me that this isn’t a fucking stupid idea and for motivating me to create!\n\nShout out to Mr. Clean for providing the initial idea spark and for providing new areas of exploration.\n\n# Relevant Links\n\n[Pictures and Video of my apartment](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F6SGu6orBwXA2GtUIADuXWOl9k7HfYjp?usp=sharing) \\[my room is the master\\].\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/7z4TWPhCm6) for us to coordinate around uploading more housing into Web3.\n\n[Collection on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/holon-housing) to purchase the NFT.\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/HolonHousing) for updates.", "timestamp": 1635452059, "digest": "13EYhkOirEJNxpJB6PssN-2tLs6R1VRinhWc2mwLlbg", "contributor": "0x421f223e19877D9765Ecd6e8EC4812457229B36A"}

Crypto onboarding as we know it is a tedious process plagued by token shillers and speculators whose only mission is to pump their own bags. And aside from centralized products like Coinbase Earn, there's no education network dedicated to teaching users the ins and outs of on-chain interactions.\n\nOnboarding today is inaccessible, hard to understand, and owned entirely by influencers who earn outsized benefits from new members joining the ecosystem.\n\nFrom an accessibility standpoint, think about the first time you heard about crypto — buzzwords galore: \"How do I get started?\" someone might ask. \"Well,\" you'd say, \"first you need a non-custodial wallet that holds various ERC-20 tokens. You're gonna want to go to your favorite centralized exchange, buy some tokens, send them to your wallet, swap some on a decentralized exchange to get some others, and, if you really wanna get frisky, lock em up in some high yield DeFi protocol to maximize your yield. You'll be farming in no time!\"\n\nIf you don’t know a thing about crypto, you're probably staring at your screen like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dbiFQ65oIQtuNeuF2HdKY.png?height=534&width=624)\n\nThough the jargon and memes of crypto twitter bring insiders together, they do virtually nothing to help new people enter the space — the same things that provide inclusivity within crypto networks maintain exclusivity outside of them.\n\n[https://twitter.com/zach__davidson/status/1450784782535860228](https://twitter.com/zach__davidson/status/1450784782535860228)\n\nOn a similar thread, this rift between crypto-native and non-crypto-native people continues to widen since we've yet to convince the public that crypto is more than just a \"currency.\" In fact, most crypto isn't even a currency anyway — it's gas for a protocol, a utility for a specific ecosystem with no intent of ever being money.\n\nNot to mention that our discourse around crypto is dominated by influencers whose opinions become laws. Thought leaders consistently tweet the same things: fortune cookie tweets or project shills to ensure they're never the last ones left holding the bag.\n\nAll these factors collide to create noise in the space that intimidates new users. We need an objective signal in the noise to educate the world about what's only possible with crypto.\n\n## Decentralized Identities & Crypto Credentials\n\nAs we move to a crypto-native world, we get to rethink the internet as it stands today. In creating web3, we work towards a vision of the internet as originally intended — an open web owned + operated by its users. With this vision comes the ability to have more portable online identities and community affiliations — something made possible with decentralized identities (DIDs).\n\nDIDs let us link our various wallet addresses together, creating a more cohesive view of our online presence. Services like [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) and [ENS](https://ens.domains/) let us prove we’re human + add digital identities on top of our wallets, letting us “put our mouth where our money is,” but it’s DIDs that bring the disparate parts of our online identities into one. \n\nUsing DIDs we can fulfill RabbitHole’s core vision of creating an “on-chain meritocracy” with crypto credentials — a means of proving one’s expertise or reputation based on their on-chain activity — but the main bottleneck to this vision is the centralization of our company.\n\nRabbitHole must become a DAO to reach the necessary scale to achieve this on-chain meritocracy while remaining credibly neutral and aligning incentives between its users, investors, and the broader web3 community.\n\n## Why RabbitHoleDAO\n\n[https://twitter.com/zach__davidson/status/1450449153373491204](https://twitter.com/zach__davidson/status/1450449153373491204)\n\nRabbitHole is already the market leader in token distribution + customer acquisition for crypto protocols. We've given out hundreds of thousands of dollars in token rewards to users all around the world while pioneering a \"learn-to-earn\" model which incentivizes intentional participation with crypto projects over pure speculation + \"number go up\" day trading behavior. Picking up where Earn.com left off, RabbitHole focuses on a user's on-chain track record to award tokens + credentials based on their transaction history, helping find an answer to how we find the right person for the right job at the right time. At scale, RabbitHole will become the go-to source for work on the internet.\n\nWe believe the future of work is based on one’s contribution to various organizations to which they feel most aligned. DAOs open up a new paradigm for democratic governance and mass coordination of people with similar interests and values, and as such, it’s core to our vision to be a DAO, ourselves, to help usher in this new era.\n\n***Scaling mass onboarding while preserving decentralization***\n\n[https://twitter.com/zach__davidson/status/1444085463942324227?s=20](https://twitter.com/zach__davidson/status/1444085463942324227?s=20)\n\nFor DAOs to achieve relevant scale, traditional marketing isn't sufficient. So in our transition from company to DAO, we must build a tight-knit community of DAO contributors who can operate the network in tandem with (and eventually in place of) the core RabbitHole team. \n\nBecoming a DAO not only lets us grow larger than a centralized company, but it also helps us coordinate + mobilize a task force of learners and earners who will act as sherpas for potential new crypto users. These contributors are called *Pathfinders* — crypto missionaries looking to preach the gospel and use their talents in design, marketing, engineering, and more to onboard the next billion people to web3.\n\nThink of it this way: *If RabbitHole is a game, Pathfinders are the game designers.*\n\nPathfinders are made up of several core working groups:\n\n* **Pioneers** — content creators building web3’s Library of Alexandria, a knowledge hub complete with anything you’d need to know to get started in crypto\n* **Artisans** — a diverse collective of designers + artists crafting NFT rewards for RabbitHole Quests + outsourcing design services to other DAOs in the web3 ecosystem \n* **Stewards** — scouts + alpha hunters sourcing + partnering with crypto protocols, representing RabbitHoleDAO through metagovernance + DAO expansion efforts\n* **Navigators** — web3 developers engineering Quest templates with built-in crypto-economic incentives to upskill developers + help them participate in DAOs\n* **Explorers** — data analysts finding signal in the noise, exploring various blockchains to compile case studies that show off the value of RabbitHole’s Quests + Protocol\n\nWe’ve already “stealth launched” Pioneers + Artisans, and we’ll be opening up the remaining roles soon. If any of these resonate with you, please reach out!\n\nOn their own, each working group provides avenues for new crypto users to get started working in DAOs while offering more experienced contributors new work & mentorship opportunities. Together, these working groups create a vast network of web3 resources, both for individual contributors and the crypto ecosystem at large.\n\nAs a result, RabbitHoleDAO can reach a larger scale than most other DAOs in the space while providing an on-ramp for members to showcase their skills and share upside in the community’s growth. But for that to be worthwhile, our DAO + protocol must be credibly neutral, allowing members to dictate the direction + depth to which it grows.\n\n***Aligning + empowering core contributors***\n\nTo remain credibly neutral, an org needs to align + empower its core contributors. For RabbitHoleDAO, alignment + empowerment becomes a flywheel:\n\n![The RabbitHoleDAO Flywheel](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J7PFdjNWvOLRJmQF_DTlA.jpg?height=932&width=1440)\n\n* Stewards source protocols we work with, earning a % of the value they bring to the DAO. \n* In tandem, Pioneers create tutorials + editorial content to guide RabbitHole users through various Quests while Artisans craft artwork for NFT rewards, earning tokens in exchange. \n* As a Quest is created, Navigators develop the subgraphs necessary to verify proof-of-completion + otherwise maintain the RabbitHole Protocol.\n* Finally, Explorers query those subgraphs, creating case studies to share with potential partners Stewards help source.\n* *And the cycle continues...*\n\nThese groups work in tandem to service the core RabbitHole protocol, earning more ownership + governance power in the DAO while building a credentialing protocol that fits their needs. \n\nAt its core, this ethos of how work gets done in the DAO aligns perfectly with our vision for an on-chain meritocracy + the future of web3 work. And once we’re sufficiently decentralized, we can use our protocol to issue objective, verifiable, interoperable credentials for the broader web3 ecosystem — credentials created *by the community, for the community.*\n\n***Creating a credibly-neutral credentialing protocol***\n\n[https://twitter.com/zach__davidson/status/1452697226728202240?s=20](https://twitter.com/zach__davidson/status/1452697226728202240?s=20)\n\nCredentials from centralized institutions are subjective — they're only valuable because the institution issuing them is valuable. It's a reputational ponzi scheme.\n\nOn the contrary, credentials from decentralized networks are more objective — they let people observe work completed without a subjective value judgement on the work itself.\n\nTo create a true meritocracy, we need less of the former and more of the latter. And to get there, we need to have open discussions + build relationships with members of our community to open the door for their participation (and eventually our own company's decentralization).\n\nDecentralization is the only way to have open + transparent networks with objective credentials. In turn, these networks align incentives between all their participants, making it easier for new people to enter the space.\n\nConsider this: most of your crypto friends already want to bring their friends into the space (because everyone wants to be seen as a missionary), but there's never been an easy way to do so, nor has there been an easy way to track their progress as they learn. Not to mention that people want to be a part of something, and while traditional communities are great beginnings, real ownership comes with both financial and social rewards.\n\n[https://twitter.com/zach__davidson/status/1450861044042289160?s=20](https://twitter.com/zach__davidson/status/1450861044042289160?s=20)\n\nRabbitHole has an ethos core to web3: positive-sumness, transparency, and alignment across networks through true ownership of contributors’ work and community affiliations. When everyone owns a piece of the network + the success of that network is dictated by their actions, missionaries opt in and mercenaries opt out.\n\nDecentralization is just one piece of the web3 onboarding + credentialing puzzle. It lets us be more transparent in our processes, align incentives with our users, and creates objective measures of work completion which, in turn, push us towards the meritocracy we've always hoped for.\n\n\n---\n\n*If this mission resonates with you, please don’t hesitate to [reach out on twitter](https://twitter.com/zach__davidson), or [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/5AUaKhq3k7) to keep up to date with all developments related to our DAO.

Beem offers creators the most advanced video and NFT tools in one place to create new content and experiences, engage and grow their community, monetize their craft, and bring their fans into the Open Metaverse, while maintaining control over their intellectual property.\n\n### Beem is a tokenized virtual venue and toolkit for interactive live events, video distribution, community engagement and content monetization.\n\n![live events on Beem](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yyYL0QsAjACPwofKUhDZ7.png?height=1687&width=2817)\n\nOn Beem, creators can **upload their content**, **distribute it** easily for free or for a fee, and **create interactive live events** in a few clicks with full ticketing management. They can invite guests and fans on stage and interact seamlessly with their communities via live video and chat. Participants can join from any device (desktop browser, iOS and Android apps) and easily cast the show to their TV through Airplay or Chromecast. Creators can also stream their event to other platforms such as YouTube Live, Twitch or Facebook Live to reach the largest audience possible and bring those followers into their own space on Beem **for more interaction and greater monetization**. The content created during these live events is recorded and then available to be replayed. Creators can get paid in cash or in crypto, as we natively accept both forms of payment. Soon, each piece of content, event ticket and content access key created on Beem will be an **[NFT](https://digiday.com/media/wtf-is-an-nft/)** (Non-Fungible Token, a unique digital asset representing a certificate of ownership or access to an assigned item), unlocking real content ownership and direct fandom relationships.\n\nWe started working on Beem in early 2018 (stealth name: Unchained, check out our [whitepaper](https://assets.website-files.com/5ffe37090082ae5274693991/6170a559e360594446e4a950_Unchained%20WP%20-%20V%201.2.pdf)) on the principle that **NFTs will power [Web3](https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b)**, the next evolution of the digital economy, thanks to tokenized content ownership, decentralized intellectual property rights management, programmatic royalties and digital collectibles.\n\n![let's quickly skip to the ownership economy please](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooadBOm38DTtH6cDpy5op.png?height=1155&width=2056)\n\nWe knew that the video space was the most promising to apply these concepts, and we set our aim at creating a complete **blockchain-based video platform** for creators and their communities. But we soon realized that the Web3 technologies were not mature and scalable enough for mass-market deployment and adoption. We decided to start by building the most challenging part of the platform, a state-of-the-art high-performance, low latency video stack with live content and ticketing management systems. We created it, launched it, and market-proved it.**Creators and audiences alike loved it!**\n\nIn the last 12 months, creators have been using [Beem](https://watchbeem.com/) to **host live concerts**, **podcast recordings**, **interactive workshops**, **film premieres** and festivals with **live Q&As**, and **engaging fundraisers**. Beem has provided a unique stage for thousands of public and private events, with tens of thousands of user registrations, and dozens of thousands USD raised for nonprofits and cultural projects. We gained invaluable feedback from both our creators and their communities. We discovered that after experiencing a **unified toolkit** like Beem, creators don’t plan to go back to the messy patchwork of Zoom, YouTube Live, Vimeo, Streamyard, Eventbrite, Mailchimp, Patreon, and the dozen other tools they currently use to grow their business, connect with their communities and distribute and monetize their content.\n\nDon’t take our word for it, [check out the feedback we got](https://vimeo.com/639859358):\n\n![https://vimeo.com/639859358](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XYQFJFBjuPmrcdF0za7eP.png?height=535&width=958)\n\nEstablished creators and businesses can also choose to use our white-label solution and fully customize their space with their **own URL, identity, branding, content, and events**. They have direct access to their audience with tools to engage and interact with, as well as analytics to know everything about their live events performance, content distribution, and expected income while **maintaining ownership over their content**.\n\n## Entering the ownership economy\n\nWho actually owns the content on the internet? Where is it stored? How can we verify its IP (Intellectual Property) ownership? Many creators are getting their accounts [deleted without explanation](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1447629947284099077), or their content gets suddenly demonetized. This means the abrupt end of their revenue stream, of their community, and potentially of the entire personal brand and the business they worked hard to build over years. Protecting and controlling their content storage, their online presence (audience and community) and their IP (assets, brand, identity) have now become paramount to them.\n\nWe strongly believe that NFTs will be progressively adopted as the **leading standard** to solve most of the shortfalls of **digital media**, **content ownership**, and **monetization**:\n\n* Content distribution from centralized gatekeeping platforms is being replaced by **direct-to-fan distribution** with creators being their own platform, only using tech infrastructures such as Beem as underlying distribution protocols\n* As automatically-enforced **social contracts**, NFTs and social tokens allow communities to gather around common passions, interests and goals, and profit from it socially and potentially financially, without being tied to a specific platform. The traditional 20th-century marketing approach is replaced by **community building** where fans become genuine stakeholders of a creator’s work by contributing time and money at every step of the creative process. They do so in exchange for a stake, ownership, royalties, revenues, and **social signalling** along with **privileges** inside the community such as exclusive events, premium content **unlocking**, loyalty and **fanship** systems, and participation in the creator’s decisions ([VeeFriends](https://nftevening.com/veefriends-how-gary-vee-made-utility-the-new-thing-with-his-top-nft-collection/) is an example of this)\n* As digital assets that can be minted (created) by anyone with proven and guaranteed **scarcity** and verifiable source of **provenance**, **ownership** and **historicity**, NFTs allow the market to put a value on a digital item and can command a premium for rarity and scarcity with high demand\n\nAt Beem, we are now deploying NFT [smart contracts](https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts) at the core of our system to create a **seamless interface** between the performance and usability of Web2 and the [ownership economy](https://variant.fund/writing/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software) enabled by Web3. We started on the Ethereum blockchain, but we believe in a **multi-chain future** and are already integrating other chains and [Layer 2s](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrency-layer-2-scaling-solutions). By allowing creators to mint NFTs with the metadata stored on decentralized storage like IPFS and Arweave, Beem will offer a streamlined and **transparent IP ownership solution for video creators** who want to securely store and distribute their content. The content (media + metadata) is interoperable and doesn't depend on a centralized infrastructure, so the creator is in full control of it.\n\n![high level view of the decentralized infrastructure](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M2VNw3aDodvt6DL8jrZEi.png?height=1022&width=1409)\n\nAs for the monetization, Beem already offers multiple solutions to creators (both in crypto and [fiat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp)): **ticketing**, **pay-per-view**, **tips** and **fundraising**, brands **sponsorships**, and soon **token-gating** (NFTs and social tokens) with fan **subscriptions**, digital **collectibles**, and physical **merch** stores. As we progressively deploy our smart contracts, we will add new ways for creators to automatically **split revenues** and royalties between different participants, enabling the creation of **media Distributed Autonomous Organizations** ([DAOs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2021/06/01/what-are-daos-and-why-you-should-pay-attention/)).\n\n## The video stack of the Open Metaverse\n\nIn 2021 NFTs went mainstream as more and more people and [large corporations](https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/spongebob-nft-viacomcbs-recur-1235088069/#!) understand their use and foresee their potential. Indeed, NFTs can carry multiple characteristics and underlying values: **characters** more or less **exclusive** and valued ([Bored Apes](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bored-ape-yacht-club-the-celebrity-nft-of-choice), [Cool Cats](https://www.coolcatsnft.com/), etc.), **virtual real estate** (in [SandBox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/) maybe next to [SnoopDogg’s mansion](https://medium.com/sandbox-game/the-sandbox-partners-with-snoop-dogg-to-bring-legendary-rapper-into-the-metaverse-e064e866ed40) - owned by himself), a piece of **generative art** ([Art Blocks](https://www.artblocks.io/) collections) or a **music album** (from [3LAU](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/3lau-streaming-rights-royalties-nft-crypto-marketplace-1230638/) for example). They become (part of) your **online identity** and signal your passion and emotional attachment while allowing you to access communities with special privileges - your VIP entry to a global club.\n\n![do you have your Snoop Dogg private party pass?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YiCMGSDpRUf0iddDHJZ4g.png?height=433&width=691)\n\nWhen combined with **enhanced visualization** (virtual worlds, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality), **gamification** (open games, play-to-earn), content & personal **brand creation** (creators economy), and **decentralization** (democratized and permissionless playfield) with **digital asset ownership** it all converges into the so-called **Open Metaverse**, the shared virtual space where digital assets and identities are interconnected and fluid.\n**Blockchains are the fabric of those universes and NFTs are the building blocks.**\n\nAt Beem, we believe that NFTs will be a crucial part of the toolbox of every video creator, curator and influencer as most communities are evolving to much richer experiences happening in live interactive virtual events. Soon on Beem, creators and their communities will be able to create token-gated events and content: only people with a specific token in their wallet will be able to access them, creating a stronger sense of community for all the holders. Anyone will be able to showcase their NFTs on stage, use them as their avatar or 3D model on camera, in the chat and in their profile, maintaining their Metaverse identities inside their virtual communities. Beem’s long-term engagement is to continuously enrich the platform to allow deeper cultural and technical integrations for more pervasive Metaverse experiences.\n\n## Take ownership of Beem\n\nBeem sits at the intersection of **3 markets in hypergrowth**: the **creators economy** ([$100B+](https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-earnings-benchmark-report/), +50% YoY), **live virtual events** ([$100B](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/virtual-events-market), expected to grow at a 24% CAGR for the next 6 years), and **NFTs** (probably [>25B$ in 2021](https://www.reuters.com/article/fintech-nft-q3-idCAKBN2GU298), growing x275 YoY). Beem generates revenues through a commission model that is a fair and transparent model for everyone: we charge up to 15% on ticket sales and video revenues, with a reduced commission for collectibles and merch, fundraising, and additional revenue streams. We also charge a monthly fee to creators and businesses who upgrade to a customized white-labeled environment (called BeemPro).\n\nOur globally distributed team comes from a partnership between [Grey Juice Lab](https://www.greyjuicelab.com/about), a worldwide market leader in **video distribution** and **content licensing**, and [3SS](https://www.3ss.tv/), the most advanced multi-device carrier-grade video platform provider, led by entrepreneurs with strong experience in consumer-facing video services and crypto products. To experiment with premium content, we reached licensing deals with Major Studios such as **Paramount** for their most iconic titles to be used during fan-produced live interactive experiences.\n\nWe are here for the long run, with a 10 year vision: becoming the **leading video content and talent marketplace of Web3**. We envision a suite of decentralized protocols managing how any piece of digital content can be bought, rented, prepaid, crowdfunded, leased, staked, [fractionalized](https://fractional.art/), marketed, distributed and monetized in multiple ways, in a direct interaction between creators, brands, and their fans and communities. To allow creators to coordinate the creation of content, Beem will also make it easy to find talent, contract them, collaborate with them live on video and give them immediate shared ownership over the content and its attached revenue streams through media DAOs. Communities will then get rewarded to participate in the [content curation process](https://hackernoon.com/what-are-token-curated-registries-and-decentralized-lists-d33fa42ba167) as well as the marketing of this content.\n\nNow the best part: **we want you to be part of our journey toward becoming the most vibrant Web3 video ecosystem**. Our objective is to raise $10M in the coming year to execute on our bold vision. On top of VCs, it is of paramount importance for us to give you, our early community, the ability to invest and get your fair share of Beem’s success. Likewise, we’ve reserved equity to reward Beem’s most committed creators. **It’s time for creators to become stakeholders in their means of production!** If we are to make Beem a huge success, we want this success to be shared.\n\nFor that reason, we’ve launched a [rolling SAFE](https://blog.fairmint.co/a-new-era-of-high-resolution-fundraising-the-rolling-safe-1fb67eee68ab), available today on [invest.watchbeem.com](https://invest.watchbeem.com/). It behaves like a traditional [SAFE](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/) (Simple Agreement for Future Equity - a model pioneered by Y Combinator), except that it’s continuous, i.e. there are no rounds happening every now and then, reserved for a select few. Indeed, we wanted our rolling SAFE to be as inclusive and fair as possible:\n\n* **Inclusive**: our rolling SAFE never closes, it is literally always open for investment. You can invest today, tomorrow, in a few months or next year\n* **Fair**: the earlier you invest, the more attractive valuation you’ll secure. To reward earlier investors, the valuation of our rolling SAFE increases as we raise more money\n\nIf you want to be part of the greatest journey to reinvent video creation, distribution and monetization for Web3, don’t delay: [join us today](https://invest.watchbeem.com/).\n\nInvestments can be made through bank transfers, as well as in crypto (BTC, ETH, USDC). All the documents can be accessed and signed online, so in 10 min you can become an investor in Beem. Additionally, you have full visibility in real-time of the value of the company, how much was raised to date, and from how many investors.\n\nParticipation in Beem comes with full transparency: we’re building in public, and anyone can take part in our daily discussions, get a first peek at our new features, help us bootstrap the content curation process, or request a free demo by joining us on our Discord 👉  [watchbeem.com/discord](https://watchbeem.com/discord)\n\nAlso, **we’re hiring** 👋", "timestamp": 1635461656, "digest": "rbIsxr_OEDyhOMEX8UsDYyL-m_IR6mRM8CgopLTOkpI", "contributor": "0x42a63047a1cD8449e3E70aDEB7363C4Ca01DB528"}

Created by passionate developers, these games are the symbol of giving and building a community-owned game that will be powered by the creators and players.\n\n> *Own the games and shape the future*\n\nOP Games is also giving away 500 “Classic Snake Games” to everyone. You just need to follow [these simple instructions](https://twitter.com/Outplay_Games/status/1399032806714462210). Win it away!\n\nLet’s get back to our weekly report. Our GMV increases from the prior week. We record $14769 in sales volume. On a side note, 445 transactions happened last week. Our artists also minted 298 new cards for collectors to collect. We still are committed to bringing more events to the platform. Don’t miss it and thank you for your hard work.\n\nIn this week’s “Catching Up with Paras”, we will talk about another 5 noteworthy collections. Unfortunately, we cannot list all the minted cards for this week, so we encourage you to discover others that are as good as this list. If you have input and suggestions, we welcome them with open arms and we want you to hit us up on [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/ParasHQ)or our [Discord ](https://discord.gg/MjC7aqz8)channel.\n\nWithout further ado, Let’s start!\n\n# Lighthouse\n\n> *Let the light from the Lighthouse; let it shine on me!*\n\nSaleh brings out the “[Lighthouse](https://paras.id/saleh.near/collection/Lighthouse)” as his debut on Paras commences. The “Lighthouse” is a limited edition NFTs collectibles that can be collectors here on Paras. There are [three types of lighthouses](https://paras.id/saleh.near/collection/Lighthouse) that you can collect. It doesn’t stop there as Saleh makes sure that the art you own can be verified through Verisart. Therefore, each card has its certificate of authenticity. Saleh also includes several quotations regarding a lighthouse that hopefully enrich the collection. Come and collect your lighthouse!\n\n \n \n\n# Homoludens\n\nAsepnurdinn introduces his next collection called “[Homoludens](https://paras.id/asepnurdinn.near/collection/homoludens)”. Taken its inspiration from cultural theorists from Dutch, the collection explores the concept of humans who played as players in a world that is a game. The concept is essential to cultural development. Asepnurdinn shares this concept through expressive doodle art. Collect the “[Homoludens](https://paras.id/asepnurdinn.near/collection/homoludens)” now! What’s your human activity?\n\n \n \n\n# Warrior Primates\n\nAfter his debut with “[The Boogie Men](https://paras.id/artofjim.near/collection/The%20Boogie%20Men)”, Artofjim steps up by releasing his next project called “[Warrior Primates](https://paras.id/artofjim.near/collection/Warrior%20Primates)”. Currently, the collection consists of two cards only, but we should expect more to come from the artist. The two cards are “[Kamikaze Macaque](https://paras.id/token/bafybeig7faqyv45gakzhoaoc6v2e7vitctk6q3w4x4tsruqosithr5tfnm)” and “[Kamikaze Katauta](https://paras.id/token/bafybeiejzi5tw5hlhcfitpua66arbt7vwkkzx2eo6p52m3gtggofesqvie)”. The theme of the collection revolves around world war II. In the description of the card, Artofjim includes the series and the rarity of the card. What will be the epic closing for the collection? I guess we will see it together. Get your “W[arrior Primates](https://paras.id/artofjim.near/collection/Warrior%20Primates)” now!\n\n \n \n\n# Alive Creeportraits\n\nWhat do you think your paintings do when you fell asleep? It smiles and turns alive creepily; well, at least the one from Anftimatter did. The “[Alive Creeportraits](https://paras.id/anftimatter.near/collection/Alive%20Creeportraits)” is the new collection from the artist. It depicts several people in the frame that alive when nobody notices. The animation of these cards is simple yet superb. It brings uneasiness when you look at them. Don’t stare too long though, we don’t know if they can reach out to you yet. Let us know by owning your creepy portraits now!\n\n \n \n\n# Hanafuda May\n\nIf May have a color, what would it be? I bet it is the color of Benhaley’s “Hanafuda May” collection. Benhaley continues the collection that started back in February. Each card is made of polymer clay and painted. Similar to its predecessors, there are four Hanafuda cards available for each month: [Tane](https://paras.id/token/bafybeicrsia6ledllvt46tcclmfhwft7apoe7nh4xypj3rvrq4isesdm6i), [Tanzaku](https://paras.id/token/bafybeicaw4hnfzyspipu2bfwho3aixs3ifrggvjnwx7fj74khg4h2rndx4), [Kasu 2](https://paras.id/token/bafybeiamrtt7ly6tyacabf56gwjf2ldzqngy3gjiaqgcricijrgdtu2uqu), [Kasu 1](https://paras.id/token/bafybeidbmaoqh2s7ll6gh4s6guoajb63pwxcrnnkqo6x65iby4t7of26xa). Collect this month’s Hanafuda!\n\nThat’s all for this week’s recap. How do you feel about these releases? I guess there will be a lot of cards to collect and collection that will put us on the edge of our seats.\n\nWe also would like to remind you that this month will be filled with events, so brace yourself for multiple amazing projects. If you manage to grab them, don’t forget to mention them to the artist. Remember, there are more collections to come. There will be more artists to look out for.

The UK's National Fruit Collection, which is the responsibility of the Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, includes a collection of over 2,000 cultivars of apple tree in Kent.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-46) The University of Reading, which is responsible for developing the UK national collection database, provides access to search the national collection. The University of Reading's work is part of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources of which there are 38 countries participating in the Malus/Pyrus work group.[\\[47\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-47)\n\nThe UK's national fruit collection database contains much information on the characteristics and origin of many apples, including alternative names for what is essentially the same \"genetic\" apple cultivar. Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated specifically for cooking ([cooking apples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_apple)) or producing [cider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cider). [Cider apples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cider_apple) are typically too tart and astringent to eat fresh, but they give the beverage a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.[\\[48\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-apples1-48)\n\nCommercially popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp. Other desirable qualities in modern commercial apple breeding are a colorful skin, absence of [russeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russet_apple), ease of shipping, lengthy storage ability, high yields, disease resistance, common apple shape, and developed flavor.[\\[45\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-England-45) Modern apples are generally sweeter than older cultivars, as popular tastes in apples have varied over time. Most North Americans and Europeans favor sweet, subacid apples, but tart apples have a strong minority following.[\\[49\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-World-49) Extremely sweet apples with barely any acid flavor are popular in Asia,[\\[49\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-World-49) especially the [Indian Subcontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Subcontinent).[\\[48\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-apples1-48)\n\nOld cultivars are often oddly shaped, russeted, and grow in a variety of textures and colors. Some find them to have better flavor than modern cultivars,[\\[50\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-Crops_&_Gardening_-_Apples_of_Antiquity-50) but they may have other problems that make them commercially unviable—low yield, disease susceptibility, poor tolerance for storage or transport, or just being the \"wrong\" size. A few old cultivars are still produced on a large scale, but many have been preserved by home gardeners and farmers that sell directly to local markets. Many unusual and locally important cultivars with their own unique taste and appearance exist; apple conservation campaigns have sprung up around the world to preserve such local cultivars from extinction. In the United Kingdom, old cultivars such as '[Cox's Orange Pippin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%27s_Orange_Pippin)' and '[Egremont Russet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egremont_Russet)' are still commercially important even though by modern standards they are low yielding and susceptible to disease.", "timestamp": 1635475456, "digest": "nrTnVnH1UmJKbbkQEXLSgpbuN6x0npA1177nKBm5r2A", "contributor": "0xE99b0DCC34660eD5e4DDF38686113fE6CE530331"}

The new law empowers environmental enforcement agencies with great punitive power and large fines for offenders, defines areas which require extra protection, and gives independent environmental groups more ability to operate in the country.\\[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*\\] In 2020, Chinese Communist Party general secretary [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping) announced that China aims to peak emissions before 2030 and go carbon-neutral by 2060 in accordance with the [Paris climate accord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_climate_accord).[\\[172\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-188)According to [Climate Action Tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Action_Tracker), if accomplished it would lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2 - 0.3 degrees - \"the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker\".[\\[173\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-189) In September 2021 [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping) announced that China will not build \"coal-fired power projects abroad\".

The new laws include strengthening ecological protection rules for hydropower projects along the river, banning chemical plants within 1 kilometer of the river, relocating polluting industries, severely restricting sand mining as well as a complete fishing ban on all the natural waterways of the river, including all its major tributaries and lakes.[\\[178\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-194)\n\nChina is also the world's leading investor in [renewable energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy) and [its commercialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_commercialization), with [$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$)52 billion invested in 2011 alone;[\\[179\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-By2010-195)[\\[180\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-Black2010-196)[\\[181\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-ChinaLeadingEnergy-197) it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local-scale renewable energy projects.[\\[182\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-bradsher-198)[\\[183\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-199)[\\[184\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-200) By 2015, over 24% of China's energy was derived from renewable sources, while most notably from [hydroelectric power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectric_power): a total installed capacity of 197 [GW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigawatt) makes China the [largest hydroelectric power producer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity#World_hydroelectric_capacity) in the world.[\\[185\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-201)[\\[186\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-IEA2015-202) China also has the largest power capacity of [installed solar photovoltaics system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_by_country) and [wind power system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country) in the world.", "timestamp": 1635478840, "digest": "4SaGd7X9ClumB-JsZwNLUeoZeqWMIXTxRulJGAEwnok", "contributor": "0x1fAed3bcD91Cb968b744747E8a973FCd8EDfd1DD"}
{"id": "2fnJlFan0oVcdqqqu_-0JKg3-R6LsWlIm4Kkp8Cb54A", "title": "Governance on Solana (DAO 🥲)", "body": "## Inventory\n\nSolana has a built in Governance program.  As such it’s not very usable, you need UI to interact with the contract conveniently. As such there is a Mango partnered instance of frontend, but anyone could build one (cf [Squads](https://squads.medium.com/))\n\n* a back-office web app to create and manage DAO called [Oyster]() on GH, the [UI looks like this]().\n* a use-facing web app to allow access for voting and seeing governance proposals, called [governance-ui]() on GH, the [UI looks like this](). It has been built w/ Mango Market people, that’s the Mango DAO we know.\n\nThe back office does not allow the creation of DAO by anyone right now, but I imagine they have a tiny vetting process as to who can interact and getting in touch with them should allow a “listing”.\n\n## The Governance Primitive on Solana\n\nBelow is the diagram of the governance program. I’ll go through the documentation and add some comments. This is a personal notes kind of document.\n\n![OCD level 120% at all the non-straight boxes and arrows](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GgoZbyTtxztDLkSE_hV2d.png?height=1451&width=1304)\n\n## Realm Account - The top level organisation\n\n> **Realm account** ties Community Token Mint and optional Council Token mint to create a realm for any governance pertaining to the community of the token holders. For example a trading protocol can issue a governance token and use it to create its governance realm.\n\nThis is a top level thing that is like an internal DAO for the team, it can use the governance token, or a separate TeamGovernance token. I think using the governance one is fine if you setup things manually pre IDO, else the TeamGovernance one can come handy. See the end of this doc for an example.\n\nIt represents the organisation, and from this you derive new `ProgramGovernance` instances, each of them managing ONE and only program.\n\n## Governance Accounts - The controllers\n\n### Program Governance Account - Program\n\n> The basic building block of governance to update programs is the ProgramGovernance account. It ties a governed Program ID and holds configuration options defining governance rules. The governed Program ID is used as the seed for a [Program Derived Address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses), and this program derived address is what is used as the address of the Governance account for your Program ID.\n>\n> What this means is that there can only ever be ONE Governance account for a given Program. The governance program validates at creation time of the Governance account that the current upgrade authority of the program taken under governance signed the transaction. Optionally `CreateProgramGovernance` instruction can also transfer `upgrade_authority` of the governed program to the Governance PDA at the creation time of the Governance account.\n\nYou deploy your program, and then transfer the authority to the governance account. (?)\n\nThis then provide an API for upgrades.\n\n*I wonder how the upgrade goes, what are the limitations like update size if it needs to fits CPI calls?*\n\n### Mint Governance account - Mint\n\n> A mint governance account allows a mint authority to setup governance over an SPL Mint account. The Governance program validates at creation time that the current mint authority signed the transaction to create the governance and optionally can transfer the authority to the Governance account. Once setup the Mint Governance allows governance participants to create Proposals which execute mint instructions for the governed Mint.\n\nSimilar logic as the Program Governance Account above, except the API is tailor to cater for Minting needs.\n\n### Token Governance account - SPL Token Account (wallet)\n\n> A token governance account allows a token account owner to setup governance over an SPL Token account. The Governance program validates at creation time the current owner signed the transaction to create the governance and optionally can transfer the owner to the Governance account. Once setup the Token Governance allows participants to create Proposals to execute transfer instructions from the governed token account.\n\nSimilar to the PGA and MGA above, except it’s a SPL wallet API this time.\n\n## Authority\n\n### Proposal accounts\n\n> A Proposal is an instance of a Governance created to vote on and execute given set of instructions. It is created by someone (Proposal Owner) and tied to a given Governance account and has a set of executable instructions to it, a name and a description. It goes through various states (draft, voting, executing, ...) and users can vote on it if they have relevant Community or Council tokens. Its rules are determined by the Governance account that it is tied to, and when it executes, it is only eligible to use the [Program Derived Address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses) authority given by the Governance account. So a Proposal for Sushi cannot for instance upgrade the Program for Uniswap.\n\nThis is the actual Proposal submitted to the public for voting. But before it goes live… ⤵️\n\n> When a Proposal is created by a user then the user becomes Proposal Owner and receives permission to edit the Proposal. With this power the Owner can edit the Proposal, add/remove Signatories to the Proposal and also cancel it. These Signatories can then show their approval of the Proposal by signing it off. Once all Signatories have signed off the Proposal the Proposal leaves Draft state and enters Voting state. Voting state lasts as long as the Governance has it configured to last, and during this time people holding Community (or Council) tokens may vote on the Proposal.

But it’s what a governance is, people who have stake decides. That’s the base rule.\n\nWhat’s valuable here is that least we got it fully transparent and immuable, thanks to the blockchain™️. We know who did what and when.\n\n## Real world examples\n\n### An IDO\n\nYou’r team want to do an IDO to kickstart a DAO/your governance token, you’ll need to :\n\n* deploy programs (at least the IDO one)\n* pre mint the Governance Token and store securely until next step\n* allocate x% to the IDO, send the remainder into several `GovernanceTokenAccount` (community, team growth, insurance w/e)\n* allocate some to vesting (time-locked transactions) for team or investors\n\nYou could do the above manually, the stake is still “low” pre IDO.\n\nOR you could use the feature previously mentionned of `TeamGovernance tokens` from the RealAccount.\n\nYou would do kind of an internal DAO for the team to setup things, with internal valueless tokens that are just there to kick start things, maybe later on for more internal decisions, but at that stage you could use the IDO’ed governance token.\n\nOne thing that could be handy, is to have these `Community Token Mint` (*TeamGovernance token?)* behave like time-locked vested Governance token. That way it has no actual market value, but still allow the team the vote as if they had their stake.\n\n### An existing organisation that want to transition to better practices\n\nYou’r team has a nice Defi/NFT project, things are settling down, and now you have time to consider following better practices (that should have been done in the beginning but yea anyway).\n\nCurrent context :\n\n* you control existing wallets for your treasury, usually one wallet for anything with manual management of transactions. Team members controlling the distributed/duplicated secret key (#security)\n* you have a community that would like to participate in the decision making\n\nWhat needs to be done :\n\n* instantiate a Governance program stack\n* do an IDO for voting, or use a token if you have one already (might also use NFT not sure)\n* delegate ownership of TokenWallets and Mint and ProgramDeployment to the GovernanceProgram accounts\n* start the usual DAO process, where things happen when it’s voted\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI think it seem very spooky for teams to loose the direct control they had, but that’s the proper way.\n\nIt remove the weight of being able to fuck up the whole thing, maliciously, by stupidity, or by being tricked. We know how elaborate these things can be and nobody is safe. The only security is Zero Trust, decentralisation.\n\nDon’t forget that it’s not YOURs anymore once people have “invested in” by minting/IDOing etc. It’s normal that the control is shared, also the decision making. \n \n\nNot everybody will agree on this, but I think it’s an artefact from the old unfair real world. \n  \n Cheers thanks for reading", "timestamp": 1635476686, "digest": "DO8UzlSPOfwVcQzEYeTcc1a5BAdAFa3Z2OGm7IY7Tes", "contributor": "0x9fEcc73Da3f8bd2aC436547a72f8Dd32326D90dc"}
{"id": "2LwTMfllmjwibpANxzqGLVH98GTAfdbq3ApQjEfCzsk", "title": "DAO on Solana ", "body": "## Inventory\n\n \n Solana has a built in Governance program.  As such it’s not very usable, you need UI to interact with the contract conveniently. As such there is a Mango partnered instance of frontend, but anyone could build one (cf [Squads](https://squads.medium.com/))\n\n* a back-office web app to create and manage DAO called [Oyster]() on GH, the [UI looks like this](). \n* a use-facing web app to allow access for voting and seeing governance proposals, called [governance-ui]() on GH, the [UI looks like this](). It has been built w/ Mango Market people, that’s the Mango DAO we know.\n\nThe back office does not allow the creation of DAO by anyone right now, but I imagine they have a tiny vetting process as to who can interact and getting in touch with them should allow a “listing”.\n\n## The Governance Primitive on Solana\n\nBelow is the diagram of the governance program. I’ll go through the documentation and add some comments. This is a personal notes kind of document.\n\n![OCD level 120% at all the non-straight boxes and arrows](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GgoZbyTtxztDLkSE_hV2d.png?height=1451&width=1304)\n\n## Realm Account - The top level organisation\n\n> **Realm account** ties Community Token Mint and optional Council Token mint to create a realm for any governance pertaining to the community of the token holders. For example a trading protocol can issue a governance token and use it to create its governance realm.\n\nThis is a top level thing that is like an internal DAO for the team, it can use the governance token, or a separate TeamGovernance token. I think using the governance one is fine, if there is a way to time lock it.\n\nIt represents the organisation, and from this you derive new `ProgramGovernance` instances, each of them managing ONE and only program.\n\n## Governance Accounts - The controllers\n\n### Program Governance Account - Program\n\n> The basic building block of governance to update programs is the ProgramGovernance account. It ties a governed Program ID and holds configuration options defining governance rules. The governed Program ID is used as the seed for a [Program Derived Address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses), and this program derived address is what is used as the address of the Governance account for your Program ID.\n>\n> What this means is that there can only ever be ONE Governance account for a given Program. The governance program validates at creation time of the Governance account that the current upgrade authority of the program taken under governance signed the transaction. Optionally `CreateProgramGovernance` instruction can also transfer `upgrade_authority` of the governed program to the Governance PDA at the creation time of the Governance account.\n\nYou deploy your program, and then transfer the authority to the governance account. (?)\n\nThis then provide an API for upgrades.\n\n*I wonder how the upgrade goes, what are the limitations like update size if it needs to fits CPI calls?*\n\n### Mint Governance account - Mint \n\n> A mint governance account allows a mint authority to setup governance over an SPL Mint account. The Governance program validates at creation time that the current mint authority signed the transaction to create the governance and optionally can transfer the authority to the Governance account. Once setup the Mint Governance allows governance participants to create Proposals which execute mint instructions for the governed Mint.\n\nSimilar logic as the Program Governance Account above, except the API is tailor to cater for Minting needs.\n\n### Token Governance account - SPL Token Account (wallet)\n\n> A token governance account allows a token account owner to setup governance over an SPL Token account. The Governance program validates at creation time the current owner signed the transaction to create the governance and optionally can transfer the owner to the Governance account. Once setup the Token Governance allows participants to create Proposals to execute transfer instructions from the governed token account.\n\nSimilar to the PGA and MGA above, except it’s a SPL wallet API this time.\n\n## Authority\n\n### Proposal accounts\n\n> A Proposal is an instance of a Governance created to vote on and execute given set of instructions. It is created by someone (Proposal Owner) and tied to a given Governance account and has a set of executable instructions to it, a name and a description. It goes through various states (draft, voting, executing, ...) and users can vote on it if they have relevant Community or Council tokens. Its rules are determined by the Governance account that it is tied to, and when it executes, it is only eligible to use the [Program Derived Address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses) authority given by the Governance account. So a Proposal for Sushi cannot for instance upgrade the Program for Uniswap.\n\nThis is the actual Proposal submitted to the public for voting. But before it goes live… ⤵️\n\n> When a Proposal is created by a user then the user becomes Proposal Owner and receives permission to edit the Proposal. With this power the Owner can edit the Proposal, add/remove Signatories to the Proposal and also cancel it. These Signatories can then show their approval of the Proposal by signing it off. Once all Signatories have signed off the Proposal the Proposal leaves Draft state and enters Voting state. Voting state lasts as long as the Governance has it configured to last, and during this time people holding Community (or Council) tokens may vote on the Proposal. Once the Proposal is \"tipped\" it either enters the Defeated or Succeeded state. If the vote can't be tipped automatically during the voting period but still reaches the required Yes vote threshold it can be manually transitioned to Succeeded state using FinalizeVote instruction. Once all Proposal instructions are executed the Proposal enters Completed state.\n\nThis explain the several stages of a proposal, it’s to prevent indirect rugs like team member X votes to transfer all the treasury to his wallet with lowest treshold and vote himself.\n\n> In the Executing state an instruction can be run by any one at any time after the `instruction_hold_up_time` period has transpired\n\nThis is for time-lock and vesting, nice.\n\n_____ \n  \n TL:DR; for the last bits is that a `ProposalAccount` can have several `ProposalInstructions`, the actual pieces of work (send X tokens to Billy - Update the program with his patch).

A follow-up email with an update on our thinking behind the race in light of the high turnout was sent to all applicants–if you were supposed to receive an email but didn’t, let us know in Discord (#space-race). We’re targeting November 15th for the start of the first race 🏁.\n\nDuring today’s meeting with the governance council, Council member John Crain (CEO of SuperRare Labs) proposed two changes to the mechanics of the Space Race from the way it was initially published, to better satisfy the spirit of this first Space Race: \n\n1. The large number and high quality of applications for Space Race #1 led us to believe that allowing more than one Space per race to be elected by the community would result in a more successful overall process - and would be less likely to cause frustration among what is sure to be an ever growing list of applicants who take the time to submit such comprehensive proposals. As a result, we proposed increasing the number of winners for the first space race from one to many.\n2. We also proposed that the Space Race voting interface switch from Snapshot to Mirror’s [Token Race](https://dev.mirror.xyz/dLLIq4Iebg5DLWJbOWa3sU6oQuwbogkmqPnz-ZbzPUg), a brand-new, open source voting interface that wasn’t yet live when we announced the Space Race. We love the Token Race because it provides a live leaderboard, a cleaner UI, and is designed to allow for multiple winners per race.\n\nA formal proposal of all mechanics of the Space Race will be discussed and developed by the council over the next week. If approved by the council, the Space Race governance framework will be put to a community vote to be ratified by $RARE holders, marking the moment when the DAO officially formalizes the mechanics of this first decentralized curation mechanism on SuperRare.\n\nThe council is also finalizing a draft DAO Charter - the document which formalizes the relationship between the council and token holders- which will serve as an operating constitution outlining the Council’s formal authorities in the near term. For example, the Charter will outline what types of proposals can be made by community members, and what decision making power the Council is granted by the community. This document will be shared at forum.superrare.com and submitted for a public vote when the final draft is ready to be considered and ratified by the DAO.\n\nAs governance operations ramp up, we as a community are going to be using the #governance Discord channel to share more information and discussion around both the Space Race and broader governance topics. \n\nStay tuned for further updates!\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1635474562, "digest": "CXrDKSCivTO_QzdgruW-CYJWDI90rRnONUhh8WK_nFQ", "contributor": "0x79150011a8DC56857459F652d165fB772EE6EB1C"}

As such it’s not very usable, you need UI to interact with the contract conveniently. As such there is a Mango partnered instance of frontend, but anyone could build one (cf [Squads](https://squads.medium.com/))\n\n* a back-office web app to create and manage DAO called [Oyster]() on GH, the [UI looks like this](). \n* a use-facing web app to allow access for voting and seeing governance proposals, called [governance-ui]() on GH, the [UI looks like this](). It has been built w/ Mango Market people, that’s the Mango DAO we know.\n\nThe back office does not allow the creation of DAO by anyone right now, but I imagine they have a tiny vetting process as to who can interact and getting in touch with them should allow a “listing”.\n\n## The Governance Primitive on Solana\n\nBelow is the diagram of the governance program. I’ll go through the documentation and add some comments. This is a personal notes kind of document.\n\n![OCD level 120% at all the non-straight boxes and arrows](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GgoZbyTtxztDLkSE_hV2d.png?height=1451&width=1304)\n\n## Realm Account - The top level organisation\n\n> **Realm account** ties Community Token Mint and optional Council Token mint to create a realm for any governance pertaining to the community of the token holders. For example a trading protocol can issue a governance token and use it to create its governance realm.\n\nThis is a top level thing that is like an internal DAO for the team, it can use the governance token, or a separate TeamGovernance token. I think using the governance one is fine, if there is a way to time lock it.\n\nIt represents the organisation, and from this you derive new `ProgramGovernance` instances, each of them managing ONE and only program.\n\n## Governance Accounts - The controllers\n\n### Program Governance Account - Program\n\n> The basic building block of governance to update programs is the ProgramGovernance account. It ties a governed Program ID and holds configuration options defining governance rules. The governed Program ID is used as the seed for a [Program Derived Address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses), and this program derived address is what is used as the address of the Governance account for your Program ID.\n>\n> What this means is that there can only ever be ONE Governance account for a given Program. The governance program validates at creation time of the Governance account that the current upgrade authority of the program taken under governance signed the transaction. Optionally `CreateProgramGovernance` instruction can also transfer `upgrade_authority` of the governed program to the Governance PDA at the creation time of the Governance account.\n\nYou deploy your program, and then transfer the authority to the governance account. (?)\n\nThis then provide an API for upgrades.\n\n*I wonder how the upgrade goes, what are the limitations like update size if it needs to fits CPI calls?*\n\n### Mint Governance account - Mint \n\n> A mint governance account allows a mint authority to setup governance over an SPL Mint account. The Governance program validates at creation time that the current mint authority signed the transaction to create the governance and optionally can transfer the authority to the Governance account. Once setup the Mint Governance allows governance participants to create Proposals which execute mint instructions for the governed Mint.\n\nSimilar logic as the Program Governance Account above, except the API is tailor to cater for Minting needs.\n\n### Token Governance account - SPL Token Account (wallet)\n\n> A token governance account allows a token account owner to setup governance over an SPL Token account. The Governance program validates at creation time the current owner signed the transaction to create the governance and optionally can transfer the owner to the Governance account. Once setup the Token Governance allows participants to create Proposals to execute transfer instructions from the governed token account.\n\nSimilar to the PGA and MGA above, except it’s a SPL wallet API this time.\n\n## Authority\n\n### Proposal accounts\n\n> A Proposal is an instance of a Governance created to vote on and execute given set of instructions. It is created by someone (Proposal Owner) and tied to a given Governance account and has a set of executable instructions to it, a name and a description. It goes through various states (draft, voting, executing, ...) and users can vote on it if they have relevant Community or Council tokens. Its rules are determined by the Governance account that it is tied to, and when it executes, it is only eligible to use the [Program Derived Address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses) authority given by the Governance account. So a Proposal for Sushi cannot for instance upgrade the Program for Uniswap.\n\nThis is the actual Proposal submitted to the public for voting. But before it goes live… ⤵️\n\n> When a Proposal is created by a user then the user becomes Proposal Owner and receives permission to edit the Proposal. With this power the Owner can edit the Proposal, add/remove Signatories to the Proposal and also cancel it. These Signatories can then show their approval of the Proposal by signing it off. Once all Signatories have signed off the Proposal the Proposal leaves Draft state and enters Voting state. Voting state lasts as long as the Governance has it configured to last, and during this time people holding Community (or Council) tokens may vote on the Proposal. Once the Proposal is \"tipped\" it either enters the Defeated or Succeeded state. If the vote can't be tipped automatically during the voting period but still reaches the required Yes vote threshold it can be manually transitioned to Succeeded state using FinalizeVote instruction. Once all Proposal instructions are executed the Proposal enters Completed state.\n\nThis explain the several stages of a proposal, it’s to prevent indirect rugs like team member X votes to transfer all the treasury to his wallet with lowest treshold and vote himself.\n\n> In the Executing state an instruction can be run by any one at any time after the `instruction_hold_up_time` period has transpired\n\nThis is for time-lock and vesting, nice.\n\n_____ \n  \n TL:DR; for the last bits is that a `ProposalAccount` can have several `ProposalInstructions`, the actual pieces of work (send X tokens to Billy - Update the program with his patch). If that interest you I think you’ll go in [the doc]() and check the voting dynamic that I haven’t mentioned here. All what I talked about is from there anyway. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/06rBmfJZt-Fh0Enc8H2W5.png?height=1490&width=1775)\n\n## Respect my authority, how does it all come together\n\nSo usually, a team would have control over the Program deployment, Minting of its IDO’d {gov/shit}coins, and control the wallet(s) (IDO profits, fees, community…).\n\nThis is a big responsibility, because upgrading the program on Solana means changing its behaviour silently. Any project with control of the Program Deployment can just send an TX to suck your NFT the next time you transact without doing a forensic analysis of the TX prompt if they want, and the confirmation UI/UX is not always super clear (quite good on Phantom now though)\n\nI won’t speak about Mint and Wallet unilateral control, which is straight forward about the involved risks.\n\n_____\n\nTo overcome that, the governance above is a great tool, the important bit being :\n\n> Governance can handle arbitrary executions of code.\n\nIn the example above, let’s say the team delegates Program Deployment, Mint and Wallets to the DAO. Then is mean that the only way they have to interact with these is to to submit proposals and get them approved.\n\nLet’s say they want to pay a bug bounty, then they craft the TX with the amount and in/outs, then send it to the `TokenGovernanceAccount` (not sure about the exact flow but you get the idea) and it will be there waiting to reach a treshold of vote or the timeout for the program to decide wether it should pass (be signed by it's Authority) or be rejected.\n\nGov token holder go on the aforementioned UI and vote with their stake. On given proposals.\n\n______\n\nIt’s an indirection layer that prevents bamboozles, with supplementary indirection-ception. \n\nIt can feel a bit useless, as usually the teams/investors/whales own a large chunk of the tokens, and could band up to do bad things? But it’s what a governance is, people who have stake decides. That’s the base rule.\n\nWhat’s valuable here is that least we got it fully transparent and immuable, thanks to the blockchain™️.

About 16.60% of the population were 14 years old or younger, 70.14% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 13.26% were over 60 years old.[\\[486\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-505) The population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0.46%.[\\[487\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-506) China used to make up much of the world's poor; now it makes up much of the world's middle class.[\\[488\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-507) Although a middle-income country by Western standards, China's rapid growth has [pulled hundreds of millions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_China)—800 million, to be more precise[\\[489\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-508)—of its people out of poverty since 1978. By 2013, less than 2% of the Chinese population lived below the international poverty line of US$1.9 per day, down from 88% in 1981.[\\[347\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-:1-365) China's own standards for poverty are higher and still the country is on its way to eradicate national poverty completely by 2019.[\\[490\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-509) From 2009 to 2018, the unemployment rate in China has averaged about 4%.[\\[491\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-510)\n\nGiven concerns about population growth, China implemented a two-child limit during the 1970s, and, in 1979, began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family. Beginning in the mid 1980s, however, given the unpopularity of the strict limits, China began to allow some major exemptions, particularly in rural areas, resulting in what was actually a \"1.5\"-child policy from the mid-1980s to 2015 (ethnic minorities were also exempt from one child limits). The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child.[\\[492\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-511) In 2016, the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a [two-child policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-child_policy).[\\[493\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-512) Data from the 2010 census implies that the [total fertility rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate) may be around 1.4, although due to under-reporting of births it may be closer to 1.5–1.6.[\\[494\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-513)\n\nAccording to one group of scholars, one-child limits had little effect on population growth[\\[495\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-Wang_Judge-514) or the size of the total population.[\\[496\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-Whyte-515) However, these scholars have been challenged. Their own counterfactual model of fertility decline without such restrictions implies that China averted more than 500 million births between 1970 and 2015, a number which may reach one billion by 2060 given all the lost descendants of births averted during the era of fertility restrictions, with one-child restrictions accounting for the great bulk of that reduction.[\\[497\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-516)\n\nThe policy, along with traditional preference for boys, may have contributed to an imbalance in the [sex ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sex_ratio) at birth.[\\[498\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-517)[\\[499\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-Ref_2007a-518) According to the 2010 census, the sex ratio at birth was 118.06 boys for every 100 girls,[\\[500\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-genderratio-519) which is beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls.[\\[501\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-520) The 2010 census found that males accounted for 51.27 percent of the total population.[\\[500\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#cite_note-genderratio-519) However, China's sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953, when males accounted for 51.82 percent of the total population.", "timestamp": 1635479196, "digest": "4swmE0KcXW1VMFLa0Re4TrRJxFRgVP4ni036rWwQjr8", "contributor": "0x02b26c24366fced1F315b68a1b40524477aA75b5"}

{"id": "gceRE4EjGSflCcygtKd6DEEDKdumXJngKuvO0qv0Am0", "title": "Governance on Solana (DAO 🥲)", "body": "## Inventory\n\nSolana has a built in Governance program.  As such it’s not very usable, you need UI to interact with the contract conveniently. As such there is a Mango partnered instance of frontend, but anyone could build one (cf [Squads](https://squads.medium.com/))\n\n* a back-office web app to create and manage DAO called [Oyster]() on GH, the [UI looks like this]().\n* a use-facing web app to allow access for voting and seeing governance proposals, called [governance-ui]() on GH, the [UI looks like this](). It has been built w/ Mango Market people, that’s the Mango DAO we know.\n\nThe back office does not allow the creation of DAO by anyone right now, but I imagine they have a tiny vetting process as to who can interact and getting in touch with them should allow a “listing”.\n\n## The Governance Primitive on Solana\n\nBelow is the diagram of the governance program. I’ll go through the documentation and add some comments. This is a personal notes kind of document.\n\n![OCD level 120% at all the non-straight boxes and arrows](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GgoZbyTtxztDLkSE_hV2d.png?height=1451&width=1304)\n\n## Realm Account - The top level organisation\n\n> **Realm account** ties Community Token Mint and optional Council Token mint to create a realm for any governance pertaining to the community of the token holders. For example a trading protocol can issue a governance token and use it to create its governance realm.\n\nThis is a top level thing that is like an internal DAO for the team, it can use the governance token, or a separate TeamGovernance token. I think using the governance one is fine if you setup things manually pre IDO, else the TeamGovernance one can come handy. See the end of this doc for an example.\n\nIt represents the organisation, and from this you derive new `ProgramGovernance` instances, each of them managing ONE and only program.\n\n## Governance Accounts - The controllers\n\n### Program Governance Account - Program\n\n> The basic building block of governance to update programs is the ProgramGovernance account. It ties a governed Program ID and holds configuration options defining governance rules. The governed Program ID is used as the seed for a [Program Derived Address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses), and this program derived address is what is used as the address of the Governance account for your Program ID.\n>\n> What this means is that there can only ever be ONE Governance account for a given Program. The governance program validates at creation time of the Governance account that the current upgrade authority of the program taken under governance signed the transaction. Optionally `CreateProgramGovernance` instruction can also transfer `upgrade_authority` of the governed program to the Governance PDA at the creation time of the Governance account.\n\nYou deploy your program, and then transfer the authority to the governance account. (?)\n\nThis then provide an API for upgrades.\n\n*I wonder how the upgrade goes, what are the limitations like update size if it needs to fits CPI calls?*\n\n### Mint Governance account - Mint\n\n> A mint governance account allows a mint authority to setup governance over an SPL Mint account. The Governance program validates at creation time that the current mint authority signed the transaction to create the governance and optionally can transfer the authority to the Governance account. Once setup the Mint Governance allows governance participants to create Proposals which execute mint instructions for the governed Mint.\n\nSimilar logic as the Program Governance Account above, except the API is tailor to cater for Minting needs.\n\n### Token Governance account - SPL Token Account (wallet)\n\n> A token governance account allows a token account owner to setup governance over an SPL Token account. The Governance program validates at creation time the current owner signed the transaction to create the governance and optionally can transfer the owner to the Governance account. Once setup the Token Governance allows participants to create Proposals to execute transfer instructions from the governed token account.\n\nSimilar to the PGA and MGA above, except it’s a SPL wallet API this time.\n\n## Authority\n\n### Proposal accounts\n\n> A Proposal is an instance of a Governance created to vote on and execute given set of instructions. It is created by someone (Proposal Owner) and tied to a given Governance account and has a set of executable instructions to it, a name and a description. It goes through various states (draft, voting, executing, ...) and users can vote on it if they have relevant Community or Council tokens. Its rules are determined by the Governance account that it is tied to, and when it executes, it is only eligible to use the [Program Derived Address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses) authority given by the Governance account. So a Proposal for Sushi cannot for instance upgrade the Program for Uniswap.\n\nThis is the actual Proposal submitted to the public for voting. But before it goes live… ⤵️\n\n> When a Proposal is created by a user then the user becomes Proposal Owner and receives permission to edit the Proposal. With this power the Owner can edit the Proposal, add/remove Signatories to the Proposal and also cancel it. These Signatories can then show their approval of the Proposal by signing it off. Once all Signatories have signed off the Proposal the Proposal leaves Draft state and enters Voting state. Voting state lasts as long as the Governance has it configured to last, and during this time people holding Community (or Council) tokens may vote on the Proposal. Once the Proposal is \"tipped\" it either enters the Defeated or Succeeded state. If the vote can't be tipped automatically during the voting period but still reaches the required Yes vote threshold it can be manually transitioned to Succeeded state using FinalizeVote instruction. Once all Proposal instructions are executed the Proposal enters Completed state.\n\nThis explain the several stages of a proposal, it’s to prevent indirect rugs like team member X votes to transfer all the treasury to his wallet with lowest treshold and vote himself.\n\n> In the Executing state an instruction can be run by any one at any time after the `instruction_hold_up_time` period has transpired\n\nThis is for time-lock and vesting, nice.\n\n\n_____\n\nTL:DR; for the last bits is that a `ProposalAccount` can have several `ProposalInstructions`, the actual pieces of work (send X tokens to Billy - Update the program with his patch). If that interest you I think you’ll go in [the doc]() and check the voting dynamic that I haven’t mentioned here. All what I talked about is from there anyway.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/06rBmfJZt-Fh0Enc8H2W5.png?height=1490&width=1775)\n\n## Respect my authority, how does it all come together\n\nSo usually, a team would have control over the Program deployment, Minting of its IDO’d {gov/shit}coins, and control the wallet(s) (IDO profits, fees, community…).\n\nThis is a big responsibility, because upgrading the program on Solana means changing its behaviour silently. Any project with control of the Program Deployment can just send an TX to suck your NFT the next time you transact without doing a forensic analysis of the TX prompt if they want, and the confirmation UI/UX is not always super clear (quite good on Phantom now though)\n\nI won’t speak about Mint and Wallet unilateral control, which is straight forward about the involved risks.\n\n\n_____\n\nTo overcome that, the governance above is a great tool, the important bit being :\n\n> Governance can handle arbitrary executions of code.\n\nIn the example above, let’s say the team delegates Program Deployment, Mint and Wallets to the DAO. Then is mean that the only way they have to interact with these is to to submit proposals and get them approved.\n\nLet’s say they want to pay a bug bounty, then they craft the TX with the amount and in/outs, then send it to the `TokenGovernanceAccount` (not sure about the exact flow but you get the idea) and it will be there waiting to reach a treshold of vote or the timeout for the program to decide wether it should pass (be signed by it's Authority) or be rejected.\n\nGov token holder go on the aforementioned UI and vote with their stake. On given proposals.\n\n\n______\n\nIt’s an indirection layer that prevents bamboozles, with supplementary indirection-ception.\n\nIt can feel a bit useless, as usually the teams/investors/whales own a large chunk of the tokens, and could band up to do bad things?

{"id": "hiuom1sQI0tsM_SR-eMpro3AFlfdJOyvzet6_fgUkY8", "title": "Baking - Wikipedia", "body": "All types of food can be baked, but some require special care and protection from direct heat. Various techniques have been developed to provide this protection.\n\nIn addition to bread, baking is used to prepare [cakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake), [pastries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry), [pies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie), [tarts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tart), [quiches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiche), [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie), [scones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scone), [crackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracker_(food)), [pretzels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretzel), and more. These popular items are known collectively as \"baked goods,\" and are often sold at a [bakery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakery), which is a store that carries only baked goods, or at markets, grocery stores, farmers markets or through other venues.\n\nMeat, including [cured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)) meats, such as [ham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham) can also be baked, but baking is usually reserved for [meatloaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meatloaf), smaller cuts of whole meats, or whole meats that contain [stuffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuffing) or coating such as [bread crumbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_crumbs) or [buttermilk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttermilk) [batter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batter_(cooking)). Some foods are surrounded with moisture during baking by placing a small amount of liquid (such as [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water) or [broth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broth)) in the bottom of a closed pan, and letting it steam up around the food. [Roasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roasting) is a term synonymous with baking, but traditionally denotes the cooking of whole animals or major cuts through exposure to dry heat; for instance, one bakes chicken parts but roasts the whole bird. One can bake pork or lamb chops but roasts the whole loin or leg. There are many exceptions to this rule of the two terms. Baking and roasting otherwise involve the same range of cooking times and temperatures. Another form of baking is the method known as *en croûte* (French for \"in a pastry crust\"), which protects the food from direct heat and seals the natural juices inside. Meat, [poultry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry), [game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_(food)), fish or [vegetables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable) can be prepared by baking *en croûte*. Well-known examples include [Beef Wellington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_Wellington), where the beef is encased in [pastry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry) before baking; [pâté en croûte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9), where the [terrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrine_(food)) is encased in pastry before baking; and the Vietnamese variant, a meat-filled pastry called [pâté chaud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chaud). The *en croûte* method also allows meat to be baked by burying it in the embers of a fire – a favorite method of cooking [venison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venison). Salt can also be used to make a protective crust that is not eaten. Another method of protecting food from the heat while it is baking is to cook it *[en papillote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_papillote)* (French for \"in parchment\"). In this method, the food is covered by [baking paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchment_paper_(baking)) (or [aluminium foil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_foil)) to protect it while it is being baked. The cooked parcel of food is sometimes served unopened, allowing diners to discover the contents for themselves which adds an element of surprise.\n\nA [terracotta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta) [baking mould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking_mould) for [pastry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry) or [bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread), representing goats and a lion attacking a cow. Early 2nd millennium BC, Royal palace at [Mari, Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari,_Syria)\n\n[Eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)) can also be used in baking to produce savoury or sweet dishes. In combination with [dairy products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_products) especially [cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese), they are often prepared as a [dessert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessert). For example, although a baked [custard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custard) can be made using starch (in the form of [flour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour), [cornflour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_starch), [arrowroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowroot), or [potato flour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_flour)), the flavor of the dish is much more delicate if eggs are used as the thickening agent. Baked custards, such as [crème caramel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A8me_caramel), are among the items that need protection from an oven's direct heat, and the *[bain-marie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain-marie)* method serves this purpose. The cooking container is half submerged in water in another, larger one, so that the heat in the oven is more gently applied during the baking process. Baking a successful [soufflé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souffl%C3%A9) requires that the baking process be carefully controlled. The oven temperature must be absolutely even and the oven space not shared with another dish. These factors, along with the theatrical effect of an air-filled dessert, have given this baked food a reputation for being a culinary achievement. Similarly, a good baking technique (and a good oven) are also needed to create a [baked Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baked_Alaska) because of the difficulty of baking hot [meringue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meringue) and cold [ice cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream) at the same time.\n\nBaking can also be used to prepare other foods such as [pizzas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzas), [baked potatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baked_potato), baked apples, [baked beans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baked_beans), some [casseroles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casserole) and [pasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta) dishes such as [lasagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasagne).", "timestamp": 1635475892, "digest": "KskTXL89QB-QBnS0CSaS9c19cy9aDjc1CcZEqvItlv8", "contributor": "0x52fcbf14381DBb1e28CA12a459B2E3A4881A85e5"}
{"id": "jDzk_ysvyyXWQ1kz31217G4gWx3oye1j2SJdYBpUqfQ", "title": "DAO on Solana", "body": "## Inventory\n\n \n Solana has a built in Governance program.  As such it’s not very usable, you need UI to interact with the contract conveniently. As such there is a Mango partnered instance of frontend, but anyone could build one (cf [Squads](https://squads.medium.com/))\n\n* a back-office web app to create and manage DAO called [Oyster]() on GH, the [UI looks like this](). \n* a use-facing web app to allow access for voting and seeing governance proposals, called [governance-ui]() on GH, the [UI looks like this](). It has been built w/ Mango Market people, that’s the Mango DAO we know.\n\nThe back office does not allow the creation of DAO by anyone right now, but I imagine they have a tiny vetting process as to who can interact and getting in touch with them should allow a “listing”.\n\n## The Governance Primitive on Solana\n\nBelow is the diagram of the governance program. I’ll go through the documentation and add some comments. This is a personal notes kind of document.\n\n![OCD level 120% at all the non-straight boxes and arrows](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GgoZbyTtxztDLkSE_hV2d.png?height=1451&width=1304)\n\n## Realm Account - The top level organisation\n\n> **Realm account** ties Community Token Mint and optional Council Token mint to create a realm for any governance pertaining to the community of the token holders. For example a trading protocol can issue a governance token and use it to create its governance realm.\n\nThis is a top level thing that is like an internal DAO for the team, it can use the governance token, or a separate TeamGovernance token. I think using the governance one is fine, if there is a way to time lock it.\n\nIt represents the organisation, and from this you derive new `ProgramGovernance` instances, each of them managing ONE and only program.\n\n## Governance Accounts - The controllers\n\n### Program Governance Account - Program\n\n> The basic building block of governance to update programs is the ProgramGovernance account. It ties a governed Program ID and holds configuration options defining governance rules. The governed Program ID is used as the seed for a [Program Derived Address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses), and this program derived address is what is used as the address of the Governance account for your Program ID.\n>\n> What this means is that there can only ever be ONE Governance account for a given Program. The governance program validates at creation time of the Governance account that the current upgrade authority of the program taken under governance signed the transaction. Optionally `CreateProgramGovernance` instruction can also transfer `upgrade_authority` of the governed program to the Governance PDA at the creation time of the Governance account.\n\nYou deploy your program, and then transfer the authority to the governance account. (?)\n\nThis then provide an API for upgrades.\n\n*I wonder how the upgrade goes, what are the limitations like update size if it needs to fits CPI calls?*\n\n### Mint Governance account - Mint \n\n> A mint governance account allows a mint authority to setup governance over an SPL Mint account. The Governance program validates at creation time that the current mint authority signed the transaction to create the governance and optionally can transfer the authority to the Governance account. Once setup the Mint Governance allows governance participants to create Proposals which execute mint instructions for the governed Mint.\n\nSimilar logic as the Program Governance Account above, except the API is tailor to cater for Minting needs.\n\n### Token Governance account - SPL Token Account (wallet)\n\n> A token governance account allows a token account owner to setup governance over an SPL Token account. The Governance program validates at creation time the current owner signed the transaction to create the governance and optionally can transfer the owner to the Governance account. Once setup the Token Governance allows participants to create Proposals to execute transfer instructions from the governed token account.\n\nSimilar to the PGA and MGA above, except it’s a SPL wallet API this time.\n\n## Authority\n\n### Proposal accounts\n\n> A Proposal is an instance of a Governance created to vote on and execute given set of instructions. It is created by someone (Proposal Owner) and tied to a given Governance account and has a set of executable instructions to it, a name and a description. It goes through various states (draft, voting, executing, ...) and users can vote on it if they have relevant Community or Council tokens. Its rules are determined by the Governance account that it is tied to, and when it executes, it is only eligible to use the [Program Derived Address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses) authority given by the Governance account. So a Proposal for Sushi cannot for instance upgrade the Program for Uniswap.\n\nThis is the actual Proposal submitted to the public for voting. But before it goes live… ⤵️\n\n> When a Proposal is created by a user then the user becomes Proposal Owner and receives permission to edit the Proposal. With this power the Owner can edit the Proposal, add/remove Signatories to the Proposal and also cancel it. These Signatories can then show their approval of the Proposal by signing it off. Once all Signatories have signed off the Proposal the Proposal leaves Draft state and enters Voting state. Voting state lasts as long as the Governance has it configured to last, and during this time people holding Community (or Council) tokens may vote on the Proposal. Once the Proposal is \"tipped\" it either enters the Defeated or Succeeded state. If the vote can't be tipped automatically during the voting period but still reaches the required Yes vote threshold it can be manually transitioned to Succeeded state using FinalizeVote instruction. Once all Proposal instructions are executed the Proposal enters Completed state.\n\nThis explain the several stages of a proposal, it’s to prevent indirect rugs like team member X votes to transfer all the treasury to his wallet with lowest treshold and vote himself.\n\n> In the Executing state an instruction can be run by any one at any time after the `instruction_hold_up_time` period has transpired\n\nThis is for time-lock and vesting, nice.\n\n_____ \n  \n TL:DR; for the last bits is that a `ProposalAccount` can have several `ProposalInstructions`, the actual pieces of work (send X tokens to Billy - Update the program with his patch).

Any project with control of the Program Deployment can just send an TX to suck your NFT the next time you transact without doing a forensic analysis of the TX prompt if they want, and the confirmation UI/UX is not always super clear (quite good on Phantom now though)\n\nI won’t speak about Mint and Wallet unilateral control, which is straight forward about the involved risks.\n\n_____\n\nTo overcome that, the governance above is a great tool, the important bit being :\n\n> Governance can handle arbitrary executions of code.\n\nIn the example above, let’s say the team delegates Program Deployment, Mint and Wallets to the DAO. Then is mean that the only way they have to interact with these is to to submit proposals and get them approved.\n\nLet’s say they want to pay a bug bounty, then they craft the TX with the amount and in/outs, then send it to the `TokenGovernanceAccount` (not sure about the exact flow but you get the idea) and it will be there waiting to reach a treshold of vote or the timeout for the program to decide wether it should pass (be signed by it's Authority) or be rejected.\n\nGov token holder go on the aforementioned UI and vote with their stake. On given proposals.\n\n______\n\nIt’s an indirection layer that prevents bamboozles, with supplementary indirection-ception. \n\nIt can feel a bit useless, as usually the teams/investors/whales own a large chunk of the tokens, and could band up to do bad things? But it’s what a governance is, people who have stake decides. That’s the base rule.\n\nWhat’s valuable here is that least we got it fully transparent and immuable, thanks to the blockchain™️.

During the First Opium War (1839–1842), British forces occupied the city.\\[36\\] The war ended in 1842 with the Treaty of Nanking, which opened Shanghai as one of the five treaty ports for international trade.\\[37\\] The Treaty of the Bogue, the Treaty of Wanghia, and the Treaty of Whampoa (signed in 1843, 1844, and 1844, respectively) forced Chinese concession to European and American desires for visitation and trade on Chinese soil. Britain, France, and the United States all established a presence outside the walled city of Shanghai, which remained under the direct administration of the Chinese.\\[38\\]\n\n### The Chinese-held Old City of Shanghai fell to rebels from the Small Swords Society in 1853, but was recovered by the Qing government in February 1855.\\[39\\] In 1854, the Shanghai Municipal Council was created to manage the foreign settlements. Between 1860 and 1862, the Taiping rebels twice attacked Shanghai and destroyed the city's eastern and southern suburbs, but failed to take the city.\\[40\\] In 1863, the British settlement to the south of Suzhou Creek (northern Huangpu District) and the American settlement to the north (southern Hongkou District) joined in order to form the Shanghai International Settlement.

All this international activity gave Shanghai the nickname \"the Great Athens of China\".\\[42\\] In 1914, the Old City walls were dismantled because they blocked the city's expansion. In July 1921, the Communist Party of China was founded in the French Concession.\\[38\\] On 30 May 1925, the May Thirtieth Movement broke out when a worker in a Japanese-owned cotton mill was shot and killed by a Japanese foreman.\\[43\\] Workers in the city then launched general strikes against imperialism, which became nationwide protests that gave rise to Chinese nationalism.\\[44\\]\n\n### The golden age of Shanghai began with its elevation to municipality after it was separated from Jiangsu on 7 July 1927.\\[38\\]\\[45\\] This new Chinese municipality covered an area of 494.69 km2 (191.0 sq mi), including the modern-day districts of Baoshan, Yangpu, Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong, but excluded the foreign concessions territories.\\[45\\] Headed by a Chinese mayor and municipal council, the new city government's first task—the Greater Shanghai Plan—was to create a new city center in Jiangwan town of Yangpu district, outside the boundaries of the foreign concessions.

The city is located on the southern estuary of the Yangtze River, with the Huangpu River flowing through it. With a population of 24.87 million as of 2020, it is the most populous urban area in China, the most populous city proper in the world and the only city in East Asia with GDP greater than its corresponding capitals. Shanghai is a global center for finance, business and economics, research, education, science and technology, manufacturing, tourism, culture and transportation, and the Port of Shanghai is the world's busiest container port.\n\n### Originally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to both domestic and foreign trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five treaty ports forced to open to European trade after the First Opium War. The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of Asia in the 1930s. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai. After the war, with the CPC takeover of mainland China in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries and the city's global influence declined.\n\n### By the 1990s, economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping a decade earlier resulted in an intense redevelopment of the city, especially the Pudong New Area, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment. The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance; It is the home of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, one of the largest stock exchanges in the world by market capitalization and the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone the first free-trade zone in mainland China. As of 2020, Shanghai is classified as an Alpha+ (global first-tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network and ranked as having the 3rd most competitive and largest financial center in the world behind New York City and London. It has the largest metro network of any city in the world, the sixth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world, the fifth-largest scientific research output of any city in the world, and highly ranked educational institutions including four Project 985 universities: Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Tongji University, and East China Normal University.\n\n### Shanghai has been described as the \"showpiece\" of the booming economy of China. Featuring several architectural styles such as Art Deco and shikumen, the city is renowned for its Lujiazui skyline, museums and historic buildings including the City God Temple, Yu Garden, the China Pavilion and buildings along the Bund. Shanghai is also known for its sugary cuisine, distinctive local language and vibrant international flair. As an important international city, Shanghai is the seat of the New Development Bank, a multilateral development bank established by the BRICS states and the city hosts more than 70 foreign representatives and numerous national and international events every year, such as Shanghai Fashion Week, the Chinese Grand Prix and ChinaJoy. Shanghai is the highest earning tourist city in the world,\\[15\\] with the seventh most five-star hotels in the world,\\[16\\] and the second tallest building in the world, the Shanghai Tower. In 2018, Shanghai hosted the first China International Import Expo (CIIE), the world's first import-themed national-level expo.", "timestamp": 1635479301, "digest": "Vrr0P4mgehnIcAHHjwWZ5BSnxMslIPxIW0hwkqmX2rA", "contributor": "0xd8dCf3E3C9e0e7a12784EFb644f07Bd5A7a29b0C"}

Colonies are annual with only inseminated queens [overwintering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwinter). Fertilized queens are found in protected places such as in hollow logs, stumps, under bark, leaf litter, soil cavities, and man-made structures. Queens emerge during the warm days of late spring or early summer, select a nest site, and build a small paper nest in which they lay eggs. After eggs hatch from the 30 to 50 brood cells, the queen feeds the young larvae for about 18 to 20  days. [Larvae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larvae) [pupate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupate), then emerge later as small, infertile females called workers. Workers in the colony take over caring for the larvae, feeding them with chewed-up meat or fruit. By midsummer, the first adult workers emerge and assume the tasks of nest expansion, foraging for food, care of the queen and larvae, and colony defense.\n\nFrom this time until her death in the autumn, the queen remains inside the nest, laying eggs. The colony then expands rapidly, reaching a maximum size of 4,000–5,000[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowjacket#cite_note-3) workers and a nest of 10,000–15,000 cells in late summer. The species *V. squamosa*, in the southern part of its range, may build much larger perennial colonies populated by dozens of queens, tens of thousands of workers, and hundreds of thousands of cells. At peak size, reproductive cells are built with new males and queens produced. Adult reproductives remain in the nest fed by the workers. New queens build up fat reserves to overwinter. Adult reproductives leave the parent colony to mate. After mating, males quickly die, while fertilized queens seek protected places to overwinter. Parent colony workers dwindle, usually leaving the nest to die, as does the founding queen. Abandoned nests rapidly decompose and disintegrate during the winter. They can persist as long as they are kept dry, but are rarely used again. In the spring, the cycle is repeated; weather in the spring is the most important factor in colony establishment.\n\nThe adult yellowjacket diet consists primarily of sugars and [carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrates), such as fruits, flower nectar, and tree sap. Larvae feed on proteins derived from insects, meats, and fish. Workers collect, chew, and condition such foods before feeding them to the larvae. Many of the insects collected by the workers are considered pest species, making the yellowjacket beneficial to [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture).[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowjacket#cite_note-motherearthnews.com-4) Larvae, in return, secrete a sugary substance for workers to eat; this exchange is a form of [trophallaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophallaxis). As insect sources of food diminish in late summer, larvae produce less for workers to eat. Foraging workers pursue sources of sugar outside the nest including ripe fruits and human garbage.", "timestamp": 1635476213, "digest": "0kQjcGJohQL2dKrlt6eIlKhUkTsoC8oePMwkpaSPE1A", "contributor": "0x1c387a6c105C0e856309E2713322ddEA64e4fFfA"}

However, more than with most perennial fruits, apples must be propagated asexually to obtain the sweetness and other desirable characteristics of the parent. This is because seedling apples are an example of \"[extreme heterozygotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity)\", in that rather than inheriting genes from their parents to create a new apple with parental characteristics, they are instead significantly different from their parents, perhaps to compete with the many pests.[\\[51\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-51) [Triploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid) cultivars have an additional reproductive barrier in that 3 sets of chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis, yielding unequal segregation of the chromosomes (aneuploids). Even in the case when a triploid plant can produce a seed (apples are an example), it occurs infrequently, and seedlings rarely survive.[\\[52\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-52)\n\nBecause apples do not [breed true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True-breeding_organism) when planted as seeds, although [cuttings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_(plant)) can take root and breed true, and may live for a century, [grafting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting) is usually used. The [rootstock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstock) used for the bottom of the graft can be selected to produce trees of a large variety of sizes, as well as changing the winter hardiness, insect and disease resistance, and soil preference of the resulting tree. Dwarf rootstocks can be used to produce very small trees (less than 3.0 m or 10 ft high at maturity), which bear fruit many years earlier in their life cycle than full size trees, and are easier to harvest.[\\[53\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-53) Dwarf rootstocks for apple trees can be traced as far back as 300 BCE, to the area of [Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia) and [Asia Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Minor). [Alexander the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great) sent samples of dwarf apple trees to [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle)'s [Lyceum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyceum). Dwarf rootstocks became common by the 15th century and later went through several cycles of popularity and decline throughout the world.[\\[54\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-54) The majority of the rootstocks used today to control size in apples were developed in England in the early 1900s. The [East Malling Research Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Malling_Research_Station) conducted extensive research into rootstocks, and today their rootstocks are given an \"M\" prefix to designate their origin. Rootstocks marked with an \"MM\" prefix are Malling-series cultivars later crossed with trees of '[Northern Spy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Spy)' in [Merton, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Merton).[\\[55\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-55)\n\nMost new apple cultivars originate as seedlings, which either arise by chance or are bred by deliberately crossing cultivars with promising characteristics.[\\[56\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-book9-56) The words \"seedling\", \"pippin\", and \"kernel\" in the name of an apple cultivar suggest that it originated as a seedling. Apples can also form [bud sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_sport) (mutations on a single branch). Some bud sports turn out to be improved strains of the parent cultivar. Some differ sufficiently from the parent tree to be considered new cultivars.[\\[57\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-app4-57)\n\nSince the 1930s, the Excelsior Experiment Station at the [University of Minnesota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota) has introduced a steady progression of important apples that are widely grown, both commercially and by local orchardists, throughout [Minnesota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota) and [Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin).

Beginning around 300 BC, the pastry cook became an occupation for Romans (known as the pastillarium) and became a respected profession because pastries were considered decadent, and Romans loved festivity and celebration. Thus, pastries were often cooked especially for large banquets, and any pastry cook who could invent new types of tasty treats was highly prized. Around 1 AD, there were more than three hundred pastry chefs in Rome, and Cato wrote about how they created all sorts of diverse foods and flourished professionally and socially because of their creations. Cato speaks of an enormous number of breads including; libum (sacrificial cakes made with flour), placenta (groats and cress), spira (modern day flour pretzels), scibilata ([tortes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torte)), savaillum (sweet cake), and globus apherica ([fritters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritter)). A great selection of these, with many different variations, different ingredients, and varied patterns, were often found at [banquets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banquet) and dining halls.

The Shanghai-based SAIC Motor is one of the three largest automotive corporations in China, and has strategic partnerships with Volkswagen and General Motors.\\[145\\]\n\n* [Kobayashi Pharmaceutical](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B0%8F%E6%9E%97%E5%88%B6%E8%8D%AF)\n* [Mondelez International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondelez_International)\n* [Danone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danone)\n* [PepsiCo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PepsiCo)\n* [Nongshim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nongshim)\n* [Unicharm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicharm)\n* [Kao Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kao_Corporation)\n* [Ezaki Glico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezaki_Glico)\n* [Meiji Holdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Holdings)\n* [Unilever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever)\n* [Bayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer)\n* [Victoria's Secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria%27s_Secret)\n* [Taisho Pharmaceutical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taisho_Pharmaceutical)\n* [Estée Lauder Companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Est%C3%A9e_Lauder_Companies)\n* [Revlon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revlon)\n* [GlaxoSmithKline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline)\n* [L'Oréal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Or%C3%A9al)\n* [The Walt Disney Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company)\n  * [Disney Parks, Experiences and Products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Parks,_Experiences_and_Products)\n* [SAIC Motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Motor)\n  * [SAIC-GM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC-GM)\n  * [SAIC Volkswagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Volkswagen)\n* [Starbucks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks)\n  * [Starbucks Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks_Reserve)\n\n### Tourism\n\n### See also: List of tourist attractions in Shanghai\n\n### The Nanjing Pedestrian Street in the evening, with the Radisson New World Hotel in the background\n\n### Tourism is a major industry of Shanghai. In 2017, the number of domestic tourists increased by 7.5% to 318 million, while the number of overseas tourists increased by 2.2% to 8.73 million.\\[140\\] In 2017, Shanghai was the highest earning tourist city in the world, which is expected to maintain until 2027.\\[15\\] As of 2017, Shanghai had 33 five-star hotels, ranking 7th in the world.\\[16\\] As of 2019, the city had 71 five-star hotels, 61 four star hotels, 1,758 travel agencies, 113 rated tourist attractions, and 34 red tourist attractions.\\[123\\]\n\n### The conference and meeting sector is also growing. According to the International Congress and Convention Association, Shanghai hosted 82 international meetings in 2018, a 34% increase from 61 in 2017.\\[146\\]\\[147\\]\n\n### Free-trade zone\n\n### Main article: Shanghai Free-Trade Zone\n\n### Shanghai is home to China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone, the first free-trade zone in mainland China.\\[148\\] As of October 2019, it is also the second largest free-trade zone in mainland China in terms of land area (behind Hainan Free Trade Zone \\[zh\\], which covers the whole Hainan province\\[149\\]) by covering an area of 240.22 km2 (92.75 sq mi) and integrating four existing bonded zones—Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, Waigaoqiao Free Trade Logistics Park, Yangshan Free Trade Port Area, and Pudong Airport Comprehensive Free Trade Zone.\\[150\\]\\[151\\] Several preferential policies have been implemented to attract foreign investment in various industries to the zone. Because the zone is not technically considered Chinese territory for tax purposes, commodities entering the zone are exempt from duty and customs clearance.\\[152\\]", "timestamp": 1635479508, "digest": "KZicyQg5NP2ufCkRflcgkWJKsAp1batXDtdV8YgzqVY", "contributor": "0x34de2a6645A4339f4b1Cba1b2A1BEe0818A5FCEe"}

One of the problems identifying apples in religion, [mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology) and [folktales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore) is that the word \"apple\" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit, other than berries, including nuts, as late as the 17th century.[\\[31\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-app3-31) For instance, in [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology), the [Greek hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_hero) [Heracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles), as a part of his [Twelve Labours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labours_of_Hercules), was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the [Tree of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesperides#The_Garden_of_the_Hesperides) growing at its center.[\\[32\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-book1-32)[\\[33\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-book2-33)[\\[34\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-34)\n\nThe Greek goddess of discord, [Eris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_(mythology)), became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of [Peleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peleus) and [Thetis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thetis).[\\[35\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-35) In retaliation, she tossed a [golden apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_of_Discord) inscribed [Καλλίστη](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kallisti) (*Kalliste*, sometimes transliterated *Kallisti*, \"For the most beautiful one\"), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: [Hera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera), [Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena), and [Aphrodite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite). [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_(mythology)) of [Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy) was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, [Helen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_of_Troy) of [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta). He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the [Trojan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War).[\\[36\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-36)\n\nThe apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, sacred to Aphrodite. To throw an apple at someone was to symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance of that love. An epigram claiming authorship by Plato states:[\\[37\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-37)\n\n> I throw the apple at you, and if you are willing to love me, take it and share your girlhood with me; but if your thoughts are what I pray they are not, even then take it, and consider how short-lived is beauty.\n>\n> — [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato), Epigram VII\n\n[Atalanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta), also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage.

Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.", "timestamp": 1635475388, "digest": "qgC4E_r-XTDjGzLIruOTaPJtrXyyGEmDx6pk_OHScH4", "contributor": "0x2a351B530fbbC4F9b8eD7A4eB4FbbB9D29F145C6"}
{"id": "rHOjLf2RWpV4CNYnhoRZbRoDk53-vT0FV0TbFSpNxQg", "title": "Commercial baking", "body": "Eventually, the Roman art of baking became known throughout Europe and eventually spread to eastern parts of Asia. By the 13th century in London, commercial trading, including baking, had many regulations attached. In the case of food, they were designed to create a system \"so there was little possibility of false measures, adulterated food or shoddy manufactures.\" There were by that time twenty regulations applying to bakers alone, including that every baker had to have \"the impression of his seal\" upon bread.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking#cite_note-Ackroyd-6)\n\nBeginning in the 19th century, alternative leavening agents became more common, such as [baking soda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking_soda).[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking#cite_note-Morgan2012-4) Bakers often baked goods at home and then sold them in the streets. This scene was so common that [Rembrandt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt), among others, painted a pastry chef selling pancakes in the streets of Germany, with children clamoring for a sample. In London, pastry chefs sold their goods from handcarts. This developed into a delivery system of baked goods to households and greatly increased demand as a result. In Paris, the first open-air café of baked goods was developed, and baking became an established art throughout the entire world.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking#cite_note-7)\n\n[Schulze Baking Company Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_Baking_Company_Plant), [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago) (1914–15)\n\n> Every family used to prepare the bread for its own consumption, the *trade* of baking, not having yet taken shape. \n [Mrs Beeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Beeton) (1861)[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking#cite_note-Beeton-8)\n\nBaking eventually developed into a commercial industry using automated machinery which enabled more goods to be produced for widespread distribution. In the United States, the baking industry \"was built on marketing methods used during feudal times and production techniques developed by the Romans.\"[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking#cite_note-Whitten-9) Some makers of [snacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snacks) such as [potato chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_chips#Similar_foods) or crisps have produced baked versions of their snack products as an alternative to the usual cooking method of [deep frying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_frying) in an attempt to reduce their calorie or fat content. Baking has opened up doors to businesses such as cake shops and factories where the baking process is done with larger amounts in large, open furnaces.\\[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*\\]\n\nThe aroma and texture of baked goods as they come out of the oven are strongly appealing but is a quality that is quickly lost. Since the flavour and appeal largely depend on freshness, commercial producers have to compensate by using [food additives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive) as well as imaginative labeling. As more and more baked goods are purchased from commercial suppliers, producers try to capture that original appeal by adding the label \"home-baked.\" Such attempts seek to make an emotional link to the remembered freshness of baked goods as well as to attach positive associations the purchaser has with the idea of \"home\" to the bought product. Freshness is such an important quality that restaurants, although they are commercial (and not domestic) preparers of food, bake their own products. For example, scones at [The Ritz London Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ritz_London_Hotel) \"are not baked until early afternoon on the day they are to be served, to make sure they are as fresh as possible.\"[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking#cite_note-10)\n\n## Equipment\n\nBaking needs an enclosed space for heating – typically in an [oven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oven). The fuel can be supplied by wood, coal, gas, or electricity. Adding and removing items from an oven may be done by hand with an oven mitt or by a [peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_(tool)), a long handled tool specifically used for that purpose.\n\nMany commercial ovens are equipped with two heating elements: one for baking, using [convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_oven) and [thermal conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction) to heat the food, and one for broiling or grilling, heating mainly by radiation. Another piece of equipment still used for baking is the [Dutch oven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_oven). \"Also called a bake kettle, bastable, bread oven, fire pan, bake oven kail pot, tin kitchen, roasting kitchen, *doufeu* (French: \"gentle fire\") or *feu de compagne* (French: \"country oven\") \\[it\\] originally replaced the cooking jack as the latest fireside cooking technology,\" combining \"the convenience of pot-oven and hangover oven.\"[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking#cite_note-Snodgrass-11)\n\nAsian cultures have adopted steam baskets to produce the effect of baking while reducing the amount of fat needed.[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking#cite_note-Chinese-12)\n\n## Process\n\nBaking bread at the [Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscheider_Hof_Open_Air_Museum)\n\nBaked goods\n\nEleven events occur concurrently during baking, some of which (such as [starch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch) gelatinization) would not occur at room temperature.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFigoni201138-13)\n\n 1.

The browning is caused by caramelization of sugars and the [Maillard reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction). Maillard browning occurs when \"sugars break down in the presence of proteins. Because foods contain many different types of sugars and proteins, Maillard browning contributes to the flavour of a wide range of foods, including nuts, roast beef and baked bread.\"[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFigoni201142-15) The moisture is never entirely \"sealed in\"; over time, an item being baked will become dry. This is often an advantage, especially in situations where drying is the desired outcome, like drying [herbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb) or roasting certain types of vegetables.\n\nThe baking process does not require any fat to be used to cook in an oven. When baking, consideration must be given to the amount of fat that is contained in the food item. Higher levels of fat such as [margarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarine), [butter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter), lard, or vegetable [shortening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening) will cause an item to spread out during the baking process.\n\nWith the passage of time, breads harden and become [stale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staling). This is not primarily due to moisture being lost from the baked products, but more a reorganization of the way in which the water and starch are associated over time. This process is similar to [recrystallization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recrystallization_(chemistry)) and is promoted by storage at cool temperatures, such as in a domestic refrigerator or freezer.", "timestamp": 1635475935, "digest": "l5Dg5Mtc_Z_nZpX9yb_I1uifXqXuOdirj5dnBTCwDdw", "contributor": "0x52fcbf14381DBb1e28CA12a459B2E3A4881A85e5"}
{"id": "rHT9wgJHIdbX9hzbkVTg-GIwUbvvGfxOQ7_QrQweRM0", "title": "Governance on Solana (DAO 🥲)", "body": "## Inventory\n\nSolana has a built in Governance program.  As such it’s not very usable, you need UI to interact with the contract conveniently. As such there is a Mango partnered instance of frontend, but anyone could build one (cf [Squads](https://squads.medium.com/))\n\n* a back-office web app to create and manage DAO called [Oyster]() on GH, the [UI looks like this]().\n* a use-facing web app to allow access for voting and seeing governance proposals, called [governance-ui]() on GH, the [UI looks like this](). It has been built w/ Mango Market people, that’s the Mango DAO we know.\n\nThe back office does not allow the creation of DAO by anyone right now, but I imagine they have a tiny vetting process as to who can interact and getting in touch with them should allow a “listing”.\n\n## The Governance Primitive on Solana\n\nBelow is the diagram of the governance program. I’ll go through the documentation and add some comments. This is a personal notes kind of document.\n\n![OCD level 120% at all the non-straight boxes and arrows](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GgoZbyTtxztDLkSE_hV2d.png?height=1451&width=1304)\n\n## Realm Account - The top level organisation\n\n> **Realm account** ties Community Token Mint and optional Council Token mint to create a realm for any governance pertaining to the community of the token holders. For example a trading protocol can issue a governance token and use it to create its governance realm.\n\nThis is a top level thing that is like an internal DAO for the team, it can use the governance token, or a separate TeamGovernance token. I think using the governance one is fine if you setup things manually pre IDO, else the TeamGovernance one can come handy. See the end of this doc for an example.\n\nIt represents the organisation, and from this you derive new `ProgramGovernance` instances, each of them managing ONE and only program.\n\n## Governance Accounts - The controllers\n\n### Program Governance Account - Program\n\n> The basic building block of governance to update programs is the ProgramGovernance account. It ties a governed Program ID and holds configuration options defining governance rules. The governed Program ID is used as the seed for a [Program Derived Address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses), and this program derived address is what is used as the address of the Governance account for your Program ID.\n>\n> What this means is that there can only ever be ONE Governance account for a given Program. The governance program validates at creation time of the Governance account that the current upgrade authority of the program taken under governance signed the transaction. Optionally `CreateProgramGovernance` instruction can also transfer `upgrade_authority` of the governed program to the Governance PDA at the creation time of the Governance account.\n\nYou deploy your program, and then transfer the authority to the governance account. (?)\n\nThis then provide an API for upgrades.\n\n*I wonder how the upgrade goes, what are the limitations like update size if it needs to fits CPI calls?*\n\n### Mint Governance account - Mint\n\n> A mint governance account allows a mint authority to setup governance over an SPL Mint account. The Governance program validates at creation time that the current mint authority signed the transaction to create the governance and optionally can transfer the authority to the Governance account. Once setup the Mint Governance allows governance participants to create Proposals which execute mint instructions for the governed Mint.\n\nSimilar logic as the Program Governance Account above, except the API is tailor to cater for Minting needs.\n\n### Token Governance account - SPL Token Account (wallet)\n\n> A token governance account allows a token account owner to setup governance over an SPL Token account. The Governance program validates at creation time the current owner signed the transaction to create the governance and optionally can transfer the owner to the Governance account. Once setup the Token Governance allows participants to create Proposals to execute transfer instructions from the governed token account.\n\nSimilar to the PGA and MGA above, except it’s a SPL wallet API this time.\n\n## Authority\n\n### Proposal accounts\n\n> A Proposal is an instance of a Governance created to vote on and execute given set of instructions. It is created by someone (Proposal Owner) and tied to a given Governance account and has a set of executable instructions to it, a name and a description. It goes through various states (draft, voting, executing, ...) and users can vote on it if they have relevant Community or Council tokens. Its rules are determined by the Governance account that it is tied to, and when it executes, it is only eligible to use the [Program Derived Address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses) authority given by the Governance account. So a Proposal for Sushi cannot for instance upgrade the Program for Uniswap.\n\nThis is the actual Proposal submitted to the public for voting. But before it goes live… ⤵️\n\n> When a Proposal is created by a user then the user becomes Proposal Owner and receives permission to edit the Proposal. With this power the Owner can edit the Proposal, add/remove Signatories to the Proposal and also cancel it. These Signatories can then show their approval of the Proposal by signing it off. Once all Signatories have signed off the Proposal the Proposal leaves Draft state and enters Voting state. Voting state lasts as long as the Governance has it configured to last, and during this time people holding Community (or Council) tokens may vote on the Proposal. Once the Proposal is \"tipped\" it either enters the Defeated or Succeeded state. If the vote can't be tipped automatically during the voting period but still reaches the required Yes vote threshold it can be manually transitioned to Succeeded state using FinalizeVote instruction. Once all Proposal instructions are executed the Proposal enters Completed state.\n\nThis explain the several stages of a proposal, it’s to prevent indirect rugs like team member X votes to transfer all the treasury to his wallet with lowest treshold and vote himself.\n\n> In the Executing state an instruction can be run by any one at any time after the `instruction_hold_up_time` period has transpired\n\nThis is for time-lock and vesting, nice.\n\n\n_____\n\nTL:DR; for the last bits is that a `ProposalAccount` can have several `ProposalInstructions`, the actual pieces of work (send X tokens to Billy - Update the program with his patch). If that interest you I think you’ll go in [the doc]() and check the voting dynamic that I haven’t mentioned here. All what I talked about is from there anyway.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/06rBmfJZt-Fh0Enc8H2W5.png?height=1490&width=1775)\n\n## Respect my authority, how does it all come together\n\nSo usually, a team would have control over the Program deployment, Minting of its IDO’d {gov/shit}coins, and control the wallet(s) (IDO profits, fees, community…).\n\nThis is a big responsibility, because upgrading the program on Solana means changing its behaviour silently. Any project with control of the Program Deployment can just send an TX to suck your NFT the next time you transact without doing a forensic analysis of the TX prompt if they want, and the confirmation UI/UX is not always super clear (quite good on Phantom now though)\n\nI won’t speak about Mint and Wallet unilateral control, which is straight forward about the involved risks.\n\n\n_____\n\nTo overcome that, the governance above is a great tool, the important bit being :\n\n> Governance can handle arbitrary executions of code.\n\nIn the example above, let’s say the team delegates Program Deployment, Mint and Wallets to the DAO. Then is mean that the only way they have to interact with these is to to submit proposals and get them approved.\n\nLet’s say they want to pay a bug bounty, then they craft the TX with the amount and in/outs, then send it to the `TokenGovernanceAccount` (not sure about the exact flow but you get the idea) and it will be there waiting to reach a treshold of vote or the timeout for the program to decide wether it should pass (be signed by it's Authority) or be rejected.\n\nGov token holder go on the aforementioned UI and vote with their stake. On given proposals.\n\n\n______\n\nIt’s an indirection layer that prevents bamboozles, with supplementary indirection-ception.\n\nIt can feel a bit useless, as usually the teams/investors/whales own a large chunk of the tokens, and could band up to do bad things? But it’s what a governance is, people who have stake decides. That’s the base rule.\n\nWhat’s valuable here is that least we got it fully transparent and immuable, thanks to the blockchain™️.

These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. [Organic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_farming) methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.\n\nA wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant. Three of the more common diseases or pests are mildew, aphids, and apple scab.\n\n* [Mildew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildew) is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers, normally in spring. The flowers turn a creamy yellow color and do not develop correctly. This can be treated similarly to [Botrytis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botryotinia)—eliminating the conditions that caused the disease and burning the infected plants are among recommended actions.[\\[65\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-pest4-65)\n* [Aphids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphids) are a small insect. Five species of aphids commonly attack apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid, and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can be identified by color, time of year, and by differences in the cornicles (small paired projections from their rear).[\\[65\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-pest4-65) Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.[\\[66\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-pest5-66)\n* [Apple scab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_scab): Apple scab causes leaves to develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit, which also develops similar brown spots with velvety or cork-like textures. Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple leaves on the ground and spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth.[\\[67\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-Bradley-67)\n\nAmong the most serious disease problems are a bacterial disease called [fireblight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireblight), and two fungal diseases: *[Gymnosporangium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnosporangium)* rust and [black spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spot_(disease)).[\\[66\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-pest5-66) Other pests that affect apple trees include [Codling moths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codling_moth) and [apple maggots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_maggot).

Many areas in the former foreign concessions are also well-preserved, the most notable being the French Concession.\\[74\\] Shanghai is also home to many architecturally distinctive and even eccentric buildings, including the Shanghai Museum, the Shanghai Grand Theatre, the Shanghai Oriental Art Center, and the Oriental Pearl Tower. Despite rampant redevelopment, the Old City still retains some traditional architecture and designs, such as the Yu Garden, an elaborate Jiangnan style garden.\\[75\\]\n\n### As a result of its construction boom during the 1920s and 1930s, Shanghai has among the most Art Deco buildings in the world.\\[74\\] One of the most famous architects working in Shanghai was László Hudec, a Hungarian-Slovak who lived in the city between 1918 and 1947.\\[76\\] His most notable Art Deco buildings include the Park Hotel, the Grand Cinema, and the Paramount.\\[77\\] Other prominent architects who contributed to the Art Deco style are Clement Palmer and Arthur Turner, who together designed the Peace Hotel, the Metropole Hotel, and the Broadway Mansions;\\[78\\] and Austrian architect C.H. Gonda, who designed the Capitol Theatre. The Bund has been revitalized several times. The first was in 1986, with a new promenade by the Dutch architect Paulus Snoeren.\\[79\\] The second was before the 2010 Expo, which includes restoration of the century-old Waibaidu Bridge and reconfiguration of traffic flow.\\[80\\]\n\n### Site of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, a typical shikumen building in the former French Concession\n\n### One distinctive cultural element is the shikumen (石库门, \"stone storage door\") residence, typically two- or three-story gray brick houses with the front yard protected by a heavy wooden door in a stylistic stone arch.\\[81\\] Each residence is connected and arranged in straight alleys, known as longtang\\[f\\] (弄堂). The house is similar to western-style terrace houses or townhouses, but distinguishes by the tall, heavy brick wall and archway in front of each house.\\[83\\]\n\n### The shikumen is a cultural blend of elements found in Western architecture with traditional Jiangnan Chinese architecture and social behavior.\\[81\\] Like almost all traditional Chinese dwellings, it has a courtyard, which reduces outside noise. Vegetation can be grown in the courtyard, and it can also allow for sunlight and ventilation to the rooms.\\[84\\]\n\n### Shanghai World Financial Center (left) and Jin Mao Tower (right)\n\n### Some of Shanghai's buildings feature Soviet neoclassical architecture or Stalinist architecture, though the city has fewer such structures than Beijing. These buildings were mostly erected between the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 and the Sino-Soviet Split in the late 1960s. During this time period, large numbers of Soviet experts, including architects, poured into China to aid the country in the construction of a communist state. An example of Soviet neoclassical architecture in Shanghai is the modern-day Shanghai Exhibition Center.\\[85\\]\n\n### Shanghai—Lujiazui in particular—has numerous skyscrapers, making it the fifth city in the world with the most skyscrapers.\\[86\\] Among the most prominent examples are the 421 m (1,381 ft) high Jin Mao Tower, the 492 m (1,614 ft) high Shanghai World Financial Center, and the 632 m (2,073 ft) high Shanghai Tower, which is the tallest building in China and the second tallest in the world.\\[87\\] Completed in 2015, the tower takes the form of nine twisted sections stacked atop each other, totaling 128 floors.\\[88\\] It is featured in its double-skin facade design, which eliminates the need for either layer to be opaqued for reflectivity as the double-layer structure has already reduced the heat absorption.\\[89\\] The futuristic-looking Oriental Pearl Tower, at 468 m (1,535 ft), is located nearby at the northern tip of Lujiazui.\\[90\\] Skyscrapers outside of Lujiazui include the White Magnolia Plaza in Hongkou, the Shimao International Plaza in Huangpu, and the Shanghai Wheelock Square in Jing'an.", "timestamp": 1635479436, "digest": "WXRxOwvkbCNoDMKVLWNLVMw6TmbYWYXinBARaIKhSkY", "contributor": "0x34de2a6645A4339f4b1Cba1b2A1BEe0818A5FCEe"}

As such it’s not very usable, you need UI to interact with the contract conveniently. As such there is a Mango partnered instance of frontend, but anyone could build one (cf [Squads](https://squads.medium.com/))\n\n* a back-office web app to create and manage DAO called [Oyster]() on GH, the [UI looks like this](). \n* a use-facing web app to allow access for voting and seeing governance proposals, called [governance-ui]() on GH, the [UI looks like this](). It has been built w/ Mango Market people, that’s the Mango DAO we know.\n\nThe back office does not allow the creation of DAO by anyone right now, but I imagine they have a tiny vetting process as to who can interact and getting in touch with them should allow a “listing”.\n\n## The Governance Primitive on Solana\n\nBelow is the diagram of the governance program. I’ll go through the documentation and add some comments. This is a personal notes kind of document.\n\n![OCD level 120% at all the non-straight boxes and arrows](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GgoZbyTtxztDLkSE_hV2d.png?height=1451&width=1304)\n\n## Realm Account - The top level organisation\n\n> **Realm account** ties Community Token Mint and optional Council Token mint to create a realm for any governance pertaining to the community of the token holders. For example a trading protocol can issue a governance token and use it to create its governance realm.\n\nThis is a top level thing that is like an internal DAO for the team, it can use the governance token, or a separate TeamGovernance token. I think using the governance one is fine, if there is a way to time lock it.\n\nIt represents the organisation, and from this you derive new `ProgramGovernance` instances, each of them managing ONE and only program.\n\n## Governance Accounts - The controllers\n\n### Program Governance Account - Program\n\n> The basic building block of governance to update programs is the ProgramGovernance account. It ties a governed Program ID and holds configuration options defining governance rules. The governed Program ID is used as the seed for a [Program Derived Address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses), and this program derived address is what is used as the address of the Governance account for your Program ID.\n>\n> What this means is that there can only ever be ONE Governance account for a given Program. The governance program validates at creation time of the Governance account that the current upgrade authority of the program taken under governance signed the transaction. Optionally `CreateProgramGovernance` instruction can also transfer `upgrade_authority` of the governed program to the Governance PDA at the creation time of the Governance account.\n\nYou deploy your program, and then transfer the authority to the governance account. (?)\n\nThis then provide an API for upgrades.\n\n*I wonder how the upgrade goes, what are the limitations like update size if it needs to fits CPI calls?*\n\n### Mint Governance account - Mint \n\n> A mint governance account allows a mint authority to setup governance over an SPL Mint account. The Governance program validates at creation time that the current mint authority signed the transaction to create the governance and optionally can transfer the authority to the Governance account. Once setup the Mint Governance allows governance participants to create Proposals which execute mint instructions for the governed Mint.\n\nSimilar logic as the Program Governance Account above, except the API is tailor to cater for Minting needs.\n\n### Token Governance account - SPL Token Account (wallet)\n\n> A token governance account allows a token account owner to setup governance over an SPL Token account. The Governance program validates at creation time the current owner signed the transaction to create the governance and optionally can transfer the owner to the Governance account. Once setup the Token Governance allows participants to create Proposals to execute transfer instructions from the governed token account.\n\nSimilar to the PGA and MGA above, except it’s a SPL wallet API this time.\n\n## Authority\n\n### Proposal accounts\n\n> A Proposal is an instance of a Governance created to vote on and execute given set of instructions. It is created by someone (Proposal Owner) and tied to a given Governance account and has a set of executable instructions to it, a name and a description. It goes through various states (draft, voting, executing, ...) and users can vote on it if they have relevant Community or Council tokens. Its rules are determined by the Governance account that it is tied to, and when it executes, it is only eligible to use the [Program Derived Address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses) authority given by the Governance account. So a Proposal for Sushi cannot for instance upgrade the Program for Uniswap.\n\nThis is the actual Proposal submitted to the public for voting. But before it goes live… ⤵️\n\n> When a Proposal is created by a user then the user becomes Proposal Owner and receives permission to edit the Proposal. With this power the Owner can edit the Proposal, add/remove Signatories to the Proposal and also cancel it. These Signatories can then show their approval of the Proposal by signing it off. Once all Signatories have signed off the Proposal the Proposal leaves Draft state and enters Voting state. Voting state lasts as long as the Governance has it configured to last, and during this time people holding Community (or Council) tokens may vote on the Proposal. Once the Proposal is \"tipped\" it either enters the Defeated or Succeeded state. If the vote can't be tipped automatically during the voting period but still reaches the required Yes vote threshold it can be manually transitioned to Succeeded state using FinalizeVote instruction. Once all Proposal instructions are executed the Proposal enters Completed state.\n\nThis explain the several stages of a proposal, it’s to prevent indirect rugs like team member X votes to transfer all the treasury to his wallet with lowest treshold and vote himself.\n\n> In the Executing state an instruction can be run by any one at any time after the `instruction_hold_up_time` period has transpired\n\nThis is for time-lock and vesting, nice.\n\n_____ \n  \n TL:DR; for the last bits is that a `ProposalAccount` can have several `ProposalInstructions`, the actual pieces of work (send X tokens to Billy - Update the program with his patch). If that interest you I think you’ll go in [the doc]() and check the voting dynamic that I haven’t mentioned here. All what I talked about is from there anyway. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/06rBmfJZt-Fh0Enc8H2W5.png?height=1490&width=1775)\n\n## Respect my authority, how does it all come together\n\nSo usually, a team would have control over the Program deployment, Minting of its IDO’d {gov/shit}coins, and control the wallet(s) (IDO profits, fees, community…).\n\nThis is a big responsibility, because upgrading the program on Solana means changing its behaviour silently. Any project with control of the Program Deployment can just send an TX to suck your NFT the next time you transact without doing a forensic analysis of the TX prompt if they want, and the confirmation UI/UX is not always super clear (quite good on Phantom now though)\n\nI won’t speak about Mint and Wallet unilateral control, which is straight forward about the involved risks.\n\n_____\n\nTo overcome that, the governance above is a great tool, the important bit being :\n\n> Governance can handle arbitrary executions of code.\n\nIn the example above, let’s say the team delegates Program Deployment, Mint and Wallets to the DAO. Then is mean that the only way they have to interact with these is to to submit proposals and get them approved.\n\nLet’s say they want to pay a bug bounty, then they craft the TX with the amount and in/outs, then send it to the `TokenGovernanceAccount` (not sure about the exact flow but you get the idea) and it will be there waiting to reach a treshold of vote or the timeout for the program to decide wether it should pass (be signed by it's Authority) or be rejected.\n\nGov token holder go on the aforementioned UI and vote with their stake. On given proposals.\n\n______\n\nIt’s an indirection layer that prevents bamboozles, with supplementary indirection-ception. \n\nIt can feel a bit useless, as usually the teams/investors/whales own a large chunk of the tokens, and could band up to do bad things? But it’s what a governance is, people who have stake decides. That’s the base rule.\n\nWhat’s valuable here is that least we got it fully transparent and immuable, thanks to the blockchain™️.

The English scholar [H. R.

She points out that buckets of apples were found in the [Oseberg ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseberg_ship) burial site in Norway, that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in *[Skáldskaparmál](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sk%C3%A1ldskaparm%C3%A1l)*) have been found in the early graves of the [Germanic peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples) in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of [fertility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility) in southwest England.[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-autogenerated1-28)\n\nDavidson notes a connection between apples and the [Vanir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanir), a tribe of gods associated with [fertility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility) in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven \"golden apples\" being given to woo the beautiful [Gerðr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ger%C3%B0r) by [Skírnir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sk%C3%ADrnir), who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god [Freyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freyr) in stanzas 19 and 20 of *[Skírnismál](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sk%C3%ADrnism%C3%A1l)*. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the *[Völsunga saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lsunga_saga)*: when the major goddess [Frigg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigg) sends King [Rerir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rerir) an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a [mound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumulus).[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-DAVIDSON165-166-29) Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the birth (by [Caesarean section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section)) of their son—the hero [Völsung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lsung).[\\[30\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#cite_note-DAVIDSONROLES146-147-30)\n\nFurther, Davidson points out the \"strange\" phrase \"Apples of [Hel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hel_(location))\" used in an 11th-century poem by the [skald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skald) Thorbiorn Brúnarson.

Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess [Nehalennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalennia) is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire) and came to Europe from the [Near East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_East), the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter.

This has also caused the city to experience population aging—in 2017, 33.1% (4.8 million) of the city's registered population was aged 60 or above.\\[161\\] In 2017, the Chinese government implemented population controls for Shanghai, resulting in a population decline of 10,000 people by the end of the year.\\[162\\]\n\n### Religion\n\n### Main article on Chinese Wikipedia: 上海宗教\n\n### See also: Religion in China\n\n### The golden pagoda of Jing'an Temple\n\n### Due to its cosmopolitan history, Shanghai has a blend of religious heritage; religious buildings and institutions are scattered around the city. According to a 2012 survey, only 13.1% of the city's population belongs to organized religions, including Buddhists with 10.4%, Protestants with 1.9%, Catholics with 0.7%, and other faiths with 0.1% while the remaining 86.9% of the population could be either atheists or involved in worship of nature deities and ancestors or folk religious sects.\\[163\\]\n\n### Buddhism, in its Chinese varieties, has had a presence in Shanghai since the Three Kingdoms period, during which the Longhua Temple—the largest temple in Shanghai—and the Jing'an Temple were founded.\\[164\\] Another significant temple is the Jade Buddha Temple, which was named after a large statue of Buddha carved out of jade in the temple.\\[165\\] As of 2014, Buddhism in Shanghai had 114 temples, 1,182 clergical staff, and 453,300 registered followers.\\[164\\] The religion also has its own college, the Shanghai Buddhist College \\[zh\\], and its own press, Shanghai Buddhological Press \\[zh\\].\\[166\\]\n\n### The St. Ignatius Cathedral\n\n### Catholicism was brought into Shanghai in 1608 by Italian missionary Lazzaro Cattaneo.\\[167\\] The Apostolic Vicariate of Shanghai was erected in 1933, and was further elevated to the Diocese of Shanghai in 1946.\\[168\\] Notable Catholic sites include the St. Ignatius Cathedral in Xujiahui—the largest Catholic church in the city,\\[169\\] the St. Francis Xavier Church, and the She Shan Basilica.\\[170\\] Other forms of Christianity in Shanghai include Eastern Orthodox minorities and, since 1996, registered Christian Protestant churches.\n\n### Although currently making up a fraction of the religious population in Shanghai, Jewish people have played an influential role in the city’s history. After the Treaty of Nanking ended the First Opium War in 1842, the city was opened up to western populations and merchants traveled to Shanghai for its rich business potential, including many prominent Jewish families. The Sassoons amassed great wealth in the opium and textile trades, cementing their status by funding many of the buildings that have become iconic in Shanghai's skyline, such as the Cathay Hotel in 1929.\\[171\\] The Hardoons were another prominent Baghdadi Jewish family that used their business success to define Shanghai in the 20th century. The head of the family Silas Hardoon, who was one of the richest people in the world during the 1800s, financed Nanjing Road, which then housed department stores in the International Settlement but now is one of the busiest shopping centers in the world. During World War II, thousands of Jews emigrated to Shanghai in an effort to flee Nazi Germany. They lived in a designated area called the Shanghai Ghetto and formed a community centered on the Ohel Moishe Synagogue, which is now the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum.\\[172\\] In 1939, Horace Kadoorie, the head of the powerful philanthropic Sephardic Jewish family in Shanghai, founded the Shanghai Jewish Youth Association to support Jewish refugees through English education so they would be prepared to emigrate from Shanghai when the time came.\\[173\\]\n\n### Islam came into Shanghai during the Yuan dynasty. The city's first mosque, Songjiang Mosque, was built during the Zhizheng (至正) era under Emperor Huizong. Shanghai's Muslim population increased in the 19th and early 20th centuries (when the city was a treaty port), during which time many mosques—including the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque, the Huxi Mosque, and the Pudong Mosque—were built. The Shanghai Islamic Association is located in the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque in Huangpu.\\[174\\]\n\n### Shanghai has several folk religious temples, including the City God Temple at the heart of the Old City, the Dajing Ge Pavilion dedicated to the Three Kingdoms general Guan Yu, the Confucian Temple of Shanghai, and a major Taoist center Shanghai White Cloud Temple \\[zh\\] where the Shanghai Taoist Association locates.\\[175\\]\n\n### Language\n\n### Main article: Shanghainese\n\n### Ability to speak the following dialects/languages in Shanghai (2013)\\[176\\]Languages%Can SpeakMandarin 97.0%Shanghainese 81.4%English 47.5%Other Chinese 29.7%Other foreign languages 7.8%Sampled among residents ≥ 13 years old.\n\n### The vernacular language spoken in the city is Shanghainese, a dialect of the Taihu Wu subgroup of the Wu Chinese family. This is different from the official Chinese dialect, Mandarin, which is mutually unintelligible with Wu Chinese.\\[177\\] Modern Shanghainese is based on other dialects of Taihu Wu: Suzhounese, Ningbonese, and the local dialect of Songjiang Prefecture.\\[178\\]\n\n### Prior to its expansion, the language spoken in Shanghai was subordinate to those spoken around Jiaxing and later Suzhou,\\[178\\] and was known as \"the local tongue\" (本地闲话), which is now being used in suburbs only.\\[179\\] In the late 19th century, downtown Shanghainese (上海闲话) appeared, undergoing rapid changes and quickly replacing Suzhounese as the prestige dialect of the Yangtze River Delta region. At the time, most of the city's residents were immigrants from the two adjacent provinces, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, so Shanghainese was mostly a hybrid between Southern Jiangsu and Ningbo dialects. After 1949, Putonghua (Standard Mandarin) has also had a great impact on Shanghainese as a result of being rigorously promoted by the government.\\[178\\] Since the 1990s, many migrants outside of the Wu-speaking region have come to Shanghai for education and jobs. They often cannot speak the local language and therefore use Putonghua as a lingua franca. Because Putonghua and English were more favored, Shanghainese began to decline, and fluency among young speakers weakened. In recent years, there have been movements within the city to promote the local language and protect it from fading out.\\[180\\]\\[181\\]", "timestamp": 1635479540, "digest": "C6rBe7gTm72tktQFiGL3aXL8rU_oEJK1GoXvoet2stc", "contributor": "0x34de2a6645A4339f4b1Cba1b2A1BEe0818A5FCEe"}

Newbies and casuals alike will appreciate the intuitive technologies such as the “1-Click Swap”, while traders will value the high-level security features with a dedicated [token standard](https://callisto.network/erc223-token-standard/) and a safelist for audited and insured tokens.\n\nUsers get rewarded by holding and farming their SOY tokens and **receive up to 20% **of the total trading fees and **newly minted SOY tokens **as described in the[ monetary policy](https://soy-finance.medium.com/soy-finance-monetary-policy-vision-4f07a1b48372).\n\n## How To Enter The SOY Tokens Airdrop?\n\n**Airdrop Eligibility Rules**\n\nThe second phase of the SOY Token Airdrop is specifically for Sushiswap users. Therefore, to take part in this phase it is necessary to be a Sushiswap active user between 1/11/21 and 15/11/21.\n\nAs **active users** are considered those who perform at least **one **of the following actions:\n\n*   Trade/swap any asset on Sushiswap using Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain networks.\n*   Add/remove any asset’s liquidity on Sushiswap, using Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain networks.\n\n**The list with the eligible users will be updated daily at 00:00 UTC.**\n\n## **How To Claim My SOY Tokens?**\n\nTo claim your tokens, simply go to <https://soy.finance/airdrop> and connect your wallet.\n\nOnce connected, the system automatically checks your eligibility for the airdrop, and if you meet the requirements, your tokens will be displayed in your balance.\n\n***Note:***\n\n*   *As the user activity status is updated every day at 00:00 UTC, we recommend claiming the tokens after 24 hours of your activity on Sushiswap.*\n*   *A user is allowed to claim once per airdrop phase.*\n\n## When Will I Receive My Tokens\n\nSOY tokens are locked for 180 days from the claiming date. At the end of the lock-in period, the tokens will be automatically sent to the wallet that was used to claim them.\n\n## How Many Tokens Will I Receive?\n\nThe Airdrop pool for the first phase is 500 000 SOY tokens.\n\nEach day, 1/15 of the total pool (33 333 SOY tokens) is divided among the eligible participants, each participant receiving an equal share.\n\nBy airdropping 10% of the initial supply in seven phases, 12 million tokens in total, Soy token’s monetary policy aims to distribute the SOY tokens in a fair manner and increase the platform’s decentralization to the highest extent.\n\nThe details of the next Airdrop phase will be announced on 10/11/21.\n\nFor more information please refer to the [SOY Tokenomics.](https://soy.finance/tokenomic)\n", "timestamp": 1635481049, "digest": "EpOpsh0rIJKl0jMIEDEc1hNO0AjhvHRHbhIPhRPMlRk", "contributor": "0xCd37D23fb161f96EFEf5f7463abAf5b63169CAA4"}

The more I read it the more I am fascinated and the more curious I am becoming. To manifest this curiosity today we will discuss Fantom & FTM tokens.\n\n**We will cover the following topics in the journey going forward:**\n\n*   *What Is Fantom & Why we should care about the same?*\n*   *What Is the underlying tech?*\n*   *How do Fantom works?*\n*   *Fantome use cases?*\n*   *What are some of the prominent projects hosted on the Fantom platform?*\n*   *Fantom Fundamentals & Tokenomics*\n*   *Summary & Way Forward*\n\n## **What Is Fantom & Why we should care about the same?**\n\nIt is like a single platform that caters to multiple blockchain use cases and solutions. It boasts itself to:\n\n> “Be fast, highly perfromant & an open-source smart contract technology that can host multiple digital assets and Dapps”\n\n## What Is Fantom?\n\nFantom is a high-performance, scalable, secure & directed acyclic graph ([DAG](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/directed-acyclic-graph-dag)) smart contract platform, designed to overcome the limitations of old-generation blockchain platforms.\n\n*Fantom makes use of ****Lachesis****, a revolutionary & bespoke**** aBFT consensus mechanism,**** that enables Fantom to be much faster and cheaper than older technologies.*\n\nNow that we have defined Fantom, it is imperative to understand: Why do we need fantom & What makes it special?\n\n## Why Fantom?\n\nOur Topmost crypto project the **Bitcoin** has not been built to scale and its proof-of-work consensus algorithm is limited by design, to support decentralization and security, thereby sacrificing speed\n\nThere is a popular term called **blockchain trilemma**, which speaks about the trade-off between scalability, security & decentralization. it says that it is impossible to attain all these three attributes together.\n\n> Bitcoin's main focus area is on decentralization and security by choice, thereby compromising the speed when it comes to transactions, so it is not naturally suited for day-to-day payments, data transfer, asset trading, or other transactions consumers and businesses rely on in everyday life.\n\nBut our modern-day blockchain platforms are looking to solve this blockchain trilemma, and fantom is one such platform, where the idea is to respect the decentralization by design and enabling bank-grade security, supporting the fast settlement of transactions.\n\nIn a nutshell Fantom :\n\n*Fantom’s ****aBFT**** consensus protocol delivers unparalleled*\n\n*   *Speed*\n*   *Security and*\n*   *Scalability.*\n\n## *Speed:*\n\nWhen it comes to speed, fantom relies on **its high-speed consensus mechanism, Lachesis, which facilitates the tokens or digital assets to function at **unprecedented speed\n\n## Security:\n\nFantom also offers exceptionally high levels of security by using a [**leaderless Proof-of-Stake**](https://fantom.foundation/ftm-staking/) protocol to secure the network. Unlike many other existing projects, Fantom does not sacrifice security and decentralization in favor of scalability.\n\n## Decentralization: (Lies at its core )\n\nThe **Lachies:aBFT()** consensus, **algo**, is capable of scaling to multiple nodes distributed across the globe in a permissionless, open environment, providing a good degree of decentralization.\n\n**What Is Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT):**\n\n> Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance is the highest standard of consensus algorithms. It solves the blockchain Scalability Trilemma, according to which only two of the following three components are possible at the same time: that is Decentralization,Security & Scalability\n\nSo if you are looking to have a platform that solves the blockchain trilemma issues, then yes, Fantom can be your true mate.\n\nNow that we have understood what & why of Fantom blockchain, its time to deep dive and understand how does it really achieve the three attribute we discussed above and **how does it actually works?**\n\n## How Does Fantom Works?\n\nAs we discussed, Fantom is a one-stop solution that ticks all the required attributes of **decentralization, security & scalability** which helps it to differentiate among other competing blockchain platforms like **Solana, ETH 2.0, Cardano, etc.**\n\nSo its functionality can be understood around these 4 core key pillars\n\n*   ***Modularity***\n*   ***Scalability***\n*   ***Security***\n*   ***Open-source***\n\n**Let’s decode all these concepts one by one;**\n\n## Modularity:\n\nAny tech product to scale requires it to be strongly decoupled and follow modularity as a design principle. Fantom has adopted this principle of modularity, which is enabled by **Lachesis, which is a modular consensus blockchain layer being used by Fantom. This layer is completely decoupled and flexible to be **plugged into any distributed ledger.\n\n> This Fantom’s modular allows Developers to port their existing Ethereum-based Decentralized apps on Fantom Opera mainnet in a matter of minutes, substantially upgrading the performance and lowering the costs.\n\n**What is Fantom Opera mainnet?**\n\nIt is the secure and fast environment that allows developers to build decentralized applications on top of it. It is fully permissionless and open-source. Powered by Fantom’s [aBFT consensus algorithm](https://fantom.foundation/lachesis-consensus-algorithm/).\n\n*It is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and provides full smart contracts support through Solidity.*\n\n## **Scalability:**\n\nFantome ensures that each of the blockchain-powered networks is working independently of each other, which helps to scale these networks for performance independently without being too much worried about the congestion.\n\n> Network congestion has been the biggest reason why Ethereum is not able to scale which leads to high Gas fee for any transactrion which happens on its Ethereum 1.0 platform currenlty. Now the ETH 2.0 is being revamped to overcome this issue of scalability, which is in-bult already in Fantom\n\nDapps hosted on Ethereum are affected by slow network speed and high gas fees, Fantom solves this scalability issue by giving each Dapps its own independent blockchain, which is like each app has got its own individual computers which happen to be an integral part of the same network.\n\nThis modularity and independent network layer make the Dapps lying on the fantom platform have their own custom tokens, tokenomics, and governance protocols. All of these apps networks are interconnected into **Lachesis**, Fantom’s uber-fast **aBFT** consensus, helping each of those apps to benefit from the speed and security of the underlying technology.\n\n## To sum-up,\n\n> Fantom is a network of potentially infinite number of decentralized computers(networks), that even though share the same software logic, behave completely completely independent from one another.\n\n## Security: Proof-of-Stake Security mechanism:\n\nThere has been quite a big debate and fuss around Bitcoin’s so-called energy-intensive mining. This is largely due to its underlying Proof-Of-Work mechanism to validate and approve any transactions. Fantom unlike bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0 PoW, relies on PoS consensus mechanism, so we can consider fantom to be environment-friendly in its approach of securing the transactions happening over its network.\n\nLachesis follows **leaderless Proof-of-stake consensus** that ensures a higher level of security, by removing any trusted leaders.\n\n**What Is Leaderless Proof-of-Stake?**\n\nFantom opera mainnet behaves differently when it comes to validating the transaction using PoS, Unlike some other traditional Proof-of-Stake systems, where some validators have a say on the validity of the transactions, opera mainnet is completely leaderless thereby removing any chance for the set of validators to have a significant say.\n\n> Removing leaders increases network security substantially.\n\n## Fantom is completely Open-sourced and community-driven:\n\nLike most of the blockchain platforms Fantom too is open-source, they envision creating modular building blocks for anyone to use and customize to their needs.\n\nYou can contribute and adapt their tech by visiting their Github account to access their code here:\n\nAlso, Fantom being permissionless, allows anyone to become a validator by running their [node](https://fantom.foundation/how-to-set-up-a-fantom-validator/).\n\n## As per their official doc,\n\n*On Fantom’s Opera Chain, a virtually unlimited number of validator nodes can participate in securing the network, as long as they keep a minimum of 3,175,000 *[*FTM*](https://fantom.foundation/ftm-token/)* at stake. ****FTM**** is their native token which can be traded over centralized exchanges and only Defi platforms.*\n\nYou can also become a delegator if you don’t have the required FTM token to the stake, you just need 1 FTM to do so.\n\nEnough of the tech discussion, for now, it's time to move forward and see what are some of the popular Defi, Dapps projects are leveraging Fantom to power themselves.\n\n## What Projects Are Leveraging Fantom?\n\n[**Travala**](https://www.travala.com/)**:** Blockchain-based travel booking platform\n\nTravala is leveraging Fantom’s blockchain platform to help travel freaks book over 3,000,000 travel products worldwide, including hotels, homes, flights, tours, and activities, this will be a huge boost to Fantom’s adoption.\n\n[**DABS**](https://main.dabs.af/).

The more I read it the more I am fascinated and the more curious I am becoming. To manifest this curiosity today we will discuss Fantom & FTM tokens.\n\n**We will cover the following topics in the journey going forward:**\n\n*   *What Is Fantom & Why we should care about the same?*\n*   *What Is the underlying tech?*\n*   *How do Fantom works?*\n*   *Fantome use cases?*\n*   *What are some of the prominent projects hosted on the Fantom platform?*\n*   *Fantom Fundamentals & Tokenomics*\n*   *Summary & Way Forward*\n\n## **What Is Fantom & Why we should care about the same?**\n\nIt is like a single platform that caters to multiple blockchain use cases and solutions. It boasts itself to:\n\n> “Be fast, highly perfromant & an open-source smart contract technology that can host multiple digital assets and Dapps”\n\n## What Is Fantom?\n\nFantom is a high-performance, scalable, secure & directed acyclic graph ([DAG](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/directed-acyclic-graph-dag)) smart contract platform, designed to overcome the limitations of old-generation blockchain platforms.\n\n*Fantom makes use of ****Lachesis****, a revolutionary & bespoke**** aBFT consensus mechanism,**** that enables Fantom to be much faster and cheaper than older technologies.*\n\nNow that we have defined Fantom, it is imperative to understand: Why do we need fantom & What makes it special?\n\n## Why Fantom?\n\nOur Topmost crypto project the **Bitcoin** has not been built to scale and its proof-of-work consensus algorithm is limited by design, to support decentralization and security, thereby sacrificing speed\n\nThere is a popular term called **blockchain trilemma**, which speaks about the trade-off between scalability, security & decentralization. it says that it is impossible to attain all these three attributes together.\n\n> Bitcoin's main focus area is on decentralization and security by choice, thereby compromising the speed when it comes to transactions, so it is not naturally suited for day-to-day payments, data transfer, asset trading, or other transactions consumers and businesses rely on in everyday life.\n\nBut our modern-day blockchain platforms are looking to solve this blockchain trilemma, and fantom is one such platform, where the idea is to respect the decentralization by design and enabling bank-grade security, supporting the fast settlement of transactions.\n\nIn a nutshell Fantom :\n\n*Fantom’s ****aBFT**** consensus protocol delivers unparalleled*\n\n*   *Speed*\n*   *Security and*\n*   *Scalability.*\n\n## *Speed:*\n\nWhen it comes to speed, fantom relies on **its high-speed consensus mechanism, Lachesis, which facilitates the tokens or digital assets to function at **unprecedented speed\n\n## Security:\n\nFantom also offers exceptionally high levels of security by using a [**leaderless Proof-of-Stake**](https://fantom.foundation/ftm-staking/) protocol to secure the network. Unlike many other existing projects, Fantom does not sacrifice security and decentralization in favor of scalability.\n\n## Decentralization: (Lies at its core )\n\nThe **Lachies:aBFT()** consensus, **algo**, is capable of scaling to multiple nodes distributed across the globe in a permissionless, open environment, providing a good degree of decentralization.\n\n**What Is Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT):**\n\n> Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance is the highest standard of consensus algorithms. It solves the blockchain Scalability Trilemma, according to which only two of the following three components are possible at the same time: that is Decentralization,Security & Scalability\n\nSo if you are looking to have a platform that solves the blockchain trilemma issues, then yes, Fantom can be your true mate.\n\nNow that we have understood what & why of Fantom blockchain, its time to deep dive and understand how does it really achieve the three attribute we discussed above and **how does it actually works?**\n\n## How Does Fantom Works?\n\nAs we discussed, Fantom is a one-stop solution that ticks all the required attributes of **decentralization, security & scalability** which helps it to differentiate among other competing blockchain platforms like **Solana, ETH 2.0, Cardano, etc.**\n\nSo its functionality can be understood around these 4 core key pillars\n\n*   ***Modularity***\n*   ***Scalability***\n*   ***Security***\n*   ***Open-source***\n\n**Let’s decode all these concepts one by one;**\n\n## Modularity:\n\nAny tech product to scale requires it to be strongly decoupled and follow modularity as a design principle. Fantom has adopted this principle of modularity, which is enabled by **Lachesis, which is a modular consensus blockchain layer being used by Fantom. This layer is completely decoupled and flexible to be **plugged into any distributed ledger.\n\n> This Fantom’s modular allows Developers to port their existing Ethereum-based Decentralized apps on Fantom Opera mainnet in a matter of minutes, substantially upgrading the performance and lowering the costs.\n\n**What is Fantom Opera mainnet?**\n\nIt is the secure and fast environment that allows developers to build decentralized applications on top of it.

And it’s that first step that encourages you to go further down the rabbit hole. You can worry about the best hardware and the energy costs once you become more knowledgeable.\n\nAfter exploring some of the “best” Ethereum mining options, I found that they all ran into issues related to hardware or configuration. Not to mention the installation process involves much more than double-clicking on an executable.\n\nCommand-line parameters anyone?\n\nAll that difficulty allowed me to immediately see the ease of the next application -- [BetterHash](https://www.betterhash.net/?ref=122040).\n\nRead on for a quick rundown of the installation (on a Windows machine) and how to get up and running. I think you’ll agree that it’s easy peasy.\n\nOn the application was installed via the executable, the first step is to allow all the benchmarks to run. This process might take a while but it helps identify the best method for all available mining hardware (this info is also used for a cool feature called “profit switching”).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*8vN_BEMtXLLtvyaRWHbS2w.png)\n\nThe dropdowns will list all compatible miners and the app will select the “best” one by default.\n\nOnce the benchmarks are done, you’re pretty much ready to start mining! Click start and let the app handle the rest. In a few minutes you’ll see your projected earnings based on the app’s calculations.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*D7NZZW7UxX1y9KJ8zLmK8Q.png)\n\nIn conclusion, $34/month may or may not be worth it based on your situation. For example, it may not be worth it to buy an expensive computer in order to mine. But if you already have a relatively decent computer, might as well see what it can do! I also see mining as a way to essentially dollar-cost-average into Bitcoin via your electric bill.\n\nLet me know if this post was helpful and how it works out for you if you give it a try!\n\nAlso, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xandreharrison) to keep up with all that’s going on in the crypto space!", "timestamp": 1635481957, "digest": "_FmJ5-Mnvd3nGIxfPSRU-ddXdy5UDoOSE84Jv4wuMxE", "contributor": "0x7880De831652e93743fF63D70B25F4Fa96DdD6a9"}

Why It Can Be A Dark Horse?", "body": "## What Is Fantom crypto & How Does Fantom Works?\n\n[![@pramodAIML](https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1\\*zryGf1eG5UE_y72ZO7UjJw.png)](https://pramodaiml.medium.com/?source=post_page-----67be22a51254--------------------------------)\n\nThe real beauty of blockchain lies in the way their smart contracts are being used to build more advanced, secure, and reliable Decentralized apps & financial solutions. The more I read it the more I am fascinated and the more curious I am becoming. To manifest this curiosity today we will discuss Fantom & FTM tokens.\n\n**We will cover the following topics in the journey going forward:**\n\n*   *What Is Fantom & Why we should care about the same?*\n*   *What Is the underlying tech?*\n*   *How do Fantom works?*\n*   *Fantome use cases?*\n*   *What are some of the prominent projects hosted on the Fantom platform?*\n*   *Fantom Fundamentals & Tokenomics*\n*   *Summary & Way Forward*\n\n## **What Is Fantom & Why we should care about the same?**\n\nIt is like a single platform that caters to multiple blockchain use cases and solutions. It boasts itself to:\n\n> “Be fast, highly perfromant & an open-source smart contract technology that can host multiple digital assets and Dapps”\n\n## What Is Fantom?\n\nFantom is a high-performance, scalable, secure & directed acyclic graph ([DAG](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/directed-acyclic-graph-dag)) smart contract platform, designed to overcome the limitations of old-generation blockchain platforms.\n\n*Fantom makes use of ****Lachesis****, a revolutionary & bespoke**** aBFT consensus mechanism,**** that enables Fantom to be much faster and cheaper than older technologies.*\n\nNow that we have defined Fantom, it is imperative to understand: Why do we need fantom & What makes it special?\n\n## Why Fantom?\n\nOur Topmost crypto project the **Bitcoin** has not been built to scale and its proof-of-work consensus algorithm is limited by design, to support decentralization and security, thereby sacrificing speed\n\nThere is a popular term called **blockchain trilemma**, which speaks about the trade-off between scalability, security & decentralization. it says that it is impossible to attain all these three attributes together.\n\n> Bitcoin's main focus area is on decentralization and security by choice, thereby compromising the speed when it comes to transactions, so it is not naturally suited for day-to-day payments, data transfer, asset trading, or other transactions consumers and businesses rely on in everyday life.\n\nBut our modern-day blockchain platforms are looking to solve this blockchain trilemma, and fantom is one such platform, where the idea is to respect the decentralization by design and enabling bank-grade security, supporting the fast settlement of transactions.\n\nIn a nutshell Fantom :\n\n*Fantom’s ****aBFT**** consensus protocol delivers unparalleled*\n\n*   *Speed*\n*   *Security and*\n*   *Scalability.*\n\n## *Speed:*\n\nWhen it comes to speed, fantom relies on **its high-speed consensus mechanism, Lachesis, which facilitates the tokens or digital assets to function at **unprecedented speed\n\n## Security:\n\nFantom also offers exceptionally high levels of security by using a [**leaderless Proof-of-Stake**](https://fantom.foundation/ftm-staking/) protocol to secure the network. Unlike many other existing projects, Fantom does not sacrifice security and decentralization in favor of scalability.\n\n## Decentralization: (Lies at its core )\n\nThe **Lachies:aBFT()** consensus, **algo**, is capable of scaling to multiple nodes distributed across the globe in a permissionless, open environment, providing a good degree of decentralization.\n\n**What Is Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT):**\n\n> Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance is the highest standard of consensus algorithms. It solves the blockchain Scalability Trilemma, according to which only two of the following three components are possible at the same time: that is Decentralization,Security & Scalability\n\nSo if you are looking to have a platform that solves the blockchain trilemma issues, then yes, Fantom can be your true mate.\n\nNow that we have understood what & why of Fantom blockchain, its time to deep dive and understand how does it really achieve the three attribute we discussed above and **how does it actually works?**\n\n## How Does Fantom Works?\n\nAs we discussed, Fantom is a one-stop solution that ticks all the required attributes of **decentralization, security & scalability** which helps it to differentiate among other competing blockchain platforms like **Solana, ETH 2.0, Cardano, etc.**\n\nSo its functionality can be understood around these 4 core key pillars\n\n*   ***Modularity***\n*   ***Scalability***\n*   ***Security***\n*   ***Open-source***\n\n**Let’s decode all these concepts one by one;**\n\n## Modularity:\n\nAny tech product to scale requires it to be strongly decoupled and follow modularity as a design principle. Fantom has adopted this principle of modularity, which is enabled by **Lachesis, which is a modular consensus blockchain layer being used by Fantom. This layer is completely decoupled and flexible to be **plugged into any distributed ledger.\n\n> This Fantom’s modular allows Developers to port their existing Ethereum-based Decentralized apps on Fantom Opera mainnet in a matter of minutes, substantially upgrading the performance and lowering the costs.\n\n**What is Fantom Opera mainnet?**\n\nIt is the secure and fast environment that allows developers to build decentralized applications on top of it. It is fully permissionless and open-source. Powered by Fantom’s [aBFT consensus algorithm](https://fantom.foundation/lachesis-consensus-algorithm/).\n\n*It is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and provides full smart contracts support through Solidity.*\n\n## **Scalability:**\n\nFantome ensures that each of the blockchain-powered networks is working independently of each other, which helps to scale these networks for performance independently without being too much worried about the congestion.\n\n> Network congestion has been the biggest reason why Ethereum is not able to scale which leads to high Gas fee for any transactrion which happens on its Ethereum 1.0 platform currenlty. Now the ETH 2.0 is being revamped to overcome this issue of scalability, which is in-bult already in Fantom\n\nDapps hosted on Ethereum are affected by slow network speed and high gas fees, Fantom solves this scalability issue by giving each Dapps its own independent blockchain, which is like each app has got its own individual computers which happen to be an integral part of the same network.\n\nThis modularity and independent network layer make the Dapps lying on the fantom platform have their own custom tokens, tokenomics, and governance protocols. All of these apps networks are interconnected into **Lachesis**, Fantom’s uber-fast **aBFT** consensus, helping each of those apps to benefit from the speed and security of the underlying technology.\n\n## To sum-up,\n\n> Fantom is a network of potentially infinite number of decentralized computers(networks), that even though share the same software logic, behave completely completely independent from one another.\n\n## Security: Proof-of-Stake Security mechanism:\n\nThere has been quite a big debate and fuss around Bitcoin’s so-called energy-intensive mining. This is largely due to its underlying Proof-Of-Work mechanism to validate and approve any transactions. Fantom unlike bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0 PoW, relies on PoS consensus mechanism, so we can consider fantom to be environment-friendly in its approach of securing the transactions happening over its network.\n\nLachesis follows **leaderless Proof-of-stake consensus** that ensures a higher level of security, by removing any trusted leaders.\n\n**What Is Leaderless Proof-of-Stake?**\n\nFantom opera mainnet behaves differently when it comes to validating the transaction using PoS, Unlike some other traditional Proof-of-Stake systems, where some validators have a say on the validity of the transactions, opera mainnet is completely leaderless thereby removing any chance for the set of validators to have a significant say.\n\n> Removing leaders increases network security substantially.\n\n## Fantom is completely Open-sourced and community-driven:\n\nLike most of the blockchain platforms Fantom too is open-source, they envision creating modular building blocks for anyone to use and customize to their needs.\n\nYou can contribute and adapt their tech by visiting their Github account to access their code here:\n\nAlso, Fantom being permissionless, allows anyone to become a validator by running their [node](https://fantom.foundation/how-to-set-up-a-fantom-validator/).\n\n## As per their official doc,\n\n*On Fantom’s Opera Chain, a virtually unlimited number of validator nodes can participate in securing the network, as long as they keep a minimum of 3,175,000 *[*FTM*](https://fantom.foundation/ftm-token/)* at stake. ****FTM**** is their native token which can be traded over centralized exchanges and only Defi platforms.*\n\nYou can also become a delegator if you don’t have the required FTM token to the stake, you just need 1 FTM to do so.\n\nEnough of the tech discussion, for now, it's time to move forward and see what are some of the popular Defi, Dapps projects are leveraging Fantom to power themselves.\n\n## What Projects Are Leveraging Fantom?\n\n[**Travala**](https://www.travala.com/)**:** Blockchain-based travel booking platform\n\nTravala is leveraging Fantom’s blockchain platform to help travel freaks book over 3,000,000 travel products worldwide, including hotels, homes, flights, tours, and activities, this will be a huge boost to Fantom’s adoption.\n\n[**DABS**](https://main.dabs.af/). Innovative energy solutions.\n\nFantom has already signed an MoU with DABS\n\n> DABS is Afghanistan’s national, fast-growing electricity company. It manages electricity production, import, transmission, and distribution across the country.\n\nwhere they have agreed to cooperate on the digitalization and implementation of advanced audit software within DABS’s operations. This a huge partnership to support smart energy in Afghanistan, which can help more adoption & validation of the Fantom platform.\n\n## Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce and Investment:\n\nFantom has also cracked one more collaboration with the Afghanistan government’s, **ACCI**. They will be working with them to enhance their current software, incorporating cryptographic and blockchain tools, including the authentication of documentation for Certificates of Origin and Certificates of Quality.\n\n## Royal Star Pharma Partnership:\n\nRoyal Star is one of the biggest pharmaceutical distributors in Afghanistan has collaborated with Fantom to solve the counterfeit drugs problem prevalent in their region.\n\nFor more partnerships & integration which fantom has cracked, refer to their official site here:\n\n<https://fantom.foundation/partners/>\n\n## Decentralized Finance With Fantom :\n\nFantom is one of the few integrated platforms which also has strong support for the Defi ecosystem.\n\n> Fantom’s DeFi stack is built on an aBFT consensus. It’s much faster, cheaper, and more reliable and secure than its predecessors.\n\nOn Fantom, you can access Defi and trade directly from your wallet, using the following simple steps\n\n*   Deposit FTM to your wallet(**fWallet**)\n*   Mint fUSD with your **fMint**\n*   Use fUSD to trade, lend, and borrow on **fLend**\n\n**For more details visit:**\n\n<https://fantom.foundation/defi/>\n\n## Market Stats, Fundamentals & Tokenomics:\n\n## What is FTM Token?\n\nFTM is the primary token on the Fantom network. FTM is used for\n\n*   Securing the network through staking\n*   For governance\n*   For payments, and for Network fees.\n\n## Market Stats:\n\n## **As per **[**coinmarketplace**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/)\n\n**Current price**:\n\n*   It is currently trading for $0.237221 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $26,303,057 USD.\n\n**Market Rank** is: 96\n\n**Total MarketCap**: USD $603.42 M\n\n**Total Circulating Supply is**: 2.5 Bn\n\n**Max Supply Is**: 3.175 Bn\n\n**ROI Till Date: 1541.321 %**\n\n## Fantom’s Founders & Team\n\nWhen it comes to analyzing the fundamentals of any crypto , it is imperative to understand who are the founders and core team members behind the project. The Fantom Foundation was established by South Korean computer scientist\n\n*   Dr. Ahn Byung Ik.\n*   Currently, the platform’s CEO is Michael Kong.\n\nFantom also has a strong team supporting their strong open-source vision and comprises engineers, scientists, researchers, designers, and entrepreneurs.\n\n**Refer to the image below which has been sourced from their official site :**\n\n## Where Can You Trade FTM Token?\n\nFTM has been listed on some of the major centralized exchanges like\n\nThere are a total of 3.175 Bn FTM tokens, and their proposed distribution strategy that was proposed at the time of their ICO was\n\n*   *40 % Token sale to start with*\n*   *30 % Market Development*\n*   *15 % Advisors / contributors*\n*   *15 % Fantom team & Founders*\n\n## Fantom Roadmap :\n\nAnother deciding factor which one should look for when picking any crypto projects that make a part of their investment portfolio is the RoadMap. It gives a clear indication of what has been delivered and what is yet to be achieved against all the promises they laid down. This also helps one to analyze how capable their team is in meeting their own commitments.\n\nSo with this idea let’s see how Fantom’s journey has been so far, this roadmap was proposed in 2018, at the time of the ICO\n\n**As per the Roadmap:**\n\n> The Fantom Opera Chain did went live on 27 December 2019.\n\n## Summary & The Road Ahead:\n\n## I Feel :\n\nFantom is one of those crypto gems whose fundamentals look very promising. They have cracked some really promising deals with the Afghanistan govt, the Pak government, and also have some cool collaborations in the pharma and food traceability domain. Their technology and team look rock solid and their ecosystem looks all posied to flourish in 2021 and thereafter.\n\n> All in all, I feel one should keep a hawk-eye on FTM if they are looking to pick a crypto gem that can outperform their current price tag in long term. Fantom due to its strong fundamentals and partnership that can come to fruition largely in 2021–22, still looks undervalued. It has all the ingredients to become a successful Defi-enabled blockchain ecosystem, empowering the thriving Defi & Dapps space.\n\n**For more technical details about Fantom, Do visit:**\n\n## Disclaimer!\n\nOpinions expressed here at CryptoWise are not investment advice and are only for educational purposes.

DeFi Summer of 2020 turned a new page for the Crypto space as we started to see real growth — truly exponential growth, over such a short period for DeFi related tokens.\n\nBut, what is DeFi? How do you get started? What should you look out for? To help in this regard, we have spent time and effort navigating a foundational introduction into the emerging DeFi space. Our focal lens has critically selected some of the most promising cryptocurrencies DeFi has to offer.\n\nIn 2021, as an investor exploring DeFi, you might begin to feel a great deal of excitement, as you start to comprehend that a new era for Finance could be upon us. So, for DeFi investors, it has never been more critical to gain an edge when approaching the new sector of DeFi. Due to the vast amount of information, complexity, and infancy of the DeFi industry. It is easy to become overwhelmed by a fast-moving sector that operates in 24-hour markets. So, identifying an approach to tackle this fast-moving space is necessary. This brief insight helps by swapping out speculation & looking at real drivers of growth.\n\n> Subscribe to [**Coinmonks Youtube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/c/coinmonks/videos) to get daily crypto news.\n\n## What is DeFI?\n\nDecentralised Finance (‘DeFi’) is a system that takes from the concepts & instruments in Traditional Finance (‘TradFi’), then builds them on Decentralised infrastructure & systems. These systems and infrastructures, in other words, are built on top of a Blockchain — an emerging technology. The goal of DeFi is to create and provide global access to Finance. Whilst being more **transparent** and **resilient** than traditional financial systems.\n\nThe unique aspect of this technology is that it utilises **Smart Contracts**. These are contractual agreements executed with code, without an intermediate to facilitate agreements between two parties.\n\nThese contracts help DeFi & the DeFi Applications become\n\n*   **Permissionless,** meaning they are open access.\n*   **Truslestless**, meaning there is no single point dependency on a centralised entity.\n\nThese are features of DeFi & dApps because they are built using Blockchain technology, which offers:\n\n*   Immutability (Security)\n*   Scalability\n*   Transparency\n*   Decentralisation\n\n**History of DeFi**\n\nAfter Bitcoin introduced a new peer-to-peer financial payments system in 2009. Ethereum shortly after brought us Smart contracts. This in turn meant organisations would then start to build on Ethereum and use their Smart contract functionality, one of the first being MakerDao. It can be disputed that DeFi first started with the first DEX: OASISDEX (2016) then after emerged DAI, a stable coin (2017), then UNISWAP (2018), or COMP (2018).\n\nAlthough the glamour of DeFi really started to blossom in the period when the Crypto community across platforms like Twitter, Reddit & Youtube coined the phrase “DeFi summer”. This period was essentially the genesis Block for DeFi. MakerDAO ($MRK) & Compound $COMP, projects built on the Ethereum, ignited this hot period for DeFi. Maker, which formed the DAI stable coin was perhaps one of the most important projects in kicking off DeFi acting as an early pioneer.\n\nCurrently, around 50% of DeFi is built on top of Ethereum and has the largest share of TVL. However, this is gradually being chipped away by the growth of alternative Blockchains such as **Avalanche, Solana, Fantom**. They offer smart contracts with benefits such as faster and cheaper transaction costs.\n\nDeFi has meant positive narratives towards Crypto have developed; this is because the speculation gap between what a cryptocurrency ‘could do’ in the future and what it does now has closed massively. As incentives for buyers to own Crypto can be driven by fundamental metrics like revenue & profit made by projects, compared with the past, where it was driven by a greater degree of speculation.\n\n**Growth in DeFi**\n\nThe DeFI user base is exponentially growing as investors start to think optimistically & acknowledge the financial rewards of investing in DeFi. Data shows that towards the end of June, 2.91M Ethereum addresses alone interacted with DeFI, a 65% increase on the previous quarter, according to ConsenSys. DeFi offers consistent revenue-generating models that DeFi investors can look at, driven by the fees that protocols receive.\n\nThe size of the DeFi market can be measured by looking at Market Capitalisation (Market Cap). The Market Cap of the 100 DeFi coins currently stands at $135 billion, around 5.6% of a total market cap of approximately $2.5 Trillion.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) is also a popular metric to illustrate this growth in DeFi that represents the total amount Staked across a given Protocol. Which essentially means the number of crypto currencies’ active’ in earning interest.\n\nAccording to DeFI Pulse, DeFi on Ethereum has grown roughly 1125% from the start of 2020 & 450% from October last year, currently at around 95 billion TVL.\n\nTVL across all chains has seen a 36,000% increase since the start of 2020, & year on year (YOY) 2180% increase.\n\n**3 Drivers of TVL in DeFi**\n\n*   Borrowing & Lending\n\nInterest rates help dictate the demand & supply for borrowing and lending, as it is the cost of borrowing and reward for lending. This functions very similarly to how it would in a traditional Banking system. In DeFi, there are subtle differences, such as being **non-custodial**, averagely offering a **lower cost** to borrowing and higher** reward for lending**. This is influenced by attractive yields & interest for making a deposit.\n\nA Central Bank does not dictate rates for DeFi Protocols. DeFi interest rates are independent of a central authority, meaning interest rates in DeFi are more flexible and reflect the supply and liquidity in the system.\n\n**Collateral is **essential to understand**,** as it represents something pledged as security until repayment of a loan. When you want to borrow in DeFi, you use your Crypto as Collateral to borrow against other Crypto, but this is often **over collateralised**. This is used as security in the case of default of repayment of a loan.\n\n*   Staking: Yield Farming, Liquidity Providing (LP)\n\nYield Farming & Liquidity Providing are all forms of Staking to earn additional interest. Typically through providing liquidity to DEXs. It involves depositing assets for interest, often paid in the tokens of the protocol. But, due to its decentralised nature, there are more opportunities to earn interest rather than just sitting in a bank.\n\n*   Trading\n\nTrading in DeFi involves the buying & selling of cryptocurrencies in a non-custodial manner without setting up an account and sending ID & address documentation. Known as ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’, this makes them **permissionless** as trading venues. DeFi Exchanges that facilitate these trades are an alternative to trading on Centralised options.\n\nExchanges were the first significant revenue business model for Crypto, and this has been a very similar case for the first early-stage DeFi projects.\n\n**Blockchains that Enable DeFi**\n\n*   **Ethereum**\n*   **Solana**\n*   **Avalanche**\n*   **Fantom**\n\n**Centralised Finance (CeFi) & Decentralised Finance (DeFi)**\n\nThere are currently more users of CeFi than DeFi, but this can change due to things like lowering the costs of making trades and deeper liquidity on platforms.\n\nLiquidity is the volume to enable trades on the market — higher liquidity can mean lower slippage. Slippage refers to the difference between the actual price and the price you pay when executing a transaction on an exchange. For traders, slippage adds to the cost of traders, which is particularly something. Traders like to avoid.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BmLnP534TGdkBVpsxFzgPQ.png)\n\nParticipation in the DeFI ecosystem can be tricky & costly for new time DeFi investors trying to use DeFi Apps (DApps). The process of setting up a wallet might be tedious as it’s your responsibility to handle your Security. Managing your Security is crucial as you have custody of your funds in the wallets you use to log in to dApps. Typically, a Centralised Exchange has control & custody of your assets, meaning you put trust in an Exchange to manage those risks.\n\nIn addition to this, there is also a question of cost. You can incur a high gas cost executing a transaction on chains like Ethereum. The cost of a transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain, measured in ‘Gwei’, is also called ‘gas’. These costs have been extreme of late, which can ‘price out’ some participants.\n\nSee below chart. This chart begins after the upgrade of **ETH-1559 on July 8th** implemented to help reduce transaction costs, which are still at 8–12(USD) a transaction, about 0.003 ETH and around 140gwei.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*nAbsEwnt9GTjcER0)\n\nSource: <https://dune.xyz/kroeger0x/gas-prices>\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*WVrgFiHKxJybQJxH)\n\nSource: <https://dune.xyz/kroeger0x/gas-prices>\n\nTo be a DeFi investor, investing in DeFi related projects is possible without interacting directly with the DeFi protocol. You can, as an investor, do this through Centralised exchanges, which can prove to be easier than directly interacting with DeFi. Therefore, you have the reassurance that reputable CEX’s conduct research and then vet projects before listing.\n\nBelow are 3 DeFi Protocols All 3 have a growing user base with robust unique features.\n\n**AAVE**\n\nAAVE is DeFi’s closest protocol to a Bank. It uses a money market system to enable borrowing & lending. It has a native token called $AAVE, which rewards users in staking rewards and governance on its protocol.\n\n**How it works**\n\nIn a traditional borrowing and lending system within a Bank, a lender is matched with a borrower. The Bank acts as the intermediate, managing this. However, on AAVE, the protocol enables automatic, automated loans via smart contracts, which cuts out this middle-man.\n\nFor AAVE process works by Lenders depositing their Crypto into liquidity pools. These Liquidity Pools are essentially pools of funds that enable depositors to earn an interest based on their deposit, which will be lent out of the Liquidity Pools.\n\nBorrowers pay the interest rate. This, however, depends on the availability of assets in a liquidity pool. Meaning, the rates fluctuate in accordance to meet demand and supply levels. Higher interest rates are used to incentivise lenders to deposit more & at a lower rate, the supply of assets is high.\n\nIn the traditional banking system, loans granted are **under collateralised**. However, with AAVE, the loans are **over collateralised**, meaning users need to deposit Collateral higher in value than the amount they borrow.\n\nA reminder that Collateral represents something pledged as security; in the case here, Crypto is held until repayment of a loan, in case of default. It is implemented across the Crypto market because it is volatile. So, AAVE takes precautions to employ a liquidation process if the collateral value falls under the collateralisation amount.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n*   Price: $304 USD, 707% (YOY)\n*   Market Cap: $4bn\n*   TVL: $16bn\n\n**Uniswap**\n\nUniswap is the most extensive Decentralised Exchange (DEX) & Automatic Market Maker (AMM) in DeFi. An AMM is a concept born out of DeFi.\n\n**How it works**\n\nInstead of using a classic order-book model of matching buyers and sellers to determine the price and execute trades, Uniswap uses a math equation ( x \\* y = k.), pools of tokens, and ETH to do the same job.\n\nThrough utilising any ERC-20 asset (Tokens built using Ethereum), users effectively provide liquidity to these pools (becoming LP’s) for each token offered to trade and then earn fees in $UNI in return.\n\n$UNI is Uniswap’s Governance token; its only function is as a Governance token to vote Uniswap Proposals put through by the community.\n\nMetrics\n\n*   Price: $27 USD, 909% (YOY)\n*   Market Cap: $14bn\n*   TVL:$ 4.9bn\n\n**DYDX**\n\nThe largest & most liquid Decentralised Derivatives Exchange (DDEX), built on Ethereum Blockchain. Offering perpetual & dated futures, margin trading and spot markets, aiming to be the best option for trading tools in DeFi.The token $DYDX is associated with the protocol and was given in an ‘airdrop’ to past exchange users. It is used for governance, mining rewards, staking pools and trading discounts.\n\nDerivatives make up a considerable slice of the Crypto market pie; their volume now matches that of top CeFI spot traded markets seen on big CEX providers like Coinbase; dYdX’s $5.9 billion in 24hours to Coinbase’s volume of $3.4 billion, one week ago.\n\nThe demand for DEX & DDEX’s is likely to continue growing as it becomes the only solution for some Crypto investors to invest & trade. Recent regional bans for buying and selling spot Crypto in China and the ban on Trading of Crypto-derivatives in the United Kingdom had significant positive knock-on effects for other providers. Participants from these regions will look for suitable alternatives to trade products that are now against the law in these regions.\n\n**How It works**\n\nBy standard DeFi design, dYdX is a lending and borrowing protocol. Although, dYdX goes a step further, becoming the go-to solution for Ethereum’s decentralised margin trading. It boasts liquidity on par with some of the largest CEX’s in the market.\n\nUsers Deposit funds into their Margin or Spot Account to start lending funds to the protocol, or borrowing, ETH, DAI, and USDC currently supported. Users trade from their accounts directly afters their deposits from their wallets. In which the deposit from these wallets is then used to trade against different pairs. Users can withdraw their funds again back into their wallets.\n\nLike most DeFi financial products, dYdX is readily available for anyone to use, with its users’ assets managed & run without intermediates by utilising Smart contract applications.\n\nMetrics:\n\n*   Price: $22.4 USD, (YOY) N/A\n*   Market Cap: $1.25 Billion\n*   TVL: 980 Million\n\n**Timeline Of DeFi**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*DqQwDsQorPItHvK04iwwhw.png)\n\nSource: <https://blog.makerdao.com/a-brief-history-of-decentralized-finance-defi/>\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*lzUPxzmyC2tricNmsiUnew.png)\n\nSource: <https://blog.makerdao.com/a-brief-history-of-decentralized-finance-defi/>\n\n**FAQs**\n\nHow do I get started with DeFI?\n\nDirectly set up a wallet. A cryptocurrency wallet installed on your browser, Or Sign up to a CEX that offers DeFI tokens.\n\nIs DeFI safe?\n\nIt depends on the protocol and the degree of quality to produce the code to make smart contracts. It’s possible for Bugs, which could result in compromising security, through hackers.\n\nWhat is a DeFI wallet?\n\nDeFi wallets are used to access DApps and the web3. Are non-custodial and key-based. The non-custodial trait implies that users could send and transfer funds to ensure that only they can access the funds.\n\nIs DeFi regulated?\n\nDeFi is currently subject to existing regulation laws. This can be subject to regulatory frameworks that apply to cryptocurrency projects, although those do not regulate the specifics of DeFi.\n\nNone of This Writing is Financial Advice.\n\n> Join Coinmonks [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/coincodecap) and [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/coinmonks/videos) learn about crypto trading and investing\n\n## Also Read\n", "timestamp": 1635482259, "digest": "PvFT0SnHtHNuuWPYPjooADGjVvb1M9Dx0ZJwbdqEZFo", "contributor": "0x324404361B9d4437cd9FAff264E4146C6c5fF9cA"}

DeFi Summer of 2020 turned a new page for the Crypto space as we started to see real growth — truly exponential growth, over such a short period for DeFi related tokens.\n\nBut, what is DeFi? How do you get started? What should you look out for? To help in this regard, we have spent time and effort navigating a foundational introduction into the emerging DeFi space. Our focal lens has critically selected some of the most promising cryptocurrencies DeFi has to offer.\n\nIn 2021, as an investor exploring DeFi, you might begin to feel a great deal of excitement, as you start to comprehend that a new era for Finance could be upon us. So, for DeFi investors, it has never been more critical to gain an edge when approaching the new sector of DeFi. Due to the vast amount of information, complexity, and infancy of the DeFi industry. It is easy to become overwhelmed by a fast-moving sector that operates in 24-hour markets. So, identifying an approach to tackle this fast-moving space is necessary. This brief insight helps by swapping out speculation & looking at real drivers of growth.\n\n> Subscribe to [**Coinmonks Youtube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/c/coinmonks/videos) to get daily crypto news.\n\n## What is DeFI?\n\nDecentralised Finance (‘DeFi’) is a system that takes from the concepts & instruments in Traditional Finance (‘TradFi’), then builds them on Decentralised infrastructure & systems. These systems and infrastructures, in other words, are built on top of a Blockchain — an emerging technology. The goal of DeFi is to create and provide global access to Finance. Whilst being more **transparent** and **resilient** than traditional financial systems.\n\nThe unique aspect of this technology is that it utilises **Smart Contracts**. These are contractual agreements executed with code, without an intermediate to facilitate agreements between two parties.\n\nThese contracts help DeFi & the DeFi Applications become\n\n*   **Permissionless,** meaning they are open access.\n*   **Truslestless**, meaning there is no single point dependency on a centralised entity.\n\nThese are features of DeFi & dApps because they are built using Blockchain technology, which offers:\n\n*   Immutability (Security)\n*   Scalability\n*   Transparency\n*   Decentralisation\n\n**History of DeFi**\n\nAfter Bitcoin introduced a new peer-to-peer financial payments system in 2009. Ethereum shortly after brought us Smart contracts. This in turn meant organisations would then start to build on Ethereum and use their Smart contract functionality, one of the first being MakerDao. It can be disputed that DeFi first started with the first DEX: OASISDEX (2016) then after emerged DAI, a stable coin (2017), then UNISWAP (2018), or COMP (2018).\n\nAlthough the glamour of DeFi really started to blossom in the period when the Crypto community across platforms like Twitter, Reddit & Youtube coined the phrase “DeFi summer”. This period was essentially the genesis Block for DeFi. MakerDAO ($MRK) & Compound $COMP, projects built on the Ethereum, ignited this hot period for DeFi. Maker, which formed the DAI stable coin was perhaps one of the most important projects in kicking off DeFi acting as an early pioneer.\n\nCurrently, around 50% of DeFi is built on top of Ethereum and has the largest share of TVL. However, this is gradually being chipped away by the growth of alternative Blockchains such as **Avalanche, Solana, Fantom**. They offer smart contracts with benefits such as faster and cheaper transaction costs.\n\nDeFi has meant positive narratives towards Crypto have developed; this is because the speculation gap between what a cryptocurrency ‘could do’ in the future and what it does now has closed massively. As incentives for buyers to own Crypto can be driven by fundamental metrics like revenue & profit made by projects, compared with the past, where it was driven by a greater degree of speculation.\n\n**Growth in DeFi**\n\nThe DeFI user base is exponentially growing as investors start to think optimistically & acknowledge the financial rewards of investing in DeFi. Data shows that towards the end of June, 2.91M Ethereum addresses alone interacted with DeFI, a 65% increase on the previous quarter, according to ConsenSys. DeFi offers consistent revenue-generating models that DeFi investors can look at, driven by the fees that protocols receive.\n\nThe size of the DeFi market can be measured by looking at Market Capitalisation (Market Cap). The Market Cap of the 100 DeFi coins currently stands at $135 billion, around 5.6% of a total market cap of approximately $2.5 Trillion.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) is also a popular metric to illustrate this growth in DeFi that represents the total amount Staked across a given Protocol. Which essentially means the number of crypto currencies’ active’ in earning interest.\n\nAccording to DeFI Pulse, DeFi on Ethereum has grown roughly 1125% from the start of 2020 & 450% from October last year, currently at around 95 billion TVL.\n\nTVL across all chains has seen a 36,000% increase since the start of 2020, & year on year (YOY) 2180% increase.\n\n**3 Drivers of TVL in DeFi**\n\n*   Borrowing & Lending\n\nInterest rates help dictate the demand & supply for borrowing and lending, as it is the cost of borrowing and reward for lending. This functions very similarly to how it would in a traditional Banking system. In DeFi, there are subtle differences, such as being **non-custodial**, averagely offering a **lower cost** to borrowing and higher** reward for lending**. This is influenced by attractive yields & interest for making a deposit.\n\nA Central Bank does not dictate rates for DeFi Protocols. DeFi interest rates are independent of a central authority, meaning interest rates in DeFi are more flexible and reflect the supply and liquidity in the system.\n\n**Collateral is **essential to understand**,** as it represents something pledged as security until repayment of a loan. When you want to borrow in DeFi, you use your Crypto as Collateral to borrow against other Crypto, but this is often **over collateralised**. This is used as security in the case of default of repayment of a loan.\n\n*   Staking: Yield Farming, Liquidity Providing (LP)\n\nYield Farming & Liquidity Providing are all forms of Staking to earn additional interest. Typically through providing liquidity to DEXs. It involves depositing assets for interest, often paid in the tokens of the protocol. But, due to its decentralised nature, there are more opportunities to earn interest rather than just sitting in a bank.\n\n*   Trading\n\nTrading in DeFi involves the buying & selling of cryptocurrencies in a non-custodial manner without setting up an account and sending ID & address documentation. Known as ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’, this makes them **permissionless** as trading venues. DeFi Exchanges that facilitate these trades are an alternative to trading on Centralised options.\n\nExchanges were the first significant revenue business model for Crypto, and this has been a very similar case for the first early-stage DeFi projects.\n\n**Blockchains that Enable DeFi**\n\n*   **Ethereum**\n*   **Solana**\n*   **Avalanche**\n*   **Fantom**\n\n**Centralised Finance (CeFi) & Decentralised Finance (DeFi)**\n\nThere are currently more users of CeFi than DeFi, but this can change due to things like lowering the costs of making trades and deeper liquidity on platforms.\n\nLiquidity is the volume to enable trades on the market — higher liquidity can mean lower slippage. Slippage refers to the difference between the actual price and the price you pay when executing a transaction on an exchange. For traders, slippage adds to the cost of traders, which is particularly something. Traders like to avoid.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BmLnP534TGdkBVpsxFzgPQ.png)\n\nParticipation in the DeFI ecosystem can be tricky & costly for new time DeFi investors trying to use DeFi Apps (DApps). The process of setting up a wallet might be tedious as it’s your responsibility to handle your Security. Managing your Security is crucial as you have custody of your funds in the wallets you use to log in to dApps. Typically, a Centralised Exchange has control & custody of your assets, meaning you put trust in an Exchange to manage those risks.\n\nIn addition to this, there is also a question of cost. You can incur a high gas cost executing a transaction on chains like Ethereum. The cost of a transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain, measured in ‘Gwei’, is also called ‘gas’. These costs have been extreme of late, which can ‘price out’ some participants.\n\nSee below chart. This chart begins after the upgrade of **ETH-1559 on July 8th** implemented to help reduce transaction costs, which are still at 8–12(USD) a transaction, about 0.003 ETH and around 140gwei.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*nAbsEwnt9GTjcER0)\n\nSource: <https://dune.xyz/kroeger0x/gas-prices>\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*WVrgFiHKxJybQJxH)\n\nSource: <https://dune.xyz/kroeger0x/gas-prices>\n\nTo be a DeFi investor, investing in DeFi related projects is possible without interacting directly with the DeFi protocol. You can, as an investor, do this through Centralised exchanges, which can prove to be easier than directly interacting with DeFi. Therefore, you have the reassurance that reputable CEX’s conduct research and then vet projects before listing.\n\nBelow are 3 DeFi Protocols All 3 have a growing user base with robust unique features.\n\n**AAVE**\n\nAAVE is DeFi’s closest protocol to a Bank. It uses a money market system to enable borrowing & lending. It has a native token called $AAVE, which rewards users in staking rewards and governance on its protocol.\n\n**How it works**\n\nIn a traditional borrowing and lending system within a Bank, a lender is matched with a borrower. The Bank acts as the intermediate, managing this. However, on AAVE, the protocol enables automatic, automated loans via smart contracts, which cuts out this middle-man.\n\nFor AAVE process works by Lenders depositing their Crypto into liquidity pools. These Liquidity Pools are essentially pools of funds that enable depositors to earn an interest based on their deposit, which will be lent out of the Liquidity Pools.\n\nBorrowers pay the interest rate. This, however, depends on the availability of assets in a liquidity pool. Meaning, the rates fluctuate in accordance to meet demand and supply levels. Higher interest rates are used to incentivise lenders to deposit more & at a lower rate, the supply of assets is high.\n\nIn the traditional banking system, loans granted are **under collateralised**. However, with AAVE, the loans are **over collateralised**, meaning users need to deposit Collateral higher in value than the amount they borrow.\n\nA reminder that Collateral represents something pledged as security; in the case here, Crypto is held until repayment of a loan, in case of default. It is implemented across the Crypto market because it is volatile. So, AAVE takes precautions to employ a liquidation process if the collateral value falls under the collateralisation amount.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n*   Price: $304 USD, 707% (YOY)\n*   Market Cap: $4bn\n*   TVL: $16bn\n\n**Uniswap**\n\nUniswap is the most extensive Decentralised Exchange (DEX) & Automatic Market Maker (AMM) in DeFi. An AMM is a concept born out of DeFi.\n\n**How it works**\n\nInstead of using a classic order-book model of matching buyers and sellers to determine the price and execute trades, Uniswap uses a math equation ( x \\* y = k.), pools of tokens, and ETH to do the same job.\n\nThrough utilising any ERC-20 asset (Tokens built using Ethereum), users effectively provide liquidity to these pools (becoming LP’s) for each token offered to trade and then earn fees in $UNI in return.\n\n$UNI is Uniswap’s Governance token; its only function is as a Governance token to vote Uniswap Proposals put through by the community.\n\nMetrics\n\n*   Price: $27 USD, 909% (YOY)\n*   Market Cap: $14bn\n*   TVL:$ 4.9bn\n\n**DYDX**\n\nThe largest & most liquid Decentralised Derivatives Exchange (DDEX), built on Ethereum Blockchain. Offering perpetual & dated futures, margin trading and spot markets, aiming to be the best option for trading tools in DeFi.The token $DYDX is associated with the protocol and was given in an ‘airdrop’ to past exchange users. It is used for governance, mining rewards, staking pools and trading discounts.\n\nDerivatives make up a considerable slice of the Crypto market pie; their volume now matches that of top CeFI spot traded markets seen on big CEX providers like Coinbase; dYdX’s $5.9 billion in 24hours to Coinbase’s volume of $3.4 billion, one week ago.\n\nThe demand for DEX & DDEX’s is likely to continue growing as it becomes the only solution for some Crypto investors to invest & trade. Recent regional bans for buying and selling spot Crypto in China and the ban on Trading of Crypto-derivatives in the United Kingdom had significant positive knock-on effects for other providers. Participants from these regions will look for suitable alternatives to trade products that are now against the law in these regions.\n\n**How It works**\n\nBy standard DeFi design, dYdX is a lending and borrowing protocol. Although, dYdX goes a step further, becoming the go-to solution for Ethereum’s decentralised margin trading. It boasts liquidity on par with some of the largest CEX’s in the market.\n\nUsers Deposit funds into their Margin or Spot Account to start lending funds to the protocol, or borrowing, ETH, DAI, and USDC currently supported. Users trade from their accounts directly afters their deposits from their wallets. In which the deposit from these wallets is then used to trade against different pairs. Users can withdraw their funds again back into their wallets.\n\nLike most DeFi financial products, dYdX is readily available for anyone to use, with its users’ assets managed & run without intermediates by utilising Smart contract applications.\n\nMetrics:\n\n*   Price: $22.4 USD, (YOY) N/A\n*   Market Cap: $1.25 Billion\n*   TVL: 980 Million\n\n**Timeline Of DeFi**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*DqQwDsQorPItHvK04iwwhw.png)\n\nSource: <https://blog.makerdao.com/a-brief-history-of-decentralized-finance-defi/>\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*lzUPxzmyC2tricNmsiUnew.png)\n\nSource: <https://blog.makerdao.com/a-brief-history-of-decentralized-finance-defi/>\n\n**FAQs**\n\nHow do I get started with DeFI?\n\nDirectly set up a wallet.

DeFi Summer of 2020 turned a new page for the Crypto space as we started to see real growth — truly exponential growth, over such a short period for DeFi related tokens.\n\nBut, what is DeFi? How do you get started? What should you look out for? To help in this regard, we have spent time and effort navigating a foundational introduction into the emerging DeFi space. Our focal lens has critically selected some of the most promising cryptocurrencies DeFi has to offer.\n\nIn 2021, as an investor exploring DeFi, you might begin to feel a great deal of excitement, as you start to comprehend that a new era for Finance could be upon us. So, for DeFi investors, it has never been more critical to gain an edge when approaching the new sector of DeFi. Due to the vast amount of information, complexity, and infancy of the DeFi industry. It is easy to become overwhelmed by a fast-moving sector that operates in 24-hour markets. So, identifying an approach to tackle this fast-moving space is necessary. This brief insight helps by swapping out speculation & looking at real drivers of growth.\n\n> Subscribe to [**Coinmonks Youtube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/c/coinmonks/videos) to get daily crypto news.\n\n## What is DeFI?\n\nDecentralised Finance (‘DeFi’) is a system that takes from the concepts & instruments in Traditional Finance (‘TradFi’), then builds them on Decentralised infrastructure & systems. These systems and infrastructures, in other words, are built on top of a Blockchain — an emerging technology. The goal of DeFi is to create and provide global access to Finance. Whilst being more **transparent** and **resilient** than traditional financial systems.\n\nThe unique aspect of this technology is that it utilises **Smart Contracts**. These are contractual agreements executed with code, without an intermediate to facilitate agreements between two parties.\n\nThese contracts help DeFi & the DeFi Applications become\n\n*   **Permissionless,** meaning they are open access.\n*   **Truslestless**, meaning there is no single point dependency on a centralised entity.\n\nThese are features of DeFi & dApps because they are built using Blockchain technology, which offers:\n\n*   Immutability (Security)\n*   Scalability\n*   Transparency\n*   Decentralisation\n\n**History of DeFi**\n\nAfter Bitcoin introduced a new peer-to-peer financial payments system in 2009. Ethereum shortly after brought us Smart contracts. This in turn meant organisations would then start to build on Ethereum and use their Smart contract functionality, one of the first being MakerDao. It can be disputed that DeFi first started with the first DEX: OASISDEX (2016) then after emerged DAI, a stable coin (2017), then UNISWAP (2018), or COMP (2018).\n\nAlthough the glamour of DeFi really started to blossom in the period when the Crypto community across platforms like Twitter, Reddit & Youtube coined the phrase “DeFi summer”. This period was essentially the genesis Block for DeFi. MakerDAO ($MRK) & Compound $COMP, projects built on the Ethereum, ignited this hot period for DeFi. Maker, which formed the DAI stable coin was perhaps one of the most important projects in kicking off DeFi acting as an early pioneer.\n\nCurrently, around 50% of DeFi is built on top of Ethereum and has the largest share of TVL. However, this is gradually being chipped away by the growth of alternative Blockchains such as **Avalanche, Solana, Fantom**. They offer smart contracts with benefits such as faster and cheaper transaction costs.\n\nDeFi has meant positive narratives towards Crypto have developed; this is because the speculation gap between what a cryptocurrency ‘could do’ in the future and what it does now has closed massively. As incentives for buyers to own Crypto can be driven by fundamental metrics like revenue & profit made by projects, compared with the past, where it was driven by a greater degree of speculation.\n\n**Growth in DeFi**\n\nThe DeFI user base is exponentially growing as investors start to think optimistically & acknowledge the financial rewards of investing in DeFi. Data shows that towards the end of June, 2.91M Ethereum addresses alone interacted with DeFI, a 65% increase on the previous quarter, according to ConsenSys. DeFi offers consistent revenue-generating models that DeFi investors can look at, driven by the fees that protocols receive.\n\nThe size of the DeFi market can be measured by looking at Market Capitalisation (Market Cap). The Market Cap of the 100 DeFi coins currently stands at $135 billion, around 5.6% of a total market cap of approximately $2.5 Trillion.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) is also a popular metric to illustrate this growth in DeFi that represents the total amount Staked across a given Protocol.

DeFi Summer of 2020 turned a new page for the Crypto space as we started to see real growth — truly exponential growth, over such a short period for DeFi related tokens.\n\nBut, what is DeFi? How do you get started? What should you look out for? To help in this regard, we have spent time and effort navigating a foundational introduction into the emerging DeFi space. Our focal lens has critically selected some of the most promising cryptocurrencies DeFi has to offer.\n\nIn 2021, as an investor exploring DeFi, you might begin to feel a great deal of excitement, as you start to comprehend that a new era for Finance could be upon us. So, for DeFi investors, it has never been more critical to gain an edge when approaching the new sector of DeFi. Due to the vast amount of information, complexity, and infancy of the DeFi industry. It is easy to become overwhelmed by a fast-moving sector that operates in 24-hour markets. So, identifying an approach to tackle this fast-moving space is necessary. This brief insight helps by swapping out speculation & looking at real drivers of growth.\n\n> Subscribe to [**Coinmonks Youtube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/c/coinmonks/videos) to get daily crypto news.\n\n## What is DeFI?\n\nDecentralised Finance (‘DeFi’) is a system that takes from the concepts & instruments in Traditional Finance (‘TradFi’), then builds them on Decentralised infrastructure & systems. These systems and infrastructures, in other words, are built on top of a Blockchain — an emerging technology. The goal of DeFi is to create and provide global access to Finance. Whilst being more **transparent** and **resilient** than traditional financial systems.\n\nThe unique aspect of this technology is that it utilises **Smart Contracts**. These are contractual agreements executed with code, without an intermediate to facilitate agreements between two parties.\n\nThese contracts help DeFi & the DeFi Applications become\n\n*   **Permissionless,** meaning they are open access.\n*   **Truslestless**, meaning there is no single point dependency on a centralised entity.\n\nThese are features of DeFi & dApps because they are built using Blockchain technology, which offers:\n\n*   Immutability (Security)\n*   Scalability\n*   Transparency\n*   Decentralisation\n\n**History of DeFi**\n\nAfter Bitcoin introduced a new peer-to-peer financial payments system in 2009. Ethereum shortly after brought us Smart contracts. This in turn meant organisations would then start to build on Ethereum and use their Smart contract functionality, one of the first being MakerDao. It can be disputed that DeFi first started with the first DEX: OASISDEX (2016) then after emerged DAI, a stable coin (2017), then UNISWAP (2018), or COMP (2018).\n\nAlthough the glamour of DeFi really started to blossom in the period when the Crypto community across platforms like Twitter, Reddit & Youtube coined the phrase “DeFi summer”. This period was essentially the genesis Block for DeFi. MakerDAO ($MRK) & Compound $COMP, projects built on the Ethereum, ignited this hot period for DeFi. Maker, which formed the DAI stable coin was perhaps one of the most important projects in kicking off DeFi acting as an early pioneer.\n\nCurrently, around 50% of DeFi is built on top of Ethereum and has the largest share of TVL. However, this is gradually being chipped away by the growth of alternative Blockchains such as **Avalanche, Solana, Fantom**. They offer smart contracts with benefits such as faster and cheaper transaction costs.\n\nDeFi has meant positive narratives towards Crypto have developed; this is because the speculation gap between what a cryptocurrency ‘could do’ in the future and what it does now has closed massively. As incentives for buyers to own Crypto can be driven by fundamental metrics like revenue & profit made by projects, compared with the past, where it was driven by a greater degree of speculation.\n\n**Growth in DeFi**\n\nThe DeFI user base is exponentially growing as investors start to think optimistically & acknowledge the financial rewards of investing in DeFi. Data shows that towards the end of June, 2.91M Ethereum addresses alone interacted with DeFI, a 65% increase on the previous quarter, according to ConsenSys. DeFi offers consistent revenue-generating models that DeFi investors can look at, driven by the fees that protocols receive.\n\nThe size of the DeFi market can be measured by looking at Market Capitalisation (Market Cap). The Market Cap of the 100 DeFi coins currently stands at $135 billion, around 5.6% of a total market cap of approximately $2.5 Trillion.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) is also a popular metric to illustrate this growth in DeFi that represents the total amount Staked across a given Protocol. Which essentially means the number of crypto currencies’ active’ in earning interest.\n\nAccording to DeFI Pulse, DeFi on Ethereum has grown roughly 1125% from the start of 2020 & 450% from October last year, currently at around 95 billion TVL.\n\nTVL across all chains has seen a 36,000% increase since the start of 2020, & year on year (YOY) 2180% increase.\n\n**3 Drivers of TVL in DeFi**\n\n*   Borrowing & Lending\n\nInterest rates help dictate the demand & supply for borrowing and lending, as it is the cost of borrowing and reward for lending. This functions very similarly to how it would in a traditional Banking system. In DeFi, there are subtle differences, such as being **non-custodial**, averagely offering a **lower cost** to borrowing and higher** reward for lending**. This is influenced by attractive yields & interest for making a deposit.\n\nA Central Bank does not dictate rates for DeFi Protocols. DeFi interest rates are independent of a central authority, meaning interest rates in DeFi are more flexible and reflect the supply and liquidity in the system.\n\n**Collateral is **essential to understand**,** as it represents something pledged as security until repayment of a loan. When you want to borrow in DeFi, you use your Crypto as Collateral to borrow against other Crypto, but this is often **over collateralised**. This is used as security in the case of default of repayment of a loan.\n\n*   Staking: Yield Farming, Liquidity Providing (LP)\n\nYield Farming & Liquidity Providing are all forms of Staking to earn additional interest. Typically through providing liquidity to DEXs. It involves depositing assets for interest, often paid in the tokens of the protocol. But, due to its decentralised nature, there are more opportunities to earn interest rather than just sitting in a bank.\n\n*   Trading\n\nTrading in DeFi involves the buying & selling of cryptocurrencies in a non-custodial manner without setting up an account and sending ID & address documentation. Known as ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’, this makes them **permissionless** as trading venues. DeFi Exchanges that facilitate these trades are an alternative to trading on Centralised options.\n\nExchanges were the first significant revenue business model for Crypto, and this has been a very similar case for the first early-stage DeFi projects.\n\n**Blockchains that Enable DeFi**\n\n*   **Ethereum**\n*   **Solana**\n*   **Avalanche**\n*   **Fantom**\n\n**Centralised Finance (CeFi) & Decentralised Finance (DeFi)**\n\nThere are currently more users of CeFi than DeFi, but this can change due to things like lowering the costs of making trades and deeper liquidity on platforms.\n\nLiquidity is the volume to enable trades on the market — higher liquidity can mean lower slippage. Slippage refers to the difference between the actual price and the price you pay when executing a transaction on an exchange. For traders, slippage adds to the cost of traders, which is particularly something. Traders like to avoid.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BmLnP534TGdkBVpsxFzgPQ.png)\n\nParticipation in the DeFI ecosystem can be tricky & costly for new time DeFi investors trying to use DeFi Apps (DApps). The process of setting up a wallet might be tedious as it’s your responsibility to handle your Security. Managing your Security is crucial as you have custody of your funds in the wallets you use to log in to dApps. Typically, a Centralised Exchange has control & custody of your assets, meaning you put trust in an Exchange to manage those risks.\n\nIn addition to this, there is also a question of cost. You can incur a high gas cost executing a transaction on chains like Ethereum. The cost of a transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain, measured in ‘Gwei’, is also called ‘gas’. These costs have been extreme of late, which can ‘price out’ some participants.\n\nSee below chart. This chart begins after the upgrade of **ETH-1559 on July 8th** implemented to help reduce transaction costs, which are still at 8–12(USD) a transaction, about 0.003 ETH and around 140gwei.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*nAbsEwnt9GTjcER0)\n\nSource: <https://dune.xyz/kroeger0x/gas-prices>\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*WVrgFiHKxJybQJxH)\n\nSource: <https://dune.xyz/kroeger0x/gas-prices>\n\nTo be a DeFi investor, investing in DeFi related projects is possible without interacting directly with the DeFi protocol. You can, as an investor, do this through Centralised exchanges, which can prove to be easier than directly interacting with DeFi. Therefore, you have the reassurance that reputable CEX’s conduct research and then vet projects before listing.\n\nBelow are 3 DeFi Protocols All 3 have a growing user base with robust unique features.\n\n**AAVE**\n\nAAVE is DeFi’s closest protocol to a Bank. It uses a money market system to enable borrowing & lending. It has a native token called $AAVE, which rewards users in staking rewards and governance on its protocol.\n\n**How it works**\n\nIn a traditional borrowing and lending system within a Bank, a lender is matched with a borrower. The Bank acts as the intermediate, managing this. However, on AAVE, the protocol enables automatic, automated loans via smart contracts, which cuts out this middle-man.\n\nFor AAVE process works by Lenders depositing their Crypto into liquidity pools. These Liquidity Pools are essentially pools of funds that enable depositors to earn an interest based on their deposit, which will be lent out of the Liquidity Pools.\n\nBorrowers pay the interest rate. This, however, depends on the availability of assets in a liquidity pool. Meaning, the rates fluctuate in accordance to meet demand and supply levels. Higher interest rates are used to incentivise lenders to deposit more & at a lower rate, the supply of assets is high.\n\nIn the traditional banking system, loans granted are **under collateralised**. However, with AAVE, the loans are **over collateralised**, meaning users need to deposit Collateral higher in value than the amount they borrow.\n\nA reminder that Collateral represents something pledged as security; in the case here, Crypto is held until repayment of a loan, in case of default. It is implemented across the Crypto market because it is volatile. So, AAVE takes precautions to employ a liquidation process if the collateral value falls under the collateralisation amount.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n*   Price: $304 USD, 707% (YOY)\n*   Market Cap: $4bn\n*   TVL: $16bn\n\n**Uniswap**\n\nUniswap is the most extensive Decentralised Exchange (DEX) & Automatic Market Maker (AMM) in DeFi. An AMM is a concept born out of DeFi.\n\n**How it works**\n\nInstead of using a classic order-book model of matching buyers and sellers to determine the price and execute trades, Uniswap uses a math equation ( x \\* y = k.), pools of tokens, and ETH to do the same job.\n\nThrough utilising any ERC-20 asset (Tokens built using Ethereum), users effectively provide liquidity to these pools (becoming LP’s) for each token offered to trade and then earn fees in $UNI in return.\n\n$UNI is Uniswap’s Governance token; its only function is as a Governance token to vote Uniswap Proposals put through by the community.\n\nMetrics\n\n*   Price: $27 USD, 909% (YOY)\n*   Market Cap: $14bn\n*   TVL:$ 4.9bn\n\n**DYDX**\n\nThe largest & most liquid Decentralised Derivatives Exchange (DDEX), built on Ethereum Blockchain. Offering perpetual & dated futures, margin trading and spot markets, aiming to be the best option for trading tools in DeFi.The token $DYDX is associated with the protocol and was given in an ‘airdrop’ to past exchange users. It is used for governance, mining rewards, staking pools and trading discounts.\n\nDerivatives make up a considerable slice of the Crypto market pie; their volume now matches that of top CeFI spot traded markets seen on big CEX providers like Coinbase; dYdX’s $5.9 billion in 24hours to Coinbase’s volume of $3.4 billion, one week ago.\n\nThe demand for DEX & DDEX’s is likely to continue growing as it becomes the only solution for some Crypto investors to invest & trade. Recent regional bans for buying and selling spot Crypto in China and the ban on Trading of Crypto-derivatives in the United Kingdom had significant positive knock-on effects for other providers. Participants from these regions will look for suitable alternatives to trade products that are now against the law in these regions.\n\n**How It works**\n\nBy standard DeFi design, dYdX is a lending and borrowing protocol. Although, dYdX goes a step further, becoming the go-to solution for Ethereum’s decentralised margin trading. It boasts liquidity on par with some of the largest CEX’s in the market.\n\nUsers Deposit funds into their Margin or Spot Account to start lending funds to the protocol, or borrowing, ETH, DAI, and USDC currently supported. Users trade from their accounts directly afters their deposits from their wallets. In which the deposit from these wallets is then used to trade against different pairs. Users can withdraw their funds again back into their wallets.\n\nLike most DeFi financial products, dYdX is readily available for anyone to use, with its users’ assets managed & run without intermediates by utilising Smart contract applications.\n\nMetrics:\n\n*   Price: $22.4 USD, (YOY) N/A\n*   Market Cap: $1.25 Billion\n*   TVL: 980 Million\n\n**Timeline Of DeFi**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*DqQwDsQorPItHvK04iwwhw.png)\n\nSource: <https://blog.makerdao.com/a-brief-history-of-decentralized-finance-defi/>\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*lzUPxzmyC2tricNmsiUnew.png)\n\nSource: <https://blog.makerdao.com/a-brief-history-of-decentralized-finance-defi/>\n\n**FAQs**\n\nHow do I get started with DeFI?\n\nDirectly set up a wallet. A cryptocurrency wallet installed on your browser, Or Sign up to a CEX that offers DeFI tokens.\n\nIs DeFI safe?\n\nIt depends on the protocol and the degree of quality to produce the code to make smart contracts.

{"id": "4-G_Gn8ED6juWKrzDCAjuc-4GvOC7V7Mtk0Kr_ZAW3k", "title": "Negative Thinking in Decision Making", "body": "*(open beta v0.2)*\n\n*Any feedback is welcome and greatly appreciated.*\n\n**Introduction**\n\nNegative thinking in the context of this essay means focusing on negative factors rather than positive factors when evaluating options and making decisions. While positive thinking identifies what works and duplicates them, negative thinking determines what does not work and avoids them. For example, a negative thinking basketball coach prioritizes defense over offense. The emphasis is on conceding less points instead of scoring more. The popular maxim “defense wins championships” manifests the application of negative thinking in basketball. In this essay, I hope to analyze this rather counterintuitive, underdiscussed framework of thinking in three parts, (1) its logical basis, (2) its earnest supporters, and (3) its everyday applications.\n\n**Logical Basis**\n\nLogically speaking, negative thinking is sounder than positive thinking, because negative thinking is based on deduction while positive thinking is based on induction. The difference between deduction and induction is that, if the premises are true, the conclusion of a deductive inference must be true while the conclusion of an inductive inference is only probable. In other words, negative thinking delivers definitive conclusions while positive thinking returns only probable results.\n\nA prime use case of negative thinking in philosophy is Karl Popper’s falsification theory. Popper is commonly regarded as one of the best philosophers of science. His main contribution is how to demarcate science from non-science. The criterion is falsifiability. Scientific theories or propositions must be falsifiable by possible empirical evidence. Albert Einstein’s relativity theory is science, because it contains implications that, if tested false, would have falsified the theory. On the other hand, Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalysis is not science, because it is not falsifiable. Freud’s theory is compatible with any empirical observation of the human mind. Deductive reasoning forms the logical foundation of Popper’s falsification theory. If a scientific theory is true, then its implications should all be true. Reversely, if an implication turns out to be false, the theory must be false. \n\nContrary to negative thinking, positive thinking suffers from the so-called “problem of induction.” Induction is a method of reasoning in which a general principle is drawn upon a series of observations. For example, given weather records showing that it has rained every year in New York City, one can, by inductive reasoning, claim that it rains in New York City in any given year. David Hume, a prominent Scottish philosopher, argues that such enumerative induction has no rational basis, because there’s always the possibility to discover counter-examples. In the 16th century, as all available observations of swans found them to be white in Europe, it was widely accepted that swans were white. However, when a team of Dutch explorers discovered black swans in Western Australia, the white swan theory was obliterated. Similarly, the New-York-City-rains theory will hold true until the year that it does not rain.\n\nThere exists a permanent asymmetry at the base level between negative and positive thinking. It is logically impossible to validate a theory or option by reference to examples, but a single counter-example conclusively denies the corresponding theory or option. Proving something is hard. Disproving something is easy. Positive thinking is indecisive. Negative thinking is conclusive. Try to think of something that definitely will happen tomorrow, for example, the sun will rise. Then think of something that definitely will not happen, such as Julius Caesar will not resurrect. Which one is more likely? From a pure logical point of view, negative thinking is more certain than positive thinking.\n\n**Earnest Supporters**\n\nNegative thinking has many advocates in addition to Popper and Hume. Aristotle argues in the Nichomachean Ethics, “not pleasure, but freedom from pain, is what the wise man will aim at.” Goethe compares negative thinking with positive thinking in the Elective Affinities and believes that “to desire to get rid of an evil is a definite object, but to desire a better fortune than one has is blind folly.” Arthur Schopenhauer asks his readers to “direct our aim to, not toward securing what is pleasurable…but toward avoiding \\[life’s\\] innumerable evils.” The quote by Aristotle is also deemed by Schopenhauer to be “the first and foremost rule for the wise conduct of life.” \n\nThese brilliant minds encourage avoiding pain rather than seeking pleasure because they are thinking negatively. For example, being healthy is a pleasure while being unhealthy is a pain. You may have countless instances demonstrating why you are healthy. Your body mass index is perfect. Your doctor admires your annual physical exam results. You finish half-marathons under one and a half hour with ease. But the aggregation of all these instances cannot logically establish that you are healthy. There could be a hidden complication that neither you nor your doctor or the most advanced medical machine knows. On the other hand, the evidence of the existence of any problems conclusively confirms that you are not healthy. Therefore, instead of maximizing “being healthy”, one should minimize “being unhealthy.”\n\nMore recently, Charlie Munger and Jeff Bezos are also earnest supporters of negative thinking. One of Munger’s most famous quotes is that “all I want to know is where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there.” Compared to going after how he would live, Munger is more interested in staying away from where he would die. Munger also explicitly follows Aristotle’s life principle. He claims “some people collect stamps. I collect insanities and absurdities. Then I avoid them, and it’s amazing how well it works.”\n\nWhen Jeff Bezos was asked why he decided to leave Wall Street to start Amazon, Bezos explained that he based his decision on a “regret minimization framework.”  Bezos’ decision-making was aimed to minimize future regret instead of pursuing “wine, women and sun”. Again, avoiding pain instead of seeking pleasure.\n\n**Everyday Applications**\n\nGiven the complexity of this world, it is very likely to suffer from the “one more rule.” No matter how complex a model or an analysis is, there is always one more dataset or metric that can be added to the analysis to make it more complete. It is impossible to include everything. This is because one is thinking positively, not negatively. It is irrational to look for positive proof of why something might work. Find out what might not work and avoid them.\n\nThe primary manifestation of negative thinking in sports is a defense first mindset. In investing, it is not losing money. Warren Buffet’s fundamental principle is, “Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1.” Stephen Schwarzman in his book What It Takes cites “don’t lose money” as the number one rule at Blackstone. Schwarzman demands his team to objectively assess the risks of every opportunity before making investment decisions. The optimal way to make more money is not losing money? Odd, but true. The idea is to discourage reckless risk-taking for potential reward. A negative thinking investor seeks to minimize his loss rather than maximize his gain. Profit-seeking and risk-taking can be illusional and self-reinforcing. Long-Term Capital Management was a successful business making billions until it wasn’t. \n\nThinking negatively does not mean to entirely ignore positive factors. Similar to the debate between materialism and idealism, the key is to distinguish the primary from the secondary. If stuck between two promising stocks, try to calculate the downsides and pick the one that is less likely to lead to liquidation. Only if the negative factors are indistinguishable, then take a look at the positives and choose the one with higher expected value.\n\nIn investing and in life alike, given a set of options, a rational mind must deploy the process of elimination. Good options can turn out to be bad, but bad options are much less likely to become good, unless prior knowledge is mistaken or has changed. Instead of figuring out the best option in the set, identify the worst and eliminate. Still left with more than one choice after rigorous elimination? Leave the rest to chance and pick randomly. Note the magic of negative thinking. Now you can attribute all your successes to chance and all your failures to your lack of ability. After weeding out the negatives, you honestly do not know exactly which element makes an option superior. Although some explanations can always be made ex post, hindsight is 20/20 after all. On the other hand, the failure is on you for being unable to realize the negating factor that would have steered you away.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSherlock Holmes teaches Watson that “when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” Given an option set, positive thinking can trick you into making biased decisions, while negative thinking enables you to eliminate bad choices, and whatever remains is more likely to thrive.", "timestamp": 1635483736, "digest": "LlI2In-Qopba6CPe5TdFaXV7LNV-K3BUtuOwOl98lFQ", "contributor": "0xB9CF0555599994482C03662977fdeA8F40dB7003"}

The Daba Mountains stand in the north, the Wu Mountains in the east, the Wuling Mountains in the southeast, and the Dalou Mountains in the south. The whole area slopes down from north and south towards the Yangtze River valley, with sharp rises and falls. The area is featured by a large geological massif, of mountains and hills, with large sloping areas at different heights.\\[43\\] Typical karst landscape is common in this area, and stone forests, numerous collections of peaks, limestone caves and valleys can be found in many places. The Longshuixia Gap (龙水峡地缝), with its natural arch-bridges, has made the region a popular tourist attraction. The Yangtze River runs through the whole area from west to east, covering a course of 665 km (413 mi), cutting through the Wu Mountains at three places and forming the well-known Three Gorges: the Qutang, the Wuxia and the Xiling gorges.\\[44\\] Coming from northwest and running through \"the Jialing Lesser Three Gorges\" of Libi, Wentang and Guanyin, the Jialing River joins the Yangtze in Chongqing.\\[45\\]\n\n### Li Bai's Poem of Chongqing's Baidi Cheng\n\n> ### Leaving at dawn the White Emperor crowned with cloud,I've sailed a thousand li through canyons in a day.With the monkeys' adieus the riverbanks are loud,My skiff has left ten thousand mountains far away.\n\n### The central urban area of Chongqing, or Chongqing proper, is a city of unique features.

With its special topographical features, Chongqing has the unique scenery of mountains, rivers, forests, springs, waterfalls, gorges, and caves. Li Bai, a famous poet of the Tang dynasty, was inspired by the natural scenery and wrote this epigram.\\[47\\]\n\n### Specifically, the central urban area is located on a huge folding area. Yuzhong District, Nan'an District, Shapingba District and Jiangbei District are located right on a big syncline.

The municipality's top leader is the secretary of the municipal committee of the Communist Party of China (\"party chief\"), which, since 2007, has also held a seat on the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, the country's second highest governing council. Under the Soviet-inspired nomenklatura system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the Communist Party, and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include He Guoqiang, Wang Yang, Bo Xilai, Zhang Dejiang, and Sun Zhengcai, the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal party standing committee, the de facto top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.\n\n### The municipal People's Government serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the mayor, who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.\\[57\\]\n\n### The municipality also has a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (zhengxie) meets at around the same time as the People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues.

After the Japanese captured Qiqihar in the Jiangqiao Campaign, the Japanese 4th Mixed Brigade moved toward Harbin, closing in from the west and south. Bombing and strafing by Japanese aircraft forced the Chinese army to retreat from Harbin. Within a few hours, the Japanese occupation of Harbin was complete.\\[46\\]\n\n### With the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo, the so-called \"pacification of Manchukuo\" began, as volunteer armies continued to fight the Japanese. Harbin became a major operations base for the infamous medical experimenters of Unit 731, who killed people of all ages and ethnicities. All these units were known collectively as the Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department of the Kwantung Army.\\[47\\] The main facility of the Unit 731 was built in 1935 at Pingfang District, approximately 24 km (15 mi) south of Harbin urban area at that time.\\[48\\] Between 3,000 and 12,000 citizens including men, women, and children\\[49\\]\\[50\\]—from which around 600 every year were provided by the Kempeitai\\[51\\]—died during the human experimentation conducted by Unit 731 at the camp based in Pingfang alone, which does not include victims from other medical experimentation sites.\\[52\\] Almost 70 percent of the victims who died in the Pingfang camp were Chinese, including both civilian and military.\\[53\\] Close to 30 percent of the victims were Russian.\\[54\\] The Russian Fascist Party had the task of capturing \"unreliable\" Russians living in Harbin to hand over to Unit 731 to serve as the unwilling subjects of the gruesome experiments.\\[55\\] Some others were South East Asians and Pacific Islanders from then-colonies of the Empire of Japan, and a small number of the prisoners of war from the Allies of World War II\\[56\\] (although many more Allied POWs were victims of Unit 731 at other sites). Prisoners of war were subjected to vivisection without anesthesia, after being infected with various diseases.\\[57\\] Prisoners were injected with inoculations of disease, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects. Unit 731 and its affiliated units (Unit 1644 and Unit 100 among others) were involved in research, development, and experimental deployment of epidemic-creating biowarfare weapons in assaults against the Chinese populace (both civilian and military) throughout World War II. Human targets were also used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in different positions. Flame throwers were tested on humans. Humans were tied to stakes and used as targets to test germ-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, and explosive bombs.\\[58\\]\\[59\\] Twelve Unit 731 members were found guilty in the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials but later repatriated; others received secret immunity by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur before the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in exchange for biological warfare work in the Cold War for the American Force.\\[60\\]\n\n### Three different nationalities – Chinese, Japanese and Russian – on Kitaiskaia Street\n\n### Chinese revolutionaries including Zhao Shangzhi, Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, Zhao Yiman continued to struggle against the Japanese in Harbin and its administrative area, commanding the main anti-Japanese guerrilla army-Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army—which was originally organized by the Manchurian branch of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The army was supported by the Comintern after the CPC Manchurian Provincial Committee was dissolved in 1936.\n\n### Anti–communist Russian Fascist Party Blackshirts, inspired by Italian Fascism, at Harbin Railway Station, 1934, waiting for arrival of their leader Konstantin Rodzaevsky\n\n### Under the Manchukuo régime and Japanese occupation, Harbin Russians had a difficult time. In 1935, the Soviet Union sold the Chinese Eastern Railway (KVZhD) to the Japanese, and many Russian emigres left Harbin (48133 of them were arrested during the Soviet Great Purge between 1936 and 1938 as \"Japanese spies\"\\[61\\]).\\[36\\] Most departing Russians returned to the Soviet Union, but a substantial number moved south to Shanghai or emigrated to the United States and Australia. By the end of the 1930s, the Russian population of Harbin had dropped to around 30,000.\\[62\\]\n\n### Many of Harbin's Jews (13,000 in 1929) fled after the Japanese occupation as the Japanese associated closely with militant anti-Soviet Russian Fascists, whose ideology of anti-Bolshevism and nationalism was laced with virulent anti-Semitism.\\[63\\] The Kwantung Army-sponsored and financed the Russian Fascist Party, which after 1932 started to play an over-sized role in the Harbin's Russian community as its thugs began to harness and sometimes killed those opposed to it. Most Jews left for Shanghai, Tianjin, and the British Mandate of Palestine.\\[64\\] In the late 1930s, some German Jews fleeing the Nazis moved to Harbin.

The cuisine of Harbin consists of European dishes and Northern Chinese dishes mainly typified by heavy sauce and deep-frying.\\[116\\]\n\n### One of the most famous dishes in Northeastern Chinese cuisine is Guo Bao Rou, a form of sweet and sour pork. It is a classic dish from Harbin which originated in the early 20th century in Daotai Fu (pinyin: Dàotái Fǔ).\\[117\\] It consists of a bite-sized pieces of pork in a potato starch batter, deep-fried until crispy. They are then lightly coated in a variation of a sweet and sour sauce, made from freshly prepared syrup, rice vinegar, sugar, flavoured with ginger, cilantro, sliced carrot and garlic. The Harbin Guobaorou is distinct from that of other areas of China, such as Liaoning, where the sauce may be made using either tomato ketchup or orange juice. Rather the Harbin style is dominated by the honey and ginger flavours and has a clear or honey yellow colour. Originally the taste was fresh and salty. In order to fete foreign guests, Zheng Xingwen, the chef of Daotai Fu, altered the dish into a sweet and sour taste. Usually, people prefer to go to several small or middle size restaurants to enjoy this dish, because it is difficult to handle the frying process at home.\\[117\\]\n\n### Demoli Stewed Live Fish is one among other notable dishes in Harbin, which is originated in a village named Demoli on the expressway from Harbin to Jiamusi. The village is now Demoli Service Area on Harbin-Tongjiang Expressway.\\[118\\] Stewed Chicken with Mushrooms, Braised Pork with Vermicelli, and quick-boil pork with Chinese sauerkraut are also typical authentic local dishes.\n\n### Since Russia had a strong influence on Harbin's history, the local cuisine of Harbin also contains Russian-style dishes and flavor.\\[12\\] There are several authentic Russian-style restaurants in Harbin, especially alongside the Zhongyang Street.\\[119\\]\n\n### Harbin-style smoked sausage\n\n### A popular regional specialty is Harbin-style smoked savory red sausage.\\[116\\] This product similar to Lithuanian and German sausages which are very mild, and they tend to be much more of European flavours than other Chinese sausages. In 1900, Russian merchant Ivan Yakovlevich Churin founded a branch in Harbin, which was named Churin Foreign trading company (pinyin: Qiulin Yanghang; Russian: Цюлинь Янхан) selling imported clothes, leather boots, canned foods, vodka, etc., and began to expand sales network in other cities in Manchuria.\\[120\\]\\[121\\] The influx of Europeans through the Trans-Siberian Railway and Chinese Eastern Railway, increased demand of European flavor food. In 1909, Churin's Sausage Factory was founded, and first produced European flavor sausage with the manufacturing process of Lithuanian staff. Since then European style sausage become a specialty of the city.\\[116\\]\n\n### A Russian style large round bread 大列巴 dà liě ba, derived from the Russian word khleb for \"bread\" is also produced in Harbin's bakeries. Dalieba is a miche like sourdough bread. First introduced to the locals by a Russian baker, it has been sold in bakeries in Harbin for over a hundred years.\\[122\\] Dalieba's sour and chewy taste is different from other traditional soft and fluffy Asian style breads in other parts of China.\n\n### Kvass, a Russia-originated fermented beverage made from black or regular rye bread,\\[123\\] is also popular in Harbin.\\[124\\] Madier (\"马迭尔\", derived from \"Modern\") ice-cream provided in the Zhongyang Street is also well known in northern China. This ice cream is made from a specific traditional recipe and it tastes a little salty but more sweet and milky.

{"id": "LeZIY3x6eajMWCo8JHd1X2WU3yUCQxg2DySWlsc42l0", "title": "Economy", "body": "### Chongqing is facing rapid urbanization. For instance, statistics\\[81\\] suggest that new construction added approximately 137,000 m2 (1,470,000 sq ft) daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space. In addition, more than 1,300 people moved into the city daily, adding almost 100 million yuan (US$15 million) to the local economy. Thus, Chongqing was separated from Sichuan province and made into a municipality in its own right on 14 March 1997\\[82\\] in order to accelerate its development and subsequently China's relatively poorer western areas (see China Western Development strategy).\\[83\\] An important industrial area in western China,\\[84\\]\n\n### Traditionally, due to its geographic inaccessibility, Chongqing and Sichuan have both been important military bases in weapons research and development.\\[85\\] Even though Chongqing's industries are diversified, unlike eastern China, its export sector is small due to its relatively disadvantageous inland location. Instead, factories producing local-oriented consumer goods such as processed food, cars, chemicals, textiles, machinery, sports equipment and electronics are common.\n\n### Chongqing is China's third largest motor vehicle production center and the largest for motorcycles. In 2007, it had an annual output capacity of 1 million cars and 8.6 million motorcycles.\\[86\\] Leading makers of cars and motorbikes includes China's fourth biggest automaker; Changan Automotive Corp and Lifan Hongda Enterprise, as well as Ford Motor Company, with the US car giant having 3 plants in Chongqing. The municipality is also one of China's nine largest iron and steel producers in China as well as one of its three major aluminum producers. Important manufacturers include Chongqing Iron and Steel Company (重庆钢铁股份有限公司) and Southwest Aluminum (西南鋁業), which is Asia's largest aluminum plant.\\[87\\] Agriculture remains significant. Rice and fruits, especially oranges, are the area's main produce. Natural resources are also abundant with large deposits of coal, natural gas, and more than 40 kinds of minerals such as strontium and manganese. Coal reserves total approximately 4,800,000,000 metric tons (4.7×109 long tons; 5.3×109 short tons). Chuandong Natural Gas Field is China's largest inland gas field with deposits of around 270 billion m3 – more than 1/5 of China's total. Has China's largest reserve of strontium (China has the world's 2nd biggest strontium deposit). Manganese is mined in the Xiushan area. Although the mining sector has been denounced as heavily polluting and unsafe.\\[88\\] Chongqing is also planned to be the site of a 10 million ton capacity refinery operated by CNPC (parent company of PetroChina) to process imported crude oil from the Sino-Burma pipelines. The pipeline itself, though not yet finished, will eventually run from Sittwe (in Myanmar's western coast) through Kunming in Yunnan before reaching Chongqing\\[89\\] and it will provide China with fuels sourced from Myanmar, the Middle East and Africa. Recently, there has been a drive to move up the value chain by shifting towards high technology and knowledge intensive industries resulting in new development zones such as the Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ).\\[90\\] Chongqing's local government is hoping through the promotion of favorable economic policies for the electronics and information technology sectors, that it can create a 400 billion RMB high technology manufacturing hub which will surpass its car industry and account for 25% of its exports.\\[91\\]\n\n### The city has also invested heavily in infrastructure to attract investment.\\[86\\]\\[92\\] The network of roads and railways connecting Chongqing to the rest of China has been expanded and upgraded reducing logistical costs. Furthermore, the nearby Three Gorges Dam which is the world's largest, supplies Chongqing with power and allows oceangoing ships to reach Chongqing's Yangtze River port.\\[93\\] These infrastructure improvements have led to the arrivals of numerous foreign direct investors (FDI) in industries ranging from car to finance and retailing; such as Ford,\\[94\\] Mazda,\\[95\\] HSBC,\\[96\\] Standard Chartered Bank,\\[97\\] Citibank,\\[98\\] Deutsche Bank,\\[99\\] ANZ Bank,\\[100\\] Scotiabank,\\[101\\] Wal-Mart,\\[102\\] Metro AG\\[103\\] and Carrefour,\\[104\\] among other multinational corporations.\n\n### Chongqing's nominal GDP in 2011 reached 1001.1 billion yuan (US$158.9 billion) while registering an annual growth of 16.4%. However, its overall economic performance is still lagging behind eastern coastal cities such as Shanghai. For instance, its per capita GDP was 22,909 yuan (US$3,301) which is below the national average. Nevertheless, there is a massive government push to transform Chongqing into the region's economic, trade, and financial center and use the municipality as a platform to open up the country's western interior to further development.\\[105\\]\n\n### Chongqing has been identified by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the November 2010 Access China White Paper as a member of the CHAMPS (Chongqing, Hefei, Anshan, Maanshan, Pingdingshan and Shenyang), an economic profile of the top 20 emerging cities in China.\\[106\\]", "timestamp": 1635488984, "digest": "bKiFcJ1YvXtdTt6iqXt8SFPZxRkPJF0lh4z25G0wGwE", "contributor": "0xBb4c4D6FEb2Ac5Fff60275823c09b6D9DCE7E766"}
{"id": "nD1zdDte2ZsGt1LvEITuJoo-M0MRw7Z-T46qjxce2aI", "title": "International city", "body": "### A small village in 1898 grew into the modern city of Harbin.\\[27\\]\\[28\\] Polish engineer Adam Szydłowski drew plans for the city following the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which the Russian Empire had financed.\\[14\\] The Russians selected Harbin as the base of their administration over this railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. The railways were largely constructed by Russian engineers and indentured workers. The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the Trans-Siberian Railway: substantially reducing the distance from Chita to Vladivostok and also linking the new port city of Dalny (Dalian) and the Russian naval base of Port Arthur (Lüshun). The settlement founded by the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway quickly turned into a \"boomtown\", growing into a city within five years. The majority of settlers in Harbin came from southern Ukraine (Russian Empire). In addition to Ukrainians, there were many Russians, Jews, Poles, Georgians, and Tatars.\\[29\\]\n\n### The city was intended as a showcase for Russian imperialism in Asia and the American scholar Simon Karlinsky, who was born in Harbin in 1924 into a Russian Jewish family, wrote that in Harbin \"the buildings, boulevards, and parks were planned—well before the October Revolution—by distinguished Russian architects and also by Swiss and Italian town planners\", giving the city a very European appearance.\\[29\\] Starting in the late 19th century, a mass influx of Han Chinese arrived in Manchuria, and taking advantage of the rich soils, founded farms which soon turned Manchuria into the \"breadbasket of China\" while others went to work in the mines and factories of Manchuria, which become one of the first regions of China to industrialize. Harbin became one of the main points through which food and industrial products were shipped out of Manchuria. A sign of Harbin's wealth was that a theater had established during its first decade and in 1907 the play K zvezdam by Leonid Andreyev had its premiere there.\\[30\\]  \n\n### St. Nicolas Orthodox, a Russian Orthodox church in Harbin, circa 1940, demolished during the Cultural Revolution\n\n### During the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Manchuria. Following Russia's defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies. Churches were rebuilt for Russian Orthodox, Lutheran/German Protestant, and Polish Catholic Christians. Chinese capitalists also established businesses, especially in brewing, food, and textiles. Harbin became the economic hub of northeastern China and an international metropolis.\\[26\\]\n\n### The rapid growth of the city challenged the public healthcare system. The worst-ever recorded outbreak of pneumonic plague was spread to Harbin through the Trans-Manchurian railway from the border trade port of Manzhouli.\\[31\\] The plague lasted from late autumn of 1910 to spring 1911 and killed 1,500 Harbin residents (mostly ethnic Chinese), or about five percent of its population at the time.\\[32\\] This turned out to be the beginning of the large so-called Manchurian plague pandemic which ultimately claimed 60,000 victims. In the winter of 1910, Dr. Wu Lien-teh (later the founder of Harbin Medical University) was given instructions from the Foreign Office, Peking, to travel to Harbin to investigate the plague. Dr. Wu asked for imperial sanction to cremate plague victims, as cremation of these infected victims turned out to be the turning point of the epidemic. The suppression of this plague pandemic changed medical progress in China. Bronze statues of Dr. Wu Lien-teh are built in Harbin Medical University to remember his contributions in promoting public health, preventive medicine, and medical education.\\[33\\]\n\n### The first generation of Harbin Russians were mostly the builders and employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They moved to Harbin in order to work on the railroad. At the time Harbin was not an established city. The city was almost built from scratch by the builders and early settlers. Houses were constructed, furniture and personal items were brought in from Russia. After the Manchurian plague epidemic, Harbin's population continued to increase sharply, especially inside the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. In 1913 the Chinese Eastern Railway census showed its ethnic composition as: Russians – 34,313, Chinese (that is, including Hans, Manchus etc.) – 23,537, Jews – 5,032, Poles – 2556, Japanese – 696, Germans – 564, Tatars – 234, Latvians – 218, Georgians – 183, Estonians – 172, Lithuanians – 142, Armenians – 124; there were also Karaims, Ukrainians, Bashkirs, and some Western Europeans. In total, 68,549 citizens of 53 nationalities, speaking 45 languages.\\[34\\] Research shows that only 11.5 percent of all residents were born in Harbin.\\[35\\] By 1917, Harbin's population exceeded 100,000, with over 40,000 of them being ethnic Russians.\\[36\\]\n\n### Harbin's Kitayskaya Street (Russian for \"Chinese Street\"), now Zhongyang Street (Chinese for \"Central Street\"), before 1945\n\n### After Russia's Great October Socialist Revolution in November 1917, more than 100,000 defeated Russian White Guards and refugees retreated to Harbin, which became a major center of White Russian émigrés and the largest Russian enclave outside the Soviet Union.\\[36\\] Karlinsky noted that a major difference with the Russian émigrés who arrived in Harbin was: \"Unlike the Russian émigrés who went to Paris or Prague or even to Shanghai, the new residents of Harbin were not a minority surrounded by a foreign population. They found themselves instead in an almost totally Russian city, populated mainly by people with roots in the south of European Russia.\"\\[29\\] The city had a Russian school system, as well as publishers of Russian-language newspapers and journals. The Russian Harbintsy\\[a\\] community numbered around 120,000 at its peak in the early 1920s.\\[37\\] Many of Harbin's Russians were wealthy, which sometimes confused foreign visitors who expected them to be poor, with for instance the American writer Harry A. Franck in his 1923 book Wanderings in North China writing the Russian \"ladies as well gowned as at the Paris races \\[who\\] strolled with men faultlessly garbed by European standards\", leading him to wonder how they had achieved this \"deceptive appearance\".\\[38\\]\n\n### The Harbin Institute of Technology was established in 1920 as the Harbin Sino-Russian School for Industry to educate railway engineers via a Russian method of instruction. Students could select from two majors at the time: Railway Construction or Electric Mechanic Engineering. On 2 April 1922, the school was renamed the Sino-Russian Industrial University. The original two majors eventually developed into two major departments: the Railway Construction Department and the Electric Engineering Department. Between 1925 and 1928 the university's Rector was Leonid Aleksandrovich Ustrugov, the Russian Deputy Minister of Railways under Nicholas II before the Russian Revolution, Minister of Railways under Admiral Kolchak's government and a key figure in the development of the Chinese Eastern Railway.\n\n### The Russian community in Harbin made it their mission to preserve the pre-revolutionary culture of Russia. The city had numerous Russian language newspapers, journals, libraries, theaters, and two opera companies.\\[39\\] One of the famous Russian poets in Harbin was Valery Pereleshin, who started publishing his intensely homoerotic poetry in 1937 and was also one of the few Russian writers in Harbin who learned Mandarin.\\[40\\] The subject of Pereleshin's poetry caused problems with the Russian Fascist Party, and led Pereleshin to leave Harbin for Shanghai, and ultimately to the United States.\\[40\\] Not all of the Russian newspapers were of high quality, with Karlinsky calling Nash put', the newspaper of the Russian Fascist Party \"the lowest example of gutter journalism that Harbin had ever seen\".\\[41\\] Nikolai Baikov, a Russian writer in Harbin was known for his novels of exile life in that city together with his accounts of his travels across Manchuria and the folklore of its Manchu and Chinese population.\\[41\\] Boris Yulsky, a young Russian writer who published his short stories in the newspaper Rubezh was considered to be a promising writer whose career was cut short when he gave up literature for activism in the Russian Fascist Party and cocaine addiction.\\[41\\] Moya-tvoya (mine – yours), a pidgin language that was a combination of Russian and Mandarin Chinese that had developed in the 19th century when Chinese went to work in Siberia, was considered essential by the Chinese businesspeople of Harbin.\\[42\\] \n\n### In the early 1920s, according to Chinese scholars' recent studies, over 20,000 Jews lived in Harbin.\\[43\\] After 1919, Dr. Abraham Kaufman played a leading role in Harbin's large Russian Jewish community.\\[44\\] The Republic of China discontinued diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1920, so many Russians found themselves stateless. When the Chinese Eastern Railway and government in Beijing announced in 1924 that they agreed the railroad would only employ Russian or Chinese nationals, the emigres were forced to announce their ethnic and political allegiance. Most accepted Soviet citizenship.\n\n### The Chinese warlord Zhang Xueliang, the \"Young Marshal\" seized the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929. The Soviet military force quickly put an end to the crisis and forced the Nationalist Chinese to accept the restoration of joint Soviet-Chinese administration of the railway.\\[45\\]", "timestamp": 1635489334, "digest": "ifFO2pP6p8pfTkAD5lfieLOiwEV5O_9TVVU0JNM0b7o", "contributor": "0x83f514449f9bE5647D62c981b73beBc782Bd84E2"}

On 28 April 1946, the communist government of Harbin was established, making the 700,000-citizen-city the first large city governed by the communists.\\[26\\] During the short occupation of Harbin by the Soviet Army (August 1945 to April 1946), thousands of Russian emigres who had been identified as members of the Russian Fascist Party and fled communism after the Russian October Revolution,\\[37\\] were forcibly deported to the Soviet Union. After 1952 the Soviet Union launched a second wave of immigration back to Russia.\\[37\\] By 1964, the Russian population in Harbin had been reduced to 450.\\[62\\] The rest of the European community (Russians, Germans, Poles, Greeks, etc.) emigrated during the years 1950–54 to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel, and the US, or were repatriated to their home countries.\\[37\\] By 1988 the original Russian community numbered just thirty, all of them elderly. Modern Russians living in Harbin mostly moved there in the 1990s and 2000s, and have no relation to the first wave of emigration.\\[citation needed\\]\n\n### Harbin was one of the key construction cities of China during the First Five-Year Plan period from 1951 to 1956. 13 of the 156 key construction projects were aid-constructed by the Soviet Union in Harbin. This project made Harbin an important industrial base of China. During the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1961, Harbin experienced a very tortuous development course as several Sino-Soviet contracts were cancelled by the Soviet Union.\\[67\\] During the Cultural Revolution many foreign and Christian things were uprooted. On 23 August 1966, Red Guards stormed into St. Nicholas Cathedral, burned its icons on the streets while chanting xenophobic slogans before destroying the church.\\[68\\] As the normal economic and social order was seriously disrupted, Harbin's economy also suffered from serious setbacks. One of the main reasons of this setback is with its Soviet ties deteriorating and the Vietnam War escalating, China became concerned of a possible nuclear attack. Mao Zedong ordered an evacuation of military and other key state enterprises away from the northeastern frontier, with Harbin being the core zone of this region, bordering the Soviet Union. During this Third Front Development Era of China, several major factories of Harbin were relocated to Southwestern Provinces including Gansu, Sichuan, Hunan and Guizhou, where they would be strategically secure in the event of a possible war. Some major universities of China were also moved out of Harbin, including Harbin Military Academy of Engineering (predecessor of Changsha's National University of Defense Technology) and Harbin Institute of Technology (Moved to Chongqing in 1969 and relocated to Harbin in 1973).\\[69\\]\n\n### Huang Shan Jewish Cemetery of Harbin\n\n### National economy and social service have obtained significant achievements since the Chinese economic reform first introduced in 1979. Harbin holds the China Harbin International Economic and Trade Fair each year since 1990.\\[26\\] Harbin once housed one of the largest Jewish communities in the Far East before World War II. It reached its peak in the mid-1920s when 25,000 European Jews lived in the city. Among them were the parents of Ehud Olmert, the former Prime Minister of Israel.

Although the official start date is 5 January each year, in practice, many of the sculptures can be seen before. While there are ice sculptures throughout the city, there are two main exhibition areas: enormous snow sculptures at Sun Island (Taiyang Dao, a AAAAA-rated recreational area on the opposite side of the Songhua River from the city) and the separate \"Ice and Snow World\" that operates each night with lights switched on, illuminating the sculptures from both inside and outside. Ice and Snow World features illuminated full-size buildings made from blocks of 2–3 feet thick crystal clear ice directly taken from the Songhua River which passes through the city. The sculptures inside the exhibition ground takes 15,000 workers to work for 16 days. In early December, ice artisans cut 120,000 cubic metres (4.2 million cubic feet) of ice blocks from Songhua river's frozen surface as raw materials for the ice sculptures' show.\\[128\\] Massive ice buildings, large-scale snow sculptures, ice slides, festival food and drinks can also be found in several parks and major avenues in the city. Winter activities in the festival include Yabuli Alpine Skiing, snow mobile driving, winter-swimming in Songhua River, and the traditional ice-lantern exhibition in Zhaolin Garden, which was first held in 1963.\\[129\\] Snow carving and ice and snow recreations are famous nationwide, especially among Asian countries including Korea, Japan, Thailand and Singapore.\\[128\\]\n\n### The \"Harbin International Ice and Snow Festival\" is one of the four largest ice and snow festivals in the world, along with Japan's Sapporo Snow Festival, Canada's Quebec City Winter Carnival, and Norway's Holmenkollen Ski Festival.\\[12\\]\n\n### Every November, the city of Harbin sends teams of ice artisans to the United States to promote their unique art form.

Asset prices went up and the wealthier saw their wealth skyrocket.\n\nIn what way technology is deflationary? If we watch closely the circular loop of the economy it goes like this: a) governments print tons of money, b) prices go up, c) companies are in need of measures in order to survive, d) companies invest heavy into software and automation in order to replace people who engage in trivial and repeatable work, e)  unemployment numbers go up as people are substituted by software and robots, f) governments need to support the unemployed, g) governments print more money, h) return to b.\n\nLast Sunday I was having lunch with some friends and they were discussing in what ways the iPhone is the absolute tool for their work, entertainment and more. Just take a moment and think about it. In the same moment your iPhone is a phone, a camera, a laptop, a wallet and many more. All these by just paying 600-1000 euro (you can also make it with an older version :)). This is the way technology is deflationary, 600 euro instead of thousands.\n\nWhat is the conclusion in all of that? Inflation rates gonna stabilize in some way in the future but the circular loop will stay the same. The result will always be the same. The value will be captured by the ones having the assets.\n\nSo what you can do about this in order to make it? Make yourself the asset and let inflation drive your value up. Educate yourself in fields like web3.0, biotech and automation. Create products, build communities online and start selling to them. The next ten years will be transformational for our generation and we all have the same opportunities to create. Don’t get distracted by temporary shiny objects and dopamine-related experiences.

The planning and construction emulated major Chinese cities, in particular Bianjing (Kaifeng), although the Jin capital was smaller than its Northern Song prototype.\\[21\\] Huining Prefecture served as the first superior capital of the Jin empire until Wanyan Liang (the fourth emperor of Jin Dynasty) moved the capital to Yanjing (now Beijing) in 1153.\\[22\\] Liang even went so far as to destroy all palaces in his former capital in 1157.\\[22\\] Wanyan Liang's successor Wanyan Yong (Emperor Shizong) restored the city and established it as a secondary capital in 1173.\\[23\\] Ruins of the Shangjing Huining Prefecture were discovered and excavated about 2 km (1.2 mi) from present-day Acheng's central urban area.\\[20\\]\\[24\\] The site of the old Jin capital ruins is a national historic reserve, and includes the Jin Dynasty History Museum.

In the 17th century, the Manchus used building materials from Huining Prefecture to construct their new stronghold in Alchuka.

By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.\\[17\\]\n\n### In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou.\\[18\\] Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark.\n\n### It is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (西府) at the time,\\[19\\] it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu.\\[20\\] Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name.\\[21\\] Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\n\n### In 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\n\n### Arab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time.\\[22\\] There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols.\\[23\\] The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou.\\[24\\] According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population.\\[25\\] Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills.\\[26\\] During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\\[27\\]\n\n### \"Xi Hu Landscape\" by Li Song (1190–1264), showing the Leifeng Pagoda in the Southern Song Dynasty.\n\n### Hangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132,\\[28\\] when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin–Song wars.\\[29\\] The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127.\\[30\\]\\[31\\] Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129.\\[30\\] The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous.\\[32\\] Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\\[33\\]\n\n### \"Moon over the Peaceful Lake in Autumn\", one of the Ten Scenes of the Xi Hu\n\n### From 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (臨安). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\n\n### Numerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031–1095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.\\[34\\]\n\n### Dreaming of the Tiger Spring, the burial place of monk Jigong.\n\n### During the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.\\[35\\]\\[36\\]\n\n### Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\n\n### Hangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song.\\[37\\] The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.", "timestamp": 1635489999, "digest": "lFkoHAsMBhfIjmO1yvFU4FMC3HAeccv8QC10KFaIkDw", "contributor": "0x32c240AC132267cF968C0a9D86277C89aFaaB81D"}

Regional routes reach Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.\n\n## Railway\n\n## Hangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East station (colloquially \"East Station\" 东站, official national rail translation: Hangzhoudong Station). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed services to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The metro station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou railway station (colloquially the \"City Station\" Chinese: 城站) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.\n\n## A second high-speed rail channel through Hangzhou is under construction along with another major station, Hangzhou West.\n\n## Direct trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing and more than 100 daily services to Shanghai; they reach as far as Ürümqi. The China Railway High-Speed service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), shortening the duration of the 202 km (126 mi) trip to only 45 minutes.\\[93\\]\n\n## Coach\n\n## Central (to the east of the city centre, taking the place of the former east station), north, south, and west long-distance coach stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.\n\n## Bus\n\n## Hangzhou has an efficient bus network, consisting of a modern fleet of diesel, hybrid and electric buses, as well as trolleybuses. Hangzhou was once known for its extensive bus rapid transit network expanding from downtown to many suburban areas through dedicated bus lanes on some of the busiest streets in the city. However, as of mid-2021, all but one BRT routes and feeding routes had closed or been transformed to regular routes. Only route B1 is still in operation.\\[94\\]\n\n## Cycle hire\n\n## Bicycles and electric scooters are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive public bike rental system, the Hangzhou Public Bicycle system. A dock-and-station system similar to those in Paris and London is adopted and users can hire a bicycle with IC card or mobile phone application. Journeys within 60 minutes are free of charge.\n\n## Metro\n\n## Hangzhou Metro has a network of 323km as of mid-2021, not including the Hangzhou-Haining Intercity Railway which has a length of 46km. Major expansion plans continue. It is the 17th city in China to have a rapid rail transit system. In 2018, the State Council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games.\\[95\\] By then the Hangzhou Metro system is projected have a network of 617 km (383 mi) .\\[96\\]\n\n## The construction of the Metro started in March 2006, and Line 1 opened on November 24, 2012.\\[97\\] Line 1 connects city centre with suburbs. It run from Xianghu to Wenze Road with a branch to Lingping, which would later become part of Line 9. By June 2015, the southeast section of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (city centre and northwest Hangzhou) and Line 4 (east of Binjiang District) opened in 2018. Line 5/6/7/8 opened their first parts in 2019 and 2020\n\n## Taxis\n\n## Taxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations. In early 2011, 30 electric taxis were deployed in Hangzhou; 15 were Zotye Langyues and the other 15 were Haima Freemas. In April, however, one Zoyte Langyue caught fire, and all of the electric taxis were taken off the roads later that day. The city still intends to have a fleet of 200 electric taxis by the end of 2011.\\[98\\] In 2014, a large number of new electric taxis produced by Xihu-BYD (Xihu (westlake) is a local company which produced televisions in the past) were deployed.", "timestamp": 1635490190, "digest": "YRYcpOIetaEAF1rAbuRnMDaF3ZTLL2dYvWH3-_1KtWI", "contributor": "0x3BEf7ef366C3bD86200E6c91a3D54ecbA820815D"}

The metropolitan area of Nice extends beyond the administrative city limits, with a population of nearly 1 million\\[2\\]\\[3\\] on an area of 744 km2 (287 sq mi).\\[3\\] Located in the French Riviera, on the south east coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea, at the foot of the Alps, Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast and the second-largest city in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region after Marseille. Nice is approximately 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) from the principality of Monaco and 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the French–Italian border. Nice's airport serves as a gateway to the region.\n\n## The city is nicknamed Nice la Belle (Nissa La Bella in Niçard), meaning 'Nice the Beautiful', which is also the title of the unofficial anthem of Nice, written by Menica Rondelly in 1912. The area of today's Nice contains Terra Amata, an archaeological site which displays evidence of a very early use of fire 380,000 years ago. Around 350 BC, Greeks of Marseille founded a permanent settlement and called it Νίκαια, Nikaia, after Nike, the goddess of victory.\\[4\\] Through the ages, the town has changed hands many times. Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength. For centuries it was a dominion of Savoy, and was then part of France between 1792 and 1815, when it was returned to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia until its re-annexation by France in 1860.\n\n## The natural environment of the Nice area and its mild Mediterranean climate came to the attention of the English upper classes in the second half of the 18th century, when an increasing number of aristocratic families took to spending their winters there. In 1931 following its refurbishment the city's main seaside promenade, the Promenade des Anglais (\"Walkway of the English\") was inaugurated by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, and owes its name to visitors to the resort.\\[5\\] These included Queen Victoria along with her son Edward VII who spent winters there, and Nice born Henry Cavendish, who discovered hydrogen.\n\n## The clear air and soft light have particularly appealed to notable painters, such as Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Niki de Saint Phalle and Arman. Their work is commemorated in many of the city's museums, including Musée Marc Chagall, Musée Matisse and Musée des Beaux-Arts.\\[6\\] International writers have also been attracted and inspired by the city. Frank Harris wrote several books including his autobiography My Life and Loves in Nice. Friedrich Nietzsche spent six consecutive winters in Nice, and wrote Thus Spoke Zarathustra here. Additionally, Russian writer Anton Chekhov completed his play Three Sisters while living in Nice.\n\n## Nice's appeal extended to the Russian upper classes, Prince Nicholas Alexandrovich, heir apparent to Imperial Russia died in Nice and was a patron of the Russian Orthodox Cemetery, Nice where Princess Catherine Dolgorukova, morganatic wife of the Tsar Alexander II of Russia, is buried. As are General Dmitry Shcherbachev and General Nikolai Yudenich leaders of the anti-Communist White Movement.\n\n## Those interred in Nice at the Cimetière du Château, include celebrated jeweler Alfred Van Cleef, Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, founder of the Mercedes car company, film director Louis Feuillade, poet Agathe-Sophie Sasserno, dancer Carolina Otero, Asterix comics creator René Goscinny, The Phantom of the Opera author Gaston Leroux, French prime minister Léon Gambetta, and the first president of the International Court of Justice José Gustavo Guerrero.\n\n## Proclaimed a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2021 as \"Nice, Winter Resort Town of the Riviera\",\\[7\\] the city has the second largest hotel capacity in the country,\\[8\\] and it is one of its most visited cities, receiving 4 million tourists every year.\\[9\\] It also has the third busiest airport in France, after the two main Parisian ones.\\[10\\] It is the historical capital city of the County of Nice (French: Comté de Nice, Niçard: Countèa de Nissa).\\[11\\]", "timestamp": 1635490219, "digest": "4E2Xhq8n_NpCRAbYW7wmhk8YcvAwM1UUWi2_Ax27iP0", "contributor": "0x3BEf7ef366C3bD86200E6c91a3D54ecbA820815D"}

The city soon became one of the busiest trading ports on the Ligurian coast; but it had an important rival in the Roman town of Cemenelum, which continued to exist as a separate city until the time of the Lombard invasions.\\[11\\] The ruins of Cemenelum are in Cimiez, now a district of Nice.\n\n## Early development\n\n## See also: Roman Catholic Diocese of Nice and County of Nice\n\n## The Tower of St François\n\n## In the 7th century, Nice joined the Genoese League formed by the towns of Liguria. In 729 the city repulsed the Saracens; but in 859 and again in 880 the Saracens pillaged and burned it, and for most of the 10th century remained masters of the surrounding country.\\[11\\]\n\n## During the Middle Ages, Nice participated in the wars and history of Italy. As an ally of Pisa it was the enemy of Genoa, and both the King of France and the Holy Roman Emperor endeavoured to subjugate it; but in spite of this it maintained its municipal liberties. During the 13th and 14th centuries the city fell more than once into the hands of the Counts of Provence,\\[11\\] but it regained its independence even though related to Genoa.\n\n## Duchy of Savoy (red) and other independent Italian states in 1494\n\n## The medieval city walls surrounded the Old Town. The landward side was protected by the River Paillon, which was later covered over and is now the tram route towards the Acropolis. The east side of the town was protected by fortifications on Castle Hill. Another river flowed into the port on the east side of Castle Hill. Engravings suggest that the port area was also defended by walls. Under Monoprix in Place de Garibaldi are excavated remains of a well-defended city gate on the main road from Turin.\\[citation needed\\]\n\n## Duchy of Savoy\n\n## See also: Duchy of Savoy\n\n## Nice in 1575\n\n## Nice in 1624\n\n## In 1388, the commune placed itself under the protection of the Counts of Savoy.\\[11\\] Nice participated – directly or indirectly – in the history of Savoy until 1860.\\[citation needed\\]\n\n## The maritime strength of Nice now rapidly increased until it was able to cope with the Barbary pirates; the fortifications were largely extended and the roads to the city improved.\\[11\\] In 1561 Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy abolished the use of Latin as an administrative language and established the Italian language as the official language of government affairs in Nice.\n\n## During the struggle between Francis I and Charles V great damage was caused by the passage of the armies invading Provence; pestilence and famine raged in the city for several years.\\[11\\] In 1538, in the nearby town of Villeneuve-Loubet, through the mediation of Pope Paul III, the two monarchs concluded a ten years' truce.\\[14\\]\n\n## In 1543, Nice was attacked by the united Franco-Ottoman forces of Francis I and Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha, in the Siege of Nice; though the inhabitants repulsed the assault which followed the terrible bombardment, they were ultimately compelled to surrender, and Barbarossa was allowed to pillage the city and to carry off 2,500 captives. Pestilence appeared again in 1550 and 1580.\\[11\\]\n\n## In 1600, Nice was briefly taken by the Duke of Guise. By opening the ports of the county to all nations, and proclaiming full freedom of trade (1626), the commerce of the city was given great stimulus, the noble families taking part in its mercantile enterprises.\\[11\\]\n\n## Captured by Nicolas Catinat in 1691, Nice was restored to Savoy in 1696; but it was again besieged by the French in 1705, and in the following year its citadel and ramparts were demolished.\\[11\\]\n\n## Kingdom of Sardinia\n\n## The Treaty of Utrecht (1713) once more gave the city back to the Duke of Savoy, who was on that same occasion recognised as King of Sicily. In the peaceful years which followed, the \"new town\" was built. From 1744 until the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) the French and Spaniards were again in possession.\n\n## In 1775 the king, who in 1718 had swapped his sovereignty of Sicily for the Kingdom of Sardinia, destroyed all that remained of the ancient liberties of the commune. Conquered in 1792 by the armies of the First French Republic, the County of Nice continued to be part of France until 1814; but after that date it reverted to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia.\\[11\\]\n\n## French Nice\n\n## Nice in 1833\n\n## A map of the County of Nice showing the area of the Kingdom of Sardinia annexed in 1860 to France (light brown). The red area was already part of France before 1860.\n\n## Nice in 1914\n\n## After the Treaty of Turin was signed in 1860 between the Sardinian king and Napoleon III as a consequence of the Plombières Agreement, the county was again and definitively ceded to France as a territorial reward for French assistance in the Second Italian War of Independence against Austria, which saw Lombardy united with Piedmont-Sardinia. The cession was ratified by a regional referendum: over 25,000 electors out of a total of 30,700 were in favour of the attachment to France.\\[11\\] This event caused the Niçard exodus, that was the emigration of a quarter of the Niçard Italians to Italy.\\[15\\] Savoy was also transferred to the French crown by similar means. Giuseppe Garibaldi, born in Nice, opposed the cession to France, arguing that the ballot was rigged by the French. Many Italians from Nizza then moved to the Ligurian towns of Ventimiglia, Bordighera and Ospedaletti,\\[16\\] giving rise to a local branch of the movement of the Italian irredentists which considered the re-acquisition of Nice to be one of their nationalist goals.\n\n## In 1900, the Tramway de Nice electrified its horse-drawn streetcars and spread its network to the entire département from Menton to Cagnes-sur-Mer. By the 1930s more bus connections were added in the area.\\[citation needed\\] In the 1930s, Nice hosted international car racing in the Formula Libre (predecessor to Formula One) on the so-called Circuit Nice. The circuit started along the waterfront just south of the Jardin Albert I, then headed westward along the Promenade des Anglais followed by a hairpin turn at the Hotel Negresco to come back eastward and around the Jardin Albert I before heading again east along the beach on the Quai des Etats-Unis.\\[17\\]\n\n## As war broke out in September 1939, Nice became a city of refuge for many displaced foreigners, notably Jews fleeing the Nazi progression into Eastern Europe. From Nice many sought further shelter in the French colonies, Morocco and North and South America. After July 1940 and the establishment of the Vichy Regime, antisemitic aggressions accelerated the exodus, starting in July 1941 and continuing through 1942. On 26 August 1942, 655 Jews of foreign origin were rounded up by the Laval government and interned in the Auvare barracks. Of these, 560 were deported to Drancy internment camp on 31 August 1942. Due to the activity of the Jewish banker Angelo Donati and of the Capuchin friar Père Marie-Benoît the local authorities hindered the application of anti-Jewish Vichy laws.\\[18\\]\n\n## The first résistants to the new regime were a group of High School seniors of the Lycée de Nice, now Lycée Masséna \\[fr\\], in September 1940, later arrested and executed in 1944 near Castellane. The first public demonstrations occurred on 14 July 1942 when several hundred protesters took to the streets along the Avenue de la Victoire and in the Place Masséna. In November 1942 German troops moved into most of unoccupied France, but Italian troops moved into a smaller zone including Nice. A certain ambivalence remained among the population, many of whom were recent immigrants of Italian ancestry. However, the resistance gained momentum after the Italian surrender in 1943 when the German army occupied the former Italian zone. Reprisals intensified between December 1943 and July 1944, when many partisans were tortured and executed by the local Gestapo and the French Milice. Nice was also heavily bombarded by American aircraft in preparation for the Allied landing in Provence (1000 dead or wounded and more than 5600 people homeless) and famine ensued during summer 1944. American paratroopers entered the city on 30 August 1944 and Nice was finally liberated. The consequences of the war were heavy: the population decreased by 15%\\[citation needed\\] and economic life was totally disrupted.\n\n## In the second half of the 20th century, Nice enjoyed an economic boom primarily driven by tourism and construction. Two men dominated this period: Jean Médecin, mayor for 33 years from 1928 to 1943 and from 1947 to 1965, and his son Jacques, mayor for 24 years from 1966 to 1990. Under their leadership, there was extensive urban renewal, including many new constructions. These included the convention centre, theatres, new thoroughfares and expressways. The arrival of the Pieds-Noirs, refugees from Algeria after 1962 independence, also gave the city a boost and somewhat changed the make-up of its population and traditional views.\\[citation needed\\] By the late 1980s, rumors of political corruption in the city government surfaced; and eventually formal accusations against Jacques Médecin forced him to flee France in 1990. Later arrested in Uruguay in 1993, he was extradited back to France in 1994, convicted of several counts of corruption and associated crimes and sentenced to imprisonment.\n\n## On 16 October 1979, a landslide and an undersea slide caused two tsunamis that hit the western coast of Nice; these events killed between 8 and 23 people.\n\n## In February 2001, European leaders met in Nice to negotiate and sign what is now the Treaty of Nice, amending the institutions of the European Union.\\[19\\]\n\n## In 2003, local Chief Prosecutor Éric de Montgolfier alleged that some judicial cases involving local personalities had been suspiciously derailed by the local judiciary, which he suspected of having unhealthy contacts through Masonic lodges with the defendants. A controversial official report stated later that Montgolfier had made unwarranted accusations.\\[citation needed\\]\n\n## On 14 July 2016, a truck was deliberately driven into a crowd of people by Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel on the Promenade des Anglais. The crowd was watching a fireworks display in celebration of Bastille Day.\\[20\\] A total of 87 people were killed, including the perpetrator, who was shot dead by police.\\[21\\]\\[22\\] Another 434 were injured, with 52 in critical care and 25 in intensive care, according to the Paris prosecutor.\\[23\\] On 29 October 2020, a stabbing attack killed three people at the local Notre-Dame de Nice. One of the victims, a woman, was beheaded by the attacker.\\[24\\] Several additional victims were injured. The attacker, who was shot by the police, was taken into custody. The Islamic state claimed responsibility for both attacks.\\[25\\]\n\n## In 2021, the city was proclaimed a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as \"Nice, Winter Resort Town of the Riviera\".\\[7\\]", "timestamp": 1635490284, "digest": "-eqw_V6uCMRetboGvd9hiuy7oImVsy_GMukai_TwJow", "contributor": "0x6C036D6C488DC3959f902B1be839e3cf163365C4"}

Before Nice was urbanised, the coastline at Nice was just bordered by a deserted stretch of shingle beach (covered with large pebbles). The first houses were located on higher ground well away from the sea, as wealthy tourists visiting Nice in the 18th century did not come for the beach, but for the gentle winter weather.\\[citation needed\\] The areas close to the water were home to Nice's dockworkers and fishermen.\n\n### In the second half of the 18th century, many wealthy English people took to spending the winter in Nice, enjoying the panorama along the coast. This early aristocratic English colony conceived the building of a promenade with the leadership and financial support of Rev. Lewis Way.\\[26\\] With the initial promenade completed, the city of Nice, intrigued by the prospect, greatly increased the scope of the work. The Promenade was first called the Camin dei Anglès (the English Way) by the Niçois in their native dialect Nissart. In 1823, the promenade was named La Promenade des Anglais by the French, a name that would stick after the annexation of Nice by France in 1860.\\[27\\]\n\n### The Hotel Negresco on the Promenade des Anglais was named after Henri Negresco (1868–1920) who had the palatial hotel constructed in 1912. In keeping with the conventions of the time, when the Negresco first opened in 1913 its front opened on the side opposite the Mediterranean.\\[citation needed\\]\n\n### Another place worth mentioning is the small street parallel to the Promenade des Anglais, leading from Nice's downtown, beginning at Place Masséna and running parallel to the promenade in the direction of the airport for a short distance of about 4 blocks. This section of the city is referred to as the \"Zone Pietonne\", or \"Pedestrian Zone\". Cars are not allowed (with exception to delivery trucks), making this avenue a popular walkway.\n\n### Old Nice is also home to the Opéra de Nice. It was constructed at the end of the 19th century under the design of François Aune, to replace King Charles Félix's Maccarani Theater. Today, it is open to the public and provides a regular program of performances.", "timestamp": 1635490307, "digest": "HawYMJTc4G66p52pmu-Cm-UDryjN0X-toVQv6CYl648", "contributor": "0x6C036D6C488DC3959f902B1be839e3cf163365C4"}

Nice itself was established by the ancient Greeks. There was also an independent Roman city, Cemenelum, near Nice, where the hill of Cimiez is located. It is an archaeological site with treasures, of which only a small part has been excavated. The excavated site includes thermal baths, arenas and Roman road.\\[citation needed\\]\n\n### Since the 2nd century AD, the light of the city has attracted painters and sculptors such as Chagall, Matisse, Niki de Saint Phalle, Klein, Arman and Sosno. Nice inspired many composers and intellectuals in different countries e.g. Berlioz, Rossini, Nietzsche, etc.\n\n### Nice also has numerous museums of all kinds: Musée Marc Chagall, Musée Matisse (arenas of Cimiez containing Roman ruins), Musée des Beaux-Arts, Musée international d'Art naïf Anatole Jakovsky, Musée Terra-Amata, Museum of Asian Art, Musée d'art moderne et d'art contemporain which devotes much space to the well-known École of Nice ”), Museum of Natural History, Musée Masséna, Naval Museum and Galerie des Ponchettes.\n\n### Being a vacation resort, Nice hosts many festivals throughout the year, such as the Nice Carnival and the Nice Jazz Festival.\n\n### Nice has a distinct culture due to its unique history. The local language Niçard (Nissart) is an Occitan dialect (but some Italian scholars argue that it is a Ligurian dialect).\\[citation needed\\] It is still spoken by a substantial minority\\[citation needed\\]. Strong Italian and (to a lesser extent) Corsican influences make it more intelligible to speakers of Italian than other extant Provençal dialects.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FDscfo12lELc76a34wM3H.jpg?height=522&width=471)\n\n### In the past, Nice welcomed many immigrants from Italy (who continue to make up a large proportion of the population), as well as Spanish and Portuguese immigrants. However, in the past few decades immigration has been opened to include immigrants from all over the world, particularly those from former Northern and Western African colonies, as well as southeast Asia\\[citation needed\\]. Traditions are still alive, especially in folk music and dances, including the farandole – an open-chain community dance.\n\n### Since 1860 a cannon (based at the Château east of Old Nice) is shot at twelve o'clock sharp. The detonation can be heard almost all over the city. This tradition goes back to Sir Thomas Coventry, who intended to remind the citizens of having lunch on time.\\[41\\]\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E4et6SJT5r_WWf2Em-4Gy.jpg?height=744&width=1263)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635490403, "digest": "XYF_L60wyZSVtSKa2yalTHr6V6XmO8VcAYlbn1L55Ck", "contributor": "0x6C036D6C488DC3959f902B1be839e3cf163365C4"}

Lau将100美元存入了dYdX，然后他获取到了5万美元的回报。\n\n我们相信，这样的空投还会发生。在这个新的指南中，我们分享了25个未来可能会进行空投的机会。显然，我们不能承诺任何事情，但是，在每一个机会上花10分钟来进行学习，很可能会让你在未来获取到一份回报。\n\n祝你们好运。\n\nDeFi协议越来越多地采用「代币空投」的方式，以分散治理并促进早期用户的参与，项目方通常会进行“追溯性空投”，这意味着他们会根据你过去与其协议或系统交互的多少来分配奖励。\n\n在这篇文章中，我们将概述一些可能会进行空投的协议。\n\n目标：确定未发行代币的协议，以捕获未来可能的空投机会。\n\n技能：初级\n\n努力：中等\n\n## **经验总结**\n\n根据我们在过去一年中看到的情况，我们可以合理地得出一个结论：「空投」正在成为年轻 DeFi 项目的标准操作实践。从项目方的角度来看，优化这些空投还有一些工作要做（比如让它们抵抗女巫攻击）。\n\n问题的关键是？大多数人没有大量的时间和无限的资源来将活动分散到每个最终可能会推出代币的 DeFi 项目中。\n\n因此，重点就在于效率：确定要关注哪些项目（例如，给定协议是否有非常小的机会在6-12个月内推出代币？）以及规模（即存款多少以平衡风险和潜在的回报）。\n\n就第一点而言，通过一点研究，你通常可以找到团队/社区的代币计划来指导你的工作。例如，ParaSwap 最近宣布它没有空投计划。相反，MetaMask团队最近透露其对最终发布原生代币的想法持开放态度。\n\n因此，作为一个例子，你可能想开始通过MetaMask 执行一些加密资产交易。当然，我们并不能保证代币空投就一定会到来，但至少现在我们知道了，它存在着可能。\n\n接下来，为了获得空投资格，你需要和这些未发行代币的协议进行多少次（或量）的交互？\n\n这将因项目而异，但DeFi早期的黄金法则是“决不要存入超过你承受能力的加密资产。”\n\n好消息是什么？正如The Daily Ape创始人Darren Lau在上个月指出的那样，即使只是一点点的钱/活动，也足以让你获得空投的资格。\n\n![https://appserversrc.8btc.cn/FjGedt7oWtVZckWZ0Q8PTxiiTQC6.jpg](https://appserversrc.8btc.cn/FjGedt7oWtVZckWZ0Q8PTxiiTQC6.jpg)\n\n## 25个可能会有空投的加密项目\n\n下面是我们V2版空投指南收录的加密项目列表，这些项目有可能在不久的将来推出自己的代币并进行追溯性空投。\n\n免责声明：我并不确定它们是否会进行空投，这完全是基于我（作为一名活跃的加密用户和研究人员）的经验得出的观点。\n\n### 1、Element Finance\n\n描述：Element Finance是一个“针对固定收益率和可变收益率市场的开源协议”。\n\n资源：[网站](https://app.element.fi/fixedrates)|[文档](https://docs.element.fi/)‌|[Twitter](https://twitter.com/element_fi)‌|[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/8JnDyXJJWh)‌\n\n理由：Element Finance已经创建了一个治理模型，这表明该项目必然会发布一个原生代币。\n\n空投策略：Element Finance的旗舰产品是其Earn应用程序和Save应用程序，使用这两种产品中的任何一种，都可能让你有资格获得未来的空投。\n\n### 2、Hop Protocol\n\n描述：Hop Protocol是一种代币桥协议，其用于在区块链和rollup二层网络之间轻松发送ETH和ERC-20代币，它目前支持跨以太坊、Arbitrium、Optimism、Polygon以及xDai这几条链。\n\n资源：[网站](https://hop.exchange/)‌|[文档](https://docs.hop.exchange/)‌|[Twitter](https://twitter.com/HopProtocol)‌ | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/PwCF88emV4)‌\n\n理由：关于潜在的Hop代币，该项目团队之前已说过“任何关于该协议的官方公告，Hop团队都将直接发布在官方的Hop频道。”\n\n如果Hop没有发布代币的计划，他们可能会像ParaSwap一样发布官方公告。\n\n空投策略：访问hop.exchange，然后（1）使用发送仪表板将资产从一条链跨到另一条链，或者（2）成为Hop池子的流动性提供者（LP）。\n\n### 3、DeFi Saver\n\n描述：DeFi Saver是“一站式仪表板，用于创建、管理和跟踪你的DeFi头寸。”\n\n资源：[网站](https://defisaver.com/)‌|[文档](https://docs.defisaver.com/)‌|[Twitter](https://twitter.com/DeFiSaver)‌ | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XGDJHhZ)‌\n\n理由：到目前为止，DeFi Saver一直在使用一个原生代币，但这是一个策展代币，持有者可以用其投票和优先考虑新的协议整合。\n\n空投策略：试用DeFi Saver的投资组合系统或[Recipe Creator](https://app.defisaver.com/recipes/book)。\n\n### 4、Ondo Finance\n\n描述：Ondo Finance是一个支持“去中心化金融风险市场”的协议。\n\n资源：[网站](https://ondo.finance/)‌|[文档](https://docs.ondo.finance/faq)‌| [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OndoFinance)‌ | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/qNqhRGv76B)‌\n\n理由：Ondo团队之前曾说过“Ondo目前没有代币”，注意一下，他们的说法是当时没有。\n\n空投策略：加入Ondo的一个风险市场（请注意，他们有特定的“开放窗口”，在此期间你才可以加入）。\n\n### 5、Saddle Finance\n\n描述：Saddle是一个去中心化交易所，其对稳定币和封装BTC等锚定加密资产进行了优化。\n\n资源：[网站](https://saddle.finance/)‌|[文档](https://docs.saddle.finance/)‌| [Twitter](https://twitter.com/saddlefinance)‌ | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hX8RZFBW9R)‌\n\n理由：Saddle是Curve系统的一个改编版本，尽管它是用Solidity语言而不是Vyper编写的，考虑到Curve推出了CRV，不难想象Saddle最终也会有自己的代币。\n\n空投策略：通过该交易所进行代币互换，或者充当流动性提供者（LP）。\n\n### 6、Charm\n\n描述：Charm协议提供了一套 DeFi 产品，包括 Alpha Vaults、Cube Token等。\n\n资源：[网站](https://charm.fi/) ‌| [文档](https://learn.charm.fi/charm-finance/)‌ |[Twitter](https://twitter.com/charmfinance)|[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6BY3Fq2)\n\n理由：从第一天起，Charm 团队的既定目标就是“任何人都可以研究、构建和治理 Charm 中的协议”。这里提到了“治理协议”，似乎意味着他们将发行一种代币。\n\n空投策略：存入 Charm 的初始产品之一，例如Alpha Vaults。\n\n### 7、Slingshot\n\n描述：Slingshot 是目前在 Polygon 上运行的一个 Web3 交易平台，接下来它还将支持 Arbitrum。\n\n资源：[网站](https://slingshot.finance/)‌ | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SlingshotCrypto)|[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/H3UcvgtASR)\n\n理由：Slingshot 似乎可能会走其他 DEX走过的道路，并最终发布自己的代币。\n\n空投策略：连接到 Polygon 网络并在 Slingshot 应用上进行一些交易。\n\n### 8、TokenSets\n\n描述：TokenSets 是一个建立在 Set 协议之上的 DeFi 资产管理平台。\n\n资源：[Website](https://www.tokensets.com/)|[Docs](https://docs.tokensets.com/)|[Twitter](https://twitter.com/tokensets)|[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/x3PGVfP)\n\n理由：该项目似乎要实现完全去中心化治理，这可能需要发布一个原生代币。\n\n空投策略：购买/出售Set token或创建你自己的Set token。\n\n### 9、Gro Protocol\n\n描述：Gro Protocol是一种迎合稳定币的收益聚合器协议。\n\n资源：[Website](https://www.gro.xyz/)|[Docs](https://docs.gro.xyz/gro-docs/)|[Twitter](https://twitter.com/groprotocol)|[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gro)\n\n理由：Gro 团队计划让该项目“在不久的将来完全去中心化”，并计划让早期支持者参与治理。\n\n空投策略：使用 Gro Protocol 的 Vault 或 PWRD 产品。\n\n### 10、Cowswap\n\n描述：Cowswap 是一个抗 MEV 的 DEX 聚合器，它构建在 v2 版本的Gnosis协议之上。\n\n资源： [Website](https://cowswap.exchange/#/swap) | [Docs](https://docs.cowswap.exchange/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MEVprotection) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MHmz3knm2X)\n\n理由：Cowswap 计划在完全去中心化的道路上建立一个 DAO，这意味着它会有一个代币。\n\n空投策略：通过该交易所进行一些交易。\n\n### 11、Cozy Finance\n\n描述：Cozy Finance 是一种为 DeFi 创建信任最小化保护市场的协议（即保险协议）。\n\n资源：[Website](https://www.cozy.finance/)|[Docs](https://docs.cozy.finance/)|[Twitter](https://twitter.com/cozyfinance)|[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kK84saQYyg)\n\n理由：迄今为止，大多数 DeFi 保险项目都推出了自己的代币，因此我们最终可能会在Cozy 身上看到同样的情况。\n\n空投策略：在 Cozy 上借用/提供资产，或者，更高级的用户可以创建自己的保护市场。\n\n### 12、Zapper\n\n描述：Zapper 是一个面向 DeFi 和 NFT 用户的 Web3 钱包管理仪表板。\n\n资源：[Website](https://zapper.fi/dashboard) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zapper_fi) | [Discord](https://zapper.fi/discord)\n\n理由：Zapper 还没有“消除”发行代币的可能性，也就是说，我们还有机会。\n\n空投策略：试用Zapper原生的Exchange、Pool、Save等产品。\n\n### 13、Zerion\n\n描述：Zerion 是另一个面向 DeFi 和 NFT 用户的Web3 钱包管理仪表板。\n\n资源：[Website](https://zerion.io/)|[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zerion_io)|[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/q7nZhgK)\n\n理由：和Zapper 一样，我们可能会看到 Zerion 在未来某个时候推出一个原生代币来促进社区治理。\n\n空投策略：试用Zerion的Invest、Exchange、Pool产品等。\n\n### 14、 Kwenta & Lyra\n\n描述：这是两个不同的协议，但它们的共同点是，两者都是构建在 Synthetix 上的衍生项目，并且已部署在 Optimism L2 上。\n\n资源：[Kwenta Twitter](https://twitter.com/kwenta_io)|[Lyra Twitter](https://twitter.com/lyrafinance)\n\n理由：这两个项目方已公开确认将进行追溯性空投。\n\n空投策略：将 SNX 放在 Optimism 上，然后使用其中的任何一个协议。\n\n### 15、 Mirror\n\n描述：Mirror 是一个去中心化的内容发布平台\n\n资源：[Website](https://mirror.xyz/)|[Twitter](https://twitter.com/viamirror)|[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6d7tsjPBjS)\n\n理由：虽然 Mirror 已经拥有 WRITE代币，但该代币的发布是受到限制的，也许 Mirror 可能向其早期用户空投更多的代币。\n\n空投策略：利用Mirror的各种工具，例如通过平台发布博客文章。\n\n### 16、以太坊域名服务（ENS）\n\n描述：ENS 是一个 Web3

团队富有创新精神和想象力，他们似乎可能会在某个时候进行一次深思熟虑、前所未有的空投。\n\n空投策略：通过 Sudoswap 应用程序进行一些 NFT 交易。\n\n### **25、OpenSea**\n\n描述：OpenSea 目前是全球领先的 NFT 市场。\n\n资源：[Website](https://opensea.io/)|[Docs](https://docs.opensea.io/)|[Twitter](https://twitter.com/opensea)|[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/opensea)\n\n理由：随着大型新玩家（例如Coinbase 和 Reddit）持续进入 NFT 领域，OpenSea 可能会推出自己的代币以激励用户留在 OpenSea 上。\n\n空投策略：通过 OpenSea 铸造和收集 NFT。\n\n## **其他可能会空投的项目**\n\n有太多的项目还没有发行自己的代币，我也无法在这篇文章中深入探讨其中的每一个。注意，以下这些项目也存在着空投的可能，请记住，我对它们的代币发行计划没有直接的了解。\n\n 1. Art Blocks\n 2. Artion\n 3. Fuji Finance\n 4. Goldfinch\n 5. Hashflow\n 6. Horizon Finance\n 7. MetaMask\n 8. Opyn\n 9. Rabbithole\n10. Risk Harbor\n11. Rubicon\n12. Sablier\n13. Shell Protocol\n14. Sherlock\n15. Superfluid\n16. Teller\n\n## **结论**\n\n请务必记住，使用年轻的 DeFi 和 NFT 项目可能存在着风险，它们本质上都是实验。\n\n因此，在深入探索这些协议之前，你需要做更多的研究。 如果你确实测试了其中的任何一个，请确保谨慎进行，并且仅使用自己能够承受损失的资金。\n\n也就是说，正如 Darren Lau 在之前的推文中提到的那样，即使是适度的参与，也可以让你获得丰厚的空投回报。\n\n最后，请记住，我们最终可能会看到像 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 这样的rollup项目推出自己的原生代币。\n\n另外，你可以尝试像 Hop Protocol 这样的项目，你可以在其中与这些rollup网络进行交互，这可能会让你实现“一石二鸟”。", "timestamp": 1635490739, "digest": "QZLUJ8DSr9lFMsJPy2j3Nfq2FAwQu48TpeVCUzDyB10", "contributor": "0xEF3253E2FaAA98A403253e3777708bDaf58546a9"}

Now without releasing the air, breathe in some more. Keep breathing in until you can’t anymore. That’s right, breathe until you can feel that tightness in your chest and your lungs are fully inflated. Count to 30. Breathe out. You should feel a rush of dopamine and an instant sense of relaxation.\n\n![Kundalini yoga is often described as the process of awakening a dormant potential force at the base of your spine. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WptiBuCJkry0crwgFYQpL.jpeg?height=431&width=646)\n\nWhen I first tried Kundalini, I could only describe the feeling as an intense runner’s high or what I imagined to be the rush of hypothetical drugs in my system. If you didn’t try it just now, it’s definitely worth your 30 seconds. My limited experience with deep breathing exercises is evidence that the world of mindfulness is a powerful tool for mental clarity and emotional stability. In the past, I’ve used running as a form of meditation-- where the rhythmic pounding of my feet on the sidewalk puts me in a trance that I could continue on for hours. Running is my go-to form of therapy after a stressful day or overwhelming feelings of anxiety. It’s only recently that I’ve realized that I haven’t yet given traditional meditation a chance. Making Sense with Sam Harris and closing my eyes for a few minutes in yoga with my mom doesn’t count in my books.\n\n![When approached as a habit, meditation can rewire our neural circuitry.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cMSVQ3VCTPPBJspKQFaN3.jpeg?height=448&width=673)\n\nSo why meditate? Meditation is the habitual process of training your mind to focus and redirect your thoughts. I think of it as a tool to enable self-awareness, develop concentration, increase pain tolerance, and establish healthy sleep patterns.

Berger《与社会学同游——人文主义的视角》**\n\n\n社会学的产生\n社会学是现代西方特有的思想成果，而且它包含了一种独特的现代意识形式。\n只有文化的自我概念（尤其是文化里法定的、权威的和被普遍接受的自我概念）经历过剧烈的振荡，敏锐的人才可能超越文化自我概念的断言去思考问题，才可能去拷问权威。\n阿尔伯特·萨洛蒙证明，只有在基督教世界的规定性结构瓦解之后，只有在法国大革命摧毁规定性的社会政治制度之后，现代社会学意义上的“社会”概念才能够出现。\n我们可以再次将“社会”构想为大厦的隐蔽结构，大厦的外表遮蔽了内部结构。在中世纪的基督教世界里，威严的宗教一政治外表使“社会”隐蔽无形，这一宗教一政治显形的外表构成了欧洲人的日常世界。正如萨洛蒙所云，宗教改革使基督教世界的团结瓦解之后，绝对权力的国家展现出更加世俗化的政治外表，然而和此前的基督教世界一样，这种政治外表起到的是相同的作用。绝对权力的国家瓦解之后，“社会”的底层框架才进入人们的视野。 “社会”是动机和力量的世界，是不能用官方对社会现实的解释来理解的。例如，社会学家想要知道的是“非正式权力结构”（对此研究感兴趣的美国社会学家弗洛伊德·亨特所用的术语）的构成情况，这是由人及其权力组成的结构形态。\n\n\n社会学的视角\n社会学家的问题万变不离其宗：“人们如何互动？”“他们的关系如何？”“这些关系在机构里是如何组织的？”“推动人和机构的集体观念是什么？”\n社会学视角并不有助于我们产生登高望远的观点，而是在一定程度上对主日学校和公民教育里对社会现实的解释产生祛魅作用。\n社会学的视角使我们用新的目光去审视我们生活于其中的非常熟悉的世界。社会学家活动的领域是他熟悉的领域，在普通人的世界里游走，和大多数人称为真实的世界贴近。召唤他的还有另一种令人激动的发现——不是发现全然陌生的东西，而是发现熟悉的东西发生了意义上的变化。\n\n\n社会学的人性价值\n平民焦点：\n社会学方法中兴趣的平民焦点，即仔细研究其他学者可能认为平淡无奇、不值得作为科学研究对象的事情。人的一切所作所为都能够成为社会学研究的重要课题。\n善于倾听：\n社会学家需要仔细倾听他人的倾诉而不必提出自己的意见。倾听里至少潜藏着一定的人性化意义，因为在我们这个神经紧张、偏爱饶舌的时代里，几乎没有人愿意抽出时间去专心致志地倾听别人的意见。\n评价责任：\n社会学最后一个独特的人性价值是社会学家承担着对自己的发现作出评价的责任。在他心理上能够承担的范围内，他的评价不能顾及自己的偏见、好恶、希望或畏惧。\n\n\n社会学的意义\n社会学是非常具有现代性的、很合时宜的批判性思想形式。社会学的认识使我们对这样的社会观念机制持怀疑态度：社会把光明分配给一些人，把黑暗分配给另一些人（包括略微修补后把黑暗和“病态”画等号的现代机制）。\n社会学知识有利于培育这样的意识：所有人都在为自己的命运抗争；在属于自己的短暂的生命里，人的身份随时受到威胁，显得格外珍贵，人必须要为界定自己的身份而抗争。\n社会学最大的贡献在于，它有利于确立人的主体性，有助于人逃离社会的“监狱”、“陷阱”和“木偶操纵线”，鼓励人去追求自由。\n\n\n社会学意识的四个母题\n社会学意识的第一个母题是“揭露真相”。揭露真相是社会学的固有逻辑：社会学揭露真相的母题并不是心理学的母题，而是方法论的母题。社会学的参考框架有一个内置的方法论，社会学研究的现实的层次并非官方所解释的层次，它带有揭露真相的逻辑必然性，社会学有责任揭示人们用来掩盖互动的托词和宣传。这种揭露真相的责任是社会学的特点之一，它尤其精于把握当代社会的脾气。\n社会学家常用“意识形态”这个字眼来揭露既得利益群体使自己具有合法性的真相。“某一思想为社会上的某一既得利益服务时，我们就把这种思想称为意识形态”。意识形态经常地，即使不是一贯地、系统地扭曲社会现实，以便插足它能够插足的地方。社会学揭露真相的母题就是穿透言词的烟幕，深人到行为背后去发现人们不会承认的，而且常常使人不愉快的行为动机。\n社会学意识的第二个母题是“不恭敬的态度”。\n社会学意识里这种不敬的母题未必隐含着革命的态度。社会学的认识本身就敌视革命的意识形态，这并不是因为社会学有一种保守的偏向，而是因为它不仅看穿了对现状的幻灭感，而且看穿了对未来的虚幻的期待（虚幻的期待就是革命者习惯性的精神营养），因此具有一种非革命性的、温和的清醒意识。\n不敬的态度可以表现为情绪，也可以表现为意志，但无论其表现形式如何，不敬的态度始终应该是社会学家头脑里的一种可能性。这种态度可能会与他生活的其他方面隔离开来，也可能掩藏在日常的心态之下，甚至在意识形态上遭到否定。\n社会学意识的第三个母题是“中性化趋势”，第四个母题是“世界眼光”。\n社会学思想的实质接近于尼采所谓的“怀疑的艺术”。完全的思想尊敬必然意味着社会学的死亡。真正的社会学研究在极权主义的国家很快就消失得无影无踪，纳粹德国就是很好的例子。\n社会学的认识有一个隐含的意义：对警察和其他公共秩序的守护者的头脑而言，它始终是一个潜在的危险，因为它总是倾向于使绝对正确的断言中性化，而警察等守护者的头脑总是以这样的断言为依托。\n社会学代表的意识是价值完全中性化了的世界的意识。现代社会的地理流动和社会流动速度前所未有，因而自己的文化，包括基本的价值观在时间和空间上都只具有相对性。\n\n\n社会学对自我的微观分析\n“过去是可变的、易变的、不断变化的，这是因为我们回忆过去的经历时往往反复进行新的解释。所以我们说，一个人有多少观点，他就有多少不同的人生经历。”\n从社会学的角度来看，自我不再是铁板一块，不再是从一个情景过渡到另一个情景的既定实体。更加准确地说，自我是一个过程，不断被创造和再创造的过程，人进人每一个社会情景时自我都要发生变化，自我靠纤细的记忆之绳串联在一起。\n\n\n人在社会——社会决定论的几个主题\n“自我”的社会定位、社会控制机制、社会分层、社会情景和制度\n（1）“自我”的社会定位\n如果我们接受涂尔干的观点，那么社会就是横亘在我们面前的客观实在。社会就在那里，不能否认，必须面对。社会外在于我们，包围我们，涵盖我们生活的一切方面。我们生活在社会中，定位于社会体系的某些具体部分。我们的定位几乎预先决定和界定了我们所做的一切：从语言到礼仪，从宗教信仰到自杀的可能性。在社会定位上，社会不考虑我们的愿望。我们从精神上对社会规定和禁令的反抗会于事无补，而且常常是徒劳无益的。社会是客观和外在的事实，特别以压制的形式面对我们。社会制度形塑我们的行为，甚至塑造我们的期望。\n社会是一个历史实体，在时间上它超越了任何个人的生命历程。社会走在我们身前，存在于我们身后。我们出生之前，社会已然存在，我们去世之后它将继续存在。我们的生命只不过是漫长岁月里社会宏伟征途中短暂的插曲而已。社会是让我们身陷囹圄的历史囚笼。\n（2）群体动力学原理\n求得共识的压力难以避免，人极其渴望被群体接受，无论周围的群体是什么样的群体。这种欲望可以很有效地被操纵，群体治疗师、蛊惑人心者和其他实施共识工程（consensus engineering）的专门化人才就善于操纵人的欲望。\n（3）社会行为与社会现实\n韦伯强调社会行为的意图，涂尔干对社会行为的意图则缺乏兴趣。涂尔干强调社会现实的外在性、客观性，强调社会现实状若“事物”的性质 （“本质”quiddity）。韦伯的主张与此对立，强调主观的意义、意图和解释，这些是行为者参与社会情景时带进来的东西。韦伯同时指出，社会中最终发生的事情可能和行为者的意图截然不同。然而他断言，必须要考虑主观这个维度的全貌，才能够获得充分的社会学知识（verstehen，文化知解法）——社会学知识要对社会里存在的意义作出解释。\n涂尔干和韦伯看社会的方式并不是逻辑上矛盾的方式。它们只不过是对立的表述而已，因为它们集中关注的是社会现实的不同方面。社会是客观事实，社会压制甚至制造我们一这样说是完全正确的。但我们有意义的行为支撑着社会大厦，有时还协助改变社会大厦——这样说也是正确的。\n实际上，这两句话包含了社会存在的悖论：社会界定我们，又反过来被我们界定。我们与社会合作、共谋。然而，一旦我们用合作、共谋的观点看社会，而不是用被社会压制和制造的观点来看社会，社会看起来就很脆弱。我们要生存下去就需要得到社会的承认，以此获得自我形象和身份；社会也需要得到许多像我们一样的普通人的承认，否则它就不能存在。\n\n\n社会在人——角色理论、知识社会学、参照群体理论\n（1）角色理论与游戏社会\n角色理论认为，人的身份是被动接受的，不是主动选择的。从社会学的视角看，身份是社会赋予，并由社会支撑和转换的。\n米德认为，社会角色是通过游戏学会的。如果整个社会不具备人为的性质，社交的人为性就不可能成立。社交就是“游戏社会” （playing society）的一种特殊情况，游戏者对其虚构性更加自觉。而社交也是更为宏大的社会结构的一部分，你同样能够与之游戏。通过这样的游戏，儿童学会了扮演“认真”的角色。在社交的过程中，我们在有些时刻回到了童年时代戴着面具的游戏生活里，这也许就是社交的乐趣。\n齐美尔的社交理论认为，社交是社会互动的游戏形式，游戏可以作为减轻压力的手段。此外，赫伊津哈把游戏作为人和社会的本质特征，对游戏的定位如下：“除非把人当作游戏的物种,除非研究人游戏和游乐的一面,否则我们就不可能把握人类文化”。\n（2）知识社会学\n在围绕世界观的大辩论中，社会学提出“谁说的？”这样一个恼人的问题。知识社会学回答“谁说的？”这个问题，试图清理从思想到思想者再到他所处的社会环境的发展脉络”。\n社会学视角引进了一丝令人清醒的怀疑要素，这种怀疑态度立竿见影，给人提供保护，使人不至于立即改变自己的信仰。社会学意识的参考框架使人能够以这样的态度去感受自己的经历：人的生活阅历是在若干具体的社会环境里流动的，所有的社会环境都附带着具体的意义体系。这样的社会学意识当然不能够解决何为真理的问题，但它使我们不那么容易掉进人生旅途中遭遇的每一个传教团设置的陷阱。\n（3）参照群体理论\n如果说知识社会学赋予我们构建社会现实的广阔视野，那么参照群体理论就向我们展示许多小作坊，其中那些构建世界的小群体就在锻造他们心中的宇宙模型。\n这个过程中隐蔽的社会心理动力学大概和角色理论的社会心理动力学大同小异。这样的社会心理动力大概是一种原始的欲望：被人接受、有一定归属并与人共同生活在一个世界里。\n\n\n社会学与人的自由\n按照盖伦的制度理论的解释，制度疏导人的行为颇似本能疏导动物的行为。而两者之间存在着一个重大的差异：倘若动物能够反思自己的本能，它一定会说，“我别无选择”；同样，在解释自己为何服从制度的要求时，人们也会说，“我别无选择”。唯一的区别是，动物说的是实情，人却是在欺骗自己。\n因为实际上人能够对社会说“不”，而倘若他们采取这样的行动，他们可能就会遭遇令人不快的后果。人们甚至想都不去想把“不”付诸行动，因为他们把服从视为理所当然。他们在制度里生存的性质也许是他们唯一敢于想象的身份，其他的选择似乎是发疯。而这并不改变一个事实：“我必须”几乎在每一个社会情景里都是欺骗自己的谎言。\n人的“监狱”、“囚笼”、“枷锁”是自己和社会共同打造的。社会“是‘存在于内心’的现象，社会是在我们心灵最深处存在的一部分……只有理解了内化机制以后，我们才能够理解这个令人难以置信的事实：社会不仅控制着我们的行为，而且塑造着我们的身份、思想和情感。社会的结构成为我们意识的结构。我们受制于社会的枷锁，这个枷锁不是我们被征服后套在我们身上的，而是我们和社会合谋打造的。大多数时候，我们是被自己身上的社会性推入陷阱的。我们来到人世之前，禁锢我们的围墙就已经修好了，但却由我们自己来进行重建。我们与社会的合作就是对自己的背叛，我们自己纵身跳进了社会的陷阱。”\n我们看见木偶在小小的剧场里手舞足蹈，任随木偶线的操纵而上上下下，严格按照小小的角色规定进行表演。我们学会了理解木偶剧场的逻辑，发现自己在追随木偶的表演。在社会生活里，我们也被吊挂在操纵我们的“木偶线”上，我们借此给自己定位，并承认自己的定位。在一刹那间，我们觉得自己很像是木偶。不过随后，我们就捕捉住了木偶剧场和人生戏剧的深刻区别：我们可以停止木偶的演出动作，抬头仰望并感知操纵我们的那一套“木偶线”。这个停止演出的动作是我们走向自由的第一步。\n社会学框架本身不能验证自由。如果我们想要把自己的论述严格限定在社会学的参考框架里，我们根本就无法探讨自由，因为社会学的参考框架是一个科学的框架。效用和美不同，但不矛盾，效用话语和审美话语这两个世界严格地说是不能比较、不可通约的。同理，自由和因果关系（科学框架）并不矛盾，两者仅仅是不同的术语而已。\n萨特认为，人不但是自由的，而且“注定是自由的”（condemned to freedom）。有人借口“身不由己”、“不得已而为之”，其实是放弃了自由的选择，是逃避自由（弗洛姆），这就是“自欺”。所谓“自欺”就是把事实上自愿的行为假装成必需的行为。“自欺”就是逃离自由，就是不诚实地逃避“选择的痛苦”（agony of choice）。\n反犹主义（或任何其他形式的种族主义或狂热的民族主义）本质上是“自欺”的，因为它把人的全部属性等同于社会属性。于是，人性就成了没有自由的实实在在的东西。人们的爱恨杀戮都局限于一个神话世界里：在这个世界里人人都成了社会标签，比如纳粹冲锋队员就成了自己的徽章所示的符号，犹太人就成了集中营囚服上标记的深受鄙视的符号。\n海德格尔有关“人”的观念说明：如果在泛化的“人”中失去自我，那就是不自由。“这个观念与他探讨本真和非本真的观念有关联。所谓本真的存在就是生活在这样一种清醒的意识中：个人的个性是独一无二、不可替代、无与伦比的特性。与此相比，非本真的存在就是在匿名的‘人’中失去自我，就是把自己独一无二的特性拱手出让给社会构建的抽象概念。”\n海德格尔“人”的观念和我们的社会观的相关性，与其说表现在其规定性意义上，不如说表现在认知性意义上。在论述人的“自欺”意义时，我们把社会当作给人提供逃避自由的借口的机制；在说到海德格尔“人”的观念时，我们把社会当作防御恐惧的机制。\n社会为我们提供了被我们视之为理所当然的结构（ “安然无虞的世界”），社会是产生非本真存在的共谋。在这些结构里，只要我们遵守规则，我们就能够得到保护，就不至于受到生存境遇终极恐惧的威胁。\n波将金（Grigori Aleksandrovich Potemkin）据说为了取悦卡捷琳娜二世而在她巡游的沿途搭建外观悦目的假村庄，社会的墙壁正是竖立在深渊边缘的波将金的村庄 （Potemkin's village）。墙壁的功能是保护我们，使我们不受惊吓，为我们组织一个有意义的世界，使我们在这个世界里的生命有意义。\n而一切制度结构都必然依赖欺骗，社会上的一切存在物都带有一点自欺的成分。这个闪光的洞见乍一看令人十分压抑，但它实际上使我们管窥到另一个观点：社会的决定力量并不像我们所料的那样强大，我们依然可以寻求一种本真的生存，但本真的生存同样只能在社会里发生，一切意义都是在社会里传递的。一切通向思考存在的路径都有其社会定位——宗教、哲学、美学的路径都有其社会定位。社会既可能是逃避自由的借口，也可能是获得自由的机缘；同理，社会既可以埋葬我们的形而上求索，也可以提供形而上求索的形式。在这里，我们再次遭遇我们社会生存的无处不在的两面神悖论——社会生存既自由又不自由。社会为大多数人提供的是借口和波将金的村庄，作为自由之路的功能只为少数人开放。即使我们认为社会里的本真是可能的，大多数人也并没有利用这个可能性。\n\n\n社会暴政的逃生隧道：变革、超然和巧妙利用\n变革与神授魅力\n社会变革和革命可以推翻社会压力。一切变革都是先内后外的，内心的变革走在社会变革之前，内心的变革就是自由：“实际上，我们审视革命时发现，总是在反抗旧秩序的外在行为出现之前，内在的顺从和忠诚就已经瓦解了....早在社会制度被暴力推翻之前，已经由于人民的鄙视而失去了意识形态的支持。不承认社会规范、反对社会规范的定义总是具有潜在的革命威力。”\n“神授魅力（Charisma）对预先界定的力量构成最富有激情的挑战。它用新的意义取代旧的意义，以激进的方式重新界定关于人的存在的预设”。而在神授魅力运动中表现出来的超乎寻常的激情很难能超过一代人的岁月。神授魅力必然走进一个韦伯所谓的“常规化”过程。它会以不那么激进的形式重新整合进社会结构里。先知的后继者是教皇，革命者的后继者是行政官员。宗教革命或政治革命的大地震过去之后，人们在自己认为的新秩序里安顿下来生活，而结果必然证明，变革并不像起初看起来的那样彻底。造反的狂热冷却之后，经济利益和政治雄心就取而代之。旧习惯重新抬头，由神授魅力推动的革命产生的新秩序开始复旧，和其用强大暴力推翻的社会及政治制度表现出令人不安的相似性。\n超然与自我流放\n超然的态度可以减轻社会压力：倘若不能改变或破坏社会，可以在内心深处采取退让的姿态。超然的态度是抵抗社会控制的办法，这样的处事态度始于老子，斯多葛派把它发展成为一个抵抗的学说。超然的处事者退出社会舞台，隐居到自己的宗教、思想和艺术领域里，进入自我流放的境界，形成“亚文化”和“反社会”等圈子。\n巧妙利用与游离\n逃避社会暴政的第三种方法是“巧妙利用”。所谓巧妙利用，就是用正常运转之外的方式去利用社会制度。运用这种方法时，个人并不尝试去改变社会结构，也不对社会结构采取超然的态度。相反，他用社会结构的合法守护者未曾预料到的方式去有意识地利用这些社会结构，根据他自己的目的在社会丛莽中独辟蹊径。欧文.戈夫曼分析了“囚徒”（inmates）世界（包括精神病院、监狱和其他压迫机构），他提供的例子充分说明“巧妙利用制度”（work thesystem）为何能够成立。\n在这里，游离（ecstasy）是一个有用的概念。所谓的“游离”不是神秘而异常的意识高涨，而是其字面的意思——置身局外或步出理所当然的日常社会时的那种感觉，与自己的世界拉开距离。\n一旦个人不必用内心的投人去扮演角色时，一旦他刻意和假装扮演角色而不必内心投人时，扮演者就进人了“游离”的境界，就忘记了“理所当然的世界”。别人认为是命运使然，他却认为只是一套需要考虑的因素；别人认为是重要的身份，他却当作方便的伪装。“游离”改变了他的社会意识，以至于既定性（givenness）变成了可能性（possibility）。\n“游离”既有社会学的意义，也有形而上的意义。如果我们以“游离”的姿态走出“理所当然的世界”和“安然无虞的世界”，我们就可以获得自由。只有步出被人视之为理所当然的社会常规，我们才能够直面人的境遇而不必诉诸安慰人的神秘化的骗人把戏。\n自由以一定程度的意识解放为前提。无论我们有什么样的获得自由的可能性，倘若我们继续假定，“安然无虞的世界”是唯一可能的世界，那么自由就难以实现。社会给我们提供了温暖的、相当舒服的洞穴，我们可以和同伴蜷缩在洞穴里，给自己擂鼓壮胆，用鼓声淹没黑暗中传来的豺狼虎豹的嗥叫声，而“游离”是走出洞穴、独自面对黑夜的行动。\n\n\n社会学的人文性质\n在自由、真理的坚持不懈的学术传统中，社会学的人文冲动在当代情景中找到了自己的生存空间。社会学中的人文主义性质既体现“在我们如何看这个世界的过程中，也体现在这一学科所蕴含的道德诉求之中”。\n社会学既是方法论意义上的“科学”，又是人文关怀意义上的人文学科。社会学关心的首先是人的生存境遇，主张社会学向哲学和史学的人性关怀学习。在人的存在里，人的社会存在是关键的一维，因此社会学反复研究的根本问题是，人之为人有何意义，作为具体情景里的人又有何意义。\n对相对性和“选择”的体验不仅是一个普遍的历史现象，而且是每个人生活中真实的生存体验问题。社会学针对这种生存体验的社会根源提出的洞见可能会给我们一丝安慰，有助于我们为令人痛苦的问题寻找一个富有哲理的答案或神学意义上的解答。在这个启示稀缺、令人痛苦的世界里，即使对小小的恩赐，我们也要心存感激。\n社会学不是道德科学\n社会学家有道德关怀，但社会学不是“道德科学”。我们不能够接受或复活法国社会学由孔德提出、涂尔干继承的那种希望。社会科学不能够推导出一种客观的道德（所谓的“道德科学”，sciencedes moeurs），也无法在此基础上确立一种世俗的问答形式来表述客观的道德。\n在美国，社会学知识为政治宣传、军事规划服务的情况已经令人脊背发凉。在极权主义的社会里，社会学知识的应用可能会变成一场疆梦。社会学在当代工业管理、公共关系和广告里的应用也不是道德上的美景。许多社会学家并不认为这样的应用产生了道德上的问题，这个事实本身就足以证明，社会学视角本身不会使人具备道德上更高水平的敏锐性。\n\n\n社会学的马基雅维利主义\n马基雅维利主义是一种看问题的方式，本身在伦理上是中性的。而一旦它被毫无顾忌或缺乏同情心的人利用，它就带上了负面的伦理能量。弗里德里克.梅内克（Friedrich Meinecke）在他论政治马基雅维利主义的历史中阐明：从这位伟大的论国家的意大利诊断师的本意来看，国家理性（raison d'etat）本可以和最严肃的伦理关怀结合起来。\n社会学的马基雅维利主义也可以进行这样的结合。比如，马克斯·韦伯的生平就给人客观的教益，使我们看到无情的社会学知识可以和为实现道德理想而进行的小心求证结合起来。但这不能够改变马基雅维利思想被用作卑劣工具的可能性。\n如果可以把社会学家当作马基雅维利主义者，那么他的才能既可以为邪恶的事情服务，也可以为解放人的事业服务。社会学家是社会感知的“雇佣兵”。有些“雇佣兵”为压迫者卖命，另一些“雇佣兵”为解放者奋斗。\n对于被互相冲突的狂热撕裂的人而言，社会学家像马基雅维利主义者那样拉开距离看社会所作出的贡献并不是微不足道的。互相冲突的狂热有一个重要的共同点：它们有关社会性质的意识形态是浑浑噩噩的。以人的需求为动机，而不是以宏大的政治纲领为动机；有选择地、适度地奉献力量，而不是为极权主义的信仰去牺牲；既怀抱同情心又持怀疑态度；不抱偏见去谋求理解……所有这一切都是社会学在研究人的生存境遇时可以做到的。\n社会学的知识使人产生相当程度的清醒意识，这使保守运动和革命运动都遭遇风险：不具备现行意识形态必须要有的轻信态度使保守运动遭遇风险；对乌托邦神话持怀疑态度，而这些神话是培育革命者的必要条件，因此又使革命运动遭遇风险。\n清醒意识会让人不由自主地对社会作出激进的诊断，却又没有能力践行激进的政治责任，因而以受虐待狂的姿态去崇拜揭黑幕的人，此外无路可走。这种愤世嫉俗的态度本身是幼稚的，其根源常常是缺乏历史视野。人们可以轻信并顺从现存社会制度永恒的观念，可以轻信并期待即将来临的社会制度，愤世嫉俗的态度并非唯一的选择。\n人生如戏、如剧场、如舞台、如狂欢节，社会生存如两面神、如悲喜剧。在人生的社会游戏场里，我们可以将悲悯的情怀、适度的承诺和一定程度的喜剧意识结合起来，产生一种与社会相对的姿态，其基础是认为社会根本是一场喜剧。\n在这场喜剧里，人们纷纷登台亮相，身穿花哨的戏剧服装，变换头顶的帽子，改变自己的名号，用手里的棍子互相敲打，或者让同台亮相的演员相信，自己手里握有棍子。这种滑稽的视角并不忽视这样一个事实：实际上不存在的棍子也可以使人真的流血，但这样的事实不会使人把波将金的假村落当作上帝之城。除非游戏规则保护活生生的人，除非游戏规则培育真正的人的价值，否则就会拒绝认真对待游戏规则。由此可见，社会学里的马基雅维利主义和愤世嫉俗的机会主义是决然对立的，前者能够使自由在社会行动中得以实现。",

I was not entirely sure whether it’s a cultural thing or was it because my parents were just being dramatic. If any of my parents were planning to travel just a bit further than the city border, the ‘what you need to do if I got in an accident and didn’t survive’ scenario will surely come up. My mother has this letter of instructions (and yes, it includes the order for me and my siblings to respect, love, take care of, and avoid fighting over wealth distribution with each other). She put it in the first drawer of her nightstand. Although she clearly said not to open it should nothing happen, the curiosity (and self-control) of the 9-year-old me was all over the place. So I opened the envelope, read the letter, and cried. My oldest sister caught me reading the letter, smacked my head with some newspaper, and took it from my hand. After she read it, she cried even more than I did. We bonded for at least a few minutes before she’s mad at me about something else. \n\nIt was heart-wrenching to read the things my mother thought needed to be said in the case of her unexpected death. In the letter, she spoke to us directly, called our name and our shit with so much love, I can’t begin to imagine if anything really happened to her. I thought about it, you know. Would I be able to live a life without her? How would I cope? My father, on the other hand, was very light on the topic. His attitude was more like, “Everyone will face death eventually. If I am dead, good luck to you all, I am out. Bye!” My brother said something about him last week, which I thought was pretty accurate. “\\[My father\\] He lived his life the way he wanted it,” and that he surely did. He was also pretty confident that he wouldn’t get to age 70. \n\nMy father died just a few months after he turned 69 years old. Last July, when I saw him on my phone screen, lying on the floor with eyes closed and pale lips, my heart pounded hard. I couldn’t even cry but oh how I wished to be there. We all lived in different cities, my siblings and my parents, and that video call was the last time I ever saw him. It was busy, people were panicking on the other side of the phone, unsure what to do with no family members present. But one look at him, and in my gut, I just knew. He was gone. I hung up and called my brother right away. I told him, I *think* he passed away. I called my mother and told her the same news. I had to repeat the sentence five times before she realized what I was saying. I think repeating the news gave me the realization as well. Suddenly, there were no bones in my body and breathing felt impossible. I always thought there would be more tears but all I could feel was this empty space inside of me**.** Was it my heart that was broken? Or my body? Or was it everything? Because it definitely felt like everything in me shattered. How could something be so painful yet so numb? Will this feeling ever go away?\n\nI do have a theory now that the feeling won’t go anywhere. Just like how your heart and your soul suddenly filled with so much love after the birth of your child. This is just the opposite. It probably will be less daunting over time, but I don’t think it will go away. This is how it feels to lose the love of your life, I told myself. A good friend of mine who had a similar relationship with her late father as I had, told me, his presence was in the absence and now that he’s gone, he’s everywhere. That was probably the most relatable thing someone has ever said to me after my father passed. He’s everywhere and I am trying to accept that. \n\nRewind to early 2020, when the world declared COVID19 as a pandemic and things went above and beyond crazy, I was so scared my father wouldn’t make it. Look, not to play favorites, but my mother casually gave me a hand sanitizer to keep in my bag (way) before we even heard about Covid19. She’ll thrive in the condition where you have to keep things (and your hands!) clean and spotless, wiping all surfaces every few hours. My father, however, was the total opposite of her. Let’s just say, he’s not germaphobic. Anyhow, my father has had asthma since he was a child, it never got out of hand but this condition made him unqualified for the vaccines. At least, not until his doctor cleared him up for it. He said in full confidence, I would be fine without it. I would not catch the virus. We did the treatments for his condition but never got to the point where he was qualified for the vaccines. \n\nOne of my uncles arrived at my father’s estate, a few seconds after I ended the video call. He took my father to the hospital to check or at least see if there’s anything to do to save him. The doctor called it Death On Arrival, suspecting a heart attack.  To give us peace of mind, we wanted to have the assurance that my father didn’t in fact catch the virus. Past midnight, we got the confirmation from PCR and SWAB tests that came back negative. The drama of getting the test result back just in time for us to prepare for the funeral, I can’t help but grin a little bit, oh my, my father and his life. I could almost hear him chuckling, “I told you so.” \n\nIt's been a little bit over 100 days since his passing and I am still learning how to live in the world without my father. I had this idea to interview my father and make a journal out of it because he has all of these unbelievable stories. I lost a lot of motivation and will recently. With one baby on her way to toddlerhood, who has the time to appropriately grieve? That is why when I read about Mirror in my recent jump into learning about the blockchain, a tiny little spark went off. \n\n> Would it be crazy to reach out to my father’s friends and talk about whatever connection they have together? I know it would be interesting yet also scary, considering the possibility of finding truths about my father that I (might) don’t want to hear. \n\nWriting this piece, I could hear my father giving his uninvited opinion in my head, “You better hurry up because my friends are old and they are gonna join me sooner rather than later.” \n\nSo here I am, trying to immortalize my father’s existence through written words. These last two years, people have been experiencing tremendous grief, mourning over their loved ones. We’re going to get through this. I know we don’t know each other but we’ll learn over time how to live in this unknown world. In the meantime, stay healthy and stay strong. I’ll talk to you again soon, along with an interesting story I hope.\n\n \n \n\n*mf*\n\n*---*\n\n*Hi everyone, my name is Meity and I am just learning my way into crypto/blockchain/web 3.0.

Each piece is a reflection of her children's true essence and represents an emotion we have shared with our parents and grandparents. Together in unity here and now, we celebrate the “Fabric of Life” and your existence in the first dimension, by looking into the mirror of the second dimension we are reminded how to be evolution, patient, and kind. In the third dimension, we are introduced to the concept of time by remembering the past, present, and future and with our emotions and in this fourth dimension, the “Fabric of Life” DAO has the purpose of creating digital art in the metaverse and a mission of creating a different kind of buzz...\n\nWe intend on co-creating a message of love, balanced emotions, and a “Fabric of Life” fairy tale with NFT’s for ”Little People” everywhere to enjoy for the rest of time. After the collection of 111 “Fabric of Life” NFT’s have been released we also intend on using the collection for a book and card game launch.\n\n## The Artist\n\nThe RonX111 collection is slowly being released on two platforms Rarible and OpenSea. RonX111 is an authentic street artist with all prints and holding the stencils, as well as the actual original artworks. RonX111 was born in Australia and is a street activist, he has a primary focus on bringing balance to all and ensuring the things he loves from family to nature are preserved. He has the ability to make immediate and concrete moves if he believes his higher level is at risk.\n\nRonX111 uses nature and the leading street artists in the world to deliver very timely and deep messages for all, even if it takes time to understand the message being delivered. He sees nature in ways many do not like it’s the thing that brings light to his dark nights and the Sun is what reactivates Ron back into the reality that we all live in. His messages can be very kind and very hard it depends on the temperature of the moment. RonX111 is focused on mother nature, protecting and fighting for the greater universe that will be left in place, not fighting for today he fights for years ahead and every action has a consequence.\n\n[Mirror](https://ronx111.com)\n\n## The Animator\n\nDestrola who is in partnership with RonX111 is the animation artist. Together they take the original art to animation for the NFT market, while they still focus on their unique crafts globally. Consider the life of a Destrola as a curious child, one in which every day was another opportunity to understand and evolve the world around them. Now imagine that child always blending into the background; never defining who they are and usually playing second fiddle to friends and family.\n\nAt a certain point, there is a switch and drive to move out of the shadows. In this successful venture, they redefine themselves and realize that they have a knack for understanding perceptions and can use their skills to influence that. Moving forward Destrola forges a career in animation and design; spending time with clients to understand the questions that need to be asked and creating solutions that answer them. At the age of 23 Destrola starts pivoting into the realm of education and became a lecturer and tutor at a university; reevaluating the base understandings and helping students begin to question their own perspective of the world through their designs and creations.\n\n[Mirror](https://www.destrola.com)\n\n## RISE: Humboldt Grace Fire Recovery Project\n\nRemembering the Wildfires that devastated their homeland of Australia in 2020, sitting idly by was not an option.

He thinks that the biggest benefit of Bitcoin and its wide adoption as the equivalent of digital gold has created a system allowing anyone to participate into financial services. Open-source banking is not the future, it’s already happening. He makes an interesting comparison with the neobanks. They all had to raise a lot of money to issue cards and progressively move people to their current account. In the meantime, multiple ethereum wallets have attracted billions under management almost “overnight”… Obviously this analogy has its limits as in today’s world you can do more things with the fiat money on a neobank card than with any tokens but still it’s an interesting perspective on this new world.\n\nHis long term vision is to build a Distributed Autonomous Bank. He explains it [here](https://medium.com/balance-io/distributed-autonomous-banks-dabs-90701f5758d5). I recommend you to read the post as he touches on KYC, custody, recoverability, (@Remus I know you were interested in these topics). As you will see, several of the building blocks to achieve that vision are work-in-progress and Balance is not trying to do it all so a potential investment is also a wider bet on this market continuing to develop. \n\nSo what are they building?** \n **\n\n[Balance manager](https://manager.balance.io/): The first product they released is Manager, a desktop tool allowing you to send, receive and exchange tokens by connecting you to different wallets (where you actually store your tokens). Manager currently supports Metamask (the largest browser wallet), Ledger and Trezor, the two most popular hardware wallet (cold storage). It now also supports WalletConnect which has also been built by the Balance team. I highly recommend you try it, while still early and basic, I find it a really great UX and the best way to start buying all sorts of ERC-20 tokens. If you have dealt with Metamask before, you will see a huge difference.\n\n[WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/): It’s been incubated by Richard and his team and they have now created a separate non-profit entity that should benefit the whole industry. It’s an open-source standard for connecting desktop Dapps to mobile Wallets using end-to-end encryption by scanning a QR code. It’s a great way for users to use/interact with Dapp without compromising their private key as they can just sign/approve any transaction on their mobile wallet. So far, people have mostly used their tokens for speculation but as people start to stake, vote, pay, etc they will be using their tokens and “signing” transactions all the time. You need an easy and secure way for people to approve/sign without compromising private keys. The goal is for as many dapps as possible to support it and make it the Bluetooth for decentralised applications. [Pedro Gomes](https://twitter.com/pedrouid?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) who was a Balance engineer is now doing this full-time and Richard sits on the board but it’s clearly separate from Balance (so not something we would be investing in). I think it’s interesting because it says a lot about the team: their focus on creating great UI/UX without compromising security, their interest in contributing to the whole industry, the fact that they are not exclusively driven by money and their ability to execute (they have shipped this in a few weeks. ** \n **\n\n*“Your phone has your wallet that securely stores your private keys. When you want to interact with a dapp on the web you scan a QR code to link your wallet to the dapp. When you want to make a transaction it pushes a notification to your phone where you can confirm or reject the transaction.”*** \n **\n\nIn 2018, they want to have 5 wallets and 50 dapps supporting it, they have already signed up ImToken, 0x and Dharma protocols as partners. They have also secured a $150k grant from the Ethereum foundation. \n\nSee a demo by a team working on an identity protocol and using wallet connect:** \n **\n\n*[How you could login and pay for Netflix in web 3.0 era](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1030011892981481472)* \n\nYou can read more about it here: <https://medium.com/balance-io/walletbridge-a-simple-way-for-web-based-dapps-to-talk-to-mobile-wallets-5c4015f1838c>\n\n<https://medium.com/balance-io/0x-dharma-imtoken-join-walletconnect-87a3dd4dea8d>\n\n[Balance Wallet](https://balance.io/): A [non-custodian](https://medium.com/guarda/%EF%B8%8Fcustodial-vs-non-custodial-wallet-s-%EF%B8%8F-benefits-of-light-wallets-87cf701054d1) mobile wallet for iOS and Android. This is where you store your funds, tokens and collectibles and interact with them. First of all, I think it’s worth mentioning that the word “wallet” is probably a bit misleading or at least restrictive. The “browser” analogy gives a more comprehensive view of the role of such a product. This is where you will interact with these tokens and dapps, approving signature, staking, etc. If Richard’s vision materialise you could apply for a loan, participates into a prediction market like Augur, etc** \n **\n\n> Chemistry questions:** \n **\n\n1. *Vision: \\*What do they believe that is not visible (yet) to others?*\n\n*That assets like Bitcoin and ETH and other new emerging economic protocols are creating a new open source and fairer banking system. This industry requires UI and UX innovation to attract million of users creating an opportunity to build a new kind of organisation that will become the gateway for people to participate into this alternative financial services industry.* \n\n2. *Market: What happens if they are right and can deliver? How big can this be?*\n\n*We’re talking about creating a “bank” for this new & alternative financial services industry that is global and borderless.* \n\n3. *Product: With a team of 3-4, they have built and released 2 Balance products: desktop manager and a mobile non-custodian wallet (in beta, not on the appstore yet) as well as an open-source standard for dapps to communicate with mobile wallets that is quickly being adopted by the wider industry, WalletConnect.*\n4. \n5. *Team: What is special about [the team](https://balance.io/about/)? Why them?*\n   1. *[Christian Baroni](https://baroni.co/), design ex-Stripe*\n   2. *[Jin Chung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jinchung17), lead engineer, ex-machine learning infrastructure at eBay*\n   3. *Richard Burton, ex Stripe, Ethereum*\n\n      ** \n **\n6. *Timing: why now?* \n\n*The crazy 2017 bull market around cryptoassets has attracted massive inflow of capital and talent into the industry. There are now a very large number of teams working on building new protocols. Most of these protocols have economic incentives tied to it. Bitcoin and Ethereum have made money programmable. It’s becoming clear that new interfaces and UX standards will be required to embark the next wave of millions of users on these protocols and benefit from them. From another angle, as our life becomes increasingly digital and people are pushing more decentralisation, a digital wallet for decentralised protocols will become a key product for web 3.0*\n\n> Why I’m excited\n\nI think Balance has the potential to become an iconic product in web 3.0 and technological breakthrough that crypto represents. I agree with Richard that in the near future, the use cases enabled by crypto are likely to be closely related to money and some kind of financial services. Bitcoin and Ethereum have made money and value programmable. Economic incentives are inherent to most of the protocols being built. We’re seeing a new sort of financial services industry being built. I don’t expect this category to entirely replace the existing banking sector (at least not in the next 10-20 years?) but it will provide new assets, applications and services (e.g. Bitcoin as a reserve value, prediction markets, tokenized assets, Cryptokitties and others as forms of digitally scarce collectibles, etc). As it was the case with the Internet and the Web when browsers that were the first to add graphics and hyperlinks helped embark the next generation of users, new interfaces are needed to transition from niches uses of decentralised protocols to mass-market appeal.  The bet here is that the equivalent of the browser will be the “wallet”. Digital wallets are increasingly becoming a key part of our digital and physical life. They already are in China where Wechat can be considered the equivalent of a digital wallet and that is clearly where Coinbase is moving to as well with the [rebrand of Toshi into Coinbase Wallet](https://blog.coinbase.com/goodbye-toshi-hello-coinbase-wallet-the-easiest-and-most-secure-crypto-wallet-and-browser-4ba6e52e4913) incl chat functionality (and why David Marcus left the board as Facebook is working on their own initiative). Balance is focused on building the most elegant and useful mobile wallet for interacting with economics protocols. Whether the open source banking vision materialises or not, I think backing a great product team building a digital wallet in a very unique way makes a lot sense.** \n **\n\nThe team...My conviction is largely based on Richard as a very unique individual. I’m intrigued and fascinated by his journey/quest and have been very impressed by his trajectory in the last 12 months. I have seen how his vision, energy and determination have all come together to make some decisions (stop remote working with decentralised team) and start to ship some really interesting products while becoming extremely visible in the space and publishing some great content. His productivity in the last 2-3 months has been insane.  I have never seen a more missionary founder than him. As a result, he can be very intense and I suspect it’s not always easy to work with him but I have no doubt about his integrity. He’s honest, generous and not doing this for the money. \n\nRisks: ** \n **\n\n* Market: there is a big macro risk in this industry due to volatility, regulation, etc.\n* Competition: There are a lot of crypto wallets out there. The main competitor is Coinbase. They are already the leaders in converting people from fiat to crypto via their main product. With the Toshi app that has just been rebranded to Coinbase wallet this week, they are moving into Balance territory. Coinbase has demonstrated an amazing ability to execute (e.g. one of the few exchanges that hasn’t been hacked) and buying a lot of teams/talent. However, there are some reasons why I think Balance is unique and could thrive. Coinbase wallet is one project among many others at Coinbase (between their retail product, institutional platforms, etc), they are already a large company doing lots of things and “stuck” into a very profitable business model. Then, and more importantly, Coinbase is effectively rebuilding a centralised bank. Anyone who has tried to withdraw money from their accounts can testify that it’s not straightforward, you’re not really in control. While their mission to build a more open financial system is very similar to Balance, there is a fundamental philosophical difference that will impact their product, their talent, their culture. Balance wants to build an open-source and decentralised bank. Their code is already completely open source. In a way Coinbase is still very much a web 2.0 company building on web 3.0 tech (which is why they are pushing their wallet as their web 3.0 product), Balance wants to be the native wallet for web 3.0. The opportunity to back a talented team and company wanting to challenge Coinbase with a fundamentally different and ambitious approach and philosophy is I think extremely exciting (but obviously hard)\n* Technological risks: The success of Balance will depend on the success of projects and the continued development of the decentralised architecture. These economic protocols will have to work and deliver real value beyond speculation and a lot of the building blocks for an open and decentralised financial system like identity, recoverability, etc are still being built. \n* Richard: I think he’s a total outlier and he’s a big reason for my excitement but I also think his personality could be a challenge. I trust his values and intentions but he is very intense, opinionated,  etc and is very open about his personal challenges.\n\nFund returner: there is no clear business model yet. Because of the competition and Richard’s philosophy we shouldn’t expect them to simply charge fees on each transaction like Coinbase. However, if they become the gateway into economic protocols and attract millions of users, I have no doubt they will capture some important value. Great UI and consumer products will be rewarded. He wrote a great blog post about the business model and his emerging ideas, presenting hash fees as the new cash flow source. They want to support the protocols that have the potential to generate positive hashflow and by bringing people through these protocols help increase the amount of hashes flowing through and eventually capturing some of it.

{"id": "cdQbgVbRgjb6n8ygmTkd7ZBjyFr2r2vRoY5FKb4Hj7I", "title": "MIM 正在挑战 MakerDAO？读懂 MIM 发明者的三个 DeFi 项目", "body": "> Abracadabra 创始人 Daniele Sestagalli 还通过 LP 收益优化器 Popsicle Finance、Avalanche 上的 OlympusDAO 分叉项目 Wonderland，引发了「占领 DeFi」热潮。\n\n**撰文：Karen**\n\n过去两个月内，基于生息资产的借贷协议 Abracadabra 的治理代币 SPELL 暴涨 60 倍，同期锁仓量激增 7 倍达到了近 30 亿美元，作为 Abracadabra 创始人的 Daniele Sestagalli 在加密社区颇受关注，而其在加密领领域的布局远不止此，LP 收益优化器 Popsicle Finance、Avalanche 上的 OlympusDAO 分叉项目 Wonderland 也是他的「杰作」。\n\n根据公开资料，Daniele Sestagalli 毕业于巴拿马美洲大学建筑系，在构建这三个项目之前，Daniele Sestagalli 曾在 2016 年创立区块链初创公司 Zulu Republi，也是基于区块链的音乐科技平台 Utopia Genesis Foundation 的首席战略官。\n\n### Abracadabra：正在挑战 MakerDAO？\n\nAbracadabra 势头迅猛是 Daniele Sestagalli 知名度得以大幅提升的主要驱动力。Abracadabra 允许用户通过存入生息资产来借入美元稳定币 MIM （神奇的互联网货币），目前支持以太坊、币安智能链、Avalanche、Fantom 和 Arbitrum One，并上线了耕种、借贷、质押、兑换和跨链桥等功能。关于 Abracadabra 具体的功能和双代币模型可参考阅读《[已上线 Arbitrum 的 Abracadabra 如何通过生息资产构建链上稳定币协议？](https://www.chainnews.com/articles/483003047935.htm)》。\n\nAbracadabra 凭借多链部署、支持使用多种生息资产和少数加密货币借入稳定币以帮助提升资金利用率的优势，「正在挑战稳定币协议龙头项目 MakerDAO」的言论也不无道理，诸如，MIM 流通量突破 18 亿美元，目前为 Dai 的 26%，据 CoinGekco 数据，按稳定币流通量来看已超越 Pax Dollar （USDP）、TrueUSD （TUSD）位列第六；锁仓量达到了 MakerDAO 的五分之一；SPELL 持有地址数达到 2.3 万，接近 MKR 的三分之一；近一周在以太坊链上 sSPELL 的费用收入是 MakerDAO 的两倍。\n\n![MIM 正在挑战 MakerDAO？读懂 MIM 发明者的三个 DeFi 项目](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/e63cfa988ccb51629bb95ac765c3546b_MxjXvXg.png-article)\n\n在近期的进展方面，Abracadabra 还与 Terra 达成了合作，根据 The Defiant，合作可能包括 MIM-UST 流动性池和 LUNA 抵押品，允许用户用他们的 LUNA 代币借入 MIM。Abracadabra 另一核心贡献者 Squirrel 还提出与 Tornado.cash 合作的提案，以将 MIM 也发展成注重隐私的稳定币，不过当前尚不清楚具体的合作细节。\n\nAbracadabra 联合创始人 Squirrel [告诉](https://thedefiant.io/abracadabra-mim-stablecoin-makerdao/) The Defiant，这个项目成功的秘诀是多方面的，几乎仅支持生息资产作为抵押品的可组合性特点即保留了生息资产的利息，还能同时借入资金，另一方面，Abracadabra 的费用结构也非常有吸引力，75% 的协议费用会用来购买 SPELL，然后分发给 sSPELL 持有者，20% 会被分配到金库来激励 MIM 流动性池。\n\n### Popsicle Finance：LP 收益优化器\n\n而在推出 Abracadabra 之前，即，今年一季度末，Daniele Sestagalli 还和 Squirrel 为想要提供流动性的用户推出了一个多链收益率优化平台 Popsicle Finance （ICE），Popsicle 是冰棒的意思。Popsicle Finance 的工作机制是，在接收用户提供的资产后，通过自动比较多个区块链上多个 AMM 机制的 DEX 的资金池，来为用户将资金部署到收益最优的资金池中。\n\nPopsicle Finance 支持的网络有以太坊、币安智能链和 Fantom，还计划支持 Tron、Polygon、Solana 和波卡，产品有针对 Uniswap V3 设计的 Sorbetto Fragola、LP 收益优化优化器 Sorbetto Limone、借贷协议 Gelateria 以及 USDT 包装器 Frapped.io。\n\n其中，Sorbetto Fragola 专为引入范围内挂单（Range Orders）的 Uniswap V3 设计，会根据历史波动率数据积极帮助用户管理流动性和提升在 Uniswap V3 的资本效率，而对于用户来说，通过 Sorbetto Fragola 仅存入单边资产或对应实时比例的双边资产，就可以收到份额代币 PLP （Popsicle Liquidity Provision），然后其他策略参数都交由 Sorbetto Fragola 上的策略上运行。\n\nSorbetto Limone 就是前面所说的多链流动性收益优化器，会将用户的流动性部署到在多个网络上收益最优的去中心化交易所中。目前 Sorbetto Limone 还在开发中，可能会在近期上线。就流动性提供者而言，不必手动查询和切换流动性即可享受最优收益，还可节省很大一部分 Gas 费，而对于整个生态系统来说，流动性也会变得更有效，交易者也能享受到最好的价格。\n\n与此同时，Daniele Sestaylor 将平台上 LP 代币 PLP 的作用也发挥到最大化。根据 Popsicle Finance [文档](https://docs.popsicle.finance/)，还会推出一个借贷协议 Gelateria，允许用户抵押 LP 代币 PLP 来借入资产。另外，Frapped.io 已在币安智能链和 Fantom Opera 上推出 FUSDt。\n\n而关于治理代币 ICE，今年 7 月份，Popsicle Finance 团队在权衡协议的营销预算、激励方案以及项目的受欢迎程度之后，提出销毁原定总供应量的 64.98%（主要销毁潜在的 LP 奖励）的提案，并在几天之内获得通过并完成销毁。\n\n![image (1).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/9d68a7e2cf5e5791b16670b6bf8f56ec_cflI2R9.png-article)\n\n![image (2).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/0dbf2d341f9c5af6a23df223d140d33a_9KxlHnd.png-article)\n\n那么，治理代币 ICE 是如何在 Popsicle Finance 平台上发挥作用的呢？除治理作用外，该平台产品收取的所有绩效费（当前为利润的 10%，当前正在提议增加到 20%）会以 ICE 的形式分发给 nICE 持有者，nICE 是用户抵押 ICE 至 nICE 池后得到的存款凭证。\n\n不幸的是，今年 8 月初，Popsicle Finance 遭到黑客攻击损失了约 2000 万美元，之后将受到影响的 Sorbetto Fragola 产品下架并计划在经过四重审机等流程后重启。同时，Popsicle Finance 发布较为独特的赔偿计划，首先从 IronBank 获得了 100 万美元的贷款，偿还了受损资金的 5%，然后在之后的每个月中会至少获得 50 万美元的贷款来偿还用户资金。 此外，Popsicle Finance 还会制作两款 NFT，一款空投给受影响用户，一款（共 1 万个）会通过拍卖出售，出售资金也会用来偿还被盗资金。另一方面 Daniele Sestagalli 也承诺会在 1 年之内从其个人额度中拿出 100 万枚 ICE 来偿还受影响用户。\n\n可以看到，Popsicle Finance 遭遇黑客攻击后在安全流程、协议启动规划以及赔偿等方面后迅速响应，并提出了令用户比较满意的补偿方案。有趣的是，ICE 的价格项目在被盗当日跌约 40% 之后的两个月内，大涨 16 倍至 24 美元左右，按当前价格来算，Daniele Sestagalli 承诺要补偿的这 100 万枚代币的价值就已超被盗资金。\n\n### Wonderland：Avalanche 上的 OlympusDAO 分叉项目\n\n算法稳定币项目 Wonderland （TIME）也是在 Avalanche 上推出的 OlympusDAO 分叉项目，Wonderland 的中文意思为仙境。该项目最初为匿名项目，之后，Daniele Sestagalli 在推特承认为其开发。\n\n在 Wonderland 中，每个 TIME 代币都由金库中的一篮子资产提供支持，包括 MIM、TIME-AVAX LP 代币等，也仿照 OlympusDAO 引入了质押和铸造将激励设计机制和博弈论结合起来。需要注意的是，1 个 TIME 的价值由 MIM 提供支持（而非挂钩），这意味着，TIME 的交易价格会始终高于 1MIM，而当 TIME 的交易价格低于 1MIM 时，协议就会回购并销毁 TIME，以将 TIME 价格助推至 1MIM 以上。\n\n参考阅读：《[Olympus 是庞氏还是创新？从大师级的激励设计机制谈起](https://www.chainnews.com/articles/951499499761.htm)》\n\n从用户层面来看，有两种参与 Wonderland 的方式，其一是质押 TIME 通过自动复利来赚取更多的 TIME，实质上，是质押 TIME 后可获得 MEMO （质押凭证），然后 MEMO 余额会根据当前的收益率每 8 小时通过复利自动增加；其二是铸币，即提供 LP 代币（包括 TIME-AVAX LP 或 TIME-MIM LP）、MIM 或 wAVAX 来以折扣价铸造（或购买） TIME，不过，需要在铸造 5 日后完全释放。\n\n另一方面，协议为其金库获得了流动性，随着获得的流动性越来越多，也能够进一步赚取到更多的做市商佣金，增加协议收入。这部分收入会由金库来铸造 TIME，然后再将很大一部分分发给 TIME 质押者，从而保证系统的稳定性和 PCV （协议控制价值）。\n\n截止撰稿时，Wonderland 的金库余额为 1.34 亿美元，TIME 总质押率为 8.7 万枚。值得注意的是，Wonderland 当前未经审计，可能还存在一定安全隐患。\n\n![image (3).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/88bef1c082565b2484812e6c7923ebd9_J4TQxO7.png-article)\n\n### 小结\n\n综上，Abracadabra 提供给用户利用生息资产借入 MIM 的能力，可能会将 MIM 打造成更广泛的 DeFi 储备稳定币，Popsicle Finance 会自动帮助用户将流动性放至收益最优且最需流动性的资金池中，同时还将进一步推出允许用户抵押平台上 LP 代币来借入资产的借贷协议，而 OlympusDAO 分叉项目 Wonderland 同时使协议流动性和用户双方受益的设计或将形成一个正反馈机制。\n\n另一方面，更加去中心化且可用生息资产借款的稳定币 MIM，SPELL、TIME 和 ICE 三个协议治理代币，包括各自的质押凭证兼生息资产 sSPELL、MEMO、nICE，也可供用户在这三个协议中互相作用和「循环套娃」来最大化资本效率。\n\n在 Daniele Sestagalli 驱动的真正去中心化的运动「占领 DeFi」（OccupyDeFi）热潮之下，Daniele Sestagalli 作为这三个项目的创始人，通过聚焦流动性收益的最优化、流动性代币的充分利用、生息资产的资本效率最大化等需求，再结合协议自身费用结构、多链设计、可组合性以及激励措施，掀起了足够大的浪花。\n\n虽然这三款产品均为今年发布，但项目的执行力还是不错的，不管是在产品技术、合作进展还是项目表现来看取得了不错的成果。Popsicle Finance 发生过安全事故，不过从社区反应来看用户对该项目的应对方案和进展还是比较认可的。而且 Popsicle Finance 竞品较少，随着 Popsicle Finance 的重新启动以及 LP 收益优化器的即将推出，能否凭借先发优势占领在 DeFi 流动性中抢占份额值得期待。但与此同时，这些协议也存在治理代币在短中期内的通胀压力、缺乏安全审计报告以及有「循环套娃」引发的清算等风险。\n\n>

{"id": "0Jabfsy-ZC3q5DhX1eSV07BY-F_oufdni2a_WSqDVeQ", "title": "OHM token strategy", "body": "I recently got into OHM, the native token for Olympus DAO. Hearing the develop on the Bankless podcast helped me feel a bit better about owning their token and using the platform. Last year I bought CRV and MIR tokens, of which i’ve been holding CRV on Aave to get a reasonable APR%, and for MIR i’ve staked a good chunk on their platform and received huge rewards for the first few months, 400-700% APR, which slowly trickled down to a nice 50% APR for the past few months. CRV is obviously huge for enabling layered DeFi assets and providing stablecoins to the masses, and developers, but MIR is less known as it connects with the Terra blockchain ecosystem. Terra has proven itself worthy with the rise of its LUNA native token, and its stablecoin becoming widely used throughout all of crypto. Having experienced new aspects of DeFi, and CeFi with the likes of NEXO, I’m on the look out for the next step in this space and I think OHM is really important right now.\n\nWith 8,000% APR, OHM is impossible to pass up at this moment in time. Even better, OHM doesn’t require the usage of Uniswap to create it’s LP; this means you only need to buy OHM to create the LP token, there’s no need to add ETH or some stablecoin. I’m personally not interested in adding my ETH to any sort of liquidity pool system for the foreseeable future -- So, not having to add ETH or some stablecoin to create an LP token on the Olympus DAO protocol is a huge thumbs up for me. I’ve purchased about 10 OHM tokens and subsequently staked them for about 2 weeks. As such i’ve gotten roughly 2 OHM as rewards during that time.\n\nMy experience holding MIR token for the past year gives me hope that projects like OHM will at least last longer than one year and will become increasingly profitable over time using this strategy: Buy the token, stake it for a year, unstake it and then sell for a stablecoin. Depending on how you feel about the project after 1 year, you can continue to stake for another year, or cash in and move on to something else. Hopefully within that 1 year time frame the asset has at least doubled, 100% increase, or more then that’s a great investment to be had! The rewards you collected will need to be sold 1 year after you obtained them, which might be difficult to calculate for each protocol, but ultimately these assets *are* capital gains related and should be taxed as such. Keep this in mind. \n\nOHM has a great feature in that you can connect to Fuse on Rari Capital and use your sOHM tokens as collateral for a loan in USDC/DAI ! This is crazy good, as i can take my rewards for staking OHM, take a loan out on them, and use it for whatever else i need! If anything I could sent it to NEXO and get 10% interest or take a loan out on it as a direct deposit into my checking/debit account. \n\nI love DeFi and am excited to see what else happens in the coming year!", "timestamp": 1635504205, "digest": "CpgPy_NdAElDE5yyu3kyYqSXRdQO1x1TXLXDnnkZzhg", "contributor": "0x1a90E8028eAeCb9D839678a6c12dc28e74164c06"}
{"id": "EZyst7u9fg5G4AiulyLrpgIn9bs9W3o00T-ytYG3XSM", "title": "Mint prices should be in fiat, not crypto.", "body": "## At least for most projects out there! \n\nA couple of weeks ago, we wrote a comprehensive post outlining what we believe is a worrying development in the NFT space. ICYMI, read up on it here: \n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x473803aBB217127321fcF961830E6E31192e7083/uKq19v3FRbUZz1xRjYlFgVqWGYjjp4K213rUIXZmLqg](https://mirror.xyz/0x473803aBB217127321fcF961830E6E31192e7083/uKq19v3FRbUZz1xRjYlFgVqWGYjjp4K213rUIXZmLqg)\n\nWith the recent bull run of crypto currencies in general and Ethereum, that is host to most NFT projects, in particular, we see the main premise of our post confirmed: That in fact, mint prices for NFT projects are entirely disconnected from reality. Now that ETH price has risen significantly, floor prices of countless NFT projects are dropping. Obviously, there are some other factors at play, but rising ETH prices should explain at least a good chunk of the variance.  \n  \n Of course, we are not only running our own project with the Ghostwriters Guild, but are also active members of various other NFT communities. We are generally interested in knowing what’s going on in the space and it’s important to us to critically evaluate what makes projects valueable and legitimate and draw our own conclusions. One of the questions we have asked ourselves countless times is why mint prices are set in **ETH and not in say, fiat.** With the recent surge, this has become more relevant than ever. \n\nThere are two obvious and some less obvious answers to this question. The most obvious ones being “*fuck fiat!*” and “*you’re paying to mint in ETH anyway, so that’s naturally the currency prices are set in*”. One emotional and one seemingly logical response. But both hypothetical responses would be missing the point: We’re not asking why *payment* is in ETH, but rather why the *value of the NFT* is denominated in ETH. A very important distinction which is highlighted by the following question I’ve seen asked in a very popular NFT project (and which hasn’t received any response yet). \n\n![A question that was posted in the discord of a very popular NFT project](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j7Fu121Rp7RP8CwFCt0pB.JPG?height=83&width=606)\n\nThe user asks a legitimate question and the answer isn’t entirely straight-forward. There are only two logical scenarios from a project’s standpoint: \n\n**Scenario 1** \n\nThe project’s expenses are all calculated and paid for in ETH. The project pays devs, artists and for the entire infrastructure in ETH. In this case, it would be somewhat reasonable to set NFT values in ETH and not make any changes regardless of the price flactuation. The project owners / collaborators would assume the risk of the price fluctuation which could be considered fair to some degree. \n\n**Scenario 2**\n\nThe projects expenses are calculated and paid for in fiat. In this case, it is only reasonable to adjust mint prices based on the initial calculation – lowering the mint price in a bull market and increasing it in a bear market. \n\n## Reality checking NFT projects. \n\nIn fact, we have seen scenario 2 play out various times in projects that we have been involved in as community members, which does beg the questions: Why did these projects denominate their NFT’s value in ETH to begin with? If you’re changing the mint fee in accordance to current ETH prices, you’re essentially admitting that you’ve been calculating in fiat all along. So naturally, wouldn’t it be reasonable for both, transparency’s sake and for the sake of your own financial planning to set fixed prices in fiat currency and adjust to whatever that translates into ahead of the mint? \n\nWe have made the experience that most expenses for NFT projects, an the Ghostwriters Guild is no exception, have to be actually paid in fiat currencies. We’re paying for web services, developers, artists and smaller expenses like discord server boosts in USD or EUR. For our project, neither a fixed nor a flexible ETH price set in advance would make any sense really and as such, we will be issuing the price for our PFP collection in USD and to whatever number that translates to in ETH once mint date rolls around. Payment will still place in ETH – naturally. ", "timestamp": 1635504167, "digest": "Z9hCcTtxGdQ4bJ6tdFcTdFydxcQBZVh0WlFFHmkcQUI", "contributor": "0x473803aBB217127321fcF961830E6E31192e7083"}
