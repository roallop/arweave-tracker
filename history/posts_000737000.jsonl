Organizations that used to be started alone. Now are started together.\n\nThrough the rise of the Creator Economy, Crypto, Web3, Automation, and No-code, individuals and collectives can form, raise capital then build things at a speed that we haven't seen before in traditional markets.

They are sold at a specific time (where you can mint them) and they act as a gateway to being part of a community. An algorithm creates a randomized NFT by combining attributes such as background, clothes, or accessories. These traits have unequal distribution, so certain avatars are favored above others. People are always looking for the rarest and most aesthetic avatars because these made the best profile pictures (PFP).\n\nThe number of unique users who acquired the NFTs and the price floor define the early success of the collectible project. Users don’t know what NFT they will receive until they purchase it through the website. Buyers' behavior mimics that of gamblers, who place bets in the hopes of winning an avatar with unique characteristics. Collectors are often compelled to buy multiple items to boost their chances of obtaining the best-looking NFT to multiply their initial value.\n\n**How it all started?**\n\nThis whole trend began in 2017 with CryptoPunks, one of the first NFT collectibles. Larva Labs hit all the right notes with their concept's simplicity, laying the groundwork for future projects. CryptoPunks has gone a long way since its humble beginnings in a remote corner of the internet and is now the top-grossing NFT collection. The punks' strength stems in part from being the first avatar collection craze at the time, but blaming it on this merely undervalues the creativity of the concept. Collectibles have been around since kids traded sports cards, but turning them into an avatar to be used as a symbol of identity was a brilliant move. As a profile photo, the CryptoPunk identified people as part of a bigger whole that stood for something and revolted against centralized finance.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11934913-5f8c-44f4-89a0-e8ed9497ded1.png?height=630&width=1200)\n\n**How did they become mainstream?**\n\nWhen the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched in early May 2021, it built on the foundations laid down by CryptoPunks. BAYC became the first true NFT-club by combining the fundamentals of avatarisation and community-building with a layer of exclusivity. They have several perks like BAYC-radio and members-only goods. The enigmatic promise that the apes will \"unlock digital doors for you\" makes it even more exclusive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1e6beb7a-552c-4332-84d6-57940004aad3.png?height=666&width=1000)\n\nAfter the initial boom, they kept pioneering the space when they gifted a dog companion (Bored Ape Kennel Club) to every ape owner, raising the ape value and adding a new dog NFT worth 1.5 ETH (around $3,000) before it was revealed.\n\n**What are the most popular projects out there?**\n\nThere are more than 50 projects out there, and the numbers are rapidly increasing each week.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d459dd1a-8d67-480c-b1bd-99a2b1045f60.png?height=748&width=1479)\n\nApart from the two previously mentioned projects, other great contenders to become the new best NFT collectible project are (in no order):\n\n- Cool Cats\n- Gutter Cat Gang\n- Meebits\n- VeeFriends\n- The Wicked Craniums\n- DeadHeads\n- GoatZ\n- The Alien Boy\n- … and many more\n\n**What the future holds?**\n\nSince BAYC, several projects followed that path and launched their collectible project. Some of them have a lower (Gutter Cat Gang with 3,000) or a higher collection (The Wicked Craniums with 10,762), and others have added new mechanisms like forging 2 NFTs into 1 (The Forge by GoatZ).\n\nTo grasp the current scale, you must look at the sales figures. For instance, Mike Tyson just spent $10,000 on a cartoon cat avatar.\n\nCommercial Rights, which are transferred with the token, could also bring to the owners some profit from their asset. There are talks of a movie being made with DeadHeads, which could give a flow of payments to asset holders whose PFPs are used in the film.\n\nA new utility for holding these avatars is being announced each passing week. From exclusive merch to airdrops, breeding, or a place in the metaverse for the community.\n\nWe're still months or years away from true acceptance, but when more built-out 3D virtual environments like Decentraland and Sandbox are used, NFT PFP holders will be able to utilize their PFPs as a 3D avatar in the metaverse world. This will give the assets more shape and utility.\n\nDisclaimer: We are proud owners of several of these NFT collectibles, so we’re looking forward to seeing how this space evolves and what it can bring to holders.\n\n## DAOs\nby Awisemaninmotion\n\nDAOs are to 2021 what Defi was to 2020.\n\nAs is natural with any trend, you're going to get all kinds of takes on what it is and what it isn't. \nEarly adapters are going to go through experimental growing pains, and those who are paying attention to the ecosystem at large are poised to make the best strides going forward. \n\nIn other words, these are the nascent days of DAOs. To be part of one is to be part of an ongoing experiment that will (hopefully) change the way the world interacts and collaborates. \n\nHowever, like with any new and exciting idea, it can be easy to loose the forest from the trees.\n\nThe people who can speak to running a DAO are outnumbered by those who have questions about running one.\n\nSome of the most common comments I've heard so far regarding DAOs and Web3 have been:\n\nShould I start a DAO on Discord or Telegram? Is Slack still a thing? \n\n- When/how should I mint a token? \n- What web3 wallet should I use? \n- What's a test network/sub chain?\n- Are DAOs just places to talk about NFTs and Crypto?\n\nIf you've been part of a DAO for awhile, the questions get more granular:\n\n- Where is that article/tweet/meme someone posted the other day?\n- Where do I find (insert question here)?\n- When are we going to mint our token?\n- Should we be voting on everything?\n- What do we do with users who just hang around and don't want to actively participate? \n- The Discord and the Discourse are in Disarray and I'm at a loss for what to Do.\n\nDAOs have many things to work through, but one of the most pressing things I see is how to scale one from an operations point of view. Discord may be the chat platform of choice at the moment, but it wasn't made for the kind of dynamic collaboration DAOs strive to become. \nMore activity and more members come at the expense of lost links and buried knowledge. \n\nUnless you have a background in project management or worked in operations, you're likely to overlook this problem until you can't ignore it. The truth is that if you're all in on DAOs, or collaboration in the web3 world you WILL eventually have this problem. \n\nSince we are currently in a web 2.5 world, and will realistically be in this hybrid state for at least few years, what tools can you use to get ahead of this problem? \n\nTo answer this, you have to ask yourself a few questions:\n\n- [ ]  Are you a web3 maximalist that is opposed to a web2 solution?\n- [ ]  Are you willing to solve for now, and figure out how to transition to something thats on chain in the future?\n- [ ]  Are you putting community or technology first?\n\nOnce you honestly answer those questions then you can look for a solution that fits your view. Although, depending on how you answered, not all of these questions have clear solutions. \n\nTo clarify, it's not that there aren't tools to solve aspects of these problems, but each comes with their own issues, and not all play nicely with each other. \n\nRemember, you're a glorified beta tester in an experimental ecosystem. A vast majority of the roads are still under construction ⚠️ and gaps are the norm. \n\nHowever, if you currently run a DAO, one of the most important questions to ask yourself is: \nCan you afford to wait it out for a solution that doesn't currently exist?  \n\nScaling is a natural part of growth and success. There's only so long one can wait on technology, and the more you grow and take on, the less time you likely have to wait. \nI'd rather solve for now and adapt accordingly. As Shiny starts to take its next form in the web3 world, I was adamant on implementing a solution that can work alongside Discord. I didn't want to replace it, but I also didn't want to rely on it.\n\nThat meant building a solution that can currently: \n\n- [ ]  Let those who want to participate have their own space to see what they're responsible for.\n- [ ]  Let teams see a top-level view of the projects they're part of, and see progress in real-time.\n- [ ]  Let people work asynchronously\n- [ ]  Let contributors see what team meetings they're part of, as well as community meetings they would like to be a part of.\n- [ ]  Allow for meetings to be properly documented \n(This means having the ability to get a high-level overview of what was discussed, including access to an audio recording of the meeting if one was recorded)\n- [ ]  Let users assign tasks during a meeting, and have those tasks automatically show up inside participants dashboards.\n\nThis Mirror post was conceived on call and then devised and completed on such a setup. It allowed us to do all of the above in a fluent way. \n\nIf organizing and distributing tasks and bounties are pain points your DAO is currently experiencing, reach out.\n\n## No-code\nby Dykso\n\n**What does the word NoCode mean to you?**\n\nIf you had to explain it to your family, could you summarize it in one sentence? I say maybe since the NoCode space can be broken down into multiple solution verticals. Sometimes I think we try to stuff too much meaning into the NoCode term and marketing teams love to overuse the word.  To us, NoCode is enabling solutions to be implemented by non-coders that are usually implemented by development teams.  The complexity of the solution being implemented can vary drastically and some NoCode tools are targeted at developers that are looking to expedite the implementation of solutions.\n\nAs someone new to the NoCode space, you might find it difficult to determine what effort you will need to invest and become proficient in implementing solutions using NoCode tools. In this short write-up, we will discuss the web application builders vertical to give you an idea of the effort it could take to get comfortable with these tools.\n\nSo what type of NoCode tool falls into the web application builder category? It’s a tool that allows you to build the front-end user interface of your website application at the minimum but it could go way beyond that in the features you’re provided with.  This category is very busy and it keeps evolving every week as seen in our discord NoCode channels at Shiny.\n\nWe feel the best way to present this information is through a matrix that rates the website builders in a few key areas on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is the high score. This will allow you to make a decision where to start with your next website project.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8005153e-34e9-43e4-846f-cc6a23992a5d.jpeg?height=381&width=632)\n\nOur evaluations are really based on first impressions from an end-user perspective, we assume you are not a professional website designer or builder.  We also wanted to give you some idea of how well these products support you as you start your journey with these tools.  Some of these tools will require you to have familiarity with connecting to 3rd party data sources that host your website databases.  We call them data integrations and this will require an additional investment of time on your part to learn.  \n\nThat's it for now but if you read this far thank you for your attention!\n\nWe appreciate everyone who's working hard to bring more people into these spaces and look forward to helping!\n\nIf there is anything you think you'd like to build or need help with then please let us know on build@shinyobjects.gg.\n\nShiny Object SC", "timestamp": 1627483616, "digest": "rw7-SaSszEVHtoOFW9T9d8KdxZeq1CTRkhYmDxEVKDw", "contributor": "0x54681ac94D4e3C8F58F54B576B654DC2D1950ae0"}

They are sold at a specific time (where you can mint them) and they act as a gateway to being part of a community. An algorithm creates a randomized NFT by combining attributes such as background, clothes, or accessories. These traits have unequal distribution, so certain avatars are favored above others. People are always looking for the rarest and most aesthetic avatars because these made the best profile pictures (PFP).\n\nThe number of unique users who acquired the NFTs and the price floor define the early success of the collectible project. Users don’t know what NFT they will receive until they purchase it through the website. Buyers' behavior mimics that of gamblers, who place bets in the hopes of winning an avatar with unique characteristics. Collectors are often compelled to buy multiple items to boost their chances of obtaining the best-looking NFT to multiply their initial value.\n\n**How it all started?**\n\nThis whole trend began in 2017 with CryptoPunks, one of the first NFT collectibles. Larva Labs hit all the right notes with their concept's simplicity, laying the groundwork for future projects. CryptoPunks has gone a long way since its humble beginnings in a remote corner of the internet and is now the top-grossing NFT collection. The punks' strength stems in part from being the first avatar collection craze at the time, but blaming it on this merely undervalues the creativity of the concept. Collectibles have been around since kids traded sports cards, but turning them into an avatar to be used as a symbol of identity was a brilliant move. As a profile photo, the CryptoPunk identified people as part of a bigger whole that stood for something and revolted against centralized finance.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11934913-5f8c-44f4-89a0-e8ed9497ded1.png?height=630&width=1200)\n\n**How did they become mainstream?**\n\nWhen the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched in early May 2021, it built on the foundations laid down by CryptoPunks. BAYC became the first true NFT-club by combining the fundamentals of avatarisation and community-building with a layer of exclusivity. They have several perks like BAYC-radio and members-only goods. The enigmatic promise that the apes will \"unlock digital doors for you\" makes it even more exclusive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1e6beb7a-552c-4332-84d6-57940004aad3.png?height=666&width=1000)\n\nAfter the initial boom, they kept pioneering the space when they gifted a dog companion (Bored Ape Kennel Club) to every ape owner, raising the ape value and adding a new dog NFT worth 1.5 ETH (around $3,000) before it was revealed.\n\n**What are the most popular projects out there?**\n\nThere are more than 50 projects out there, and the numbers are rapidly increasing each week.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d459dd1a-8d67-480c-b1bd-99a2b1045f60.png?height=748&width=1479)\n\nApart from the two previously mentioned projects, other great contenders to become the new best NFT collectible project are (in no order):\n\n- Cool Cats\n- Gutter Cat Gang\n- Meebits\n- VeeFriends\n- The Wicked Craniums\n- DeadHeads\n- GoatZ\n- The Alien Boy\n- … and many more\n\n**What the future holds?**\n\nSince BAYC, several projects followed that path and launched their collectible project. Some of them have a lower (Gutter Cat Gang with 3,000) or a higher collection (The Wicked Craniums with 10,762), and others have added new mechanisms like forging 2 NFTs into 1 (The Forge by GoatZ).\n\nTo grasp the current scale, you must look at the sales figures. For instance, Mike Tyson just spent $10,000 on a cartoon cat avatar.\n\nCommercial Rights, which are transferred with the token, could also bring to the owners some profit from their asset. There are talks of a movie being made with DeadHeads, which could give a flow of payments to asset holders whose PFPs are used in the film.\n\nA new utility for holding these avatars is being announced each passing week. From exclusive merch to airdrops, breeding, or a place in the metaverse for the community.\n\nWe're still months or years away from true acceptance, but when more built-out 3D virtual environments like Decentraland and Sandbox are used, NFT PFP holders will be able to utilize their PFPs as a 3D avatar in the metaverse world. This will give the assets more shape and utility.\n\nDisclaimer: We are proud owners of several of these NFT collectibles, so we’re looking forward to seeing how this space evolves and what it can bring to holders.\n\n## DAOs\nby Awisemaninmotion\n\nDAOs are to 2021 what Defi was to 2020.\n\nAs is natural with any trend, you're going to get all kinds of takes on what it is and what it isn't. \nEarly adapters are going to go through experimental growing pains, and those who are paying attention to the ecosystem at large are poised to make the best strides going forward. \n\nIn other words, these are the nascent days of DAOs. To be part of one is to be part of an ongoing experiment that will (hopefully) change the way the world interacts and collaborates. \n\nHowever, like with any new and exciting idea, it can be easy to loose the forest from the trees.\n\nThe people who can speak to running a DAO are outnumbered by those who have questions about running one.\n\nSome of the most common comments I've heard so far regarding DAOs and Web3 have been:\n\nShould I start a DAO on Discord or Telegram? Is Slack still a thing? \n\n- When/how should I mint a token? \n- What web3 wallet should I use? \n- What's a test network/sub chain?\n- Are DAOs just places to talk about NFTs and Crypto?\n\nIf you've been part of a DAO for awhile, the questions get more granular:\n\n- Where is that article/tweet/meme someone posted the other day?\n- Where do I find (insert question here)?\n- When are we going to mint our token?\n- Should we be voting on everything?\n- What do we do with users who just hang around and don't want to actively participate? \n- The Discord and the Discourse are in Disarray and I'm at a loss for what to Do.\n\nDAOs have many things to work through, but one of the most pressing things I see is how to scale one from an operations point of view. Discord may be the chat platform of choice at the moment, but it wasn't made for the kind of dynamic collaboration DAOs strive to become. \nMore activity and more members come at the expense of lost links and buried knowledge. \n\nUnless you have a background in project management or worked in operations, you're likely to overlook this problem until you can't ignore it. The truth is that if you're all in on DAOs, or collaboration in the web3 world you WILL eventually have this problem. \n\nSince we are currently in a web 2.5 world, and will realistically be in this hybrid state for at least few years, what tools can you use to get ahead of this problem? \n\nTo answer this, you have to ask yourself a few questions:\n\n- [ ]  Are you a web3 maximalist that is opposed to a web2 solution?\n- [ ]  Are you willing to solve for now, and figure out how to transition to something thats on chain in the future?\n- [ ]  Are you putting community or technology first?\n\nOnce you honestly answer those questions then you can look for a solution that fits your view. Although, depending on how you answered, not all of these questions have clear solutions. \n\nTo clarify, it's not that there aren't tools to solve aspects of these problems, but each comes with their own issues, and not all play nicely with each other. \n\nRemember, you're a glorified beta tester in an experimental ecosystem. A vast majority of the roads are still under construction ⚠️ and gaps are the norm. \n\nHowever, if you currently run a DAO, one of the most important questions to ask yourself is: \nCan you afford to wait it out for a solution that doesn't currently exist?  \n\nScaling is a natural part of growth and success. There's only so long one can wait on technology, and the more you grow and take on, the less time you likely have to wait. \nI'd rather solve for now and adapt accordingly. As Shiny starts to take its next form in the web3 world, I was adamant on implementing a solution that can work alongside Discord. I didn't want to replace it, but I also didn't want to rely on it.\n\nThat meant building a solution that can currently: \n\n- [ ]  Let those who want to participate have their own space to see what they're responsible for.\n- [ ]  Let teams see a top-level view of the projects they're part of, and see progress in real-time.\n- [ ]  Let people work asynchronously\n- [ ]  Let contributors see what team meetings they're part of, as well as community meetings they would like to be a part of.\n- [ ]  Allow for meetings to be properly documented \n(This means having the ability to get a high-level overview of what was discussed, including access to an audio recording of the meeting if one was recorded)\n- [ ]  Let users assign tasks during a meeting, and have those tasks automatically show up inside participants dashboards.\n\nThis Mirror post was conceived on call and then devised and completed on such a setup. It allowed us to do all of the above in a fluent way. \n\nIf organizing and distributing tasks and bounties are pain points your DAO is currently experiencing, reach out.\n\n## No-code\nby Dysko\n\n**What does the word NoCode mean to you?**\n\nIf you had to explain it to your family, could you summarize it in one sentence? I say maybe since the NoCode space can be broken down into multiple solution verticals. Sometimes I think we try to stuff too much meaning into the NoCode term and marketing teams love to overuse the word.  To us, NoCode is enabling solutions to be implemented by non-coders that are usually implemented by development teams.  The complexity of the solution being implemented can vary drastically and some NoCode tools are targeted at developers that are looking to expedite the implementation of solutions.\n\nAs someone new to the NoCode space, you might find it difficult to determine what effort you will need to invest and become proficient in implementing solutions using NoCode tools. In this short write-up, we will discuss the web application builders vertical to give you an idea of the effort it could take to get comfortable with these tools.\n\nSo what type of NoCode tool falls into the web application builder category? It’s a tool that allows you to build the front-end user interface of your website application at the minimum but it could go way beyond that in the features you’re provided with.  This category is very busy and it keeps evolving every week as seen in our discord NoCode channels at Shiny.\n\nWe feel the best way to present this information is through a matrix that rates the website builders in a few key areas on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is the high score. This will allow you to make a decision on where to start with your next website project.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8005153e-34e9-43e4-846f-cc6a23992a5d.jpeg?height=381&width=632)\n\nOur evaluations are really based on first impressions from an end-user perspective, we assume you are not a professional website designer or builder.  We also wanted to give you some idea of how well these products support you as you start your journey with these tools.  Some of these tools will require you to have familiarity with connecting to 3rd party data sources that host your website databases.  We call them data integrations and this will require an additional investment of time on your part to learn.  \n\nThat's it for now but if you read this far thank you for your attention!\n\nWe appreciate everyone who's working hard to bring more people into these spaces and look forward to helping!\n\nIf there is anything you think you'd like to build or need help with then please let us know on build@shinyobjects.gg.\n\nShiny Object SC", "timestamp": 1627484136, "digest": "rw7-SaSszEVHtoOFW9T9d8KdxZeq1CTRkhYmDxEVKDw", "contributor": "0x54681ac94D4e3C8F58F54B576B654DC2D1950ae0"}

With new Web3 tooling, we are collectively sitting at the cusp of an entirely new era.\n\n**That said at the Shiny Object Social Club have 2 core missions:**\n\nFirstly, discover, share and help others learn about the most exciting technologies and trends that are reshaping the world we live in. \n\nThis could range from links being shared in Discord, to Live Workshops, Quests, Bounties, Events, Credentials, Learning Paths or spending time inside Shiny HQ in the Metaverse.\n\nSecondly, build and help others build useful and exciting things with these technologies empowering people along the way.\n\nAs a way to bring revenue into the Club we operate as a Service DAO with some of the services currently offered to be:\n\n- Automation\n- No-code / Low-code Apps\n- Token Gated Discord Design\n- Notion Design and Consulting (DAO Specific)\n- Treasury Creation (DAO Specific)\n- Branding and Positioning\n- Social Token Design\n- NFTs\n- Augmented Reality Strategy + Filters\n\nIf you're a Creator, Start-up, or DAO looking for help with any of the above please get in touch on build@shinyobjects.gg.\n\nMore than anything else we want everything we do to be exciting so whether that's chatting away in Discord or partnering up with a couple of members \n\n**Structure**\n\nThe Shiny Object Social Club is operating as a Social and Service DAO with a shared Treasury using a Gnosis Safe and will be launching a Social Token very shortly.  All systems and projects completed are created by members our of the community and we're always on the lookout to add more talented people with the shiniest of skillsets!\n\nCurrently, we're looking for people with skills in:\n\n- Content Curation\n- Solidity\n- Visual Design\n- 3D Design\n- Unity\n- Voxel Art\n- Game Design\n- GraphQL\n- Experience Design\n\nIf you have mad skills in any of the above and would love to help build some Shiny Objects then get in touch on Discord here.\n\n[Mirror Mag #001](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=85)\n\nNow some contributions from the community on the areas we cover.\n\n## NFTs\nby Danidr\n\n**What are they?**\n\nNFT collectibles are similar to traditional collectibles - think of childhood trading cards - except they're digital things that are scarce thanks to blockchain technology. They are sold at a specific time (where you can mint them) and they act as a gateway to being part of a community. An algorithm creates a randomized NFT by combining attributes such as background, clothes, or accessories. These traits have unequal distribution, so certain avatars are favored above others. People are always looking for the rarest and most aesthetic avatars because these made the best profile pictures (PFP).\n\nThe number of unique users who acquired the NFTs and the price floor define the early success of the collectible project. Users don’t know what NFT they will receive until they purchase it through the website. Buyers' behavior mimics that of gamblers, who place bets in the hopes of winning an avatar with unique characteristics. Collectors are often compelled to buy multiple items to boost their chances of obtaining the best-looking NFT to multiply their initial value.\n\n**How it all started?**\n\nThis whole trend began in 2017 with CryptoPunks, one of the first NFT collectibles. Larva Labs hit all the right notes with their concept's simplicity, laying the groundwork for future projects. CryptoPunks has gone a long way since its humble beginnings in a remote corner of the internet and is now the top-grossing NFT collection. The punks' strength stems in part from being the first avatar collection craze at the time, but blaming it on this merely undervalues the creativity of the concept. Collectibles have been around since kids traded sports cards, but turning them into an avatar to be used as a symbol of identity was a brilliant move. As a profile photo, the CryptoPunk identified people as part of a bigger whole that stood for something and revolted against centralized finance.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11934913-5f8c-44f4-89a0-e8ed9497ded1.png?height=630&width=1200)\n\n**How did they become mainstream?**\n\nWhen the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched in early May 2021, it built on the foundations laid down by CryptoPunks. BAYC became the first true NFT-club by combining the fundamentals of avatarisation and community-building with a layer of exclusivity. They have several perks like BAYC-radio and members-only goods. The enigmatic promise that the apes will \"unlock digital doors for you\" makes it even more exclusive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1e6beb7a-552c-4332-84d6-57940004aad3.png?height=666&width=1000)\n\nAfter the initial boom, they kept pioneering the space when they gifted a dog companion (Bored Ape Kennel Club) to every ape owner, raising the ape value and adding a new dog NFT worth 1.5 ETH (around $3,000) before it was revealed.\n\n**What are the most popular projects out there?**\n\nThere are more than 50 projects out there, and the numbers are rapidly increasing each week.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d459dd1a-8d67-480c-b1bd-99a2b1045f60.png?height=748&width=1479)\n\nApart from the two previously mentioned projects, other great contenders to become the new best NFT collectible project are (in no order):\n\n- Cool Cats\n- Gutter Cat Gang\n- Meebits\n- VeeFriends\n- The Wicked Craniums\n- DeadHeads\n- GoatZ\n- The Alien Boy\n- … and many more\n\n**What the future holds?**\n\nSince BAYC, several projects followed that path and launched their collectible project. Some of them have a lower (Gutter Cat Gang with 3,000) or a higher collection (The Wicked Craniums with 10,762), and others have added new mechanisms like forging 2 NFTs into 1 (The Forge by GoatZ).\n\nTo grasp the current scale, you must look at the sales figures. For instance, Mike Tyson just spent $10,000 on a cartoon cat avatar.\n\nCommercial Rights, which are transferred with the token, could also bring to the owners some profit from their asset. There are talks of a movie being made with DeadHeads, which could give a flow of payments to asset holders whose PFPs are used in the film.\n\nA new utility for holding these avatars is being announced each passing week. From exclusive merch to airdrops, breeding, or a place in the metaverse for the community.\n\nWe're still months or years away from true acceptance, but when more built-out 3D virtual environments like Decentraland and Sandbox are used, NFT PFP holders will be able to utilize their PFPs as a 3D avatar in the metaverse world. This will give the assets more shape and utility.\n\nDisclaimer: We are proud owners of several of these NFT collectibles, so we’re looking forward to seeing how this space evolves and what it can bring to holders.\n\n## DAOs\nby Awisemaninmotion\n\nDAOs are to 2021 what Defi was to 2020.\n\nAs is natural with any trend, you're going to get all kinds of takes on what it is and what it isn't. \nEarly adapters are going to go through experimental growing pains, and those who are paying attention to the ecosystem at large are poised to make the best strides going forward. \n\nIn other words, these are the nascent days of DAOs. To be part of one is to be part of an ongoing experiment that will (hopefully) change the way the world interacts and collaborates. \n\nHowever, like with any new and exciting idea, it can be easy to loose the forest from the trees.\n\nThe people who can speak to running a DAO are outnumbered by those who have questions about running one.\n\nSome of the most common comments I've heard so far regarding DAOs and Web3 have been:\n\nShould I start a DAO on Discord or Telegram? Is Slack still a thing? \n\n- When/how should I mint a token? \n- What web3 wallet should I use? \n- What's a test network/sub chain?\n- Are DAOs just places to talk about NFTs and Crypto?\n\nIf you've been part of a DAO for awhile, the questions get more granular:\n\n- Where is that article/tweet/meme someone posted the other day?\n- Where do I find (insert question here)?\n- When are we going to mint our token?\n- Should we be voting on everything?\n- What do we do with users who just hang around and don't want to actively participate? \n- The Discord and the Discourse are in Disarray and I'm at a loss for what to Do.\n\nDAOs have many things to work through, but one of the most pressing things I see is how to scale one from an operations point of view. Discord may be the chat platform of choice at the moment, but it wasn't made for the kind of dynamic collaboration DAOs strive to become. \nMore activity and more members come at the expense of lost links and buried knowledge. \n\nUnless you have a background in project management or worked in operations, you're likely to overlook this problem until you can't ignore it. The truth is that if you're all in on DAOs, or collaboration in the web3 world you WILL eventually have this problem. \n\nSince we are currently in a web 2.5 world, and will realistically be in this hybrid state for at least few years, what tools can you use to get ahead of this problem? \n\nTo answer this, you have to ask yourself a few questions:\n\n- [ ]  Are you a web3 maximalist that is opposed to a web2 solution?\n- [ ]  Are you willing to solve for now, and figure out how to transition to something thats on chain in the future?\n- [ ]  Are you putting community or technology first?\n\nOnce you honestly answer those questions then you can look for a solution that fits your view. Although, depending on how you answered, not all of these questions have clear solutions. \n\nTo clarify, it's not that there aren't tools to solve aspects of these problems, but each comes with their own issues, and not all play nicely with each other. \n\nRemember, you're a glorified beta tester in an experimental ecosystem. A vast majority of the roads are still under construction ⚠️ and gaps are the norm. \n\nHowever, if you currently run a DAO, one of the most important questions to ask yourself is: \nCan you afford to wait it out for a solution that doesn't currently exist?  \n\nScaling is a natural part of growth and success. There's only so long one can wait on technology, and the more you grow and take on, the less time you likely have to wait. \nI'd rather solve for now and adapt accordingly. As Shiny starts to take its next form in the web3 world, I was adamant on implementing a solution that can work alongside Discord. I didn't want to replace it, but I also didn't want to rely on it.\n\nThat meant building a solution that can currently: \n\n- [ ]  Let those who want to participate have their own space to see what they're responsible for.\n- [ ]  Let teams see a top-level view of the projects they're part of, and see progress in real-time.\n- [ ]  Let people work asynchronously\n- [ ]  Let contributors see what team meetings they're part of, as well as community meetings they would like to be a part of.\n- [ ]  Allow for meetings to be properly documented \n(This means having the ability to get a high-level overview of what was discussed, including access to an audio recording of the meeting if one was recorded)\n- [ ]  Let users assign tasks during a meeting, and have those tasks automatically show up inside participants dashboards.\n\nThis Mirror post was conceived on call and then devised and completed on such a setup. It allowed us to do all of the above in a fluent way. \n\nIf organizing and distributing tasks and bounties are pain points your DAO is currently experiencing, reach out.\n\n## No-code\nby Dysko\n\n**What does the word NoCode mean to you?**\n\nIf you had to explain it to your family, could you summarize it in one sentence? I say maybe since the NoCode space can be broken down into multiple solution verticals. Sometimes I think we try to stuff too much meaning into the NoCode term and marketing teams love to overuse the word.  To us, NoCode is enabling solutions to be implemented by non-coders that are usually implemented by development teams.  The complexity of the solution being implemented can vary drastically and some NoCode tools are targeted at developers that are looking to expedite the implementation of solutions.\n\nAs someone new to the NoCode space, you might find it difficult to determine what effort you will need to invest and become proficient in implementing solutions using NoCode tools. In this short write-up, we will discuss the web application builders vertical to give you an idea of the effort it could take to get comfortable with these tools.\n\nSo what type of NoCode tool falls into the web application builder category? It’s a tool that allows you to build the front-end user interface of your website application at the minimum but it could go way beyond that in the features you’re provided with.  This category is very busy and it keeps evolving every week as seen in our discord NoCode channels at Shiny.\n\nWe feel the best way to present this information is through a matrix that rates the website builders in a few key areas on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is the high score. This will allow you to make a decision on where to start with your next website project.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8005153e-34e9-43e4-846f-cc6a23992a5d.jpeg?height=381&width=632)\n\nOur evaluations are really based on first impressions from an end-user perspective, we assume you are not a professional website designer or builder.  We also wanted to give you some idea of how well these products support you as you start your journey with these tools.  Some of these tools will require you to have familiarity with connecting to 3rd party data sources that host your website databases.  We call them data integrations and this will require an additional investment of time on your part to learn.  \n\nThat's it for now but if you read this far thank you for your attention!\n\nWe appreciate everyone who's working hard to bring more people into these spaces and look forward to helping!\n\nIf there is anything you think you'd like to build or need help with then please let us know on build@shinyobjects.gg.\n\nShiny Object SC\n\n[Collaborator Tips #001](split://0xfa9637ced7EADaD462A4A57ccF9cB7CC3Bd67128?network=mainnet)", "timestamp": 1627492078, "digest": "rw7-SaSszEVHtoOFW9T9d8KdxZeq1CTRkhYmDxEVKDw", "contributor": "0x54681ac94D4e3C8F58F54B576B654DC2D1950ae0"}
{"id": "vlcRGtD8g3XrtbJJH6t6ilnz5U5eHMFK15kskFHOsJk", "title": "Introducing the EIP-1559 NFT Series", "body": "\nFor over two years now, EIP-1559 has been in active development. In that time, dozens of people and over five development teams have worked to specify, audit, implement, test and communicate this highly-anticipated upgrade to Ethereum’s fee market.\n\nThroughout this process, the community has been incredibly supportive. We've seen a massive grassroots movement emerge, consistently eager to contribute time, resources, and funds to get this EIP across the finish line and deployed on mainnet. With the London hard fork [scheduled for August 3-5](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/07/15/london-mainnet-announcement/), we are now in the final stages of this process.\n\n### Shaping Positive Outcomes\n\nDespite recent progress, challenges remain for the maintainers of Ethereum Public Goods. The people who choose to work on them often have a very high opportunity cost and limited methods available to capture the upside from their work.\n\nEIP-1559 is a great example of this. It was an incredibly complex change, the largest done on Ethereum mainnet to date, which will improve both the user experience and economics of the entire network. And yet, the engineers, researchers, and other contributors will not directly capture any of the ultimate benefit to the network.\n\n### Presenting the 1559 NFT Series\n\nAs an experiment in providing cultural prestige & economic upside to EIP-1559 Contributors, we are issuing a limited series of **EIP-1559 NFTs**. This series was created by [@_kitteh](https://twitter.com/_kittehdesign), who has previously created artworks centered on Public Goods recognition. All proceeds from NFT minting are trustlessly forwarded to EIP-1559 contributors using a split contract. These include:\n\n- EIP authors (15%);\n- client teams who iterated on early versions of EIP-1559 to get the spec to where it is today (49%); [0]\n- researchers who analyzed the economic and technical impacts of the change (16%);\n- folks who helped manage the effort and communicate progress to the community (12%);\n- many others who helped extensively with testing to ensure the EIP was safe to deploy to mainnet (6%).\n\nThe remaining 2% of the allocation was given to @_kitteh for their work creating the actual NFTs\n\n### Artist Statement: _kitteh\n\n> I set out to visualize the collaborative process of developers and community as they shape Ethereum. \n>\n> These two groups, represented by the two differently coloured hands, have the same golden life force flowing through them. The hands slowly rotate around \"the Node,\" which represents the collective network. A mesh of silver strings bridge between hand and Node, visualizing the Ethereum change process.\n> \n> Since EIP-1559 is such a fundamental change to the core workings of Ethereum, I placed the numbers 1-5-5-9 exactly there - directly within the delicate etched metal Node. \n>\n> For the 1559 Patron NFT, I further emphasized the different dimensions in which the developers and community usually reside. Yet, the most amazing things are built by crossing the frame's threshold to the other realm, allowing you to see the situations at hand from another perspective. The semi-opaque liquid veil represents how difficult it can sometimes be for both sides to see the other's perspective. \n>\n> In the perpetually online world of blockchains, stewarding infrastructure is a fluid, never-ending process. A dance of creator and user. \n>\n> So we continue on, infinitely dancing across dimensions as we build a better Ethereum.\n___\n\nIf you would like to show support to the 1559 contributors even though the Supporter NFT is sold out, any ETH sent to this split contract will be automatically sent to them. **Note: the contract only supports ETH, tokens sent to it will be lost.**\n\n[EIP-1559 Contributor Set](split://0x2510C039cc3b061D79e564b38836dA87e31b342f?network=mainnet)\n\nFor those who want to go above and beyond in signaling their support, we are auctioning a premium one-of-one: the **1559 Patron Edition**. This piece will be on auction for 155.9 hours from the moment the reserve price of 15.59 ETH is met.\n\n[Token #1139343](auction://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5?network=mainnet&tokenId=1139343&auctionId=0xb8ba887bce2dfacbedaf3f123c89560d9689a69f9f72d09e2b24fe09e3ce9505&features=overview,bidders)\n\nThe **1559 Supporter NFT** has sold out. These mints will forever act as a show of support for the people who delivered EIP-1559.\n\n[1559 Supporter](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=40)\n\nPlease note that minting these NFTs or participating in the auction should not be construed as an investment of any kind.\n\n---\n\nWe hope that the 1559 NFT Series, if successful, will demonstrate to present and future contributors to Ethereum Public Goods that alternative funding models, where part of the value created can be captured, are possible. \n\nFinally, we want to thank everyone who has supported this effort over the past few years. It literally took a village, and your enthusiasm about EIP-1559 has been a constant source of motivation for everyone involved.\n\nNow, let’s get this onto mainnet 🔥\n\n---\n\nIf you're interested in other projects like this, check out the [**Beacon Book**](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA): a multimedia project (digital text, mintable NFTs, + physical book) featuring the perspectives of 46 Eth2 contributors that worked on the Beacon Chain launch.\n\n---\n\n*[0] Note: Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation go-ethereum team have both declined to receive proceeds from this project.

{"id": "p2K75W6GKs3LYbHMc3f6nWQLFMSsAEcWZG7nOdCW550", "title": "Introducing The Shiny Object Social Club", "body": "Not so long ago, if you wanted to start a business the process looked like this: You have an idea, write a business plan, try to get funding, and then pray people will pay for it. All done alone.\n\nToday, in the age of the internet, businesses start with an idea shared with friends on a Discord server, then raising money through NFT Sales, Crowdfunding through Mirror, or by minting a Social Token. Organizations that used to be started alone now are started together. Businesses that took years to be profitable are making money before they launch.\n \nIndividuals and collectives can form, raise capital, and build things at a speed that we haven't seen before in traditional markets thanks to the rise of the Creator Economy, Crypto, Web3, Automation, and No-code. These internet native, fully distributed organizations are what the internet was designed for. With new Web3 tooling, we are collectively sitting at the cusp of an entirely new era.\n\n**That said at the Shiny Object Social Club have 2 core missions:**\n\nFirstly, discover, share and help others learn about the most exciting technologies and trends that are reshaping the world we live in. \n\nThis could range from links being shared in Discord, to Live Workshops, Quests, Bounties, Events, Credentials, Learning Paths or spending time inside Shiny HQ in the Metaverse.\n\nSecondly, build and help others build useful and exciting things with these technologies empowering people along the way.\n\nAs a way to bring revenue into the Club we operate as a Service DAO with some of the services currently offered to be:\n\n- Automation\n- No-code / Low-code Apps\n- Token Gated Discord Design\n- Notion Design and Consulting (DAO Specific)\n- Treasury Creation (DAO Specific)\n- Branding and Positioning\n- Social Token Design\n- NFTs\n- Augmented Reality Strategy + Filters\n\nIf you're a Creator, Start-up, or DAO looking for help with any of the above please get in touch on build@shinyobjects.gg.\n\nMore than anything else we want everything we do to be exciting so whether that's chatting away in Discord or partnering up with a couple of members \n\n**Structure**\n\nThe Shiny Object Social Club is operating as a Social and Service DAO with a shared Treasury using a Gnosis Safe and will be launching a Social Token very shortly.  All systems and projects completed are created by members our of the community and we're always on the lookout to add more talented people with the shiniest of skillsets!\n\nCurrently, we're looking for people with skills in:\n\n- Content Curation\n- Solidity\n- Visual Design\n- 3D Design\n- Unity\n- Voxel Art\n- Game Design\n- GraphQL\n- Experience Design\n\nIf you have mad skills in any of the above and would love to help build some Shiny Objects then get in touch.\n\n[Mirror Mag #001](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=85)\n\n*Purchasing the Mirror Mag grants you access to Club Discord for as long as you hold it. Additionally it grants access to Airdrops, Giveaways, Auctions, The ShinyDAO and Special Events.\n*\nNow some contributions from the community on the areas we cover.\n\n## NFTs\nby Danidr\n\n**What are they?**\n\nNFT collectibles are similar to traditional collectibles - think of childhood trading cards - except they're digital things that are scarce thanks to blockchain technology. They are sold at a specific time (where you can mint them) and they act as a gateway to being part of a community. An algorithm creates a randomized NFT by combining attributes such as background, clothes, or accessories. These traits have unequal distribution, so certain avatars are favored above others. People are always looking for the rarest and most aesthetic avatars because these made the best profile pictures (PFP).\n\nThe number of unique users who acquired the NFTs and the price floor define the early success of the collectible project. Users don’t know what NFT they will receive until they purchase it through the website. Buyers' behavior mimics that of gamblers, who place bets in the hopes of winning an avatar with unique characteristics. Collectors are often compelled to buy multiple items to boost their chances of obtaining the best-looking NFT to multiply their initial value.\n\n**How it all started?**\n\nThis whole trend began in 2017 with CryptoPunks, one of the first NFT collectibles. Larva Labs hit all the right notes with their concept's simplicity, laying the groundwork for future projects. CryptoPunks has gone a long way since its humble beginnings in a remote corner of the internet and is now the top-grossing NFT collection. The punks' strength stems in part from being the first avatar collection craze at the time, but blaming it on this merely undervalues the creativity of the concept. Collectibles have been around since kids traded sports cards, but turning them into an avatar to be used as a symbol of identity was a brilliant move. As a profile photo, the CryptoPunk identified people as part of a bigger whole that stood for something and revolted against centralized finance.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11934913-5f8c-44f4-89a0-e8ed9497ded1.png?height=630&width=1200)\n\n**How did they become mainstream?**\n\nWhen the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched in early May 2021, it built on the foundations laid down by CryptoPunks. BAYC became the first true NFT-club by combining the fundamentals of avatarisation and community-building with a layer of exclusivity. They have several perks like BAYC-radio and members-only goods. The enigmatic promise that the apes will \"unlock digital doors for you\" makes it even more exclusive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1e6beb7a-552c-4332-84d6-57940004aad3.png?height=666&width=1000)\n\nAfter the initial boom, they kept pioneering the space when they gifted a dog companion (Bored Ape Kennel Club) to every ape owner, raising the ape value and adding a new dog NFT worth 1.5 ETH (around $3,000) before it was revealed.\n\n**What are the most popular projects out there?**\n\nThere are more than 50 projects out there, and the numbers are rapidly increasing each week.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d459dd1a-8d67-480c-b1bd-99a2b1045f60.png?height=748&width=1479)\n\nApart from the two previously mentioned projects, other great contenders to become the new best NFT collectible project are (in no order):\n\n- Cool Cats\n- Gutter Cat Gang\n- Meebits\n- VeeFriends\n- The Wicked Craniums\n- DeadHeads\n- GoatZ\n- The Alien Boy\n- … and many more\n\n**What the future holds?**\n\nSince BAYC, several projects followed that path and launched their collectible project. Some of them have a lower (Gutter Cat Gang with 3,000) or a higher collection (The Wicked Craniums with 10,762), and others have added new mechanisms like forging 2 NFTs into 1 (The Forge by GoatZ).\n\nTo grasp the current scale, you must look at the sales figures. For instance, Mike Tyson just spent $10,000 on a cartoon cat avatar.\n\nCommercial Rights, which are transferred with the token, could also bring to the owners some profit from their asset. There are talks of a movie being made with DeadHeads, which could give a flow of payments to asset holders whose PFPs are used in the film.\n\nA new utility for holding these avatars is being announced each passing week. From exclusive merch to airdrops, breeding, or a place in the metaverse for the community.\n\nWe're still months or years away from true acceptance, but when more built-out 3D virtual environments like Decentraland and Sandbox are used, NFT PFP holders will be able to utilize their PFPs as a 3D avatar in the metaverse world. This will give the assets more shape and utility.\n\nDisclaimer: We are proud owners of several of these NFT collectibles, so we’re looking forward to seeing how this space evolves and what it can bring to holders.\n\n## DAOs\nby Awisemaninmotion\n\nDAOs are to 2021 what Defi was to 2020.\n\nAs is natural with any trend, you're going to get all kinds of takes on what it is and what it isn't. \nEarly adapters are going to go through experimental growing pains, and those who are paying attention to the ecosystem at large are poised to make the best strides going forward. \n\nIn other words, these are the nascent days of DAOs. To be part of one is to be part of an ongoing experiment that will (hopefully) change the way the world interacts and collaborates. \n\nHowever, like with any new and exciting idea, it can be easy to loose the forest from the trees.\n\nThe people who can speak to running a DAO are outnumbered by those who have questions about running one.\n\nSome of the most common comments I've heard so far regarding DAOs and Web3 have been:\n\nShould I start a DAO on Discord or Telegram? Is Slack still a thing? \n\n- When/how should I mint a token? \n- What web3 wallet should I use? \n- What's a test network/sub chain?\n- Are DAOs just places to talk about NFTs and Crypto?\n\nIf you've been part of a DAO for awhile, the questions get more granular:\n\n- Where is that article/tweet/meme someone posted the other day?\n- Where do I find (insert question here)?\n- When are we going to mint our token?\n- Should we be voting on everything?\n- What do we do with users who just hang around and don't want to actively participate? \n- The Discord and the Discourse are in Disarray and I'm at a loss for what to Do.\n\nDAOs have many things to work through, but one of the most pressing things I see is how to scale one from an operations point of view. Discord may be the chat platform of choice at the moment, but it wasn't made for the kind of dynamic collaboration DAOs strive to become. \nMore activity and more members come at the expense of lost links and buried knowledge. \n\nUnless you have a background in project management or worked in operations, you're likely to overlook this problem until you can't ignore it. The truth is that if you're all in on DAOs, or collaboration in the web3 world you WILL eventually have this problem. \n\nSince we are currently in a web 2.5 world, and will realistically be in this hybrid state for at least few years, what tools can you use to get ahead of this problem? \n\nTo answer this, you have to ask yourself a few questions:\n\n- [ ]  Are you a web3 maximalist that is opposed to a web2 solution?\n- [ ]  Are you willing to solve for now, and figure out how to transition to something thats on chain in the future?\n- [ ]  Are you putting community or technology first?\n\nOnce you honestly answer those questions then you can look for a solution that fits your view. Although, depending on how you answered, not all of these questions have clear solutions. \n\nTo clarify, it's not that there aren't tools to solve aspects of these problems, but each comes with their own issues, and not all play nicely with each other. \n\nRemember, you're a glorified beta tester in an experimental ecosystem. A vast majority of the roads are still under construction ⚠️ and gaps are the norm. \n\nHowever, if you currently run a DAO, one of the most important questions to ask yourself is: \nCan you afford to wait it out for a solution that doesn't currently exist?  \n\nScaling is a natural part of growth and success. There's only so long one can wait on technology, and the more you grow and take on, the less time you likely have to wait. \nI'd rather solve for now and adapt accordingly. As Shiny starts to take its next form in the web3 world, I was adamant on implementing a solution that can work alongside Discord. I didn't want to replace it, but I also didn't want to rely on it.\n\nThat meant building a solution that can currently: \n\n- [ ]  Let those who want to participate have their own space to see what they're responsible for.\n- [ ]  Let teams see a top-level view of the projects they're part of, and see progress in real-time.\n- [ ]  Let people work asynchronously\n- [ ]  Let contributors see what team meetings they're part of, as well as community meetings they would like to be a part of.\n- [ ]  Allow for meetings to be properly documented \n(This means having the ability to get a high-level overview of what was discussed, including access to an audio recording of the meeting if one was recorded)\n- [ ]  Let users assign tasks during a meeting, and have those tasks automatically show up inside participants dashboards.\n\nThis Mirror post was conceived on call and then devised and completed on such a setup. It allowed us to do all of the above in a fluent way. \n\nIf organizing and distributing tasks and bounties are pain points your DAO is currently experiencing, reach out.\n\n## No-code\nby Dysko\n\n**What does the word NoCode mean to you?**\n\nIf you had to explain it to your family, could you summarize it in one sentence? I say maybe since the NoCode space can be broken down into multiple solution verticals. Sometimes I think we try to stuff too much meaning into the NoCode term and marketing teams love to overuse the word.  To us, NoCode is enabling solutions to be implemented by non-coders that are usually implemented by development teams.  The complexity of the solution being implemented can vary drastically and some NoCode tools are targeted at developers that are looking to expedite the implementation of solutions.\n\nAs someone new to the NoCode space, you might find it difficult to determine what effort you will need to invest and become proficient in implementing solutions using NoCode tools. In this short write-up, we will discuss the web application builders vertical to give you an idea of the effort it could take to get comfortable with these tools.\n\nSo what type of NoCode tool falls into the web application builder category? It’s a tool that allows you to build the front-end user interface of your website application at the minimum but it could go way beyond that in the features you’re provided with.  This category is very busy and it keeps evolving every week as seen in our discord NoCode channels at Shiny.\n\nWe feel the best way to present this information is through a matrix that rates the website builders in a few key areas on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is the high score. This will allow you to make a decision on where to start with your next website project.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8005153e-34e9-43e4-846f-cc6a23992a5d.jpeg?height=381&width=632)\n\nOur evaluations are really based on first impressions from an end-user perspective, we assume you are not a professional website designer or builder.  We also wanted to give you some idea of how well these products support you as you start your journey with these tools.  Some of these tools will require you to have familiarity with connecting to 3rd party data sources that host your website databases.  We call them data integrations and this will require an additional investment of time on your part to learn.  \n\nThat's it for now but if you read this far thank you for your attention!\n\nWe appreciate everyone who's working hard to bring more people into these spaces and look forward to helping!\n\nIf there is anything you think you'd like to build or need help with then please let us know on build@shinyobjects.gg.\n\nShiny Object SC\n\n[Collaborator Tips #001](split://0xfa9637ced7EADaD462A4A57ccF9cB7CC3Bd67128?network=mainnet)", "timestamp": 1627506210, "digest": "rw7-SaSszEVHtoOFW9T9d8KdxZeq1CTRkhYmDxEVKDw", "contributor": "0x54681ac94D4e3C8F58F54B576B654DC2D1950ae0"}

It is an attempt at locating positive alternatives to the commonplace modes of operation in the music industry. Alternatives that are **sustainable and transparent** and work for both the creators and their audience.\n\n### How does it work?\n\nA token is passed from creator to creator allowing the holder to add a work to the chain whereby the token's path through the network of contributors function as the curation mechanism.\n\nEach chain is funded by the sale of **100 collector edition tokens** that grant access to downloads, special discord channels and further perks down the line.\n\n### How do I get involved?\n\nFirst ting to do is to pick up one of the collector tokens listed on OpenSea for a mere 0.01 ETH. Doing so directly supports the contributing artists and their work.\n[https://opensea.io/assets/0xderive](https://opensea.io/assets/0xderive)\n\nSecondly there's the Discord. It's open for everyone to join and we encourage you to do s if you're just remotely interested in learning more about Derive and where we're going with this.\n[https://discord.gg/q4FJBkXF8Y](https://discord.gg/q4FJBkXF8Y)\n\n### How far is the project?\n\nThe first two of four genesis chains have been launched and the first music has already been added. We've sold the first collector tokens and funds have been transferred to the creators in accordance with the funding model. It dictates a **direct 10% share** for each contributing artist or group. The collector tokens are being released as the chain progresses and new contributors are onboarded.\n\n### What's the plan?\n\nBecause much of the process at the moment is manual the four genesis chains allow us to tweak and refine the process and models as we set them in motion. The idea is to figure out what parts work and improve and automate things as Derive progresses. That means developing new smarts contracts, improve and add more features to the UI and work on including the community in more and more processes. We want to develop the project in a direction that best suits the two main groups of the project: contributors and collectors aka artist and audience.\n\nConcerning the latter we are actively working to form a **DAO** around Derive. A community platform owned, operated and developed by the people contributing to it is the end goal for this project.\n\nThanks for reading and stay tuned for more!\n\n💿⛓️\n\n[derive.works](https://derive.works)", "timestamp": 1627509125, "digest": "VohVXHjolw1NuuzpwZmfRTuJO9qdRrPAQH0w8IQc1FU", "contributor": "0x59abbee2F246946Dba01fb037Be603CC0B2B3909"}

While the content and framing has evolved over the past 6 months, the core vision has remained the same: to craft a crypto-native artifact that captures the humanity of the people building the future of Ethereum.\n\nIt contains the hopes, fears, and anticipations of the Eth2 researchers and client implementers directly responsible for bringing the Beacon Chain to life on December 1, 2020. The future of the Beacon Chain is the future of Ethereum, and we’re proud to tell part of its story this far.\n\nWe prompted contributors with a few questions - you'll find them in order in each response, some but not all answered.\n\n- Name / handle\n- Affiliated orgs\n- Primary role\n- Eth2 rough start date\n- General summary of experiences\n- Code or documentation they are particularly proud of\n- Most memorable or painful-to-discover Eth2 bug\n- Person you've come to admire or want to give a shoutout to\n\nKeep in mind that these responses were gathered both before and after the Beacon Chain launch, so references to launch expectations will vary. Profiles are ordered alphabetically by first name.\n\nFinally, while we made the utmost effort to include as many people as possible, it’s inevitable that we missed or were unable to feature some contributors. Eth2 wouldn’t be what it is without the input of hundreds of community testers and code contributors - thank you.\n\n---\n\n### Ethereum = Eth1 + Eth2\n\n- Ben Edgington\n- Originally [published on eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/wnie2_210328), 28th March, 2021\n\nLet's start with a quick history of what's become known as Eth2, and where it's headed in the future.\n\nRecently, Danny Ryan has announced his [intent to deprecate](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/) the use of the terms eth1 and eth2. As the creator and curator of “What’s New in Eth2,” this is a bit of a blow!\n\nBut, on the whole, I agree that these terms are beginning to outlive their usefulness, and are in danger of becoming quite misleading. It’s not really about fiddling with names; it’s about capturing fundamental changes in direction, and communicating them clearly. Changes in the roadmap are confusing for the community. Clarity in naming aids clarity of understanding.\n\nHere's a brief history of naming things in Ethereum’s roadmap.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the first use of the name “Ethereum 2” was by Vitalik in Hacker News, way back in [April 2014](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7554923). He positioned Ethereum 2 as being a future step-change in the capability of Ethereum through the use of “fundamental cryptographic upgrades.”\n\nEthereum 2 then drops out of view, and the main narrative becomes the familiar Frontier → Homestead → Metropolis → Serenity progression, first described in [March 2015](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). In this scheme, Serenity is the network upgrade to Proof of Stake; Serenity isn’t Ethereum 2 per se. Interestingly, sharding/scaling doesn’t have a clear place in that roadmap, although it was certainly discussed [around that time](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/05/blockchain-scalability-chain-fibers-redux/).\n\nProgress largely followed this plan for some years, with Homestead going live in March 2016, and Metropolis (in name at least) in a pair of upgrades in October 2017 and February 2019.\n\nSerenity was to have been delivered via a process of upgrading the existing Ethereum chain to bootstrap Proof of Stake. That upgrade was specified in [EIP-1011](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1011.md) and there was even a [testnet](https://hackmd.io/@aTTDQ4GiRVyyce6trnsfpg/Hk6UiFU7z?type=view) that went live on December 31st, 2017.\n\nHowever, the road to Serenity was found to be a dead-end, not least because of the vast amount of Ether that stakers would require - 1500 was the number back then.\n\nSo, in mid 2018, we tore up that roadmap and started afresh with Ethereum 2.0. Rather, we reverted to Vitalik’s original idea from 2014 of an Ethereum 2 that was to be a significant cryptographic step-change to the protocol. Calling this Eth 2.0 made sense: we were planning to change pretty much everything about the platform. Ethereum 1 would eventually be brought in as a kind of legacy system. This Ethereum 2.0 roadmap came with neat consecutive phases: Phase 0 for Proof of Stake; Phase 1 for data shards; Phase 2 for executable shards; and, finally, bring Eth1 over to Eth2 after all that.\n\nWe’ve now delivered Phase 0, but the rest of the plan has evolved. As per the latest Eth2 pages [on the ethereum.org website](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/), “Eth2 [now] refers to a *set of interconnected upgrades* that will make Ethereum more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable” (emphasis mine). This looks much more like the old Serenity plan! We’re upgrading the Ethereum chain in-place rather than doing the old rip-and-replace.\n\nSo, you see, the roadmap narrative has vacillated over the years between effectively doing a replacement of Ethereum 1, referred to at various times as Eth2, and doing in-place upgrades to Eth1. Today, we’re more or less back in upgrade territory.\n\nIn view of all this, applying the Ethereum 2.0 moniker to the entire project is now seen as confusing: to some it implies a different chain to today’s Ethereum; to others, even [a different coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/md75k2/will_be_eth_20_a_new_coin_or_will_be_the_same_eth/). It suggests incompatibilities and problems ahead.\n\nThe [latest naming trend](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/), then, is to limit Eth2 to refer only to the consensus layer upgrade of Ethereum to Proof of Stake, and to refer to all of today’s Ethereum (fka Eth1) as the execution layer.\n\nIt's good to see everything moving under a consistent terminology and a shared roadmap. I'm looking forward to a productive rest of 2021 and beyond!\n\n[Continuations [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=26)\n\n### Aditya Asgaonkar\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- 2019 \n\nEth2 promises to deliver a decentralized, scalable, and secure blockchain platform on which stateful applications can live. These three qualities will be the driving force towards the mass adoption of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn the quest to satisfy the design requirements, we've also seen some amazing research and engineering progress. We have pushed the frontier of computer science in areas such as Byzantine consensus, signature aggregation, and VDFs. With the launch of Phase 0, we created the largest BFT consensus network in existence, which is an awesome feat in itself!\n\nMy favorite bit of work was the [\"Weak Subjectivity Guide\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/weak-subjectivity.md) - a document that outlines the weak subjectivity safety features of the Eth2.0 network. The goal is to prevent long range attacks that appear specifically in PoS consensus.\n\nAs for favorite bug, there was a consensus (fork-choice) issue discovered right before the Beacon Chain launch. The first priority was to assess the threat level of the attack -- it was critical and could have lead to a large-scale failure, but was extremely difficult to execute. Fixing this attack vector required a comprehensive review of the fork-choice component, and we had already identified a couple of solutions. At the end, there was agreement among the spec team that the attack didn't pose a critical threat because of its difficult execution, and we decided to publish a fix after further review was completed.\n\n### Adrian Manning\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Co-Lead Developer\n- Aug 2018 \n\nThe project has always been ambitious. The early designs were well thought out, but had shortcomings which became apparent when realising them through implementation. The collaboration between researchers and developers constantly iterated on these design specs for years, finally achieving a workable version of the original concept. The process was longer than expected, but it's been amazing to see the coordination and what has been achieved by a globally distributed group of implementers and researchers.\n\nOf all the work put into the Lighthouse client, I've changed and modified various architectures and designs and I'll likely continue to do so. I'm therefore not particularly fond of any individual piece relative to another. But I'm very proud of the end result. The resulting Lighthouse code-base that came together from everyone's hard work is what I'm most proud of.\n\nAs for person to give a shoutout to, I'm sure everyone has a similar answer, but for me it's Danny and Proto. Danny for the amazing organisational role and interfacing with all the client teams (especially on contentious topics) has sped up the development immensely. Proto (Diederick) for his relentless troubleshooting, bug-finding and research endeavours. He has been invaluable in interop testing, optimisation improvements and all round improving the general state of all clients and the eth2 ecosystem in general.\n\nAlso - there's an Australian saying, which I think applies to all eth2 researchers and developers: We're not here to f$!k spiders!\n\n### Adrian Sutton\n\n- Teku  \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nEth2 is this big idea that started as a seed right back when Ethereum began and then went on this crazy, messy, long journey as the details were thrashed out through open research and public collaboration. All that messiness and the length of the journey is a result of this unique, highly collaborative and distributed approach to designing it. Multiple times, concepts that had been thought settled were thrown out because a better idea came along. While that has been frustrating for on-lookers, it has led to and continues to lead to huge improvements in the resulting technology.\n\nThe interop lock-in in Canada was a major turning point in the progress of Phase 0. It forced the Beacon Chain out of that research mode. Suddenly, client development was less about translating the Python spec to another language and more about engineering all the other components that make a client actually usable. Client teams finally had a stable platform to work from and make clients interoperable. There was an explosion of tools to aid developers in debugging and testing across clients. The Beacon Chain had stopped being a research project and started being an engineering one. The road to Mainnet started to become clear.\n\nNow with the deposit contract launched and deposits flowing into it, the pressure to deliver the rest of Eth2 really amps up. Community pressure to unlock those funds again will become overwhelming and despite all the warnings that it won't be quick, people will be disappointed at how long it takes. But those locked funds will also be the equivalent of the interop lock-in, forcing work out of the research phase and into production. All that time spent researching led people to wonder if Eth2 will ever ship, but with the beacon chain launch and all that money locked in, Eth2 has almost unstoppable momentum.\n\nThe future of Ethereum is very bright.\n\nI'm quite proud of my blog post explaining the weak subjectivity period: [\"Exploring Ethereum 2: Weak Subjectivity Period.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2019/11/27/exploring-ethereum-2-weak-subjectivity-period/) It was just me trying to get my head around a concept everyone seemed to be very hand-wavy about and put off solving to the future, yet it's become one of the standard reference points to explain the concept.\n\nI'm proud to have worked with Meredith Baxter and Cem Ozer. They have both been doing all the heavy lifting for Teku, almost entirely behind the scenes. They aren't flashy Twitter personalities, they just put their heads down and do the work.\n\nA few anecdotes to conclude: \n\n1. Family commitments mean I don't travel much, so when the first 7-client interop happened and a photo was posted of people crowded around the computer watching it, everyone in the photo was quickly identified but no one had any clue who I was. For a little while I was just \"that random guy in all the eth2 photos\".\n2. Before Ethereum, Ben Edgington only ever wore button-up, collared shirts. He's now exclusively dressed in Ethereum related T-shirts and has even picked up a penchant for Ethereum hoodies.\n\n[Caravans [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=27)\n\n### Afri Schoedon\n\n- Byzantine Fault / ESP Grantee  \n- Testnet Engineer\n- June 2018 \n\nI was working at Parity Technologies in 2018 which managed to implement EIP 1011, the \"Hybrid Casper FFG\" in the Parity Ethereum client. It was a hybrid proof-of-stake approach to the consensus engine and literally my first memory of seeing anything Eth2 related actually being implemented and run. There was Casper testnet up and running with Harmony, Pythereum, and Parity. It was exciting to see the idea of \"Serenity\" starting to materialize. \n\nHowever, it was the same year (only a few weeks later) that the Berlin Eth2 workshop decided to completely discard the hybrid Casper ideas in favor of the beacon chain. Admittedly, it was a massive undertaking. After all the ideation and the first implementations and testnets, we basically started from scratch. \n\nPrysmatic Labs first caught my attention when they launched their first public beacon chain testnets at the end of 2019. I was wondering why we had seven Eth2 clients but none of them was able to synchronize to the other clients' testnets. I was hooked and reached out to the Ethereum Foundation and the Goerli Initiative about contributing to multi-client testnets. And that's what I did in 2020, testnet after testnet up to the mainnet launch.\n\nWhen we launched the Goerli testnet in January 2019, it was not only an important milestone for Eth1 but it was also the perfect chance for Eth2 client teams to use this for their Eth1 integration leading up to the beacon chain genesis. Prysmatic Labs seized this moment and deployed all their Eth2 testnets to date to the Goerli testnet. Coindesk wrote a feature story with the headline [\"A New Test Network Just Activated and Ethereum 2.0 Will Be Using It.\"](https://www.coindesk.com/testnet-gorli-ethereum-serenity)\n\nAll my work on Eth2 concluded with the Eth2 mainnet launch in December 2020. The eight multi-client testnets are well documented on Github and received quite some [media attention](https://github.com/goerli/medalla).\n\nAs for bugs or missing features, that would be the lack of [BLS signature verifications](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/2081) in the deposit contract.\n\nShoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang!\n\n### Alex Stokes\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- 2018 \n\nWhat a ride it has been! The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020 represents the culmination of years of research and development across countless contributors from every corner of the globe, reaching as far back as the Ethereum genesis block.\n\nIt has been exhilarating to watch this effort go from a collection of wild ideas (e.g. informal talks on Casper from Devcon 3) to today’s production-scale mainnet. Having been involved before the “casper + sharding” merge and the formation of the eth2 umbrella, I have seen time and again how a dedicated group of individuals adapts and responds to changes both inside and outside the community. It is this resilience that I find most exciting, and that gives me confidence in a very bright future for Ethereum.\n\nWe are ready to weather whatever challenges may come our way and I cannot wait as we deploy a scalable Ethereum in 2021 and beyond.\n\nI'll highlight [some of the early Casper work](https://github.com/ethereum/casper/pull/143) that got me involved directly with eth2 in mid-2018. Part of the original proof-of-stake design involved a validator registry contract hosted on the eth1 chain. As part of the deposit process, validators provided an arbitrary smart contract for signature verification. While an interesting application of account abstraction, this smart contract needed to be deterministic so that signatures could be independently verified on-chain. In order to ensure the smart contract had the desired properties, it was processed by another smart contract, the \"purity checker\" (in the sense of a pure computation), during the initial registration.\n\nAn early version of the purity checker was written in a now deprecated smart contract language called Serpent LLL. I created a Gitcoin bounty to port the Serpent LLL to a language stack used in the ethereum/casper project, Vyper LLL.\n\nMost painful bug would definitely have to be debugging cross-client interactions during the eth2 interop event in 2019. Fun times, good people and challenging bugs!\n\nShoutout to protolambda!\n\n### Alex Vlasov\n\n- TX/RX  \n- Applied Researcher\n- July 2019 \n\nMy predominant impression is that Eth2 poses problems, which are perhaps the most challenging from a software engineering point of view, at the moment. This is exciting from a researcher's perspective, but sometimes frustrating from a software engineer's one. We must adapt, in order to survive in the endeavor.\n\nOne aspect is that we, as software engineers, are used to optimizing for the common case, largely overlooking rare ones. But the latter ones are exactly what an attacker will thoroughly scrutinize! The habit is difficult to break, especially considering that it demands huge amounts of time to analyze and optimize the worst case behavior.\n\nI'm confident that we have to use Formal Methods, as testing is not able to explore the search space exhaustively (except for rare cases, when the space is relatively small).\n\nAnother important aspect is that modern DeFi is demanding on resources. And that is not only data throughput, but EVM/CPU throughput too. ZKP/zkRollups is an obvious example. However, asset pricing can be computation hungry too. And, as we can see now, DeFi asset pricing is an important topic. Unfortunately, EWASM turned to be a much harder idea to implement than initially expected. And it's basically for the same reason - WASM JIT compilers are optimized for a common case, while worst case scenarios can be exploited by an attacker. So, I treat it as another manifestation of the problem discussed above.\n\nWhile the problems are difficult, I am very excited to investigate and implement potential solutions.\n\nOne idea that I'm working on is a (semi-)automated transpilation of Eth2 beacon chain Python specs to Kotlin. The [resulting Kotlin code](https://github.com/ericsson49/research/blob/master/beacon_kotlin_generated/src/phase1/spec.kt) is beautiful, IMHO. Kotlin turned to be a pretty good match for (a statically-typed subset of) Python.\t\n\nAs for a specific bug, it's not yet made public (as it can turn to be a serious vulnerability). But the basic idea is that swapping two lines leaves a function 100% functionally correct, while an attacker can send the code into a practically endless loop.\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan!\n\n[Discovery [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=28)\n\n### Ben Edgington\n\n- Teku  \n- Chronicler of Eth2 and Teku PM\n- January 2018 \n\nI could write a book on this, and perhaps one day I will. But the tl;dr is that getting to where we are has been the most incredible journey of my career.\n\nThe technology is thrilling, and the distributed development model no less so. But the highlight above all is getting to work every day with such a brilliant, thoughtful, capable, and generous group of people. If it's true that technology reflects the people who build it, then Eth2 is going to be a superb foundation for all the systems of the world.\n\nAs for the future, the beacon chain was designed, developed and delivered astonishingly quickly, having been conceived only in June 2018. Things get harder from now on: the beacon chain already carries so much value, and we need to begin taking into account the existing value on the Eth1 chain as we work on a merge. I think our main challenges ahead may not be technical, but more governance related. But I am confident that, with the ethos we've established and momentum we have as a community, we can bring this thing to a successful conclusion.\t\n\nI've enjoyed writing up regular digests of the latest developments in the spec since October 2018 at [eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/), really with an audience of just the other Eth2 devs in mind. Over time it's grown and evolved, and now gets between three thousand and ten thousand views per edition. This amazes me.\n\nI am still happy with my one and only ethresear.ch post, co-written with Nicolas Liochon: [\"Exploring the Proposer Collator split.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/exploring-the-proposer-collator-split/1632) While more of a design bug than a code bug, some credited it with finally finishing off the old sharding design, and precipitating the move to the beacon chain. I think things may have already been heading in that direction at the time.\n\nAs for individual shoutouts, what an incredible group of people - you are all amazing!\n\n### Carl Beekhuizen\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nAlthough eth2 has taken longer to get off the ground than I think any of us imagined, the result is extremely robust, secure, and decentralised.\n\nIt is incredibly exciting to see how eth2 is evolving and maturing into the backbone of the decentralised future we all dream about.\n\nI'm most proud of the key-derivation EIPs (2333, 2334, 2335). Specifically, the quantum-secure backup keys built into EIP 2333. In the event of a quantum apocalypse, validators should be able to recover using these Lamport signatures.\n\nI'm also really proud of the Launchpad. 🦏 So many validators managed to deposit safely.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang for the attention to detail and diligence she brings to everything she works on.\n\n### Cayman Nava\n\n- Chainsafe Systems  \n- Client Implementer\n- December 2018 \n\nThe past two years have been a blast. Looking back on the progress we've collectively made and the state of the ecosystem, I feel like we're on the cusp of something great. And I'm honored to be a part of it. I anticipate that Ethereum will be of critical importance for the future, as a rock-solid foundation that empowers ultimately successful experiments which aim to resolve many of the hardest problems facing society today.\n\nI'm proud of the [typescript implementation](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ssz) of SSZ (a copy of Proto's remerkleable). It fulfills the spec, but in an ergonomic way. You can operate on an ssz merkle tree as if it is a 'normal' javascript object. This required some exotic code, but the result is seamless [ssz <-> javascript interoperability](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/lodestar-medalla-update-59865a5cce1a).\n\nHuge thanks to Proto and his work! Many of the tools / algorithms / methods he's published are present in Lodestar: remerkleable, eth2-fastspec, protoarray fork choice, etc. the list goes on.\n\n### Celeste Seberras\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Technical Content Strategist\n- May 2018 \n\nIt has been a humbling experience to have witnessed the growth of Prysmatic from a small seedling with a dream to the robust and diverse community it harbours today; equally so for the broader Eth2 ecosystem. Hard work over the past two years has proven that, through all the speculative noise and interindustry drama, the things that truly speak are code and passion.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Prysm client usage manual.\n\nShout out to all the boys here at Prysmatic Labs. You are all fantastic to work with, here's to the future!\n\nShoot for the stars. Even if you miss, holy fuck you're in space!\n\n### Cem Ozer\n\n- Teku  \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2019 \n\nI’m blown away that the Eth2.0 beacon chain is now alive and well. For me it was such a complex undertaking, and deep down I was scared it would never launch or be successful.\t\n\nWhen I first joined Teku (called Artemis back then) we were almost only working on the state transition. The spec changed pretty rapidly at the time, and as a result we had to update our state transition many times. I found myself leading these changes at Artemis, and it would almost always be a week long intense marathon where we’d change thousands of lines of code as a team, and I’d try to make sure we did not break anything.\n\nLuckily this was in the prototyping phase, this is not how it’s done today in the production phase :). I’m also pretty proud of having worked on the Eth1 Deposit Management of Teku.\n\nMy best bug discovery is luckily documented by my team lead Adrian Sutton on his blog: [\"The Curious Case of the Invisible Fork.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2020/07/06/exploring-ethereum-2-the-curious-case-of-the-invisible-fork/)\n\nShoutout to Johnny Rhea, Adrian Sutton, and Protolambda. These three people are all geniuses in their own unique ways. It was an honor and an incredible experience working with them.\n\n[Build - Maintain [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=29)\n\n### Chih Cheng Liang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2017 \n\nI'm glad to be part of Eth2 development. There are too many people; I can't express my gratitude enough. There are lots of beautiful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nI'm excited to see what Ethereum will be with fully-fledged PoS as well as sharding.\n\nI'm most proud of introducing the Milagro BLS binding to Trinity. BLS signatures are like the steroids of Eth2. Back then, only one Python library, py_ecc, met the requirements of the Beacon Chain spec. py_ecc is great for research or education purposes, but for things like client implementations, the performance of the library is not on par. The naïve alternative is to find a Python binding of a fast language. Chia's Python binding to C++ code was the low hanging fruit to pursue.\n\nAs the Beacon Chain BLS requirements became more specific, and we had to interop with other clients in a short timeframe, we decided to try using Python to wrap \"milagro_bls\" - Sigma Prime's Rust library. The result is the \"milagro_bls_binding\" library. I'm proud of it because that's my first Rust-ish project, and it was used in a real use case.\n\nAs for most challenging bug, in early 2018 I worked on the [Casper prototype testnet](https://github.com/ethereum/trinity/pull/954) that Karl and Vitalik built on pyethapp. Pyethapp had many issues, but the most difficult one to debug was the peer connection issue. I got a lot of help from Dmitry from the Harmony team, he discovered many peer connection issues with the Java client's logs. One of them was pyethapp's catastrophic peer-to-peer bug.\n\nSpecial thanks to Jannik Luhn - he contributed lots of quality work in peer to peer research/simulation and Trinity.\n\n### Dankrad Feist\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- June 2018 \n\nBy historical accident, one of my first ever involvements with Ethereum was the research workshop in Berlin 2018 where the Beacon chain design (and merging of Casper and Sharding) was first decided. I had only come to the workshop because I was in Berlin at the time for my startup and my former colleague and friend, Justin Drake, had invited me to check it out. The concepts that were talked about at this workshop immediately appealed to the nerd inside me -- deep maths and computer science problems, nevertheless approachable and worth exploring to find elegant solutions. \n\nOver the next few months, I tried my luck on some of the problems that were discussed, especially the randomness problem. However, it would only be March 2019 that I left my startup and went to work on Ethereum 2.0 full time, so I would say that the concept of the beacon chain was by then fairly mature and what was left to be done was more tinkering around the edges.\n\nI think it is always worth reminding ourselves that the beacon chain itself, while only one part of Eth2.0, is a very ambitious project. As far as I am aware, Proof of Stake has never been tried on this scale: neither economically nor in the networking sense. What I mean by this is the sheer amount of funds that can be staked on the beacon chain, which due to the Ether market cap can easily approach billions of dollars in value. This is one advantage smaller projects certainly do have over Ethereum -- they can increase stake gradually, whereas Eth2.0 will very quickly go all the way.\n\nNot only that, but most other projects have refrained from actually imposing penalties on validators -- which compromises the security of PoS networks, but obviously makes designing it much easier, because literally nothing is at stake except for some very minor rewards.\n\nFinally, and this is the most important distinction, Eth2.0 is designed so that it can literally accommodate a million validators. That's pretty impressive considering that most other projects only support around 100! Not only that, but this feat is achievable using fairly modest node requirements, in fact it seems perfectly plausible to run a validator on a mobile phone or a Raspberry Pi.\n\nWhen we do launch the beacon chain, which is now truly imminent (barring extreme surprises), we should keep in mind just how ambitious this project is even on its own. \n\nThe beacon chain was essentially frozen 3 months after I joined the team full time, so I would not claim that I have made any major contributions to it. My most important contribution to Eth2.0 that is slated for inclusion so far is re-architecting the Proof of Custody construction so that it is fully suitable for SSVs (Secret Shared Validators). While we weren't too sure of the experimental cryptographic Legendre pseudo-random function (PRF) when we first came across it in March 2019, it has successively improved to a truly impressive construction on all fronts that I am now very proud of:\n\n1. Extended cryptoanalysis has improved our confidence in the Legendre PRF a lot in response to several bounties that we have set out.\n2. The combination of the Legendre PRF with the Universal Hash Function primitive, suggested by Dmitry Khovratovich, means that only a single evaluation of the PRF is needed per proof of custody, and the rest of the computation is extremely efficient and even faster than regular (sha256) hashing.\n3. Thanks to the probabilistic 0.01 bit proof of custody idea, only a small amount of information is leaked from the proof of custody, such that it would be impossible to gain access to custody secrets even if the Legendre PRF were broken outright.\n\nFinally, I have huge respect for Danny Ryan. He is phenomenal at keeping everything together and making it work.\n\n### Danny Ryan\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- 2017 \n\nSurprise! Everything is a bit harder than originally expected (at least from my perspective) - I suppose most of the things worth doing in life are. Today, I am very excited about the project and the progress. Eth2 has an incredibly strong technical background and is ready for the next wave of upgrades. Huge shout-out to the hard work from client teams, as well as to the validator community keeping this thing running.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the [beacon chain spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md).\n\nFinally, I don't want to imagine how this would have gone without protolambda's insight and technical contributions over the past couple of years.\n\n### Dmitriy Ryajov\n\n- Status  \n- libp2p developer\n- August 2019 \n\nSuper grueling, but rewarding in terms of overall impact on the different ecosystems, Eth2 itself, the Nim language and libp2p.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Nim libp2p implementation.\n\n### Hsiao-Wei Wang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- Summer 2017 \n\nMy journey started with implementing Serenity™. It was an ambitious and abstract concept. We've struggled with the design trade-offs for a long time, but with more and more contributors who devoted their efforts, and years of hard work, we were finally able to divide and conquer Eth2.\n\nIt was a fantastic journey to launch Phase 0 finally. I'm so grateful for the broad community support. And, of course, the Ethereum heroes who dove into Ethereum R&D.\n\nI'm very excited about the next Eth2 milestones and the creative ideas that the community will build on Eth2.\n\nI want to mention my admiration for Virgil Griffith, a pioneer that paved the way for Ethereum research work.\n\n[Seen and Seeing [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=30)\n\n### Ivan Martinez\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Engineer\n- August 2018 \n\nWorking on Eth2 has been an amazing adventure. It went from contributing in my free time to becoming my longest running full-time job. While there have been a few blocks on the way (unstable spec, implementation problems, testnet drama), it's been an absolute blast and this is just the start! Very excited to release, and move forward with future phases!\n\nI am particularly proud of building our [end-to-end testing suite](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/3932), which has proved incredibly useful for detecting issues before changes reach the canary. I've also helped build a lot of the [slasher](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5043) and optimized it for mainnet usage.\n\nOne of the most memorable bugs I encountered would have to be: [\"Change StreamIndexedAttestations to use target root for state regen #5971.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5971)\n\nShoutout to Terence Tsao! His ability to understand the spec has constantly amazed me (he's the largest contributor to the spec outside of the EF!).\n\nAlso.. Danny Ryan is awesome :)\n\n### Jacek Sieka\n\n- Status  \n- Research Lead\n- March 2018 \n\nI was fortunate to join Eth2 at the very start - having worked on many open source projects before, for fun, peer-to-peer networks like DC++, compilers like nlvm, as well as high-frequency trading. It all came together at that point like a perfect fit - a giant stroke of good luck. Here we are, years later, with the baby well on its way to being delivered.\n\nThe work I'm most proud of is managing to restore sanity and switching [Eth2 to Little Endian](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/139). It survived several high-profile attempts to swing it back to Big. I guess a more memorable, and certainly more involved feature, was the deep collaboration on the networking protocol that culminated with [what we have today](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1328) - this was quite the achievement made possible by some round-the-world collaboration with Adrian (of Sigma Prime), Raúl (of libp2p) and lots of others! Less known is that me and Adrian resorted to flipping an Ethereum block hash coin to see who would get to post the PR :)\n\nI'm most proud of when Paul Hauner and I managed to run a fully independent, self-sufficient [multi-client Eth2 network](https://twitter.com/jcksie/status/1171886857908609024) for the first time, at the Canada retreat!\n\n### Jonny Rhea\n\n- Teku, TX/RX  \n- Client lead & TX/RX co-founder\n- November 2018 \n\n\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.\"\n\nParticularly proud of my Ethresearch post, [\"Packetology: Validator \nPrivacy.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/packetology-validator-privacy/7547) \n\nMost memorable bug: [\"DoS Attack on Prysm Stops Finality.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/public-attacknets/issues/12)\n\nShoutout to the Russians! (former Harmony team) “You know that if we don't pull this off we are fired, right?” Joe Delong to me before the interop lock-in.\n\n### Joseph Delong\n\n- Teku  \n- Client Implementer, Researcher\n- December 2018 \n\nI hope we can move from the Beacon Chain to a practical implementation as fast as possible. Most proud of my implementation of the deposit tree logic in Teku. Toughest bug was getting the \"is_valid_merkle_branch\" method working in Teku.\n\nShoutout to Jonny Rhea & Mikhail!\n\n### JosephC \n\n- ConsenSys  \n- R&D\n- January 2019 \n\nThe Beacon Chain launch is like Project Mercury: getting into space/orbit. The equivalents of Project Gemini and Project Apollo are needed next. Rollups and Layer 2 will help improve scalability, but I believe there is much innovation that can and should continue to be done in Layer 1. There is a place for some execution, and cross-shard transactions in Layer 1. I also think that we should be careful about assumptions that we might make, like assuming that cross-shard transactions must be asynchronous. The challenges in the Ethresearch thread [“Cross-shard DeFi composability”](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-defi-composability/6268/9) need tackling with minimal assumptions.\n\nI dream of a system that is more scalable, performant, but preserves the default atomicity and synchronicity of Ethereum. I dream of shards that are transparent and automatically load-balancing. It may sound impossible, but can be used to inspire the engineers of the world to build the ambitious system that we can envision.\n\nDevelopments like Apollo and the Internet are an encouraging reminder to what humanity can accomplish: where there's a will, there's a way.\n\nWhy is this important? Why is a platform for decentralized systems important? John Perry Barlow may have answered it with his [“Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace.”](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)\n\nPersonally, I'm delighted that [\"The Beacon Chain Ethereum 2.0 explainer you need to read first\"](https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain/) is usually on the first page of Google for \"beacon chain.\" I'm most proud of forming and recruiting a talented R&D group at ConsenSys that has made numerous Ethereum contributions. For Eth2, these include a review of the deposit contract and influencing an important Solidity implementation. More well known is the Quilt team, which started from R&D of Eth2 Phase 2 (execution, threads [quilting], rather than Plasma). Finally, years ago I helped connect Karl Floersch to the Casper \"team\" at EDCON Paris.\n\nShoutout to all of Ethereum Layer 0 -- its people -- without which there would be no Layer 1 or beyond. Layer 0 always welcomes you, and all contributions great and small :)\n\n### Justin Drake\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- Late 2017 \n\nLooking back, the beacon chain took longer than expected to ship and there is significant work remaining in the coming years. Having said that, I am incredibly optimistic and excited about the future of Ethereum—I could not be more bullish :)\n\nI'm pretty proud of the fact that the beacon chain spec is executable - it's pretty remarkable IMO. How many complex internet protocols have a full executable spec, not to mention four production-grade implementations on day 1?\t\n\nOne of the \"design bugs\" I was involved with early on was having PoS and sharding be separate cryptoeconomic systems as opposed to one unified design. Another big design flaw was using plain (as opposed to aggregatable) signatures. Looking back, in ~2 years we took a visionary but very rough design and made it orders of magnitude better.\n\nFolks dedicated to Eth2 are a rare breed (less than 100 of us) and I have tremendous respect for the team as a whole, as well as many individuals. I will note that, with where things are headed, we may soon have trillions of dollars running on Eth2 and we will need more manpower. So I want to give a shoutout to you—the reader—to consider joining the Ethereum mission :) Hit me up by email, on Twitter, or on Telegram!\n\n[Traditions [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=31)\n\n### Karl Floersch\n\n- prev. Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- Winter 2017 \n\nIt has been a wild journey to scale Ethereum & we are ridiculously close to realizing the vision after all this time. It's pretty insane. I'm most proud of the early work I did on [Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/casper) and initial implementation of [Hybrid Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/tree/b704a5c6577863edc539a1ec3d2620a443b950fb/ethereum/hybrid_casper). As for bugs, the pyethereum p2p layer was absolutely terrible and really crippled the testnet :'''(\n\nShoutout to Vitalik, Hsiao-Wei Wang, & Justin Drake!\n\n### Kirk Baird\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt's been a very busy two years; as only my second job working in IT, the learning curve has been massive. First and most importantly, my understanding of the core technologies around blockchains has matured from seeing them as a secure linked list to the complex beast they are. With the focus of my work being on integrating BLS into Lighthouse, a significant knowledge of pairing based cryptography was needed. The BLS signature scheme is far more complicated than the existing ECDSA used in Eth1. Luckily, there are a lot of good resources out there which explain how to progress from classical elliptic curve cryptography to pairing based cryptography.\n\nI was lucky enough to go to DevCon Osaka in 2019 which was an amazing experience! There were so many keen minds all meeting to relish and enjoy the progress Ethereum has made, but also to provide insights and ideas on how it will be improved and developed over the coming years. Japan itself is also an amazing place with so much to see, until we almost got stuck in a typhoon.\n\nI am most proud of the work done on [Milagro BLS](https://github.com/sigp/milagro_bls). This library was rough around the edges when I first inherited it, being a long way from the standardised signature scheme we have now.\n\nFinally, wanted to give a shoutout to Danny Ryan! The man is a weapon.\n\n### Mamy André-Ratsimbazafy\n\n- Status  \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nI remember reading the \"70% ready\" spec in july 2018, that was the wild wild west. Things were on a HackMD document, changes were made every 6 hours and very hard to track - as mentioned in the EthCC 2 talk [\"Tests and Simulations of Eth2.0.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c4mQg5L6Rs&t=597s)\n\nOne of the most significant milestones was when, out of nowhere, all 7 clients at the time were able to create a testnet back in September 2019 in Muskoka. Anticipation, apprehension, will the launch work? If yes, that is definitely a huge milestone!\n\nI'm proud of my work on the [\"Auditors Handbook to Nimbus Beacon Chain.\"](https://nimbus.guide/auditors-book/01_introduction.html) Nimbus uses a dark horse language called Nim. It happens to be easily picked up, and our 3 audit teams were pleasantly surprised by its features, including those related to correctness.\n\nThe most infamous bugs we had were related to fork choice / Proof-of-Stake. The most infamous one would be this one-liner hotfix, where some votes were skipped in period of non-finality: [\"hotfix fork choice score application #2041.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/2041/files)\n\nBig respect to Protolambda! He came like the Hagibis storm.\n\n### Matt Garnett \n\n- Quilt  \n- Researcher\n- January 2019 \n\nMy perspective on eth2 is probably very different from many people who were focused on Phase 0. Although I compartmentalized Phase 0 and Phase 1 to a large degree to allow myself to consider the possibilities of Phase 2, I never considered the possibility that eth2 wouldn't ship. To me, it was not a matter of \"if\" but \"when.\"\n\nI'm proud of the work I did writing the first Execution Environment for eth2, called [\"sheth.\"](https://github.com/quilt/sheth) It was completely stateless and allowed Ether transfers within a shard. \n\nShoutout to Proto, he has been instrumental in making eth2 happen, I don't know how he manages to be so prolific.\n\nA quick story to wrap up. On the first day of the Canada interop, the Quilt team drove up from Toronto in a 15-person passenger van. It had rained a bit so the area was sort of wet. The venue was tucked away off on a gravel road, right beside the lake. We pulled the van up next to the parked cars and headed in to visit with the eth2 teams. \n\nAfter catching up with everyone, we returned to the van to drive over to the airbnb we were sharing with the ewasm team. Will Villanueva had driven us there, so he hopped in the driver's seat and began orienting the van forwards to head out. The area we had parked in was sort of a T-intersection and there were small drop-offs (0.5m maybe) into a heavily wooded ditch anywhere there wasn't road. Will backed into one of the legs of the T and started to drive forward to leave. Unfortunately, the exit path was a rather steep gravel hill. The 2WD van didn't have the traction climb out and now we were positioned at an awkward angle in the T. The van was perilously close to tipping over into the ditch. Will backed up to a flatter part to regroup. I offered to give it a shot and he obliged. \n\nAt this point, we had drawn a bit of a crowd. I recall having people at each corner of the van, keeping an eye out to help avoid falling off into the ditch. I gave it a few attempts, but realized how difficult of a situation we were in. At this point, it was unclear if we could even return to our starting place, as the front left and back right of the van were less than a foot away from falling into the ditch - a ditch that would no doubt require a tow truck to collect the van from. There was no other option than making it up the hill. Fortunately, there was a bit of flatter ground between the van and the beginning of the hill. Although it would be a tight fit, likely inches on either side into the wooded ditch, I thought that with speed we should be able to build enough momentum to get past the steep portion of the hill. I shared my plan with the spectators. Unsurprisingly, the uninvested patrons were eager to fill me with confidence so they could enjoy the spectacle. I backed up the van as far as the gravel road would allow and then slammed the gas down. The van lurched forward, albeit lethargically, towards the top of the hill. The eth2 gods were almost certainly looking down on us in that moment and guided that van safely to the hill's peak. \n\nAt the top of the hill, I collected my emotions and then stepped out to enjoy the laughing and cheering. We inspected the ridiculous situation we had been in, and examined the ruts that the tires had made spinning out on the fail attempts. After the excitement died down and the spectators returned to the venue to continue working on their clients, we headed back up the hill to our van and drove home. \n\nFor the rest of the time there, we parked the van at the top of the hill and walked down to the venue.\n\n### Mehdi Zerouali\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Security Engineer, Cofounder\n- October 2018 \n\nI find it hard to believe that we're finally launching the beacon chain! So much hard work from so many different entities has gone into this over the past couple of years. I'm extremely proud of what Sigma Prime has accomplished so far and look forward to the Lighthouse crew making Phase 1, Phase 1.5 and Phase 2 a reality.\n\nThe structural differential fuzzer I've helped build as part of Beacon Fuzz is definitely something I'm proud of. Over the last few months, Beacon Fuzz helped uncover more than 40+ bugs on all major client implementations, including critical consensus related vulnerabilities.\n\nIt's hard to pick one person to recognize, but Diederik Loerakker (aka protolambda) has done such an amazing job helping the client teams navigate the optimisations required to implement the eth2 spec in production. Of course, the coordination job done by Danny Ryan is second to none. I doubt we'd be where we are today without these two exceptional individuals.\n\nFun fact: Lighthouse releases are named after Rick & Morty characters!\n\n### Meredith Baxter\n\n- Teku  \n- Client Implementer, Software Engineer\n- November 2019 \n\nI was fortunate to join the Teku team at an exciting time (about a year ahead of the beacon chain launch) in November of 2019. We had a lot of work ahead of us and we weren't sure whether or not we would meet launch deadline with a fully functional, production-ready client. The learning curve to understanding eth2 is also pretty steep, which only increased the pressure. Luckily, the EF and other eth2 client teams have been an incredible resource for us throughout the development process. The engineers involved across the client teams have been very open and supportive. And the EF researchers have been amazingly welcoming, approachable, and responsive. They've always been there for us to answer questions and provide insights. It has been hugely gratifying to be a part of the successful launch of the beacon chain with the help of this incredible group of people. I'm very excited to continue the work as we look forward to upcoming changes including our first hard fork, sharding, and the merge.\t\n\nOne exciting milestone was getting [Teku syncing to a live](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/1143) testnet (Prysm's Sapphire testnet).\n\nI'm also really proud of our [checkpoint sync feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz3flfj50Ig) which allows new nodes to sync up and become fully operational within minutes. See the issue as well: \"[Implement sync from a recent state #3063](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/issues/3063).\"\n\nThe instability on the Medalla testnet in the fall of 2020 was a trying moment across the client teams, but we came out stronger on the other side. We were all working overtime to improve performance and patch issues revealed by the long period of non-finalization. One big fix I managed to push during this time involved putting a hard limit on amount of work required to regenerate states that dropped out of our in-memory cache: [\"[Issue 2608] Add ability to periodically persist hot states #2611.\"](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/2611) More context on the network instability can be found here: [\"Eth2 Implementers’ Call #46 - 2020-08-20.\"](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/S1b2sJhzv)\n\n### Michael Sproul\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nAfter a brief foray into the blockchain world in 2017, I developed a taste for it and knew I had to come back. When I saw a job ad from SigP on Twitter for a proof-of-stake client in Rust, I dropped what I was doing and got involved ASAP. At the beginning I got deep into Lighthouse's consensus code which was then very much in flux due to lots of spec changes, and had been written in a gargantuan solo effort by Paul! From that foothold in consensus I then branched out into the database, op pool and slashing -- all of which captured my interest in a way no other project had. \n\nWhen we ran the first testnets in September 2019 off code I'd contributed to, I was kind of shocked the thing worked at all, and awed by all the hard work done by everyone else involved. This community of researchers, programmers and enthusiasts has been nothing but amazing, and I'm optimistic for a successful Phase 0 launch and the realisation of the Eth2 dream in Phase 1 and beyond. Personally, I can't wait until we can run some transactions, and look forward to getting into the minutiae of WebAssembly execution environments.\t\n\nI'm very proud of Lighthouse's slasher. I was able to draw inspiration from great foundational research laid by Proto, and dedicate myself to building a fast, concise implementation. Testing the implementation on Medalla and watching the carnage inflicted on other validators brought a perverse form of satisfaction ;)\n\nOne of my favorite bugs: [\"DB inconsistent after restart #1488.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/1488)\n\nShoutout to Cem Özer!\n\nI know of at least one core dev who force pushed a commit to master in the EthDenver bathrooms...\n\n### Mikhail Kalinin\n\n- PegaSys, TX/RX  \n- Applied Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nIt's been exciting to see how Hybrid Casper FFG and the Sharding proposal have been merged into what is now called the Beacon Chain. And how this research is evolving, growing, attracting a lot of new people. And finally the result is about to be shipped pretty soon. This was a big part of my life for two and a half years. I anticipate rapid movement towards Shards and the Merge when Phase 0 is shipped. Though there are many things yet to deal with.\n\nI am proud of the [Eth1 Shard Demo](https://github.com/txrx-research/eth1-shard-demo) that we made together with Guillaume from EF with decent support from EF researchers.\n\nI can give recognition to a bunch of people tbh. But, narrowing down, Danny Ryan and Ben Edgington.\n\n### Nathaniel Jensen\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Security Engineer\n- September 2019 \n\nI'd heard a bit about Ethereum before but had not developed a solid understanding.\n\nAlthough relatively new, I'm glad to play a small part in such a technically impressive undertaking. I am continually appreciative that I can work in such an interesting space, with such friendly and impressive colleagues and community, and contribute to something that has the potential to be profoundly important. I'm excited to see Phase 0 mainnet kick off, the culmination of so much effort!\n\nI look forward seeing the space continue to develop with the incorporation of the EVM chain and Layer 2 solutions, and all the interesting use-cases that I can't begin to imagine.\n\nMy primary contribution to the Eth2 ecosystem had been taking on maintenance and development of a differential fuzzer that compares state transitions across the Eth2 clients: beacon-fuzz. In September 2019, Sigma Prime was engaged by the Ethereum Foundation to continue development of Guido Vranken's previous differential fuzzing solution - comparing ZRNT and Pyspec, the Go and Python Eth2.0 executable specifications.\n\nI was primarily responsible for building out [the fuzzing framework](https://github.com/sigp/beacon-fuzz) to include comparison of other client implementations: Lighthouse, Prysm, Nimbus, Teku, Trinity, as well as adding fuzzing targets for additional state transition functions.\n\nAs for most painful bug, see the [\"Beacon Fuzz update 001\"](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/beacon-fuzz-01.html) on the Sigma Prime blog, section \"Golang Library Linking Errors.\" How to try to get multiple Go implementations running without having their dependencies clash, and dealing with arcane linking issues using existing tooling to build a Go fuzzing library that exercises cgo/C code (as Prysm depends on a C/assembly BLS library).\n\nI want to give a shoutout to Protolambda (Diederik Loerakker). He reliably gets to the bottom of really obtuse fuzzing results. He's our consistent fallback for deciphering complicated results across multiple Eth2 client implementations. From our interactions, he clearly comes across as a friendly, genuine, and technically outstanding individual.\n\n### Nishant Das\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Client Implementer\n- June 2018 \n\nIt was a very difficult endeavour to get Eth2 running smoothly. Ultimately, with teams well distributed across the globe, constant communication is always a challenge. However, despite all that, I am really proud of the fact that we have launched Phase 0 with 4 different clients running. I'm very optimistic for the future and am looking forward to the merge. There have been too many bugs to count, and I keep on finding new ones every week.\n\nShoutout to Proto - cross client compatibility would be nowhere near what it is without him constantly monitoring and working on it.\n\n### Paul Hauner\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has fostered an inclusive, open, and merit-based approach to technical collaboration. Under this environment we've seen many researchers, engineers and communicators flourish. This is a testament to what people can do when they share a common goal and are empowered to work on the things that interest them.\n\nAs Eth2 has progressed, Sigma Prime has grown steadily to include a team of talented engineers and computer scientists. I am grateful to work with these people and I learn from them every day.\n\nI hope to see Ethereum evolve into a tool that provides honest utility to everyday people, without jeopardising the sovereignty of their data or selves.\n\nRegarding work I'm proud of, I quite like the [minimal-allocation Merkle-tree hasher](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/consensus/tree_hash/src/merkle_hasher.rs) I built in 2018. It's simpler and more powerful than other algorithms I have seen.\n\nOne notable bug: [\"Manipulating deposit contract to gain an early majority #1446.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1446)\n\n### Pawan Dhananjay\n\n- Sigma Prime  \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2019 \n\nI remember reading Vitalik's proof of stake blog posts in early 2018 and thinking that it sounds all good in theory, but no way we'll have a proof of stake protocol for more than a small number of participants which would work well in practice. Needless to say, it's been extremely impressive to see how far the effort has come in just a few years. Kudos to everyone involved, I'm glad to have been a part of the effort for the past year.\n\nAlso, a huge shoutout to the SigP crew! It has been an absolute blast working with these guys, learning from them and also indulging in their jolly Aussie humor :) Excited for the Phase 0 launch and geared up to begin work on Phase 1!\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be: [\"Update state before producing attestation #1596.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/1596)\n\nBig thanks to protolambda for sure. All his debugging tools have saved me (and many others I'm sure) hours of effort.\n\n### Preston Van Loon\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe last few years have been an adventure, to say the least. At first, I had just a mild interest in Ethereum. I didn't own any cryptocurrencies or really understand how they worked. After a few months of reading, I started to realize two things: 1) Ethereum was this incredible technology that has an unlimited potential to change the world for the better, and 2) Ethereum is incredibly slow and desperately needed to scale. \n\nImmediately, I looked for ways to help contribute to the scaling effort and then I met Raul Jordan. We met together in NYC for coffee and talked about starting a project to work on sharding for Ethereum. We formed Prysmatic Labs. Since starting the company in January of 2018, I've met some of the most interesting people in the world - many have become close friends. Working in Ethereum continues to fulfill my desire to make a positive impact, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the completed roll out of Eth2.\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be that time that all of Prysm nodes thought they were 4 hours in the future and thousands of validators were slashed in a testnet: [\"Roughtime reports clock offset by 4hrs #6825.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/6825)\n\n### Protolambda\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- November 2018 \n\nThe main theme is that we - researchers and client devs - did not make our lives easy. Spec updates have continued to improve the protocol itself, but caused instability in the process of updating implementations. A new network stack was adopted, and many difficult research and implementation problems had to be solved. In the future, I do not think this will change, as Phase 1 and later are complicated too. But the approach can be improved. Exploratory single-client implementation ahead of others could avoid duplicating work for other clients, and enable faster spec updates.\n\nMost memorable bug: [\"247120: encoding/binary: read at most MaxVarintLen64 bytes in ReadUvarint.\"](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/247120)\n\nShoutout to @Butta for his work on the beaconchain explorer.\n\n### Radosław Kapka\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Software Engineer\n- May 2020 \n\nWhat struck me most when I joined the project was the seemingly infinite amount of good will and patience from others when onboarding a new contributor. I really appreciate it. As for the future, I fail to see how Eth2 can not succeed when there are so many great people working on it.\n\nShoutout to the whole Prysmatic team! Everyone is so cool I can't just pick one person.\n\nI planned to visit Japan in the summer of 2020 and start learning Eth2 after coming back. The pandemic ruined my plans so I joined the Prysm project in May as a contributor. Three months later I got invited to be one of the core team members. Pretty cool, huh? I guess 2020 is not that bad after all.\n\n### Raul Jordan\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nWe went from being a bunch of hobbyists and volunteers interested in Ethereum's future, to having a ton of responsibility with a client being used by a large portion of stakers today. Core dev work was indistinguishable from magic to me before starting on this, and it honestly still is. However, I am fortunate to be surrounded by people much smarter than I am, and constantly learning how to write better code. Every day, we feel the weight of the work we do and we foresee it will only keep getting more important, as Phases 1 and 2 develop and eventually Ethereum will be powering world-scale transaction volume, likely using the code we wrote. At some point, the blockchain we are building might have multinational implications, and the hard work from the research team to make it as robust as possible is very encouraging. I could not be any happier with how far it’s come along, and we'll ship it.\n\nI am most proud of our [original eth2 API](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/ethereumapis). One day I was hanging out with Preston and Terence and we’re like “whoa! Etherscan built a block explorer using our API for eth2??” and then beaconcha.in popped up and it was honestly mind-blowing. We spent a lot of time putting it together and it contributed to the success of the Prysm client early on.\n\nOur most memorable bug would have to be the [Medalla Testnet Incident](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-medalla-testnet-incident-f7fbc3cc934a).\n\nI admire my team at Prysmatic Labs. I look up to them every week in awe of their resourcefulness, prescience, and just overall raw software engineering knowledge.\n\nOur journey with eth2 started with a few of us posting in a go-ethereum gitter channel regarding starting a prototype implementation of Vitalik’s sharding FAQ. Little did we know that just a few months later, we would be neck deep into everything about proof of stake and sharding with Vitalik and the Ethereum Research team in Taipei. Coincidentally, I was visiting New York the same week I met Preston online via gitter, and managed to meet up in his office and start Prysmatic Labs officially within the next few days!\n\n### Robert Drost \n\n- Quilt  \n- Project Manager\n- August 2018 \n\nLooking back, one remarkable thing that stands out to me is the unifying culture of optimism and positivity among the people who found Eth and Eth2 and dove into working on it. Kind of by self-selection over time, it's a community that wants to strive for the positive side of things. While it’s not always possible to maintain this, somehow over time it seems to always get back there again.\n\nMoving forward, two themes I look forward to will be the acceleration of innovation and delivery around Eth2, and the growth of bridging among Eth2 and most other crypto communities and protocols that matter.\n\nShoutout to Casey Detrio — I love how he always seems to find a novel analysis angle to things!\n\n### Sam Wilson \n\n- Quilt  \n- Protocol Research Engineer\n- October 2019 \n\nWell, I'm a relative newcomer to Ethereum. I'd been vaguely aware of Ethereum for years, and I had (and still have) a couple hundredths of a bitcoin lying around, but Devcon V was jumping head first into the space.\n\nThe Ethereum community, once you get past all the... crap on the fringe, is full of really welcoming people who come from really diverse philosophies. I found that particularly surprising, given how many scammers and hangers on there are.\n\nEth2, which is actually where I started learning Ethereum, is a huge undertaking being built by an equally huge amorphous conglomeration. Seeing the discussions from execution environments and WASM to pure data availability and minimal execution, and the journey from where we were a year ago to actually getting the beacon chain launched has been one of the most exciting periods of my career so far.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next phases, layers, and whatever else comes with Eth2, but more importantly, I'm excited for the memes, because really, that's what this is all about.\n\nIt's hard to compare what I've contributed with the amazing other things going on in the space, but I guess I'd have to say that the write-up on dynamic state access that Ansgar Dietrichs and I put together is probably the most influential thing I've worked on: [\"State Provider Models in Ethereum 2.0.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/state-provider-models-in-ethereum-2-0/6750)\n\n### Shay Zluf\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nLooking back on this past two years makes me feel how this space is being shaped by the people who build it, their values and their convictions. Working in Prysmatic Labs developed my skills and code quality in a way that I cannot describe. Raul Jordan and Preston van Loon make sure to lead by example. All the team members are super motivated and take eth2.0's success as their own responsibility. That kind of dedication comes only from taking part in a project that has higher purpose for each member of the team. Looking forward, I see those bright and enthusiastic figures attracting many more talented people into the eth2.0 effort, while step by step the Ethereum ecosystem becomes the collaboration infrastructure of humanity.\n\nI took part in kickstarting the slasher implementation in Prysm's code base. As context, old POS systems had a major flaw, called the \"nothing at stake problem.\" Policing the set of rules to avoid this on the massive scale of the beacon chain is a challenge. Solving this led to the design and implementation of the Prysmatic Labs slasher. Working with other team members and protolambda from the eth2.0 research team was a great privilege. I got a first hand experience of protolambda’s ingenuity in finding novel solutions to hard problems.\n\nShoutout goes to Preston Van Loon.\n\n### Stefan Talpalaru\n\n- Status  \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2018 \n\nWe're moving at what probably looks like a slow pace, from the outside, but I'm confident we'll be able to replace Proof of Work with Proof of Stake. I can't wait to see the estimates for energy consumption reduction in the years to come!\n\nI'm proud of the many changes that lead to reproducible builds. It all started with replacing a language-specific package manager with Makefiles and Git submodules, in order to have a fine-grained control over all our dependencies. Over time, it grew into a somewhat reusable [\"build system.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-build-system)\n\nI also liked designing and implementing well-defined components like our [metrics library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-metrics/) or the [NAT traversal library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-nat-traversal). Much messier, but equally rewarding, was changing the Nim compiler and standard library to implement [efficient stack traces](https://github.com/status-im/nim-libbacktrace).\n\nI like hunting down mysterious stack corruptions. A memorable one was due to the wrong calling convention being used in a [C library wrapper](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/677#issuecomment-575636421). Another [nice one](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/issues/640#issuecomment-57008484) was triggered by a procedure parameter called \"errno\" (which the Nim compiler forgot to name-mangle).\n\n### Terence Tsao\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt has been an amazing journey, we have learned and accomplished so much along the way. Lots of great memories and friendships were formed. \n\nWith Phase 0 heading towards finish line, I'm particular excited about Phase 1 and all its cutting edge research. Go Eth2!\n\n### Victor Farazdagi\n\n- Prysmatic Labs  \n- Engineer\n- February 2020 \n\nMy Ethereum journey started in 2016, when I joined Status in building a censorship-resistant messenger. It quickly became apparent that, despite all the goodness the Ethereum platform and its decentralized network brought, in its current implementation they are relatively limited. So, getting attracted to Ethereum 2, with all its ambitious plans to revamp an already hugely innovative product, was just a matter of time for me. Right now, being part of the amazing crowd of highly motivated, even idealistic, people - with a chance to participate in delivering on the original Ethereum promises - is nothing less than a dream come true. I love the community, the leadership, and even the complexity of the software we're building. With Phase 0 behind us, we have significant momentum, so 2021 will definitely become a year of groundbreaking accomplishments!\n\nOne bit of work I am particularly proud of is the [\"initial synchronization implementation,\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/tree/develop/beacon-chain/sync/initial-sync) which absolutely every beacon-node runner relies on. So, whenever you cannot sync, or sync takes forever, you know who to blame for it now!\n\nRegarding nasty bugs, during the [\"Medalla incident\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/7039) in August 2020, we had troubles syncing back. While the fix was easy, discovering the problem wasn't.\n\nShoutout to Diederik Loerakker! (yeah, better known as protolambda)\n\n### Vitalik Buterin\n\n- Ethereum Foundation  \n- Researcher\n- January 2014 \n\nI'm really happy to see how far the Ethereum ecosystem has come in the last few years! In the dark old days back in 2014-2017, it was just myself, Vlad and a couple other people thinking about proof of stake and sharding, and progress was slow; since then, there has been a rapid growth, professionalization and general improvement in the ecosystem and the team. We have much more sophisticated tools, are dealing with advanced cryptography, and a much better process for creating and refining the spec and the implementations. 2020 eth2 is sooo much better than Casper in 2017!\n\nNow, of course, we enter what may perhaps prove to be the most difficult part of the whole process: getting eth2 actually out the door and running. The whole process reminds me of what we had to deal with back in 2015, except this time there's 10x the complexity, 100x more people watching and 1000x the value at stake. Good luck all :)\n\nIf I had to pick one component I'm proud of .. maybe [the entire phase 0 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md)?\n\nShoutout to Danny.\n\n### Will Villanueva\n\n- Quilt  \n- Researcher\n- February 2018 \n\nEth2 research was overwhelmingly fun. We explored pushing the boundaries on how the execution layer could operate. We prototyped, researched, and implemented a simpler version of advanced execution (Execution Environments) on eth1, also known as account abstraction.\n\nA lot of the work Quilt pursued is covered in the post titled [\"Ethereum 2.0 Phase 2 Progress.\"](https://medium.com/@william.j.villanueva/ethereum-2-0-phase-2-progress-7673b57eabff) \n\nAdditionally, some of our account abstraction work can be found on Ethresear.ch as [\"DoS Vectors in Account Abstraction (AA) or Validation Generalization, a Case Study in Geth.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/dos-vectors-in-account-abstraction-aa-or-validation-generalization-a-case-study-in-geth/7937)\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan, all the way!\n\n[Onward [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=32)\n\n---\n\n*Kudos for reading to the end!

{"id": "SKnbeGg0u0WV9mhev0Clmym780XKxhe5xmpe52T-yCg", "title": "The Strongest Crypto Gaming Thesis", "body": "Crypto is not an incremental innovation. Rather, it unlocks fundamentally new ways of doing things that were not possible before. This is true across a wide set of domains: corporations reimagined as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), traditional financial vehicles reimagined as permissionless DeFi protocols, legal agreements reimagined as smart contracts, and other constructs that we don't even have the language to describe yet.\n\nThe most interesting and important applications of crypto will lean heavily into the *new affordances* provided by blockchain technology, instead of just offering incremental improvements to existing applications. This is the same pattern that we've seen with previous computing platforms: smartphones, the World Wide Web, and the personal computer itself. In each of these examples, the longest-lasting and most impactful applications of the tech use the tech to do new things, not to do old things better. Think social media apps versus newspaper websites, online stores versus digital catalogs, or interactive TV versus... well, the Internet.\n\nWhat does this mean for crypto gaming?\n\n## Crypto-Native Games\n\nGaming is a leading indicator on up-and-coming technologies. Games are a technically demanding yet relatively low-stakes environment to explore scalability and usability problems early in a technology platform's lifecycle: security and compliance concerns in games are less critical compared to more \"serious\" commercial or financial applications, often allowing for faster iteration loops. So while the untrained eye might dismiss a platform with \"just\" a bunch of games as frivolous, the discerning will recognize that this state is a valuable testing grounds. How many mobile interaction patterns and habits have their roots in early mobile games like Doodle Jump, Cut the Rope, and Angry Birds?\n\nIf we accept that games are a leading indicator of new technologies, and that the most interesting applications of new technologies will lean into truly new affordances rather than incremental improvements, then it follows that the bleeding edge of crypto application design in the next few years will be found in *crypto-native games*.\n\nA *crypto-native game* is a game that maximally embraces the architectural patterns and ethos of blockchain application development:\n- **The source of truth for game data is the blockchain.** The blockchain is not just used as an auxiliary store of data, or a \"mirror\" of data stored in a proprietary server. *All* of the meaningful data is stored on the blockchain—not just i.e. asset ownership. This allows the game to fully utilize the benefits of programmable blockchain: a transparent data store that is *permissionlessly interoperable*.\n- **The game logic and rules are implemented via smart contract.** For example, combat in a game, and not just ownership, is all on-chain.\n- **The game is developed in accordance with open ecosystem principles.** The game contracts, and an accessible game client, are open-source. Third-party developers are empowered to customize or even fork their own gameplay experiences, through plugins, third-party clients, interoperable smart contracts, and even total redeployment. This in turn allows game developers to harness the creative output of an entire (incentive-aligned) community.\n- **The game is client-agnostic.** This is closely related to the three above points, in that a litmus test for whether or not a game is crypto-native is: \"if the core-developer-provided client disappeared tomorrow, would the game still be playable?\" The answer tends to be yes if (and only if) the game data store is permissionless, if the game logic can be executed permissionlessly, and if the community can interact with the core smart contracts without relying on interfaces provided by a core team.\n- **The game embraces real-world value digital assets.** Blockchains provide a native API into the notion of value itself, and digital assets are by default interoperable with cryptocurrency. This allows game developers to build new, positive-sum incentive structures for their player and developer communities.\n\nNotably, we do **not** consider the following \"crypto-native games\":\n- A traditional mobile shooter with a crypto wallet integration.\n- A TCG where card assets are stored as ERC721 tokens on Ethereum, but battles happen off-chain.\n- A DeFi app that is \"gamified\" or has a playful skin. These apps are valuable and innovative in their own right, but we are specifically interested in applications that are games first and foremost, rather than primarily financial vehicles or protocols. We consider games that are essentially pure speculation on NFTs (an asset class) to be of this category.\n\nThis is not to say that only crypto-native games can be successful (commercially or artistically), while games that use blockchain in weaker ways cannot. However, crypto-native games are the most important games to look at if we want to understand the long-term implications of blockchain tech.\n\nThese games seek to unlock mechanics that are fundamentally new, rather than just making incremental improvements on existing games. They provide us with sandboxes—microcosms of the integrated digital worlds of the future—to see how these mechanics play out. And finally, they are probably most well-positioned in the long term to leverage the unique new incentive mechanisms and ownership models unlocked by blockchains.\n\nIn future posts, we'll discuss a few of these new affordances that we think will be especially important, and the ways that we're using ZK Games like Dark Forest to prove these out conceptually.", "timestamp": 1627537639, "digest": "nsteOfjATPSKH0J8lRD0j2iynmvv_C8i8eb483UzcTM", "contributor": "0x6e95A8B294d7A159B2488f3d7119F82a0e243014"}

While our first iteration taught us a lot about the culture around streaming, what it means to create content, how to build support around your playstyle, and how to create unique branding—v2 of our org will lean into the ecosystems of Web3.

Axie has great gameplay mechanics and cross-consumer appeal to develop a range of content. At BLVKHVND we see a cross-pollination of our players building comp teams, developing content around mechanics, metas, breeding, as well as contributing to building a dynamic eSports Axie league within North America.\n\n**Parallel TCG** is no different. While the main game has not launched yet, Parallel is one of the most anticipated blockchain based AAA titles with Magic, the Gathering level appeal. Parallel can become a TCG titan with an expansive league for competitive play, amateur appeal, casual play while inventing new mechanics for trading cards we haven’t seen yet. At BLVKHVND, we want to be at the cutting edge of new, novel gaming experiences because it gives us the opportunity to develop and shape a better culture for gaming overall.\n\n\n## Player Recruitment\n\nTeams are more than just the *players*, good teams have coaches, analysts, and trainers at the highest competitive level. For us, serving casual, amateur, and pro-level players is no easy task, but one we are eager to tackle. Our focus will be recruiting for enthusiastic, coachable players that have the propensity to learn and experiment with their gameplay. Knowledge and experience of the game titles a player is interested in forming a team is important as is some level of competitive experience.\n\nApplications will become available after we deploy our crowdfund. We will make an announcement on our Twitter and Discord accounts!\n\n\n----------\n\n\n## What this could mean for ESPORTS?\n\nAt BLVKHVND, we’ve competed in leagues before. From GameBattles, MLG, Halo League, CDL, Pokemon, League of Legends, EVO, smash.gg....we know what it means to play at a high level. We also know how fragmented and frustrating competitive leagues are as it relates to game interest level, lack of a player’s guild, high churn, team breakdowns, etc. Based upon our collective experiences, we believe that there is a better way to create a competitive ecosystem where everyone wins.\n\nOur formative longterm goal is not to become just one of the best and innovative esports organizations, but to become player advocates and league developers. We shouldn’t just compete, we can create. By supporting us, we can create a flourishing esports environment for casual, amateur play AND pro level players.\n\nThrough web3, a community structured like BLVKHVND can develop collective upside for all members because of shared goals and aligned incentives. As such, the greatest opportunity is in building trust that through active participation and investment, that you will be rewarded.\n\n\n## Let’s not play the game, change the game.

Parallel can become a TCG titan with an expansive league for competitive play, amateur appeal, casual play while inventing new mechanics for trading cards we haven’t seen yet. At BLVKHVND, we want to be at the cutting edge of new, novel gaming experiences because it gives us the opportunity to develop and shape a better culture for gaming overall.\n\n\n## Player Recruitment\n\nTeams are more than just the *players*, good teams have coaches, analysts, and trainers at the highest competitive level. For us, serving casual, amateur, and pro-level players is no easy task, but one we are eager to tackle. Our focus will be recruiting for enthusiastic, coachable players that have the propensity to learn and experiment with their gameplay. Knowledge and experience of the game titles a player is interested in forming a team is important as is some level of competitive experience.\n\nApplications will become available after we deploy our crowdfund. We will make an announcement on our Twitter and Discord accounts!\n\n\n----------\n\n\n## What this could mean for ESPORTS?\n\nAt BLVKHVND, we’ve competed in leagues before. From GameBattles, MLG, Halo League, CDL, Pokemon, League of Legends, EVO, smash.gg....we know what it means to play at a high level. We also know how fragmented and frustrating competitive leagues are as it relates to game interest level, lack of a player’s guild, high churn, team breakdowns, etc. Based upon our collective experiences, we believe that there is a better way to create a competitive ecosystem where everyone wins.\n\nOur formative longterm goal is not to become just one of the best and innovative esports organizations, but to become player advocates and league developers. We shouldn’t just compete, we can create. By supporting us, we can create a flourishing esports environment for casual, amateur play AND pro level players.\n\nThrough web3, a community structured like BLVKHVND can develop collective upside for all members because of shared goals and aligned incentives. As such, the greatest opportunity is in building trust that through active participation and investment, that you will be rewarded.\n\n\n## Let’s not play the game, change the game. The crowdfund for BLVKHVND will start August 15th. See you there.\n\n\n------\n\n*If you enjoyed this post and want to support us as we gear up for the crowdfund, consider adding a tip to this article. The funds we receive will be split 5 ways: 4 to the core team, and our BLVKHVND wallet that we created to register for the $WRITE race. After the crowdfund, we will move any ETH from the split contract in that wallet and transfer rights to the Mirror profile to a Gnosis Safe wallet (the Treasury).*\n\n[BLVKHVND - Building a Decentralized eSports Community](split://0x276e9C8803F767A683b3654542AA11923100C7cC?network=mainnet)\n\n\n**Special Thanks:**\n\n- FWB for charting the path for tokenized communities.\n- The folks at Parallel and Axie for giving feedback and encouraging this initiative.\n- The BLVKHVND crew for making the leap into crypto.\n- Our discord community that has supported us since our inception.\n\n\n**Join the BLVKHVND community:**\n\nOur [Discord](https://community.blvkhvnd.com) is open to all.

{"id": "gn1IxlfRlf3_9xt1X5N9GnoSXgJZcHK-TJAqEl28FYw", "title": "Creating a Community-Specific Reputation Score for Mirror Users", "body": "In my [previous post on digital identity](https://ath.mirror.xyz/mDu_nGsWpjvF-KaPLADwxeAMfze3UJOtTAQi2CwPwWc), I mentioned that \"the tokenization of these graph shards could take many forms and will likely be layered upon by proof tokens.\" I believe that sharded graph identity approach requires coming up with a community-specific reputation score that measures how influential a certain person has been in expanding a specific network. While some reputation scores may be more set in terms of having to have done X or Y actions, this score captures a users reputation in the context of other users in a more fluid manner - **acting like a signal rather than a badge**. \n\nTypically in Web2, users are \"rewarded\" by an algorithm which will highlight them based on the engagement and attention they bring to the platform. Thus, their reputation score is just the number of likes or followers they have - regardless of who those vanity metrics come from. In Web3, we typically reward with tokens representing the value of the protocol or product. These tokens also carry a lot of power in the form of voting and other privileges. As such, a score that **signals not only influence but also how supportive or aligned a user is** with the rest of the community will become increasingly important over time.\n\nFor this post, we will be focusing on creating a reputation score for Mirror users (voters, writers, contributors) based on where each user sits on an interaction-based social graph across Ethereum, Twitter, and Mirror data. I chose Mirror for three reasons:\n\n1. I'm already very familiar with their community and product\n2. They have verifiable consolidation of identity on their platform (Ethereum <> Twitter), allowing me to layer social graphs together.\n3. Their product and governance are heavily user-to-user interaction focused, something most products on Ethereum don't currently have (we mostly interact with pools or marketplace protocols).\n\nSocial graphs themselves are not new, but selectively layering them will open up quite a few new doors of usability and meaningfulness. There are two main reasons for this: \n\n1. **Enabling new applications:** We can use this graph data to create a context-dependent community-specific reputation score, which is then applicable in many situations.\n2. **What the data represents:** The creation of a representational network built off of scarcity creates a social graph that proxies how users support one another. \n\n**Enabling new applications:** The way that we understand the layering affects what we do with the data. The way I see it, Ethereum is a base layer social graph that everything else is built upon. Platforms like Mirror and Twitter are *contexts* that sit on top of this base layer and shift how we see the connection of users across the space.\n\n![I don't have the design capability, but imagine this in 3D where each box is a slice across a sphere at various angles. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/41ac44d5-3e52-42a5-bcf2-d2fb22764e23.jpeg?height=794&width=1259)\n\nBecause I wanted to analyze only users of Mirror, I took just a subset of available Ethereum and Twitter data. Those who have a high community-specific reputation score could get a larger token airdrop, be delegated for roles (or more votes) in treasury management, or get preferential access to new protocol features. There are also many more such contexts like Mirror built on top of Web2 + Web3 platforms, such as NFT communities (Cryptopunks, BAYC, Blitmaps) and gaming communities (Axie Infinity, Darkforest). \n\nAs DAOs start working together more and the metaverse becomes more interconnected, we'll see more communities (and contexts) overlap. I imagine that studying how people and communities interact *within and across different contexts of the social graph* could produce mixed-community reputation scores which could be applied in quite a few different situations. For example, this score could be used for multi-token or collaborative NFT airdrops, as well as choosing leaders for partnerships and programs like [rabbithole's pathfinder initiative](https://rabbithole.gg/pathfinder). \n\n**What the data represents:** The kinds of data collected and used affect the social graph as well. Using data from $WRITE votes, funding contributions (across editions, splits, crowdfunds, and auctions), and Twitter mentions, I want to represent three buckets of scarcity (respectively): belief, capital, and attention. \n\n![Yes, technically this should be visualized as a self-referencing loop but that can come across as confusing](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b8de33dc-4db4-4543-a53d-2cb6a0213202.jpeg?height=870&width=1148)\n\nI believe that analyzing how interactions connect different people across these three buckets *gives us a proxy for how much they support each other*. I also believe that *networks of support give us a more accurate representation of communities within social graphs*. These two assumptions gave me confidence in using a concept called \"betweenness centrality\" as a primitive for a reputation score. \n\nThe selection of data representation and contexts was key to the form the social graph ultimately took. If I wanted to proxy just willingness to contribute, then I would probably create a completely create node schemas based on different kinds of products/categories of creators rather than a pure user-to-user graph. This would likely shift the shape of the social graph completely. \n\n## Using Graph Data Science to Create a Community Reputation Score: Betweenness Centrality\n\nLet's try to target and quantify the strong connection points of the social graph of race participants, writers, and contributors. I've chosen to use a concept called \"betweenness centrality\" to represent the score of each node. Betweenness centrality is calculated [using an algorithm that calculates the shortest path between all nodes for all nodes](http://www.inf.uni-konstanz.de/algo/publications/b-fabc-01.pdf)). \n\nCommunity clusters in a social graph usually look something like this:\n\n![Example social graph with community detection, where nodes represent people and lines represent different types of interactions](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2db87fc5-a4b7-44a6-b0ce-bd064d8850a5.jpeg?height=320&width=320)\n\nFor Mirror, the base social graph of who has voted for who looks like this:\n\n![Gold dots are winners, purple dots are still competing in the race. Above there are 2130 nodes pictured, where 2041 of the nodes have put in at least one vote.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7e077f8b-91f9-4191-b4fe-4c271b67dbda.jpeg?height=2732&width=2804)\n\n![Here is a zoom-in on the nucleus, color-coded by each community using the [Leiden Community Detection](https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.leiden.html?highlight=leiden#cdlib.algorithms.leiden) method. From this and the plot above, we can see there are quite a few communities but almost all the winners sit in the very middle.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d2457836-c1e5-4ce5-a07f-97e083be5415.jpeg?height=1645&width=1688)\n\nHowever, this doesn't have an outside-of-race social context yet. Let's layer in Ethereum transaction-level data - this is limited to Mirror-related transactions between participants, such as **sending a split, funding a crowdfund, and buying an edition or reserve auction.** \n\n![Pink indicates Ethereum tx, note that there are some nodes that are just an Ethereum address and don't have associated Twitter data as they aren't registered in the race.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6236ce49-4929-47e5-a13b-b2763831ffb4.jpeg?height=416&width=428)\n\nNow we'll add Twitter data too, which will link nodes based on **who has mentioned another participant** in their last 2000 tweets.\n\n![Blue now represents Twitter mentions between nodes\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6f977615-b6c9-4553-ba0d-ae8f8c48652a.jpeg?height=561&width=479)\n\nShowing the interactions (edges) in a cleaner fashion, the mix of interactions across the social graph looks like this: \n\n![Counting the number of users who have interacted with each other in each facet.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ff2b56c4-c5f0-4373-9f0b-a0ae18b5c4dd.jpeg?height=558&width=568)\n\nNow getting back to the original point, the expectation is that some of these nodes between large clusters would get a higher weighting than others since they've connected the paths across the most other nodes. \n\n![The top 300 betweenness users have been highlighted in red, we can see they start to spread fairly far out from the center of the graph. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3256b58d-2f95-4d03-9cba-d68c363242fb.jpeg?height=505&width=473)\n\nThis is called \"betweenness\" and is a factor I believe to be very important when trying to proactively grow a community. The base idea here is that the higher the \"betweenness\" factor a person has, the more likely they will lead to creating connections and branches that build up a more diverse community. There have been a few research papers that highlight the beneficial effect that nodes with high betweenness have on the [diffusion of a community](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2365952.2366010) as well as [building the resilience of a network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.3710.pdf). \n\nSome of you might be wondering why I chose betweenness centrality over something like closeness or degree centrality. Those latter two metrics highlight pure influence, and I don't think reputation in a community should be based on just those who already have that level of influence. The [Graph Algorithms](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Graph_Algorithms/z4WZDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) textbook by Neo4j puts the concept behind betweenness very well:\n\n> \"Sometimes the most important cog in the system is not the one with the most overt power or the highest status. Sometimes it’s the middlemen that connect groups or the brokers who have the most control over resources or the flow of information. Betweenness Centrality is a way of detecting the amount of influence a node has over the flow of information or resources in a graph. It is typically used to find nodes that serve as a bridge from one part of a graph to another.\"\n\n***A lot of Web2 has been about concentrated influence and echo chambers, I believe Web3 should try to enable and incentivize creating bridges as much as possible instead.*** \n\nFor anyone who wants to see the scores, check out the [sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XiX8b7KkvtfBE2KLJWv-mCPtphrQxjt1-g4wKCa4JwE/edit?usp=sharing). Note that these values have not been weighted based on data/edge type, so some users may have higher betweenness due to Twitter interactions rather than Mirror/Ethereum interactions.\n \n## Why is this Methodology Important to the Score?\n\nWe've already discussed some of the applications of this score, but the solution I used may still appear unnecessarily complex or overengineered. I think this methodology is required to provide composability while also measuring reputation in a way that is much tougher to game. \n\n**Composability:** As mentioned before, this graph is built up layer-by-layer. The data elements are all publicly available to collect, the model follows a search algorithm and is flexible to whatever nodes or edges (users or interactions) are chosen, and once the pipeline is built once it can be reused or forked for any set of tweaks. Hopefully in the future, all the available data components just sit in a user interface and this model becomes drag and drop. From there I imagine you could export scores or connect directly to something like [disperse.app](https://disperse.app) or [galaxy drops](https://galaxy.eco).  \n\n**Durability:** The problem with many scores and measures is that once they have been publicly used once, then people can start to figure out how to game the system. This is especially true for anything that is just `user <> protocol` interaction based. Creating a model that is `user <> user <> user` dependent is harder to game because the users in the current community won't necessarily reciprocate interactions with a bad actor. Actions are also compounding, so having just one interaction (or one type of interaction) will not be good enough to get a higher score). Even if they do find some way to game it, then congratulations you now have another active participant who is contributing to the community.\n\n*These two elements allow for an overall stronger reputation score mechanism, which I believe justifies the efforts it takes to get there.*\n\n## In Conclusion:\n\nI would like to continue iterating this research and possibly use this kind of score for specific use cases from protocols and communities (please reach out if interested). If you've made it this far and want to contribute to this analysis with ideas or technical expertise, I do invite you to [join ImagDAO](https://discord.gg/XqeMfwda) for further work on social graph data and decentralized identity). \n\nThe next steps include more data collection, setting up a Neo4j dashboard for others to play with, and of course applying more data science algorithms. Machine learning and community detection will likely take on a bigger role in the future as we try to predict how the social graph will grow or try to target specific sub-communities. \n\nI mentioned before that this analysis was only possible because of the verifiable consolidation of identity by Mirror's platform (Ethereum <> Twitter). Continuation of this work heavily depends on an identity consolidation API as well, so anyone working in this context please connect with me as well (looking at you Ceramic and Gitcoin 👀).\n\n*The data and scripts may be shared publicly later once I refactor and figure out how to protect the privacy of users in this social graph.*\n\n*Special thanks to Ben Schecter for all his help and ideas in reviewing this post*\n\n**If you want to support more of this research, consider bidding on the auction for \"Decentralized Community\" or contributing to the split below:**\n\n[Token #4194](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=4194&auctionId=0x16debea9373883b908a8eaf60ed2648180492899ce89f6d7c77f34c6f62021fa)\n\n[Social Graph Searchers](split://0x370d93E74E0f5Aa84caeC70A36c75e489EEaf1cF?network=mainnet)\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1627574072, "digest": "aYOJc8pihb9wxI___QR9qmM5mQ4caUyQhHJIlevspjw", "contributor": "0x2Ae8c972fB2E6c00ddED8986E2dc672ED190DA06"}

Additionally it grants access to Airdrops, Giveaways, Auctions, The ShinyDAO and Special Events.\n*\nNow some contributions from the community on the areas we cover.\n\n## NFTs\nby Danidr\n\n**What are they?**\n\nNFT collectibles are similar to traditional collectibles - think of childhood trading cards - except they're digital things that are scarce thanks to blockchain technology. They are sold at a specific time (where you can mint them) and they act as a gateway to being part of a community. An algorithm creates a randomized NFT by combining attributes such as background, clothes, or accessories. These traits have unequal distribution, so certain avatars are favored above others. People are always looking for the rarest and most aesthetic avatars because these made the best profile pictures (PFP).\n\nThe number of unique users who acquired the NFTs and the price floor define the early success of the collectible project. Users don’t know what NFT they will receive until they purchase it through the website. Buyers' behavior mimics that of gamblers, who place bets in the hopes of winning an avatar with unique characteristics. Collectors are often compelled to buy multiple items to boost their chances of obtaining the best-looking NFT to multiply their initial value.\n\n**How it all started?**\n\nThis whole trend began in 2017 with CryptoPunks, one of the first NFT collectibles. Larva Labs hit all the right notes with their concept's simplicity, laying the groundwork for future projects. CryptoPunks has gone a long way since its humble beginnings in a remote corner of the internet and is now the top-grossing NFT collection. The punks' strength stems in part from being the first avatar collection craze at the time, but blaming it on this merely undervalues the creativity of the concept. Collectibles have been around since kids traded sports cards, but turning them into an avatar to be used as a symbol of identity was a brilliant move. As a profile photo, the CryptoPunk identified people as part of a bigger whole that stood for something and revolted against centralized finance.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11934913-5f8c-44f4-89a0-e8ed9497ded1.png?height=630&width=1200)\n\n**How did they become mainstream?**\n\nWhen the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched in early May 2021, it built on the foundations laid down by CryptoPunks. BAYC became the first true NFT-club by combining the fundamentals of avatarisation and community-building with a layer of exclusivity. They have several perks like BAYC-radio and members-only goods. The enigmatic promise that the apes will \"unlock digital doors for you\" makes it even more exclusive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1e6beb7a-552c-4332-84d6-57940004aad3.png?height=666&width=1000)\n\nAfter the initial boom, they kept pioneering the space when they gifted a dog companion (Bored Ape Kennel Club) to every ape owner, raising the ape value and adding a new dog NFT worth 1.5 ETH (around $3,000) before it was revealed.\n\n**What are the most popular projects out there?**\n\nThere are more than 50 projects out there, and the numbers are rapidly increasing each week.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d459dd1a-8d67-480c-b1bd-99a2b1045f60.png?height=748&width=1479)\n\nApart from the two previously mentioned projects, other great contenders to become the new best NFT collectible project are (in no order):\n\n- Cool Cats\n- Gutter Cat Gang\n- Meebits\n- VeeFriends\n- The Wicked Craniums\n- DeadHeads\n- GoatZ\n- The Alien Boy\n- … and many more\n\n**What the future holds?**\n\nSince BAYC, several projects followed that path and launched their collectible project. Some of them have a lower (Gutter Cat Gang with 3,000) or a higher collection (The Wicked Craniums with 10,762), and others have added new mechanisms like forging 2 NFTs into 1 (The Forge by GoatZ).\n\nTo grasp the current scale, you must look at the sales figures. For instance, Mike Tyson just spent $10,000 on a cartoon cat avatar.\n\nCommercial Rights, which are transferred with the token, could also bring to the owners some profit from their asset. There are talks of a movie being made with DeadHeads, which could give a flow of payments to asset holders whose PFPs are used in the film.\n\nA new utility for holding these avatars is being announced each passing week. From exclusive merch to airdrops, breeding, or a place in the metaverse for the community.\n\nWe're still months or years away from true acceptance, but when more built-out 3D virtual environments like Decentraland and Sandbox are used, NFT PFP holders will be able to utilize their PFPs as a 3D avatar in the metaverse world. This will give the assets more shape and utility.\n\nDisclaimer: We are proud owners of several of these NFT collectibles, so we’re looking forward to seeing how this space evolves and what it can bring to holders.\n\n## DAOs\nby Awisemaninmotion\n\nDAOs are to 2021 what Defi was to 2020.\n\nAs is natural with any trend, you're going to get all kinds of takes on what it is and what it isn't. \nEarly adapters are going to go through experimental growing pains, and those who are paying attention to the ecosystem at large are poised to make the best strides going forward. \n\nIn other words, these are the nascent days of DAOs. To be part of one is to be part of an ongoing experiment that will (hopefully) change the way the world interacts and collaborates. \n\nHowever, like with any new and exciting idea, it can be easy to loose the forest from the trees.\n\nThe people who can speak to running a DAO are outnumbered by those who have questions about running one.\n\nSome of the most common comments I've heard so far regarding DAOs and Web3 have been:\n\n- Should I start a DAO on Discord or Telegram? \n- Is Slack still a thing? \n- When/how should I mint a token? \n- What web3 wallet should I use? \n- What's a test network/sub chain?\n- Are DAOs just places to talk about NFTs and Crypto?\n\nIf you've been part of a DAO for awhile, the questions get more granular:\n\n- Where is that article/tweet/meme someone posted the other day?\n- Where do I find (insert question here)?\n- When are we going to mint our token?\n- Should we be voting on everything?\n- What do we do with users who just hang around and don't want to actively participate? \n- The Discord and the Discourse are in Disarray and I'm at a loss for what to Do.\n\nDAOs have many things to work through, but one of the most pressing things I see is how to scale one from an operations point of view. Discord may be the chat platform of choice at the moment, but it wasn't made for the kind of dynamic collaboration DAOs strive to become. \nMore activity and more members come at the expense of lost links and buried knowledge. \n\nUnless you have a background in project management or worked in operations, you're likely to overlook this problem until you can't ignore it. The truth is that if you're all in on DAOs, or collaboration in the web3 world you WILL eventually have this problem. \n\nSince we are currently in a web 2.5 world, and will realistically be in this hybrid state for at least few years, what tools can you use to get ahead of this problem? \n\nTo answer this, you have to ask yourself a few questions:\n\n- [ ]  Are you a web3 maximalist that is opposed to a web2 solution?\n- [ ]  Are you willing to solve for now, and figure out how to transition to something thats on chain in the future?\n- [ ]  Are you putting community or technology first?\n\nOnce you honestly answer those questions then you can look for a solution that fits your view. Although, depending on how you answered, not all of these questions have clear solutions. \n\nTo clarify, it's not that there aren't tools to solve aspects of these problems, but each comes with their own issues, and not all play nicely with each other. \n\nRemember, you're a glorified beta tester in an experimental ecosystem. A vast majority of the roads are still under construction ⚠️ and gaps are the norm. \n\nHowever, if you currently run a DAO, one of the most important questions to ask yourself is: \nCan you afford to wait it out for a solution that doesn't currently exist?  \n\nScaling is a natural part of growth and success. There's only so long one can wait on technology, and the more you grow and take on, the less time you likely have to wait. \nI'd rather solve for now and adapt accordingly. As Shiny starts to take its next form in the web3 world, I was adamant on implementing a solution that can work alongside Discord. I didn't want to replace it, but I also didn't want to rely on it.\n\nThat meant building a solution that can currently: \n\n- [ ]  Let those who want to participate have their own space to see what they're responsible for.\n- [ ]  Let teams see a top-level view of the projects they're part of, and see progress in real-time.\n- [ ]  Let people work asynchronously\n- [ ]  Let contributors see what team meetings they're part of, as well as community meetings they would like to be a part of.\n- [ ]  Allow for meetings to be properly documented \n(This means having the ability to get a high-level overview of what was discussed, including access to an audio recording of the meeting if one was recorded)\n- [ ]  Let users assign tasks during a meeting, and have those tasks automatically show up inside participants dashboards.\n\nThis Mirror post was conceived on call and then devised and completed on such a setup. It allowed us to do all of the above in a fluent way. \n\nIf organizing and distributing tasks and bounties are pain points your DAO is currently experiencing, reach out.\n\n## No-code\nby Dysko\n\n**What does the word NoCode mean to you?**\n\nIf you had to explain it to your family, could you summarize it in one sentence? I say maybe since the NoCode space can be broken down into multiple solution verticals. Sometimes I think we try to stuff too much meaning into the NoCode term and marketing teams love to overuse the word.  To us, NoCode is enabling solutions to be implemented by non-coders that are usually implemented by development teams.  The complexity of the solution being implemented can vary drastically and some NoCode tools are targeted at developers that are looking to expedite the implementation of solutions.\n\nAs someone new to the NoCode space, you might find it difficult to determine what effort you will need to invest and become proficient in implementing solutions using NoCode tools. In this short write-up, we will discuss the web application builders vertical to give you an idea of the effort it could take to get comfortable with these tools.\n\nSo what type of NoCode tool falls into the web application builder category? It’s a tool that allows you to build the front-end user interface of your website application at the minimum but it could go way beyond that in the features you’re provided with.  This category is very busy and it keeps evolving every week as seen in our discord NoCode channels at Shiny.\n\nWe feel the best way to present this information is through a matrix that rates the website builders in a few key areas on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is the high score. This will allow you to make a decision on where to start with your next website project.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8005153e-34e9-43e4-846f-cc6a23992a5d.jpeg?height=381&width=632)\n\nOur evaluations are really based on first impressions from an end-user perspective, we assume you are not a professional website designer or builder.  We also wanted to give you some idea of how well these products support you as you start your journey with these tools.  Some of these tools will require you to have familiarity with connecting to 3rd party data sources that host your website databases.  We call them data integrations and this will require an additional investment of time on your part to learn.  \n\nThat's it for now but if you read this far thank you for your attention!\n\nWe appreciate everyone who's working hard to bring more people into these spaces and look forward to helping!\n\nIf there is anything you think you'd like to build or need help with then please let us know on build@shinyobjects.gg.\n\nShiny Object SC\n\n[Collaborator Tips #001](split://0xfa9637ced7EADaD462A4A57ccF9cB7CC3Bd67128?network=mainnet)", "timestamp": 1627575522, "digest": "rw7-SaSszEVHtoOFW9T9d8KdxZeq1CTRkhYmDxEVKDw", "contributor": "0x54681ac94D4e3C8F58F54B576B654DC2D1950ae0"}
{"id": "wHiOpDFyRl9PfzJ77k5bqphUKnfdwqPKweqrxKF_Bxc", "title": "How to Set Up a Student Org DAO", "body": "\n## Should I be doing this?\n\nBlockchain@Columbia decided to launch [Lion DAO](https://blockchain.mirror.xyz/d2pxavq9Bztp6kCzF9UjtoJEnFTY9Oks3RPkrcBUsKg) because we thought it was a great opportunity to deeply engage with our members, alumni, and web3 community in a crypto native way. Additionally, due to inadequate funding from the university, launching a DAO and the LION token allows us to greatly expand the clubs mandate and impact we can have on the Columbia, New York, and broader crypto ecosystems more generally. \n\n## Steps\n\n1. **Select a name for the DAO and Logo** \n    1. We chose to use our school mascot the [Columbia lion](https://www.college.columbia.edu/alumni/item/alumni-dedicate-new-scholars-lion-statue-campus) as our name and the lion emoji as our logo. We deliberately chose the mascot (or something representative of your region) as the name to still maintain the association with Blockchain@Columbia, but also give us enough space from the university to maximize the DAO's flexibility. The lion emoji was chosen for its simplicity, recognizability, and to pay homage to other projects with emoji logos like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Lolli](https://www.lolli.com/), etc. \n2. **Set up a [multisig](https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-a-multisignature-crypto-wallet) for your org**\n    1. We use [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) for our multisig to receive the funds from our LION token launch and to manage Lion DAO's treasury and assets. Gnosis Safe has an intuitive interface that allows you to add and remove signers and configure the number of signers needed to approve transactions. We're starting off with our president, vice-president, and advisor as signers, though this is subject to change. Using a multisig not only makes your DAO's treasury more secure, but also makes org transitions far easier as signers can be added/removed whenever leadership changes. \n3. **Get onto Mirror or use our [publication](https://blockchain.mirror.xyz/)**\n    1. While launching a crowdfund for your token can be done relatively easily with a standard Ethereum ERC-20 contract, [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz) is an elegant way to combine your launch explainer, an interface to specify your crowdfunding goals/parameters, view crowdfund progress and leaderboard, and launch custom NFTs for different contribution tiers. As it is increasingly harder to get onto Mirror by winning the weekly [$WRITE race](https://mirror.xyz/race), we're happy to let any student org use our [publication](https://blockchain.mirror.xyz/) to launch a DAO. Just Dm us your wallet, reasoning behind your DAO, and your launch plan. Larger orgs can also just enter into the weekly [$WRITE race](https://mirror.xyz/race) to create your own publication. We're happy to allocate votes to and support any orgs entering the race!  \n4. **Launch DAO**\n    1. Create an Entry on Mirror\n        1. Go to Entries on the Mirror Dashboard and click on Create Entry.\n        2. To add contributors to work on the article and appear in its byline, you must first add them as contributors to your general Mirror publication. To do this go to Settings on the dashboard, click on Contributors and add the contributors' addresses. Once they sign the invite in their wallet, you can then send them the link to your publication and they'll be able to access it. To then add contributors to the byline of your launch article, click next to the contributors' names in the Entry settings of your article.\n        3. In the article it's import to include the following to give people a general sense of what your student blockchain org does, what you will do with the funds, and how the DAO will be governed: high-level information about the org, more specific info about club activities, purpose of the DAO launch and crowdfund, use of crowdfunds and goals for the DAO, how DAO governance will work (i.e. who will be able to vote), (potential) benefits of owning one of your NFTs, and info on the board and some org alumni. This is a broad outline of what we did so of course feel free to augment. \n    2. Create Crowdfund on Mirror\n        1. Go to Crowdfunds on the Mirror dashboard and click on Create Crowdfund.\n        2. Here you can specify the token symbol, funding goal (how much you want to raise), stretch goal (max amount you want to raise), and how much of the tokens you want your org to keep. We chose to keep 30% to have a sufficient amount of LION tokens to give to new members each semester. \n        3. After specifying these crowdfund parameters, you can also choose to mint custom NFTs to give to your DAO's backers. You're able to specify how many tiers you want, the number of NFT's per tier, and the price per tier. Then all you need are high-quality PNGs for each NFT tier, a name, and a brief description. For reference, we decided to create 3 tiers—Bronze Lion, Silver Lion, and Golden Lion—and set the supply and price as 100, 0.1 ETH for bronze, 30, 1.0 ETH for silver, and 10, 3.0 ETH for golden. These numbers were deliberate. With the Bronze Lion we wanted to promote broad participation from the community with a high supply and low price. With the Silver Lion we aimed to reward our more substantial backers but still have enough supply to meet potentially high interest. Lastly, with the Golden Lion we wanted to honor our most generous backers with an exclusive and limited NFT. These numbers are just for reference and can of course be changed as you see fit.\n        4. Imbed this crowdfund into your Mirror article by clicking on your Crowdfund and copying the link towards the top of the page, make the article public, and launch your DAO!\n    3. Raise awareness and get supporters for the DAO \n        1. Although we are still doing this ourselves, it's essential to have a clear idea of how you will get buy-in and support from alumni and the broader crypto community. Some ways to start can be brainstorming and writing down alumni working in crypto or who are interested in the space, contacts with well-known people in the space, etc. On the day of launch and the week or so afterwards, it's important to remain active and engaged on social media. Cold outreach via Twitter dms and comments, Linkedin messages, and emails can be quite helpful in building an audience and getting people to participate in your DAO. \n\n    ## Additional Notes\n\n    While Blockchain@Columbia is a student-run blockchain organization associated with Columbia University, Lion DAO is a completely separate entity giving us maximal flexibility. We're also creating a separate 501(c)(3) non-profit Blockchain at Columbia to enable us to accept fiat when working with more traditional organizations and groups. \n\n    At the time of writing, we're still in the throughs of our DAO launch and getting the word out about Lion DAO. This is all experimental and we're hoping to iterate on this process and how we will run our DAO with the community. \n\n    Lastly, just to reiterate, we're happy to let any student org use our [publication](https://blockchain.mirror.xyz/) to launch a DAO for their org. Just Dm us your wallet, reasoning behind your DAO, and your launch plan.\n\n    Please read out to us on Twitter or email us at blockchain@columbia.edu with any feedback or questions. We'd love to help onboard other student blockchain orgs and support this next phase in student-run orgs!\n[Lion DAO](crowdfund://0xD8Aaa606DBA50F7615Db4EBF0E439AF062BEfEb3?version=tiered_1&network=mainnet&features=overview,editions,backers)", "timestamp": 1627577911, "digest": "FABn_1mhiOuw4zHM8QUcm0LA8qv_BZ8H4EZ7_ohVqBM", "contributor": "0xdC1F98682F4F8a5c6d54F345F448437b83f5E432"}
{"id": "sCNRZbGoVIgiiOxsLftk2EYC_X83nab6n2XFaBqL5pI", "title": "31 Ideas for Music + Crypto", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f76a9546-0925-4d2e-9a8b-b6914102b786.png?height=424&width=739)\n\nIn 2021 the world turned their eyes on crypto and what it could do for creators. It was NFT this, NFT that, and it was seemingly everywhere. This was incredibly exciting - and rightfully so - crypto, web3, blockchain, whatever you call it have implications far beyond their obvious financial utilities. \n\nIn the midst of the NFT mania in March 2021 I decided to take it upon myself to tweet about a unique crypto + music use case every day. My main goal was to illustrate the magnitude of potential this new technology offered. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ccbf073b-28c8-4468-bb93-962228918d62.png?height=390&width=1098)\n\n## **1: Payment Splits**\n\nThe first widely read proposal of blockchain solving for music payments was from [D.A. Wallach, “Bitcoin for Rockstars,”](https://www.wired.com/2014/12/bitcoin-for-rockstars/) in December, 2014. This inspired so many people and is a must read.\n\nIn 2014-15, Spotify was getting a lot of negative attention for how little streaming amounted to in revenue for recording artists and songwriters. [Taylor Swift and Adele pulled their catalogs from the service in protest.](https://t.co/h8lHt3fGJX?amp=1)\n\nThe music royalty problem was mainstream, and so it lended itself as a convenient example use case of what crypto could do. \n\n‘Blockchain’ was even mentioned in Berklee College's [“Fair Music Report,”](https://college.berklee.edu/news/fair_music_report) a must-read for anyone trying to understand payment flows in the DSP streaming era.\n\nEnter Ethereum.\n\n\"A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform\"\n\nPayment Splits was the OG music use case for Ethereum. In 2015, Imogen Heap collaborated with Consensys and released the song ‘Tiny Human,' using smart contracts to split payments between all collaborators immediately upon the point of sale.\n\nSimon de la Rouviere was on the early Ujo team and [wrote about the pilot with Imogen on the Ujo blog](https://t.co/zdd3bZ4evI?amp=1). Simon describes a programmable financial layer where licensing (and payment splits) can be done programmatically using smart contracts.\n\nThis was over 5 years ago. A lot has happened in crypto and music since then. Unfortunately, the royalty problem - getting payments to creators rightfully and fast - is still a big one.\n\n\n## **2: Rights Registry (TCR)**\n\nMusic has no authoritative place where rights information lives. Which means that searching, finding, and paying for the use of a song remains incredibly difficult.\n\nCould an on-chain registry be a solution? Read how TCRs could help👇\n\nFirst, Music rights are complex. Songs are 2 copyrights: Recording + Composition.\n\nBoth have a different sub-industry of either labels or publishers. Both of which are treated differently wrt what copyright law requires for licensing, what is owed for their use, and who is responsible for collecting payments on their behalf.\n\nSongwriting rights info is critically important to every service selling music. Yet, the full rights picture can sometimes be incomplete. Who gets paid, and how much are they owed? A lot of times, it is many people, and this information isn’t highly accessible.\n\nSo shouldn’t right info be stored in one place, accessible publicly (or to the authenticated parties)? This was attempted before and in [resulted in a (v expensive) coordination failure](https://t.co/y6kdyJdMTo?amp=1); the ‘Global Repertoire Database,” or the GRD.\n\nThe main obstacles for the GRD were the motivations for royalty collecting societies to turn over the rights info in bulk. Their job is to provide this info, match it too usage, and pay out accordingly. A single rights registry would be a threat to their business. In the wake of the GRD's failure, 'Blockchain' was even mentioned as an [alternative solution to what the GRD couldn't achieve](https://t.co/x7K02KkIjC?amp=1).\n\nEnter TCRs. First conceived by Mike Goldin at ConsenSys.\n\n[A TCR is effectively a whitelist with a dispute/resolution mechanism built in via tokens](https://t.co/7ZAXA4aMro?amp=1). \n\nIf the music publishing and recording businesses adopted this, rights info could be *incentivized* to be updated in one authoritative location.\n\nThis idea was dreamt up in 2017 by an early music+blockchain group called the Decentralized Music Foundation. The DMF never made it to the public. I’m not aware of a similar attempt to solve this problem since.\n\nGlobal Rights info, for recordings & compositions still doesn’t exist in one, publicly accessible place. \n\nTokens could provide an incentive to change that, though, and maybe then the current industry-wide coordination failure could be mitigated.\n\n## **3: Programmatic Licensing**\n\nSpotify, Apple Music, Deezer, and most DSPs do not allow artist’s to upload their music directly. \n\nThis is what distributors are for. Music distribution can theoretically be decentralized. Here's the background...\n\nIn 2005 after iTunes had taken off, independent artists wanted to get in on the action. Apple had relationships with labels, who in turn gave them catalogs, but the independents were left out.\n\nA company called TuneCore emerged and allowed anyone to upload music to have TuneCore distribute to iTunes on their behalf. This model became the de facto and carried into streaming. Soon, distributors for the majors emerged as well.\n\nLet's oversimplify. The current supply chain of music recordings looks something like this: *Label/Artist -> Distributor -> DSP*\n\nWhat if, instead of a ‘distributor,’ a ‘third-party,’ or more harshly, a ‘middleman,’ wasn’t a for profit company… but instead an open protocol with decentralized file storage and smart-contract employed usage policies for licensing? This was the vision of COALA-IP, [“a blockchain-ready, community-driven protocol for intellectual property licensing.\"](https://t.co/GUOJRksW2G?amp=1)\n\nSimon de la Rouviere, one of the COALA IP authors, [wrote about a programmatic licensing vision](https://t.co/8cyE1mwTLq?amp=1) when the artist RAC released his album using blockchain-based Ujo Music, “A global, open, decentralized, machine-readable licensing system: owned by no-one in particular, but simultaneously owned by everyone.”\n\nMusic licensing is an administratively dated process. It could be done at lower cost and at a much greater magnitude if it was easier to do. Similar to how advertisements are programmatically served across applications, music licensing could look similar in the future. Web3 has the necessary ingredients for this to be decentralized.\n\n## **4: Artist Identity**\n\nIdentity has always been a hot topic in crypto. The need for a verifiable identity matters just as much for artists as it does for anyone.\n\nTraditionally, artists haven’t had a standard digital identifier that is verifiably theirs. They get paid through their business managers, dispute rights claims through lawyers, release their music through labels, and so on and so forth.\n\nHaving a universal identifier for artists; the individual person, would be critical for security of an artist if they wanted to begin doing those above things on their own, online.\n\nThe case for authenticating an artist’s identity online is even more important in a world where we assume revenue, rights, and media assets are all going to be on-chain, lest we expect the managers, lawyers, and labels to continue managing the revenue sources for artists.\n\nEarly on, these values plagued a lot of the thinking about how music and crypto would work together. In 2016, Imogen Heap started [Mycelia](http://myceliaformusic.org) to bring awareness to the problems facing musicians and shed light on what new technology could do.\n\nBorn out of Mycelia was The Creative Passport, an identity concept for artists. This project was one of the very first music related projects exploring crypto.\n\nIn 2017, the early crypto music startup Jaak published thinking on how to approach artist identity, [calling their solution ‘META ID’](https://t.co/khXmniozoW?amp=1)\n\n“with META ID, an artist is able to aggregate their existing identities (real name, Spotify, Facebook, ISNI, IPI etc) to prove who they are and support the authenticity of the information they contribute to the network, e.g “I wrote this song”, which are referred to as claims.”\n\nMETA ID was as early as it was brilliant however and never gained widespread traction from the music business.\n\nToday, solutions for artist identity remain a void, but it can still be achieved.\n\nUsing ENS, some artists are registering their names (i.e. RAC.eth) and selling NFTs from that address. They use their verified social media to confirm that is their address and in a way that is verification.\n\nOver time, as social media platforms come and go, an artist’s ENS can remain the same and forever be linked to the NFTs it minted and sold. Someone could also even create an on-chain registry of vertical specific artists to circumvent the costs of ENS.\n\nWith crypto we are now building the relationships with artists that will last a lifetime. The listens on MySpace, follows on SoundCloud, purchases on Bandcamp, and likes on Twitter may go down whenever those platforms do, but the relationships we create on-chain, with NFTs and everything else, will always be there.\n\n> \"Blockchains, such as Ethereum, allow us to utilize a shared, public ledger to create new, flexible identity systems, independent of any specific institution controlling it for us.\"\n[*A Persistent Artistic Identity*](https://t.co/Iv2cOa5S8N?amp=1)\n\nThe missing dimension for identity four years ago was time. Now that crypto has been here, identity has emerged. Creators entering crypto now via NFTs are doing much more than taking control of selling their work - they’re taking control of their relationship with the world.\n\n## **5: Streaming Co-Op**\n\nStreaming companies are valued in the billions of dollars while artist’s receive negligible rates for their work. What if streaming companies were cooperatives?\n\nThe idea of using crypto to operate a cooperative is not new. This is effectively what DAOs are.\n\nBut ‘cooperatives’ are strictly community owned and whose governance is evenly distributed.\n\nMajor labels received Spotify equity in exchange for granting access to their catalog. When [Spotify IPO’d, the labels could realize billions of dollars in equity.](https://t.co/WKLawMrF4z?amp=1)\n\nMajor labels and Spotify were criticized about the money being made by labels and whether or not that would make it to artists. Should they have been allowed to gate-keep their catalog’s for equity, and do they owe that money to artists?\n\nCooperatives could change this. For one, there is no equity to exchange. This makes traction difficult (lacks incentives), but if a network effect is achieved, those profits are distributed evenly to the owners: artists and fans.\n\nThis is very pure take on an otherwise nuanced situation. A company called Resonate is doing this today though and unlike other DSPs, the artists and fans that use Resonate are very happy and loyal.\n\n## **6: Publishing DAO**\n\nMusic compositions are in high demand. Look no further than the $1b+ of catalog acquisitions by [Hipgnosis Song Fund](https://t.co/QApviI7GCT?amp=1).\n\nMusic publishing has a few main revenue sources: performing rights, mechanical rights, and synch licensing. The collection of performance and mechanical royalties require administrative work. Rights mgmt, collection, disputes, and even lawsuits at times. These are the primary services of music publishers.\n\nIf songwriters continue to explore selling their rights via NFTs, a DAO could exist to purchase these rights.\n\nThis DAO could then, at cost, collect performance and mechanical royalties on behalf of these NFTs, effectively being a bridge to the legacy publishing infrastructure.\n\nIn time, as more licensing events natively happen on-chain, this publishing DAO could expand their own licensing opportunities within that context.\n\nThe members, songwriters, could explore advantageous cost structures such as flat rate vs fee based memberships. The DAO could ultimately begin providing publishing deals, giving advances the same way publishers do today, if that is deemed desirable for the members.\n\nEventually the role of a music publisher will be diminished as we used to know it. \n\nI think what will emerge are collectives of artists themselves voting on how technology will be used to serve them.\n\nA Music Publishing DAO can jumpstart that transition.\n\n## **7: Tipping**\n\nWhen RAC released his album EGO using Ujo Music he made more money on tips during the first day than he did on album sales. \n\nTipping artists is not easy to do. Few platforms offer the option. \n\nIs the NFT rush positioning crypto to be the de facto method for tipping artists?\n\n[The Chinese DSP Tencent offers tipping](https://t.co/82Y7UN9uW6?amp=1). Western music DSPs do not. This is such an obvious use case.\n\nIt seems wild that I even need to make this a use case. Giving money to a creator you appreciate is maybe the most simple use case for crypto. \n\nBut let that be perspective: for the first time ever, we have a seamless way to directly pay musicians. \n\n## **8: NFTs as Recording advance**\n\nNFTs as a record advance for angel fans. \n\nSelling NFTs for new music is happening. \nSelling NFTs for back catalogs is happening. \n\nWhat if an NFT sale could cover the costs to record new music?\n\n## **9: Per-Stream Payments**\n\nProcessing payments is often more costly than the fractions of a penny that a music stream is worth. This makes per-stream payments unreasonable. Using crypto however, that doesn't have to be true.\n\n[Connext.network has demonstrated this before with Ujo Music in 2019.](https://t.co/vW1mY6aOsv?amp=1)\n\n## **10: Usage and Reporting**\n\nReceiving usage data and analytics on how much your music was played is big business in streaming. Distributors, labels, and promoters alike typically receive this info via an API feed.\n\nIf we achieve pay-per-stream using L2 (yesterday’s use case), usage data and payment data are then all in one, verified place, reducing massive redundancies in infrastructure and workflows.\n\nThis would make data sources trustless by design.\n\n## **11: NFTs as Patronage**\n\nArt records were broken by the $69mm selling price of an NFT representing a fine art piece.\n\nThere is now a strong case that Ethereum provides the most robust solution for record-keeping.The NFTs you own will become your reputation.\n\nBefore NFTs were being widely implemented or purchased the design space was wide open. What would they be used for? What new experiences can they enable? What does issuance look like?\n\nThese were all questions then as much as they still remain today. \n\nNFTs-as-a-title to art ownership are having a moment in the sun - but we have yet to see a fraction of what NFTs will represent and do in the future.\n\n[NFTs as proof-of-patronage was an idea at Ujo in 2018.](https://t.co/9BcKTmQ4vr?amp=1)\n\nIf an artist or music group issued NFTs with all music, ticket, and merch purchases they could begin to create a profile for each of their fans. They would know how long someone has been a fan and how much they’ve spent, regardless of the platform the event occurred.\n\n## **12: Non-Transferable Token Social Profile**\n\nI talked about NFTs serving as proof pf patronage.\n\nFor things like reputation, licenses, or receipts, [a non-transferable token](https://t.co/vaeD87JCzy?amp=1) might even work better.\n\nERC1238 can be applied in many different ways. \n\nI personally am excited to see a future where tokens in wallets replace tokens and cookies in your browser.\n\n## **13: Tickets w/ Secondary Market Price Capture**\n\nTicket sales suffer from a predatory initial market that buys up inventory and re-sells at a profit.\n\nThis is fine - but it prevents the host from capturing of that secondary market revenue, which is often much greater in value. Of course, tokens can solve this, although an L1 Ethereum solution is not the most practical for the ephemeral nature of the token. \n\nThere is a long history of companies trying ‘blockchain for ticketing’. Today, for music events, [Yellow Heart](https://yh.io/) is leading the charge.\n\n## **14: Label DAO**\n\nCreate a DAO using [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/) with your friends. \n\nCollectively fund recording advances for your favorite musicians. \n\nDistribute the recordings with [Revelator](https://revelator.com/)and collect royalties on-chain through \ntheir [Artist Wallet, Original Works](original.works).\n\n## **15: Music Chart Curation w Token Rewards**\n\nThis was the idea for an application built at Ujo that incentivizes the curation of new music.\n\n*A tokenized leaderboard where users rank pieces of content against one another.*\n\nThe basic mechanism is simple: a user can propose a piece of content (a song, an article, etc.) by submitting it to the contract, which costs some tokens. Other users can upvote that content, which also costs tokens.\n\nThis creates a token pool.\n\nUsers who were earlier to upvote a given piece of content are entitled to withdraw more tokens than those who upvoted later.\n\nFor example, an early upvoter might submit a single token to a song, but might eventually be able to withdraw hundreds of tokens as a reward. A later upvoter might submit a single token, but might only be able to withdraw a fraction of that token.\n\nWhy this particular design? \n\n> The hypothesis is that, by rewarding users who were able to spot high-quality content earlier than anyone else, we will establish a leaderboard that rewards the curation of previously-unknown content more highly than well-known content.\n\nThis model is deceptively simple.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2b76bb7a-ea8a-40f5-b828-7c8140e0b274.jpeg?height=2048&width=1536)\n\nTo read about the full thinking around Ujo Charts, check out the [Ujo Charts repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ujoteam/contracts-charts).\n\nThis idea is still something I want to continue exploring.\n\nI would love to talk to anyone thinking about tokenized music discovery and curation mechanisms.\n\n## 16: Bonding Curves to Price Music Purchases\n\nNFTs are making the case that ownership is valuable and that digital goods, although infinitely reproducible at no cost, are indeed valuable.\n\nA token bonding curve is a unique solution for pricing digital music.\n\nTokenized bonding-curves were conceived by [Simon de la Rouviere as a curatorial and market-making mechanic](https://t.co/Sb9ioVMwWy?amp=1).\n\nFor music, Simon details how they could work in this article, \"[Solving Price Discovery of Non-Rivalrous Goods](https://t.co/oGE98AVfzD?amp=1).\"\n\nThe idea is simple. 1 token = 1 unit (song/album,etc.).\n\nThe token can be purchased at the price it currently occupies on the curve. To receive the piece of music, the token must be redeemed. The redeemed token is then burned and the proportionate amount of capital in the contract can be withdrawn from the artist.\n\nThe result is a new set of outcomes for releasing music:\n\n1. Speculators can buy up multiple tokens hoping to profit from reselling back to the contract when the demand is greater.\n\n2. Price elasticity is determined fluidly, maximizing revenue of the music.\n\nBilly Rennekamp took this thinking a step further, and [proposed a way for bonding curves to sit on top of NFTs](https://t.co/eFYu8SJ129?amp=1). The bonding curve tokens are considered RFTs.\n\nBilly covers how this architecture could incorporate copyright. The NFT represents the IP while the RFTs can be the non-commercial rights consumers can purchase.\n\n[Euler Beats](https://eulerbeats.com/) also uses bonding curves for pricing and uses the ERC1155 standard for ‘prints.’\n\nThis is a bit different from Simon and Billy’s examples, but equally unique in approach for price discovery.\n\nToken bonding curves simultaneously solve for liquidity provision and price discovery. For this reason they are already widely implemented across DeFi & there will be many more variations of them. \n\nDon’t sleep on their application in media distribution.\n\n## **17: NFT-as-a-License**\n\nPossession of an NFT would be better communicated in copyright circles as possession of a license.\n\nUsing a token as a license would reduce archaic inefficiencies for music licensing. This would not only save money but also expand the market as well. Enforcement is automated, scarcity can be induced, transfers can be fluid, and secondary market can be captured.\n\nFor an analog example, Dotta License is a solution for NFTs as software license. [Worth checking out the repo](https://t.co/LzZrsQW51P?amp=1).\n\n## **18: Non-Copyright Record Deals**\n\nRecord deals are an advance payment in exchange for the recording copyright.\n\nIn a future when revenue is on-chain this won’t be the case.\n\nAdvances will be *specific to a market for a specific time*.\n\nArtists will never need to sell their copyright again.\n\n## **19: On-Chain Licensing for Off-Chain Rights**\n\nAn NFT can represent a copyright and have associated licenses maintained as security tokens sold on a bonding curve.  \n\nI don't think it will be long before this happens either.\n\n## **20: Music Crypto Community Token**\n\nIncentivize the music industry’s exploration of crypto by rewarding those curious.\n\nGive tokens to industry individuals who have shown an interest.\n\nToken-gate a Discord and continue to distribute more widely.\n\nLearn by doing... & creating FOMO.\n\n## **21: Community Token Fan Club**\n\nArtists have fragmented communities across platforms. \n\nPlatforms are either disincentivized to share data on followers with creators or simply can’t because of data privacy laws.\n\nSocial tokens act as a new data layer for communities.\n\n## **22: Streaming Payment Advances from Usage Data**\n\nMusicians are the last to be paid when their music is streamed.\n\nSometimes payments take 3-6 months to reach their bank.\n\nDeFi has emerged as a technical solution to paying artists faster. \n\nStreaming payments are distributed slowly but the data about how many streams a song has had are shared instantly.\n\nUsing APIs on streaming data, some companies have begun offering loans with the usage of unpaid royalties as collateral.\n\nThe first company to explore this was [Paperchain](https://paperchain.io/).\n\nUsing [Centrifuge Tinlake](https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/), Paperchain collateralizes streaming usage data reports to mint stablecoins that could be provided as short-term loans. When the payment occurs, the loan is effectively paid-off.\n \nAnother company to do this is [Revelator](revelator.com). Revelator went further and developed a [non-custodial wallet where artists can request and receive payments directly](original.works).\n\nThis is an exciting use-case for music + crypto because it harmoniously exists alongside the legacy system of royalty payments yet greatly enhances it.\n\n## **23: Retroactive Airdrop of Social Tokens**\n\nIn October of 2020, $RAC was distributed to \nRAC fans. It was distributed to people who had a record of purchasing something from RAC. Retroactive distributions are an easy way to bring fans together around an artist using crypto.\n\nFor $RAC, the distribution of tokens went to RAC Patreon subscribers, Twitch subscribers, Bandcamp purchases, and addresses of purchasers of previous music releases on Ethereum.\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6694fe64-bade-42fc-9504-b15af6893cd0.jpeg?height=592&width=1006)\n\nAll of a sudden a lot of RAC fans held a token that entitled them to a Discord to get together. A lot of these people had never held any crypto, let alone used a wallet.\n\nFor artists that are releasing NFTs and looking at community/social tokens:\n\nRetroactively issuing a token to the fans that have already been there is a powerful catalyst for getting a community started.\n\n## 24: Scarce Sounds Marketplace\n\nMarketplaces exist for purchasable audio packs by famous producers. A lot of Top 40 songs are created with these audio packs.Crypto could provide a way to induce scarcity and price discovery, something that current marketplaces don’t offer.\n\n[Splice](splice.com), the biggest existing marketplace for audio packs  has been a cash cow for producers - but it pays them a flat rate regardless of how much revenue the audio pack generates.\n\nMarketplaces like Splice have proven the value of digital audio packages.\n\nHowever… what Splice and other platforms before it don’t do:\n\n1. Price audio pieces dynamically on the demand for them\n2. Limit purchases and induce scarcity\n\nOne of the most notorious pieces of audio is the Amen Break. The Amen Break, although used in thousands of films and songs, never returned any revenue to the creators.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5SaFTm2bcac\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIF you could buy the Amen Break today as an NFT it would foreseeably be the most expensive drum loop in history.\n\nIf it was sold on Splice though the artists would have only seen one payment, the initial flat rate, without capturing the value from the cultural significance.\n\nWhat if we leveraged a tokenized bonding curve to induce scarcity and price discovery for the pieces that make hits?\n\n## 25: Social Token Community Fund\n\nAs more artists launch social tokens a community-style fund could offer capital in exchange.\n\nThis would offer an alternative to exploitative label deals & allow the artist to maintain their copyright.\n\nCheckmate, legacy music industry ways.\n\n## 26: Stake Social Tokens to Earn Song NFTs\n\nSocial tokens are popular for enabling access but they will be the means for much more than that.\n\n[$MEME introduced the concept to ‘stake tokens to earn NFTS’](https://t.co/DqDIbyzjm5?amp=1)\n\nMusicians could do the same to allow their fans to unlock rare music NFTs.\n\n## 27: Market-making distribution models\n\nSelling rights at an upfront price & surrendering distribution to that new owner will become archaic. \n\nTokens-as-a-license to sell future earnings, not rights, and enable a willing-buyer / willing-seller market will become standard.\n\n## 28: Scarce music releases\n\nNFTs have created a rush for “scarce digital.” Music streaming today is a lot like a buffet - $10 a month, all you can eat. Token induced digital scarcity is an untouched design space for music.\n\nScarcity for music could apply to multiple things:\n1. Number of owners / listeners\n2. Number of plays\n3. Specific timeframe\n\nThe dominant thinking for NFTs is that information should be free.\n\nScarce access can be antithetical to this but it may prove useful for music.\n\nThe benefit of scarcity is the economics behind it.\n\nIn a music buffet, all songs are worth the same.\n\nScarcity would allow us to challenge the current economics of music.\n\nRisk: Scarcity results in limiting the reach of music\n\nPotential: Scarcity induced in a pre-market, more money would be made, curation would be a result, and music could still exist elsewhere during a wider release\n\n## 29: NFTs as Synch License\n\nNFTs w a music element to them bring to light the thorny question of what royalties are owed an to who.\n\nFor the artists and platforms selling music NFTs today - treating the NFT as a synch deal provides the most straightforward option.\n\nA synch is when an audio piece exists alongside a visual piece. \n\nBecause most copyright owners would understandably want to approve any use of a composition or master recording alongside a visual, synch’s are negotiated directly.\n\nBecause a synch license is dealt directly between the two parties there is no need for collecting societies or blanket licenses to third parties.\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/03219c5c-4a90-45d7-9e37-1013ac75b1d0.jpeg?height=749&width=1200)\n\nThis is different from an *interactive stream*, which if a platform offers, that then have to provide usage reports and pay royalties through various collecting agencies.\n\nThe artists, when it comes to streaming, cannot opt out of these third party services.\n\nWeb3 allows us to pay rights holders directly and immediately. Paying royalties to PROs and other CMOs seems so archaic in comparison but laws have not caught up yet.\n\nUntil they do, emphasizing the visual elements of your music NFT are a safe workaround.\n\n## 30: Physical goods redeemed by tokens sold on a bonding curve\n\nThis is the story of [$TAPE](https://store.zora.co/rac/tape): the most expensive cassette ever sold.\n\nSelling items by redeeming tokens is a great distribution option for limited-edition goods.\n\nThe first to do this was [$SOCKS](https://unisocks.exchange/) and then there was [$FAME](https://www.saintfame.com/).\n\nIn January of 2020, I was put in touch with Jacob Horne, the person behind $FAME.\n\nI told Jacob that I wanted to release music using the same model he sold apparel using Saint Fame. Inducing scarcity for music is hard without an app where that can be enforced, so releasing a physical good was a way to do that easily.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/992a7d38-d80d-4a79-bf17-5ebb79412f76.png?height=144&width=426)\nJacob was in.\n\nOnce [Zora](zora.co) became an option, I tapped on RAC who just happened to have an album coming out on May 8th of that year. Of course RAC was in, he was the first artist to release an album using Ethereum.\n\nThe plan was set was to release music on bonding curve.\n\nThe group decided a cassette would be the best format for this launch. The album would be available vinyl separately, and CDs or any other physical format didn’t do it for our nostalgia.\n\nLittle did we know we’d be making the most expensive cassettes in history.\n\nAfter months of hard work by the Zora team, $TAPE launched on May 11th.\n\nImmediately, $TAPE tokens started selling for hundreds of dollars. It was absurd, to say the least.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f1064d41-8d25-4e69-be24-6862dcb8e887.png?height=630&width=988)\n\nThe manufacturing of the cassettes was slowed due to the tape manufacturing plant shutting down from COVID.\n\nRedemptions for the physical tape were not even available and $TAPE prices settled around ~$250 over the summer.\n\nIn October $TAPE redemptions went live. At this point, this was after DeFi summer, as opposed to May, and there were a ton of new people in the space.\n\nThe price of $TAPE soared into the thousands.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/771983d4-7b46-4521-8e56-2b20ddaec643.png?height=998&width=1190)\n\nAs more $TAPE tokens were redeemed and people continued to purchase, the price passed $4,500.\n\n[This was the previous record for most expensive cassette tape ever sold](https://t.co/0dgCtxdA0O?amp=1).\n\nBefore long, we found ourselves in a cultural renaissance and an influx of new people were looking at novel tokens due to the NFT mania.\n\n$TAPE soared higher to over $10k...\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/95e88e44-b308-4ca4-ab1b-10436a195382.jpeg?height=825&width=1200)\n\nToday, $TAPE has settled back to a few thousand dollars, all because the nature of how the bonding curve sale + redemptions work.\n\nReleasing physical goods using this method is great for allowing speculation prior to the good being redeemed.\n\nThis solves for price discovery & capturing secondary market revenue.\n\nFor music, this could be a new way to sell all tapes, vinyl, merchandise, tickets, etc.\n\nThe success of $TAPE is owed to an awesome artist and amazing team at Zora. \n\n## 31: 1 of 1 Digital Records\n\nProof of authenticity and ownership are both important to the value of music.\n\nThese two things have lacked infrastructure to support them in a digital world. NFTs change that.\n\n[Catalog](catalog.works) is bringing authenticity and ownership back to music.\n\n> “Catalog is a space to collect, trade, and listen to one-of-one digital records — artist-certified, provably authentic works. Artists receive 100% on their initial sale, and also set a percentage fee up front that they'll receive on every resale.”\n\n\n## Make it this far? Thanks for reading!\n*Reach out to me on Twitter if you want to chat through any of the above ideas or anything else at the intersection of music and crypto.*\n[@jackspallone](https://twitter.com/JackSpallone)", "timestamp": 1627578342, "digest": "CLVl8maTxlphqKP6eZ1oQ1CJJKT1mvQk7cSflu8g_Lg", "contributor": "0xaD8717E33C719a9B407Ad6B40d0Be237845c2FbF"}
{"id": "eLCvtuUsoTvMFaw5bM1e5Wa3vLOgihrFS4SnYqsAsQw", "title": "Creating a Community-Specific Reputation Score for Mirror Users", "body": "In my [previous post on digital identity](https://ath.mirror.xyz/mDu_nGsWpjvF-KaPLADwxeAMfze3UJOtTAQi2CwPwWc), I mentioned that \"the tokenization of these graph shards could take many forms and will likely be layered upon by proof tokens.\" I believe that sharded graph identity approach requires coming up with a community-specific reputation score that measures how influential a certain person has been in expanding a specific network. While some reputation scores may be more set in terms of having to have done X or Y actions, this score captures a users reputation in the context of other users in a more fluid manner - **acting like a signal rather than a badge**. \n\nTypically in Web2, users are \"rewarded\" by an algorithm which will highlight them based on the engagement and attention they bring to the platform. Thus, their reputation score is just the number of likes or followers they have - regardless of who those vanity metrics come from. In Web3, we typically reward with tokens representing the value of the protocol or product. These tokens also carry a lot of power in the form of voting and other privileges. As such, a score that **signals not only influence but also how supportive or aligned a user is** with the rest of the community will become increasingly important over time.\n\nFor this post, we will be focusing on creating a reputation score for Mirror users (voters, writers, contributors) based on where each user sits on an interaction-based social graph across Ethereum, Twitter, and Mirror data. I chose Mirror for three reasons:\n\n1. I'm already very familiar with their community and product\n2. They have verifiable consolidation of identity on their platform (Ethereum <> Twitter), allowing me to layer social graphs together.\n3. Their product and governance are heavily user-to-user interaction focused, something most products on Ethereum don't currently have (we mostly interact with pools or marketplace protocols).\n\nSocial graphs themselves are not new, but selectively layering them will open up quite a few new doors of usability and meaningfulness. There are two main reasons for this: \n\n1. **Enabling new applications:** We can use this graph data to create a context-dependent community-specific reputation score, which is then applicable in many situations.\n2. **What the data represents:** The creation of a representational network built off of scarcity creates a social graph that proxies how users support one another. \n\n**Enabling new applications:** The way that we understand the layering affects what we do with the data. The way I see it, Ethereum is a base layer social graph that everything else is built upon. Platforms like Mirror and Twitter are *contexts* that sit on top of this base layer and shift how we see the connection of users across the space.\n\n![I don't have the design capability, but imagine this in 3D where each box is a slice across a sphere at various angles. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/41ac44d5-3e52-42a5-bcf2-d2fb22764e23.jpeg?height=794&width=1259)\n\nBecause I wanted to analyze only users of Mirror, I took just a subset of available Ethereum and Twitter data. Those who have a high community-specific reputation score could get a larger token airdrop, be delegated for roles (or more votes) in treasury management, or get preferential access to new protocol features. There are also many more such contexts like Mirror built on top of Web2 + Web3 platforms, such as NFT communities (Cryptopunks, BAYC, Blitmaps) and gaming communities (Axie Infinity, Darkforest). \n\nAs DAOs start working together more and the metaverse becomes more interconnected, we'll see more communities (and contexts) overlap. I imagine that studying how people and communities interact *within and across different contexts of the social graph* could produce mixed-community reputation scores which could be applied in quite a few different situations. For example, this score could be used for multi-token or collaborative NFT airdrops, as well as choosing leaders for partnerships and programs like [rabbithole's pathfinder initiative](https://rabbithole.gg/pathfinder). \n\n**What the data represents:** The kinds of data collected and used affect the social graph as well. Using data from $WRITE votes, funding contributions (across editions, splits, crowdfunds, and auctions), and Twitter mentions, I want to represent three buckets of scarcity (respectively): belief, capital, and attention. \n\n![Yes, technically this should be visualized as a self-referencing loop but that can come across as confusing](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b8de33dc-4db4-4543-a53d-2cb6a0213202.jpeg?height=870&width=1148)\n\nI believe that analyzing how interactions connect different people across these three buckets *gives us a proxy for how much they support each other*. I also believe that *networks of support give us a more accurate representation of communities within social graphs*. These two assumptions gave me confidence in using a concept called \"betweenness centrality\" as a primitive for a reputation score. \n\nThe selection of data representation and contexts was key to the form the social graph ultimately took. If I wanted to proxy just willingness to contribute, then I would probably create a completely create node schemas based on different kinds of products/categories of creators rather than a pure user-to-user graph. This would likely shift the shape of the social graph completely. \n\n## Using Graph Data Science to Create a Community Reputation Score: Betweenness Centrality\n\nLet's try to target and quantify the strong connection points of the social graph of race participants, writers, and contributors. I've chosen to use a concept called \"betweenness centrality\" to represent the score of each node. Betweenness centrality is calculated [using an algorithm that calculates the shortest path between all nodes for all nodes](http://www.inf.uni-konstanz.de/algo/publications/b-fabc-01.pdf)). \n\nCommunity clusters in a social graph usually look something like this:\n\n![Example social graph with community detection, where nodes represent people and lines represent different types of interactions](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2db87fc5-a4b7-44a6-b0ce-bd064d8850a5.jpeg?height=320&width=320)\n\nFor Mirror, the base social graph of who has voted for who looks like this:\n\n![Gold dots are winners, purple dots are still competing in the race. Above there are 2130 nodes pictured, where 2041 of the nodes have put in at least one vote.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7e077f8b-91f9-4191-b4fe-4c271b67dbda.jpeg?height=2732&width=2804)\n\n![Here is a zoom-in on the nucleus, color-coded by each community using the [Leiden Community Detection](https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.leiden.html?highlight=leiden#cdlib.algorithms.leiden) method. From this and the plot above, we can see there are quite a few communities but almost all the winners sit in the very middle.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d2457836-c1e5-4ce5-a07f-97e083be5415.jpeg?height=1645&width=1688)\n\nHowever, this doesn't have an outside-of-race social context yet. Let's layer in Ethereum transaction-level data - this is limited to Mirror-related transactions between participants, such as **sending a split, funding a crowdfund, and buying an edition or reserve auction.** \n\n![Pink indicates Ethereum tx, note that there are some nodes that are just an Ethereum address and don't have associated Twitter data as they aren't registered in the race.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6236ce49-4929-47e5-a13b-b2763831ffb4.jpeg?height=416&width=428)\n\nNow we'll add Twitter data too, which will link nodes based on **who has mentioned another participant** in their last 2000 tweets.\n\n![Blue now represents Twitter mentions between nodes\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6f977615-b6c9-4553-ba0d-ae8f8c48652a.jpeg?height=561&width=479)\n\nShowing the interactions (edges) in a cleaner fashion, the mix of interactions across the social graph looks like this: \n\n![Counting the number of users who have interacted with each other in each facet.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ff2b56c4-c5f0-4373-9f0b-a0ae18b5c4dd.jpeg?height=558&width=568)\n\nNow getting back to the original point, the expectation is that some of these nodes between large clusters would get a higher weighting than others since they've connected the paths across the most other nodes. \n\n![The top 300 betweenness users have been highlighted in red, we can see they start to spread fairly far out from the center of the graph. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3256b58d-2f95-4d03-9cba-d68c363242fb.jpeg?height=505&width=473)\n\nThis is called \"betweenness\" and is a factor I believe to be very important when trying to proactively grow a community. The base idea here is that the higher the \"betweenness\" factor a person has, the more likely they will lead to creating connections and branches that build up a more diverse community. There have been a few research papers that highlight the beneficial effect that nodes with high betweenness have on the [diffusion of a community](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2365952.2366010) as well as [building the resilience of a network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.3710.pdf). \n\nSome of you might be wondering why I chose betweenness centrality over something like closeness or degree centrality. Those latter two metrics highlight pure influence, and I don't think reputation in a community should be based on just those who already have that level of influence. The [Graph Algorithms](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Graph_Algorithms/z4WZDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) textbook by Neo4j puts the concept behind betweenness very well:\n\n> \"Sometimes the most important cog in the system is not the one with the most overt power or the highest status. Sometimes it’s the middlemen that connect groups or the brokers who have the most control over resources or the flow of information. Betweenness Centrality is a way of detecting the amount of influence a node has over the flow of information or resources in a graph. It is typically used to find nodes that serve as a bridge from one part of a graph to another.\"\n\n***A lot of Web2 has been about concentrated influence and echo chambers, I believe Web3 should try to enable and incentivize creating bridges as much as possible instead.*** \n\nFor anyone who wants to see the scores, check out the [sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XiX8b7KkvtfBE2KLJWv-mCPtphrQxjt1-g4wKCa4JwE/edit?usp=sharing). Note that these values have not been weighted based on data/edge type, so some users may have higher betweenness due to Twitter interactions rather than Mirror/Ethereum interactions.\n \n## Why is this Methodology Important to the Score?\n\nWe've already discussed some of the applications of this score, but the solution I used may still appear unnecessarily complex or overengineered. I think this methodology is required to provide composability while also measuring reputation in a way that is much tougher to game. \n\n**Composability:** As mentioned before, this graph is built up layer-by-layer. The data elements are all publicly available to collect, the model follows a search algorithm and is flexible to whatever nodes or edges (users or interactions) are chosen, and once the pipeline is built once it can be reused or forked for any set of tweaks. Hopefully in the future, all the available data components just sit in a user interface and this model becomes drag and drop. From there I imagine you could export scores or connect directly to something like [disperse.app](https://disperse.app) or [galaxy drops](https://galaxy.eco).  \n\n**Durability:** The problem with many scores and measures is that once they have been publicly used once, then people can start to figure out how to game the system. This is especially true for anything that is just `user <> protocol` interaction based. Creating a model that is `user <> user <> user` dependent is harder to game because the users in the current community won't necessarily reciprocate interactions with a bad actor. Actions are also compounding, so having just one interaction (or one type of interaction) will not be good enough to get a higher score). Even if they do find some way to game it, then congratulations you now have another active participant who is contributing to the community.\n\n*These two elements allow for an overall stronger reputation score mechanism, which I believe justifies the efforts it takes to get there.*\n\n## In Conclusion:\n\nI would like to continue iterating this research and possibly use this kind of score for specific use cases from protocols and communities (please reach out if interested). If you've made it this far and want to contribute to this analysis with ideas or technical expertise, I do invite you to [join ImagDAO](https://discord.gg/jEm2UgBpXu) for further work on social graph data and decentralized identity). \n\nThe next steps include more data collection, setting up a Neo4j dashboard for others to play with, and of course applying more data science algorithms. Machine learning and community detection will likely take on a bigger role in the future as we try to predict how the social graph will grow or try to target specific sub-communities. \n\nI mentioned before that this analysis was only possible because of the verifiable consolidation of identity by Mirror's platform (Ethereum <> Twitter). Continuation of this work heavily depends on an identity consolidation API as well, so anyone working in this context please connect with me as well (looking at you Ceramic and Gitcoin 👀).\n\n*The data and scripts may be shared publicly later once I refactor and figure out how to protect the privacy of users in this social graph.*\n\n*Special thanks to Ben Schecter for all his help and ideas in reviewing this post*\n\n**If you want to support more of this research, consider bidding on the auction for \"Decentralized Community\" or contributing to the split below:**\n\n[Token #4194](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=4194&auctionId=0x16debea9373883b908a8eaf60ed2648180492899ce89f6d7c77f34c6f62021fa)\n\n[Social Graph Searchers](split://0x370d93E74E0f5Aa84caeC70A36c75e489EEaf1cF?network=mainnet)\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1627580961, "digest": "aYOJc8pihb9wxI___QR9qmM5mQ4caUyQhHJIlevspjw", "contributor": "0x2Ae8c972fB2E6c00ddED8986E2dc672ED190DA06"}

She is not what she once was. She is in ruins. Destroyed and empty. Barren. \n\nOnce thriving, the world of Elektra cultivated its energy through sound — through the creative energy of music. The trees and winds and oceans depended on it.\n\nBut changes came. Ugly ones. Visions of profit and efficiency, of toiling the land for selfish ideals. Excavating everything possible. And the world that once was fell into darkness. The music leaked out of this world. And was no longer replenished by the artists who lived here. They were put to work for profit. \n\nThen came the *Great Night* — as the energy of music leaked out of the world, so too did its greenery and sun. The planet became covered in a sand-like wind, a bleak flattened land of ruins and ash. \n\n**We have arrived here in a moment of absolute urgency. There is little time left to save this planet from extinction.** \n\nIf you own a Portal Ticket and $ELEKTRA tokens, [join in now](https://elektra.camp/#/).\n\n**For those who have already started Level 2 on the Elektra Discord, [be sure to get your vote in](https://snapshot.org/#/elektradao.eth/proposal/QmTYymfZNn2o5JqsBPmzsq38ZjmvKydoFSFXG1uibAHarx) on where we should go next by Thursday July 29 at 6pm ET.** \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/58333e77-cf9c-4559-8c76-e7c28c118b28.png?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n## The Future Is Upon Us\n\n**We are in the very early days of a creative revolution.** \n\nTechnology moves art forward. The advent of photography moved painters away from portraits and into impressionist work. Recording technologies moved musicians into novel domains of performance, giving rise to entirely new genres of music. \n\nToday we are seeing technologies reshape creativity from every angle. The ability to create art digitally — be it visual or sonic — is becoming easier and less expensive by the day. A technology like TikTok is giving rise to new forms of creation, [giving remixing a whole new meaning](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/seA6j67Jc0mm8vqGe1zTuXC7O0h95XlmazSQXDlrd24). We are also just beginning to glimpse the universe of creativity that will pour out of virtual and augmented reality.\n\nAll of this fittingly coincides with the proliferation of technologies that we have packaged into the term *Web 3.0*. \n\nThe Web 3 tech stack is still in its infancy. But it is pointing to a world where we can create complex systems of coordination, attribution, monetization and ownership — while abstracting a lot of that complexity away from the end user. \n\nThis means that in time — and through a lot of experimentation and iteration — we will become a whole lot better at working with each other on highly complex and creative work. \n\nIn short, **we will get very good at building worlds together.** \n\nhttps://twitter.com/js_horne/status/1418809259442286595\n\n*Songcamp Elektra* is an early experiment to this end. Together, we are building *Elektra* — an interactive world with music at its core. Through audiovisual artwork and songs, we are telling the story of a world called *Elektra*, which depends on music for its survival. \n\n### The Elektra DAO Experiment\n\nThrough the use of NFTs and a fungible token in $ELEKTRA, **we are able to collectively monetize and own the world we are building together**. \n\nTwo weeks ago, we [launched a crowdfund](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc) here on Mirror to fund the Elektra project. Backers received both a Portal Ticket NFT and $ELEKTRA. These tokens allow them to participate in the interactive elements of the *Elektra* world — which work a lot like an escape game on Discord and the [elektra.camp](https://elektra.camp/#/) website. \n\nA 75% share of the $ELEKTRA token was retained by the project, the majority of which will go towards the camp participants working to create *Elektra*. Once *Phase 1* of the Elektra project is complete in mid-August, these tokens will be airdropped to creators based on their contributions — and the Elektra DAO will be born.\n\n**The DAO’s mission is to continue to develop and steward the artwork and intellectual property created in building *Elektra***. This framework for collective decision making will allow for a distributed group of contributors with dynamic skin in the game to have a voice on how this world continues to grow and realize value. \n\nThe power that comes from collective ownership is what will fuel the creative revolution we are now peering into. It will afford us the ability to create and inhabit the imaginative landscapes we want, and find new avenues to sustainability in our creative work. \n\nIn time, it will not be Hollywood that makes our most popular movies. We will make our own. \n\n [Log 1: Welcome to Elektra](split://0xd6C9247A551e4a8e4eDd0c3e15b6b040C3BA71e2?network=mainnet)", "timestamp": 1627586632, "digest": "HaQAd8PInTpf-I7EUzqDh03JVpwJX3oQmZzBpAZcKqo", "contributor": "0xfC4852B5e3aF65058CdfE1D1dce26946c0C1975f"}

You will have your own private bedroom, bathroom, and workspace in the [Residency Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/cabins), with access to a communal workspace, living room, dining room, and kitchen. The cabins also have a fire pit, floating pool, and 28 acres to roam around on.\n\nA Camp Counselor will be there to coordinate the logistics of your stay, including getting to the cabins from the airport, group outings, and grocery runs.\n\n**Most importantly, you’ll have one month of uninterrupted time to bring a project into the world.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/422c55ba-cf7e-4f48-a33f-f20f3aa011e5.jpg?height=2400&width=3600)\n\n## FAQs\n\n### What is Creator Cabins?\n\n[Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) is an online and IRL community committed to helping independent online creators. We operate a residency program run by a [DAO (decentralized autonomous organization)](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw).\n\nThe DAO brought together people from across the internet to fund [12 month-long residencies for creators](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ). We have an active [token-gated discord community](https://discord.gg/N6hVmFygjR) and bring people together IRL at the Creator Cabins location in the Texas Hill Country outside of Austin, TX:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710) \n\n\n\n### What are the requirements to apply?\n\nWe ask that all residents be:\n\n1. Vaccinated against COVID-19\n2. Able to attend for the entire duration of the cohort\n3. Able to focus full-time on the residency program\n\nBeyond that, the program is open to anyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, writers, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders, and more. \n\nIf you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n\n### What skills are we looking for?\n\nCreativity, collaboration, dedication, and diversity. We love the idea of bringing people from wildly different backgrounds together and seeing what happens. What will the conversation be like around the firepit? How will people end up collaborating and supporting each other?\n\n\n### How do I know I should apply?\n\nThe little voice inside of you telling you your idea is great and you can do it. Believe that voice. Channel it into a Twitter thread for a chance to spend a month working on that project you’ve been itching to build.\n\n\n### What’s included?\n\nThe residency program includes the following:\n* A free, 1-month stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) (valued at $2,800) with your own private bedroom, bathroom, and workspace\n* A 0.25 ETH stipend for food and other essentials\n* Access to a Camp Counselor to coordinate logistics of your trip\n* One month of uninterrupted time to create with a community of collaborators to support you\n* Your own $CABIN tokens and membership in the CabinDAO community\n\n\n### Can I work on other work (e.g. remote work) while I’m there?\n\nThe goal of this residency program is to unlock the time and space to work on projects you wouldn’t otherwise be able to focus on. We want to support people who will be spending most of their time focused on these projects. While we understand that people may have other commitments, if you aren’t able to dedicate a month to independent creative work, this program is probably not the right fit. We trust the members of this community to use their best judgment based on the goal of this program.\n\n\n### When will I know if I was selected?\n\nVoting will close on August 6th, at which point we will reach out on Twitter and/or via email to make sure you meet the requirements and can accept the residency.\n\n\n### Is this just for US citizens?\n\nNo, this is open to anyone who can travel to the US and will be vaccinated at the start of the program.\n\n\n### Do I have to submit on Twitter?\n\nWe would prefer applications to be submitted through Twitter so that the broader community can provide feedback. If you don't have Twitter or are not able to submit your proposal there, [you may send the DAO your proposal via this form](https://forms.gle/d53Uba5kvjtcUWGn8).", "timestamp": 1627587985, "digest": "sO5Z4YfAY3zRNsGdKUINrcRYbzLIcKFOjlN0gC2ZsFU", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

{"id": "dRhbghK9dPZ9B7lSvLWQSTM-ELkbw5SAcgdmcla3LP8", "title": "How to Win a Mirror Publication in the $Write Race", "body": "*Reader: This is a long-ass article I wrote about Mirror.* \n\n### First, what is Mirror?\nMirror is a new decentralized publishing platform that utilizes the Ethereum blockchain. Writers on Mirror have their own domain and publication with built-in Web 3 tools.\n\nThose of us who found Mirror early, including everyone reading this article in July or August 2021, but especially those like me who have already gotten over the hump and won a domain/publication, should be grateful. Mirror publishers have the instant ability, via a few clicks, to initiate crowdfunds, auctions, revenue splits, and a variety of other monetization techniques that are native to blockchains. It's possible to list the sale of a work or launch a crowdfund moments after putting the final polish on your essay or communication. \n\n## For example, I've made this post a collectible NFT. All proceeds go directly to Coin Center, an organization  that educates policymakers about the shadowy super-coders who are building Web 3. \n\nCrypto token monetization for artists is taking off, with lots of mainstream press and even a skit on *Saturday Night Live*. Yet the tools to implement those strategies for anyone who doesn't have direct access to the experts are complicated and byzantine. Mirror has organized and integrated all the tools, patches and protocols necessary, and stuck them under the hood where they belong. As a result, monetizing one's writing/art or raising funds for a project is as easy as posting vacation pictures on Facebook.  \n\nSo, in sum, Mirror is positioned to service one of the hottest categories in crypto -- content creation. The only catch is, you currently have to win the $Write Race to earn a seat at the table. \n\n### What is the $Write Race?\nEach Wednesday between Noon and 2PM PST, writers and representatives for a multitude of projects and initiatives compete for a spot on Mirror by connecting their crypto wallets to  [Mirror $Write Race](https://mirror.xyz/race).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/viamirror/status/1420459318655258633?s=20\n\nContestants submit a brief blurb describing what they want to write about and/or what they want to accomplish. Then voters, literally anyone who also connects their wallet to the site, cast their ballots. They get ten votes. Each week when they connect, they receive ten more votes. The top ten vote getters each week win. In addition to securing their own domain/publication and access to the full suite of Mirror tools, they receive 1000 votes, and an additional ten each week.  \n\n### My experience\nI won the race two weeks ago, so I have knowledge of the process and some recommendations I'll share below. I'm only explaining one corner of this world: my own experience and takeaways from my own research over the past couple of months. I could be missing a major point. Also, Mirror, like everything in crypto, is being iterated in real time. **I'm certain that a year from now the platform and its onboarding process will be very different.** In other words, like everything in crypto, this article may have a short shelf-life. I only propose to cover one angle with authority -- my own experience and observations. \n\n### Is the process fair?\nFor a very long time my daughter didn't like games \"with winners and losers,\" which is something I still derive great joy teasing her about. The same could be said for those who have a tough time getting Mirror votes. That was me when I first heard of it and entered the race without knowing anything. I signed up, then put this tweet out as my main campaign activity. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/DanConway650/status/1381397640621920260?s=20\n\nThe tweet got ten likes, which is pretty damn good for me. That week I received exactly ten votes, all from me. I was disappointed, but didn't yet have Mirror FOMO, so I put it aside and focused on household duties and monitoring the price of ETH six to seven hours a day. \n\nThen in June I started noticing more buzz about Mirror. I did my research, and it clicked.  I have a lot of experience writing on Medium. It was my obsession before I got into crypto. Two lessons from those days were glaring. The first is that the early writers on Medium had the most followers and tons of success. Same with Twitter, of course. The first movers to the networks get a big share of the early attention and rewards. \n\nMy second revelation was about the rewards mechanism. For Medium, the rewards were claps and follows. That's pretty cool, and I coveted them for sure. But for Mirror, we are talking crypto, baby. It's not about likes and recommends, it's about sweet value. That's what Web 3 moves around its network. While I don't know how it will all play out, I'm certain that successful Mirror pubs will earn real value as opposed to just street cred on a VC-backed centralized website. \n\nI went down the Mirror rabbit hole to figure out how the selection process really worked. The process isn't \"fair.\" To win, you need to get a bunch of social token/DAO big shots to vote for you. They have 100x the votes than anyone else. But what is fair? Giving publications to the people with the most beautiful souls? Choosing a bunch of celebrities with big douchey followings to seed the platform (i.e. BitClout?). Would first come/first served be the moral approach? If that were the approach, there would be no FOMO, no buzz, no clamoring to get in. Scarcity equals value and attention, especially in crypto.\n\nThe creators of Mirror have said that the onboarding process is an experiment. They didn't/don't know exactly how it will work out. It's crypto - we are all on the vanguard. So suck it up and go with it, even if it's hard. \n\nIn my opinion, the process is solid. To get in, you basically have to do your homework, learn all about social tokens, get involved with some of the leading projects in some way, earn some cred, and then make a strong pitch for what you'd do with your Mirror pub. If you do it right, you'll not only win the race, but you'll also get an education on the whole space. And it can be achieved with elbow grease. In other words, you'll need to dive down even deeper down whatever rabbit hole led you to this article in the first place. \n\nThree types of people/projects win the $Write Race. The first two probably aren't you. The third probably is. \n\n### 1. A member of a brigade with lots of votes and influence. \nThese are the big DAOs and DeFi protocols who woke up yesterday and said \"Shit, we need a Mirror pub.\" They get all their friends to vote for them. And their friends are crypto OGs who have a lot of other friends. They all vote for the project or person, shooting it/them up the leaderboard. \n\nIt sounds daunting, but if you have an idea that's attracted some attention, it's amazing how quickly a brigade can form behind you. I was an early member of CityDAO. They decided to enter the race and won in their very first week. It goes to show there is a meritocracy to the process. Good ideas are recognized and rewarded. \n\n### 2. Those with big reputations or big followings. \nThis is a related group. It's comprised of crypto-famous or real-world famous or noteworthy people and projects. These contestants may be widely recognized as elite pros or have huge followings. I put these folks in a separate category because they win votes due to different incentives. \n\nIf Kanye entered the $Write Race, I'd vote for him. Not because I'm a member of his posse (God knows, I've tried) but because it would be good for Mirror. I'm on Mirror. I want it to grow. Kanye would bring a lot of attention and maybe he'd even auction off his next album as an audio NFT. Then the value of my piece of real estate on Mirror would be worth more. So me voting for him is a rational investment decision. Here again the interesting, awesome and maybe infuriating incentives of crypto tokenization are at play. I love it because it aligns the incentives of all Mirror domain/pub owners and creates a strong network effect that I believe makes Mirror stronger. \n\nSo if you are a big name, have a large twitter following or have impeccible credentials as a writer or someone with credible things to say, you already have a leg up. I'd definitely consider voting for you. \n\nI'm using a Kanye-level celebrity as an example to illustrate the point, obviously. A real world example is one of last week's winners, Leigh Cuen. She's a well-known former *Coindesk* writer. People probably voted for her because she's a real journalist who might lead to other established journalists joining the platform, benefitting Mirror. \n\n### 3. The average Joe or Jane. This is you. \n\nYou have 826 twitter followers and are associated with some projects that might be awesome -- but I've never heard of them. \n\n## Here is what you need to do. \n\n### Join some Discords for DAOs and social tokens.\nI'd recommend [Seed Club](https://discord.gg/eCbZhZCK), [CityDAO](https://discord.gg/fZfssB47) and [Coinvise](https://discord.com/invite/xxwUfR8hb9) because none are token-gated at the moment, and all are active. But find a DAO on a mission that resonates with you. Jump in with helpful comments, participate in coffee hours, poke around, learn something and make  friends. I did this on Seed Club and was recognized for it, which felt great and was helpful in getting votes. \n\n### Consider joining some token-gated DAOs.\nI joined [Friends with Benefits](https://discord.gg/UKrx2rSj) and [Forefront](https://discord.gg/47dfzutG). You say you don't have the funds to do so. My first reply is... really? If you got this far, I think you probably have some ETH or shitcoins that you just don't feel like parting with right now. This article has only made it to you at this point because you are pretty deep into crypto and despite recent price action, we are still in a bull market (right? right?). \n\nThat said, if you really don't have the money, this step is not required. I found FWB and FF were great to get a lay of the land and also secure votes, but it's getting complicated. More members from these groups are entering the $Write Race, which means votes are getting split. More contestants, fewer votes. Still helpful, but less so than a month ago. On their merits though, these DAOs are great and if you can afford it, you should join. The beautiful thing is, if you join a DAO and discover it isn't your cup of tea, you can always sell your tokens on Uniswap and go on your merry way. Maybe even make a profit. \n\n### Deepen your twitter feed.\nI started by following two of the kings (I am an unrepentant fan-boy of all things/people I'm into, BTW): [Jess Sloss](https://twitter.com/thattallguy) and [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa). There are others at this level for sure, but two is enough. I just watched their feeds and started researching projects and people I found interesting. Within a week I'd added about 200 new twitter follows. I now have my finger on the pulse of all things social tokens and DAOs. I've interacted with many of these strategic new twitter follows and my engagement has been noticed. I'm no longer a stranger. \n\n### Ask for votes.\nThis is where shit gets real. Apparently you are always supposed to be closing. But my first twitter DMs (yes I went there) to people I didn't know, were tenuous and lame. Then once I got over my squeamishness, I was  more confident, pithy and focused on the merits of my pitch. Some people never got back to me. Others were incredibly gracious and voted for me. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b68f4e76-a083-4fe7-91fe-a75d68fad367.jpg?height=1299&width=600)\n\nWho do you reach out to? That's easy. People who've won the race. Each week there are ten more of them. You can click on their profiles which are almost always connected to their twitter feeds. As I said, they have 100x more votes than anyone else, so focus on them. \n\nGoing forward, I'm planning to vote for candidates who have a demonstrated body of written work. I think they will write more. I don't want these early $Write Race winners to sit on their hands because they have writers block or, god forbid, because they are just collecting a Mirror domain like a shiny NFT they can flex with, but never use. So I'll be more open to  writers who've written a lot. Other voters will have their own criteria. \n\n### Craft your blurb.\nWhat would you do with your Mirror pub? Make it short and sweet. Personally, I like humble and funny, if you can pull it off. Honestly, the blurb itself doesn't have a big impact on your votes until you get into the top 30 or so on the leaderboard. At that point, someone might casually scroll down to see who to vote for and come across your entry. But they aren't scrolling through 19 screens to get to number #3521. So write a nice blurb, but don't stress about it too much. Your going to have to line up/shill for votes before the actual competition anyway.   \n\n### Care for your voters.\nYour voters believe in you and/or did you a favor. Thanking them is the right thing to do. It also increases the chance they will vote for you the following week. There is a study that shows once someone helps you, they actually feel beholden to you, not the other way around. It's a sunk cost thing and also a strange human relationship dynamic I don't have the background to explain. Now I feel like I'm recommending psy-ops, but it is what it is. It worked for me. Thank each of your voters after each round. You aren't being phony, because like me you will probably feel legitimate gratitude for their support. It's also just good manners. \n\n### Be persistent.\nContestants' votes roll over each week. This is huge. It's the law of compound interest, Mirror-style. So stick with it, and you will climb the leaderboard. Just keep entering. Because each week the top ten are removed from the competition, so you automatically move up ten spots. That's helpful for your ascent but also helpful psychologically since you can see progress. Stick with it. It might take three months. Who knows, just keep going.\n\n### Finally...\nIn my next post I'll describe an experiment/contest I've concocted to win my $Write Race votes. Stay tuned. And thanks for getting this far. \n\nFollow me on twitter [@DanConway650](https://twitter.com/DanConway650). \n", "timestamp": 1627603525, "digest": "B-oI4RKuQKeNnV2IidJknMpO4O_jcC4gLJrZSUYP53A", "contributor": "0xfbdf598dB4dBA841f40680Cd9C2D3cF618265be0"}
