Largely, that has been through the thoughtful practice of onboarding global creatives to mint their first NFTs.\n\nWe've onboarded artists from 18 countries including the Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico, Venezuela, South Africa, Nigeria, Malaysia, and more. Selected artists complete onboarding and attend a series of workshops to then receive a grant. To date, Mint Fund has received ~42 ETH from ~74 contributors, and we have distributed ~12 ETH in total to artists. With gratitude to all who have contributed to the fund, 44 NFTs have been successfully minted by artists representing a diverse range of perspectives, practices, locations, and identities.  \n\nSome of the incredibly talented artists to join Mint Fund include: 3D artist [Rimbawan Gerilya](https://zora.co/rimbawangerilya), multimedia artist [Moyosore Briggs](https://foundation.app/@TheCount), photographer [Ashmit Galav](https://foundation.app/@nft/nft-30176), designer [Ravi Vasavan](https://foundation.app/@ravi), musician [Eddington Again](https://zora.co/0xd1CcB4472872c2488856226EC47B890c167ae2F7/1790), performance artist [Niall Ashley](https://foundation.app/@niall), 3D artist [The Glad Scientist](https://foundation.app/@thegladscientist/wool-wobble-40984), designer [Gian Ferrer](https://zora.co/0x2bD5d2e3d5852AD9960638083cb7c9F493E7A597/3003), illustrator [O’Plerou](https://zora.co/oplerou), animator [Tigris Li](https://foundation.app/@tigris), concept artist [Tondji](https://foundation.app/@Tondji), and so many more.  \n\nBehind-the-scenes, our core team continues to review applications based on curation criteria prioritizing BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ creators. With care and intention, we onboard batches, host workshops, and work closely with each artist throughout the minting process. Since we onboarded [Batch 01](https://twitter.com/themintfund/status/1389900035412746242) of 35 artists in late-February, we’ve reworked our process and took new learnings with us through to our latest Batch 04. \n\nWe also want to take a moment to thank all of the contributors who have volunteered to host educational workshops with us including [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa), [Osinachi](https://twitter.com/osinachiart), [Paris Rouzati](https://twitter.com/parisrouz), [Gabrielle Micheletti](https://twitter.com/parisrouz), [Shawna X](https://twitter.com/shawnax), [Sven Eberwein](https://twitter.com/sven_eberwein), and [Bria Thomas](https://twitter.com/TheNamesBria_).   \n     \n### INITIATIVES 🍃 SOTHEBY’S & THE DIGITAL DIASPORA\n\nAs our work to support a global network of artists progresses, we’ve garnered interest from organizations to further our mission. In May, Sotheby’s auction house organized [*Natively Digital: A Curated NFT Sale.*](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/natively-digital-a-curated-nft-sale-2) As part of the lot, a percentage of the artwork sales will be donated to Mint Fund. We also had the opportunity to work with Michael Bouhanna, Deputy Director at Sotheby’s, and Ben Gentilli, founder of the Robert Alice Project, to identify an alumni of Mint Fund’s artist roster to participate in the auction. Brazilian artist, [Ikaro Cavalcante](https://twitter.com/occult3d) (occulted), created a new work for the show—*[Perennial Links](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/natively-digital-a-curated-nft-sale-2/perennial-links)*. Inclusion of work by an artist from Mint Fund gave us an important signal and glimpse into the future we are aiming to build, one where artists are able to achieve unimaginable heights by having access to minting NFTs alone. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/occult3d/status/1403227316432654336     \n\nAlong with our schedule of onboarding new creators through batches, Mint Fund was presented with the opportunity to provide support for *[The Digital Diaspora](https://foundation.app/digital-diaspora)*. Curator [Diana Sinclair](https://twitter.com/dianaesinclair) of [Towards Utopia](https://www.towardsutopia.life/) organized an exhibition of NFTs from 18 artists across the African diaspora to be released on Juneteenth. A portion of funds raised through the NFT auctions were [donated to G.L.I.T.S. and herstoryDAO](https://twitter.com/towards_utopia/status/1414704795148070912). Similar to the Sotheby’s project, Diana selected South African photographer [Ayesha Kazim](https://foundation.app/@ayeshachasm/rebirth-47730) to represent Mint Fund in the dual exhibition and auction fundraiser.                           \n\n### FUTURE 🍃\n\n*The Digital Diaspora* marked two inflection points for Mint Fund’s future: providing support for large-scale community-organized efforts, and collecting and preserving NFTs. \n\nIn the rapidly shifting and emergent space of NFTs, we are also evolving to further our mission of supporting and uplifting underrepresented creatives. We are proud to fund and support initiatives like *The Digital Diaspora* and look forward to utilizing the treasury for like-minded projects in the future. By participating in auctions and collecting *[Double Vision](https://foundation.app/@blacksneakers/double-vision-47755)* by [BLACKSNEAKERS](https://twitter.com/BLACKKSNEAKERS), we want to permanently record this moment in time and double down on our support for creators and initiatives that are pushing culture forward.  \n\nWe will continue to onboard batches, but are now opening up applications for group shows and larger-initiatives to have access to Mint Fund’s treasury. [Apply here](https://forms.gle/skWBVwjad5Fn5np99). \n\n### MINT FUND MISSION STATEMENT 🍃\n\nMint Fund is a community dedicated to uplifting, supporting, and creating the next generation of global talent through NFTs. Mint Fund's goal is to create frictionless support for cultural communities to position their creatives for artistic success, longevity and becoming influential tastemakers in their own right.\n\nBy changing the state of play, we positively impact creativity, give larger agency for cultural communities to make their best works, leave rich histories for those who come after us, and build toward a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable future.\n\n[themint.fund](themint.fund) \n[twitter.com/themintfund](twitter.com/themintfund)\n", "timestamp": 1627888382, "digest": "5Dule_9ghkywLl6LzRbTnxriuCA1dKD94-7g8hRrpnY", "contributor": "0xEB95ff72EAb9e8D8fdb545FE15587AcCF410b42E"}
{"id": "lSIx8etMMnMjPthcZDp_YgCu23gofU6z-6aSmBFJIsU", "title": "Leaving Well", "body": "I have watched countless companies and leadership teams manage transitions over the years and I have come to believe that companies and leaders should do everything they can to promote “leaving well.”\n\nWhat I mean by “leaving well” is a smooth transition of a leader out of a role/company. This typically means that a departing leader gives a company a heads up that they are planning to transition out, that news is shared broadly internally, allowing for a transparent process to find a new leader. A similar process is used to transition a leader out when a new one is needed.\n\nFor this to work, companies need to do their part to facilitate this process. This means reacting well to the news that an executive would like to move on. It can also include a financial incentive to stick around during a transition. A culture that embraces leaving well puts everyone in a better place during transitions.\n\nThere are certainly times when leaving well is not possible. If an executive is terminated for reasons that require an immediate departure, there is no way to execute a smooth transition.\n\nIt is also the case that an executive could get an offer that requires an immediate start date that they feel that they have to accept. This is exactly the kind of thing a tradition and culture of leaving well is designed to prevent. Generally speaking, it is preferable to run a process to find your next role versus accepting an offer that comes in unsolicited. If a company has a culture of leaving well, executives will feel that they have the option of running a process versus accepting an offer that comes at them.\n\nIt is best to set this culture up at the very beginning. Precedent is powerful. If people see that others have been treated well on the way out, they will be more comfortable being open and honest. If people see the opposite, then they will be more mercenary in their actions.\n\nCultures that allow for open honest transitions are better places to work and easier companies to manage. Nobody likes a fire drill. Sometimes you have no choice, but if your company has them all of the time, it is a tough place to be.\n", "timestamp": 1627904546, "digest": "m8H7lc56YhGH8sBKO9RwXHJ_-61IoWfmU9aoMjExF-k", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}
{"id": "GH38dM-2v8b3SymKgHSI1y3vnNJU6_dg2EW4n_42xM4", "title": "How to DAO 101: Choosing a Tech Stack for CabinDAO\n", "body": "**Author:** rafa0.eth | **Illustrator:** melshields.eth\n\n*Welcome to the first deep dive on how we are building CabinDAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization focused on empowering independent online creators. If you aren’t familiar with the term DAO, take a look at [this excellent article first.](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q)*\n\n*CabinDAO operates the Creator Cabins residency. [The next cohort will run from August 23rd - September 19th and applications are open through today (August 2nd)!](https://creators.mirror.xyz/)*\n\n*We always love feedback from the community, whether or not you're a $CABIN hodler. Find us on twitter @creatorcabins or [join our token-gated Discord server](https://discord.gg/N6hVmFygjR).*\n\n--------\n\nThe toolkit available for DAOs is expanding rapidly and it can be overwhelming to determine where to start. As a first stop, we recommend defining the phases of your organization’s work. We had 4 initial phases of work when starting on CabinDAO:\n\n**Phase 1:** Recruiting the community\n**Phase 2:** Securing initial funds\n**Phase 3:** Communicating with members\n**Phase 4:** Delivering the first objective\n\nDuring each phase, you can use a combination of different web2 and web3 applications. At CabinDAO we used the following tech stack:\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bd648e74-cfd4-4dbe-8ea3-6044bdb83360.png?height=1804&width=1760)\n\nThis technology stack was used to drive engagement, then to convert engagement into investment and action:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1dffab9-0067-4ba2-be10-ec31236704dd.png?height=1643&width=1760)\n\nLet’s dive into each phase and talk through each of the tools.\n\n### **PHASE 1: Recruit the Community**\n\nFunding the organization and creating an engaged community requires broad reach to the right audience. We recommend doing this by clearly defining (and publishing!) your narrative, story, and mission in public and at the right time.\n\nDuring this initial phase, we spent some time creating a following on Twitter and then published a launch article through the blogging platform Mirror. At its core, Mirror is a publishing platform like Substack or Medium but built with Ethereum. In short, you can “blog on the blockchain”. Unlike other publishing sites, Mirror is a crypto-native solution and combines basic publishing with digital collectible sales, crowdfunds, auctions, splits, and tiered funding (editions). \n\nHaving this combined technology was an advantage. It allows publishers to have a single location where the audience could read their content and contribute immediately (read more in Phase 2: Securing Initial Funds). Not anyone can use Mirror. If you’d like to use the platform, you have to be selected in the top 10 of their $WRITE Race, which requires current Mirror members to vote for you. \n\nOur launch article focused on a broader important theme highlighted by the crypto newsletter [1729](https://1729.com/location) earlier that month. The article [“Tech stack for decentralized cities”](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4), achieved good traction and was even promoted by the 1729 newsletter. Here’s a snippet of the article:\n\n> [We are experimenting with this (Decentralized Cities) at Creator Cabins by launching CabinDAO, a token-based governance structure for funding and awarding creator residencies at our cabins. Stay tuned for our $CABIN crowdfund on Mirror later this week!](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4)\n\n**Community Recruitment Toolkit**\n\nMirror: [https://mirror.xyz/](https://mirror.xyz/)\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/](https://twitter.com/)\n\n\n### **PHASE 2: Securing initial funds**\n\nOnce the narrative was out in public, it was time to gather the funds to support the mission. To raise the funds we needed to complete 2 steps:\n\n1. Set up the organization’s treasury infrastructure (the “crypto bank account”)\n2. Distribute the membership social tokens via a crowdfund campaign\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with NFTs, membership tokens, and social tokens, [you should read more about them here.](https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d)\n\nWe chose [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) as our crypto-native treasury platform. Gnosis provided two critical features: The ability to have each distribution of funds approved by multiple team members (a.k.a. Multi-signature), and a central location to preserve a mixture of funds: Ether and the social token.\n\nOne common misconception is that DAOs are purely flat hierarchical organizations. This usually isn’t the case. The founders or a few selected individuals are chosen or elected as guardians of the treasury. Over time, DAOs can progressively decentralize into more truly trustless structures.\n\nIn our case, CabinDAO assigned 3 executive signatories to the Gnosis Safe account, with a requirement that 2 out of 3 signatories were required for any fund transaction. Each signatory had an individual wallet ([Metamask](https://metamask.io/)) used to confirm the transaction.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/16f17219-0b5f-4293-a10d-501e406555db.jpeg?height=864&width=2324)\n\nOnce the treasury account was in place, we bought an [ENS domain](https://app.ens.domains/name/cabindao.eth) and used [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) to complete the [crowdfund campaign](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ). The crowdfund was promoted on Twitter and directly to the audience that had demonstrated interest from the launch article. Maintaining momentum was critical here - the crowdfund was published two days after the launch article to take advantage of the audience engagement.\n\n[Initial Crowdfund Link](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ)\n\n> [ We want to bring more people out to the cabins to help answer the question, so we're starting a creator residency program. It's an experiment in universal creator income, tech stacks for decentralized cities, and the physical manifestation of DAOs.](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ)\n\nFor any crowdfund, you will need to make specific choices related to the [token supply](https://adrienbe.medium.com/token-supply-101-fundamentals-of-token-supply-and-monetary-policy-a20cc761f6ec). We recommend talking through these questions with your founders:\n\n1. What will be the total initial supply?\n2. Will it be fixed? (e.g. will future token creation be restricted)\n3. What will be the anchor exchange rate with Ethereum?\n4. How much of the supply will be reserved for the DAO treasury?\n\nAfter reviewing these questions, make sure to check how much flexibility you need from the crowdfunding technology. For CabinDAO we used default Mirror settings: the initial crowdfund participants would receive 1000 $CABIN per 1 ETH, with a fixed total supply. We also chose to allocate 50% of the fund to the CabinDAO treasury. The supply allocated to the treasury would be used to:\n\n1. Reward members for ongoing work and activities\n2. Enter in inter-DAO partnerships by exchanging tokens\n3. Potentially conduct a second crowdfund\n4. Provide liquidity for the secondary token market if needed (e.g. via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/))\n\nOnce the crowdfund was complete, we also airdropped a portion of tokens to earlier supporters of the project prior to its creation. This is important, since many early supporters may be investing time, energy, and resources prior to the DAOs conception.\n\n**Funding Toolkit**\n\nMetamask: [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)\n\nGnosis Safe: [https://gnosis-safe.io/](https://gnosis-safe.io/)\n\nMirror: [https://mirror.xyz/](https://mirror.xyz/)\n\nENS Domain: [https://app.ens.domains/](https://app.ens.domains/)\n\n\n### **PHASE 3: Communication with members**\n\nThe crowdfund was a success: We were able to secure funds for 3 cohorts of creators! Next, we needed to create an environment where members could work together. As with most DAOs, we chose to use [Discord](https://discord.com/), and installed [Collab-Land](https://collab.land/) as an authentication gateway.\n\n[Collab-Land](https://collab.land/) is particularly helpful: Once you add the bot to your Discord server, the application will assign roles to the members. Depending on their token (e.g. in our case they would need to have $CABIN tokens) they can join the DAOs’ private communication channels.\n\nFor ongoing collaborative work (e.g. writing draft proposals), we created a [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) environment dedicated to the DAO, although most of the time we also used Google Docs.\n\n\n**Collaboration Toolkit**\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.com/](https://discord.com/)\n\nCollab-Land: [https://collab.land/](https://collab.land/)\n\nRoam: [https://roamresearch.com](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/CabinDAO)\n\n\n### **PHASE 4: Delivering the first mission**\n\nOnce members joined the community, we had to deliver the initial mission. This consisted of:\n\n1. Finalizing the first proposal (allocating funds to the Creator Cabins Grant program) \n2. Approve the proposal \n\nIn DAO-speak, this process is called governance. Governance activities are foundational to every DAO: the ability to pitch, finalize, and then take proposals to a community vote.\n\nOur first proposal, after being edited in Google Docs, was [published on Mirror](https://creators.mirror.xyz/eS6lYIBycHEZmtGpRGwA9lCb3Y_8G4pddHWSKtmWP_I) and shared via Discord with the community members. The [initial proposal was approved via Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth/proposal/QmY6cRpsXfpuxvAKpxbgU8SdYtUaaVXHwAWqf4dPi2ADRM), which doesn’t require[ gas fees](https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/what-is-a-gas-fee-on-ethereum/#:~:text=Gas%20in%20crypto%20refers%20to,for%20gas%20when%20executing%20transactions.) because it’s an off-chain application, making sure your funds don’t get spent on basic governance activities. [You can read more about Snapshot in this article by Decrypt.](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-snapshot-the-decentralized-voting-system)\n\nWe encountered the first big challenge during this initial vote: How do we mobilize the community for mission-critical activities like voting?\n\nOf the ~100 $CABIN members, 15 members voted. As [zakku (@fifthworldzach)](https://twitter.com/fifthworldzach/status/1418286755728420866?s=21) mentioned last week, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Participation will often be driven by a selected team, the key here is to ensure the most involved also have the most voice, especially with big milestone votes. If you’re interested in learning more about community design, I’d recommend reading [The Art of Community by Charles Vogl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28762683-the-art-of-community).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/fifthworldzach/status/1418286755728420866\n\nThe voting for the first proposal was fairly simple: a Yes / No vote on the allocation of funds. However, in some cases, such as our second proposal to select the [Creator Cabin cohort participants](https://creators.mirror.xyz/L7hCFAnV9-knieb8AM6z5J7ITgVv0ZUCAXPOB0Y5iWs), more complex voting might be required.\n\n[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth/proposal/QmY6cRpsXfpuxvAKpxbgU8SdYtUaaVXHwAWqf4dPi2ADRM) allows you to set-up different types of voting processes like: [approval, quadratic, rank choice, or weighted](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types). Moving forward, CabinDAO proposals will start at the pitch stage and encourage community members to debate and shape the direction of the organization. We created a channel dedicated to idea generation in Discord so that anyone with the $CABIN token can provide input here.\n\nAny idea that generates enough interest (at least 4-5 supporters) would then be taken to the finalization phase: Proposal drafts would be created in Roam or Google Docs, and finally published (permanently!) in [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/).\n\n**Delivery Toolkit**\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.com/](https://discord.com/)\n\nRoam: [https://roamresearch.com](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/CabinDAO)\n\nMirror: [https://mirror.xyz/](https://mirror.xyz/)\n\nSnapshot: [https://snapshot.org/](https://snapshot.org/#/)\n\n\n## **Some Gaps and Challenges**\n\nAlthough there are many tools available for DAOs, there's still a lot of room for growth. Throughout our work, we’ve encountered four main areas of opportunities:\n\n1. How do we reliably and effectively community and mobilize the DAO membership?\n2. How do we get work done collaboratively?\n3. How do we broaden our reach and connect with more people interested in our mission?\n4. How do we support delegation of votes (if needed) in the future?\n\nStay tuned - we will look to dive into each of these in the coming months and will share everything that we learn.

The cabins also have a fire pit, floating pool, and 28 acres to roam around on.\n\nA Camp Counselor will be there to coordinate the logistics of your stay, including getting to the cabins from the airport, group outings, and grocery runs.\n\n**Most importantly, you’ll have one month of uninterrupted time to bring a project into the world.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/422c55ba-cf7e-4f48-a33f-f20f3aa011e5.jpg?height=2400&width=3600)\n\n## FAQs\n\n### What is Creator Cabins?\n\n[Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) is an online and IRL community committed to helping independent online creators. We operate a residency program run by a [DAO (decentralized autonomous organization)](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw).\n\nThe DAO brought together people from across the internet to fund [12 month-long residencies for creators](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ). We have an active [token-gated discord community](https://discord.gg/N6hVmFygjR) and bring people together IRL at the Creator Cabins location in the Texas Hill Country outside of Austin, TX:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710) \n\n\n\n### What are the requirements to apply?\n\nWe ask that all residents be:\n\n1. Vaccinated against COVID-19\n2. Able to attend for the entire duration of the cohort\n3. Able to focus full-time on the residency program\n\nBeyond that, the program is open to anyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, writers, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders, and more. \n\nIf you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n\n### What skills are we looking for?\n\nCreativity, collaboration, dedication, and diversity. We love the idea of bringing people from wildly different backgrounds together and seeing what happens. What will the conversation be like around the firepit? How will people end up collaborating and supporting each other?\n\n\n### How do I know I should apply?\n\nThe little voice inside of you telling you your idea is great and you can do it. Believe that voice. Channel it into a Twitter thread for a chance to spend a month working on that project you’ve been itching to build.\n\n\n### What’s included?\n\nThe residency program includes the following:\n* A free, 1-month stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) (valued at $2,800) with your own private bedroom, bathroom, and workspace\n* A 0.25 ETH stipend for food and other essentials\n* Access to a Camp Counselor to coordinate logistics of your trip\n* One month of uninterrupted time to create with a community of collaborators to support you\n* Your own $CABIN tokens and membership in the CabinDAO community\n\n\n### Can I work on other work (e.g. remote work) while I’m there?\n\nThe goal of this residency program is to unlock the time and space to work on projects you wouldn’t otherwise be able to focus on. We want to support people who will be spending most of their time focused on these projects. While we understand that people may have other commitments, if you aren’t able to dedicate a month to independent creative work, this program is probably not the right fit. We trust the members of this community to use their best judgment based on the goal of this program.\n\n\n### When will I know if I was selected?\n\nVoting will close on August 6th, at which point we will reach out on Twitter and/or via email to make sure you meet the requirements and can accept the residency.\n\n\n### Is this just for US citizens?\n\nNo, this is open to anyone who can travel to the US and will be vaccinated at the start of the program.\n\n\n### Do I have to submit on Twitter?\n\nWe would prefer applications to be submitted through Twitter so that the broader community can provide feedback. If you don't have Twitter or are not able to submit your proposal there, [you may send the DAO your proposal via this form](https://forms.gle/d53Uba5kvjtcUWGn8).", "timestamp": 1627919164, "digest": "sO5Z4YfAY3zRNsGdKUINrcRYbzLIcKFOjlN0gC2ZsFU", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}
{"id": "BfN01uingiDX7uRBlsh45psAZ2ORCm3kv-cJJsD7ynY", "title": "How to DAO 101: Choosing a Tech Stack for CabinDAO\n", "body": "**Author:** rafa0.eth | **Illustrator:** melshields.eth\n\n*Welcome to the first deep dive on how we are building CabinDAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization focused on empowering independent online creators. If you aren’t familiar with the term DAO, take a look at [this excellent article first.](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q)*\n\n*CabinDAO operates the Creator Cabins residency. [The next cohort will run from August 23rd - September 19th and applications are open through today (August 2nd)!](https://creators.mirror.xyz/)*\n\n*We always love feedback from the community, whether or not you're a $CABIN hodler. Find us on twitter @creatorcabins or [join our token-gated Discord server](https://discord.gg/N6hVmFygjR).*\n\n--------\n\nThe toolkit available for DAOs is expanding rapidly and it can be overwhelming to determine where to start. As a first stop, we recommend defining the phases of your organization’s work. We had 4 initial phases of work when starting on CabinDAO:\n\n**Phase 1:** Recruiting the community\n**Phase 2:** Securing initial funds\n**Phase 3:** Communicating with members\n**Phase 4:** Delivering the first objective\n\nDuring each phase, you can use a combination of different web2 and web3 applications. At CabinDAO we used the following tech stack:\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bd648e74-cfd4-4dbe-8ea3-6044bdb83360.png?height=1804&width=1760)\n\nThis technology stack was used to drive engagement, then to convert engagement into investment and action:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1dffab9-0067-4ba2-be10-ec31236704dd.png?height=1643&width=1760)\n\nLet’s dive into each phase and talk through each of the tools.\n\n### **PHASE 1: Recruit the Community**\n\nFunding the organization and creating an engaged community requires broad reach to the right audience. We recommend doing this by clearly defining (and publishing!) your narrative, story, and mission in public and at the right time.\n\nDuring this initial phase, we spent some time creating a following on Twitter and then published a launch article through the blogging platform Mirror. At its core, Mirror is a publishing platform like Substack or Medium but built with Ethereum. In short, you can “blog on the blockchain”. Unlike other publishing sites, Mirror is a crypto-native solution and combines basic publishing with digital collectible sales, crowdfunds, auctions, splits, and tiered funding (editions). \n\nHaving this combined technology was an advantage. It allows publishers to have a single location where the audience could read their content and contribute immediately (read more in Phase 2: Securing Initial Funds). Not anyone can use Mirror. If you’d like to use the platform, you have to be selected in the top 10 of their $WRITE Race, which requires current Mirror members to vote for you. \n\nOur launch article focused on a broader important theme highlighted by the crypto newsletter [1729](https://1729.com/location) earlier that month. The article [“Tech stack for decentralized cities”](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4), achieved good traction and was even promoted by the 1729 newsletter. Here’s a snippet of the article:\n\n> [We are experimenting with this (Decentralized Cities) at Creator Cabins by launching CabinDAO, a token-based governance structure for funding and awarding creator residencies at our cabins. Stay tuned for our $CABIN crowdfund on Mirror later this week!](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4)\n\n**Community Recruitment Toolkit**\n\nMirror: [https://mirror.xyz/](https://mirror.xyz/)\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/](https://twitter.com/)\n\n\n### **PHASE 2: Securing initial funds**\n\nOnce the narrative was out in public, it was time to gather the funds to support the mission. To raise the funds we needed to complete 2 steps:\n\n1. Set up the organization’s treasury infrastructure (the “crypto bank account”)\n2. Distribute the membership social tokens via a crowdfund campaign\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with NFTs, membership tokens, and social tokens, [you should read more about them here.](https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d)\n\nWe chose [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) as our crypto-native treasury platform. Gnosis provided two critical features: The ability to have each distribution of funds approved by multiple team members (a.k.a. Multi-signature), and a central location to preserve a mixture of funds: Ether and the social token.\n\nOne common misconception is that DAOs are purely flat hierarchical organizations. This usually isn’t the case. The founders or a few selected individuals are chosen or elected as guardians of the treasury. Over time, DAOs can progressively decentralize into more truly trustless structures.\n\nIn our case, CabinDAO assigned 3 executive signatories to the Gnosis Safe account, with a requirement that 2 out of 3 signatories were required for any fund transaction. Each signatory had an individual wallet ([Metamask](https://metamask.io/)) used to confirm the transaction.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/16f17219-0b5f-4293-a10d-501e406555db.jpeg?height=864&width=2324)\n\nOnce the treasury account was in place, we bought an [ENS domain](https://app.ens.domains/name/cabindao.eth) and used [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) to complete the [crowdfund campaign](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ). The crowdfund was promoted on Twitter and directly to the audience that had demonstrated interest from the launch article. Maintaining momentum was critical here - the crowdfund was published two days after the launch article to take advantage of the audience engagement.\n\n[Initial Crowdfund Link](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ)\n\n> [ We want to bring more people out to the cabins to help answer the question, so we're starting a creator residency program. It's an experiment in universal creator income, tech stacks for decentralized cities, and the physical manifestation of DAOs.](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ)\n\nFor any crowdfund, you will need to make specific choices related to the [token supply](https://adrienbe.medium.com/token-supply-101-fundamentals-of-token-supply-and-monetary-policy-a20cc761f6ec). We recommend talking through these questions with your founders:\n\n1. What will be the total initial supply?\n2. Will it be fixed? (e.g. will future token creation be restricted)\n3. What will be the anchor exchange rate with Ethereum?\n4. How much of the supply will be reserved for the DAO treasury?\n\nAfter reviewing these questions, make sure to check how much flexibility you need from the crowdfunding technology. For CabinDAO we used default Mirror settings: the initial crowdfund participants would receive 1000 $CABIN per 1 ETH, with a fixed total supply. We also chose to allocate 50% of the fund to the CabinDAO treasury. The supply allocated to the treasury would be used to:\n\n1. Reward members for ongoing work and activities\n2. Enter in inter-DAO partnerships by exchanging tokens\n3. Potentially conduct a second crowdfund\n4. Provide liquidity for the secondary token market if needed (e.g. via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/))\n\nOnce the crowdfund was complete, we also airdropped a portion of tokens to earlier supporters of the project prior to its creation. This is important, since many early supporters may be investing time, energy, and resources prior to the DAOs conception.\n\n**Funding Toolkit**\n\nMetamask: [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)\n\nGnosis Safe: [https://gnosis-safe.io/](https://gnosis-safe.io/)\n\nMirror: [https://mirror.xyz/](https://mirror.xyz/)\n\nENS Domain: [https://app.ens.domains/](https://app.ens.domains/)\n\n\n### **PHASE 3: Communication with members**\n\nThe crowdfund was a success: We were able to secure funds for 3 cohorts of creators! Next, we needed to create an environment where members could work together. As with most DAOs, we chose to use [Discord](https://discord.com/), and installed [Collab-Land](https://collab.land/) as an authentication gateway.\n\n[Collab-Land](https://collab.land/) is particularly helpful: Once you add the bot to your Discord server, the application will assign roles to the members. Depending on their token (e.g. in our case they would need to have $CABIN tokens) they can join the DAOs’ private communication channels.\n\nFor ongoing collaborative work (e.g. writing draft proposals), we created a [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) environment dedicated to the DAO, although most of the time we also used Google Docs.\n\n\n**Collaboration Toolkit**\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.com/](https://discord.com/)\n\nCollab-Land: [https://collab.land/](https://collab.land/)\n\nRoam: [https://roamresearch.com](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/CabinDAO)\n\n\n### **PHASE 4: Delivering the first mission**\n\nOnce members joined the community, we had to deliver the initial mission. This consisted of:\n\n1. Finalizing the first proposal (allocating funds to the Creator Cabins Grant program) \n2. Approve the proposal \n\nIn DAO-speak, this process is called governance. Governance activities are foundational to every DAO: the ability to pitch, finalize, and then take proposals to a community vote.\n\nOur first proposal, after being edited in Google Docs, was [published on Mirror](https://creators.mirror.xyz/eS6lYIBycHEZmtGpRGwA9lCb3Y_8G4pddHWSKtmWP_I) and shared via Discord with the community members. The [initial proposal was approved via Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth/proposal/QmY6cRpsXfpuxvAKpxbgU8SdYtUaaVXHwAWqf4dPi2ADRM), which doesn’t require[ gas fees](https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/what-is-a-gas-fee-on-ethereum/#:~:text=Gas%20in%20crypto%20refers%20to,for%20gas%20when%20executing%20transactions.) because it’s an off-chain application, making sure your funds don’t get spent on basic governance activities. [You can read more about Snapshot in this article by Decrypt.](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-snapshot-the-decentralized-voting-system)\n\nWe encountered the first big challenge during this initial vote: How do we mobilize the community for mission-critical activities like voting?\n\nOf the ~100 $CABIN members, 15 members voted. As [zakku (@fifthworldzach)](https://twitter.com/fifthworldzach/status/1418286755728420866?s=21) mentioned last week, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Participation will often be driven by a selected team, the key here is to ensure the most involved also have the most voice, especially with big milestone votes. If you’re interested in learning more about community design, I’d recommend reading [The Art of Community by Charles Vogl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28762683-the-art-of-community).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/fifthworldzach/status/1418286755728420866\n\nThe voting for the first proposal was fairly simple: a Yes / No vote on the allocation of funds. However, in some cases, such as our second proposal to select the [Creator Cabin cohort participants](https://creators.mirror.xyz/L7hCFAnV9-knieb8AM6z5J7ITgVv0ZUCAXPOB0Y5iWs), more complex voting might be required.\n\n[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth/proposal/QmY6cRpsXfpuxvAKpxbgU8SdYtUaaVXHwAWqf4dPi2ADRM) allows you to set-up different types of voting processes like: [approval, quadratic, rank choice, or weighted](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types). Moving forward, CabinDAO proposals will start at the pitch stage and encourage community members to debate and shape the direction of the organization. We created a channel dedicated to idea generation in Discord so that anyone with the $CABIN token can provide input here.\n\nAny idea that generates enough interest (at least 4-5 supporters) would then be taken to the finalization phase: Proposal drafts would be created in Roam or Google Docs, and finally published (permanently!) in [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/).\n\n**Delivery Toolkit**\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.com/](https://discord.com/)\n\nRoam: [https://roamresearch.com](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/CabinDAO)\n\nMirror: [https://mirror.xyz/](https://mirror.xyz/)\n\nSnapshot: [https://snapshot.org/](https://snapshot.org/#/)\n\n\n## **Some Gaps and Challenges**\n\nAlthough there are many tools available for DAOs, there's still a lot of room for growth. Throughout our work, we’ve encountered four main areas of opportunities:\n\n1. How do we reliably and effectively community and mobilize the DAO membership?\n2. How do we get work done collaboratively?\n3. How do we broaden our reach and connect with more people interested in our mission?\n4. How do we support delegation of votes (if needed) in the future?\n\nStay tuned - we will look to dive into each of these in the coming months and will share everything that we learn.

While there may be future prints, this edition is notable for being the inaugural print run. Please read the following information before participating:\n\n1. The crowdfund will last until **August 3rd, 16:00 UTC.**\n2. The top 100 contributors will receive physical Genesis Edition books 1-100, according to their ranking in the crowdfund leaderboard below. In addition, their copy of the book will have the final rank, eg. 1/100, inscribed on the pages 1-2, the provenance page ([see here](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/jOFMjyRtgT0KPbeWgysDp1HM4mQnlWKeQA3HQ2SJpbA)). Finally, the top 100 contributors will also receive a unique NFT featuring the the cover of the book (see below).\n3. **Contributions are final and non-refundable**, so make sure to bid strategically. Your ranking will likely change over the course of the crowdfund, and you can even be pushed out of the top 100, therefore ineligible for the physical book. If there are equally sized contributions under and over the Top 100 threshold, we will bias towards transactions sent transactions. All ETH contributions go to the project contributors, including the featured Eth2 developers.\n3. Our recommended minimum bid for a book is **.05 ETH (~$100)**. This considers the cost of production over the past 9 months / +500 hours, the effort and time put in by Eth2 contributors, the work of the artists, printing, packaging, shipping, and various other costs. \n4. Please be aware in order to receive their copy, the top 100 contributors will need to supply a **street address**. After delivery confirmation, your address will be deleted. \n5. Once you have submitted a contribution, please remember to complete the email form below. This signed message proves you participated in the crowdfund, and lets us get in touch for shipping info if you are in the top 100.\n4.

If you aren’t familiar with the term DAO, take a look at [this excellent article first.](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q)*\n\n*CabinDAO operates the Creator Cabins residency. [The next cohort will run from August 23rd - September 19th and applications are open through today (August 2nd)!](https://creators.mirror.xyz/)*\n\n*We always love feedback from the community, whether or not you're a $CABIN hodler. Find us on twitter @creatorcabins or [join our token-gated Discord server](https://discord.gg/N6hVmFygjR).*\n\n--------\n\nThe toolkit available for DAOs is expanding rapidly and it can be overwhelming to determine where to start. As a first stop, we recommend defining the phases of your organization’s work. We had 4 initial phases of work when starting on CabinDAO:\n\n**Phase 1:** Recruiting the community\n**Phase 2:** Securing initial funds\n**Phase 3:** Communicating with members\n**Phase 4:** Delivering the first objective\n\nDuring each phase, you can use a combination of different web2 and web3 applications. At CabinDAO we used the following tech stack:\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bd648e74-cfd4-4dbe-8ea3-6044bdb83360.png?height=1804&width=1760)\n\nThis technology stack was used to drive engagement, then to convert engagement into investment and action:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1dffab9-0067-4ba2-be10-ec31236704dd.png?height=1643&width=1760)\n\nLet’s dive into each phase and talk through each of the tools.\n\n### **PHASE 1: Recruit the Community**\n\nFunding the organization and creating an engaged community requires broad reach to the right audience. We recommend doing this by clearly defining (and publishing!) your narrative, story, and mission in public and at the right time.\n\nDuring this initial phase, we spent some time creating a following on Twitter and then published a launch article through the blogging platform Mirror. At its core, Mirror is a publishing platform like Substack or Medium but built with Ethereum. In short, you can “blog on the blockchain”. Unlike other publishing sites, Mirror is a crypto-native solution and combines basic publishing with digital collectible sales, crowdfunds, auctions, splits, and tiered funding (editions). \n\nHaving this combined technology was an advantage. It allows publishers to have a single location where the audience could read their content and contribute immediately (read more in Phase 2: Securing Initial Funds). Not anyone can use Mirror. If you’d like to use the platform, you have to be selected in the top 10 of their $WRITE Race, which requires current Mirror members to vote for you. \n\nOur launch article focused on a broader important theme highlighted by the crypto newsletter [1729](https://1729.com/location) earlier that month. The article [“Tech stack for decentralized cities”](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4), achieved good traction and was even promoted by the 1729 newsletter. Here’s a snippet of the article:\n\n> [We are experimenting with this (Decentralized Cities) at Creator Cabins by launching CabinDAO, a token-based governance structure for funding and awarding creator residencies at our cabins. Stay tuned for our $CABIN crowdfund on Mirror later this week!](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4)\n\n**Community Recruitment Toolkit**\n\nMirror: [https://mirror.xyz/](https://mirror.xyz/)\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/](https://twitter.com/)\n\n\n### **PHASE 2: Securing initial funds**\n\nOnce the narrative was out in public, it was time to gather the funds to support the mission. To raise the funds we needed to complete 2 steps:\n\n1. Set up the organization’s treasury infrastructure (the “crypto bank account”)\n2. Distribute the membership social tokens via a crowdfund campaign\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with NFTs, membership tokens, and social tokens, [you should read more about them here.](https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d)\n\nWe chose [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) as our crypto-native treasury platform. Gnosis provided two critical features: The ability to have each distribution of funds approved by multiple team members (a.k.a. Multi-signature), and a central location to preserve a mixture of funds: Ether and the social token.\n\nOne common misconception is that DAOs are purely flat hierarchical organizations. This usually isn’t the case. The founders or a few selected individuals are chosen or elected as guardians of the treasury. Over time, DAOs can progressively decentralize into more truly trustless structures.\n\nIn our case, CabinDAO assigned 3 executive signatories to the Gnosis Safe account, with a requirement that 2 out of 3 signatories were required for any fund transaction. Each signatory had an individual wallet ([Metamask](https://metamask.io/)) used to confirm the transaction.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/16f17219-0b5f-4293-a10d-501e406555db.jpeg?height=864&width=2324)\n\nOnce the treasury account was in place, we bought an [ENS domain](https://app.ens.domains/name/cabindao.eth) and used [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) to complete the [crowdfund campaign](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ). The crowdfund was promoted on Twitter and directly to the audience that had demonstrated interest from the launch article. Maintaining momentum was critical here - the crowdfund was published two days after the launch article to take advantage of the audience engagement.\n\n[Initial Crowdfund Link](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ)\n\n> [ We want to bring more people out to the cabins to help answer the question, so we're starting a creator residency program. It's an experiment in universal creator income, tech stacks for decentralized cities, and the physical manifestation of DAOs.](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ)\n\nFor any crowdfund, you will need to make specific choices related to the [token supply](https://adrienbe.medium.com/token-supply-101-fundamentals-of-token-supply-and-monetary-policy-a20cc761f6ec). We recommend talking through these questions with your founders:\n\n1. What will be the total initial supply?\n2. Will it be fixed? (e.g. will future token creation be restricted)\n3. What will be the anchor exchange rate with Ethereum?\n4. How much of the supply will be reserved for the DAO treasury?\n\nAfter reviewing these questions, make sure to check how much flexibility you need from the crowdfunding technology. For CabinDAO we used default Mirror settings: the initial crowdfund participants would receive 1000 $CABIN per 1 ETH, with a fixed total supply. We also chose to allocate 50% of the fund to the CabinDAO treasury. The supply allocated to the treasury would be used to:\n\n1. Reward members for ongoing work and activities\n2. Enter in inter-DAO partnerships by exchanging tokens\n3. Potentially conduct a second crowdfund\n4. Provide liquidity for the secondary token market if needed (e.g. via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/))\n\nOnce the crowdfund was complete, we also airdropped a portion of tokens to earlier supporters of the project prior to its creation. This is important, since many early supporters may be investing time, energy, and resources prior to the DAOs conception.\n\n**Funding Toolkit**\n\nMetamask: [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)\n\nGnosis Safe: [https://gnosis-safe.io/](https://gnosis-safe.io/)\n\nMirror: [https://mirror.xyz/](https://mirror.xyz/)\n\nENS Domain: [https://app.ens.domains/](https://app.ens.domains/)\n\n\n### **PHASE 3: Communication with members**\n\nThe crowdfund was a success: We were able to secure funds for 3 cohorts of creators! Next, we needed to create an environment where members could work together. As with most DAOs, we chose to use [Discord](https://discord.com/), and installed [Collab-Land](https://collab.land/) as an authentication gateway.\n\n[Collab-Land](https://collab.land/) is particularly helpful: Once you add the bot to your Discord server, the application will assign roles to the members. Depending on their token (e.g. in our case they would need to have $CABIN tokens) they can join the DAOs’ private communication channels.\n\nFor ongoing collaborative work (e.g. writing draft proposals), we created a [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) environment dedicated to the DAO, although most of the time we also used Google Docs.\n\n\n**Collaboration Toolkit**\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.com/](https://discord.com/)\n\nCollab-Land: [https://collab.land/](https://collab.land/)\n\nRoam: [https://roamresearch.com](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/CabinDAO)\n\n\n### **PHASE 4: Delivering the first mission**\n\nOnce members joined the community, we had to deliver the initial mission. This consisted of:\n\n1. Finalizing the first proposal (allocating funds to the Creator Cabins Grant program) \n2. Approve the proposal \n\nIn DAO-speak, this process is called governance. Governance activities are foundational to every DAO: the ability to pitch, finalize, and then take proposals to a community vote.\n\nOur first proposal, after being edited in Google Docs, was [published on Mirror](https://creators.mirror.xyz/eS6lYIBycHEZmtGpRGwA9lCb3Y_8G4pddHWSKtmWP_I) and shared via Discord with the community members. The [initial proposal was approved via Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth/proposal/QmY6cRpsXfpuxvAKpxbgU8SdYtUaaVXHwAWqf4dPi2ADRM), which doesn’t require[ gas fees](https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/what-is-a-gas-fee-on-ethereum/#:~:text=Gas%20in%20crypto%20refers%20to,for%20gas%20when%20executing%20transactions.) because it’s an off-chain application, making sure your funds don’t get spent on basic governance activities. [You can read more about Snapshot in this article by Decrypt.](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-snapshot-the-decentralized-voting-system)\n\nWe encountered the first big challenge during this initial vote: How do we mobilize the community for mission-critical activities like voting?\n\nOf the ~100 $CABIN members, 15 members voted. As [zakku (@fifthworldzach)](https://twitter.com/fifthworldzach/status/1418286755728420866?s=21) mentioned last week, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Participation will often be driven by a selected team, the key here is to ensure the most involved also have the most voice, especially with big milestone votes. If you’re interested in learning more about community design, I’d recommend reading [The Art of Community by Charles Vogl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28762683-the-art-of-community).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/fifthworldzach/status/1418286755728420866\n\nThe voting for the first proposal was fairly simple: a Yes / No vote on the allocation of funds. However, in some cases, such as our second proposal to select the [Creator Cabin cohort participants](https://creators.mirror.xyz/L7hCFAnV9-knieb8AM6z5J7ITgVv0ZUCAXPOB0Y5iWs), more complex voting might be required.\n\n[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth/proposal/QmY6cRpsXfpuxvAKpxbgU8SdYtUaaVXHwAWqf4dPi2ADRM) allows you to set-up different types of voting processes like: [approval, quadratic, rank choice, or weighted](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types). Moving forward, CabinDAO proposals will start at the pitch stage and encourage community members to debate and shape the direction of the organization. We created a channel dedicated to idea generation in Discord so that anyone with the $CABIN token can provide input here.\n\nAny idea that generates enough interest (at least 4-5 supporters) would then be taken to the finalization phase: Proposal drafts would be created in Roam or Google Docs, and finally published (permanently!) in [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/).\n\n**Delivery Toolkit**\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.com/](https://discord.com/)\n\nRoam: [https://roamresearch.com](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/CabinDAO)\n\nMirror: [https://mirror.xyz/](https://mirror.xyz/)\n\nSnapshot: [https://snapshot.org/](https://snapshot.org/#/)\n\n\n## **Some Gaps and Challenges**\n\nAlthough there are many tools available for DAOs, there's still a lot of room for growth. Throughout our work, we’ve encountered four main areas of opportunities:\n\n1. How do we reliably and effectively community and mobilize the DAO membership?\n2. How do we get work done collaboratively?\n3. How do we broaden our reach and connect with more people interested in our mission?\n4. How do we support delegation of votes (if needed) in the future?\n\nStay tuned - we will look to dive into each of these in the coming months and will share everything that we learn.

{"id": "JTfGxUEdT_d1-d8FBR35DRouc58b1opYguy3ntc-CAE", "title": "Data Autonomy, the Creator Economy and Web3", "body": "In the platform economy, your account, your username, your social connections: none of those belong to you. If you break the terms of service, or are merely suspected of doing so, the platform may revoke any or all of those and take away everything you've created or built (after it has reaped the benefits in terms of ad dollars from it).\n\nI understand why people may be skeptical of NFTs and smart contracts, but I feel the budding Web3 solves issues left unsolved by the Web 2.0... and the space is heating up as creator economy trends coalesce.\n\n## \"Would you consider selling the URL?\"\n\nA few years ago someone reached out to me to see if I'd be willing to part ways with my 3-letter username on a platform. I wasn't really, but was open to consider it. I also knew that if I wrote that in an email and the platform to which I had registered saw that email, they'd have cause to revoke my account.\n\nThe URL, or the part of the username in there, is not mine to sell. It's owned by the platform. My account, with all the content I had created and followers I had attained, was equally not mine to sell. Sure, it happens all the time, but with risk. \n\nThere are multiple reasons for platforms' prohibition of selling accounts or any aspects directly related to account. The reason most talked about is to prevent scams like fake followers, astroturfing or username squatting. The other reason is because these platforms depend on data monopolies to survive.\n\n## Data monopolies & walled gardens\n\nEarly in the web 2.0 days, there was this dream of open APIs, services talking to each other, people forging completely new services by leveraging APIs. It wasn't just a dream. People did so. Loads of cool hacks and apps launched this way - some survived by pivoting away from external APIs, most died. What happened?\n\nIn short, advertising happened. It seemed like the only viable business model at a time before most people were used to doing payments online. A time before modern smartphones. It doesn't feel long ago, but the internet was such a different place. When you want to make money with ads, you need eyeballs and you need data; lots of it. That means people need to spend time on your platform, so their eyes are there and their data is yours. And so is their ad revenue. External APIs got crippled.\n\nThe pandemic has accelerated the rise of the creator economy. It has made calls for fair compensation louder (see Spotify). It has made people go direct to their audience via newsletters instead of relying on Twitter or Medium. It has made people experiment with more direct forms of monetization through livestreams, virtual events, and fan communities on Patreon and OnlyFans.\n\nAnd then there's NFTs.\n\n## Your username as an NFT\n\nWe're all familiar with the headlines of NFTs being sold for millions. Let's look at the extra utility and how it matches creators' demands for more autonomy & ownership of their data and the value they generate.\n\nRecently I created a [web3 primer video](https://musicx.mirror.xyz/aFsodqVCC0JTCQ48z002Gecdkq0w9-2tGa-YqXp3BB0) to set folks up with a crypto wallet and buy their first NFT using [ENS](https://ens.domains/). ENS lets you register a legible name as an NFT, like basgras.eth, that points to your wallet address (a hash code) in a way similar to how an email address points towards a mail server or a domain name points towards a host. \n\nhttps://musicx.mirror.xyz/aFsodqVCC0JTCQ48z002Gecdkq0w9-2tGa-YqXp3BB0\n\nServices that support ENS allow people to display their .eth name as their usernames. So if someone wanted to 'buy my URL' or username on a service, I could just sell the NFT which only ever belongs to the person in whose wallet it sits.  \n\nWhat if we apply this concept of data ownership to more forms of data? We can apply it to social graphs via the community tokens someone holds in their wallet. Some of those community tokens may be specific to a small group of friends, like a group chat on Facebook or Telegram. Want to take those connections elsewhere? Just join another service and it automatically connects the holders of those tokens.\n\nWhat about other data, like your posts? I expect they'll become portable as NFTs with the media hosted through [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/). It won't be the incumbent platforms making the first step here. The autonomy and portability of NFTs will have to be created outside of them, so that they have no choice but to integrate them. That sets a new standard: \"wait, I can bring my NFTs from outside in, but I can't take my content out?\" \n\nThis tension field is emerging and will likely strand incumbents somewhere between web2 and web3. How far it goes in terms of decentralization depends on the business models that get enabled (can this become bigger than advertising?) and how effective the trends are at confronting concentrations of power. What's certain: People will expect to have more of a say over their data and they'll expect ownership over the context in which they create value, which will become normalized through [DAOs](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/06/22/blockchain-basics-how-to-start-a-dao/). \n\nFacebook wasn't MySpace's web 2.0 successor: they were both web 2.0. Facebook's web 1.0 predecessor was Geocities. The web 3 leap is larger: the successors to Spotify, Facebook and Twitter will look nothing like them, but will be able to solve the same problems & address the same needs. This time around, you'll be able to move your data out. The incentive not to do so? You'll own a part of them.\n\n#### Thanks Dame.eth for the inspo\n\nSometimes a [single sentence](https://twitter.com/jacksondame/status/1419286976277237765) can connect all the dots.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/jacksondame/status/1419286976277237765\n\n-\n***MUSIC x is a regular [newsletter](http://musicx.email/) about innovation in music, subscribed to by thousands of people in music, entertainment & tech.**\\\nFollow us on Twitter [@musicxnetwork](https://twitter.com/musicxnetwork).\nSupport us on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/musicx).*\n\n*Select previous writing:*\n\n*   *[Blockchain basics: how to start a DAO](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/06/22/blockchain-basics-how-to-start-a-dao/)*\n*   *[The Decentralized Autonomous “1,000 True Fan” Organisation](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/06/01/the-decentralized-autonomous-1000-true-fan-organisation/)*\n*   *[The community-owned rave: event organisers as DAOs](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/06/08/the-community-owned-rave-event-organisers-as-daos/)*\n\n*Photo by [benjamin lehman](https://unsplash.com/@benjaminlehman?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/hard-drive?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText).*", "timestamp": 1627972051, "digest": "9vQBJYreH45m7uZh2MyyvZsr_XL-FYGyrXjYqH-bplg", "contributor": "0xe612d9C2a9bA0Ff4403F4f7Ea87D5bE4290aC7B9"}

Some use-cases include, but are not limited to:\n\n- paying for subscriptions by the second instead of yearly/monthly\n- paying or being paid for work in a more granular way\n- receiving rewards every second for holding a particular token\n\n## Where is Superfluid?\n\nSuperfluid is currently only available on xDai and Polygon, which are EVM smart contract enabled side chains that are very similar to Ethereum. This means that you can use familiar tools like MetaMask to approve transactions. An added benefit is that the transaction fees on these networks are much lower than on Mainnet Ethereum. \n\nIn order to get assets onto these chains, you will need to use a bridge. Which you can find here:\n\n[ETH<>Polygon bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)\n[ETH<>xDai bridge](https://omni.xdaichain.com/)\n\nYou can look up walkthroughs on how to use those bridges, but in this tutorial, I will be showing you how to complete the Superfluid task which is required to earn the Asset Management Skill on RabbitHole, and that task needs to be completed on Polygon.\n\n## How to stream using Superfluid:\n\n### What you will need:\n\n1. A web3 wallet\n2. Some Matic in your wallet on Polygon network\n3. (Optional) Any other ERC20 token: if you want to stream a token other than Matic\n\nI will also assume that you are already familiar with approving transactions with your wallet software.\n\nOnce you have everything you need from the list above, we are ready to dive in.\n\n### Step 1. Go to your Superfluid Dashboard and connect your wallet\n\nYou can get to your dashboard by following this link: https://app.superfluid.finance/ and select the wallet client you would like to use. Depending on network conditions, it can take some time for the page to load. Just be patient. If it is taking more than a couple of minutes I have found it helps to switch to another network and then back to Polygon.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/72147e3b-30fc-4b8b-b318-181bd060a103.png?height=983&width=1920)\n\n### Step 2. Click the “Deposit” button at the top of the screen and a smaller window will pop up \n\nYou will first need to deposit some assets into Superfluid before you are able to open a stream.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/002d79b0-ced3-4088-bbe5-be20fc38859d.jpeg?height=984&width=1919)\n\n### Step 3. Search for and select the asset you want to deposit, enter the amount and then click “Deposit”\n\nA window will pop-up for you to approve the transaction. You can normally get a transaction through by paying just 1 gwei as the gas price. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/12cea553-61a7-4162-b554-6b547f85659a.jpeg?height=983&width=1920)\n\n### Step 4.  Click the “Send” button at the top of the screen and a smaller window will pop up \n\nNow that you have some tokens deposited, you can start a stream by clicking “Send”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/02098c41-ee09-4905-a319-ea233533aafa.jpeg?height=983&width=1920)\n\n### Step 5. Enter the Stream details.\n\nYou will need to fill in the following fields in order to start the stream:\n\nA. The destination address. Here I have cover it up so you don’t accidentally send me money ; )\nB. The asset you would like to send\nC. The amount you want to send, coupled with…\nD. The timeframe over which you wish to send it\n*The options are month, week, hour and one-off (which is the same as a regular transfer). Here I have chosen hour, which means I will send 0.0331 Matic to the destination every hour, at a rate of 0.00000919 Matic per second.*\nE. Populated for you to show you how much will be streamed per second\nF. Once all the fields are filled out the way you want them, you can click “Start Streaming”\n\n**It’s worth mentioning that the UI will not allow you to start a stream if it would consume your entire balance in under 4 hours. So you will need to make the appropriate calculations.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8ca8f4c5-1e78-42d9-87f4-56afa06e9690.jpeg?height=983&width=1920)\n\n### Step 6. Monitor your Stream\n\nOnce your stream is flowing you will see the “Current Streams” section will display the outflows (and inflows if you have any) for your account.\n\nThere will also be an estimate for when your account balance will run out. It will be important to keep an eye on this, and I’ll explain why in a second. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4cd353d7-7c6a-4212-b3cf-30e44401fa3c.jpeg?height=983&width=1920)\n\nIf you click on the stream that you just started, you will see some more details about it. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/40b3537a-c99b-4963-a423-c496a91631f0.jpeg?height=592&width=1022)\n\nBy clicking the pencil icon beside the “Estimated amount per month” value, you can adjust how much you are streaming, and over what time period. Editing this will require you to approve another transaction. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3e9415fa-d010-4f4c-ab9d-2889690cca69.jpeg?height=342&width=972)\n\nMost importantly you will notice that there is an amount held as a deposit.\n\n“This deposit is lost if you run out of funds and the stream gets closed automatically. Make sure to top up your balance or close the stream on time to get your deposit back.”\n\nIn order to close the stream you just need to click “Cancel Stream”, and approve a transaction. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/db2f33e4-45d7-4d49-98cc-44b2c672f0a0.jpeg?height=289&width=610)\n\n### Step 7. Redeem the task and claim your XP\n\nOnce you have opened the stream, you will have fulfilled the requirements for the task, and all you have to do is go and click the “Redeem” button and sign the message that pops up.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a554bcab-0c84-47d6-8256-b6e129c040d7.jpeg?height=397&width=1557)\n\n### That's it! \nYou are one step closer to completing the Asset Manager Skill on RabbitHole.

{"id": "IrO_79tIk7065c38h8ZT_lIQtQYEuA2fWbsnUcXZc2c", "title": "Tutorial: Stream Tokens with Superfluid", "body": "## What is Superfluid?\nSuperfluid is a composable DeFi primitive that allows you to Stream tokens from one address to another on a second-by-second basis. Some use-cases include, but are not limited to:\n\n- paying for subscriptions by the second instead of yearly/monthly\n- paying or being paid for work in a more granular way\n- receiving rewards every second for holding a particular token\n\n## Where is Superfluid?\n\nSuperfluid is currently only available on xDai and Polygon, which are EVM smart contract enabled side chains that are very similar to Ethereum. This means that you can use familiar tools like MetaMask to approve transactions. An added benefit is that the transaction fees on these networks are much lower than on Mainnet Ethereum. \n\nIn order to get assets onto these chains, you will need to use a bridge. Which you can find here:\n\n[ETH<>Polygon bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)\n[ETH<>xDai bridge](https://omni.xdaichain.com/)\n\nYou can look up walkthroughs on how to use those bridges, but in this tutorial, I will be showing you how to complete the Superfluid task which is required to earn the Asset Management Skill on RabbitHole, and that task needs to be completed on Polygon.\n\n## How to stream using Superfluid:\n\n### What you will need:\n\n1. A web3 wallet\n2. Some Matic in your wallet on Polygon network\n3. (Optional) Any other ERC20 token: if you want to stream a token other than Matic\n\nI will also assume that you are already familiar with approving transactions with your wallet software.\n\nOnce you have everything you need from the list above, we are ready to dive in.\n\n### Step 1.
