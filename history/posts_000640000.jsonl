Part of that mission is providing open access to best-in-class tools that artists need to thrive.\n\nToday, we're launching a Mirror crowdfund contract to create a bounty for a talented Solidity developer to implement a robust and completely permissionless version of reserve auctions for NFTs. Unlike the previous $ESSAY and $VALUE campaigns, the output of this bounty will be _written code_ instead of _written text_.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a29d398d-ed50-4d20-a804-d1c89d3138be.jpeg?height=674&width=1200)\n\n## How it Works\n\n*   The bounty crowdfund has a hard-cap of 7 ETH\n*   Backers can send ETH to the crowdfund in exchange for $BOUNTY tokens\n*   If the funding target is hit, MintFund will hire a talented Solidity developer from the Ethereum community to implement the fully open-source smart contracts\n*   The codebase will be posted on Mirror as permanent, public data and mirrored on GitHub\n*   The codebase will be minted as an NFT on the Zora protocol, representing the first digitally unique and collectible codebase\n*   The final code will be deployed on mainnet and used to auction off this NFT\n*   If the NFT is sold, ETH will accrue to $BOUNTY tokens\n*   $BOUNTY tokens can be traded like any ERC-20 token, or redeemed for underlying ETH\n*   Participants in the crowdfund will be embedded in the code base forever as the supporters who made it possible\n\n25% of **$BOUNTY** tokens will be retained by MintFund and 5% will go to the developer, the remaining 70% will be distributed to **$BOUNTY** backers.\n\n\n## The Power of Reserve Auctions\nSince the advent of NFT transactions, reserve auctions have seen significant traction as a mechanism for selling NFTs. The hype, the intrigue, and the status involved in a singular moment in time where everyone's eyes are fixed upon a particular drop provides a narrative for all the artists who have sold work. Reserve auctions become a tool to connect both artist and collector, a story for communities to rally around—news to be told to the masses. They are a spotlight and turning point of an artist's career in the cryptosphere and we want to bring it to every artist. \nReserve auctions started on SuperRare and have moved to other marketplaces such as Nifty Gateway. However, with a platform like Zora the permissionless nature of the zNFT smart contracts allows anyone to extend the bidding protocol, making it a great fit to add a reserve auction extension. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e5a9ad06-718d-4540-b869-de4fa7d74737.jpeg?height=674&width=1200)\n\n## Why?\nWe believe that building the tools for creatives to push their best works unfettered by cost, access, and exposure yields the next generation of mind bending work and an ever growing community of shared talent, spirit, and wealth. \nMintFund is dedicated to giving all communities, with emphasis to BIPOC & LGBTQIA folks, the means to take cryptomedia / NFTs by storm and move culture along with them. \nWe recognize that the key to achieving our goal of launching life-changing creative careers on the blockchain is threefold: \n1. Cover gas fees to enable access to the tools to participate in the NFT ecosystem\n2. Create tools for artists to increase their exposure and connect with collectors\n3. Build a success-based funding source to ensure MintFund can continue to sustain its work without relying on donations\n\n\n## About the Bounty / Scope of Work\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. Any owner of a Zora NFT should be able to permissionlessly kick off an auction. Kicking off an auction should not require deploying a new contract.\n2. The auction should be configurable such that its constructor accepts (at minimum) two parameters\n    1. Reserve Price (amount + currency address)\n    2. Auction Duration (ex. 24 hours)\n3. The auction should be binding, such that at the end of the Auction the highest bid is automatically accepted and the NFT is transferred to the highest bid's recipient address.\n4. Bids on the auction are made in ETH and should be locked in escrow for the duration of the auction, but automatically returned if a higher bid is made.\n5. If the Auction has not received a bid higher than the reserve price, the original owner can withdraw the NFT. Once a bid has been placed, the NFT is locked until the auction is completed.\n6. Relevant events are emitted for each of the major function calls.\n\n\n### User Story\n\n1. Alice grants permission to transfer the NFT to the auction contract\n2. Calls `createAuction` with the tokenId, reservePrice, and creator address. This transfers the NFT to the contract.\n3. Craig submits a bid below the reserve price, but it reverts\n4. Bob calls `createBid` with a bid that is higher than the reserve price, which sets the currentBid to his address and amount.’ The contract receives Bob's ETH and holds it in escrow.\n5. Craig calls `endAuction`, but it reverts because the current block time doesn't exceed the Auction's end-time\n6. Danny calls `createBid`, which replaces Bob's bid as the current bid. Bob is refunded the ETH that he sent into the contract previously.\n7. No new bids come in, and the current block time exceeds the Auction's end-time\n8. Danny calls `endAuction`, which transfers the NFT to her address. Runs a payout according to the Zora market's BidShare data to send funds to the creator.\n\n\n### High Level Implementation Ideas\n\nEach **_Auction_** is described by the following data:\n*   **tokenId**: The Zora market token ID for the NFT\n*   **duration**: The number seconds that the auction runs for after the first bid, e.g. 24 hours, which is extended with each new bid\n*   **firstBidTime**: Unix timestamp of the first bid\n*   **reservePrice**: Allow the creator to set a reserve price, below which the auction will not settle and the NFT is returned\n*   **creator**: Keep track of the creator in case we need to return the NFT.\nA single auction contract keeps track of multiple auctions, via a simple mapping of **tokenId** to **Auction.** This contract also keeps track of the current **_Bids_** for each **Auction**. Bids are mapped from tokenId to bid. A bid is composed of:\n*   Bidder\n*   Amount\nThe contract has the following functionality:\n- **createAuction**(uint tokenId, uint reservePrice, address creator)\n    - Instantiates an **Auction** using the given parameters, and transfers the NFT to the contract itself, _so that the contract controls the NFT_\n    - **createBid** (uint amount, uint tokenId) external payable\n    - Checks that amount is greater than the current bid, and greater than the reserve price\n    - Check that the msg.value == amount\n    - \"Start the clock\" and increases the duration by \n    - Refund the previous bid\n- **endAuction**(uint tokenId)\n    *   Checks that the current time is greater than the end time\n    *   Transfers the NFT to the highest bidder, if there is one and is greater-or-equal the reserve price, else transfers back to the creator\n- **cancelAuction**(uint tokenId)\n    - Can only be called by the creator\n    - Checks if there are no bids\n    - Transfers the NFT back to the creator\n\n\n## What's Next?\n\nThis initiative, if executed successfully, will not only give new rise to creatives, but create a pipeline to mint their NFTs and expose them to the greater communities that have rallied around MintFund and our growing list of contributors and partners. \n\n## About Mint Fund.\n\nMintFund is a community project created with the sole purpose to build a support network for artists interested in bringing their art into the world of[ NFTs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d)/[cryptomedia](https://cryptomedia.wtf/).\nMintFund provides artists with the funds to mint NFTs (known as[ gas costs](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/transactions/what-is-gas/)), and offers guidance, mentorship and advice for the growing community of cryptomedia artists.

While this is a problem, it makes sense. The breakthrough idea behind NFTs was that unique digital objects could be owned. So the initial set of applications were those directly involved in buying, selling, and storing. We needed marketplaces to shop and bid and wallets to pay with and hold our purchases. These are experiences that emphasize the private and personal nature of an NFT. But as with owned physical objects, this transactional aspect is only part of appreciating a possession. For any item with utility beyond immediate sustenance and safety, value is created socially. We understand its worth based on what the broader community thinks it’s worth. Right now, the community of people valuing NFTs is only the people making and buying them.  For a sense of scale, the [top 25 decentralized apps](https://dappradar.com/rankings) all together, not just those related to NFTs, probably had less than 250,000 transacting wallet/users over the last 24 hours, and nearly half of these were at Dapper’s Top Shots. For NFTs to reach their true potential, we need to build much farther-reaching consumption experiences. And to not repeat the same mistakes of our current digital era, we need these platforms to maintain a decentralized ethos.\n\nAs any asset begins to accrue greater recognition and deeper social significance, its value moves beyond being predominantly transactional and towards an expression of the owner’s identity. Its value transcends the actual product and comes to attribute worth to the owners themself. As this value is socialized, the community starts to not only associate the worth with the product but with the person too. *This is true in the physical world, where the identification with something you own is different from that of something you rent, lease, or borrow*. It is also true with NFTs. But, all of this won’t happen at scale without NFTs reaching and being adopted by the broader community.\n\nNFT creators and owners know this, of course. They want as many other people as possible to enjoy and contribute to their products and property. Owners want their possessions to be known, used, loved, and increasingly, remixed. The fact that non-owners can also consume NFT content doesn’t mean that owning them isn’t valuable. It’s the opposite. For example, if an NFT is minted for a particular moment, the more that moment is appreciated the more value the asset tied to that moment accrues. In fact, art owners have \\*always\\* benefited from public display and reproduction -- because appreciation of art/media/collectibles makes them more valuable, because widespread reproductions elevate the status of the “true” and original; and because widespread dissemination educates the market. This contributes to its culture. Reproducibility is a feature, not a bug. \n\nAs such, owners of NFTs have a vested interest in making sure that great third-party consumption experiences exist, especially if their ownership is evident and it can drive more transactions, passion, and engagement to the creator. Broader distribution will even drive new genres and creations built on top of the owned item, similar to hip-hop as a genre (a culture of remixing others’ originals) and the evolution of EDM by way of Dance music in Chicago to EDM in Europe. All of this remixing will make the originals more valuable. But this requires NFTs to be experienced in the first place. Only broad consumption will further the shift of NFTs from digital assets to cultural legacy. When we create awesome applications to share NFTs with this far broader group of people and let them consume them, and we will, the effects will be nothing short of [revolutionary](https://tals.substack.com/p/defi-creators-). \n\nUnfortunately, today, those great non-owner experiences barely exist. For art and collectible NFTs, the UX so far consists of marketplaces, social posts to promote sales, some data-driven transaction ranking sites, and crypto-wallets. We have the NFT equivalent of auction houses, media for pro art buyers, and the systems to manage transactions. All of it is geared to buyers or collectors and investors, for bidding and trading. These are not enjoyment-optimized environments. We’re missing the equivalent of museums, concert halls, theaters, and the fashion show that is just walking down the street. \n\nThe analogy should not be taken literally. Thanks to nascent ‘crypto worlds,’ there have been some admirable attempts to build three-dimensional museums and galleries. But unless you’re a real VR enthusiast, you probably haven’t been invited to or delighted by the experience. These spaces are inconvenient to navigate, oppressively skeuomorphic, and fail at the central goal of any NFT consumption app: connecting users instantly to the media they are most likely to enjoy. \n\nSo what *should* these experiences look like? Well, to start with, they probably aren’t that different from the UXes we currently use for exploring and consuming media on our phones and other screens. Whether you are visiting a site, marketplace, or chat application, NFTs should be integrated into the experience. Each application, based on its purpose, will have a different way of showcasing NFTs to consumers. If it was a player for NFT songs, it might let you listen or navigate by genre or most popular. Or like Zora.fm, just let you swipe to find stuff you liked, maybe getting algorithmically smarter about what you preferred, or letting you create an explicit interest profile. (More about that valuable and dangerous interest data later.) \n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14184519-1e8b-41b0-b486-cfa660fcee07_864x852.png)\n\nBut there are also some essential differences about the consumption of NFTs and the needs of the NFT ownership ecosystem. The first is the fact that the owners of the media asset should be recognized. By giving the owner her own place of glory on the UX, we make them an important part of the creation story. This increases the value of ownership, which increases how much an artist can charge. Where we have traditionally lionized labels and studios and by extension the oligarchy of huge corporations that own them, we can instead salute the smaller entrepreneurial collector. And perhaps not only the current owner but the *first* owner, the one who took the initial risk to invest. It makes sense to be able to see what else they own, or have owned in the past, and be able to enjoy that also. Of course, owners might not necessarily be individuals. They can be groups of fans, buying clubs and collectives, perhaps [formalized in a DAO structure](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN\\_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI). This can change the way media companies and platforms structure their relationships with both creators and consumers under the value proposition of “ownership”. In this way, a DAO’s current and past media ownership functions both as a playlist and a sort of index fund. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F030e604c-782d-4183-ab7f-9ac0e7e03b04\\_483x259.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F030e604c-782d-4183-ab7f-9ac0e7e03b04\\_483x259.png)\n\nA second difference is the importance of linking to transaction opportunities, both the opportunity to bid on or buy that asset, as well as on related assets. Someone enjoying a comedy routine-NFT might want to bid on an NFT that is a collectible-ticket to the comedian’s upcoming show. This need not interfere with a delightful consumption experience. The app can be entirely optimized for the non-owner while also providing smooth paths to buying and collecting. One intriguing idea connecting both of these differences concerns an owner’s likely desire to more prominently promote an NFT they own, not unlike a featured post in a social media context. Instead of explicitly paying the app for that promotional presence, the owner might instead ‘stake’ the NFT, contributing the resulting revenues to the app. This could be a meaningful amount. As we have seen, highly-valued NFTs generate significant economic flows. \n\nThanks to the malleable nature of the NFT standard and the unbroken relationship to a creator, the consumption experience could offer features that today’s media apps do not. A song could have creator-supplied lyrics. Visual art could reveal its underlying layers. A dance routine could include a tutorial. Works could change over time, as programmable entities responding to external stimulus or the presence of other NFTs. Assets that are part of a multi-artist collections could link to the rest of that greater assembly, maybe to other items with similar attributes. Consumption experiences might also pull inspiration from gaming concepts. NFTs could ‘compete’ against each other in contests and tournaments: dance-offs, rap battles, song of the summer countdowns, jury-selected film awards. Prizes and promotion would flow back to the owners and creators. We will also see NFT displays designed for public places, restaurants, stores and clubs. Venues might even receive revenue from digital purchases when we once again gather in-person.  \n\nAs these apps are likely to offer personalization, driven by explicit or implicit interests or social graph, one important question is how user data should be managed. Some developers will opt to store the data on their own servers, the way Twitter, Facebook, Spotify and Tiktok do now. The performance benefits are significant, and it’s a huge competitive advantage. In the near term, apps that ‘own the user’ will be more convenient to access and more valuable to investors, partners and advertisers. The danger is that one of these apps uses that advantage to become so big that they cripple the NFT ownership economy. A dominant NFT-app might, for example, demand onerous percentages of transactions driven through its UX or push NFTs in which it had a large ownership stake. Some argue that this outcome is acceptable, provided that artists and owners themselves participate in the equity or revenues of the app through tokens, perhaps granted on the basis and extent of their participation. This may be short-sighted. The widespread adoption of decentralized identity systems, preventing no one app from dominating the last-mile of data ownership, is probably the best way of ensuring a competitive landscape in which artists and collectors get the best deal. Hopefully, prominent NFT creators and investors will loudly advocate for this practice.\n\nBut does it matter? What if, as might be expected, the current data-hoarding giants simply add NFTs into their own experiences? Or if they buy and integrate one of these new upstart apps? The dismal journey from the idealism of ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Web 2.0 to our current oligarchic Internet provides plenty of source material for pessimism. RSS was co-opted and killed by Google, then repackaged and controlled by Twitter and Facebook. Podcasting may be headed in the same direction. History rhymes and regulators tend to act too late and too clumsily to be a savior. The open question, and the spring of optimism if you choose to believe, is whether the new incentives of ownership have forever changed the equation. Do creators and owners, having tasted the fruits of independence, refuse to accept the ‘bad old’ deal? Do developers use the enormous power of the blockchain and DeFi to continue to fund and grow exciting and more equitable offerings? Do all of us consciously orient our media habits towards the ecosystems that most effectively promote broad creative prosperity? If we do, it won’t matter whether Instagram, Tiktok or Spotify becomes the most popular way to consume NFT content. Because to do so, those platforms will be forced to accept a culture of artist and collector control. Nothing is inevitable.\n\nThe NFT market is exploding upwards as speculators, builders, artists, promoters, and others see the opportunity to take advantage of the shift towards decentralized creation and distribution. At the same time, consumers are adopting the technology as they discover NFTs are [proof of passion](https://tals.substack.com/p/proof-of-passion), digitized tokens that prove commitment, interest, support thereby conferring status. But despite the eye-popping prices and insane growth, the market remains underdeveloped. It’s not surprising that people outside the collector cohort think the speculation is weird, and maybe even a little gross. We have yet to really build out how you consume, display and enjoy your collection as anything more than just storing it in your closet or vault or purchasing it on an exchange. *If NFTs crash and burn as a bubble, this will be why.* Only building for the consumption side will enable mass adoption, which will in turn support a loop of creation, ownership, consumption and creation that will power the next wave of media and social infrastructure. As these layers get built, there is an opportunity to avoid some of the centralized challenges of our current consumption and creation stacks and build a more creator-friendly, equitable future. But we have to choose to build it that way.\n\n/Credit to [Dennis Crowley](https://twitter.com/dens) for the header photo.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nhere's an NFT for you to own. shop local. \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/25381014852418948805889093397553910691723421696921342528988486403015055507466)", "timestamp": 1615216368, "digest": "bOWhYyX4u5mY0AfY-ObnQSOOcMVEmJQPVUFSw1qJsdc", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

He told me about a new startup he joined called Mirror which was building a decentralized protocol for writers.\n\nOver the past year, I saw a few failed projects try to do something similar so I was immediately skeptical. But after speaking with the team and learning about recent developments in the space, I’m now convinced that a protocol for crypto-native newsletters is a really interesting opportunity.\n\nI’m so convinced that I decided to join the Mirror team to help build this future. \n\nCrypto provides new tools for *financing*, *monetization*, and *growth*, These tools can enable more creators to succeed as independents. This is what excites me most about the space. Many of these ideas can be applied not just to newsletter businesses, but any media business on the internet.\n\nIn the rest of this post, we’ll explore:\n- Problems with existing tools\n- How crypto can help\n- Hard problems\n- Potential product roadmap\n\nLeggo.\n\n\n### Problems with existing tools\nLeaving the corporate world to go independent seems to be the hot new thing. But after speaking with newsletter writers and media execs, the same problems seem to crop up.\n\n\n***Problem #1: It’s risky to get started as an independent writer***\n\nMost independent writers rely on savings until they start generating significant cash flow. As a result, this limits the number of people that can take the plunge to go independent.\n\n\n***Problem #2: Writers are limited to just a few monetization channels***\n\nThe two main monetization channels for newsletter writers are: subscriptions and ads. Subscriptions are great because they provide recurring revenue but it usually takes a bit of time to build enough trust for people to pay for a subscription. Subscriptions also suffer from what I call “the paywall paradox”.\n\nIf you put your best content behind a paywall, it’ll be harder to acquire new subscribers. But if you make your best content free, it’ll be harder to retain subscribers.\n\nMeanwhile, ads allow you to monetize publicly accessible content. However, it’s a pain in the ass to constantly go through the cycle of sourcing ad partners, closing deals, and managing the relationship.\n\n\n***Problem #3: Sustainable growth is hard***\n\nI love reading newsletters but I’ve found myself subscribing and unsubscribing to paid newsletters pretty frequently these days. There’s only a finite amount of time I have to read newsletters each month and I inevitably end up paying for a few that I never actually read. \n\nI try to support writers even if I’m not reading their work but I wonder how many independent newsletters will end up being successful as more get started over time. I think bundling newsletters is a potential antidote to newsletter fatigue which we’ll cover in a bit.\n\n\n***Problem #4: Risk of burnout***\n\nWriting is hard. Writing every week is really hard. Writing something so good every week that people are willing to pay you is *really fucking hard*. \n\nThere needs to be better ways of helping writers collaborate so they can share the workload, make a sustainable living and feel like they’re being their best creative selves.\n\n\n### How crypto can help\n\nContrary to what many crypto people will lead you to believe, crypto can't solve all of the world's problems. But it's pretty good at a few things.\n\nHere are some ways crypto can enable new models for newsletter businesses.\n\n\n***Reduce the risk of going independent through a global permissionless crowdfund***\n\nCrowdfunding has existed on the internet for a while now. But the main issue is that it can be restrictive. Many times, crowdfunding platforms limit who can contribute based on where you live geographically or whether you’re an accredited investor.\n\n*Crypto enables global permissionless crowdfunds*. As long as you have an Ethereum address and some ETH, you can participate. This opens up the opportunity for people all over the world to raise money for any creative project.\n\nThis past summer, Stir had a cool drop where creators could spin up a landing page and build an email list of supporters before going independent. But what's the crypto-native version of this? \n\nWith crypto, creators can spin up a landing page that allows supporters to send ETH and ERC20 tokens to an escrow contract in return for a newsletter token. Once the creator is ready to go independent, the funds could be streamed to the creator and backers could reduce fraud risk by periodically voting to ensure the creator is hitting certain milestones.\n\nIn crypto, *bits are money*. As a result, we can develop clever systems for reducing risk and aligning incentives between creators and their communities.\n\n\n***Monetize through NFTs***\n\nI’m surprised I got this far without mentioning NFTs 🥴 Beyond the hype, I believe NFTs are a key primitive for helping creators unlock value.\n\nNFTs turn any digital media file (eg essays, songs, art, podcasts, etc.) into an economic asset that can be monetized directly. Instead of being limited to subscriptions or ad revenue, you can monetize each individual essay by minting it as an NFT and selling it to your superfans as a collectible. This enables digital media to be monetized without a paywall or ads. \n\nWe’re still super duper early, but I think this gets really interesting when tools are built to turn essays into their own IP universe. \n\nImagine you want to do an in-depth profile on Drake. You could raise money through a crowdfund, commission an artist to create digital art pieces that reflect themes in the report, mint them as NFTs and sell them as collectibles. You could also auction off access to exclusive communities and discussions.\n\nThe takeaway here is that NFTs open up an entirely new design space for monetization that we’ve still barely explored.\n\n\n***Accelerate growth through community ownership***\n\nBy using crypto rails, you can issue tokens to your community to align incentives and supercharge growth. I think the coolest thing you could do with a newsletter token is give token holders a percentage of future earnings in the form of on-chain dividends. As revenue accrues to an on-chain treasury for the newsletter, token holders can periodically receive payouts.\n\nToken holders can also participate in governance decisions like what topic a writer should cover next, what media formats they should expand to, and what writers should be added to the bundle.\n\nSimilar to NFTs, the design space for newsletter tokens is still underexplored. Yet, I believe crypto's ability to align communities through economic incentives will help creators develop new models for acquisition, engagement, and retention.\n\n\n***Create a bundle to increase distribution, optimize willingness to pay, and reduce burnout risk***\n\nI think only the most talented writers will be able to build a sustainable business as a one-person show. Therefore, we need to build tools to help writers start collectives where they retain the freedom of going independent while reducing financial and emotional risk.\n\nWe’re still early, but crypto provides powerful tools for building shared collectives around creative work. If you want to create a newsletter bundle in web2, you’ll probably need to build a complex stack for tracking analytics, executing revenue share agreements, a CMS, a branded website, and more.\n\nIf you squint, these newsletter bundles start to look more like SaaS businesses than writer collectives. Talented techies can make this work, but most writers can’t. Cryptonetworks natively provide tools that make these types of collectives much easier to start, scale, and govern.\n\nThings like royalty payments and rev shares will eventually become standard smart contracts that anybody can plug into. The best part is that you don’t need to trust that the collective will compensate you fairly. As long as you use a standard smart contract, you can be pretty confident that you’ll get paid based on a deterministic set of rules.\n\nOnce we build these standard smart contracts, I believe it’ll become the default way for creative work to be produced, shared, and owned on the internet.\n\n\n### Hard problems\nTo reiterate, this stuff is still quite speculative. We have ideas about how this could work in theory, but still need to prove them out. Here are some of the hardest problems today with building crypto-native newsletter businesses.\n\n\n***Onboarding sucks***\n\nBefore you can participate in a cryptonetwork like Ethereum, you need to install a smart wallet and turn fiat into ETH. It’s not rocket science, but it’s also not anything like signing up with an email and password. You also need to overcome the mental hurdle of trusting these decentralized systems. (*“What do you mean it’s not FDIC insured?”*)\n\n\n***High gas fees***\n\nHigh gas fees price out large swathes of the population from buying ETH and minting NFTs. There are a lot of really smart people working on solutions like L2 protocols, new L1 blockchains, cross-chain bridges, Ethereum 2.0, etc., so I’m pretty confident this will get solved eventually.\n\n\n***Writing secure, composable, and powerful smart contracts***\n\nIf you’re a decent software engineer, it’s fairly easy to learn how to write smart contracts. However, it’s difficult to write secure contracts that can handle billions of dollars of volume without being exploited. The best smart contract engineers also have a deep understanding of mechanism design and domain expertise in whatever they’re building. We need more world-class engineers building these systems.\n\n\n***Regulatory compliance***\n\nIf a newsletter token just serves as a way to access exclusive content and participate in community governance, then it probably passes the [Howey Test](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets) (this determines whether a digital asset should be regulated by the SEC as a security). However, things get murky when token holders begin receiving cash flows.\n\nI believe in the importance of securities laws to protect consumers but I also believe in the power of creators building decentralized economic networks. We need more thoughtful discussions around how to reconcile the tension between regulation and decentralization.\n\n\n### Product roadmap\nHere are a few features and tools I’d love to see built for crypto-native media businesses in the next few months. These tools can also be abstracted in a way that they can be reused to support any sort of creative work. Whether that's a collective for musicians, digital artists, podcasters, etc.\n\n\n***Moar smart contracts***\n\nCrypto-native media businesses have a few components: tokenized crowdfunding, publications, ability to mint NFTs, community governance, a treasury, etc. There are some smart contracts that perform these functions but we’ll need standards and audits around these contracts so developers can compose and remix these features as they please. \n\n\n***Developer tools***\n\nOne of the common complaints with existing newsletter products is that they don’t offer enough customization. Crypto-native newsletter products should be easy to customize like a SquareSpace site or Webflow. To do this, there needs to be easy to use tools like subgraphs and SDKs for 3rd-party developers to build their own interfaces for on-chain data. \n\n\n***Better writing experience***\n\nMirror has already added the ability to include crypto-native features like crowdfunding and NFTs into essays but what are other ways we could make writing more expressive and multimedia? What does a crypto-native version of Notion look and feel like?\n\n\n***Build an economic social graph***\n\nIn Web2, social graphs are weighted based on engagement metrics such as likes, retweets, shares, etc. In Web3, bits are money. Therefore, we can build social graphs weighted based on economic participation. For example, what if I could go to your Mirror profile and see all the projects you contributed to, how much you contributed, how early you were, and how much money you made?\n\nFood for thought - what would a “Crunchbase for Creators” look like using crypto rails?\n\n\n***Writing marketplaces***\n\nThere really is no such thing as an independent writer. All creative work is collaborative. Maybe you have an editor, or a researcher, or a graphic designer. \n\nSo how do we build crypto-native marketplaces that allow people to easily find jobs they’re suited for and get compensated fairly? \n\n\n***Community-driven capital allocation***\n\nHow do we build tools for people to post bounties for creative work they'd like to see, get it crowdfunded, and let contributors decide who gets to execute the bounty? \n\nHow do we build a crypto-native creator fund where the community decides who gets to receive investment? How do we help the community receive a share of the earnings produced by the selected creators?\n\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nFrom the outside looking in, a lot of stuff in crypto looks like overengineering.\n\nYet, I think we’re just starting to understand the importance of helping creators tap into a global permissionless economic network. The importance of helping creators monetize their work in new and creative ways. The importance of helping creators build economically incentivized communities.\n\nCrypto isn’t just a new technology, it’s a new philosophy for how creative work is produced, shared, and owned on the internet. As one artist said on Clubhouse a few nights ago: “power to the fucking creators”.\n", "timestamp": 1615217737, "digest": "CQnk9PLrBAUskCTCHiA5fA9SBDFZGEfCitVH343FWkY", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

Yet, I believe crypto's ability to align communities through economic incentives will help creators develop new models for acquisition, engagement, and retention.\n\n\n***Easily create bundles / collectives through standard smart contracts***\n\nOnly the most talented writers will be able to build a sustainable business as a one-person show. I think the majority of writers will end up joining some sort of bundle or collective. Collectives are a great way for writers to increase distribution, optimize willingness to pay, and reduce burnout risk.\n\nWe’re still early, but crypto provides powerful tools for building shared collectives around creative work. If you want to create a newsletter bundle in web2, you’ll probably need to build a complex stack for tracking analytics, executing revenue share agreements, a CMS, a branded website, and more.\n\nIf you squint, these newsletter bundles start to look more like SaaS businesses than writer collectives. Talented techies can make this work, but most writers can’t. Cryptonetworks natively provide tools that make these types of collectives much easier to start, scale, and govern.\n\nThings like royalty payments and rev shares will eventually become standard smart contracts that anybody can plug into. The best part is that you don’t need to trust that the collective will compensate you fairly. As long as you use a standard smart contract, you can be pretty confident that you’ll get paid based on a deterministic set of rules.\n\nOnce we build these standard smart contracts, I believe it’ll become the default way for creative work to be produced, shared, and owned on the internet.\n\n\n### Hard problems\nTo reiterate, this stuff is still quite speculative. We have ideas about how this could work in theory, but still need to prove them out. Here are some of the hardest problems today with building crypto-native newsletter businesses.\n\n\n***Onboarding sucks***\n\nBefore you can participate in a cryptonetwork like Ethereum, you need to install a smart wallet and turn fiat into ETH. It’s not rocket science, but it’s also not anything like signing up with an email and password. You also need to overcome the mental hurdle of trusting these decentralized systems. (*“What do you mean it’s not FDIC insured?”*)\n\n\n***High gas fees***\n\nHigh gas fees price out large swathes of the population from buying ETH and minting NFTs. There are a lot of really smart people working on solutions like L2 protocols, new L1 blockchains, cross-chain bridges, Ethereum 2.0, etc., so I’m pretty confident this will get solved eventually.\n\n\n***Writing secure, composable, and powerful smart contracts***\n\nIf you’re a decent software engineer, it’s fairly easy to learn how to write smart contracts. However, it’s difficult to write secure contracts that can handle billions of dollars of volume without being exploited. The best smart contract engineers also have a deep understanding of mechanism design and domain expertise in whatever they’re building. We need more world-class engineers building these systems.\n\n\n***Regulatory compliance***\n\nIf a newsletter token just serves as a way to access exclusive content and participate in community governance, then it probably passes the [Howey Test](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets) (this determines whether a digital asset should be regulated by the SEC as a security). However, things get murky when token holders begin receiving cash flows.\n\nI believe in the importance of securities laws to protect consumers but I also believe in the power of creators building decentralized economic networks. We need more thoughtful discussions around how to reconcile the tension between regulation and decentralization.\n\n\n### Product roadmap\nHere are a few features and tools I’d love to see built for crypto-native media businesses in the next few months. These tools can also be abstracted in a way that they can be reused to support any sort of creative work. Whether that's a collective for musicians, digital artists, podcasters, etc.\n\n\n***Moar smart contracts***\n\nCrypto-native media businesses have a few components: tokenized crowdfunding, publications, ability to mint NFTs, community governance, a treasury, etc. There are some smart contracts that perform these functions but we’ll need standards and audits around these contracts so developers can compose and remix these features as they please. \n\n\n***Developer tools***\n\nOne of the common complaints with existing newsletter products is that they don’t offer enough customization. Crypto-native newsletter products should be easy to customize like a SquareSpace site or Webflow. To do this, there needs to be easy to use tools like subgraphs and SDKs for 3rd-party developers to build their own interfaces for on-chain data. \n\n\n***Better writing experience***\n\nMirror has already added the ability to include crypto-native features like crowdfunding and NFTs into essays but what are other ways we could make writing more expressive and multimedia? What does a crypto-native version of Notion look and feel like?\n\n\n***Build an economic social graph***\n\nIn Web2, social graphs are weighted based on engagement metrics such as likes, retweets, shares, etc. In Web3, bits are money. Therefore, we can build social graphs weighted based on economic participation. For example, what if I could go to your Mirror profile and see all the projects you contributed to, how much you contributed, how early you were, and how much money you made?\n\nFood for thought - what would a “Crunchbase for Creators” look like using crypto rails?\n\n\n***Writing marketplaces***\n\nThere really is no such thing as an independent writer. All creative work is collaborative. Maybe you have an editor, or a researcher, or a graphic designer. \n\nSo how do we build crypto-native marketplaces that allow people to easily find jobs they’re suited for and get compensated fairly? \n\n\n***Community-driven capital allocation***\n\nHow do we build tools for people to post bounties for creative work they'd like to see, get it crowdfunded, and let contributors decide who gets to execute the bounty? \n\nHow do we build a crypto-native creator fund where the community decides who gets to receive investment? How do we help the community receive a share of the earnings produced by the selected creators?\n\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nFrom the outside looking in, a lot of stuff in crypto looks like overengineering.\n\nYet, I think we’re just starting to understand the importance of helping creators tap into a global permissionless economic network. The importance of helping creators monetize their work in new and creative ways. The importance of helping creators build economically incentivized communities.\n\nCrypto isn’t just a new technology, it’s a new philosophy for how creative work is produced, shared, and owned on the internet. As one artist said on Clubhouse a few nights ago: “power to the fucking creators”.\n", "timestamp": 1615221558, "digest": "CQnk9PLrBAUskCTCHiA5fA9SBDFZGEfCitVH343FWkY", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}
