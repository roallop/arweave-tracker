{"id": "8tcDxjnVh7KkwPoxUlnx5BKY08toawY0IJXT7bdNAKc", "title": "This DAO is here to $PARTY", "body": "*Update: The crowdfund has been fully funded! Backers with at least 10 $PARTY tokens can now join the [PartyDAO Discord](https://discord.gg/uMJxGZ6emD).*\n\n[Party DAO](crowdfund://0x402eb84d9cb2d6cF66Bde9B46D7277d3f4a16B54?network=homestead)\n\nAn amazing community coordination paradigm called PartyBid has emerged this week. I want to capture it in this post and invite you to get involved in PartyDAO.\n\nBut first, PartyBid’s backstory is essential.\n\nIn a recent deep [dive into web3](https://www.notboring.co/p/unwitting-collaboration-and-web3), Packy McCormick cited Chris Dixon’s 2013 post “What the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years”, signaling readers to pay attention to what people are doing with web3 after hours. Appropriately, PartyBid was spawned from a Twitter thread by Dave White that began “It’s friday night, let's build a mechanism together!” \n\nAn hour and a half later, I replied with the following:\n\n[](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1383238473767813125)\n\nIn short, a PartyBid is a pop-up DAO whose sole purpose is to win an NFT auction. \n\nThe idea was a response to a few drawbacks I see in NFTs. On the positive side, NFT auctions have found a clear product market fit over the past few months as a new, crypto-native way for creators to monetize their work, inspiring a wave of new people to wade into crypto. But I’d argue there's still an anti-social element to NFT bidding and ownership, for instance:  \n\n- Only one person can win an NFT auction, excluding all other collections put forth from supporters who might have wanted to get involved with a work. Obviously, that also means only one person can own an NFT. \n- When you’re bidding, you’re bidding on your own. NFT auctions are single-player.\n- Crypto whales have an enormous edge over more humble patrons in these auctions.\n\nPartyBid aims to solve both the single-ownership and whale-dominance issue of NFT auctions by allowing bidders to pool their assets and bid as a collective. I see it working like this: \n\n1. A PartyBid (or multiple PartyBids) can be deployed for any NFT auction. \n2. Anyone can deposit ETH into the PartyBid, in return for a proportional stake represented by an ERC-20 token. They become partiers. \n3. The contract can be called to bid on the auction if it has enough ETH in the pool to place the highest bid. \n4. If it gets outbid, partiers can deposit more ETH into the PartyBid to make another bid. \n5. If the PartyBid wins, the DAO takes custody of the NFT. Token holders can vote on what to do with the NFT.\n6. If the PartyBid loses, funds are returned to the partiers. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a2b3f80b-56be-475d-8d79-765d88955d37.jpeg?height=1138&width=2024)\n\nThe idea took off. Only a few days later, @_anishagnihotri built an initial implementation of PartyBid. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1384372491053846531\n\nA testament to the power of sharing ideas online—where they’re only ever a retweet away from a talented developer bringing it to life—PartyBid had attained minimum viable meme status. Enough people shared it. Someone built it. Now, Anish’s build is already evolving, boosting the idea’s viability in the memepool. \n\nYesterday, Anish and company deployed the PartyBid code to bid on Colin and Samir's auction.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1389747619388403714)\n\nThe success story even got its fairytale ending. The first PartyBid—deployed by Anish—won the auction for 9.70 ETH!\n\n[Token #2962](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2962)\n\nIt’s insane what the internet can do with an idea in two weeks, but we can take it even further. PartyBid could use a lot more work. Improved and generalized contract code. An audit by experienced solidity engineers. An interface that’s easy to use. Integration with popular NFT platforms, where all the action’s happening. Even Mirror integration! \n\nMeme power only gets an idea so far. To get to a production-ready smart contract or product, we need funding and coordination.\n\n### Introducing PartyDAO\n\nWhat if a DAO could form around PartyBid with the mission to get PartyBid production-ready and into the world?\n\nThe PartyDAO experiment starts now with the $PARTY crowdfund. Here’s how I see it playing out:\n\n- Backers can support the crowdfund with ETH in return for $PARTY tokens\n- $PARTY tokens represent membership in PartyDAO\n- The first feature of PartyDAO will be a tokenized Discord, gated by $PARTY. Backers will immediately be able to join the PartyDAO Discord. \n- $PARTY holders will coordinate in the Discord to decide on a plan for governance, development roadmap, and how to allocate the raised funds\n- 50% of $PARTY supply will be held back to airdrop on quality community members who'd like to participate but may not be able to back the project with ETH\n\nThe crowdfund will target a fundraise of 25 ETH, which will be deposited into a multisig governed by the backers. With PartyDAO, I imagine we could hire solidity developers to ensure PartyBid contracts are production-ready, hire designers and product engineers to build a web app and hire artists to create marketing materials, memes, and NFTs. \n\nThose are just some initial thoughts, and anything’s possible. Ultimately, $PARTY holders will decide. PartyDAO is just an experiment, but I believe it could serve as a blueprint for how communities fund, build, and evolve open infrastructure, as well as how the next generation of collective curation could work.\n\n*I'd like to recognized the influence of amazing DAOs in the ecosystem, such as [@PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO), that have pioneered collective collecting and have done extremely impactful charitable work. PartyBid stands on the shoulders of these giants and hopes to lower the cognitive and technical costs of DAO coordination to create a new wave of DAOs.*", "timestamp": 1622770262, "digest": "FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4", "contributor": "0x5507dbd48a5A5bAcE8a6030e878cC4E0af147C33"}

It's an experiment in [universal creator income](https://li.substack.com/p/the-case-for-universal-creative-income), [tech stacks for decentralized cities](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4), and the physical [manifestation of DAOs](https://twitter.com/jongold/status/1395390112205352962?s=20).\n\n\n[CabinDAO](crowdfund://0x94515e4f6fabad73C8bCdd8cd42f0b5C037E2c49?network=homestead)\n\n\nThis is a crowdfund for one year of cumulative time living and building at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) in the Texas Hill Country. We're situated on 28 acres of land about 45 minutes from downtown Austin, and we just built a new cabin designed as a collaborative co-living and working space for independent online creators. Our cabins are the first nodes in what we hope will one day be a [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/):\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f7f4c3a9-0d4d-4403-8a28-23432eb32a98.jpg?height=1286&width=1954)\n\n[The land & cabins are our hardware](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4). Now we're starting to experiment with on-chain governance software. We will set up CabinDAO to manage this crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens, which can be used to vote for creator residency proposals. While the DAO will ultimately govern the use of the funds, here's a rough sketch of how we are thinking about structuring the program:\n\n## CabinDAO\n\nWe want to crowdfund 12 months' worth of time at the cabins. This would allow $CABIN holders to vote and fund 12 creators to come for a one-month stay each. The new cabin has four bedrooms, so we would run three cohorts of four creators each.\n\nThe DAO will set up an open application process, perhaps similar to $WRITE RACE. Winners will be invited to Creator Cabins outside of Austin, TX to work on their projects——or ride the waves of synchronicity & decide to collaborate. \n\nAt the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their work at the residency. Our intention is for the CabinDAO community (IRL in Texas, and globally on Discord) to help creators best use emergent web3 patterns to collaborate and share their work.\n\nWhile the first use-case for this DAO is creator residencies, we hope to learn from this experiment and continue to find ways to sustainably fund independent online creators and develop DAO-based governance models for physical spaces. CabinDAO community adds a node to an interdependent network of the new Creator Economy. The edges of CabinDAO are permeable and open to all forms of contribution. We're especially excited about mutually beneficial web3 native collaborations with other DAOs working toward similar visions.\n\nThis project came together over the course of a two-week stay at Creator Cabins by members of [creator.coop](https://creator.coop). We didn't go into our stay intending to make this——the plan emerged from two weeks of co-working, co-living, and co-creating at the cabins. \n\nEveryone came into their time at the cabins with projects they wanted to finish, but late-night conversations around the fire got us all inspired to think about opening the space up to the whole community, regardless of financial means. We hope the residency program can help inspire more collaborative, community-oriented projects like this one.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2c1549c9-0d03-4b4e-914c-d50f07800d22.jpg?height=1284&width=1932)\n\n\n## FAQs\n\n### How do I contribute?\n\nUsing Mirror's widget embedded in this post, you can send ETH to CabinDAO's crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens and invited to our Discord community to begin putting together the plan to fund residencies. Contributions are capped at 2 ETH to maximize participation and ensure balanced governance.\n\n\n### Who is eligible for a residency?\n\nAnyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders. If you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n\n### How do I apply for a residency? \n\nOnce the crowdfund is complete, the DAO will run an open process for selecting applicants. [If you're interested in being notified about that process, opt-in here](https://creatorcabins.ck.page/9e628caec5).\n\n\n### How will the money be spent?\n\nAll money raised by the DAO will be used to fund residencies at Creator Cabins. We are budgeting 1/2th of an ETH per creator-week, so 24 ETH can fund 3 cohorts (12 creators for 4 weeks each the cabins). This provides enough funding for room, board, and services to support creators during their stay.\n\n\n### How will the DAO sustain itself?\n\nAt the end of each residency, we will help creators mint an NFT representing their work. The NFTs could be held and curated by the CabinDAO treasury or sold back to the community with a split of the proceeds going to the artist and the DAO. \n\nWe hope this structure can help produce value for the community and creator residents while contributing to the long-term sustainability of this model. This is a patronage project designed to provide the gift of time and space to our community. Contributors to the DAO should not expect any financial return.\n\n\n### What happens with the other 50% of $CABIN?\n\nCabinDAO will retain 50% of $CABIN tokens to give to artists upon completion of their residencies, collaborators, other communally beneficial DAOs, future supporters of the residency program, and whoever else CabinDAO decides to grant them to.\n\n\n### Is this co-ownership in the cabins?\n\nNo. CabinDAO is a separate entity, managing the endowment of our creative residency program. This is our first experiment with web3 governance, and we hope to use the lessons from this project to progressively decentralize other aspects of this project in the future.\n\n\n### Why IRL?\n\nThis project never would have happened without the open-ended space to explore and collaborate IRL. It emerged from late-night conversations at the cabin where we are hosting this residency. \n\nAfter a year of pandemic, we had forgotten some of the magical energy of open-ended living and working with other people. You don't need to schedule a Zoom call with an agenda and a hard stop after 30 minutes. As you're drinking your morning coffee, you can end up down a rabbit hole, swapping book recommendations, productivity tools, and podcast episodes. The result: great conversations, deepened friendships, and exciting new ideas.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1df7adbe-3a5c-49e0-95f2-d9af9e8c364e.jpg?height=1298&width=1946)\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/27723c84-ba7e-4cf2-b133-6b843455ecd1.jpg?height=1284&width=1950)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2a3ce5da-5f6d-4ce6-974a-83006b9ddcd4.jpg?height=1308&width=1960)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/39edd82a-9a14-4f91-9442-79e59c11eb5b.jpg?height=1292&width=1940)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8aca6bb-3fd6-457a-987e-c606089a5907.jpg?height=1254&width=1932)\n\n\n[CabinDAO](crowdfund://0x94515e4f6fabad73C8bCdd8cd42f0b5C037E2c49?network=homestead)\n\n\n\n**Acknowledgements** \n\n*Our ideas are building on the prior art, shared learnings & enlightening conversations we’ve had with many others over the past few months.*\n\n*Thanks to @patrickxrivera, @thattallguy, @sirsuhayb, @js_horne, @ljin18, @drewcoffman, and @jarroddicker for talking through the initial idea and helping set up the right structure for this project.*\n\n*Thanks to Seed Club, Songcamp, PartyDAO, herstoryDAO, and the Mint Fund for feedback, inspiration, and advice.*\n\n*Thanks to @p_millerd and @kadlac for being the first people to contribute funds when this was still just an idea.*\n\n*Thanks to @brianwlackey for the beautiful photography in this post.*", "timestamp": 1622786883, "digest": "20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

It's an experiment in [universal creator income](https://li.substack.com/p/the-case-for-universal-creative-income), [tech stacks for decentralized cities](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4), and the physical [manifestation of DAOs](https://twitter.com/jongold/status/1395390112205352962?s=20).\n\n\n[CabinDAO](crowdfund://0x94515e4f6fabad73C8bCdd8cd42f0b5C037E2c49?network=homestead)\n\n\nThis is a crowdfund for one year of cumulative time living and building at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) in the Texas Hill Country. We're situated on 28 acres of land about 45 minutes from downtown Austin, and we just built a new cabin designed as a collaborative co-living and working space for independent online creators. Our cabins are the first nodes in what we hope will one day be a [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/):\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f7f4c3a9-0d4d-4403-8a28-23432eb32a98.jpg?height=1286&width=1954)\n\n[The land & cabins are our hardware](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4). Now we're starting to experiment with on-chain governance software. We will set up CabinDAO to manage this crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens, which can be used to vote for creator residency proposals. While the DAO will ultimately govern the use of the funds, here's a rough sketch of how we are thinking about structuring the program:\n\n## CabinDAO\n\nWe want to crowdfund 12 months' worth of time at the cabins. This would allow $CABIN holders to vote and fund 12 creators to come for a one-month stay each. The new cabin has four bedrooms, so we would run three cohorts of four creators each.\n\nThe DAO will set up an open application process, perhaps similar to $WRITE RACE. Winners will be invited to Creator Cabins outside of Austin, TX to work on their projects——or ride the waves of synchronicity & decide to collaborate. \n\nAt the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their work at the residency. Our intention is for the CabinDAO community (IRL in Texas, and globally on Discord) to help creators best use emergent web3 patterns to collaborate and share their work.\n\nWhile the first use-case for this DAO is creator residencies, we hope to learn from this experiment and continue to find ways to sustainably fund independent online creators and develop DAO-based governance models for physical spaces. CabinDAO community adds a node to an interdependent network of the new Creator Economy. The edges of CabinDAO are permeable and open to all forms of contribution. We're especially excited about mutually beneficial web3 native collaborations with other DAOs working toward similar visions.\n\nThis project came together over the course of a two-week stay at Creator Cabins by members of [creator.coop](https://creator.coop). We didn't go into our stay intending to make this——the plan emerged from two weeks of co-working, co-living, and co-creating at the cabins. \n\nEveryone came into their time at the cabins with projects they wanted to finish, but late-night conversations around the fire got us all inspired to think about opening the space up to the whole community, regardless of financial means. We hope the residency program can help inspire more collaborative, community-oriented projects like this one.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2c1549c9-0d03-4b4e-914c-d50f07800d22.jpg?height=1284&width=1932)\n\n\n## FAQs\n\n### How do I contribute?\n\nUsing Mirror's widget embedded in this post, you can send ETH to CabinDAO's crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens and invited to our Discord community to begin putting together the plan to fund residencies. Contributions are capped at 2 ETH to maximize participation and ensure balanced governance.\n\n\n### Who is eligible for a residency?\n\nAnyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders. If you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n\n### How do I apply for a residency? \n\nOnce the crowdfund is complete, the DAO will run an open process for selecting applicants. [If you're interested in being notified about that process, opt-in here](https://creatorcabins.ck.page/9e628caec5).\n\n\n### How will the money be spent?\n\nAll money raised by the DAO will be used to fund residencies at Creator Cabins. We are budgeting 1/2 of an ETH per creator-week, so 24 ETH can fund 3 cohorts (12 creators for 4 weeks each the cabins). This provides enough funding for room, board, a stipend, and additional services to support creators during their stay. If we raise less, we will still operate the program but may have to reduce services or the number of cohorts.\n\n\n### How will the DAO sustain itself?\n\nAt the end of each residency, we will help creators mint an NFT representing their work. The NFTs could be held and curated by the CabinDAO treasury or sold back to the community with a split of the proceeds going to the artist and the DAO. \n\nWe hope this structure can help produce value for the community and creator residents while contributing to the long-term sustainability of this model. This is a patronage project designed to provide the gift of time and space to our community. Contributors to the DAO should not expect any financial return.\n\n\n### What happens with the other 50% of $CABIN?\n\nCabinDAO will retain 50% of $CABIN tokens to give to artists upon completion of their residencies, collaborators, other communally beneficial DAOs, future supporters of the residency program, and whoever else CabinDAO decides to grant them to.\n\n\n### Is this co-ownership in the cabins?\n\nNo. CabinDAO is a separate entity, managing the endowment of our creative residency program. This is our first experiment with web3 governance, and we hope to use the lessons from this project to progressively decentralize other aspects of this project in the future.\n\n\n### Why IRL?\n\nThis project never would have happened without the open-ended space to explore and collaborate IRL. It emerged from late-night conversations at the cabin where we are hosting this residency. \n\nAfter a year of pandemic, we had forgotten some of the magical energy of open-ended living and working with other people. You don't need to schedule a Zoom call with an agenda and a hard stop after 30 minutes. As you're drinking your morning coffee, you can end up down a rabbit hole, swapping book recommendations, productivity tools, and podcast episodes. The result: great conversations, deepened friendships, and exciting new ideas.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1df7adbe-3a5c-49e0-95f2-d9af9e8c364e.jpg?height=1298&width=1946)\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/27723c84-ba7e-4cf2-b133-6b843455ecd1.jpg?height=1284&width=1950)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2a3ce5da-5f6d-4ce6-974a-83006b9ddcd4.jpg?height=1308&width=1960)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/39edd82a-9a14-4f91-9442-79e59c11eb5b.jpg?height=1292&width=1940)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8aca6bb-3fd6-457a-987e-c606089a5907.jpg?height=1254&width=1932)\n\n\n[CabinDAO](crowdfund://0x94515e4f6fabad73C8bCdd8cd42f0b5C037E2c49?network=homestead)\n\n\n\n**Acknowledgements** \n\n*Our ideas are building on the prior art, shared learnings & enlightening conversations we’ve had with many others over the past few months.*\n\n*Thanks to @patrickxrivera, @thattallguy, @sirsuhayb, @js_horne, @ljin18, @drewcoffman, and @jarroddicker for talking through the initial idea and helping set up the right structure for this project.*\n\n*Thanks to Seed Club, Songcamp, PartyDAO, herstoryDAO, and the Mint Fund for feedback, inspiration, and advice.*\n\n*Thanks to @p_millerd and @kadlac for being the first people to contribute funds when this was still just an idea.*\n\n*Thanks to @brianwlackey for the beautiful photography in this post.*", "timestamp": 1622787020, "digest": "20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

If you do have $CABIN tokens, you can now [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/N6hVmFygjR) to discuss this proposal! See you there.*\n\n_______________________\n\n\n## 🥅 Goals\n\nThe goals of CabinDAO will ultimately be whatever the DAO decides they are. That said, when the DAO was formed, here are some of the things we intended to accomplish:\n\n> 🌐 Create the conditions for serendipitous in-person collaboration across a diverse internet community 🧑‍🤝‍🧑\n\n> 🏡 Experiment with sustainable models for funding the living expenses of independent online creators 🧑‍🎨 \n\n> 🧭 Explore the idea maze of decentralized governance for physical locations 🗳️ \n\n\n## 🏘️ Residency program\n\nTo accomplish these goals, **we are proposing a 3-month trial of a cohort-based residency, where we bring together groups of 4 independent online creators for 4 weeks to work on projects.**\n\n### 📍 Location\n\nGroups of four residents would spend a month living and working alongside other members of their cohort at [Creators Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/), a 28-acre retreat about 45 minutes outside of Austin, TX. They would stay in a four-bedroom shipping container cabin designed from the ground up for a community of independent online creators:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710) \n\nWhile these first cohorts would be hosted at Creator Cabins, we hope to expand to other locations supported by the DAO in the future. \n\n\n### 🚧 Projects & outcomes\n\nEach of the residents will come with a project they intend to work on. We expect some will stick to the original plan and others will ride the waves of synchronicity & decide to collaborate on something new.\n\nEither way, the expectation of the residency is that you will complete *something* that can be shared with the community by the end of your stay. At the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their work at the residency. This NFT can either be held in the CabinDAO treasury or auctioned, with a 50/50 split going to the creator & to the DAO to fund future residencies. \n\nOur intention is for the CabinDAO community (IRL in Texas, and globally on Discord) to help creators best use emergent web3 patterns to collaborate and share their work. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win a residency, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide. \n\n\n### 🏕️ Camp counselor\n\nResidents will be supported by a \"camp counselor\", who will help facilitate the experience, pick people up at the airport, create ~~~ gOoD vIbEs ~~~, organize weekly grocery runs, brainstorm wild ideas, and generally try to be helpful. The counselor (and any visitors) will stay in the old cabin. \n\nCounselors are people who have completed a residency before and are coming back to support the community. The counselor role will be compensated with free housing and 500 $CABIN tokens per cohort. \n\n\n### 📅 Cohort dates\n\nWe will run three 4-week cohorts over the next few months:\n\n- Cohort 1: *July 19th - August 15th* (hot DAO summer)\n- Cohort 2: *August 23rd - September 19th* (slightly cooler DAO summer)\n- Cohort 3: *September 20th - October 17th* (hitting-our-stride DAO fall)\n\n\n\n## 📋 Application process\n\nThe residency program is open to anyone creating independently and sharing their work online.\n\nFor each cohort, we will run an application & voting process similar to Mirror's $WRITE RACE. People interested in a residency will submit a short proposal, up to 250 words, outlining how they would spend a month of time at Creator Cabins. \n\n$CABIN holders will be able to cast as many votes as the number of tokens they have. Votes can be split among multiple proposals. At the end of the voting period, the top four proposals will receive a one-month residency for the designated cohort.\n\n**We will start accepting applications for Cohort 1 in late June. [Sign up here for updates on the application process.](https://creatorcabins.ck.page/9e628caec5)**\n\n\n\n## 💰 Budget\n\n### 💸 Costs: 5 ETH + 1500 $CABIN per cohort\n\nWe currently have 15.6 ETH and 15.6k $CABIN in the treasury. This is enough for us to cover three 4-week cohorts at a budget of 5 ETH + 1500 $CABIN per cohort. This will cover the following expenses:\n\n- *1 ETH per week*: renting out the full Creator Cabins property (including both cabins, high-speed internet, utilities, and cleaning). The market rate for the cabins is more than this, but we know a guy 😉\n- *0.25 ETH + 250 $CABIN*: stipend for each creator in the cohort to cover food and gas costs to mint the end-of-program NFT\n- *500 $CABIN*: stipend for the camp counselor for each cohort\n\n\n### 🪂 Airdrop\n\nWe are also planning to airdrop 500 $CABIN each to @p_millerd and @kadlac for their OG contributions before we even officially set up the crowdfund:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kadlac/status/1394149045757571078\n\n\n## 🔮 Long-term plans\n\nWe are [leaving the crowdfund open](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ) so that we can continue to raise additional funds for future cohorts and allow new members to join the DAO. We also hope to raise additional sustainable funds for the program through splits on sales of NFTs produced by residents. \n\nWhile the first use-case for this DAO is creator residencies, we will learn from this experiment and continue to find ways to sustainably fund independent online creators and develop DAO-based governance models for physical spaces.\n\nWe would love your feedback and contributions to this project! Slide into our DMs or tweet **@creatorcabins**, **@jonathanhillis**, **@jongold**, and **@ZFleischmann**.

{"id": "4Fu4x2enSz5cwlRQwWiJdiUXGrnmRJAfp-OzmukiJLE", "title": "Scaling Ethereum ", "body": "One of the biggest challenges for developers building on Ethereum’s market leading smart contract platform/blockchain are the high fees and slow transactions. These issues arise from the fact that the Ethereum blockchain’s current architecture is not particularly scalable.\n\nThe Ethereum core developers have been working on these issues for years and there are changes coming in the core Ethereum protocol that will help with scalability. But the broader Ethereum community is not relying entirely on the core developers to address these issues. There are a number of “layer two” solutions that have emerged that will bring very significant increases in speed and lower fees.\n\nOne of these layer two solutions, called Zero Knowledge Rollups, is particularly exciting to us at USV and earlier this year we invested in a project called [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/) (also known as ZKSync) that has built what we think is the best approach to Rollups on top of Ethereum.\n\nMy partner [Nick](https://twitter.com/nickgrossman) [posted today about ZKSync](https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/06/scaling-ethereum-with-zksync/) and outlined why we are so excited about this approach. If you are a developer building on Ethereum and are looking for a good layer two solution, you should absolutely read [Nick’s post](https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/06/scaling-ethereum-with-zksync/). I would also recommend it for anyone who is invested in or interested in Ethereum as layer two scaling solutions will likely unlock a lot of value in the Ethereum community over the coming years.\n", "timestamp": 1622829695, "digest": "XkuMWWwRilvTkxQHj2eB7_N7KFrjOraP_-sesi_e0uI", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

These high-profile pieces often sell for [millions of dollars](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million) and leave many people who are new to the concept of [Web3](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-web-3), the decentralised future of the internet, asking themselves how something intangible and virtual could ever possibly have a value comparable or even higher than that attributed to physical \"real\" art.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9576e3e-9caf-4dcd-97e0-17978f21eb63.png?height=1025&width=2700)\n\nNFT stands for Non-fungible Token, where fungibility is the ability for a good or asset to be interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type. Ethereum is a fungible token because if we swap 1 ETH for 1 ETH between ourselves, we will both end up with an identical asset in our hands at the beginning and end of the trade. NFTs are different in that each token is distinct and uniquely identifiable from another. These tokens are not exclusively useful in the art world. In fact, they have uses that stretch far beyond crypto-art ranging from tokenised concert tickets to potentially even tokenising the deeds to your house in developing economies where perhaps property rights are potentially less watertight. Crypto-art has been a great proof of concept for the widespread adoption of NFTs. It has introduced the world to the idea of ownership of digital assets beyond just fungible cryptocurrencies.\n \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2f5b8306-2219-4e70-bd1e-952fed0b58d6.png?height=568&width=1688)\n\nDespite the massive media hype behind NFTs, I still regularly get asked about the value proposition of NFTs and how these tokenised art pieces could ever be worth as much as a \"real\" piece of physical art. \n\nI like to draw a parallel between NFTs and 1/1 prints by famous photographers. The only way a photographer can traditionally hope to sell their photograph in the same price bracket as fine artists do is by signing a print and hoping that the market recognises its value. The difficulty with digital art such as photographs, videos or 3D models is that, in theory, anyone could print or reproduce the exact same file as the original and display it in their virtual or physical space. This reproduction of the file would be identical to the signed copy of a famous photographer's print in every way other than the written signature, which as a side note, could also be forged. NFTs are the first time these digital-first artists can ever properly authenticate and vouch for the uniqueness of a particular work of art by cryptographically signing the piece with their Ethereum (or even Tezos) wallet. The beauty of this is that in addition to being able to cryptographically sign almost anything as an NFT, whether digital or physical, the signature is also available on the public blockchain for anyone to see. It is perhaps the only medium where anyone can properly authenticate a piece of art without having any level of artistic know-how or expertise. One cannot necessarily say the same for fine art pieces. In theory, if someone showed me a very high-quality counterfeit Mona Lisa there are probably a very limited number of people in the world who could properly tell the difference between the real and a highly sophisticated fake. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/39b121fb-4e74-4106-a992-46cc1d753b32.png?height=947&width=2030)\n\nAnother question people often struggle with when first wrapping their heads around the value of NFTs is what you can do with this token once you are the exclusive owner and it is sitting in your wallet. The way I look at art is that ultimately you buy a piece of art either to express yourself and perhaps signal something about your personality, personalise a physical or virtual space or you buy a piece of art as a financial investment. NFTs are the perfect medium for each of these use-cases. The beauty of the public Ethereum ledger is that ownership is fully transparent so your expression and/or signalling can be even more visible, and platforms like [Showtime](https://tryshowtime.com/) and [Aito](https://thisisaito.xyz) are making this easier by reading the public ledger and displaying all your favourite NFTs in an easily digestible social feed format. Companies like [Infinite Objects](https://infiniteobjects.com/) and [FRAMED](https://frm.fm/) are making it easy to personalise your physical space with NFT art frames. NFTs give you the flexibility to display this art in your virtual spaces as well with things like [in-game skins](https://dmarket.com/) or even eventually customising spaces in the VR metaverse. Finally, perhaps a part of the NFT value proposition that is often taken for granted is that these assets are crypto-assets just like Bitcoin and Ethereum and can therefore be transferred from one wallet to another. This transfer of the artwork happens in a completely decentralised and trustless way within seconds and the parties never have to worry about armoured vehicles or insurance at any point of the transaction. This is something that cannot be said for the transportation of traditional multi-million dollar paintings from one side of the world to the other. These features make it perfect as a financial asset to be bought and sold, and in addition many NFT protocols have integrated royalty features in which artists can receive a percentage of secondary market sales, which allows this active and fluid speculative art market to increase value for the artists further and allows artists to express themselves in bigger and better ways thanks to this added revenue stream.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8c806509-d8df-419e-a33c-763fe864f7c3.png?height=1072&width=2732)\n\nIt is important to remember that, interestingly, the NFT does not contain the original file itself; it contains a URL that points to the original file on a decentralised file system. The most commonly used out of these file systems is the [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/), which is a network of computers, specifically hard drives, that communicate peer to peer to form a completely decentralised storage system, almost like a version of Dropbox where the files are not fully hosted by any single party. This decentralisation makes it incredibly difficult for a third party to intentionally erase a file from the whole network and ensures the longevity of the URL tied to the NFT. There are some complexities involved with [paying for the hosting costs](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs) of said file on the IPFS system, but ultimately, this responsibility is that of the buyer and is not a concern if proper precautions are taken, and the buyer continues to pay for IPFS hosting fees in the future. Solutions like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) have also recently gained in popularity as users can pay for \"permanent\" file storage in one initial bulk payment and are slowly catching on as platforms like [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz) start adopting them due to their superior hands-off longevity.\n\nNFTs will undoubtedly become a very large part of the future of the art world and perhaps may even come to compliment physical art as well. Many large auction houses such as Christie's have fully integrated NFTs into their  offering and have even started selling NFTs with [mainstream brands such as Gucci](https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/proof-sovereignty-curated-nft-sale-lady-pheonix/gucci-est-1921-6/121268). The smart-contract technology behind NFTs is so flexible that it enables both artists and supporting platforms to craft increasingly unique use-cases and sale mechanisms for these art pieces. DeFi lending platforms like AAVE are starting to allow the usage of [NFTs as collateral](https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-as-collateral-coming-to-aave-ceo-10575.htm) for loans on their protocol and NFT auction sites such as [DoinGud](https://doingud.com/) will allow for a percentage of every sale, both primary and secondary, to automatically go towards a charitable cause directly in the smart-contract code itself.", "timestamp": 1622836716, "digest": "q8c7skDoxt589I3eKCXLHsbiW_fFbZFDv73JnF3VmZQ", "contributor": "0xcde3725B25D6d9bC78CF0941cC15Fd9710c764b9"}
{"id": "rAsYSmgPDqYAHTdoRsyzdDr4hz52e5P9j7W58SMLgOE", "title": "CabinDAO creator residency program proposal\n", "body": "*This is a proposal for structuring the [creator residency program crowdfunded by CabinDAO](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ). We will publish CabinDAO governance proposals publicly.*\n\n*We'd love feedback from the community, whether or not you're a $CABIN hodler. If you do have $CABIN tokens, you can now [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/N6hVmFygjR) to discuss this proposal! See you there.*\n\n_______________________\n\n\n## 🥅 Goals\n\nThe goals of CabinDAO will ultimately be whatever the DAO decides they are. That said, when the DAO was formed, here are some of the things we intended to accomplish:\n\n> 🌐 Create the conditions for serendipitous in-person collaboration across a diverse internet community 🧑‍🤝‍🧑\n\n> 🏡 Experiment with sustainable models for funding the living expenses of independent online creators 🧑‍🎨 \n\n> 🧭 Explore the idea maze of decentralized governance for physical locations 🗳️ \n\n\n## 🏘️ Residency program\n\nTo accomplish these goals, **we are proposing a 3-month trial of a cohort-based residency, where we bring together groups of 4 independent online creators for 4 weeks to work on projects.**\n\n### 📍 Location\n\nGroups of four residents would spend a month living and working alongside other members of their cohort at [Creators Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/), a 28-acre retreat about 45 minutes outside of Austin, TX. They would stay in a four-bedroom shipping container cabin designed from the ground up for a community of independent online creators:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710) \n\nWhile these first cohorts would be hosted at Creator Cabins, we hope to expand to other locations supported by the DAO in the future. \n\n\n### 🚧 Projects & outcomes\n\nEach of the residents will come with a project they intend to work on. We expect some will stick to the original plan and others will ride the waves of synchronicity & decide to collaborate on something new.\n\nEither way, the expectation of the residency is that you will complete *something* that can be shared with the community by the end of your stay. At the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their work at the residency. This NFT can either be held in the CabinDAO treasury or auctioned, with a 50/50 split going to the creator & to the DAO to fund future residencies. \n\nOur intention is for the CabinDAO community (IRL in Texas, and globally on Discord) to help creators best use emergent web3 patterns to collaborate and share their work. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win a residency, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide. \n\n\n### 🏕️ Camp counselor\n\nResidents will be supported by a \"camp counselor\", who will help facilitate the experience, pick people up at the airport, create ~~~ gOoD vIbEs ~~~, organize weekly grocery runs, brainstorm wild ideas, and generally try to be helpful. The counselor (and any visitors) will stay in the old cabin. \n\nCounselors are people who have completed a residency before and are coming back to support the community. We expect it will take <10 hours per week of work, so anyone working remotely/flexibly can be a counselor part-time. The counselor role will be compensated with free housing and 500 $CABIN tokens per cohort. \n\n\n### 📅 Cohort dates\n\nWe will run three 4-week cohorts over the next few months:\n\n- Cohort 1: *July 19th - August 15th* (hot DAO summer)\n- Cohort 2: *August 23rd - September 19th* (slightly cooler DAO summer)\n- Cohort 3: *September 20th - October 17th* (hitting-our-stride DAO fall)\n\n\n\n## 📋 Application process\n\nThe residency program is open to anyone creating independently and sharing their work online.\n\nFor each cohort, we will run an application & voting process similar to Mirror's $WRITE RACE. People interested in a residency will submit a short proposal, up to 250 words, outlining how they would spend a month of time at Creator Cabins. \n\n$CABIN holders will be able to cast as many votes as the number of tokens they have. Votes can be split among multiple proposals. At the end of the voting period, the top four proposals will receive a one-month residency for the designated cohort.\n\n**We will start accepting applications for Cohort 1 in late June. [Sign up here for updates on the application process.](https://creatorcabins.ck.page/9e628caec5)**\n\n\n\n## 💰 Budget\n\n### 💸 Costs: 5 ETH + 1500 $CABIN per cohort\n\nWe currently have 15.6 ETH and 15.6k $CABIN in the treasury. This is enough for us to cover three 4-week cohorts at a budget of 5 ETH + 1500 $CABIN per cohort. This will cover the following expenses:\n\n- *1 ETH per week*: renting out the full Creator Cabins property (including both cabins, high-speed internet, utilities, and cleaning). The market rate for the cabins is more than this, but we know a guy 😉\n- *0.25 ETH + 250 $CABIN*: stipend for each creator in the cohort to cover food and gas costs to mint the end-of-program NFT\n- *500 $CABIN*: stipend for the camp counselor for each cohort\n\n\n### 🪂 Airdrop\n\nWe are also planning to airdrop 500 $CABIN each to @p_millerd and @kadlac for their OG contributions before we even officially set up the crowdfund:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kadlac/status/1394149045757571078\n\n\n## 🔮 Long-term plans\n\nWe are [leaving the crowdfund open](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ) so that we can continue to raise additional funds for future cohorts and allow new members to join the DAO. We also hope to raise additional sustainable funds for the program through splits on sales of NFTs produced by residents. \n\nWhile the first use-case for this DAO is creator residencies, we will learn from this experiment and continue to find ways to sustainably fund independent online creators and develop DAO-based governance models for physical spaces.\n\nWe would love your feedback and contributions to this project!
