And yet we want to avail ourselves of solar energy to benefit from the economics of solar, to reduce our carbon footprint, and to increase the resiliency of our property.\n\nSo we are reaching out to some community solar developers in NYC who have built out solar infrastructure that the community can participate in.\n\nI’ve been interested in community solar for a while now. It makes sense to me that a group of people can build and participate in a solar installation where it most makes sense and then share in the energy that installation generates.\n\nCommunity solar works best when a consumer can receive a credit on their electrical bill for their community solar output. This is possible in the states that have deregulated their electrical systems.\n\nAt USV we think community solar represents an interesting way to participate in the renewable energy business and we are looking at a few opportunities now and would like to look at more.\n", "timestamp": 1623069928, "digest": "uhcWwuo64SOcTxKY9-Ir787uf1GlIpNug22jPefSf6E", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

EndaomentでオンチェーンのDonor-Advised Fund（DAF）というアカウントを作ります。これはチャリティ用の口座のようなものです。寄付者の基本的な情報を入力して、トランザクションを作ります。\n2.  そのコントラクト・アカウントに暗号通貨を入金します。基本どのトークンでも送ることができ、Uniswapを介してUSDCに変換され、入金されます。\n3.  入金後は、米国の非営利団体を選んで寄付することができます。\n\nその後Endaomentが、寄付を受け取る側の非営利団体に連絡を取り、寄付額を送金するそうです。\n\n寄付先を自分で決めることができ、かつ税額控除の対象となるのは需要がありそうですし、寄付を促進する良いプロジェクトになるかもしれません。\n\nまたEndaomentのように、オンチェーンでファンドやDAOを作ったり、法人と紐付けるというソリューションが徐々に増えてきましたが、今後より普及していきそうです。\n\n　\n　\n２．[Union Square Ventures Values Crypto Publishing Tool Mirror at $100 Million](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/union-square-ventures-values-crypto-publishing-tool-mirror-at-100-million?utm_content=article-5720\\&utm_campaign=article_email\\&utm_source=sg\\&utm_medium=email)\n\nCoinbaseの初期から投資家である Union Square Ventures（USV）が、メディアプラットフォーム「[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)」に$100Mドルという高い評価額で投資したと報じる記事です。\n\n設立から1年のMirrorは、USVや a16z などの投資家から、最近の2回の調達で少なくとも$10Mドルを調達しているとのことです。\n\nMirrorについては、何度かBspeak!で登場していますが、a16zの元パートナーのデニス・ナザロフ氏が設立したプラットフォームです。記事上にNFTを表示できたり、NFTを発行しクラウドファンディングが実施できたり、オークションが実施できたり、その収益を協力者に自動配布することができます。このあたりは[2021年5月10日号](https://bspeak.substack.com/p/mirror-nft-upshotone-uniswap-v3-nft)もご参照ください。実はこのBspeak!も、Mirror上で同じ内容を投稿しています（[Bspeak! — Mirror](https://bspeak.mirror.xyz/)）。またコンテンツは、Arweaveというチェーンに保存されるため、プラットフォームによって削除される心配がなく、その点を気に入っているライターもいます。\n\nそんなMirrorが、設立からわずか1年で高い評価額をつけている点を見ると、NFTクリエイターエコノミーに対する投資家の関心が高いことがわかります。特にa16zはこの分野に熱心です。\n\nソーシャルトークンのRallyや、NBA Top ShotのDapper Labs、他にもOpenSeaやBitCloutにも投資をしてます。BitCloutは、ユーザーが個人に投資し、その個人の人気が高まるにつれて報酬を得ることができるソーシャルメディアです。\n\nMirrorはまだ収益を上げていませんが、将来的には、Mirror上のNFTの販売から収益を得るなり、ライター向け機能を有料化するなどでマネタイズできると思います。またトークン発行という道もあります。\n\n#### **DAOと、NFTドリブンのニュースレター**\n\n個人的には、Mirrorが単なるメディアプラットフォームでないと思う点は2つあります。\n\n1つはDAOが誕生する場所になっている点です。例えば、クラウドファンディングで支援してくれたら、その資金はDAOに渡り、支援者にはトークンが配られる、という小規模なDAOの組成の例が出てきています。具体的には[PartyDAO](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4)や、[CabinDAO](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ)などです。\n\nもう1つの面白い点は、NFTを利用したニュースレターです。実験的にですが、先週ジャーナリストであるKyle Chayka氏は、エンタメ系のニュースレターのマスコットキャラ「Dirty」のNFTを、Mirrorで発行し、約3万ドルを集めました。　\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b509a0-22b2-441c-aa91-c1224e13ee54\\_435x432.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b509a0-22b2-441c-aa91-c1224e13ee54\\_435x432.png)\n\nMirror創業者のデニス・ナザロフ氏は以下のように[ツイート](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1398063972344119300)しています。\n\n> クリプトは、以下の間の境界を曖昧にします：\n>\n> *   アート\n> *   コレクタブル\n> *   エクイティ\n> *   グッズ\n> *   ソーシャルメディア\n> *   支援\n>\n> もしミッキーマウスのフィギュアが、ディズニーの金銭的利害関係を表しているとしたら? Dirtyと$DIRTトークンで実験が始まっています。 \n\nニュースレターというビジネスが成功すれば、マスコットのNFTの価値も高まる可能性があります。それを実験しているのがこのNFTドリブンのニュースレターなのです。\n\nそうするとNFTは、グッズでもあり、クリエーターの支援でもあり、ビジネスの成功によって価値が変動するならエクイティ的でもあり、どの性質とも関連する”なにか”と言えます。\n　\n　\n３．[Jack Dorsey defends his decentralization beliefs during bitcoin conference appearance](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/107341/jack-dorsey-defends-his-decentralization-beliefs-during-bitcoin-conference-appearance)\n\nマイアミで大きなBitcoinカンファレンスが行われました。久しぶりのオフラインのイベントということで会場は盛り上がっていたようです。\n\nその中で、Twitter創業者・Squire創業者のジャック・ドーシーが、「Banking the Unbanked」と題した講演の中で、ビットコインへの情熱を話しました。YouTubeに動画も上がっているので、ぜひ見てみてください。\n\nジャックは、「ビットコインをインターネットのためのネイティブな通貨にする」というコミットメントを改めて表明し、「実現するためにできることはすべてやる」、「私が生きている間に、これほど重要な仕事はないと思う」と意気込みを伝えています。\n\n#### **スクエア社のウォレットの発表**\n\nまた登壇の数分前に、ノンカストディアルのハードウェアウォレットの構築にスクエアが関心を持っていることを発表しました。ハードウェアウォレットと競合したいのではなく、次のレベルに引き上げて、多くの人に届けたいだけということのようです。\n\n#### **ジャックへの批判**\n\n対談の途中に、極右派のアクティビストで元連邦議会議員候補のローラ・ルーマー氏が、ジャック・ドーシー氏を遮り、オーディエンスの席から叫びはじめました。このあたりです。\nhttps://youtu.be/rSSnyJpFNZU\n\n\nそして「あなたは検閲のキングなのに、どうしてビットコインが世界のみんなの通貨だと言えるのか」と批判しました。\n\n背景としては、Twitterがこのローラ・ルーマー氏を含め利用規約に違反しているとみなした者のアカウントを停止していることがあります。\n\n#### **Bluesky**\n\nその後話題はすぐに、Twitter社が取り組んでいるソーシャルメディア規格のプロジェクト「Bluesky」に移ります。\n\nBlueskyは、完全にビットコインからインスパイアされ、ビットコインと同じことをソーシャルメディアでやり、今のTwitterにある制限はなくすと語り、「あなたが信じてくれないでしょう、あなたは嘘つきだと言うでしょう、でも私が証明します」と話しました。この部分は、皆さんにもぜひ見てほしいと思います。\n\nまたソーシャルメディア規格の話でいうと、ブロックチェーンを利用したソーシャルメディアはいつか大きくなると思っています。なぜなら、\n\n*   immutability（改ざん耐性）\n*   censorship resistance（検閲耐性）\n*   composability（組み合わせ）\n*   built-in payment（支払い）\n*   user owened（ユーザ所有・ガバナンス）\n\nなどの性質が今のソーシャルメディアの課題を解決するのにぴったりだからです。\n　\n　\n４．[El Salvador To Declare Bitcoin As Legal Tender - Bitcoin Magazine: Bitcoin News, Articles, Charts, and Guides](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-to-declare-bitcoin-as-legal-tender)\n\nマイアミのBitcoin 2021カンファレンスの話題をもう１つ。\n\nCovid以降2年ぶりくらいの久々のオフラインのイベントで、多くの人が集まるため、毎年NYで行われていたConsesusのように、この大きなイベント合わせて何か大きな発表をしてくるところがあるだろうと思っていたのですが、やはり非常に大きな発表がありました。\n\nもう知っている人も多いと思いますが、エルサルバドルのネイブ・ブケレ大統領が、ビットコインを法定通貨として宣言することを発表したのです。「来週、ビットコインを法定通貨にする法案を議会に送ります」とビデオメッセージで発表しています。\n\nエルサルバドルでは、人口の70％以上が銀行口座を持っていないという事実もあり、以前からビットコインの支払いが流行っていた国の１つです。　\n\nこの件については、元ワイオミング州のBlockchainタスクフォースのCaitlin Longの[ツイート](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\\_/status/1401334423010824198)を紹介します。　\n\n> 1/ Bitcoinの歴史的な日についてのスレッド\n>\n> エルサルバドル大統領がBTCを法定通貨にする法案への支持を表明。もし、それが法制化されれば、多くの副次的な効果をもたらすだろう。この件で大きな争いが起こるかもしれないので、気を引き締めましょう。\n\n> 2/ エルサルバドルの政治については何も知らないが、世界が圧力をかけようとする（詳細は以下を参照）。その前に、ブケレ大統領、@JackMallers、@Blockstreamの3者がこのプロジェクトを成功させたことに心から敬意を表します。みんな、これは本当にすごいことだ🙏👋\n\n> 3/ OK 掘り下げていきましょう。要約としては、もしElSalvador がビットコインを法定通貨にする法案を採択した場合、ビットコインは、\n>\n> ・おそらく「貨幣」としての地位を得るので、銀行では外国通貨と同等に扱われる。\\\n> ・USGAAP/IFRSで「現金」会計処理を受ける可能性がある（BTCの不利な会計処理を解決する）。\n\n> 4/ だからこそ、これは激しい戦いになりそうだ：銀行がビットコインを扱えるようにするための裏ワザとなるかもしれないし、また、ビットコインの低価法（不利な会計処理）を解決できるかもしれない。また、政治化した米国の移民議論も影響してくる。現職議員はこれを阻止しようとするでしょう。\n\n> 5/ そもそも「法定通貨」とは何でしょうか？これは商法の用語です。\\\n> （市民は、財産を引き渡す代わりに、支払いとして法定通貨Xを提示されたら、受け入れなければならないという意味です）。法定通貨は、法体系の基礎となる商法のカギを握っています。\n\n> 6/ 2018年、ワイオミング州の一部の人は、ワイオミング州がすでに金と銀で行っていたように、ビットコインを法定通貨にしようとした。米国憲法第1条第10項には金と銀が明記されていますが、それ以外のものを米国内で法定通貨にするには、米国憲法を改正する必要があります。\n\n> 7/ つまり、米国憲法を改正せずにビットコインを米国内で法定通貨にすることは不可能だったのです。当時私は、他の国がそれを行うかもしれないと考えていました。\n>\n> そうすることでビットコインを\\\n> 商法上では「お金」、\\\n> 会計上の「現金」、\\\n> として扱うようになる可能性がありました。\n\n> 8/ 明確にしておきますが、私は会計士ではないので、経験に基づく推測です。会計士の皆さん、ご意見をお聞かせください。ビットコインは \"無期限の無形資産\"として扱われ、低価法が適用されますが、外国通貨の場合は時価評価されます。その場合はマイクロストラテジーのマイケル・セイラーが喜ぶ。\n\n> 9/ そして、もし私が正しければ、他の企業の財務担当者も、懲罰的な会計処理に直面することなく、ビットコインを購入することができます。つまり他の外国通貨と同様に会計処理することができます。不利な会計処理がなくなる＝ビットコインを保有する企業が増える、というわけです。しかし、会計士の皆さん、教えてください!\n\n> 10/ 法律の話に戻ります。商法は、財産を交換する際の当事者の権利と義務を規定し、裁判官が紛争を裁くためのロードマップを確立します。@Andrea_Tosatoは、最初に以下を発見しました。\\\n> \\==\\\n> エルサルバドルが実際に先に進み、ビットコインを法定通貨として認めた場合、ビットコインは、UCC § 1-201の下で「money」になります\\\n> \\==\n\n> 11/ もうおわかりですね。もしエルサルバドル がビットコインを法定通貨として認める法案を可決した場合、BTC は米国商法の下で「MONEY」となる可能性が高い。\n>\n> (https\\://law\\.cornell.edu/ucc/1/1-201: \"Moneyとは、国内外の政府によって承認または採用されている交換手段を意味する”)\n\n> 12/ なぜ重要なのか？それは、ビットコインが、世界の銀行システムで特別な地位を得ることを意味します。銀行はビットコインを他の外国通貨と同じように扱うでしょう。銀行の自己資本規制（Basel3など）の元で、ビットコインが有利な扱いを受ける可能性があります。\n\n> 13/　エルサルバドルが発表したことで、他の国も追随する可能性があります。2008年の金融危機以前から徐々に脱ドル化を進めてきたロシアがその候補として考えられています。外交政策の動きを見るのはとても興味深いですね。\n\n> 14/ どのような結果になろうとも、ビットコインにとっては歴史的な日であり、普及を進めることになる。関係者全員にとって素晴らしいことです。皆さん、おめでとうございます--特に、エルサルバドルの人々に!🇸🇻💪\n　\n　\n５．[New DeFi DAO Relies on ‘Talent Hunters’ to Vet Yield Farming](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-dao-talent-hunters-yield-farming)\n\n初心者が流動性マイニングによってリターンを得られるようにするための資産管理DAO「[AladdinDAO](https://aladdin.club/)」が公開されました。Huobiの元幹部が主導し、Multicoin CapitalやPolychain CapitalなどのVCやエンジェル投資家が参加しています。\n\nAladdinDAOでは、「ブールメンバー」というコアなメンバーが有望なDeFiプロジェクトを選びます。\n\nブールメンバーになるには、タレント・ハンターズという初期15名メンバー（Polychain Capital、Digital Currency Group、Multicoin Capital、Alamedaなど）から推薦される必要があります。\n\nそしてこのVCやエンジェル投資家のブールメンバーに目利きしてもらって、情報の非対称性を軽減し、コミュニティに良いDeFiイールドを提供することを目標としているようです。\n\nまだ動いてみないと判断できませんが、「Yearnに、人間による目利き要素を加えたようなプロジェクト」のように思えます。\n\n#### **DAOでの提案**\n\nまたAladdinDAOのネイティブトークンであるAladdinトークン（ALD）は、メンバーがベストなプロジェクトを選び、投票するためのインセンティブとして利用されます。\n\n誰でもAladdinDAOに提案書を提出して、AladdinDAOとして利用すべき流動性プールや特定のプロジェクトをリクエストすることができます。提案書を提出するためには、提案者は2,000ALDの手数料を支払う必要があります。\n\nその後、ブールメンバーによる検討と、投票が始まります。\n\n#### **提案後の投票**\n\nブールメンバーの票数は、毎月4票と限られているため、より吟味して投票するように促されます。もし投票で、十分なコンセンサスが得られた場合、流動性マイニングのためAladdinDAOプラットフォームに掲載されます。\n\nこの十分なコンセンサスとは、\n\n*   ブールメンバーの50％が投票し賛成票が反対票より多い場合\\\n    or\n*   ブールメンバーの50％が投票してないときは賛成票が反対票より20％多い場合\n\nとなります。\n\nもし、ブールメンバーの一人が強く反対した場合、その人は ALD トークン・ホルダー全員による投票を要求することができます。20%以上の流通しているトークン・ホルダーが参加し、51%以上の賛成があれば、ブールの決定を覆すことができるそうです。\n\nちなみにALDトークンは、大半が流動性マイニング用に割当られていますが、LBPやAirdropでも配布するようです。\n\n[![f:id:CoffeeTimes:20210606153227p:plain](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc65ca245-26ca-4921-827e-fe3bd55c7c07\\_674x615.png

Foundation Launches Solana-Based NFT Marketplace](https://www.coindesk.com/metaplex-foundation-launches-solana-based-nft-marketplace)\n\nMetaplex Foundationが、SolanaとMetaplexプロトコル上にNFTマーケットプレイスを立ち上げました。\n\nMetaplexでは、アーティストが、独自のNFT販売サイトを構築することができます。NFTマーケットプレイスのShopifyやWordpressとも言えます。また、アーティストはオンラインオークションを開催することができ、売り手と買い手が中間業者を介さずに直接取引できるようになります。\n\nすでにHeliumというプロトコルのチームも[NFTの販売サイトを作成しています](https://zodiac.helium.com/)。\n\n#### **利点**\n\nMetaplexで発行されたNFTは、1回限りの手数料でArweaveのブロックチェーンに保存されます。またクリエーターは、パフォーマンスや収益などのデータにアクセスでき、支払いも自動的に行われます。\n\n決済のために取引所FTXと提携していて、ユーザーはFTX Payを使うことでクレジットカードや暗号通貨でNFTを購入できるようになります。\n　\n　\n７．[Sherlock raises $1.5M for new model to protect DeFi users from smart contract exploits](https://sherlock-protocol.medium.com/sherlock-raises-1-5m-for-new-model-to-protect-defi-users-from-smart-contract-exploits-8082160e3099)\n\nDeFiのリスク分析システム、DeFi保険システムである[Sherlock（シャーロック）](https://sherlock.xyz/)が、プレシード資金調達ラウンドで$1.5Mドルを調達しました。\n\nIDEO CoLab Venturesが主導し、A.Capital Ventures、Scalar Capital、DeFi Allianceが参加しています。また主要プロトコルの創設者、流動性プロバイダー、セキュリティ専門家などのエンジェル投資家が入っています。\n\n#### **特徴**\n\nシャーロックの特徴は、(1)代表チームがリスク評価をする点、(2)組み込み型で補償手続きが簡単、の２点です。\n\n(1)については後述しますが、スマートコントラクトのセキュリティの専門家を利用して、シャーロックがDeFiプロトコルに付随するリスクを評価し、価格設定をします。\n\n(2)については、攻撃の際に補償を受けたいユーザの視点から見た時に、わざわざ別のページへいって、別途保険プロトコルに対して申請をする、という手続きが必要ないように、組み込み式にしていくそうです。\n\n#### **シャーロックの仕組み**\n\nシャーロックのエコシステムには、主に3つの参加者がいます。\n\n[![f:id:CoffeeTimes:20210606153942p:plain](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb67d6cde-6fda-4747-852a-ace64f4d47db\\_938x430.png

  DeFiプロトコルからの手数料\n*   レンディングプロトコルでの運用利息\n*   SHER（ガバナンストークン）のインセンティブ報酬\n\nしかしリスクもあって、シャーロックのカバーするプロトコルで攻撃が起きて補償が必要になった場合、ステーカーの資金は一部 or すべてが清算されます。その代わり、リスクに見合った高いAPYが支払われます。\n\n**３．シャーロックのセキュリティチーム（上図の中央）**\n\nシャーロックのセキュリティチームは、1で書いたように、保険価格の決定のために評価をします。評価分野には、プロトコルのスマートコントラクト、アーキテクチャ、アップグレード可能性のリスク、経済的リスク、プロトコルの依存性（コンポーザビリティ）、オラクル操作のリスク、管理者キーのリスク、安全なコードを出荷するためのプロセス、などがあります。\n\n根本的なリスク分析をするのも大変ですし、それを多くのプロトコルでうやるのも大変と思いますが、ユーザ側から見れば使いやすい保険となり得るかもしれません。\n　\n　\n８．[Crypto Credit Rating Firm Credmark Pivots to Modeling DeFi Protocol Risks](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-credit-scoring-credmark-pivots-evaluating-defi-protocols)\n\nクリプトのレンディングのスコアレポート「Crypto Credit

Capitalなどから$5.5Mドルを調達しました。\n\n今回ピボットし、API3を利用したDeFiスコアリングのプラットフォームを立ち上げようとしているそうで、6月15日にはトークン配布を[予定しています](https://www.credmark.com/blog/liquidity-swap-drop)。\n　\n　\n９．[DeFi oracle protocol Lithium raises $5 million, led by Pantera and Hashed](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/106747/defi-oracle-protocol-lithium-5-million-pantera-hashed)\n\n[Lithium Finance](https://lith.finance/)は、$5Mドルのシードラウンドを完了しました。Pantera CapitalとHashedがリードとなり、Alameda Research、Huobi Ventures Blockchain Fund、OKExのBlockdream Ventures、NGC Ventures、LongHash Ventures、Genesis Block Venturesなどが参加しました。\n\nLithiumは、プライベート資産（非流動資産）の価格オラクルを開発します。どのように取引のされていない資産の価格発見をするかというと、参加者が選択式の質問をされて、その答えを集約することで非流動性資産の価格を見つけます。\n\nまた他のオラクルトークン同様に、Lithium Tokens (LITH)をステークすることで、参加者に報酬と罰則を与えることで成り立ちます。\n\nIPO前の株式やプライベートエクイティなど、非流動的なプライベート資産の価格発見をすることがメインの、予測市場&オラクルのプロジェクトといえます。やりたいことはFluxとかなり近いです。\n　\n　\n１０．[Data privacy-focused NFT startup raises $2.3M in seed funding](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/107329/data-privacy-focused-nft-startup-raises-2-3-million-in-seed-funding)\n\nブロックチェーンスタートアップの[Snickerdoodle Labs](https://www.snickerdoodlelabs.io/)は、シードファンディングで$2.3Mドルを調達しました。\n\n今回のラウンドはKeneticが主導し、Blockchain Capital、Struck Ventures、Zilliqa Capital、FTX、Sam Bankman-Fried、Tribe Capital、Zinal Growthが参加しました。\n\nPayPalの元ブロックチェーン戦略責任者であるジョナサン・パディラが共同で設立した企業で、NFTをつかって、プライバシーとデータを保護しつつユーザがマネタイズできるようなプラットフォームの構築を目指しているようです。他に公開情報がないので、どのようなものか全く分かりませんが、記事によると今年の夏にトークン配布をする予定だそうです。\n　\n　\n１１．[Solana

CapitalがSolana財団と共同で、韓国でのエコシステムの拡大を促進するための$20Mドルのファンドを立ち上げたことを発表しました。\n\nまた、アジア拠点のVCのMaster Venturesは、Polkadotのパラチェーンを目指すプロジェクトに投資をする[$30Mドルのファンドを立ち上げています](https://www.coindesk.com/master-ventures-launches-polkadot-fund)。Polkadot上とKusama上で有望なプロジェクトに投資するということです。\n\nさらにAU21 Capitalは、Polygonで構築されたプロジェクトに投資するために、[$21Mドルのファンドを開始しました](https://www.coindesk.com/au21-capital-opens-polygon-fund)。AU21は、資金面でのバックアップに加えて、事業開発やマーケティングのサポートも行います。資金だけでは差別化にならないので、こういったスタンスを明確にして発信することで投資先にアプローチしやすくしています。\n\n以下の『Subscribe』を押すと毎週月曜6:30に届きます。ご登録ください☕\n\nぜひシェアお願いします🎉🎉\n\n[Share](https://bspeak.substack.com/p/nft-btc?utm_source=substack\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_content=share\\&action=share)\n\n☕ Twitter：[@CoffeeTimesTW](https://twitter.com/CoffeeTimesTW)\n\n☕

{"id": "X0SdK6IwtcCAfp-rVxf8PxrGMt019NPNkxHAdqyQXRk", "title": "The difference between Public Goods Problems and  Coordination Problems… and whether it matters. ", "body": "> By [Michael Zargham](https://twitter.com/mZargham), [Scott Moore](https://twitter.com/notscottmoore), and [Matt Stephenson](https://twitter.com/stephensonhmatt) (author order randomized)\n\nPublic Goods Problems and Coordination Problems describe some of the most fundamental and important challenges we face both in Web3 and the wider world. While they are related concepts, **they are theoretically distinct**. Is this a distinction without a difference? In this note we explore why game theorists and even behavioral economists (like one of your co-authors) make such a distinction. We will describe what the difference is and why it might matter.\n\nLet’s begin with a simple example:\n\n*Suppose you’re at a concert and everyone is comfortably sitting down and enjoying the performance. Suddenly people several rows in front of you start standing up to get a better view, which makes everyone behind them need to stand. Now, while you’re still comfortable in your seat, you can’t see anything. So you give up and stand too.*\n\nNow let’s analyze the situation: nobody’s view has actually improved by standing instead of sitting--the backs of people’s heads are just as in-the-way as they were before. But now everyone is less comfortable. We have thus moved to a less optimal outcome. And worse still the situation is more sticky,  more “equilibrium-ey”[1] if you will. Initially we all stood because just a single person standing could affect everyone behind them, totally changing things. **But now if someone sits it doesn’t really matter**--we all just have to stand to see over everyone else standing in front us. To solve the problem, perhaps we could get everyone to sit at the same time.\n\nThis sounds like a coordination problem, right? Not so fast!\n\nIt’s only coordination if “everyone sitting” is a stable equilibrium. And so as we've defined it, getting everyone to sit again isn't actually a solution. **This is the essential difference between Public Goods Problems and Coordination Problems: in a Coordination Problem the optimal outcome is stable, whereas in a Public Goods Problem the optimal outcome is not.** More technically, we can say that coordination games exhibit multiple pareto-ranked equilibria which include the social optimum ([Dutta, 2012](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/gamebe/v76y2012i2p519-534.html)) whereas public goods games have a non-equilibrium social optimum ([Hichri & Kirman 2007](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/journl/halshs-00161572.html)).\n\nIf you find that confusing don’t worry-- **there was literally an oscar-winning movie about John Nash that got this wrong**. In A Beautiful Mind, when it came time to describe the Nash Equilibrium (Nash’s defining contribution) the movie instead discussed an unstable non-Nash outcome just like the “sitting down at a concert” example. [You can watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJS7Igvk6ZM).\n\nThe distinction to be made is that, unlike a coordination game, our concert example and Russell Crowe’s bar-room musings in the movie both feature an “incentive to defect” (aka the “free rider problem.”) In the concert example, when everyone else sits down and *you stand you actually do get a better view*.[2] Or using the movie’s dated example, when your friends go for the brunettes and don’t “block” you, you are actually clear to “go for the blonde.” \n\nYou can see in the illustration below that the difference between the two games depends precisely on the relative magnitude of the “defect” payoff. The Public Goods game on the left can be transformed into the coordination game on the right with a single change: reducing the payoff to the defector (circled in red).[3]\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d253f4ab-d379-4a76-bba1-2ad4c4e24176.jpeg?height=696&width=1600)\n\nBut this means that, having defined the concert problem as a Public Goods game, it doesn’t matter if you get your bullhorn out and coordinate everyone back into their seats. Someone will always stand back up. And soon we will all be standing again. **That’s what it means to have a “non-equilibrium social optimum”--you can see it, you just can’t live in it.** \n\nBut that’s just the problem as we’ve defined it. Is that actually the problem?\n\n# What game is it?\n\nLet’s pause and reflect for a second.\n\nWe are not trying to convince you that you can’t make people sit down at concerts. Nor do we care about the semantic differences between “coordination” vs. “public goods” problems. This difference matters, we contend, because the public goods framework is good for stating problems and the coordination framework is good for conceptualizing solutions. \n\n**The likely reason that A Beautiful Mind got the Nash Equilibrium wrong is that Public Goods problems almost always present to us humans as, well... problems.** That is, when we see them we are often drawn to solving them. And here’s where you’re going to start to feel the edges of not just game theory but any sort of human-regarding theory.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/602f8fee-78e3-45cc-a19e-31a69a438529.jpeg?height=566&width=1252)\n\nThe mind balks at Public Goods Problems. “Don’t you see” you want to ask, incredulous, “that if you stand up, soon everyone will stand up and your view will be the same as before but now you’re less comfortable?” That’s what a public goods problem *feels like*. **Let’s live in them for a little bit and feel their power before we move on and discuss how to solve them.**\n\nThe prototypical Public Goods game has been run in a laboratory setting countless times. Run it with more than a few players and “players do not, in general, manage to coordinate on cooperative behaviour” (ibid.) Worse still is that, unlike some two-person games, repeating these games doesn’t help. In fact, cooperation typically gets worse over time as you can see in the figure below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4cc9f230-3cb9-4498-95e3-215cbc6b4a28.jpeg?height=423&width=809)\n\nThe way a laboratory public goods game works is: everyone gets some money, say 10 people get $20.00 each, which they can contribute to the public pool or keep. The experimenters then increase the money everyone contributes by e.g. another 20% which is split among everyone in the game. Crucially, this split happens for everyone, whether they contributed or not.[4] \n\nOn the graph above you can see the average “contribution” on the y-axis, with rounds on the x-axis.[5] And have a look at period 1 up there on the left, where most everyone is hopeful and optimistic and so the average contribution is quite high. Everyone does pretty well. What goes wrong to make everything unravel? \n\nHaving personally run, and participated in, these public goods experiments many times one of your co-authors can explain what’s largely going on here. To get a feel for it, here’s what this game looks like with four players:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f99f0d43-7f25-4de3-b38f-2e97eb4df743.jpeg?height=654&width=722)\n\nLook familiar? It’s that annoying “incentive to defect” again (circled in red). What’s happening is that the free rider is not excluded from receiving the “common pool” split. And since they also get to keep the $20 they didn’t contribute, this means they always make the most money. And then in the next rounds this happens again and again, the gap growing ever wider.\n\nAfter a few rounds your fellow contributors are starting to get a little pissed off. They believe in the common good, sure. **But you can’t just sit back and allow these free riders to make everyone a sucker like this can you?** The unraveling of cooperation that you see in experimental chart is often the “we’re not going to be suckers” feeling spreading through a population. \n\nThat may look a bit depressing, but there’s some good news too. For one thing, even if you repeat this for a very long time, there is typically ~10% of the population who never give up the faith and just continue to contribute no matter what. These are the saints. For another, if you just shuffle the players and start the whole game over you’ll notice something amazing; most everyone regains their optimism. It looks about like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/252e4594-fb8e-487c-b1a9-c9d59f062807.jpeg?height=282&width=1096)\n\n**That is, in each period 1 you get this “restarting” effect as everyone tries to jump start cooperation again.** Hope springs eternal! Of course, because they are playing a true Public Goods game (unfortunately) cooperation devolves again. But this behavior is a crucial building block of a real-world solution. This hope we observe is why we get to try and fail and try again.\n\n# How do we solve these things?\nWe saw that a public goods problem is characterized by an unstable social optimum, vulnerable to individual incentives to defect. But we also saw the experimental evidence that some people never give up, and that in a new game most everyone will try again to reach the social optimum, hoping that maybe this time the unstable outcome will be stable. They are hoping, we might say, that this time the Public Goods game will turn out to be a Coordination game.\n\nWith that in mind, we can propose an ad hoc hierarchy for solving these problems. Speaking roughly, a public goods problem is solved by transforming/reimagining it to be a coordination problem:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/20b25e5f-830c-4c67-acf8-fe8f2f347303.jpeg?height=1236&width=1600)\n\nStarting from the top right you have the best possible solution concept, called a “Prisoner’s Delight.” It means that the socially optimal outcome is the *only* stable equilibrium! This is not even a coordination game--it’s a solved problem. Whereas we saw that Public Goods Problems almost always strike us humans as problems to be solved, **the Prisoner’s Delight “problem” really doesn’t seem like a problem at all**.\n\nAs a result, our example is going to feel a little silly. A good example might be “setting your house on fire”. Most people don’t want to set their house on fire and so “everyone’s house not on fire” is stable with no incentive to defect. This is the social optimum. And what about the situation where everyone else’s house is on fire, does that make you want to set your house on fire too? Of course not!  Which means there’s not even an equilibrium at “everyone sets their house on fire” because now the temptation is to, well, “not set your house on fire”. Absent insurance shenanigans, “don’t set your house on fire” is the strictly dominant strategy and any deviations from it do not destabilize the system.[6] \n\nSo let’s move down the chart to proper coordination problems (with multiple equilibria). In this world, the equilibria are at least stable once people are in them and so we “just” need to get them there. Making people choose the “good” equilibrium in a coordination problem can be described as making it “focal.” \n\n### Here is a (non-exhaustive) hierarchy of coordination games ranked by how “focal” the equilibrium tends to be, ranked from best to worst:\n1. Payoff Dominance. A preferred equilibrium which provides the highest payoff for all players in the game is extremely focal.[7] If you play a game like this in the lab it will feel silly and hardly like a game at all because everyone does the preferred thing.\n2. Risk Dominance. A preferred equilibrium which is risk dominant is more fragile but can be naturally coordinated on. Picking an action that is risk dominant roughly means that if other players don’t do what you expect you’re still relatively better off than you would have been otherwise (mutatis mutandis).\n3. Inertia. If the preferred equilibrium isn’t payoff dominant (as in #1) or risk dominant (as in #2), you can still make use of the fact that people will just stay with what they’ve done in the past. Thus if you can start there or get people there they may well stay.\n\nIf we keep only to monetary utilities, leaving the behavioral mechanism design out of it, these solution concepts are basically: “Everybody gets rich” (1), “Everybody avoids losing money” (2), and “Who cares about getting rich, let’s just do things the old fashioned way” (3). And, speaking somewhat loosely, [you can actually use the commitment aspect of smart contracts to change the game along these dimensions](https://blog.coinfund.io/can-a-good-smart-contract-beat-blockchains-new-12m-ponzi-yes-in-theory-6964eead5b84).[8]\n\nExpanding to the behavioral sphere our options really open up. Now we can grant, say, social status to coordinators. We can signal disapproval to those who, say, stand up in front of us at a concert.  We could even make “doing things the old-fashioned way” have a sort of identity bonus, an additional utility stemming from the embracing of tradition. \n\nWe might be revealing our bias, but real solutions will often live in the behavioral realm at least to some degree. When you think about solving the “concert problem” from earlier you might be inclined to say to the stander, **“Excuse me but would you mind sitting? The rest of us would prefer it.”** And when they then sit and everyone is better off, whatever kindness, reciprocity, or even shame aversion that person felt that made them sit is what drove the coordinating equilibrium.\n\n**Which is all to say that “transforming” a game along these lines is a fundamentally creative act.** And Lin Ostrom’s work reminds us that creative solutions abound, and that communities can solve what look to outsiders like Public Goods problems (thereby demonstrating that they are actually coordination problems.) Ostrom was the essential inspiration for our solution concepts above, reimagining Public Goods games as Coordination games.[9]\n\n### Do Public Goods Problems Actually Exist?\nThe Public Goods framing remains invaluable, at least insofar as it captures what a social problem *feels like* before it is solved. Each of us knows there are situations in which we can all see the social optimum but can’t quite figure out how to get there yet. The sink full of dishes that all the roommates would like to have washed but would rather someone else do it. \n\nAnd we also know there are situations where we think we’ve reached a solution, only to find it’s unstable--we can feel the frustration after we whip all the roommates into a Sunday morning cleaning frenzy to finally get all the dishes washed... only to watch over time as the sink fills back up with the roommates nowhere to be found. **This is the frustration of the would-be coordinator discovering that they’re still playing a Public Goods game.**\n\nOn the other hand we can’t help but feel -- watching people unhappily standing up at a concert, [writing valuable code in a private repository](https://medium.com/gitcoin/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gitcoin-fe2e3e292a21), or [failing to develop scientific ideas](https://s.mirror.xyz/vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg) -- that there must be solutions. And it’s comforting to know that earnest attempts to solve these problems may be met by the hopefulness we saw in the experiments, the inextinguishable belief that maybe this time we can all get to the social optimum and stay there. \n\nIn the end, “what game are we playing” is not really an answerable question. To the pure game theorist, the idea that you can “reimagine” a public goods game as something else is nonsensical--it’s either a public goods problem or it isn’t. In that light, let’s choose to imagine that all Public Goods problems are just Coordination Problems in disguise. And so let’s solve them. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ba9424f4-617c-4347-9e1c-42dafe9c5d28.jpeg?height=1236&width=1600)\n\n**Endnotes**\n[1] Zargham would like his discomfort with this phrasing noted in the record.\n[2] And, to be slightly technical, the utility you get from the better view is greater than the disutility from not sitting.\n[3] This is a solution concept that we will return to later. And note that you could also, say, transform the game by raising the cooperative payoff above (15, 15).

{"id": "FeWArrP-OSTWdCvhKYJgxnqykldM9xULIoq4xWusUqU", "title": "The difference between Public Goods Problems and  Coordination Problems… and whether it matters. ", "body": "> By [Michael Zargham](https://twitter.com/mZargham), [Scott Moore](https://twitter.com/notscottmoore), and [Matt Stephenson](https://twitter.com/stephensonhmatt) (author order randomized)\n\nPublic Goods Problems and Coordination Problems describe some of the most fundamental and important challenges we face both in Web3 and the wider world. While they are related concepts, **they are theoretically distinct**. Is this a distinction without a difference? In this note we explore why game theorists and even behavioral economists (like one of your co-authors) make such a distinction. We will describe what the difference is and why it might matter.\n\nLet’s begin with a simple example:\n\n*Suppose you’re at a concert and everyone is comfortably sitting down and enjoying the performance. Suddenly people several rows in front of you start standing up to get a better view, which makes everyone behind them need to stand. Now, while you’re still comfortable in your seat, you can’t see anything. So you give up and stand too.*\n\nNow let’s analyze the situation: nobody’s view has actually improved by standing instead of sitting--the backs of people’s heads are just as in-the-way as they were before. But now everyone is less comfortable. We have thus moved to a less optimal outcome. And worse still the situation is more sticky,  more “equilibrium-ey”[1] if you will. Initially we all stood because just a single person standing could affect everyone behind them, totally changing things. **But now if someone sits it doesn’t really matter**--we all just have to stand to see over everyone else standing in front us. To solve the problem, perhaps we could get everyone to sit at the same time.[2]\n\nThis sounds like a coordination problem, right? Not so fast!\n\nIt’s only coordination if “everyone sitting” is a stable equilibrium. And so as we've defined it, getting everyone to sit again isn't actually a solution. **This is the essential difference between Public Goods Problems and Coordination Problems: in a Coordination Problem the optimal outcome is stable, whereas in a Public Goods Problem the optimal outcome is not.** More technically, we can say that coordination games exhibit multiple pareto-ranked equilibria which include the social optimum ([Dutta, 2012](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/gamebe/v76y2012i2p519-534.html)) whereas public goods games have a non-equilibrium social optimum ([Hichri & Kirman 2007](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/journl/halshs-00161572.html)).\n\nIf you find that confusing don’t worry-- **there was literally an oscar-winning movie about John Nash that got this wrong**. In A Beautiful Mind, when it came time to describe the Nash Equilibrium (Nash’s defining contribution) the movie instead discussed an unstable non-Nash outcome just like the “sitting down at a concert” example. [You can watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJS7Igvk6ZM).\n\nThe distinction to be made is that, unlike a coordination game, our concert example and Russell Crowe’s bar-room musings in the movie both feature an “incentive to defect” (aka the “free rider problem.”) In the concert example, when everyone else sits down and *you stand you actually do get a better view*.[2] Or using the movie’s dated example, when your friends go for the brunettes and don’t “block” you, you are actually clear to “go for the blonde.” \n\nYou can see in the illustration below that the difference between the two games depends precisely on the relative magnitude of the “defect” payoff. The Public Goods game on the left can be transformed into the coordination game on the right with a single change: reducing the payoff to the defector (circled in red).[3]\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d253f4ab-d379-4a76-bba1-2ad4c4e24176.jpeg?height=696&width=1600)\n\nBut this means that, having defined the concert problem as a Public Goods game, it doesn’t matter if you get your bullhorn out and coordinate everyone back into their seats. Someone will always stand back up. And soon we will all be standing again. **That’s what it means to have a “non-equilibrium social optimum”--you can see it, you just can’t live in it.** \n\nBut that’s just the problem as we’ve defined it. Is that actually the problem?\n\n# What game is it?\n\nLet’s pause and reflect for a second.\n\nWe are not trying to convince you that you can’t make people sit down at concerts. Nor do we care about the semantic differences between “coordination” vs. “public goods” problems. This difference matters, we contend, because the public goods framework is good for stating problems and the coordination framework is good for conceptualizing solutions. \n\n**The likely reason that A Beautiful Mind got the Nash Equilibrium wrong is that Public Goods problems almost always present to us humans as, well... problems.** That is, when we see them we are often drawn to solving them. And here’s where you’re going to start to feel the edges of not just game theory but any sort of human-regarding theory.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/602f8fee-78e3-45cc-a19e-31a69a438529.jpeg?height=566&width=1252)\n\nThe mind balks at Public Goods Problems. “Don’t you see” you want to ask, incredulous, “that if you stand up, soon everyone will stand up and your view will be the same as before but now you’re less comfortable?” That’s what a public goods problem *feels like*. **Let’s live in them for a little bit and feel their power before we move on and discuss how to solve them.**\n\nThe prototypical Public Goods game has been run in a laboratory setting countless times. Run it with more than a few players and “players do not, in general, manage to coordinate on cooperative behaviour” (ibid.) Worse still is that, unlike some two-person games, repeating these games doesn’t help. In fact, [cooperation typically gets worse over time](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.100.1.541) as you can see in the figure below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4cc9f230-3cb9-4498-95e3-215cbc6b4a28.jpeg?height=423&width=809)\n\nThe way a laboratory public goods game works is: everyone gets some money, say 10 people get $20.00 each, which they can contribute to the public pool or keep. The experimenters then increase the money everyone contributes by e.g. another 20% which is split among everyone in the game. Crucially, this split happens for everyone, whether they contributed or not.[4] \n\nOn the graph above you can see the average “contribution” on the y-axis, with rounds on the x-axis.[5] And have a look at period 1 up there on the left, where most everyone is hopeful and optimistic and so the average contribution is quite high. Everyone does pretty well. What goes wrong to make everything unravel? \n\nHaving personally run, and participated in, these public goods experiments many times one of your co-authors can explain what’s largely going on here. To get a feel for it, here’s what this game looks like with four players:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f99f0d43-7f25-4de3-b38f-2e97eb4df743.jpeg?height=654&width=722)\n\nLook familiar? It’s that annoying “incentive to defect” again (circled in red). What’s happening is that the free rider is not excluded from receiving the “common pool” split. And since they also get to keep the $20 they didn’t contribute, this means they always make the most money. And then in the next rounds this happens again and again, the gap growing ever wider.\n\nAfter a few rounds your fellow contributors are starting to get a little pissed off. They believe in the common good, sure. **But you can’t just sit back and allow these free riders to make everyone a sucker like this can you?** The unraveling of cooperation that you see in experimental chart is often the “we’re not going to be suckers” feeling spreading through a population. \n\nThat may look a bit depressing, but there’s some good news too. For one thing, even if you repeat this for a very long time, there is typically ~10% of the population who never give up the faith and just continue to contribute no matter what. These are the saints. For another, if you just shuffle the players and start the whole game over you’ll notice something amazing; most everyone regains their optimism. It looks about like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/252e4594-fb8e-487c-b1a9-c9d59f062807.jpeg?height=282&width=1096)\n\n**That is, in each period 1 you get this “[restarting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574072207000820)” effect as everyone tries to jump start cooperation again.** Hope springs eternal! Of course, because they are playing a true Public Goods game (unfortunately) cooperation devolves again. But this behavior is a crucial building block of a real-world solution. This hope we observe is why we get to try and fail and try again.\n\n# How do we solve these things?\nWe saw that a public goods problem is characterized by an unstable social optimum, vulnerable to individual incentives to defect. But we also saw the experimental evidence that some people never give up, and that in a new game most everyone will try again to reach the social optimum, hoping that maybe this time the unstable outcome will be stable. They are hoping, we might say, that this time the Public Goods game will turn out to be a Coordination game.\n\nWith that in mind, we can propose an ad hoc hierarchy for solving these problems. Speaking roughly, a public goods problem is solved by transforming/reimagining it to be a coordination problem:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/20b25e5f-830c-4c67-acf8-fe8f2f347303.jpeg?height=1236&width=1600)\n\nStarting from the top right you have the best possible solution concept, called a “Prisoner’s Delight.” It means that the socially optimal outcome is the *only* stable equilibrium! This is not even a coordination game--it’s a solved problem. Whereas we saw that Public Goods Problems almost always strike us humans as problems to be solved, **the Prisoner’s Delight “problem” really doesn’t seem like a problem at all**.\n\nAs a result, our example is going to feel a little silly. A good example might be “setting your house on fire”. Most people don’t want to set their house on fire and so “everyone’s house not on fire” is stable with no incentive to defect. This is the social optimum. And what about the situation where everyone else’s house is on fire, does that make you want to set your house on fire too? Of course not!  Which means there’s not even an equilibrium at “everyone sets their house on fire” because now the temptation is to, well, “not set your house on fire”. Absent insurance shenanigans, “don’t set your house on fire” is the strictly dominant strategy and any deviations from it do not destabilize the system.[6] \n\nSo let’s move down the chart to proper coordination problems (with multiple equilibria). In this world, the equilibria are at least stable once people are in them and so we “just” need to get them there. Making people choose the “good” equilibrium in a coordination problem can be described as making it “focal.” \n\n### Here is a (non-exhaustive & ad hoc) hierarchy of coordination games ranked by how “focal” the equilibrium tends to be, ranked from best to worst:\n1. Payoff Dominance. A preferred equilibrium which provides the highest payoff for all players in the game is extremely focal.[7] If you play a game like this in the lab it will feel silly and hardly like a game at all because everyone does the preferred thing.\n2. Risk Dominance. A preferred equilibrium which is risk dominant is more fragile but can be naturally coordinated on. Picking an action that is risk dominant roughly means that if other players don’t do what you expect you’re still relatively better off than you would have been otherwise (mutatis mutandis).\n3. Inertia. If the preferred equilibrium isn’t payoff dominant (as in #1) or risk dominant (as in #2), you can still make use of the fact that people will just stay with what they’ve done in the past. Thus if you can start there or get people there they may well stay.\n\nIf we keep only to monetary utilities, leaving the behavioral mechanism design out of it, these solution concepts are basically: “Everybody gets rich” (1), “Everybody avoids losing money” (2), and “Who cares about getting rich, let’s just do things the old fashioned way” (3). And, speaking somewhat loosely, [you can actually use the commitment aspect of smart contracts to change the game along these dimensions](https://blog.coinfund.io/can-a-good-smart-contract-beat-blockchains-new-12m-ponzi-yes-in-theory-6964eead5b84).[8]\n\nExpanding to the behavioral sphere our options really open up. Now we can grant, say, social status to coordinators. We can signal disapproval to those who, say, stand up in front of us at a concert.  We could even make “doing things the old-fashioned way” have a sort of identity bonus, an additional utility stemming from the embracing of tradition. \n\nWe might be revealing our bias, but real solutions will often live in the behavioral realm at least to some degree. When you think about solving the “concert problem” from earlier you might be inclined to say to the stander, **“Excuse me but would you mind sitting? The rest of us would prefer it.”** And when they then sit and everyone is better off, whatever kindness, reciprocity, or even shame aversion that person felt that made them sit is what drove the coordinating equilibrium.\n\n**Which is all to say that “transforming” a game along these lines is a fundamentally creative act.** And Lin Ostrom’s work reminds us that creative solutions abound, and that communities can solve what look to outsiders like Public Goods problems (thereby demonstrating that they are actually coordination problems.) Ostrom was the essential inspiration for our solution concepts above, reimagining Public Goods games as Coordination games.[9]\n\n### Do Public Goods Problems Actually Exist?\nThe Public Goods framing remains invaluable, at least insofar as it captures what a social problem *feels like* before it is solved. Each of us knows there are situations in which we can all see the social optimum but can’t quite figure out how to get there yet. The sink full of dishes that all the roommates would like to have washed but would rather someone else do it. \n\nAnd we also know there are situations where we think we’ve reached a solution, only to find it’s unstable--we can feel the frustration after we whip all the roommates into a Sunday morning cleaning frenzy to finally get all the dishes washed... only to watch over time as the sink fills back up with the roommates nowhere to be found. **This is the frustration of the would-be coordinator discovering that they’re still playing a Public Goods game.**\n\nOn the other hand we can’t help but feel -- watching people unhappily standing up at a concert, [writing valuable code in a private repository](https://medium.com/gitcoin/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gitcoin-fe2e3e292a21), or [failing to develop scientific ideas](https://s.mirror.xyz/vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg) -- that there must be solutions. And it’s comforting to know that earnest attempts to solve these problems may be met by the hopefulness we saw in the experiments, the inextinguishable belief that maybe this time we can all get to the social optimum and stay there. \n\nIn the end, “what game are we playing” is not really an answerable question. To the pure game theorist, the idea that you can “reimagine” a public goods game as something else is nonsensical--it’s either a public goods problem or it isn’t. In that light, let’s choose to imagine that all Public Goods problems are just Coordination Problems in disguise. And so let’s solve them. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ba9424f4-617c-4347-9e1c-42dafe9c5d28.jpeg?height=1236&width=1600)\n\n**Endnotes**\n[1] Zargham would like his discomfort with this phrasing noted in the record. The concert example is adapted from Stephan Meier.\n[2] And, to be slightly technical, the utility you get from the better view is greater than the disutility from not sitting.\n[3] This is a solution concept that we will return to later. And note that you could also, say, transform the game by raising the cooperative payoff above (15, 15).

This is the social optimum. And what about the situation where everyone else’s house is on fire, does that make you want to set your house on fire too? Of course not!  Which means there’s not even an equilibrium at “everyone sets their house on fire” because now the temptation is to, well, “not set your house on fire”. Absent insurance shenanigans, “don’t set your house on fire” is the strictly dominant strategy and any deviations from it do not destabilize the system.[6] \n\nSo let’s move down the chart to proper coordination problems (with multiple equilibria). In this world, the equilibria are at least stable once people are in them and so we “just” need to get them there. Making people choose the “good” equilibrium in a coordination problem can be described as making it “focal.” \n\n### Here is a (non-exhaustive & ad hoc) hierarchy of coordination games ranked by how “focal” the equilibrium tends to be, ranked from best to worst:\n1. Payoff Dominance. A preferred equilibrium which provides the highest payoff for all players in the game is extremely focal.[7] If you play a game like this in the lab it will feel silly and hardly like a game at all because everyone does the preferred thing.\n2. Risk Dominance. A preferred equilibrium which is risk dominant is more fragile but can be naturally coordinated on. Picking an action that is risk dominant roughly means that if other players don’t do what you expect you’re still relatively better off than you would have been otherwise (mutatis mutandis).\n3. Inertia. If the preferred equilibrium isn’t payoff dominant (as in #1) or risk dominant (as in #2), you can still make use of the fact that people will just stay with what they’ve done in the past. Thus if you can start there or get people there they may well stay.\n\nIf we keep only to monetary utilities, leaving the behavioral mechanism design out of it, these solution concepts are basically: “Everybody gets rich” (1), “Everybody avoids losing money” (2), and “Who cares about getting rich, let’s just do things the old fashioned way” (3). And, speaking somewhat loosely, [you can actually use the commitment aspect of smart contracts to change the game along these dimensions](https://blog.coinfund.io/can-a-good-smart-contract-beat-blockchains-new-12m-ponzi-yes-in-theory-6964eead5b84).[8]\n\nExpanding to the behavioral sphere our options really open up. Now we can grant, say, social status to coordinators. We can signal disapproval to those who, say, stand up in front of us at a concert.  We could even make “doing things the old-fashioned way” have a sort of identity bonus, an additional utility stemming from the embracing of tradition. \n\nWe might be revealing our bias, but real solutions will often live in the behavioral realm at least to some degree. When you think about solving the “concert problem” from earlier you might be inclined to say to the stander, **“Excuse me but would you mind sitting? The rest of us would prefer it.”** And when they then sit and everyone is better off, whatever kindness, reciprocity, or even shame aversion that person felt that made them sit is what drove the coordinating equilibrium.\n\n**Which is all to say that “transforming” a game along these lines is a fundamentally creative act.** And Lin Ostrom’s work reminds us that creative solutions abound, and that communities can solve what look to outsiders like Public Goods problems (thereby demonstrating that they are actually coordination problems.) Ostrom was the essential inspiration for our solution concepts above, reimagining Public Goods games as Coordination games.[9]\n\n### Do Public Goods Problems Actually Exist?\nThe Public Goods framing remains invaluable, at least insofar as it captures what a social problem *feels like* before it is solved. Each of us knows there are situations in which we can all see the social optimum but can’t quite figure out how to get there yet. The sink full of dishes that all the roommates would like to have washed but would rather someone else do it. \n\nAnd we also know there are situations where we think we’ve reached a solution, only to find it’s unstable--we can feel the frustration after we whip all the roommates into a Sunday morning cleaning frenzy to finally get all the dishes washed... only to watch over time as the sink fills back up with the roommates nowhere to be found. **This is the frustration of the would-be coordinator discovering that they’re still playing a Public Goods game.**\n\nOn the other hand we can’t help but feel -- watching people unhappily standing up at a concert, [writing valuable code in a private repository](https://medium.com/gitcoin/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gitcoin-fe2e3e292a21), or [failing to develop scientific ideas](https://s.mirror.xyz/vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg) -- that there must be solutions. And it’s comforting to know that earnest attempts to solve these problems may be met by the hopefulness we saw in the experiments, the inextinguishable belief that maybe this time we can all get to the social optimum and stay there. \n\nIn the end, “what game are we playing” is not really an answerable question. To the pure game theorist, the idea that you can “reimagine” a public goods game as something else is nonsensical--it’s either a public goods problem or it isn’t. In that light, let’s choose to imagine that all Public Goods problems are just Coordination Problems in disguise. And so let’s solve them. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ba9424f4-617c-4347-9e1c-42dafe9c5d28.jpeg?height=1236&width=1600)\n\n**Endnotes**\n[1] Zargham would like his discomfort with this phrasing noted in the record. The concert example is adapted from Stephan Meier.\n[2] And, to be slightly technical, the utility you get from the better view is greater than the disutility from not sitting.\n[3] This is a solution concept that we will return to later. And note that you could also, say, transform the game by raising the cooperative payoff above (15, 15). The stylized facts about the formal relation between coordination-type games and public goods/PD type games descend from [Luce and Raiffa 1957](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1958-00040-000).\n[4] This feature, called non-excludability, is fundamental to what a public good is.\n[5] The different colored lines represent outcomes across different national populations (almost always students).

Pong, he explained, was a \"video game\" - a kind of electronic sport you could play with friends.\n\nIn the context of Earth 2's history, it was an astonishing invention that seemed to combine insights in multiple fields into something new.

[Lovelace's first program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace#First_computer_program) was published in 1843, long before any machine existed that could execute it. \n\nBut history doesn't always work that way. On Earth 2, the right people weren't born in the right places, and the intellectual currents necessary to *imagine* the computer simply never gathered into a wave, like they did on Earth 1.\n\nBut the basic component technologies did exist, enabling someone like Alan to tinker and experiment. Simple electronic circuits existed, though they were basic and non-interactive. They had evolved out of a more mechanical tradition, used in industrial machines, rather than as an area of mathematical study. Television screens existed, but they were used for one-way communication. The idea of combining a screen with a circuit, enabling a person to *interact with and observe* a kind of game, defined by abstract rules contained within that circuit... this was something completely new. \n\nIt took years, but eventually Pong developed a rapid following. This included table tennis enthusiasts (who saw Pong as an extension of their hobby), to board-game lovers (who liked that you could play it indoors), to electronics nerds (who were interested in the technology). It became clear to this group that this was the beginning of something incredible - an \"electronic\" sport, played on a screen, delivered through the almost miraculous invention of the Pong machine. Each found Pong compelling for different reasons, but they unite under a new identity: Pongers.\n\nAs people begin to learn more about the Pong machine and how it worked, some Pongers began to ask questions.

In theory, some said, one could build a similar device that contained instructions for a \"baseball-like\" game, or a \"football-like\" game. The use of this machine for a tennis-like game seemed arbitrary, simply the result of the passions of its creator, rather than an inherent property of the Pong machine. \n\nSome people began to draw a distinction between \"Pong the game\" and the underlying technology which made it possible - the Pong machine. Pong, they said, is simply a \"program\" - one possible ruleset among many. And theoretically, we could build a version of the Pong machine which could run any arbitrary \"program\". They called such a machine a Computer. People began to speculate about what kinds of things such a \"Computer\" could do.\n\nThe Pongers were outraged. The real innovation was, and remains, Pong.

The Pongers take up a new rallying cry: Pong, not Programs.\n\nFor a while, it seemed like the Pongers might be right. Pong became a huge success, as people all over the world start playing it.

Many of the worlds foremost experts in this new industry of computer architecture and chip design are working on Pong, because it is the most popular computer in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, the Programmers (as they call themselves) struggle.

Granted, that hardly seems efficient since you'll have to write it out *again* on a typewriter to get it onto paper. \n\nAnd two young graduates named [Dan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Bricklin) & [Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Frankston) have a weird idea to use a Computer to edit accounting worksheets - neat, but probably only interesting to accountants. \n\nThe Pongers are confident that Pong will change the world, becoming radically successful and redefining what \"games\" can be. The Programmers are confident that Computers will change the world too, though they have a hard time articulating the size of the addressable market. \n\nWhat happens if they’re both right?\n\n\n*Image: [Rob Boudon - Creative Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Atari_Pong_arcade_game_cabinet.jpg)*", "timestamp": 1623099531, "digest": "8VPxOqJu1UZDDBTn4sxctshFdaZPTFuFRGoat2UJOw8", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}

These poems are the product of that process.\n \nI have always been inspired by William Burroughs and Bryon Gysin’s ideas around how cutting up a text could generate visions of the future or flashes of a deeper truth. When a chaos element got introduced by slicing something up and rescrambling it, the deeper meaning of the words could show up on the surface of the new arrangement. This new layer of meaning could be poetic or divinatory. I've always been interested in divination, and especially since my job as \"trend forecaster\" is a kind of tacky contempo version of divination, it's interesting to me to mix the various spheres where divination goes down: astrology, tarot, cut-ups, data dives, pattern recognition, etc. Introducing randomness in poetic composition has been a persistent theme since Tristan Tzara and Dada, through the Surrealists, hypertext poets and beyond. \n \nOver the summer of 2020, my friend K Allado-Macdowell got their hands on a pilot version of GPT-3, the language model. (Eventually they helped [my project Nemesis write our DOOM! trend report](https://nemesis.global/memos/the-doom-report) using it.) While K started writing an amazing book using GPT-3 at warp speed ([Pharmako-AI, now published by Ignota, here](https://ignota.org/products/pharmako-ai)) they meanwhile indulged me by running fragments of my own poetry and existing poems by writers I loved through the machine, generating text for me to play with. It was all rather astounding and addictive and I looked for a way to work with it directly, since the real thing was only for researchers at the time. \n \nLuckily, that’s when I found out that a game called AI Dungeon, which is a browser-based text roleplaying game, supposedly used GPT-3 as the basis for its premium version, and you could use it to generate texts if you paid the $9/month. So I started making poems using AI dungeon, dodging its role-player-ish verbiage most of the time and trying to get it to present some far-out truths, which it did.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ad9d3716-e893-42e6-9bb7-a0bbf3f5bc11.png?height=1590&width=1588)\n\nOne of my early experiments became the basis for the first poem here, CODE OF HOLES, when the game started describing light as a \"code of holes\" which I found rather dharmic and spooky and appealing. I then took the text generated by interacting with the AI dungeon game and did a Burroughs-style cut-up to it, then edited it into something pithier. Instead of presenting it on a page in the normal way, I justified it in a square and used black emoji as a form of punctuation, since I think it emphasizes the code/hole content motif. The font I used is a nasty free dafont called hole-hearted, another echo of the theme. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e7012e9d-bd18-4d72-bbfd-b14768c9ff49.png?height=1592&width=1596)\n\n\nThe second poem, PLASTIC BEACH, is about having sex with Kylie Jenner. I dreamt I had sex with her in a beach vacation setting surrounded by family, and it included an obscene squirting element. When I woke up I wrote out the dream in order of its events to turn it into a poem but it was too linear, just sounded like badly written erotica. So I ran that text through [an algorithm that mimics Bourroughs-style cutups](http://www.languageisavirus.com/cutupmachine.php) and suddenly it was turned back into a dream, like the cutting and scrambling allowed the dream logic came to the surface again. Bonsai-tree-style pruning and editing followed. There's an influence of the poet Bernadette Mayer here too who worked a lot with dreams and dream logic in her work. You can check out more of Mayer’s writing prompts [here](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/library/Mayer-Bernadette_Experiments.html).\n \nThe font used in the second Folia work is another dafont called PLASTIC BEACH (also the title of the piece) and the background is a photo I took of the sky while tripping on acid on Laguna Beach on the last hot day of summer.\n \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f852bb61-78d7-407a-a007-e13011cf2f37.png?height=1590&width=1580)\n\nThe third piece, THE FUTURIST, came out of my original experimentation with GPT-3 via K. I had asked if GPT-3 could write poetry, and they said yes, but epic poetry, because it did better with longer text samples. Inspired by this, I sent over the first few pages of [The Descent of Alette by Alice Notley](https://poets.org/poem/descent-alette-i-walked), a feminist epic poem and one of my all time favorite books. The Descent of Alette begins in a world where everyone is trapped underground on an infinite subway system. In the world of the book, the “tyrant” stands in for a male supervillain responsible for the suppression of authentic life, and the consciousness of the poem begins to tangle with him. The poem uses a very particular quotation style in which each phrase is bracketed by its own quotation marks – GPT-3 aped this perfectly on the first try, which was eerie, since it’s so unusual. THE FUTURIST is like a riff on one of the tyrant’s moments from the original book, but made kind of fluffier and more treacle-y...a supervillain gone soft in the machine. I edited the original GPT-3 sample considerably and replaced the quotation marks with smiley dingbats (thematically linked to the poem’s smile at the end) and hearts. The font is Futura, obviously! I feel the overall effect is like deep fried Joe Boxer.\n\n \n## MANY THANKS TO...\n\nThe Folia crew – Dan Denorch, Everett Williams, Billy Rennekamp.

They’re in the earliest stages of hiring and resemble structures like co-ops or committees. \n\nEarly contributors carve out their own roles and compensations - loosely resembling [Teal organizations](https://workology.com/what-is-a-teal-organization/) in which every member defines their scope and value to the group.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1390357136815779845?s=20)\n\nThanks to the advent of social tokens and DAOs, communities now have the ability to create shared financial resources.\n\nA DAO provides open access and a vehicle representing ownership. Think of this as a community bank. More times than not, that community will have a shared currency representing ownership of that bank - i.e., a social token.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ljxie/status/1370459278407049223?s=20\n\nAll together, this foundation creates a unique position for a new business class to emerge.\n\n## Enter the Creator Middle Class\n\nThe [creator middle class](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class) are future mom and pop shops. For the past three decades, the internet enabled thousands of communities to emerge. But, the primary beneficiaries continue to be the top 1% while [~97% of YouTube creators](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/02/27/youtube-top-creators-revenue/) make less than the national poverty line.\n\nNiche communities are what make the internet a vibrant and open ecosystem. Within online communities, creators are evolving into SMBs, designed to activate their [1000](https://a16z.com/2021/02/27/nfts-and-a-thousand-true-fans/) or even [100 true fans](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/).\n\nNow the real question becomes - *how do we make the long tail of creators a viable path?*\n\n**In order for a niche community to become a meaningful business, they need to earn income and capture value.**\n\n## Tooling for Micro-Economies\n\nCreator tools enable micro-economies. The shift from Web2 to Web3 create revenue streams which prioritize community ownership over individual ownership. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b1b1d3dc-e3e3-46de-9882-a9b3b23d7971.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nIn Web2, creators monetize their work via a SaaS model, where they’re paid for a newsletter, artwork, or craft on a regular basis. \n\nIn Web3, creators monetize through the issuance of a social token or NFTs, with non-fungible tokens acting as digital media ownership. \n\nTokenization offers a path to crowdfund work, while also ensuring early supporters are rewarded. It prioritizes community ownership, best seen in early Mirror campaigns like [$VALUE](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/b3_zJsOv8vvvJsaOKyCM-KcCeA_zEbn6K1yrmnRSK8Q) and [$ESSAY](https://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0).\n\nMonetization becomes non-linear, meaning the derivative value of tokens are often multiples of the value created from recurring revenue streams.\n\nThese tools offer a direct way for communities to earn income, while also providing mediums to share (and multiply) the value with its members.\n\n**While Web2 is passive, web3 makes it active, thus turning communities into functioning micro-economies. **\n\n## Why Should I Care?\n\nMicro-economies give the long-tail of creators a path forward. \n\nThanks to platforms like [Coinvise](https://www.coinvise.co/) and [Rally](https://rally.io/), micro-economies can be created in an instant. They allow creators to distribute liquid instruments (in the form of tokens) to better monetize intangible contributions and sweat equity. \n\nTo contributors, it offers an unconventional path to work on what you love, and get paid in assets with exponential upside in the process.\n\nAdoption will not happen through gambling, it will happen through 100,000 niche communities teaching ten of their closest friends how crypto can make a fundamental difference in their social life today.\n\n## Key Players\n\nThe most prominent micro-economies are seen with young guns like [Anish Agnihotri](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri) - spending nights and weekends outside a degree and working full time at Polychain to build communities like PartyDAO using Mirror and Zora. Nice work, boss!\n\n[](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1389793340057694213?s=20)\n\n[Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq), [Six](https://twitter.com/sixnft) and CRE8 Club are building systems to manage the next generation of micro-economies - offering best practices to take creators from 0 to 1.\n\nCrypto-media outlets like Bankless are now [transitioning to a DAO](https://medium.com/bankless-dao/announcing-bankless-dao-133220f5efd8). This comes alongside [Forefront](https://forefront.news/blog/ff-community-incentives), and [Global Coin Research](https://globalcoinresearch.com/how-to-submit-contributor-posts/) who are all incentivizing writing contributions using their native tokens! (plus more coming SoonTM)\n\n[](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1390724377227022339?s=20)\n\n[PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO), [SongCamp](https://twitter.com/songcampdotband), [SquiggleDAO](https://twitter.com/squiggledao), Gremlins and [CypherDAO](https://twitter.com/cypherdao) are all starting to collect together. While most micro-economies won’t have [$5M to purchase Edward Snowden’s first NFT](https://foundation.app/Snowden/stay-free-edward-snowden-2021-24437), it’s exciting to highlight the power of what’s possible when resources are shared to follow an agreed upon mission.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sirsuhayb/status/1389040288006512643?s=20\n\n## How Micro-Economies Evolve\n\nAs micro-economies find their footing, it’s common to see the community band together to scale.\n\nThis is done through Treasury Diversification - a way to exchange tokens directly from the treasury with capital contributors keen to purchase sizable stakes in the group. Not only does it provide a community with working capital, but it gives the token more confidence as it’s now socially backed by world-class investors.\n\nCommunities like [Friends With Benefits](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmesG4qENC7CtAQRi5KAQbKucqRjPqGh8nJx4aR2G6mran), [Badger](https://forum.badger.finance/t/bip-37-treasury-diversification-through-strategic-partnerships/3262), [Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-ldo-treasury-diversification-part-2/506) and [Index Co-op](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-32-index-sale/1214) all successfully executed Treasury Diversification proposals.\n\nOnce working capital is available, we start to see a migration from [token-only compensation](https://magnethq.io/) to more standard payment structures and roles akin to traditional companies. This hybrid mix between a community token and USDC rivals Silicon Valley compensation packages with the added benefit of tokenized equity being liquid by default, tradable 24/7 on global DEXs like Uniswap. \n\nThis flow allows revenue generation to have a more direct tie to contributors. As micro-economies earn income, they’re incentivized to route it through a community treasury as token price *should* increase as a multiple of the growth of the treasury.\n\nTools like [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) and [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/docs) allow micro-economies to better rank contributions - ultimately building towards organizations in which compensation is tied to value created, rather than time spent.\n\nThanks to projects like [Parcel](https://beta-mainnet.parcel.money/dashboard), it’s never been easier to track, distribute and account for payments to and from a community treasury.\n\n**Put together, crypto offers the foundation for a sustainable creator middle class.**\n\n## Get Involved\n\nThis post is an open call to those building micro-economies.\n\nIt’s evident that a creator middle class is emerging, and that there is now a clear path to create and capture value. While the tools exist, it’s up to us to write the playbook for the next million micro-economies.\n\nIf you’re working on micro-economies and are interested in sharing your ideas, please [reach out](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa).\n\nTogether, we’ll build the creator middle class into a force to be reckoned with.\n\nSpecial thanks to Li Jin for the feedback and to Carlos Gomes for the graphics!\n\n*If you liked this post, be sure to leave a tip.
