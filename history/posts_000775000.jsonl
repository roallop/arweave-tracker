But there are still two major problems for creators today: Ownership and Collaboration.\n\nHow can we give back the power to creators, enable these individuals to build their communities, help them collaborate with other creators to achieve their ambitious goals?\n\nThe path that seems the most promising for creators is exit to community. In recent months, we've seen mainstream media talking about NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) and Social Tokens, and the revolution for more ownership is happening in front of our eyes.\n\nPlatforms like [Coinvise](https://www.coinvise.co/), offer creators the power to create their virtual currency, also known as Social Tokens. Social Tokens are virtual currencies that are enforced on a blockchain and allow specific advantages in a certain economy.\n\nCreating a Social Token is the easy part. What's more complicated, however, is to get it accepted by a community. How will creators convince anyone to work for them in exchange of a virtual currency they just created? What actions can creators take to start a virtual economy with a digital currency being accepted by their whole community?\n\nThe answer is: having strong Token economics for their project. We call Tokenomics (Token + Economics) all the things that enable participants to contributing positively enabled by strong token design. Setting up Tokenomics for a project means \"What can a creator put in place to allocate & incentivize a community to participate in the project.\"\n\nSocial tokens have shown their efficiency on incentivizing individuals to share their skills with others. Projects that have succeeded in creating thriving communities all have strong Tokenomics. Tokenomics is a successful community’s superpower.\n\nBut setting up Tokenomics is not a small task for creators, specifically for those new to the crypto world. How many tokens should a creator allocate to contributors? How much of the supply should be reserved for the community’s treasury? What will be the total initial supply? Many questions come to mind, and it's not always easy to have the correct answers.\n\nThis essay aims to explore further what creators can put in place to create strong Tokenomics around their project, and aims to break it down into an easy-to-read step-by-step guide.\n\n## 0 - Before starting\n\nBefore deep diving into Tokenomics, it’s important to clarify certain things.\n\n**Creators should gather a strong community toward a joint project.** A project beyond the creator themselves, a project that requires strong collaboration to be achieved. A singer can gather a large audience, but to turn this audience into a community, they need to have a broader project that requires collaboration. We could think of an album. Any fan could become a contributor by creating designs/posters, spreading the word, organizing crowdfunding and so on. We could also think of a fitness instructor making videos on Youtube, creating the go-to-place for everything related to having a healthy lifestyle. Fans, led by the creator, could create a platform, create challenges, and gather resources to achieve this broader goal. The point is: the project needs to go beyond the creator.\n\nIt’s also important to clarify what a creator is. **We will consider a creator as anyone pushing ideas, and a vision, through content on the internet.**[Jeff Kauffman Jr.](https://twitter.com/jeffkauffmanjr) for example, while maybe not considered as a creator in a traditional sense, has created a [thriving community](https://www.joinjump.community/) around advertising and marketing in Web3, pushing his ideas and vision through essays and podcasts, gathering a strong community keen to help him achieve his high ambition goals. [Dom Hofmann](https://twitter.com/dhof), the founder of Vine, is also a great example of this new wave of creators. Through his project [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject), Dom revolutionized the way we're thinking about collaboration around NFTs, and has gathered a community that collaborate to achieve a large goal.\n\nWith a common definition of what we’ll call a creator, and the prerequisites to create a thriving decentralized community, let's dig into the three main aspects of Tokenomics: **Token design -Token Distribution -Financial aspects.**\n\n## 1 - Token design: What key factors should Creators take into account before creating the Token?\n\nToken design is a critical component of creating a thriving community. It's essential as the Token design (aka - all the technical aspects of the token) will serve as a foundation to incentivize a community to participate in the project.\n\nThe first question that should come to mind when creating a Token should be \"What will be the total initial supply?\" or, in other words, \"**How many tokens should I create?\"**\n\nThere isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to \"How much token should I create,\" but we'll go over the main characteristics that you should take into account to come up with an answer.\n\nFirst of all, when creating a Token, there are two models, with both pros/cons, that you should be aware of.\n\n* ***The Fixed supply model -*** It's a model where you define the number of tokens you want to create beforehand (for example, 10M tokens) and receive them directly on a wallet.\n* ***The Bonding curve model -*** Anyone has to buy the Token to create it. Its price increases as the Supply or distribution of the Token do. The more tokens have been distributed, the higher the price. Let's take an example to illustrate what a bonding curve is. You've just launched your Token on a Bonding curve, and your best friend John wants to buy some. To make it easier, let's say that your Token is on a classic (linear) bonding curve and that the price of the first Token is $1. John will pay $1 for the first Token, $2 for the second, for the third, $3, and so on. To get the first ten tokens, John will have to pay $1+$2+$3+$4+$5. Totaling at $55. Now, let's say your Mom wants to buy ten tokens. Your Mom's tokens price won't start at $1 but at $11 (as John already purchased the first ten tokens). Every new buyer pushed the price up by increasing the Supply. On the other hand, when someone sells a Token, it will be burnt (destroyed), decrease the Supply, and lower the Token price.\n\n  Three types of bonding curves: **Linear**, **Sigmoid**, and **Negative Exponential Curve**.\n\nThere are many advantages to creating a token on a bonding curve. It guarantees Liquidity, allows a limitless Supply, reduces the volatility of the Token, and reduces the risks of hacks. However, it's more common to see communities minting their Token on a Fixed supply. Unless you're an expert and know what you're doing, we recommend creating a Token on a Fixed Supply. Indeed, it allows better usability, lowers entry barriers, gives community leaders full power over the distribution of the native Token, and doesn't require a strong community ready to pay from day one. If you're still interested in creating a Token on a bonding curve, we suggest reading this article to learn more.\n\nNow that you're aware of the two models, and considering you want to create a Token on a Fixed supply, you can start thinking of the total Supply you want to create. The standard is to create a supply of 10M, but again, some successful communities have thrived with less supply (e.g. [Metafactory has a 420 000 total supply](https://forefront.market/creators/robot)) or more (e.g. [Bankless DAO has a 1 billion initial supply](https://medium.com/bankless-dao/announcing-bankless-dao-133220f5efd8)).\n\nWhat's more important when considering creating a token is to **think about the relative amount of tokens** (i.e. what percentage of the total Supply are we talking about). For example, let's say you decide to create 100 000 tokens worth 100 000 dollars. It means that if someone buys 1000 tokens, he will have to pay $1000. If you decide to create 1M tokens that are still worth 100 000 dollars in another scenario, if someone pays $1000, he will get 10 000 Tokens. In both cases, the person ending-up holding the same relative amount of tokens: 1% of all tokens. **More than the total supply, while extremely important, you also have to think about the relative amount of token (i.e the percentage) when taking decision.** Instead of thinking about the number of tokens you should put in the treasury, maybe it’s better to think in percentages.\n\nWhen creating a Token on Coinvise, we suggest you make a supply of 10M tokens, following the industry standard. **You'll also have to think about a name and a Symbol for your Token.** It can be anything, but, usually, community leaders are putting the name of their community or their own name. For the Symbol, it can be anything between 1 and 7 characters. To well understand the differences between a Name and a Symbol, here are some examples: [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/)($ETH), [Forefront](https://forefront.market/) ($FF), [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) ($BTC), [Alex Masmej Token](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej) ($ALEX).\n\nThe price of the Token is also part of the Token Design and will be decided when community leaders will create a Liquidity pool. The token's price and its volatility are vital components of Tokenomics. We'll talk further about it later in this article.\n\nToken design is the first step in creating a Token, and it's not a small task. It's important to think about it thoroughly, depending on your use cases, as it will be complicated to increase the total supply if you realize it was not enough.\n\nWith the Token created and sent to a secured wallet, community leaders will have to think about distributing it to contributors.\n\n## 2 - Token Distribution: **How should a creator distribute the token to incentivize more people to help the project grow?**\n\nOnce a creator has gathered a small and tight community (can be as few as \\~20 people) and has created a Token, the second step is to think about how to reward these early believers. **Thinking about how to incentivize them to continue building, and motivate some more people to join the community.** It's always a big step when introducing a Token in a community, and it's essential to make it right.\n\nThe challenge with Token Distribution is to create efficient distribution mechanisms that would put the tokens in the hands of people willing to produce long-term work for the network. Your role, as a community leader, is to create a healthy community that can thrive in the long term, and the first step to accomplish this goal is to decide on what percentage of the supply should go in the treasury, to the stakeholders, as a retroactive airdrop, as a [vested treasury](https://www.notion.so/What-is-Vesting-Schedule-dccd252171ea44409ebbe06ab5306e40), etc.. If you're interested to learn more about Token distribution, we suggest you read the [Forefront’s Token announcement](https://forefront.news/blog/ff-hello-world) where they explain the $FF distribution.\n\n![$FF distribution by Forefront - the token has been minted on a 10M Fixed Supply.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F476b073d-0118-44fd-a9d2-1b43c29068a7_1280x720.jpeg)\n\nThere are several areas in your community where you can distribute your Token. You could choose for example to allocate a part of the supply to **airdrop** (send) tokens to members of other communities that are related to your project. Doing Airdrops can be an interesting way to attract potential contributors. You could also allocate part of the supply to the **core team** to motivate them build a great community or keep some tokens in **the treasury** to allocate them to community members that help the project grow. You have to think thoroughly about the percentage of the total supply you want to assign to the treasury. There is no rule of thumb for the treasury's percentage. Some communities have 15% of their supply allocated to their treasury, some 20%, and others 45%. The Treasury will help you fund exciting initiatives within the community.\n\nThere are two main ways to allocate Tokens to community members when creating a decentralized community: **Bounties and budget allocations**. There are fundamental differences between bounty hunters and core contributors (as outlined in this essay), and it's essential to distribute the tokens accordingly.\n\nSetting up bounties will serve for one-off missions. It can be extremely useful to attract more people to your community. Bounty hunters will usually participate very flexibly on an ad-hoc basis. They're ready to rent their time in exchange for Tokens but won't be involved in the vision and the day-to-day operations. Make sure to have [well-designed incentives if](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/how-to-design-great-incentives) you want your community to be active.\n\nThe second way to distribute tokens is to develop Guilds, or working groups, in charge of specific missions within the community. By creating these working groups, community leaders will allocate funds to specifics teams and organize the community more thoughtfully. Community members in those working groups are core contributors and Staff. They will take care of more complex missions, help run the day-to-day operations, and be committed in the long term.\n\nIn any case, Bounty hunters and core contributors will be incentivized to work thanks to the Social Token, and **having enough treasury to reward all the active community members is extremely important.**\n\nWhile the monetary value of the token can play a huge role in why people are contributing, the are many other rights and perks that can be assigned to token holders.\n\nIndeed, once you've started distributing the token, you should reflect on the rights you want to give to token holders. In specific communities, owning a token bestows a right that results in product usage, a governance action, a given contribution, voting, or direct access to a product or market. For example, [GlobalCoinResearch's](https://globalcoinresearch.com/) members holding the $GCR token have governance rights, can pool liquidity (stake), earn more tokens in doing so, have access to exclusive content, access to deals and events etc..\n\nAs the last piece of advice on token distribution, it's essential, specifically at the beginning, to **consider any person to whom you give token an investor**. With a very centralized community at the beginning (mostly the creator of the token or a small core team), each person that will receive the token will (potentially) have governance power and can have a huge influence over the future decisions of the community.\n\nIn most new communities, the only way to earn a token is to put some work in the community and be involved in it. Later on, however, community leaders should start opening the access to the community and allow anyone to buy tokens. This process is called “Pooling Liquidity” and comes with the concerns of price stability.\n\n## 3 - Financial aspects: How creators can manage the stability of the token so people are still motivated to collaborate?\n\nAs in every project, the financial aspect is a critical component of a Social Token. A token that gains value (both social and financial value) will attract top talent and incentivize community members to become contributors.\n\nFirst of all, it's important to explain briefly what gives value to a token.\n\n**At its creation, a Social Token created on a fixed supply has no inherent value, as no one has put money in it yet.** You could have a million of a $NAME Token you've just created that you couldn't buy any item in real life. That's the reason why, at some point, communities are looking to add Liquidity, allowing anyone to buy the Token in exchange for some other cryptocurrencies that already have a monetary value. By allowing anyone to buy and sell the Token, the coin gains economic value, and community leaders can use this money to make the community grow.\n\nConcretely, pooling liquidity means creating a Pool where people can make their Token and another one (bond) available for anyone wanting to buy it. When the Liquidity Pool is created, users can add the exact value of two Token (ex. $500 of your Token + $500 of collateral, aka any other token) in a Pool and earn trading fees proportional to their share of the total Liquidity. Put simply, these **Liquidity providers facilitate trading by willing to buy or sell a particular asset at any given time, thereby providing Liquidity and enabling traders to trade without waiting for another buyer or seller to show up.** The price is determined by Automated Market Maker directly on the Decentralized Exchange you're creating the pool on (ex: Uniswap).\n\n![Uniswap (decentralized exchange) interface](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F204e8e10-c8d8-4628-b71a-fb4822f08041_1456x739.jpeg)\n\nWith a better understanding of Social Token's financial value, it will be essential to understand how to manage the stability of the Token. Indeed, **with a highly volatile token, contributors won't risk their time in exchange for a token that could plummet the day after.** Likewise, a Token that can double in value overnight will attract only speculators, members that are only there for a quick buck and not keen to put some work to make the community grow and evolve.\n\nThere are many ways to limit the volatility of a token. The first one is to **vest a portion of the supply.** Concretely, **vesting a token means locking a certain amount of tokens over a certain period as a commitment to hold the Token.** When a token is vested, the owner of those Token can't withdraw them directly and have to wait until the vesting period ends. It's made possible thanks to blockchain mechanisms, and specifically smart contracts, that make it easy to lock a certain amount of funds until contract conditions are met. In our case, when the vesting period has been completed, the smart contract, enforced on a blockchain, will allow the holders to withdraw their tokens.\n\n**It is also possible to bond the Token with a stable coin in a Liquidity Pool to ensure price stability.** Indeed, when creating a liquidity pool, while it's not the only factor that makes the price fluctuate, the Token with whom you're bonding your Token can have an impact on your token price. When bonding your Token with collateral volatile, if the price of this token drops considerably, it will, in a way, impact the price of your Token.\n\nThirdly, you can try to stabilize the price of the Token by creating Liquidity Mining Programs. Liquidity Mining is the same concept that having a savings account and making interests. **When putting your money at the bank, you agree that bankers will play with your money in exchange for a specific interest rate. When pooling Liquidity on a decentralized exchange, you agree to automatically buy or sell a particular asset at any given time to help the project grow in exchange for a reward.** It is a powerful way of incentivizing users to hold on to their crypto holdings, as, in return for doing so, these users will receive staking rewards. Creating Liquidity Mining Programs, and therefore having more Liquidity, will increase transaction depth. Transaction depth is the degree of market price stability. The greater the depth, the less significant the impact of several transactions will be on the price. On the other hand, with low Liquidity, a single person can drop or bump the cost of your Token by buying or selling a significant amount. Through Liquidity Mining Programs, community leaders ensure to have enough Liquidity to grow their project and start a gradual path to community ownership. Liquidity Mining Programs have shown their efficiency to align incentives and create a positive-sum game.\n\n![Forefront Liquidity Mining Campaign Landing Page](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf06bd73-fdc4-4bce-a4d4-657ce1ae25f5_1456x743.jpeg)\n\nAs we've just seen, there are many financial tools at the disposal of community leaders to reduce the volatility of a token.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs seen in this essay, all of the above elements will play a major role in the way people collaborate in a decentralized community. As a creator, it's important to think thoroughly about the Token design, Token Distribution, and Financial aspects of your Token to ensure the long-term success of the community. We've just seen multiple examples of concrete actions community leaders can take to incentivize a community to participate in the project, and that's what we call Tokenomics.\n\nYou will rapidly notice that thriving communities often have great Tokenomics.

Many questions come to mind, and it's not always easy to have the correct answers.\n\nThis essay aims to explore further what creators can put in place to create strong Tokenomics around their project, and aims to break it down into an easy-to-read step-by-step guide.\n\n## 0 - Before starting\n\nBefore deep diving into Tokenomics, it’s important to clarify certain things.\n\n**Creators should gather a strong community toward a joint project.** A project beyond the creator themselves, a project that requires strong collaboration to be achieved. A singer can gather a large audience, but to turn this audience into a community, they need to have a broader project that requires collaboration. We could think of an album. Any fan could become a contributor by creating designs/posters, spreading the word, organizing crowdfunding and so on. We could also think of a fitness instructor making videos on Youtube, creating the go-to-place for everything related to having a healthy lifestyle. Fans, led by the creator, could create a platform, create challenges, and gather resources to achieve this broader goal. The point is: the project needs to go beyond the creator.\n\nIt’s also important to clarify what a creator is. **We will consider a creator as anyone pushing ideas, and a vision, through content on the internet.**[Jeff Kauffman Jr.](https://twitter.com/jeffkauffmanjr) for example, while maybe not considered as a creator in a traditional sense, has created a [thriving community](https://www.joinjump.community/) around advertising and marketing in Web3, pushing his ideas and vision through essays and podcasts, gathering a strong community keen to help him achieve his high ambition goals. [Dom Hofmann](https://twitter.com/dhof), the founder of Vine, is also a great example of this new wave of creators. Through his project [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject), Dom revolutionized the way we're thinking about collaboration around NFTs, and has gathered a community that collaborate to achieve a large goal.\n\nWith a common definition of what we’ll call a creator, and the prerequisites to create a thriving decentralized community, let's dig into the three main aspects of Tokenomics: **Token design -Token Distribution -Financial aspects.**\n\n## 1 - Token design: What key factors should Creators take into account before creating the Token?\n\nToken design is a critical component of creating a thriving community. It's essential as the Token design (aka - all the technical aspects of the token) will serve as a foundation to incentivize a community to participate in the project.\n\nThe first question that should come to mind when creating a Token should be \"What will be the total initial supply?\" or, in other words, \"**How many tokens should I create?\"**\n\nThere isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to \"How much token should I create,\" but we'll go over the main characteristics that you should take into account to come up with an answer.\n\nFirst of all, when creating a Token, there are two models, with both pros/cons, that you should be aware of.\n\n* ***The Fixed supply model -*** It's a model where you define the number of tokens you want to create beforehand (for example, 10M tokens) and receive them directly on a wallet.\n* ***The Bonding curve model -*** Anyone has to buy the Token to create it. Its price increases as the Supply or distribution of the Token do. The more tokens have been distributed, the higher the price. Let's take an example to illustrate what a bonding curve is. You've just launched your Token on a Bonding curve, and your best friend John wants to buy some. To make it easier, let's say that your Token is on a classic (linear) bonding curve and that the price of the first Token is $1. John will pay $1 for the first Token, $2 for the second, for the third, $3, and so on. To get the first ten tokens, John will have to pay $1+$2+$3+$4+$5. Totaling at $55. Now, let's say your Mom wants to buy ten tokens. Your Mom's tokens price won't start at $1 but at $11 (as John already purchased the first ten tokens). Every new buyer pushed the price up by increasing the Supply. On the other hand, when someone sells a Token, it will be burnt (destroyed), decrease the Supply, and lower the Token price.\n\n  Three types of bonding curves: **Linear**, **Sigmoid**, and **Negative Exponential Curve**.\n\nThere are many advantages to creating a token on a bonding curve. It guarantees Liquidity, allows a limitless Supply, reduces the volatility of the Token, and reduces the risks of hacks. However, it's more common to see communities minting their Token on a Fixed supply. Unless you're an expert and know what you're doing, we recommend creating a Token on a Fixed Supply. Indeed, it allows better usability, lowers entry barriers, gives community leaders full power over the distribution of the native Token, and doesn't require a strong community ready to pay from day one. If you're still interested in creating a Token on a bonding curve, we suggest reading this article to learn more.\n\nNow that you're aware of the two models, and considering you want to create a Token on a Fixed supply, you can start thinking of the total Supply you want to create. The standard is to create a supply of 10M, but again, some successful communities have thrived with less supply (e.g. [Metafactory has a 420 000 total supply](https://forefront.market/creators/robot)) or more (e.g. [Bankless DAO has a 1 billion initial supply](https://medium.com/bankless-dao/announcing-bankless-dao-133220f5efd8)).\n\nWhat's more important when considering creating a token is to **think about the relative amount of tokens** (i.e. what percentage of the total Supply are we talking about). For example, let's say you decide to create 100 000 tokens worth 100 000 dollars. It means that if someone buys 1000 tokens, he will have to pay $1000. If you decide to create 1M tokens that are still worth 100 000 dollars in another scenario, if someone pays $1000, he will get 10 000 Tokens. In both cases, the person ending-up holding the same relative amount of tokens: 1% of all tokens. **More than the total supply, while extremely important, you also have to think about the relative amount of token (i.e the percentage) when taking decision.** Instead of thinking about the number of tokens you should put in the treasury, maybe it’s better to think in percentages.\n\nWhen creating a Token on Coinvise, we suggest you make a supply of 10M tokens, following the industry standard. **You'll also have to think about a name and a Symbol for your Token.** It can be anything, but, usually, community leaders are putting the name of their community or their own name. For the Symbol, it can be anything between 1 and 7 characters. To well understand the differences between a Name and a Symbol, here are some examples: [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/)($ETH), [Forefront](https://forefront.market/) ($FF), [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) ($BTC), [Alex Masmej Token](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej) ($ALEX).\n\nThe price of the Token is also part of the Token Design and will be decided when community leaders will create a Liquidity pool. The token's price and its volatility are vital components of Tokenomics. We'll talk further about it later in this article.\n\nToken design is the first step in creating a Token, and it's not a small task. It's important to think about it thoroughly, depending on your use cases, as it will be complicated to increase the total supply if you realize it was not enough.\n\nWith the Token created and sent to a secured wallet, community leaders will have to think about distributing it to contributors.\n\n## 2 - Token Distribution: **How should a creator distribute the token to incentivize more people to help the project grow?**\n\nOnce a creator has gathered a small and tight community (can be as few as \\~20 people) and has created a Token, the second step is to think about how to reward these early believers. **Thinking about how to incentivize them to continue building, and motivate some more people to join the community.** It's always a big step when introducing a Token in a community, and it's essential to make it right.\n\nThe challenge with Token Distribution is to create efficient distribution mechanisms that would put the tokens in the hands of people willing to produce long-term work for the network. Your role, as a community leader, is to create a healthy community that can thrive in the long term, and the first step to accomplish this goal is to decide on what percentage of the supply should go in the treasury, to the stakeholders, as a retroactive airdrop, as a [vested treasury](https://www.notion.so/What-is-Vesting-Schedule-dccd252171ea44409ebbe06ab5306e40), etc.. If you're interested to learn more about Token distribution, we suggest you read the [Forefront’s Token announcement](https://forefront.news/blog/ff-hello-world) where they explain the $FF distribution.\n\n![$FF distribution by Forefront - the token has been minted on a 10M Fixed Supply.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F476b073d-0118-44fd-a9d2-1b43c29068a7_1280x720.jpeg)\n\nThere are several areas in your community where you can distribute your Token. You could choose for example to allocate a part of the supply to **airdrop** (send) tokens to members of other communities that are related to your project. Doing Airdrops can be an interesting way to attract potential contributors. You could also allocate part of the supply to the **core team** to motivate them build a great community or keep some tokens in **the treasury** to allocate them to community members that help the project grow. You have to think thoroughly about the percentage of the total supply you want to assign to the treasury. There is no rule of thumb for the treasury's percentage. Some communities have 15% of their supply allocated to their treasury, some 20%, and others 45%. The Treasury will help you fund exciting initiatives within the community.\n\nThere are two main ways to allocate Tokens to community members when creating a decentralized community: **Bounties and budget allocations**. There are fundamental differences between bounty hunters and core contributors (as outlined in this essay), and it's essential to distribute the tokens accordingly.\n\nSetting up bounties will serve for one-off missions. It can be extremely useful to attract more people to your community. Bounty hunters will usually participate very flexibly on an ad-hoc basis. They're ready to rent their time in exchange for Tokens but won't be involved in the vision and the day-to-day operations. Make sure to have [well-designed incentives if](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/how-to-design-great-incentives) you want your community to be active.\n\nThe second way to distribute tokens is to develop Guilds, or working groups, in charge of specific missions within the community. By creating these working groups, community leaders will allocate funds to specifics teams and organize the community more thoughtfully. Community members in those working groups are core contributors and Staff. They will take care of more complex missions, help run the day-to-day operations, and be committed in the long term.\n\nIn any case, Bounty hunters and core contributors will be incentivized to work thanks to the Social Token, and **having enough treasury to reward all the active community members is extremely important.**\n\nWhile the monetary value of the token can play a huge role in why people are contributing, the are many other rights and perks that can be assigned to token holders.\n\nIndeed, once you've started distributing the token, you should reflect on the rights you want to give to token holders. In specific communities, owning a token bestows a right that results in product usage, a governance action, a given contribution, voting, or direct access to a product or market. For example, [GlobalCoinResearch's](https://globalcoinresearch.com/) members holding the $GCR token have governance rights, can pool liquidity (stake), earn more tokens in doing so, have access to exclusive content, access to deals and events etc..\n\nAs the last piece of advice on token distribution, it's essential, specifically at the beginning, to **consider any person to whom you give token an investor**. With a very centralized community at the beginning (mostly the creator of the token or a small core team), each person that will receive the token will (potentially) have governance power and can have a huge influence over the future decisions of the community.\n\nIn most new communities, the only way to earn a token is to put some work in the community and be involved in it. Later on, however, community leaders should start opening the access to the community and allow anyone to buy tokens. This process is called “Pooling Liquidity” and comes with the concerns of price stability.\n\n## 3 - Financial aspects: How creators can manage the stability of the token so people are still motivated to collaborate?\n\nAs in every project, the financial aspect is a critical component of a Social Token. A token that gains value (both social and financial value) will attract top talent and incentivize community members to become contributors.\n\nFirst of all, it's important to explain briefly what gives value to a token.\n\n**At its creation, a Social Token created on a fixed supply has no inherent value, as no one has put money in it yet.** You could have a million of a $NAME Token you've just created that you couldn't buy any item in real life. That's the reason why, at some point, communities are looking to add Liquidity, allowing anyone to buy the Token in exchange for some other cryptocurrencies that already have a monetary value. By allowing anyone to buy and sell the Token, the coin gains economic value, and community leaders can use this money to make the community grow.\n\nConcretely, pooling liquidity means creating a Pool where people can make their Token and another one (bond) available for anyone wanting to buy it. When the Liquidity Pool is created, users can add the exact value of two Token (ex. $500 of your Token + $500 of collateral, aka any other token) in a Pool and earn trading fees proportional to their share of the total Liquidity. Put simply, these **Liquidity providers facilitate trading by willing to buy or sell a particular asset at any given time, thereby providing Liquidity and enabling traders to trade without waiting for another buyer or seller to show up.** The price is determined by Automated Market Maker directly on the Decentralized Exchange you're creating the pool on (ex: Uniswap).\n\n![Uniswap (decentralized exchange) interface](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F204e8e10-c8d8-4628-b71a-fb4822f08041_1456x739.jpeg)\n\nWith a better understanding of Social Token's financial value, it will be essential to understand how to manage the stability of the Token. Indeed, **with a highly volatile token, contributors won't risk their time in exchange for a token that could plummet the day after.** Likewise, a Token that can double in value overnight will attract only speculators, members that are only there for a quick buck and not keen to put some work to make the community grow and evolve.\n\nThere are many ways to limit the volatility of a token. The first one is to **vest a portion of the supply.** Concretely, **vesting a token means locking a certain amount of tokens over a certain period as a commitment to hold the Token.** When a token is vested, the owner of those Token can't withdraw them directly and have to wait until the vesting period ends. It's made possible thanks to blockchain mechanisms, and specifically smart contracts, that make it easy to lock a certain amount of funds until contract conditions are met. In our case, when the vesting period has been completed, the smart contract, enforced on a blockchain, will allow the holders to withdraw their tokens.\n\n**It is also possible to bond the Token with a stable coin in a Liquidity Pool to ensure price stability.** Indeed, when creating a liquidity pool, while it's not the only factor that makes the price fluctuate, the Token with whom you're bonding your Token can have an impact on your token price. When bonding your Token with collateral volatile, if the price of this token drops considerably, it will, in a way, impact the price of your Token.\n\nThirdly, you can try to stabilize the price of the Token by creating Liquidity Mining Programs. Liquidity Mining is the same concept that having a savings account and making interests. **When putting your money at the bank, you agree that bankers will play with your money in exchange for a specific interest rate. When pooling Liquidity on a decentralized exchange, you agree to automatically buy or sell a particular asset at any given time to help the project grow in exchange for a reward.** It is a powerful way of incentivizing users to hold on to their crypto holdings, as, in return for doing so, these users will receive staking rewards. Creating Liquidity Mining Programs, and therefore having more Liquidity, will increase transaction depth. Transaction depth is the degree of market price stability. The greater the depth, the less significant the impact of several transactions will be on the price. On the other hand, with low Liquidity, a single person can drop or bump the cost of your Token by buying or selling a significant amount. Through Liquidity Mining Programs, community leaders ensure to have enough Liquidity to grow their project and start a gradual path to community ownership. Liquidity Mining Programs have shown their efficiency to align incentives and create a positive-sum game.\n\n![Forefront Liquidity Mining Campaign Landing Page](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf06bd73-fdc4-4bce-a4d4-657ce1ae25f5_1456x743.jpeg)\n\nAs we've just seen, there are many financial tools at the disposal of community leaders to reduce the volatility of a token.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs seen in this essay, all of the above elements will play a major role in the way people collaborate in a decentralized community. As a creator, it's important to think thoroughly about the Token design, Token Distribution, and Financial aspects of your Token to ensure the long-term success of the community. We've just seen multiple examples of concrete actions community leaders can take to incentivize a community to participate in the project, and that's what we call Tokenomics.\n\nYou will rapidly notice that thriving communities often have great Tokenomics. They have good mechanisms that make more people join the community and actively participate and create value.

{"id": "jLcAbWdrNU8ea_trvXIvIc1l1nGGin23GIXGqQOW10k", "title": "The Year in Ethereum 2018", "body": "*👋 Note: Originally published on Jan 16, 2019 on [Medium](https://jjmstark.medium.com/the-year-in-ethereum-87a17d6f8276).*\n\n\n---\n\n**Ethereum began as a bold experiment.** Can we build a universal platform for digital money and assets, un-censorable applications, and decentralized organizations?\n\n**We started with a slightly smaller experiment: was it possible to launch a blockchain that could execute arbitrary programs?** Over time, the Ethereum community began new experiments. Would developers find it interesting? What applications are actually useful? The community learned from its successes and failures, and iterated on their work. New people joined the community and started running their *own* experiments.\n\n**In 2018, the Ethereum community ran more experiments than ever before.** What did we learn? This summary of the year in Ethereum is our attempt to identify the most important developments — the things that we’ll say mattered, 10 years out.\n\nThese developments took place at every level of the Ethereum “stack”. This includes the core protocol and the clients that implement it, commonly referred to as “**Layer 1**”. It includes the supporting **developer tools & infrastructure**, that make engineering on Ethereum possible. It includes “**off chain**” technologies, that let developers build fast and performant applications. And it includes the products and businesses **[built on Ethereum](https://twitter.com/builtoneth).**\n\n**Keeping track of everything in this ecosystem is becoming more and more difficult every week.** There are competing implementations of many infrastructure technologies — including two clients with \\~50% (**[Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)**) and \\~40% (**[Parity](https://www.parity.io/ethereum/)**) of the network. There are multiple competing off-chain technology stacks being built, multiple ETH 2.0 clients under development, and most markets have multiple competing businesses. It feels messy and chaotic — **the Ethereum ecosystem is** **[a bazaar, not a cathedral](http://www.catb.org/\\~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/)**. While this can make it hard to follow, it’s a credit to the community: we’re too big to measure with [simple tools](https://twitter.com/0xstark/status/1062820097994170368).\n\n**Our goal is to help you sort through that noise and see the bigger picture**. In our view, here are the most important developments in 2018:\n\n* **1. More people started using Ethereum, for more things** — but we’re still far from mass adoption.\n* **2. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and stablecoins** — a new class of applications that saw many product launches and some breakout successes.\n* **3. The year of #BUIDL** — it became radically easier to build applications on Ethereum. Our development and security tooling improved significantly, we got better at sharing best practices, and hackathons became a trend.\n* **4. Layer 2 scaling** — multiple “layer 2” applications launched, and we made critical progress towards making these scaling solutions easy to use for developers.\n* **5. Zero knowledge technology** — this year it felt like every technical conversation in Ethereum was “We can do it this way right now, but of course once we have good zkSTARKs…”\n* **6. ETH 2.0 / Serenity** — the roadmap solidified, and it moved from a research project to an engineering effort.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Fjcwnh2okNwTooXE2Kbimg.png)\n\n## 1. Did adoption of Ethereum grow in 2018?\n\nFrom 2015–2017, it was an open question whether there would ever be *any demand for Ethereum.* Today, that answer feels settled: since late 2017, the Ethereum blockchain has continued to be used near maximum capacity:\n\n![Source: Google Bigquery Ethereum public dataset](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0\\*K-iZAAoNa1xThsa_?size=large)\n\nThis graph shows the utilization of the Ethereum blockchain at different points in time. Specifically, [it is a measure of the total gas used divided by the gas limit](https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1084382703951130624). When the line approaches 1, it means the Ethereum blockchain is being used at nearly 100% capacity.\n\n**Yes, the graph above is encouraging — people are paying to use the Ethereum blockchain.** But it means we started asking harder questions: we’re near 100% capacity even with such a small user base? What would happen to fees if we on-boarded *millions* of users, when the total capacity of the network is so low? How many *people* actually use Ethereum? What are they using it for? And what are the right metrics to measure growth?\n\nMeasuring “use” of Ethereum isn’t easy. For instance, we can get a basic picture using raw on-chain statistics, like the [number of transactions on the network](https://etherscan.io/chart/tx):\n\nBut this doesn’t tell the whole story. If Ethereum was being used near full capacity, how can the number of transactions be declining? **The composition of transactions on Ethereum shifted from a large number of simple ones, to a smaller number of complex ones.** For instance, token transfers (\\~50K gas) or opening up a MakerDAO CDP (up to 900K gas) both “take up” more of the network’s capacity than a simple ETH transfer (21K gas).\n\nAs Ethereum’s app layer continues to grow, we should expect the transaction count to decline while the chain operates at full capacity. And as more activity moves into side chains, state channels, or plasma chains (see Layer 2, below), measuring on-chain transactions increasingly only tell part of the story.\n\n## **What are people using the network for?**\n\nMany significant and long-awaited applications went live in 2018, and appear to be attracting users.\n\n[Dai](https://makerdao.com/dai/), the stablecoin launched by [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/), has been live since late 2017, and the total supply of Dai grew to 69m as of December 31st, 2018.\n\n![Source: mkr.tools](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*tGvHX9zoZmfwFk9I)\n\n**Users of MakerDAO have locked more than 1.7% of all ether into smart-contracts that serve as collateral for the Dai stablecoin.** As of December 31st, the value of that ether was over $275 million. We discuss MakerDAO, and other “decentralized finance” applications, in detail in the [next section](#8230).\n\n**[Augur](https://www.augur.net/)**, a decentralized prediction market under development since 2015, launched in July 2018 and has seen open interest (the amount of value currently “bet” on the system) grow to a high over over $2.96m in November 2018. However, the total number of users has remained low.\n\n**[Spankchain](https://spankchain.com/)**, a payment channels service for the adult entertainment industry, launched in April 2018 and [processed $70,000 in payments](https://www.coindesk.com/spankchain-eth-crypto-porn-camgirl) to performers between April and December 2018.\n\nMany more applications launched in 2018, including many in the “decentralized finance” category. Many others were games like **[Gods Unchained](https://www.coindesk.com/a-crypto-card-game-is-testing-magics-records-and-it-hasnt-even-launched)** (beta, November 2018), or gambling services like **[FunFair](https://funfair.io/)** (mainnet, September 2018). There are hundreds of other applications that use the Ethereum blockchain, which you can find listed [here](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings/platform/ethereum) or [here](https://dappradar.com/dapps).\n\n**Overall, consumer use of applications on Ethereum remains low.** When we use measurements like daily active users who interact with a dapp’s smart-contract on the blockchain, we see an average of [between 10,000–15,000](https://dappradar.com/charts) users on any given day in 2018.\n\nHowever, note that this is a measurement of *on-chain transactions* and does not include, for example, someone opening an app and browsing their collectibles, or opening **[Veil](https://veil.market/)** (alpha, September 2018, mainnet January 15 2019) to view their open predictions on Augur.\n\n**User adoption of new technology moves in phases.** Users come to applications, creating demand for better infrastructure, and applications then build on that infrastructure to meet the expectations of users. We can analogize from web development that there is a reinforcing[ loop of app and infrastructure development](https://www.usv.com/blog/the-myth-of-the-infrastructure-phase).\n\nBy the end of 2017, we had learned that there was demand from people who wanted to build applications on Ethereum. In 2018, the community shipped apps that were useful without scaling upgrades, and built infrastructure that will make it possible for the next wave of applications to work at a larger scale.\n\n## **What should we be measuring, anyways?**\n\nIs “daily active on-chain transactions” the right measurement to quantify user adoption? This year, people started thinking (and [tweeting](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1058322555315019777)) about what metrics we should use to gauge Ethereum’s success.\n\n**The answer, surely, is that it depends on what counts as success.** Some businesses require large numbers of users (like consumer apps or games), while others seek high volumes of value (like some financial services).\n\nAs layer 2 scaling technologies are adopted, more user activity will move “off-chain” where it is more difficult to measure. **This already influences the data used to measure Ethereum’s adoption.** For instance, [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/) does not currently include statistics on games that use [Loom](https://loomx.io/)’s Dappchains, nor does it list activity in [Spankchain’](https://spankchain.com/)s payment channels.\n\n**But this isn’t a bug, it’s a feature.** We want to build [web 3](https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-web-3-c1a9e74dcae) — an internet that, among other things, respects user’s privacy instead of spying on them. That means giving users the option to keep their business to themselves, off-chain, where it isn’t easy to measure and incorporate into statistics.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Fjcwnh2okNwTooXE2Kbimg.png)\n\n## **2. The Year of DeFi**\n\n**This year we talked about a new narrative within the larger set of Ethereum applications.** Many projects launched which were explicitly *financial* — applications or protocols that give users new tools with which to manage and use Ethereum-based money or assets. As a group, these became known as “Decentralized Finance” or “**[DeFi](https://medium.com/defi-network/opening-defi-42a5afdb71e0)**”.\n\nThere are now companies building out a stack of financial primitives — the basic building blocks of a financial system. While these tools are in very early stages, it is possible today to use Ethereum-based protocols to **take out loans, to lend money and earn a return, to buy bundles of assets, to hedge your risk, to trade assets trustlessly, and to make payments for zero fees**. Because these systems are largely open and interoperable, it is becoming possible to combine them in useful ways, building applications that can borrow, lend, and invest simply by calling an API.\n\nWithin this category there are stablecoins (**[Dai](https://makerdao.com/)**, mainnet December 2017), lending tools (**[Dharma](https://blog.dharma.io/dharma-community-update-29-may-2018-3fe21f3c93c6)**, mainnet May 2018, **[Marble](https://marble.org/)**, mainnet beta July 2018), margin trading and derivatives products (**[Daxia](https://www.daxia.us/)**, mainnet January 2018, **[dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/)**, mainnet October 2018, **[bZx](https://b0x.network/)**, mainnet September 2018, **[Market Protocol](https://marketprotocol.io/)**, testnet November 2018, **[UMA](https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-enabling-universal-market-access-266eb9e5fd90?s)**, under development), bundled investment products (**[Set Protocol](https://www.setprotocol.com/)**, mainnet June 2018), money market protocols (**[Compound](https://compound.finance/)**, mainnet September 2018), credit default swaps (**[CDx](https://cdxproject.com/)**, under development), token swap services (**[Kyber Network](http://kyber.network/)**, mainnet February 2018), subscription payment services (**[8x](https://8xprotocol.com/)**, testnet October 2018), payment channel hubs (**[Connext](https://connext.network/)**, mainnet September 2018), and prediction markets (**[Augur](https://www.augur.net/)**, mainnet July 2018, **[Gnosis PM](https://gnosis.pm/)**, alpha December 2017).\n\nOver the last year, the share of ETH “locked up” (e.g. used as collateral) in the smart-contracts of some DeFi applications has grown:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lkv3OL_A1PCieMZdpKknU.png?height=579&width=1456&size=large)\n\nThe above graph hides MakerDAO by default, in order to let us see other applications. If we include MakerDAO, the graph looks like this:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*IY7AwAzxf1kLn8aFE7wn7Q.png?size=large)\n\n**The most successful DeFi protocol —** and the most successful application on Ethereum in 2018 — is **[MakerDAO.](https://makerdao.com/)**\n\n**Over the last year Dai survived a 94% fall in the value of its underlying collateral.** The system was battle-tested in the first few months of its launch, and appears to have functioned as intended. It has quickly became a core piece of infrastructure for many Ethereum applications.\n\nWithin the community of people that actually use Ethereum apps on a regular basis, it’s hard to overstate the impact of having an easy to use, decentralized stablecoin. If you work in this ecosystem, you will remember that 12 months ago you probably sometimes paid, and were paid, in ETH. Today, everyone uses Dai — for contract payments, for event sponsorships, for petty cash.\n\n**MakerDAO is not just Dai, though that is the most outward-facing product.** It also includes a system of “[Collateralized Debt Positions](https://cdp.makerdao.com/)” (CDPs), which allows anyone to lock up ETH as collateral and receive a “loan” in DAI. This system facilitates the collateral backing that makes Dai possible, while also being a lending product in its own right that can be used for, among other things, leveraged trading.\n\nDai is not the only stablecoin built on Ethereum — though it is the only one of significant size that is “decentralized” in the sense that it is backed by digital assets in an automated collateral system, rather than off-chain assets like dollars held in fiat bank accounts. Other Ethereum-based stablecoins include **[TrueUSD](https://www.trusttoken.com/trueusd/)** (mainnet March 2018), **[Paxos](https://www.paxos.com/)** (mainnet October 2018), **[Gemini Dollar](https://gemini.com/dollar/)** (mainnet October 2018), **[USD Coin](https://www.coinbase.com/usdc)** (mainnet October 2018), and **[sUSD](https://www.synthetix.io/)** (mainnet June 2018).\n\nCollectively, all stablecoins built on Ethereum had a [marketcap of \\~770 million](https://stablecoinindex.com/marketcap) at the end of the year, large enough that as a group they would have ranked as the [14th largest](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20181230/) **cryptocurrency on Dec 31.**\n\n**While significant and growing, this volume is still dwarfed by trading volume in [Tether](https://tether.to/)**, which during the same period saw a daily average of around $5 billion USD.\n\n**Within the broader category of DeFi, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are the next most significant.** In 2018, this ecosystem grew and matured. There are not just multiple competing DEXs, but multiple *types* of DEXs now live in production. However, volume [remains low](https://dex.watch/) compared to any centralized exchange.\n\nThere are now several DEXs that use the **[0x protocol](https://0x.org/)**. **[Radar Relay](https://radarrelay.com/)** launched their beta in August 2017, raised a series A in July 2018, and released v2 of their product a few months ago in September. **[Paradex](https://paradex.io/)** launched October 2017, and was [acquired by Coinbase](https://blog.coinbase.com/welcome-paradex-to-coinbase-62f16cc9bd74) in May 2018. **[DDEX](https://ddex.io/)** launched their open beta on January 9 2018, became the leading 0x relayer by volume, and recently announced that they are forking the 0x protocol to create [a competing protocol called ](https://hydroprotocol.io/)**[Hydro](https://hydroprotocol.io/)**.\n\n**This year saw an expansion of the *type* of DEXs built on Ethereum**. **[Kyber](http://kyber.network/),** which launched in March 2018, does away with the order book and simply lets users receive a quote, and instantly swap one asset for another. **[Airswap](https://www.airswap.io/),** which launched in April 2018, similarly provides a simple “token swap” service. **[Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/)**, which implements a novel automated market-making feature [inspired by a reddit post from a few years back](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55m04x/lets_run_onchain_decentralized_exchanges_the_way/), launched in November 2018. It operates entirely on-chain, and [makes markets ](https://medium.com/@cyrus.younessi/uniswap-a-unique-exchange-f4ef44f807bf)*[itself](https://medium.com/@cyrus.younessi/uniswap-a-unique-exchange-f4ef44f807bf)*[ using a deterministic algorithm](https://medium.com/@cyrus.younessi/uniswap-a-unique-exchange-f4ef44f807bf). **Gnosis’ DutchX protocol** went live on mainnet in [October 2018](https://blog.gnosis.pm/the-dutchx-pilot-d8f3e2007ae4), with a user-interface to the protocol called **[slow.trade](https://blog.gnosis.pm/slow-trade-is-live-on-ethereum-mainnet-cb4e11a17a63)**[ that went live in December.](https://blog.gnosis.pm/slow-trade-is-live-on-ethereum-mainnet-cb4e11a17a63) **[StarkWare](https://www.starkware.co/)** [started working](https://medium.com/@StarkWare/the-road-ahead-in-2019-8589fedfbc7a) on zero-knowledge technology that will help scale DEXs and is expecting to launch on testnet in Q1 2019.\n\n**Why did DeFi take off in 2018?** One reason is that many of these applications are useful *today*, even before critical scaling technologies are in place. Basic financial use-cases like lending and borrowing do not require high transaction throughput — they simply require a secure programmable base layer blockchain. **Ethereum’s simplest use-case is the creation, exchange, and use of digital assets like ETH**. One way of looking at DeFi is that it is simply building the basic financial infrastructure to use those digital assets.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Fjcwnh2okNwTooXE2Kbimg.png)\n\n## **3. The year of BUIDL — better tools, better frameworks, more hacking**\n\n**2018 was the year of #BUIDLing**. This was the year that it became *radically* easier to get started building applications on Ethereum.\n\n**Developer tools improved, new security tools were released, key frameworks were released, and hackathons became a fixture in the community.** In 2018, the vision of average developers being able to build something useful on Ethereum became a reality, and the tooling necessary to use smart contracts in production improved.\n\n**We even gained a new meme to go along with the technical progress: BUIDL.** While the term — an inversion of the bitcoin meme “[HODL](https://twitter.com/coindesk/status/1083567269953839104)” — had been used by [different](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1070830466989678592) [people](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/930940008478978050) over the years, it never gained any real traction until **[ETHDenver](https://ethdenver.com/)** in February 2018. In the weeks following, it became an unofficial mantra for the Ethereum community — a reaction against the unhealthy focus on price and speculation common across the crypto industry.\n\n## **Security tooling**\n\n**At the end of 2017, security tooling & best practices were on everyone’s mind.** Multiple high profile hacks and [security failures](https://medium.com/cybermiles/i-accidentally-killed-it-and-evaporated-300-million-6b975dc1f76b) forced the Ethereum community to improve best practices, and invest more resources in security audits and tooling.\n\nIn 2018, the Ethereum security community improved. New security tools became available that made it easier to build secure applications. **[Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/)** [released several tools](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/03/23/use-our-suite-of-ethereum-security-tools/) in March 2018 (who also maintain a useful list of resources [here](https://github.com/trailofbits/awesome-ethereum-security)), including static analysis tools, fuzzing tools, and more. **[Securify](https://securify.chainsecurity.com/)**, an automated security scanner for Ethereum smart contracts, was [released in July 2018](https://medium.com/chainsecurity/researchers-release-a-free-state-of-the-art-security-scanner-for-ethereum-smart-contracts-b58b57ce0e38). **Mythril**, a security analysis tool initially released in 2017, became a platform and re-branded to **[MythX](https://twitter.com/mythx_platform)**.\n\n**The Ethereum security community made progress towards “best practices”**, though the community doesn’t always agree on all of them. Valuable resources like the **[Smart Contract Weakness registry](https://smartcontractsecurity.github.io/SWC-registry/)** helped the industry share best practices and common anti-patterns. Notable “traditional” security researchers began working in the Ethereum space, including **[Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/)** and **[Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/)**, adding to the stable of high-quality auditing firms already working in the space.\n\nDespite this progress, there’s still significant work required. In particular [better formal verification frameworks and tooling](https://media.consensys.net/how-formal-verification-can-ensure-flawless-smart-contracts-cbda8ad99bd1), which is a consistent complaint from developers building on Ethereum.\n\n## **Infrastructure**\n\nEthereum’s primary clients — **[Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)** and **[Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum)** — continued to be improved and refined, thanks to essential work by their development teams. New clients were released, like **[Pantheon](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/pantheon)** in Java and **[Nethermind](http://nethermind.io/)** in .NET Core.\n\n**There has long been an understanding that Ethereum needs to diversify the node infrastructure available to application developers**. This market has long been dominated by **[Infura](https://infura.io/)**, but in 2018 [many teams began working on alternatives](https://www.coindesk.com/the-race-is-on-to-replace-ethereums-most-centralized-layer).\n\n**[Dappnode](https://dappnode.io/)**, a project to make it cheap & easy to run a personal Ethereum node, [launched in July](https://medium.com/@DAppNode/dappnode-the-infrastructure-for-the-decentralized-world-85983b16db14) (you can even [buy a pre-configured one](https://ava.do/)). **[VIP node](https://vipnode.org/)**, a service that allows users to “subscribe” to node access thereby creating an incentive for more full nodes, [went live this year](https://medium.com/vipnode/an-economic-incentive-for-running-ethereum-full-nodes-ecc0c9ebe22). **[Denode](https://github.com/ChainSafeSystems/denode)**, a project that similarly seeks to provide market incentives for more decentralized node infrastructure, received a grant from the Ethereum Foundation in September. Other projects — like **[LightJS](https://github.com/paritytech/js-libs)** by Parity, [released in November](https://www.parity.io/light-js-how-to-build-your-dapp-on-a-light-client/) — make it easier for developers to build dapps that don’t need to rely on full nodes.\n\nDecentralized storage solutions like **[IPFS](https://blog.ipfs.io/)** and **[Swarm](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/06/21/announcing-swarm-proof-of-concept-release-3/)** continued to make progress. Swarm POC3 was [released in June](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/06/21/announcing-swarm-proof-of-concept-release-3/), and now includes a messaging layer. The **[Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/)** (ENS), a decentralized service that lets people use human-readable names (like alice.eth) in place of Ethereum addresses, [launched a mainnet integration](https://easydns.com/blog/2018/09/02/ethereum-name-service-ens-integration-now-live-on-mainnet/) with the .xyz domain registry (September 2018), and [announced](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/luxe-launch-looms-a70c950ffd43) a planned integration with .luxe.\n\n## **Developer collaboration across the ecosystem improved**\n\n**The global community of Ethereum researchers & developers got better at working with each other in 2018.** The primary forum for cryptoeconomic research on Ethereum — **[ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/)** — only launched in August 2017, and was not widely used until early 2018. **Today it is the de-facto R&D hub for Ethereum**, and an essential technical resource for everything from plasma to sharding.\n\nThe very first Plasma researcher’s call didn’t happen until [January 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DPftmg7zR8), and the first state [channels researcher calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czb9Zh8P1y4) weren’t until August 2018. **There are now many [public calls](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wg_eX-mYopvWT3LeHe4-FEHOtJoG28h8YcHl4PFTX5k/edit#gid=0)** related to Ethereum development, ranging from core development of the protocol, to layer 2 tech, to individual areas like curation markets or product management.\n\nThe **[ETHSecurity community](https://medium.com/coinmonks/learnings-from-the-ethsecurity-community-57431ae0ed5e)** formed in mid 2018 to try and share best practices and shared learnings. The **[fellowship of Ethereum magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/)** — a community of Ethereum developers aimed at producing better EIPs and improving Ethereum’s technical maintenance — launched in early 2018.\n\n**[Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)**, a project that facilitates bounties for open-source development, launched their pilot in November 2017. In 2018, their platform was used to pay out \\~$500,000 in bounties and grants to more than 700 developers.\n\n## **Hackathons became a big deal**\n\nIn October 2017 **[ETHWaterloo](http://ethwaterloo.com/)** set a record as the largest Ethereum hackathon ever, which was quickly beaten by **[ETHDenver](http://2018.ethdenver.com/)** in February 2018. Over the rest of the year, there were 6 more **[ETHGlobal](http://ethglobal.co/)** hackathons that served more than 5,800 developers, as well as other events like [ETHMemphis](https://ethmemphis.com/) and two hackathons held by [Status](https://dev.status.im/).\n\n**In 2018 it was finally *practical* to run an Ethereum hackathon** — there were enough developers who wanted to learn how to build on this tech, the ecosystem was varied enough that they had many interesting projects to work on, and the tools were mature enough that it was actually feasible to build a working demo in 36 hours. Many of the individual projects mentioned above — including the **[Goerli testnet](https://www.ethnews.com/the-goerli-testnet-has-arrived)**, **[Set protocol](https://www.setprotocol.com/)**, **[Denode](https://github.com/ChainSafeSystems/denode)**, and **[Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)** were conceived or launched at ETHGlobal events.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Fjcwnh2okNwTooXE2Kbimg.png)\n\n## **4. Layer 2: research, development, and live on mainnet**\n\n**One of the early narratives about 2018 is that it would be [the year of Ethereum’s layer 2 scalability solutions](https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-ethereums-layer-2-scaling-solutions-state-channels-plasma-and-truebit-22cb40dcc2f4)**.\n\nThe idea behind layer 2 scalability is to off-load computation from Ethereum onto “off chain” systems, while still retaining a blockchain’s characteristic security guarantees. These off-chain systems can process transactions faster and more efficiently than the Ethereum main-chain, leading to more scalable payments or smart-contracts.\n\n In 2017, there were no significant state channel or plasma chain projects live on mainnet, and few people understood the technology or its potential. What happened in 2018?\n\n## **State & Payment Channels**\n\n[State channels](https://www.jeffcoleman.ca/state-channels/) **are the most basic layer 2 technique.** At the start of 2018, there were several custom-built channels applications still under development. Today, many of those projects have launched to main-chain, and critical infrastructure has been built that will soon radically shorten the development cycle for channelized solutions.\n\n**[Spankchain](https://spankchain.com/)** (micropayments through payment channels) launched their beta in April, and have been live in production ever since. **[Funfair](https://funfair.io/)** (casino games running in state channels) launched to mainnet in September. **[Connext](https://connext.network/)** (payment channel hubs for micropayments) launched their [first non-custodial hub on mainnet](https://medium.com/connext/our-first-hub-is-live-on-mainnet-b5660486635e) in September in collaboration with Spankchain. **[Celer Network](https://celer.network/)** (a state channel network & liquidity solution) launched their [testnet & demo apps in October](https://medium.com/celer-network/lighting-up-the-centauri-celer-network-sdk-and-testnet-launch-at-sfbw-7e257062b7af). **[Raiden](http://raiden.network/)**, the long-anticipated ERC20 payment channel network, launched their [alpha release running live on mainnet](https://medium.com/raiden-network/red-eyes-mainnet-release-announcement-d48235bbef3c) in December.\n\nThe number of live projects using channels will only increase as the technology becomes easier for developers to use. **[Counterfactual](https://counterfactual.com/)** (a framework that makes it easier to build a channelized application) published their work on generalized state channels in June, [open-sourced all their code](https://medium.com/statechannels/development-update-0-11-12-2018-b7002de5282e) in November, and is launching a full demo environment in January 2019. **[Magmo](https://magmo.com/)**, a framework for a specific subset of channelizable applications (“[force move games](https://medium.com/magmo/an-overview-of-the-force-move-games-framework-for-state-channels-ff28f0962b07)”) using state channels, [released a demo application at DevconIV](https://medium.com/magmo/we-launched-an-example-state-channel-app-17246bd98b05).\n\n## **Plasma**\n\n**[Plasma](http://plasma.io/)** is a scaling technique where operations are moved off-chain into a *secondary* blockchain, where they can be performed faster and at lower cost.\n\nThe idea is based on “sidechains”, originally [a proposal to scale bitcoin dating back to 2014](https://www.blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf). **Plasma introduced a novel improvement:** unlike on a sidechain, a user of a Plasma chain would always have a guarantee that they can withdraw their assets to main-chain, even if the operator of that Plasma chain tried to censor or steal from them.\n\n**Plasma research has made large strides since the paper release in August 2017, though the technology remains further from production than state channels.** The year began with only a few teams actively working on Plasma, as the research community began to explore various tradeoff and design choices within a family of related techniques derived from the original paper.\n\nThe majority of these designs have focused on the simplest use case: payments. These designs include **Plasma MVP** ([introduced by Vitalik in January 2018](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-viable-plasma/426)) and **Plasma Cash** ([introduced by Vitalik & Karl in March](https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-cash-plasma-with-much-less-per-user-data-checking/1298), and the subject of [continuing formal work](https://github.com/loomnetwork/plasma-paper/blob/master/plasma_cash.pdf)). More recently, researchers have begun exploring zero-knowledge-proof based Plasma-like designs like the “**Rollup**” ([introduced by Barry Whitehat](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/roll_up) in September).\n\n**Each of these can be augmented to mitigate their shortcomings, while minimizing tradeoffs.** This unfortunately resulted in a “naming meme”, where each new tweak on an existing design was given a unique name, leading to significant confusion for anyone not deeply involved in the research community. Useful taxonomies that divide up the design space are a work in progress.\n\n**At the same time, research continued into expanding Plasma beyond payments**. While this work continues, current consensus among researchers is that an optimized “full EVM” plasma (which could run any smart contract) is a [complex challenge.](https://medium.com/@kelvinfichter/why-is-evm-on-plasma-hard-bf2d99c48df7)\n\nThis broad exploration of a large design space has been productive for researchers, but practical implementations are still mostly theoretical or in early stages. One exception is the Plasma Cash implementation built by Loom, [released in June 2018](https://medium.com/loom-network/plasma-cash-initial-release-plasma-backed-nfts-now-available-on-loom-network-sidechains-37976d0cfccd).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Fjcwnh2okNwTooXE2Kbimg.png)\n\n## **5. Zero Knowledge is coming**\n\nOver the past year the Ethereum developer community began to appreciate that **new zero-knowledge technology will have a significant impact on blockchain technologies**. Over the past 12 months, it has felt like every technical conversation in the Ethereum community takes the form of “*well, we can do it this way for now, but of course once we have good zkSTARKs, it will be like this…*”.\n\nMost people in the crypto industry will have heard of [zero-knowledge tech](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/27/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer/), most famously used in the privacy cryptocurrency Zcash. But zero-knowledge technology won’t just be used for privacy. It has important implications for many *scalability* techniques as well. Recent research and development into this technology (specifically, a class of zero-knowledge tech called **zkSTARKs**) may dramatically lower the computational cost required to use them in production, opening up new opportunities to integrate them with programmable blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nIn short, **[zero-knowledge proofs](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/12433/zero-knowledge-proof-protocol-example)** let us prove that some operation happened, without having to share the underlying data. If the verification of that proof can be done cheaply enough, then it could let Ethereum smart-contracts verify that an operation took place off-chain. This means that we could, for instance, conduct [large numbers of operations off-chain, and then cheaply verify that they happened](https://ethresear.ch/t/on-chain-scaling-to-potentially-500-tx-sec-through-mass-tx-validation/3477). Or, we could conduct intensive computation off-chain, and still have it verified on-chain.\n\n**2018 was the year that the full potential of zero-knowledge tech started to sink in.** In January, Eli Ben-Sasson & his co-authors [published their long-awaited paper on zkSTARKs.](https://www.coindesk.com/white-paper-trustless-privacy-tech-zk-starks-published) The Ethereum community began to work on how this technology can be used for scaling and in conjunction with other technologies, [like Plasma](https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-is-plasma/2195). On the layer 1 side, developers made plans to ensure that ETH 2.0 has the requisite support for zkSTARKs, like STARK[-friendly hash functions](https://ethresear.ch/t/hash-based-vdfs-mimc-and-starks/2337).\n\nNew zkSNARK libraries were released, like iden3’s **[snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs)** and **[circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom)**, adding to existing libraries like **[Zokrates](https://github.com/Zokrates/ZoKrates)**. In December 2018 a team at [ETHSingapore built a zkSNARK “rollup”](https://devpost.com/software/plasma-winter) scaling proof of concept, later released on testnet as the ([not technically Plasma](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1082054495956291584)) **[Plasma Ignis](https://twitter.com/TheMatter_io/status/1081959506454695936)**. BarryWhiteHat [contributed critical work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv6iK9qezBY) on using zkSNARKs on Ethereum. And Ben-Sasson & others launched **[Starkware](https://www.starkware.co/)**, a company aimed at commercial applications of zkSTARKs, and received a [$4mm grant](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/08/17/ethereum-foundation-grants-update-wave-3/) from the Ethereum Foundation.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Fjcwnh2okNwTooXE2Kbimg.png)\n\n## **6. The Road to ETH 2.0**\n\nETH 2.0 is the name for the long-term research and development of the Ethereum platform, incorporating fundamental base-layer upgrades like [Proof of Stake](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQs) and [Sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQs).\n\nThe history of ETH 2.0, aka Serenity, has featured false starts, dead ends and more false starts. **But in 2018, the long-term Ethereum roadmap began to solidify.**\n\nIn January 2018, the **[FFG testnet](https://hackmd.io/s/Hk6UiFU7z)**[ launched](https://hackmd.io/s/Hk6UiFU7z), though it suffered from networking issues that made it difficult to use. A few months later however, the research direction moved away from FFG, and towards a plan that would see Casper and Sharding implemented together. In Q2, consensus began to form around what is now the [current plan](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/serenity-phases).\n\nExplaining ETH 2.0 is beyond the scope of this post. If you want to get caught up, we recommend **EthHub**’s summary [here](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/serenity-phases), **[Vitalik’s](https://youtu.be/kCVpDrlVesA)**[ talk from DevconIV](https://youtu.be/kCVpDrlVesA), or **[James Prestwich’s](https://hackernoon.com/what-to-expect-when-eths-expecting-80cb4951afcd)**[ recent guide](https://hackernoon.com/what-to-expect-when-eths-expecting-80cb4951afcd)**.**\n\n**Once the research vision was clear, it was possible to [create a specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs)** for what became known as “ETH 2.0”. This allowed [many different engineering teams](https://www.coindesk.com/next-gen-buidlers-the-8-teams-working-on-ethereum-2-0) to begin implementing that specification into client software. At the end of 2018, there were at least 8 teams building clients for ETH 2.0. Recently, Ben Edgington also began a [weekly newsletter which closely tracks the research and implementation of ETH 2.0](https://notes.ethereum.org/c/Sk8Zs--CQ).\n\nWhile all roadmaps are subject to change and projections are uncertain, the beacon chain is expected to go live in 2019, with a beacon chain testnet scheduled to happen in the next few months. The beacon chain will allow ETH holders to choose to transfer their ETH to the beacon chain in order to earn rewards as a validator. However, that ETH cannot be transferred back to the “ETH 1” chain.\n\nThe next phase will include shards, which will be managed by the beacon chain. It’s also possible that the [beacon chain will be used to finalize](https://ethresear.ch/t/using-the-beacon-chain-to-pos-finalize-the-ethereum-1-0-chain/4521) the current proof of work chain, somewhat similar to the way that FFG was once planned a year ago to be used for finalization.\n\n**While the roadmap has considerably firmed up, there are still [unsolved problems in blockchain sharding](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/unsolved-problems-in-blockchain-sharding-2327d6517f43)**. While the first few phases are relatively clear and there are no [significant unsolved theoretical problems left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkMZdbzKZ9k), plenty of interesting research and implementation problems remain for future phases so that we get to a truly scalable layer 1 of Ethereum.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Fjcwnh2okNwTooXE2Kbimg.png)\n\n## **What did it all mean?**\n\n**We warned you this post would be long**. But it’s still not comprehensive. A lot more happened in the Ethereum ecosystem this year, including a few developments worth noting quickly here:\n\n* **Ethereum core developers** **[came to rough consensus on a set of short-term upgrades](https://ethereum-magicians.org/c/working-groups/ethereum-1-x-ring)** to the current Ethereum protocol (“Ethereum 1.X”), while ETH 2.0 is under development\n* Re**gulators across the world** **[started paying attention to cryptocurrency](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/14/bitcoin-and-ethereum-are-not-securities-but-some-cryptocurrencies-may-be-sec-official-says.html)**, including securities regulators. Many jurisdictions are now in the process of deciding how digital assets, like the kind that can be created on Ethereum, are treated under law.\n* **Non-plasma sidechain technology**, like **[POA network](https://poa.network/)** and **[Parity-bridge](https://www.parity.io/bridging-the-dapp-scaling-now-with-parity-bridge/)**, launched into production\n* **UX made progress**, like [Universal Logins](https://medium.com/@avsa/universal-logins-first-demo-1dc8b17a8de7) and [meta transactions](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/ethereum-meta-transactions-90ccf0859e84)\n* **The Ethereum Foundation** **[launched a grants program](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/03/07/announcing-beneficiaries-ethereum-foundation-grants/)** to fund critical work from across the community.\n\nShould we view this year as a success, or a setback?\n\nA strange thing about this moment in Ethereum’s history is that you will receive wildly different answers depending on someone’s frame of reference.\n\n**If your baseline is 2015–2016**, you remember when Ethereum was still *firmly* an experiment, with virtually no users, developer tools, or even applications. The contrast with 2018 is startling. There are real applications now, live on mainnet, that provide real utility to their users — even if those user bases remain small. **The thing we believed could happen, which may have once seemed impossible, is starting to happen, in bits and pieces.**\n\n**But if your frame of reference is the hyped up narrative sold to you by ICO whitepapers and glossy keynote conferences**, then it must be disappointing. Mass adoption not only has not yet arrived, but remains over the horizon. There are hard problems yet to be solved, and the technical progress zigs and zags, instead of following the comforting straight line of a tidy infographic roadmap.\n\n**Welcome to the real.** There are experiments to be run, lessons to be learned, and [hard problems](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fpecAJLG9czABgCe9/on-doing-the-impossible) to solve. Grab a shovel, and see you next year.\n\n*— Josh Stark ([L4](http://l4v.io/)), Evan Van Ness ([Week in Ethereum](http://weekinethereum.com/), [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/)*), and Daniel Zakrisson (*[hardfork.se](https://www.hardfork.se/))*\n\n*Thanks to Georgios Konstantopoulos, Jeff Coleman, Spencer Noon, Alex Wade, Xuanji Li, Danny Ryan, Heather Davidson, Gregor Zavcer, Mike McDonald, Corey Petty, Ameen Soleimani, Jens Frid, and others who took time to answer questions and contribute to the creation of this article.*", "timestamp": 1632431069, "digest": "w5DBtrkxEl2lI3P1RxmkVhqIhrp19g5zqU-RcZMR3ZQ", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}
