In that time, dozens of people and over five development teams have worked to specify, audit, implement, test and communicate this highly-anticipated upgrade to Ethereum’s fee market.\n\nThroughout this process, the community has been incredibly supportive. We've seen a massive grassroots movement emerge, consistently eager to contribute time, resources, and funds to get this EIP across the finish line and deployed on mainnet. With the London hard fork [scheduled for August 3-5](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/07/15/london-mainnet-announcement/), we are now in the final stages of this process.\n\n### Shaping Positive Outcomes\n\nDespite recent progress, challenges remain for the maintainers of Ethereum Public Goods. The people who choose to work on them often have a very high opportunity cost and limited methods available to capture the upside from their work.\n\nEIP-1559 is a great example of this. It was an incredibly complex change, the largest done on Ethereum mainnet to date, which will improve both the user experience and economics of the entire network. And yet, the engineers, researchers, and other contributors will not directly capture any of the ultimate benefit to network.\n\n### Presenting the 1559 NFT Series\n\nAs an experiment in providing cultural prestige & economic upside to EIP-1559 Contributors, we are issuing a limited series of **EIP-1559 NFTs**. This series was created by [@_kitteh](https://twitter.com/_kittehdesign), who has previously created artworks centered on Public Goods recognition. All proceeds from NFT minting are trustlessly forwarded to EIP-1559 contributors using a split contract. These include:\n\n- EIP authors (15%);\n- client teams who iterated on early versions of EIP-1559 to get the spec to where it is today (49%); [0]\n- researchers who analyzed the economic and technical impacts of the change (16%);\n- folks who helped manage the effort and communicate progress to the community (12%);\n- many others who helped extensively with testing to ensure the EIP was safe to deploy to mainnet (6%).\n\nThe remaining 2% of the allocation was given to @_kitteh for their work creating the actual NFTs\n\n### Artist Statement: _kitteh\n\n> I set out to visualize the collaborative process of developers and community as they shape Ethereum. \n>\n> These two groups, represented by the two differently coloured hands, have the same golden life force flowing through them. The hands slowly rotate around \"the Node,\" which represents the collective network. A mesh of silver strings bridge between hand and Node, visualizing the Ethereum change process.\n> \n> Since EIP-1559 is such a fundamental change to the core workings of Ethereum, I placed the numbers 1-5-5-9 exactly there - directly within the delicate etched metal Node. \n>\n> For the 1559 Patron NFT, I further emphasized the different dimensions in which the developers and community usually reside. Yet, the most amazing things are built by crossing the frame's threshold to the other realm, allowing you to see the situations at hand from another perspective.

A dance of creator and user. \n>\n> So we continue on, infinitely dancing across dimensions as we build a better Ethereum.\n___\n\nIf you would like to show support to the 1559 contributors even though the Supporter NFT is sold out, any ETH sent to this split contract will be automatically sent to them. **Note: the contract only supports ETH, tokens sent to it will be lost.**\n\n[EIP-1559 Contributor Set](split://0x2510C039cc3b061D79e564b38836dA87e31b342f?network=mainnet)\n\nFor those who want to go above and beyond in signaling their support, we are auctioning a premium one-of-one: the **1559 Patron Edition**.

The new BED Index is now [live](https://www.indexcoop.com/bed) Thursday, July 22nd. If you’re unfamiliar, BED is an equal weight index of Bitcoin ($BTC), Ethereum ($ETH), and DeFi Pulse Index ($DPI). $BED is managed by the Index Coop and rebalances the first [Friday](https://vote.indexcoop.com/#/index-coop.eth/proposal/QmbGj5P9oJZWjoybkaKhAZD5ELmexN4zKJAe6VViu9kUJN) of every month. The goal of the index is to give people an easy way to get a balanced exposure to the main themes in crypto: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi. Better yet, the BED index self-manages so it’s a great alternative for those that don't want to go through the hassle of constantly rebalancing their portfolio. The gist: buy $BED, “set it and forget it”, or HODL, and *sleep well at night*.\n\n![Design Credit: @netsynq](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3a2b8d6e-1161-42be-9f80-cb89c73af338.png?height=350&width=350)\n\n### What is an Index Token?\n\nBefore we get into ahem, BED, let’s cover what an index token is. Index tokens hold a group of assets and provide investors exposure to them through one financial instrument. A TradFi example of Index tokens exists with ETFs. You’ve heard of the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ. Well those are bundles of stocks under one umbrella. Instead of buying 500 stocks, or every major tech company, ETFs offer weighted exposure to the whole thing, and rebalances regularly for you. \n\nThe $BED Index Token does exactly that for crypto. Think of $BED as an umbrella for cryptocurrency, where the strength of its pole is Bitcoin, the grip of the handle is Ethereum, and the mitigated risk of an open umbrella is the wide-reaching DeFi sector. \n\n\n### Why $BED?\n\n\nCurrently, most people interested in cryptocurrency recognize Bitcoin as a store of value. Maybe they don’t understand cryptography, but they know it’s **safe**. That’s partially why it has a market cap of over $600 Billion. Bitcoin is not going anywhere. So it makes sense that a third of the money under your $BED mattress be Bitcoin. *Check*. \n\nNext, many more have come to recognize Ethereum as programmable money that forms the base layer of decentralized finance. Ethereum’s market cap is currently over $235 Billion. Most DeFi tools are built on it. So, another third of the pie goes to Ethereum. *Check*.\n\nLastly, people that appreciate the potential, however risky, of these first two assets often want more exposure to the top blue-chip tokens in decentralized finance (DeFi). Many new investors are overwhelmed by the number of tokens available in the DeFi sector and miss opportunities to invest in the top protocols.\n\n![Image credit: [Lemonade Alpha](https://medium.com/indexcoop/recommending-crypto-to-friends-family-just-became-10x-easier-ccb57ea1903a)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cbf8dc24-c591-4ba2-bbd7-70188a5e70d4.png?height=809&width=1216)\n\n\n\n\nThe DeFi Pulse Index ($DPI) contains 14 different crypto assets, nearly 70% of which is a weighted mixture of Uniswap (22.99%), AAVE (20.51%), Maker DAO (12.99%), and Compound Finance (12.54%). These are the assets that have pioneered and continue to pave the road of DeFi. The next three assets by weight class are Synthetix (9.38%), Sushiswap (7.71%) and Yearn Finance (6.54%). These could be considered the second wave for DeFi. Combined and that’s over 90% of the pie. The last portion of the DPI includes a wake of emerging DeFi instruments (REN, LRC, KNC, BAL, CREAM, FARM, & MTA). A third of the $BED Index token invests in DPI to capture these high-quality crypto assets disrupting the world of traditional finance. \n \n### BED Rebalancing\n\nWhen you buy $BED, you have a fully collateralized investment divided in thirds across all of these sectors, and the maintenance done for you. The $BED Index token regularly rebalances to maintain an equal distribution of Bitcoin, Ethereum and DeFi. That’s 33.33% each. When any one of the three assets becomes overweight, the extra weight is rebalanced across the other two assets on the first Friday day of every month. \n\nWithin the DPI portion of $BED, any asset of the 14 tokens exceeding 25% weight is chopped down and redistributed. This valve is designed for the same purpose, to reduce any part of the DeFi sector that is too heavy.\n\n\n### It's Bedtime!\n\nBy investing in this Bankless $BED Index Token, you not only get your Bitcoin and Ethereum, but you gain risk-averse exposure to DeFi. This is the no-brainer investment vehicle for you to share with anybody who understands the volatility of this emerging market, but wants to gain exposure to the emerging crypto economy. \n\n$BED is for your uncle who asks you about “Bitcoins” over a holiday dinner, your intramural teammate that heard “Ethereum was the new bitcoin” and wants to know more, or that friend from high school that hit you up on Facebook because they have a little extra cash to invest and want to know more about this “DeFi” thing. And that’s for the well-informed people. Importantly, this is a great way to have your friends avoid the laundry list of scammy coins that plague the market. No more answering questions about dog tokens or ETH killers--just tell them to go to BED. \n\nBuying $BED provides risk-optimized exposure to what is possibly the fastest growing economic space since the Internet. But as we learned during the dot com boom, if you just bought one dot com company it could go bust. Instead, the smart money says spread yourself out across the most reliable and risk-averse elements within a burgeoning and innovative industry. \n\nWith $BED you know what’s under your mattress, and you trust that the Index Coop’s technology will track it every day, rebalance it every month, and, essentially, make your $BED nice and neat for you. \n\nIt’s BED time. Sweet dreams. \n\n*[To learn more about how to mint or buy BED, check out this [guide](https://www.notion.so/BED-Index-How-to-Guide-bd5898adb96541ff9aadc4ca02d85389).]*\n\n*=[*This article does not contain financial advice, only educational information and product related data on how the $BED Index Token works.

The gist: buy $BED, “set it and forget it”, or HODL, and *sleep well at night*.\n\n### What is an Index Token?\n\nBefore we get into ahem, BED, let’s cover what an index token is. Index tokens hold a group of assets and provide investors exposure to them through one financial instrument. A TradFi example of Index tokens exists with ETFs. You’ve heard of the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ. Well those are bundles of stocks under one umbrella. Instead of buying 500 stocks, or every major tech company, ETFs offer weighted exposure to the whole thing, and rebalances regularly for you. \n\nThe $BED Index Token does exactly that for crypto. Think of $BED as an umbrella for cryptocurrency, where the strength of its pole is Bitcoin, the grip of the handle is Ethereum, and the mitigated risk of an open umbrella is the wide-reaching DeFi sector. \n\n\n### Why $BED?\n\n\nCurrently, most people interested in cryptocurrency recognize Bitcoin as a store of value. Maybe they don’t understand cryptography, but they know it’s **safe**. That’s partially why it has a market cap of over $600 Billion. Bitcoin is not going anywhere. So it makes sense that a third of the money under your $BED mattress be Bitcoin. *Check*. \n\nNext, many more have come to recognize Ethereum as programmable money that forms the base layer of decentralized finance. Ethereum’s market cap is currently over $235 Billion. Most DeFi tools are built on it. So, another third of the pie goes to Ethereum. *Check*.\n\nLastly, people that appreciate the potential, however risky, of these first two assets often want more exposure to the top blue-chip tokens in decentralized finance (DeFi). Many new investors are overwhelmed by the number of tokens available in the DeFi sector and miss opportunities to invest in the top protocols.\n\n![Image credit: [Lemonade Alpha](https://medium.com/indexcoop/recommending-crypto-to-friends-family-just-became-10x-easier-ccb57ea1903a)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cbf8dc24-c591-4ba2-bbd7-70188a5e70d4.png?height=809&width=1216)\n\n\n\n\nThe DeFi Pulse Index ($DPI) contains 14 different crypto assets, nearly 70% of which is a weighted mixture of Uniswap (22.99%), AAVE (20.51%), Maker DAO (12.99%), and Compound Finance (12.54%). These are the assets that have pioneered and continue to pave the road of DeFi. The next three assets by weight class are Synthetix (9.38%), Sushiswap (7.71%) and Yearn Finance (6.54%). These could be considered the second wave for DeFi. Combined and that’s over 90% of the pie. The last portion of the DPI includes a wake of emerging DeFi instruments (REN, LRC, KNC, BAL, CREAM, FARM, & MTA). A third of the $BED Index token invests in DPI to capture these high-quality crypto assets disrupting the world of traditional finance. \n \n### BED Rebalancing\n\nWhen you buy $BED, you have a fully collateralized investment divided in thirds across all of these sectors, and the maintenance done for you. The $BED Index token regularly rebalances to maintain an equal distribution of Bitcoin, Ethereum and DeFi. That’s 33.33% each. When any one of the three assets becomes overweight, the extra weight is rebalanced across the other two assets on the first Friday day of every month. \n\nWithin the DPI portion of $BED, any asset of the 14 tokens exceeding 25% weight is chopped down and redistributed. This valve is designed for the same purpose, to reduce any part of the DeFi sector that is too heavy.\n\n\n### It's Bedtime!\n\nBy investing in this Bankless $BED Index Token, you not only get your Bitcoin and Ethereum, but you gain risk-averse exposure to DeFi. This is the no-brainer investment vehicle for you to share with anybody who understands the volatility of this emerging market, but wants to gain exposure to the emerging crypto economy. \n\n$BED is for your uncle who asks you about “Bitcoins” over a holiday dinner, your intramural teammate that heard “Ethereum was the new bitcoin” and wants to know more, or that friend from high school that hit you up on Facebook because they have a little extra cash to invest and want to know more about this “DeFi” thing. And that’s for the well-informed people. Importantly, this is a great way to have your friends avoid the laundry list of scammy coins that plague the market. No more answering questions about dog tokens or ETH killers--just tell them to go to BED. \n\nBuying $BED provides risk-optimized exposure to what is possibly the fastest growing economic space since the Internet. But as we learned during the dot com boom, if you just bought one dot com company it could go bust. Instead, the smart money says spread yourself out across the most reliable and risk-averse elements within a burgeoning and innovative industry. \n\nWith $BED you know what’s under your mattress, and you trust that the Index Coop’s technology will track it every day, rebalance it every month, and, essentially, make your $BED nice and neat for you. \n\nIt’s BED time. Sweet dreams. \n\n*[To learn more about how to mint or buy BED, check out this [guide](https://www.notion.so/BED-Index-How-to-Guide-bd5898adb96541ff9aadc4ca02d85389).]*\n\n*=[*This article does not contain financial advice, only educational information and product related data on how the $BED Index Token works.

Maybe they don’t understand cryptography, but they know it’s **safe**. That’s partially why it has a market cap of over $600 Billion. Bitcoin is not going anywhere.

These are the assets that have pioneered and continue to pave the road of DeFi. The next three assets by weight class are Synthetix (9.38%), Sushiswap (7.71%) and Yearn Finance (6.54%).

The $BED Index token regularly rebalances to maintain an equal distribution of Bitcoin, Ethereum and DeFi. That’s 33.33% each. When any one of the three assets becomes overweight, the extra weight is rebalanced across the other two assets on the first Friday day of every month. \n\nWithin the DPI portion of $BED, any asset of the 14 tokens exceeding 25% weight is chopped down and redistributed.

The new BED Index is now [live](https://www.indexcoop.com/bed) Thursday, July 22nd. If you’re unfamiliar, BED is an equal weight index of Bitcoin ($BTC), Ethereum ($ETH), and DeFi Pulse Index ($DPI). $BED is managed by the Index Coop and rebalances the first [Friday](https://vote.indexcoop.com/#/index-coop.eth/proposal/QmbGj5P9oJZWjoybkaKhAZD5ELmexN4zKJAe6VViu9kUJN) of every month. The goal of the index is to give people an easy way to get a balanced exposure to the main themes in crypto: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi. Better yet, the BED index self-manages so it’s a great alternative for those that don't want to go through the hassle of constantly rebalancing their portfolio. The gist: buy $BED, “set it and forget it”, or HODL, and *sleep well at night*.\n\n### What is an Index Token?\n\nBefore we get into ahem, BED, let’s cover what an index token is. Index tokens hold a group of assets and provide investors exposure to them through one financial instrument. A TradFi example of Index tokens exists with ETFs. You’ve heard of the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ. Well those are bundles of stocks under one umbrella. Instead of buying 500 stocks, or every major tech company, ETFs offer weighted exposure to the whole thing, and rebalances regularly for you. \n\nThe $BED Index Token does exactly that for crypto. Think of $BED as an umbrella for cryptocurrency, where the strength of its pole is Bitcoin, the grip of the handle is Ethereum, and the mitigated risk of an open umbrella is the wide-reaching DeFi sector. \n\n\n### Why $BED?\n\n\nCurrently, most people interested in cryptocurrency recognize Bitcoin as a store of value. Maybe they don’t understand cryptography, but they know it’s **safe**. That’s partially why it has a market cap of over $600 Billion. Bitcoin is not going anywhere. So it makes sense that a third of the money under your $BED mattress be Bitcoin. *Check*. \n\nNext, many more have come to recognize Ethereum as programmable money that forms the base layer of decentralized finance. Ethereum’s market cap is currently over $235 Billion. Most DeFi tools are built on it. So, another third of the pie goes to Ethereum. *Check*.\n\nLastly, people that appreciate the potential, however risky, of these first two assets often want more exposure to the top blue-chip tokens in decentralized finance (DeFi).

{"id": "gmQbJpx68DD5q98vZKGGMOja9zu1ky1sYndesKZw5Ok", "title": "INTERIOR 5", "body": "*Welcome to Interior, the only Mirror site to feature an entire post about a decades old micro-genre of electronic music! My name is [Jamison Isaak](https://jamisonisaak.com), and I've been making music as [Teen Daze](https://teendaze.bandcamp.com) for a decade now. I'm using this space to journal through the process of releasing my next full-length record, Interior. I've been covering a few of the [ins](https://teendaze.mirror.xyz/kGG4da2kr7fFBj1dqDByqGes-Kvl44AXXJLefM6gpCk) and [outs](https://teendaze.mirror.xyz/8pGjKENICls7h9_oxVMBc_58TS5iEooDw516RdwPRgY) of this process, and hopefully I've done so without getting too inside. This week, I'm talking about vinyl, and how to support artists in an increasingly post-physical world.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8b80e316-1d63-453e-911d-87aca3aea49c.png?height=1336&width=2498)\n\n\n\nI started off my last post talking about the strange situation that a lot of artists/labels are finding themselves in, in regards to vinyl production. The usual turnaround time (which, trust me, is not great), has been extended by a pretty significant amount. In the past few years, my records have usually taken about 3-4 months to be manufactured. It's become a part of the process, so I can't even really tell you if that's a long time or not. It just is what it is. In the last few months I've started to hear more and more stories about how long records have been taking at pressing plants, with the general consensus being that it's taking about 9 months.\n\nJust take a moment to put yourself in the shoes of an artist right now: you spent all last year at home, presumably making music (though I do know lots of people who had very little desire to spend their time inside trying to be creative), and let's say you make enough for a record. (I'm not even going to address the situation if you're not working with a label or distributor; a self-funded run of a modest amount, let's say 300 records, must be taking upwards of a year.) So you send it off the label, and they say, \"Alright, it'll be pressed in nine months. So, we'll see you in six months when we start releasing singles.\" Not every release timeline looks the same, but just think about making something that you really want to share with the world, and then having to wait nine months for it to come out.\n\nOkay, so enough hypotheticals. Here's my story: We (myself, my manager and the label) were initially told by the distributors that the records (it's a relatively small run of 750) would be ready by November. Then it got pushed to January. \n\nNot ideal, but not a big problem: two months after the digital version comes out, we'll throw a few extra tracks online, and push some attention to the vinyl release. People would understand. \n\nThen, last week, we got word that the record wasn't going to be manufactured until **May 2022**. Which is not great. That type of gap in between the digital and physical release would make it counterintuitive to do vinyl at all. We'd be spending a lot of money to make a record that we most likely wouldn't be able to sell. The hype from the album announcement/press/release shows would totally fizzle out, and considering how short our collective attention spans are, it would be foolish to think we could sell an entire pressing. We've also already got a lot of the wheels in motion on this thing (as I've been documenting), which is to say, that that release date in November is kind of already set.\n\nSo...*what do we do?*\n\nI started asking a lot of questions. Here's three that kept popping up.\n\n*Why are we producing vinyl at all?\n\nWhat inspires someone to purchase a record in 2021?\n\nIf people just want to support an artist, and don't care about the medium, can't we come up with a better way (as an industry/society) to make that happen?*\n\nIf this last year has emphasized anything to me, it's that we're living in an increasingly post-physical world. Ironically, we're still actually *very much* living in a physical world, where our physical bodies can be taken out by a viral disease, and the entire world can shut down because of it. What I mean is, we've made some huge steps towards being able to live life without having to actually need the physical world in the same way we've always needed it. \n\nWe're obviously seeing this across creative worlds with NFTs and DAOs (if you're not following what [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/), [Songcamp](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/) and [Leaving Records](https://leavingrecords.mirror.xyz/) are up to, I'd highly recommend digging into them). It felt like the perfect time to be asking these questions about why we should be producing physical products as musicians. Then, in the same breath, while a medium like vinyl is becoming seen as obsolete (again), it's only going to make it more appealing to a certain group of people. So what is my responsibility as an artist?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/71bf4675-ef23-497b-a837-1367c9ada979.png?height=1600&width=2560)\n\n\n\nLet's dig in to those three questions I posed above.\n\n**Why are we producing vinyl at all?**\n\nWhen I held the very first Teen Daze record pressed to vinyl in my hands, it was a legitimately special moment for me. To see a couple years worth of hard work, pressed down into not just a physical object, but specifically a medium that held so much cultural significance, it felt like I had accomplished something important. I grew up being obsessed with my parents' record collection, and as I became a teenager, and CDs became the dominant format, I started developing an understandable nostalgia for vinyl. When I was 18, I found a coloured pressing of the White Stripes' Elephant at the HMV in the West Edmonton Mall. This was in 2003, so that was pre vinyl resurgence. It was the first piece of vinyl that I didn't just inherit from my parents' collection. Almost 20 years later, and my Ikea record shelf is stocked full; it's really not a wild collection, maybe 500 pieces? But I know that the 18 year old me is swooning over it. \n\nIt's funny though: Present me is looking at it, and kind of rolling my eyes. It's kind of a waste of space. I'll probably throw a record on once a week or so? Most of the time, I'm playing music off my phone, through the bluetooth function on our living room speakers (the turntable is running through those speakers, by the way). Most of the time, it's just easier to stream something. That's the point of streaming, isn't it? Unlimited choice with total ease (but at what cost).\n\nAll this is to say: vinyl is not essential in order to listen to the music I want to listen to. It's kind cumbersome. It takes up space. If you don't have a decent turntable or speaker setup, it really doesn't sound better. It's demanding in a way that streaming isn't. OH, it's also *very* expensive to produce.\n\nBUT, there are some upsides to producing a run of vinyl as an artist! It helps supports not only the artists that make the music, but also the entire economy around them. The label, the distributors, the stores, they all see a cut of your $25. I know lots of people that work really hard in those positions, and they really do deserve to be paid for that hard work. I also still can't shake that nostalgic, warm feeling I have when I hold up a record, and really get an up close experience with the artwork. When I first bought that White Stripes record, I remember thinking, \"This is so much better than a CD.\" I didn't form a relationship with a CD in the same way that I did with vinyl. Let alone the feeling of having a contemporary album on a very dated format. It immediately made it feel special.\n\nIf I'm going to try and answer my original question, I'd guess that the reason vinyl is still being produced is because there are lots of people out there who get that same feeling as me. In that increasingly post-physical world, there are going to be those people who want to hold onto the past.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/50a071b9-d624-4bc3-802d-5f6f46973d67.JPG?height=3024&width=4032)\n\n\n\n**What inspires someone to purchase a record in 2021?**\n\nThis one I can only answer for myself, because I honestly don't know why someone would buy a Teen Daze record. Please, don't get me wrong, I LOVE IT when someone buys one of my records. Every time I see that \"Cha-ching!\" email from Bandcamp, I light up. It means the WORLD to me that someone would spend their hard earned money, to buy one of my records, when they can listen to it for free on the very site they bought the record from.\n\nSo then what inspires me personally. In the last couple months, I've bought two records that I have rinsed both physically and digitally: [Septet, by John Carroll Kirby](https://www.stonesthrow.com/store/septet/) (from Stone's Throw Records) and [Enter The Zenmenn, by The Zenmenn](https://www.musicfrommemory.com/release/6999/the-zenmenn/enter-the-zenmenn) (from Music From Memory).\n\nLet's start with Septet: I pre-ordered this record actually. John Carroll Kirby has become one of my favourite musicians over the last year, and as soon as I heard Rainmaker, the first single, I knew I had to do more than just stream this record. This was a *I need to spend money on this* kind of record. I would have loved to have copped a tape (which has really become my music medium of choice in the last year, but we're talking about vinyl, focus!) but I was more than happy to get the wax. This was not only just a *support* buy, where I just wanted to help an artist out financially regardless of the work, this was the kind of purchase where I want to support this artist financially because I'm so in love with what this artist produces, that hopefully the financial support will help them make more. Also worth noting, the artwork and design are beautiful, and it's just a nice thing to look at on a large, physical format.\n\n[Rainmaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3ob71OfLJY)\n\nOnto the Zenmenn. All the same things apply here (I'm truly obsessed with this record, and listen to it multiple times a day), PLUS I also purchased it from [Audiopile](https://audiopile.ca/), one of my favourite record stores in Vancouver. In this case, I'm not only supporting an artist and label that I love, but I'm throwing a few bucks to a record store, which I do believe is an important cultural hub. This one specifically exists in an expensive city, and I can't imagine it's easy to keep the lights on.\n\nSo what inspired me to buy those two records? Trying my best to support the artist, while also supporting the greater independent music economy. And getting a couple beautiful pieces of art in the process.\n\n[Flags Of The World Live in Germany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8ku9lo33Sw)\n\n**If people just want to support an artist, and don't care about the medium, can't we come up with a better way (as an industry/society) to make that happen?**\n\nI'm not even going to try and answer this one. All I know is that I've been trying to listen to as many conversations, and learn from people a lot smarter than me, to get some perspective on how this could happen. I think it's been clear for a little while now that our current state of affairs isn't working. It's weird to be operating in a time of transition and cultural shift, like we're experiencing right now, but it's exciting to possibly have a say in how the next world is going to operate.\n\nSo, let's experiment.\n\nThis post is going to be minted as an NFT. It's an opportunity for you to support me in what I do. There's no music involved, no physical product; just an experiment in support.\n\nThere's going to be plenty of opportunities to grab physical products that live in the world of this record (vinyl, tapes, clothing, print media?), but here's a chance to throw some ETH my way, strictly as a way to say \"keep doing what you're doing.\"\n\nZero expectations here, by the way.\n\nAlright, so if you've made it this far, I'm happy to treat you to a very happy ending. After spending these last few weeks of thinking about how a record release in 2021 can operate without doing vinyl, we got another message from the distributors: they were able to bump the pressing up in the manufacturer's queue. The records would be done in October. They'll be on shelves in December. I really wasn't expecting it, and it kind of makes having them all the more special. So when the preorder comes around in the fall, remember that they almost didn't exist. I'm also feeling insanely grateful, considering how many artists won't be this fortunate. Then again, maybe living in a post-vinyl world won't be all that bad.\n\nAlright. See you next time. Who knows what aspect of this process will be flipped on its head by then.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/58943168-8cb2-41d9-8815-1356023032ca.JPG?height=3024&width=3024)\n\n", "timestamp": 1627010400, "digest": "alwlSksE2jXJf51IXujk63_gSu9Pdtdw7SEQtxvJ4ko", "contributor": "0xEa83321A41c69070C971CD9Ca193366d6Be8DDC4"}

{"id": "M9NDbdYcTn0IkciWP5xPW0MEkuGzwi0XnBO95FU_qGI", "title": "Interview: Nathan Schneider on \"Exit to Community for Crypto Networks\"", "body": "BY AUSTIN ROBEY - [Austin](https://twitter.com/austinrobey_) is a contributor at Forefront and Co-founder of [Ampled](http://www.ampled.com).\n\n*In this conversation, Austin talks to Nathan Schneider, a proponent and leader of the [“Exit to Community”](https://e2c.how/) movement to learn more about its background and meaning, as well as its application within crypto networks. Nathan is an [author](https://nathanschneider.info/books/) and a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, where he directs the Media Enterprise Design Lab.*\n\n## What is the idea behind “Exit to Community”? What does it mean and where does it come from?\n\nIt’s not for everyone. Start talking with an average human being about “exit” and they’ll start looking for a red glowing sign or something. But talk about “exit” to a startup founder, and it means something very different. The exit is what nearly all investor-backed startups are for, what their founders are working toward, because that is what investors demand. Usually, the exit is when the startup gets sold to a bigger, generally more boring company, or when it “goes public” on a stock market and pieces of it get passed among countless buyers and sellers. That’s when investors, along with founders and early employees, get their payday. But for startups that build communities—of users, or workers, or whomever—the people who have come to rely on the startup most don’t benefit. They’re the asset, really, they’re what makes the startup valuable. So what if there were ways for that community to become its stewards in the end? That’s the possibility [we’re trying to make more of a reality](http://e2c.how/), more of a live option.\n\nFor me this comes out of years of work supporting startups beginning as co-ops—businesses owned and governed by the people who use them. But what about startups already out there, or ones where starting with a co-op isn’t the right fit? Initially the awesome lawyer [Jason Wiener](https://jrwiener.com/) and I were exploring the idea of “exit to co-op.” But co-ops are just one of many ways to organize community ownership—alongside nonprofits, trusts, LLCs, ESOPs, smart contracts, and combinations thereof and more. So [in 2019](https://hackernoon.com/startups-need-a-new-option-exit-to-community-ig12v2z73) I started opting for the maximum vagueness of “community.”\n\n## Tell us about your background as an advocate for cooperativism and collective ownership. How does that relate to the crypto space?\n\nTwo things happened for me in 2014: I became introduced to the Ethereum project, back when it was just a whitepaper, and I started [working](https://www.shareable.net/owning-is-the-new-sharing/) on what my collaborator Trebor Scholz [dubbed](https://medium.com/@trebors/platform-cooperativism-vs-the-sharing-economy-2ea737f1b5ad) “platform cooperativism.” That was a pivotal moment, when the early enthusiasm of the “sharing economy” was starting to froth over into anxiety about monopolism, labor abuses, and so forth—not real sharing. Both the cooperative tradition and the idea of building organizations with crypto offered the possibility of sharing ownership all the way down, to the core of the enterprise. They both seemed worth exploring. I [interviewed](https://www.shareable.net/meet-vitalik-buterin-the-20-year-old-who-is-decentralizing-everything/) Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin early on, for instance, and with Trebor co-organized the [first platform co-op conference](https://platform.coop/events/conference-2015/) in 2015. And so on. Over the years I have bounced back and forth between the old co-op tradition and the supposedly new crypto stuff. They have a lot to learn from each other, and each has its forms of depressing nonsense. I have found it consistently instructive to explore them in tandem.\n\n## There have been more and more people in the crypto space talk about “Exit to Community”. Are you surprised by that? Was that something you imagined happening? \n\nThat was not the goal. Early on, I and others were more interested in targeting standard startup accelerators like Techstars, which started here in Boulder. We were exploring how community exits might fit within the VC-backed trajectory, what profile of companies might be the best candidates. We were also exploring possibilities outside the US context; I did early talks on the idea in Brazil and China. But then also I began discussing the ideas with crypto people, like [Jesse Walden](https://variant.fund/past-present-future-from-co-ops-to-cryptonetworks/), now of Variant Fund, and [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki/) of Gitcoin. Clearly there was resonance. Kevin invited me to speak at the Web3 Summit in Denver just before Vitalik’s keynote, and I think that helped socialize the idea in blockchain-land. And then Vitalik [called](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1296963994637316096) it “optimal” in a tweet.\n\nBut read our [primer](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/medlab/2020/08/31/exit-community-community-primer) pamphlet on E2C. Crypto is barely in there. It was really an afterthought. That said, I’m grateful for the interest, and I think there are lots of exciting ways crypto can facilitate community ownership and governance. My focus, however, is honestly on how the idea can benefit people less tech-savvy and plugged in than crypto early-adopters.\n\n## I saw [this meme](https://twitter.com/exittocommunity/status/1412514303802961922?s=20) on the E2C Twitter account. How would you explain this?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4fef861f-c4a7-40b0-8253-dc65c5ab18ee.png?height=335&width=600)\n\nThat came out of endless text chatter between me and my much more meme-savvy collaborator [Danny Spitzberg](http://twitter.com/daspitzberg). Just a reflection of the strangeness of how much E2C has become associated with crypto. I imagine it makes no sense to most people, but for us it felt just about right.\n\n## Do you think there is a risk for the term “exit to community” becoming misinterpreted? \n\n**NS:** Already has been. “Community” to me does not mean a bunch of people brought together simply by their shared interest in shilling a speculative asset. It does not mean burning the precious time of our lives trading fragments of horrible companies on Robinhood. A community is in some sense a commons, something people share because it is valuable to them for its own sake, through which they become valuable to each other—as people. You said it pretty damn well [yourself](https://ff.mirror.xyz/ZRsr5HZMfbHOEe2lIYoWinRCI65NlvDW_QzEu1rn7As). So I object to applying E2C to every token launch or airdrop or whatever. I don’t have a litmus test, but I want to see some sense, as in the cooperative tradition, where the common good among people is more important than simply individuals making money in relative unison. Lately, I’ve been exploring some emerging strategies out there for carving out non-economic space in the midst of cryptoeconomics. Basically, I want to help create pathways for well-meaning crypto projects toward more genuine sorts of community ownership.\n\n## If you could imagine an ideal “exit to community” for a crypto network, what would that look like?\n\nI am on the edge of my seat. Goodness, how is anything ideal in crypto? What I love about crypto is that it is still such a playground, and there are so many ideas flying around at mach-a-million, and I love learning from them. But the important thing is that we get away from the crass economics of it all somehow. Human beings are more than receptacles of incentives. I have been interested to see how Gitcoin, for instance (and I’ve gotten sucked in as a token-holding participant), has centered the idea of “public goods” in the midst of all the incentives in its token launch recently. It is building community by reminding people that it’s not all about what you can get, but what you can share. The “quadratic lands” mythology tells a story, creates an experience. There’s a lot I know the Gitcoin folks wanted to do that they couldn’t, but they did a lot using cultural tools that wasn’t possible with technical and economic tools. Again, there is no ideal that I’m aware of, but it is exciting to see people try.\n\n## What’s the most exciting development in the “Exit to Community” space that you are seeing right now?\n\nAlso in Colorado (like Gitcoin), the [ETHDenver](http://ethdenver.com/) conference just did a token launch in the context of a legal cooperative. I’m really excited to see the democracy and humanity of the co-op tradition start to come together with the creativity and economic potential of crypto. It gives me great joy when people think they are reinventing the wheel, and do it so cleverly that they start rediscovering really old stuff. That’s when you know you’re on to something.\n\nI’m also really excited about the new [Zebras Unite co-op](https://zebrasunite.coop/), which is going to be an important new space for supporting startups aiming for community models, particularly coming from underrepresented founders. (I’m on the board of the sister nonprofit.) I love infrastructure. We need it terribly—the mentors, the funds, the policy tools, the culture. Terrible models are way too popular just because they happen to have lots of those things in place telling everyone they’re the only way.\n\n## Do you think we will see a mature tech company transition ownership to workers or users? \n\n**NS:** I have been speaking with leaders of several who are trying to do so. Stay tuned. The [founder of Meetup](https://medium.com/zebras-unite/meetup-to-the-people-how-a-zebra-could-rise-from-a-unicorns-fall-cfa93d83bcdc) has tried to make it work, but we weren’t ready with the right investors and so forth. And [Uber and Airbnb](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-let-users-own-the-tech-companies-they-help-build/) have indicated that they wish they could, at least a little. But companies that are less obscenely leveraged are where the real opportunities lie. The progress we have made in just a few years is amazing to me. The average founder cold-calling me used to be like “co-ops are cool, what’s a good business idea?”; now it’s like “I’ve got an awesome company that’s doing great, how can I make it accountable to the right people?” I long for this stuff to be so normal it’s boring, and we’re getting there.\n\n## What are examples of organizations that aren’t a good fit for an exit to community?\n\nHedge funds? Ponzi schemes? I don’t know. I mean, there are even projects like [Obran Cooperative](https://www.obran.org/) and [Empowered Ventures](https://empowered.ventures/) and [Main Street Phoenix](http://mainstreet.coop/) that are like private equity funds, except they’re owned by the workers of the portfolio companies. And it may be that some ventures are so intrinsically risky and capital intensive that it doesn’t make sense to expose their communities to that risk. But when they work out, what do you get? The question is kind of like saying, “Should any kind of organization not be accountable to its most natural stakeholders?” If the answer is no, that organization probably shouldn’t exist. To me the real question is how—which kind of community, and on what terms. That’s where this stuff gets challenging and fun.\n\nUltimately I think it would be nice to see something like Elizabeth Warren’s [proposal](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/15/17683022/elizabeth-warren-accountable-capitalism-corporations) to put workers on the boards of companies over a certain size. But maybe it should be that platforms over a certain size must have user oversight. Maybe a public-financed E2C could be the new IPO, the goal that founders and investors work toward. One way or another, we should make it normal that when people rely on something, it has some appropriate amount of accountability to them; when people create value for something, that value should come back to them.\n\n## What are your predictions for the E2C movement as it relates to the crypto space? Best case scenario? Worst case scenario?\n\nWorst case is peak co-optation: We all live in the Robinhood dystopia as anxious day-traders at the mercy of demonic institutions and have been persuaded to call ourselves a community. Using a word like “community” carries that risk. Best case, as I said, is a boring normalcy in which nobody has to talk about E2C anymore because it’s so normal: start a startup, exit to your community. Those of us trying to advance this concept day-to-day keep trying to remind ourselves of that: we’re out to make this work unnecessary.\n\n*Check out the [Exit to Community Primer](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/medlab/sites/default/files/attached-files/exittocommunityprimer-web.pdf) booklet from Media Enterprise Design Lab to learn more.*\n\n🙏 If you enjoyed this post, be sure to leave a tip.

In that time, dozens of people and over five development teams have worked to specify, audit, implement, test and communicate this highly-anticipated upgrade to Ethereum’s fee market.\n\nThroughout this process, the community has been incredibly supportive. We've seen a massive grassroots movement emerge, consistently eager to contribute time, resources, and funds to get this EIP across the finish line and deployed on mainnet. With the London hard fork [scheduled for August 3-5](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/07/15/london-mainnet-announcement/), we are now in the final stages of this process.\n\n### Shaping Positive Outcomes\n\nDespite recent progress, challenges remain for the maintainers of Ethereum Public Goods. The people who choose to work on them often have a very high opportunity cost and limited methods available to capture the upside from their work.\n\nEIP-1559 is a great example of this. It was an incredibly complex change, the largest done on Ethereum mainnet to date, which will improve both the user experience and economics of the entire network. And yet, the engineers, researchers, and other contributors will not directly capture any of the ultimate benefit to the network.\n\n### Presenting the 1559 NFT Series\n\nAs an experiment in providing cultural prestige & economic upside to EIP-1559 Contributors, we are issuing a limited series of **EIP-1559 NFTs**. This series was created by [@_kitteh](https://twitter.com/_kittehdesign), who has previously created artworks centered on Public Goods recognition. All proceeds from NFT minting are trustlessly forwarded to EIP-1559 contributors using a split contract. These include:\n\n- EIP authors (15%);\n- client teams who iterated on early versions of EIP-1559 to get the spec to where it is today (49%); [0]\n- researchers who analyzed the economic and technical impacts of the change (16%);\n- folks who helped manage the effort and communicate progress to the community (12%);\n- many others who helped extensively with testing to ensure the EIP was safe to deploy to mainnet (6%).\n\nThe remaining 2% of the allocation was given to @_kitteh for their work creating the actual NFTs\n\n### Artist Statement: _kitteh\n\n> I set out to visualize the collaborative process of developers and community as they shape Ethereum. \n>\n> These two groups, represented by the two differently coloured hands, have the same golden life force flowing through them. The hands slowly rotate around \"the Node,\" which represents the collective network. A mesh of silver strings bridge between hand and Node, visualizing the Ethereum change process.\n> \n> Since EIP-1559 is such a fundamental change to the core workings of Ethereum, I placed the numbers 1-5-5-9 exactly there - directly within the delicate etched metal Node. \n>\n> For the 1559 Patron NFT, I further emphasized the different dimensions in which the developers and community usually reside. Yet, the most amazing things are built by crossing the frame's threshold to the other realm, allowing you to see the situations at hand from another perspective. The semi-opaque liquid veil represents how difficult it can sometimes be for both sides to see the other's perspective. \n>\n> In the perpetually online world of blockchains, stewarding infrastructure is a fluid, never-ending process. A dance of creator and user. \n>\n> So we continue on, infinitely dancing across dimensions as we build a better Ethereum.\n___\n\nIf you would like to show support to the 1559 contributors even though the Supporter NFT is sold out, any ETH sent to this split contract will be automatically sent to them. **Note: the contract only supports ETH, tokens sent to it will be lost.**\n\n[EIP-1559 Contributor Set](split://0x2510C039cc3b061D79e564b38836dA87e31b342f?network=mainnet)\n\nFor those who want to go above and beyond in signaling their support, we are auctioning a premium one-of-one: the **1559 Patron Edition**.

{"id": "vzTYEWTlbH5bx5h3wWbTJm9rC9M6OUfEMpRX6nfLDmo", "title": "From Michelangelo to the metaverse: the past, present and future of art markets\n", "body": "NFTs have given art markets a breath of fresh air.\n\nAs we explore CryptoArt's next chapter, it’s important to understand what led us here.\n\nWe’ll start by exploring the history of art markets, their commission structures and the role galleries have historically played in their success.\n\nFrom there, we hope to educate readers on where SuperRare fits into the conversation, and how this positioning sets the platform up for its next chapter.\n\nWe’re going to cover hundreds of years of history in five minutes, so buckle in!\n\n### The Origin of Art Markets\n\nAs early as the middle ages, art made for the sake of worship or didactic purposes was commissioned by religious and political leaders. Throughout the Italian Renaissance this form of patronage continued with artists such as Leonardo da Vinci creating murals like the “Last Supper” and Michelangelo painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. \n\nAs time passed, art was no longer confined to the walls of churches or other interiors. A new type of trading activity began, which could be traced to Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) who, operating as an agent for himself, produced and sold works of art directly to his clients; forming what is arguably one of the key starting points for the primary market today.\n\nThis notion of collecting physical artworks and their changing hands amongst aficionados continued into the Dutch Golden Age where artists like Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669) was commissioned to paint portraits for families and nobility. Next, Paris-based entrepreneur and art impresario Paul Durand-Ruel (1831–1922) took things to the next level, redefining the role of the dealer and the art market once more. Durand-Ruel began the careers of many of the most famous Impressionist artists like Monet, Manet, Degas and Renoir, organizing solo exhibitions, offering stipends to support their careers and even showing their works in international outposts in New York and London.\n\nIn the new world, Leo Castelli (1907–1999) furthered the work of Durand-Ruel in an American context, creating the notion of artist representation and building a roster of artists who operated under his guidance. Museums began purchasing newly made art and Castelli was involved in these transactions. Meanwhile, towards the end of his career, auction houses, whose clientele was previously a niche subset of art dealers, began catering to an ascendant collector class who purchased works by well known artists who got their start through Castelli. A key example: the 1973 Sotheby’s sale of the taxi fleet owner Robert Scull’s paintings. As part of this sale, artists like Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol saw works previously sold by Castelli, resold at a premium. \n\nToday auction houses have their own private sales units and, more and more, are becoming one-stop ecommerce shops and, less so, auction houses in the traditional sense. Many of Castelli’s artists, artist estates and collectors were passed down to Larry Gagosian, one of the most powerful art dealers in the world today. \n\nOver the centuries, art has become commercialised, commodified and traded in many shapes and forms. What happens next is anyone’s guess. \n\n### The Evolution of Galleries\n\nBefore the internet, galleries controlled the marketing and financial rails for art. \n\nTraditional galleries market and disperse artworks, and arrange exhibitions that, until very recently, were confined to the physical domain. These brick-and-mortar institutions often bear the increasing costs of rent and marketing. This, in turn, inhibits what they can offer to collectors given certain works need to be sold at certain prices to maintain rent and overheads and these works often need to cater to certain geographic specificities and size constraints.  \n\nThat’s because in the physical art world, there’s a finite amount of gallery space for display; artists are reliant on galleries to establish a market for them. The premier and most financially endowed galleries have the most leverage and artists are often subjected to the standard gallery-artist commission structure, typically a 50-50 split between artist and gallery.\n\nWith CryptoArt, galleries can play a different role. In the metaverse there is infinite space for digital works to be displayed, so we don't need physical galleries to play the role of gatekeeper.\n\n### Limitations of Traditional Art Markets: Salvador Mundi\n\nSalvador Mundi is a painting by Leonardo da Vinci with a fraught and fiercely contested history, underscoring some of the more intriguing machinations of the art market. Its precise date of execution is disputed, alongside its provenance. Indeed, it was first sold for 2005 for $1,175 supposedly not as a real da Vinci, and then resold in 2017 as the real deal for $450,312,500 - the current record price for any work sold at auction. \n\nThis being said, the work’s authenticity has been questioned by numerous art historians including Frank Zöllner, the author of the catalogue raisonné on Da Vinci. Also, between 1666-1900 the work’s whereabouts were unknown. Not to mention, several other versions of the painting exist. It remains inconclusive whether the work was painted by the master and sadly its whereabouts today are also a mystery. Salvator Mundi exemplifies the opacity of the art world and the way in which works are sold. Clearly it’s time for a change. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea6efbcc-7b52-4335-b4d1-c137a1cd2f59.jpg?height=479&width=326)\n\n\n\n### Lessons from History: Foreshadowing the Boom of NFTs\n\nThe traditional art system, sooner or later, ends up subsuming the artistic movements that wish to escape it. For example, the early Impressionists were received with disdain from the press and yet redefined the state of Western art. In the 1960s, Andy Warhol openly proclaimed his affinity for commercial success and making money, looking to promote his art and brand to the widest audience possible. While the “making money is the best art” maxim was ridiculed at the time, this self-commercialisation of his work became an integral part of art history and pop art as a movement.\n\nToday the old guard regularly speaks pejoratively of crypto art, but, if history is any measure, this is a sure-fire signal that crypto artists are on the right path.\n\n### Enter SuperRare\n\nBuilt as a digital-first, 24/7 primary and secondary art market, SuperRare presents a new path forward.\n\nThanks to the advent of NFTs and standards like ERC-721, provenance and authenticity can be proven from now through the rest of history. Through systematic transparency, commissions, sales figures and lineage are inscribed forever on an immutable digital ledger. Further, through smart contracts, NFTs allow for programmable royalties on secondary sales. This is something SuperRare pioneered for artists since day 1 and more recently for collectors. \n\nThe digital nature of NFTs places less reliance on galleries due to a lack of need for physical displays - leading to an influx of global activity and bidding competition from collectors spread across different regions of the world.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, SuperRare charges the buyer 3% on top of the purchase price of any work. This comes in addition to a 15% primary sale commission, netting to 18% on the first sale of any artwork on the platform. In aggregate, this commission totals to less than half of what a traditional gallery charges, all of which is captured on-chain in an entirely automated system.\n\nThese commissions are currently routed to a wallet controlled by the company that created SuperRare. However, the notion of community ownership is one that we are taking seriously in the months to come.\n\nFor artists, a 10% royalty is earned on every subsequent sale of the work in the marketplace–forever. Looking at our earlier example of Salvador Mundi being purchased for $1,171 and later being resold for $450M, that’s a difference of $45M that could be programmatically paid to the original artist (or their estate) as part of the sale transaction.\n\nTaking that a step further, SuperRare’s newly launched [Collector Royalties](https://medium.com/superrare/the-art-royalty-revolution-6c0d13a6912a) also present incentives to those who collect and resell work - an opportunity that has historically been gated to private dealers and art markets through black box deals.\n\nThanks to these new systems, SuperRare is now home to more than 1,400 artists. In total, nearly $79M in works have been sold on the platform - both a staggering figure and an inspirational motivation when we look at the trillion-dollar legacy art market today.\n\n### What’s Next?\n\nWe are on the verge of creating the next generation of art markets.\n\nThese models create channels for artists to receive sufficient promotion, either independently or by working with partners of their choosing. \n\nThese creators are now responsible for promoting drops, creating buzz, running auctions and garnering large and successful sales, creating media rich meta-gallery content and helping to ensure authenticity.\n\nWhile it comes at the cost of more responsibility on the creator, it provides optionality. The galleries of the past will always exist in this world but, now, there is a choice.\n\nThe new model of digital artwork appreciation needs to have a system of reputable brands in place. But rather than containing works within the physical domain, these “galleries” can form digital networks that cross reference one another and function as part of a transparent ecosystem to bestow value and recognisability. \n\nThe blockchain serves as not only a methodology of improving transparency in transactions but also as an opportunity for artists to continually receive royalty payments from secondary sales.\n\nLooking 100 years into the future, it's easy to imagine a vibrant network of digital art markets routing billions of dollars in commissions to all affiliated parties in real-time. Best of all, the authenticity of these works can never be refuted and, as a result, neither will the novelty.\n\nFor SuperRare, we’re thankful to have played a small role in the creation of this next generation.\n\nWhile we’re proud of where we’ve come, the next chapter will even more deeply involve the community of artists, collectors and curators who have gotten us to where we are today.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we’ll be sharing more about the future of curation on SuperRare - and how you can become one of the names being written about 500 years into the future.\n\nUntil then, stay Rare!\n\n### Co-authored by:\n\n[Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa), Crypto strategy at Audius, DAOs at Friends with Benefits, SuperRare community contributor at 🔥 _ 🔥\n\nJustin Wasser, tech & crypto [strategist](https://www.justinwasser.com/), and advisor to SuperRare\n\nNico Epstein, Co-founder of [Artvisor](https://www.artvisor.com/), and lecturer at Christie's Education\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1627060750, "digest": "JylOdCwBH46hJsGw27pBrm_ki7B02RZyr-p__8jgDac", "contributor": "0x60E912290431D877489CDb74FA3C75A51575f57a"}

search bar.\n\nhttps://hash.pob.studio/\n\nOnce you do that, you will notice, that this already has been minted in Genesis S0 as mint number #73\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9788604f-0496-4826-a89f-b6a54097854d.png?height=784&width=490)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cd75a61d-7a33-41a1-83fc-05aeac371716.png?height=578&width=474)\n\nAs you can see on the mint information, the owner has described this as \"UNI creation tx\".\n\nSeeing a green \"Verified\" tick mark next to a mint, indicates that this mint has been verified by the Historian DAO that it represents whats is written in the description.\n\n### Searching further using explorers\n\nAnother approach for some unique mints, could be to look up other known projects in the NFT space.\n\nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club: BAYC Token has seen much interest, so let's dive a bit into that.\n\nFrom another POB mint we know this [txn](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x22199329b0aa1aa68902a78e3b32ca327c872fab166c7a2838273de6ad383eba) is the creation of the contract in that particular project\n\nIf you follow that link, you will get to the transaction details page on etherscan.io, see below image\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dd536fba-129b-4e33-9786-e392a3c50945.png?height=1784&width=1568)\n\nFirst you click the [txn contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d)\n\nThen click the tracker: [BoredApeYachtClub (BAYC)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d)\n\nYou're now presented with the Token page for the BoredApeYachtClub, for the example please go click [last](javascript:move('generic-tokentxns2?contractAddress=0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d&mode=&sid=225efbdec00bb63cfa89aa7bc8296cac&m=normal&p=1349'))\n\nDoing this you're viewing the first transactions.\n\nIt seems looking at the txn $HASH and method compared to the TokenID most right, that a lot of \"Apes\" has been reserved in the exact same txn.\n\nLet's go back a page, click [previous](javascript:move('generic-tokentxns2?contractAddress=0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d&mode=&sid=225efbdec00bb63cfa89aa7bc8296cac&m=normal&p=1348')) once\n\nYou should now be at the exact same page af the bottom of the above image.\n\nNow click the [txn](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8b119c0955a2e4402e6c11b820e84fa700b5e4d36b58e898ef8a4f0668a2f062) highlighted in the image\n\nDoing that, you should now see the same page as the image shows below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1f9d870f-12a3-4264-8716-b35841a53b20.png?height=752&width=1388)\n\nSo it seems that the txn 0x8b119c0955a2e4402e6c11b820e84fa700b5e4d36b58e898ef8a4f0668a2f062 was used for minting 2 Bored Ape Yacht Club Apes, with ID 31 and 32.\n\nUsing nftexp.io it's possible to look up Bored Apes Yacht Club by token ID.\n\nThose minted in the txn in the example look like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64519f1c-04c3-4456-ad36-157df8e64912.png?height=500&width=1070)\n\nNow go ahead and look up the txn at [ProofOfBeauty](https://hash2.pob.studio/art/0x8b119c0955a2e4402e6c11b820e84fa700b5e4d36b58e898ef8a4f0668a2f062)\n\nAt the time of writing this blog, this $HASH is not minted yet.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f489f6d5-6fd1-481b-a162-f6e2567d5915.png?height=1226&width=490)\n\n\n\n### How to search further\n\nOne of the first website tools i used to search for random unique txn was this [site](https://pob.kikoweb.ch/)\n\nIt seems the site isn't updated for displaying S1: SAGA previews, but none the less, it's still possible to use.\n\nIf you try to make a search with **start block: 430250**\n**Num Blocks: 100** and then hit scan, you will get the following result:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f5bd9ce9-266e-4248-a551-b64173829c9b.png?height=2390&width=1295)\n\nWhat you see displayed here is the number of transactions within the 100 blocks you wanted to search.\n\nTo hunt down unique and beautiful pieces, there is also a manuel process, you can take each txn and paste it onto the searhbar at ProofOfBeauty, to check how it looks visually and also get to know if it's already minted by someone else.\n\nA significant parameter is the number of leading zeros in the transaction $HASH\n\nIn S1: SAGA a $HASH without any leading zero's will have 2 circles, for each leading zero an extra circle are added.\n\nThe transaction with the most leading zero's as of today is this very nice [piece](https://hash.pob.studio/art/0x00000000bd1b55188f96ab2cedf07f563e2486b3b11548d50a49de4e5bdb0dcd), which have amazing 8 leading zero's, it was minted in S0: Genesis season as number 894.\n\nIf you dive deep into the above image, you will see this txn was also found using the website tool.\n\nA total of 33 transactions with 7 leading zero's has until now ever been recorded on the ethereum blockchain, all those except one was minted in the S0: Genesis season.\n\nThe S1: Saga mint with 7 leading zero's is viewable on ProofOfBeauty [here](https://hash.pob.studio/art/0x0000000a54f29044d7eadab9b7a683ec3fcebc42fc52eecd0ed455a09e97faae)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/80f34747-264b-496e-b17f-ae2c0177b2f5.png?height=783&width=489)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/82297bf3-81a1-4e65-926f-9b7bb2f09a21.png?height=618&width=468)\n\nActually there is a lot of parameters that generates how the ProofOfBeauty NFT's end up visually, you might want to dive a bit into that in this blog posted earlier this year, this digs into how the [SAGA](https://pob.mirror.xyz/Ep7nUgI52SGreSLE2-wVEEDZ8wF3wEOkaZDMURl__VU) algorithm works\n\n\n### Advanced search using SQL\n\nSearching for a specific number of leading zero's or other parameters, i would recommend using SQL, which is a bit more complicated\n\nTo search the ethereum blockchain i recommend using Google Cloud BigQuery, it's free of charge for the first 1TB of data per month you use.\n\nUse this [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=bigquery-public-data&page=dataset&d=ethereum_blockchain&p=bigquery-public-data&redirect_from_classic=true&ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1sbigquery-public-data!2sethereum_blockchain) to get to the project page inside Google Cloud BigQuery platform.\n\nStarting out on the platform you will need to navigate to \"crypto_ethereum\" as the dataset you will be searching.\n\nThe open up the tree structure by selecting \"transactions\", this will show you which exact variables that are searchable using the dataset.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6612ebad-df4b-4250-a6c0-842f3f818004.png?height=918&width=1314)\n\nIf you click details shown in the upper middle of the screen you will see the statistics of the dataset\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7fcf298b-be0a-44ec-a99a-9e941d2c7631.png?height=532&width=453)\n\nAs of writing this blog post, the data seems to be approx. 45 minutes behind actual time, but updated continuosly.\n\nUsing SQL to extract data requires some knowledge, i really can't get into teaching SQL in this blog post, but as an example i will show you how to search for the top 10 most used ERC-721 contracts as of 20. july 2021.\n\nUse the query below, and you will get a result like this: (i added tracker name)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b269821e-d840-4132-80a1-f59de9c014ce.png?height=648&width=1008)\n\nThe above contracts could be a starting point for finding unique txn within these projects.\n\n### Search for historic transactions\n\nFor some this task is just straightforward, but for many it may be hard, where to start. It's all about knowning the history of ethereum.\n\nA good start i would say could be to look at english wiki page for [ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum)\n\nWithin this page you will find this table:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c16f1743-7fa1-4260-a1b3-53dd44208a4b.png?height=374&width=355)\n\nAs you see on the above image, ethereum had some protocol upgrades at specific block numbers.\n\nI have highlighted the Berlin upgrade which was released 15. april 2021 at block number 12244000.\n\nNow please go look up that blocknumber in this [explorer](https://blockchair.com/ethereum/transactions?s=id(asc)&q=block_id(12244000)#f=hash,block_id,failed,time,sender,recipient,internal_value,index)\n\nViewing that page shows you the transactions in that block listed cronological, now go ahead and click on the first transaction [hash](https://blockchair.com/ethereum/transaction/0xac503dd98281d4d52c2043e297a6e684d175339a7ebf831605fe593f01ce82c3)\n\nThis transaction is the first txn in the block published as being the first block after the Berlin upgrade.\n\nYou might want to go look that transaction up on [ProofOfBeauty](https://hash.pob.studio/art/0xac503dd98281d4d52c2043e297a6e684d175339a7ebf831605fe593f01ce82c3) \n\nAfter you have connected your wallet, you could most probably see \"Mint now\". If you see exact text phrase, this transaction is still available to mint.\n\nIf you see \"Opensea\" mentioned instead, this transaction has already been minted by someone else.\n\n### Looking up historic NFT mints/sales\n\nThis is all about knowing your stuff about the NFT space, im still not too deep into that area, but as a part of the [Historians DAO](https://hash.pob.studio/historians) i have already stumpled upon some request to verify mints that represents transactions that includes minting of famous NFT art pieces and such.\n\nSo i guess google would be your best assistant here, dig into what is valuable for people into the NFT space.\n\nOnce you stumple upon a project, you need to dig into this a bit further. At first is this deployed on ethereum blockchain or some other, this is crucial to check.\n\nAs an example let's explore an NFT called \"Fade\" by Pak, look up this [page](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/natively-digital-a-curated-nft-sale-2/to-be-announced)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/79910d5e-1ab8-441d-b548-bd6212b5d090.png?height=924&width=1050)\n\nWe see that this NFT has the smart contract address: [0x62f5418d9edbc13b7e07a15e095d7228cd9386c5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x62f5418d9edbc13b7e07a15e095d7228cd9386c5)\n\nClick the address of the contract to look it up\n\nInvestigating the page we see the following information at tracker: Fade (FADE)\n\nAt the bottom of the page you will see the transaction mentioned as being used in the creation of the contract.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/84e63559-e59e-4af8-bf05-2fa5afb90b0f.png?height=556&width=1382)\n\nClick on [txn 0x9662000....](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x96620001c4bbeb3c32881e3cd011023d2fea5e87653a3f2856b562a16eab9489)\n\nDoing so, will take you to the transaction details, on this page you will see that this txn was used to mint Fade ERC-721 token with ID: 1\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b29bb0ae-8fa0-4971-97b1-956e2bed8cc0.png?height=502&width=1387)\n\nNow use the txn $HASH on [ProofOfBeauty](https://hash.pob.studio/art/0x96620001c4bbeb3c32881e3cd011023d2fea5e87653a3f2856b562a16eab9489)\n\nYou will see that this exact $HASH is already minted.\n\n\n\nThanks for taking your time to read this pretty long blog post.\n\nIf you're still not to clear about what to do to find some unique and maybe also beautiful NFT's to mint, you're more than welcome to peak around on this website i made for showcasing some of my $HASH finds for ProofOfBeauty.\n\nMost of the stuff on the website is free to take at whatever price you want, a few pieces have a set price.\n\nPlease note that buying anything from the [shop](www.pobnfts.com) only gives you the $HASH that you need to use for minting the NFT it self.", "timestamp": 1627063083, "digest": "WQAttPx_rDU2jCKwj66YHx_HMEpAWU2vXxR81PRiK0g", "contributor": "0xb99f063aaCbbE0602A41Be67B26648506ef45600"}

During my time here at Creator Cabins, I'm excited to complete Act II of my musical called RAPunzel, a coming of age, calypso rap musical following a young Black woman's journey to breaking her family's generational curses. \n\nThis musical will be about 90 minutes total, so around 90-100 pages. I already have about 50. I came with an outline, and I aim to write about 10-15 pages per week to stay on task. What I need to stay on top of that is accountability—which can be as simple as my cohort asking me for my pages each week.\n\nWhile I'm here, I'm also excited to learn more about making my art into an NFT for future investments. Special thanks to Jonathan, Matt, and CabinDAO for making this happen—all love!\n\n\n## Stef (@thxglif3)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ad2a045f-7f55-44e4-ac6f-4b91a79f8f9a.jpeg?height=400&width=400)\n\n### Background\n\nMy name is Estefania, I am an art consultant, art & zine dealer exploring the world of web3. In 2017 I [launched a magazine](http://soyyomag.com) in collaboration with friends & creatives in the NYC area. We sold out of every single magazine and continued to curate art shows and music events throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan.\n\n### Plans for the residency\n\nA Quarterly Zine focusing on  Culture, New Frontiers, DeFi & Tech. Each issue will be airdropped to token holders, which will be a collectible in form of an epic Magazine cover, that will grant you access to the full article online and a physical print that can be shipped to you (collector pays shipping & handling, zine pays for print).\n\nZine membership token for the community will provide liquidity for DAO, access to the zine, bounties, airdrops in art, eth, etc and community funds to sustainably operate a team of contributors & devs.\n\n### Roadmap:\n\n* Launch Discord, begin to assemble a team. Define roles, build out a general outline of what each zine will be formatted. (GOAL is to create the base structure by August 1st.) \n\n* Introduce a web2 blockchain university welcome center with resources to terminology, programs, communities, news, etc. Where people can subscribe and learn more about our releases via a newsletter. (I.e., landing page, white paper, and tools) This will be on SOYYOMAG.com Complete terminology page by 8/3\n\n* Release community tokens (either as a coin or avatar) with utility to allow navigation within the clubhouse area, curation input, and access to zine content. (GOAL release token by 9/16)\n\n* Marketing release of zine for 2.22.2022 as release date. create hype phase meanwhile contributors will be submitting work to editors and designers to add finishing touches to first zine (fungible and non fungible).\n\n* Token holders get zines airdropped. Clubhouse opens up to the public, community engages, continues to grow, and we do it all over again every 3 months. People can order physical zines.\n\n\n\n## [Andrei (@Poni18)](https://twitter.com/Poni184)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c51996e4-2b2c-4f8d-a7ce-fb95c2dce875.jpeg?height=400&width=400)\n\nI'm a designer/business owner currently designing for DeFi @ultimstudio. My project is building the Upwork of DAOs where anyone can post tasks and work remotely.\n\nThere are currently a lot of people and DAOs that are engaged in different types of on-demand work. Their main needs are that they wish to be paid in tokens and get a guarantee that they would be paid for their work. Job seekers and job posters would benefit from a platform where they would connect with each other, easily post jobs, and get paid for the work they perform in a decentralized way. \n\nThe main point of success for this project is understanding the current relationship between DAOs, individuals, and clients and design something that would solve their current needs. \n\n### Week 1\n\n- Problem Framing\n- Wireframing (UX)\n\n### Week 2\n\n- Designing the solution (UI)\n- Validating the solution with the user\n\n### How might we\n\n- Create a scalable design\n- Design in such a way that it will be easy to understand for all types of users\n- Focus on just one main use case\n- Have contractors signing up?\n- Have DAOs signing up? (rewards?)\n\n\n\n\n\n## [Rain (@raintheneo)](https://twitter.com/raintheneo)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6101516b-a29d-4700-a898-006b372a8a4a.jpeg?height=2731&width=4096)\n\n### [Background](https://twitter.com/raintheneo/status/1407766974860599299)\n\nMy name is Rain & I am an Artist with a Computer Engineering Background who just so happens to have a clothing brand as well. I'm 23 years old, a self-taught Artist/Graphic Designer, & have coding experience in c++ & some java/python.\n\n### Project Description\n\t\n*It Only Takes a Few Dances* is a multimedia project consisting of two main parts. These parts will be referred to as “ballets” to adhere to the theme of dancing and the art of transition through movement. The overall purpose for this project is to visually show growth, the idea of growth, and also to explore a new type of presentation by integrating blockchain technology tools. These tools and the method of how I use them will promote connectivity, encourage active interaction as the user explores the ballets, and also show how blockchain technology can be used by Artists in a physical and digital sense. I have written brief ideas about execution/integration below!\n\n\n### The project will have two parts:\n\n**Digital Ballet**\n\nThe first showing for this project will be digital. It will be announced through a series of interactive social media posts and will be housed officially on a website. The website will have three main portions:\n\n- Main Page\n- Gallery Page\n- Collect Page\n\nThe fourth portion will be an official ABOUT page that will feature a zine. Here, the history of the project will be briefly explained. Images, notes, and other forms of documentation will be used to create an experience for the viewer/visitor of how the art/project came to life. \n\n**Physical Ballet**\n\nThe second showing for this project will be physical at the non-profit gallery Utopia Feni. Here, the physical artworks that are highlighted on the Gallery Page of the website will be presented alongside merchandise & other physical art and NFT collectibles. \n\nThere will be a Music & Digital Art showing using a projector with the help of my friend Xavier Roberts. Xavier will be using a projector on a canvas or canvases of my work to bring it to “life” through animation.\n\n", "timestamp": 1627064749, "digest": "8vwZQ8AGkZa-Hv-7KOOsKtpoiVI7gc4JHvtiTI8Ss6U", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

Only 6 tokens were available for trading (ETH, WBTC, DAI, USDT, SNX, sUSD) versus 50 on Ethereum — so what drew in the 6k+ early adopters? Whereas gas fees for Uniswap v3 on Ethereum cost between $4.30 - $14.86 (.00196 - .00644 ETH) per swap over the past 30 days (daily median), gas fees on Optimism ranged between $0.47 - $0.97 (.00025 - .00050 ETH) — about a 14x savings on gas prices overall.

Unit supply is the number of tokens (“units”) circulating due to market demand. Unit supply has grown by 171% over the past 90 days led by the explosive launch and growth of the FLI product series in April-May and followed by MVI’s 33% unit supply growth in just the past 30 days.

Only 6 tokens were available for trading (ETH, WBTC, DAI, USDT, SNX, sUSD) versus 50 on Ethereum — so what drew in the 6k+ early adopters? Whereas gas fees for Uniswap v3 on Ethereum cost between $4.30 - $14.86 (.00196 - .00644 ETH) per swap over the past 30 days (daily median), gas fees on Optimism ranged between $0.47 - $0.97 (.00025 - .00050 ETH) — about a 14x savings on gas prices overall.

Its all-time high of $1.8M trading volume on July 21st dwarfed the $1.13B traded on Ethereum on the same day.

Unit supply is the number of tokens (“units”) circulating due to market demand. Unit supply has grown by 171% over the past 90 days led by the explosive launch and growth of the FLI product series in April-May and followed by MVI’s 33% unit supply growth in just the past 30 days.

This is a piece of history, it would be cool for the community to mobilize to own a piece of it.\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AbiWolcoff/status/1418652779778879490?s=20", "timestamp": 1627076222, "digest": "hfz6rdLrwiVziDdOnbg8U935YJpt6RytF20T1ufvAEQ", "contributor": "0xEB95ff72EAb9e8D8fdb545FE15587AcCF410b42E"}
