I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn‚Äôt meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you‚Äôd think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend‚Äôs living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn‚Äôt just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it‚Äôs not just a technology. It‚Äôs a philosophy. It‚Äôs a belief system. It‚Äôs a way of viewing the world. It‚Äôs about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you‚Äôre batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood. I remember the ‚Äúaha moment‚Äù when I wrote my first smart contract. With just a few lines of code and a private key, I was able to transfer an internet-native currency anywhere in the world in seconds. \n\nI didn‚Äôt have to sign up for Stripe. I didn‚Äôt have to use the Plaid API to connect a bank account. I didn‚Äôt have to check if TransferWise supported payments for a specific country. There was no centralized party. Just a peer-to-peer cryptonetwork called Ethereum. It was pretty damn mindblowing.\n\nAfter the first few weeks at Dharma, I was confident that DeFi and crypto were the future. But I also got the itch to work on some of my own ideas. I wanted to build software for creative people. Writers. Artists. Musicians. Online teachers. I strongly believe our world depends on these types of people having the tools they need to serve their communities as best they can.\n\nFrankly, I also thought it would take a couple years before the crypto industry had the infrastructure in place for a mainstream consumer app to be built.\n\n\nSo I ended up leaving Dharma to take some time off and explore a few startup ideas. But a couple months ago I read a [manifesto](https://cryptomedia.wtf/) by [Zora](https://zora.co/) that changed how I thought about crypto.\n\nIt described a world where crypto could be used to give any digital media file (eg an image, a song, an essay, digital art, etc.) property rights. It explained how cryptonetworks could turn digital media into liquid financial assets, secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts.\n\nAlthough the individual ideas weren‚Äôt new, they were combined and articulated in a way that just made sense. And not just to me.\n\n[Digital artists](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9), [athletes](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html), [social media influencers](https://cryptoslate.com/logan-paul-nfts-sell-3-5-million-worth-on-first-day-of-release/), [tech executives](https://scottbelsky.medium.com/the-furry-lisa-cryptoart-the-new-economy-of-digital-creativity-6cb2300ea081), [media executives](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI), and [journalists](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1366554892035219462) that never took the crypto weirdos seriously, seem to be taking notice.\n\nBut let‚Äôs be real. Is this latest NFT craze a bubble? Probz. Yet, is there at least a kernel of value in the idea of ownership over creative work? I think so.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell, there‚Äôs been a lot of talk about high transaction fees and lack of scalability in these systems. Although I do think these problems should and will get fixed, a lack of technical scalability is kinda the point.\n\nCryptonetworks trade off technical scalability for social scalability.\n\nFacebook is technically scalable because it‚Äôs a social network that processes millions of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is socially scalable because it‚Äôs a trillion dollar economic network without a centralized authority.\n\nCrypto isn‚Äôt just a technological revolution. It‚Äôs also a revolution in capital formation and human coordination. How creative projects are funded. How groups of people are incentivized. How organizations are structured.\n\nYears from now, when I‚Äôm old and senile, I believe we‚Äôll look back at this period as an [Internet Renaissance](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1343210395704541189) of sorts. \n\nA time where we dared to fight back against systems that have been designed for centuries to elevate certain groups and keep others disenfranchised.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe all this crypto stuff really is just an intellectual ideal that‚Äôll never work in practice. Regardless, I think it‚Äôs at least worth trying.", "timestamp": 1621091605, "digest": "pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}
{"id": "WA6m6ZuefhDJDIClULYc6zHMMX2RlPMIQt4b7E_5SlM", "title": "Tips for creators getting into crypto", "body": "One of the cool things about working at a startup is that you get to wear a lot hats.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/448266d8-eacf-41b7-9a4e-5f884ea1bf79.jpeg?height=1536&width=2048)\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the week is speaking with creators about how they can use crypto to build stronger communities.\n\nIn the future, I think crypto will be a core part of every creator‚Äôs business. Kinda like how tech products rely on AI to remain competitive today.\n\nBut we‚Äôre still really damn early. So, what is crypto actually good for, *right now?* In this post, we'll cover a framework I share with creators on how to think about the crypto landscape.\n\nBy the way, when I say \"creators\", I'm referring to ‚Äú[anyone doing non-commoditized work supported by digital platforms](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1350863079425376258)‚Äù. This includes writers, social media influencers, digital artists, musicians, podcasters, and online teachers, among others.\n\nAlright, now let's take a look at some tips for creators looking to experiment with crypto.\n\n## Tip #1: First, focus on creator market fit\n\nCreators are their own mini startups. They're responsible for focusing on a niche, understanding what customers want, creating something that people love, and finding sustainable ways to grow.\n\nIn startups, the concept ‚Äúproduct market fit‚Äù is widely regarded as [the key](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html) to sustainable growth. Product market fit creates a positive feedback loop between happy customers, new customers, and profits.\n\nThe equivalent to product market fit for creators is [creator market fit](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1376393732610785283).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/931d23e6-1795-41c4-baf5-20b4d17de8d9.jpeg?height=1108&width=1972)\n\nBefore focusing on growth, creators should prioritize finding creator market fit because it will serve as the foundation for a sustainable career. Once a creator gets to creator market fit, then it may make sense to start experimenting with crypto to accelerate grow.\n\nCrypto is a powerful tool for growth. Crypto is *NOT* a replacement for creator market fit.\n\n## Tip #2: Start off using crypto as a monetization tool\n\nOnce a creator feels like they have creator market fit, it's time to think about how they can use crypto to build a sustainable business.\n\nCrypto can help creators in four main areas:\n\n*   **Financing**: \"Help me raise money for projects.\"\n*   **Acquisition**: \"Help me get more community members.\"\n*   **Engagement:** \"Help my existing community members get more involved.\"\n*   **Monetization:** \"Help me make money.\"\n\nSo, as a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed creator ready to jump down the crypto rabbit hole, where do you start? Well, crypto isn't like signing up for a new SaaS product. Instead, crypto is more like building a mini economy.\n\nEconomies have currencies, laws, governance, goods and services, markets, citizens, etc.\n\nCrypto gives creators the tools to build their own economies with each of these components. But like any good startup, creators should smart small and iterate.\n\nOut of all the ways crypto can help creators, I think *focusing on crypto as a monetization tool is the best place to start* for a few reasons:\n\n*   **Focusing on monetization empowers creators to produce on-chain goods.** Goods and services are the core engine for productive economies because it creates resources to reinvest in growth. One issue I see with many creator tokens is that they launch a token but don't produce any on-chain goods. Most of their revenue is off-chain so that‚Äôs where their focus ends up.\n*   **On-chain goods convince community members to download a crypto wallet, buy ETH, and pay the creator on-chain.** Convincing community members to download a crypto wallet and buy ETH is one of the biggest barriers for creators experimenting with crypto. I think it's much easier to persuade your community to go through the mindfvck of learning crypto if they're able to buy a cool NFT at the end.\n*   **On-chain cash flow provides a solid foundation for other experiments.** As you sell more digital goods, you begin to accrue an on-chain treasury. This treasury can then be used to fund experiments like a decentralized investment fund, rewards programs for token holders, collaborations with other crypto-native creators, etc. These experiments then create a positive feedback loop which makes the treasury more valuable and provides more resources for future projects.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1376966491816476674)\n\nAdditionally, creators can view crypto-native monetization as just one part of their product portfolio.\n\nWeb2 is great at monetizing artificial scarcity through paywalls for stuff like content, courses, and communities. Web2 is also great at monetizing attention through ads. But as we‚Äôve seen, ad platforms heavily favor large creators and optimize for certain engagement metrics that aren‚Äôt always in the best interest of people consuming the content. Sponsorships are another option but they may require a large audience and a bunch of boring administrative work.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ec3efa3-9281-4312-b919-a295c1f22eaa\\_1440x1080.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ec3efa3-9281-4312-b919-a295c1f22eaa\\_1440x1080.jpeg)\n\nNFTs provide a new monetization channel for creators that complements existing channels. Instead of monetizing access or attention, NFTs monetize *ownership*.\n\nThrough math, computer science, and cryptography, digital goods that live on a blockchain can have a single owner. That‚Äôs basically what NFTs are. Digital goods that live on a blockchain and have an owner. The wider implication is that [NFTs make the internet ownable](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo). As a result, superfans are willing to buy NFTs from their favorite creators because for the first time in history, they can truly *own* a digital good. It‚Äôs like having a Nike shoe in your closet. As long as you buy it legally, Nike can‚Äôt bust down your door and take the shoe. It‚Äôs yours. Similarly, NFTs now provide a digitally-native form of property rights.\n\nAs scalability solutions reduce transaction fees and more infrastructure is built out, I believe NFTs will evolve to provide many other benefits beyond just ownership.\n\nEventually, creators will come up with crypto-native business models like [programmable subscriptions](https://medium.com/superfluid-blog/the-dawn-of-programmable-cashflows-2d50edae05cb), [prediction markets](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1309078385369460741?lang=en), [token reward programs](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641), investing in other creators, etc.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few ways creators can monetize with NFTs today.\n\n***1 of 1 NFTs***\n\nFor this model to work, you need just one true fan. But that leads to the main downside of this model. There‚Äôs only one owner. As a result, it's hard to create a community around these NFTs because only one person owns it. This model also prices out consumers who aren't willing to yolo their entire life savings on an NFT.\n\n***Limited supply NFT drops w/ collector rewards***\n\nThis model is still very underexplored. I think 3LAU is the [best example](https://nft.3lau.com/#/auction) of doing it right. With this model, you release a few NFTs and offer rewards to anybody that bids. This creates more of a community since multiple people can get involved while also retaining some scarcity. I think this model works best when releasing a large creative project like an album, a book, film, etc. because it can be made into an extravagant digital experience with a positive feedback loop between the value of the project and the NFTs.\n\n***Fractionalized NFTs***\n\nI think this will become the dominant model at some point. There are many variations but the general idea is to take one NFT and allow people to buy fungible tokens that represent the NFT. Token holders can speculate on the value of the NFT by trading their tokens or they can hold onto the NFT for access to exclusive rewards or just to flex. The main benefit is that this model enables many people to own a piece of your NFT. This can sow the seeds for a well-incentivized community. The design space here is pretty wide so I'm sure we'll see all sorts of experimentation in the coming months.\n\nWe're still in the early days but it's worth taking the time to experiment with different monetization models yourself to understand which is right for the type of community you want to build.\n\nOnce you've started generating on-chain cash flow through NFTs, the next step is community governance.\n\n## Increase community engagement and retention through decentralized governance\n\nDecentralized governance is another killer feature of cryptonetworks. Today, the relationship between creators and their communities is mostly one-way. The creator publishes content and their community consumes it. Maybe there are some chat groups but that‚Äòs about it.\n\nI believe cryptonetworks will usher in a new era of *co-creation*. Creators will involve their communities in key decisions like how to allocate funds, who to onboard, what types of projects they should work on, etc. This type of co-creation increases community and retention which can lead to stronger communities over the long-term.\n\nHere's a few ways creators can involve their community in key decisions today.\n\n***Community-driven capital allocation***\n\nOnce a creator starts generating on-chain revenue, they can redistribute funds with the help of their community. One option is to create an investment fund where community members earn tokens which they use to vote on which digital assets the fund should purchase. Digital assets could include NFTs, [NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/) moments, plots of land in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), or tokens for a DeFi protocol. One example of a decentralized investment fund is [FlamingoDAO](https://docs.flamingodao.xyz/). [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa), has a [great blog post](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/A16NP2XXi9RdHptfdF9WHR0Xq_E1XDmUgMwPmJYOG7w) explaining the potential of these decentralized investment funds.\n\nAnother option is to create a grant program where community members decide projects to fund based on their potential impact on the community. DeFi protocols like Uniswap, AAVE, and Compound all have community-driven grant programs for projects improving their core protocol.\n\nLastly, communities could also vote on what percentage of the treasury should go to community members. For example, $UNI holders get to vote on whether to turn on the 0.05% [protocol fee switch](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-flip-the-protocol-fee-switch-for-uniswap-dev-team-and-uni-holders/4777).\n\n***Democratically add new community members***\n\nOnboarding new members to a community usually goes one of two ways. On one hand, there's an opaque process where a few people decide who gets allowed in. On the other hand, it's an open access community which can lead to trolls and fvck up the vibez.\n\nWith decentralized governance, the community can self-regulate by collectively deciding who gets onboarded.\n\nFor example, at Mirror, we onboard ten new members each week using a community-driven process called [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race). Existing Mirror writers start with 1,000 votes and prospective members start with 10 votes. Everyone has two hours to cast their votes and the top ten people each week are airdropped a $WRITE token which they can burn to get access to Mirror.\n\nGranted, there's still a lot we could do to improve (eg give people a chance to write a short prompt on what they would use Mirror for, experiment with quadratic voting to disincentivize large votes for one person, give prospective members ways to earn more votes, turn the voting system into a prediction market to incentivize voting for people that add the most value to the Mirror protocol, create a DAO to set the voting parameters, etc.)\n\nRegardless, $WRITE Race has turned onboarding from a centralized / permissioned process to a community-driven process.\n\nAs more tools get built for decentralized governance, I think it will become the default way communities make decisions online.\n\n## Capitalize projects through crowdfunding\n\nCrowdfunding today is limited. You either need to live in a certain jurisdiction or be an accredited investor. I believe these limitations are good-natured and agree that we need guardrails to protect consumers from scam artists.\n\nYet, I also believe these limitations are preventing many talented people from gaining access to capital they could use to build something great. There needs to be some sort of middle ground. Here are a few reasons why I think creators should consider using crypto to finance creative projects.\n\n***Global and permissionless access***\n\nTo contribute to a crypto-native crowdfund, all you need is an Ethereum address. No jurisdictional requirements. No minimum net worth requirements. Just a computer, an internet connection, and a crypto wallet with some ETH or ERC20 tokens.\n\n***Programmable ownership***\n\nWith a crowdfund on Kickstarter or GoFundMe, you mostly just receive a warm fuzzy feeling that you contributed to something meaningful. Granted, that‚Äôs super important! Unfortunately, many people would rather spend their funds on other assets that generate some sort of return. Whether that be financial or pro-social.\n\nWith crowdfunds on Ethereum, instead of just receiving a warm fuzzy feeling or a bumper sticker, contributors can receive an ERC20 token. This token can then be programmed to include all sorts of benefits. These could include access to an online community, governance rights on how the funds should be allocated, royalties on the assets generated from the crowdfund, or maybe even a cool badge you can display in your crypto wallet or virtual merchandise you can wear in a video game.\n\nThe main takeaway is that cryptonetworks provide a new era of *programmable ownership* which can be used as a tool for better incentive alignment around capital formation.\n\n***Economic graphs***\n\nWeb 1.0 was about information links (web pages). Web 2.0 was about social links (likes, follows, shares). Web 3.0 is about economic links (tokens you earn, investments you make, assets you own). ([source](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1373809410485719045)) One of the coolest products that I think will emerge is a ‚Äúcrypto-native [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) for creators‚Äù. For example, if you go to [Instacart‚Äôs page on Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/instacart), you can see their total funding amount, the number of investors, who the investors are, how much they‚Äôve allocated, and a bunch of other information.\n\nWith crypto-native crowdfunding, we could see something similar emerge for any creative project. As the next generation of social products get built on crypto rails, I believe creators will use some sort of decentralized crowdfunding to finance their projects. If so, you could see the entire cap table for the next [Mr. Beast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA) or [Cardi B](https://www.instagram.com/iamcardib/) and build products around those economic graphs.\n\nYet, decentralized crowdfunding comes with risks since there‚Äôs no centralized party to regulate. To limit the risk of scams, I think we could develop something like an on-chain KYC process. To contribute to a crowdfund, you would need to submit your public key and be limited to contributing only a certain percentage of your net worth.\n\nTo raise funds, you would start off with a low funding cap (say $10k) and be required to build credibility within the system through certain metrics before being able to raise larger amounts.\n\nSo far, we‚Äôve covered how crypto can help creators with monetization, engagement, and financing. Now let's take a look at how crypto can help with acquiring new community members.\n\n## Drive acquisition through token rewards\n\nTo drive customer acquisition, DeFi protocols employ a tactic known as \"[liquidity mining](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641)\". This is just a fancy way of saying ‚Äúrewards program‚Äù. But, instead of providing cash incentives, protocols incentivize customers with their protocol token.\n\nFor creators, I prefer calling this a \"token rewards\" program since it's a bit more intuitive. Token rewards are so powerful that an entirely [new field of study](https://ce.mit.edu/) called cryptoeconomics was developed to understand it better.\n\nOne kinda scary definition of cryptoeconomics is: \"programming human behavior through the careful design of incentives.\" ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCFlGLbI_kE))\n\nThis is powerful stuff. In web2, we've seen what types of shitshows can happen online when incentives aren't crafted carefully. It‚Äôs important to educate ourselves on the mechanics of incentive design so we can consciously create new systems that reward positive sum behavior.\n\nHere's one framework that can help creators think through designing a token rewards program:\n\n1.  **Identify your community‚Äôs goal.** Is it to develop deeper social connections? Improve at a skill? Find a better job? Make money?\n2.  **Choose a reward mechanism.** In cryptonetworks, this is usually a programmable token.\n3.  **Choose a positive sum reward that benefits the network.** This can include votes in decentralized governance. Access to exclusive experiences. Or even financial rewards.\n\n*Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCFlGLbI_kE*\n\n(If you‚Äôd like to go deeper on this subject, check out [Token Engineering 101](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/library-te-101/)).\n\nCrypto gives us powerful tools for human coordination. Creators can use these tools to ensure their communities correct the mistakes that social networks made in the previous era of the web.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nCrypto is one of the most fascinating technologies in the world. Over the past decade, it has evolved from a cute little science experiment, to something that might actually be kinda important. Over the next decade, I strongly believe it will become an integral part of our lives.\n\nBut as a creator trying to make a living *today*, it's important to be practical.\n\nFirst, focus on getting to creator market fit. That will serve as the foundation for a sustainable career as a creator. Then, slowly start experimenting with all this crazy crypto stuff. At a high-level, crypto can help creators with financing, acquisition, engagement, and monetization.\n\nOn a tactical level, one option is to start by generating on-chain cash flows through NFTs. Creators can experiment with 1 of 1 NFTs, fractionalization, and limited release drops with tiered rewards. Another option is to create a system of community-driven governance to help improve engagement and retention. Creators can also try to crowdfund for a creative project and give contributors programmable ownership. Creators can even design a token rewards program for incentivizing positive sum behavior within their community.\n\nWhether you've been in crypto for a decade or just downloaded Metamask last week, we're all still trying to figure this stuff out. But that's what makes it so damn fun.\n", "timestamp": 1621091591, "digest": "WQQywdjjfnksMRPMaNKBMxPBqfE5k8nL6pCLe1roGyw", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

These poems are the product of that process.\n \nI have always been inspired by William Burroughs and Bryon Gysin‚Äôs ideas around how cutting up a text could generate visions of the future or flashes of a deeper truth. When a chaos element got introduced by slicing something up and rescrambling it, the deeper meaning of the words could show up on the surface of the new arrangement. This new layer of meaning could be poetic or divinatory. I've always been interested in divination, and especially since my job as \"trend forecaster\" is a kind of tacky contempo version of divination, it's interesting to me to mix the various spheres where divination goes down: astrology, tarot, cut-ups, data dives, pattern recognition, etc. Introducing randomness in poetic composition has been a persistent theme since Tristan Tzara and Dada, through the Surrealists, hypertext poets and beyond. \n \nOver the summer of 2020, my friend K Allado-Macdowell got their hands on a pilot version of GPT-3, the language model. (Eventually they helped [my project Nemesis write our DOOM! trend report](https://nemesis.global/memos/the-doom-report) using it.) While K started writing an amazing book using GPT-3 at warp speed ([Pharmako-AI, now published by Ignota, here](https://ignota.org/products/pharmako-ai)) they meanwhile indulged me by running fragments of my own poetry and existing poems by writers I loved through the machine, generating text for me to play with. It was all rather astounding and addictive and I looked for a way to work with it directly, since the real thing was only for researchers at the time. \n \nLuckily, that‚Äôs when I found out that a game called AI Dungeon, which is a browser-based text roleplaying game, supposedly used GPT-3 as the basis for its premium version, and you could use it to generate texts if you paid the $9/month. So I started making poems using AI dungeon, dodging its role-player-ish verbiage most of the time and trying to get it to present some far-out truths, which it did.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ad9d3716-e893-42e6-9bb7-a0bbf3f5bc11.png?height=1590&width=1588)\n\nOne of my early experiments became the basis for the first poem here, CODE OF HOLES, when the game started describing light as a \"code of holes\" which I found rather dharmic and spooky and appealing. I then took the text generated by interacting with the AI dungeon game and did a Burroughs-style cut-up to it, then edited it into something pithier. Instead of presenting it on a page in the normal way, I justified it in a square and used black emoji as a form of punctuation, since I think it emphasizes the code/hole content motif. The font I used is a nasty free dafont called hole-hearted, another echo of the theme. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e7012e9d-bd18-4d72-bbfd-b14768c9ff49.png?height=1592&width=1596)\n\n\nThe second poem, PLASTIC BEACH, is about having sex with Kylie Jenner. I dreamt I had sex with her in a beach vacation setting surrounded by family, and it included an obscene squirting element. When I woke up I wrote out the dream in order of its events to turn it into a poem but it was too linear, just sounded like badly written erotica. So I ran that text through [an algorithm that mimics Bourroughs-style cutups](http://www.languageisavirus.com/cutupmachine.php) and suddenly it was turned back into a dream, like the cutting and scrambling allowed the dream logic came to the surface again. Bonsai-tree-style pruning and editing followed. There's an influence of the poet Bernadette Mayer here too who worked a lot with dreams and dream logic in her work. You can check out more of Mayer‚Äôs writing prompts [here](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/library/Mayer-Bernadette_Experiments.html).\n \nThe font used in the second Folia work is another dafont called PLASTIC BEACH (also the title of the piece) and the background is a photo I took of the sky while tripping on acid on Laguna Beach on the last hot day of summer.\n \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f852bb61-78d7-407a-a007-e13011cf2f37.png?height=1590&width=1580)\n\nThe third piece, THE FUTURIST, came out of my original experimentation with GPT-3 via K. I had asked if GPT-3 could write poetry, and they said yes, but epic poetry, because it did better with longer text samples. Inspired by this, I sent over the first few pages of [The Descent of Alette by Alice Notley](https://poets.org/poem/descent-alette-i-walked), a feminist epic poem and one of my all time favorite books. The Descent of Alette begins in a world where everyone is trapped underground on an infinite subway system. In the world of the book, the ‚Äútyrant‚Äù stands in for a male supervillain responsible for the suppression of authentic life, and the consciousness of the poem begins to tangle with him. The poem uses a very particular quotation style in which each phrase is bracketed by its own quotation marks ‚Äì GPT-3 aped this perfectly on the first try, which was eerie, since it‚Äôs so unusual. THE FUTURIST is like a riff on one of the tyrant‚Äôs moments from the original book, but made kind of fluffier and more treacle-y...a supervillain gone soft in the machine. I edited the original GPT-3 sample considerably and replaced the quotation marks with smiley dingbats (thematically linked to the poem‚Äôs smile at the end) and hearts. The font is Futura, obviously! I feel the overall effect is like deep fried Joe Boxer.\n\n \n## MANY THANKS TO...\n\nThe Folia crew ‚Äì Dan Denorch, Everett Williams, Billy Rennekamp.

These three NFT works are generative poems I created with new digital language models and algorithms, plus my own poetic composition. The proceeds from this Folia auction will be completely redistributed to queer, trans, experimental and undersupported writers as the first action of the Deluge Books DAO. [Deluge Books](https://delugebooks.com/) is the mass experimental queer literary press I run with collaborators in New York and Los Angeles (try to say that five times fast). Ever since I [crowdfunded my new book BURN ALPHA as $NOVEL](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) we have been excited about the possibilities of crypto, Mirror, and NFTs for generating new methods for sustaining original literary work. You can read a little more about my thoughts on that in [my interview in Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/68981/emily-segal-novel-crowdfund). Down the road, we are pumped about the possibility of crowdfunding for the Deluge DAO on Mirror and our own social token :) Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter at @khole_emily or at emily@delugebooks.com if you have thoughts or suggestions about that!\n\n\n\n\n\n## MORE ABOUT THESE POETRY NFTs...\n \nLast summer I started making an experimental series of language works that used AI, cut-ups and word generators as a form of divination. These poems are the product of that process.\n \nI have always been inspired by William Burroughs and Bryon Gysin‚Äôs ideas around how cutting up a text could generate visions of the future or flashes of a deeper truth. When a chaos element got introduced by slicing something up and rescrambling it, the deeper meaning of the words could show up on the surface of the new arrangement. This new layer of meaning could be poetic or divinatory. I've always been interested in divination, and especially since my job as \"trend forecaster\" is a kind of tacky contempo version of divination, it's interesting to me to mix the various spheres where divination goes down: astrology, tarot, cut-ups, data dives, pattern recognition, etc. Introducing randomness in poetic composition has been a persistent theme since Tristan Tzara and Dada, through the Surrealists, hypertext poets and beyond. \n \nOver the summer of 2020, my friend K Allado-Macdowell got their hands on a pilot version of GPT-3, the language model. (Eventually they helped [my project Nemesis write our DOOM! trend report](https://nemesis.global/memos/the-doom-report) using it.) While K started writing an amazing book using GPT-3 at warp speed ([Pharmako-AI, now published by Ignota, here](https://ignota.org/products/pharmako-ai)) they meanwhile indulged me by running fragments of my own poetry and existing poems by writers I loved through the machine, generating text for me to play with. It was all rather astounding and addictive and I looked for a way to work with it directly, since the real thing was only for researchers at the time. \n \nLuckily, that‚Äôs when I found out that a game called AI Dungeon, which is a browser-based text roleplaying game, supposedly used GPT-3 as the basis for its premium version, and you could use it to generate texts if you paid the $9/month. So I started making poems using AI dungeon, dodging its role-player-ish verbiage most of the time and trying to get it to present some far-out truths, which it did.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ad9d3716-e893-42e6-9bb7-a0bbf3f5bc11.png?height=1590&width=1588)\n\nOne of my early experiments became the basis for the first poem here, CODE OF HOLES, when the game started describing light as a \"code of holes\" which I found rather dharmic and spooky and appealing. I then took the text generated by interacting with the AI dungeon game and did a Burroughs-style cut-up to it, then edited it into something pithier. Instead of presenting it on a page in the normal way, I justified it in a square and used black emoji as a form of punctuation, since I think it emphasizes the code/hole content motif. The font I used is a nasty free dafont called hole-hearted, another echo of the theme. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e7012e9d-bd18-4d72-bbfd-b14768c9ff49.png?height=1592&width=1596)\n\n\nThe second poem, PLASTIC BEACH, is about having sex with Kylie Jenner. I dreamt I had sex with her in a beach vacation setting surrounded by family, and it included an obscene squirting element. When I woke up I wrote out the dream in order of its events to turn it into a poem but it was too linear, just sounded like badly written erotica. So I ran that text through [an algorithm that mimics Bourroughs-style cutups](http://www.languageisavirus.com/cutupmachine.php) and suddenly it was turned back into a dream, like the cutting and scrambling allowed the dream logic came to the surface again. Bonsai-tree-style pruning and editing followed. There's an influence of the poet Bernadette Mayer here too who worked a lot with dreams and dream logic in her work.

To me, that was the gesture of reclamation. But even to this day, people kind of know Grandmaster Flash, but nobody knows Kool Herc, right? But everyone knows Eminem. Again, all props to Eminem, but this is why [Blockchain tech, social tokens, NFTs are] interesting to me: **The provenance of creation, and particularly as it resonates with the actual creators.** Not the rent-seekers, not the people who just steal the ideas.‚Äù*\n\n\nThe provenance of creation. Tracking value to and from the source transparently. Or what I like to call, ‚ÄúCreative Immortality‚Äù. With the advent of decentralized applications, **we have the opportunity to build a framework of perpetual wealth redistribution through attribution, patronage, community to build and sustain our cultural capital.** \n\nAs a participant in this space, my goal is to activate and engage Black Culture in crypto to document and record our past, and build our future simultaneously. In order to achieve creative immortality, we need to be able to reconcile with the things we‚Äôve already made. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it has to be an NFT, but it does mean that we should have all of our references available and easily accessible. I am reminded of institutions like our HBCUs that are constantly fighting for resources to preserve and teach our history. Or institutions like Yale or the MOMA who have profited from us without retribution. \n\nHow much of our work has been purchased over the years that have never seen the light of day? That has never been exhibited before, that hasn‚Äôt been intellectualized, that doesn't have the type of attention or appeal that centralized institutions are looking for. What if the artists of our past could have flourished had we seen ourselves in those galleries, publicly supported, and paid equitably?\n\nCrypto can enable that level of patronage at scale if we anchor ourselves to act inclusively. \n\n\n---\n\n### ‚ÄúKilling fields need blood to graze the cash cow/ It's a number game, but shit don't add up somehow/ Like I got, sixteen to thirty-two bars to rock it/ But only 15% of profits, ever see my pockets like‚Äî‚Äù \n*[Mos Def, Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ir-zFC9nFE)*\n\n\nLet's face it: Out of the $MM that have touched the hands of NFT artists, cultural communities can count on their fingers the number of artists that have seen any significant portion of that. Micah Johnson's first Aku drop on Nifty Gateway, and the DAO Clash to acquire the work of Ix_Shells x TOR collaboration are the ONLY examples of black artists in the space (notwithstanding celebrities) that have had their works sold for over $1mm. \n\nThat's two fingers. The other 8? \n\n- (50 ETH)* $77.7k high for Carlos Marcial;\n- (22 ETH) $55k high for Cory Van Lew; \n- (11 ETH) $44k high for Osinachi;\n- (10 ETH) $28k high for DIGITAL + Mighty33; \n- (4 ETH) $16.4k high for Yatreda;\n- (9.7 ETH) $16.1k high for Blacksneakers; \n- (4 ETH) $11.6k high for Yosnier;\n- (2.68 ETH) $11.1k high for Latasha (collab);\n\n\nNow if we take these 10 artists out of the equation, for black artists, **our average HIGH ETH sale is roughly 1.79 ETH.**** \n\nThat sucks. \n\nEven if these artists manage to hodl their assets for as long as they can, as the cost of ETH rises, their holdings do not rise at the same rate making it increasingly harder for us to participate in other projects. Perhaps this speaks to a larger issue about ETH becoming more of a store of value than a token to be exchanged‚Äîbut ultimately, the disparity of asset accrual is not foreign to the black experience. While we have this \"early access\" to crypto, we must work toward broader redistribution of assets to prevent the same issues that plague us: income disparity, low wealth accrual, lack of access to funding, etc.\n\n>> Mention MintFund + other grants\n>> Mention SyndicateDAO + DAO groups \n\n---\n\n### Archivism: Defining Ethical Digital Archeology + Cultural Preservation\n\nWe are at an inflection point in the digital art age where the same mistakes in traditional institutions are being made in cryptospaces:\n\n**Cultural erasure. **\n\nThere‚Äôs this push and pull between folks who are really about the provenance of the blockchain versus folks who are wanting to predispose themselves first because they have more visibility.\n\nBlack artists like Connie Digital, Harrison First, and others were some of the first people to institute social tokens and mint albums, songs, and EPs as NFTs for their fans on the blockchain. Unfortunately, after the release of 3LAU's album, media articles were declaring he‚Äôs the first to sell an album. And without pause, had said the same for Kings of Leon (which they've since corrected to 'first band' but how accurate is that really?) which is not true. At all. But what has continued to contribute to erasing us has been the attention around that sale, becoming the formative marker as being first because it‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs made the most noise (and most $$$). I find it interesting because the blockchain doesn't lie‚Äîwe can literally go back tangibly, and there‚Äôs verifiable hash proof that none of those works are first.\n\nFrustratingly, it's also hard to go back further than 2017 because the NFT standard contract ERC-721 wasn't invented prior to the launch of CryptoPunks. So unless you have already documented this work (largely being part of the scene pre-ICOs), you wouldn't even know what to look for. \n\nRelated to this, the convo with @boop  (reference MoonCats)\n\nWe need to instill ethics in our works, projects, and practices. We must respect those who have paved the way for us. We have to actively practice attribution. Several articles I've read recently have deepened my motives around defining the practice of preserving context from archival works:\n\nCryptarchivism (or Crypto-Archivism)\nCryptarch (or Crypto-Archivist)\n\nCryptarchivism - The art of practice of maintaining, discovering, and accessing archives of crypto assets with long-term value.\n\nCryptarch - A practitioner of cryptarchivism.\n\nI think it's at least a first attempt at an ethical practice of handling crypto archives.\n\nI‚Äôm not necessarily a historian, but I think the more and more I get involved in this space, the more and more I feel that pressing role of being an archivist. So that culturally, we aren‚Äôt erased, even in a space that‚Äôs supposed to be decentralized and supposed to be something that works for everyone.\n\n>> Propose DAO for preservation\n\n---\n\nInclusion. Diversity. Equity. Buzzwords when spoken through hollow action. Powerful instruments of change when cultivated in the right hands. But let's be honest with ourselves‚Äîthis shit is hard fucking work. Many don't want to talk about it. Many don't believe there's a problem. And many of us don't want to do shit about it. The fact remains, cultural work is undervalued. \n\nThe crypto-creative space does not have an ecosystem (yet) for curators to market signal dope creatives that are minting really great works, collectors are largely unaware of works made that don't already have big followings, AND artists lack the tools they need to increase their exposure. \n\nCulture flourishes when its creators and participants are equally given agency within their respective roles. If collectors empower creators of culture, the larger global communities that engage with the culture benefit greatly. \n\nBy changing the state of play, we positively impact creativity, give larger agency for cultural communities to make their best works, leave rich histories for those who come after us, and build toward a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable world.\n\n**Examples of Success + Patronage of toward Black creatives**\n\n- The Micah Johnson ‚ÄúAku‚Äù drop on Nifty Gateway has created more than $2.6M in primary and secondary sales from the Black community buy-in. \n- xx1/Off (the largest holder/patron of black works) has spent more than 69ETH on black artists.\n- MintFund is currently supporting 650+ BIPOC and Queer artists to mint freely on the Ethereum blockchain.  \n\n### High-value collectors can help accelerate and increase long-term value for these communities.\n\n>> Mention The Well, $HEAT\n\nAs early adopters, we have a responsibility toward creating a fair, safe, inclusive, and equitable environment for all creatives. This isn't done by simply hiring more of us in your companies especially if they aren't already diverse from its inception. The culture is already built‚Äîyou can't hire out of it unless those folks are granted enough power and influence to do so. Real change starts from the community level. You have to be in it and of it especially if you are an ally (or want to be; we don't just hand these out). The goal is to make sure any cultural community can build their communities as they see fit. As builders, leaders, analysts, engineers, influencers, we HAVE to co-create tools to enable agency. **Don't build for us, build with us.**\n\n>> Mention Open Source Tools \n>> Mention $BOUNTY + PartyDAO (groups toward public goods)\n\nAs we set precedents for outsiders to respect the space, artists, creators, and curators, we must center them for the generations of cultural stewards that succeed us. I‚Äôm challenging all of us to start thinking about intentionality and being actively present in this moment. **Because when it‚Äôs gone, it‚Äôs gone.**\n\n\n---\nAppendix:\n\n**Accounting for the trading value of ETH at time of sale, not adjusted for current value.*\n\n** *This study is based on the sales collected from a pool of 40 black artists. The sales account for the highest historic USD value/ETH sale. There is a correlation of higher ETH = higher USD despite some outliers.

I didn't immediately think to make them into NFTs. It wasn't until I had gone through the motions on Zora that the audio looped over and over that it clicked. This was the perfect experiment in documenting, sharing, and collecting memories.\n\nWhat could I reveal to the listener? Could they learn about me? And because we had all been deprived of events, could these moments hold a deeper meaning to the fleeting nature of socialization? Did we take for granted the ever innocuous social gathering?

The first of three notes in this trilogy called ***[\"Shƒ´kurettopƒÅtƒ´: One Night In Kurosakimachi\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/178)***, it's very serendipitous that my phone picked up both a conversation I'm having about crate-digging at one of the only remaining Tower Record stores in the world AND some amazing house music.

I've been watching the project since 2019 and thought would be a great infrastructure for smart contracts in general. This time, I had a chance to interview with the team. This was translated in Japanese and posted in my weekly newsletter [Bspeak!](https://bspeak.substack.com/). Anyway, enjoy the interview.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5bf2da5f-33e9-4bac-a7a6-990e861ac28c.jpeg?height=560&width=990)\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n\n***CoffeeTimes: Hello Gelato teamüç¶! Can you tell us what Gelato Network is in a nutshell?***\n\nGelato: [Gelato Network](https://www.gelato.network/) is an open marketplace to match developers‚Äô demand for transaction automation with the supply of a decentralized network of bots. It empowers developers to build automated dapps and allows bot operators to earn revenue from running the infrastructure necessary for such automations. Further important members of Gelato‚Äôs ecosystem and community include the team that develops and distributes much of the technology needed for the marketplace. \n\nSoon, after Gelato‚Äôs native token - $GEL - will have been released, its holders will also play a crucial part in governing the network and shaping its success and path into the future.\n\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: What made you start this project?***\nGelato: We started the project back in May 2019 after we received a grant from Gnosis Ecosystem Fund (GECO). \n\nref: [https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-ecosystem-fund-update-ii-9bea803a97c8](https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-ecosystem-fund-update-ii-9bea803a97c8?gi=84e40da1e1c9)\n\nInitially, we worked on automating certain aspects of Gnosis‚Äôs DutchX exchange back then. However, we quickly realized that the need for automating dapps is ubiquitous. Web2 users are completely accustomed to an automated User Experience thanks to centralized servers controlling a lot of your data. In Ethereum, and decentralized blockchains in general, this great user experience is very hard to replicate because here we explicitly do not want users to trade in custody over their data and funds to a centralized server for a better UX. This would sacrifice most of the benefits of the decentralized web. So in the summer of 2019 we set out to build a solution for developers and users alike that allows for a decentralized application layer with a slick automated user experience, without the need for users to give away control over their keys and funds - Gelato Network was born. \n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/be0267e3-a57a-443e-a218-f7ad87d99454.jpeg?height=874&width=1310)\nLuis and Hilmar, 2021\n\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: What is Sorbet Finance? Is it like a side project on top of Gelato?***\n\nGelato: Yes, [Sorbet Finance](https://www.sorbet.finance/) is its own project that makes use of the Gelato Network in its backend. In Sorbet‚Äôs case it uses the Gelato network to continually monitor prices on DEX and then execute a users‚Äô limit orders once their specified desired price target is reached. All that is achieved while the users keep full control over their funds. Also Sorbet now features Dollar Cost Averaging, which allows users to automatically sell a portion of a token spread out in several chunks and time intervals, to decrease the slippage per trade. Cool features like Sorbet that use Gelato Network to automate some aspect of a dapp can be built by any developer. \n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: You have announced several collaborations. Can we expect any other collaborations in the close future?***\n\nGelato: Yes, for sure. We are in close talks with many of the famous and not-yet-famous projects out there on Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, and whatnot. Almost every DeFi developer needs automation and we‚Äôre here to help them get it. \n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: You recently have announced GEL tokens. What is the purpose of GEL tokens? If Executors bot act maliciously, it would lead to a crucial problem (front running or just harming dapp users). Does GEL token slashing prevent it enough?***\n\nGelato: $GEL tokens will be used to 1) incentivise, govern, and police network participants and 2) allocate network resources efficiently. \n\nBots who want to earn a revenue from providing their infrastructure services to the Gelato network will have to stake a lot of $GEL tokens to attain and retain this privilege. This will open the door for more complex use cases to be built on top of Gelato, which might require an element of trust into the bots that will execute their automations. For such use cases having the bots put up a bonded stake, which can be slashed if they act maliciously, is essential. However, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that there are also many use cases which can be implemented so that they are trustless by default and thus do not have to rely on such a staking and slashing mechanism. Furthermore, the $GEL token will also be used to positively incentivize all network participants, developers, bots, and users alike that bring traffic to the network. \n\nOne other major use of $GEL is to efficiently allocate network infrastructure resources to dapps and users that demand them. Ethereum and other chains usually are constrained resource environments. There are only so many transactions that can fit into a block. Therefore, in order to scale a decentralized network like Gelato, decisions regarding the timing priority of transactions will have to be made by dapp developers and ultimately the bots that send them to the network. To gain priority in this technological resource allocation mechanism, developers and end users will have the ability to also lock up $GEL to assign different weights to their transactions. As a result, bots are incentivized to allocate more resources to such staked dapps or users, who, like them, are also long $GEL via their boned stakes.\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: About token distribution, how would you plan on it?***\nGelato: At the moment we cannot share details with the public yet other than that we plan to do a public sale for $GEL tokens early this summer. Stay tuned, we will announce more details soon on our Medium and Twitter accounts.\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: Okay further question about GEL, allocation/tokenomics are already fixed?***\n\nGelato: We will announce more details about token allocation and tokenomics in an upcoming article. Right now this information is not yet public. \n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: How would the GelatoDAO become sustainable? I assume the protocol would take a fee based on transactions but can you elaborate the model?***\n\nGelato: The GelatoDAO will be governed by people that have a vested interest in governing and maintaining the Gelato Network. For example, dapp developers that make extensive use of Gelato for their automation needs are strongly incentivized to participate in important decision-making around things like what features should be prioritised by Gelato‚Äôs core team in upcoming releases, what fees bots can charge, and whether certain bots should be slashed and kicked from the network, if they misbehave. Therefore, there is an organic tendency for many network participants to participate in the DAO to steadily improve the welfare of the network purely out of rational self-interest. In the future, the DAO could also retain a small network fee, but since its membership will likely largely consist of network participants the ultimate fee payers will have significant control over this decision themselves.\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: Gelato seems to have a great connection with Gnosis and other DAOs (TheLAO / MetaCartel Ventures), how did you start and deepen these relationships with them?***\n\nGelato: We partnered with MetaCartel early on in late 2019 when we applied for a grant from them and made it into their 3rd cohort.\n\nref: [https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-cohort-1-6336cdca05db](https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-cohort-1-6336cdca05db)\n\nEven though Peter Pan sat next to us in Berlin‚Äôs crypto co-working space Full Node from the start, we eventually really got to know him online. He was super helpful and interested in Gelato and really also helped us with closing our Seed Funding in late summer 2020. The LAO was also part of our Seed Round and we are in frequent contact with both members of the LAO, like Aaron and Pri, and members of MetaCartel, like Peter and Victor. They usually help us greatly with legal, strategic, or community-related questions. Being active in DAOs and just talking to their members is definitely a good thing every crypto entrepreneur should.\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: Please tell us briefly about your future plans in the coming few months!***\n\nGelato: Uh boi, there is a lot to unpack here but let us be crisp. For this summer the plan is to: \n- ship, ship, ship: new automated features on Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, and Fantom. We want Sorbet‚Äôs limit orders to be on every AMM and we want more and more protocols to integrate Gelato for liquidation protection and automated transfers, withdraws, deposits and so on. \n- launch $GEL \n- launch the Gelato DAO and start involving $GEL holders in decision-making around which features to prioritise \n- Developer mining programs with $GEL to get more developers to build on Gelato \n\nDefinitely join our Telegram or Discord communities to stay up to date. I am sure there will be feature releases for you or as a developer you have the opportunity to participate in our developer mining program, which we will launch after the $GEL token sale. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5e66c1b3-7d34-441b-ae17-7c7cb98e5f3d.jpeg?height=594&width=623)\n\n\nRoadmapÔºö[WhitePaper v1.0](https://aristaticfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/Gelato+Whitepaper+V1.0,+May+2021+(02).pdf)\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: Can you give any words to the Japanese audience? Do you have any impressions on Japanese crypto scene? I think I saw a photo somewhere of when the team came to Tokyo***\n\nGelato: Gelato had a strong Japanese community right from the start. We are super thankful for that and we definitely want to connect more with them. If any Japanese developers want to automate smart contracts, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out. Unfortunately, we have not been to Tokyo yet. However, after COVID settles down we will definitely go. \n\nOur team is very multinational, we have members from Switzerland, US, Germany, France, China, Australia, and Egypt.

I come to understand economic theory and camp sensibility more holistically by examining their interaction. I seek to understand not only how economics can be understood as camp, but to understand what it means for something to be camp and how camp sensibility can be useful.\n\nI begin with a theory of camp: camp sensibility is ill-defined by language alone and relies on a primarily working (rather than definitional) knowledge of queer sociability and its humors. It is a sensibility and an aesthetic that is frivolously audacious and necessarily impertinent: it's a regurgitation of banalities that are performed with such exaggeration that they find value not in their content but in their drama. \n\nCamp behavior often reformulates mundanity and presents it as remarkable‚Äîit hyperbolizes the status quo until it seems subversive, innovative, or revolutionary. The camp aesthetic operates within a tension between the familiar and the alien: it renders unusual behaviors and methodologies navigable by applying them to familiar and accessible plots or concepts. In short, it takes something that seems natural and presents it in its most fabricated and unnatural form. To do something campy involves misunderstanding and overestimating the importance and seriousness of what you're doing.\n\nEconomics aims to focuses on human behavior and its repercussions as defined by economic assumptions. That is, it takes something that's intimately familiar‚Äîhuman behavior‚Äîand communicates it in a reduced form, focusing on and exaggerating certain tendencies such as self-interest. In true camp fashion, oversimplification actually leads to obfuscation and misunderstanding: the basis for the campiness of economic theory is its ignorance of nuance and its mathematically ostentatious presentation.\n\nAll it takes is a quick perusal of an introductory economics textbook or a few clicks on the Wikipedia page on microeconomics to understand the ostentatiousness of economic theory. In order to understand how mathematical representation in economics is camp, let's examine a simple and foundational concept in economics: preference theory. Take a look at this excerpt from [*Introduction to Choice Theory* by Levin and Milgrom:](https://web.stanford.edu/~jdlevin/Econ%20202/Choice%20Theory.pdf)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/494f9b24-25aa-4818-961c-84c6d85340f7.png?height=998&width=1166)\n\nThe general concept being communicated by this proof is rather simple: if someone is evaluating a set of goods and is able to rank them all and then makes all good-selecting choices in accordance with their ranking, then their decision-making process can never be arbitrary. This is painfully obvious when stated in plain language, but hard for the average person to understand when stated as a mathematical proof. The issue at hand is not whether the proof is useful (for the record, I think it is), but whether it's camp. The primarily litmus test for understanding whether something is camp is to consider whether it's \"too much.\" For most of us, that proof is too much.\n\nRemember that a central tenet of camp is the reformulation of the mundane as remarkable. Here, the mathematical rigor employed in economics does exactly that: it takes a very obvious repercussion of a few assumptions about how people make choices and renders it inaccessible but notationally beautiful. The fixation of the economic thought here is not *what's* being said but *how* it's said. In [Susan Sontag's *Notes on Camp*](https://monoskop.org/images/5/59/Sontag_Susan_1964_Notes_on_Camp.pdf), she notes the following: \"[Camp] is the love of the exaggerated, the \"off,\" of things-being-what-they-are-not.\" It's difficult‚Äîperhaps impossible‚Äîto take that reading of camp, review the proof displayed above, and not conclude that it at very least conforms to her idea. The proof leads us to question the relationship between human behavior as we experience it and human behavior as it's presented by economics. Something about the assertion that all those symbols can tell us something about human behavior seems \"off.\"\n\nWhether ideas are afforded legitimacy and respect in the field of economics often relies on proofs like the one above. That is, economics not only sometimes embraces a camp aesthetic but actually *demands* it and delights in it. Camp is primarily a mode communication rather than a set of ideas, just as economics is primarily a methodology rather than a body of knowledge. The project of social sciences as a whole is roughly to understand humanity from a divorced, analytical perspective: to examine it rather than experience it. Economics‚Äîmore than other fields‚Äîdivorces itself from reality through the use of a mathematical language that is presented rather obnoxiously and struggles to capture nuance. As economics grows, it relies on its previous simplifications and exaggerates them, continuously campifying itself.\n\nThe most satisfyingly campy aspect of economics is its naivety. As economics continues to hyperbolize human behavior, it generally maintains that its project is important and serious. Economists won't tell you that economics assumptions and their repercussions are true, but they often underestimate how the ostentatiousness of their discipline impacts the way it's understood. The purpose of identifying the campiness of economic theory is not to criticize it or claim that it's wholly wrong‚Äîit's to properly qualify it. The campiness of economics is useful when it's understood: just as we don't make political decisions based solely or even primarily on a cabaret performance, it's nonsensical to assume the findings of economic theory and its ideological brethren are unquestionably true or even useful.\n\nIf we believe that economics demands mathematically campy aesthetics and finds value in its mathematical rigor, then perhaps we can identify how exactly camp is useful. To analyze and acknowledge camp is, to some extent, a betrayal of its nature as a purely aesthetic and artistic mode. Importantly, any application of camp aesthetics that *aims* to be politically or ideologically useful or enlightening is probably not truly camp. Economic theory (and perhaps just theory in general) is sort of an exploration of the question \"What would happen if we made a few basic assumptions and then *really* doubled down on them?\" More importantly, to those who are critical of its assumptions, it provides an opportunity to ask \"What can we learn about ourselves and about the world by purposely being a little bit ridiculous?\"\n\nIn many ways, academia is the project of going down a rabbit-hole and being a little ridiculous and obsessive. It's doing something truly arcane but not exactly understanding or acknowledging how divorced from reality it is. The fact that economics can be regarded as camp illuminates that purportedly unartistic or scientific endeavors have something to gain by taking themselves less seriously (or perhaps taking themselves seriously in a different way) and examining themselves as art. It also demonstrates that the realm of aesthetics and sensibility can be applied and made useful in seemingly unnatural or foreign spaces. Camp is largely understood as something that can be performed, and considering economics as a sort of communicative performance affords us a new perspective on how economics operates.\n\nThe classification of economics as camp demonstrates that the interpretive generosity of artists and culturists can be a powerful aid in coming to a holistic understanding of our world. To label something as camp is not intentionally antagonistic, but sympathetic and appreciative. It locates entertainment and humor where a more analytical approach may find only tragedy. Camp invites rather than condemns‚Äîappreciates rather than mocks. Camp sensibility finds value in the project of economics, but not the same value that economists might find. \n\nFor me, employing a camp sensibility to my understanding of economics allowed me to reformulate a harsh critique of economic theory and reveal intuitions about why I hold a deep appreciation for economics despite my criticisms. To adopt camp sensibility is to be empathetic and generous. Camp reinterprets cheesiness and misunderstanding as positive by divorcing them from judgement and evaluation and acknowledging an aesthetic appreciation from them. In that sense, coming to an understanding of economics as camp has laid the foundation for me to queer economics‚Äîto meet it where it is and to realize that even as criticize economics, I can always appreciate its art.\n\n\n*quasimatt is an anti-intellectual.

I seek to understand not only how economics can be understood as camp, but to reveal what it means for something to be camp and how camp sensibility can be useful.\n\nI begin with a theory of camp: camp sensibility is ill-defined by language alone and relies on a primarily working (rather than definitional) knowledge of queer sociability and its humors. It is a sensibility and an aesthetic that is frivolously audacious and necessarily impertinent: it's a regurgitation of banalities that are performed with such exaggeration that they find value not in their content but in their drama. \n\nCamp behavior often reformulates mundanity and presents it as remarkable‚Äîit hyperbolizes the status quo until it seems subversive, innovative, or revolutionary. The camp aesthetic operates within a tension between the familiar and the alien: it renders unusual behaviors and methodologies navigable by applying them to familiar and accessible plots or concepts. In short, it takes something that seems natural and presents it in its most fabricated and unnatural form. To do something campy involves misunderstanding and overestimating the importance and seriousness of what you're doing.\n\nEconomics aims to focuses on human behavior and its repercussions as defined by economic assumptions. That is, it takes something that's intimately familiar‚Äîhuman behavior‚Äîand communicates it in a reduced form, focusing on and exaggerating certain tendencies such as self-interest. In true camp fashion, oversimplification actually leads to obfuscation and misunderstanding: the basis for the campiness of economic theory is its ignorance of nuance and its mathematically ostentatious presentation.\n\nAll it takes is a quick perusal of an introductory economics textbook or a few clicks on the Wikipedia page on microeconomics to understand the ostentatiousness of economic theory. In order to understand how mathematical representation in economics is camp, let's examine a simple and foundational concept in economics: preference theory. Take a look at this excerpt from [*Introduction to Choice Theory* by Levin and Milgrom:](https://web.stanford.edu/~jdlevin/Econ%20202/Choice%20Theory.pdf)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/494f9b24-25aa-4818-961c-84c6d85340f7.png?height=998&width=1166)\n\nThe general concept being communicated by this proof is rather simple: if someone is evaluating a set of goods and is able to rank them all and then makes all good-selecting choices in accordance with their ranking, then their decision-making process can never be arbitrary. This is painfully obvious when stated in plain language, but hard for the average person to understand when stated as a mathematical proof. The issue at hand is not whether the proof is useful (for the record, I think it is), but whether it's camp. The primarily litmus test for understanding whether something is camp is to consider whether it's \"too much.\" For most of us, that proof is too much.\n\nRemember that a central tenet of camp is the reformulation of the mundane as remarkable. Here, the mathematical rigor employed in economics does exactly that: it takes a very obvious repercussion of a few assumptions about how people make choices and renders it inaccessible but notationally beautiful. The fixation of the economic thought here is not *what's* being said but *how* it's said. In [Susan Sontag's *Notes on Camp*](https://monoskop.org/images/5/59/Sontag_Susan_1964_Notes_on_Camp.pdf), she notes the following: \"[Camp] is the love of the exaggerated, the \"off,\" of things-being-what-they-are-not.\" It's difficult‚Äîperhaps impossible‚Äîto take that reading of camp, review the proof displayed above, and not conclude that it at very least conforms to her idea. The proof leads us to question the relationship between human behavior as we experience it and human behavior as it's presented by economics. Something about the assertion that all those symbols can tell us something about human behavior seems \"off.\"\n\nWhether ideas are afforded legitimacy and respect in the field of economics often relies on proofs like the one above. That is, economics not only sometimes embraces a camp aesthetic but actually *demands* it and delights in it. Camp is primarily a mode communication rather than a set of ideas, just as economics is primarily a methodology rather than a body of knowledge. The project of social sciences as a whole is roughly to understand humanity from a divorced, analytical perspective: to examine it rather than experience it. Economics‚Äîmore than other fields‚Äîdivorces itself from reality through the use of a mathematical language that is presented rather obnoxiously and struggles to capture nuance. As economics grows, it relies on its previous simplifications and exaggerates them, continuously campifying itself.\n\nThe most satisfyingly campy aspect of economics is its naivety. As economics continues to hyperbolize human behavior, it generally maintains that its project is important and serious. Economists won't tell you that economics assumptions and their repercussions are true, but they often underestimate how the ostentatiousness of their discipline impacts the way it's understood. The purpose of identifying the campiness of economic theory is not to criticize it or claim that it's wholly wrong‚Äîit's to properly qualify it. The campiness of economics is useful when it's understood: just as we don't make political decisions based solely or even primarily on a cabaret performance, it's nonsensical to assume the findings of economic theory and its ideological brethren are unquestionably true or even useful.\n\nIf we believe that economics demands mathematically campy aesthetics and finds value in its mathematical rigor, then perhaps we can identify how exactly camp is useful. To analyze and acknowledge camp is, to some extent, a betrayal of its nature as a purely aesthetic and artistic mode. Importantly, any application of camp aesthetics that *aims* to be politically or ideologically useful or enlightening is probably not truly camp. Economic theory (and perhaps just theory in general) is sort of an exploration of the question \"What would happen if we made a few basic assumptions and then *really* doubled down on them?\" More importantly, to those who are critical of its assumptions, it provides an opportunity to ask \"What can we learn about ourselves and about the world by purposely being a little bit ridiculous?\"\n\nIn many ways, academia is the project of going down a rabbit-hole and being a little ridiculous and obsessive. It's doing something truly arcane but not exactly understanding or acknowledging how divorced from reality it is. The fact that economics can be regarded as camp illuminates that purportedly unartistic or scientific endeavors have something to gain by taking themselves less seriously (or perhaps taking themselves seriously in a different way) and examining themselves as art. It also demonstrates that the realm of aesthetics and sensibility can be applied and made useful in seemingly unnatural or foreign spaces. Camp is largely understood as something that can be performed, and considering economics as a sort of communicative performance affords us a new perspective on how economics operates.\n\nThe classification of economics as camp demonstrates that the interpretive generosity of artists and culturists can be a powerful aid in coming to a holistic understanding of our world. To label something as camp is not intentionally antagonistic, but sympathetic and appreciative. It locates entertainment and humor where a more analytical approach may find only tragedy. Camp invites rather than condemns‚Äîappreciates rather than mocks. Camp sensibility finds value in the project of economics, but not the same value that economists might find. \n\nFor me, employing a camp sensibility to my understanding of economics allowed me to reformulate a harsh critique of economic theory and reveal intuitions about why I hold a deep appreciation for economics despite my criticisms. To adopt camp sensibility is to be empathetic and generous. Camp reinterprets cheesiness and misunderstanding as positive by divorcing them from judgement and evaluation and acknowledging an aesthetic appreciation of them. In that sense, coming to an understanding of economics as camp has laid the foundation for me to queer economics‚Äîto meet it where it is and to realize that even as I criticize economics, I can always appreciate its art.\n\n\n*quasimatt is an anti-intellectual.

Reserve auctions are configured with two main parameters: the reserve price and the auction duration. Like other economic blocks on Mirror, your auction is deployed as a smart contract and can be embedded inside any Mirror entry.\n\n## How auctions work\n\nWhen a bid is placed that matches or exceeds your reserve price, the auction duration countdown begins. Let's imagine that Alice creates an auction with a reserve price of 1 ETH and a duration of 12 hours.\n\n1. Bob places a bid of 1 ETH.\n2. The clock starts counting down from 12 hours.\n3. Any bids placed within the last 15 minutes of the auction reset the clock to 15 minutes.\n4. A new bid must be 10% higher than the previous bid.\n5. The collector that is last to place a bid before the auction ends wins the NFT.\n\n## Launching an auction\n\n### **Pick an NFT**\n\nTo create an Auction, pick an NFT from the \"Select NFT\" dropdown. Any Zora NFTs that are owned by the wallet that controls your Mirror publication will be pre-populated in the dropdown.\n\n### **Route the funds**\n\nProceeds from the auction can be routed to any Ethereum address or smart contract. If you want to route the funds for yourself, put your Ethereum address here.\n\nAlternatively, funds can flow to other economic blocks on Mirror, such as Crowdfunds or Splits. To route the proceeds from the NFT auction to  your Crowdfund, put your Crowdfund address here. You can also share funds with multiple entities by routing it to a Split contract address.\n\n### **Set the limits**\n\nHow long should the auction run after the first bid? What should the reserve price be?\n\n### **Deploying**\n\nAfter you deploy the auction, you'll get an embed code that you can paste into your entry.

{"id": "9bdTL5gSTl6FID-ONokqm_Dv9jd1UA1poy06fVHsfCQ", "title": "Gelato Interview by Bspeak! \n", "body": "*Gelato recently launched its v2.0 and announced the token $GEL. I've been watching the project since 2019 and thought would be a great infrastructure for smart contracts in general. This time, I had a chance to interview with the team. This was translated in Japanese and posted in my weekly newsletter [Bspeak!](https://bspeak.substack.com/). Anyway, enjoy the interview.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5bf2da5f-33e9-4bac-a7a6-990e861ac28c.jpeg?height=560&width=990)\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n\n***CoffeeTimes: Hello Gelato teamüç¶! Can you tell us what Gelato Network is in a nutshell?***\n\nGelato: [Gelato Network](https://www.gelato.network/) is an open marketplace to match developers‚Äô demand for transaction automation with the supply of a decentralized network of bots. It empowers developers to build automated dapps and allows bot operators to earn revenue from running the infrastructure necessary for such automations. Further important members of Gelato‚Äôs ecosystem and community include the team that develops and distributes much of the technology needed for the marketplace. \n\nSoon, after Gelato‚Äôs native token - $GEL - will have been released, its holders will also play a crucial part in governing the network and shaping its success and path into the future.\n\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: What made you start this project?***\nGelato: We started the project back in May 2019 after we received a grant from Gnosis Ecosystem Fund (GECO). \n\nref: [https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-ecosystem-fund-update-ii-9bea803a97c8](https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-ecosystem-fund-update-ii-9bea803a97c8?gi=84e40da1e1c9)\n\nInitially, we worked on automating certain aspects of Gnosis‚Äôs DutchX exchange back then. However, we quickly realized that the need for automating dapps is ubiquitous. Web2 users are completely accustomed to an automated User Experience thanks to centralized servers controlling a lot of your data. In Ethereum, and decentralized blockchains in general, this great user experience is very hard to replicate because here we explicitly do not want users to trade in custody over their data and funds to a centralized server for a better UX. This would sacrifice most of the benefits of the decentralized web. So in the summer of 2019 we set out to build a solution for developers and users alike that allows for a decentralized application layer with a slick automated user experience, without the need for users to give away control over their keys and funds - Gelato Network was born. \n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/be0267e3-a57a-443e-a218-f7ad87d99454.jpeg?height=874&width=1310)\n\nLuis and Hilmar, 2021\n\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: What is Sorbet Finance? Is it like a side project on top of Gelato?***\n\nGelato: Yes, [Sorbet Finance](https://www.sorbet.finance/) is its own project that makes use of the Gelato Network in its backend. In Sorbet‚Äôs case it uses the Gelato network to continually monitor prices on DEX and then execute a users‚Äô limit orders once their specified desired price target is reached. All that is achieved while the users keep full control over their funds. Also Sorbet now features Dollar Cost Averaging, which allows users to automatically sell a portion of a token spread out in several chunks and time intervals, to decrease the slippage per trade. Cool features like Sorbet that use Gelato Network to automate some aspect of a dapp can be built by any developer. \n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: You have announced several collaborations. Can we expect any other collaborations in the close future?***\n\nGelato: Yes, for sure. We are in close talks with many of the famous and not-yet-famous projects out there on Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, and whatnot. Almost every DeFi developer needs automation and we‚Äôre here to help them get it. \n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: You recently have announced GEL tokens. What is the purpose of GEL tokens? If Executors bot act maliciously, it would lead to a crucial problem (front running or just harming dapp users). Does GEL token slashing prevent it enough?***\n\nGelato: $GEL tokens will be used to 1) incentivise, govern, and police network participants and 2) allocate network resources efficiently. \n\nBots who want to earn a revenue from providing their infrastructure services to the Gelato network will have to stake a lot of $GEL tokens to attain and retain this privilege. This will open the door for more complex use cases to be built on top of Gelato, which might require an element of trust into the bots that will execute their automations. For such use cases having the bots put up a bonded stake, which can be slashed if they act maliciously, is essential. However, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that there are also many use cases which can be implemented so that they are trustless by default and thus do not have to rely on such a staking and slashing mechanism. Furthermore, the $GEL token will also be used to positively incentivize all network participants, developers, bots, and users alike that bring traffic to the network. \n\nOne other major use of $GEL is to efficiently allocate network infrastructure resources to dapps and users that demand them. Ethereum and other chains usually are constrained resource environments. There are only so many transactions that can fit into a block. Therefore, in order to scale a decentralized network like Gelato, decisions regarding the timing priority of transactions will have to be made by dapp developers and ultimately the bots that send them to the network. To gain priority in this technological resource allocation mechanism, developers and end users will have the ability to also lock up $GEL to assign different weights to their transactions. As a result, bots are incentivized to allocate more resources to such staked dapps or users, who, like them, are also long $GEL via their boned stakes.\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: About token distribution, how would you plan on it?***\nGelato: At the moment we cannot share details with the public yet other than that we plan to do a public sale for $GEL tokens early this summer. Stay tuned, we will announce more details soon on our Medium and Twitter accounts.\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: Okay further question about GEL, allocation/tokenomics are already fixed?***\n\nGelato: We will announce more details about token allocation and tokenomics in an upcoming article. Right now this information is not yet public. \n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: How would the GelatoDAO become sustainable? I assume the protocol would take a fee based on transactions but can you elaborate the model?***\n\nGelato: The GelatoDAO will be governed by people that have a vested interest in governing and maintaining the Gelato Network. For example, dapp developers that make extensive use of Gelato for their automation needs are strongly incentivized to participate in important decision-making around things like what features should be prioritised by Gelato‚Äôs core team in upcoming releases, what fees bots can charge, and whether certain bots should be slashed and kicked from the network, if they misbehave. Therefore, there is an organic tendency for many network participants to participate in the DAO to steadily improve the welfare of the network purely out of rational self-interest. In the future, the DAO could also retain a small network fee, but since its membership will likely largely consist of network participants the ultimate fee payers will have significant control over this decision themselves.\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: Gelato seems to have a great connection with Gnosis and other DAOs (TheLAO / MetaCartel Ventures), how did you start and deepen these relationships with them?***\n\nGelato: We partnered with MetaCartel early on in late 2019 when we applied for a grant from them and made it into their 3rd cohort.\n\nref: [https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-cohort-1-6336cdca05db](https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-cohort-1-6336cdca05db)\n\nEven though Peter Pan sat next to us in Berlin‚Äôs crypto co-working space Full Node from the start, we eventually really got to know him online.

I've been watching the project since 2019 and thought would be a great infrastructure for smart contracts in general. This time, I had a chance to interview with the team. This was translated in Japanese and posted in my weekly newsletter [Bspeak!](https://bspeak.substack.com/). Anyway, enjoy the interview.*\n\n*This is not investment advice and informational purposes only.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5bf2da5f-33e9-4bac-a7a6-990e861ac28c.jpeg?height=560&width=990)\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n\n***CoffeeTimes: Hello Gelato teamüç¶! Can you tell us what Gelato Network is in a nutshell?***\n\nGelato: [Gelato Network](https://www.gelato.network/) is an open marketplace to match developers‚Äô demand for transaction automation with the supply of a decentralized network of bots. It empowers developers to build automated dapps and allows bot operators to earn revenue from running the infrastructure necessary for such automations. Further important members of Gelato‚Äôs ecosystem and community include the team that develops and distributes much of the technology needed for the marketplace. \n\nSoon, after Gelato‚Äôs native token - $GEL - will have been released, its holders will also play a crucial part in governing the network and shaping its success and path into the future.\n\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: What made you start this project?***\nGelato: We started the project back in May 2019 after we received a grant from Gnosis Ecosystem Fund (GECO). \n\nref: [https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-ecosystem-fund-update-ii-9bea803a97c8](https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-ecosystem-fund-update-ii-9bea803a97c8?gi=84e40da1e1c9)\n\nInitially, we worked on automating certain aspects of Gnosis‚Äôs DutchX exchange back then. However, we quickly realized that the need for automating dapps is ubiquitous. Web2 users are completely accustomed to an automated User Experience thanks to centralized servers controlling a lot of your data. In Ethereum, and decentralized blockchains in general, this great user experience is very hard to replicate because here we explicitly do not want users to trade in custody over their data and funds to a centralized server for a better UX. This would sacrifice most of the benefits of the decentralized web. So in the summer of 2019 we set out to build a solution for developers and users alike that allows for a decentralized application layer with a slick automated user experience, without the need for users to give away control over their keys and funds - Gelato Network was born. \n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/be0267e3-a57a-443e-a218-f7ad87d99454.jpeg?height=874&width=1310)\n\nLuis and Hilmar, 2021\n\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: What is Sorbet Finance? Is it like a side project on top of Gelato?***\n\nGelato: Yes, [Sorbet Finance](https://www.sorbet.finance/) is its own project that makes use of the Gelato Network in its backend. In Sorbet‚Äôs case it uses the Gelato network to continually monitor prices on DEX and then execute a users‚Äô limit orders once their specified desired price target is reached. All that is achieved while the users keep full control over their funds. Also Sorbet now features Dollar Cost Averaging, which allows users to automatically sell a portion of a token spread out in several chunks and time intervals, to decrease the slippage per trade. Cool features like Sorbet that use Gelato Network to automate some aspect of a dapp can be built by any developer. \n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: You have announced several collaborations. Can we expect any other collaborations in the close future?***\n\nGelato: Yes, for sure. We are in close talks with many of the famous and not-yet-famous projects out there on Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, and whatnot. Almost every DeFi developer needs automation and we‚Äôre here to help them get it. \n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: You recently have announced GEL tokens. What is the purpose of GEL tokens? If Executors bot act maliciously, it would lead to a crucial problem (front running or just harming dapp users). Does GEL token slashing prevent it enough?***\n\nGelato: $GEL tokens will be used to 1) incentivise, govern, and police network participants and 2) allocate network resources efficiently. \n\nBots who want to earn a revenue from providing their infrastructure services to the Gelato network will have to stake a lot of $GEL tokens to attain and retain this privilege. This will open the door for more complex use cases to be built on top of Gelato, which might require an element of trust into the bots that will execute their automations. For such use cases having the bots put up a bonded stake, which can be slashed if they act maliciously, is essential. However, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that there are also many use cases which can be implemented so that they are trustless by default and thus do not have to rely on such a staking and slashing mechanism. Furthermore, the $GEL token will also be used to positively incentivize all network participants, developers, bots, and users alike that bring traffic to the network. \n\nOne other major use of $GEL is to efficiently allocate network infrastructure resources to dapps and users that demand them. Ethereum and other chains usually are constrained resource environments. There are only so many transactions that can fit into a block. Therefore, in order to scale a decentralized network like Gelato, decisions regarding the timing priority of transactions will have to be made by dapp developers and ultimately the bots that send them to the network. To gain priority in this technological resource allocation mechanism, developers and end users will have the ability to also lock up $GEL to assign different weights to their transactions. As a result, bots are incentivized to allocate more resources to such staked dapps or users, who, like them, are also long $GEL via their boned stakes.\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: About token distribution, how would you plan on it?***\nGelato: At the moment we cannot share details with the public yet other than that we plan to do a public sale for $GEL tokens early this summer. Stay tuned, we will announce more details soon on our Medium and Twitter accounts.\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: Okay further question about GEL, allocation/tokenomics are already fixed?***\n\nGelato: We will announce more details about token allocation and tokenomics in an upcoming article. Right now this information is not yet public. \n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: How would the GelatoDAO become sustainable? I assume the protocol would take a fee based on transactions but can you elaborate the model?***\n\nGelato: The GelatoDAO will be governed by people that have a vested interest in governing and maintaining the Gelato Network. For example, dapp developers that make extensive use of Gelato for their automation needs are strongly incentivized to participate in important decision-making around things like what features should be prioritised by Gelato‚Äôs core team in upcoming releases, what fees bots can charge, and whether certain bots should be slashed and kicked from the network, if they misbehave. Therefore, there is an organic tendency for many network participants to participate in the DAO to steadily improve the welfare of the network purely out of rational self-interest. In the future, the DAO could also retain a small network fee, but since its membership will likely largely consist of network participants the ultimate fee payers will have significant control over this decision themselves.\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: Gelato seems to have a great connection with Gnosis and other DAOs (TheLAO / MetaCartel Ventures), how did you start and deepen these relationships with them?***\n\nGelato: We partnered with MetaCartel early on in late 2019 when we applied for a grant from them and made it into their 3rd cohort.\n\nref: [https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-cohort-1-6336cdca05db](https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-cohort-1-6336cdca05db)\n\nEven though Peter Pan sat next to us in Berlin‚Äôs crypto co-working space Full Node from the start, we eventually really got to know him online.

I've been watching the project since 2019 and thought would be a great infrastructure for smart contracts in general. This time, I had a chance to interview the team. This was translated into Japanese and posted in my weekly newsletter [Bspeak!](https://bspeak.substack.com/). Anyway, enjoy the interview.*\n\n*This is not investment advice and informational purposes only.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5bf2da5f-33e9-4bac-a7a6-990e861ac28c.jpeg?height=560&width=990)\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n\n***CoffeeTimes: Hello Gelato teamüç¶! Can you tell us what Gelato Network is in a nutshell?***\n\nGelato: [Gelato Network](https://www.gelato.network/) is an open marketplace to match developers‚Äô demand for transaction automation with the supply of a decentralized network of bots. It empowers developers to build automated dapps and allows bot operators to earn revenue from running the infrastructure necessary for such automations. Further important members of Gelato‚Äôs ecosystem and community include the team that develops and distributes much of the technology needed for the marketplace. \n\nSoon, after Gelato‚Äôs native token - $GEL - will have been released, its holders will also play a crucial part in governing the network and shaping its success and path into the future.\n\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: What made you start this project?***\nGelato: We started the project back in May 2019 after we received a grant from Gnosis Ecosystem Fund (GECO). \n\nref: [https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-ecosystem-fund-update-ii-9bea803a97c8](https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-ecosystem-fund-update-ii-9bea803a97c8?gi=84e40da1e1c9)\n\nInitially, we worked on automating certain aspects of Gnosis‚Äôs DutchX exchange back then. However, we quickly realized that the need for automating dapps is ubiquitous. Web2 users are completely accustomed to an automated User Experience thanks to centralized servers controlling a lot of your data. In Ethereum, and decentralized blockchains in general, this great user experience is very hard to replicate because here we explicitly do not want users to trade in custody over their data and funds to a centralized server for a better UX. This would sacrifice most of the benefits of the decentralized web. So in the summer of 2019 we set out to build a solution for developers and users alike that allows for a decentralized application layer with a slick automated user experience, without the need for users to give away control over their keys and funds - Gelato Network was born. \n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/be0267e3-a57a-443e-a218-f7ad87d99454.jpeg?height=874&width=1310)\n\nLuis and Hilmar, 2021\n\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: What is Sorbet Finance? Is it like a side project on top of Gelato?***\n\nGelato: Yes, [Sorbet Finance](https://www.sorbet.finance/) is its own project that makes use of the Gelato Network in its backend. In Sorbet‚Äôs case it uses the Gelato network to continually monitor prices on DEX and then execute a users‚Äô limit orders once their specified desired price target is reached. All that is achieved while the users keep full control over their funds. Also Sorbet now features Dollar Cost Averaging, which allows users to automatically sell a portion of a token spread out in several chunks and time intervals, to decrease the slippage per trade. Cool features like Sorbet that use Gelato Network to automate some aspect of a dapp can be built by any developer. \n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: You have announced several collaborations. Can we expect any other collaborations in the close future?***\n\nGelato: Yes, for sure. We are in close talks with many of the famous and not-yet-famous projects out there on Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, and whatnot. Almost every DeFi developer needs automation and we‚Äôre here to help them get it. \n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: You recently have announced GEL tokens. What is the purpose of GEL tokens? If Executors bot act maliciously, it would lead to a crucial problem (front running or just harming dapp users). Does GEL token slashing prevent it enough?***\n\nGelato: $GEL tokens will be used to 1) incentivise, govern, and police network participants and 2) allocate network resources efficiently. \n\nBots who want to earn a revenue from providing their infrastructure services to the Gelato network will have to stake a lot of $GEL tokens to attain and retain this privilege. This will open the door for more complex use cases to be built on top of Gelato, which might require an element of trust into the bots that will execute their automations. For such use cases having the bots put up a bonded stake, which can be slashed if they act maliciously, is essential. However, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that there are also many use cases which can be implemented so that they are trustless by default and thus do not have to rely on such a staking and slashing mechanism. Furthermore, the $GEL token will also be used to positively incentivize all network participants, developers, bots, and users alike that bring traffic to the network. \n\nOne other major use of $GEL is to efficiently allocate network infrastructure resources to dapps and users that demand them. Ethereum and other chains usually are constrained resource environments. There are only so many transactions that can fit into a block. Therefore, in order to scale a decentralized network like Gelato, decisions regarding the timing priority of transactions will have to be made by dapp developers and ultimately the bots that send them to the network. To gain priority in this technological resource allocation mechanism, developers and end users will have the ability to also lock up $GEL to assign different weights to their transactions. As a result, bots are incentivized to allocate more resources to such staked dapps or users, who, like them, are also long $GEL via their boned stakes.\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: About token distribution, how would you plan on it?***\nGelato: At the moment we cannot share details with the public yet other than that we plan to do a public sale for $GEL tokens early this summer. Stay tuned, we will announce more details soon on our Medium and Twitter accounts.\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: Okay further question about GEL, allocation/tokenomics are already fixed?***\n\nGelato: We will announce more details about token allocation and tokenomics in an upcoming article. Right now this information is not yet public. \n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: How would the GelatoDAO become sustainable? I assume the protocol would take a fee based on transactions but can you elaborate the model?***\n\nGelato: The GelatoDAO will be governed by people that have a vested interest in governing and maintaining the Gelato Network. For example, dapp developers that make extensive use of Gelato for their automation needs are strongly incentivized to participate in important decision-making around things like what features should be prioritised by Gelato‚Äôs core team in upcoming releases, what fees bots can charge, and whether certain bots should be slashed and kicked from the network, if they misbehave. Therefore, there is an organic tendency for many network participants to participate in the DAO to steadily improve the welfare of the network purely out of rational self-interest. In the future, the DAO could also retain a small network fee, but since its membership will likely largely consist of network participants the ultimate fee payers will have significant control over this decision themselves.\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: Gelato seems to have a great connection with Gnosis and other DAOs (TheLAO / MetaCartel Ventures), how did you start and deepen these relationships with them?***\n\nGelato: We partnered with MetaCartel early on in late 2019 when we applied for a grant from them and made it into their 3rd cohort.\n\nref: [https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-cohort-1-6336cdca05db](https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-cohort-1-6336cdca05db)\n\nEven though Peter Pan sat next to us in Berlin‚Äôs crypto co-working space Full Node from the start, we eventually really got to know him online. He was super helpful and interested in Gelato and really also helped us with closing our Seed Funding in late summer 2020. The LAO was also part of our Seed Round and we are in frequent contact with both members of the LAO, like Aaron and Pri, and members of MetaCartel, like Peter and Victor. They usually help us greatly with legal, strategic, or community-related questions. Being active in DAOs and just talking to their members is definitely a good thing every crypto entrepreneur should.\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: Please tell us briefly about your future plans in the coming few months!***\n\nGelato: Uh boi, there is a lot to unpack here but let us be crisp. For this summer the plan is to: \n- ship, ship, ship: new automated features on Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, and Fantom. We want Sorbet‚Äôs limit orders to be on every AMM and we want more and more protocols to integrate Gelato for liquidation protection and automated transfers, withdraws, deposits and so on. \n- launch $GEL \n- launch the Gelato DAO and start involving $GEL holders in decision-making around which features to prioritise \n- Developer mining programs with $GEL to get more developers to build on Gelato \n\nDefinitely join our Telegram or Discord communities to stay up to date. I am sure there will be feature releases for you or as a developer you have the opportunity to participate in our developer mining program, which we will launch after the $GEL token sale. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5e66c1b3-7d34-441b-ae17-7c7cb98e5f3d.jpeg?height=594&width=623)\n\n\nRoadmapÔºö[WhitePaper v1.0](https://aristaticfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/Gelato+Whitepaper+V1.0,+May+2021+(02).pdf)\n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***CoffeeTimes: Can you give any words to the Japanese audience? Do you have any impressions on Japanese crypto scene? I think I saw a photo somewhere of when the team came to Tokyo***\n\nGelato: Gelato had a strong Japanese community right from the start. We are super thankful for that and we definitely want to connect more with them. If any Japanese developers want to automate smart contracts, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out. Unfortunately, we have not been to Tokyo yet. However, after COVID settles down we will definitely go. \n\nOur team is very multinational, we have members from Switzerland, US, Germany, France, China, Australia, and Egypt. However, we don‚Äôt have a Japanese team member yet. We are currently actively looking for frontend and backend developers with web3 experience, so if anybody in our Japanese community wants a job with us please apply here: https://angel.co/company/gelato-network! \n„ÄÄ\n„ÄÄ\n***(CoffeeTimes: By the way, why is the name Gelato?

What do they remind you of? A forgotten time? The nostalgia of an experience since passed? \n\nhttps://twitter.com/enaraxr/status/1355450773212172290?s=20\n\nAs combed through the various voice recordings on my iPhone, I found a selection of memories from a secret party in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan that I attended. I didn't immediately think to make them into NFTs. It wasn't until I had gone through the motions on Zora that the audio looped over and over that it clicked. This was the perfect experiment in documenting, sharing, and collecting memories.\n\nWhat could I reveal to the listener? Could they learn about me? And because we had all been deprived of events, could these moments hold a deeper meaning to the fleeting nature of socialization? Did we take for granted the ever innocuous social gathering? I'm not sure. But these are questions that have continued to come into view the longer I've sat with these voice notes.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/178)\n\n \n\nClose your eyes, think of yourself either as the observer of the scene, or part of the scene, and let your mind paint the picture of the environment. Imagine where the DJ is, where the characters are, what type of house are you in? \n\nThe first of three notes in this trilogy called ***[\"Shƒ´kurettopƒÅtƒ´: One Night In Kurosakimachi\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/178)***, it's serendipitous that my phone picked up both a conversation I'm having about crate-digging at one of the only remaining Tower Record stores in the world *AND* amazing house music. The instrumentation starts to swell with a soulful synth as the conversation reaches a euphoric note as we make the resolve to buy records and acknowledge how awesome the moment is.\n\nThe remaining two notes, ***[\"Not Now, But In The Future\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/189)*** and ***[\"Chinese Omelette OST\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/188)*** create this unintended effect of feeling like a short film with your own visual dreamscape constructing a memory that‚Äôs unique to you despite the fact that the audio is not your lived experience.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/189)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/188)\n\n*Chinese Omelette OST is the last remaining NFT of the Shƒ´kurettopƒÅtƒ´ trilogy to be collected.*\n\nI've posted the NFTs in the order I believe to be the most chronologically accurate, although any DJ will tell you that there are many highs and lows in a set that when you *think* it's over, there is more around the corner! I'd be super curious to see what YOU see, more so than my own recollection of the space and the folks within it.\n\n\n---\n\n### Spatial Conversations\n\nIn the context of memories, archived works in many ways achieve a similar effect of nostalgia. While they may not draw from life as a form of `reporting-lived-experience-as-documentation`, works that pull on the thread of life can be memory-inducing. For me, one of those works is a live recording in 2014 of a freeform DJ set with my uni-mates after a day of getting unbelievably stoned called \"SYNESTHESIA\". \n\nYou might be wondering why it's called SYNESTHESIA. For me, and others who experience two or more sensory inputs involuntarily, DJing soundscapes puts me into a trance-like state of flow. I can see threads of light guiding me to my next note as if I'm being controlled. I really don't remember the act of playing only the fact that I've *played* a set. In a way, perhaps there is a narrative to it all that I cannot comprehend. Oddly enough, I've been watching a show called [The Nevers](https://www.hbo.com/the-nevers) which has a character who can sing but she cannot understand what she is actually communicating. Even stranger, only a certain group of people can hear it too. I haven't found a metaphor so closely aligned with my own personal experiences with music.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/1643)\n\nAs a treat to my uni-mates, and to break them into the NFT space, I decided to put \"SYNESTHESIA\" up for auction with a 1.5 ETH reserve on Zora, to show them one of the core principles that solidifies why crypto can lead to an equitable future. For being supporters of my experiments, I wanted to reward them a split from the proceeds of the sale from the 35-minute live session and essay.\n\nI believe redistribution at all levels should be explored. While there is nothing stopping me from gladly auctioning these NFTs without attribution, I am a firm believer in trying to capture the entire story involving my work. I am currently publishing an essay \"Creative Immortality\" that speaks to the inclusion of others as a necessary component to the preservation of work enabling the natural line of discovery to take place. \n\nAs creatives, we can never have enough inspiration. Attribution provides us with our next set of sources to draw from. And now, we can trace the value these inspirations give us and pay it forward.   \n\n---\n\n### Special Thanks\n\nI want to give a special thanks to everyone involved in the creation of the Secret Party Trilogy and SYNESTHESIA. The split breakdown will derive from the sale of this essay, and both the Chinese Omelette OST + SYNESTHESIA NFMTs. Because SYNESTHESIA is auctioned through Zora's deployment of $BOUNTY and not on Mirror, 30% of the funds will be added as a tip to the split contract attached to this essay.\n\nSplit Recipients:\n\nSCAD Roomies (30%)\nW.T.
