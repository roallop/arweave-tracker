{"id": "ICxasT0woXUsWQYbs47OBSaZ219C_z3-bXEIsVYWyZI", "title": "Tutorial: Stream Tokens with Superfluid", "body": "## What is Superfluid?\nSuperfluid is a composable DeFi primitive that allows you to Stream tokens from one address to another on a second-by-second basis. Some use-cases include, but are not limited to:\n\n- paying for subscriptions by the second instead of yearly/monthly\n- paying or being paid for work in a more granular way\n- receiving rewards every second for holding a particular token\n\n## Where is Superfluid?\n\nSuperfluid is currently only available on xDai and Polygon, which are EVM smart contract enabled side chains that are very similar to Ethereum. This means that you can use familiar tools like MetaMask to approve transactions. An added benefit is that the transaction fees on these networks are much lower than on Mainnet Ethereum. \n\nIn order to get assets onto these chains, you will need to use a bridge. Which you can find here:\n\n[ETH<>Polygon bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)\n[ETH<>xDai bridge](https://omni.xdaichain.com/)\n\nYou can look up walkthroughs on how to use those bridges, but in this tutorial, I will be showing you how to complete the Superfluid task which is required to earn the Asset Management Skill on RabbitHole, and that task needs to be completed on Polygon.\n\n## How to stream using Superfluid:\n\n### What you will need:\n\n1. A web3 wallet\n2. Some Matic in your wallet on Polygon network\n3. (Optional) Any other ERC20 token: if you want to stream a token other than Matic\n\nI will also assume that you are already familiar with approving transactions with your wallet software.\n\nOnce you have everything you need from the list above, we are ready to dive in.\n\n### Step 1. Go to your Superfluid Dashboard and connect your wallet\n\nYou can get to your dashboard by following this link: https://app.superfluid.finance/ and select the wallet client you would like to use. Depending on network conditions, it can take some time for the page to load. Just be patient. If it is taking more than a couple of minutes I have found it helps to switch to another network and then back to Polygon.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/72147e3b-30fc-4b8b-b318-181bd060a103.png?height=983&width=1920)\n\n### Step 2. Click the “Deposit” button at the top of the screen and a smaller window will pop up \n\nYou will first need to deposit some assets into Superfluid before you are able to open a stream.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/002d79b0-ced3-4088-bbe5-be20fc38859d.jpeg?height=984&width=1919)\n\n### Step 3. Search for and select the asset you want to deposit, enter the amount and then click “Deposit”\n\nA window will pop-up for you to approve the transaction. You can normally get a transaction through by paying just 1 gwei as the gas price. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/12cea553-61a7-4162-b554-6b547f85659a.jpeg?height=983&width=1920)\n\n### Step 4.  Click the “Send” button at the top of the screen and a smaller window will pop up \n\nNow that you have some tokens deposited, you can start a stream by clicking “Send”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/02098c41-ee09-4905-a319-ea233533aafa.jpeg?height=983&width=1920)\n\n### Step 5. Enter the Stream details.\n\nYou will need to fill in the following fields in order to start the stream:\n\nA. The destination address. Here I have cover it up so you don’t accidentally send me money ; )\nB. The asset you would like to send\nC. The amount you want to send, coupled with…\nD. The timeframe over which you wish to send it\n*The options are month, week, hour and one-off (which is the same as a regular transfer). Here I have chosen hour, which means I will send 0.0331 Matic to the destination every hour, at a rate of 0.00000919 Matic per second.*\nE. Populated for you to show you how much will be streamed per second\nF. Once all the fields are filled out the way you want them, you can click “Start Streaming”\n\n**It’s worth mentioning that the UI will not allow you to start a stream if it would consume your entire balance in under 4 hours. So you will need to make the appropriate calculations.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8ca8f4c5-1e78-42d9-87f4-56afa06e9690.jpeg?height=983&width=1920)\n\n### Step 6. Monitor your Stream\n\nOnce your stream is flowing you will see the “Current Streams” section will display the outflows (and inflows if you have any) for your account.\n\nThere will also be an estimate for when your account balance will run out. It will be important to keep an eye on this, and I’ll explain why in a second. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4cd353d7-7c6a-4212-b3cf-30e44401fa3c.jpeg?height=983&width=1920)\n\nIf you click on the stream that you just started, you will see some more details about it. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/40b3537a-c99b-4963-a423-c496a91631f0.jpeg?height=592&width=1022)\n\nBy clicking the pencil icon beside the “Estimated amount per month” value, you can adjust how much you are streaming, and over what time period. Editing this will require you to approve another transaction. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3e9415fa-d010-4f4c-ab9d-2889690cca69.jpeg?height=342&width=972)\n\nMost importantly you will notice that there is an amount held as a deposit.\n\n“This deposit is lost if you run out of funds and the stream gets closed automatically. Make sure to top up your balance or close the stream on time to get your deposit back.”\n\nIn order to close the stream you just need to click “Cancel Stream”, and approve a transaction. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/db2f33e4-45d7-4d49-98cc-44b2c672f0a0.jpeg?height=289&width=610)\n\n### Step 7. Redeem the task and claim your XP\n\nOnce you have opened the stream, you will have fulfilled the requirements for the task, and all you have to do is go and click the “Redeem” button and sign the message that pops up.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a554bcab-0c84-47d6-8256-b6e129c040d7.jpeg?height=397&width=1557)\n\n### That's it! \nYou are one step closer to completing the Asset Manager Skill on RabbitHole. If you have any issues completing this skill be sure to reach out in the #skill-help channel in the RabbitHole Discord. \n\n\n", "timestamp": 1628415541, "digest": "7NYhmDvjG0_PewJnLMO2Iq_NGrmHg2-Nw31CpIVB1yQ", "contributor": "0x8926B75642C2650aE3c5b227bAD2F7158ceaCCD1"}

We are currently in the middle of Phase 1. More info related to the project roadmap will soon be available of elektra.camp\n\n### Phase 1: Songcamp Elektra\n**Dates:** June 28 - August 19 2021\n\n**Goals:**\n* Create the first chapter in the Elektra story\n* Create audio-visual artwork that tells that story\n* Create an interactive web3 experience that delivers that story\n* Create 3 songs + 1 audio-visual piece (i.e. the supernova) that saves Elektra\n* Create 3 audio-visual pieces that act as centrepieces to the Elektra world and story, and vault them in the Elektra treasury\n\n### PHASE 2: Elektra DAO\n**Dates:** Begin to establish during camp, with the first official ElektraDAO call on September 1 2021 \n* Establish decentralized influence over the future of Elektra via the $ELEKTRA token\n    * Develop Elektra’s tokenomics design and distribution to incentivize high-quality participation in the project through collective ownership and governance\n    * Create a committee of camp participants + backers to continue developing the Elektra project\n    * Initial proposed tokenonmics distribution → August 9 2021\n* Develop and execute on proposals that move the Elektra story, art and project forward\n    * **EXPAND** — increase the reach and distribution of the story and art we’ve already created. Ideas: \n        * An ELEKTRA album release — audio story + songs\n        * A re-release of the Elektra interactive game that is gated by $ELEKTRA and/or Portal Tickets\n        * Alternative web3 routes to distribution + monetization of the story and artwork\n    * **ADVANCE** — continue to develop future chapters of the Elektra story and world. Ideas:\n        * Write Chapter 2 and onward of the Elektra story\n        * Create more audio-visual pieces that tell that story\n        * Create more levels to the Elektra interactive game\n        * Create more songs for future chapters\n        * Create a feature film :)", "timestamp": 1628463407, "digest": "LKv_0fUHtVg4imYjEQXZA_OGgK7DwllmKPieaIqYdVc", "contributor": "0xfC4852B5e3aF65058CdfE1D1dce26946c0C1975f"}
{"id": "2KsBJkxajZEol-BxnIuQLbyOmeIWttaPB6uNlw-WRmA", "title": "NFT Review & Outlook-2021 Q2", "body": "This article was written during the RhizomeDAO Lab team discussions in early July to help developers discover promising NFT products.\n\n## 导言\n本文是7月初 RhizomeDAO Labs 团队讨论时撰写的部分内容，旨在辅助开发者发现有潜力的 NFT 相关开发方向。\n\n## 总结\n艺术和IP类 NFT 市场价格趋向理性，加密原生游戏和 DID NFT 受到青睐，NFT 的功能性逐渐受到重视。\n\n## 加密艺术市场回归理性，长尾需求不容忽视\n\n以 FEWOCiOUS 为代表的原生加密艺术家走向佳士得和苏富比等头部艺术品拍卖平台，作品拍出高价，但大部分作品在二级市场没有重演前一次 NFT 热时的爆涨；SuperRare、MakersPlace、KnowOrigin 等平台的加密艺术品价格趋向理性，即使是头部艺术家的作品，也没有过多非理性的 FOMO 现象。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4c3f6f18-16ad-48ff-bb56-dd766fcef4d1.png?height=709&width=1749)\n\n*↑ FEWOCiOUS 在佳士得拍卖的作品。*\n\n最能印证这种变化的产品是激进拍卖平台 TopBidder，即没有任何人可以永远拥有某一个加密艺术品的NFT，只需要根据规则高出的价格出价，则可以成为对应的 NFT 下一个收藏家；加密艺术品被广泛看好的阶段，该平台的作品频繁易主，价格越来越高，而近期，TopBidder 的交易量明显减少，新上线作品的价格也相对理性。（*除此之外，这个平台在社区治理和未来其他功能方面的进展值得关注。*）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a6ade186-ab4b-4c6d-87b3-a8a4e033aedb.png?height=854&width=1721)\n\n*↑ TopBidder 主页作品展示区，加密艺术家 CryptoZR 和 Reva 的作品。*\n\n尽管如此，加密艺术创作者的数量仍在不断增加，这类创作者包括策展在内的作品展示需求足以让一些新平台杀出重围。\n\n目前的加密艺术展主要位于以 Decentraland （以下简称 DCL）和 Cryptovoxels （以下简称 CV）：DCL 地价昂贵，虚拟场馆建模难度高，对用户设备配置要求较；CV 的体素搭建上手快、相对简单，对用户配置要求低，手机也可以打开链接进行浏览，但地块稀少，加上少数人囤积居奇，地价同样昂贵。\n近期越来越火的 The Sandbox 虽然支持展示NFT，但本质上仍是 Play to earn 的沙盒游戏模式，用户也无法通过网页直接游览建筑。\n\n对于新进场的第三世界加密艺术家，特别是一些第一次接触加密行业的艺术创作者而言，想要在虚拟世界创建个人展览，只能选择一些加密艺术社区和公益组织，如中国加密艺术收藏家曹寅发起的 Metaverse 探险队和起源于 Dark Forest 中文社区的 MarrowDAO，或者价格不高的新平台，如 Oncyber。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ad45ac90-8300-4bc2-be56-fb61b20cbebc.png?height=937&width=1920)\n\n*↑ Metaverse 探险队虚拟旅行进行时，本图由曹寅拍摄。*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17e5bcd6-65cf-4716-a7fa-5547ad1264cf.png?height=892&width=1802)\n\n*↑ Oncyber 的主页，艺术家和收藏家可以选择免费模板展示 NFT。*\n\n未来几个月，以太坊二层将出现更多重前端、兼顾社交属性的新产品，解决这类长尾需求。\n\n## IP 类 NFT 从扎推涌入到受到质疑\n\n上一轮 NFT 热潮中，Flow 生态的 NBA Top Shot 荣登交易量榜首，带动不少体育类IP 进入 NFT 收藏品领域，如 MLB Topps 进入 WAX 生态；与此同时，不少圈外IP 也涌入这一领域，先行者收获颇丰。\n\n6月21日，支付宝发售敦煌飞天等两个系列的 NFT，用户通过积分和人民币购买，可在小程序内看到缩略图；截至目前，这些 NFT 不能售卖，媒体争相报道的炒到高价指的是用户在闲鱼自行发布的收购和售卖信息，这类行为没有门槛，亦无实际成交量，目前已被闲鱼禁止。\n\n不同于 CryptoKitties 和 Hashmasks 这类 IP 归属藏家所有的原生加密收藏品，外部 IP 的 NFT 更像是另一种形式的周边，其稀缺度直接受人为因素影响，随时会因为 IP 所有方的需求而随意超发，甚至出现多条链、多个平台的双花现象；从用户角度而言，购买这类加密收藏品 NFT 很难保值，除非是该 NFT 本身拥有更多不可替代的稀缺性。\n\n值得关注的是，一些因为传播广泛的 MEME IP 在这个季度经过 NFT 进行了变现，其中一些拍卖让作品本身有了更多外部的意义。\n\n6月8日，红遍全网的柴犬 MEME 始祖 DOGE，由其日本主人佐藤敦子小姐通过 NFT 平台 Zora 进行系列 NFT 慈善拍卖，拍出单件400万美元的高价。目前，佐藤敦子将部分拍卖收入捐给国际培幼会、世界粮食计划署、日本红十字协会等非营利组织。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/49c3e565-8111-44eb-b53e-341c1018a323.png?height=992&width=1842)\n\n*↑ Doge NFT 的拍卖页面。*\n\n7月12日，财新报道《显影|中国告别比特币“挖矿”》中的一张配图被广泛传播，被一些从业者认为是比特币挖矿产业在中国转折点的象征之一，有人将其铸造成 NFT 记录。在此过程中，一些挂出的高价经过媒体传播后，被很多人误以为侵权者已因此谋利，当事人即将暴富。\n\n然而，随着财新发布《反侵权公告（第45号）》声明，摄影 NFT 一事暂且告一段落。\n\n如果现实主义者们眼里不是只有钱和所谓的暴富，如果对于 NFT 的接受度稍微高一点，这幅作品能透过 NFT 的形式拍卖，造福摄影师、平台和照片中的藏族妇女（*注：尽管本次事件中几乎无人提及这位照片中的主角，但以 Foundation 上已成交的 MEME 摄影作品为例，NFT 拍卖收益一部分属于被拍摄的对象。*）的同时，还能像 Doge NFT 一样，去支持一些相关的公益基金，比如帮助当地的藏族妇女儿童改善生活，或许能让这幅作品有更多的历史意义吧！\n\n总而言之，加密收藏品的消费主力是国外用户，随着国内对加密货币出入金的政策进一步收紧，这种状况很可能长期持续下去。如此一来，NFT 平台在维持现有支付模式下，押注国际化程度不强的国内 IP，或是将主要受众定位为国内用户，恐怕需要在其他方面多下功夫，以达平衡。\n\n## 游戏NFT

的体素搭建上手快、相对简单，对用户配置要求低，手机也可以打开链接进行浏览，但地块稀少，加上少数人囤积居奇，地价同样昂贵。\n近期越来越火的 The Sandbox 虽然支持展示NFT，但本质上仍是 Play to earn 的沙盒游戏模式，用户也无法通过网页直接游览建筑。\n\n对于新进场的第三世界加密艺术家，特别是一些第一次接触加密行业的艺术创作者而言，想要在虚拟世界创建个人展览，只能选择一些加密艺术社区和公益组织，如中国加密艺术收藏家曹寅发起的 Metaverse 探险队和起源于 Dark Forest 中文社区的 MarrowDAO，或者价格不高的新平台，如

也涌入这一领域，先行者收获颇丰。\n\n6月21日，支付宝发售敦煌飞天等两个系列的 NFT，用户通过积分和人民币购买，可在小程序内看到缩略图；截至目前，这些 NFT 不能售卖，媒体争相报道的炒到高价指的是用户在闲鱼自行发布的收购和售卖信息，这类行为没有门槛，亦无实际成交量，目前已被闲鱼禁止。\n\n不同于 CryptoKitties 和 Hashmasks 这类 IP 归属藏家所有的原生加密收藏品，外部 IP 的 NFT 更像是另一种形式的周边，其稀缺度直接受人为因素影响，随时会因为 IP 所有方的需求而随意超发，甚至出现多条链、多个平台的双花现象；从用户角度而言，购买这类加密收藏品 NFT 很难保值，除非是该 NFT 本身拥有更多不可替代的稀缺性。\n\n值得关注的是，一些因为传播广泛的 MEME IP 在这个季度经过 NFT 进行了变现，其中一些拍卖让作品本身有了更多外部的意义。\n\n6月8日，红遍全网的柴犬 MEME 始祖 DOGE，由其日本主人佐藤敦子小姐通过 NFT 平台 Zora 进行系列 NFT 慈善拍卖，拍出单件400万美元的高价。目前，佐藤敦子将部分拍卖收入捐给国际培幼会、世界粮食计划署、日本红十字协会等非营利组织。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/49c3e565-8111-44eb-b53e-341c1018a323.png?height=992&width=1842)\n\n*↑ Doge NFT

一事暂且告一段落。\n\n如果现实主义者们眼里不是只有钱和所谓的暴富，如果对于 NFT 的接受度稍微高一点，这幅作品能透过 NFT 的形式拍卖，造福摄影师、平台和照片中的藏族妇女（*注：尽管本次事件中几乎无人提及这位照片中的主角，但以 Foundation 上已成交的 MEME 摄影作品为例，NFT 拍卖收益一部分属于被拍摄的对象。*）的同时，还能像 Doge NFT 一样，去支持一些相关的公益基金，比如帮助当地的藏族妇女儿童改善生活，或许能让这幅作品有更多的历史意义吧！\n\n总而言之，加密收藏品的消费主力是国外用户，随着国内对加密货币出入金的政策进一步收紧，这种状况很可能长期持续下去。如此一来，NFT 平台在维持现有支付模式下，押注国际化程度不强的国内 IP，或是将主要受众定位为国内用户，恐怕需要在其他方面多下功夫，以达平衡。\n\n## 游戏NFT

This is done by pooling users' funds and socializing the transaction costs of moving those funds between other protocols that generate yield; such as dYdX, AAVE, and Compound. Vaults are like savings accounts for your crypto assets. They route your deposit through strategies that seek out the highest yield available in DeFi.\n\nThis tutorial will focus on how to deposit funds and begin earning a yield using the Yearn v2 Vaults. It will also walk you through completing one of the tasks required to claim the Asset Management Skill and Lending Skill on RabbitHole. ​\n\n## How to deposit assets into a Yearn Vault\n\n### What you will need:\n\n1. A supported web3 wallet.\n2. A supported asset in your wallet on Mainnet Ethereum\n\nI will also assume that you are familiar with approving transactions with your wallet software.\n\nOnce you have everything you need from the list above, we are ready to dive in.\n\n### Step 1. Go to the Yearn Finance vault dashboard and connect your wallet\n\nYou can get to the dashboard by visiting this link: https://yearn.finance/vaults and logging in with one of the wallets shown below.\n\n*Be sure to have your wallet set to the Ethereum Mainnet*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4f5b9356-680e-4d4a-b566-d2675d5bf861.jpeg?height=951&width=1920)\n\n### Step 2. Choose which Value you wish to use and click “Show” \n\nThe list is quite long and is not limited to the ones shown below. You can scroll through and look at the different stats for the Vaults they offer. The Net APY column will show you what the current annualized yield is for that Vault. \n\nWhen you’ve chosen a Vault click the “SHOW” button beside it on the list. \n\n*Be aware that this APY can change dramatically over time*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fed6a917-bf3a-46a8-a683-066609da751b.jpeg?height=853&width=1237)\n\n### Step 3. Choose the asset and amount you wish to deposit and click “Deposit”\n\nYearn has a feature called Zap that allows you to deposit any asset they support and it will convert it to the correct asset for the Vault you chose while depositing. You just need to select the asset from the dropdown menu and then enter the amount in the box to the right of it. \n\nIn the image below I have chosen the GRT (that I received from a previous RabbitHole Quest), but you can choose any asset from the list. Then click “Deposit”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bb690b33-f214-469d-bfb6-69da0a6fc287.jpeg?height=552&width=1203)\n\n### Step 4. Monitor your Vault(s)\n\nAfter both transactions are approved you will see that the value you deposited appears in the holdings column of the asset list, as well as under the \"Withdraw...\" heading beside “Vault Balance:” If you wish to remove your funds at any time you can enter the amount and click “Withdraw”. You also have the ability to use the Zap feature to convert the token into a different one while you're withdrawing it. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e2d0326b-5dc0-40eb-96f8-58d68ba7be12.jpeg?height=537&width=1245)\n\n## Redeem the Task on RabbitHole\n\nOnce you have deposited assets into a Vault you can go back to the RabbitHole Task and click the “Redeem” button. You will get the XP and you will have completed a Task required to claim TWO Skills on the platform. Congratulations on becoming a more experienced QuestRabbit!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3bdff5be-513b-43b2-99d9-903f3736b91b.jpeg?height=422&width=1570)\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1628495348, "digest": "_p9UJ3GrRQgH_ukPpfWbwRP_NMMOUnawoEiWxDTRZ9k", "contributor": "0x8926B75642C2650aE3c5b227bAD2F7158ceaCCD1"}
