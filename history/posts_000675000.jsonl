It happened in 1747, when James Lind ran a controlled scientific study — maybe the first ever — and discovered that citrus fruits cured scurvy. \n\nIn Lind’s day, scurvy killed more British sailors than \"shipwreck, storms, all other diseases, **and enemy action combined**”. Which is to say that Lind's cure was not just going to save countless lives; it was an incomparably powerful *military technology*. The stakes couldn't have been higher. And yet, despite having been proven with the most advanced scientific methods the world had ever seen, **it was promptly lost** for many decades after. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/336e837a-bf15-493c-a3fd-c6703670af85.jpeg?height=512&width=1254)\n\nAccording to British Historian [C.C. Lloyd](https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/hemila/history/Lloyd_1963.pdf), the British might have “lost the American War of Independence thirty years [after Lind’s study] because his cure was not adopted”. If Lloyd’s suggestion is correct, the discounted net assets of America is what gives you a roughly $1,000,000,000,000 bill that the British may have just left lying on the ground.\n\nWe will return to why and how this happened later. But for now let’s just observe that **the incentives for the production and dissemination of scientific truths are often really, really poor.** And so, as a result, humanity can lose even the most consequential truth. \n\n## Enter NFTs\n\nThe idea that NFTs could help rescue trillion dollar scientific truths from obscurity might strike you as a little fanciful. You might even be might be thinking... \"aren't NFTs just some hyped-up blockchain art thing? Why should they help science funding at all?\" So to start with let's take the simplest argument, and here we'll just quote it from our [2018 essay on NFTs for Science](https://glyphx.medium.com/post-venture-capital-and-the-crypto-nobel-prize-29847faf3f08):\n\n> Historically, great knowledge is valued like great art. Bill Gates paid $40 million for Leonardo Da Vinci’s Codex Leicester. Einstein’s manuscripts sell for millions. And a single page of Darwin’s writing fetches hundreds of thousands of dollars[...] People buy Darwin’s original pages because they are connected to his idea — the fact that information from The Origin of Species is freely available is not a bug for its high value; it’s a feature. Today’s Darwin would type The Origin of the Species in a Google Doc or a versioned LaTeX file... But now with Planck, and the digital scarcity blockchain enables, she would create a unique Glyph [NFT] that serves as that first manuscript copy.\n\nWe believe that this \"science as art\" argument is just the beginning, and so Planck has been testing ways in which funds and proceeds from NFTs can be channeled to improve science funding more broadly. The aim, ultimately, is to enable progress and to try to help save some of the consequential ideas we might otherwise lose.\n\nWithin this essay we are auctioning off an NFT as a small  test of the SplitStream, and incentive design for funding science through citations. To explain, let us first outline the project this NFT is a part of. Last month, after designing and crowdsourcing the first ever randomized control test of a long-untested theory, Planck sold the (publicly shared) result as [the first science NFT for $24,000](https://twitter.com/stephensonhmatt/status/1377316537950932992). These funds will help us run a replication of the study we ran. Here is something nice that a very smart person said about the project:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3a5983a6-915e-4fa7-997c-3a8a8c47a3db.jpeg?height=742&width=1178)\n\nBecause we are interested in incentives for consequential ideas that it seemed possible we might lose, we looked for a promising candidate for the test. The most promising candidate we found was the late Berkeley Professor Seth Roberts' appetite theory.\n\n## Testing Seth Roberts' Appetite Theory\n\nIn 2004, Berkeley Professor Seth Roberts discovered that consuming flavorless calories reduced his appetite. Consuming flavorless or unfamiliar calories made his eating habits more consciously controllable and helped him lose weight. And beyond weight loss, such a tool for conscious eating seemed to have the potential to help people eat more nutritious food, more easily go vegan, etc. Though preliminary, it was an enormous discovery.\n\nSeth was a serious empirical scientist and the [evidence he published for his theory was intriguing, if unorthodox](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866). But some very credible sources recognized the merit of his work and he was featured positively in the [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/magazine/does-the-truth-lie-within.html). His book became a bestseller. \n\nGlowing anecdotes appeared, including [a notable one from Reddit co-founder Aaron Swartz](https://5shz4jubhf5ju22lobejiotjv36et7td242q7nz6tx3puyuilcba.arweave.net/7I-eJoE5epprS3BIlDpprvxJ_mPXNQ-3Pp32-mKIWII). In that essay, Swartz confidently alludes to the \"clinical trials\" that would surely be carried out on Seth's Theory. **His essential optimism, his confidence that the world would obviously figure out a way to run a clinical test on something so promising, is striking**. \n\nBut the lab studies never came.\n\nWithin 5 years of its publication Seth’s idea had become little-discussed, never having undergone a single clinical trial. Some important outlets like [Marginal Revolution](https://zt3lipqi5yc4exoyclfunv7v2ws7hdmfmx6aeczs4hi2fzsgpaja.arweave.net/zPa0PgjuBcJd2BLLRtf11aXzjYVl_AILMuHRouZGeBI) [LessWrong](https://44zxnconwtyyk4ulw3bmvfq5fl5eeeyjft5yltiq3fdrsrt7kxqa.arweave.net/5zN2ic208YVyi7bCypYdKvpCEwks-4XNENlHGUZ_VeA), and [StatModeling](https://sbwt4p5ujwzqpk3543m24cn7wgrgrpmzvhcmg4u6fmpnkf55v2nq.arweave.net/kG0-P7RNswerfebZrgm_saJovZmpxMNynise1Re9rps) kept the flame alive, but the discussion of Seth's theory all but vanishes:\n\n![Google Searches for Seth Roberts' Theory over time](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/27863775-b21c-4641-a1c3-dd9a6ad63131.jpeg?height=664&width=2284)\n\nBy 2017, a few years after Seth had passed away, Neurobiologist Stephan Guyenet wrote that he expected to remain forever “puzzled” by Seth’s theory because “some sort of research” on it was “unlikely to ever happen.” Stephan’s answer reads more than a bit tragic; obesity kills [millions each year](https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/6-facts-on-obesity), interest in using conscious eating to help improve the world, as in vegetarianism, is skyrocketing. Failing to follow up on a promising theory in such a world feels a bit like an echo of our tragic failure to follow up on James Lind's scurvy cure. \n\n## Why Do We Lose Ideas?\n\n> \"Show me the incentive and I'll show you the result.\" - Charlie Munger\n\nJames Lind's scurvy cure [didn't mesh well with the science of 1747](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312313920). Science was then 150 years away from discovering vitamins and so, naturally, it would have been hard to understand how it was the vitamin C in citrus that was the cure. The top minds of the day, viewing Lind's results, quickly came to believe that the acid in the juice must be melting some big black scurvy blob that sailors got in their stomachs. \"Great!\" they said, \"let's boil the juice to make it more acidic and work even better!\"\n\nUnfortunately, as we now understand, boiling the juice just destroys the Vitamin C content. Which means the boiled \"cure\" was no cure at all. Now there is nothing wrong about this; it's just good old normal science seeking understanding and trying out hypotheses. And 150 years later this did give us understanding, and that understanding was bigger than a simple cure for scurvy. The problem is that **somehow for the intervening 150 years everyone didn't just go back to using the limes that were proven to work**. \n\nIf Seth’s Theory proves out I think the story will be much the same as Lind's. Theories, like those of Seth Roberts and James Lind, which happen to integrate poorly with existing science of their day are bound to suffer. By failing to integrate into science they lose out on what is surely humanity's best protocol for rewarding, preserving, and developing openly shared knowledge. Patents might offer an alternative, but Seth's and Lind's theories were also hopelessly unpatentable. Citrus fruits are freely available and \"flavorless calories\" are easier to come by still; like a good scientist, Seth even set about demonstrating that a person could just [hold their nose](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/shangrila-diet-phenomenol_b_58958) as they ate and get the desired effect. Good luck writing that patent. \n\n## Demonstrating How NFTs can Help Fund Unpatentable Science\n\nWhen we first wrote about using NFTs as a unique way to fund science, Seth's was one of the major motivating cases. Here's how the simplest mechanism was intended to help fund such research:\n\n1. NFTs of high-potential scientific work are sold\n2. These NFTs, like a collectible, could grow in stature and value as the scientific work was validated\n3. Prospective NFT sales of early scientific results could thereby profitably fund the validation of that research\n\nAs mentioned earlier, our current project is bearing this out: Planck crowdsourced the first ever randomized control trial of Seth Roberts' appetite theory, sold an NFT of the result, and are now using the proceeds to run an independent lab replication of the findings. \n\nIt's important to keep in mind the bigger picture here though. We hope Seth's theory is true (who wouldn't?), but our fundamental concern regards the incentives themselves. To become a full-fledged scientific truth a theory needs to be exposed to falsification. So it's worth remembering that, while our preliminary results on Seth's Theory are promising, every step along the journey is important, as are the incentives to take those steps.\n\nIn this essay, we are introducing a novel incentive structure for scientific funding that uses citations as a channel for funding. We were calling this a \"CitationStream\" but piggybacking on [Jon-Kyle's terminology in his excellent essay](https://jk.mirror.xyz/3iLll7F39DjeVlJo4XNlfunl-C0xD3l2X8sjIJoB9vc), we are going to call it a “SplitStream”. The SplitStream is a system in which portions of an NFT sale may flow to some or all of the works the NFT cites, with those cited works then sending some of their funds further along to the works they cite, and so on. \n\n## The SplitStream\n\nYou might know the quote “If I have seen further, it is from standing on the shoulders of giants”. You might also know that it’s from Isaac Newton, a giant if there ever was one. So **in science, giants tend to look down and see other giants**. Citations, when they work, map those dependencies backwards through time. \n\nCitations on citations. \n\nGiants all the way down.\n\nIf you send funds through these citations, you get a cascade. A stream of splits. A SplitStream. \n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9dfd5cba-c828-461c-b0d5-2be765a465bb.jpeg?height=684&width=592)\n\nWe are running a test of this today as we help auction off an NFT of an independent data analysis of Seth’s Appetite Theory. The analysis was conducted by two esteemed professors of statistics, Harry Crane and Ryan Martin, and thus the NFT is theirs with proceeds directed according to them. \n\nAs a part of this independent analysis we were able to demo a powerful cryptographic technology from [Aleo](https://www.aleo.org/) which we believe will be very useful to further open science. We used a Zero-knowledge Proof in Leo to enable the statisticians to effectively \"query\" our dataset and see certain results without revealing the data itself. Because we are still learning how to use Leo (and because we will share the dataset publicly anyway!) we demonstrated this tech on a subset of results and outside the demo further tests were run.\n\nIndependent Analysis is a really valuable thing, and it is a [cutting edge Open Science best practice](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646). \nThus we value Harry and Ryan's contributions greatly and have requested that they keep 50% of the NFT sale. They have also agreed to test the SplitStream and for the purposes of this incentive test, their analysis “cites” two NFTs:\n\nThe NFT of the Open Science Test of Seth’s Appetite Theory (currently owned by [Molecule](https://opensea.io/accounts/Molecule_to))\nThe NFT of this Essay Outlining the Protocol (owned by Planck) \n\nPlanck will then split our proceeds further to what we are citing:\n1. Mirror because we are using their amazing platform and tech. \n2. [This Artwork is Always on Sale](https://thisartworkisalwaysonsale.com/), suggested by Simon De La Rouvier as the proper target for the citation of his shared idea of Harberger taxes for NFT ownership (which is an important aspect of our protocol.)\n\nWe encourage the recipients of these proceeds, if they are at all substantial, to split back to those they would cite. Let's also note that this is a simple test of the mechanism and certainly does not represent the full range of actual citations we would use. Here is their NFT, an elegant violin plot of the results from the study we ran:\n\n[Token #2837](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2837)\n\n## Design Challenges for the SplitStream\n\nAs a trained academic, I could hardly discuss a mechanism like the SplitStream without noting some potential pitfalls. Properly done, this has great potential to reward an effective division of labor in for open science and more. But it does not create obligations, or promises, or contracts, or anything like that. Participants are playing, roughly speaking, [a live trust game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PO3MTV0ZeA).\n\nAnd in fact, these incentives cannot become too enshrined and formal because citations are a fragile system. **A person’s inspiration is purely their private knowledge and thus it *must* be shared voluntarily.** A system which can't elicit honest attributions will fail.\n\nFor example, you could imagine that many people might appreciate being credited as the essential inspiration for a new Nobel-prize winning discovery in physics. Someone with sufficient resources, some prestige-hungry Jeff Bezos, might even be willing to pay for that honor. And then, of course, there’s nothing to stop our Nobel-winning physicist from claiming that her passing conversation with the dear leader Bezos was the fundamental inspiration for everything. Who could say otherwise? This sort of thing is absolutely going to happen sometimes, just as it sometimes happens in academia. \n\nI’m going to call these types of behaviors “Mao effects”: the seeking of favor from those with status or power by over-attributing to them. Mao of course was named the “great helmsman”, the “great leader”, etc. and anything good that happened was often attributed to him. **A network overtaken by these Mao effects breaks down, a Ponzi-scheme for those who claim complete originality.**\n\nIn an evolutionary simulation it roughly looks like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3ba8b293-998f-4069-8c0c-d95e7ea9d006.jpeg?height=850&width=1100)\n\nThese effects can get more subtle as well. I can’t do much more here than sort of gesture at this and signal that I take these ideas seriously (e.g. [I actually coauthored a Behavioral Economics literature review called “When Do Monetary Incentives Backfire”](https://vr24zefnxcqg7hctadpx7dzmv3zq64oqodfcaiv2zwskewovtlna.arweave.net/rHXMkK24oG-cUwDff48srvMPcdBwyiAius2kolnVmto)). But a simple step toward preventing Mao Effects is observing the following two rules:\n\n1. Favor citing things which are publicly shared.\n2. Favor citing things which also cite. \n\nThe first condition helps provide a level of transparency and sense-making to the system. So, for instance, you can understand why I cite Mirror because you can clearly see that I'm using their tech. The second condition helps ensure that cited works offer further attribution to the work they've built on. Together these rules help ensure that a would-be Mao openly shares their knowledge while also citing that which contributed to it.\n\n## The Big Picture: Seeking the \"civil society patch\" for Internet Technology\n\nIn the preceding sections, we’ve discussed the ways in which Web3 might enable the sharing and preservation of ideas. It only seems fitting to close this discussion with a small, highly speculative idea of our own.\n\nThe First Industrial Revolution (“IR 1”) is the famous one, occurring a little before the year 1800. It connected people with railroads and steamships and yet, despite its fame, it brought almost no growth:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4b4f3c30-d00a-45f7-96fa-8d3429446746.jpeg?height=335&width=600)\n\nInstead, it took many decades until anyone saw the “big bang” wave of growth that we learned about in grade school, the one that ushered in the modern world. \n\n**This big bang growth actually appeared alongside a second wave of major inventions, quite distinct from the inventions of IR 1.** Whereas IR 1 brought us together with connecting inventions like the steam engine, the second wave had the great livability innovations in areas like heating, sanitation, electric lights, elevators, motion pictures, etc.\n\nThe IR 1 world was a newly connected one, but it was also polluted and dangerous and kind of miserable. And we didn’t actually produce much growth all huddled together, drinking dirty water and breathing fumes. But then, once we figured out how to make this newly connected world more livable and pleasant, things got vastly better. Only then did we get the growth explosion that the Industrial Revolution is famous for.\n\nIn this light then, rather than seeing the second wave of inventions as an IR 2, we might see them as the civil society patch: IR 1.1. Before the patch it just wasn't that pleasant to all live together but after the patch, suddenly, it wasn't so bad. \n\nWhat if the same thing is true now? You can read [top economists today pondering over the stagnant growth and missing productivity of the internet era](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691147727/the-rise-and-fall-of-american-growth) dating back to the 1970s. But so too might an economist during IR 1.0 have puzzled over the missing productivity that the steam engine should have wrought. What if today’s economists are wrong for the same reasons — what if the internet is indeed revolutionary and we just haven't gotten the 2.1 patch?\n\nThe internet brought our minds together in a great network to rival the 19th century network of railways and steamships. If this 1800s network could take you to undeniably thrilling — but also crowded and disgusting — cities, perhaps the internet too feels a bit like this now. It's thrilling but awful, alluring but somehow inhumane. And so some optimism is available in the story of the 19th century, and the fact that *its* network showed a lot of promise but failed to deliver for a very long time until, suddenly, it did.\n\nLet’s dare to hope that an even greater change awaits us once we figure out how to live and think together online. Structuring, rewarding, and preserving promising ideas seems like a step in the right direction. \n", "timestamp": 1619554185, "digest": "vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg", "contributor": "0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6", "nft": "{\"nftTransactionHash\": \"0xa7d518b7a12a005c4941a88709349ace127f2e37efa3467a7ddef9b7ffa6a852\"}"}

Theories, like those of Seth Roberts and James Lind, which happen to integrate poorly with existing science of their day are bound to suffer. By failing to integrate into science they lose out on what is surely humanity's best protocol for rewarding, preserving, and developing openly shared knowledge. Patents might offer an alternative, but Seth's and Lind's theories were also hopelessly unpatentable. Citrus fruits are freely available and \"flavorless calories\" are easier to come by still; like a good scientist, Seth even set about demonstrating that a person could just [hold their nose](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/shangrila-diet-phenomenol_b_58958) as they ate and get the desired effect. Good luck writing that patent. \n\n## Demonstrating How NFTs can Help Fund Unpatentable Science\n\nWhen we first wrote about using NFTs as a unique way to fund science, Seth's was one of the major motivating cases. Here's how the simplest mechanism was intended to help fund such research:\n\n1. NFTs of high-potential scientific work are sold\n2. These NFTs, like a collectible, could grow in stature and value as the scientific work was validated\n3. Prospective NFT sales of early scientific results could thereby profitably fund the validation of that research\n\nAs mentioned earlier, our current project is bearing this out: Planck crowdsourced the first ever randomized control trial of Seth Roberts' appetite theory, sold an NFT of the result, and are now using the proceeds to run an independent lab replication of the findings. \n\nIt's important to keep in mind the bigger picture here though. We hope Seth's theory is true (who wouldn't?), but our fundamental concern regards the incentives themselves. To become a full-fledged scientific truth a theory needs to be exposed to falsification. So it's worth remembering that, while our preliminary results on Seth's Theory are promising, every step along the journey is important, as are the incentives to take those steps.\n\nIn this essay, we are introducing a novel incentive structure for scientific funding that uses citations as a channel for funding. We were calling this a \"CitationStream\" but piggybacking on [Jon-Kyle's terminology in his excellent essay](https://jk.mirror.xyz/3iLll7F39DjeVlJo4XNlfunl-C0xD3l2X8sjIJoB9vc), we are going to call it a “SplitStream”. The SplitStream is a system in which portions of an NFT sale may flow to some or all of the works the NFT cites, with those cited works then sending some of their funds further along to the works they cite, and so on. \n\n## The SplitStream\n\nYou might know the quote “If I have seen further, it is from standing on the shoulders of giants”. You might also know that it’s from Isaac Newton, a giant if there ever was one. So **in science, giants tend to look down and see other giants**. Citations, when they work, map those dependencies backwards through time. \n\nCitations on citations. \n\nGiants all the way down.\n\nIf you send funds through these citations, you get a cascade. A stream of splits. A SplitStream. \n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9dfd5cba-c828-461c-b0d5-2be765a465bb.jpeg?height=684&width=592)\n\nWe are running a test of this today as we help auction off an NFT of an independent data analysis of Seth’s Appetite Theory. The analysis was conducted by two esteemed professors of statistics, Harry Crane and Ryan Martin, and thus the NFT is theirs with proceeds directed according to them. \n\nAs a part of this independent analysis we were able to demo a powerful cryptographic technology from [Aleo](https://www.aleo.org/) which we believe will be very useful to further open science. We used a Zero-knowledge Proof in Leo to enable the statisticians to effectively \"query\" our dataset and see certain results without revealing the data itself. Because we are still learning how to use Leo (and because we will share the dataset publicly anyway!) we demonstrated this tech on a subset of results and outside the demo further tests were run.\n\nIndependent Analysis is a really valuable thing, and it is a [cutting edge Open Science best practice](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646). \nThus we value Harry and Ryan's contributions greatly and have requested that they keep 50% of the NFT sale. They have also agreed to test the SplitStream and for the purposes of this incentive test, their analysis “cites” two NFTs:\n\nThe NFT of the Open Science Test of Seth’s Appetite Theory (currently owned by [Molecule](https://opensea.io/accounts/Molecule_to))\nThe NFT of this Essay Outlining the Protocol (owned by Planck) \n\nPlanck will then split our proceeds further to what we are citing:\n1. Mirror because we are using their amazing platform and tech. \n2. [This Artwork is Always on Sale](https://thisartworkisalwaysonsale.com/), suggested by Simon De La Rouvier as the proper target for the citation of his shared idea of Harberger taxes for NFT ownership (which is an important aspect of our protocol.)\n\nWe encourage the recipients of these proceeds, if they are at all substantial, to split back to those they would cite. Let's also note that this is a simple test of the mechanism and certainly does not represent the full range of actual citations we would use. Here is their NFT, an elegant violin plot of the results from the study we ran:\n\n[Token #2837](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2837)\n\n## Design Challenges for the SplitStream\n\nAs a trained academic, I could hardly discuss a mechanism like the SplitStream without noting some potential pitfalls. Properly done, this has great potential to reward an effective division of labor in for open science and more. But it does not create obligations, or promises, or contracts, or anything like that. Participants are playing, roughly speaking, [a live trust game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PO3MTV0ZeA).\n\nAnd in fact, these incentives cannot become too enshrined and formal because citations are a fragile system. **A person’s inspiration is purely their private knowledge and thus it *must* be shared voluntarily.** A system which can't elicit honest attributions will fail.\n\nFor example, you could imagine that many people might appreciate being credited as the essential inspiration for a new Nobel-prize winning discovery in physics. Someone with sufficient resources, some prestige-hungry Jeff Bezos, might even be willing to pay for that honor. And then, of course, there’s nothing to stop our Nobel-winning physicist from claiming that her passing conversation with the dear leader Bezos was the fundamental inspiration for everything. Who could say otherwise? This sort of thing is absolutely going to happen sometimes, just as it sometimes happens in academia. \n\nI’m going to call these types of behaviors “Mao effects”: the seeking of favor from those with status or power by over-attributing to them. Mao of course was named the “great helmsman”, the “great leader”, etc. and anything good that happened was often attributed to him. **A network overtaken by these Mao effects breaks down, a Ponzi-scheme for those who claim complete originality.**\n\nIn an evolutionary simulation it roughly looks like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3ba8b293-998f-4069-8c0c-d95e7ea9d006.jpeg?height=850&width=1100)\n\nThese effects can get more subtle as well. I can’t do much more here than sort of gesture at this and signal that I take these ideas seriously (e.g. [I actually coauthored a Behavioral Economics literature review called “When Do Monetary Incentives Backfire”](https://vr24zefnxcqg7hctadpx7dzmv3zq64oqodfcaiv2zwskewovtlna.arweave.net/rHXMkK24oG-cUwDff48srvMPcdBwyiAius2kolnVmto)). But a simple step toward preventing Mao Effects is observing the following two rules:\n\n1. Favor citing things which are publicly shared.\n2. Favor citing things which also cite. \n\nThe first condition helps provide a level of transparency and sense-making to the system. So, for instance, you can understand why I cite Mirror because you can clearly see that I'm using their tech. The second condition helps ensure that cited works offer further attribution to the work they've built on. Together these rules help ensure that a would-be Mao openly shares their knowledge while also citing that which contributed to it.\n\n## The Big Picture: Seeking the \"civil society patch\" for Internet Technology\n\nIn the preceding sections, we’ve discussed the ways in which Web3 might enable the sharing and preservation of ideas. It only seems fitting to close this discussion with a small, highly speculative idea of our own.\n\nThe First Industrial Revolution (“IR 1”) is the famous one, occurring a little before the year 1800. It connected people with railroads and steamships and yet, despite its fame, it brought almost no growth:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4b4f3c30-d00a-45f7-96fa-8d3429446746.jpeg?height=335&width=600)\n\nInstead, it took many decades until anyone saw the “big bang” wave of growth that we learned about in grade school, the one that ushered in the modern world. \n\n**This big bang growth actually appeared alongside a second wave of major inventions, quite distinct from the inventions of IR 1.** Whereas IR 1 brought us together with connecting inventions like the steam engine, the second wave had the great livability innovations in areas like heating, sanitation, electric lights, elevators, motion pictures, etc.\n\nThe IR 1 world was a newly connected one, but it was also polluted and dangerous and kind of miserable. And we didn’t actually produce much growth all huddled together, drinking dirty water and breathing fumes. But then, once we figured out how to make this newly connected world more livable and pleasant, things got vastly better. Only then did we get the growth explosion that the Industrial Revolution is famous for.\n\nIn this light then, rather than seeing the second wave of inventions as an IR 2, we might see them as the civil society patch: IR 1.1. Before the patch it just wasn't that pleasant to all live together but after the patch, suddenly, it wasn't so bad. \n\nWhat if the same thing is true now? You can read [top economists today pondering over the stagnant growth and missing productivity of the internet era](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691147727/the-rise-and-fall-of-american-growth) dating back to the 1970s. But so too might an economist during IR 1.0 have puzzled over the missing productivity that the steam engine should have wrought. What if today’s economists are wrong for the same reasons — what if the internet is indeed revolutionary and we just haven't gotten the 2.1 patch?\n\nThe internet brought our minds together in a great network to rival the 19th century network of railways and steamships. If this 1800s network could take you to undeniably thrilling — but also crowded and disgusting — cities, perhaps the internet too feels a bit like this now. It's thrilling but awful, alluring but somehow inhumane. And so some optimism is available in the story of the 19th century, and the fact that *its* network showed a lot of promise but failed to deliver for a very long time until, suddenly, it did.\n\nLet’s dare to hope that an even greater change awaits us once we figure out how to live and think together online. Structuring, rewarding, and preserving promising ideas seems like a step in the right direction. \n", "timestamp": 1619554443, "digest": "vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg", "contributor": "0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6", "nft": "{\"nftTransactionHash\": \"0xa7d518b7a12a005c4941a88709349ace127f2e37efa3467a7ddef9b7ffa6a852\"}"}

Web3 communities will take the intrinsic mechanisms of Web2 and meld them with extrinsic incentives,*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/57f2ec24-4ce0-48f4-92ee-bd55c0b41b99.png?height=146&width=312)\n\nWe have in the past discussed how the blockchain concept of a ‘decentralized autonomous organization’ (DAO) might apply to groups of people who want to make stuff. We called this theoretical format a ‘Creator DAO.’ In this paradigm, a team or community interested in making something would implement a smart contract according to which tokens in the project would be granted to contributors, customers or investors, in return for their labor or money. \n\nFor example, a group of people who wanted to design a line of shoes might sell tokens in their project to people who believed in their vision. These tokens would bestow several privileges on their holders. They might provide token-holders with discounted pricing and/or priority access to the project’s product. They could give token-holders the ability to vote on shoe designs or other project decisions. They might even provide token-holders with a share of profits when such exist. And of course, the tokens could be sold to other people for profit, if as a result of the success of the project the value of the token increased. In addition to cash, tokens might be earned through work on the project. Designers, marketers, manufacturing and financial experts could be awarded tokens in return for their involvement in the shoe project. Even smaller contributions, like helping a social campaign go viral or providing survey feedback on packaging, could result in token grants. \n\nSo how is this different from crowdfunding like Kickstarter or membership platforms like Patreon? These three frameworks have plenty in common, most importantly, the goal of making it possible for more people to make stuff. But the main difference that a Creator DAO provides is the notion of ownership. You are not simply *supporting* a project. Through the token, you *possess* a piece of it. And, within the rules of its smart contract, are free to use the token as you want. You can sell it, stake it, fractionalize it, include it in an index, take advantage of all of the liquidity-enhancing mechanisms DeFi enables. In other words, with a CreatorDAO, in addition to wanting to help people make stuff because you like the stuff they’ll make, you get financial incentives. You are an investor. A true owner.\n\nSo then how is it different from traditional investing? Again, there’s plenty of similarities here too. Investors own parts of businesses, and depending on the terms and size of their ownership, can vote on issues affecting the company, receive dividends, and at some point, sell their share. The difference is the more fluid and flexible nature of a token. Most companies don’t sell shares to the public until fairly late in their evolution given the transaction, regulatory and coordination costs associated with going public. Meanwhile, private company shares are difficult to sell, generally locked up, either by contract or practical reality, for years. Tokens are typically issued early if not at the beginning of a project. They can and do sell whenever the owner desires. And the potential use-cases are as broad as the creators can imagine. It’s slow and expensive, for instance, to reward a small contribution to a traditional company with an equity grant. But tokens make it easy and inexpensive. You’d never have a special shoe design available only to private equity investors. There wouldn’t be enough of them for that to be worthwhile. With tokens, it makes perfect sense.\n\nPut another way, in order to engage as many people as possible as deeply as possible, Creator DAOs intertwine two kinds of motivations that are usually seen as far apart: social and financial. A ‘traditional’ content website, for example, would never consider its investors and community members in the same way, or try to provide them with a single currency as reward for their distinct kinds of participation. Which isn’t to say that pre-DAO creators didn’t recognize the need to reward their users. They definitely (and increasingly) did. They just envisioned it as an entirely different system of incentives, running parallel to but disconnected from those of its investors. Or perhaps more accurately, subordinate to the company’s financial system. If you think about it, a major feature of the most successful Web 2.0 products was precisely this: the creation of currencies that were valued but weren’t directly financial. Remember ‘gamification?’ Likes, follows, friends and badges -- all so central to the social web we barely notice anymore that all of these were inventions designed to incentivize free labor. In many ways, this has been the core focus of the last few decades of consumer Internet.\n\n**Web2: Tapping Intrinsic Incentives**\n\nWhen The Huffington Post looked to grow participation on their [platform in 2010](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/introducing-huffpost-badg_b_557168), they introduced the behavior of **badging**. Seemingly simple, badging was responsible for the growth of The Huffington Post over any other participatory tool or tactic because the intrinsic benefits tied to the community’s status and identity encouraged engagement on platform and off. The more a community member participated in set tasks, the more benefits they unlocked. \n\nThis entire process started in the comments section. To encourage healthy discourse and increased engagement, users were tasked to moderate and direct conversations. This action was rewarded with a **moderator badge**. This moderator badge gave individuals permission to fully moderate discourse across all articles and be featured as commenters. There were other badges as well they gave additional benefits. For example, [the **pundits badge**](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/huffpost-pundits-badge_b_691473) gave individual’s the ability to have their comments highlighted in multiple arenas, as well as the ability to leave longer comments. This made the community conversations starters. It was an engine to The Huffington Post’s growth. It benefitted The Huffington Post by keeping good conversation and discourse on their platform, thus growing their page views, revenue and market share. \n\nThis was done only by tapping intrinsic incentives, by enabling users to ‘earn’ within a status economy that existed only inside the website. Individuals wanted to better their reputation as a commenter or contributor and the platform enabled that. For a while, it worked incredibly well. But there was an obvious and inherent contradiction. If the Huffington Post was getting more *financially* valuable, and a major reason for that increase were the massive contributions of its motivated community, why were the members paid only in badges and not in money? When HuffPo sold to AOL, the investors got rich, the community got nothing.\n\n**Web3: Adding Extrinsic Incentives**\n\nA HuffPo based on fungible tokens, instead of badges, could have had a different outcome. The earliest and most active contributors could have been paid when the company was purchased. In fact, they could have been selling their $HUFF tokens for other valuable assets all along. Those who held on to them or bought more might even have blocked the sale. More likely, it would have evolved into an entirely different product.\n\nSo maybe the more interesting way to think about Creator DAOs is not in how they would change the products and companies we already know and rather what totally new creations they might make possible. By broadening the motivations for someone to assist early-stage and/or independent creators, Creator DAOs open up new opportunities outside of existing businesses and infrastructures. \n\nConsider local news, a market which is essential to the functioning of our real-world communities but which has become almost impossible for entrepreneurs and investors. One effort taking a different approach to this mission is *The Devil Strip* in Akron, Ohio. Faced with a need for capital as well as a commitment to deeply engage its readership, this arts and culture magazine is being structured as a co-op. Readers and workers own *The Devil Strip*:\n\n[“That means we are locally owned in the truest sense: Readers can become shareholders in *The Devil Strip*. Being a shareholder means your voice will shape the future of our publication, as long as you have an Ohio address. (We cannot yet offer shares out of state for legal reasons, but we welcome donations from our friends everywhere!)”](https://thedevilstrip.com/co-op/)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/68530646-5b52-41c5-9f87-23328aeea39a.png?height=233&width=646)\n\nEven though it’s not often employed in media, at least not yet, the co-op structure is well-established and widely-used in all sorts of contexts. *The Devil Strip* can lean on generations of practical lessons and law from the co-op world. There’s every indication that it’ll work. But might this project work better as a Creator DAO?\n\nThere are two big advantages to Creator DAOs and tokens: liquidity and functionality. Not unlike crowdfunding, a co-op share has no financial incentive. You can’t sell it or use it to make money. That’s not necessarily a problem. It may even be a feature. There may be enough people in Akron who want the magazine so much that they are willing to fund it strictly based on that desire. Or based on the social benefits of being recognized as supportive members. And the lack of a profit motive may incentivize the collective to focus more on public benefit. But it’s possible there would be significantly more potential funders of the *The Devil Strip*, making better long term decisions, if those intrinsic motivations were intertwined with extrinsic ones. \n\nThe main question to ask is: Do we want shareholder’s to profit from their investment? It’s not a simple question. What makes a Creator DAO significantly different than, say, a media co-op is that the options for the latter are limited when it comes to whether and how they make money from their investment. Tokens enable fractionalization and staking, all utilities for individuals to either leverage or liquidate their ownership asset. This makes a token share of something worth more than a co-op share, even if they have the same governance and utility benefits. Tokens also enable indexing. We can imagine an index fund or on-chain investment club that invests in Creator DAOs all over the country, providing more reliable funding for projects like *The Devil Strip*. In short, token holders are incentivized financially to increase the value of their holdings and to scale such holdings. As such, one way to think about a Creator DAO is as a profit-motivated community, combining the profit and social incentives in one. \n\nMuch of our social and financial structures have been designed to incentivize contribution and reward participation and coordination. Incentive mechanisms have always been critical to build a healthy, highly participatory community of any kind. But historically, these systems and incentive mechanisms have been fractured and separate across spheres. We’ve had political systems for organizing participation in mass movements. We’ve had corporations and other financial structures for organizing participation in business endeavors. And we’ve had status systems for organizing participation in social activities. DAO’s potentially combine all of these structures at once. The mission of DAOs is to have everyone who can be helpful be a part of the collective, and therefore to have a suitable reward for every potential contributor. To do so, they combine financial incentives with social status and political representation. DAOs in effect, provide a brand new OS for participation. \n\nAnd like an OS, they enable creations that could never have been anticipated. So when thinking about Creator DAOs forget about the structures that currently exist today. Beginner’s mindset is a critical attribute to how we evolve our thinking and our products, and presenting a new paradigm to how things could be architected will not just evolve our current models but create entirely new ones for us to leverage and explore. Yes, we can port over the ‘rules and roles’ from journalism or shoe design and theorize how they can work within a DAO framework. But that limits the opportunity that the DAO introduces. It’s not about creating old stuff with a DAO.’ It’s about ‘the new stuff a DAO allows us to create.\n\n", "timestamp": 1619629732, "digest": "Tf9IS6yNxtPXwC5mmfi_UISe8v6BOfef2bDmQSxoJao", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

It’s not a simple question. What makes a Creator DAO significantly different than, say, a media co-op is that the options for the latter are limited when it comes to whether and how they make money from their investment. Tokens enable fractionalization and staking, all utilities for individuals to either leverage or liquidate their ownership asset. This makes a token share of something worth more than a co-op share, even if they have the same governance and utility benefits. Tokens also enable indexing. We can imagine an index fund or on-chain investment club that invests in Creator DAOs all over the country, providing more reliable funding for projects like *The Devil Strip*.

Incentive mechanisms have always been critical to build a healthy, highly participatory community of any kind. But historically, these systems and incentive mechanisms have been fractured and separate across spheres. We’ve had political systems for organizing participation in mass movements. We’ve had corporations and other financial structures for organizing participation in business endeavors. And we’ve had status systems for organizing participation in social activities. DAO’s potentially combine all of these structures at once. The mission of DAOs is to have everyone who can be helpful be a part of the collective, and therefore to have a suitable reward for every potential contributor. To do so, they combine financial incentives with social status and political representation.

Web3 communities will take the intrinsic mechanisms of Web2 and meld them with extrinsic incentives.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/57f2ec24-4ce0-48f4-92ee-bd55c0b41b99.png?height=146&width=312)\n\nWe have in the past discussed how the blockchain concept of a ‘decentralized autonomous organization’ (DAO) might apply to groups of people who want to make stuff. We called this theoretical format a ‘Creator DAO.’ In this paradigm, a team or community interested in making something would implement a smart contract according to which tokens in the project would be granted to contributors, customers or investors, in return for their labor or money. \n\nFor example, a group of people who wanted to design a line of shoes might sell tokens in their project to people who believed in their vision. These tokens would bestow several privileges on their holders. They might provide token-holders with discounted pricing and/or priority access to the project’s product. They could give token-holders the ability to vote on shoe designs or other project decisions. They might even provide token-holders with a share of profits when such exist. And of course, the tokens could be sold to other people for profit, if as a result of the success of the project the value of the token increased. In addition to cash, tokens might be earned through work on the project. Designers, marketers, manufacturing and financial experts could be awarded tokens in return for their involvement in the shoe project. Even smaller contributions, like helping a social campaign go viral or providing survey feedback on packaging, could result in token grants. \n\nSo how is this different from crowdfunding like Kickstarter or membership platforms like Patreon? These three frameworks have plenty in common, most importantly, the goal of making it possible for more people to make stuff. But the main difference that a Creator DAO provides is the notion of ownership. You are not simply *supporting* a project. Through the token, you *possess* a piece of it. And, within the rules of its smart contract, are free to use the token as you want. You can sell it, stake it, fractionalize it, include it in an index, take advantage of all of the liquidity-enhancing mechanisms DeFi enables. In other words, with a CreatorDAO, in addition to wanting to help people make stuff because you like the stuff they’ll make, you get financial incentives. You are an investor. A true owner.\n\nSo then how is it different from traditional investing? Again, there’s plenty of similarities here too. Investors own parts of businesses, and depending on the terms and size of their ownership, can vote on issues affecting the company, receive dividends, and at some point, sell their share. The difference is the more fluid and flexible nature of a token. Most companies don’t sell shares to the public until fairly late in their evolution given the transaction, regulatory and coordination costs associated with going public. Meanwhile, private company shares are difficult to sell, generally locked up, either by contract or practical reality, for years. Tokens are typically issued early if not at the beginning of a project. They can and do sell whenever the owner desires. And the potential use-cases are as broad as the creators can imagine. It’s slow and expensive, for instance, to reward a small contribution to a traditional company with an equity grant. But tokens make it easy and inexpensive. You’d never have a special shoe design available only to private equity investors. There wouldn’t be enough of them for that to be worthwhile. With tokens, it makes perfect sense.\n\nPut another way, in order to engage as many people as possible as deeply as possible, Creator DAOs intertwine two kinds of motivations that are usually seen as far apart: social and financial. A ‘traditional’ content website, for example, would never consider its investors and community members in the same way, or try to provide them with a single currency as reward for their distinct kinds of participation. Which isn’t to say that pre-DAO creators didn’t recognize the need to reward their users. They definitely (and increasingly) did. They just envisioned it as an entirely different system of incentives, running parallel to but disconnected from those of its investors. Or perhaps more accurately, subordinate to the company’s financial system. If you think about it, a major feature of the most successful Web 2.0 products was precisely this: the creation of currencies that were valued but weren’t directly financial. Remember ‘gamification?’ Likes, follows, friends and badges -- all so central to the social web we barely notice anymore that all of these were inventions designed to incentivize free labor. In many ways, this has been the core focus of the last few decades of consumer Internet.\n\n**Web2: Tapping Intrinsic Incentives**\n\nWhen The Huffington Post looked to grow participation on their [platform in 2010](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/introducing-huffpost-badg_b_557168), they introduced the behavior of **badging**. Seemingly simple, badging was responsible for the growth of The Huffington Post over any other participatory tool or tactic because the intrinsic benefits tied to the community’s status and identity encouraged engagement on platform and off. The more a community member participated in set tasks, the more benefits they unlocked. \n\nThis entire process started in the comments section. To encourage healthy discourse and increased engagement, users were tasked to moderate and direct conversations. This action was rewarded with a **moderator badge**. This moderator badge gave individuals permission to fully moderate discourse across all articles and be featured as commenters. There were other badges as well they gave additional benefits.

{"id": "Edqjo6-Zv-8zzhQKpSpHTzl9sRtjGdGrGJ5T4o5kilg", "title": "A New Frontier", "body": "Growing up in the 90s, our family had a computer. It was a Compaq Presario, a chunky object with a translucent purple faceplate that opened up to provide CD storage and speakers that attached to the monitor like oversized ears. It was glorious. \nThat computer changed my life — and so did a piece of software that came with it called Microsoft Encarta.\nEncarta was an encyclopedia digitized (Wikipedia before Wikipedia!) and opening it revealed countless entries about important world events and historical figures. These entries took the form of videos and mixed-media presentations that gave the user access to the world's knowledge in a way that was more vibrant and alive than paragraphs of text on a paper page ever could be. The experience was magical from the first moment. When you put the disc in the CD drive a start screen would pop up with a variety of images and faces all interconnected: An astronaut, the Mona Lisa, Abraham Lincoln, Nelson Mandela. Then, choral music would begin to play and voices would speak in succession…\n- “Let there be justice for all.”\n- “Let there be peace for all.”\n- “That’s one small step for man.” \n- And so on, and so on.\nAs a child, I was so inspired by those words and those faces. They filled me with a sense of optimism that made me excited to use the computer, to learn more, to engage with the world and its lessons in a meaningful way. That Encarta CD let an 11-year boy sitting on his parent’s computer encounter the great icons of history and be inspired by their faces and their words — and it let me see them in a way that hadn’t been possible before. Unlike a book or documentary where the work is linear in nature, Encarta let me learn by cutting my own path.\nI felt like I was in charge of the digital world I was living in.\nEncarta was ‘just’ a rudimentary encyclopedia, but it holds a version of the digital age that I’m still yearning for. It's representative of a version of technology that’s eternally hopeful, putting the world’s knowledge in people’s hands and challenging us to look at the past and make decisions for the future.\nChallenging us to be __better__.\nThis feels, on the whole, much different from today's technology. Where Encarta had an unbridled sense of optimism, today’s social network dominated internet seems to bring out our darkest motivations, centered around a kind of pessimism that gives way to outright hostility. \nOur technology needs to evolve, but evolution is hard. \nTo learn a little about why that is, we can look back at how we formed the physical world around us. There are lessons to be learned by looking at the foundations of the land we live on and how our cities were formed.\n- Originally, these spaces were founded because one pioneer decided to move onto a piece of land and take a risk. Then, someone would move into an adjacent space and take a risk on another plot of land. Then another. Then another. \n- Next, those people would have children. They would expand their homes to make room for their growing families. More people would move nearby, and as both the families and the community grew, so too would the town. Each person provided something — resources, utilities, a helping hand. Each person took risk after risk, bet after bet, and the cities expanded or evolved in response, turning into the spaces many of us live in today.\n- Now, when a neighborhood is formed, it happens entirely differently — so different that the frontiersmen and women of the past would find it to be completely foreign. \n- Here’s what happens now: A real estate developer takes a giant loan and buys a large amount of property in a suburb. Homes are built, all at once, in a cookie-cutter fashion. The homes are then sold, one by one, and the neighborhood is complete.\n- That’s it! There’s no evolving the neighborhood. There’s no adding on to the community in a meaningful way. No new land can be purchased and built upon. It’s ‘finished’ — which means that the only paths forward are stagnation, staying just as it is, or decline, falling into disrepair.\n- Our society has grown accustomed to physical and digital spaces existing in their ‘finished’ state, and that’s a problem. Today’s internet has felt like a suburb for some time now, with the monoliths providing us with our platforms and networks buying up land and selling it to us in a cookie cutter fashion — and just as the suburbs from the late 90s and early 2000s are now falling into stagnation or decline, so too is the suburb that is ‘Web 2.0’.\n- I no longer feel like I'm in charge of the digital world I'm living in.\n- The good news is that there’s a new digital frontier opening up. The world of web3 is providing space for us to find new soil; to take a stake on a piece of land and make something new. Now is the time to reclaim the optimism that once was, a digital space led by people who believe in a world where problems can be solved, and solved through unity.\n- The new frontier is one where digital citizens are being reminded of our communal and collective power to solve problems and create a future that we’re proud of — and it's early days yet. \n- What risk will you take to help build the digital city of tomorrow? \n", "timestamp": 1619661487, "digest": "akN3NGINXiZz2SwCENQ-ILgNjeBYD1OBlzJLaxJckUU", "contributor": "0xc7A0D765C3aF6E2710bA05A56c5E2cA190C2E11e"}

Again, not in the weird \"Louis C.K.\" taboo way (because ew, no. Don't do that, folks!)... But something a bit more interesting.\n\n## The Experiment\nWhat if I borrowed someone's NFT without their permission... and sold it?\nReal jerk move, huh?\nSorry to Mike and Chuck for this - I'll pay y'all back!\n\nThis week in the Friends With Benefits Discord, we launched a custom deployment of the [RATS](https://rats.art) (Rapid Art Token Swap) setup. \n\nThe tl;dr is that RATS works like a community art library: you can drop in an NFT in exchange for a RATS token. And you can exchange that RATS token for another NFT that's in the vault. In my case, I deposited ***send for mikey*** into the vault:\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/1028)\n\nand in exchange, I pulled out ***Insufficient Funds: Cannot Save File***:\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/2481)\n\nAnd now for...\n\n## The Auction\n\nI'm using Mirror's built-in NFT Auction functionality to auction off the piece. Ideally, if things go as planned, this auction won't work.\n\nHowever, if it does work, and the piece sells... proceeds will go to an Indian COVID relief charity that I'll announce on Twitter. Cool?\n\nHappy bidding.\n\n[Token #2481](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2481)", "timestamp": 1619671203, "digest": "K1_e4RGlHelA0m84jjzXPeTu493ZVztF1LGIAcdkmas", "contributor": "0xb683A2056526162C4771d363204aF41ea8c1eC52"}
