{"id": "8wy6VOUGuD0uB0Xm7DZS3LMRpPrcV8JhAAnh9_pmSoA", "title": "It's Time to Build (For the Public Good)", "body": "Last year, Marc Andreessen famously (or infamously) wrote “[It’s Time To Build](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/)”, in which he lamented the failure of our institutions to act decisively in the face of the pandemic, and more broadly to collectively imagine and build towards a better future. For many of us he argued, our complacency with the status quo traps us, and makes us reluctantly accept the world around us in place of meaningful action.\n\nThe beauty of the Ethereum ecosystem to me is that although we’re still a nascent community, rarely do we fall into such complacency. In web3, we continuously imagine new ways to coordinate, and build tools and social norms that allow us to play new kinds of positive-sum, multiplayer games. In fact, some of these tools disrupt even the (slightly more technologically inclined) status quo Marc Andreessen represents.\n\nOne way to think about the space in which we play all of these coordination games is as a [digital nation](https://metaversal.banklesshq.com/p/metaverse-as-digital-nations). This isn’t a [perfect analogy](https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1386658153014730760), and even some of the most diehard cypherpunks would agree we won’t be without nation states any time soon, but the metaverse we’re building does share some interesting similarities: in shared culture, shared values, and now shared currency.\n\nHistorically, social contracts have played an important role in helping us form these shared national cultures and values. In an ideal social contract, as early modern philosophers like [Rousseau](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/) have described, everyone forfeits some rights so that they might also impose selected duties. To do this without sacrificing freedom though there has to be a proper process for choosing what rights and duties we care about in the first place. We have to continuously make relevant proposals, achieve consensus, and in short - play the game.\n\nIn the 20th century, governments principally shaped these games and determined the rights and duties that underpin our social contracts. For example, in most democracies today, citizens agree to pay taxes in their shared currencies to fund and maintain basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, and electrical grids.\n\nIn the 21st century however, especially in the web3, we’re still coming to terms with what our shared contracts with each other are. In some corners of our space, we find ourselves asking if we should have any duties to each other at all. Somehow though, despite the fact that there’s no meta-government to appeal to, no local bank to borrow from, and no formal university to give us the knowledge we need, we manage to keep making progress. [DAOs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o) in particular have played an important role in this process, giving us structured ways to [collect](https://foundation.app/blog/pleasrdao), [invest](https://metacartel.xyz/), and [build](https://raidguild.org/) together.\n\nBut as Vitalik mentioned in his recent post on [legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), we still have work to do when it comes to creating new social norms to fund our public goods together. We need to use the power of our shared culture, values, and currency to create social norms that can take us out of the dark forest into the web3 citadel. Web3 is our city, it’s where we live, and we should take care of each other. \n\n\n## **What Are Public Goods?**\n\nIf you’re not already familiar, public goods are a special class of goods that are simultaneously non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludable meaning it’s extremely difficult to stop someone from using the good, like roads and bridges, and non-rivalrous meaning that it’s abundant, and one person’s use of the good doesn’t substantially reduce the amount left for someone else (e.g. there’s more than enough air to go around). Public goods are critical, even selfishly, because we all rely on them - having a new car doesn’t matter if there are no roads to drive it on.\n\nIt’s worth noting that determining what is “truly public” can be a difficult task, and it’s something every community has to decide. One distinction that’s often drawn is between public goods and club goods, those goods like golf courses or membership only gyms that are excludable but non-rivalrous. But to make things more confusing even some of the things we consider public goods can be excludable given enough time and effort. For example, if you’re not a particularly good driver you might have your license revoked. If you’re an American, you might not always be allowed into Canada to use the roads in the first place. \n\nDigital public goods are by default more public, and hence less excludable. There are far fewer restrictions on how we use open source software because the cost of restriction is so much higher. A book in a library is only available locally to those with a library card, but the infrastructure to coordinate information online is accessible around the world. And of course now in web3 the infrastructure to coordinate value can be available to everyone as well.\n\nThis seems like a great thing at first, and it is, but there’s one major problem: the more accessible a good is, the less people want to pay for it. A government only has interest in funding its own roads, companies like Facebook only have interest in funding their own infrastructure (even when it comes to the kinds of open source software they focus on e.g. React), and yes even libraries generally only take care of the books within their walls. As Nadia Eghbal has [written about extensively](https://nayafia.substack.com/p/22-working-in-public), the goods that are most critical and most public are often the least funded. \n\n\n## **Funding Our Shared Infrastructure**\n\nThe good news is that together we can help solve these problems using our own shared web3 infrastructure, the kind that allows us to play positive-sum, multiplayer games together in the first place. And to add to that, we already have some social norms that we’ve been evolving as a community.\n\nOne such social norm the Gitcoin community has tried to set is that we need the community to be more involved in funding Ethereum’s “most public” digital public goods. We’ve done this by setting up quarterly matching rounds using [quadratic funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06421), a novel mechanism designed by Vitalik, Glen Weyl, and Zoe Hitzig in 2018. The way this mechanism works is simple, projects in Ethereum can list themselves as public goods in need of funding, and participants can democratically allocate funds from a community managed matching pool by donating some of their own money. By its design, quadratic funding incentivizes every member of the community to fund the infrastructure they want to see in direct proportion to how useful it will be to them, providing a possible solution to our digital tragedy of the commons. \n\nTo date, this mechanism has distributed over $10mm to projects at their earliest stages, including WalletConnect, Uniswap, Prysmatic Labs, EIP-1559, and more. And all of their success is ours too as members of the Ethereum community.\n\nBut it's always worth questioning whether we're doing enough as web3 citizens. The questions that keep me up at night are how we might encourage more WalletConnects, BrightIDs, and even more quadratic funding mechanisms like Gitcoin Grants. How we might focus less on price and the whims of Twitter personalities, and more on the money, culture, and community legos we want to see in our ecosystem. How we might focus less on speculation and more on participation. \n\n## **It’s Time to Build (For the Public Good)**\n\nOver the coming weeks, Gitcoin will be making some announcements about how you can get involved in finding answers to these questions. We want to see more experimentation, and push the boundaries of what kind of public goods coordination is possible.\n\nOne experiment we’ve already started has been to bring more [community stewards](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41) into the fold, so that we can better understand the needs of those we’re serving in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAnother set of possible experiments, [as Vitalik outlined](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), are around NFTs:\n\n> Which NFTs people find attractive to buy, and which ones they do not, is a question of legitimacy: if everyone agrees that one NFT is interesting and another NFT is lame, then people will strongly prefer buying the first, because it would have both higher value for bragging rights and personal pride in holding it, and because it could be resold for more because everyone else is thinking in the same way. If the conception of legitimacy for NFTs can be pulled in a good direction, there is an opportunity to establish a solid channel of funding to artists, charities and others.\n\nHere, we've already seen some interesting developments on from PleasrDAO who in addition to purchasing Snowden's [first piece](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1383155552793026560) recently purchased a piece from the [Tor Project](https://twitter.com/trevortimm/status/1393333390003392512) to support their privacy efforts.\n\nBut for today, I'd like to start one more experiment right here on Mirror, by inviting anyone inspired by this post to contribute to the recently announced [public goods split address](https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/viamirror/status/1394363720818647041?s=20\n\nThis split address funds three main organizations already helping support public goods: [Gitcoin](https://twitter.com/gitcoin), [ETHGlobal](https://twitter.com/ETHGlobal/), and [MintFund](https://twitter.com/themintfund). \n\n[For the Public Good](crowdfund://0x41eD7D49292b8FBF9b9311C1Cb4D6eB877646C58?network=homestead)\n\nI hope you'll participate, and that we'll find more experiments to explore together to support our shared infrastructure soon. \n\n**It’s time to build for the public good.**\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1621365817, "digest": "7nKKV4x17rVkZL9_C0vVL3Vax2rv1H1ciigleEgBAOw", "contributor": "0x48A63097E1Ac123b1f5A8bbfFafA4afa8192FaB0"}

We’ve done this by setting up quarterly matching rounds using [quadratic funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06421), a novel mechanism designed by Vitalik, Glen Weyl, and Zoe Hitzig in 2018. The way this mechanism works is simple, projects in Ethereum can list themselves as public goods in need of funding, and participants can democratically allocate funds from a community managed matching pool by donating some of their own money. By its design, quadratic funding incentivizes every member of the community to fund the infrastructure they want to see in direct proportion to how useful it will be to them, providing a possible solution to our digital tragedy of the commons. \n\nTo date, this mechanism has distributed over $10mm to projects at their earliest stages, including WalletConnect, Uniswap, Prysmatic Labs, EIP-1559, and more. And all of their success is ours too as members of the Ethereum community.\n\nBut it's always worth questioning whether we're doing enough as web3 citizens. The questions that keep me up at night are how we might encourage more WalletConnects, BrightIDs, and even more quadratic funding mechanisms like Gitcoin Grants. How we might focus less on price and the whims of Twitter personalities, and more on the money, culture, and community legos we want to see in our ecosystem. How we might focus less on speculation and more on participation. \n\n## **It’s Time to Build (For the Public Good)**\n\nOver the coming weeks, Gitcoin will be making some announcements about how you can get involved in finding answers to these questions. We want to see more experimentation, and push the boundaries of what kind of public goods coordination is possible.\n\nOne experiment we’ve already started has been to bring more [community stewards](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41) into the fold, so that we can better understand the needs of those we’re serving in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAnother set of possible experiments, [as Vitalik outlined](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), are around NFTs:\n\n> Which NFTs people find attractive to buy, and which ones they do not, is a question of legitimacy: if everyone agrees that one NFT is interesting and another NFT is lame, then people will strongly prefer buying the first, because it would have both higher value for bragging rights and personal pride in holding it, and because it could be resold for more because everyone else is thinking in the same way. If the conception of legitimacy for NFTs can be pulled in a good direction, there is an opportunity to establish a solid channel of funding to artists, charities and others.\n\nHere, we've already seen some interesting developments on from PleasrDAO who in addition to purchasing Snowden's [first piece](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1383155552793026560) recently purchased a piece from the [Tor Project](https://twitter.com/trevortimm/status/1393333390003392512) to support their privacy efforts.\n\nBut for today, I'd like to start one more experiment right here on Mirror, by inviting anyone inspired by this post to contribute to the recently announced [public goods split address](https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/viamirror/status/1394363720818647041?s=20\n\nThis split address funds three main organizations already helping support the public good: [Gitcoin](https://twitter.com/gitcoin), [ETHGlobal](https://twitter.com/ETHGlobal/), and [MintFund](https://twitter.com/themintfund). \n\n[For the Public Good](crowdfund://0x41eD7D49292b8FBF9b9311C1Cb4D6eB877646C58?network=homestead)\n\nI hope you'll participate, and that we'll find more experiments to explore together to support our shared infrastructure soon. \n\n**It’s time to build for the public good.**\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1621365750, "digest": "7nKKV4x17rVkZL9_C0vVL3Vax2rv1H1ciigleEgBAOw", "contributor": "0x48A63097E1Ac123b1f5A8bbfFafA4afa8192FaB0"}

{"id": "aw0rb4Zmij5ZoEHWNBnVwBEvTuQy8-kmuAPOxC-k20E", "title": "In Vitro Nostalgia: Minting Memories", "body": "## Non-Fungible Memory Tokens [NFMTs]\n\nMemories. What do they reveal about you? What do they remind you of? A forgotten time? The nostalgia of an experience since passed? \n\nAs combed through the various voice recordings on my iPhone, I found a selection of memories from a secret party in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. I didn't immediately think to make them into NFTs. It wasn't until I had gone through the motions on Zora and the audio looped that it clicked; this was the perfect experiment in documenting, sharing, and collecting memories.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/enaraxr/status/1355450773212172290?s=20\n\nWhat could I reveal to the listener? Could they learn about me? And because we had all been deprived of events, could these moments hold deeper meaning to the fleeting nature of socialization? Did we take for granted the ever innocuous social gathering? I'm not sure. But these are questions that have continued to come into view the longer I've sat with these voice notes.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/178)\n\n \n\nClose your eyes, think of yourself either as the observer of the scene, or part of the scene, and let your mind paint the picture of the environment. Imagine where the DJ is, where the characters are, what type of house are you in? \n\nThe first of three notes in this trilogy called ***[\"Shīkurettopātī: One Night In Kurosakimachi\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/178)***, it's serendipitous that my phone picked up both a conversation I'm having about crate-digging at one of the only remaining Tower Record stores in the world *AND* amazing house music. The instrumentation swells with soulful synths as the conversation reaches a euphoric note as we resolve ourselves to buy records acknowledging how awesome the moment is.\n\nThe remaining two notes, ***[\"Not Now, But In The Future\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/189)*** and ***[\"Chinese Omelette OST\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/188)*** create this unintended effect of feeling like a short film with your own visual dreamscape constructing a memory that’s unique to you despite the fact that the audio is not your lived experience.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/189)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/188)\n\n*Chinese Omelette OST is the last remaining NFT of the Shīkurettopātī trilogy to be collected.*\n\nI've posted the NFTs in the order I believe to be the most chronologically accurate, although any DJ will tell you that there are many highs and lows in a set that when you *think* it's over, there is more around the corner! \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6985affa-945f-4a49-86f0-7f256904acbd.jpg?height=3024&width=3024)\n\n*Fig. A: Live band practice in Ext. of Beach House, Kurosaki Beach*\n\nI'd be super curious to see what YOU see, more so than my own recollection (and photo) of the space and the folks within it.\n\n\n---\n\n## Spatial Conversations\n\nIn the context of memories, archived works in many ways achieve a similar effect of nostalgia. While they may not draw from life as a form of `reporting-lived-experience-as-documentation`, works that pull on the thread of life can be memory-inducing. For me, one of those works is a live recording in 2014 of a freeform DJ set with my uni-mates after a day of getting unbelievably stoned called \"SYNESTHESIA\". \n\nYou might be wondering why it's called SYNESTHESIA. For me, and others who experience two or more sensory inputs involuntarily, DJing soundscapes puts me into a trance-like state of flow. I can see threads of light guiding me to my next note as if I'm being controlled. I really don't remember the act of playing only the fact that I've *played* a set. In a way, perhaps there is a narrative to it all that I cannot comprehend. Oddly enough, I've been watching a show called [The Nevers](https://www.hbo.com/the-nevers) which has a character who can sing but she cannot understand what she is actually communicating. Even stranger, only a certain group of people can hear it too. I haven't found a metaphor so closely aligned with my own personal experiences with music.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/1643)\n\nAs a treat to my uni-mates, and to break them into the NFT space, I decided to put [\"SYNESTHESIA\" up for auction with a 1.5 ETH reserve on Zora](https://zora.co/sirsu/1643), to show them one of the core principles that solidifies why crypto can lead to an equitable future. For being supporters of my experiments, I wanted to reward them a split from the proceeds of the sale from the 35-minute live session and essay.\n\nI believe redistribution at all levels should be explored. While there is nothing stopping me from gladly auctioning these NFTs without attribution, I am a firm believer in trying to capture the entire story involving my work. I am currently publishing an essay \"Creative Immortality\" that speaks to the inclusion of others as a necessary component to the preservation of work enabling the natural line of discovery to take place. \n\nAs creatives, we can never have enough inspiration. Attribution provides us with our next set of sources to draw from. And now, we can trace the value these inspirations give us and pay it forward.   \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/228)\n\n* *To further emphasize the vibes...here's my last audio memory encoded on the blockchain for your viewing pleasure.*\n\n---\n\n## The Auctions. \n\n**1 DJ Set, 1 Voice Note, 1 Essay.**\nOn Wednesday, May 19th, 2021 the auctions for SYNESTHESIA, Chinese Omelette OST, and In Vitro Nostalgia will be available for auction on Zora and Mirror. \n\n* SYNESTHESIA has a reserve price of 1.5 ETH. \n* Chinese Omelette OST has a direct sale price of 5 ETH, at auction the reserve price will be 2 ETH.\n* In Vitro Nostalgia has a reserve price of 0.1 ETH.\n\nStay tuned for the auction deployment announcement on [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/sirsuhayb)     \n\n---\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nI want to give a special thanks to everyone involved in the creation of the Secret Party Trilogy and SYNESTHESIA. The splits breakdown will derive from the sale of this essay, and both the Chinese Omelette OST + SYNESTHESIA NFMTs. Because SYNESTHESIA is auctioned through Zora's deployment of $BOUNTY and not on Mirror, 30% of those funds will be added as a tip to the two split contracts attached to this essay.\n\n**Why two separate splits?**\nTo emphasize proper attribution, I wanted to deploy one split contract with recipients that influenced the Secret Party Trilogy, SYNESTHESIA respectively. At the end of the auction period, the ETH within these splits will be claimable to the recipients below. The following is a breakdown of the split % per contract. \n\n### Split Recipients of Secret Party Trilogy (Chinese Omelette OST Auction):\n\n**Fusion Art Japan Residency (30%)**\n[Starnilas Oge](https://twitter.com/SCOGE2222)\n*If you haven't checked out [Fusion.Art](http://fusionart.world/i), you should.

{"id": "mldPJYUv_jUEkVY1_8iLkaa9pVqTY3ZdzQ6FMEY9pu0", "title": "Memory Tokens: The Auction", "body": "\nI recently published an essay talking about the experience minting my own memories.\n\n[I recently published an essay talking about the experience minting my own memories.](https://sirsu.mirror.xyz/kVKneiFoAnwbEVabds1Si7VqkeZPJbMXTDP31L34dKc) \n\nI didn't have a plan when doing so, I just wanted to experiment with what an NFT could be. And although I had minted these works at the end of 2020 to early 2021, with Mirror's splits, and the open-source auction method $BOUNTY, I was able to not only bring these works back into the fore; I could do so with the proper attribution attached in an effort to give back to those who took part, supported my experiment, and of course on-ramp my friends into Crypto.\n\n---\n\n## 1 DJ Set, 1 Voice Note, 1 Essay.\n\nToday, May 19th, 2021 the auctions for SYNESTHESIA, Chinese Omelette OST, and In Vitro Nostalgia will be available for auction on Zora and Mirror.\n\nSYNESTHESIA has a reserve price of 1.5 ETH.\nChinese Omelette OST has a direct sale price of 5 ETH, at auction the reserve price will be 2 ETH.\nIn Vitro Nostalgia has a reserve price of 0.1 ETH.\n\n\n### SYNESTHESIA\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/1643)\n\n### Chinese Omelette OST\n\n[Token #188](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=188)\n\n### In Vitro Nostalgia\n\n[Token #3158](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3158)\n\n---\n\n## Owning The NFMTs\nFor any owner of the NFMTs, here are a set of perks you get associated with the works. You don't have to purchase the set although it is highly encouraged!\n\n* Become a proud owner of a body of work that honors attribution, patronage, and experimentation of a new medium in cryptomedia.\n\n* A massive signal that onboarding your peers into crypto can stem from giving back in a meaningful, permanent way. \n\n* Showing a tangible symbol of support to cultural creatives.\n\n* Owning a special edition hardcover version of the physical book of my Artist-in-residence experience in Japan. [View \"ARTEFACT[S]\"](https://sirsugoods.com/Artefact-s-Making-New-From-That-Which-Is-Foreign)\n\n* A zoom or IRL (depending on where you live) meeting discussing the creation of the NFTs, their underlying experiences, other sources of inspiration, and future expansion of the NFMT (non-fungible memory token) concept.\n\n---\n\n## Splits\n\nThe splits breakdown will derive from the sale of the \"In Vitro Nostalgia\" essay, the Chinese Omelette OST, and SYNESTHESIA. Because SYNESTHESIA is auctioned through Zora's deployment of $BOUNTY and not on Mirror, 30% of those funds will be added as a tip to the two split contracts attached to this essay.\n\n### Splits Breakdown\n\nTo emphasize proper attribution, I wanted to deploy one split contract with recipients that influenced the Secret Party Trilogy, SYNESTHESIA respectively. At the end of the auction period, the ETH within these splits will be claimable to the recipients below. \n\n**Split Recipients of Secret Party Trilogy (Chinese Omelette OST Auction):**\n*Fusion Art Japan Residency (30%)*\n[Starnilas Oge](https://twitter.com/SCOGE2222)\n\n[SECRET PARTY SPLIT](split://0xAdc5e09f4494385758bF33237da20fa58bfAa820?network=mainnet)\n\n\n**Split Recipients of SYNESTHESIA (Zora Auction) + Essay NFT Auction:**\n\n*SCAD Roomies (30%)*\n[W.T.
