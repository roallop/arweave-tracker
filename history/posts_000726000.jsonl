{"id": "poyvBgJxEcAUj3Qur5LLW0nZl4nWySxDIRskL7nCwBU", "title": "Is This Public? (or...Why I’m leaving TradFi for Crypto) ", "body": "\n### It’s All Stocks\nA portfolio manager I used to work with once remarked that if you stay in finance for long enough, you begin to see everything as a stock. When I first heard this, as an intern at an investment firm in 2017, it seemed like one of those Wall Street neologisms that sound true, but don’t **feel** true until you’ve lived them firsthand (other neologisms that fall under this category: “Don’t short on valuation”, “Don’t short on competition”, and my personal favorite: “Don’t try to predict the future. Try to describe the present”). This particular piece of wisdom was palpable almost immediately: in August of 2017, I drove to the Hamptons with some friends and realized that the PM who said that everything looked like a stock had a long or short position in half of the retailers occupying the strip malls along the Southhampton Bypass. In finance, even a trip to the beach is a quest for alpha. \n\nThe 2017 internship turned into a job offer, which turned into a full time position in 2018 after I graduated from college. I felt luckier than a lot of my peers who spent senior year either cramming for McKinsey case studies or lamenting because they doubted they had the quantitative skills to even attempt one. Before the summer of 2017, I probably would’ve put myself in the latter camp: a history major who only did theater, film, and journalism in college. But the internship taught me that you can learn any quantitative skill on the job, by sheer force of attrition. Someone will ask you for the diluted share count of an upcoming IPO, or to input a company’s EBITDA into an earnings model (which raises other questions, like what is depreciation and amortization, and how do you use Excel?), or might say to you “yes, gross margins are 50% ***right now***, but what happens when GMs reach 65%, and S&M spend falls to 30% of revenue, and Trump manages to pass corporate tax cuts? How much are they earning ***then***?” Early on in my internship, it might take me an hour to figure out what question I was even being asked, and another few hours to answer it. But over time -- through attrition -- the concepts fall into place. And then you begin to start seeing everything as a stock. \n\nIn the initial phase, “seeing stocks'' might just mean the sudden realization that the vast majority of items and systems you interact with on a daily basis are actually public companies. This understanding gets augmented even further when the above concepts (diluted shares, EBITDA, tax cuts) get layered in, and you begin to think of companies as their own little organisms: sentient income statements with hopes and dreams that evolve with every quarter. Then, the companies begin to talk to each other: you have a laser component company over here, and a global OEM powerhouse over there, and a Chinese phone manufacturer somewhere else, and a smorgasbord of social camera apps, and with all of that information you might ask yourself something like: where is the 3D imaging industry heading? If you were to peer inside the brain of a truly great portfolio manager it would look a bit like a timelapse of a rapidly industrializing metropolis. A single question about the destiny of 3D imaging would be the launching pad for a mental model around the P+L of dozens of companies, implications for global supply chains, and assumptions around how consumer behavior will continue to evolve. Change one input, and the other variables will instantly recalibrate. \n\nThe most exciting thing about investing (or learning something new in general) are the moments where your own brain surprises you. A few weeks into the internship, I pitched my first stock. A couple days later, I was writing up earnings calls. Even though I definitely didn’t understand everything I was hearing, I realized that writing was a great way to interrogate where the gaps in my knowledge actually were: moments where the logic didn’t compute or my ideas failed to flow seamlessly into the next were clearly places where I needed to do more research. In a short amount of time, no one needs to ask you “What happens when GMs reach 65%?” because the question automatically populates itself in your brain (and then you want to know what happens when gross margins reach 70%, 80% and 85%), and you can pipe over to Excel, change some cells, and figure out the answer. The truly great moments are when you preempt a question even before the smart people you work for ask it.  \n\nIn this way, seeing things as stocks becomes its own network effect: everyone in the in-group is inculcated with a similar (though -- it should be emphasized -- not identical) set of priorities and platonic ideals to seek out in the investment process. In doing this, you learn to think not only on behalf of yourself, but on behalf of other investors, and the meta-game is the process of trying to parse the blind spots of the players around you. Yes, this can result in a lot of group-think (and sometimes compounds into a bubble) but the combination of being right, being wrong, being wrong about others being right, and being right about others being wrong (and vice versa) is a kind of palliative against things getting too out of hand. Generally, the people who make the most amount of money are optimists with a streak of paranoia: PMs whose heads are in the clouds, with eyes that glance constantly over their shoulders. \n\nToward the end of the summer, I knew I wanted a job offer. The desire went beyond my aversion to McKinsey case studies (after what I’d learned through attrition, I had more confidence in my ability to tackle one) and had more to do with the fact that I loved the job. I began to think of it as a privatized form of journalism or history scholarship: you speak to experts, read primary and secondary research, scrutinize transcripts, and try to form a narrative that never existed before (with the added component, of course, of being sensitive to what other investors are thinking). So when I got an offer, near the end of August, I accepted immediately on the spot. \n\nBut now onto other things that were happening around the same time. \n\n### You Either Grok It Or You Don’t\nThe period of 2017-2018 also happened to coincide with the third wave of crypto hype -- the runup of Bitcoin from $1,500 to $19,000, and Ethereum to $200 to $1,200 (and back down again). I wish I could say that the combination of a job offer, a light course load, and the relative abandon of senior year created the ideal environment for me to start picking up white papers and getting into crypto. But quite the opposite: getting TradFi-pilled made me dubious of anything that threatened to disrupt the cushy world I had just entered. During senior year, I’d sometimes visit my colleagues at the office, where we’d spot the occasional appearance of an ICO promoter or Winklevoss twin on the CNBC-designated flatscreen TV in our trading room. We’d gaze in silent, baffled horror, like we were observing a natural disaster in a foreign country. \n\nWhen my colleagues and I did discuss crypto, it was mostly in an orthogonal (and subtly pessimistic) way: what would happen to the price of AMD and Nvidia stock when crypto ultimately crashed and demand for GPUs would plummet? Should we be shorting the public companies which were opportunistically appending “blockchain” to their name and business plans, but clearly had no prior bonafides in crypto (in retrospect, probably yes). Even among the TradFi people who bought Bitcoin and Ethereum, there was a degree of calculating opportunism -- the bubble would pop eventually, and the key was to sell before the crowd. \n\nWe didn’t grok. \n\nBut crypto wasn’t completely alien to me either. In June of 2017, right around the time I started my internship, I began getting a Ethereum-focused newsletter from my friend [Teo](https://twitter.com/teo_leibowitz) (who now works at Uniswap). I can’t recall exactly how I ended up on his mailing list -- I must’ve run into him on Columbia’s campus or at a nearby bar and expressed interest, but anyway, I do know that I got the first issue, sent out on Saturday, Jun 24, 2017 at 1:52 PM. The subject header: *Crypto Chat #1: Flash Crash, Visa, China, ICOs*. It began:\n\n> *Hello - hope this finds you well.*\n> *As I've become more and more involved in discussions around Ethereum (ETH) in past months, several of you have mentioned interest in some kind of regular newsletter sharing a roundup of thoughts/news, so here goes - please find attached.*\n\nWithin the newsletter was a breathtaking roundup of recent crypto news: the [GDAX flash crash](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/22/ethereum-price-crash-10-cents-gdax-exchange-after-multimillion-dollar-trade.html#:~:text=Ethereum%20briefly%20suffered%20a%20flash,The%20cryptocurrency%20later%20rebounded.), a Visa job posting for Ethereum developers, [the staggering 65 million dollar Status ICO](https://www.coindesk.com/ico-blues-status-raises-58-million-leaves-buyers-waiting). Recall, I was still learning how exactly an IPO works (plus how to judge and value one), so the new mechanics of the crypto economy were a bit too much for me to wrap my head around.  I opened Teo’s newsletters most weeks (they arrived at a steady near-weekly pace until October of 2018), but at best I skimmed them and at worst I raised my eyebrows and said to myself dubiously “well that shit’s crazy.”\n\nI had other opportunities to grok, and flubbed those too. Fall semester of senior year I went on a few dates with a Turkish grad student with a mining rig set up in his Morningside Heights apartment. The way he talked about Bitcoin and Ethereum was completely different from how I heard the media describe what was going on. He came from a country with a debased currency, an untrustworthy government, and ungreased payment rails. He had grown up on the internet, and foresaw an interlinked, nationless society governed by the will of networked users and executed by code. The way he talked about it sounded exciting -- the kind of thing some of my SaaS-happy colleagues would’ve been into. The only problem was that...well the place I’d just accepted a job offer from only invested in enterprises that were public companies. Bitcoin and Ethereum were just ideas, and their most prominent manifestations were failed ICOs that were beginning to attract the wrath of the SEC. \n\nBy the time I graduated in May 2018, both Bitcoin and Ethereum had fallen below the high prices that attracted snarky clickbait pieces from the New York Times. Which meant that I pretty much stopped wondering about cryptocurrency and what all the hype was about. And then I stepped into full-time TradFi, which is an animal of its own. \n\n### The Social Network\nOne thing I was never told about Wall Street is that it’s one giant social network. From the outside it looks like numbers, lines, and glittering abstraction, but from the inside it’s essentially a high school cafeteria. Reputations are brokered and leveraged for allocations in an IPO, lavish, well-attended lunches are sponsored by investment banks, and the myth of the anonymous whale are overblown: your traders can call up pretty much any other desk in the industry and figure out who just made a block trade in a stock you’re jockeying to buy. You will attend dinners, and have the opportunity to rub shoulders with management teams. Names of prolific or disgraced traders who pop up in Bloomberg and the Financial Times are usually one degree of separation away. No one is incognito, even if the charts make it look that way. \n\nThis is a digression, but a private theory I have about the wave of SPACs in 2020 is that they had less to do with macroeconomic trends (COVID, low interest rates) or microeconomic trends (investment banks who wanted to earn a nice fee) than they did with the simple compulsion to sustain the social network. People were bored at home, and wanted to feel important. So they all did SPACs. \n\nStock investors aren’t even the most aggressively social creatures; our bond-trading counterparts are even more outgoing. About a year into my job, in April of 2019, I looked at the IPO of TradeWeb, a digital trading network for fixed-income assets. I was shocked to discover that just 20% of bonds, treasuries, swaps, and derivatives are traded electronically. The remaining 80% are done on the phone, over fax, or during lunch and golf. This is partially due to the fact that many fixed income assets have shallow liquidity pools or trade infrequently. But there’s another reason too: the social network keeps people locked into the old way of doing things. \n\nAnother thing you begin to notice as a stock investor is that some of the companies you’re evaluating -- the VC-annointed, so-called disruptors who are changing the world and giving the incumbents a million reasons to be fearful at night -- are not actually that innovative. They’ve just figured out one bit of arbitrage (better advertising, better branding, more money from VCs, clever financial engineering) to realize staggering growth, with punt-the-proverbial-can-down-the-road promises about future profitability. \n\nThis is especially true in the fintech space, where you might see, for example, a digital lender sell off consolidated loans in the form a variable interest entity, thus sacrificing the cash flows from those loans--and thus, the long-term upside (and so, the very “innovative” digital lender will be stuck losing money until the FDIC throws it a bone and lets it get a banking license...but by then the marketing dollars will have dried up so the growth will have slowed, and the earnings multiple will compress). Or you might see other forms of arbitrage, like an insure-tech company that gets its customer foothold in low-competition fields like renter’s insurance...but is forced to fight against high churn and low retention (which is why there’s so little competition in those fields -- you probably don’t want that customer to begin with). Or a home iBuyer that promises faster selling times...all in exchange for commission fees that are roughly double the industry average (and in a home-buying environment where homes sell at a staggering velocity without the need for an iBuyer to begin with). Just fun, late-stage growth stuff. \n\nNow to be clear, I’m not saying that new public companies aren’t doing exciting and innovative things -- there are plenty of companies in biotechnology, data warehousing, web security, eCommerce, and retail that are delighting their customers and doing wildly great things. And even those fintechs have better customer service, and sometimes better APYs and lending rates than their more established rivals. But at the end of the day, everyone is subservient to the same master business model, and a lot of things that look like real change are just shiny skin-grafts atop the old way of doing things.  \n\nUnderstanding this was one part of why finance began to feel a little ridiculous to me. And the understanding was by no means instantaneous; it took me a little over a year and a half before I started recognizing the skin-graft business model. But once you see it, you can’t unsee it: you’ll look deep in the unconsolidated section of a company’s balance sheet, or maybe just glance at the sales and marketing expenses (if this product is really better, why do they need to spend 90% of revenue on S+M?) and begin to question whether what you’re being pitched is actually all that world-changing, or if you’ve just been seduced by the accoutrements of Wall Street life (nice lunches, smooth-talking management teams, brassy salespeople etc.). Of course, there are plenty of people who see all of this and love Wall Street for other reasons: the constant challenge and sense that you’re learning something every moment, being surrounded by brilliant people, the game of it all, and yes, the money. And of course, I enjoyed all of this...but I still couldn’t get beyond the skin-grafting.   \n\nAt the beginning of 2020, I had a number of ideas that I wanted to try after TradFi. Most of the things on my list involved more creativity than being a stock analyst: I was weighing the idea of either returning to my film roots and working in production, or doing a bunch of coding bootcamps and trying to work in game design. I played a ton of games as a kid (Maplestory, The Sims, Runescape, and Civilization were some of my favorites), and my job had given me a fresh pair of eyes through which to view the various incentives and nuances at play when you orient people around mercenary goals. Between my love for devising narratives and the quantitative bent I’d picked up over the past few years, I thought that it might be worth trying out game development. In the time since graduation, I’d taught myself some coding basics but never sat down to undergo the requisite brain-attrition necessary to actually be proficient. Anyway, at the beginning of 2020, I had tentative plans to leave my job by the summer of 2020 -- exactly three years since the start of my 2017 internship -- and try something new. \n\nAnd then a pandemic happened.\n\n### It’s All A Game \nSo, March 2020. COVID-19 is officially a national crisis. In the realm of finance, the Dow plunged 26%, the Vix spiked all the way up to 83, and in a panic I withdrew 50% of my stock portfolio from the market. On March 16th, 2020 my entire team called in for our first work-from-home 9am call, and spent about half the time speculating about when New York would reach herd immunity and the other half discussing what stocks we should buy when the pandemic ended (perhaps a testament to our enduring optimism). Stocks continued to plummet through the end of March, and then began their staggering, unprecedented recovery (thank you, Federal Reserve).\n\nUnbeknownst to me, similar stress tests were unfolding in crypto: Bitcoin fell 50%, and the crash of Ethereum set off a chain reaction of pricing oracle lags, surging gas prices, [decentralized exchange liquidations](https://medium.com/aave/crypto-black-thursday-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-7f2acebf2b83), and [the Maker debt auction](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/agenda-discussion-scientific-governance-and-risk-tuesday-march-17-9am-pst-4-00-pm-utc/1630/7) (on the bright side, Hayden Adams popped onto Twitter [to chirpily inform people](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1238457224214786048) that Uniswap achieved a then-record amount of volume). Months later, when I finally started seriously getting into crypto (and to be honest, specifically Ethereum), I spent hours reading Medium posts, Twitter threads, and forums, unearthing lore across the ecosystem, and reliving not only the drama of March 2020, but sagas from the past decade. This is another instance where having majored in history really helped me: it’s just that my sources expanded beyond library archives and into stuff like blogs, DAO forums, Discord servers, and Etherscan transactions. \n\nAnyway, back to Spring 2020. If Wall Street felt like a game before, this sense got further compounded when the sexiness and thrill of conferences and hand-shaking were stripped away, and all we were left with were Bloomberg terminal windows and Zoom meetings. In other words, the skin-graft of Wall Street itself was lifted. While the actual content of work was certainly getting more interesting -- markets and the narratives that animated them were being rewritten on a daily basis --- the substance of everyday life was, perhaps unsurprisingly, quite banal. Everything was unfolding on the interface-layer, on the screen, like a videogame. \n\nI still remember why and when I started reading about crypto again. Every Sunday, I’d send out an email to my colleagues with a roundup of news related to stocks and trade ideas we’ve been discussing. On May 31st, 2020, I included [a link to a New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/business/media/new-model-celebrity.html) about Cameo, Patreon, and Substack -- one of the first mainstream pieces I’d read codifying the “creator economy” as a real force in the market. The Times also linked to a bunch of articles -- including [a few](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/) [by Li Jin](https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/), which brought me to the a16z website, which (after the relentless hyperlink-clicking that I tend to do) [landed me on a podcast](https://a16z.com/2020/05/26/a16z-podcast-new-fan-engagement-models-for-athletes-and-influencers/) with Jeff Jordan, Jesse Walden, Zoran Basich and the NBA player Spencer Dinwiddie. Spencer, a point guard with the Brooklyn Nets, was planning on tokenizing a portion of his three-year contract with the team, in an effort to receive more of his income upfront. What struck me about the podcast was the way Spencer articulated crypto as a unique enabler of an internet of value -- a way to create liquidity in an idiosyncratic pool of assets underpinned both by monetary worth and personal affinity. For the first time, crypto started to make sense, despite his occasional drops of industry lingo (Eth2, Polkadot, Tezos) that I still wasn’t totally familiar with. \n\nFrom the podcast, I clicked on [Jesse Walden’s](https://a16z.com/author/jesse-walden/) name, which led me to his author page where I landed on his (then) most recent article: [“Crypto’s Business Model is Familiar. What Isn’t is Who Benefits.”](https://a16z.com/2020/04/08/crypto-network-effects/) This piece was another crucial unlock for me. In it, Jesse described a system I was much more familiar with: network effects. But Jesse wasn’t just talking about the networked models I had grown familiar with as a stock analyst (Uber, Facebook/Instagram, Twilio, Wall Street life itself, etc.), but actually drawing analogies between Web 2.0 companies and their crypto counterparts. I hadn’t yet heard of Compound or Uniswap, but I knew about LendingClub and Coinbase, and what Jesse was describing seemed to be a far fairer model for organizing a business and aligning incentives. As Jesse writes in the piece: “[t]he principal innovation of crypto networks is their ability to grow network effects by enabling users to share in the value they create.” \n\nTo those already in the crypto space, this might seem like the most obvious observation in the world. ***Of course*** web3 protocols need users, and of course those users are attracted to networks with the deepest liquidity pools and most attractive incentives. But for someone who, up until that point, didn’t really grasp that actual businesses were being built on top of decentralized blockchains like Ethereum, this was an absolute revelation. The way I’d seen crypto written about by mainstream media tended to focus on cryptocurrencies as assets and investments -- but Jesse’s piece went a layer deeper and looked at crypto at the layer of ERC-20 tokens and business models. \n\nThat was a major turning point for me. Starting in June 2020, I began to follow the space a bit more closely. I began checking Coindesk and other crypto-focused news sites, and tracked the wave of token drops and liquidity-mining incentives that were picking up momentum. Admittedly, the significance of DeFi Summer ([the launch of the Compound](https://www.coindesk.com/compounds-comp-token-price-doubles-amid-defi-mania) and [Balancer](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-platform-balancer-bal-token-distribution-compound-comp) tokens, rampant yield farming, and [TVL reaching nearly $8 billion by the end of August](https://news.bitcoin.com/total-value-locked-in-defi-jumped-83-in-august-8-billion-in-assets-held/)) was actually a little lost on me. I assumed that everything that was going on was simply a continuation from the 2017-2018 hype cycle, rather than (as it now seems) a genuine shift forward in the energy and momentum of the industry. Still, I felt like things were different than they were two years prior. By the time the UNI token dropped in September 2020, I was beginning to develop a suspicion that tokens might one day shift the nature of traditional capital markets as well. \n\nIf users are given tokens, early investors are offered liquidity faster, and outsiders are given the opportunity to buy-in, is there a future where the need for traditional capital markets is reduced or rendered obsolete completely? Clearly, we’re still in a very early phase of this (and a large number of tokens dropped today have nebulous utility), but it does seem possible that with everything shifting upstream in the realm of finance (DeFi, token drops, faster and more-efficient asset trading), everything downstream will begin to adjust as well. The model of Uniswap loomed in my head when the Coinbase S1 dropped in February of this year. A decentralized exchange is running head-to-head in daily volume and revenue with a centralized leviathan valued at several magnitudes more -- and that leviathan has over a thousand employees, and likely lower margins (note: this should not be read as a knock against Coinbase which has a much more diverse business: an institutional segment, [a nascent debit card](https://www.coinbase.com/card) and [high-yield interest account](https://www.coinbase.com/lend), a much larger compliance/legal team, an investing arm, a strategic affiliation with USDC, a much more diverse balance sheet, etc...but still, the rise of Uniswap is truly staggering). It raises the question: how many more industries can crypto disrupt, when decentralized protocols replace employees and overhead costs, and value can instead be shared with users and stakeholders? \n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself. In October of 2020, my friend [Nikita](https://twitter.com/singareddynm) invited me and a bunch of mutual friends to spend the month in a house in Maine. While there, I met [Reggie](https://twitter.com/HipCityReg), who was getting even deeper into crypto than I was. I had only been reading the articles and token drop announcements -- Reggie was investing, reading white papers, swapping tokens, yield farming, and just generally ***living*** in it (in addition to all of that, he’s also the CEO of an avatar social network company called Eternal). Anyway, the trip was the extra push I needed to begin seriously thinking about leaving my current job (I’d put that plan on temporary hiatus because of the pandemic). I was surrounded by people in various stages of mid-20’s self-discovery: everyone was either accepting a new position, about to quit a job, applying to grad school, launching an angel fund, raising money for a startup, working in VC, [or working](https://twitter.com/_TamaraWinter) [for Stripe](https://twitter.com/orbuch). As a stock analyst I didn’t quite feel like a vampire squid, but I did feel a little like a barnacle -- hanging on the outer rim of life but not really participating in it substantially. The trip truly changed my life in a lot of ways -- I met people who loved their work, were optimistic about tech, and felt a clear sense of responsibility about the direction of the industry. \n\nWhen I got back from the trip, I started really diving into crypto. I read the Ethereum White Paper for the first time (I know, I know, it took me awhile!). I discovered MEV; in fact, when I read the paper [“Flash Boys 2.0: Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and Consensus Instability in Decentralized Exchanges\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf), it was the first time I felt like I really understood how smart contracts work and orders are processed on the blockchain (what that paper does really well is highlight how the Ethereum network functions by exposing points of arbitrage). I started doing research and buying currencies and tokens -- trying to assess their businesses the way I evaluate a stock (once you start seeing things as stocks, anything is up for fair valuation). I [discovered NFTs that I love](https://twitter.com/VirtualElena/status/1389377447402033155), and met people like [Toby Shorin](https://twitter.com/tobyshorin) and [John Palmer](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer) who had been doing work in the industry for a few years. \n\nIn late January, I was still at the firm, but had already told my boss I was starting to look for new positions. I was already quietly buzzing with excitement about crypto, and was also jazzed by a few other personal projects I had just worked on (including messing a bit around with Unity and learning a bit of C#). That entire month had a kind of “crossing-the-Rubicon” valence to it. Between finally making it to 2021, the storm on the Capitol, and the promise of vaccines on the horizon, it seemed like the world was reconstituting itself. \n\nStill, like everyone else at my job, in finance, and probably most people in the country, I was completely shocked to watch what happened in the final few weeks of January when Gamestop rose roughly 750% in the span of a few days, invigorated by the forces of Reddit. Among my colleagues, the reaction was a mix of fear, awe, and self-protection. Chief among the concerns: could one of our positions be next (a new neologism: “Don’t short something if r/WallStreetBets is about to send it to the moon. You will get rekt”). Over the next few days, our outlook evolved: by January 28th we had a deeper grasp of the months-long leadup to the saga. RoaringKitty had sowed the seeds for months on YouTube and the idea had been percolating for awhile on Reddit. This realization prompted a more nuanced discussion about the way the average retail investor was a lot more sophisticated than the elite Wall Streeter gives them credit for. \n\nr/WallStreet bets had illuminated something: everyone was now playing the same game, mediated by the same interface. COVID rendered us all crouched, behind screens, contending to steer the same pools of capital in different directions. I think institutional Wall Street is afraid for a reason that’s even more intrinsic than the idea of being liquidated or margin-called. The game that we’d spent decades perfecting and protecting for a select group of insiders was now open to anyone. A great incursion on the social network was unfolding for everyone to witness. The funhouse culmination of Metcalfe’s law. \n\nI believe crypto only intensifies that. Capital can now move at the same pace of online thought. Jesse Walden even hinted at that in the first article of his that I read: “We can now move bits of value in the way we move bits of information: using an open standard, in very granular transmissions, instantly, to anyone, anywhere in the world.” That ability will change everything. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e0065b2b-dd1e-411b-bd11-87a515588576.jpg?height=311&width=577)\n\n### Describing the Present \nEveryone’s journey down the crypto rabbit-hole is deeply personal to them. Mine is an amalgamation of my work in finance and investing, my private anxieties around whether I gave film enough of a shot (and underpinning that, a desire to make the act of creating art easier and more financially viable for my friends who were brave enough to go all-in), my personal tendencies toward light iconoclasm, my delight in uncertainty, and my desire to make the world a fairer, more economically just place. I think most people in crypto share some array of these traits, and have their own motivations as well. I think the key is finding the unlock for each person, and introducing them to crypto that way.\n\nMy dad began to grasp Ethereum after I suggested he read the white paper; as a lawyer, he immediately grokked the idea of immutable smart contracts. I’ve started a consulting gig with a resale and limited-run goods startup on a social token rewards system, and our conversations have centered around unifying the values of buyers, sellers, and creating relationships that endure beyond a transaction. Given the pace of sell-side notes, investment bank-hosted webinars, and recent high-profile announcements of potential TradFi-DeFi alliances ([Compound Treasury, for example](https://medium.com/compound-finance/announcing-compound-treasury-for-businesses-institutions-83d4484fb82e)) I think Wall Street is beginning to wake up to the indelible momentum of crypto as well.\n \nIn my final weeks as a stock analyst, I pitched Ethereum, Uniswap, and MakerDAO as long positions to my colleagues (though no one bought...yet). We had numerous discussions around the promises of crypto, and what various crypto-native business models might look like. [Marc Rubenstein’s](https://twitter.com/MarcRuby) excellent [Reinventing The Financial System post](https://www.netinterest.co/p/reinventing-the-financial-system) about MakerDAO was the catalyst for a thorough, long-winding conversation about the fractional reserve banking system, and the way loans underpin the financial industry. I think my former teammates were surprised to hear that crypto could be used as a means to issue a dollar-backed stablecoin, and that a blockchain-based issuer could also begin to do work in new segments like [real-world-asset-backed loans](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/real-world-finance). While MakerDAO’s initial pool of RWA loans is quite small (just under [~4m in total loans outstanding today](https://duneanalytics.com/queries/38282/75752)), it’s easy to see this scaling into a much larger operation (which [could help diversify their collateral base away from USDC](https://daistats.com/)). These are early signs that crypto has the potential to grow to touch more than just value-exchange online. \n\nIt’s still so early for everything. A few nights ago, I went back and re-read some of the first messages I sent with the Turkish grad student from 2017. I wanted to revisit what I was really thinking about cryptocurrencies at the time. Our messages began in September, just a few weeks after my post-internship job offer. This part in particular stuck out to me:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d87d30d1-c279-453e-8e65-d716bd26d23b.jpeg?height=523&width=665)\n\nEssentially, I was asking -- how can Bitcoin (or Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency) scale without the kind of leverage and rehypothecation that we see in traditional financial markets? In my own words “*Bitcoin (or the blockchain) can’t replicate the international banking system we have where money and ‘value’ is basically manufactured through securitization and other fancy financial instruments.*” Obviously, I was not anticipating DeFi. As I said in the second message “*I’ve noticed that tech people are usually way more imaginative.*” I was right about that. DeFi had a little under $2bn in TVL a year ago and now sits [just above $50bn in TVL today](https://defipulse.com/) (and much more if you include blockchains like Solana and Binance)  -- a staggering amount of growth. \n\nWhile you might argue that DeFi encourages some degree of reckless over-speculation, overleveraged trading, and is artificially inflating the value of certain crypto-assets today, I actually don’t think that matters longer-term. For one, price action in the industry serves as a form of advertising, and an early engine of innovation (Chris Dixon and Eddy Lazzarin [had a good post that examined this phenomenon](https://a16z.com/2020/05/15/the-crypto-price-innovation-cycle/) with respect to the price of Bitcoin, but the same is likely true if you map in assets like Ethereum or Solana). Even if certain assets fluctuate today (and those fluctuations are intensified by leverage), the overall impact of getting more people interested in crypto is a positive counterweight to any near-term mania (though yes, it does suck for the people who lose a lot of money). \n\nAnd even if DeFi and yield farming is creating nearer-term hype, it’s also illuminating the greater promise of crypto in general: the idea that if you eliminate middlemen and share value with users of a protocol instead, the positive externalities are so great that crypto can start behaving like a public good. Grants issued by groups like Uniswap and the Ethereum Foundation are an early indication of this. And this isn’t confined to just DeFi; NFT projects allow creators and collectors to share in the value of art created by eliminating (or at the very least, reducing the take rate) of middlemen, while encoding an enduring revenue stream for the originator of a specific work. Hopefully we’ll soon see ways to map this model onto other scalable operations, like music and other forms of entertainment, DAOs that own real estate, and maybe a blockchain-based Uber. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b229174b-6b68-48b8-8a23-7567eb750663.jpeg?height=259&width=460)\n\nThe “seeing things as stocks” mindset that was first inculcated in me four years ago will likely need to be reframed. In the future, public companies may see no separation between users, employees, and shareholders. In fact, “public companies” as we understand them today may not even exist, as they will have issued tokens at an earlier stage, and might not even IPO. While I realize I’m now violating my favorite neologism (“Don’t try to predict the future. Try to describe the present.”), I think we have early signals that this could come to pass. Everything from the increased focus [on DAO treasury management](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-daos-should-approach-treasury) to aforementioned efforts to collateralize real-world-assets with DeFi indicate that the need to tap public markets for capital may recede (it’s also quite possible that public markets and TradFi in general are reshaped from within by crypto, in ways that I’m not yet imagining, and they continue to endure in a revitalized form). Of course, there are tons of uncertainties here: the continued pace of user adoption, and regulatory overhangs are two big ones. \n\nMostly, I’m just unabashedly optimistic, for all the reasons I outlined above. In the four years since I first started paying attention to crypto, the industry has transitioned into an instrument of genuine value creation. I’ve met so many people in the past year who have inspired and galvanized me -- and my only hope is that I can contribute to an industry that I believe will revolutionize the way we live, both online and in the physical world. \n\nUsually when I write an essay, I start with the concluding paragraph already written, at least in my head. I tend to begin already knowing what I want the lesson to be. This is one of the few exceptions -- an hour before publishing this, I’m sitting on the couch in my living room, trying to figure out the best way to bring both the past four years of my professional life, and the promise of crypto to some kind of satisfying finale. And I’m realizing that it’s probably an impossible task to achieve in writing. Because with crypto, you just have to live it. So now I’m off to go do that. \n\n*Thanks to early readers of this essay: Andrew, Jeremy, Keeks, Reggie, Tarun, and Toby.* \n\n*Also boundless thanks to the builders, writers, thinkers, tinkerers, and visionaries who have made their work available on everything from Github to blogs to forums to Discord messages.

(or...Why I’m leaving TradFi for Crypto) ", "body": "[Is This Public ](split://0x9d0F22bB137F446892c5cDf2bc129e7e8362bEfc?network=mainnet)\n\n### It’s All Stocks\nA portfolio manager I used to work with once remarked that if you stay in finance for long enough, you begin to see everything as a stock. When I first heard this, as an intern at an investment firm in 2017, it seemed like one of those Wall Street neologisms that sound true, but don’t **feel** true until you’ve lived them firsthand (other neologisms that fall under this category: “Don’t short on valuation”, “Don’t short on competition”, and my personal favorite: “Don’t try to predict the future. Try to describe the present”). This particular piece of wisdom was palpable almost immediately: in August of 2017, I drove to the Hamptons with some friends and realized that the PM who said that everything looked like a stock had a long or short position in half of the retailers occupying the strip malls along the Southhampton Bypass. In finance, even a trip to the beach is a quest for alpha. \n\nThe 2017 internship turned into a job offer, which turned into a full time position in 2018 after I graduated from college. I felt luckier than a lot of my peers who spent senior year either cramming for McKinsey case studies or lamenting because they doubted they had the quantitative skills to even attempt one. Before the summer of 2017, I probably would’ve put myself in the latter camp: a history major who only did theater, film, and journalism in college. But the internship taught me that you can learn any quantitative skill on the job, by sheer force of attrition. Someone will ask you for the diluted share count of an upcoming IPO, or to input a company’s EBITDA into an earnings model (which raises other questions, like what is depreciation and amortization, and how do you use Excel?), or might say to you “yes, gross margins are 50% ***right now***, but what happens when GMs reach 65%, and S&M spend falls to 30% of revenue, and Trump manages to pass corporate tax cuts? How much are they earning ***then***?” Early on in my internship, it might take me an hour to figure out what question I was even being asked, and another few hours to answer it. But over time -- through attrition -- the concepts fall into place. And then you begin to start seeing everything as a stock. \n\nIn the initial phase, “seeing stocks'' might just mean the sudden realization that the vast majority of items and systems you interact with on a daily basis are actually public companies. This understanding gets augmented even further when the above concepts (diluted shares, EBITDA, tax cuts) get layered in, and you begin to think of companies as their own little organisms: sentient income statements with hopes and dreams that evolve with every quarter. Then, the companies begin to talk to each other: you have a laser component company over here, and a global OEM powerhouse over there, and a Chinese phone manufacturer somewhere else, and a smorgasbord of social camera apps, and with all of that information you might ask yourself something like: where is the 3D imaging industry heading? If you were to peer inside the brain of a truly great portfolio manager it would look a bit like a timelapse of a rapidly industrializing metropolis. A single question about the destiny of 3D imaging would be the launching pad for a mental model around the P+L of dozens of companies, implications for global supply chains, and assumptions around how consumer behavior will continue to evolve. Change one input, and the other variables will instantly recalibrate. \n\nThe most exciting thing about investing (or learning something new in general) are the moments where your own brain surprises you. A few weeks into the internship, I pitched my first stock. A couple days later, I was writing up earnings calls. Even though I definitely didn’t understand everything I was hearing, I realized that writing was a great way to interrogate where the gaps in my knowledge actually were: moments where the logic didn’t compute or my ideas failed to flow seamlessly into the next were clearly places where I needed to do more research. In a short amount of time, no one needs to ask you “What happens when GMs reach 65%?” because the question automatically populates itself in your brain (and then you want to know what happens when gross margins reach 70%, 80% and 85%), and you can pipe over to Excel, change some cells, and figure out the answer. The truly great moments are when you preempt a question even before the smart people you work for ask it.  \n\nIn this way, seeing things as stocks becomes its own network effect: everyone in the in-group is inculcated with a similar (though -- it should be emphasized -- not identical) set of priorities and platonic ideals to seek out in the investment process. In doing this, you learn to think not only on behalf of yourself, but on behalf of other investors, and the meta-game is the process of trying to parse the blind spots of the players around you. Yes, this can result in a lot of group-think (and sometimes compounds into a bubble) but the combination of being right, being wrong, being wrong about others being right, and being right about others being wrong (and vice versa) is a kind of palliative against things getting too out of hand. Generally, the people who make the most amount of money are optimists with a streak of paranoia: PMs whose heads are in the clouds, with eyes that glance constantly over their shoulders. \n\nToward the end of the summer, I knew I wanted a job offer. The desire went beyond my aversion to McKinsey case studies (after what I’d learned through attrition, I had more confidence in my ability to tackle one) and had more to do with the fact that I loved the job. I began to think of it as a privatized form of journalism or history scholarship: you speak to experts, read primary and secondary research, scrutinize transcripts, and try to form a narrative that never existed before (with the added component, of course, of being sensitive to what other investors are thinking). So when I got an offer, near the end of August, I accepted immediately on the spot. \n\nBut now onto other things that were happening around the same time. \n\n### You Either Grok It Or You Don’t\nThe period of 2017-2018 also happened to coincide with the third wave of crypto hype -- the runup of Bitcoin from $1,500 to $19,000, and Ethereum to $200 to $1,200 (and back down again). I wish I could say that the combination of a job offer, a light course load, and the relative abandon of senior year created the ideal environment for me to start picking up white papers and getting into crypto. But quite the opposite: getting TradFi-pilled made me dubious of anything that threatened to disrupt the cushy world I had just entered. During senior year, I’d sometimes visit my colleagues at the office, where we’d spot the occasional appearance of an ICO promoter or Winklevoss twin on the CNBC-designated flatscreen TV in our trading room. We’d gaze in silent, baffled horror, like we were observing a natural disaster in a foreign country. \n\nWhen my colleagues and I did discuss crypto, it was mostly in an orthogonal (and subtly pessimistic) way: what would happen to the price of AMD and Nvidia stock when crypto ultimately crashed and demand for GPUs would plummet? Should we be shorting the public companies which were opportunistically appending “blockchain” to their name and business plans, but clearly had no prior bonafides in crypto (in retrospect, probably yes). Even among the TradFi people who bought Bitcoin and Ethereum, there was a degree of calculating opportunism -- the bubble would pop eventually, and the key was to sell before the crowd. \n\nWe didn’t grok. \n\nBut crypto wasn’t completely alien to me either. In June of 2017, right around the time I started my internship, I began getting a Ethereum-focused newsletter from my friend [Teo](https://twitter.com/teo_leibowitz) (who now works at Uniswap). I can’t recall exactly how I ended up on his mailing list -- I must’ve run into him on Columbia’s campus or at a nearby bar and expressed interest, but anyway, I do know that I got the first issue, sent out on Saturday, Jun 24, 2017 at 1:52 PM. The subject header: *Crypto Chat #1: Flash Crash, Visa, China, ICOs*. It began:\n\n> *Hello - hope this finds you well.*\n> *As I've become more and more involved in discussions around Ethereum (ETH) in past months, several of you have mentioned interest in some kind of regular newsletter sharing a roundup of thoughts/news, so here goes - please find attached.*\n\nWithin the newsletter was a breathtaking roundup of recent crypto news: the [GDAX flash crash](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/22/ethereum-price-crash-10-cents-gdax-exchange-after-multimillion-dollar-trade.html#:~:text=Ethereum%20briefly%20suffered%20a%20flash,The%20cryptocurrency%20later%20rebounded.), a Visa job posting for Ethereum developers, [the staggering 65 million dollar Status ICO](https://www.coindesk.com/ico-blues-status-raises-58-million-leaves-buyers-waiting). Recall, I was still learning how exactly an IPO works (plus how to judge and value one), so the new mechanics of the crypto economy were a bit too much for me to wrap my head around.  I opened Teo’s newsletters most weeks (they arrived at a steady near-weekly pace until October of 2018), but at best I skimmed them and at worst I raised my eyebrows and said to myself dubiously “well that shit’s crazy.”\n\nI had other opportunities to grok, and flubbed those too. Fall semester of senior year I went on a few dates with a Turkish grad student with a mining rig set up in his Morningside Heights apartment. The way he talked about Bitcoin and Ethereum was completely different from how I heard the media describe what was going on. He came from a country with a debased currency, an untrustworthy government, and ungreased payment rails. He had grown up on the internet, and foresaw an interlinked, nationless society governed by the will of networked users and executed by code. The way he talked about it sounded exciting -- the kind of thing some of my SaaS-happy colleagues would’ve been into. The only problem was that...well the place I’d just accepted a job offer from only invested in enterprises that were public companies. Bitcoin and Ethereum were just ideas, and their most prominent manifestations were failed ICOs that were beginning to attract the wrath of the SEC. \n\nBy the time I graduated in May 2018, both Bitcoin and Ethereum had fallen below the high prices that attracted snarky clickbait pieces from the New York Times. Which meant that I pretty much stopped wondering about cryptocurrency and what all the hype was about. And then I stepped into full-time TradFi, which is an animal of its own. \n\n### The Social Network\nOne thing I was never told about Wall Street is that it’s one giant social network. From the outside it looks like numbers, lines, and glittering abstraction, but from the inside it’s essentially a high school cafeteria. Reputations are brokered and leveraged for allocations in an IPO, lavish, well-attended lunches are sponsored by investment banks, and the myth of the anonymous whale are overblown: your traders can call up pretty much any other desk in the industry and figure out who just made a block trade in a stock you’re jockeying to buy. You will attend dinners, and have the opportunity to rub shoulders with management teams. Names of prolific or disgraced traders who pop up in Bloomberg and the Financial Times are usually one degree of separation away. No one is incognito, even if the charts make it look that way. \n\nThis is a digression, but a private theory I have about the wave of SPACs in 2020 is that they had less to do with macroeconomic trends (COVID, low interest rates) or microeconomic trends (investment banks who wanted to earn a nice fee) than they did with the simple compulsion to sustain the social network. People were bored at home, and wanted to feel important. So they all did SPACs. \n\nStock investors aren’t even the most aggressively social creatures; our bond-trading counterparts are even more outgoing. About a year into my job, in April of 2019, I looked at the IPO of TradeWeb, a digital trading network for fixed-income assets. I was shocked to discover that just 20% of bonds, treasuries, swaps, and derivatives are traded electronically. The remaining 80% are done on the phone, over fax, or during lunch and golf. This is partially due to the fact that many fixed income assets have shallow liquidity pools or trade infrequently. But there’s another reason too: the social network keeps people locked into the old way of doing things. \n\nAnother thing you begin to notice as a stock investor is that some of the companies you’re evaluating -- the VC-annointed, so-called disruptors who are changing the world and giving the incumbents a million reasons to be fearful at night -- are not actually that innovative. They’ve just figured out one bit of arbitrage (better advertising, better branding, more money from VCs, clever financial engineering) to realize staggering growth, with punt-the-proverbial-can-down-the-road promises about future profitability. \n\nThis is especially true in the fintech space, where you might see, for example, a digital lender sell off consolidated loans in the form a variable interest entity, thus sacrificing the cash flows from those loans--and thus, the long-term upside (and so, the very “innovative” digital lender will be stuck losing money until the FDIC throws it a bone and lets it get a banking license...but by then the marketing dollars will have dried up so the growth will have slowed, and the earnings multiple will compress). Or you might see other forms of arbitrage, like an insure-tech company that gets its customer foothold in low-competition fields like renter’s insurance...but is forced to fight against high churn and low retention (which is why there’s so little competition in those fields -- you probably don’t want that customer to begin with). Or a home iBuyer that promises faster selling times...all in exchange for commission fees that are roughly double the industry average (and in a home-buying environment where homes sell at a staggering velocity without the need for an iBuyer to begin with). Just fun, late-stage growth stuff. \n\nNow to be clear, I’m not saying that new public companies aren’t doing exciting and innovative things -- there are plenty of companies in biotechnology, data warehousing, web security, eCommerce, and retail that are delighting their customers and doing wildly great things. And even those fintechs have better customer service, and sometimes better APYs and lending rates than their more established rivals. But at the end of the day, everyone is subservient to the same master business model, and a lot of things that look like real change are just shiny skin-grafts atop the old way of doing things.  \n\nUnderstanding this was one part of why finance began to feel a little ridiculous to me. And the understanding was by no means instantaneous; it took me a little over a year and a half before I started recognizing the skin-graft business model. But once you see it, you can’t unsee it: you’ll look deep in the unconsolidated section of a company’s balance sheet, or maybe just glance at the sales and marketing expenses (if this product is really better, why do they need to spend 90% of revenue on S+M?) and begin to question whether what you’re being pitched is actually all that world-changing, or if you’ve just been seduced by the accoutrements of Wall Street life (nice lunches, smooth-talking management teams, brassy salespeople etc.). Of course, there are plenty of people who see all of this and love Wall Street for other reasons: the constant challenge and sense that you’re learning something every moment, being surrounded by brilliant people, the game of it all, and yes, the money. And of course, I enjoyed all of this...but I still couldn’t get beyond the skin-grafting.   \n\nAt the beginning of 2020, I had a number of ideas that I wanted to try after TradFi. Most of the things on my list involved more creativity than being a stock analyst: I was weighing the idea of either returning to my film roots and working in production, or doing a bunch of coding bootcamps and trying to work in game design. I played a ton of games as a kid (Maplestory, The Sims, Runescape, and Civilization were some of my favorites), and my job had given me a fresh pair of eyes through which to view the various incentives and nuances at play when you orient people around mercenary goals. Between my love for devising narratives and the quantitative bent I’d picked up over the past few years, I thought that it might be worth trying out game development. In the time since graduation, I’d taught myself some coding basics but never sat down to undergo the requisite brain-attrition necessary to actually be proficient. Anyway, at the beginning of 2020, I had tentative plans to leave my job by the summer of 2020 -- exactly three years since the start of my 2017 internship -- and try something new. \n\nAnd then a pandemic happened.\n\n### It’s All A Game \nSo, March 2020. COVID-19 is officially a national crisis. In the realm of finance, the Dow plunged 26%, the Vix spiked all the way up to 83, and in a panic I withdrew 50% of my stock portfolio from the market. On March 16th, 2020 my entire team called in for our first work-from-home 9am call, and spent about half the time speculating about when New York would reach herd immunity and the other half discussing what stocks we should buy when the pandemic ended (perhaps a testament to our enduring optimism). Stocks continued to plummet through the end of March, and then began their staggering, unprecedented recovery (thank you, Federal Reserve).\n\nUnbeknownst to me, similar stress tests were unfolding in crypto: Bitcoin fell 50%, and the crash of Ethereum set off a chain reaction of pricing oracle lags, surging gas prices, [decentralized exchange liquidations](https://medium.com/aave/crypto-black-thursday-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-7f2acebf2b83), and [the Maker debt auction](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/agenda-discussion-scientific-governance-and-risk-tuesday-march-17-9am-pst-4-00-pm-utc/1630/7) (on the bright side, Hayden Adams popped onto Twitter [to chirpily inform people](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1238457224214786048) that Uniswap achieved a then-record amount of volume). Months later, when I finally started seriously getting into crypto (and to be honest, specifically Ethereum), I spent hours reading Medium posts, Twitter threads, and forums, unearthing lore across the ecosystem, and reliving not only the drama of March 2020, but sagas from the past decade. This is another instance where having majored in history really helped me: it’s just that my sources expanded beyond library archives and into stuff like blogs, DAO forums, Discord servers, and Etherscan transactions. \n\nAnyway, back to Spring 2020. If Wall Street felt like a game before, this sense got further compounded when the sexiness and thrill of conferences and hand-shaking were stripped away, and all we were left with were Bloomberg terminal windows and Zoom meetings. In other words, the skin-graft of Wall Street itself was lifted. While the actual content of work was certainly getting more interesting -- markets and the narratives that animated them were being rewritten on a daily basis --- the substance of everyday life was, perhaps unsurprisingly, quite banal. Everything was unfolding on the interface-layer, on the screen, like a videogame. \n\nI still remember why and when I started reading about crypto again. Every Sunday, I’d send out an email to my colleagues with a roundup of news related to stocks and trade ideas we’ve been discussing. On May 31st, 2020, I included [a link to a New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/business/media/new-model-celebrity.html) about Cameo, Patreon, and Substack -- one of the first mainstream pieces I’d read codifying the “creator economy” as a real force in the market. The Times also linked to a bunch of articles -- including [a few](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/) [by Li Jin](https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/), which brought me to the a16z website, which (after the relentless hyperlink-clicking that I tend to do) [landed me on a podcast](https://a16z.com/2020/05/26/a16z-podcast-new-fan-engagement-models-for-athletes-and-influencers/) with Jeff Jordan, Jesse Walden, Zoran Basich and the NBA player Spencer Dinwiddie. Spencer, a point guard with the Brooklyn Nets, was planning on tokenizing a portion of his three-year contract with the team, in an effort to receive more of his income upfront. What struck me about the podcast was the way Spencer articulated crypto as a unique enabler of an internet of value -- a way to create liquidity in an idiosyncratic pool of assets underpinned both by monetary worth and personal affinity. For the first time, crypto started to make sense, despite his occasional drops of industry lingo (Eth2, Polkadot, Tezos) that I still wasn’t totally familiar with. \n\nFrom the podcast, I clicked on [Jesse Walden’s](https://a16z.com/author/jesse-walden/) name, which led me to his author page where I landed on his (then) most recent article: [“Crypto’s Business Model is Familiar. What Isn’t is Who Benefits.”](https://a16z.com/2020/04/08/crypto-network-effects/) This piece was another crucial unlock for me. In it, Jesse described a system I was much more familiar with: network effects. But Jesse wasn’t just talking about the networked models I had grown familiar with as a stock analyst (Uber, Facebook/Instagram, Twilio, Wall Street life itself, etc.), but actually drawing analogies between Web 2.0 companies and their crypto counterparts. I hadn’t yet heard of Compound or Uniswap, but I knew about LendingClub and Coinbase, and what Jesse was describing seemed to be a far fairer model for organizing a business and aligning incentives. As Jesse writes in the piece: “[t]he principal innovation of crypto networks is their ability to grow network effects by enabling users to share in the value they create.” \n\nTo those already in the crypto space, this might seem like the most obvious observation in the world. ***Of course*** web3 protocols need users, and of course those users are attracted to networks with the deepest liquidity pools and most attractive incentives. But for someone who, up until that point, didn’t really grasp that actual businesses were being built on top of decentralized blockchains like Ethereum, this was an absolute revelation. The way I’d seen crypto written about by mainstream media tended to focus on cryptocurrencies as assets and investments -- but Jesse’s piece went a layer deeper and looked at crypto at the layer of ERC-20 tokens and business models. \n\nThat was a major turning point for me. Starting in June 2020, I began to follow the space a bit more closely. I began checking Coindesk and other crypto-focused news sites, and tracked the wave of token drops and liquidity-mining incentives that were picking up momentum. Admittedly, the significance of DeFi Summer ([the launch of the Compound](https://www.coindesk.com/compounds-comp-token-price-doubles-amid-defi-mania) and [Balancer](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-platform-balancer-bal-token-distribution-compound-comp) tokens, rampant yield farming, and [TVL reaching nearly $8 billion by the end of August](https://news.bitcoin.com/total-value-locked-in-defi-jumped-83-in-august-8-billion-in-assets-held/)) was actually a little lost on me. I assumed that everything that was going on was simply a continuation from the 2017-2018 hype cycle, rather than (as it now seems) a genuine shift forward in the energy and momentum of the industry. Still, I felt like things were different than they were two years prior. By the time the UNI token dropped in September 2020, I was beginning to develop a suspicion that tokens might one day shift the nature of traditional capital markets as well. \n\nIf users are given tokens, early investors are offered liquidity faster, and outsiders are given the opportunity to buy-in, is there a future where the need for traditional capital markets is reduced or rendered obsolete completely? Clearly, we’re still in a very early phase of this (and a large number of tokens dropped today have nebulous utility), but it does seem possible that with everything shifting upstream in the realm of finance (DeFi, token drops, faster and more-efficient asset trading), everything downstream will begin to adjust as well. The model of Uniswap loomed in my head when the Coinbase S1 dropped in February of this year. A decentralized exchange is running head-to-head in daily volume and revenue with a centralized leviathan valued at several magnitudes more -- and that leviathan has over a thousand employees, and likely lower margins (note: this should not be read as a knock against Coinbase which has a much more diverse business: an institutional segment, [a nascent debit card](https://www.coinbase.com/card) and [high-yield interest account](https://www.coinbase.com/lend), a much larger compliance/legal team, an investing arm, a strategic affiliation with USDC, a much more diverse balance sheet, etc...but still, the rise of Uniswap is truly staggering). It raises the question: how many more industries can crypto disrupt, when decentralized protocols replace employees and overhead costs, and value can instead be shared with users and stakeholders? \n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself. In October of 2020, my friend [Nikita](https://twitter.com/singareddynm) invited me and a bunch of mutual friends to spend the month in a house in Maine. While there, I met [Reggie](https://twitter.com/HipCityReg), who was getting even deeper into crypto than I was. I had only been reading the articles and token drop announcements -- Reggie was investing, reading white papers, swapping tokens, yield farming, and just generally ***living*** in it (in addition to all of that, he’s also the CEO of an avatar social network company called Eternal). Anyway, the trip was the extra push I needed to begin seriously thinking about leaving my current job (I’d put that plan on temporary hiatus because of the pandemic). I was surrounded by people in various stages of mid-20’s self-discovery: everyone was either accepting a new position, about to quit a job, applying to grad school, launching an angel fund, raising money for a startup, working in VC, [or working](https://twitter.com/_TamaraWinter) [for Stripe](https://twitter.com/orbuch). As a stock analyst I didn’t quite feel like a vampire squid, but I did feel a little like a barnacle -- hanging on the outer rim of life but not really participating in it substantially. The trip truly changed my life in a lot of ways -- I met people who loved their work, were optimistic about tech, and felt a clear sense of responsibility about the direction of the industry. \n\nWhen I got back from the trip, I started really diving into crypto. I read the Ethereum White Paper for the first time (I know, I know, it took me awhile!). I discovered MEV; in fact, when I read the paper [“Flash Boys 2.0: Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and Consensus Instability in Decentralized Exchanges\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf), it was the first time I felt like I really understood how smart contracts work and orders are processed on the blockchain (what that paper does really well is highlight how the Ethereum network functions by exposing points of arbitrage). I started doing research and buying currencies and tokens -- trying to assess their businesses the way I evaluate a stock (once you start seeing things as stocks, anything is up for fair valuation). I [discovered NFTs that I love](https://twitter.com/VirtualElena/status/1389377447402033155), and met people like [Toby Shorin](https://twitter.com/tobyshorin) and [John Palmer](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer) who had been doing work in the industry for a few years. \n\nIn late January, I was still at the firm, but had already told my boss I was starting to look for new positions. I was already quietly buzzing with excitement about crypto, and was also jazzed by a few other personal projects I had just worked on (including messing a bit around with Unity and learning a bit of C#). That entire month had a kind of “crossing-the-Rubicon” valence to it. Between finally making it to 2021, the storm on the Capitol, and the promise of vaccines on the horizon, it seemed like the world was reconstituting itself. \n\nStill, like everyone else at my job, in finance, and probably most people in the country, I was completely shocked to watch what happened in the final few weeks of January when Gamestop rose roughly 750% in the span of a few days, invigorated by the forces of Reddit. Among my colleagues, the reaction was a mix of fear, awe, and self-protection. Chief among the concerns: could one of our positions be next (a new neologism: “Don’t short something if r/WallStreetBets is about to send it to the moon. You will get rekt”). Over the next few days, our outlook evolved: by January 28th we had a deeper grasp of the months-long leadup to the saga. RoaringKitty had sowed the seeds for months on YouTube and the idea had been percolating for awhile on Reddit. This realization prompted a more nuanced discussion about the way the average retail investor was a lot more sophisticated than the elite Wall Streeter gives them credit for. \n\nr/WallStreet bets had illuminated something: everyone was now playing the same game, mediated by the same interface. COVID rendered us all crouched, behind screens, contending to steer the same pools of capital in different directions. I think institutional Wall Street is afraid for a reason that’s even more intrinsic than the idea of being liquidated or margin-called. The game that we’d spent decades perfecting and protecting for a select group of insiders was now open to anyone. A great incursion on the social network was unfolding for everyone to witness. The funhouse culmination of Metcalfe’s law. \n\nI believe crypto only intensifies that. Capital can now move at the same pace of online thought. Jesse Walden even hinted at that in the first article of his that I read: “We can now move bits of value in the way we move bits of information: using an open standard, in very granular transmissions, instantly, to anyone, anywhere in the world.” That ability will change everything. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e0065b2b-dd1e-411b-bd11-87a515588576.jpg?height=311&width=577)\n\n### Describing the Present \nEveryone’s journey down the crypto rabbit-hole is deeply personal to them. Mine is an amalgamation of my work in finance and investing, my private anxieties around whether I gave film enough of a shot (and underpinning that, a desire to make the act of creating art easier and more financially viable for my friends who were brave enough to go all-in), my personal tendencies toward light iconoclasm, my delight in uncertainty, and my desire to make the world a fairer, more economically just place. I think most people in crypto share some array of these traits, and have their own motivations as well. I think the key is finding the unlock for each person, and introducing them to crypto that way.\n\nMy dad began to grasp Ethereum after I suggested he read the white paper; as a lawyer, he immediately grokked the idea of immutable smart contracts. I’ve started a consulting gig with a resale and limited-run goods startup on a social token rewards system, and our conversations have centered around unifying the values of buyers, sellers, and creating relationships that endure beyond a transaction. Given the pace of sell-side notes, investment bank-hosted webinars, and recent high-profile announcements of potential TradFi-DeFi alliances ([Compound Treasury, for example](https://medium.com/compound-finance/announcing-compound-treasury-for-businesses-institutions-83d4484fb82e)) I think Wall Street is beginning to wake up to the indelible momentum of crypto as well.\n \nIn my final weeks as a stock analyst, I pitched Ethereum, Uniswap, and MakerDAO as long positions to my colleagues (though no one bought...yet). We had numerous discussions around the promises of crypto, and what various crypto-native business models might look like. [Marc Rubenstein’s](https://twitter.com/MarcRuby) excellent [Reinventing The Financial System post](https://www.netinterest.co/p/reinventing-the-financial-system) about MakerDAO was the catalyst for a thorough, long-winding conversation about the fractional reserve banking system, and the way loans underpin the financial industry. I think my former teammates were surprised to hear that crypto could be used as a means to issue a dollar-backed stablecoin, and that a blockchain-based issuer could also begin to do work in new segments like [real-world-asset-backed loans](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/real-world-finance). While MakerDAO’s initial pool of RWA loans is quite small (just under [~4m in total loans outstanding today](https://duneanalytics.com/queries/38282/75752)), it’s easy to see this scaling into a much larger operation (which [could help diversify their collateral base away from USDC](https://daistats.com/)). These are early signs that crypto has the potential to grow to touch more than just value-exchange online. \n\nIt’s still so early for everything. A few nights ago, I went back and re-read some of the first messages I sent with the Turkish grad student from 2017. I wanted to revisit what I was really thinking about cryptocurrencies at the time. Our messages began in September, just a few weeks after my post-internship job offer. This part in particular stuck out to me:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d87d30d1-c279-453e-8e65-d716bd26d23b.jpeg?height=523&width=665)\n\nEssentially, I was asking -- how can Bitcoin (or Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency) scale without the kind of leverage and rehypothecation that we see in traditional financial markets? In my own words “*Bitcoin (or the blockchain) can’t replicate the international banking system we have where money and ‘value’ is basically manufactured through securitization and other fancy financial instruments.*” Obviously, I was not anticipating DeFi. As I said in the second message “*I’ve noticed that tech people are usually way more imaginative.*” I was right about that. DeFi had a little under $2bn in TVL a year ago and now sits [just above $50bn in TVL today](https://defipulse.com/) (and much more if you include blockchains like Solana and Binance)  -- a staggering amount of growth. \n\nWhile you might argue that DeFi encourages some degree of reckless over-speculation, overleveraged trading, and is artificially inflating the value of certain crypto-assets today, I actually don’t think that matters longer-term. For one, price action in the industry serves as a form of advertising, and an early engine of innovation (Chris Dixon and Eddy Lazzarin [had a good post that examined this phenomenon](https://a16z.com/2020/05/15/the-crypto-price-innovation-cycle/) with respect to the price of Bitcoin, but the same is likely true if you map in assets like Ethereum or Solana). Even if certain assets fluctuate today (and those fluctuations are intensified by leverage), the overall impact of getting more people interested in crypto is a positive counterweight to any near-term mania (though yes, it does suck for the people who lose a lot of money). \n\nAnd even if DeFi and yield farming is creating nearer-term hype, it’s also illuminating the greater promise of crypto in general: the idea that if you eliminate middlemen and share value with users of a protocol instead, the positive externalities are so great that crypto can start behaving like a public good. Grants issued by groups like Uniswap and the Ethereum Foundation are an early indication of this. And this isn’t confined to just DeFi; NFT projects allow creators and collectors to share in the value of art created by eliminating (or at the very least, reducing the take rate) of middlemen, while encoding an enduring revenue stream for the originator of a specific work. Hopefully we’ll soon see ways to map this model onto other scalable operations, like music and other forms of entertainment, DAOs that own real estate, and maybe a blockchain-based Uber. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b229174b-6b68-48b8-8a23-7567eb750663.jpeg?height=259&width=460)\n\nThe “seeing things as stocks” mindset that was first inculcated in me four years ago will likely need to be reframed. In the future, public companies may see no separation between users, employees, and shareholders. In fact, “public companies” as we understand them today may not even exist, as they will have issued tokens at an earlier stage, and might not even IPO. While I realize I’m now violating my favorite neologism (“Don’t try to predict the future. Try to describe the present.”), I think we have early signals that this could come to pass. Everything from the increased focus [on DAO treasury management](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-daos-should-approach-treasury) to aforementioned efforts to collateralize real-world-assets with DeFi indicate that the need to tap public markets for capital may recede (it’s also quite possible that public markets and TradFi in general are reshaped from within by crypto, in ways that I’m not yet imagining, and they continue to endure in a revitalized form). Of course, there are tons of uncertainties here: the continued pace of user adoption, and regulatory overhangs are two big ones. \n\nMostly, I’m just unabashedly optimistic, for all the reasons I outlined above. In the four years since I first started paying attention to crypto, the industry has transitioned into an instrument of genuine value creation. I’ve met so many people in the past year who have inspired and galvanized me -- and my only hope is that I can contribute to an industry that I believe will revolutionize the way we live, both online and in the physical world. \n\nUsually when I write an essay, I start with the concluding paragraph already written, at least in my head. I tend to begin already knowing what I want the lesson to be. This is one of the few exceptions -- an hour before publishing this, I’m sitting on the couch in my living room, trying to figure out the best way to bring both the past four years of my professional life, and the promise of crypto to some kind of satisfying finale. And I’m realizing that it’s probably an impossible task to achieve in writing. Because with crypto, you just have to live it. So now I’m off to go do that. \n\n*Thanks to early readers of this essay: Andrew, Jeremy, Keeks, Reggie, Tarun, and Toby.* \n\n*Also boundless thanks to the builders, writers, thinkers, tinkerers, and visionaries who have made their work available on everything from Github to blogs to forums to Discord messages. All of your contributions have made me, and numerous others so excited to be a part of this space.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1626103240, "digest": "LhhX4X9omlNNhAo5oKT0pmoGTiI3z9VIZ_J3onkmlTo", "contributor": "0x03942174b8E362D168e5C26d9b4339ab36D970b0"}

(or...Why I’m leaving TradFi for Crypto) ", "body": "\n### It’s All Stocks\nA portfolio manager I used to work with once remarked that if you stay in finance for long enough, you begin to see everything as a stock. When I first heard this, as an intern at an investment firm in 2017, it seemed like one of those Wall Street neologisms that sound true, but don’t **feel** true until you’ve lived them firsthand (other neologisms that fall under this category: “Don’t short on valuation”, “Don’t short on competition”, and my personal favorite: “Don’t try to predict the future. Try to describe the present”). This particular piece of wisdom was palpable almost immediately: in August of 2017, I drove to the Hamptons with some friends and realized that the PM who said that everything looked like a stock had a long or short position in half of the retailers occupying the strip malls along the Southhampton Bypass. In finance, even a trip to the beach is a quest for alpha. \n\nThe 2017 internship turned into a job offer, which turned into a full time position in 2018 after I graduated from college. I felt luckier than a lot of my peers who spent senior year either cramming for McKinsey case studies or lamenting because they doubted they had the quantitative skills to even attempt one. Before the summer of 2017, I probably would’ve put myself in the latter camp: a history major who only did theater, film, and journalism in college. But the internship taught me that you can learn any quantitative skill on the job, by sheer force of attrition. Someone will ask you for the diluted share count of an upcoming IPO, or to input a company’s EBITDA into an earnings model (which raises other questions, like what is depreciation and amortization, and how do you use Excel?), or might say to you “yes, gross margins are 50% ***right now***, but what happens when GMs reach 65%, and S&M spend falls to 30% of revenue, and Trump manages to pass corporate tax cuts? How much are they earning ***then***?” Early on in my internship, it might take me an hour to figure out what question I was even being asked, and another few hours to answer it. But over time -- through attrition -- the concepts fall into place. And then you begin to start seeing everything as a stock. \n\nIn the initial phase, “seeing stocks'' might just mean the sudden realization that the vast majority of items and systems you interact with on a daily basis are actually public companies. This understanding gets augmented even further when the above concepts (diluted shares, EBITDA, tax cuts) get layered in, and you begin to think of companies as their own little organisms: sentient income statements with hopes and dreams that evolve with every quarter. Then, the companies begin to talk to each other: you have a laser component company over here, and a global OEM powerhouse over there, and a Chinese phone manufacturer somewhere else, and a smorgasbord of social camera apps, and with all of that information you might ask yourself something like: where is the 3D imaging industry heading? If you were to peer inside the brain of a truly great portfolio manager it would look a bit like a timelapse of a rapidly industrializing metropolis. A single question about the destiny of 3D imaging would be the launching pad for a mental model around the P+L of dozens of companies, implications for global supply chains, and assumptions around how consumer behavior will continue to evolve. Change one input, and the other variables will instantly recalibrate. \n\nThe most exciting thing about investing (or learning something new in general) are the moments where your own brain surprises you. A few weeks into the internship, I pitched my first stock. A couple days later, I was writing up earnings calls. Even though I definitely didn’t understand everything I was hearing, I realized that writing was a great way to interrogate where the gaps in my knowledge actually were: moments where the logic didn’t compute or my ideas failed to flow seamlessly into the next were clearly places where I needed to do more research. In a short amount of time, no one needs to ask you “What happens when GMs reach 65%?” because the question automatically populates itself in your brain (and then you want to know what happens when gross margins reach 70%, 80% and 85%), and you can pipe over to Excel, change some cells, and figure out the answer. The truly great moments are when you preempt a question even before the smart people you work for ask it.  \n\nIn this way, seeing things as stocks becomes its own network effect: everyone in the in-group is inculcated with a similar (though -- it should be emphasized -- not identical) set of priorities and platonic ideals to seek out in the investment process. In doing this, you learn to think not only on behalf of yourself, but on behalf of other investors, and the meta-game is the process of trying to parse the blind spots of the players around you. Yes, this can result in a lot of group-think (and sometimes compounds into a bubble) but the combination of being right, being wrong, being wrong about others being right, and being right about others being wrong (and vice versa) is a kind of palliative against things getting too out of hand. Generally, the people who make the most amount of money are optimists with a streak of paranoia: PMs whose heads are in the clouds, with eyes that glance constantly over their shoulders. \n\nToward the end of the summer, I knew I wanted a job offer. The desire went beyond my aversion to McKinsey case studies (after what I’d learned through attrition, I had more confidence in my ability to tackle one) and had more to do with the fact that I loved the job. I began to think of it as a privatized form of journalism or history scholarship: you speak to experts, read primary and secondary research, scrutinize transcripts, and try to form a narrative that never existed before (with the added component, of course, of being sensitive to what other investors are thinking). So when I got an offer, near the end of August, I accepted immediately on the spot. \n\nBut now onto other things that were happening around the same time. \n\n### You Either Grok It Or You Don’t\nThe period of 2017-2018 also happened to coincide with the third wave of crypto hype -- the runup of Bitcoin from $1,500 to $19,000, and Ethereum to $200 to $1,200 (and back down again). I wish I could say that the combination of a job offer, a light course load, and the relative abandon of senior year created the ideal environment for me to start picking up white papers and getting into crypto. But quite the opposite: getting TradFi-pilled made me dubious of anything that threatened to disrupt the cushy world I had just entered. During senior year, I’d sometimes visit my colleagues at the office, where we’d spot the occasional appearance of an ICO promoter or Winklevoss twin on the CNBC-designated flatscreen TV in our trading room. We’d gaze in silent, baffled horror, like we were observing a natural disaster in a foreign country. \n\nWhen my colleagues and I did discuss crypto, it was mostly in an orthogonal (and subtly pessimistic) way: what would happen to the price of AMD and Nvidia stock when crypto ultimately crashed and demand for GPUs would plummet? Should we be shorting the public companies which were opportunistically appending “blockchain” to their name and business plans, but clearly had no prior bonafides in crypto (in retrospect, probably yes). Even among the TradFi people who bought Bitcoin and Ethereum, there was a degree of calculating opportunism -- the bubble would pop eventually, and the key was to sell before the crowd. \n\nWe didn’t grok. \n\nBut crypto wasn’t completely alien to me either. In June of 2017, right around the time I started my internship, I began getting a Ethereum-focused newsletter from my friend [Teo](https://twitter.com/teo_leibowitz) (who now works at Uniswap). I can’t recall exactly how I ended up on his mailing list -- I must’ve run into him on Columbia’s campus or at a nearby bar and expressed interest, but anyway, I do know that I got the first issue, sent out on Saturday, Jun 24, 2017 at 1:52 PM. The subject header: *Crypto Chat #1: Flash Crash, Visa, China, ICOs*. It began:\n\n> *Hello - hope this finds you well.*\n> *As I've become more and more involved in discussions around Ethereum (ETH) in past months, several of you have mentioned interest in some kind of regular newsletter sharing a roundup of thoughts/news, so here goes - please find attached.*\n\nWithin the newsletter was a breathtaking roundup of recent crypto news: the [GDAX flash crash](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/22/ethereum-price-crash-10-cents-gdax-exchange-after-multimillion-dollar-trade.html#:~:text=Ethereum%20briefly%20suffered%20a%20flash,The%20cryptocurrency%20later%20rebounded.), a Visa job posting for Ethereum developers, [the staggering 65 million dollar Status ICO](https://www.coindesk.com/ico-blues-status-raises-58-million-leaves-buyers-waiting). Recall, I was still learning how exactly an IPO works (plus how to judge and value one), so the new mechanics of the crypto economy were a bit too much for me to wrap my head around.  I opened Teo’s newsletters most weeks (they arrived at a steady near-weekly pace until October of 2018), but at best I skimmed them and at worst I raised my eyebrows and said to myself dubiously “well that shit’s crazy.”\n\nI had other opportunities to grok, and flubbed those too. Fall semester of senior year I went on a few dates with a Turkish grad student with a mining rig set up in his Morningside Heights apartment. The way he talked about Bitcoin and Ethereum was completely different from how I heard the media describe what was going on. He came from a country with a debased currency, an untrustworthy government, and ungreased payment rails. He had grown up on the internet, and foresaw an interlinked, nationless society governed by the will of networked users and executed by code. The way he talked about it sounded exciting -- the kind of thing some of my SaaS-happy colleagues would’ve been into. The only problem was that...well the place I’d just accepted a job offer from only invested in enterprises that were public companies. Bitcoin and Ethereum were just ideas, and their most prominent manifestations were failed ICOs that were beginning to attract the wrath of the SEC. \n\nBy the time I graduated in May 2018, both Bitcoin and Ethereum had fallen below the high prices that attracted snarky clickbait pieces from the New York Times. Which meant that I pretty much stopped wondering about cryptocurrency and what all the hype was about. And then I stepped into full-time TradFi, which is an animal of its own. \n\n### The Social Network\nOne thing I was never told about Wall Street is that it’s one giant social network. From the outside it looks like numbers, lines, and glittering abstraction, but from the inside it’s essentially a high school cafeteria. Reputations are brokered and leveraged for allocations in an IPO, lavish, well-attended lunches are sponsored by investment banks, and the myth of the anonymous whale are overblown: your traders can call up pretty much any other desk in the industry and figure out who just made a block trade in a stock you’re jockeying to buy. You will attend dinners, and have the opportunity to rub shoulders with management teams. Names of prolific or disgraced traders who pop up in Bloomberg and the Financial Times are usually one degree of separation away. No one is incognito, even if the charts make it look that way. \n\nThis is a digression, but a private theory I have about the wave of SPACs in 2020 is that they had less to do with macroeconomic trends (COVID, low interest rates) or microeconomic trends (investment banks who wanted to earn a nice fee) than they did with the simple compulsion to sustain the social network. People were bored at home, and wanted to feel important. So they all did SPACs. \n\nStock investors aren’t even the most aggressively social creatures; our bond-trading counterparts are even more outgoing. About a year into my job, in April of 2019, I looked at the IPO of TradeWeb, a digital trading network for fixed-income assets. I was shocked to discover that just 20% of bonds, treasuries, swaps, and derivatives are traded electronically. The remaining 80% are done on the phone, over fax, or during lunch and golf. This is partially due to the fact that many fixed income assets have shallow liquidity pools or trade infrequently. But there’s another reason too: the social network keeps people locked into the old way of doing things. \n\nAnother thing you begin to notice as a stock investor is that some of the companies you’re evaluating -- the VC-annointed, so-called disruptors who are changing the world and giving the incumbents a million reasons to be fearful at night -- are not actually that innovative. They’ve just figured out one bit of arbitrage (better advertising, better branding, more money from VCs, clever financial engineering) to realize staggering growth, with punt-the-proverbial-can-down-the-road promises about future profitability. \n\nThis is especially true in the fintech space, where you might see, for example, a digital lender sell off consolidated loans in the form a variable interest entity, thus sacrificing the cash flows from those loans--and thus, the long-term upside (and so, the very “innovative” digital lender will be stuck losing money until the FDIC throws it a bone and lets it get a banking license...but by then the marketing dollars will have dried up so the growth will have slowed, and the earnings multiple will compress). Or you might see other forms of arbitrage, like an insure-tech company that gets its customer foothold in low-competition fields like renter’s insurance...but is forced to fight against high churn and low retention (which is why there’s so little competition in those fields -- you probably don’t want that customer to begin with). Or a home iBuyer that promises faster selling times...all in exchange for commission fees that are roughly double the industry average (and in a home-buying environment where homes sell at a staggering velocity without the need for an iBuyer to begin with). Just fun, late-stage growth stuff. \n\nNow to be clear, I’m not saying that new public companies aren’t doing exciting and innovative things -- there are plenty of companies in biotechnology, data warehousing, web security, eCommerce, and retail that are delighting their customers and doing wildly great things. And even those fintechs have better customer service, and sometimes better APYs and lending rates than their more established rivals. But at the end of the day, everyone is subservient to the same master business model, and a lot of things that look like real change are just shiny skin-grafts atop the old way of doing things.  \n\nUnderstanding this was one part of why finance began to feel a little ridiculous to me. And the understanding was by no means instantaneous; it took me a little over a year and a half before I started recognizing the skin-graft business model. But once you see it, you can’t unsee it: you’ll look deep in the unconsolidated section of a company’s balance sheet, or maybe just glance at the sales and marketing expenses (if this product is really better, why do they need to spend 90% of revenue on S+M?) and begin to question whether what you’re being pitched is actually all that world-changing, or if you’ve just been seduced by the accoutrements of Wall Street life (nice lunches, smooth-talking management teams, brassy salespeople etc.). Of course, there are plenty of people who see all of this and love Wall Street for other reasons: the constant challenge and sense that you’re learning something every moment, being surrounded by brilliant people, the game of it all, and yes, the money. And of course, I enjoyed all of this...but I still couldn’t get beyond the skin-grafting.   \n\nAt the beginning of 2020, I had a number of ideas that I wanted to try after TradFi. Most of the things on my list involved more creativity than being a stock analyst: I was weighing the idea of either returning to my film roots and working in production, or doing a bunch of coding bootcamps and trying to work in game design. I played a ton of games as a kid (Maplestory, The Sims, Runescape, and Civilization were some of my favorites), and my job had given me a fresh pair of eyes through which to view the various incentives and nuances at play when you orient people around mercenary goals. Between my love for devising narratives and the quantitative bent I’d picked up over the past few years, I thought that it might be worth trying out game development. In the time since graduation, I’d taught myself some coding basics but never sat down to undergo the requisite brain-attrition necessary to actually be proficient. Anyway, at the beginning of 2020, I had tentative plans to leave my job by the summer of 2020 -- exactly three years since the start of my 2017 internship -- and try something new. \n\nAnd then a pandemic happened.\n\n### It’s All A Game \nSo, March 2020. COVID-19 is officially a national crisis. In the realm of finance, the Dow plunged 26%, the Vix spiked all the way up to 83, and in a panic I withdrew 50% of my stock portfolio from the market. On March 16th, 2020 my entire team called in for our first work-from-home 9am call, and spent about half the time speculating about when New York would reach herd immunity and the other half discussing what stocks we should buy when the pandemic ended (perhaps a testament to our enduring optimism). Stocks continued to plummet through the end of March, and then began their staggering, unprecedented recovery (thank you, Federal Reserve).\n\nUnbeknownst to me, similar stress tests were unfolding in crypto: Bitcoin fell 50%, and the crash of Ethereum set off a chain reaction of pricing oracle lags, surging gas prices, [decentralized exchange liquidations](https://medium.com/aave/crypto-black-thursday-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-7f2acebf2b83), and [the Maker debt auction](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/agenda-discussion-scientific-governance-and-risk-tuesday-march-17-9am-pst-4-00-pm-utc/1630/7) (on the bright side, Hayden Adams popped onto Twitter [to chirpily inform people](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1238457224214786048) that Uniswap achieved a then-record amount of volume). Months later, when I finally started seriously getting into crypto (and to be honest, specifically Ethereum), I spent hours reading Medium posts, Twitter threads, and forums, unearthing lore across the ecosystem, and reliving not only the drama of March 2020, but sagas from the past decade. This is another instance where having majored in history really helped me: it’s just that my sources expanded beyond library archives and into stuff like blogs, DAO forums, Discord servers, and Etherscan transactions. \n\nAnyway, back to Spring 2020. If Wall Street felt like a game before, this sense got further compounded when the sexiness and thrill of conferences and hand-shaking were stripped away, and all we were left with were Bloomberg terminal windows and Zoom meetings. In other words, the skin-graft of Wall Street itself was lifted. While the actual content of work was certainly getting more interesting -- markets and the narratives that animated them were being rewritten on a daily basis --- the substance of everyday life was, perhaps unsurprisingly, quite banal. Everything was unfolding on the interface-layer, on the screen, like a videogame. \n\nI still remember why and when I started reading about crypto again. Every Sunday, I’d send out an email to my colleagues with a roundup of news related to stocks and trade ideas we’ve been discussing. On May 31st, 2020, I included [a link to a New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/business/media/new-model-celebrity.html) about Cameo, Patreon, and Substack -- one of the first mainstream pieces I’d read codifying the “creator economy” as a real force in the market. The Times also linked to a bunch of articles -- including [a few](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/) [by Li Jin](https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/), which brought me to the a16z website, which (after the relentless hyperlink-clicking that I tend to do) [landed me on a podcast](https://a16z.com/2020/05/26/a16z-podcast-new-fan-engagement-models-for-athletes-and-influencers/) with Jeff Jordan, Jesse Walden, Zoran Basich and the NBA player Spencer Dinwiddie. Spencer, a point guard with the Brooklyn Nets, was planning on tokenizing a portion of his three-year contract with the team, in an effort to receive more of his income upfront. What struck me about the podcast was the way Spencer articulated crypto as a unique enabler of an internet of value -- a way to create liquidity in an idiosyncratic pool of assets underpinned both by monetary worth and personal affinity. For the first time, crypto started to make sense, despite his occasional drops of industry lingo (Eth2, Polkadot, Tezos) that I still wasn’t totally familiar with. \n\nFrom the podcast, I clicked on [Jesse Walden’s](https://a16z.com/author/jesse-walden/) name, which led me to his author page where I landed on his (then) most recent article: [“Crypto’s Business Model is Familiar. What Isn’t is Who Benefits.”](https://a16z.com/2020/04/08/crypto-network-effects/) This piece was another crucial unlock for me. In it, Jesse described a system I was much more familiar with: network effects. But Jesse wasn’t just talking about the networked models I had grown familiar with as a stock analyst (Uber, Facebook/Instagram, Twilio, Wall Street life itself, etc.), but actually drawing analogies between Web 2.0 companies and their crypto counterparts. I hadn’t yet heard of Compound or Uniswap, but I knew about LendingClub and Coinbase, and what Jesse was describing seemed to be a far fairer model for organizing a business and aligning incentives. As Jesse writes in the piece: “[t]he principal innovation of crypto networks is their ability to grow network effects by enabling users to share in the value they create.” \n\nTo those already in the crypto space, this might seem like the most obvious observation in the world. ***Of course*** web3 protocols need users, and of course those users are attracted to networks with the deepest liquidity pools and most attractive incentives. But for someone who, up until that point, didn’t really grasp that actual businesses were being built on top of decentralized blockchains like Ethereum, this was an absolute revelation. The way I’d seen crypto written about by mainstream media tended to focus on cryptocurrencies as assets and investments -- but Jesse’s piece went a layer deeper and looked at crypto at the layer of ERC-20 tokens and business models. \n\nThat was a major turning point for me. Starting in June 2020, I began to follow the space a bit more closely. I began checking Coindesk and other crypto-focused news sites, and tracked the wave of token drops and liquidity-mining incentives that were picking up momentum. Admittedly, the significance of DeFi Summer ([the launch of the Compound](https://www.coindesk.com/compounds-comp-token-price-doubles-amid-defi-mania) and [Balancer](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-platform-balancer-bal-token-distribution-compound-comp) tokens, rampant yield farming, and [TVL reaching nearly $8 billion by the end of August](https://news.bitcoin.com/total-value-locked-in-defi-jumped-83-in-august-8-billion-in-assets-held/)) was actually a little lost on me. I assumed that everything that was going on was simply a continuation from the 2017-2018 hype cycle, rather than (as it now seems) a genuine shift forward in the energy and momentum of the industry. Still, I felt like things were different than they were two years prior. By the time the UNI token dropped in September 2020, I was beginning to develop a suspicion that tokens might one day shift the nature of traditional capital markets as well. \n\nIf users are given tokens, early investors are offered liquidity faster, and outsiders are given the opportunity to buy-in, is there a future where the need for traditional capital markets is reduced or rendered obsolete completely? Clearly, we’re still in a very early phase of this (and a large number of tokens dropped today have nebulous utility), but it does seem possible that with everything shifting upstream in the realm of finance (DeFi, token drops, faster and more-efficient asset trading), everything downstream will begin to adjust as well. The model of Uniswap loomed in my head when the Coinbase S1 dropped in February of this year. A decentralized exchange is running head-to-head in daily volume and revenue with a centralized leviathan valued at several magnitudes more -- and that leviathan has over a thousand employees, and likely lower margins (note: this should not be read as a knock against Coinbase which has a much more diverse business: an institutional segment, [a nascent debit card](https://www.coinbase.com/card) and [high-yield interest account](https://www.coinbase.com/lend), a much larger compliance/legal team, an investing arm, a strategic affiliation with USDC, a much more diverse balance sheet, etc...but still, the rise of Uniswap is truly staggering). It raises the question: how many more industries can crypto disrupt, when decentralized protocols replace employees and overhead costs, and value can instead be shared with users and stakeholders? \n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself. In October of 2020, my friend [Nikita](https://twitter.com/singareddynm) invited me and a bunch of mutual friends to spend the month in a house in Maine. While there, I met [Reggie](https://twitter.com/HipCityReg), who was getting even deeper into crypto than I was. I had only been reading the articles and token drop announcements -- Reggie was investing, reading white papers, swapping tokens, yield farming, and just generally ***living*** in it (in addition to all of that, he’s also the CEO of an avatar social network company called Eternal). Anyway, the trip was the extra push I needed to begin seriously thinking about leaving my current job (I’d put that plan on temporary hiatus because of the pandemic). I was surrounded by people in various stages of mid-20’s self-discovery: everyone was either accepting a new position, about to quit a job, applying to grad school, launching an angel fund, raising money for a startup, working in VC, [or working](https://twitter.com/_TamaraWinter) [for Stripe](https://twitter.com/orbuch). As a stock analyst I didn’t quite feel like a vampire squid, but I did feel a little like a barnacle -- hanging on the outer rim of life but not really participating in it substantially. The trip truly changed my life in a lot of ways -- I met people who loved their work, were optimistic about tech, and felt a clear sense of responsibility about the direction of the industry. \n\nWhen I got back from the trip, I started really diving into crypto. I read the Ethereum White Paper for the first time (I know, I know, it took me awhile!). I discovered MEV; in fact, when I read the paper [“Flash Boys 2.0: Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and Consensus Instability in Decentralized Exchanges\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf), it was the first time I felt like I really understood how smart contracts work and orders are processed on the blockchain (what that paper does really well is highlight how the Ethereum network functions by exposing points of arbitrage). I started doing research and buying currencies and tokens -- trying to assess their businesses the way I evaluate a stock (once you start seeing things as stocks, anything is up for fair valuation). I [discovered NFTs that I love](https://twitter.com/VirtualElena/status/1389377447402033155), and met people like [Toby Shorin](https://twitter.com/tobyshorin) and [John Palmer](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer) who had been doing work in the industry for a few years. \n\nIn late January, I was still at the firm, but had already told my boss I was starting to look for new positions. I was already quietly buzzing with excitement about crypto, and was also jazzed by a few other personal projects I had just worked on (including messing a bit around with Unity and learning a bit of C#). That entire month had a kind of “crossing-the-Rubicon” valence to it. Between finally making it to 2021, the storm on the Capitol, and the promise of vaccines on the horizon, it seemed like the world was reconstituting itself. \n\nStill, like everyone else at my job, in finance, and probably most people in the country, I was completely shocked to watch what happened in the final few weeks of January when Gamestop rose roughly 750% in the span of a few days, invigorated by the forces of Reddit. Among my colleagues, the reaction was a mix of fear, awe, and self-protection. Chief among the concerns: could one of our positions be next (a new neologism: “Don’t short something if r/WallStreetBets is about to send it to the moon. You will get rekt”). Over the next few days, our outlook evolved: by January 28th we had a deeper grasp of the months-long leadup to the saga. RoaringKitty had sowed the seeds for months on YouTube and the idea had been percolating for awhile on Reddit. This realization prompted a more nuanced discussion about the way the average retail investor was a lot more sophisticated than the elite Wall Streeter gives them credit for. \n\nr/WallStreet bets had illuminated something: everyone was now playing the same game, mediated by the same interface. COVID rendered us all crouched, behind screens, contending to steer the same pools of capital in different directions. I think institutional Wall Street is afraid for a reason that’s even more intrinsic than the idea of being liquidated or margin-called. The game that we’d spent decades perfecting and protecting for a select group of insiders was now open to anyone. A great incursion on the social network was unfolding for everyone to witness. The funhouse culmination of Metcalfe’s law. \n\nI believe crypto only intensifies that. Capital can now move at the same pace of online thought. Jesse Walden even hinted at that in the first article of his that I read: “We can now move bits of value in the way we move bits of information: using an open standard, in very granular transmissions, instantly, to anyone, anywhere in the world.” That ability will change everything. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e0065b2b-dd1e-411b-bd11-87a515588576.jpg?height=311&width=577)\n\n### Describing the Present \nEveryone’s journey down the crypto rabbit-hole is deeply personal to them. Mine is an amalgamation of my work in finance and investing, my private anxieties around whether I gave film enough of a shot (and underpinning that, a desire to make the act of creating art easier and more financially viable for my friends who were brave enough to go all-in), my personal tendencies toward light iconoclasm, my delight in uncertainty, and my desire to make the world a fairer, more economically just place. I think most people in crypto share some array of these traits, and have their own motivations as well. I think the key is finding the unlock for each person, and introducing them to crypto that way.\n\nMy dad began to grasp Ethereum after I suggested he read the white paper; as a lawyer, he immediately grokked the idea of immutable smart contracts. I’ve started a consulting gig with a resale and limited-run goods startup on a social token rewards system, and our conversations have centered around unifying the values of buyers, sellers, and creating relationships that endure beyond a transaction. Given the pace of sell-side notes, investment bank-hosted webinars, and recent high-profile announcements of potential TradFi-DeFi alliances ([Compound Treasury, for example](https://medium.com/compound-finance/announcing-compound-treasury-for-businesses-institutions-83d4484fb82e)) I think Wall Street is beginning to wake up to the indelible momentum of crypto as well.\n \nIn my final weeks as a stock analyst, I pitched Ethereum, Uniswap, and MakerDAO as long positions to my colleagues (though no one bought...yet). We had numerous discussions around the promises of crypto, and what various crypto-native business models might look like. [Marc Rubenstein’s](https://twitter.com/MarcRuby) excellent [Reinventing The Financial System post](https://www.netinterest.co/p/reinventing-the-financial-system) about MakerDAO was the catalyst for a thorough, long-winding conversation about the fractional reserve banking system, and the way loans underpin the financial industry. I think my former teammates were surprised to hear that crypto could be used as a means to issue a dollar-backed stablecoin, and that a blockchain-based issuer could also begin to do work in new segments like [real-world-asset-backed loans](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/real-world-finance). While MakerDAO’s initial pool of RWA loans is quite small (just under [~4m in total loans outstanding today](https://duneanalytics.com/queries/38282/75752)), it’s easy to see this scaling into a much larger operation (which [could help diversify their collateral base away from USDC](https://daistats.com/)). These are early signs that crypto has the potential to grow to touch more than just value-exchange online. \n\nIt’s still so early for everything. A few nights ago, I went back and re-read some of the first messages I sent with the Turkish grad student from 2017. I wanted to revisit what I was really thinking about cryptocurrencies at the time. Our messages began in September, just a few weeks after my post-internship job offer. This part in particular stuck out to me:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d87d30d1-c279-453e-8e65-d716bd26d23b.jpeg?height=523&width=665)\n\nEssentially, I was asking -- how can Bitcoin (or Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency) scale without the kind of leverage and rehypothecation that we see in traditional financial markets? In my own words “*Bitcoin (or the blockchain) can’t replicate the international banking system we have where money and ‘value’ is basically manufactured through securitization and other fancy financial instruments.*” Obviously, I was not anticipating DeFi. As I said in the second message “*I’ve noticed that tech people are usually way more imaginative.*” I was right about that. DeFi had a little under $2bn in TVL a year ago and now sits [just above $50bn in TVL today](https://defipulse.com/) (and much more if you include blockchains like Solana and Binance)  -- a staggering amount of growth. \n\nWhile you might argue that DeFi encourages some degree of reckless over-speculation, overleveraged trading, and is artificially inflating the value of certain crypto-assets today, I actually don’t think that matters longer-term. For one, price action in the industry serves as a form of advertising, and an early engine of innovation (Chris Dixon and Eddy Lazzarin [had a good post that examined this phenomenon](https://a16z.com/2020/05/15/the-crypto-price-innovation-cycle/) with respect to the price of Bitcoin, but the same is likely true if you map in assets like Ethereum or Solana). Even if certain assets fluctuate today (and those fluctuations are intensified by leverage), the overall impact of getting more people interested in crypto is a positive counterweight to any near-term mania (though yes, it does suck for the people who lose a lot of money). \n\nAnd even if DeFi and yield farming is creating nearer-term hype, it’s also illuminating the greater promise of crypto in general: the idea that if you eliminate middlemen and share value with users of a protocol instead, the positive externalities are so great that crypto can start behaving like a public good. Grants issued by groups like Uniswap and the Ethereum Foundation are an early indication of this. And this isn’t confined to just DeFi; NFT projects allow creators and collectors to share in the value of art created by eliminating (or at the very least, reducing the take rate) of middlemen, while encoding an enduring revenue stream for the originator of a specific work. Hopefully we’ll soon see ways to map this model onto other scalable operations, like music and other forms of entertainment, DAOs that own real estate, and maybe a blockchain-based Uber. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b229174b-6b68-48b8-8a23-7567eb750663.jpeg?height=259&width=460)\n\nThe “seeing things as stocks” mindset that was first inculcated in me four years ago will likely need to be reframed. In the future, public companies may see no separation between users, employees, and shareholders. In fact, “public companies” as we understand them today may not even exist, as they will have issued tokens at an earlier stage, and might not even IPO. While I realize I’m now violating my favorite neologism (“Don’t try to predict the future. Try to describe the present.”), I think we have early signals that this could come to pass. Everything from the increased focus [on DAO treasury management](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-daos-should-approach-treasury) to aforementioned efforts to collateralize real-world-assets with DeFi indicate that the need to tap public markets for capital may recede (it’s also quite possible that public markets and TradFi in general are reshaped from within by crypto, in ways that I’m not yet imagining, and they continue to endure in a revitalized form). Of course, there are tons of uncertainties here: the continued pace of user adoption, and regulatory overhangs are two big ones. \n\nMostly, I’m just unabashedly optimistic, for all the reasons I outlined above. In the four years since I first started paying attention to crypto, the industry has transitioned into an instrument of genuine value creation. I’ve met so many people in the past year who have inspired and galvanized me -- and my only hope is that I can contribute to an industry that I believe will revolutionize the way we live, both online and in the physical world. \n\nUsually when I write an essay, I start with the concluding paragraph already written, at least in my head. I tend to begin already knowing what I want the lesson to be. This is one of the few exceptions -- an hour before publishing this, I’m sitting on the couch in my living room, trying to figure out the best way to bring both the past four years of my professional life, and the promise of crypto to some kind of satisfying finale. And I’m realizing that it’s probably an impossible task to achieve in writing. Because with crypto, you just have to live it. So now I’m off to go do that. \n\n*Thanks to early readers of this essay: Andrew, Jeremy, Keeks, Reggie, Tarun, and Toby.* \n\n*Also boundless thanks to the builders, writers, thinkers, tinkerers, and visionaries who have made their work available on everything from Github to blogs to forums to Discord messages.

This crowdfund intends to raise the funds that will enable us to do just that. \n\n## Crowdfund Details\n\n* **90% to the *Elektra* project**\n* **10% to *Portal Tickets* visual team**\n\nWe will use 90% of the amount raised to put towards the *Elektra* project. \n\nThese funds will go toward the core team of project managers, web developers, artists and strategists working directly on the project. Other costs include transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, web hosting and file storage. We intend to save a portion of these funds to act as the *seed money* in standing up the *ElektraDAO* once this initial phase of the project is complete (more on that below).\n\nThe remaining 10% will go directly to the artists who created the *Portal Ticket* visuals.\n\n## Phase 1: Songcamp Elektra + The Elektra NFT Vault\n\n*Songcamp Elektra* will run for 4 weeks, until the first week of August. \n\nOnce through the portal, you will begin your journey. You will work with other players to move through this foreign land, discover more about the history of *Elektra*, and find your way to victory. \n\nIf successful, you will unlock the help you need — the people and items along the way that will help you accomplish your mission. Remember, **it is music that powers the world of *Elektra***. Luckily, you’ll have a lot of talented musicians to help along the way. You too may be summoned to assist in the music creation (should you wish to of course). :)\n\nAt times during the camp, 1-of-1 NFTs will be released. A 20% share of the proceeds from collected NFTs will go towards the ElektraDAO, while a select few of the NFTs will be placed in the Elektra Vault.\n\n## Phase 2: ElektraDAO and The $ELEKTRA Token\n\n> We will build a world, and own that world together. \n\nUpon purchasing your *Portal Ticket* NFT, you will also receive a portion of $ELEKTRA tokens based on the amount contributed. You will receive 100 $ELEKTRA for every 0.1 ETH you contribute to the crowdfund. \n\nThe project will retain 75% of $ELEKTRA’s supply, and distribute the majority to artists, devs, project ops and strategists working directly on the project. The remaining amount will be used to create bounty rewards for the wider network, as well as vest a portion in the treasury. \n\n**As this project evolves, the lines between creator and audience will blur.** Game builders will also play the game they are building; and game players will also help build the game they are playing. \n\nBy the end, we will have a community of contributors to the Elektra project that all hold $ELEKTRA tokens based on their contribution levels. At this point, **we will have *exited to community* — and the project will be owned and governed by $ELEKTRA token holders.** \n\n## Then What?\n\nWell, then it’s up to the network. \n\nThe *ElektraDAO* will have created an incredibly strong backbone:\n\n1. A core group of musicians, visual artists, devs, project ops, strategists and backers with sharp coordination and collaboration skills — plus an overflowing level of squad energy.\n2. 1-of-1 NFTs from the Elektra story secured in the DAO’s vault.\n3. A flow of royalties from the artwork created in-camp.\n\nWe then have the exciting opportunity to collectively decide what to do with all this. \n\nSome early ideas: make more art together, continue evolving the world and story of *Elektra*, experiment with and carve out new paths to monetization and value realization for the art we’ve created, or our personal favourite…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/troels_a/status/1413234727822180354\n\nBroadway, here we come.\n\n### Once you've secured your *Portal Ticket*, enter the Portal to Elektra:\n\nhttps://elektra.camp/\n\n", "timestamp": 1626103487, "digest": "A_DtOIiE03-b_lHcyh5t7_AfKGy4eQF4lOUhd6mI2Rc", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

We intend to save a portion of these funds to act as the *seed money* in standing up the *ElektraDAO* once this initial phase of the project is complete (more on that below).\n\nThe remaining 10% will go directly to the artists who created the *Portal Ticket* visuals.\n\n## Phase 1: Songcamp Elektra + The Elektra NFT Vault\n\n*Songcamp Elektra* will run for 4 weeks, until the first week of August. \n\nOnce through the portal, you will begin your journey. You will work with other players to move through this foreign land, discover more about the history of *Elektra*, and find your way to victory. \n\nIf successful, you will unlock the help you need — the people and items along the way that will help you accomplish your mission. Remember, **it is music that powers the world of *Elektra***. Luckily, you’ll have a lot of talented musicians to help along the way. You too may be summoned to assist in the music creation (should you wish to of course). :)\n\nAt times during the camp, 1-of-1 NFTs will be released. A 20% share of the proceeds from collected NFTs will go towards the ElektraDAO, while a select few of the NFTs will be placed in the Elektra Vault.\n\n## Phase 2: ElektraDAO and The $ELEKTRA Token\n\n> We will build a world, and own that world together. \n\nUpon purchasing your *Portal Ticket* NFT, you will also receive a portion of $ELEKTRA tokens based on the amount contributed. You will receive 100 $ELEKTRA for every 0.1 ETH you contribute to the crowdfund. \n\nThe project will retain 75% of $ELEKTRA’s supply, and distribute the majority to artists, devs, project ops and strategists working directly on the project. The remaining amount will be used to create bounty rewards for the wider network, as well as vest a portion in the treasury. \n\n**As this project evolves, the lines between creator and audience will blur.** Game builders will also play the game they are building; and game players will also help build the game they are playing. \n\nBy the end, we will have a community of contributors to the Elektra project that all hold $ELEKTRA tokens based on their contribution levels. At this point, **we will have *exited to community* — and the project will be owned and governed by $ELEKTRA token holders.** \n\n## Then What?\n\nWell, then it’s up to the network. \n\nThe *ElektraDAO* will have created an incredibly strong backbone:\n\n1. A core group of musicians, visual artists, devs, project ops, strategists and backers with sharp coordination and collaboration skills — plus an overflowing level of squad energy.\n2. 1-of-1 NFTs from the Elektra story secured in the DAO’s vault.\n3. A flow of royalties from the artwork created in-camp.\n\nWe then have the exciting opportunity to collectively decide what to do with all this. \n\nSome early ideas: make more art together, continue evolving the world and story of *Elektra*, experiment with and carve out new paths to monetization and value realization for the art we’ve created, or our personal favourite…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/troels_a/status/1413234727822180354\n\nBroadway, here we come.\n\n### Once you've secured your *Portal Ticket*, enter the Portal to Elektra:\n\nhttps://elektra.camp/\n\n", "timestamp": 1626103445, "digest": "okw6GtuBbrkXtyBBsE2wDTX22O8pcFbjl3RTpLus4XA", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

Web 3.0 (commonly called Web3) is a paradigm shift towards a more democratized Internet.\n\n*This article appeared first in [[Messari]((https://messari.io/article/web3-eli5-what-is-web3))] as part of our series of [explainer](https://messari.io/article/explain-it-like-i-am-5-defi?referrer=grid-view) [content](https://messari.io/article/explain-it-like-i-am-5-nfts?utm_source=messaricrypto&utm_medium=tweet1&utm_campaign=nftELI5).*\n\nWeb3 manifests through new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, virtual and augmented reality, AI, and more. Empowered by new technologies, the Web3 movement is spearheaded by a shift in how we, the collective, view and value the Internet.

This is not a controversial statement. Although it’s worth emphasizing because it is shockingly understated – the Internet changed everything.\n\nFind an issue or topic that you care about today and – whether it’s economic, political, or social, – a quick Google search will show that the Internet has fundamentally reshaped or transformed that issue.\n\nEconomical – the Internet is directly responsible for the rise of globalization and eCommerce, two trends that have deeply impacted the world. More specifically, over the past three years (2017, 2018, and 2019), the S&P 500 Tech sector doubled in value, and today technology sector stocks account for around 25% of the entire S&P 500 Index.\n\nSocial – this one is quite obvious, hell, even the word “social” has a new meaning compared to two decades ago. Once young startups, Facebook, Google, Instagram, and Twitter, now receive upwards of 40% of venture capital dollars in the form of ad spend from new startups. The potential future impact of new platforms like TikTok is still undecided, yet promising for social media influencers.\n\nPolitical – Algorithms that offer cherry-picked news and are designed to incite than coalesce have become the norm. The Internet has affected political elections around the world and given rise to a new generation of bureaucrats who are Internet natives.\n\nThe Internet changed everything – financial markets, culture, elections, everything. There are so few exceptions to this rule that it might as well be a law of nature. A decade or two from now, events stemming from or directly caused by the Internet will have shaped the world multiple times over. This is why the fate of the Internet has become more important than ever.\n\n### Why We Need Web3\nThe early years of the Internet were exploratory in nature. Similar to the ideology of Manifest Destiny – the belief that the expansion of the US throughout the American continents was both justified and inevitable – early tech pioneers explored, sequestered, walled, and commoditized the Internet. Over time, the Internet has remained “free” yet corrupted.\n\nYou probably see this in your life when you try to purchase a bus, train, or airline ticket. All of your searches are logged, sold, and manipulated against you. The Internet is yours to use, but you are not its master. Individuals around the world face even greater challenges, specifically in countries where the Internet is partially walled, restricted, or blocked entirely.\n\nThe hallmark trait of the Internet was the democratization of information, yet today, information is increasingly unreliable, siloed, and in some instances downright harmful. Fake accounts controlled by bots are manipulating children. Realistic human faces created by AI will create even larger problems for society through deep fakes and identity theft. Fake news accounted for economic losses over $70 billion in 2019 and will only increase over time. The human condition for virality has given rise to digital viruses – false news stories – that travel six times faster than true news stories. This trend has extreme implications.\n\n### A World of Open Protocols\nWeb3 is about rearchitecting the existing services and products of the Internet so that they benefit people rather than entities. While it’s impossible to predict the future, one vision of a Web3 world is one that has open-source protocols at the foundation while businesses act as interfaces that provide convenient access and additional features. Web3 is an internet that is open for all users, built on open protocols and transparent blockchain networks. The way consumers interface with these protocols might be through blended applications that offer convenient ways to interact with the underlying technologies.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6fc93765-d9cd-4ef0-a0dd-14f6a159f38e.jpeg?height=446&width=795)\n\nData will still be used to drive decision making but will not be used against the consumer. Data rights will be protected rather than stomped over in search of profits. Incentive and market mechanisms will help ensure that information is trustworthy and verifiable.\n\nA Web3 world will prioritize the sovereign individual rather than the wealthy elite and rent-seekers of the world. The rearchitecting of systems and protocols will focus on democratization and decentralization.\n\n### What Are Examples of Web3?\nWeb3 is more nascent than DeFi and so, naturally less concrete examples exist. However, just as finance has various applications like lending and borrowing, the internet consists of various services and components.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bb1022da-7ec8-4026-af32-3d63be961a4a.jpeg?height=446&width=795)\n\n**Internet Architecture and Services**\nThe architecture of the internet isn’t something most individuals think about. Your internet either works, lags, or is offline. But you probably understand that Comcast and AT&T or your ISP (internet service provider) is ripping you off, promising fast connection, and then either charging you an arm and a leg or rugging services from you that used to be free. New services like Andrena and Althea circumvent these existing internet providers by creating community networks where individuals can operate and get paid to provide internet to members within their community.\n\nFor example, a landlord or tenant owner could invest in an Andrena hotspot to enable all of their tenants to join the Andrena wireless network and pay the landlord for individual data consumption. Alternatively, an apartment renter could purchase a smaller hotspot and provide enough internet access to their neighbors in order to offset their personal internet consumption.\n\nOther blockchain networks like Handshake as well as companies like Unstoppable Domains aim to democratize the existing Domain Name System (DNS) which maps an IP address to a human-readable address like Messari.io. The DNS registry is controlled by organizations like Verisign and ICANN and have unilateral control to enforce IP rights, censor free speech sites like WikiLeaks, and seize domain names (IP addresses) without due process. While not all of these instances of censorship are negative, the subjective nature of it all is concerning. Oftentimes, the DNS decision-makers are those at the highest levels of government and lobbyists of the largest multinational organizations, who may intend well but do not always act in the best interest of the public.\n\n**Data Storage, Distribution, and Monetization**\nTwitter allows you to download all of your data. This is wonderful until you actually download the data and realize that you have absolutely no idea what to do with it. I mean, it’s your data. You should be able to draw insights from it, right? The problem is, data is hard to monetize at the individual level, but easy in aggregate. Robinhood generated nearly $300 million in revenue from selling customer order flow data in the first half of 2020. Dozens of companies understand this concept, which is why Snapchat loses money year over year, but investors understand the company has millions of Gen Z users who generate (potentially valuable) data.\n\nOrganizations like Ocean Protocol, Streamr, and Numerai are building protocols that enable open data markets where anyone can share or monetize their data. Data is a fundamental component of how value is stored and transferred across the internet. The commoditization of data has yet to be achieved because data is siloed, sensitive, or proprietary. New Web3 protocols provide a means for markets where sensitive data can be shared and proprietary data can be accurately priced and sold. Turning data into tangible data assets (tokens) will unlock value, developing a more robust data ecosystem.\n\nAnother key component of data is storing it across servers, which is predominantly controlled by a few large companies. Decentralized data storage and web hosting services like Sia, Arweave, and Filecoin are supporting the creation of new decentralized applications.\n\n**Applications and Other Internet Infrastructure Services**\nYou use so many services that you probably don’t even realize it. WIFI, location services (GPS), Bluetooth connectivity, messaging services (iOS, Android), video and audio streaming (Youtube, Twitch, Spotify), etc.\n\nA few stakeholders control all these applications. More importantly, these apps utilize services and infrastructure that are centralized or controlled by a few large companies (e.g. Google, AWS, Microsoft). New protocols and companies like Helium (open wireless network), Foam (open location services), Livepeer (video transcoding and streaming), Orchid (distributed and private VPNs), and more are all building distributed and community-operated services.\n\nThese community-owned and operated services are cheaper because they’re able to avoid middlemen. For example, Youtube and Twitch aren’t just content distribution engines. The streaming giants provide \"free\" data storage for all videos from content creators. Youtube and Twitch also assist with video transcoding to ensure viewers can consume a particular video in the required format. The ability to provide all of these services seamlessly helps ingrain content producers into each platform.\n\nWeb3 protocols can distribute the power of a single firm by unbundling the services that firms provide to users. Audius (music streaming), OurZora (open media market), Mirror (decentralized publishing platform) are all creating platforms where users own the content they produce and have a say in the governance of these platforms.\n\nIn the future, content creators will be able to publicly store their data separately from where it is consumed. While these services are less convenient today, in the future they will be built into the underlying platforms you use on a daily basis.\n\n### Final Thoughts on Web2 And the Transition to Web3\nIt’s easy to be dissatisfied and angry at the corporate elites, governments, or anyone who manipulates the Internet in order to benefit themselves. While understandable, I don’t think that’s the right sentiment.\n\nOriginally, the Internet needed pioneers and businesses to develop tools to make the Internet accessible, and they were rightly rewarded. As long as the existing design of the Internet proliferates, we will continue to give up our data, time, and money to the major tech corporations in exchange for convenient products that promise free access. And to be honest, there isn’t one solution that will act as a panacea for all these issues. It will take a myriad of attempts, shifts in consumer behavior, and technological innovations.", "timestamp": 1626106006, "digest": "ROcdh7PRWxVwET_CWaSDR3V79Cj45OnkwCeSFkO8M_k", "contributor": "0x621b35b50c508f3497437Ae777dEe70D052D6AD9"}

This crowdfund intends to raise the funds that will enable us to do just that. \n\n## Crowdfund Details\n\n* **90% to the *Elektra* project**\n* **10% to *Portal Tickets* visual team**\n\nWe will use 90% of the amount raised to put towards the *Elektra* project. \n\nThese funds will go toward the core team of project managers, web developers, artists and strategists working directly on the project. Other costs include transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, web hosting and file storage. We intend to save a portion of these funds to act as the *seed money* in standing up the *ElektraDAO* once this initial phase of the project is complete (more on that below).\n\nThe remaining 10% will go directly to the artists who created the *Portal Ticket* visuals.\n\n## Phase 1: Songcamp Elektra + The Elektra NFT Vault\n\n*Songcamp Elektra* will run for 4 weeks, until the first week of August. \n\nOnce through the portal, you will begin your journey. You will work with other players to move through this foreign land, discover more about the history of *Elektra*, and find your way to victory. \n\nIf successful, you will unlock the help you need — the people and items along the way that will help you accomplish your mission. Remember, **it is music that powers the world of *Elektra***. Luckily, you’ll have a lot of talented musicians to help along the way. You too may be summoned to assist in the music creation (should you wish to of course). :)\n\nAt times during the camp, 1-of-1 NFTs will be released. A 20% share of the proceeds from collected NFTs will go towards the ElektraDAO, while a select few of the NFTs will be placed in the Elektra Vault.\n\n## Phase 2: ElektraDAO and The $ELEKTRA Token\n\n> We will build a world, and own that world together. \n\nUpon purchasing your *Portal Ticket* NFT, you will also receive a portion of $ELEKTRA tokens based on the amount contributed. You will receive 100 $ELEKTRA for every 0.1 ETH you contribute to the crowdfund. \n\nThe project will retain 75% of $ELEKTRA’s supply, and distribute the majority to artists, devs, project ops and strategists working directly on the project. The remaining amount will be used to create bounty rewards for the wider network, as well as vest a portion in the treasury. \n\n**As this project evolves, the lines between creator and audience will blur.** Game builders will also play the game they are building; and game players will also help build the game they are playing. \n\nBy the end, we will have a community of contributors to the Elektra project that all hold $ELEKTRA tokens based on their contribution levels. At this point, **we will have *exited to community* — and the project will be owned and governed by $ELEKTRA token holders.** \n\n## Then What?\n\nWell, then it’s up to the network. \n\nThe *ElektraDAO* will have created an incredibly strong backbone:\n\n1. A core group of musicians, visual artists, devs, project ops, strategists and backers with sharp coordination and collaboration skills — plus an overflowing level of squad energy.\n2. 1-of-1 NFTs from the Elektra story secured in the DAO’s vault.\n3. A flow of royalties from the artwork created in-camp.\n\nWe then have the exciting opportunity to collectively decide what to do with all this. \n\nSome early ideas: make more art together, continue evolving the world and story of *Elektra*, experiment with and carve out new paths to monetization and value realization for the art we’ve created, or our personal favourite…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/troels_a/status/1413234727822180354\n\nBroadway, here we come.\n\n### Once you've secured your *Portal Ticket*, enter the Portal to Elektra:\n\nhttps://elektra.camp/\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1626107420, "digest": "A_DtOIiE03-b_lHcyh5t7_AfKGy4eQF4lOUhd6mI2Rc", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

Now, the school already had a few computers at the time, but those were green-and-grey text machines, rudimentary and clunky, unfriendly to children and teachers alike. These new computers were of an entirely different class, featuring user-interfaces (ooh!), software applications (ahh!), and most importantly, graphics (wow!!). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/77447795-4ed5-4be8-b787-bf224015462d.jpeg?height=2250&width=4000)\n\nMy teacher instantly recognized the learning potential stored within this humming totem as she proudly positioned it at the front of the class. Because our school only had one computer we all took turns using it, and over the years my teachers would plunk me down in front of the machine with different applications opened each time. One day I played Math Blaster to test my addition and subtraction knowledge. Another day I set off on the Oregon Trail, caught dysentery, and died. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f32dd738-7531-4f6c-bbd3-a16067bfe356.jpeg?height=2250&width=4000)\n\nAnd another day — a truly special day — my teacher put me in front of an open browser window and gave me one simple command: ‘Make a website’. \n\nThere were no further instructions that I can recall and I’ve desperately tried to remember exactly how I made a website at such a young age. GeoCities? Something else? I can’t remember, but by the end of the period I somehow managed to create my own homepage about black holes. \n\nThe site featured a pitch black background and a spiral gif spinning ominously in the center. I walked over to the school’s library and checked out a book on outer space, returning to copy the most interesting facts and add them to the page. In these early, heady days, citations weren't required and information felt free to give and get. After I finished I asked my friend about the website she made during her turn on the computer. She created a site dedicated to her favorite animal, the cheetah, which she loved because of how fast they could run. I told her I would look it up next time I got a chance to use the internet. \n\nLooking back, both of our websites were pure in intent. I thought black holes were cool, and she thought cheetahs were cool. That was it! We recognized the web as a place to host our interests and potentially find others who felt the same way about them, and it excited me to have published something. Would someone else see it? Would someone desperately in need of information about outer space come across the facts I left behind? And what else would be possible as computers evolved?\n\nUnfortunately, the answer wasn't entirely rewarding. \n\nAs I progressed from elementary school to middle school to high school, the computers did indeed develop alongside me — now there were whole computer labs filled with rows of colorful iMac G3s and beige Windows PCs and entire classes dedicated to using them — but as the hardware became abundant, the field of learning seemed to somehow narrow. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/523cd463-6752-4a66-8084-bf277f30a73e.jpeg?height=2250&width=4000)\n\nI took a computer class with the hopes that it would teach me the things that I needed to build more websites like the one from elementary school, but instead I found myself in front of a preloaded copy of Microsoft Frontpage and given very specific instructions on how to compose a website about golf balls. \n\nI asked the teacher if I could deviate from the rather boring lesson plan. He told me that I could not. I finished the exercise in thirty minutes and have no other memories from the class at all.\n\nWhile the internet of my elementary school days seemed full of creativity, over the years the space began to feel stymied; eventually culminating in the WYSIWYG and social network dominated world that we now live in. That freedom that I initially felt now seems a little foreign. Today there are plenty of safe and convenient ways to make websites about golf balls in 30 minutes, but fewer and fewer options to explore something completely new. \n\nThe web has become watered down and impersonal, run by a handful of gigantic organizations that hold all the power and give just enough of it back to their users to satiate them. The internet of my childhood was the internet of blank pages — tabula rasa! — but the whole business model of today’s internet revolves around never showing the user a blank page at all, providing them with an endless stream of new information to fill every waking moment.\n\nI've missed that foundational version of the internet and felt dissatisfied with what we have — until recently. \n\nweb3 represents the blank slate I’ve been looking for; a space where people create purely to create and participate not to disassociate from their lives but to create deep and meaningful connections, build with others, and stake a claim on the future.\n\nI felt extremely open-handed while making my website about black holes. I wasn't trying to monetize the words I added or recoup my hosting fees. I wasn't thinking about running ads or getting likes or gaining followers, concepts that wouldn't take root for years. Instead, I was thinking about black holes — and thinking about how other people might also be thinking about black holes. The early internet felt collaborative and selfless in a way that's been completely lost in a rigid web obsessed with building (and trapping) influencers, their attention, and their audiences.\n\nweb3 shifts the internet back towards open-handedness. Musicians create music for audiences moving from the role of spectators to partners, online communities treat members as stakeholders who receive tokens in return for their participation, platforms give their keys over to their users, and on and on and on. It's a fantastic time to be a creator because anything is possible and new projects of interest pop up each day. FOMO feels like less and less of a thing because it's inevitable that yet another crazy and life-altering event will happen tomorrow, and you're capable of being a part of each one. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b84829c2-a73b-45c4-a344-6ebce84df675.jpeg?height=2250&width=4000)\n\nweb3 presents a new frontier of infinite possibility and optimism that supersedes even the most pessimistic of viewpoints, and we're just getting started.\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1626111499, "digest": "U7mSbRetkJ77FvwD0n61P-Y6YUC6Xj5N1MUI8JRwQDc", "contributor": "0xc7A0D765C3aF6E2710bA05A56c5E2cA190C2E11e"}

This crowdfund intends to raise the funds that will enable us to do just that. \n\n## Crowdfund Details\n\n* **90% to the *Elektra* project**\n* **10% to *Portal Tickets* visual team**\n\nWe will use 90% of the amount raised to put towards the *Elektra* project. \n\nThese funds will go toward the core team of project managers, web developers, artists and strategists working directly on the project. Other costs include transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, web hosting and file storage. We intend to save a portion of these funds to act as the *seed money* in standing up the *ElektraDAO* once this initial phase of the project is complete (more on that below).\n\nThe remaining 10% will go directly to the artists who created the *Portal Ticket* visuals.\n\n## Phase 1: Songcamp Elektra + The Elektra NFT Vault\n\n*Songcamp Elektra* will run for 4 weeks, until the first week of August. \n\nOnce through the portal, you will begin your journey. You will work with other players to move through this foreign land, discover more about the history of *Elektra*, and find your way to victory. \n\nIf successful, you will unlock the help you need — the people and items along the way that will help you accomplish your mission. Remember, **it is music that powers the world of *Elektra***. Luckily, you’ll have a lot of talented musicians to help along the way. You too may be summoned to assist in the music creation (should you wish to of course). :)\n\nAt times during the camp, 1-of-1 NFTs will be released. A 20% share of the proceeds from collected NFTs will go towards the ElektraDAO, while a select few of the NFTs will be placed in the Elektra Vault.\n\n## Phase 2: ElektraDAO + The $ELEKTRA Token\n\n> We will build a world, and own that world together. \n\nUpon purchasing your *Portal Ticket* NFT, you will also receive a portion of $ELEKTRA tokens based on the amount contributed. You will receive 100 $ELEKTRA for every 0.1 ETH you contribute to the crowdfund. \n\nThe project will retain 75% of $ELEKTRA’s supply, and distribute the majority to artists, devs, project ops and strategists working directly on the project. The remaining amount will be used to create bounty rewards for the wider network, as well as vest a portion in the treasury. \n\n**As this project evolves, the lines between creator and audience will blur.** Game builders will also play the game they are building; and game players will also help build the game they are playing. \n\nBy the end, we will have a community of contributors to the Elektra project that all hold $ELEKTRA tokens based on their contribution levels. At this point, **we will have *exited to community* — and the project will be owned and governed by $ELEKTRA token holders.** \n\n## Then What?\n\nWell, then it’s up to the network. \n\nThe *ElektraDAO* will have created an incredibly strong backbone:\n\n1. A core group of musicians, visual artists, devs, project ops, strategists and backers with sharp coordination and collaboration skills — plus an overflowing level of squad energy.\n2. 1-of-1 NFTs from the Elektra story secured in the DAO’s vault.\n3. A flow of royalties from the artwork created in-camp.\n\nWe then have the exciting opportunity to collectively decide what to do with all this. \n\nSome early ideas: make more art together, continue evolving the world and story of *Elektra*, experiment with and carve out new paths to monetization and value realization for the art we’ve created, or our personal favourite…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/troels_a/status/1413234727822180354\n\nBroadway, here we come.\n\n### Once you've secured your *Portal Ticket*, enter the Portal to Elektra:\n\nhttps://elektra.camp/", "timestamp": 1626111995, "digest": "GS-1XUYL8o3J3YxC1ck0AUpwigLVgQSobOe462ASKBU", "contributor": "0x658D62A7DC4d475a9cc4AF124A60868c594EEEc6"}

GeoCities? Something else? I can’t remember, but by the end of the period I somehow managed to create my own homepage about black holes. \n\nThe site featured a pitch black background and a spiral gif spinning ominously in the center.

She created a site dedicated to her favorite animal, the cheetah, which she loved because of how fast they could run. I told her I would look it up next time I got a chance to use the internet. \n\nLooking back, both of our websites were pure in intent. I thought black holes were cool, and she thought cheetahs were cool. That was it!

But soon, motives around greed and self-interest took over, and the music that powered this world was lost.\n\nYour mission is to travel to *Elektra*, and help us collectively revive, restore and reignite this once beautiful world back to health.\n\n***Will you accept your mission?***\n\n[The Phi Ticket](edition://0xaC0bDf2F88c06Da0c15Fb5670485b96d701035b0?editionId=18&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n[The Psi Ticket](edition://0xaC0bDf2F88c06Da0c15Fb5670485b96d701035b0?editionId=19&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n[The Chi Ticket](edition://0xaC0bDf2F88c06Da0c15Fb5670485b96d701035b0?editionId=20&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n## What is Songcamp Elektra?\n\n**Songcamp Elektra** is the second experiment created by *Songcamp* — a community of musicians, artists and strategists with a deep interest in learning what happens when **music** and **the new internet** crash into each other.\n\n*Songcamp* acts a lot like a **web3 laboratory** — experimenting at the far out edges of how web3 tools and tech can affect positive change in the lives and work of artists.\n\nThe *Songcamp Elektra* project is made up of ~42 artists, devs, project ops and strategists working together to bring this world to life. This crowdfund intends to raise the funds that will enable us to do just that. \n\n## Crowdfund Details\n\n* **90% to the *Elektra* project**\n* **10% to *Portal Tickets* visual team**\n\nWe will use 90% of the amount raised to put towards the *Elektra* project. \n\nThese funds will go toward the core team of project managers, web developers, artists and strategists working directly on the project. Other costs include transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, web hosting and file storage. We intend to save a portion of these funds to act as the *seed money* in standing up the *ElektraDAO* once this initial phase of the project is complete (more on that below).\n\nThe remaining 10% will go directly to the artists who created the *Portal Ticket* visuals.\n\n## Phase 1: Songcamp Elektra + The Elektra NFT Vault\n\n*Songcamp Elektra* will run for 4 weeks, until the first week of August. \n\nOnce through the portal, you will begin your journey. You will work with other players to move through this foreign land, discover more about the history of *Elektra*, and find your way to victory. \n\nIf successful, you will unlock the help you need — the people and items along the way that will help you accomplish your mission. Remember, **it is music that powers the world of *Elektra***. Luckily, you’ll have a lot of talented musicians to help along the way. You too may be summoned to assist in the music creation (should you wish to of course). :)\n\nAt times during the camp, 1-of-1 NFTs will be released. A 20% share of the proceeds from collected NFTs will go towards the ElektraDAO, while a select few of the NFTs will be placed in the Elektra Vault.\n\n## Phase 2: ElektraDAO + The $ELEKTRA Token\n\n> We will build a world, and own that world together. \n\nUpon purchasing your *Portal Ticket* NFT, you will also receive a portion of $ELEKTRA tokens based on the amount contributed. You will receive 100 $ELEKTRA for every 0.1 ETH you contribute to the crowdfund. \n\nThe project will retain 75% of $ELEKTRA’s supply, and distribute the majority to artists, devs, project ops and strategists working directly on the project. The remaining amount will be used to create bounty rewards for the wider network, as well as vest a portion in the treasury. \n\n**As this project evolves, the lines between creator and audience will blur.** Game builders will also play the game they are building; and game players will also help build the game they are playing. \n\nBy the end, we will have a community of contributors to the Elektra project that all hold $ELEKTRA tokens based on their contribution levels. At this point, **we will have *exited to community* — and the project will be owned and governed by $ELEKTRA token holders.** \n\n## Then What?\n\nWell, then it’s up to the network. \n\nThe *ElektraDAO* will have created an incredibly strong backbone:\n\n1. A core group of musicians, visual artists, devs, project ops, strategists and backers with sharp coordination and collaboration skills — plus an overflowing level of squad energy.\n2. 1-of-1 NFTs from the Elektra story secured in the DAO’s vault.\n3. A flow of royalties from the artwork created in-camp.\n\nWe then have the exciting opportunity to collectively decide what to do with all this. \n\nSome early ideas: make more art together, continue evolving the world and story of *Elektra*, experiment with and carve out new paths to monetization and value realization for the art we’ve created, or our personal favourite…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/troels_a/status/1413234727822180354\n\nBroadway, here we come.\n\n### Once you've secured your *Portal Ticket*, enter the Portal to Elektra:\n\nhttps://elektra.camp/", "timestamp": 1626113656, "digest": "GS-1XUYL8o3J3YxC1ck0AUpwigLVgQSobOe462ASKBU", "contributor": "0x658D62A7DC4d475a9cc4AF124A60868c594EEEc6"}

Now, the school already had a few computers at the time, but those were green-and-grey text machines, rudimentary and clunky, unfriendly to children and teachers alike. These new computers were of an entirely different class, featuring user-interfaces (ooh!), software applications (ahh!), and most importantly, graphics (wow!!). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c7cfd833-58b5-4a72-af87-bb75db3dd14c.jpeg?height=844&width=1500)\n\nMy teacher instantly recognized the learning potential stored within this humming totem as she proudly positioned it at the front of the class. Because our school only had one computer we all took turns using it, and over the years my teachers would plunk me down in front of the machine with different applications opened each time. One day I played Math Blaster to test my addition and subtraction knowledge. Another day I set off on the Oregon Trail, caught dysentery, and died. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e25511e0-9107-4400-bfa1-29cdab4816b2.jpeg?height=844&width=1500)\n\nAnd another day — a truly special day — my teacher put me in front of an open browser window and gave me one simple command: ‘Make a website’. \n\nThere were no further instructions that I can recall and I’ve desperately tried to remember exactly how I made a website at such a young age. GeoCities? Something else? I can’t remember, but by the end of the period I somehow managed to create my own homepage about black holes. \n\nThe site featured a pitch black background and a spiral gif spinning ominously in the center. I walked over to the school’s library and checked out a book on outer space, returning to copy the most interesting facts and add them to the page. In these early, heady days, citations weren't required and information felt free to give and get. After I finished I asked my friend about the website she made during her turn on the computer. She created a site dedicated to her favorite animal, the cheetah, which she loved because of how fast they could run. I told her I would look it up next time I got a chance to use the internet. \n\nLooking back, both of our websites were pure in intent. I thought black holes were cool, and she thought cheetahs were cool. That was it! We recognized the web as a place to host our interests and potentially find others who felt the same way about them, and it excited me to have published something. Would someone else see it? Would someone desperately in need of information about outer space come across the facts I left behind? And what else would be possible as computers evolved?\n\nUnfortunately, the answer wasn't entirely rewarding. \n\nAs I progressed from elementary school to middle school to high school, the computers did indeed develop alongside me — now there were whole computer labs filled with rows of colorful iMac G3s and beige Windows PCs and entire classes dedicated to using them — but as the hardware became abundant, the field of learning seemed to somehow narrow. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1386558d-adef-4103-b77e-3463576076fa.jpeg?height=844&width=1500)\n\nI took a computer class with the hopes that it would teach me the things that I needed to build more websites like the one from elementary school, but instead I found myself in front of a preloaded copy of Microsoft Frontpage and given very specific instructions on how to compose a website about golf balls. \n\nI asked the teacher if I could deviate from the rather boring lesson plan. He told me that I could not. I finished the exercise in thirty minutes and have no other memories from the class at all.\n\nWhile the internet of my elementary school days seemed full of creativity, over the years the space began to feel stymied; eventually culminating in the WYSIWYG and social network dominated world that we now live in. That freedom that I initially felt now seems a little foreign. Today there are plenty of safe and convenient ways to make websites about golf balls in 30 minutes, but fewer and fewer options to explore something completely new. \n\nThe web has become watered down and impersonal, run by a handful of gigantic organizations that hold all the power and give just enough of it back to their users to satiate them. The internet of my childhood was the internet of blank pages — tabula rasa! — but the whole business model of today’s internet revolves around never showing the user a blank page at all, providing them with an endless stream of new information to fill every waking moment.\n\nI've missed that foundational version of the internet and felt dissatisfied with what we have — until recently. \n\nweb3 represents the blank slate I’ve been looking for; a space where people create purely to create and participate not to disassociate from their lives but to create deep and meaningful connections, build with others, and stake a claim on the future.\n\nI felt extremely open-handed while making my website about black holes. I wasn't trying to monetize the words I added or recoup my hosting fees. I wasn't thinking about running ads or getting likes or gaining followers, concepts that wouldn't take root for years. Instead, I was thinking about black holes — and thinking about how other people might also be thinking about black holes. The early internet felt collaborative and selfless in a way that's been completely lost in a rigid web obsessed with building (and trapping) influencers, their attention, and their audiences.\n\nweb3 shifts the internet back towards open-handedness.

You will work with other players to move through this foreign land, discover more about the history of *Elektra*, and find your way to victory. \n\nIf successful, you will unlock the help you need — the people and items along the way that will help you accomplish your mission. Remember, **it is music that powers the world of *Elektra***. Luckily, you’ll have a lot of talented musicians to help along the way. You too may be summoned to assist in the music creation (should you wish to of course). :)\n\nAt times during the camp, 1-of-1 NFTs will be released. A 20% share of the proceeds from collected NFTs will go towards the ElektraDAO, while a select few of the NFTs will be placed in the Elektra Vault.\n\n## Phase 2: ElektraDAO + The $ELEKTRA Token\n\n> We will build a world, and own that world together. \n\nUpon purchasing your *Portal Ticket* NFT, you will also receive a portion of $ELEKTRA tokens based on the amount contributed. You will receive 100 $ELEKTRA for every 0.1 ETH you contribute to the crowdfund. \n\nThe project will retain 75% of $ELEKTRA’s supply, and distribute the majority to artists, devs, project ops and strategists working directly on the project. The remaining amount will be used to create bounty rewards for the wider network, as well as vest a portion in the treasury. \n\n**As this project evolves, the lines between creator and audience will blur.** Game builders will also play the game they are building; and game players will also help build the game they are playing. \n\nBy the end, we will have a community of contributors to the Elektra project that all hold $ELEKTRA tokens based on their contribution levels. At this point, **we will have *exited to community* — and the project will be owned and governed by $ELEKTRA token holders.** \n\n## Then What?\n\nWell, then it’s up to the network. \n\nThe *ElektraDAO* will have created an incredibly strong backbone:\n\n1. A core group of musicians, visual artists, devs, project ops, strategists and backers with sharp coordination and collaboration skills — plus an overflowing level of squad energy.\n2. 1-of-1 NFTs from the Elektra story secured in the DAO’s vault.\n3. A flow of royalties from the artwork created in-camp.\n\nWe then have the exciting opportunity to collectively decide what to do with all this. \n\nSome early ideas: make more art together, continue evolving the world and story of *Elektra*, experiment with and carve out new paths to monetization and value realization for the art we’ve created, or our personal favourite…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/troels_a/status/1413234727822180354\n\nBroadway, here we come.\n\n### Once you've secured your *Portal Ticket*, enter the Portal to Elektra:\n\nhttps://elektra.camp/", "timestamp": 1626121207, "digest": "mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc", "contributor": "0xfC4852B5e3aF65058CdfE1D1dce26946c0C1975f"}

Since then, a lot has happened. COVID-19 forced hundreds of millions into Zoomschool and remote work. Roblox became one of the most popular entertainment experiences in history. Google Trends’ index on the phrase “The Metaverse” hit 100 in March 2021. From January 2005 to December 2020, it never exceeded seven. With that in mind, I thought it was time to do an update - one that reflects how my thinking has changed over the past 18 months and addresses the questions I’ve received during this time, such as “Is the Metaverse here?”, “When will it arrive?”, and “What does it need to grow?”.

Where buying art, voting, fundraising, and even social media were not controlled by a central company or intermediary, but rather an open-source, community-run network where code runs without interference. In 2013 Vitalik Buterin, an 18-year-old Bitcoin enthusiast and writer, proposed the tools to make that future possible. Less than a decade later, thousands of developers have contributed to building the Ethereum ecosystem: a technology that enables decentralized applications, including but not limited to money. For many, [Ethereum is building the internet of value](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-building-internet-of-value). \n\nBut as Ethereum grows in size and popularity, it faces mounting pressure from cutting-edge competitors, hype markets, and criticisms for its scalability and energy consumption. Spearheaded by a global team of researchers and developers, a push to upgrade the platform could address the criticisms and unlock the technology's full potential... or it could derail the still-budding $300 billion network. \n\nFollowing the high-stakes journey to upgrade the platform, ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN explores the innovative real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain, the die-hard community of enthusiasts and developers, and its creator, Vitalik Buterin, whose brilliant vision for the internet has the potential to change the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/96ec37d2-1253-4129-86c0-33693623101b.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### THE INFINITE GARDEN: \n\nIn this film, we approach Ethereum as an “infinite garden.” Instead of thinking of Ethereum as a machine controlled by a central brain, we see it as a decentralized ecosystem with soil, plants, and insects that need to be cared for in order to grow. \n\nThe idea of the infinite garden was conceptualized by Aya Miyaguchi, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. She was inspired by James P. Carse’s book *Finite and Infinite Games*. The following basic principles are at its core: \n\n- A finite game is played for the purpose of winning. An infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing the play.\n- The rules of finite games may not change; the rules of infinite games must change.\n- Finite players play within boundaries; Infinite players play without boundaries. \n- Finite players are serious; Infinite players are playful\n- Finite players play to win titles; Infinite players have nothing but their names\n- A finite player plays to be powerful; an infinite player plays with strength\n- Finite players are theatrical; infinite players are dramatic\n- A finite player consumes time; an infinite player generates time\n- The finite players aims to win eternal life; the infinite player aims for eternal birth\n\nThose who tend to the seeds they plant in the Ethereum garden can nurture and empower the ecosystem but can also harm it. For a crypto culture to remain equitable, decentralized, and sustainable, it must be tended to carefully. ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN will introduce us to these early “gardeners” of the platform as they face the mounting pressures and challenges of the growing ecosystem. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/66a1e300-6e0b-4fd5-812d-7a6a34e599a7.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT\n\nAs a kid, I grew up in a strictly open-source household. My dad’s radical adoration of Linux introduced me to the potential of community-led technology (and mind blowing internet [weirdness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5x5OXfe9KY)) before I was even in grade school. Today, I feel that same excitement my dad once felt, but for Ethereum and the unique community that powers it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d4406f2a-503f-46ec-ba6b-89db89fdd8df.jpeg?height=2336&width=8742&size=large)\n\nMy hope is to make Ethereum accessible and understandable to the world. By highlighting diverse stories from the global network of developers, founders, and end-users, we can create an emotional and human record of Ethereum’s journey. From the inspiring Axie Infinity gamers in the Philippines supporting their families during COVID to the tireless developers making Proof of Stake possible, there already is a bountiful garden to explore. \n\nThirty years from now, when our children look back from a world powered by programmable blockchain technology, they will wonder who was behind it, what challenges they faced, and what sacrifices they made. Instead of boring them with scattered memories and poor explanations of the “[Just Keep Chugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvr0xYeV94M)” meme, let's give them ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN.\n\n*-Zach Ingrasci, Director*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ed408928-e082-4606-ad6c-f393ec2fb501.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### Projected Timeline: \n\nThis past spring, the film team established an exclusive filming relationship with Vitalik Buterin and Aya Miyaguchi.

Game builders will play the game they are building; and game players will build the game they are playing. The $ELEKTRA token will come to establish the contribution graph of this project, and once the camp is finished — the *ElektraDAO* will be born. \n\n[Songcamp Elektra](crowdfund://0x612e8126b11F7D2596bE800278ecF2515C85aA5B?version=tiered_1&network=mainnet&features=overview)\n\n## The Portal to Elektra Is Now Open -- Secure Your *Ticket* NFT\nA portal has opened to another world. A world called *Elektra*. To access the portal, you must secure a *Portal Ticket* NFT. \n\nOnce secured, [enter the Portal to Elektra here](https://elektra.camp/).\n\n### There are a total of 6 *Portal Ticket* NFTs available. \n\nEach ticket gives you access to a different Portal Entry Point, and thus each ticket brings you to a different starting point in the game. This means that those with different *Portal Tickets* will work together to accomplish their collective mission.\n\nIn securing your *Portal Ticket*, you will also receive **$ELEKTRA** tokens — the currency native to Elektra. You will need these tokens to complete your mission. \n\n1. **The Hieroglyphic Ticket**: 1 of 1. Awarded to the 1st place backer. \n2. **The Ultrasonic Ticket**: 1 of 1.

Music is the fuel, electricity, and light of the world.\n\nCenturies ago, *Elektra* had a thriving civilization with a deep rooted sense of value towards art. But soon, motives around greed and self-interest took over, and the music that powered this world was lost.\n\nYour mission is to travel to *Elektra*, and help us collectively revive, restore and reignite this once beautiful world back to health.\n\n***Will you accept your mission?***\n\n\n[Phi Ticket](edition://0xEF3c951e22c65F6256746F4e227e19A5BcbF393C?editionId=3&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n[Psi Ticket](edition://0xEF3c951e22c65F6256746F4e227e19A5BcbF393C?editionId=2&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n[Chi Ticket](edition://0xEF3c951e22c65F6256746F4e227e19A5BcbF393C?editionId=1&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n## What is Songcamp Elektra?\n\n**Songcamp Elektra** is the second experiment created by *Songcamp* — a community of musicians, artists and strategists with a deep interest in learning what happens when **music** and **the new internet** crash into each other.\n\n*Songcamp* acts a lot like a **web3 laboratory** — experimenting at the far out edges of how web3 tools and tech can affect positive change in the lives and work of artists.\n\nThe *Songcamp Elektra* project is made up of ~42 artists, devs, project ops and strategists working together to bring this world to life. This crowdfund intends to raise the funds that will enable us to do just that. \n\n## Crowdfund Details\n\n* **90% to the *Elektra* project**\n* **10% to *Portal Tickets* visual team**\n\nWe will use 90% of the amount raised to put towards the *Elektra* project. \n\nThese funds will go toward the core team of project managers, web developers, artists and strategists working directly on the project. Other costs include transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, web hosting and file storage. We intend to save a portion of these funds to act as the *seed money* in standing up the *ElektraDAO* once this initial phase of the project is complete (more on that below).\n\nThe remaining 10% will go directly to the artists who created the *Portal Ticket* visuals.\n\n## Phase 1: Songcamp Elektra + The Elektra NFT Vault\n\n*Songcamp Elektra* will run for 4 weeks, until the first week of August. \n\nOnce through the portal, you will begin your journey. You will work with other players to move through this foreign land, discover more about the history of *Elektra*, and find your way to victory. \n\nIf successful, you will unlock the help you need — the people and items along the way that will help you accomplish your mission. Remember, **it is music that powers the world of *Elektra***. Luckily, you’ll have a lot of talented musicians to help along the way. You too may be summoned to assist in the music creation (should you wish to of course). :)\n\nAt times during the camp, 1-of-1 NFTs will be released. A 20% share of the proceeds from collected NFTs will go towards the ElektraDAO, while a select few of the NFTs will be placed in the Elektra Vault.\n\n## Phase 2: ElektraDAO + The $ELEKTRA Token\n\n> We will build a world, and own that world together. \n\nUpon purchasing your *Portal Ticket* NFT, you will also receive a portion of $ELEKTRA tokens based on the amount contributed. You will receive 100 $ELEKTRA for every 0.1 ETH you contribute to the crowdfund. \n\nThe project will retain 75% of $ELEKTRA’s supply, and distribute the majority to artists, devs, project ops and strategists working directly on the project. The remaining amount will be used to create bounty rewards for the wider network, as well as vest a portion in the treasury. \n\n**As this project evolves, the lines between creator and audience will blur.** Game builders will also play the game they are building; and game players will also help build the game they are playing. \n\nBy the end, we will have a community of contributors to the Elektra project that all hold $ELEKTRA tokens based on their contribution levels. At this point, **we will have *exited to community* — and the project will be owned and governed by $ELEKTRA token holders.** \n\n## Then What?\n\nWell, then it’s up to the network. \n\nThe *ElektraDAO* will have created an incredibly strong backbone:\n\n1. A core group of musicians, visual artists, devs, project ops, strategists and backers with sharp coordination and collaboration skills — plus an overflowing level of *squad energy*.\n2. 1-of-1 NFTs from the Elektra story secured in the DAO’s vault.\n3. A flow of royalties from the artwork created in-camp.\n\nWe then have the exciting opportunity to collectively decide what to do with all this. \n\nSome early ideas: make more art together, continue evolving the world and story of *Elektra*, experiment with and carve out new paths to monetization and value realization for the art we’ve created, or our personal favourite…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/troels_a/status/1413234727822180354\n\nBroadway, here we come.\n\n### Once you've secured your *Portal Ticket*, enter the Portal to Elektra:\n\nhttps://elektra.camp/", "timestamp": 1626141123, "digest": "mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc", "contributor": "0xfC4852B5e3aF65058CdfE1D1dce26946c0C1975f"}

Where buying art, voting, fundraising, and even social media were not controlled by a central company or intermediary, but rather an open-source, community-run network where code runs without interference. In 2013 Vitalik Buterin, an 18-year-old Bitcoin enthusiast and writer, proposed the tools to make that future possible. Less than a decade later, thousands of developers have contributed to building the Ethereum ecosystem: a technology that enables decentralized applications, including but not limited to money. For many, [Ethereum is building the internet of value](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-building-internet-of-value). \n\nBut as Ethereum grows in size and popularity, it faces mounting pressure from cutting-edge competitors, hype markets, and criticisms for its scalability and energy consumption. Spearheaded by a global team of researchers and developers, a push to upgrade the platform could address the criticisms and unlock the technology's full potential... or it could derail the still-budding $300 billion network. \n\nFollowing the high-stakes journey to upgrade the platform, ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN explores the innovative real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain, the die-hard community of enthusiasts and developers, and its creator, Vitalik Buterin, whose brilliant vision for the internet has the potential to change the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/96ec37d2-1253-4129-86c0-33693623101b.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### THE INFINITE GARDEN: \n\nIn this film, we approach Ethereum as an “infinite garden.” Instead of thinking of Ethereum as a machine controlled by a central brain, we see it as a decentralized ecosystem with soil, plants, and insects that need to be cared for in order to grow. \n\nThe idea of the infinite garden was conceptualized by Aya Miyaguchi, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. She was inspired by James P. Carse’s book *Finite and Infinite Games*. The following basic principles are at its core: \n\n- A finite game is played for the purpose of winning. An infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing the play.\n- The rules of finite games may not change; the rules of infinite games must change.\n- Finite players play within boundaries; Infinite players play without boundaries. \n- Finite players are serious; Infinite players are playful\n- Finite players play to win titles; Infinite players have nothing but their names\n- A finite player plays to be powerful; an infinite player plays with strength\n- Finite players are theatrical; infinite players are dramatic\n- A finite player consumes time; an infinite player generates time\n- The finite players aims to win eternal life; the infinite player aims for eternal birth\n\nThose who tend to the seeds they plant in the Ethereum garden can nurture and empower the ecosystem but can also harm it. For a crypto culture to remain equitable, decentralized, and sustainable, it must be tended to carefully. ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN will introduce us to these early “gardeners” of the platform as they face the mounting pressures and challenges of the growing ecosystem. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/66a1e300-6e0b-4fd5-812d-7a6a34e599a7.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT\n\nAs a kid, I grew up in a strictly open-source household. My dad’s radical adoration of Linux introduced me to the potential of community-led technology (and mind blowing internet [weirdness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5x5OXfe9KY)) before I was even in grade school. Today, I feel that same excitement my dad once felt, but for Ethereum and the unique community that powers it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d4406f2a-503f-46ec-ba6b-89db89fdd8df.jpeg?height=2336&width=8742&size=large)\n\nMy hope is to make Ethereum accessible and understandable to the world. By highlighting diverse stories from the global network of developers, founders, and end-users, we can create an emotional and human record of Ethereum’s journey. From the inspiring Axie Infinity gamers in the Philippines supporting their families during COVID to the tireless developers making Proof of Stake possible, there already is a bountiful garden to explore. \n\nThirty years from now, when our children look back from a world powered by programmable blockchain technology, they will wonder who was behind it, what challenges they faced, and what sacrifices they made. Instead of boring them with scattered memories and poor explanations of the “[Just Keep Chugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvr0xYeV94M)” meme, let's give them ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN.\n\n*-Zach Ingrasci, Director*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ed408928-e082-4606-ad6c-f393ec2fb501.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### Projected Timeline: \n\nThis past spring, the film team established an exclusive filming relationship with Vitalik Buterin and Aya Miyaguchi.

But maybe that's the point?\n\nI was recently asked when DAOs will feel more like installing an app and there are definitely accessibility hurdles to be overcome for these organisations to become a common phenomenon in music. Here's my thoughts.\n\nFirstly, I do think we'll see **DAOs become mainstream, but not until some of the least user-friendly aspects are resolved**. Setting up wallets, gas costs and treating mobile as an afterthought are 3 points of friction that come to mind. I'll dive into them here.\n\nSecondly, the point of a DAO is to organise as a group on your own terms, using your own tools, and participating in the value you generate together. Part of that value may be represented as shares in the project (in the form of tokens) and part of it may be cash (in the form of cryptocurrency). That's complex and usually requires all sorts of documents, contracts and perhaps even notaries. So in that sense, **the expectation to make DAOs as simple as installing an app is unrealistic**, but further maturing of tooling will definitely make things easier.\n\n## Wallets\nIn order to participate in DAOs you'll need a 'wallet'. I recently recorded a [10 minute how-to](https://musicx.mirror.xyz/aFsodqVCC0JTCQ48z002Gecdkq0w9-2tGa-YqXp3BB0), that actually turned out to be 30 minutes long, which highlights some of the complexity well. \n\nhttps://musicx.mirror.xyz/aFsodqVCC0JTCQ48z002Gecdkq0w9-2tGa-YqXp3BB0\n\nThis wallet allows you to participate on the blockchain utilized by the DAO. It lets you make transactions, interact with smart contracts, send and receive tokens (incl. NFTs), as well as cryptocurrency. It also functions like a single sign-on that you can use to interact with blockchain-based tools, platforms, and communities.\n\nThere's a way around the wallet requirement: you could do things 'off-chain' for people without a wallet, which means the organisation centrally records transactions & what people are owed without writing it to a blockchain. Whoever has a wallet can move all their assets 'on-chain'. Many tools, like [Collab.land](https://collab.land/), already do this by recording your tokens alongside a user ID such as your Discord account until you withdraw them to a wallet that has a blockchain address.\n\n🔮 I expect Facebook to eventually integrate wallets into their offering. This means that people would be able to open a wallet on the social network and be able to use Facebook's one-click login on web3 platforms too. This will remove a lot of friction from the space ([although I really don't think you should be using Facebook](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/04/06/deplatform-yourself-how-to-leave-facebook-instagram-whatsapp/)).\n\n🔮 I also expect banks and financial tools like PayPal & Cash App to eventually have wallets for Ethereum & other popular blockchains. They're already doing Bitcoin.\n\n## Gas costs\nShortly after I published my video about [how to set up a cryptowallet](https://musicx.mirror.xyz/aFsodqVCC0JTCQ48z002Gecdkq0w9-2tGa-YqXp3BB0), the transaction fees (gas costs) on the Ethereum network climbed to around $50. That means that even if you're trying to perform something that's free of charge, you may still have to pay $50.\n\nGas costs have recently been a lot lower, but no matter the sum, it will take education to explain to people why certain interactions require money on an internet where everything has always felt like free. It depends who I'm explaining it to, but I tend to explain that instead of selling your data to advertisers in exchange for a service, you pay the network directly to process your transaction and host all the data. But how does a musician explain this to their fans?\n\nHere, too, doing certain things 'off-chain' can help cut costs, but decentralization gets sacrificed.\n\n🔮 Ethereum's transition to [Proof of Stake](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/) will help a lot. I also expect ecosystems around other blockchains like [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) and [Flow](https://www.onflow.org/) to mature, which have both found their own ways to keep gas costs low.\n\n## Mobile as an afterthought\nMobile phones are the world's most important personal computer. For most people around the world, they're the *only* real personal computer they have access to; that's just theirs and doesn't have to be shared. \n\nUnfortunately, many web3 projects highly prioritize the desktop experience. It's understandable why: that's the environment in which builders are creating, so especially in this early stage it's hard to expect everything to be perfect on mobile phones. There's a thin line between afterthought and neglect however and if we're serious about onboarding people to web3, we have to do *a lot* better on mobile.\n\n🔮 The size of the opportunity of making the web3 accessible to the mainstream will drive organisations to prioritize mobile. Currently, a lot of the pieces are still being put in place, but I expect a period of growth to follow especially once some of the other clunky aspects mentioned in this article get ironed out. That's when the web3 goes mobile.\n\n## What does it mean for music?\nMy guess is we're about 1.5 to 2 years away from things like NFTs and DAOs going mainstream. The biggest obstacle is user-friendliness. DAOs don't have to be as easy to install as an app, but right now it will be hard for artists to onboard their audience to a [fanbase DAO](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/06/01/the-decentralized-autonomous-1000-true-fan-organisation/). While artists with 'crypto native' fanbases may be able to gain traction with a DAO, the barriers will remain high for most other artists. What those artists could do is tap into creator economy trends and tooling in order to set up the foundation of their community in a more centralized way and then extend it with web3 aspects that may not appeal to everyone straight away.

So when I saw my cardiologist recently, I asked him how I could track my beats. I have worn a Holter Monitor a few times and did not want to do that again unless it was absolutely necessary. He pointed me to this [Kardia Mobile](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RQW6SD5/) device which I purchased on Amazon a few weeks ago.\n\nThis Kardia Mobile 6L device is remarkable. It delivers a “6 lead” EKG reading into your smartphone by putting the device on your knee and pressing both thumbs on it. I realize that 6 leads is not the same as what you get with a Holter Monitor or an EKG in your doctor’s office. But it is really amazing because it is so easy to use in your own home. It is the size of an Apple TV remote, maybe even a tad smaller. I just email my cardiologist the result and he tells me what is going on without him having to take fifteen minutes or more to see me and without me having to visit his office.\n\nThis is just one example of the revolution underway in health care. Driven by advances in technology, a computer in everyone’s pocket, ongoing changes in the healthcare system accelerated by the pandemic, among other forcing functions, we are seeing more and more healthcare being accessed in our homes vs in the doctor’s office.\n\nThis does not mean that doctors are needed less. I think they are needed more. But they can focus their time and energy where it is most needed, in providing the care itself vs all of the other things that lead to the care.\n\nThis has the potential to both increase access to care and also reduce the cost of it. We will need other changes to the healthcare system for those things to be realized. We will need the healthcare system to move away from a business model based on the provision of care in favor of a business model based on outcomes. We will need the power of the payors to be reduced in favor of the power of the patients. Those changes must be driven by society/politics and they won’t come easy.\n\nBut the conditions are ripe for a reshaping of the healthcare system. Entrepreneurs (like the folks who made the Kardia Mobile device) and risk capital can and will be an important force in driving that change.\n", "timestamp": 1626177461, "digest": "ePTyi1w8gSdgKclbSeRmrDPs5v8XITJmSeoHz6rq900", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

What those artists could do is tap into creator economy trends and tooling in order to set up the foundation of their community in a more centralized way and then extend it with web3 aspects that may not appeal to everyone straight away.

What personal price would you pay? Would you change yourself into someone — or something — other than who you are?\n\nThese are the questions *The Dog Lover* asks, and that our main character, Walter, must answer. \nWhen Walter’s wife’s beloved dog Max dies, her grief is crushing. Walter works hard to fill the aching void in her heart, but nothing seems to please her. Walter soon discovers that he can win Sarah’s love by acting like her dog. \n\nIt isn’t long before the couple begins to rekindle their romance through these strange circumstances. Things are looking up, until Walter realizes that this particular pathway to love is paved with all sorts of bizarre pitfalls. A little too bizarre, perhaps. It soon becomes clear to Walter that he must choose whether he’s willing to be his wife’s dog. \n\n*The Dog Lover* is a weird, offbeat story with elements of dark comedy and horror. But it also has an emotional core that is deeply relatable: at one point or another, we’ve all had to decide if we’re going to be someone’s dog (so to speak) or risk loneliness. Needless to say, we don’t always make the right decision. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ae011db6-1fe1-43b1-9c24-df54ac3823fb.jpeg?height=1072&width=1910)\n\n\n\nThe trailer above is cut from footage from the original short we made together during our first year at the American Film Institute Conservatory (the number one film school in the US according to the Hollywood Reporter).

{"id": "EffzF34NIGDVXjuB1WCsvWP0PxXQgm_wSOW7lkUNXGI", "title": "The web3's user-friendliness barrier for music", "body": "Setting up a Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) is a clunky affair when compared to more centralized variants. But maybe that's the point?\n\nI was recently asked **when DAOs will feel more like installing an app** and there are definitely accessibility hurdles to be overcome for these organisations to become a common phenomenon in music. Here's my thoughts.\n\nFirstly, I do think we'll see **DAOs become mainstream, but not until some of the least user-friendly aspects are resolved**. Setting up wallets, gas costs and treating mobile as an afterthought are 3 points of friction that come to mind. I'll dive into them here.\n\nSecondly, the point of a DAO is to organise as a group on your own terms, using your own tools, and participating in the value you generate together. Part of that value may be represented as shares in the project (in the form of tokens) and part of it may be cash (in the form of cryptocurrency). That's complex and usually requires all sorts of documents, contracts and perhaps even notaries. So in that sense, **the expectation to make DAOs as simple as installing an app is unrealistic**, but further maturing of tooling will definitely make things easier.\n\n## Wallets\nIn order to participate in DAOs you'll need a 'wallet'. I recently recorded a [10 minute how-to](https://musicx.mirror.xyz/aFsodqVCC0JTCQ48z002Gecdkq0w9-2tGa-YqXp3BB0), that actually turned out to be 30 minutes long, which highlights some of the complexity well. \n\nhttps://musicx.mirror.xyz/aFsodqVCC0JTCQ48z002Gecdkq0w9-2tGa-YqXp3BB0\n\nThis wallet allows you to participate on the blockchain utilized by the DAO. It lets you make transactions, interact with smart contracts, send and receive tokens (incl. NFTs), as well as cryptocurrency. It also functions like a single sign-on that you can use to interact with blockchain-based tools, platforms, and communities.\n\nThere's a way around the wallet requirement: you could do things 'off-chain' for people without a wallet, which means the organisation centrally records transactions & what people are owed without writing it to a blockchain. Whoever has a wallet can move all their assets 'on-chain'. Many tools, like [Collab.land](https://collab.land/), already do this by recording your tokens alongside a user ID such as your Discord account until you withdraw them to a wallet that has a blockchain address.\n\n🔮 I expect Facebook to eventually integrate wallets into their offering. This means that people would be able to open a wallet on the social network and be able to use Facebook's one-click login on web3 platforms too. This will remove a lot of friction from the space ([although I really don't think you should be using Facebook](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/04/06/deplatform-yourself-how-to-leave-facebook-instagram-whatsapp/)).\n\n🔮 I also expect banks and financial tools like PayPal & Cash App to eventually have wallets for Ethereum & other popular blockchains. They're already doing Bitcoin.\n\n## Gas costs\nShortly after I published my video about [how to set up a cryptowallet](https://musicx.mirror.xyz/aFsodqVCC0JTCQ48z002Gecdkq0w9-2tGa-YqXp3BB0), the transaction fees (gas costs) on the Ethereum network climbed to around $50. That means that even if you're trying to perform something that's free of charge, you may still have to pay $50.\n\nGas costs have recently been a lot lower, but no matter the sum, it will take education to explain to people why certain interactions require money on an internet where everything has always felt like free. It depends who I'm explaining it to, but I tend to explain that instead of selling your data to advertisers in exchange for a service, you pay the network directly to process your transaction and host all the data. But how does a musician explain this to their fans?\n\nHere, too, doing certain things 'off-chain' can help cut costs, but decentralization gets sacrificed.\n\n🔮 Ethereum's transition to [Proof of Stake](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/) will help a lot. I also expect ecosystems around other blockchains like [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) and [Flow](https://www.onflow.org/) to mature, which have both found their own ways to keep gas costs low.\n\n## Mobile as an afterthought\nMobile phones are the world's most important personal computer. For most people around the world, they're the *only* real personal computer they have access to; that's just theirs and doesn't have to be shared. \n\nUnfortunately, many web3 projects highly prioritize the desktop experience. It's understandable why: that's the environment in which builders are creating, so especially in this early stage it's hard to expect everything to be perfect on mobile phones. There's a thin line between afterthought and neglect however and if we're serious about onboarding people to web3, we have to do *a lot* better on mobile.\n\n🔮 The size of the opportunity of making the web3 accessible to the mainstream will drive organisations to prioritize mobile. Currently, a lot of the pieces are still being put in place, but I expect a period of growth to follow especially once some of the other clunky aspects mentioned in this article get ironed out. That's when the web3 goes mobile.\n\n## What does it mean for music?\nMy guess is we're about 1.5 to 2 years away from things like NFTs and DAOs going mainstream. The biggest obstacle is user-friendliness. DAOs don't have to be as easy to install as an app, but right now it will be hard for artists to onboard their audience to a [fanbase DAO](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/06/01/the-decentralized-autonomous-1000-true-fan-organisation/). While artists with 'crypto native' fanbases may be able to gain traction with a DAO, the barriers will remain high for most other artists. What those artists could do is tap into creator economy trends and tooling in order to set up the foundation of their community in a more centralized way and then extend it with web3 aspects that may not appeal to everyone straight away. The same goes for [event organisers](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/06/08/the-community-owned-rave-event-organisers-as-daos/).\n\n-\nPhoto by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@marfen71?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Martin Fennema</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/fence?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a>", "timestamp": 1626187552, "digest": "Kx8Wvi1K9S97IHjkdzhzw-HYPegtbopA6KLvjoJUa_8", "contributor": "0xe612d9C2a9bA0Ff4403F4f7Ea87D5bE4290aC7B9"}

Because the old  models of fundraising are lacking. Traditionally, crowdfunding campaigns are the only way young artists like us can bring our visions to life. Art is essential: bringing people meaning, comfort, and community. But with the current infrastructure, art can be really difficult to make and share with the world: we’re often forced to put a lot of our own money, hard work and time into projects without compensation.. Often, we have to sign away ownership of our creative vision to companies that hold our art and our creative rights hostage. It goes both ways, too: fans are just fans, and donors don’t get much in return for their financial contribution.\n\n[The Dog Lover](crowdfund://0x1B121c25336648378eFc907ab88A34C9B6952984?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=overview)\n\nWith this experiment in a crypto-funded model of filmmaking, we want to pave the way for change.

What personal price would you pay? Would you change yourself into someone — or something — other than who you are?\n\nThese are the questions *The Dog Lover* asks, and that our main character, Walter, must answer. \nWhen Walter’s wife’s beloved dog Max dies, her grief is crushing. Walter works hard to fill the aching void in her heart, but nothing seems to please her. Walter soon discovers that he can win Sarah’s love by acting like her dog. \n\nIt isn’t long before the couple begins to rekindle their romance through these strange circumstances. Things are looking up, until Walter realizes that this particular pathway to love is paved with all sorts of bizarre pitfalls. A little too bizarre, perhaps. It soon becomes clear to Walter that he must choose whether he’s willing to be his wife’s dog. \n\n*The Dog Lover* is a weird, offbeat story with elements of dark comedy and horror. But it also has an emotional core that is deeply relatable: at one point or another, we’ve all had to decide if we’re going to be someone’s dog (so to speak) or risk loneliness. Needless to say, we don’t always make the right decision. \n\nThe trailer above is cut from footage from the original short we made together during our first year at the American Film Institute Conservatory (the number one film school in the US according to the Hollywood Reporter). With this new version, we’re going to expand and perfect the story and utilize the skills we developed during our time at AFI. \n\n\n### MEET THE TEAM\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9ec11675-df2e-4bfb-a6e7-8c7e4e461309.jpeg?height=320&width=213)\n\n**DIRECTOR: ANNE-SOPHIE BINE**\nFrench and Polish background, Anne-Sophie Bine was raised in several different countries — which may be why she speaks five languages.

But soon, motives around greed and self-interest took over, and the music that powered this world was lost.\n>\n> Your mission is to travel to *Elektra*, and help us collectively revive, restore and reignite this once beautiful world back to health.\n>\n> ***Will you accept your mission?***\n\nThe team is significant:\n\n> The *Songcamp Elektra* project is made up of \\~42 artists, devs, project ops and strategists working together to bring this world to life. This crowdfund intends to raise the funds that will enable us to do just that.\n\nAnd props for disclosing how you plan to use the funds:\n\n> We will use 90% of the amount raised to put towards the *Elektra* project.\n>\n> These funds will go toward the core team of project managers, web developers, artists and strategists working directly on the project. Other costs include transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, web hosting and file storage. We intend to save a portion of these funds to act as the *seed money* in standing up the *ElektraDAO* once this initial phase of the project is complete (more on that below).\n>\n> The remaining 10% will go directly to the artists who created the *Portal Ticket* visuals.\n", "timestamp": 1626207159, "digest": "WGnBjXFoZs-UWxDcrZ8_-d4uFIpnMZZVThx2aFDfrrE", "contributor": "0xD9C4475E2dd89a9a0aD0C1E9a1e1bb28Df7BA298"}
