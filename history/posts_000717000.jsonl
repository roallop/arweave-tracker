I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn’t meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you’d think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend’s living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn’t just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it’s not just a technology. It’s a philosophy. It’s a belief system. It’s a way of viewing the world. It’s about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you’re batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood. I remember the “aha moment” when I wrote my first smart contract. With just a few lines of code and a private key, I was able to transfer an internet-native currency anywhere in the world in seconds. \n\nI didn’t have to sign up for Stripe. I didn’t have to use the Plaid API to connect a bank account. I didn’t have to check if TransferWise supported payments for a specific country. There was no centralized party. Just a peer-to-peer cryptonetwork called Ethereum. It was pretty damn mindblowing.\n\nAfter the first few weeks at Dharma, I was confident that DeFi and crypto were the future. But I also got the itch to work on some of my own ideas. I wanted to build software for creative people. Writers. Artists. Musicians. Online teachers. I strongly believe our world depends on these types of people having the tools they need to serve their communities as best they can.\n\nFrankly, I also thought it would take a couple years before the crypto industry had the infrastructure in place for a mainstream consumer app to be built.\n\n\nSo I ended up leaving Dharma to take some time off and explore a few startup ideas. But a couple months ago I read a [manifesto](https://cryptomedia.wtf/) by [Zora](https://zora.co/) that changed how I thought about crypto.\n\nIt described a world where crypto could be used to give any digital media file (eg an image, a song, an essay, digital art, etc.) property rights. It explained how cryptonetworks could turn digital media into liquid financial assets, secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts.\n\nAlthough the individual ideas weren’t new, they were combined and articulated in a way that just made sense. And not just to me.\n\n[Digital artists](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9), [athletes](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html), [social media influencers](https://cryptoslate.com/logan-paul-nfts-sell-3-5-million-worth-on-first-day-of-release/), [tech executives](https://scottbelsky.medium.com/the-furry-lisa-cryptoart-the-new-economy-of-digital-creativity-6cb2300ea081), [media executives](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI), and [journalists](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1366554892035219462) that never took the crypto weirdos seriously, seem to be taking notice.\n\nBut let’s be real. Is this latest NFT craze a bubble? Probz. Yet, is there at least a kernel of value in the idea of ownership over creative work? I think so.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell, there’s been a lot of talk about high transaction fees and lack of scalability in these systems. Although I do think these problems should and will get fixed, a lack of technical scalability is kinda the point.\n\nCryptonetworks trade off technical scalability for social scalability.\n\nFacebook is technically scalable because it’s a social network that processes millions of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is socially scalable because it’s a trillion dollar economic network without a centralized authority.\n\nCrypto isn’t just a technological revolution. It’s also a revolution in capital formation and human coordination. How creative projects are funded. How groups of people are incentivized. How organizations are structured.\n\nYears from now, when I’m old and senile, I believe we’ll look back at this period as an [Internet Renaissance](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1343210395704541189) of sorts. \n\nA time where we dared to fight back against systems that have been designed for centuries to elevate certain groups and keep others disenfranchised.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe all this crypto stuff really is just an intellectual ideal that’ll never work in practice. Regardless, I think it’s at least worth trying.", "timestamp": 1624984213, "digest": "pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

They had the option of dropping their debut Catalog records in tandem *or* whenever they wanted. The group overwhelmingly voted to move forward together. Enter the inaugural Catalog Community Week, just the latest [foghorn-blaring signal](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/K9i_cjk1zep0ESfu71Wj5by2zrHOIopAvZ5iSmDJYY0) that there’s a new golden era brewing in the ether. \n\nThis time around, that signal carried the transmissions of [megiapa](https://beta.catalog.works/megiapa/monday), [Mark de Clive-Lowe](https://beta.catalog.works/mdcl), [Starkey](https://beta.catalog.works/starkey/yung-jupit3r-skies-are-open), [Adder](https://beta.catalog.works/adder/extremely-na-ve), [Bozo Nightmare](https://beta.catalog.works/bozo-nightmare/silver-painted-tears), [GREGNWMN](https://beta.catalog.works/gregnwmn/solar-flare-feat-carter-ace-), [30exp](https://beta.catalog.works/30exp/vortex-feat-swanks-prod-by-30exp-), [Death Hags](https://beta.catalog.works/death-hags/looking-for-a-big-grey-sun-caustic-rework-), [Gavin Gamboa](https://beta.catalog.works/gavcloud/-1-o-p-us-), [0x-Jitzu](https://beta.catalog.works/0x-jitzu/veloop), [Christopher Stracey](https://beta.catalog.works/christopherstracey/unfolding), [trey willis](https://beta.catalog.works/treywillismusic/get-back), [Xcelencia](https://beta.catalog.works/xcelencia/problema), [Lafayette Stokely](https://beta.catalog.works/lifeofstokely/listen-to-your-heart), and [Vitalii Dominichenko](https://beta.catalog.works/vitalii-dominichenko/-eternity). In other words, lots of globetrotting, jaw-dropping, playlist-puzzling sounds, from soloist piano pieces that [reinforce links to ancestral homelands](https://beta.catalog.works/mdcl/akatombo) to fuzzy 808s underpinning ingenious punchlines ([“I’mma jump from the rooftop, land right on top of the forecast”](https://beta.catalog.works/30exp/vortex-feat-swanks-prod-by-30exp-)), all shared between June 21 and June 27, 2021. \n\nJust days before the Catalog Community Week kicked off, we were voted through Mirror's pearly gates. We decided to hold off on publishing until now, using our first post to unify the special songs that came out and spotlight the people behind them, in their own words. It features lots of context direct from the source(s), an easy means of supporting everyone involved via direct patronage, and a bit of backstory. Let’s start with how we got here then get to the good stuff (the play button).\n\nDecades ago, way back in December of 2020, we unveiled a dark mode, barebones landing page hinting at what would eventually become v0 of Catalog: a web3 world where new music formats are possible and experiments are the point, not fring. We also encouraged artists excited by the possibilities to join us in [Discord](http://catalog.community/) and sign up for email updates with launch details. Our day ones, basically.\n\nWe’ve been out in the wild for a little more than three months now, collaborating with both friends and internet strangers to test the waters while sorting out the initial working version of where we’re headed. [Modest gains have been made](https://twitter.com/TableNifty/status/1397946851043725325?s=20) in proving the value of one-of-one digital records. And more and more people are seeing the importance of songs with built-in value capture mechanisms that outlive their host platforms, ours included. There's quite a lot left to do (we’ve only built .1% of what we envision), but the most glaring omission to date, until last week's rollouts, were fewer early-bird believers releasing on Catalog than there should have been. We wanted to celebrate more of the folks who had waited patiently in the trenches.\n\nTo fix that, with decentralized onboarding and curation still on the drawing board, we invited everyone on the waitlist to confirm their interest in releasing music on Catalog and share what they were proud of. Then we simply listened, listened, listened. No glancing at Instagram followers. No ogling over Spotify monthly listeners. We just listened. It’d be an understatement to say we loved what we heard, and who we’ve met as a result. \n\nOur hope is to repeat some version of this process as a stop-gap method for highlighting the talented people who want to help shape what this project becomes. To that end, please consider supporting this post via the tip block below. All proceeds will be split amongst the artists who participated in this initial Catalog Community Week :) \n\n[Support every artist at once 💽](split://0x977e5C178f3308e831D035b1b508602348F6ddCe?network=mainnet)\n\nNow, as promised, the good stuff. Take a few minutes to listen to each record, then get to know the artists a little better by reading what they had to say about their first release. After catching a glimpse of their adventures to date, we hope you choose to become a part of their story from here.

I produced and recorded this song during 2020 as a sort of remedy to move through the endless news cycles and restless pandemic. Writing it helped me keep my things in frame, which is a constant effort—stay humble, helpful, confident, kind, mindful, resilient, and all the sweet things in between. When I'm producing and writing music, I'm often reflecting on sentiments from my life and the current moment. 'Monday' is an example of me working through it out loud... I hope you enjoy <3\n \n## Gavin Gamboa - [\"+ [ 1 ( O ) p | us ]\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gavcloud/-1-o-p-us-)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3763)\n \n> **Gavin Gamboa:** It has been 10 years since the release of what I consider the first major work I composed, a String Sextet that took to Arnold Schoenberg's \"Verklärte Nacht\" for guidance. With the help of friends/collaborators, a group of phenomenal instrumentalists was assembled and we recorded it in an acoustically vibrant space (what is now the Bakery Building at Hauser & Wirth in Los Angeles). Composing a large instrumental work was a daunting idea for me in my mid twenties, as I had no formal training in composition and was dealing with whatever doubt which comes with that territory. But looking back now with the expanded knowledge that I have gained not only of music but also about art and life in general (and especially generative algorithmic electronic music) I wanted to wholeheartedly acknowledge that younger version of myself with a new piece commemorating this last decade of experience and creating. The timing with being able to press and release [\"+ [ 1 ( O ) p | us ]\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gavcloud/-1-o-p-us-) on Catalog feels serendipitous and in-alignment with my goals of continuing to produce independent music. This is a piece which has emerged in the form of a new, electronically processed, chaos version of its former self, in resemblance with how the disruption caused by web3 and blockchain technologies are transforming what has come before, and granting artists new levels of autonomy and control over the distribution process.\n\n## Bozo Nightmare - [\"Silver Painted Tears\"](https://beta.catalog.works/bozo-nightmare/silver-painted-tears)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3774)\n\n> **Bozo Nightmare:** We went with [\"Silver Painted Tears\"](https://beta.catalog.works/bozo-nightmare/silver-painted-tears) for our first release because we like abstraction and this song was the purest expression we had of that. We're probably most proud of the ending. It's kind of got one of those impressionistic false endings that the Beatles made popular (think \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" or \"Hello, Goodbye\") and almost hints at a lost section or remix of the song that does not exist (or does it?). The abstraction is there in the vocals, the lyrical content, the style and structure. It leaves a lot of room for what we can do next without pointing in any specific direction. We’ve just always wanted to experiment with songs, sounds and ideas, and this track seemed like the perfect starting point for whatever we want to do next.\n\n## Lafayette Stokely - [\"Listen To Your Heart\"](https://beta.catalog.works/lifeofstokely/listen-to-your-heart)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3756)\n\n> **Lafayette Stokely:** I live in my head so my music is usually me venting to myself. [\"Listen To Your Heart\"](https://beta.catalog.works/lifeofstokely/listen-to-your-heart) is just that, me reflecting on my situation and reaffirming that I’m on the right path. \"How can I look into my daughters eyes and tell them daddy never chased his dreams / Then turn right around and tell them that you can be all that you want to be\" is my favorite line because it not only represents my drive to give my daughters the world but to also teach them that anything is possible.

This track is special to me and tells the journey and inner struggle of making the same mistakes over and over again, living in darkness, but reaching up for help and finding my way back to the light. [\"Get Back\"](https://beta.catalog.works/treywillismusic/get-back) was birthed from a Louis Futon producer challenge on Splice. Producers were to create an original track using one or more samples from the Louis Futon “pretty cool sounds Vol. 2” sample pack. I am generally a lot more inspired creating my own sounds and samples, but wanted to challenge myself to see what I could create using someone else’s samples. I ended up using 28 samples from the pack, and tried to tweak each one to make it my own. I also used some of my own samples, an Omnisphere patch, wavetable patch, and a Moog Sirin for the bass and leads. I tracked everything in Ableton.

The beat itself [of [\"VORTEX\"](https://beta.catalog.works/30exp/vortex-feat-swanks-prod-by-30exp-)] was a turning point in the way I understand my own process of creation. As for the song, the way it came together from the beat to the demo to the final mix and art direction was a collaborative effort, that is I'd say the best part.\n \n## Adder (f/k/a/ Wild Kid) - [\"Extremely Naïve\"](https://beta.catalog.works/adder/extremely-na-ve)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3739)\n \n> **Adder:** [\"Extremely Naïve\"](https://beta.catalog.works/adder/extremely-na-ve) is the first in a new project under a new name, Adder. Until now I've released music as Wild Kid, but I felt that that project had run its course. The biggest change is that whereas Wild Kid was an instrumental project, Adder features my own vocals. With Wild Kid, the challenge motivating the project was to create a sense of narrative and personal vulnerability—which I thought could sometimes be missing from electronic music—without the use of lyrics and vocals. I had been singing in choirs and groups since I was 13, but I just wasn't interested in writing songs, so that never made it into my own music. For years, that challenge really interested me, but recently the motivation began to fade. I started to feel like it was time to incorporate this new element into my process and take on a set of challenges I had sort of been subconsciously avoiding: how to record and process my own vocals, how to use my voice as a sonic tool, and how to write lyrics. It's a whole new writing approach, and making space for my voice in arrangements is reforming my production style. Learning to produce my vocals is kind of like learning to make music all over again. This release is very distinctly the first page in a new chapter for me.\n \n## GREGNWMN - [\"SOLAR FLARE\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gregnwmn/solar-flare-feat-carter-ace-)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3737)\n \n> **GREGNWMN:** [\"SOLAR FLARE\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gregnwmn/solar-flare-feat-carter-ace-) carries a heavy tone of introspection, transparency, urgency for me. This record stood out as the perfect fit to begin my journey with Catalog based on the progressive energy surrounding not only the platform, but the arrangement of the narrative comprised on the record itself. After finding myself driving home from working two 8-hour shifts back to back, all my mind was focused on was the new verse I wrote the day before. There was a crazy glare coming from the freeway that made the whole road look like it was made of gold. In that moment, the early remnants of \"SOLAR FLARE\" began, building off of the idea that regardless of the drive we may have, our goals & desires may blind us in the process. As the artists/creatives of tomorrow, we are always pushing the boundaries of what we consider to be valuable. Some of those experiences manifested themselves into the verses performed on \"SOLAR FLARE,\" which mirrored not only some of mine & Carter’s journey, but hopefully the journey of the listener as well.\n\n## Xcelencia - [\"Problema\"](https://beta.catalog.works/xcelencia/problema)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3766)\n\n> **Xcelencia:** My first Catalog press, [\"Problema,\"](https://beta.catalog.works/xcelencia/problema) is curated from a volume of work I developed during quarantine. There was a pressure to try new things, sounds, and even explore distinct genres during the quarantine but sometimes it's important to stay true to your roots and this release reminds me of when I first started creating music over eight years ago. This specific single was selected to kick off the summer and experiment with as my first audio NFT. Latin music and in particular Reggaeton is experiencing a renaissance in the music industry. What better way to honor that than by bringing that lineage to a nascent format, one that aims to be an outlet for independent creators looking to pave the way for their careers in the *new* music industry? Everything from getting my first headline show at SXSW to my first 30 million streams on Spotify has led me to this moment.

They had the option of dropping their debut Catalog records in tandem *or* whenever they wanted. The group overwhelmingly voted to move forward together. Enter the inaugural Catalog Community Week, just the latest [foghorn-blaring signal](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/K9i_cjk1zep0ESfu71Wj5by2zrHOIopAvZ5iSmDJYY0) that there’s a new golden era brewing in the ether. \n\nThis time around, that signal carried the transmissions of [megiapa](https://beta.catalog.works/megiapa/monday), [Mark de Clive-Lowe](https://beta.catalog.works/mdcl), [Starkey](https://beta.catalog.works/starkey/yung-jupit3r-skies-are-open), [Adder](https://beta.catalog.works/adder/extremely-na-ve), [Bozo Nightmare](https://beta.catalog.works/bozo-nightmare/silver-painted-tears), [GREGNWMN](https://beta.catalog.works/gregnwmn/solar-flare-feat-carter-ace-), [30exp](https://beta.catalog.works/30exp/vortex-feat-swanks-prod-by-30exp-), [Death Hags](https://beta.catalog.works/death-hags/looking-for-a-big-grey-sun-caustic-rework-), [Gavin Gamboa](https://beta.catalog.works/gavcloud/-1-o-p-us-), [0x-Jitzu](https://beta.catalog.works/0x-jitzu/veloop), [Christopher Stracey](https://beta.catalog.works/christopherstracey/unfolding), [trey willis](https://beta.catalog.works/treywillismusic/get-back), [Xcelencia](https://beta.catalog.works/xcelencia/problema), [Lafayette Stokely](https://beta.catalog.works/lifeofstokely/listen-to-your-heart), and [Vitalii Dominichenko](https://beta.catalog.works/vitalii-dominichenko/-eternity). In other words, lots of globetrotting, jaw-dropping, playlist-puzzling sounds, from soloist piano pieces that [reinforce links to ancestral homelands](https://beta.catalog.works/mdcl/akatombo) to fuzzy 808s underpinning ingenious punchlines ([“I’mma jump from the rooftop, land right on top of the forecast”](https://beta.catalog.works/30exp/vortex-feat-swanks-prod-by-30exp-)), all shared between June 21 and June 27, 2021. \n\nJust days before the Catalog Community Week kicked off, we were voted through Mirror's pearly gates. We decided to hold off on publishing until now, using our first post to unify the special songs that came out and spotlight the people behind them, in their own words. It features lots of context direct from the source(s), an easy means of supporting everyone involved via direct patronage, and a bit of backstory. Let’s start with how we got here then get to the good stuff (the play button).\n\nDecades ago, way back in December of 2020, we unveiled a dark mode, barebones landing page hinting at what would eventually become v0 of Catalog: a web3 world where new music formats are possible and experiments are the point, not fring. We also encouraged artists excited by the possibilities to join us in [Discord](http://catalog.community/) and sign up for email updates with launch details. Our day ones, basically.\n\nWe’ve been out in the wild for a little more than three months now, collaborating with both friends and internet strangers to test the waters while sorting out the initial working version of where we’re headed. [Modest gains have been made](https://twitter.com/TableNifty/status/1397946851043725325?s=20) in proving the value of one-of-one digital records. And more and more people are seeing the importance of songs with built-in value capture mechanisms that outlive their host platforms, ours included. There's quite a lot left to do (we’ve only built .1% of what we envision), but the most glaring omission to date, until last week's rollouts, were fewer early-bird believers releasing on Catalog than there should have been. We wanted to celebrate more of the folks who had waited patiently in the trenches.\n\nTo fix that, with decentralized onboarding and curation still on the drawing board, we invited everyone on the waitlist to confirm their interest in releasing music on Catalog and share what they were proud of. Then we simply listened, listened, listened. No glancing at Instagram followers. No ogling over Spotify monthly listeners. We just listened. It’d be an understatement to say we loved what we heard, and who we’ve met as a result. \n\nOur hope is to repeat some version of this process as a stop-gap method for highlighting the talented people who want to help shape what this project becomes. To that end, please consider supporting this post via the tip block below. All proceeds will be split amongst the artists who participated in this initial Catalog Community Week :) \n\n[Support every artist at once 💽](split://0x977e5C178f3308e831D035b1b508602348F6ddCe?network=mainnet)\n\nNow, as promised, the good stuff. Take a few minutes to listen to each record, then get to know the artists a little better by reading what they had to say about their first release. After catching a glimpse of their adventures to date, we hope you choose to become a part of their story from here.

I produced and recorded this song during 2020 as a sort of remedy to move through the endless news cycles and restless pandemic. Writing it helped me keep my things in frame, which is a constant effort—stay humble, helpful, confident, kind, mindful, resilient, and all the sweet things in between. When I'm producing and writing music, I'm often reflecting on sentiments from my life and the current moment. 'Monday' is an example of me working through it out loud...

With the help of friends/collaborators, a group of phenomenal instrumentalists was assembled and we recorded it in an acoustically vibrant space (what is now the Bakery Building at Hauser & Wirth in Los Angeles). Composing a large instrumental work was a daunting idea for me in my mid twenties, as I had no formal training in composition and was dealing with whatever doubt which comes with that territory. But looking back now with the expanded knowledge that I have gained not only of music but also about art and life in general (and especially generative algorithmic electronic music) I wanted to wholeheartedly acknowledge that younger version of myself with a new piece commemorating this last decade of experience and creating. The timing with being able to press and release [\"+ [ 1 ( O ) p | us ]\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gavcloud/-1-o-p-us-) on Catalog feels serendipitous and in-alignment with my goals of continuing to produce independent music. This is a piece which has emerged in the form of a new, electronically processed, chaos version of its former self, in resemblance with how the disruption caused by web3 and blockchain technologies are transforming what has come before, and granting artists new levels of autonomy and control over the distribution process.\n\n## Bozo Nightmare - [\"Silver Painted Tears\"](https://beta.catalog.works/bozo-nightmare/silver-painted-tears)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3774)\n\n> **Bozo Nightmare:** We went with [\"Silver Painted Tears\"](https://beta.catalog.works/bozo-nightmare/silver-painted-tears) for our first release because we like abstraction and this song was the purest expression we had of that. We're probably most proud of the ending. It's kind of got one of those impressionistic false endings that the Beatles made popular (think \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" or \"Hello, Goodbye\") and almost hints at a lost section or remix of the song that does not exist (or does it?). The abstraction is there in the vocals, the lyrical content, the style and structure. It leaves a lot of room for what we can do next without pointing in any specific direction. We’ve just always wanted to experiment with songs, sounds and ideas, and this track seemed like the perfect starting point for whatever we want to do next.\n\n## Lafayette Stokely - [\"Listen To Your Heart\"](https://beta.catalog.works/lifeofstokely/listen-to-your-heart)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3756)\n\n> **Lafayette Stokely:** I live in my head so my music is usually me venting to myself. [\"Listen To Your Heart\"](https://beta.catalog.works/lifeofstokely/listen-to-your-heart) is just that, me reflecting on my situation and reaffirming that I’m on the right path. \"How can I look into my daughters eyes and tell them daddy never chased his dreams / Then turn right around and tell them that you can be all that you want to be\" is my favorite line because it not only represents my drive to give my daughters the world but to also teach them that anything is possible. Never second guess and never over think. Just listen to your heart, it’ll never steer you wrong.\n\n## Starkey - [\"Skies Are Open\"](https://beta.catalog.works/starkey/yung-jupit3r-skies-are-open)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3746)\n\n>**Starkey:** I've been working on this project with another Philadelphia-based artist, Idely Rey, called [Yung Jupit3r](https://twitter.com/YungJupit3r) for some time now.

What better way to honor that than by bringing that lineage to a nascent format, one that aims to be an outlet for independent creators looking to pave the way for their careers in the *new* music industry?

They had the option of dropping their debut Catalog records in tandem *or* whenever they wanted. The group overwhelmingly voted to move forward together. Enter the inaugural Catalog Community Week, just the latest [foghorn-blaring signal](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/K9i_cjk1zep0ESfu71Wj5by2zrHOIopAvZ5iSmDJYY0) that there’s a new golden era brewing in the ether. \n\nThis time around, that signal carried the transmissions of [megiapa](https://beta.catalog.works/megiapa/monday), [Mark de Clive-Lowe](https://beta.catalog.works/mdcl), [Starkey](https://beta.catalog.works/starkey/yung-jupit3r-skies-are-open), [Adder](https://beta.catalog.works/adder/extremely-na-ve), [Bozo Nightmare](https://beta.catalog.works/bozo-nightmare/silver-painted-tears), [GREGNWMN](https://beta.catalog.works/gregnwmn/solar-flare-feat-carter-ace-), [30exp](https://beta.catalog.works/30exp/vortex-feat-swanks-prod-by-30exp-), [Death Hags](https://beta.catalog.works/death-hags/looking-for-a-big-grey-sun-caustic-rework-), [Gavin Gamboa](https://beta.catalog.works/gavcloud/-1-o-p-us-), [0x-Jitzu](https://beta.catalog.works/0x-jitzu/veloop), [Christopher Stracey](https://beta.catalog.works/christopherstracey/unfolding), [trey willis](https://beta.catalog.works/treywillismusic/get-back), [Xcelencia](https://beta.catalog.works/xcelencia/problema), [Lafayette Stokely](https://beta.catalog.works/lifeofstokely/listen-to-your-heart), and [Vitalii Dominichenko](https://beta.catalog.works/vitalii-dominichenko/-eternity). In other words, lots of globetrotting, jaw-dropping, playlist-puzzling sounds, from soloist piano pieces that [reinforce links to ancestral homelands](https://beta.catalog.works/mdcl/akatombo) to fuzzy 808s underpinning ingenious punchlines ([“I’mma jump from the rooftop, land right on top of the forecast”](https://beta.catalog.works/30exp/vortex-feat-swanks-prod-by-30exp-)), all shared between June 21 and June 27, 2021. \n\nJust days before the Catalog Community Week kicked off, we were voted through Mirror's pearly gates. We decided to hold off on publishing until now, using our first post to unify the special songs that came out and spotlight the people behind them, in their own words. It features lots of context direct from the source(s), an easy means of supporting everyone involved via direct patronage, and a bit of backstory. Let’s start with how we got here then get to the good stuff (the play button).\n\nDecades ago, way back in December of 2020, we unveiled a dark mode, barebones landing page hinting at what would eventually become v0 of Catalog: a web3 world where new music formats are possible and experiments are the point, not fring. We also encouraged artists excited by the possibilities to join us in [Discord](http://catalog.community/) and sign up for email updates with launch details. Our day ones, basically.\n\nWe’ve been out in the wild for a little more than three months now, collaborating with both friends and internet strangers to test the waters while sorting out the initial working version of where we’re headed. [Modest gains have been made](https://twitter.com/TableNifty/status/1397946851043725325?s=20) in proving the value of one-of-one digital records. And more and more people are seeing the importance of songs with built-in value capture mechanisms that outlive their host platforms, ours included. There's quite a lot left to do (we’ve only built .1% of what we envision), but the most glaring omission to date, until last week's rollouts, were fewer early-bird believers releasing on Catalog than there should have been. We wanted to celebrate more of the folks who had waited patiently in the trenches.\n\nTo fix that, with decentralized onboarding and curation still on the drawing board, we invited everyone on the waitlist to confirm their interest in releasing music on Catalog and share what they were proud of. Then we simply listened, listened, listened. No glancing at Instagram followers. No ogling over Spotify monthly listeners. We just listened. It’d be an understatement to say we loved what we heard, and who we’ve met as a result. \n\nOur hope is to repeat some version of this process as a stop-gap method for highlighting the talented people who want to help shape what this project becomes. To that end, please consider supporting this post via the tip block below. All proceeds will be split amongst the artists who participated in this initial Catalog Community Week :) \n\n[Support every artist at once 💽](split://0x977e5C178f3308e831D035b1b508602348F6ddCe?network=mainnet)\n\nNow, as promised, the good stuff. Take a few minutes to listen to each record, then get to know the artists a little better by reading what they had to say about their first release. After catching a glimpse of their adventures to date, we hope you choose to become a part of their story from here.

I produced and recorded this song during 2020 as a sort of remedy to move through the endless news cycles and restless pandemic. Writing it helped me keep my things in frame, which is a constant effort—stay humble, helpful, confident, kind, mindful, resilient, and all the sweet things in between. When I'm producing and writing music, I'm often reflecting on sentiments from my life and the current moment. 'Monday' is an example of me working through it out loud... I hope you enjoy <3\n \n## Gavin Gamboa - [\"+ [ 1 ( O ) p | us ]\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gavcloud/-1-o-p-us-)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3763)\n \n> **Gavin Gamboa:** It has been 10 years since the release of what I consider the first major work I composed, a String Sextet that took to Arnold Schoenberg's \"Verklärte Nacht\" for guidance. With the help of friends/collaborators, a group of phenomenal instrumentalists was assembled and we recorded it in an acoustically vibrant space (what is now the Bakery Building at Hauser & Wirth in Los Angeles). Composing a large instrumental work was a daunting idea for me in my mid twenties, as I had no formal training in composition and was dealing with whatever doubt which comes with that territory. But looking back now with the expanded knowledge that I have gained not only of music but also about art and life in general (and especially generative algorithmic electronic music) I wanted to wholeheartedly acknowledge that younger version of myself with a new piece commemorating this last decade of experience and creating. The timing with being able to press and release [\"+ [ 1 ( O ) p | us ]\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gavcloud/-1-o-p-us-) on Catalog feels serendipitous and in-alignment with my goals of continuing to produce independent music. This is a piece which has emerged in the form of a new, electronically processed, chaos version of its former self, in resemblance with how the disruption caused by web3 and blockchain technologies are transforming what has come before, and granting artists new levels of autonomy and control over the distribution process.\n\n## Bozo Nightmare - [\"Silver Painted Tears\"](https://beta.catalog.works/bozo-nightmare/silver-painted-tears)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3774)\n\n> **Bozo Nightmare:** We went with [\"Silver Painted Tears\"](https://beta.catalog.works/bozo-nightmare/silver-painted-tears) for our first release because we like abstraction and this song was the purest expression we had of that. We're probably most proud of the ending. It's kind of got one of those impressionistic false endings that the Beatles made popular (think \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" or \"Hello, Goodbye\") and almost hints at a lost section or remix of the song that does not exist (or does it?). The abstraction is there in the vocals, the lyrical content, the style and structure. It leaves a lot of room for what we can do next without pointing in any specific direction. We’ve just always wanted to experiment with songs, sounds and ideas, and this track seemed like the perfect starting point for whatever we want to do next.\n\n## Lafayette Stokely - [\"Listen To Your Heart\"](https://beta.catalog.works/lifeofstokely/listen-to-your-heart)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3756)\n\n> **Lafayette Stokely:** I live in my head so my music is usually me venting to myself. [\"Listen To Your Heart\"](https://beta.catalog.works/lifeofstokely/listen-to-your-heart) is just that, me reflecting on my situation and reaffirming that I’m on the right path. \"How can I look into my daughters eyes and tell them daddy never chased his dreams / Then turn right around and tell them that you can be all that you want to be\" is my favorite line because it not only represents my drive to give my daughters the world but to also teach them that anything is possible. Never second guess and never over think. Just listen to your heart, it’ll never steer you wrong.\n\n## Starkey - [\"Skies Are Open\"](https://beta.catalog.works/starkey/yung-jupit3r-skies-are-open)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3746)\n\n>**Starkey:** I've been working on this project with another Philadelphia-based artist, Idely Rey, called [Yung Jupit3r](https://twitter.com/YungJupit3r) for some time now. We started working on songs around the time I was doing The Transponder Orchestra for [Alpha Pup](https://alphapup.bandcamp.com/). So it's been about 6 years plus. It's a project that I really love and pulls together lots of different styles of music that I enjoy: trip hop, modern classical and bass music with stacks of vocals and very rich orchestrations. [[\"Skies Are Open\"](https://beta.catalog.works/starkey/yung-jupit3r-skies-are-open) emerged from that process.]\n\n## 0x-Jitzu - [\"Veloop\"](https://beta.catalog.works/0x-jitzu/veloop)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3726)\n\n> **0x-Jitzu:** [\"Veloop\"](https://beta.catalog.works/0x-jitzu/veloop) is a condensed electronic track that I composed thinking about the peculiarity of the new 'media': the NFT. A tight conglomeration of sounds that represent a short and compact sound sculpture, which can be repeated inexorably as a loop. I've always been passionate about new technologies applied to art, and Catalog has given me the opportunity to experience this new language through musical NFTs. I hope to instill some peculiarities in what I produce as NFT, compared to what I usually produce for the dance floor.\n\n## Mark de Clive-Lowe - [*Motherland*](https://beta.catalog.works/mdcl/akatombo)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3732)\n\n> **Mark de Clive-Lowe:** [My first Catalog release](https://beta.catalog.works/mdcl/akatombo) is a really special project to me. *Motherland* is a suite of eight meditative, instrumental pieces exploring themes of belonging and identity as a Japanese-New Zealander reflecting on my Japanese ancestry and heritage. The pieces are part of a [40-minute immersive film](https://zora.co/mdcl/3750), set to nature footage I shot in Kaga, Japan that's also being minted as part of the *Motherland* project. I’ve been active recording, releasing and touring for over 20 years now and have been central to multiple iterations of the jazz/electronic music spectrum over that time. To be able to take all my experiences and consciously apply them to share sonic stories of my cultural and ethnic roots along with considering broader ideas of global diaspora and maintaining connection with the past while moving towards the future, is core to my creative intentions and mission. \n\n## Vitalii Dominichenko - [\"Eternity\"](https://beta.catalog.works/vitalii-dominichenko/-eternity)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3743)\n \n> **Vitalii Dominichenko:** Здитинства я відчував, що світ навколо мене значно глибший, цікавіший і тонкіший за те, що мої органи почуттів та суспільство говорять мені. Музика супроводжувала мене весь час у цьому пошуку справжньої природи мене та світу. Я шукав, блукав, думав, що знаходив і знову губив це переживання глибинної суті. Навчаючись та практикуючи трансперсональний коучинг в Alef Trust, я відчував, як мої попередні духовні пошуки почали інтегруватися в щось більш цілісне та заземлятися в моєму житті. В цьому потоці пробудження нового, ще більш справжнього Мене народився альбом «Небо на Землі» (2021) та  композиція «Вічність», яка є колоревою та джерелом всього цього альбому, тому я вирішив презентувати саме її, як мій перший запис в Catalog.\n\n> [*English:* As a child, I felt that the world around me was much deeper, more interesting, and more subtle than what my senses and society were telling me. Music accompanied me all the time in this search for the true nature of me and the world. I searched, wandered, thought I found, and again was losing this experience of deep essence. During my study for and first practice of transpersonal coaching in [Alef Trust](https://www.aleftrust.org/), I felt my previous spiritual experiences begin to integrate into something more holistic and grounded in my life. In this stream of the awakening of the new, even more, true Me, the album *Heaven on Earth* (2021) was born. [\"Eternity\"](https://beta.catalog.works/vitalii-dominichenko/-eternity) is the queen and source of it, so I decided to make this track my first record on Catalog.]\n\n## Christopher Stracey - [\"Unfolding\"](https://beta.catalog.works/christopherstracey/unfolding)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3771)\n\n> **Christopher Stracey:** I chose [\"Unfolding\"](https://beta.catalog.works/christopherstracey/unfolding) to be my first Catalog release as it represents growth and transformation. It has a central repetitive riff which gets enveloped by its surroundings and comes out as something different. I feel as though I am in a similar phase in music-making where up until now much of the music I have made has been signed to labels and geared toward a dance-floor situation. But this new music I am creating as a composer and solo artist is more explorative and conceptual.  It feels good to start a new chapter as an independent artist who is able to explore and create autonomously.\n \n## Death Hag - [\"Looking for a Big Grey Sun\"](https://beta.catalog.works/death-hags/looking-for-a-big-grey-sun-caustic-rework-)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3752)\n\n> **Death Hag:** The emerging world of web3 is full of new ideas that I'm very excited to explore with Catalog.

I produced and recorded this song during 2020 as a sort of remedy to move through the endless news cycles and restless pandemic. Writing it helped me keep my things in frame, which is a constant effort—stay humble, helpful, confident, kind, mindful, resilient, and all the sweet things in between. When I'm producing and writing music, I'm often reflecting on sentiments from my life and the current moment. 'Monday' is an example of me working through it out loud... I hope you enjoy <3\n \n## Gavin Gamboa - [\"+ [ 1 ( O ) p | us ]\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gavcloud/-1-o-p-us-)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3763)\n \n> **Gavin Gamboa:** It has been 10 years since the release of what I consider the first major work I composed, a String Sextet that took to Arnold Schoenberg's \"Verklärte Nacht\" for guidance. With the help of friends/collaborators, a group of phenomenal instrumentalists was assembled and we recorded it in an acoustically vibrant space (what is now the Bakery Building at Hauser & Wirth in Los Angeles). Composing a large instrumental work was a daunting idea for me in my mid twenties, as I had no formal training in composition and was dealing with whatever doubt which comes with that territory. But looking back now with the expanded knowledge that I have gained not only of music but also about art and life in general (and especially generative algorithmic electronic music) I wanted to wholeheartedly acknowledge that younger version of myself with a new piece commemorating this last decade of experience and creating. The timing with being able to press and release [\"+ [ 1 ( O ) p | us ]\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gavcloud/-1-o-p-us-) on Catalog feels serendipitous and in-alignment with my goals of continuing to produce independent music. This is a piece which has emerged in the form of a new, electronically processed, chaos version of its former self, in resemblance with how the disruption caused by web3 and blockchain technologies are transforming what has come before, and granting artists new levels of autonomy and control over the distribution process.\n\n## Bozo Nightmare - [\"Silver Painted Tears\"](https://beta.catalog.works/bozo-nightmare/silver-painted-tears)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3774)\n\n> **Bozo Nightmare:** We went with [\"Silver Painted Tears\"](https://beta.catalog.works/bozo-nightmare/silver-painted-tears) for our first release because we like abstraction and this song was the purest expression we had of that. We're probably most proud of the ending. It's kind of got one of those impressionistic false endings that the Beatles made popular (think \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" or \"Hello, Goodbye\") and almost hints at a lost section or remix of the song that does not exist (or does it?). The abstraction is there in the vocals, the lyrical content, the style and structure. It leaves a lot of room for what we can do next without pointing in any specific direction. We’ve just always wanted to experiment with songs, sounds and ideas, and this track seemed like the perfect starting point for whatever we want to do next.\n\n## Lafayette Stokely - [\"Listen To Your Heart\"](https://beta.catalog.works/lifeofstokely/listen-to-your-heart)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3756)\n\n> **Lafayette Stokely:** I live in my head so my music is usually me venting to myself. [\"Listen To Your Heart\"](https://beta.catalog.works/lifeofstokely/listen-to-your-heart) is just that, me reflecting on my situation and reaffirming that I’m on the right path. \"How can I look into my daughters eyes and tell them daddy never chased his dreams / Then turn right around and tell them that you can be all that you want to be\" is my favorite line because it not only represents my drive to give my daughters the world but to also teach them that anything is possible. Never second guess and never over think. Just listen to your heart, it’ll never steer you wrong.\n\n## Starkey - [\"Skies Are Open\"](https://beta.catalog.works/starkey/yung-jupit3r-skies-are-open)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3746)\n\n>**Starkey:** I've been working on this project with another Philadelphia-based artist, Idely Rey, called [Yung Jupit3r](https://twitter.com/YungJupit3r) for some time now. We started working on songs around the time I was doing The Transponder Orchestra for [Alpha Pup](https://alphapup.bandcamp.com/). So it's been about 6 years plus. It's a project that I really love and pulls together lots of different styles of music that I enjoy: trip hop, modern classical and bass music with stacks of vocals and very rich orchestrations. [[\"Skies Are Open\"](https://beta.catalog.works/starkey/yung-jupit3r-skies-are-open) emerged from that process.]\n\n## 0x-Jitzu - [\"Veloop\"](https://beta.catalog.works/0x-jitzu/veloop)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3726)\n\n> **0x-Jitzu:** [\"Veloop\"](https://beta.catalog.works/0x-jitzu/veloop) is a condensed electronic track that I composed thinking about the peculiarity of the new 'media': the NFT. A tight conglomeration of sounds that represent a short and compact sound sculpture, which can be repeated inexorably as a loop. I've always been passionate about new technologies applied to art, and Catalog has given me the opportunity to experience this new language through musical NFTs. I hope to instill some peculiarities in what I produce as NFT, compared to what I usually produce for the dance floor.\n\n## Mark de Clive-Lowe - [*Motherland*](https://beta.catalog.works/mdcl/akatombo)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3732)\n\n> **Mark de Clive-Lowe:** [My first Catalog release](https://beta.catalog.works/mdcl/akatombo) is a really special project to me. *Motherland* is a suite of eight meditative, instrumental pieces exploring themes of belonging and identity as a Japanese-New Zealander reflecting on my Japanese ancestry and heritage. The pieces are part of a [40-minute immersive film](https://zora.co/mdcl/3750), set to nature footage I shot in Kaga, Japan that's also being minted as part of the *Motherland* project. I’ve been active recording, releasing and touring for over 20 years now and have been central to multiple iterations of the jazz/electronic music spectrum over that time. To be able to take all my experiences and consciously apply them to share sonic stories of my cultural and ethnic roots along with considering broader ideas of global diaspora and maintaining connection with the past while moving towards the future, is core to my creative intentions and mission. \n\n## Vitalii Dominichenko - [\"Eternity\"](https://beta.catalog.works/vitalii-dominichenko/-eternity)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3743)\n \n> **Vitalii Dominichenko:** Здитинства я відчував, що світ навколо мене значно глибший, цікавіший і тонкіший за те, що мої органи почуттів та суспільство говорять мені. Музика супроводжувала мене весь час у цьому пошуку справжньої природи мене та світу. Я шукав, блукав, думав, що знаходив і знову губив це переживання глибинної суті. Навчаючись та практикуючи трансперсональний коучинг в Alef Trust, я відчував, як мої попередні духовні пошуки почали інтегруватися в щось більш цілісне та заземлятися в моєму житті. В цьому потоці пробудження нового, ще більш справжнього Мене народився альбом «Небо на Землі» (2021) та  композиція «Вічність», яка є колоревою та джерелом всього цього альбому, тому я вирішив презентувати саме її, як мій перший запис в Catalog.\n\n> [*English:* As a child, I felt that the world around me was much deeper, more interesting, and more subtle than what my senses and society were telling me. Music accompanied me all the time in this search for the true nature of me and the world. I searched, wandered, thought I found, and again was losing this experience of deep essence. During my study for and first practice of transpersonal coaching in [Alef Trust](https://www.aleftrust.org/), I felt my previous spiritual experiences begin to integrate into something more holistic and grounded in my life. In this stream of the awakening of the new, even more, true Me, the album *Heaven on Earth* (2021) was born. [\"Eternity\"](https://beta.catalog.works/vitalii-dominichenko/-eternity) is the queen and source of it, so I decided to make this track my first record on Catalog.]\n\n## Christopher Stracey - [\"Unfolding\"](https://beta.catalog.works/christopherstracey/unfolding)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3771)\n\n> **Christopher Stracey:** I chose [\"Unfolding\"](https://beta.catalog.works/christopherstracey/unfolding) to be my first Catalog release as it represents growth and transformation. It has a central repetitive riff which gets enveloped by its surroundings and comes out as something different. I feel as though I am in a similar phase in music-making where up until now much of the music I have made has been signed to labels and geared toward a dance-floor situation. But this new music I am creating as a composer and solo artist is more explorative and conceptual.  It feels good to start a new chapter as an independent artist who is able to explore and create autonomously.\n \n## Death Hags - [\"Looking for a Big Grey Sun\"](https://beta.catalog.works/death-hags/looking-for-a-big-grey-sun-caustic-rework-)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3752)\n\n> **Death Hags:** The emerging world of web3 is full of new ideas that I'm very excited to explore with Catalog. This first release is a rework of my track [\"Looking for a Big Grey Sun,\"](https://beta.catalog.works/death-hags/looking-for-a-big-grey-sun-caustic-rework-) inspired by Aphex Twin's cheeky approach to remixing (he doesn't listen to the song, just sends one of his own tracks). AFX is an artist I look up to and I find his iconoclast spirit reflected in the blockchain metaverse. This track is what I imagine he would do with my song. All proceeds from the sale will be donated to the [David Suzuki Foundation](https://davidsuzuki.org/) for their efforts to preserve the old growth forest in British Columbia. The winner of the bid will get a unique endless loop tape and the option to send me an ambient track made with that loop for a future Catalog release. \n \n## trey willis - [\"Get Back\"](https://beta.catalog.works/treywillismusic/get-back)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3722)\n \n> **trey willis:** Excited to release my very first single as a solo artist, as well as my very first NFT! This track is special to me and tells the journey and inner struggle of making the same mistakes over and over again, living in darkness, but reaching up for help and finding my way back to the light. [\"Get Back\"](https://beta.catalog.works/treywillismusic/get-back) was birthed from a Louis Futon producer challenge on Splice. Producers were to create an original track using one or more samples from the Louis Futon “pretty cool sounds Vol. 2” sample pack. I am generally a lot more inspired creating my own sounds and samples, but wanted to challenge myself to see what I could create using someone else’s samples. I ended up using 28 samples from the pack, and tried to tweak each one to make it my own. I also used some of my own samples, an Omnisphere patch, wavetable patch, and a Moog Sirin for the bass and leads. I tracked everything in Ableton. I hope you enjoy!\n \n## 30exp - [\"VORTEX\"](https://beta.catalog.works/30exp/vortex-feat-swanks-prod-by-30exp-)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3733)\n\n> **30exp:** Sound is, for me, an escape from the rules of visual design. Design tends to lead with communication over art so I guess it's freeing to not have to spell out an idea. The beat itself [of [\"VORTEX\"](https://beta.catalog.works/30exp/vortex-feat-swanks-prod-by-30exp-)] was a turning point in the way I understand my own process of creation. As for the song, the way it came together from the beat to the demo to the final mix and art direction was a collaborative effort, that is I'd say the best part.\n \n## Adder (f/k/a/ Wild Kid) - [\"Extremely Naïve\"](https://beta.catalog.works/adder/extremely-na-ve)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3739)\n \n> **Adder:** [\"Extremely Naïve\"](https://beta.catalog.works/adder/extremely-na-ve) is the first in a new project under a new name, Adder. Until now I've released music as Wild Kid, but I felt that that project had run its course. The biggest change is that whereas Wild Kid was an instrumental project, Adder features my own vocals. With Wild Kid, the challenge motivating the project was to create a sense of narrative and personal vulnerability—which I thought could sometimes be missing from electronic music—without the use of lyrics and vocals. I had been singing in choirs and groups since I was 13, but I just wasn't interested in writing songs, so that never made it into my own music. For years, that challenge really interested me, but recently the motivation began to fade. I started to feel like it was time to incorporate this new element into my process and take on a set of challenges I had sort of been subconsciously avoiding: how to record and process my own vocals, how to use my voice as a sonic tool, and how to write lyrics. It's a whole new writing approach, and making space for my voice in arrangements is reforming my production style. Learning to produce my vocals is kind of like learning to make music all over again. This release is very distinctly the first page in a new chapter for me.\n \n## GREGNWMN - [\"SOLAR FLARE\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gregnwmn/solar-flare-feat-carter-ace-)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3737)\n \n> **GREGNWMN:** [\"SOLAR FLARE\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gregnwmn/solar-flare-feat-carter-ace-) carries a heavy tone of introspection, transparency, urgency for me. This record stood out as the perfect fit to begin my journey with Catalog based on the progressive energy surrounding not only the platform, but the arrangement of the narrative comprised on the record itself. After finding myself driving home from working two 8-hour shifts back to back, all my mind was focused on was the new verse I wrote the day before. There was a crazy glare coming from the freeway that made the whole road look like it was made of gold. In that moment, the early remnants of \"SOLAR FLARE\" began, building off of the idea that regardless of the drive we may have, our goals & desires may blind us in the process. As the artists/creatives of tomorrow, we are always pushing the boundaries of what we consider to be valuable. Some of those experiences manifested themselves into the verses performed on \"SOLAR FLARE,\" which mirrored not only some of mine & Carter’s journey, but hopefully the journey of the listener as well.\n\n## Xcelencia - [\"Problema\"](https://beta.catalog.works/xcelencia/problema)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3766)\n\n> **Xcelencia:** My first Catalog press, [\"Problema,\"](https://beta.catalog.works/xcelencia/problema) is curated from a volume of work I developed during quarantine.

All proceeds will be split amongst the artists who participated in this initial Catalog Community Week :) \n\n[Support every artist at once 💽](split://0x977e5C178f3308e831D035b1b508602348F6ddCe?network=mainnet)\n\nNow, as promised, the good stuff. Take a few minutes to listen to each record, then get to know the artists a little better by reading what they had to say about their first release. After catching a glimpse of their adventures to date, we hope you choose to become a part of their story from here.

I produced and recorded this song during 2020 as a sort of remedy to move through the endless news cycles and restless pandemic. Writing it helped me keep my things in frame, which is a constant effort—stay humble, helpful, confident, kind, mindful, resilient, and all the sweet things in between. When I'm producing and writing music, I'm often reflecting on sentiments from my life and the current moment. 'Monday' is an example of me working through it out loud... I hope you enjoy <3\n \n## Gavin Gamboa - [\"+ [ 1 ( O ) p | us ]\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gavcloud/-1-o-p-us-)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3763)\n \n> **Gavin Gamboa:** It has been 10 years since the release of what I consider the first major work I composed, a String Sextet that took to Arnold Schoenberg's \"Verklärte Nacht\" for guidance. With the help of friends/collaborators, a group of phenomenal instrumentalists was assembled and we recorded it in an acoustically vibrant space (what is now the Bakery Building at Hauser & Wirth in Los Angeles). Composing a large instrumental work was a daunting idea for me in my mid twenties, as I had no formal training in composition and was dealing with whatever doubt which comes with that territory. But looking back now with the expanded knowledge that I have gained not only of music but also about art and life in general (and especially generative algorithmic electronic music) I wanted to wholeheartedly acknowledge that younger version of myself with a new piece commemorating this last decade of experience and creating. The timing with being able to press and release [\"+ [ 1 ( O ) p | us ]\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gavcloud/-1-o-p-us-) on Catalog feels serendipitous and in-alignment with my goals of continuing to produce independent music. This is a piece which has emerged in the form of a new, electronically processed, chaos version of its former self, in resemblance with how the disruption caused by web3 and blockchain technologies are transforming what has come before, and granting artists new levels of autonomy and control over the distribution process.\n\n## Bozo Nightmare - [\"Silver Painted Tears\"](https://beta.catalog.works/bozo-nightmare/silver-painted-tears)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3774)\n\n> **Bozo Nightmare:** We went with [\"Silver Painted Tears\"](https://beta.catalog.works/bozo-nightmare/silver-painted-tears) for our first release because we like abstraction and this song was the purest expression we had of that. We're probably most proud of the ending. It's kind of got one of those impressionistic false endings that the Beatles made popular (think \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" or \"Hello, Goodbye\") and almost hints at a lost section or remix of the song that does not exist (or does it?). The abstraction is there in the vocals, the lyrical content, the style and structure. It leaves a lot of room for what we can do next without pointing in any specific direction. We’ve just always wanted to experiment with songs, sounds and ideas, and this track seemed like the perfect starting point for whatever we want to do next.\n\n## Lafayette Stokely - [\"Listen To Your Heart\"](https://beta.catalog.works/lifeofstokely/listen-to-your-heart)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3756)\n\n> **Lafayette Stokely:** I live in my head so my music is usually me venting to myself. [\"Listen To Your Heart\"](https://beta.catalog.works/lifeofstokely/listen-to-your-heart) is just that, me reflecting on my situation and reaffirming that I’m on the right path. \"How can I look into my daughters eyes and tell them daddy never chased his dreams / Then turn right around and tell them that you can be all that you want to be\" is my favorite line because it not only represents my drive to give my daughters the world but to also teach them that anything is possible. Never second guess and never over think. Just listen to your heart, it’ll never steer you wrong.\n\n## Starkey - [\"Skies Are Open\"](https://beta.catalog.works/starkey/yung-jupit3r-skies-are-open)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3746)\n\n>**Starkey:** I've been working on this project with another Philadelphia-based artist, Idely Rey, called [Yung Jupit3r](https://twitter.com/YungJupit3r) for some time now. We started working on songs around the time I was doing The Transponder Orchestra for [Alpha Pup](https://alphapup.bandcamp.com/). So it's been about 6 years plus. It's a project that I really love and pulls together lots of different styles of music that I enjoy: trip hop, modern classical and bass music with stacks of vocals and very rich orchestrations. [[\"Skies Are Open\"](https://beta.catalog.works/starkey/yung-jupit3r-skies-are-open) emerged from that process.]\n\n## 0x-Jitzu - [\"Veloop\"](https://beta.catalog.works/0x-jitzu/veloop)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3726)\n\n> **0x-Jitzu:** [\"Veloop\"](https://beta.catalog.works/0x-jitzu/veloop) is a condensed electronic track that I composed thinking about the peculiarity of the new 'media': the NFT. A tight conglomeration of sounds that represent a short and compact sound sculpture, which can be repeated inexorably as a loop. I've always been passionate about new technologies applied to art, and Catalog has given me the opportunity to experience this new language through musical NFTs. I hope to instill some peculiarities in what I produce as NFT, compared to what I usually produce for the dance floor.\n\n## Mark de Clive-Lowe - [*Motherland*](https://beta.catalog.works/mdcl/akatombo)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3732)\n\n> **Mark de Clive-Lowe:** [My first Catalog release](https://beta.catalog.works/mdcl/akatombo) is a really special project to me. *Motherland* is a suite of eight meditative, instrumental pieces exploring themes of belonging and identity as a Japanese-New Zealander reflecting on my Japanese ancestry and heritage. The pieces are part of a [40-minute immersive film](https://zora.co/mdcl/3750), set to nature footage I shot in Kaga, Japan that's also being minted as part of the *Motherland* project. I’ve been active recording, releasing and touring for over 20 years now and have been central to multiple iterations of the jazz/electronic music spectrum over that time. To be able to take all my experiences and consciously apply them to share sonic stories of my cultural and ethnic roots along with considering broader ideas of global diaspora and maintaining connection with the past while moving towards the future, is core to my creative intentions and mission. \n\n## Vitalii Dominichenko - [\"Eternity\"](https://beta.catalog.works/vitalii-dominichenko/-eternity)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3743)\n \n> **Vitalii Dominichenko:** Здитинства я відчував, що світ навколо мене значно глибший, цікавіший і тонкіший за те, що мої органи почуттів та суспільство говорять мені. Музика супроводжувала мене весь час у цьому пошуку справжньої природи мене та світу. Я шукав, блукав, думав, що знаходив і знову губив це переживання глибинної суті. Навчаючись та практикуючи трансперсональний коучинг в Alef Trust, я відчував, як мої попередні духовні пошуки почали інтегруватися в щось більш цілісне та заземлятися в моєму житті. В цьому потоці пробудження нового, ще більш справжнього Мене народився альбом «Небо на Землі» (2021) та  композиція «Вічність», яка є колоревою та джерелом всього цього альбому, тому я вирішив презентувати саме її, як мій перший запис в Catalog.\n\n> [*English:* As a child, I felt that the world around me was much deeper, more interesting, and more subtle than what my senses and society were telling me. Music accompanied me all the time in this search for the true nature of me and the world. I searched, wandered, thought I found, and again was losing this experience of deep essence. During my study for and first practice of transpersonal coaching in [Alef Trust](https://www.aleftrust.org/), I felt my previous spiritual experiences begin to integrate into something more holistic and grounded in my life. In this stream of the awakening of the new, even more, true Me, the album *Heaven on Earth* (2021) was born. [\"Eternity\"](https://beta.catalog.works/vitalii-dominichenko/-eternity) is the queen and source of it, so I decided to make this track my first record on Catalog.]\n\n## Christopher Stracey - [\"Unfolding\"](https://beta.catalog.works/christopherstracey/unfolding)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3771)\n\n> **Christopher Stracey:** I chose [\"Unfolding\"](https://beta.catalog.works/christopherstracey/unfolding) to be my first Catalog release as it represents growth and transformation. It has a central repetitive riff which gets enveloped by its surroundings and comes out as something different. I feel as though I am in a similar phase in music-making where up until now much of the music I have made has been signed to labels and geared toward a dance-floor situation. But this new music I am creating as a composer and solo artist is more explorative and conceptual.  It feels good to start a new chapter as an independent artist who is able to explore and create autonomously.\n \n## Death Hag - [\"Looking for a Big Grey Sun,\"](https://beta.catalog.works/death-hags/looking-for-a-big-grey-sun-caustic-rework-)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3752)\n\n> **Death Hag:** The emerging world of web3 is full of new ideas that I'm very excited to explore with Catalog. This first release is a rework of my track [\"Looking for a Big Grey Sun,\"](https://beta.catalog.works/death-hags/looking-for-a-big-grey-sun-caustic-rework-) inspired by Aphex Twin's cheeky approach to remixing (he doesn't listen to the song, just sends one of his own tracks). AFX is an artist I look up to and I find his iconoclast spirit reflected in the blockchain metaverse. This track is what I imagine he would do with my song. All proceeds from the sale will be donated to the [David Suzuki Foundation](https://davidsuzuki.org/) for their efforts to preserve the old growth forest in British Columbia. The winner of the bid will get a unique endless loop tape and the option to send me an ambient track made with that loop for a future Catalog release. \n \n## trey willis - [\"Get Back\"](https://beta.catalog.works/treywillismusic/get-back)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3722)\n \n> **trey willis:** Excited to release my very first single as a solo artist, as well as my very first NFT! This track is special to me and tells the journey and inner struggle of making the same mistakes over and over again, living in darkness, but reaching up for help and finding my way back to the light. [\"Get Back\"](https://beta.catalog.works/treywillismusic/get-back) was birthed from a Louis Futon producer challenge on Splice. Producers were to create an original track using one or more samples from the Louis Futon “pretty cool sounds Vol. 2” sample pack. I am generally a lot more inspired creating my own sounds and samples, but wanted to challenge myself to see what I could create using someone else’s samples. I ended up using 28 samples from the pack, and tried to tweak each one to make it my own. I also used some of my own samples, an Omnisphere patch, wavetable patch, and a Moog Sirin for the bass and leads. I tracked everything in Ableton. I hope you enjoy!\n \n## 30exp - [\"VORTEX\"](https://beta.catalog.works/30exp/vortex-feat-swanks-prod-by-30exp-)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3733)\n\n> **30exp:** Sound is, for me, an escape from the rules of visual design. Design tends to lead with communication over art so I guess it's freeing to not have to spell out an idea. The beat itself [of [\"VORTEX\"](https://beta.catalog.works/30exp/vortex-feat-swanks-prod-by-30exp-)] was a turning point in the way I understand my own process of creation. As for the song, the way it came together from the beat to the demo to the final mix and art direction was a collaborative effort, that is I'd say the best part.\n \n## Adder (f/k/a/ Wild Kid) - [\"Extremely Naïve\"](https://beta.catalog.works/adder/extremely-na-ve)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3739)\n \n> **Adder:** [\"Extremely Naïve\"](https://beta.catalog.works/adder/extremely-na-ve) is the first in a new project under a new name, Adder. Until now I've released music as Wild Kid, but I felt that that project had run its course. The biggest change is that whereas Wild Kid was an instrumental project, Adder features my own vocals. With Wild Kid, the challenge motivating the project was to create a sense of narrative and personal vulnerability—which I thought could sometimes be missing from electronic music—without the use of lyrics and vocals. I had been singing in choirs and groups since I was 13, but I just wasn't interested in writing songs, so that never made it into my own music. For years, that challenge really interested me, but recently the motivation began to fade. I started to feel like it was time to incorporate this new element into my process and take on a set of challenges I had sort of been subconsciously avoiding: how to record and process my own vocals, how to use my voice as a sonic tool, and how to write lyrics. It's a whole new writing approach, and making space for my voice in arrangements is reforming my production style. Learning to produce my vocals is kind of like learning to make music all over again. This release is very distinctly the first page in a new chapter for me.\n \n## GREGNWMN - [\"SOLAR FLARE\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gregnwmn/solar-flare-feat-carter-ace-)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3737)\n \n> **GREGNWMN:** [\"SOLAR FLARE\"](https://beta.catalog.works/gregnwmn/solar-flare-feat-carter-ace-) carries a heavy tone of introspection, transparency, urgency for me. This record stood out as the perfect fit to begin my journey with Catalog based on the progressive energy surrounding not only the platform, but the arrangement of the narrative comprised on the record itself. After finding myself driving home from working two 8-hour shifts back to back, all my mind was focused on was the new verse I wrote the day before. There was a crazy glare coming from the freeway that made the whole road look like it was made of gold. In that moment, the early remnants of \"SOLAR FLARE\" began, building off of the idea that regardless of the drive we may have, our goals & desires may blind us in the process. As the artists/creatives of tomorrow, we are always pushing the boundaries of what we consider to be valuable. Some of those experiences manifested themselves into the verses performed on \"SOLAR FLARE,\" which mirrored not only some of mine & Carter’s journey, but hopefully the journey of the listener as well.\n\n## Xcelencia - [\"Problema\"](https://beta.catalog.works/xcelencia/problema)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3766)\n\n> **Xcelencia:** My first Catalog press, [\"Problema,\"](https://beta.catalog.works/xcelencia/problema) is curated from a volume of work I developed during quarantine. There was a pressure to try new things, sounds, and even explore distinct genres during the quarantine but sometimes it's important to stay true to your roots and this release reminds me of when I first started creating music over eight years ago. This specific single was selected to kick off the summer and experiment with as my first audio NFT. Latin music and in particular Reggaeton is experiencing a renaissance in the music industry. What better way to honor that than by bringing that lineage to a nascent format, one that aims to be an outlet for independent creators looking to pave the way for their careers in the *new* music industry? Everything from getting my first headline show at SXSW to my first 30 million streams on Spotify has led me to this moment. If you’re new to the genre I hope this release sparks your interest to dive in and enjoy what we have to offer to the world.", "timestamp": 1624984868, "digest": "JAs8NedvnAC3DIdTjkwIolUmH4sHKCjsDtVDhrP7TP8", "contributor": "0xFA8bA20F71d959DD3a51CE15d89fAc03c24Cf392"}

Pre-pandemic this included live music, some vinyls on the side, not to mention subscriptions to the streaming platforms. During the pandemic it’s been Bandcamp Fridays, NFTs, and monthly donations through Patreon to support the venues and communities that are the soul of New York City  — that comprise my own soul. Music was a comfort in an otherwise difficult year; it’s a cruel irony that artists have captured so little of the value they create. \n\nWhen we clear the woods, I have no doubt that some venues will be back, some won’t be so lucky. People will always make music, as we have since before there’s been language. Yet it is not hard to meet an artist today who has a bleak view on the future of music streaming technology. Streaming platforms irrevocably changed the way music gets discovered, shared, and importantly for the artists themselves, how they’re compensated. As Mat Dryhurst [said](https://twitter.com/matdryhurst/status/1345817834614616065), Bandcamp feels more like a bandaid. \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f98cdad9-bd35-4875-a742-6c6d09d59480.jpeg?height=3024&width=4032)\n\n\n\n### Ownership for the Internet \nSo where do we go from here? It begins with how you own things on the internet. Technology made it possible to compress the infinite miracle of sound waves into bytes. These bytes are reproducible and borderless, flowing alongside the information we consume in our hands. The crypto movement is [challenging this notion](https://consensys.net/blog/codefi/how-nft-art-marketplaces-are-merging-with-defi/) — that something as ephemeral or as easily portable as a file can also be owned, and that this ownership is valuable. \n\nTake the electronic musician Jacques Greene, for example. “Another Girl,” his track from 2011 has 7 million plays on Spotify, netting him about [$27,904 in royalties](https://tunemunk.com/spotify-royalty-calculator/) from the platform. Last week, he sold a mesmerizing audio loop and GIF of a stippled figure called “[Promise](https://foundation.app/jacquesgreene/promise-640)” for 13ETH ($16,037.32 USD). Let that settle for a moment. A six second AV loop bid upon for 24 hours brought in almost half the royalties of a song that people around the world may have played as they walk to work, cook dinner, party with friends, on a first date — over the course of a decade.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/640)\n\nIf you can bear the crypto jargon for a moment, the concept that led us here is important to explain briefly. Four Ethereum developers in 2018 authored the ERC-721 token standard, more commonly called Non-fungible Tokens, or NFTs. NFTs are [provably scarce digital items](https://consensys.net/blog/codefi/how-nft-art-marketplaces-are-merging-with-defi/), whether that be digital collectibles, tickets to an event, in-game items, or the digital art from Beeple that is now selling $6.6 million. \n\nSo why not apply this to music? After all, the ownership data on Ethereum is what’s important. Couldn’t a song’s metadata (which could be the audio file itself, the rights, or even midi stems) also be cryptographically transformed into its constituent parts, and royalties paid out to the owner of this metadata? In 2016, artists like Imogen Heap attempted this on pioneering platforms like Ujo Music, despite the [limited capabilities](https://medium.com/hatching-amazing/part-1-how-my-ssn-prevented-me-from-buying-music-on-the-blockchain-and-why-blockchain-for-music-a85eaeaca7ad) of Ethereum smart contracts in those early stages, not to mention the [added friction](https://medium.com/hatching-amazing/part-1-how-my-ssn-prevented-me-from-buying-music-on-the-blockchain-and-why-blockchain-for-music-a85eaeaca7ad) for actually using Ethereum. Also missing was an efficient way to pay out royalties for sales on secondary markets. \n\nSmart contract standards remain the locus for innovation on Ethereum, and continues to bring in more and more individuals attempting to program value and contracts in new ways on the internet. The ERC-721 standard that led to the booming market of NFTs is now being revised to allow for a more dynamic standard for paying out royalties, no matter the platform that mints the NFT.\n\n### What does Euler’s Phi Function Have to Do with Music? \nThree months ago, Treum, a [ConsenSys Mesh](https://mesh.xyz/) portfolio company, created a project called [EulerBeats](https://eulerbeats.com/), which is 27 algorithmically generated art and music NFTs. The name is a nod to the 18th century mathematician’s totient function [phi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function#Applications), and if theoretical mathematics isn’t your thing, think of it as a function for pricing every subsequent print. As the number of prints in circulation grows for a particular original, the price of issuing its next print increases at an exponential rate. These NFTs use a modification of the ERC-721, called the [ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155). This means that with every future sale, the original LP holder gets a royalty of 8%, with another 2% going to [Treum](https://www.treum.io/). In two weeks, the smart contracts governing the unique LPs paid out 912 ETH ($1,429,012) in royalties, automatically. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/61d40af3-e4d9-4ebf-a81d-5e88fb26a727.png?height=996&width=1600)\n\nUnlike other NFTs where the metadata is hosted on a centralized web server, the metadata of the music and image is contained within the token implementation itself. This is [important](https://medium.com/treum_io/on-chain-artwork-nfts-f0556653c9f3): if the EulerBeats website were to ever shut down, you would still be able run the art and beat generator script, stored on the Ethereum chain in perpetuity. \n\nThe Ethereum community ended up speculating on the value of this proposition to the price of [300 ETH](https://eulerbeats.com/stats) for the first LP, with Mark Cuban [calling it](https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ/status/1364255520857731072) “the most genius idea ever.” There are many aspects of this project worthy of lengthy discussion, but for the purpose of this article, the implications of storing a verifiably unique piece of audio on Ethereum, where future sales are automatically paid out to the original owner, is the point that matters for new models for selling music.\n\n### Don’t other NFTs pay out royalties?\nNot necessarily. Right now, most NFTs are minted as ERC-721 tokens, which means that when an artist initially sells their work to a buyer, that will be the only time they receive money for the sale. If the buyer then flips it on a secondary market like OpenSea for 5 times the price, the original artist sees none of that. \n\n[Zora](https://zora.co/) is an NFT protocol for creators of all types attempting to change this. Each artist that mints NFTs on the platform can set a “creator share” which is a percentage that they will receive for all future sales. Let’s say their creator share is 10%. If the original is sold for 0.5 ETH, and then someone later sells that for 10 ETH, the creator would receive an additional 1 ETH for the secondary sale. Also, because these creator shares are automatically paid out with smart contracts, and auditable on Ethereum, the creator never has to worry about tracking them down: they just get paid in perpetuity to their original Ethereum address that they minted the NFT with. This is a powerful concept akin to royalties in the music world, but automatic and auditable.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3750)\n\n### An improved standard for NFT royalties\nThere is one problem, though. Currently the method that Zora uses for paying creator shares is not reproducible on secondary markets. The creator share percentage is only paid out if the secondary sale also occurs on Zora. \n\n[Zach Burks](https://github.com/vexycats) and [James Morgan](https://github.com/jamesmorgan) authored an “Ethereum Improvement Proposal” or [EIP-2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) to create an ERC-721 Royalty Standard. The main motivation of this is to create a modified NFT standard so that NFTs created, purchased, or sold on one marketplace still pay out royalties regardless of the next marketplace it is sold on. With this standard, it would be possible for the artist to set a royalty amount that can be paid to the creator on any marketplace that implements these tokens.\n\nBack to our earlier example, if an artist were to mint an NFT on Zora, they would still be entitled to their creator share if the purchaser sold it on another marketplace. I expect that more marketplaces will begin adopting this standard, which is already backwards compatible with the dominant ERC-721 NFT standard. We could also see more record label [Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)](https://consensys.net/blog/codefi/daos/) that manage minting, and distribution of Audio NFTs through the existing streaming services, such as [DAOrecords](about:blank).\n\n### Cool, but how does this all work with traditional Performing Rights Organizations? \n\nIn the year 2021, enterprising artists have already begun tokenizing audio files and selling them to fans as NFTs. We are also getting closer to a more universal royalties standard for these NFTs. But how does this interact with the traditional and opaque world of performing rights organizations (PROs) and centralized royalties databases?\n\nThe short answer is that what’s happening on Ethereum still exists within its own ecosystem. Yet, this slowly appears to be changing — both as PROs modernize their rights management databases, and as more record labels begin learning about the power of NFTs for creating value for artists (I may be optimistic here).\n\n[ConsenSys was selected last year by the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC)](https://www.themlc.com/faqs/how-are-hfa-and-consensys-involved-work-mlc), with the Harry Fox Agency, to modernize music royalties data and payments over the next several years. The MLC portal, largely built by ConsenSys, launched in January and is still evolving. There are already roughly 48 million songs, and 9,400 music publishers on it, and they just inherited $424 million in unpaid royalties (“the so-called Black Box”). We believe that as more music publishers and PROs begin to get comfortable with the benefits of Ethereum-based NFTs, we will start to see a convergence of these worlds over the next year.\n\nUntil then, if you’re an artist, and you think the current royalty system is broken, it doesn’t hurt to download [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), and begin exploring what other musicians are doing in the NFT space.\n\n", "timestamp": 1625001939, "digest": "YDTzksKcxgWcgvCkNDY96vSvGk7XQFYXCFCJAgCTjq4", "contributor": "0x9BA0022Ec84E92dceaC90d0a22E3A857ba37bfE6"}

The central idea is to create a \"game\" that can serve as a space for DAO governance experimentation. The goal of this essay is to share the idea, stress test it, and frame the key questions that would need to be answered to execute on it.* \n\n## **Introduction:**\n\nThe success of DAOs as an organizational structure is necessary for crypto to reach its potential. What would be the purpose of spending so much energy on decentralized technology if the actual decisions about the technology were made by a centralized entity?\n\nAt face value, this can make DAOs feel inevitable.\n\nBut when crypto goes mainstream, most people are going to use the products that are the best (e.g., cheapest, fastest, safest, most convenient). Unfortunately, I struggle to believe that the degree of decentralization of a team is going to be a key purchase criteria for the mainstream user. \n\nWhich means for DAOs to succeed, they will need to enable better outcomes than traditional organizations. Even though traditional organizations are not necessarily paragons of efficiency, this is a difficult hurdle to overcome.  \n\nBetter outcomes for an organization can be driven by many different factors (e.g., technology, talent, narrative), but principally among these factors is the manner in which an organization is managed - it's governance. \n\n## **The governance issue:**\n\nCurrent DAO governance systems are improving and governance software is becoming more flexible (e.g., [Orca](https://www.orcaprotocol.org/)), but it will be difficult for DAOs to make breakthroughs with \"governance\" mechanics on such short time frames.\n\nGovernance has no right or wrong, and no hard facts, and it is difficult to project how governance systems will play out in our minds. We will need to rely on observations of real world events to improve our models for decentralized governance, but feedback loops are long, and the amount of data we will be able to collect is limited. \n\nFurther, experimentation in the field is going to be limited. DAOs are managing billions of dollars and important technological infrastructure - the consequences of governance mistakes are high. It is smart for DAOs to optimize for risk minimization with whichever governance system they choose, leading to low rates of experimentation. \n\nAll of this is to say that it will be difficult for DAOs to meaningfully improve governance systems on the timeline necessary for DAOs to out-compete traditional organizations. We could benefit from a lower stakes, faster, and higher fidelity way for DAOs to experiment with governance. \n\n## **A possible solution:**\n\nWhat we essentially need is DAO governance simulations. A place where we could experiment with the resilience and effectiveness of different governance mechanisms, with limited downside, and tight and fast feedback loops.\n\n[https://twitter.com/_Dave__White_/status/1405694036501954567?s=20](https://twitter.com/_Dave__White_/status/1405694036501954567?s=20)\n\nThis feels similar, metaphorically, to how AIs are trained to learn how to play games - controlled environments where AI's can \"practice\" and evolve through a bunch (millions) of iterations, ultimately improving their understanding and skill. What would the human version of this look like for DAO governance?\n\nI am imagining we could create a team \"game\" whose participant teams would be DAOs. The game would reward the winning team, creating meaningful skin-in-the-game and incentivizing real effort. \n\nTo effectively organize and play the teams, operating as DAOs would have to implement some sort of governance system, allowing us to observe the success and failures of different mechanisms in meaningful, but safe, situations.\n\nWhat is exciting about this idea is it is simultaneously useful and fun. If DAOs are the next nation-states, then this could become the World Cup. At the same time, it would function as a cutting edge research organization providing meaningful value to DAOs.\n\nHowever, there are open questions regarding how to successfully implement such an idea. The rest of this post will frame a few key questions that need to be further researched and answered if this idea is to be implemented. \n\n**What game should be used as a conduit for the experiment?**\n\nThis feels like the single biggest question, but also the one I am most unsure of.\n\nThe original tweet (above) that inspired this thought experiment suggested using chess as the game of choice. This is advantageous in that it would be technically simple (in fact, it was [already built](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1407252425292107776?s=20)), highly accessible, and would have tight feedback loops. I am concerned, however, with the applicability of learnings from a finite game to our infinite world.\n\nA more complicated game might more accurately portray our real world - complex environments, uncertain outcomes, and imperfect information. Designing and building a custom game could help meet exact needs, but would require large up-front costs and a significant time investment. \n\nThe alternative is to utilize an already existing game. A few ideas that come to mind are having DAOs compete to manage ZED Run horses and measuring their relative performance, or creating games of DAO Diplomacy.\n\nThere is also no reason that any one single game has to be chosen permanently. Perhaps it might even be useful to rotate games to prevent DAOs from optimizing for a single environment. \n\n**How should we manage the game?**\n\nMy immediate reaction was to manage the game and the experiment with a DAO. Teams that participate in the competition could be a part of the larger DAO, and would have a stake in the management of the overall competition. This way, the organization can serve the people that fund it and participate in it, and no central entity would make decisions.\n\nOne downside is that using a DAO to manage the games leads to a \"recursive experiment\". We would be using the unsolved problem that we are trying to experiment on, which almost feels like dogfooding an unfinished product to finish building the product. \n\nIt is worth considering the pros and cons of a decentralized vs centralized approach. Ultimately, the vision should be to manage using a DAO, but perhaps an approach of [progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/) would be useful.\n\n**How could the DAO be funded?**\n\nFunding is required to cover the operational costs of the organization and to create meaningful financial rewards for competitors. There are a number of options that can be explored for funding, including:\n\n- Grants programs: This DAO could qualify for many grants programs as a \"public good\" that benefits the ecosystem as a whole. Grants could provide a nice foundation for the DAO to get kick-started, and if value is proven to the ecosystem, could continue as a strong source of funds. Intuitively, this feels like something people may be interested in funding through Gitcoin grants.\n- Entrance fees: I could see the participant DAO team each representing a protocol that would want to treat the competition as a \"test-net\" of sorts for their governance proposals. DAOs would have to pay to enter a team in the competition. Imagine Yearn using the game to test [Governance 2.0](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460) in a situation with no downside, before going live within the real organization. There is a world in which the entrance fees could be locked for a certain period of time and function as a no-loss prize tournament (see PoolTogether), where winners are paid out by the interest payments from the entrance fees.\n\n## **Conclusion** \n\nThis game could help us iterate and evolve DAO governance mechanisms quicker and more safely than we ever could in real-world environments. Simultaneously, it could create a fun space for DAOs to compete, further build community sentiment, and reward participants monetarily. \n\nI will be continuing to think through this thought experiment, so if you are interested in jamming on this idea and helping answer key questions, please reach out on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/benschecter).\n\n\n*Thank you to [Dave](https://twitter.com/_Dave__White_), [Commodore](https://twitter.com/thycommodore), and [Anish](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri) for reading this and providing feedback!*", "timestamp": 1625013053, "digest": "DW_TioUKbwV9n7cjfRgZiu1y9_XB76-NF5WXHTWYtoM", "contributor": "0xaAba999423e939a67373E422dFabE088d5bc31A5"}

This was exactly the mentality I was referring to in my piece *[Thinking small: a meditation on scale vs success for artists](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/04/13/thinking-small-a-meditation-on-scale-vs-success-for-artists/)* which encouraged musicians to consider options beyond the rat race of streaming, charts, playlist pitching, and constant touring.\n\nNow, the second season of Songcamp has kicked off and I’m glad to be able to help out the music teams in a strategic capacity.

You’ve bought some cryptocurrency, transferred it to your wallet, acquired some tokens, maybe bought an NFT, registered your name on **[ENS](https://ens.domains/)** (also an NFT, by the way), and joined a DAO where you vote on community proposals. From here on out you’re fairly familiar with some of the topics, they become easier to research, and every next step is less daunting than the previous one. It makes it easy to forget about the steep barriers to entry.\n\n**There are two barriers to entering the space: one is tech literacy and the other is economical.** As I was onboarding a friend the other day, so they could register their ENS domain, I was actually shocked how much work getting set up was. I spread that out over months, but doing it all in one go was a lot.\n\nWe went through:\n\n*   The **Metamask** sign up process, which is unconventional for many web users, since it requires people to securely store a phrase they need in order to access their wallet. That comes on top of a password. This practice is more common in banking than in most web services – very logical once you’re onboarded, but perhaps less so if you’re ‘just signing up for a thing’.\n*   An issue adding funds to the wallet, since Metamask’s partner that allows you to buy ETH (**Wyre**) seemed incompatible with their bank. Maybe it was another issue, but in any case: repeated errors.\n*   Registering at **Coinbase** to acquire ETH. Coinbase requires ID verification, so you have to upload a photo and wait for review. (if you have tips for easier methods, let me know)\n*   Me sending them ETH instead.\n*   Being quoted a price on ENS and then having to pay ‘gas fees’ on top.\n*   When registering their name on ENS: needing to wait for minutes in order for the transactions to clear. This can make people who are used to a fast web, and fast URL registration, quite nervous.\n\nThis is tough and requires a serious commitment from people. **Suddenly, the streamlined UX landscape of the internet breaks down and things get clunky.** For most people, that’s daunting, which is why I wrote [a piece clarifying all these terms](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/06/22/blockchain-basics-how-to-start-a-dao/) recently for my [newsletter](http://musicx.email/).\n\nhttps://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/06/22/blockchain-basics-how-to-start-a-dao/\n\nWhat I like about Songcamp is that it helps onboard people.

The way things work right now, it feels very much like pay-to-play. I’m glad there are projects like **[The Mint Fund](https://themint.fund/)** which helps underrepresented creators mint their first NFT by covering their gas fees and offering additional support, however people shouldn’t have to rely on funds in order to be able to meaningfully participate.\n\nThe way around is participating in a DAO. You can collectively raise funds and then grant participants tokens, which they can convert to cryptocurrency or fiat in order to accomplish their goals.\n\nSongcamp did a version of this for their first season when they [sold an NFT in order to raise funds](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/kh0Nl55x_PzNRADmIzAjzLi2RCK7SD9sMBJ2O5NqKpY) to cover the camp’s costs.\n\n### Group experimentation\n\nTogether, we’ll be doing a lot of firsts.

The general firsts are that the creative experiments Songcamp is running haven’t been done yet before. As a collective, it’s our first time collaborating and many people inside the collective have never met each other before. On an individual level, this is a first for the aforementioned reasons, but also because there may be web3 firsts like those I mentioned in the intro paragraph of this section.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/matthewchaim/status/1408517878526234629\n\n### Fun & valuable\n\nMost of all, it’s fun. I started the article with a sum of money to get your attention, but nobody is in this for the money. We have no idea what the outcome will be. Instead, it’s about collaboration, learning, experimenting, creating, socialising, and inspiring.\n\nIt’s exciting to be able to participate.

You can see the effect of the purge on the chart of [Bitcoin Hashrate](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-hashrate.html#3y):\n\n![](https://avc.com/content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-30-at-7.10.41-AM-2048x778.png)\n\nThis is a significant reduction in the processing power of the Bitcoin network and the result has been slower [transaction clearing times](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html#1y):\n\n![](https://avc.com/content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-30-at-7.13.38-AM-2048x778.png)\n\nIt will take time for miners outside of China to pick up the slack and get the hashrate and transaction times back to where they were, but that will happen. There are economic incentives for that to happen. What would be even better, and could happen, is for this new mining capacity to get built on clean/renewable energy.\n\nI believe the Chinese purge of Bitcoin mining is short term bearish but long term bullish for Bitcoin and crypto more broadly. It shows that a powerful government can take its best shot at a cryptonetwork and the only thing that will happen is capacity will move elsewhere.\n\nAnti-fragility is a beautiful thing to behold.\n", "timestamp": 1625052325, "digest": "ueMfOSn_-4fBAK7Aw6eFTPjhjA_e3UnaPToRP6bg5dc", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}
