Learn which you are. Act accordingly. Your life depends upon it.” ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman \n\nI've worked at companies over the years that claimed to have flat structures. They would proudly declare, \"we're not into hierarchy here!\" \n\nIt sounded nice in theory, but it was never true. There was always a hierarchy that remained hidden. The opaque nature of power in these environments made them difficult to work in and proved to be fertile soil for bad things to grow. \n\nA similar dynamic can be seen outside of the workplace. In American society, there is a false sense of equality and equal opportunity. We choose to ignore the heavy layers of class and social status blanketing our lives because acknowledging them can be uncomfortable.\n\n“Let’s hide follower counts and how many likes a post receives.”\n\nOver the years, I've started to believe that the world would be better if the power structures in our lives were more overt and less opaque. \n\nIn my experience, there can be more accountability when we know who has power and how they got it. Transparency can also make it harder for people with privilege to escape responsibility and get away with using their power poorly.\n\nFurthermore, people who **aren't** in positions of power can better manage their realities. When you don't have power, navigating a hidden hierarchy is like trying to find your way through a corn maze at night without a flashlight.\n\nIt's dark and disorienting.\n\n## Overt Power\n\n> “The shape of power is always the same: it is infinite, it is complex, it is forever branching. Its directions are unpredictable; it obeys its own laws. No one can observe the acorn and extrapolate each vein in each leaf of the oak crown. The closer you look, the more various it becomes. However complex you think it is, it is more complex than that. Like the rivers to the ocean, like the lightning strike, it is obscene and uncontained.”  ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\nThe power dynamics in the **Crypto** and **Web 3** space feels much more overt than anywhere else I've been in the past. That's part of why I resisted jumping into crypto for so long. Over time though I started to see how the overtness of all the power could actually be useful.\n\nA great example of this can be seen through the lens of the $WRITE race. The $WRITE race was a competition I had to win in order to publish on Mirror. The rules were relatively simple: in order to start a Mirror publication, I had to receive enough votes to be in the top 10 during one of the rounds. Each week, the top 10 people would be added to the platform.\n\nThis is fundamentally different than how most tech companies launch their products. Startups typically use invite systems where your chance of joining is dependent upon who you know. Sometimes you aren't even aware a new platform exists because you aren't friends with the insiders!\n\nThis old model works great for incumbents with strong networks, but not so great for people like me who don't live in California or New York and who aren't as well connected. \n\nMirror's $WRITE race still had A LOT of power dynamics, but I could actually see them and figure out how to work my way through them.\n\nOn the voting page, everyone's follower counts were clearly displayed. I could see who was voting for who and how many votes had been given. I could even go onto the blockchain and see Mirror's token/contract for myself. Furthermore, each round happened at the same time each week so I could prepare in advance for it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2acf08b9-64f7-481f-bb62-020e691fd827.png?height=4030&width=9374)\n\nThe openness of Mirror (and blockchain technology) has given me power I normally wouldn't have.\n\nNot only did I finally make the top 10 list this week, but I finished in first place thanks to the support of people I had only just met!

Some folks would post the Mirror equivalent of \"just setting up my twtr\" and then never do anything else. At times it felt more like the $DONOTWRITE race.\n\nI don't blame the Mirror team for this though because it's a complicated problem with no clear solution.

{"id": "ZpGz1H23YGeaAmj2jrGS_tsOXfKEMKThH9ouGCkYM5M", "title": "Financial Dadaism and the Rise of the Shitcoin", "body": "### Intrinsic Value and Market Value\n\nRecently, attempts to control financial markets by everyday people have been relatively successful, most notably the GameStop short squeeze and the rise of the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. \n\nBoth the GameStop market movements and Dogecoin rallies elicited significant negative public reaction. In the case of GameStop, legacy financiers and popular media accused the online community r/WallStreetBets of market manipulation and trading institutions barred retail traders from participating fully in the market. The Dogecoin rally was met with a slew of commentary trying to stop people from investing in the crypto because it could crash at any moment. Crypto prophets criticized the \"shitcoin\" boom, accusing participants of distracting from the true value of more promising blockchain projects.\n\nIn both cases, the negative reaction was born of the idea that financial behavior is or should be grounded in an analysis of a commodity's intrinsic value—that there is a meaningful link between intrinsic value and market value. Hardly anyone thinks intrinsic value and market value are the same, but most speculation in financial markets is purportedly based on the idea that intrinsic value and market value will eventually converge or that, at the very least, there is some correlation between the two. Cases like GameStop and Dogecoin subvert this idea in that investment decisions become increasingly involved with the question \"What are other players in the financial game doing?\" and less involved with \"What is the relationship between the intrinsic and market value of this asset?\"\n\nIn the case of GameStop and Dogecoin, the intrinsic value is nothing more than an afterthought. What really matters is the market value—the line on the screen that goes up and down. No one is looking at the fundamental value of Dogecoin or pouring over GameStop financial reports because they know the market value is divorced from the intrinsic value.\n\nThe project of financial analysis and much of economics is to pin down the logic of the market—to render it predictable and sensical. This approach often seems useful (and sometimes *is* useful) because it's a prophecy that fulfills itself: if we approach financial and economic behavior in a logical and sensical way, it becomes more likely that the market will follow the logic we inserted into the system. However, this logic is not always inherent to the market. In many cases, the assumption that a financial asset's market value will align with intrinsic value results in an actual correlation between the two simply because we think it will. For example, when Google announces a great new product, market players assume a connection between Google (the company) and GOOGL (the stock) and so the intrinsic value is tied to the market value because people think it is and the stock price rises.\n\nIn a financialized economy, speculation is king. It doesn't really matter if that speculation is grounded in solid financial or economic analysis. Very little is connecting Google to GOOGL except the assumption that they're connected. The realization that this connection can be broken is what allows speculative products like GME and Dogecoin to \"run away\" from the value of GameStop or the peer-to-peer trading system that underlies Dogecoin.\n\nThese cases demonstrate that people are increasingly realizing financial value can be completely fabricated. They're becoming financial dadaists.\n\n### Financial Dadaism\n\nDadaism is an artistic movement defined by whimsy, spontaneity, and irrationality. Founding dadaist artists were critical of capitalist society and claimed that something *is* art when someone *calls* it art. The idea questioned both the existence and nature of art: if everything can be art, then can anything be art? Is the concept of \"art\" meaningful at all?\n\nRecent understandings of—and actions within—the financial market have applied dadaist thought to the market in straightforward ways: the practice of divorcing speculative market value from intrinsic value identifies the absurdity of financial markets and rejects some mainstream economic ideas about how markets operate (namely how values converge).\n\nIt exposes that, just as art may become art when someone decides it is, financial products can be valuable simply because enough people say they are. It questions our conception of financial value, asking whether any financial product can be truly valuable if that value is fabricated by market activity. If what we call \"value\" can be created and destroyed by speculation alone, then is it really value at all?\n\nFinancial dadaists have importantly uncovered that the market can be whimsical and irrational. It can be a game or a toy or a meme. The market is just a way for people to interact with each other, and the behavior of the market and its participants doesn't need to fit any rigid definition.\n\nThe principles of financial dadaism are not new: market manipulators have always known the financial values they manipulate are not wholly grounded in any more tangible form of value. That's how algorithmic traders make massive sums of money from tiny stock market movements that don't correlate to any non-financial behavior. That's how hedge funds suppress or inflate stock prices even though nothing about the company's intrinsic value changes. \n\nPopular financial logic stands to justify these speculative profits by assigning a narrative of allocative efficiency to financial behavior. While it's true that some speculative financial behavior actually does facilitate economic growth and catalyze innovation, this logic of financial efficiency has often been applied where it really shouldn't be.\n\n### The Honesty of the Shitcoin\n\nThe beauty of Dogecoin and related cryptocurrencies is that there is no narrative that ties them to economic progress or efficiency. Much of the criticism of shitcoins, or digital currencies that have no immediate purpose, is that they're \"fake money\" and that their value is not necessarily based on anything other than speculation. In contrast to mainstream cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, which is ushering in an entire world of innovation and decentralized finance possibilities, these coins are pure exercises is speculation. The financial dadaist responds, \"What's wrong with that?\"\n\nThe difference between GameStop and Dogecoin is that Gamestop is a company that has significant intrinsic value. If GME stock was not traded, Gamestop would still have reason to exist. The same cannot be said for Dogecoin. With Dogecoin, market value is its only value. Hardly anyone thinks Dogecoin has intrinsic value and will be used as a standard currency in the future. It is truly understood solely as a speculative asset whose value is determined by the market without professing a connection to something else.\n\nIf every single financial asset can be inflated, deflated, and manipulated, then dropping the market logic charade seems like a step in the right direction. If we're going to participate in a massive financial guessing game, we should contain the implications to truly financial assets. We can trade financial assets that don't purport to be anything more than speculative games, or we can trade mortgage-backed securities and destroy the housing market or speculate about a publicly traded company and drive it to bankruptcy. Which do we prefer?\n\nFinancialization is absurd. Speculative markets are unpredictable. The financial market is more dadaist by the day. Shitcoins embrace that. It's easy to demonize shitcoins on the grounds that they're fake or absurd or don't make sense, but the fakeness and absurdity are the point. Those descriptors don't apply to shitcoins only because they're shitcoins but rather simply because they're financial assets and all financial assets can be absurd. This criticism actually unveils a benefit of shitcoins: they're more transparent about what they are and what they're meant to do. \n\nReally, the financial system doesn't make as much sense as we might think it does—it just has decades of shoddy economic theory and financial analysis trying to convince us that it represents real intrinsic value. The absurdity that was once hidden within the technocratic black box of finance and economics is being exposed to the public. \n\nMaybe financial dadaism is the new paradigm, and maybe shitcoins are the only assets that are irrational enough to make any sense.\n\n*If you liked this essay, [connect with me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/quasimatt)!\nIf you hated it, [bully me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/quasimatt)!*", "timestamp": 1619387488, "digest": "D7aCNSZ-PYYB6s90zNXVdTlk0yU41hxXJwh4XWkkS-A", "contributor": "0x64298A72F4E3e23387EFc409fc424a3f17356fC4"}
