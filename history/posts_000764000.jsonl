Lahrmann, a composer, producer and musician who has been performing as Excelsior since 2015.\n\nThe voice is often the aorta in Lahrmann’s body of work. She approaches composition as narrative sequences in which vocal structures, melodic lines and chords unfold alongside chains of digital processing like small paths in a landscape.\n\nHaving developed her musical persona by positioning herself amongst varying constellations of musicians, she tends to see herself more as a collaborator than a frontwoman bouncing openly against the borders of collectivism and DIY.\n\nWe are stoked to have Anja join [Derive](https://derive.works) and look forward to her contribution.

{"id": "tieocjKUgX5J_Qjtq2fjfDfzM7plOcGJKQwzClgZXyQ", "title": "Ready Player Everyone", "body": "*Or, an introduction to Verse*\n\nThe internet is filled with games - and I'm not talking about ones that are streamed on Twitch. The best internet games are the ones that are hidden in plain sight.\n\nFraming the internet as a collection of games, or even as a giant infinite game in itself, isn't a new idea. Numerous people have [discussed](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game) the implications of internet games and how winning strategies can produce outstanding real-life rewards. Social media stands out as perhaps the most analyzed sector of internet game theory. These games are well understood and exhibit a mature set of players, strategies, modes, and outcomes.\n\nMany of our behaviors around media and, more broadly, information platforms, however, are constrained by one game mode. The hyper-centralization of media has effectively created a single-player experience defined by two problematic features:\n\n1. Monopolistic platforms wield unilateral control over determining the information that we see\n2. While users are responsible for creating and curating information on these networks, they share none of the value generated from their work\n\nThus, single-player information networks suffer from incentive misalignment between the platform and its users. The platform is motivated to aggressively grow a single \"[global water cooler](https://youtu.be/oLsb7clrXMQ?t=953)\" network in order to maximize the amount of attention generated. However, users share none of the upside in the network's growth. Instead, individuals are incentivized to compete with each other to capture a fraction of the network's attention and bankroll that attention into downstream benefits. The result is a **zero-sum, single-player game** in which the platform is the [only guaranteed beneficiary](https://balajis.com/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter/).\n\n![Image credit: Chris Dixon, \"Why Decentralization Matters\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cfadc65d-bb2d-4bfc-8670-97dd537dc17b.png?height=600&width=1200)\n\nIn the last year alone, advertising revenues for every major media and search platform increased between [56](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-alphabet-googl-2q-earnings-report-2021-11627344309)-[74](https://www.yahoo.com/now/twitter-shares-rally-following-fastest-211406730.html)%. The participants on these networks natively earned what amounts to a rounding error on the platform's balance sheet.\n\nThe incentive misalignment between centralized platforms and its users results in an environment in which information becomes a commodity, and valuable information comes at a premium. When there’s infinite upside and zero downside to creating, networks become saturated as noise overtakes signal. Structurally, it's impossible for users to coordinate and produce legitimately valuable information which benefits both individuals and the network simultaneously.\n\nAs Vitalik [argues](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), legitimacy is the most important scarce resource. The net result of the fundamental problem - the value of centralized information networks is not shared by the participants - is this: ***centralized information is legitimacy-constrained***.\n\nThus, it is necessary to build a better system for universal media which enables individual participants to share in the collective upside of the network and coordinate to produce legitimately valuable information.\n\n**This is the Verse protocol.**\n\nVerse is a protocol for multiplayer cryptomedia on Ethereum. What is cryptomedia? As [Jacob Horne](https://twitter.com/js_horne) [explains](https://cryptomedia.wtf/), *cryptomedia can be thought of as hypermedia with built-in property rights*. ERC-721 NFTs are the canonical manifestation of cryptomedia. Each NFT consists of a media component (traditionally, a single URI), and an ownership component by which a single owner holds provenance over the token.\n\nTraditional NFTs conforming to this standard provide an extremely valuable system for facilitating artistry, patronage, and exchange around singular goods. However, they aren’t designed for solving legitimacy constraints around creating and curating valuable information.\n\nVerse introduces a new standard for **multiplayer cryptomedia markets specifically designed for high-signal information discovery and communication**. Through Verse, anyone can create a cryptomedia contract. Each contract consists of:\n\n1. A continuous feed of media URIs\n2. A tokenized market following a continuous [bonding curve](https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/)\n\nToken-holders are given the ability to add a piece of media to the contract’s feed. The price of each token is programmatically correlated with demand, so token-holders are incentivized to add media which increases the value of the feed and attracts new buyers who want to participate.\n\nVerse thus differentiates from traditional cryptomedia in two important ways:\n\n1. Instead of a single piece of media, each Verse cryptomedia object holds a feed with multiple pieces of media\n2. Instead of a single owner, each Verse cryptomedia object enables tokenized, fractional ownership with an unlimited number of participants\n\n**Why are these innovations important?**\n\nCrypto mechanisms, particularly tokenization and automated market makers, have enabled coordination games that could never practically exist before. What is a coordination game? I'm going to once again [borrow](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) one of Vitalik's definitions here, because it's extremely straightforward. In a coordination game, *if you act in a certain way alone, you are likely to get nowhere (or worse), but if everyone acts together a desired result can be achieved*.\n\n![Image credit: Vitalik Buterin, \"The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/026cb9e0-7cdc-4c7b-82ab-34940b9185ac.png?height=618&width=1510)\n\nLegitimacy is a natural byproduct of a coordination game. In any coordination game, if a mechanism incentivizes participants to cooperate and act together to achieve a goal instead of acting alone, that mechanism has legitimacy. **Verse is designed for individuals to coordinate around creating and curating the most valuable information around any arbitrary topic**. If token holders can coordinate to build a valuable, popular feed of media, the value of their tokens should increase as more people demand the token and want their own pieces of media included in the feed. In contrast, it's expensive for any one individual to add or curate irrelevant information in a market, because doing so decreases the token's value. Currently, web2 platforms produce more noise than signal as their networks grow, and it becomes extremely difficult for consumers to find the highest-quality information in an increasingly cluttered feed. Verse incentivizes perpetual creation and curation of the best information on any topic, enabling efficient and credible discovery.\n\nAs an example, consider the topic of DAOs. As it's such a nascent and trending topic, I want to find the best resources for learning about DAOs and how they operate. Where do I go? General web searches just throw me in an SEO'd hellscape. Trying to sift through social media to find the best thought leaders and posts they've written or recommended is too much work.\n\nWith a #DAOs cryptomedia object, participants are incentivized to produce a feed of high-quality posts on DAOs. I can trust the legitimacy of the information because I know that the market participants are financially motivated to build the most relevant feed possible. In this way, Verse cryptomedia creates a positive-sum ecosystem for generating the highest-quality information on any subject.\n\nSo what is the long-term goal for Verse? At its core, I think of Verse as a search protocol - one that produces information based on legitimized signals from incentivized participants. Information signaling is one of the most important building blocks we use for decision making. As Fred Ehrsam [points out](https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388803655184386?s=20), a lot of life comes down to effective information processing: picking the best option among a bevy of alternatives. **In an age of information saturation, on-chain signaling, uniquely enabled by crypto mechanisms, is the new search**. Rather than centralized algorithms indexing the entirety of the open web to produce results, signals stored on-chain enable anyone to create an algorithm that surfaces results among specific cryptomedia objects.

{"id": "FJ91HcD3c0F8bhnKy848W1NSJjKUEqNHr7PD_FXleuI", "title": "Ready Player Everyone", "body": "*Or, an introduction to Verse*\n\nThe internet is filled with games - and I'm not talking about ones that are streamed on Twitch. The best internet games are the ones that are hidden in plain sight.\n\nFraming the internet as a collection of games, or even as a giant infinite game in itself, isn't a new idea. Numerous people have [discussed](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game) the implications of internet games and how winning strategies can produce outstanding real-life rewards. Social media stands out as perhaps the most analyzed sector of internet game theory. These games are well understood and exhibit a mature set of players, strategies, modes, and outcomes.\n\nMany of our behaviors around media and, more broadly, information platforms, however, are constrained by one game mode. The hyper-centralization of media has effectively created a single-player experience defined by two problematic features:\n\n1. Monopolistic platforms wield unilateral control over determining the information that we see\n2. While users are responsible for creating and curating information on these networks, they share none of the value generated from their work\n\nThus, single-player information networks suffer from incentive misalignment between the platform and its users. The platform is motivated to aggressively grow a single \"[global water cooler](https://youtu.be/oLsb7clrXMQ?t=953)\" network in order to maximize the amount of attention generated. However, users share none of the upside in the network's growth. Instead, individuals are incentivized to compete with each other to capture a fraction of the network's attention and bankroll that attention into downstream benefits. The result is a **zero-sum, single-player game** in which the platform is the [only guaranteed beneficiary](https://balajis.com/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter/).\n\n![Image credit: Chris Dixon, \"Why Decentralization Matters\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cfadc65d-bb2d-4bfc-8670-97dd537dc17b.png?height=600&width=1200)\n\nIn the last year alone, advertising revenues for every major media and search platform increased between [56](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-alphabet-googl-2q-earnings-report-2021-11627344309)-[74](https://www.yahoo.com/now/twitter-shares-rally-following-fastest-211406730.html)%. The participants on these networks natively earned what amounts to a rounding error on the platform's balance sheet.\n\nThe incentive misalignment between centralized platforms and its users results in an environment in which information becomes a commodity, and valuable information comes at a premium. When there’s infinite upside and zero downside to creating, networks become saturated as noise overtakes signal. Structurally, it's impossible for users to coordinate and produce legitimately valuable information which benefits both individuals and the network simultaneously.\n\nAs Vitalik [argues](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), legitimacy is the most important scarce resource. The net result of the fundamental problem - the value of centralized information networks is not shared by the participants - is this: ***centralized information is legitimacy-constrained***.\n\nThus, it is necessary to build a better system for universal media which enables individual participants to share in the collective upside of the network and coordinate to produce legitimately valuable information.\n\n**This is the Verse protocol.**\n\nVerse is a protocol for multiplayer cryptomedia on Ethereum. What is cryptomedia? As [Jacob Horne](https://twitter.com/js_horne) [explains](https://cryptomedia.wtf/), *cryptomedia can be thought of as hypermedia with built-in property rights*. ERC-721 NFTs are the canonical manifestation of cryptomedia. Each NFT consists of a media component (traditionally, a single URI), and an ownership component by which a single owner holds provenance over the token.\n\nTraditional NFTs conforming to this standard provide an extremely valuable system for facilitating artistry, patronage, and exchange around singular goods. However, they aren’t designed for solving legitimacy constraints around creating and curating valuable information.\n\nVerse introduces a new standard for **multiplayer cryptomedia markets specifically designed for high-signal information discovery and communication**. Through Verse, anyone can create a cryptomedia contract. Each contract consists of:\n\n1. A continuous feed of media URIs\n2. A tokenized market following a continuous [bonding curve](https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/)\n\nToken-holders are given the ability to add a piece of media to the contract’s feed. The price of each token is programmatically correlated with demand, so token-holders are incentivized to add media which increases the value of the feed and attracts new buyers who want to participate.\n\nVerse thus differentiates from traditional cryptomedia in two important ways:\n\n1. Instead of a single piece of media, each Verse cryptomedia object holds a feed with multiple pieces of media\n2. Instead of a single owner, each Verse cryptomedia object enables tokenized, fractional ownership with an unlimited number of participants\n\n**Why are these innovations important?**\n\nCrypto mechanisms, particularly tokenization and automated market makers, have enabled coordination games that could never practically exist before. What is a coordination game? I'm going to once again [borrow](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) one of Vitalik's definitions here, because it's extremely straightforward. In a coordination game, *if you act in a certain way alone, you are likely to get nowhere (or worse), but if everyone acts together a desired result can be achieved*.\n\n![Image credit: Vitalik Buterin, \"The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/026cb9e0-7cdc-4c7b-82ab-34940b9185ac.png?height=618&width=1510)\n\nLegitimacy is a natural byproduct of a coordination game. In any coordination game, if a mechanism incentivizes participants to cooperate and act together to achieve a goal instead of acting alone, that mechanism has legitimacy. **Verse is designed for individuals to coordinate around creating and curating the most valuable information around any arbitrary topic**. If token holders can coordinate to build a valuable, popular feed of media, the value of their tokens should increase as more people demand the token and want their own pieces of media included in the feed. In contrast, it's expensive for any one individual to add or curate irrelevant information in a market, because doing so decreases the token's value. Currently, web2 platforms produce more noise than signal as their networks grow, and it becomes extremely difficult for consumers to find the highest-quality information in an increasingly cluttered feed. Verse incentivizes perpetual creation and curation of the best information on any topic, enabling efficient and credible discovery.\n\nAs an example, consider the topic of DAOs. As it's such a nascent and trending topic, I want to find the best resources for learning about DAOs and how they operate. Where do I go? General web searches just throw me in an SEO'd hellscape. Trying to sift through social media to find the best thought leaders and posts they've written or recommended is too much work.\n\nWith a #DAOs cryptomedia object, participants are incentivized to produce a feed of high-quality posts on DAOs. I can trust the legitimacy of the information because I know that the market participants are financially motivated to build the most relevant feed possible. In this way, Verse cryptomedia creates a positive-sum ecosystem for generating the highest-quality information on any subject.\n\nSo what is the long-term goal for Verse? At its core, I think of Verse as a search protocol - one that produces information based on legitimized signals from incentivized participants. Information signaling is one of the most important building blocks we use for decision making. As Fred Ehrsam [points out](https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388803655184386?s=20), a lot of life comes down to effective information processing: picking the best option among a bevy of alternatives. **In an age of information saturation, on-chain signaling, uniquely enabled by crypto mechanisms, is the new search**. Rather than centralized algorithms indexing the entirety of the open web to produce results, signals stored on-chain enable anyone to create an algorithm that surfaces results among specific cryptomedia objects. Searchers will pick the algorithm that comes up with the best results in their market(s) of interest.\n\nAlgorithms in the web2 era - such as recommender systems - are highly centralized, opaque and monolithic. In contrast, the Verse protocol enables a free-market for more meritocratic, transparent, and multiplayer algorithms that can be built and implemented by anyone to consume the data in Verse’s cryptomedia contracts. Search becomes not only multiplayer and curated, but also personally-signaled to the searcher. Thus, Verse enables a new permissionless, truly **multiplayer** standard for information legitimacy.\n\nMaking information games more multiplayer and open is imperative on a societal and individual level. Driven by the acceleration of an automated, machine-learning based world, open data and legitimate information are becoming critically scarce resources. It is critical to break the data oligopoly and control over information that monolithic platforms currently possess.

{"id": "R9YsPpP6jwooa7Vw6b0L9rtnZ4PYCvkaQODyfoddGcg", "title": "So Your Brand Just Bought Your First NFT, What Next?", "body": "### Brands are buying, just not buying-in … yet\n\nMost of us recently read about how [VISA spent almost $150,000 to buy CryptoPunk 7610](https://www.coindesk.com/visa-buys-cryptopunk-for-close-to-150k), a pixelated female with a mohawk, green eyeshadow and red lipstick. Their reasoning contains phrases such as:\n\n* “We need a firsthand understanding of the infrastructure requirements for a global brand to purchase, store, and leverage an NFT.”\n* “We wanted to collect an NFT that symbolizes the excitement and opportunity of this particular cultural moment,”\n\nWhat they didn’t mention was the CryptoPunk community itself, or how certain NFT collections are also badges and gateways to dynamic decentralized communities around the world—whose influence is growing stronger by the day. CryptoPunk holders alone count Jay-Z, Odell Beckham, Jr. and Steve Aoki among their ranks.\n\nAlmost as popular (and almost as expensive) are any one of the unique 10,000 variations of a digital primate group called The Bored Ape Yacht Club. While these apes adorn many social media profiles of their 5,300 or so owners, having a Bored Ape NFT also grants you access to a virtual club. As noted on the BAYC website, “Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits” which range from a digital graffiti board, to liquidity pools to the rights to build new projects on top of your particular ape’s image and traits. The project has gotten so much attention since it launched in April, that just last week Arizona Iced Tea announced it had bought one. I wonder how long it will be before we see an Ape flavored tea on store shelves across the country.\n\n### web3 > web2, and brands should buy-in\n\nThe construct to pay attention to here is that Crypto and NFTs are more than money and images—they are gateways to networks and ecosystems. The premise of web3 is to bring together communities, commerce, and culture under many decentralized roofs, while allowing participants to co-create together.\n\n[https://twitter.com/jarroddicker/status/1425535203397804039](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker/status/1425535203397804039)\n\nIt’s not just happening in the NFT space. Friends With Benefits and JUMP are just two of the many tokenized communities that have formed around the creative class—becoming vibrant digital societies of like minded creators, programmers, business thinkers and organizers using a new set of social tools to generate more value together.\n\nFriends With Benefits counts close to 7,000 members in its Discord group, with most of the channels and engagement gated until you are accepted through a membership committee and hold 75 $FWB tokens in a digital wallet. Once you are accepted and token verified you get access to conversation and connection across the world and from topics as varied as mental health and parenting to the metaverse and trading stonks.\n\nThis DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), [which in February ‘21 claimed](https://consensys.net/blog/codefi/friends-with-benefits-a-new-model-for-social-tokens-on-ethereum/) that only 400 members were holding enough $FWB for full access, has grown exponentially not only in membership but also in valuation as it $FWB the token has increased in the last 3 months from hovering around $4.50 each to $161 at the time of this writing. The community has also recently announced potential investment from well regarded VCs such as a16z and Kindred Ventures.\n\nSimilarly, JUMP is a growing collective of marketing, advertising, and creative professionals united in looking at web3 protocols as the gateway to future experiences all collected (and gated) behind the group’s $JUMP token—which at present is being gifted to participants as a social token for value created within the community by contributing to one-of-three teams: Newsfeed, Research, and Events. \\\\n  \\\\n The above are just a small number of extremely active and influential communities utilizing blockchain dynamics and web3 protocols to create collective opportunity. SeedClub, Forefront, ArtBlocks, 0n1Force, ApeDao, Animetas, and more are active projects with access based on token or NFT ownership which represent diverse audiences from all over the world, all walks of life, and many of whom are stacked with innovative, communicative creative people with often large online presences.\n\n### Brands need to engage deeper\n\nAs a marketer by trade I started to wonder which large brand will be the first to create experiences and opportunities purely for web3 communities.\n\nIt is one thing to buy an NFT or a .ETH address as [Budweiser recently did](https://www.coindesk.com/budweiser-nft-beer-ether-domain-name-server). The true unlock is to access the value associated with these early adopters and platform forward social citizens; it feels natural that brands, publishers, and festivals would engage them from an influence and partnership perspective. For years, brands have bought into creator and influencer culture and those models work. They need to recognize that web3 communities can be even more valuable, as not only are they influential and hyper-communicative, but they also have powerful incentive structures and can get a cohort behind something that benefits the community as a whole.\n\nThe key insight is that Arizona Iced Tea and Visa’s NFT purchase is just the cost of admittance—the real magic lies in the engagement and experience.\n\n### Looking ahead, some closing ideas\n\nIt may not yet be clear on how to activate with these communities—like anyone else it is about authentic access and opportunities to participate. Let me jump start the brainstorm for you:\n\n* Will Pepsi offer a suite of luxury boxes at next year’s Super Bowl for holders of CryptoPunks?\n* Will Coachella build a wallet enabled-entry to the Bored Ape Yacht Club satellite clubhouse with exclusive performances and meet and greets?\n* How about Coinbase hosting a custom speaker series for members of SeedClub?\n* Will Fortnite hold an exclusive e-gaming tournament for 0n1force owners?\n* Will Visa create an exclusive art preview at Art Basel for those who have ArtBlocks?\n* Where is the SXSW x FWB diner and will Franklin’s provide the BBQ?\n* When does TikTok create exclusive filters and audio unlockable for members of the RLY Dao?\n* Can Uniqlo do a licensing deal with holders of Pudgy Penguins for a new NFT-backed line of shirts?\n* How about Seth Rogen’s weed company HousePlant gifting a member discounts, and an exclusive Discord AMA between Seth and Ashton Kutcher | Mila Kunis to anyone who owns a Stoner Cat?\n* When does NIKE create the Axie Infinity Run Club to get those gamers some exercise IRL?\n* Will SpaceX create customizable vehicles for planetary travel in Axie Infinity or Alien Worlds?\n* When does Spotify create the music festival where the entire line-up is chosen by the RLY DAO?\n\nAs you can see these are just quick samples of ways in which brands could get involved. Quite similar to how brands have been courting groups of influencers over the years to create relationships and collective opportunity, it is only a matter of time before brands start seeing the true NFT/Token community ecosystem as a sea of influence waiting to be authentically engaged with. Who will be the first? This is the future of creator marketing.\n\nOne final note to consider for Brands. This industry is generating a tremendous amount of wealth at the moment.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ape6743/status/1431753960080220167](https://twitter.com/ape6743/status/1431753960080220167)\n\nThe fake internet money could go up, down or plunge to zero, but with new found bags comes a new class of consumer ready to buy products from common to luxury. Understanding their mindset by spending time with them and where they are, will help create opportunities to engage with them.\n\nIt isn’t going unnoticed that Louis Vuitton and Gucci are both in the NFT space, so your future luxury consumer may be deep in the VeeFriends community and looking for her next weekend car.\n\n## Also #DYOR #NFA, etc.\n\nTo close, I will reference this quote from RealVision’s Raoul Pal regarding tokenized collectives:\n\n“*It's the biggest thing I've ever seen, we all know how big crypto is, but within crypto, community tokens are going to change all business models.*”\n\n[https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1430241316554698752](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1430241316554698752)\n\n**Author credits**\n\nThis essay was written by [Sam Ewen](https://twitter.com/SamEwen),\n\nThank you to [Jonathan Goodwin](https://twitter.com/imtalljonathan), [Brennen Schlueter](https://twitter.com/brennenschlu), and [Jeff Kauffman, Jr.](https://twitter.com/jeffkauffmanjr) for reviewing the essay’s draft and contributing additional insights.\n\n**About JUMP**\n\nJUMP is the first tokenized community for marketing and advertising professionals.\n\nJoin us at [JoinJump.Community](https://www.joinjump.community/) and follow [@jumperstweeting](https://twitter.com/jumperstweeting).\n\n**Additional reading**\n\n[NFT brand strategy: Visa and Arizona Iced Tea ape into web3](https://jump.mirror.xyz/ATrIlwxvkXwdo2R18kZIgYwspbURdyzjf1y-a9F99Jk) by [@chadhugghins](https://twitter.com/ChadHugghins)\n\n[Nifty Corporates](https://www.notboring.co/p/nifty-corporates) by [@packy](https://twitter.com/packyM)", "timestamp": 1631048951, "digest": "CPRivsU8T32ZSVvQd_ih8RPBKETGWxvvkazGvx9BmkI", "contributor": "0xC143c4E2f95B7B49aF49501323093efFeDa42e41"}
