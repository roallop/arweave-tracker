As that becomes increasingly obvious to the media industry at large, there has been an acceleration of development by both challengers and incumbents to position themselves to capture media's most critical natural resource: people.\n\nThe creator economy served as a catalyst to disrupt legacy structures by introducing platforms & products that enable individuals to build a business around themselves. There are many reasons why individuals want to go independent which I explain in detail here ([Media Companies as Record Labels](https://jarroddicker.medium.com/the-next-media-business-talent-reputation-and-lessons-from-record-labels-e14b695c43b)) and here ([Rise of the Renaissance Creator](https://jarroddicker.medium.com/media-2020-rise-of-the-renaissance-creator-459daec4bc6b)), which introduce a variety of opportunities for both the talent and existing media institutions. The rapid development of platforms and services that empower individuals to build a business around themselves is a major one. Top talent wants more control and ownership over their work, having options to transcend their reputation and financial success from a parent brand.\n\nBut independence is really hard. The creator economy has invited criticism of creator burnout, lack of necessary support and an absence of strategic and educational resources for individuals to better guide themselves in isolation. While there is accelerated development in the creator economy to fulfill those needs, there’s another economy being built that is positioned to extend the promise of the new media structure even further.  \n\nThe ownership economy-- by way of decentralized autonomous organizations aka DAOs + non-fungible tokens aka NFTs-- builds a business on top of the creator economy that encourages creators, operators and the community to collaborate together under a new, interdependent ownership mechanism that combines the best of both (legacy + creator economy) worlds and then some.\n\nThis new media structure will be wholly owned by the creators, operators and consumers themselves. It will be a product of both the public and its producers and will not limit participants to a single company. These media companies can be looked at as collectives, with their own identities, where creators and consumers are encouraged to flow interdependently throughout various collectives. All of which results in everyone investing in both the development of each collective and sharing in the value of the collective’s upside. \n\nTo think of this pragmatically, let’s look at TV shows. Actors, actresses, producers and writers are free agents and sign deals for specific series on many platforms. Each series builds its own identity, reputation and community. The individuals that contribute to the show are free to work on other projects and may even be encouraged to in order to increase their own and the show's reputation (marketing!). This interoperability makes everything the individual touches more valuable. As I said in past posts, the new media structure starts to look more like record labels or in the example above, production studios, rather than traditional brand structures.\n\nSo back to creator DAOs and NFTs. The introduction of creator DAOs means that both the creators, its support, its contributors & its audience are all owners in the collective. It means that every operation, and participants in the operation, are now shareholders. Today, creators can be owners in a media company by way of equity, but that’s often limited by the role each individual plays. As a result, once talented individuals build a strong enough reputation, they're incentivized to negotiate contracts or go independent to retain more ownership over their work. Media companies are starting to think about how they build a more welcome environment for those creators, but they’re developing in parallel to challenger structures like creator DAOs. DAOs present an alternative organizational structure that tries to align incentives for the long-term among a variety of stakeholders. The relationship changes from creator and consumer to everyone as co-creators. Creative organizations begin to look more like flat peer-to-peer networks as opposed to hierarchies. Everyone who contributes to the media company is a co-creator; the creator, support staff and community.\n\nThis is possible because the media company (collective) itself is a crowdfund of its creators, supporters and community members. All participators invest in the entity which results in a token, the “equity” of DAOs. All revenue across advertising, subscriptions, events and other means is then pooled to a treasury where all cash inflows and outflows are recorded publicly. There is a universal share in the ownership. \n\nWhere NFTs come in is that all digital assets created by the DAO are minted as NFTs. Through that, every asset becomes managed, monitored and owned. This means that creators, operators and participants are all collaborators on the NFT asset. Outside of pure ownership and participation, this means that an asset returns royalties based on the performance of the content, delivering returns for participants in perpetuity.\n\nWhat’s not often discussed, but is a real struggle in the existing media space, is the value attributed to creative assets. As media moved from print to digital, creative assets have lost the ability to control and maintain value throughout the web ecosystem. With NFTs, digital media now becomes a liquid financial asset secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts. \n\nCurrently, each creator receives royalties in perpetuity when their NFTs are sold on the secondary market. [As Flynn explains in his latest piece](https://jammsession.mirror.xyz/-xYcfFRlhDdLDSUgRMTYJAaRJBs2VG4LP34DnOV84mI), NFT creators in the future will have two paths: independent or collective. As an independent, creators can realize the full upside of their NFT creations and earn built-in royalties. But the collective model is an entirely new way to build distribution. Because the NFTs are programmable, the royalties can be broken down further into fractional shares. Instead of a creator earning their full share of royalties on share, they can distribute royalties to agents or collectives, who can help the creator gain distribution opportunities for the NFT.\n\nLet’s get pragmatic again-- Similar to that IMDB is a database of media attached to a single creator or operator, the ledger will now provide a graph representing the creator or operator to every piece of media they are associated with or a contributor to. When the NFT is sold, all creators who were part of the DAO are time stamped with a block number, representing a creator’s affiliation with the process or moment in time they were a part of.\n\nBut there’s more. Another benefit of NFTs is that they turn digital media into public goods with pseudonymous ownership. A digital media file that’s minted as an NFT can be read by everyone, but owned as a collectible by a single entity. This provides a new monetization channel for digital media without limiting growth by putting content behind a paywall. It also revitalizes business models that used to be lucrative in the print era but lost in the digital era like the wire service. \n\nThere are parallel efforts throughout the media and tech ecosystem to try and get to the same place; how do we evolve the media’s infrastructure to draw benefit for the talent, the support and the community? In order to capitalize on providing an infrastructure that benefits all parties, the foundation needs to be broken down and built back up again. It’s very hard to renovate a business, especially one that hasn’t been built on the criteria for the new era. The creator economy started tearing down the foundation of legacy media’s structure to encourage both existing media companies and new entrants to think about building for and enabling talent based companies. As both businesses begin to map out the next iteration of their technical and business architecture, there is infrastructure being mapped out that is ripe for all economies to be built on top of-- the ownership economy. \n\n---------------------------------\n\n***Support your local artists***\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/1688)", "timestamp": 1614618595, "digest": "srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

By holding certain social tokens, users will have a claim over $YUP rewards given to accounts linked to those specific tokens. We're piloting this with Alex Masmej and the $ALEX token and are looking for other social token holders, leaders, and platforms to [*work with*](https://yupio.typeform.com/to/cMDWqTmS).\n\nSocial tokens are growing at an incredible pace, becoming a [*$250m market*](https://socialstudies.substack.com/p/a-primer-on-social-money-by-holyn) in less than two years. Here are a few different social token types that we have seen come to light during this development:\n\n🤓 **The personal token** ➡️ $ALEX, $KERMAN\n\nCreated to support and invest in an individual's goals whether professional or personal.\n\n🌎 **The community token** ➡️ $FWB, $KARMA, $WHALE, $CHERRY, $JAMM, $THANKS\n\nCreated to bring people together based on a common interest or mission.\n\n🤩 **The fan club token** ➡️ $RAC, $FIRST\n\nHybrid that brings together fans (a community) based on a common interest in an individual's content.\n\n[*(*Social Studies*, Brett Goldstein)*](https://socialstudies.substack.com/p/a-primer-on-social-money-by-holyn)\n\nAs new versions of social tokens emerge, so too do new use-cases and incentives to hold or spend these tokens. Some include:\n\n*   Token-permissioned chat groups, features, events, or newsletters  ➡️ [*Outpost Protocol*](https://outpost-protocol.com/), [*Mirror*](https://mirror.xyz/)\n*   Tipping within communities ➡️ [*Collab Land*](https://collab.land/)\n*   DAO Governance ➡️ [*KARMA DAO*](https://twitter.com/karma_dao)\n*   Token-only purchases or collectible drops\n*   Rewards for social action ➡️ [*Unite.Community*](https://unite.community/)\n*   Retroactive distributions ➡️ [*RAC*](https://blog.ourzora.com/home/introducing-rac)\n\nThese concepts are beautiful and have worked quite well thus far. In Outpost's [*Sam Hatem's*](https://twitter.com/sam\\_\\_hatem) words, they allow \"consumers to be stakeholders in communities and financially benefit from the creator’s success.\" This is the future that we all want, and Yup wants to help. We propose a new use-case for social tokens to expand on their possibilities and support their development.\n\n### Social Token YUP Rewards\n\nIn line with this movement, Yup presents *Social Token YUP Rewards* as an additional incentive to hold social tokens for the right to a portion of creator/curator rewards distributed through the Yup Protocol. When social media accounts tied to your social token earn YUP, you earn YUP.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nIn its current form, the Yup Protocol rewards users in newly-minted YUP based on curation: when someone influential likes a piece of content across the web, the creator and previous curators earn YUP. A Twitter 'like', for example, is weighted based on the liker's influence, given a token value, and distributed to the tweet's author and all the likers that came before. This creates an incredibly robust curator economy. [*(Learn More)*](https://docs.yup.io/#/)\n\nSocial Token YUP Rewards will allow the admins/owners of certain accounts associated with a social token to link their YUP earnings to a specific token. Then, holders of the said token would be able to claim YUP rewards earned by those social accounts during their time of holding.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_ca1224e16e454fd884ff8080020f8fbf~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_800,h\\_800,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nFor example, Alex Masmej may link his Twitter account @AlexMasmej to the $ALEX token reward pool. If the @AlexMasmej account earns 100 YUP while you own 10% of all $ALEX tokens, you can claim 10 YUP from the pool. You cannot claim YUP for rewards that were given during times where you did not hold $ALEX.\n\nThe act of linking/unlinking, along with other changes, may require a token vote per the defined rules of each individual social token. The act of claiming rewards would function similarly to products like [*Roll*](https://tryroll.com/) or [*Unite.Community*](https://unite.community/).\n\n**Why this is important**\n\nThe stronger the reasons to hold a social token are, the more valuable and robust its economy will be.

It can turn your backyard into [London’s #1 restaurant on TripAdvisor](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/434gqw/i-made-my-shed-the-top-rated-restaurant-on-tripadvisor).

It can help you land your soulmate or your dream date. It can make you rich, and not just financially.\n\n*It stems from social capital: the extent to which one can influence another human’s behavior. *You can think of it as the power one acquires from social relationships (direct or otherwise), separate from money. That being said, considering the asymmetric information of today’s world, it is as valuable as dollars and purchased for pennies.\n\nIn the past, human contact was mostly face-to-face and therefore harder to fabricate. There were a handful of well-known and highly influential people, but the rest were only interacting with their local surroundings. Technology improved communication, and we birthed the ‘celebrity figures’ of radio and TV who held significant social capital. Then online influencers rose from the distribution properties of the internet and really shifted the balance. Today, everyone’s opinion about everyone is a common form of signaling: having 120k followers is like receiving an undergraduate degree in certain industries. People have begun to judge each other through media, getting data from news feeds. Social capital has multiplied in worth, defined by metrics such as the number of followers, likes, reach, engagement, or whatever. With them came influencer campaigns, viral videos, and Twitter-based presidential races. **We assign online metrics value and from them we derive our values**.\n\nInfluence is what makes the pen mightier than the sword. And while we fight today with digital pens and swords, influence is as mighty as ever. Let’s see what happens when we play around with the foundation of this influence.\n\n### Social 2.0\n\nThe connectivity of the world has made social platforms the launch pads of revolutions: The [Arab Spring began on Facebook](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284181844\\_The_Arab_spring_Its_origins_evolution_and_consequences_four_years_on). The [Black Lives Matter Movement](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/19/blacklivesmatter-birth-civil-rights-movement) saw its beginnings on social media and quickly exploded into a national movement. [All Vines in 2013](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/8-reasons-why-vine-mattered-129757/)? The[ *ALS Ice Bucket Challenge*](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jul/27/how-the-ice-bucket-challenge-led-to-an-als-research-breakthrough) in 2014. *#*[*MeToo*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2017/12/20/sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace-in-a-metoo-world/#1d667b2d5a42) in 2018. With [3.9 billion people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273018/number-of-internet-users-worldwide/) connected to the internet and [3 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/) using social media, anything is possible if you go viral. The “[catch me outside, how bout dat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkmOnEFCyI0)?” girl is a [multi-gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhad_Bhabie#Discography) selling artist. *How bout dat *indeed…\n\nThis is a continuation of historical trends: Power is getting people to pay attention. Social media has evened the playing field and added new dimensions.\n\nTake a walk down a high school hallway today to see how the social capital game has changed for teens. What matters to them more than a Letterman jacket is their follower count, and subconsciously, their sacred *follow : follower ratio*. Not only do they need to prove that others are paying attention to them, they need to do it while not caring about others.\n\n> On Instagram, success depends on how well you follow the unspoken rules — you like my photo, I’ll like yours. If a photo isn’t getting likes, take it down. Be creative. Be consistent. [#followforfollow](https://www.blog.yup.io/blog/hashtags/followforfollow). Be ‘original’.\n\nIt’s not just about the amount of engagement you have, but also about how much engagement it looks like you have. Semi-official support groups form as people build their social capital together, engaging with each other’s content. From expertly crafting hashtags to carefully designing an appealing feed theme, being Instafamous is hard work. *On top* of that hard work is a layer of deception that everyone is participating in.\n\n> “The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, you’ve got it made.” — Groucho Marx\n\nIn an age where digital personas sometimes outshine real ones, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat are your best ways of obtaining social capital. And as our world becomes more and more digital, the benefits of achieving digital fandom are more real than ever.\n\n### Virtual content with real-world consequences\n\nDigital social capital has real-world value, not just high school popularity. Online metrics can lead to opportunities: money, jobs, exclusive access to anything. Companies are always on the lookout for new ways to reach consumers because they’re well aware that [70% of millennials](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/youtube-stars-influence/) trust influencers more than traditional celebrities and more than 40% trust them more than their own friends.\n\nPopular Insta-Influencers can make thousands through product placement. Twitter comedians have translated their online success to real standup careers. YouTube stars have become TV or music celebrities. All of them have been affected by fake activity on their platform. You might think Drake has more Twitter clout than Lil Wayne, but [https://fakers.statuspeople.com](https://fakers.statuspeople.com/) might disagree. It’s a platform that simply parses followers as fake, inactive, or good. While Drake has 13% more followers, most of his are fake or inactive and he only has HALF as many active accounts following him. Now, I don’t think all of these celebrities are faking their users, theirs may be a bi-product of the larger issue. Still, you can see how the misrepresentation can affect action. Obama’s are [11% fake](https://fakers.statuspeople.com/BarackObama)!\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1\\*JT70hgI6GevsExRfQdb4jw.png)\n\nEven the professional world values these online metrics. Competitive institutions ask for social media handles from applicants and LinkedIn metrics matter when hiring. Large amounts of digital social capital create the appearance of credibility. 100k followers must mean they’re doing *something* right.\n\nWe see this extending to the elite, who often feel that it’s not enough to be rich. **They wish to matter to those who matter. **In some ways, that sort of capital is more freeing than money. If you have enough followers, nothing is off limits.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*wd1Fj1Udk_yPWQ2CKi\\_5Aw.png)\n\nWith 300 Insta-followers, good luck getting a DM response from your favorite celebrity. With 50k, they might acknowledge you. With 5 million, they’ll be your best friend. That’s just 21st century human nature.\n\nIn, 2015, local ‘legend’ David Duey Spargo [snuck in backstage at a Peking Duk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3345074/Man-fools-security-letting-stage-Peking-Duk-gig-editing-band-s-Wikipedia-page-make-look-like-family-mamber.html) concert by adding himself as their cousin on Wikipedia. He simply showed the bouncer their wiki page and was welcomed into the green room. In that moment, a fake wiki page edit did something for him that even a legit birth certificate of Peking’s real cousin couldn’t do: *manipulate human behavior*.\n\nWhile we love to see these social hacks, sometimes they’re used by selfish people to force an action. That is when the opaqueness of all of these metrics become destructive. The infamous Fyre team collaborated with the commonly disliked f\\*ckjerry and inflated hype around the festival through fake accounts. While this helped them spread the word quickly, it was massively imbalanced with the product they were actually providing, but customers couldn’t differentiate because of the top-notch marketing and influencers. This led to a con that went on too long full of fake bungalows, unconfirmed artists, fake island, fake promises. And, to this day, smart people talk about how their marketing scheme was revolutionary. There are more direct uses. Someone who’s willing to shell out a little cash can will a story into reality. Last summer, a friend showed me that Tatatu’s Andrea Iervolino was paying for [fake users ](https://www.instagram.com/andreaandselina/)and reporters to spread rumors that he was dating Selina Gomez in an effort to get her to be with him. They never even remotely dated from my understanding, but that didn’t stop [Yahoo from writing about it](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/selena-gomez-apos-boyfriend-3-160202896.html): *Who Is Selena Gomez’s New Boyfriend? 3 Things To Know About Italian Producer Andrea Iervolino — Including How He Was Once Sued For Sexual Assault.* Not the title I would’ve gone with, but this is somehow seen as real news. Those accounts and posts have been deleted and I have no way to confirm the story, but I‘m not trying to make a specific point about Andre. What’s interesting is that this kind of behavior can happen and most likely does. Even if we’re not all famous enough to pretend to date Selena, the average user can do serious damage online through the most subtle of ways. But just how easy is this?\n\n### The Internet of Fakes\n\nIt’s actually easy to boost social metrics…like *really *easy. Like, “*it can’t possibly be this easy*” easy. Whether it’s followers, retweets, shares, views, or comments that you want, they can all be bought. For really cheap too! There are operations around the world that provide these services and it’s difficult to believe exactly what they’re doing until you see it with your own eyes. Above is a Chinese *click farm*: a rig of thousands of smartphones pretending to be real users. These phones are liking, commenting, following, viewing, streaming, favoriting, and sharing the content of paying customers. Using a separate phone per user makes it very difficult for apps to distinguish bots from humans.\n\n#### Robin Hood Experiment\n\nIn an attempt to better understand the impact of fake social capital, [like many others](http://mediakix.com/2017/08/fake-instagram-influencers-followers-bots-study/#gs.5jdvqg), I purchased some social clout, ran some bots, and manipulated some metrics myself. To make it worthwhile, I directed most of those resources to support friends of mine who are influencers, mostly musicians and fashionistas. I took some notes and compared it to other experiments, learning a lot from the process as I’ll lay out in this piece. Many of my friends don’t know I did this and may be finding out for the first time reading this. If so, *it was me!* I promise no influencers were hurt in the making of this.\n\nFor less hassle than getting real attention and less money than an *avocado sandwich*, you can grow any social media account. There are some obvious rules to follow. You can’t grow too fast; going from 1 thousand → 1 million IG story views in one day will raise some red flags. The larger you get, the more costly it becomes and the less valuable it is; 10 IG followers cost one penny — and that’s the *expensive* option—but 10 million unique followers to one account will cost more than a million pennies. Followers fade over time, but likes and comments are forever.\n\nNo matter how you measure your social capital, it’s all available at the click of your mouse.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/0\\*peN3CWZjSromDZDC)\n\nI mean, look at this convenient [menu](https://followiz.com/services). It’s like a candy store for insecure teenagers or ambitious millennials. And who could blame them; this stuff is valuable. My attempts were pretty successful in getting over 250,000 engagements of various types on several accounts with less than $10 altogether using these tools. From the perspective of the guys at [Mediakix](http://mediakix.com/2017/08/fake-instagram-influencers-followers-bots-study/#gs.5jdvqg) who ran a similar study with two fake accounts:\n\n> “Within a day, we had enough content to build two entirely fake accounts. Next, we posted daily and purchased followers. We started with buying 1,000 followers per day because we were concerned that purchasing too many followers at the onset would result in Instagram flagging the account. However, we quickly found that we were able to buy up to 15,000 followers at a time without encountering any issues.”\n\nIn addition to the ease at which you can do this, there are some other important features worth noting:\n\n#### You don’t need to pay.\n\nSome bots and engagement groups are free. Just engage with other people’s pages and they’ll engage with yours– tit for tat. Groups like this one on Telegram promote 24-hour channels with thousands of individuals. That way, they leverage everyone’s engagement to give all members a higher perceived social capital. This channel in particular, has 60 groups with over 600,000 participants.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0\\*DIUIXQxKXrS7MI_P)\n\n#### You don’t need to identify yourself.\n\nNone of these sites, bots, or tools require you to sign in with your socials. They allow for quick anonymous logins, encrypted messaging, and payments with crypto currencies or a credit card. This means that it’s tough for social media apps to prove that *you* did this yourself and someone else didn’t prank you or something. Their ability to discourage you from doing this malicious stuff depends on how easy it is to tell that your engagement is faked, which today is incredibly difficult.\n\n#### You can’t really tell\n\nSkeptics argue that it’s easy to spot fake accounts and bot activity. And yes, some are very obvious for sure, but the more you’re willing to pay, the realer they become, all the way to real humans pretending to be your loyal followers. While a marketing firm might look critically at their applicants’ social media activity, the average person doesn’t. Most companies don’t either. In their experiment, [Mediakix](http://mediakix.com/2017/08/fake-instagram-influencers-followers-bots-study/#gs.5jdvqg) was able to convince 4 companies to pay and send free products to fake accounts and bots.\n\nIt’s enough that someone has 50,000 followers and that their posts regularly get millions of engagements to net a contracting deal. And success begets success — it’s a rolling stone. 5 bucks might be just enough to get the ball rolling in the early days of your social media journey. A quick five-thousand followers are easily observable if thousands of legitimate followers come after. It’s even common for genuine influencers to start their careers off with 1k fake followers to build a base. No one would be the wiser.\n\n*Some fakeness is obvious. *There was recently a [report](https://www.trustnodes.com/2019/03/24/close-to-half-of-justin-suns-new-followers-revealed-as-fake) that 20,000 of [Justin Sun’s](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron) recent 50,000 followers are fake. Justin is the founder of TRON, a blockchain, a technology in which community and social capital play a large role. You can see below that his followers consisted of accounts with no profile pic, bio, tweets, or other followers/following. This would be a prime example of what *not *to do. I wonder, how many of his 1 million total followers do you think are fake? And further, would Tron have hit a market cap high of $16.7 billion if not for this fraudulent manipulation? Only Jack Dorsey knows…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1\\*EnhTgV1VDDkEZ07ThkNQcQ.jpeg)\n\n*Some are more sophisticated*, like Chinese companies and consultants that use real people to submit fake reviews on Amazon products. They use ‘human click farms’ much like the wall of phones but with workers in an office somewhere. Lots of money is on the line to be the top ‘sunglasses’ listed on Amazon, which largely comes down to user reviews. So people hire ‘experts’ to help them increase ratings. As long as the information sounds ‘American’, it will pass as a legit review and have serious impact on placement. If you have a way to detect these scalably, Amazon is surely hiring.\n\nIn a world where social metrics are purchased or manipulated, how can we trust them? **How can we value social capital? **Maybe, you could argue that real people showing up to somethings is still a measure of social value. Nope! Even that can be bought with [Crowds on Demand](https://crowdsondemand.com/), a service for on-demand crowds of people. This notion expands to all forms of business, legal proceedings, security risks, etc. How will we measure this type of value in the future? Let’s look at some of the tricks available for this type of manipulation.\n\n### Tools of the Trade\n\n#### Bots\n\nRobots may have not taken over the world yet, but they’ve conquered social networks. This includes bots that automate activity from a user’s real account (like following people in large quantities until they follow you back and then unfollowing them) or activity on other accounts that benefits the user (likes from random accounts). While researchers have done their estimates, there is no consensus on how many bots there are on various social networks. The conservative guess is 20% but some go as high as +50%. Facebook has openly admitted to roughly [12% fake accounts / duplicates](https://mashable.com/2017/11/02/facebook-phony-accounts-admission/#Hs2OUKDGiPqu). What’s more interesting is how pervasive bots are in scandals. In 2016, Ferrara, Varol, Davis, and a few other researchers completed a [highly recommended study](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2820000/2818717/p96-ferrara.pdf?ip=72.229.113.75\\&id=2818717\\&acc=OA\\&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E3EFC16F61770927B&\\__acm\\_\\_=1555258724\\_1da37ca292e2dd930aa2ed9ae9b86801) on social bots. It’s full of very interesting visuals for those who hate to read. Below is a network visualization of all twitter interaction surrounding the [#SB277](https://www.blog.yup.io/blog/hashtags/SB277) vaccine laws in California. The red nodes are users identified as most likely bots, the blue nodes more likely human, on a spectral scale. The node size represents influence (times a user is retweeted). Notice how the large nodes close to the center of the large cluster are mostly red? It seems as though bots are significantly driving the spread of information surrounding this event. On the right, you can see a cluster of mostly blue nodes, which may mean that this group has remained more diligent about not engaging with bot activity. No important debate is free from some automated social liquidity.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1\\*OTdk9L1uaTqUCRMv08TJkA.png)\n\n#### Registries\n\nWe all take Google Maps locations as legitimate and verified, making it one of the most vulnerable sites for data manipulation. Being at the top of a *Google Maps* listing, like Amazon, is a powerful seal of approval, so some try to fake their way there. As Bryan Seely, discussed in his[ Ted talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c6AADI7Pb4), Google’s algorithms are easily manipulated. With simple social capital manipulation, he managed to tap the *Secret Service*’s phone lines.** It took him 20 minutes.**\n\nHe created an identical *Secret Service* listing in Washington D.C with a different phone number. Same address as the original and he even added more pictures for good measure. Then Bryan deleted the real office’s reviews and added fake reviews to his fake listing. His antics switched the *Google* weighting and suddenly, his listing was placed higher than the real one. People began calling his phone in search of the secret service. He routed all official *Secret Service* calls through his own number and recorded all of them. He was never caught for this — Bryan volunteered this information to the *FBI *a few weeks later. The *FBI* told *Google* to fix the problem. They did for about 4 weeks by significantly raising their security standards, and then quickly returned to the algorithms they used before.\n\nBut even if *Google* had addressed the issue, how could they prevent this entirely? If reviews and engagements can be purchased, any individual can vault a listing to the top. And this happens *all the time. *When it does, the consequences can be disastrous.\n\nPeople’s livelihoods depend on how the internet organizes information. In one prank, the weekend hours for this[ man’s](https://www.wired.com/2014/07/hacking-google-maps/) restaurant were changed to “closed” on *Google Maps*. The culprit is still unknown — but it was enough to entirely sabotage his business. Within a year, the Serbian Crown was closed down. The legal recourse available to the owner was virtually nonexistent. Proving causation in this situation is impossible. This is just one of many stories. This 2013 *Wired*[ article](https://www.wired.com/2014/07/hacking-google-maps/) highlights numerous examples. Competitors can act maliciously with virtually no consequences and to devastating effect.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0\\*4-0xzYxv4AQ-DhTq.jpg)\n\n**William S. Burroughs once said, “*You can’t fake quality any more than you can fake a good meal*.” Well, Oobah Butler did both, **pushing his restaurant to #1 on *TripAdvisor* in London. The catch was, the[ restaurant never existed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqPARIKHbN8). He created a website, took funny fake pictures like the one above, set up a phone line, and got verified on *TripAdvisor*. A few fake reviews in and the real calls started coming. He even allowed some callers to actually eat at the restaurant, serving cup noodles and microwaved pasta to snobby foodies, who ate it up. He didn’t just fool *TripAdvisor *and it’s users. PR firms and marketers fell for it too. *The Shed at Dulwich, *as he called it, received so much buzz that he ended up opening it as a real restaurant that functions today in high dining.\n\n#### Deepfakes\n\nFake or malicious content won’t be going away anytime soon. In fact, as technology improves, it will become easier than ever to misdirect people and spread disinformation. This [Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth) discusses the growing potential for creating fake videos with real people. Facial generation software can already create faces that are virtually impossible to recognize as fake. One site called [*Which Face is Real*](http://www.whichfaceisreal.com/index.php) highlights the difficulty to distinguish real faces from fake ones with a game that asks users to choose between a fake and real photo. Below is an example.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1\\*XnSgwj77diHmlKSMlIoPtA.png)\n\nWhat will be the consequences when software can create live videos of anyone saying anything — indistinguishable from reality? We’re not there yet,[ but we’re getting close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0). Yes, in certain cases, the costs may be enormous to effectively and convincingly generate fake social capital. However, the costs are no longer a barrier when the real world incentives are so high. What is a few hundred thousand dollars if it makes you famous, propels your restaurant to number one, or manipulates a political election? The results can be priceless…and destructive. The reality is, social capital is incredibly easy to manipulate, platforms are helpless to stop it, and the fraud has serious, real-world consequences. Soon, we’ll have a hard time distinguishing fake from real and lies from advertising.\n\n### We crave social scarcity\n\nEugene Wei, in his essay “[Status as a Service](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service)”, eloquently breaks down the science of social media. Every successful social network is built around how users acquire social capital, he poses. Capital must be earned through *work — *endless hours of YouTube video editing, Instagram photo shoots, the perfect Twitter joke.\n\n> “If it were so easy, it wouldn’t be worth anything. Value is tied to scarcity, and scarcity on social networks derives from proof of work. Status isn’t worth much if there’s no skill and effort required to mine it.”\n\nAs humans, we are experts at deciphering how and where our efforts are best directed for the most social capital accumulation. Popular social media platforms provide fair and valuable ways for people to acquire capital.\n\nHere’s the problem. As Eugene Wei writes — all this fame and popularity — is valuable because it’s rare. People care about your social capital because not everyone can get it. If anyone could get a million follows or fifty million views, you would need to have much more than that to be special. If it doesn’t take work, then it’s not worth it.\n\nWhat is left out of Wei’s extensive description of these economic models is the existing incentives to “fake it till you make it” rather than to “keep it real”. The loopholes are real, and people use them to get likes that look like yours. There are economic reasons to use fake followers to grow social influence and it makes sense that social networks are allowing it to happen for more data and advertising. Let me explain with some amateur game theory and shady club promoters…\n\n### The Influencer’s Dilemma\n\nImagine two Miami club promoters, Brett and Vegas, have 10,000 Instagram followers each and are competing for the attention of partygoers. Since their businesses strongly depend on social metrics, each of them would gain from having more followers than the other (+2) and would lose from having less (-2). Every day they must choose: **work hard attracting real followers the good old fashioned way –**or–** work hard *and* buy fake followers. **This is outlined in a payoff metric below. (Note: this is a highly simplified version of what actually happens; the payoff functions are more complex than this, but I think it serves its purpose as an example)\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*M2R_kDYWpFSblRTknksFDQ.jpeg)\n\nIf neither of them buys fake followers, they’re about as happy as before, with probably an equal amount of followers between them (1,1). Fake followers aren’t as valuable as real ones, but they’re cheaper social capital, especially if most users haven’t caught on yet. Both Vegas and Brett know that whoever starts buying fake followers first will have more followers and a higher perceived social status. At some point, Brett moves first and gets fake followers (-2, 2). From that point, every day that Troy doesn’t *also* start buying fake followers leaves him further behind, pressuring him to do the same now that the new average for promoters is slightly more than 10,000 followers. As Troy catches up, the norm continues to increase, pushing Brett to up his use as well. Before long, they’ll find themselves in an *equilibrium state of follower inflation*. This is like the classic [prisoner’s dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) where both players take a worse outcome in order to make sure they don’t get totally screwed. But this case is a multi-round game, meaning influencers have to make this decision daily and may lag further behind, increasing their losses and the overall effect.\n\nYou can imagine this at a massive scale:\n\nOne influencer buys fake followers → the average follower count goes up → other influencers need to buy to catch up → count increases again → more influencers buy more fake followers → and so on. Before you know it, anything less than a million followers is just not important enough.\n\n( To clarify, “fake” here can mean any of the malicious ways one can acquire social capital, not necessarily buying followers. This is just one example. Also, this doesn’t apply solely to ‘followers’, but can be *likes, comments, streams, votes, shares, retweets, etc.*).\n\nIf nothing is done to make it harder to create fake activity or easier to spot it, this inflation continues to drive out good social capital and quality content, which becomes increasingly less worth spending time on. No one wants to spend 3 hours crafting a great story to gain 100 users when the new average is 1 million. **So the influencer’s dilemma is between 1: being ‘honest’ while risking falling behind and 2: debasing everyone’s social capital (including their own) to get ahead. **If they play out the game in their minds, buying fake followers as soon as possible seems like the only logical choice.\n\n#### Why don’t companies do something?\n\nYou could imagine that Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and others have the tools at their disposal to stop or reduce fake behavior. They could hypothetically require legal IDs for every account, action, and engagement on their platform. They could check each image, one by one, to make sure they’re real before adding them to Instagram. This would make it much more difficult to spread fake content. Returning to the Ted Talk about wiretapping using Google Maps, the speaker explains how Google, after getting an earful from the secret service, increased their security restrictions for maps related activity. 4 weeks later, when the secret service wasn’t looking anymore, they lowered the standards once again to their previous level. Why?\n\n> This is because tech giants survive off data: to convince users to give them free data (restaurant reviews, service ratings, location pins), they need to make inputing data as easy as possible. This comes at the expense of security.\n\nSo Google wants to make sure that you continue giving your opinion on top restaurants in the area. For this, they sacrifice the ability to always protect you when you’re looking for a restaurant. It’s a delicate balance in some ways.\n\nAd-driven companies also benefit from the simple fact that there are more users on the platform due to fake activity. They sell user reach, and this increases their numbers. This is why they sometimes boast about reaching more millennials than actually [exist according to the census](https://mashable.com/2017/09/06/facebook-census-metrics/#.ILltJiro5qR).\n\nThe value of this social capital inflation for platforms depends on user sentiment: if we care, they’ll change it. When Facebook made [millions on fake news](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/russian-operatives-used-facebook-ads-to-exploit-divisions-over-black-political-activism-and-muslims/2017/09/25/4a011242-a21b-11e7-ade1-76d061d56efa_story.html?noredirect=on\\&utm_term=.d79045b2c954) and bots during the 2016 election, public outrage and the hearings pushed the company to increase its security investments. This, apparently, came at the [cost of profitability](https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/01/technology/business/facebook-earnings/index.html). While I commend Zuck for taking this seriously, in some ways, it’s interesting that their business model is somewhat misaligned with the security of users.\n\n### Wikipedia\n\nIronically, Wikipedia seems to be the only large-scale network to overcome these challenges. While there are some sellers around, there is [no real market for artificially manipulating](https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/08/22/dont-pay-for-wikipedia-articles/) Wikipedia articles or commissioning them. Wikipedia’s decentralized governance does an excellent job censoring this behavior. The reality is though, Wikipedia did not achieve this by eliminating the quest for social capital. Instead, it developed a series of checks and balances that awards capital to those deserving few. Wikipedia’s 150,000 word constitution is protected by rank and file, unpaid editors, who keep a watchful eye over the network. Disputes are discussed in open forums and a resolution must be reached since only one article for a particular topic can exist.\n\nWikipedia is built on the shared philosophical basis as democracy: since you can’t trust any single person, give the power to the masses. Wikipedia uses reputation to award social capital and punishments usually strip users of their reputation. One consideration as to why Wikipedia “works” is that the platform is non-profit. Wikipedia’s goal is not viewer engagement but rather truth and fact, elements that traditional platforms are willing to overlook in their pursuit of profit.\n\nAs we look for solutions to this social capital bubble, Wikipedia’s platform is one to model. The reality is that it’s not possible to eliminate social capital’s captivating charm. Instead, we must identify how to create platforms that award people influence fairly, based upon the real value they provide ([Forbes](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/03/why-wikipedia-works.html))([NY Mag](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/03/why-wikipedia-works.html)).\n\nWhen it comes to social capital today, its value is seriously corrupted. The world assigns the same value to digital social capital as physical social capital without recognizing that acquiring the former is much easier than the latter. People have not yet internalized that most forms of digital social capital is for sale. They don’t grasp how effortlessly people can manufacture likes, purchase followers, and artificially create popularity. They don’t understand that complicated algorithms and tailored weighting systems are boundless if they’re based on metrics that can be bought in minutes. And when this bubble pops, when people finally understand that all a follower count indicates is how cunning a person is, then we’ll be forced to turn elsewhere. We’ll have to develop systems that value *you* for your content, your ideas, your *value*, rather than for your artificial metrics. We’ll need a way that allows everyone to easily verify the veracity of social capital in a way that, for thousands of years, depended upon the presence of real live people.\n\n### Crypto?\n\nJust like with everything else, crypto is trying to solve some of these issues. Token economics allow for other means of reflecting online metrics. By measuring *staked* tokens rather than number of likes/reviews/etc., users are committing to the ‘truth’ or ‘value’ of some content, and there is an inherent scarcity in that action. In many cases, these tokens are at stake when making votes, so people are monetarily incentivized to do the right thing. We’ve seen a lot of support for this in the tech space but have yet to come across a product that truly handles the major concerns. Vitalik talks about this extensively in his [most recent piece](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/04/03/collusion.html). Most attempts have been flawed and susceptible to bribery, collusion, and plutocracy.\n\n#### Perfect misbehavior\n\nWhile some blockchain projects are attempting to solve these problems, the same behavior is ironically seeping into crypto metrics. Cryptocurrency exchanges are famous for faking their volume, pretending to have more users and money flowing through their platform. Analytics from [TIE](https://thetie.io/) show that many are faking [more than 99%](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13\\_L5V9elxQ3xps62BeYVyr_Wu-9vfyAyN5tGqLNoV9Y/edit#gid=582401092) of it.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1\\*mOIyn9xnfNbsvgwIp6N92g.png)\n\nThe same is occurring with on-chain performance. Sites like Da[ppRadar](http://dappradar.com/), [State of the dApps](http://stateofthedapps.com/), and [blocktivity](http://blocktivity.info/) measure and rank user activity on various blockchains based on how many daily and monthly active users as well as transaction volume they have. In an attempt to prove that they have more user activity than other applications or blockchains, many projects are faking activity on their network to reach the top spots on these sites, resembling the registries hacks we mentioned above. This is especially common on blockchains like TRON and EOS, where transaction fees don’t necessarily cost extra money. This makes faking a few thousand users quite cheap and very impactful in a nascent industry where billion-dollar projects still lack more than a few hundred real ones. In the crypto space, those who care about transparency have yet to find a better way to measure this.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1\\*hVUSkaGkOWF5pLZFouUwmw.png)\n\n### Conclusion: Shhh…\n\nSo if you’re reading this, don’t bother sharing it with your friends. It’s our dirty little secret for now that. It only works if no one else is aware. Every person we tried to tell about this was only interested in how they themselves could use it. So go buy followers. Buy fame. Buy popularity. It won’t last forever, but for pennies you can make yourself cooler today. Getting social capital has never been easier and yet, amazingly, it still holds as much value as ever. At least until everyone realizes.\n\n\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\__\\_\n", "timestamp": 1614660711, "digest": "SJS3SeSD2ep7CLqMrBPe8W8dwXnOyvd99B7re-oJTD0", "contributor": "0x30E838D51c61811d382962B4e0699715462DcdE1"}

Let's discuss this further.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_4f5b7f6c1657432a8747d08612665968~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.jpg)\n\n*Originally published on *[**Hacker Noon**](https://hackernoon.com/should-likes-exist-6fj9324d)\n\n**Should social metrics (such as “likes”) remain public on social media platforms? **There has recently been action by platforms such as Instagram to remove likes from the public eye, meaning only creators would see reactions to their content and no one else. This has been met with substantial support by the online community, but I'll draw on sociologist Goffman’s views on the performed self and Sherry Turkle’s points on authenticity to argue that these metrics of social approval are vital to the sustainable cohesion of online societies. Public likes are critical in order to produce quality interactions between users. This is clear through the lens of sociologist Erving Goffman, who is well known for his arguments on social interactions in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, seeing every interaction as a performance with a stage, actors, and lines of sorts. For the sake of specificity, let us take Instagram as our ‘stage’, imagine the removal of public likes, and pay attention to two of Goffman’s specific points.\n\n### Signaling\n\nFirst, Goffman argues that a person’s identity is interactional, meaning, among other things, that they understand who they are by the cues they receive from others. This suggests that likes are important in signaling which performances are ‘good’ and which ones aren’t to the user. This importance is still somewhat satisfied under the removal of public likes, since the user can still see their received likes. But this brings up a question of relativity: what is a “good” amount of likes? If you can’t see anyone else’s like count, how can you be certain about the value of your own performance and adjust? In the ‘real world’, relativity is critical in weighing signal vehicles: making your grumpy grandpa laugh is a much larger feet than making your baby cousin laugh, because grandpa never laughs. If you’re a high school band, a 250-person turnout to your concert is great news because it would be above average for a band of your caliber, but if you’re a pop star, that same turnout would be quite embarrassing. The same applies for social media: on Facebook today, my content averages roughly 50% less likes than it did in 2015. This is mostly due to the fact that my friends don’t use Facebook anymore, which is apparent by the decrease in likes my peers receive on their content as well. If I had no idea that their content was receiving less likes, I’d take my decrease in likes as a cue that I am underperforming. Second, not only is this relative signaling important to the content creator themselves in valuing their performance, but it is vital to the viewers’ ability to do the same. Goffman explains that:\n\n> “when an individual enters the presence of others, they commonly seek to acquire information about him \\[...] They will be interested in his general socio-economic status, his conception of self, his attitude toward them, his competence, his trust-worthiness, etc.”\n\nUsers are interested because they need this information in order to know how to interact. The likes of others can very often validate a performer one knows nothing about. Performers know this, which is why they search for this validation even when it isn’t quite required.\n\n![](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/jYHmwdimS0i65ldBmNjw)\n\nReturning to Instagram, a perfect example of this behavior is the “New Post” content one sees all over Instagram “stories”. IG stories don’t have public social metrics (other users can’t see the like or view count of stories) but have become the primary way of communicating and consuming IG content, so users are now sharing their regular posts as stories in order to drive viewers/likers to their posts and boost their public metrics (see screenshot to left for example). These posts are often covered in GIFs or text (ex: TAP HERE) to force viewers to engage with the full post in order to see the photo. They could simply share the photo as a story instead of a post, reducing friction, but then they wouldn’t receive any public signaling. This example provides us with two clear insights: first, both creators and viewers benefit from this public signaling, and second, users will always find new ways to earn and display this signaling.\n\n### Authenticity\n\nIn addition to performance, a key function of public social metrics is to provide a metric of ‘authenticity’ in the digital age. In Authenticity in the age of digital companions, Turkle argues that “by the mid-90s, humans were not alone as emotional machines.” She also points to experiments where kids quickly treated robots as companions deserving of compassion despite being scientifically demystified. This type of interactions between bots and people will only increase over time, she suggests. But this extends beyond bots to ‘finstas’ (fake IG accounts) and group IG accounts, which represent a fundamental shift in the ‘roles’ online users take during interactions. In this sense, it becomes very difficult to properly attribute authenticity or inauthenticity to any one user. So as the lines between human vs. robot, person vs. group, as well as person vs. themselves begin to fade, what does ‘authenticity’ really mean? For me, it’s about social value. A username or identity is only as ‘real’ as we allow it to be. If it matters to us as a society, it is in fact authentic, whether or not it has a heart, four hearts, an XY chromosome, or CPU. For example, Satoshi Nakamoto is the still-secret pseudonym used for the creator(s) of Bitcoin. Today, it doesn’t really matter who Satoshi Nakamoto is/was, but what they represent and what kind of social capital their identity holds. The only information known about Satoshi is their digital footprint and social approval, and so that becomes their identity, the role they play, and the context in which one would interact with him/her/them. If Satoshi was found to be a robot, it would not change their impact and previous interactions. So, if social value is crucial in determining authenticity in the digital age, users have the right to every signal of social value possible in order to perform correctly, including likes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile public metrics of social approval are not the only way to attribute this form of social capital to an identity, it is a very important one, so the removal of those metrics is to the detriment of the establishment of internet identities. The obscuring of relative signaling by removing public likes can be massively harmful to the structure of the society because it takes this information (and therefore power) away from the viewers.\n\n*Cover Photo Credit: *[*Business of Fashion*](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/influencer-marketing-fraud-buying-followers)\n", "timestamp": 1614660946, "digest": "S94Y9NCcY67vnZvc-W4EV28RArgPH3WwsQQPCi263FA", "contributor": "0x30E838D51c61811d382962B4e0699715462DcdE1"}

However, distributed social consensus on the web has remained highly regarded but rarely understood. It has not been valued based on determinant incentives and, as a consequence, remains widely misrepresented and opaque. Online engagement metrics such as reach and follower counts attempt to attach numbers to this force, but measure with regard to quantity rather than quality, making them easily manipulable and highly untrustworthy. These metrics fail to accurately capture social capital, leaving social networks highly vulnerable to weak governance, sybil identities, and the spread of disinformation, harming digital communities and trust. Under this system, users have little economic incentive to express their opinion on content and one another genuinely, and their opinions are weighted evenly regardless of their own social capital. As our online presence consumes most of our daily lives, our society will be defined by our ability to solve these new social problems on the internet. In our eyes, the quest for online social consensus is a continuous quest for a better humanity in the digital age.\n\nRecently, due to technological improvements to distributed systems and cryptography, the world’s social media leaders have begun to imagine similar designs enabled by blockchain tech. Industry titans such as Jack Dorsey (Twitter) and Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) have started research and development towards these exact ends. On the crypto-economic side of these developments, new innovators have emerged who are attempting to tackle problems around collective decision-making and DAO-based identity systems. Thought leaders in this field have realized that a better method of allocating the value accrued on online platforms is needed and could be achieved by incentivizing participants at every scale for their online actions, directly monetizing the content they create, rate, or proliferate.\n\nIn tandem to issues surrounding online social capital, the current centralization of most networks entitles operators to rent-seek and sway user behavior, all while hoarding user data that could provide an enhanced experience and new streams of income for individuals.\n\nIn an attempt to solve these pitfalls of the web, a group of students at Columbia University built [*Yup*](http://yup.io/?utm=blog), a protocol that facilitates the distribution, measurement, and governance of online social capital in a pseudonymous yet transparent opinion-based economy. That’s a technical way of saying that ***Yup is respect*** –a movement to represent, reward, and empower respect across the internet, with content primed to earn users’ approval, not attention.\n\nYup offers a fair weighting of opinions, a single universal reputation/identity that can be used on all sites without competing with existing business models, a native and scarce asset to facilitate monetization or attention markets, and an immutable record of reviews and reputations. Let us explore the shortcomings in existing centralized and decentralized systems, point to promising solutions, and propose a new protocol governed by social capital.\n\n## Identity\n\n### Identity in the Digital Realm\n\nWhat does it mean to be a valuable user online? Is this reserved for individual humans? Must they be legally recognized? In [**Authenticity in the Age of Digital Companions**](http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/pdfsforstwebpage/ST_Authenticity%20in%20age%20of%20digi%20comp.pdf), famed sociologist Sherry Turkle argues that “by the mid-90s, humans were not alone as emotional machines.” She also points to experiments where kids quickly treated robots as companions deserving of compassion despite being scientifically demystified. This type of interactions between bots and people will only increase over time, she suggests.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_567ed6bd2a4440ff963316b9940b550b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nOne of our favorite Instagram users, [*@lilmiquela*](https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/), isn’t real in the *human* sense. But that hasn’t stopped her from becoming a superstar. Miquela is a self-described robot led by the Sequoia-backed media company [***Brud***](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V5N5tcfm7wBuUshgrmIOz9ijAO-VRqvkUbGRu0uKdI8/edit)**.** She’s cleverly placed alongside “real” people to appear life-like. This [*Gorillaz*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnrEEoVOUlE)-esque approach to identity is starting to catch on, as more and more Miquela wannabes sprout up.\n\n[***Block.One***](https://block.one/)**,** the blockchain development company behind EOS and Steem, have a new decentralized social media project called [***Voice***](https://voice.com/) that they announced last summer. The Voice project seems to take a different angle at this identity issue, opting to essentially require every sign up to legally identify themselves with documents such as a driver’s license or passport. Dan Larimer and others at B1 cite responsibility as their reason, wishing to hold users accountable for their interactions. It remains to be seen as how Voice plans on decentralizing this process over time, to make sure that their network doesn’t remain inherently permissioned. Identity DAOs like [***Humanity DAO***](https://www.humanitydao.org/) and [***Democracy Earth***](https://democracy.earth/) have tried to crowd-source identity, building economic incentives around the recognition of humans via incentive mechanisms that resemble universal basic income. *But both of these approaches lack the proper room for the lil’ Miquelas of the world.* The social networks of the future will still need to account for individuals, groups, teams, companies, communities, or even algorithms being represented by a single identity. A protocol shouldn’t by design limit users to one account tied to their real identity –furthermore, accounts shouldn’t be limited to one person or even a human.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_210b96020670486098e4899e9ef2ce63~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nIn a different piece from 2008, Sherry Turkle [*argues*](http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/pdfsforstwebpage/Turkle_how_computers_change_way_we_think.pdf) that “Online worlds can provide valuable spaces for identity play.” This is clearly seen by the emergence of ‘finstas’ (fake IG accounts) and group IG accounts, which represent a fundamental shift in the ‘roles’ online users take during interactions. In this sense, it becomes very difficult to properly attribute authenticity or inauthenticity to any one user. So as the lines between human vs. robot, person vs. group, as well as person vs. themselves begin to fade, what does ‘authenticity’ really mean?\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_4ac0f95ba10a412abf0b7b11dc813ca9~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nIt’s all about social value. A username or identity is only as ‘real’ as we allow it to be. If it matters to us as a society, it is in fact authentic, whether or not it owns a heart, four hearts, an XY chromosome, or CPU. For example, Satoshi Nakamoto is the still-secret pseudonym used for the creator(s) of Bitcoin. Yet today, it doesn’t really matter who Satoshi Nakamoto is/was, but what they represent and what kind of social capital their identity holds. The only information known about Satoshi is their digital footprint and social approval, and so that becomes their identity, the role they play, and the context in which one would interact with him/her/them. If Satoshi was found to be a robot, it would not change the power and reputation of their identity. Nothing but a private key signature would be necessary for them to take advantage of all of that built up social capital. So, if social value is crucial in determining identity online, humans need signal vehicles to properly perform in this new environment.\n\n### Data Autonomy\n\nFor the majority of web2 online platforms, user data has been a relatively zero-sum game. Every platform is incentivized to hoard data, hurting the user’s experience. For example, when you log in to Tinder via Facebook OAuth, Facebook Inc. is choosing what to share with Tinder and what not to share. While FB may permit you to allow Tinder to know some information, it hides the majority of your data and metadata because it’s extremely valuable and diminishes in value as access increases. This is despite the fact that this data could enable Tinder to provide you with a better experience. You as a user have no real say in this matter and, as a result, are the biggest loser from this zero-sum game. Since its inception, the world wide web has lacked solutions to this equilibrium, but distributed ledger technology has given rise to new projects and products aiming to disrupt this existing data competition and give users real ownership over their data. Sir Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the world wide web, has been working on a new project titled [***Solid***](https://solid.inrupt.com/) that’s focused around solving this problem. By way of the Solid “POD”, a storage locker controlled by private keys with different permissions, users can decide where to store their data. Since users have immutable ownership over their data, they’re free to move it at any time, choosing who has access to it without interruption of service. In order to write data as well as to read it, and to protect privacy, it is important to control who has access to what. In Solid’s case this is managed using the web access control list specification and the WebID Identity spec.\n\nOther teams are building similar products. [***OrbitDB***](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db), for example, tries to achieve similar peer-to-peer database capabilities, functioning as a serverless and peer-to-peer storage locker built on IPFS data storage and Pubsub. [***3Box***](https://3box.io/) is building a comparable framework for Ethereum applications. Smart contract platform [***Blockstack***](https://blockstack.org/) has prioritized these features, adding OAuth log-in and data locker capabilities to its base layer protocol. By way of a universal identity layer, Yup is providing similar functionality users, focusing on qualitative metadata as user’s most lucrative asset.\n\n## Attention\n\nOnline attention is a key ingredient in harvesting influence. Several entities have capitalized on this notion, quickly trading it as a commodity of product sales and branding. Additionally, it gave power and voice to advocacy. Most social media platforms remain economically efficient through the resale of what attention it could capture in exchange for its \\`free' content.\n\nContent creators in top social media platforms have little direct way to monetize their fans’ attention or get a share of ad revenue. In response, they have resorted to grossly ineffective workarounds. This resulted in an economy that disproportionately rewards a handful of centralized social media companies instead of the content creators that give such platforms value. Members of thriving online communities that exist on popular social media platforms currently have no control in the developments of the sites they helped grow; the length and extent of their engagement is undermined. Additionally, there is no direct relationship between the demand of users and sponsored content/monetization. This stunts influencers’ ability to build user loyalty around an account or channel. There are no real incentives to support quality content and discourage poor behavior.\n\nUpon examining the makeup of existing centralized social networks, we conclude that social capital is misrepresented and easily purchased, and the monetization of attention is one sided or separate from the network itself. Yup prioritizes respect instead of attention whereby the user is the customer, not the product. Our focus isn’t on growing engagement but rather curating content that people actually enjoy.\n\n### The Monetization of Attention\n\nThere are a handful of distributed ledgers, platforms, and applications being built to decentralize social networks and advertising. **Steem**, a decentralized social network blockchain, mints new tokens and rewards content creators for their virality. In order to mitigate sybil attacks, the Steem network must have certain barriers on account creation that hurts onboarding and thus the community at large. This is quite inefficient and counts on user error to bouey the price of STEEM, giving a strong advantage to profit-driven automated users.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_520507ed2fa74273ab1d424146ac290c~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_300,h\\_300,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nSimilarly, Voting bots plague the Steem network to such an extent that the community accepts them as a part of their ecosystem. Users can pay bots to curate their content or to vote on their behalf for rewards. Users can earn more tokens by proxy-staking to bots than by actually participating in the network. As a result, users are now incentivized to be less engaged and simply proxy-stake their holdings to maximize returns. This new form of advertising accepted by many protocol communities has additional issues including the lack of strong incentives to support channels and accounts, the direct relationship between token holdings and influence on the network which ignores user activity or length of involvement, unannounced shutdowns of the blockchain for updates, and rampant misinformation.\n\nNew models with similar designs have risen in the last few years. Originally built on the Steem blockchain, ***DLive***, an up-and-coming project that has partnered with celebrities like [*PewDiePie*](https://www.newsweek.com/dlive-pewdiepie-stream-schedule-app-youtube-1390512), began to gain traction in spring of 2019. It transitioned from Steem to **Lino**, a blockchain that similarly rewards content creators and curators through an inflation-based rewards system but includes donation (see Tipping section below). One of the key incentives for DLive’s chain transition must be because of Lino promising 70% of token rewards to apps and developers directly. Creators and curators of content, on the other hand, are expected to make most of their money from donations. Unfortunately, this may hurt Lino in the long run as ecosystems and communities become too siloed to reflect that type of rewards system. This already seems to be the case with Tron supposedly [*acquiring DLive*](https://cryptobriefing.com/tron-acquires-dlive-blockchain-streaming-platform/) in late December ‘19 and looking to transition the app away from Lino and to its own blockchain. Furthermore, the Lino blockchain [*defines reputation solely by money spent*](https://link.lino.network/whitepaper), leading to plutocracies and inaccurate reputation schemes.\n\n### Advertising\n\n**Marketplaces**\n\nAdvertisement is currently the primary form of online content monetization, often considered the ‘[*original sin*](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/)’ of the internet. While most of us hate ads, our favorite sites and platforms wouldn’t exist without them. However, it’d be nice we as users received a piece of this ad revenue both for contributing content for engaging with ads. Brave, the company that maintains the Basic Attention Token (BAT), has tried to compete with Google Ads on this front, building their own protocol and browser that pays users for viewing ads and allows them to tip sites they visit, the age old way of economizing content. However, they similarly fail to attribute value to social capital, measuring ad views equally for every individual despite their potential greater importance for ads – a billionaire and I stand to make the same money on Brave despite them being in much higher demand in terms of advertising. Tipping usually refers to the feature allowing consumers to send money to a creator. There are great mainstream and crypto examples of tipping, including YouTube, [***Patreon***](http://patreon.com/)**, **[***Cent***](http://cent.co/)**, **[***Peepeth***](https://peepeth.com/), and [***Tippin.Me**.*](http://tippin.me/)\n\n**Censorship**\n\nEvery social platform must deal with the well-documented tension between censorship and free speech. If censorship is too limited, inappropriate and sensationalist content surfaces super quick. If censorship is too liberally used, speech suppression is inevitable. This would lead to family-friendly communities on one side of the spectrum and censorship-resistant ‘explicit’ ones on the other side. A good example of this is [***Gab***](https://gab.com/), a social network that prioritizes low censorship. Today, Gab has a reputation of being a hotbed for white supremacists and other questionable actors. Finding a goldilocks middle ground between the two is incredibly difficult and requires distributed consensus. The community at large will always know what’s better for the network than the headquarters of a centralized entity, but they will be much slower and more inefficient in executing that vision.\n\nOne of the big advantages of decentralized social networks is that they’re often more censorship-resistant. One project that aims to leverage this advantage is [***AKASHA***](https://akasha.world/)**,** which stands for 'Advanced Knowledge Architecture for Social Human Advocacy'. AKASHA (2015) is an Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized social media platform that is embedded into the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS). The Akasha decentralized social media platform is built to ensure the platform is resistant against censorship and be unable to be taken offline because it does not have any one central point of failure or lack of bandwidth issues.\n\n## Opinions & Social Capital\n\nThe opinions of others are vital to the Internet economy; it is the core component upon which value metrics are built. This is most clear in online product/service reviews. A highly-cited [*Harvard Business School study *](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=41233)from 2011 estimated that a one-star rating increase on Yelp translated to an increase of 5% to 9% in revenues for a restaurant. [*Cornell researchers*](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-announces-settlement-machinima-and-three-other-companies-false) found that a one-star change in a hotel’s online ratings on sites like Travelocity and TripAdvisor is tied to an 11% sway in room rates, on average.\n\nThe internet’s peer-to-peer nature is a huge reason for this, as opinions have become more accessible. Average user rating has become a huge driver of sales, and now, user-generated ratings and narrative reviews can be found on almost every website that sells something.\n\nThe results of a 2017 study by Podium show that 93% of American consumers say that online reviews have an impact on their purchasing decisions. 91% of 18-34 year old consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Star rating currently is the number one factor used by users to judge businesses.\n\nHowever, treating these social metrics as highly accurate does not necessarily make them so. University of Colorado Boulder professors Langhe, Fernbach, and Lichtenstein investigated the actual and perceived validity of online user ratings and found a \"substantial disconnect between the objective quality information that online user ratings actually convey and the extent to which consumers trust them as indicators of objective quality.\" They analyzed 344,157 Amazon ratings of 1,272 products in 120 product categories and compared them to ratings on Consumer Reports as well as resale value. They conclude that average user ratings correlate poorly with* Consumer Report *scores, and, while *Consumer Reports *correctly predict resale value, user ratings do not. This is because:\n\n\\- When reviewers are vetted and paid to review products (as is the case in Consumer Reports), their opinions are usually a stronger indication of quality.\n\n\\- Without a mechanism to ensure this, reviews lose their meaning.\n\nAdditionally, Langhe et al. argue that \"consumers fail to consider these issues appropriately when forming quality inferences from user ratings and other observable cues. They place enormous weight on the average user rating as an indicator of objective quality compared to other cues. They also fail to moderate their reliance on the average user rating when sample size is insufficient.\" In other words, the average user lacks both the data and know-how to make accurate inferences on the quality of products based on user ratings.\n\nDespite both the high value attributed to user opinion and the importance of monetizing it for accurate representation of quality, our own research suggests that less than 0.001% of online opinion is monetized today. Without any incentive to review honestly, users tend to express negative reviews more often and more extremely, with little to no reason to contribute positive reviews. This lack of monetization also tips the balance for malicious actors looking to manipulate their perceived quality: the incentives to create a false opinion for money from a malicious actor outweigh those to review honestly. Fakespot, a ratings analytics tool, [estimates](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buyer-beware-a-scourge-of-fake-online-reviews-is-hitting-amazon-walmart-and-other-major-retailers/) that 52 percent of Walmart reviews and 30 percent of Amazon reviews are fake or unreliable.\n\n### Misaligned Incentives\n\nThere remains a fundamental misalignment between the incentives of the platform and its users in terms of user inputted opinions. The platforms gain from the influx of data, and do everything they can to ensure that this input of data is smooth, regardless of accuracy. Users have no incentive to review accurately and therefore act based on external interests. Crucially, this whole system is flawed because it functions independently of real monetization for all parties involved.\n\n**So why would people give honest opinions without any incentive? **This is why we witness 21% more negative reviews than positive ones; with no other incentives involved, anger/frustration seems to be the driving incentive for negative reviews. Yup is designed to solve this problem by financially incentivizing accurate opinions with monetary rewards. Limiting the number of actions a user can do is also important in order to establish scarcity.\n\n> *“More people are depending on reviews for what to buy and where to go, so the incentives for faking are getting bigger… **It’s a very cheap way of marketing.\"***- Bing Liu, Professor at University of Illinois\n\nIn the internet age, reviews have very much become a form of marketing and has evolved into an enormous business: [reputation management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_management). Companies need reputations, and reputations come from people, unless you can buy them for cheaper than an ad campaign.\n\n**The Consequences of Access**\n\nWe expect that changes in* access *that occurred as a result of the rise of the internet had a significant effect on the trust in and accuracy of opinions. Access in this case refers to both the ability for anyone to rate products/ services/ content and the ease at which one can see more ratings online.\n\nWhen online review forums first emerged, they provided increasingly accurate opinions because of the “[wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)” effect taking hold. In James Surowiecki’s *The Wisdom of Crowds*, the famed journalist talks about bad intuitions around individual vs. group decision-making. These initial communities were small, and natural reputation effects among members existed because many knew each other by name. As misconceptions about the internet dissipated, trust in these reviews grew because they were in fact more accurate. But as access continued to increase and platforms changed, the natural reputation effects shrunk. This decreased the reputation at stake for each user and allowed for fake reviews to thrive, reducing accuracy significantly. Now, there is still a correlation between accuracy and trust; more accuracy leads to more trust, BUT more trust doesn’t necessarily lead to more accuracy. In fact, the more trust users have in online reviews the more worthwhile they are to fake/manipulate, creating a harmful equilibrium: **more accuracy → more trust → less accuracy → less trust → more accuracy … **I talk about this further in my piece [*“Opinion Economy”*](https://www.blog.yup.io/post/the-opinion-economy).\n\nWhile public metrics of social approval are not the only way to attribute this form of social capital to an identity, it is a very important one, so the removal of those metrics is to the detriment of the establishment of internet identities. The obscuring of relative signaling by removing public likes, like Instagram plans on doing, can be massively harmful to the structure of the society because it takes this information (and therefore power) away from the viewers.\n\n**Experts**\n\n*The notion that all opinions are created equal online is a large reason for the inaccuracy of opinions.*\n\nPeople like to trust brands and institutions as experts on a certain subject. In reality, however, they rarely are the experts we expect them to be. This is first because finding experts is a skill of its own, which can be flawed and time-consuming. As there are more sources, statistics, data points, and faux expertise, it becomes increasingly difficult to spot experts. Surowiecki expands on this point: “The problem is that even if these superior beings, do exist, there is no easy way to identify them.” This is also true for the experts themselves, who also may not be aware that they are experts. In fact, those within a crowd that project themselves as experts rarely are.\n\nClaiming individual humans know less than they’ve ever known, Yuval Noah Harari breaks down the impact of power and technology on our individual knowledge in his book [**21 Lessons for the 21st Century**](https://philosophiatopics.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/yuval-noah-harari-21-lessons-for-the-21st-century.pdf). He explains that humans are even less aware of their cognitive blindspots today than ever before. Because Google gives us an answer to any question, we think we’re experts and have a difficult time identifying our skills and shortcomings.\n\n[***Roll***](http://tryroll.com/) seeks to tokenize influencers, aligning curators with the specific growth of creators and influencers rather than that of the network. The financial success of curators in this case is determined by the speculative trading of influencer assets. This has serious problems in enforcement but projects some key insights about influence online. This is a way to determine experts, but not in their original form, but wholly in influence, expertise, and attention.\n\nYup attempts to prioritize reputation-based social consensus over brands and institutions. When conceiving of Yup, we used advances in distributed systems to explore new ways to (1) improve the user’s ability to identify inaccuracies, (2) deter the manipulation/misuse of reviews, and (3) correctly weight reviewers’ expertise on certain topics, communities could reach a perfect correlation between changes in trust and accuracy. Yup utilizes layered social level consensus to build sustainable governance of its network and provide proper representation of network value. This orders participants by their recognized social level. Every address on the network will have a social level as a measurement of others’ opinions of them. Their individual social levels will be determined by all other addresses on the network.\n\n**Testimonials**\n\n**Testimonials **have long been an example of quality signal vehicles for identifying the quality or reputation of a product or service. People tend Recently, as expected, individuals have found ways to manipulate and mislead testimonials as well. The most humorous example of false testimonials that we’ve come across is the one highlighted by YouTuber Coffeezilla in his [*Fake Guru video on Sam Ovens*](https://youtu.be/ez8yKklc1lE?t=150) (‘fake gurus’ are defined as online personalities that falsely sell themselves as business gurus). In this hilarious video, Coffeezilla discovers that Sam Ovens’ top testimonial, Dave Rogenmoser, actually had been making seemingly fake testimonials for dozens of ‘fake gurus’ during a 2 year span and may have been a fake guru himself. This epitomizes both the weight viewers give to online testimonials and their potential for misuse and manipulation.\n\n**Attempts at Reputation**\n\nSites whose main function is reviews have taken stronger actions to represent reputation in opinions. **Yelp** attempts to show a user’s reputation by reflecting the votes others have given on their reviews (as well as some other stats). The advantage of this portrayal of reputation is that it allows users to vet reviewers as ‘legitimate,’ mostly negative or positive in their reviews, or as having tendencies to act a certain way. The main problem with these metrics is that they don’t provide information or expertise; if a user is funny, how does that make them a better reviewer of bars? Sure, if you dig deep enough, you can start to infer certain things like that a reviewer’s past opinions on car mechanics may be strongly supported by the community or that their reviews on hardware stores are thought to be useless. But the search costs for doing this for every reviewer are far too high right now.\n\nLastly, this representation of reputation doesn’t affect the weighting of stars for a business. You could have a good rep on Yelp and still have the same influence over average ratings as any other user.\n\nBy making everyone equal, no one can be discovered as an expert. **What we must realize is that opinions aren’t democracies;** we shouldn’t all get an equal say as to the subjective quality of products, venues, or anything else for that matter. What we need is more of a meritocracy, because some of us have earned the right to speak on certain topics with authority, not necessarily through a college degree or an award but could simply be receiving the continued approval of the online community. This one-person-one-vote model just doesn’t make sense for diverse decision-making, because it doesn’t distribute accurate weight to the expertise of various participants.\n\n**Scarcity and Stake**\n\nStrong opinion models should provide major incentives for accurate reviews. If users were rewarded (monetarily or otherwise) for reviewing things, they’d take the time to make better decisions. One way of doing this is by P2P validation, meaning that if other users agree with a user’s opinion, either by upvoting their opinion or by submitting a similar review, that user should get rewarded. Yup identifies content and distributes rewards according to the value (influence) of the opinions associated with that content. In this case, we define *content* as any specific data online that user(s) deem worth judging, including but not limited to texts, images, videos, locations, accounts, and links. The influence metric is a function of engagement, ownership over time, and reputation. In Yup’s case, the final important piece here is scarcity: users should have a limited amount of reviews that they can give within a set amount of time. If users stand to gain or lose from their reviews, and they can only give their opinion x times a day, they’re less likely to abuse or waste these reviews.\n\nOn the opposite side of incentive is deterrence; users should be deterred from submitting inaccurate reviews. This could be enacted in a similar fashion, whereby users lose something for giving bad reviews that no one agrees with or supports. With Yup, this comes in the opportunity cost of giving an opinion elsewhere, where users may miss the opportunity to see returns if they vote inaccurately.\n\nSimilar concepts has been attempted in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space with the *Token Curated Registries*: lists of similar products/content/etc. that are curated by staking cryptocoins. This can be perceived as ‘betting’ that a product will be liked by others and they’ll also vote for it. If others also bet on it, you receive a token reward, if no one does, you lose your stake. In many of those systems, earning tokens and purchasing tokens holds the same value, despite there being no evidence that this is the right way to represent network participation.\n\n## Governance\n\nIn *Culture and Power: The Sociology of Pierre Bourdieu*, David Swartz begins with “Culture provides the very grounds for human communication and interaction; it is also a source of domination.” The same could be stated about the online behemoths that presently host our culture. While traditional social networks have expanded the size and function of communication, marketing, and organization, their monopolistic increase in internet market power has drawn a wide divide in incentives between their services and their user base. While there are forces that compel large networks to comply to certain restrictions, the implications of the extent of their hold over human behavior is concerning. For example, in 2010, Facebook ran [*a stealth experiment*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22972300) on 61,000,000 American accounts during the US congressional elections to see how small messages (banners above the news feed) could affect user’s voter turnout and more. They argue: “The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking, and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users’ friends, and friends of friends.”\n\nTheir results suggest that “Facebook social message increased turnout directly by about 60,000 voters and indirectly through social contagion by another 280,000 voters.” That 340,000 total represents about 0.14% of the country’s voting age population in 2010. For context, George Bush beat Al Gore in Florida by 537 votes in 2000. If a similar tight race occurred today, it wouldn’t be hyperbole to assume that Facebook could alter the political landscape of the United States with their [*4x user growth*](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/) and multi-billion dollar acquisitions since 2010.\n\nFacebook ran the voting experiment in 2010 but only made the results public in 2012 under their free will. If they had maliciously kept this study internal, the U.S. public and government may not have ever been aware. Second, because of Facebook’s immense network effects, the Cambridge Analytica data breach had little to no impact on its market dominance. Despite exposing over 80 million users’ information to third parties, resulting in trust in Facebook falling by over 50% in the following weeks, daily active users, minutes of usage, and advertising revenue all increased. This suggests that not only can giant social networks hide their manipulation, but also that average users are too network-dependent for their sentiment to be notably reflected in Facebook’s economics. Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes makes this same argument, arguing for the breaking up of Facebook into smaller companies in his famous *New York Times* piece “[*It’s Time to Break Up Facebook*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html)”. He writes that “Mark’s influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government.” At the helm of FB, Instagram, and WhatsApp, he argues that Zuckerberg has too much control. Despite being a publicly traded company, “Facebook’s board works more like an advisory committee than an overseer, because Mark controls around 60 percent of voting shares,” he writes. “Mark alone can decide how to configure Facebook’s algorithms to determine what people see in their News Feeds, what privacy settings they can use and even which messages get delivered. He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent and incendiary speech from the merely offensive, and he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it.”\n\n**Decentralization**\n\nThe benefits of decentralization have been highlighted thus far in this piece. However, decentralized protocols present their own issues such as bribing, collusion, and tragedy of the commons. Just like in their centralized counterparts, if a positive rating is worth more to a marketer than the money lost in achieving that rating on one of these platforms, they’ll surely try to manipulate it. This is entirely possible considering that users will probably not stake too much on one individual rating, especially if there aren’t that many participants. Except now, policing this must be governed democratically, making it more difficult at times. We all have heard of the [*PTSD that some Facebook moderators*](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa) have received from doing this kind of work…\n\n### First Layer Governance\n\nAt the consensus layer, there are several inefficiencies that can be improved upon with social capital. Nakamoto consensus uses proof-of-work to cleanly solve several issues in majority decision making, abandoning the notion of “one-IP-one-vote” for “one-CPU-one-vote”. However, one problem that arises as a result is the power ascribed to outsourced physical capital. Participants can gain more influence over the network by purchasing computational power with money from other economic systems. This means that the relationship between capital spent to maintain the network and the capital earned for doing so is not quite internal: 1 kW of electricity purchased with USD has equal power over the Bitcoin network as 1 kW purchased with BTC. PoS and DPoS mechanisms improve on this problem by requiring miners to stake network tokens to participate in consensus (‘one-token-one-vote’). Yet, it still does not properly reflect network participation: staking 1 network token that was purchased on an exchange provides the same mining power as 1 network token earned via mining. This dependence on physical capital makes networks susceptible to byzantine behavior from capital-rich outside parties as well as hinders the most-mover-advantages of participating in consensus. The ability to transparently quantify and represent social capital can provide stronger models for decentralized systems. Governed by an influence metric, the Yup protocol aggregates reputations, distributes opinion-based rewards, and facilitates fair ad exchange, resulting in clear, transparent consensus around social capital. It uses social level consensus to bring about anonymous P2P review and a money-resistant reputation scheme. This can be extremely helpful in solving some of the issues around protocol governance, particularly PoS and DAOs.\n\n## The Overweb, A Platform Agnostic Future\n\nBecause of the data silos laid out in the previous sections above, it may be likely that the open social protocol of the future will be platform agnostic and have overweb capabilities. Overweb is a term coined to describe software that is used to enhance one’s experience across the web rather than on one specific site or platform. The notion of platform-agnostic protocols is very well described by Mike Masnick in his piece \"[*Protocols, not Platforms*](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech)\".\n\n[***Klout***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klout) may be a great social example of overweb. Klout was a website and mobile app launched in 2008 that used social media analytics to rate its users according to online social influence via the \"Klout Score\". In determining the user score, Klout measured the size of a user's social media network and correlated the content created to measure how other users interact with that content.\n\nKlout used Bing, Facebook, Foursquare, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, and Wikipedia data to create Klout user profiles that were assigned a unique \"Klout Score\". Ultimately, Lithium Technologies, who acquired the site in 2014, closed the service in 2018. The largest reason for Klout’s failure, we propose, it’s lack of access to proprietary data of individual users on these other platforms. When Yup is attempting to aggregate influence across the web in this similar way, it is crucial that it exist atop a decentralized protocol such as the Yup protocol. Otherwise, it would quickly become difficult to integrate with any other site.\n\n### Status at Stake\n\nIn a platform where opinions are perfectly weighted and distributed, reviews would be more accurate. Investment in malicious marketing would be deterred. The distortion of customer reviews would be difficult. Cash would flow towards improving product quality + retaining users, rather than used to bolster the fraudulent image of a popular, well-liked company. However, accomplishing this in a fair and peer-to-peer manner is difficult without some decentralized consensus, which we’ll discuss below.\n\n## Data Legibility\n\n> *\"Those who cannot perceive the network cannot act effectively within it, and are powerless.\" - *[James Bridle](http://booktwo.org/notebook/drone-shadows/)\n\nPeople often talk about data transparency, but what about [data legibility](https://medium.com/doteveryone/data-legibility-and-a-common-language-coping-not-coding-part-2-8afb687de60)? Even if users have access to enough data on particular products, services, or the reviewers of them, rarely is that information fully comprehensible by the average user. The easier data is to understand and leverage to make better decisions, the more difficult it becomes to manipulate opinions and ratings. For example, review site Yelp could easily determine a score for a reviewer in different categories of rating. Reviewers could theoretically be given a high score for their reviews on mechanics while a low score for their reviews on bars, and have this be shown to the users directly from the venue page where the review was. By doing this, sites like Yelp can put more power into the hands of the users with the same data that is currently displayed on them.\n\n## Concerns & Liabilities\n\nIt’s important to consider ethical externalities and relevant responsibilities that a social protocol takes on. This is of extremely high priority for us at Yup. In the process of building, we're paying very close attention to these concerns. That being said, we feel that some of people's discomfort with our propositions are misguided and are worth discussing.\n\n### The Stigma of Social Scores\n\nSome initial users of our beta have stated that the implications of a reputation score lends a discomfort reminiscent of Black Mirror’s “Nosedive.” Some of the terminology that we use at Yup, such as “social value” or “influence” concerns people. [*Some writers*](https://bwog.com/2019/10/an-explanation-of-those-colored-underlines-around-campus/) have even stated that “the extension itself contains some indelibly frosty sense of robotic apathy, rendered void of human subtlety and liveliness.” What we hope people will come to understand is that Black Mirror is already the status quo, our social value is already objectified by social media companies that maintain their own internal rankings and assessments based on our online interactions. The problem is that we don't have access to the data and social value metrics that existing social media sites aggregate about us, users are disenfranchised in the status quo.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUltimately, a new social consensus protocol needs to sufficiently encompass many of these solutions: opt-in data autonomy, overweb reputation layer, and more. Our goal as a team is to explore what this may look like from the eyes of prioritizing individual merit in the face of data-driven networks. We’re looking for other teams to collaborate with and grow together. We’re big believers in procedural justice, encouraging and empowering our initial community to take part in determining what is valued and prioritized on Yup.\n\nWe envision Yup as a protocol for an incentivized, distributed, and censorship-resistant social systems that provides trustless data rights. The potential use cases of the protocol are infinite, and we foresee Yup as a foundation for new and separate applications that benefit from its unique qualities.

Taking pseudonyms seriously means reconsidering the definition of souls and lives as we know them. If we can embody multiple lives, if we can co-own or pass them on to others, who are we? Who are those lives? Looking through the lens of Balaji’s lecture alongside sociological and philosophical work, we can come to understand that a pseudonymous identity can be a ‘self’ of its own that transcends and is distinct from the individual human ‘self’. This has massive implications for society’s understanding of identity.\n\n### **History of Pseudonyms**\n\nPseudonym, latin for “fake name”, is an identity that is unique in its name and reputation (unlike anonymity) but is not the legal/recognized name of an individual. Since the dawn of the written word, pseudonyms have been quite common. Writers were known to regularly use pseudonyms; George Eliot, Lewis Carroll, George Orwell, Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain), Stan Lee, and O.Henry are just a few famous examples. Balaji’s lectures on *Pseudonymous Economy* focus on digital anonymity, technically breaking down how a pseudonymous economy would function, with encrypted personal information and a lineage of attestations.\n\nSince the popularization of the internet, millions of humans interact pseudonymously every single day. Reddit, a pseudonymous social network, has over [*330 million monthly active users.*](https://foundationinc.co/lab/reddit-statistics/#:~:text=26.4%20Million%20Americans%20Use%20Reddit%20Monthly.,330%20Million%20Monthly%20Active%20Users) With the permanence of online information and the rise of cancel culture, many have chosen to use pseudonymous identities on sites and platforms like Twitter and Instagram. Famous individuals use these often: Mitt Romney’s pseudonymous Twitter account is [*“Pierre Delecto”*](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/10/mitt-romney-has-a-secret-twitter-account-and-it-sure-looks-like-its-this-one.html), who joined the platform in 2011. It’s likely that your teenage brother or nephew probably has a *finsta*, or fake Instagram account, where their real identity is hidden. Both of my parents have fake Twitter accounts too.\n\n### **Discreteness of Lives**\n\nWith a deep understanding of the prevalence of pseudonyms as well as their increased significance in our society and economy, one must reconsider the meaning of ‘self’ and ‘life’ in the philosophical sense. Where does one ‘life’ end and another begin? What constitutes a separate life and what is an extension of an existing one?\n\nPhilosopher John Locke was one of the first thinkers to deeply consider the problems of personal identity in his work *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding *in 1689. Assuming one is the same person as the person who existed last week or the person who was born many years ago, what fact makes this so? Locke was careful to distinguish the notion of sameness of person from the related notions of sameness of body and sameness of man, or human being. Locke suggests that sameness of body requires identity of matter, and sameness of human being depends on continuity of life; but sameness of person requires something else. Locke’s work is especially important to consider in regards to the digital age because he disentangles consciousness from the material, not equating mind and brain.\n\nIn his preface, Locke clarifies that this essay is not offered as a contribution to knowledge itself but as a means of clearing away some of the intellectual rubbish that stands in the way of knowledge. While many would disagree with this description, it is important in the context of this discussion in that Locke’s arguments should be considered within the frame of human knowledge during his time. An attempt to fit his arguments to modern civilization certainly comes with complications that are worth noting, but it does not negate the absolute truths within them.\n\nLocke’s proposal was that personal identity consists of continuity of consciousness (memory from the five senses, particularly sight), and not on the substance of either the soul or the body. In other words, among other points, Lock argues that the self is not discrete but rather continuous. One is the same person as the person who existed last week or many years ago if one has memories of the earlier person’s conscious experiences. Just as the human body is continuous –from limb to torso to head– so is the self. Given that in the digital world memory can be stored, shared, copied, or experienced in discrete times, Locke’s theories would suggest that multiple people can co-inhabit one ‘self’.\n\nLet us take a shared Instagram account as an example: two best friends Bob and Joe have a shared Instagram user profile for photos of pizza under the pseudonym *pizzaboy*. Given a total record of pizzaboy’s engagements are stored and accessible by the two friends, both of them can experience the existence of the IG account to the fullest extent and both can act as the IG account to the fullest extent. For these reasons, we may suggest that pizzaboy is a ‘self’. Additionally, neither Joe nor pizzaboy can be considered a continuation of Bob (in the Lockian sense) because they did not experience his consciousness separate from those experienced through pizzaboy. Similarly, neither Bob nor pizzaboy can be considered a continuation of Joe. Can we then argue that pizzaboy is a self in and of itself, continuous only to the consciousness felt by it? pizzaboy is not quite Bob and not quite Joe but is still a self.\n\nIt is not the case that all shared pseudonyms retain the distinct composition of self. For example, the organization *Anonymous* is a sort of a collective pseudonym because it has a unique identity with a reputation. However, considering Anonymous a self would be inaccurate under Locke’s definition because it lacks continuity of consciousness. The experiences of one Anonymous member/account are distinct from another’s, so it cannot be one aggregate and individual self. From this example, we can consider the unique online identity of a pseudonym in the same way Lock considers the ‘body’ in his essay: it is the source from where most experiences and consciousness are felt. This allows us to attribute and understand other aspects of Locke’s work in a modern context. For example, Locke argues that a man can never be in more than one place at once; the same is true for a unique online identity in that it can only exist as one identity online at any given moment.\n\nReturning to our hypothetical example, what if Bob and Joe lose their interest in pizzas and transfer pizzaboy’s identity and recorded experiences to their friend Jake? This would suggest that, per Locke’s definition, pizzaboy’s continuity is sustained because their conscious experiences are sustained. This is where Locke’s work has limitations in relation to today’s world. He does not consider self-control as an important factor in determining the self. This was a deliberate and necessary exclusion in his definition because it allows for a logical explanation of edge cases of selfhood. For example, for a paralyzed person to have a ‘self’, it cannot be that self-control is a prerequisite for the self. One way to expand on Locke’s definition for today’s world is to suggest that the self requires continuity of control. Hypothetically, if a demon takes control of your body but you are still conscious, it would make sense to say that you are not yourself anymore. So, when Jake takes over the pizzaboy account, logic would suggest that pizzaboy becomes a *new* self that is distinct from the *old *self controlled by Joe and Bob. This is the case despite the fact that continuity of consciousness was preserved during the transition.\n\nLet us now explore multiple pseudonyms/identities controlled by a single individual. Let us take the example of a hypothetical person named Eric who has three online identities: his Facebook account (under his real name), his meme Twitter account (under a fake name), and his World of Warcraft gaming account (fake name as well). Continuity of both consciousness and control (in relation to Eric) are preserved, so each of them is not distinct from Eric the person. But are they distinct from one another in terms of selfhood? For this to be the case, the consciousness or control would have to be discrete for different pseudonymous identities.\n\n### **Authentic Self**\n\nSociologist Sherry Turkle suggests that control may be discrete in some of these cases. In her work titled [**How Computers Change the Way We Think**](http://www1.udel.edu/educ/whitson/897s05/files/turkle#:~:text=The%20invention%20of%20written%20language,think%20primarily%20of%20the%20computer)*, *Turkle discusses the use of pseudonyms in online communities. She writes that “some children who write narratives for their screen avatars may grow up with too little experience of how to share their real feelings with other people.” How can it be the case that people would have different capabilities for their online avatars as they do for their ‘real’ selves? How can sharing feelings with online friends be different than sharing them with real friends online? Simply put, their contextual experiences do not translate 1-for-1 to their other identities.\n\nIn the famous Stanford prison experiment, students who were given certain positions and authority changed their judgement and behavior entirely. In other words, their consciousness was altered. But can this happen in tandem with other identities? Can someone simultaneously have different consciousnesses depending on which pseudonym they’re using? Can they be both prison guard and prisoner, switching between them at any moment? Online trolls seem to perceive and respond to things differently under their pseudonyms than their real identities. Similarly, we could argue that Eric *becomes a different person* when logged in to his meme Twitter account versus when he is logged in to his Facebook account. In this sense, it could be the case that different pseudonymous identities are distinct ‘selves’ that are continuous with the aggregate person but discrete from one another. Balaji takes the opposite approach, stating that “\\[users] are their fake selves on their real accounts and their real selves on their fake accounts.” In other words, he’s suggesting that not only do pseudonyms allow for identity play, but they also provide the opportunity for people to be *more* authentic. The potential judgement and consequences that come from sharing content as yourself can be overcome with the use of pseudonyms. This allows pseudonymous users to be more ‘themselves’ when sharing content or opinions with their network.\n\nAdditionally, from these points we could argue that the ‘real’ or ‘authentic’ self is not the human self but the aggregation of all branches of the self. If all our pseudonyms identities are extensions of our total selves because of the continuous consciousness and control, then the total self must be the actual self. If each of the pseudonymous identities is distinct from the other, then none of them–not even our physical selves– can be seen as the ‘real self’ independent of the others. Either Eric has one aggregated real self or each pseudonymous identity is its own real self as a partial continuation of who Eric once was. Since the time of Turkle’s writing, we have spent more and more time interacting online than we do in our real lives. These progressions may have altered her perspective of where ‘realness’ lies.\n\nAs the world changes, so must humanity’s definition of self. It must extend beyond the physical and the spiritual. It must consider the reach of a person’s online actions as well as their ability to consume information. It must account for hybrid forms of consciousness where artificial intelligence aids in perception, reflection, and retention. If it fails to evolve as a definition, humanity is doomed to lose its sense of individual identity altogether. Balaji’s work is the start of something profound, with many questions left unanswered.\n", "timestamp": 1614661077, "digest": "PERP4volHG4pqSi1aqbImepVynfzwKLBa-qXf74xx6M", "contributor": "0x30E838D51c61811d382962B4e0699715462DcdE1"}

By holding certain social tokens, users will have a claim over $YUP rewards given to accounts linked to those specific tokens. We're piloting this with Alex Masmej and the $ALEX token and are looking for other social token holders, leaders, and platforms to [*work with*](https://yupio.typeform.com/to/cMDWqTmS).\n\nSocial tokens are growing at an incredible pace, becoming a [*$250m market*](https://socialstudies.substack.com/p/a-primer-on-social-money-by-holyn) in less than two years. Here are a few different social token types that we have seen come to light during this development:\n\n🤓 **The personal token** ➡️ $ALEX, $KERMAN\n\nCreated to support and invest in an individual's goals whether professional or personal.\n\n🌎 **The community token** ➡️ $FWB, $KARMA, $WHALE, $CHERRY, $JAMM, $THANKS\n\nCreated to bring people together based on a common interest or mission.\n\n🤩 **The fan club token** ➡️ $RAC, $FIRST\n\nHybrid that brings together fans (a community) based on a common interest in an individual's content.\n\n[*(*Social Studies*, Brett Goldstein)*](https://socialstudies.substack.com/p/a-primer-on-social-money-by-holyn)\n\nAs new versions of social tokens emerge, so too do new use-cases and incentives to hold or spend these tokens. Some include:\n\n*   Token-permissioned chat groups, features, events, or newsletters  ➡️ [*Outpost Protocol*](https://outpost-protocol.com/), [*Mirror*](https://mirror.xyz/)\n*   Tipping within communities ➡️ [*Collab Land*](https://collab.land/)\n*   DAO Governance ➡️ [*KARMA DAO*](https://twitter.com/karma_dao)\n*   Token-only purchases or collectible drops\n*   Rewards for social action ➡️ [*Unite.Community*](https://unite.community/)\n*   Retroactive distributions ➡️ [*RAC*](https://blog.ourzora.com/home/introducing-rac)\n\nThese concepts are beautiful and have worked quite well thus far. In Outpost's [*Sam Hatem's*](https://twitter.com/sam\\_\\_hatem) words, they allow \"consumers to be stakeholders in communities and financially benefit from the creator’s success.\" This is the future that we all want, and Yup wants to help. We propose a new use-case for social tokens to expand on their possibilities and support their development.\n\n### Social Token YUP Rewards\n\nIn line with this movement, Yup presents *Social Token YUP Rewards* as an additional incentive to hold social tokens for the right to a portion of creator/curator rewards distributed through the Yup Protocol. When social media accounts tied to your social token earn YUP, you earn YUP.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nIn its current form, the Yup Protocol rewards users in newly-minted YUP based on curation: when someone influential likes a piece of content across the web, the creator and previous curators earn YUP. A Twitter 'like', for example, is weighted based on the liker's influence, given a token value, and distributed to the tweet's author and all the likers that came before. This creates an incredibly robust curator economy. [*(Learn More)*](https://docs.yup.io/#/)\n\nSocial Token YUP Rewards will allow the admins/owners of certain accounts associated with a social token to link their YUP earnings to a specific token. Then, holders of the said token would be able to claim YUP rewards earned by those social accounts during their time of holding.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070\\_ca1224e16e454fd884ff8080020f8fbf~mv2.png/v1/fit/w\\_800,h\\_800,al_c,q\\_5/file.png)\n\nFor example, Alex Masmej may link his Twitter account @AlexMasmej to the $ALEX token reward pool. If the @AlexMasmej account earns 100 YUP while you own 10% of all $ALEX tokens, you can claim 10 YUP from the pool. You cannot claim YUP for rewards that were given during times where you did not hold $ALEX.\n\nThe act of linking/unlinking, along with other changes, may require a token vote per the defined rules of each individual social token. The act of claiming rewards would function similarly to products like [*Roll*](https://tryroll.com/) or [*Unite.Community*](https://unite.community/).\n\n**Why this is important**\n\nThe stronger the reasons to hold a social token are, the more valuable and robust its economy will be. Yup provides an additional incentive mechanism to hold without imposing any platform risk or deep integration from the community. Simply hold the social token and help support the community behind it as one normally would, and then claim YUP rewards as they are distributed to the community.\n\n### A call to all social tokens\n\nWe're looking to launch Social Token YUP Rewards as early as Q2 of 2021 with as many credible tokens as possible. If you manage a community with a token, have a personal token, run a social token platform, or are a holder/community member, [*please reach out to us here*](https://yupio.typeform.com/to/cMDWqTmS) or [*join our discord*](https://discord.gg/3W7em2b).\n\nA special thanks to [*Alex Masmej*](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej), [*Brett Goldstein*](https://twitter.com/thatguyBG), [*Sam Hatem*](https://twitter.com/sam\\_\\_hatem), [*Jess Sloss*](https://twitter.com/thattallguy), and many others!\n", "timestamp": 1614661122, "digest": "29c7yOvSTORzmTlLMQ9pa7vbw2mR58R7lcCH_IXGz-8", "contributor": "0x30E838D51c61811d382962B4e0699715462DcdE1"}
{"id": "ZmN3y96wyj3976hZBZSJIQTbRKi6QdDBr9TI7a0iLII", "title": "NFT Curator Rewards", "body": "### A new revenue stream for NFT creators, curators, and collectors focused on likes.\n\n![*Elephant Dreams* | artist @rac | owner @maxstealth | ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/14316](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070_ebb41460c33044658f384f31d4359ed5~mv2.gif)\n\n*This was originally posted on [blog.yup.io](https://blog.yup.io) and has been moved here.*\n\n*TLDR; With the growth of NFTs and digital art, more and more users spend time browsing and curating NFTs. Currently, NFT creators and owners earn money on sale and resale. Yup proposes a new revenue stream for digital art creators AND curators we're calling NFT Curator Rewards. Curators earn YUP for liking and rating NFTs on their favorite platforms. Some of those rewards go to creators/owners, with on-chain attribution.*\n\n**NFT (Non-Fungible Token)** is an umbrella term for a digital asset that represents whole and unique items, virtual or physical. Unlike bitcoin or ether, they represent things, like art, real estate, in-game assets, limited edition goods like handbags or cassette tapes. They’re often referred to as crypto collectibles and are either used as a representation of a physical item, or a virtual asset.\n\n### The NFT Digital Art space is growing\n\nNFTs are not a new idea, but they are now receiving a lot of attention because of the hype and excitement around blockchain.\n\nFor collectors, rare digital art could have a real value in a way that physical art just can’t. The “rare” part of the NFT is what makes it valuable. But for artists, the appeal of NFTs is that they might be able to monetize their work in a way that was never possible before. With blockchain, there is an opportunity to democratize art.\n\nIt's all happening quite quickly: $8m in [NFT total sales](http://nonfungible.com/) on Ethereum this month, Christie's NFT auction, Lil Miquela selling a [digital art piece for $82k](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/11/21/lil-miquela-collects-82-thousand-for-charity/), and [online museums emerging](https://www.mocda.org/).\n\nDespite this, there is often skepticism regarding the scarce nature of a digital asset that can be copied. Often the larger value proposition is missed entirely: the liquid IP that an NFT represents. This concept is deeply explored in Jake Brukhman's work, which is highly recommended. [He states](https://blog.coinfund.io/all-digital-content-is-going-on-chain-ae26a7071657):\n\n# \n\n> In the future, purchasing an NFT will entitle the owner to certain rights related to its content: the right to own and keep; the right to sell, license, and lend; as well as the right to royalties, the right to confer reuse (i.e. “movie rights”), and so on.\n\nCurator rewards will be one of the cash flows associated with visual and audio NFTs, leveraging their function as a right to royalties. Their IP represented in tokens allows for alignment between creators and curators.\n\n**Curation is Art**\n\nCuration has long been an art form, whether it be for museums or playlists or top 10 lists or stories. The idea of earning from them is not new, but it has yet been applied to NFT art. Additionally, users are starting to spend more time 'window shopping' NFTs rather than just purchasing. The experience resembles something more like Instagram or Pinterest than Ebay. While curators are important to the economy, the often miss out on direct income because of the difficulty of quantifying/renting engagement. We see Yup as a way to bridge this gap.\n\n### Introducing YUP Rewards for NFTs\n\nIn line with this movement, Yup presents *NFT YUP Rewards* as an additional incentive to buy, hold, and curate NFTs for the right to a portion of creator/curator rewards distributed through the Yup Protocol. When NFTs that you created, curated, or own earn YUP, you earn YUP.\n\n[https://youtu.be/XqveU599ojg](https://youtu.be/XqveU599ojg)\n\n**How it works:**\n\nIn its current form, the Yup Protocol rewards users in newly-minted YUP based on curation: when someone influential likes a piece of content across the web, the creator and previous curators earn YUP. A Twitter 'like', for example, is weighted based on the liker's influence, given a token value, and distributed to the tweet's author and all the likers that came before. This helps form a robust curator economy.

When those NFTs/URLs are liked or rated on Yup, the creator rewards will go into a pool that allows addresses identified as creators/owners to receive their pro rata distribution of YUP rewards. Curators will be rewarded from future likes given to the NFT from any site or platform.\n\n### Benefits\n\nNFT YUP rewards benefit collectors, creators, and curators in a manner that doesn't hinder the existing trading experience but provides an additional revenue stream that should benefit participants and inform collectors. Memes are often used an example where provenance would be a killer use-case. But the real value associated with provenance comes in royalties. With YUP as a recurring revenue stream, NFT creators, curators, and collectors will all be more incentivized and informed on the social value of the token.\n\n### NFT features\n\n**NFTs in Feeds**\n\nStarting this week, NFTs will be in Yup's feeds. Users can curate NFTs on their favorite marketplaces (Rarible, OpenSea, etc.) and see them in their profiles and feeds on [Yup](http://app.yup.io/). Soon, we plan on adding an NFT-only feed for browsing and curating. Here's\n\n![NFT Example](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYsnX4y4Cg4zfme4y1PRfxNi6xsPB7L8MvMJ3dpXEGeJz?filename=nftexample.gif)\n\n**Token Metadata**\n\nCurrently, the information collected on each NFT is quite limited, but we plan to improve on this over time, adding subgraph ERC-721 metadata such as previous owners and bid price.\n\n**Beyond Art**\n\nAnything that can be tokenized, can be liked. Anything that can be liked can be rewarded. Other examples of NFTs we may see rate in the future could be in-game collectibles, domain names, or even songs. We're open to hearing any other ideas that the community has as to what we can reward users for rating.\n\n*We're looking to launch NFT YUP Rewards as early as Q1 of 2021 with as many credible artists, platforms, and integrations as possible.

[**91%**](https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/)** of 18–34 year old consumers trust online reviews as much as the recommendations of their friends and family. **\n2.  [**~50%**](https://www.colorado.edu/business/sites/default/files/attached-files/jcr\\_2016\\_de_langhe_fernbach_lichtenstein\\_0.pdf)** of online reviews accurately reflect the quality and value of the product/service being reviewed. **\n\nAll numbers point to one important truth about online opinions: we all care about them deeply, base decisions on them, **yet they’re largely inaccurate.**\n\nWhen information is limited, humans tend to turn to whichever signals they consider to most directly reflect the subject at hand. When it comes to online reviews, star ratings are king, helping users determine the value of products on Amazon, locations on Google Maps, businesses on Yelp, and riders/drivers on Uber, among many others.\n\nUnfortunately, they’re just not that accurate. Several [CU Boulder Professors](https://www.colorado.edu/business/sites/default/files/attached-files/jcr\\_2016\\_de_langhe_fernbach_lichtenstein\\_0.pdf) analyzed 1272 Amazon products’ user ratings and concluded that reviews often lack convergence with more vetted quality scores or the ability to predict resale prices. In summary, the researchers argue that there is a “substantial disconnect between the objective quality information that user ratings actually convey and the extent to which consumers trust them as indicators of objective qualities.”\n\nWe theorize that this disconnect between trust and accuracy is a factor of the changes in *access* that occurred as a result of the rise of the internet. Access in this case refers to both the ability for anyone to rate products/ services/ content and the ability to see more ratings online. We believe that the growth of access first lead to an increase in both trust and accuracy but, over time, reduced the reputation at stake and lead to a divergence between trust and accuracy. (more on this later) \n\nDoes this failure to accurately predict quality betray humanity’s careless impulse towards simple visual representations? Or is this indicative of our over-reliance on a perceived consensus on opinions that is far less effective than we realize? Let’s begin.\n\n### [#OpinionsMatter](https://www.blog.yup.io/blog/hashtags/OpinionsMatter)\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0\\*NbtFv9KBGGFnqdOS)\n\n**There are few things more valuable to us than the opinions of others.**\n\nWe have increasingly relied upon the opinions of others to direct our decisions. Some powerful opinions can make a dramatic impact, like the [Oprah Effect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oprah-effect.asp), whereby products regularly see a significant boost in sales following a public endorsement from Oprah Winfrey. More often, however, they come from the general public, as is the case with ecommerce product reviews like Amazon, Ebay, and Walmart. \n\nA highly-cited [Harvard Business School study ](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=41233)from 2011 estimated that a one-star rating increase on Yelp translated to an increase of 5% to 9% in revenues for a restaurant. [Cornell researchers](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-announces-settlement-machinima-and-three-other-companies-false) found that a one-star change in a hotel’s online ratings on sites like Travelocity and TripAdvisor is tied to an 11% sway in room rates, on average.\n\nThe internet’s peer-to-peer nature is a huge reason for this, as opinions have become more accessible. In a [study done by Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/resources/customer-service-and-lifetime-customer-value/), 88 percent of customers read an online review that influenced their buying decision. Average user rating has become a huge driver of sales, and now, user-generated ratings and narrative reviews can be found on almost every website that sells something. \n\nHowever, reviews and ratings impact more than just customers’ buying decisions; investors and partners look at a business’ reviews too, in order to gauge how a brand or company is being received by the public. Investors trying to wrap their head around a business will look at their product’s reviews “100% of the time,” according to [Forbes research](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanerskine/2018/01/31/seeking-funding-top-investors-reveal-what-they-look-for-online-before-meeting-business-owners/#9f6b90d7d8f9).\n\nThe Colorado University [study](https://www.colorado.edu/business/sites/default/files/attached-files/jcr\\_2016\\_de_langhe_fernbach_lichtenstein\\_0.pdf) argues that the average consumer is under the assumption that “we are entering an age of almost perfect information, allowing consumers to make more informed choices and be influenced less by marketers,” largely due to the “proliferation of new sources of information.” However, the research also suggests that we assume that user ratings “provide an almost perfect indication of product quality with little search cost . . . consumers now make better choices, are more rational decision makers, less susceptible to the influence of marketing and branding.” But in addition to that, “consumers fail to consider these issues appropriately when forming quality inferences from user ratings and other observable cues. They place enormous weight on the average user rating as an indicator of objective quality compared to other cues.” This, we argue, has to do with the search costs of finding valid information on reviews.\n\n### Fake it till you break it\n\n> *“More people are depending on reviews for what to buy and where to go, so the incentives for faking are getting bigger… **It’s a very cheap way of marketing.**”* — [Bing Liu](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/27/technology/for-2-a-star-a-retailer-gets-5-star-reviews.html), Professor at University of Illinois\n\nFake activity, bots, and trolls aren’t new to the internet, nor are they new to our written content (See: [*The Influencer’s Dilemma*](https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-influencers-dilemma-83582be1925c)). But in the case of opinions, they take on a slightly different form.\n\nOpinions *should* drive the progress of products and services. Business plans *should* be centered around providing goods that consumers want and like. If online referendum were accurate, businesses would have to develop products more than they market them. But if opinions can be manipulated, higher returns can be earned by focusing on reviews as a marketer-controlled variable (something that marketers can control and manipulate for a price).\n\nIn the internet age, reviews have very much become a form of marketing and has evolved into an enormous business: [*reputation management*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_management). Companies need reputations, and reputations come from people, unless you can buy them for cheaper than an ad campaign.\n\nFakespot, a ratings analytics tool, [estimates](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buyer-beware-a-scourge-of-fake-online-reviews-is-hitting-amazon-walmart-and-other-major-retailers/) that 52 percent of Walmart reviews and 30 percent of Amazon reviews are fake or unreliable. A recent ReviewMeta analysis determined that in March of 2019 alone, Amazon was hit with a flurry of more than 2 million [unverified reviews](https://www.verticalrail.com/kb/difference-between-amazon-reviews/) (that is, reviews that can’t be confirmed as purchases made through Amazon) — 99.6% of which were 5 stars. Most were ratings of off-brand electronics products.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0\\*J8D5T1yfQJO7BBNo)\n\nOnce we recognize the enormous incentives behind fake opinions and the ease with which people can create them, it should become quite difficult to trust review sites. Review boards, once populated by a swath of genuine do-gooders, have transformed into sinister armies of would-be bots and paid actors. That sweet grandma raving about her favorite brand of cookies? That’s probably a powerful bot farm connected to all sorts of notorious online activity. The top rated professor on [RateMyProfessors.com](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) at Columbia University? She likely filled out most of the reviews herself. And the most rated CU professor on the site? [Ted Mosby](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1482580) from *How I Met Your Mother*. Just for fun, I’ve also added Rick from Rick & Morty to the site as a [CU physics professor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2509676). \n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0\\*70dr3Ps-SDKOHrrX)\n\n### Review Bombing\n\nOf all the ways to utilize fake reviews to manipulate outcomes, review bombing has to be the funniest. It’s the simple act of many users/accounts flooding a product with poor reviews to make it seem unappealing to the general public. Kind of like a “[Sybil Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack)” of opinions.\n\nJust hours after Hillary Clinton released her memoir *What Happened*, detailing her experience in the 2016 campaign, “[hundreds of one-star reviews](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/14/amazon-redacts-one-star-reviews-of-hillary-clintons-what-happened)” appeared on the book’s Amazon product page.\n\nThe book’s publisher expressed to the Associated Press: “It seems highly unlikely that approximately 1,500 people read [Hillary Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Happened\\_%28Clinton_book%29)’s book overnight and came to the stark conclusion that it is either brilliant or awful.” [Quartz ](https://qz.com/1076357/hillary-clintons-what-happened-amazon-just-deleted-over-900-reviews-of-hillary-clintons-new-book/)wrote that of the 1,500 reviews, “only 338 were from users with verified purchases of the book.” \n\nHillary isn’t the only victim to this kind of attack. Firewatch, the indie adventure video game, was [review bombed](https://www.pcgamer.com/firewatch-is-getting-review-bombed-on-steam/) after their removal of famous gaming YouTuber PewDiePie’s *let’s-play* account. Firewatch utilized DMCA copyright laws to remove his content, and fans of PewDiePie didn’t like this “support of censorship”, so they chose to review bomb the game on Steam. Our favorite review was: *“At least one of the game devs seems to be a DMCA abusing SJW crybaby who is using copyright laws to wrongfully take down videos if the reviewer uses a word he doesn’t like.”*\n\n#### Remedies\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0\\*I6dtiygUTSrqVvyS)\n\nSome platforms have taken steps to filter out this type of behavior by requiring certain costs for users to review. [AirBnB](http://airbnb.com/), for example, will only let you review places that you’ve stayed at. [Amazon](http://amazon.com/) attaches ‘Verified Purchase’ tags to reviewers who’ve purchased items. These actions do a solid job at filtering out some of the noise, but are still quite easy to manipulate. I know because I did this for my brother’s AirBnB listing. I booked it for the night, my brother Venmo’d me back the money, I left a great review, and AirBnB made 3% on the transaction (~$1.20). But this unicorn isn’t the only resort site that has this problem. [Researchers](https://www.heraldbulletin.com/should-you-trust-online-travel-reviews/article_b5fedad8-1fa8-5581-a84f-fe07ea931d68.html) at Yale, Dartmouth, and USC found evidence that hotel owners post fake reviews to boost their ratings on TripAdvisor and Booking.com, who run the same ‘verified purchaser’ filtering. They ran a similar scheme to mine: the owners booked rooms for themselves and then proceeded to give their own hotels 5 star reviews. These loopholes are part of a bigger failure to reflect the individual *value *of a review that is necessary for more accurate reviews and results. \n\n### When Everyone’s Super, No One Is\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0\\*nNyAX4llfEoHTaNj.gif)\n\n*The notion that all opinions are created equal online is a large reason for the inaccuracy of opinions.*\n\nLet’s pretend you’re searching for an Italian restaurant in New York for a date with your significant other tonight. Actually, let’s first pretend you indeed *have* a significant other (and aren’t forever alone like me), and then let’s pretend you’d like to take them out.\n\nWhose opinion would you trust more when choosing a restaurant? Michelin star chefs from New York or random tourists on the internet?\n\nHopefully you chose the chefs, at least if you were certain they weren’t bribed to lie. Now let’s say you’re looking to buy your (imaginary) loved one a diamond ring. Do the chefs have any unique expertise that would serve you on this search? Probably not.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*tMguMouTNW3FDdKxg7USRg.gif)\n\nThe moral of this romantic story is that **opinions aren’t democracies;** we shouldn’t all get an equal say as to the subjective quality of products, venues, or anything else for that matter. What we need is more of a meritocracy, because some of us have earned the right to speak on certain topics with authority, not necessarily through a college degree or an award but could simply be receiving the continued approval of the online community. Today, most sites that you visit treat everybody equally and give their opinions equal reign on any and all subjects. This one-person-one-vote model just doesn’t make sense for diverse decision-making, because it doesn’t distribute accurate weight to the expertise of various participants.\n\n### Attempts at Reputation\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*15dSNHdGvEhgWSKu7xNAvw.png)\n\n#### **Yelp Stats**\n\nSites whose main function is reviews have taken stronger actions to represent reputation in opinions. **Yelp** attempts to show a user’s reputation by reflecting the votes others have given on their reviews (as well as some other stats). The advantage of this portrayal of reputation is that it allows users to vet reviewers as ‘legitimate,’ mostly negative or positive in their reviews, or as having tendencies to act a certain way. The main problem with these metrics is that they don’t provide information or expertise; if a user is funny, how does that make them a better reviewer of bars? Sure, if you dig deep enough, you can start to infer certain things like that a reviewer’s past opinions on car mechanics may be strongly supported by the community or that their reviews on hardware stores are thought to be useless. But the search costs for doing this for every reviewer are far too high right now.\n\nLastly, this representation of reputation doesn’t affect the weighting of stars for a business. You could have a good rep on Yelp and still have the same influence over average ratings as any other user.\n\n### Flawed Incentives\n\nOpinions have been recognized for their dollar value on the seller side. As of now, sellers still seem to be the only ones particularly concerned with swaying opinions. The platforms gain from the influx of data, and do everything they can to ensure that this input of data is smooth, regardless of accuracy. They try to remain as objective as possible but still often manipulate results to suit their interests as a company. The buyers have no incentive to review accurately and therefore act based on external interests. Crucially, this whole system is flawed because it functions independently of real monetization for all parties involved.\n\n### Nothing at Stake\n\nIn the Israeli Army, at the end of bootcamp, soldiers are required to fill out evaluations of the training itself. When members of my battalion filled out this evaluation, my friend told all of us to “write that training was really easy so that the next soldiers have an even harder time!” Because reviews were anonymous and had no built-in reward scheme, there is no incentive to be honest. \n\nA similar situation occurs on college campuses when students are asked to fill out course evaluations at the end of the semester. Because they have nothing at stake and will never take the class again, it is common for them to underplay the difficulty of the class so that future students of the course will have as difficult (if not more) of a time as they did, increasing the value of the previous students’ grades. \n\n**So why would people give honest opinions without any incentive?**\n\nRight now, as a good actor on Yelp, Google, or Amazon, all you stand to gain for reviewing honestly is a minimal sense of increased reputation. As a bad actor, you lose absolutely nothing for making inaccurate reviews all over the web. This is why we witness 21% more negative reviews than positive ones; with no other incentives involved, anger/frustration seems to be the driving incentive for negative reviews. \n\n### The Consequences of Access\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*GsFAioCpngaFUZ2UqVzy_A.png)\n\nAs expressed in the introduction, we expect that changes in* access *that occurred as a result of the rise of the internet had a significant effect on the trust in and accuracy of opinions. Access in this case refers to both the ability for anyone to rate products/ services/ content and the ease at which one can see more ratings online. \n\nWhen online review forums first emerged, they provided increasingly accurate opinions because of the “[wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)” effect taking hold. These initial communities were small, and natural reputation effects among members existed because many knew each other by name. As misconceptions about the internet dissipated, trust in these reviews grew because they were in fact more accurate. But as access continued to increase and platforms changed, the natural reputation effects shrunk. This decreased the reputation at stake for each user and allowed for fake reviews to thrive, reducing accuracy significantly. Now, there is still a correlation between accuracy and trust; more accuracy leads to more trust, BUT more trust doesn’t necessarily lead to more accuracy. In fact, the more trust users have in online reviews the more worthwhile they are to fake/manipulate, creating a harmful equilibrium: **more accuracy → more trust → less accuracy → less trust → more accuracy … **\n\nIf there was some way to (1) improve the user’s ability to identify inaccuracies, (2) deter the manipulation/misuse of reviews, and (3) correctly weight reviewers’ expertise on certain topics, communities could reach a perfect correlation between changes in trust and accuracy. \n\n### Carrots, Sticks, and Scarcity\n\nStrong opinion models should provide major incentives for accurate reviews. If users were rewarded (monetarily or otherwise) for reviewing things, they’d take the time to make better decisions. One way of doing this is by P2P validation, meaning that if other users agree with a user’s opinion, either by upvoting their opinion or by submitting a similar review, that user should get rewarded. This can be (somewhat) accomplished with prediction markets, whereby users bet that a product is good or bad and if a majority of betters agree with them, they earn some profit. \n\nOn the opposite side is deterrence; users should be deterred from submitting inaccurate reviews. This could be enacted in a similar fashion, whereby users lose something for giving bad reviews that no one agrees with or supports.\n\nThis concept has been attempted in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space with the *Token Curated Registries*: lists of similar products/content/etc. that are curated by staking cryptocoins. This can be perceived as ‘betting’ that a product will be liked by others and they’ll also vote for it. If others also bet on it, you receive a token reward, if no one does, you lose your stake.\n\nThe final important piece here is scarcity: users should have a limited amount of reviews that they can give within a set amount of time. If users stand to gain or lose from their reviews, and they can only give their opinion x times a day, they’re less likely to abuse or waste these reviews.\n\n### Weighted Opinions\n\nBecause not all opinions are equal, they should have different weights over different subjects. The ratings of users who are repeatedly validated for their opinions on restaurants should matter more in the case of restaurants than other topics. Imagine a review platform that functioned like this: Charlie the chef has a “restaurant score” of 5 and a “jewelry score” of 0.5 (the average user score being 1). His star rating of a restaurant would be 10x more impactful than his review of a jewelry store and 5x more impactful than the average user’s restaurant rating. So when he likes a restaurant, it significantly effects the average rating, but when he dislikes a jewelry store, it barely budges. Like the TCR example mentioned above, Charlie has something at stake: his influence. Instead of risking losing money in hopes of gaining some, he’s risking the weighted impact he has within his expertise in hopes of growing it further. \n\nIn a platform where opinions are perfectly weighted and distributed, reviews would be more accurate. Investment in malicious marketing would be deterred. The distortion of customer reviews would be difficult. Cash would flow towards improving product quality + retaining users, rather than used to bolster the fraudulent image of a popular, well-liked company. However, accomplishing this in a fair and peer-to-peer manner is difficult without some decentralized consensus, which we’ll discuss below. \n\n### Data Legibility\n\nPeople often talk about data transparency, but what about [data legibility](https://medium.com/doteveryone/data-legibility-and-a-common-language-coping-not-coding-part-2-8afb687de60)? Even if users have access to enough data on particular products, services, or the reviewers of them, rarely is that information fully comprehensible by the average user. The easier data is to understand and leverage to make better decisions, the more difficult it becomes to manipulate opinions and ratings. To return to the *Yelp stats *example mentioned above, Yelp could easily determine a score for a reviewer in different categories of rating. Reviewers could theoretically be given a high score for their reviews on mechanics while a low score for their reviews on bars, and have this be shown to the users directly from the venue page where the review was. By doing this, sites like Yelp can put more power into the hands of the users with the same data that is currently displayed on them. As author [James Bridle says](http://booktwo.org/notebook/drone-shadows/):\n\n> *Those who cannot perceive the network cannot act effectively within it, and are powerless.*\n\n### Decentralization\n\nSometimes the centralization of the platform itself can lead to biases and inaccuracies. Even Consumer Reports, which pays reviewers for their ratings and is considered quite accurate, has been [susceptible](https://www.allpar.com/cr.html) to biases towards certain companies or industries. By altering distribution, the questions asked in the survey, or the demographic of participants, a platform could significantly alter the results of a report. It seems inevitable that one would at some point when you think about the product they are selling: reputation––sometimes on behalf of the consumer and sometimes not.\n\nSo if centralized platforms are inevitably going to have some bias, the next best thing must be a \\*decentralized\\* platform that no one owns, right? Well, yes and no. Like the email, permissionless protocols allow for some powerful peer-to-peer interactions, and this type of model could be great for opinion economies and reputation schemes. Some potential benefits of decentralization include: \n\n1.  **Fair weighting of opinions voted on by the community in whole**\n2.  **A single universal reputation/identity that can be used on all sites without ever disrupting those sites business models (like logging into Tinder with your GMail account without Google collecting/selling any data)**\n3.  **A native and provably scarce asset to facilitate monetization or prediction markets.**\n4.  **Immutable record of reviews and reputations.**\n\nHowever, decentralized protocols present their own issues such as bribing, collusion, and tragedy of the commons. For example, if a positive rating is worth more to a marketer than the money lost in achieving that rating on one of these platforms, they’ll surely do it. This is entirely possible considering that users will probably not stake too much on one individual rating, especially if there aren’t that many participants. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe hope that nobody sees an online opinion and immediately assumes it to be a perfect indicator of the truth. We hope that the internet generation can discern real from phony without giving it a second thought, that subconsciously filters out advertisements rather than give them precious brain time. And finally, we hope that a new reputation scheme that is fair and incentivized will emerge to disrupt the status quo. \n", "timestamp": 1614660890, "digest": "hYTymLHXg12dcjiXlMyyHTkfpU4nivJu8FjShifBogg", "contributor": "0x30E838D51c61811d382962B4e0699715462DcdE1"}
{"id": "B-1pq_1AEPdidPE7GgCG5CS2XiO33BNCxnjBMu_gxdU", "title": "NFT Curator Rewards", "body": "### A new revenue stream for NFT creators, curators, and collectors focused on likes.\n\n![*Elephant Dreams* | artist @rac | owner @maxstealth | ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/14316](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ed070_ebb41460c33044658f384f31d4359ed5~mv2.gif)\n\n*This was originally posted on [blog.yup.io](https://blog.yup.io) and has been moved here.*\n\n*TLDR; With the growth of NFTs and digital art, more and more users spend time browsing and curating NFTs. Currently, NFT creators and owners earn money on sale and resale. Yup proposes a new revenue stream for digital art creators AND curators we're calling NFT Curator Rewards. Curators earn YUP for liking and rating NFTs on their favorite platforms. Some of those rewards go to creators/owners, with on-chain attribution.*\n\n**NFT (Non-Fungible Token)** is an umbrella term for a digital asset that represents whole and unique items, virtual or physical. Unlike bitcoin or ether, they represent things, like art, real estate, in-game assets, limited edition goods like handbags or cassette tapes. They’re often referred to as crypto collectibles and are either used as a representation of a physical item, or a virtual asset.\n\n### The NFT Digital Art space is growing\n\nNFTs are not a new idea, but they are now receiving a lot of attention because of the hype and excitement around blockchain.\n\nFor collectors, rare digital art could have a real value in a way that physical art just can’t. The “rare” part of the NFT is what makes it valuable. But for artists, the appeal of NFTs is that they might be able to monetize their work in a way that was never possible before. With blockchain, there is an opportunity to democratize art.\n\nIt's all happening quite quickly: $8m in [NFT total sales](http://nonfungible.com/) on Ethereum this month, Christie's NFT auction, Lil Miquela selling a [digital art piece for $82k](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/11/21/lil-miquela-collects-82-thousand-for-charity/), and [online museums emerging](https://www.mocda.org/).\n\nDespite this, there is often skepticism regarding the scarce nature of a digital asset that can be copied. Often the larger value proposition is missed entirely: the liquid IP that an NFT represents. This concept is deeply explored in Jake Brukhman's work, which is highly recommended. [He states](https://blog.coinfund.io/all-digital-content-is-going-on-chain-ae26a7071657):\n\n# \n\n> In the future, purchasing an NFT will entitle the owner to certain rights related to its content: the right to own and keep; the right to sell, license, and lend; as well as the right to royalties, the right to confer reuse (i.e. “movie rights”), and so on.\n\nCurator rewards will be one of the cash flows associated with visual and audio NFTs, leveraging their function as a right to royalties. Their IP represented in tokens allows for alignment between creators and curators.\n\n**Curation is Art**\n\nCuration has long been an art form, whether it be for museums or playlists or top 10 lists or stories. The idea of earning from them is not new, but it has yet been applied to NFT art. Additionally, users are starting to spend more time 'window shopping' NFTs rather than just purchasing. The experience resembles something more like Instagram or Pinterest than Ebay. While curators are important to the economy, the often miss out on direct income because of the difficulty of quantifying/renting engagement. We see Yup as a way to bridge this gap.\n\n### Introducing YUP Rewards for NFTs\n\nIn line with this movement, Yup presents *NFT YUP Rewards* as an additional incentive to buy, hold, and curate NFTs for the right to a portion of creator/curator rewards distributed through the Yup Protocol. When NFTs that you created, curated, or own earn YUP, you earn YUP.\n\n[https://youtu.be/XqveU599ojg](https://youtu.be/XqveU599ojg)\n\n**How it works:**\n\nIn its current form, the Yup Protocol rewards users in newly-minted YUP based on curation: when someone influential likes a piece of content across the web, the creator and previous curators earn YUP. A Twitter 'like', for example, is weighted based on the liker's influence, given a token value, and distributed to the tweet's author and all the likers that came before. This helps form a robust curator economy.

When those NFTs/URLs are liked or rated on Yup, the creator rewards will go into a pool that allows addresses identified as creators/owners to receive their pro rata distribution of YUP rewards. Curators will be rewarded from future likes given to the NFT from any site or platform.\n\n### Benefits\n\nNFT YUP rewards benefit collectors, creators, and curators in a manner that doesn't hinder the existing trading experience but provides an additional revenue stream that should benefit participants and inform collectors. Memes are often used an example where provenance would be a killer use-case. But the real value associated with provenance comes in royalties. With YUP as a recurring revenue stream, NFT creators, curators, and collectors will all be more incentivized and informed on the social value of the token.\n\n### NFT features\n\n**NFTs in Feeds**\n\nStarting this week, NFTs will be in Yup's feeds. Users can curate NFTs on their favorite marketplaces (Rarible, OpenSea, etc.) and see them in their profiles and feeds on [Yup](http://app.yup.io/). Soon, we plan on adding an NFT-only feed for browsing and curating. Here's\n\n![NFT Example](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYsnX4y4Cg4zfme4y1PRfxNi6xsPB7L8MvMJ3dpXEGeJz?filename=nftexample.gif)\n\n**Token Metadata**\n\nCurrently, the information collected on each NFT is quite limited, but we plan to improve on this over time, adding subgraph ERC-721 metadata such as previous owners and bid price.\n\n**Beyond Art**\n\nAnything that can be tokenized, can be liked. Anything that can be liked can be rewarded. Other examples of NFTs we may see rate in the future could be in-game collectibles, domain names, or even songs. We're open to hearing any other ideas that the community has as to what we can reward users for rating.\n\n*We're looking to launch NFT YUP Rewards as early as Q1 of 2021 with as many credible artists, platforms, and integrations as possible.

{"id": "IDykjkrUGzCZr1W_yoxuxKLUbDgQ0tyGYu-rnuavcI8", "title": "Blind Share: Spreading Un-Seen Information", "body": "*TL;DR: Users share content they haven't read, with even fewer viewers fact-checking its claims. The incentive structure on most social media drives individuals to share as quickly as possible and place faith in influencers to signal what can be trusted. Twitter and other platforms have attempted to make users feel accountable for what they share. But more can be done to reward and expose positive behavior.*\n\n**In June, Twitter implemented a new feature in hopes of reducing users’ tendency to blindly share content: a warning prompt prior to retweet. Whenever users attempt to retweet a tweet that contains an article they haven’t opened, Twitter will ask the user if they want to read before retweeting.**\n\n**This may have some noteworthy effects on user behavior during the pre-share moments of their user experience. Let us explore the social incentives that drive blind sharing, consider the potential success of Twitter’s approach to reduce it, and discuss other possible remedies to the problem.**\n\n**Misinformation and disinformation (collectively referred to as ‘misinformation’ in this piece) have become a notable hindrance to public discourse. When individuals share content they haven’t reviewed themselves, it increases the likelihood of spreading false facts, misleading information, or unintended messages entirely. Widespread misinformation reduces the knowledge of basic facts, breaks down trust in institutions and traditional media, and corrodes public debate through false equivalencies. It can be used to justify giving a mainstream platform to unfounded claims for the sake of neutrality and it can cause political polarization and unnecessary divisiveness. (**[***Waldman***](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1661\\&context=jcl)**) Many citizens wish to reduce misinformation but act in ways that can expand its reach.**\n\n***Worse than judging a book by its covers is judging an article by its title.***\n\n**One of the major phenomena of online social behavior is that users rarely read the content that they share. In fact, **[***Gabielkov et. al***](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01281190/document)** estimate that 59% of the URLs mentioned on Twitter are not clicked/read at all prior to being shared. Even less users take the time to fact-check that content. A **[***2017 ZignalLabs***](http://go.zignallabs.com/Q1-2017-fake-news-report)** survey of over 2,000 adults indicated that 86% of Americans who read news articles on social media do not always fact-check the information they read. 27% of those individuals admit they also share news articles that they haven’t fact checked. Given this immense number of blind sharing and limited fact-checking, there must be incentives that drive this behavior.**\n\n**The incentives that individuals consider prior to sharing content are the direct cause of the swift propagation of misinformation. **[***Fu et al.’s***](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563216307087#bib41)** 2010 study found that there are two primary incentives for sharing information on Facebook. Using both qualitative (focus group interviews) and quantitative (online surveys) methods, they discovered self-interest (likes, status, self-expression, loneliness) and communal (altruism, connection, group joy) incentives as being the most powerful. Focusing on status, one may posit that people share information that will earn them status and potentially refrain from sharing information that will hurt their status. In **[****Status as a Service****](http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service)**, Eugene Wei argues that online participants desire status and “seek out the most efficient path to maximizing social capital”. Considering these two points together, it is quite clear that users who share information online for status will be incentivized to do so in a way that maximizes their earned status.**\n\n***Time plays a critical role in the maximizing of status.* One way to potentially increase one’s own status is by sharing new content earlier. It is common knowledge that information posted ‘early’ in the lifecycle of a story diffuses quicker than that same information shared just a few hours later. (**[***Yoo***](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272696316300419)**) Assuming that a higher reach equates to an increased likelihood of likes and therefore status on social networks like Twitter, it starts to become obvious that users are incentivized to share content as soon as possible in order to maximize their social capital. In other words, being early on a piece of information increases the likelihood of high engagement and social status. The desire to share content quickly may explain the notable amount of users who do not read / fact-check information before sharing it; they want to share it before others do.**\n\n**Retractions, despite their importance, do not deliver the same dose of status as the initial story. When a user or organization retracts or clarifies misleading information that they’ve shared, they often receive little reach and minimally positive sentiment in return. Even in the case when users are exposed to retractions or clarifications, they are very unlikely to change their minds once having heard the original piece of information enough times. (**[***Waldman***](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1661\\&context=jcl)**)**\n\n**Furthermore, influence is an additional factor that affects the propagation of misinformation. **[***Yoo et al.***](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272696316300419)**’s study suggests that the influence of early sharers strongly affects the rate of information propagation, especially during disasters. They stated that, “An originator's influence is particularly relevant to the context of cascades in social media networks during humanitarian crises since users previously reported having significant concerns about the credibility of disaster information they received through social media.” If someone is more influential and is directly related to the information, it tends to spread faster. A contemporary example of this may be Tom Hanks contracting Covid-19 in early March and sharing this information publicly, causing many Americans to look at the virus with more seriousness. There may be two separate reasons for this effect. First, these influencers are trusted by their followers who feel that the information they share is true without reading/verifying. Users may free-ride the perceived fact-checking of the influencer, similar to the bystander effect at an online scale. Second, because fact checks can potentially signal skepticism, individuals may prefer to hold in their doubt about an influencer’s source’s trustworthiness in social situations. (**[***Jun***](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/114/23/5976.full.pdf)**) It may not be easy to point out falsehoods in the 5G conspiracy theory expressed by one’s favorite actor (such as Woody Harrelson in this case). Third, the influencer assumingly has a large following, causing the individual to feel the communal incentive to support the whole group’s beliefs. This puts a lot of power and responsibility in the hands of the highly influential online.**\n\n**Another factor that affects the spread of information is the subject matter. Certain subjects, like humanitarian causes, emergency crises, and political disputes, tend to spread faster than commercial or lifestyle content. (**[***Yoo***](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272696316300419)**) This makes sense, but also makes preventing the propagation of misinformation even more difficult. The subjects that are most important are also the most high-impact opportunities to spread falsehoods and confusion.**\n\n**Twitter’s approach of using a prompt to remind the user to read what they are about to share could have positive effects on the propagation of misinformation. **[***Jun et al.’s***](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/114/23/5976.full.pdf)** research suggests that “\\[i]nducing vigilance immediately before evaluation increased fact-checking under social settings.” This means that making users feel accountable for what they share can have a powerful effect on their likelihood to blindly share. Twitter could potentially take this approach one step further by making it visible to viewers that the retweeter has not read the URL, similar to their “get the facts” banners that are shown on questionable content. One successful example of the inverse of this can be found on Amazon, whereby the reviews of ‘previous purchasers’ are prioritized and that information is made public to provide better context for the potential buyer. While it is unlikely that Twitter takes this feature to such extremes, one may argue that this would increase perceived accountability and reputation risk on the user and therefore reduce blind sharing. Others may point out that this may be too aggressive of an approach and only push people to open the article but not necessarily read it. This would make for a highly unsubstantial signal.**\n\n**Since the expected reward for sharing unread/unverified content outweighs the potential risk, one way to potentially reduce the spread of misinformation is by increasing the negative consequences of sharing false information. This may be achieved with economic incentives, rewarding users who share content that is found to be true under social consensus with money and status, and, inversely, penalizing users who share content that is discovered to be false. This penalty may not need to be directly financial, but can potentially just reduce their opportunity to earn money or status in the future. Since more influential participants have a stronger effect on propagation, one could place more responsibility on highly influential sharers, punishing or rewarding them more based on the accuracy of what they share. Another approach may be to reduce or increase the rewards depending on the subject matter. If information regarding a rap song is shared, for example, there may be less at stake than when time-sensitive information is shared about a humanitarian crisis.**\n\n**Lastly, social media platforms could attempt to increase the exposure and status achieved from retracting or correcting inaccurate statements. If news media publications’ or individuals’ retractions were fully and directly distributed to their followers / readers, they may have more of an incentive to share them. This could potentially come in the form of a Twitter notification or augmented organic reach for all users that engaged with a now-corrected piece of content. Platforms could even celebrate this kind of behavior, highlighting and providing more exposure at the algorithm-level to users who regularly retract and fact-check themselves. Looking at users’ desire for status and exposure, this may be a successful way to incentivize and normalize corrections/retractions at a larger scale.**\n\n**As online influence becomes a more valuable and sought after asset, the incentive models around information dissemination need to adapt to psychologically guide users to read and fact-check content before sharing it publicly.

A Twitter 'like', for example, is weighted based on the liker's influence, given a token value, and distributed to the tweet's author and all the likers that came before.

Ethereum was mooning. ICOs were pumping. And Jamie wasn't having it. He called Bitcoin a fraud.\n\nI decided to write him an open letter, and the piece went viral. Two days later, he called. He was gracious, thanked me for the explanations in the post, and asked me to spend some time with his team.\n\nBut the funny thing is, I didn't actually write the post for Jamie. I wrote it as a primer for people who were only paying attention to crypto because of the all-time highs. I wanted to explain to them why they should care about crypto, regardless of the price. I called it the Signal in the Noise.\n\nAnd my central point was that crypto makes whole new types of software applications (dapps) and human organization (DAOs) possible. While it was still extremely early, and while prices were disconnected from reality, it nonetheless seemed likely it would lead us to new and important frontiers. That's why we should care.\n\nIncidentally, it's also why we should care right now about NFTs and DeFi, despite similar exuberance. But that will be the subject of another post... perhaps an open letter to Larry Gagosian!\n\nI wrote the original piece on Medium, under an account associated with my company at the time, Chain. That account is [now gone](https://blog.chain.com/a-letter-to-jamie-dimon-de89d417cb80), and thus so is the post. So what better way to inaugurate this new publishing platform, itself enabled by the very ideas I wrote about in the piece, than by re-posting it here on Mirror, where I'll never have to wonder if it's \"still online.\"\n\nFinally, re-reading the post made me cringe at times. I definitely underestimated *just how magical a superpower censorship resistance is* – specifically how it enables permissionless innovation at unheard of cycle times and permissionless collaboration that doesn't need the business models of the past to survive and thrive. Three years is *not a long time ago* and yet web3 is happening **now** and it's very real.\n\nThanks to the Mirror team and community for welcoming me to this platform.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nDear Jamie,\n\nMy name is Adam Ludwin and I run a company called Chain. I have been working in and around the cryptocurrency market for several years.\n\nLast week you said a few things about Bitcoin:\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1e844f2-5256-4da1-87ee-c7947f2ad3ec.jpeg?height=194&width=800)\n\nIt's easy to believe cryptocurrencies have no inherent value. Or that governments will crush them.\n\nIt's also becoming fashionable to believe the opposite: that they will disrupt banks, governments, and Silicon Valley giants once and for all.\n\nNeither extreme is true.\n\nThe reality is nuanced and important. Which is why I've decided to write you this briefing note. I hope it helps you appreciate cryptocurrencies more deeply.\n\n**Let me start by stating that I believe:**\n\n- The market for cryptocurrencies is overheated and irrationally exuberant\n- There are a lot of poseurs creating them, and some scammers, too\n- There are a lot of conflicts of interest, self-serving hype, and obfuscation\n- Very few people in the media understand what's going on\n- Very few people in finance understand what's going on\n- Very few people in technology understand what's going on\n- Very few people in academia or government understand what's going on\n- Very few people buying cryptocurrencies understand what's going on\n- It's very possible I don't understand what's going on\n\nAlso:\n\n- Banks and governments aren't going away\n- Traditional software isn't going away\n\nIn short: there's a lot of noise. But there is also signal. To find it, we need to start by *defining* cryptocurrency.\n\nWithout a working definition we are lost. Most people arguing about cryptocurrencies are talking past each other because they don't stop to ask the other side what they think cryptocurrencies are *for*.\n\n**Here's my definition: cryptocurrencies are a *new asset class* that enable *decentralized applications*.**\n\nIf this is true, your point of view on cryptocurrencies has very little to do with what you think about them in comparison to traditional currencies or securities, and everything to do with your opinion of *decentralized applications and their value relative to current software models*.\n\nDon't have an opinion on decentralized applications? Then you can't possibly have one on cryptocurrencies yet, so read on.\n\nAnd since this isn't about cryptocurrencies vs. fiat currencies let's stop using the word *currency*. It's a head fake. It has way too much baggage and I notice that when you talk about Bitcoin in public you keep comparing it to the Dollar, Euro, and Yen. That comparison won't help you understand what's going on. In fact, it's getting in the way. So for the rest of this note, I will refer to cryptocurrencies as *crypto assets*.\n\nSo, to repeat: crypto assets are a *new asset class* that enable decentralized applications.\n\nAnd like every other asset class, they exist as a mechanism to *allocate resources to a specific form of organization*. Despite the myopic focus on trading crypto assets recently, they don't exist solely to be traded. That is, in principle at least, they don't exist for their own sake.\n\nTo understand what I mean, think about other asset classes and what form of organization they serve:\n\n- Corporate equities serve companies\n- Government bonds serve nations, states, municipalities\n- Mortgages serve property owners\n\nAnd now:\n\n- Crypto assets serve decentralized applications\n\nDecentralized applications are a *new form of organization* and a *new form of software*. They're a new model for creating, financing, and operating software services in a way that is decentralized top-to-bottom. That doesn't make them better or worse than existing software models or corporate entities. As we'll see later, there are trade-offs. What we can say for now is simply that they are radically different from the forms of software and organization we are used to.\n\nHow different? Imagine the following: you grew up in a rainforest and I brought you a cactus and told you it was a tree. How would you react? You'd probably laugh and say it's not a tree because there's no point in a tree being a stumpy water tank covered in armor  —  after all, water is abundant here in the rainforest! This, roughly, is the reaction of many people working in Silicon Valley to decentralized applications and DAOs.\n\nBut I digress. I owe you an important explanation:\n\n**What is a decentralized application?**\n\nA decentralized application is a way to create a service that no single entity operates.\n\nWe'll come to the question of *whether that's useful* in a moment. But first, you need to understand how they work.\n\nLet's go back to the birth of this idea.\n\nIt's November 2008. The nadir of the financial crisis.\n\nAn anonymous person publishes a paper explaining how to make electronic payments without a trusted central party like Chase or PayPal or the Federal Reserve. It's the first *decentralized application* of this kind ever proposed.\n\nIt's a decentralized application *for payments*.\n\nThe paper is titled [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).\n\nHow does it work? How is it possible to send an electronic payment without a designated party who will track and update everyone's balances? If I hand you a dollar that's one thing. But data is not a bearer instrument. Data needs intermediation and validation to be trusted.\n\nThe paper proposes a solution: form a peer-to-peer network. Make it public. Announce your transaction to everyone. In your announcement, point to the specific funds on the network you want to spend. Cryptographically sign your announcement with the same software key that is linked to those funds so we know they're yours.\n\nIt almost works. We need one more thing: a way to make sure that if you broadcast two competing announcements (that is, if you try to spend the same funds twice) that only one of your attempts counts.\n\n*Bad solution:* designate a party to timestamp the transactions and only include the transaction that came first. We're back to square one. We have a trusted intermediary.\n\n*Breakthrough solution:* let entities compete to be the \"timestamper!\" We can't avoid the need for one, but we can avoid designating one in advance or using the same one for every batch of transactions.\n\n\"Let entities compete.\" Sounds like a market economy. What's missing? A reward for winning. An incentive. An asset.\n\nLet's call that asset Bitcoin. Let's call the entities competing for the right to timestamp the latest batch of announced transactions \"miners.\" Let's make sure anyone can join this contest at any time by making the code and network open.\n\nNow we need an actual contest. The paper proposes one. On your mark, get set: find a random number generated by the network! The number is really, really hard to find. So hard that the only way to find it is to use tons of processing power and burn through electricity. It's a computing version of what Veruca Salt made her dad and his poor factory workers do in Willy Wonka. A brute force search for a golden ticket (or in this case, a golden number).\n\n[Actual Bitcoin mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9mba2qb9do)\n\nWhy the elaborate and expensive competition to do something as simple as timestamp transactions for the network? So that we can be sure the competitors have incurred a *real financial cost*. That way, if they win the race to find the random number and become the designated timestamper for a given batch of transactions, they won't use that power for evil (like censoring transactions). Instead, they will meticulously scan each pending transaction, eliminate any attempts by users to spend the same funds twice, ensure all rules are followed, and broadcast the validated batch to the rest of the network.\n\nBecause if they do indeed follow the rules, the network is programmed to reward them...\n\n...with newly minted Bitcoin, plus the transaction fees, denominated in Bitcoin, paid by the senders. (See why they are called miners and not timestampers, now?)\n\nIn other words, miners follow the rules because it is in their economic self-interest to do the right thing.\n\nYou know, like Adam Smith said:\n\nIt is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self interest.\n\nCrypto assets: the invisible hand... of the internet.\n\nBitcoin is capitalism, distilled. You should love it!\n\nAnd since these miners have debts to pay (mostly electricity bills), they will likely sell their newly earned Bitcoins on the open market in exchange for whatever real currency they need to satisfy their liabilities. Anything left is profit. The Bitcoin is now in circulation. People who need it can buy it. And so can people who just want to speculate on it. (More on the people who \"need it\" vs. those who are speculating later.)\n\nEureka! We have killed two birds with one stone: the financial reward that substitutes our need for a trusted central party with a marketplace of competing yet honest timestampers *is the same asset* that ends up in circulation for use as a *digital bearer instrument* in an electronic payments network that has no central party (it's circular, I know).\n\nNow that you understand Bitcoin, let's generalize this to decentralized applications as a whole.\n\n**In general, a decentralized application allows you to do something you can already do today (like payments) but without a trusted central party.**\n\nHere's another example: a decentralized application called Filecoin enables users to store files on a peer-to-peer network of computers instead of in a centralized file storage service like Dropbox or Amazon S3. Its crypto asset, also called Filecoin, incentivizes entities to share excess hard drive space with the network.\n\nDigital file storage is not new. Neither is electronic payments. What's new is that they can be operated without a company. A new form of organization.\n\nOne more example.\n\nWarning: this one is a bit confusing because it's *meta*.\n\nThere's a decentralized application called Ethereum that is *a decentralized application for launching decentralized applications.* I am sure by now you have heard of \"initial coin offerings\" (ICOs) and \"tokens.\" Most of these are issued on top of Ethereum. Instead of building a decentralized application from scratch the way Bitcoin was, you can build one on top of Ethereum much more easily because a) the network already exists and b) it's not designed for a specific application but rather as a platform to build applications that can execute arbitrary code. It is \"featureless.\"\n\nEthereum's protocol incentivizes entities to contribute *computing resources* to the network. Doing so earns these entities Ether, the crypto asset of Ethereum. This makes Ethereum a new kind of computing platform for this new class of software (decentralized apps). It's not cloud computing because Ethereum itself is decentralized (like *aether*, get it?). That's why its founder, Vitalik Buterin, refers to Ethereum as a \"world computer.\"\n\nTo summarize, in just the last few years the world has invented a way to create software services that have no central operator. These services are called decentralized applications and they are enabled with crypto assets that incentivize entities on the internet to contribute resources —  processing, storage, computing  —  necessary for the service to function.\n\nIt's worth pausing to acknowledge that this is kind of *miraculous*. With just the internet, an open protocol, and a new kind of asset, we can instantiate networks that dynamically assemble the resources necessary to provide many kinds of services.\n\nAnd there are a lot of people who think this model is the future of all software, the thing that will finally challenge the FANG stocks and venture capital to boot.\n\nBut there's a problem.\n\nIt's not clear yet that decentralized applications are actually useful to most people relative to traditional software.\n\nSimply put, you cannot argue that for everyone Bitcoin is better than PayPal or Chase. Or that for everyone Filecoin is better than Dropbox or iCloud. Or that for everyone Ethereum is better than Amazon EC2 or Azure.\n\nIn fact, on almost every dimension, decentralized services have key drawbacks relative to their centralized counterparts:\n\n- They are slower\n- They are more expensive\n- They are less scalable\n- They have worse user experiences\n- They have volatile and uncertain governance\n\nAnd no, this isn't just because they are new. This won't fundamentally change with bigger blocks, lightning networks, sharding, forks, self-amending ledgers, or any other technical solutions.\n\nThat's because there are structural trade-offs that result directly from the primary design goal of these services, beneath which all other goals must be subordinated in order for them to be relevant: *decentralization*.\n\nRemember that \"elaborate and expensive competition\" I described? Well, it comes at the cost of throughput. Remember how users need to \"cryptographically sign\" their transaction announcements? Well, those private keys need to be held onto much more securely than a typical password (passwords can be recovered). Remember how \"no single entity operates\" these networks? The flip side is that there is no clear way to make decisions or govern them.\n\nSure, you can make decentralized applications more efficient and user friendly by, for example, centralizing users' cryptographic signing keys (i.e., control of their coins) with a trusted entity. But then we're mostly back to square one and would be better off using a service that is centralized.\n\nThus, bitcoin, for example, isn't best described as \"Decentralized PayPal.\" It's more accurate to say it's an extremely inefficient electronic payments network, *but in exchange we get decentralization*.\n\nBottom line: centralized applications tend to beat decentralized applications on virtually every dimension.\n\n**EXCEPT FOR ONE DIMENSION.**\n\nAnd not only are decentralized applications better at this one thing, they are the only way we can achieve it.\n\nWhat am I referring to?\n\n**Censorship resistance.**\n\nThis is where we come to the elusive signal in the noise.\n\nCensorship resistance means that access to decentralized applications is open and unfettered. Transactions on these services are *unstoppable*.\n\nMore concretely, nothing can stop me from sending Bitcoin to anyone I please. Nothing can stop me from executing code on Ethereum. Nothing can stop me from storing files on Filecoin. As long as I have an internet connection and pay the network's transaction fee, denominated in its crypto asset, I am free to do what I want.\n\n(If Bitcoin is capitalism distilled, it's also a kind of freedom distilled.)\n\nAnd for crypto enthusiasts that don't want to take my word for it, will you listen to Adam Back and Charlie Lee?\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ee4fbcb7-432a-4282-8752-caec90dc8210.jpeg?height=212&width=691)\n\n**So while we can't say \"for everyone Bitcoin is better than Visa,\" it is possible that for some cohort of users Bitcoin truly is the only way to make a payment.**\n\nMore generally, we can ask:\n\nFor whom is this the right trade-off?\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/06abc035-7c45-45d0-a505-58a7d0de5a67.jpeg?height=339&width=717)\n\nWho needs censorship resistance so much that they are willing to trade away the speed, cost, scalability, and experience benefits of centralized services?\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying you have to make this trade-off *in order to buy/speculate on crypto assets.* I am saying that in order for decentralized applications themselves to have utility to some cohort, that cohort must be optimizing for censorship resistance.\n\n**So, who are these people?**\n\nWhile there is not a lot of good data, actual *users* of decentralized applications seem to fall into two categories:\n\n1. People who are off the grid: that is, in countries where access to competently operated traditional services is limited (for any number of reasons) but where internet is not\n\n2. People who want to be off the grid: that is, people who don't want their transactions censored or known\n\nWith that framework in mind we can ask:\n\n- For whom is Bitcoin the best/only way to make a payment?\n- For whom is Filecoin the best/only way to store a file?\n- For whom is Ethereum the best/only way to compute code?\n\nThese are the questions that get at the heart of the value proposition of the technology.\n\nSo far, most decentralized applications have very little use relative to traditional services. Bitcoin, for example, has fewer mainstream merchants accepting it as a payment option in the U.S. today than in 2014. And for all the talk of Bitcoin's value as a payments system in developing countries or emerging markets like China, it is traditional software (i.e., apps) like AliPay and Paytm that are actually driving sweeping change in payments in these markets.\n\nAt the same time, use of Bitcoin on the dark web and for ransomware is evident, even if it is hard to get good data.\n\nBut aren't people using Bitcoin as a \"store of value?\" Sure, which is just another way of saying people are investing in Bitcoin with a long time horizon. But remember I'm not talking about investing in the crypto asset yet. I'm talking about whether there are people who find a *decentralized application for payments* (which is enabled by that asset) useful. Real estate is only a good store of value *in the long run* if people live and work in the buildings. The same is true of decentralized applications.\n\nWhat should we make of Ethereum evaluated through the \"censorship resistance\" lens? After all, it seems to be getting a ton of use by developers. Since Ethereum is a developer platform for decentralized applications, does that mean it is developers who have been censored or blocked somehow? In a way, yes. Developers and start-ups who wish to build financial products do not have open and unfettered access to the world's financial infrastructure. While Ethereum doesn't provide access to that infrastructure, it does provide a different infrastructure that can be used to, for example, create and execute a financial contract.\n\nSince Ethereum is a platform, its value is ultimately a function of the value of the applications built on top. In other words, we can ask if Ethereum is useful by simply asking if anything that has been built on Ethereum is useful. For example, do we need censorship resistant prediction markets? Censorship resistant meme playing cards? Censorship resistant versions of YouTube or Twitter? What are – or will be – the killer applications on Ethereum?\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nGiven how different they are from the app models we know and love, will anyone *ever really use* decentralized applications? Will they become a critical part of the economy? It's hard to predict because it depends in part on the technology's evolution but far more on society's reaction to it.\n\nFor example: until relatively recently, encrypted messaging was only used by hackers, spies, and paranoids. That didn't seem to be changing. Until it did. Post-Snowden and post-Trump, everyone from Silicon Valley to the Acela corridor seems to be on either Signal or Telegram. WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted. The press solicit tips through SecureDrop. Yes, the technology got a little better and easier to use. But it is mainly changes in society that are driving adoption.\n\nIn other words, we grew up in the rainforest, but sometimes things change and it helps to know how to adapt to other environments.\n\nAnd this is the basic argument that the smart money is making on crypto assets and decentralized applications: that it's simply too early to say anything. That it is a profound change. That, should one or more of these decentralized applications actually become an integral part of the world, their underlying crypto assets will be extremely valuable. So might as well start placing bets now and see how it goes. Don't get to hung up on whether we see the killer apps yet.\n\nThat's not a bad argument and I tend to agree.\n\n**I would summarize the argument as:** in the long-run, a crypto asset's value is driven by use of the decentralized application it enables. While it's early, the high valuations are justified because even if the probability of mass adoption is small, the impact would be very large, so might as well go along for the ride and see what happens.\n\n**But how do we explain the recent mania?**\n\nBitcoin is up 5x in a year, Ethereum is up 30x. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is ~$175B, up from $12B just a year ago. Why?\n\nAs in every mania in history, it is currently rational to be irrational.\n\nTo understand what's going on, let's look at the buyer and seller mentality right now, starting with the buyers.\n\nIf you invested early in Bitcoin or Ethereum, you are sitting on a windfall. It feels like you are playing with \"house money,\" [a well-known psychological effect](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/1154/thaler_and_johnson.pdf). You feel smart and willing to risk more than you otherwise would if it was \"your money.\" Might as well diversify a bit and parlay your gains into the next crypto asset, or two, or three.\n\nIf you *didn't* invest, the fear-of-missing-out continues to build until the \"screw it\" moment when you buy in. Maybe you read about Bitcoin, didn't understand it, and followed Warren Buffet's (typically good) advice not to invest in things you don't understand. Some of your friends made money but you still ignored it. Then you read about Ethereum, which you *really* didn't understand, also passed on buying, and later found out that your friends are planning to retire because they did. The lesson seems to be *anti-Buffet*: only invest in things you *don't understand*. This is causing people to check their judgement at the door when the latest all-time high finally convinces them to jump into the market.\n\nAnd that is not good.\n\nBecause there will be sellers to fill the demand, especially the demand coming from people who have decided they will never understand this stuff so will just place bets on things that *sound complex and impressive.*\n\nLet's think about these sellers. And by sellers, I don't mean people selling their holdings of existing crypto assets. I mean new issuers. Teams launching new crypto assets.\n\nThe basic model is to pre-sell some percentage of the crypto assets the proposed network will generate as a way to fund the development of the decentralized application before it launches. The project founders tend to hold on to some percentage of these assets. Which means that raising money for a project this way is a) non-dilutive as it is not equity and b) not debt, so you never have to pay anyone back. This is basically free money. It's never been this good for entrepreneurs, even in the 90s dot-com boom. Which makes it incredibly tempting to try and shoe-horn every project that *could perhaps* justify an \"initial coin offering\" to go for it, even if they aren't actually building a *decentralized* application. After all, an ICO lets you exit before you even launch.\n\nAnd there is a pervasive narrative out there that supports entrepreneurs looking to create new crypto assets. The idea is that by selling assets to users before your network launches, you create \"evangelists\" who will be early users and promoters you wouldn't otherwise have if there were no financial incentive to participate in your community.\n\nThe problem with this line of thinking is that it conflates early *investors* with early *users*. The overlap between people who buy your crypto asset and people who actually want to use the service you are building is likely very, very small, especially during market manias like this one. It creates a false sense of \"product-market fit.\" Yes, people are buying your crypto asset. But that's because the \"market\" are people who want to get rich and the \"product\" you are selling is a \"way to get rich.\"\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c381a715-69d6-4b9f-ae99-f7066c7b4150.jpeg?height=345&width=727)\n\nBut \"this is fine.\"\n\nEveryone's making money. For now.\n\nIt's currently rational to be irrational.\n\nAs long as that blue line keeps going up.\n\n> Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked.\n\n**At the same time, I wouldn't bet against crypto assets.**\n\n> He who lives by the crystal ball will eat shattered glass.\n\nConsider the following. The total market cap of crypto assets has been increasing by an *order of magnitude* every few years. Where will they be in 2022? It's certain that many (most?) of the crypto assets launching today won't make it. But neither did most of the ones that were launched back in the 2013/4 boom (when they were referred to as \"alt coins\"). Though an important alt coin from 2014 did stick around and drove the most recent boom to new heights by being the platform to power all the others: Ethereum.\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/97c6751e-3218-4407-a71f-e00e0fe3babe.jpeg?height=190&width=721)\n\n**So, Jamie, what's the bottom line?**\n\nAllow me to summarize.\n\n- Cryptocurrencies (which I prefer to call crypto assets) are a new asset class that enable decentralized applications\n\n- Decentralized applications enable services we already have today, like payments, storage, or computing, but without a central operator of those services\n\n- Today, this software model is useful to people who need censorship resistance which tend to be people that are either off the grid or who want to be off the grid\n\n- For now, most people are better off using normal applications because they are 10x better on every other dimension\n\n- Society's embrace or rejection of new technology is hard to predict (think about encrypted messaging)\n\n- In the long-run, the value of a crypto asset will rise and fall in proportion to the use of the decentralized applications it enables\n\n- In the short-run, there will be extreme volatility as FOMO competes with FUD, confusion competes with understanding, and greed competes with fear (on both the buyer side and the issuer side)\n\n- Most people buying into crypto assets have checked their judgement at the door\n\n- Many sellers of new crypto assets aren't actually building decentralized applications but are instead shoe-horning an ICO into their service because of the market mania; that doesn't mean decentralized applications are bad, it just means people are capitalizing on the confusion and are probably themselves confused\n\n- Don't bet against crypto assets in the long-run: as we approach the 10 year anniversary of the Bitcoin paper it is clear that they aren't going anywhere and that decentralized applications may very well find an important place alongside all the other forms of organization we have come to take for granted.\n\nBest,\nAdam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1614664022, "digest": "Q-HIDLBN0lRy1ezLFI-Qj5JhLzHWRUgXF4cqwieQWXQ", "contributor": "0x8a32Af4AfFD816978C2Fdfa7C08c27681d05d4Fe"}

Ethereum was mooning. ICOs were pumping. And Jamie wasn't having it. He called Bitcoin a fraud.\n\nI decided to write him an open letter, and the piece went viral. Two days later, he called. He was gracious, thanked me for the explanations in the post, and asked me to spend some time with his team.\n\nBut the funny thing is, I didn't actually write the post for Jamie. I wrote it as a primer for people who were only paying attention to crypto because of the all-time highs. I wanted to explain to them why they should care about crypto, regardless of the price. I called it the Signal in the Noise.\n\nAnd my central point was that crypto makes whole new types of software applications (dapps) and human organization (DAOs) possible. While it was still extremely early, and while prices were disconnected from reality, it nonetheless seemed likely it would lead us to new and important frontiers. That's why we should care.\n\nIncidentally, it's also why we should care right now about NFTs and DeFi, despite similar exuberance. But that will be the subject of another post... perhaps an open letter to Larry Gagosian!\n\nI wrote the original piece on Medium, under an account associated with my company at the time, Chain. That account is [now gone](https://blog.chain.com/a-letter-to-jamie-dimon-de89d417cb80), and thus so is the post. So what better way to inaugurate this new publishing platform, itself enabled by the very ideas I wrote about in the piece, than by re-posting it here on Mirror, where I'll never have to wonder if it's \"still online.\"\n\nFinally, re-reading the post made me cringe at times. I definitely underestimated *just how magical a superpower censorship resistance is* – specifically how it enables permissionless innovation at unheard of cycle times and permissionless collaboration that doesn't need the business models of the past to survive and thrive. Three years is *not a long time ago* and yet web3 is happening **now** and it's very real.\n\nThanks to the Mirror team and community for welcoming me to this platform.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n(Originally published October 2017)\n\nDear Jamie,\n\nMy name is Adam Ludwin and I run a company called Chain. I have been working in and around the cryptocurrency market for several years.\n\nLast week you said a few things about Bitcoin:\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1e844f2-5256-4da1-87ee-c7947f2ad3ec.jpeg?height=194&width=800)\n\nIt's easy to believe cryptocurrencies have no inherent value. Or that governments will crush them.\n\nIt's also becoming fashionable to believe the opposite: that they will disrupt banks, governments, and Silicon Valley giants once and for all.\n\nNeither extreme is true.\n\nThe reality is nuanced and important. Which is why I've decided to write you this briefing note. I hope it helps you appreciate cryptocurrencies more deeply.\n\n**Let me start by stating that I believe:**\n\n- The market for cryptocurrencies is overheated and irrationally exuberant\n- There are a lot of poseurs creating them, and some scammers, too\n- There are a lot of conflicts of interest, self-serving hype, and obfuscation\n- Very few people in the media understand what's going on\n- Very few people in finance understand what's going on\n- Very few people in technology understand what's going on\n- Very few people in academia or government understand what's going on\n- Very few people buying cryptocurrencies understand what's going on\n- It's very possible I don't understand what's going on\n\nAlso:\n\n- Banks and governments aren't going away\n- Traditional software isn't going away\n\nIn short: there's a lot of noise. But there is also signal. To find it, we need to start by *defining* cryptocurrency.\n\nWithout a working definition we are lost. Most people arguing about cryptocurrencies are talking past each other because they don't stop to ask the other side what they think cryptocurrencies are *for*.\n\n**Here's my definition: cryptocurrencies are a *new asset class* that enable *decentralized applications*.**\n\nIf this is true, your point of view on cryptocurrencies has very little to do with what you think about them in comparison to traditional currencies or securities, and everything to do with your opinion of *decentralized applications and their value relative to current software models*.\n\nDon't have an opinion on decentralized applications? Then you can't possibly have one on cryptocurrencies yet, so read on.\n\nAnd since this isn't about cryptocurrencies vs. fiat currencies let's stop using the word *currency*. It's a head fake. It has way too much baggage and I notice that when you talk about Bitcoin in public you keep comparing it to the Dollar, Euro, and Yen. That comparison won't help you understand what's going on. In fact, it's getting in the way. So for the rest of this note, I will refer to cryptocurrencies as *crypto assets*.\n\nSo, to repeat: crypto assets are a *new asset class* that enable decentralized applications.\n\nAnd like every other asset class, they exist as a mechanism to *allocate resources to a specific form of organization*. Despite the myopic focus on trading crypto assets recently, they don't exist solely to be traded. That is, in principle at least, they don't exist for their own sake.\n\nTo understand what I mean, think about other asset classes and what form of organization they serve:\n\n- Corporate equities serve companies\n- Government bonds serve nations, states, municipalities\n- Mortgages serve property owners\n\nAnd now:\n\n- Crypto assets serve decentralized applications\n\nDecentralized applications are a *new form of organization* and a *new form of software*. They're a new model for creating, financing, and operating software services in a way that is decentralized top-to-bottom. That doesn't make them better or worse than existing software models or corporate entities. As we'll see later, there are trade-offs. What we can say for now is simply that they are radically different from the forms of software and organization we are used to.\n\nHow different? Imagine the following: you grew up in a rainforest and I brought you a cactus and told you it was a tree. How would you react? You'd probably laugh and say it's not a tree because there's no point in a tree being a stumpy water tank covered in armor  —  after all, water is abundant here in the rainforest! This, roughly, is the reaction of many people working in Silicon Valley to decentralized applications and DAOs.\n\nBut I digress. I owe you an important explanation:\n\n**What is a decentralized application?**\n\nA decentralized application is a way to create a service that no single entity operates.\n\nWe'll come to the question of *whether that's useful* in a moment. But first, you need to understand how they work.\n\nLet's go back to the birth of this idea.\n\nIt's November 2008. The nadir of the financial crisis.\n\nAn anonymous person publishes a paper explaining how to make electronic payments without a trusted central party like Chase or PayPal or the Federal Reserve. It's the first *decentralized application* of this kind ever proposed.\n\nIt's a decentralized application *for payments*.\n\nThe paper is titled [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).\n\nHow does it work? How is it possible to send an electronic payment without a designated party who will track and update everyone's balances? If I hand you a dollar that's one thing. But data is not a bearer instrument. Data needs intermediation and validation to be trusted.\n\nThe paper proposes a solution: form a peer-to-peer network. Make it public. Announce your transaction to everyone. In your announcement, point to the specific funds on the network you want to spend. Cryptographically sign your announcement with the same software key that is linked to those funds so we know they're yours.\n\nIt almost works. We need one more thing: a way to make sure that if you broadcast two competing announcements (that is, if you try to spend the same funds twice) that only one of your attempts counts.\n\n*Bad solution:* designate a party to timestamp the transactions and only include the transaction that came first. We're back to square one. We have a trusted intermediary.\n\n*Breakthrough solution:* let entities compete to be the \"timestamper!\" We can't avoid the need for one, but we can avoid designating one in advance or using the same one for every batch of transactions.\n\n\"Let entities compete.\" Sounds like a market economy. What's missing? A reward for winning. An incentive. An asset.\n\nLet's call that asset Bitcoin. Let's call the entities competing for the right to timestamp the latest batch of announced transactions \"miners.\" Let's make sure anyone can join this contest at any time by making the code and network open.\n\nNow we need an actual contest. The paper proposes one. On your mark, get set: find a random number generated by the network! The number is really, really hard to find. So hard that the only way to find it is to use tons of processing power and burn through electricity. It's a computing version of what Veruca Salt made her dad and his poor factory workers do in Willy Wonka. A brute force search for a golden ticket (or in this case, a golden number).\n\n[Actual Bitcoin mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9mba2qb9do)\n\nWhy the elaborate and expensive competition to do something as simple as timestamp transactions for the network? So that we can be sure the competitors have incurred a *real financial cost*. That way, if they win the race to find the random number and become the designated timestamper for a given batch of transactions, they won't use that power for evil (like censoring transactions). Instead, they will meticulously scan each pending transaction, eliminate any attempts by users to spend the same funds twice, ensure all rules are followed, and broadcast the validated batch to the rest of the network.\n\nBecause if they do indeed follow the rules, the network is programmed to reward them...\n\n...with newly minted Bitcoin, plus the transaction fees, denominated in Bitcoin, paid by the senders. (See why they are called miners and not timestampers, now?)\n\nIn other words, miners follow the rules because it is in their economic self-interest to do the right thing.\n\nYou know, like Adam Smith said:\n\nIt is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self interest.\n\nCrypto assets: the invisible hand... of the internet.\n\nBitcoin is capitalism, distilled. You should love it!\n\nAnd since these miners have debts to pay (mostly electricity bills), they will likely sell their newly earned Bitcoins on the open market in exchange for whatever real currency they need to satisfy their liabilities. Anything left is profit. The Bitcoin is now in circulation. People who need it can buy it. And so can people who just want to speculate on it. (More on the people who \"need it\" vs. those who are speculating later.)\n\nEureka! We have killed two birds with one stone: the financial reward that substitutes our need for a trusted central party with a marketplace of competing yet honest timestampers *is the same asset* that ends up in circulation for use as a *digital bearer instrument* in an electronic payments network that has no central party (it's circular, I know).\n\nNow that you understand Bitcoin, let's generalize this to decentralized applications as a whole.\n\n**In general, a decentralized application allows you to do something you can already do today (like payments) but without a trusted central party.**\n\nHere's another example: a decentralized application called Filecoin enables users to store files on a peer-to-peer network of computers instead of in a centralized file storage service like Dropbox or Amazon S3. Its crypto asset, also called Filecoin, incentivizes entities to share excess hard drive space with the network.\n\nDigital file storage is not new. Neither is electronic payments. What's new is that they can be operated without a company. A new form of organization.\n\nOne more example.\n\nWarning: this one is a bit confusing because it's *meta*.\n\nThere's a decentralized application called Ethereum that is *a decentralized application for launching decentralized applications.* I am sure by now you have heard of \"initial coin offerings\" (ICOs) and \"tokens.\" Most of these are issued on top of Ethereum. Instead of building a decentralized application from scratch the way Bitcoin was, you can build one on top of Ethereum much more easily because a) the network already exists and b) it's not designed for a specific application but rather as a platform to build applications that can execute arbitrary code. It is \"featureless.\"\n\nEthereum's protocol incentivizes entities to contribute *computing resources* to the network. Doing so earns these entities Ether, the crypto asset of Ethereum. This makes Ethereum a new kind of computing platform for this new class of software (decentralized apps). It's not cloud computing because Ethereum itself is decentralized (like *aether*, get it?). That's why its founder, Vitalik Buterin, refers to Ethereum as a \"world computer.\"\n\nTo summarize, in just the last few years the world has invented a way to create software services that have no central operator. These services are called decentralized applications and they are enabled with crypto assets that incentivize entities on the internet to contribute resources —  processing, storage, computing  —  necessary for the service to function.\n\nIt's worth pausing to acknowledge that this is kind of *miraculous*. With just the internet, an open protocol, and a new kind of asset, we can instantiate networks that dynamically assemble the resources necessary to provide many kinds of services.\n\nAnd there are a lot of people who think this model is the future of all software, the thing that will finally challenge the FANG stocks and venture capital to boot.\n\nBut there's a problem.\n\nIt's not clear yet that decentralized applications are actually useful to most people relative to traditional software.\n\nSimply put, you cannot argue that for everyone Bitcoin is better than PayPal or Chase. Or that for everyone Filecoin is better than Dropbox or iCloud. Or that for everyone Ethereum is better than Amazon EC2 or Azure.\n\nIn fact, on almost every dimension, decentralized services have key drawbacks relative to their centralized counterparts:\n\n- They are slower\n- They are more expensive\n- They are less scalable\n- They have worse user experiences\n- They have volatile and uncertain governance\n\nAnd no, this isn't just because they are new. This won't fundamentally change with bigger blocks, lightning networks, sharding, forks, self-amending ledgers, or any other technical solutions.\n\nThat's because there are structural trade-offs that result directly from the primary design goal of these services, beneath which all other goals must be subordinated in order for them to be relevant: *decentralization*.\n\nRemember that \"elaborate and expensive competition\" I described? Well, it comes at the cost of throughput. Remember how users need to \"cryptographically sign\" their transaction announcements? Well, those private keys need to be held onto much more securely than a typical password (passwords can be recovered). Remember how \"no single entity operates\" these networks? The flip side is that there is no clear way to make decisions or govern them.\n\nSure, you can make decentralized applications more efficient and user friendly by, for example, centralizing users' cryptographic signing keys (i.e., control of their coins) with a trusted entity. But then we're mostly back to square one and would be better off using a service that is centralized.\n\nThus, bitcoin, for example, isn't best described as \"Decentralized PayPal.\" It's more accurate to say it's an extremely inefficient electronic payments network, *but in exchange we get decentralization*.\n\nBottom line: centralized applications tend to beat decentralized applications on virtually every dimension.\n\n**EXCEPT FOR ONE DIMENSION.**\n\nAnd not only are decentralized applications better at this one thing, they are the only way we can achieve it.\n\nWhat am I referring to?\n\n**Censorship resistance.**\n\nThis is where we come to the elusive signal in the noise.\n\nCensorship resistance means that access to decentralized applications is open and unfettered. Transactions on these services are *unstoppable*.\n\nMore concretely, nothing can stop me from sending Bitcoin to anyone I please. Nothing can stop me from executing code on Ethereum. Nothing can stop me from storing files on Filecoin. As long as I have an internet connection and pay the network's transaction fee, denominated in its crypto asset, I am free to do what I want.\n\n(If Bitcoin is capitalism distilled, it's also a kind of freedom distilled.)\n\nAnd for crypto enthusiasts that don't want to take my word for it, will you listen to Adam Back and Charlie Lee?\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ee4fbcb7-432a-4282-8752-caec90dc8210.jpeg?height=212&width=691)\n\n**So while we can't say \"for everyone Bitcoin is better than Visa,\" it is possible that for some cohort of users Bitcoin truly is the only way to make a payment.**\n\nMore generally, we can ask:\n\nFor whom is this the right trade-off?\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/06abc035-7c45-45d0-a505-58a7d0de5a67.jpeg?height=339&width=717)\n\nWho needs censorship resistance so much that they are willing to trade away the speed, cost, scalability, and experience benefits of centralized services?\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying you have to make this trade-off *in order to buy/speculate on crypto assets.* I am saying that in order for decentralized applications themselves to have utility to some cohort, that cohort must be optimizing for censorship resistance.\n\n**So, who are these people?**\n\nWhile there is not a lot of good data, actual *users* of decentralized applications seem to fall into two categories:\n\n1. People who are off the grid: that is, in countries where access to competently operated traditional services is limited (for any number of reasons) but where internet is not\n\n2. People who want to be off the grid: that is, people who don't want their transactions censored or known\n\nWith that framework in mind we can ask:\n\n- For whom is Bitcoin the best/only way to make a payment?\n- For whom is Filecoin the best/only way to store a file?\n- For whom is Ethereum the best/only way to compute code?\n\nThese are the questions that get at the heart of the value proposition of the technology.\n\nSo far, most decentralized applications have very little use relative to traditional services. Bitcoin, for example, has fewer mainstream merchants accepting it as a payment option in the U.S. today than in 2014. And for all the talk of Bitcoin's value as a payments system in developing countries or emerging markets like China, it is traditional software (i.e., apps) like AliPay and Paytm that are actually driving sweeping change in payments in these markets.\n\nAt the same time, use of Bitcoin on the dark web and for ransomware is evident, even if it is hard to get good data.\n\nBut aren't people using Bitcoin as a \"store of value?\" Sure, which is just another way of saying people are investing in Bitcoin with a long time horizon. But remember I'm not talking about investing in the crypto asset yet. I'm talking about whether there are people who find a *decentralized application for payments* (which is enabled by that asset) useful. Real estate is only a good store of value *in the long run* if people live and work in the buildings. The same is true of decentralized applications.\n\nWhat should we make of Ethereum evaluated through the \"censorship resistance\" lens? After all, it seems to be getting a ton of use by developers. Since Ethereum is a developer platform for decentralized applications, does that mean it is developers who have been censored or blocked somehow? In a way, yes. Developers and start-ups who wish to build financial products do not have open and unfettered access to the world's financial infrastructure. While Ethereum doesn't provide access to that infrastructure, it does provide a different infrastructure that can be used to, for example, create and execute a financial contract.\n\nSince Ethereum is a platform, its value is ultimately a function of the value of the applications built on top. In other words, we can ask if Ethereum is useful by simply asking if anything that has been built on Ethereum is useful. For example, do we need censorship resistant prediction markets? Censorship resistant meme playing cards? Censorship resistant versions of YouTube or Twitter? What are – or will be – the killer applications on Ethereum?\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nGiven how different they are from the app models we know and love, will anyone *ever really use* decentralized applications? Will they become a critical part of the economy? It's hard to predict because it depends in part on the technology's evolution but far more on society's reaction to it.\n\nFor example: until relatively recently, encrypted messaging was only used by hackers, spies, and paranoids. That didn't seem to be changing. Until it did. Post-Snowden and post-Trump, everyone from Silicon Valley to the Acela corridor seems to be on either Signal or Telegram. WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted. The press solicit tips through SecureDrop. Yes, the technology got a little better and easier to use. But it is mainly changes in society that are driving adoption.\n\nIn other words, we grew up in the rainforest, but sometimes things change and it helps to know how to adapt to other environments.\n\nAnd this is the basic argument that the smart money is making on crypto assets and decentralized applications: that it's simply too early to say anything. That it is a profound change. That, should one or more of these decentralized applications actually become an integral part of the world, their underlying crypto assets will be extremely valuable. So might as well start placing bets now and see how it goes. Don't get to hung up on whether we see the killer apps yet.\n\nThat's not a bad argument and I tend to agree.\n\n**I would summarize the argument as:** in the long-run, a crypto asset's value is driven by use of the decentralized application it enables. While it's early, the high valuations are justified because even if the probability of mass adoption is small, the impact would be very large, so might as well go along for the ride and see what happens.\n\n**But how do we explain the recent mania?**\n\nBitcoin is up 5x in a year, Ethereum is up 30x. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is ~$175B, up from $12B just a year ago. Why?\n\nAs in every mania in history, it is currently rational to be irrational.\n\nTo understand what's going on, let's look at the buyer and seller mentality right now, starting with the buyers.\n\nIf you invested early in Bitcoin or Ethereum, you are sitting on a windfall. It feels like you are playing with \"house money,\" [a well-known psychological effect](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/1154/thaler_and_johnson.pdf). You feel smart and willing to risk more than you otherwise would if it was \"your money.\" Might as well diversify a bit and parlay your gains into the next crypto asset, or two, or three.\n\nIf you *didn't* invest, the fear-of-missing-out continues to build until the \"screw it\" moment when you buy in. Maybe you read about Bitcoin, didn't understand it, and followed Warren Buffet's (typically good) advice not to invest in things you don't understand. Some of your friends made money but you still ignored it. Then you read about Ethereum, which you *really* didn't understand, also passed on buying, and later found out that your friends are planning to retire because they did. The lesson seems to be *anti-Buffet*: only invest in things you *don't understand*. This is causing people to check their judgement at the door when the latest all-time high finally convinces them to jump into the market.\n\nAnd that is not good.\n\nBecause there will be sellers to fill the demand, especially the demand coming from people who have decided they will never understand this stuff so will just place bets on things that *sound complex and impressive.*\n\nLet's think about these sellers. And by sellers, I don't mean people selling their holdings of existing crypto assets. I mean new issuers. Teams launching new crypto assets.\n\nThe basic model is to pre-sell some percentage of the crypto assets the proposed network will generate as a way to fund the development of the decentralized application before it launches. The project founders tend to hold on to some percentage of these assets. Which means that raising money for a project this way is a) non-dilutive as it is not equity and b) not debt, so you never have to pay anyone back. This is basically free money. It's never been this good for entrepreneurs, even in the 90s dot-com boom. Which makes it incredibly tempting to try and shoe-horn every project that *could perhaps* justify an \"initial coin offering\" to go for it, even if they aren't actually building a *decentralized* application. After all, an ICO lets you exit before you even launch.\n\nAnd there is a pervasive narrative out there that supports entrepreneurs looking to create new crypto assets. The idea is that by selling assets to users before your network launches, you create \"evangelists\" who will be early users and promoters you wouldn't otherwise have if there were no financial incentive to participate in your community.\n\nThe problem with this line of thinking is that it conflates early *investors* with early *users*. The overlap between people who buy your crypto asset and people who actually want to use the service you are building is likely very, very small, especially during market manias like this one. It creates a false sense of \"product-market fit.\" Yes, people are buying your crypto asset. But that's because the \"market\" are people who want to get rich and the \"product\" you are selling is a \"way to get rich.\"\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c381a715-69d6-4b9f-ae99-f7066c7b4150.jpeg?height=345&width=727)\n\nBut \"this is fine.\"\n\nEveryone's making money. For now.\n\nIt's currently rational to be irrational.\n\nAs long as that blue line keeps going up.\n\n> Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked.\n\n**At the same time, I wouldn't bet against crypto assets.**\n\n> He who lives by the crystal ball will eat shattered glass.\n\nConsider the following. The total market cap of crypto assets has been increasing by an *order of magnitude* every few years. Where will they be in 2022? It's certain that many (most?) of the crypto assets launching today won't make it. But neither did most of the ones that were launched back in the 2013/4 boom (when they were referred to as \"alt coins\"). Though an important alt coin from 2014 did stick around and drove the most recent boom to new heights by being the platform to power all the others: Ethereum.\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/97c6751e-3218-4407-a71f-e00e0fe3babe.jpeg?height=190&width=721)\n\n**So, Jamie, what's the bottom line?**\n\nAllow me to summarize.\n\n- Cryptocurrencies (which I prefer to call crypto assets) are a new asset class that enable decentralized applications\n\n- Decentralized applications enable services we already have today, like payments, storage, or computing, but without a central operator of those services\n\n- Today, this software model is useful to people who need censorship resistance which tend to be people that are either off the grid or who want to be off the grid\n\n- For now, most people are better off using normal applications because they are 10x better on every other dimension\n\n- Society's embrace or rejection of new technology is hard to predict (think about encrypted messaging)\n\n- In the long-run, the value of a crypto asset will rise and fall in proportion to the use of the decentralized applications it enables\n\n- In the short-run, there will be extreme volatility as FOMO competes with FUD, confusion competes with understanding, and greed competes with fear (on both the buyer side and the issuer side)\n\n- Most people buying into crypto assets have checked their judgement at the door\n\n- Many sellers of new crypto assets aren't actually building decentralized applications but are instead shoe-horning an ICO into their service because of the market mania; that doesn't mean decentralized applications are bad, it just means people are capitalizing on the confusion and are probably themselves confused\n\n- Don't bet against crypto assets in the long-run: as we approach the 10 year anniversary of the Bitcoin paper it is clear that they aren't going anywhere and that decentralized applications may very well find an important place alongside all the other forms of organization we have come to take for granted.\n\nBest,\nAdam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1614664377, "digest": "Q-HIDLBN0lRy1ezLFI-Qj5JhLzHWRUgXF4cqwieQWXQ", "contributor": "0x8a32Af4AfFD816978C2Fdfa7C08c27681d05d4Fe"}

Ethereum was mooning. ICOs were pumping. And Jamie wasn't having it. He called Bitcoin a fraud.\n\nI decided to write him an open letter, and the piece went viral. Two days later, he called. He was gracious, thanked me for the explanations in the post, and asked me to spend some time with his team.\n\nBut the funny thing is, I didn't write the post for Jamie. I wrote it as a primer for people who were only paying attention to crypto because of the all-time highs. I wanted to explain to them why they should care about crypto, regardless of the price. I called it the Signal in the Noise.\n\nAnd my central point was that crypto makes whole new types of software applications (dapps) and human organization (DAOs) possible. While it was still extremely early, and while prices were disconnected from reality, it nonetheless seemed likely it would lead us to new and important frontiers. That's why we should care.\n\nIncidentally, it's also why we should care right now about NFTs and DeFi, despite similar exuberance. But that will be the subject of another post... perhaps an open letter to Larry Gagosian!\n\nI wrote the original piece on Medium, under an account associated with my company at the time, Chain.

I have been working in and around the cryptocurrency market for several years.\n\nLast week you said a few things about Bitcoin:\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1e844f2-5256-4da1-87ee-c7947f2ad3ec.jpeg?height=194&width=800)\n\nIt's easy to believe cryptocurrencies have no inherent value. Or that governments will crush them.\n\nIt's also becoming fashionable to believe the opposite: that they will disrupt banks, governments, and Silicon Valley giants once and for all.\n\nNeither extreme is true.\n\nThe reality is nuanced and important. Which is why I've decided to write you this briefing note. I hope it helps you appreciate cryptocurrencies more deeply.\n\n**Let me start by stating that I believe:**\n\n- The market for cryptocurrencies is overheated and irrationally exuberant\n- There are a lot of poseurs creating them, and some scammers, too\n- There are a lot of conflicts of interest, self-serving hype, and obfuscation\n- Very few people in the media understand what's going on\n- Very few people in finance understand what's going on\n- Very few people in technology understand what's going on\n- Very few people in academia or government understand what's going on\n- Very few people buying cryptocurrencies understand what's going on\n- It's very possible I don't understand what's going on\n\nAlso:\n\n- Banks and governments aren't going away\n- Traditional software isn't going away\n\nIn short: there's a lot of noise. But there is also signal. To find it, we need to start by *defining* cryptocurrency.\n\nWithout a working definition we are lost. Most people arguing about cryptocurrencies are talking past each other because they don't stop to ask the other side what they think cryptocurrencies are *for*.\n\n**Here's my definition: cryptocurrencies are a *new asset class* that enable *decentralized applications*.**\n\nIf this is true, your point of view on cryptocurrencies has very little to do with what you think about them in comparison to traditional currencies or securities, and everything to do with your opinion of *decentralized applications and their value relative to current software models*.\n\nDon't have an opinion on decentralized applications? Then you can't possibly have one on cryptocurrencies yet, so read on.\n\nAnd since this isn't about cryptocurrencies vs. fiat currencies let's stop using the word *currency*. It's a head fake. It has way too much baggage and I notice that when you talk about Bitcoin in public you keep comparing it to the Dollar, Euro, and Yen. That comparison won't help you understand what's going on. In fact, it's getting in the way. So for the rest of this note, I will refer to cryptocurrencies as *crypto assets*.\n\nSo, to repeat: crypto assets are a *new asset class* that enable decentralized applications.\n\nAnd like every other asset class, they exist as a mechanism to *allocate resources to a specific form of organization*. Despite the myopic focus on trading crypto assets recently, they don't exist solely to be traded. That is, in principle at least, they don't exist for their own sake.\n\nTo understand what I mean, think about other asset classes and what form of organization they serve:\n\n- Corporate equities serve companies\n- Government bonds serve nations, states, municipalities\n- Mortgages serve property owners\n\nAnd now:\n\n- Crypto assets serve decentralized applications\n\nDecentralized applications are a *new form of organization* and a *new form of software*. They're a new model for creating, financing, and operating software services in a way that is decentralized top-to-bottom. That doesn't make them better or worse than existing software models or corporate entities. As we'll see later, there are trade-offs. What we can say for now is simply that they are radically different from the forms of software and organization we are used to.\n\nHow different? Imagine the following: you grew up in a rainforest and I brought you a cactus and told you it was a tree. How would you react? You'd probably laugh and say it's not a tree because there's no point in a tree being a stumpy water tank covered in armor  —  after all, water is abundant here in the rainforest! This, roughly, is the reaction of many people working in Silicon Valley to decentralized applications and DAOs.\n\nBut I digress. I owe you an important explanation:\n\n**What is a decentralized application?**\n\nA decentralized application is a way to create a service that no single entity operates.\n\nWe'll come to the question of *whether that's useful* in a moment. But first, you need to understand how they work.\n\nLet's go back to the birth of this idea.\n\nIt's November 2008. The nadir of the financial crisis.\n\nAn anonymous person publishes a paper explaining how to make electronic payments without a trusted central party like Chase or PayPal or the Federal Reserve. It's the first *decentralized application* of this kind ever proposed.\n\nIt's a decentralized application *for payments*.\n\nThe paper is titled [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).\n\nHow does it work? How is it possible to send an electronic payment without a designated party who will track and update everyone's balances? If I hand you a dollar that's one thing. But data is not a bearer instrument. Data needs intermediation and validation to be trusted.\n\nThe paper proposes a solution: form a peer-to-peer network. Make it public. Announce your transaction to everyone. In your announcement, point to the specific funds on the network you want to spend. Cryptographically sign your announcement with the same software key that is linked to those funds so we know they're yours.\n\nIt almost works. We need one more thing: a way to make sure that if you broadcast two competing announcements (that is, if you try to spend the same funds twice) that only one of your attempts counts.\n\n*Bad solution:* designate a party to timestamp the transactions and only include the transaction that came first. We're back to square one. We have a trusted intermediary.\n\n*Breakthrough solution:* let entities compete to be the \"timestamper!\" We can't avoid the need for one, but we can avoid designating one in advance or using the same one for every batch of transactions.\n\n\"Let entities compete.\" Sounds like a market economy. What's missing? A reward for winning. An incentive. An asset.\n\nLet's call that asset Bitcoin. Let's call the entities competing for the right to timestamp the latest batch of announced transactions \"miners.\" Let's make sure anyone can join this contest at any time by making the code and network open.\n\nNow we need an actual contest. The paper proposes one. On your mark, get set: find a random number generated by the network! The number is really, really hard to find. So hard that the only way to find it is to use tons of processing power and burn through electricity. It's a computing version of what Veruca Salt made her dad and his poor factory workers do in Willy Wonka. A brute force search for a golden ticket (or in this case, a golden number).\n\n[Actual Bitcoin mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9mba2qb9do)\n\nWhy the elaborate and expensive competition to do something as simple as timestamp transactions for the network? So that we can be sure the competitors have incurred a *real financial cost*. That way, if they win the race to find the random number and become the designated timestamper for a given batch of transactions, they won't use that power for evil (like censoring transactions). Instead, they will meticulously scan each pending transaction, eliminate any attempts by users to spend the same funds twice, ensure all rules are followed, and broadcast the validated batch to the rest of the network.\n\nBecause if they do indeed follow the rules, the network is programmed to reward them...\n\n...with newly minted Bitcoin, plus the transaction fees, denominated in Bitcoin, paid by the senders. (See why they are called miners and not timestampers, now?)\n\nIn other words, miners follow the rules because it is in their economic self-interest to do the right thing.\n\nYou know, like Adam Smith said:\n\nIt is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self interest.\n\nCrypto assets: the invisible hand... of the internet.\n\nBitcoin is capitalism, distilled. You should love it!\n\nAnd since these miners have debts to pay (mostly electricity bills), they will likely sell their newly earned Bitcoins on the open market in exchange for whatever real currency they need to satisfy their liabilities. Anything left is profit. The Bitcoin is now in circulation. People who need it can buy it. And so can people who just want to speculate on it. (More on the people who \"need it\" vs. those who are speculating later.)\n\nEureka! We have killed two birds with one stone: the financial reward that substitutes our need for a trusted central party with a marketplace of competing yet honest timestampers *is the same asset* that ends up in circulation for use as a *digital bearer instrument* in an electronic payments network that has no central party (it's circular, I know).\n\nNow that you understand Bitcoin, let's generalize this to decentralized applications as a whole.\n\n**In general, a decentralized application allows you to do something you can already do today (like payments) but without a trusted central party.**\n\nHere's another example: a decentralized application called Filecoin enables users to store files on a peer-to-peer network of computers instead of in a centralized file storage service like Dropbox or Amazon S3. Its crypto asset, also called Filecoin, incentivizes entities to share excess hard drive space with the network.\n\nDigital file storage is not new. Neither is electronic payments. What's new is that they can be operated without a company. A new form of organization.\n\nOne more example.\n\nWarning: this one is a bit confusing because it's *meta*.\n\nThere's a decentralized application called Ethereum that is *a decentralized application for launching decentralized applications.* I am sure by now you have heard of \"initial coin offerings\" (ICOs) and \"tokens.\" Most of these are issued on top of Ethereum. Instead of building a decentralized application from scratch the way Bitcoin was, you can build one on top of Ethereum much more easily because a) the network already exists and b) it's not designed for a specific application but rather as a platform to build applications that can execute arbitrary code. It is \"featureless.\"\n\nEthereum's protocol incentivizes entities to contribute *computing resources* to the network. Doing so earns these entities Ether, the crypto asset of Ethereum. This makes Ethereum a new kind of computing platform for this new class of software (decentralized apps). It's not cloud computing because Ethereum itself is decentralized (like *aether*, get it?). That's why its founder, Vitalik Buterin, refers to Ethereum as a \"world computer.\"\n\nTo summarize, in just the last few years the world has invented a way to create software services that have no central operator. These services are called decentralized applications and they are enabled with crypto assets that incentivize entities on the internet to contribute resources —  processing, storage, computing  —  necessary for the service to function.\n\nIt's worth pausing to acknowledge that this is kind of *miraculous*. With just the internet, an open protocol, and a new kind of asset, we can instantiate networks that dynamically assemble the resources necessary to provide many kinds of services.\n\nAnd there are a lot of people who think this model is the future of all software, the thing that will finally challenge the FANG stocks and venture capital to boot.\n\nBut there's a problem.\n\nIt's not clear yet that decentralized applications are actually useful to most people relative to traditional software.\n\nSimply put, you cannot argue that for everyone Bitcoin is better than PayPal or Chase. Or that for everyone Filecoin is better than Dropbox or iCloud. Or that for everyone Ethereum is better than Amazon EC2 or Azure.\n\nIn fact, on almost every dimension, decentralized services have key drawbacks relative to their centralized counterparts:\n\n- They are slower\n- They are more expensive\n- They are less scalable\n- They have worse user experiences\n- They have volatile and uncertain governance\n\nAnd no, this isn't just because they are new. This won't fundamentally change with bigger blocks, lightning networks, sharding, forks, self-amending ledgers, or any other technical solutions.\n\nThat's because there are structural trade-offs that result directly from the primary design goal of these services, beneath which all other goals must be subordinated in order for them to be relevant: *decentralization*.\n\nRemember that \"elaborate and expensive competition\" I described? Well, it comes at the cost of throughput. Remember how users need to \"cryptographically sign\" their transaction announcements? Well, those private keys need to be held onto much more securely than a typical password (passwords can be recovered). Remember how \"no single entity operates\" these networks? The flip side is that there is no clear way to make decisions or govern them.\n\nSure, you can make decentralized applications more efficient and user friendly by, for example, centralizing users' cryptographic signing keys (i.e., control of their coins) with a trusted entity. But then we're mostly back to square one and would be better off using a service that is centralized.\n\nThus, bitcoin, for example, isn't best described as \"Decentralized PayPal.\" It's more accurate to say it's an extremely inefficient electronic payments network, *but in exchange we get decentralization*.\n\nBottom line: centralized applications tend to beat decentralized applications on virtually every dimension.\n\n**EXCEPT FOR ONE DIMENSION.**\n\nAnd not only are decentralized applications better at this one thing, they are the only way we can achieve it.\n\nWhat am I referring to?\n\n**Censorship resistance.**\n\nThis is where we come to the elusive signal in the noise.\n\nCensorship resistance means that access to decentralized applications is open and unfettered. Transactions on these services are *unstoppable*.\n\nMore concretely, nothing can stop me from sending Bitcoin to anyone I please. Nothing can stop me from executing code on Ethereum. Nothing can stop me from storing files on Filecoin. As long as I have an internet connection and pay the network's transaction fee, denominated in its crypto asset, I am free to do what I want.\n\n(If Bitcoin is capitalism distilled, it's also a kind of freedom distilled.)\n\nAnd for crypto enthusiasts that don't want to take my word for it, will you listen to Adam Back and Charlie Lee?\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ee4fbcb7-432a-4282-8752-caec90dc8210.jpeg?height=212&width=691)\n\n**So while we can't say \"for everyone Bitcoin is better than Visa,\" it is possible that for some cohort of users Bitcoin truly is the only way to make a payment.**\n\nMore generally, we can ask:\n\nFor whom is this the right trade-off?\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/06abc035-7c45-45d0-a505-58a7d0de5a67.jpeg?height=339&width=717)\n\nWho needs censorship resistance so much that they are willing to trade away the speed, cost, scalability, and experience benefits of centralized services?\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying you have to make this trade-off *in order to buy/speculate on crypto assets.* I am saying that in order for decentralized applications themselves to have utility to some cohort, that cohort must be optimizing for censorship resistance.\n\n**So, who are these people?**\n\nWhile there is not a lot of good data, actual *users* of decentralized applications seem to fall into two categories:\n\n1. People who are off the grid: that is, in countries where access to competently operated traditional services is limited (for any number of reasons) but where internet is not\n\n2. People who want to be off the grid: that is, people who don't want their transactions censored or known\n\nWith that framework in mind we can ask:\n\n- For whom is Bitcoin the best/only way to make a payment?\n- For whom is Filecoin the best/only way to store a file?\n- For whom is Ethereum the best/only way to compute code?\n\nThese are the questions that get at the heart of the value proposition of the technology.\n\nSo far, most decentralized applications have very little use relative to traditional services. Bitcoin, for example, has fewer mainstream merchants accepting it as a payment option in the U.S. today than in 2014. And for all the talk of Bitcoin's value as a payments system in developing countries or emerging markets like China, it is traditional software (i.e., apps) like AliPay and Paytm that are actually driving sweeping change in payments in these markets.\n\nAt the same time, use of Bitcoin on the dark web and for ransomware is evident, even if it is hard to get good data.\n\nBut aren't people using Bitcoin as a \"store of value?\" Sure, which is just another way of saying people are investing in Bitcoin with a long time horizon. But remember I'm not talking about investing in the crypto asset yet. I'm talking about whether there are people who find a *decentralized application for payments* (which is enabled by that asset) useful. Real estate is only a good store of value *in the long run* if people live and work in the buildings. The same is true of decentralized applications.\n\nWhat should we make of Ethereum evaluated through the \"censorship resistance\" lens? After all, it seems to be getting a ton of use by developers. Since Ethereum is a developer platform for decentralized applications, does that mean it is developers who have been censored or blocked somehow? In a way, yes. Developers and start-ups who wish to build financial products do not have open and unfettered access to the world's financial infrastructure. While Ethereum doesn't provide access to that infrastructure, it does provide a different infrastructure that can be used to, for example, create and execute a financial contract.\n\nSince Ethereum is a platform, its value is ultimately a function of the value of the applications built on top. In other words, we can ask if Ethereum is useful by simply asking if anything that has been built on Ethereum is useful. For example, do we need censorship resistant prediction markets? Censorship resistant meme playing cards? Censorship resistant versions of YouTube or Twitter? What are – or will be – the killer applications on Ethereum?\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nGiven how different they are from the app models we know and love, will anyone *ever really use* decentralized applications? Will they become a critical part of the economy? It's hard to predict because it depends in part on the technology's evolution but far more on society's reaction to it.\n\nFor example: until relatively recently, encrypted messaging was only used by hackers, spies, and paranoids. That didn't seem to be changing. Until it did. Post-Snowden and post-Trump, everyone from Silicon Valley to the Acela corridor seems to be on either Signal or Telegram. WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted. The press solicit tips through SecureDrop. Yes, the technology got a little better and easier to use. But it is mainly changes in society that are driving adoption.\n\nIn other words, we grew up in the rainforest, but sometimes things change and it helps to know how to adapt to other environments.\n\nAnd this is the basic argument that the smart money is making on crypto assets and decentralized applications: that it's simply too early to say anything. That it is a profound change. That, should one or more of these decentralized applications actually become an integral part of the world, their underlying crypto assets will be extremely valuable. So might as well start placing bets now and see how it goes. Don't get to hung up on whether we see the killer apps yet.\n\nThat's not a bad argument and I tend to agree.\n\n**I would summarize the argument as:** in the long-run, a crypto asset's value is driven by use of the decentralized application it enables. While it's early, the high valuations are justified because even if the probability of mass adoption is small, the impact would be very large, so might as well go along for the ride and see what happens.\n\n**But how do we explain the recent mania?**\n\nBitcoin is up 5x in a year, Ethereum is up 30x. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is ~$175B, up from $12B just a year ago. Why?\n\nAs in every mania in history, it is currently rational to be irrational.\n\nTo understand what's going on, let's look at the buyer and seller mentality right now, starting with the buyers.\n\nIf you invested early in Bitcoin or Ethereum, you are sitting on a windfall. It feels like you are playing with \"house money,\" [a well-known psychological effect](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/1154/thaler_and_johnson.pdf). You feel smart and willing to risk more than you otherwise would if it was \"your money.\" Might as well diversify a bit and parlay your gains into the next crypto asset, or two, or three.\n\nIf you *didn't* invest, the fear-of-missing-out continues to build until the \"screw it\" moment when you buy in. Maybe you read about Bitcoin, didn't understand it, and followed Warren Buffet's (typically good) advice not to invest in things you don't understand. Some of your friends made money but you still ignored it. Then you read about Ethereum, which you *really* didn't understand, also passed on buying, and later found out that your friends are planning to retire because they did. The lesson seems to be *anti-Buffet*: only invest in things you *don't understand*. This is causing people to check their judgement at the door when the latest all-time high finally convinces them to jump into the market.\n\nAnd that is not good.\n\nBecause there will be sellers to fill the demand, especially the demand coming from people who have decided they will never understand this stuff so will just place bets on things that *sound complex and impressive.*\n\nLet's think about these sellers. And by sellers, I don't mean people selling their holdings of existing crypto assets. I mean new issuers. Teams launching new crypto assets.\n\nThe basic model is to pre-sell some percentage of the crypto assets the proposed network will generate as a way to fund the development of the decentralized application before it launches. The project founders tend to hold on to some percentage of these assets. Which means that raising money for a project this way is a) non-dilutive as it is not equity and b) not debt, so you never have to pay anyone back. This is basically free money. It's never been this good for entrepreneurs, even in the 90s dot-com boom. Which makes it incredibly tempting to try and shoe-horn every project that *could perhaps* justify an \"initial coin offering\" to go for it, even if they aren't actually building a *decentralized* application. After all, an ICO lets you exit before you even launch.\n\nAnd there is a pervasive narrative out there that supports entrepreneurs looking to create new crypto assets. The idea is that by selling assets to users before your network launches, you create \"evangelists\" who will be early users and promoters you wouldn't otherwise have if there were no financial incentive to participate in your community.\n\nThe problem with this line of thinking is that it conflates early *investors* with early *users*. The overlap between people who buy your crypto asset and people who actually want to use the service you are building is likely very, very small, especially during market manias like this one. It creates a false sense of \"product-market fit.\" Yes, people are buying your crypto asset. But that's because the \"market\" are people who want to get rich and the \"product\" you are selling is a \"way to get rich.\"\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c381a715-69d6-4b9f-ae99-f7066c7b4150.jpeg?height=345&width=727)\n\nBut \"this is fine.\"\n\nEveryone's making money. For now.\n\nIt's currently rational to be irrational.\n\nAs long as that blue line keeps going up.\n\n> Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked.\n\n**At the same time, I wouldn't bet against crypto assets.**\n\n> He who lives by the crystal ball will eat shattered glass.\n\nConsider the following. The total market cap of crypto assets has been increasing by an *order of magnitude* every few years. Where will they be in 2022? It's certain that many (most?) of the crypto assets launching today won't make it. But neither did most of the ones that were launched back in the 2013/4 boom (when they were referred to as \"alt coins\"). Though an important alt coin from 2014 did stick around and drove the most recent boom to new heights by being the platform to power all the others: Ethereum.\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/97c6751e-3218-4407-a71f-e00e0fe3babe.jpeg?height=190&width=721)\n\n**So, Jamie, what's the bottom line?**\n\nAllow me to summarize.\n\n- Cryptocurrencies (which I prefer to call crypto assets) are a new asset class that enable decentralized applications\n\n- Decentralized applications enable services we already have today, like payments, storage, or computing, but without a central operator of those services\n\n- Today, this software model is useful to people who need censorship resistance which tend to be people that are either off the grid or who want to be off the grid\n\n- For now, most people are better off using normal applications because they are 10x better on every other dimension\n\n- Society's embrace or rejection of new technology is hard to predict (think about encrypted messaging)\n\n- In the long-run, the value of a crypto asset will rise and fall in proportion to the use of the decentralized applications it enables\n\n- In the short-run, there will be extreme volatility as FOMO competes with FUD, confusion competes with understanding, and greed competes with fear (on both the buyer side and the issuer side)\n\n- Most people buying into crypto assets have checked their judgement at the door\n\n- Many sellers of new crypto assets aren't actually building decentralized applications but are instead shoe-horning an ICO into their service because of the market mania; that doesn't mean decentralized applications are bad, it just means people are capitalizing on the confusion and are probably themselves confused\n\n- Don't bet against crypto assets in the long-run: as we approach the 10 year anniversary of the Bitcoin paper it is clear that they aren't going anywhere and that decentralized applications may very well find an important place alongside all the other forms of organization we have come to take for granted.\n\nBest,\nAdam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1614696555, "digest": "Q-HIDLBN0lRy1ezLFI-Qj5JhLzHWRUgXF4cqwieQWXQ", "contributor": "0x8a32Af4AfFD816978C2Fdfa7C08c27681d05d4Fe"}

Ethereum was mooning. ICOs were pumping. And Jamie wasn't having it. He called Bitcoin a fraud.\n\nI decided to write him an open letter, and the piece went viral. Two days later, he called. He was gracious, thanked me for the explanations in the post, and asked me to spend some time with his team.\n\nBut the funny thing is, I didn't write the post for Jamie. I wrote it as a primer for people who were only paying attention to crypto because of the all-time highs. I wanted to explain to them why they should care about crypto, regardless of the price. I called it the Signal in the Noise.\n\nAnd my central point was that crypto makes whole new types of software applications (dapps) and human organization (DAOs) possible. While it was still extremely early, and while prices were disconnected from reality, it nonetheless seemed likely it would lead us to new and important frontiers. That's why we should care.\n\nIncidentally, it's also why we should care right now about NFTs and DeFi, despite similar exuberance. But that will be the subject of another post... perhaps an open letter to Larry Gagosian!\n\nI wrote the original piece on Medium, under an account associated with my company at the time, Chain. That account is [now gone](https://blog.chain.com/a-letter-to-jamie-dimon-de89d417cb80), and thus so is the post. So what better way to inaugurate this new publishing platform, itself enabled by the very ideas I wrote about in the piece, than by re-posting it here on Mirror, where I'll never have to wonder if it's \"still online.\"\n\nRe-reading the post made me cringe at times. I definitely underestimated *just how magical a superpower censorship resistance is* – specifically how it enables permissionless innovation at unheard of cycle times and decentralized collaboration that doesn't need the business models of the past to survive – and thrive. 2017 was *not that long ago* and yet web3 is happening **now** and is very real.\n\nThanks to the Mirror team and community for welcoming me to this platform.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**The Signal in the Noise**\n\nOctober 2017\n\nDear Jamie,\n\nMy name is Adam Ludwin and I run a company called Chain. I have been working in and around the cryptocurrency market for several years.\n\nLast week you said a few things about Bitcoin:\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1e844f2-5256-4da1-87ee-c7947f2ad3ec.jpeg?height=194&width=800)\n\nIt's easy to believe cryptocurrencies have no inherent value. Or that governments will crush them.\n\nIt's also becoming fashionable to believe the opposite: that they will disrupt banks, governments, and Silicon Valley giants once and for all.\n\nNeither extreme is true.\n\nThe reality is nuanced and important. Which is why I've decided to write you this briefing note. I hope it helps you appreciate cryptocurrencies more deeply.\n\n**Let me start by stating that I believe:**\n\n- The market for cryptocurrencies is overheated and irrationally exuberant\n- There are a lot of poseurs creating them, and some scammers, too\n- There are a lot of conflicts of interest, self-serving hype, and obfuscation\n- Very few people in the media understand what's going on\n- Very few people in finance understand what's going on\n- Very few people in technology understand what's going on\n- Very few people in academia or government understand what's going on\n- Very few people buying cryptocurrencies understand what's going on\n- It's very possible I don't understand what's going on\n\nAlso:\n\n- Banks and governments aren't going away\n- Traditional software isn't going away\n\nIn short: there's a lot of noise. But there is also signal. To find it, we need to start by *defining* cryptocurrency.\n\nWithout a working definition we are lost. Most people arguing about cryptocurrencies are talking past each other because they don't stop to ask the other side what they think cryptocurrencies are *for*.\n\n**Here's my definition: cryptocurrencies are a *new asset class* that enable *decentralized applications*.**\n\nIf this is true, your point of view on cryptocurrencies has very little to do with what you think about them in comparison to traditional currencies or securities, and everything to do with your opinion of *decentralized applications and their value relative to current software models*.\n\nDon't have an opinion on decentralized applications? Then you can't possibly have one on cryptocurrencies yet, so read on.\n\nAnd since this isn't about cryptocurrencies vs. fiat currencies let's stop using the word *currency*. It's a head fake. It has way too much baggage and I notice that when you talk about Bitcoin in public you keep comparing it to the Dollar, Euro, and Yen. That comparison won't help you understand what's going on. In fact, it's getting in the way. So for the rest of this note, I will refer to cryptocurrencies as *crypto assets*.\n\nSo, to repeat: crypto assets are a *new asset class* that enable decentralized applications.\n\nAnd like every other asset class, they exist as a mechanism to *allocate resources to a specific form of organization*. Despite the myopic focus on trading crypto assets recently, they don't exist solely to be traded. That is, in principle at least, they don't exist for their own sake.\n\nTo understand what I mean, think about other asset classes and what form of organization they serve:\n\n- Corporate equities serve companies\n- Government bonds serve nations, states, municipalities\n- Mortgages serve property owners\n\nAnd now:\n\n- Crypto assets serve decentralized applications\n\nDecentralized applications are a *new form of organization* and a *new form of software*. They're a new model for creating, financing, and operating software services in a way that is decentralized top-to-bottom. That doesn't make them better or worse than existing software models or corporate entities. As we'll see later, there are trade-offs. What we can say for now is simply that they are radically different from the forms of software and organization we are used to.\n\nHow different? Imagine the following: you grew up in a rainforest and I brought you a cactus and told you it was a tree. How would you react? You'd probably laugh and say it's not a tree because there's no point in a tree being a stumpy water tank covered in armor  —  after all, water is abundant here in the rainforest! This, roughly, is the reaction of many people working in Silicon Valley to decentralized applications and DAOs.\n\nBut I digress. I owe you an important explanation:\n\n**What is a decentralized application?**\n\nA decentralized application is a way to create a service that no single entity operates.\n\nWe'll come to the question of *whether that's useful* in a moment. But first, you need to understand how they work.\n\nLet's go back to the birth of this idea.\n\nIt's November 2008. The nadir of the financial crisis.\n\nAn anonymous person publishes a paper explaining how to make electronic payments without a trusted central party like Chase or PayPal or the Federal Reserve. It's the first *decentralized application* of this kind ever proposed.\n\nIt's a decentralized application *for payments*.\n\nThe paper is titled [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).\n\nHow does it work? How is it possible to send an electronic payment without a designated party who will track and update everyone's balances? If I hand you a dollar that's one thing. But data is not a bearer instrument. Data needs intermediation and validation to be trusted.\n\nThe paper proposes a solution: form a peer-to-peer network. Make it public. Announce your transaction to everyone. In your announcement, point to the specific funds on the network you want to spend. Cryptographically sign your announcement with the same software key that is linked to those funds so we know they're yours.\n\nIt almost works. We need one more thing: a way to make sure that if you broadcast two competing announcements (that is, if you try to spend the same funds twice) that only one of your attempts counts.\n\n*Bad solution:* designate a party to timestamp the transactions and only include the transaction that came first. We're back to square one. We have a trusted intermediary.\n\n*Breakthrough solution:* let entities compete to be the \"timestamper!\" We can't avoid the need for one, but we can avoid designating one in advance or using the same one for every batch of transactions.\n\n\"Let entities compete.\" Sounds like a market economy. What's missing? A reward for winning. An incentive. An asset.\n\nLet's call that asset Bitcoin. Let's call the entities competing for the right to timestamp the latest batch of announced transactions \"miners.\" Let's make sure anyone can join this contest at any time by making the code and network open.\n\nNow we need an actual contest. The paper proposes one. On your mark, get set: find a random number generated by the network! The number is really, really hard to find. So hard that the only way to find it is to use tons of processing power and burn through electricity. It's a computing version of what Veruca Salt made her dad and his poor factory workers do in Willy Wonka. A brute force search for a golden ticket (or in this case, a golden number).\n\n[Actual Bitcoin mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9mba2qb9do)\n\nWhy the elaborate and expensive competition to do something as simple as timestamp transactions for the network? So that we can be sure the competitors have incurred a *real financial cost*. That way, if they win the race to find the random number and become the designated timestamper for a given batch of transactions, they won't use that power for evil (like censoring transactions). Instead, they will meticulously scan each pending transaction, eliminate any attempts by users to spend the same funds twice, ensure all rules are followed, and broadcast the validated batch to the rest of the network.\n\nBecause if they do indeed follow the rules, the network is programmed to reward them...\n\n...with newly minted Bitcoin, plus the transaction fees, denominated in Bitcoin, paid by the senders. (See why they are called miners and not timestampers, now?)\n\nIn other words, miners follow the rules because it is in their economic self-interest to do the right thing.\n\nYou know, like Adam Smith said:\n\nIt is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self interest.\n\nCrypto assets: the invisible hand... of the internet.\n\nBitcoin is capitalism, distilled. You should love it!\n\nAnd since these miners have debts to pay (mostly electricity bills), they will likely sell their newly earned Bitcoins on the open market in exchange for whatever real currency they need to satisfy their liabilities. Anything left is profit. The Bitcoin is now in circulation. People who need it can buy it. And so can people who just want to speculate on it. (More on the people who \"need it\" vs. those who are speculating later.)\n\nEureka! We have killed two birds with one stone: the financial reward that substitutes our need for a trusted central party with a marketplace of competing yet honest timestampers *is the same asset* that ends up in circulation for use as a *digital bearer instrument* in an electronic payments network that has no central party (it's circular, I know).\n\nNow that you understand Bitcoin, let's generalize this to decentralized applications as a whole.\n\n**In general, a decentralized application allows you to do something you can already do today (like payments) but without a trusted central party.**\n\nHere's another example: a decentralized application called Filecoin enables users to store files on a peer-to-peer network of computers instead of in a centralized file storage service like Dropbox or Amazon S3. Its crypto asset, also called Filecoin, incentivizes entities to share excess hard drive space with the network.\n\nDigital file storage is not new. Neither is electronic payments. What's new is that they can be operated without a company. A new form of organization.\n\nOne more example.\n\nWarning: this one is a bit confusing because it's *meta*.\n\nThere's a decentralized application called Ethereum that is *a decentralized application for launching decentralized applications.* I am sure by now you have heard of \"initial coin offerings\" (ICOs) and \"tokens.\" Most of these are issued on top of Ethereum. Instead of building a decentralized application from scratch the way Bitcoin was, you can build one on top of Ethereum much more easily because a) the network already exists and b) it's not designed for a specific application but rather as a platform to build applications that can execute arbitrary code. It is \"featureless.\"\n\nEthereum's protocol incentivizes entities to contribute *computing resources* to the network. Doing so earns these entities Ether, the crypto asset of Ethereum. This makes Ethereum a new kind of computing platform for this new class of software (decentralized apps). It's not cloud computing because Ethereum itself is decentralized (like *aether*, get it?). That's why its founder, Vitalik Buterin, refers to Ethereum as a \"world computer.\"\n\nTo summarize, in just the last few years the world has invented a way to create software services that have no central operator. These services are called decentralized applications and they are enabled with crypto assets that incentivize entities on the internet to contribute resources —  processing, storage, computing  —  necessary for the service to function.\n\nIt's worth pausing to acknowledge that this is kind of *miraculous*. With just the internet, an open protocol, and a new kind of asset, we can instantiate networks that dynamically assemble the resources necessary to provide many kinds of services.\n\nAnd there are a lot of people who think this model is the future of all software, the thing that will finally challenge the FANG stocks and venture capital to boot.\n\nBut there's a problem.\n\nIt's not clear yet that decentralized applications are actually useful to most people relative to traditional software.\n\nSimply put, you cannot argue that for everyone Bitcoin is better than PayPal or Chase. Or that for everyone Filecoin is better than Dropbox or iCloud. Or that for everyone Ethereum is better than Amazon EC2 or Azure.\n\nIn fact, on almost every dimension, decentralized services have key drawbacks relative to their centralized counterparts:\n\n- They are slower\n- They are more expensive\n- They are less scalable\n- They have worse user experiences\n- They have volatile and uncertain governance\n\nAnd no, this isn't just because they are new. This won't fundamentally change with bigger blocks, lightning networks, sharding, forks, self-amending ledgers, or any other technical solutions.\n\nThat's because there are structural trade-offs that result directly from the primary design goal of these services, beneath which all other goals must be subordinated in order for them to be relevant: *decentralization*.\n\nRemember that \"elaborate and expensive competition\" I described? Well, it comes at the cost of throughput. Remember how users need to \"cryptographically sign\" their transaction announcements? Well, those private keys need to be held onto much more securely than a typical password (passwords can be recovered). Remember how \"no single entity operates\" these networks? The flip side is that there is no clear way to make decisions or govern them.\n\nSure, you can make decentralized applications more efficient and user friendly by, for example, centralizing users' cryptographic signing keys (i.e., control of their coins) with a trusted entity. But then we're mostly back to square one and would be better off using a service that is centralized.\n\nThus, bitcoin, for example, isn't best described as \"Decentralized PayPal.\" It's more accurate to say it's an extremely inefficient electronic payments network, *but in exchange we get decentralization*.\n\nBottom line: centralized applications tend to beat decentralized applications on virtually every dimension.\n\n**EXCEPT FOR ONE DIMENSION.**\n\nAnd not only are decentralized applications better at this one thing, they are the only way we can achieve it.\n\nWhat am I referring to?\n\n**Censorship resistance.**\n\nThis is where we come to the elusive signal in the noise.\n\nCensorship resistance means that access to decentralized applications is open and unfettered. Transactions on these services are *unstoppable*.\n\nMore concretely, nothing can stop me from sending Bitcoin to anyone I please. Nothing can stop me from executing code on Ethereum. Nothing can stop me from storing files on Filecoin. As long as I have an internet connection and pay the network's transaction fee, denominated in its crypto asset, I am free to do what I want.\n\n(If Bitcoin is capitalism distilled, it's also a kind of freedom distilled.)\n\nAnd for crypto enthusiasts that don't want to take my word for it, will you listen to Adam Back and Charlie Lee?\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ee4fbcb7-432a-4282-8752-caec90dc8210.jpeg?height=212&width=691)\n\n**So while we can't say \"for everyone Bitcoin is better than Visa,\" it is possible that for some cohort of users Bitcoin truly is the only way to make a payment.**\n\nMore generally, we can ask:\n\nFor whom is this the right trade-off?\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/06abc035-7c45-45d0-a505-58a7d0de5a67.jpeg?height=339&width=717)\n\nWho needs censorship resistance so much that they are willing to trade away the speed, cost, scalability, and experience benefits of centralized services?\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying you have to make this trade-off *in order to buy/speculate on crypto assets.* I am saying that in order for decentralized applications themselves to have utility to some cohort, that cohort must be optimizing for censorship resistance.\n\n**So, who are these people?**\n\nWhile there is not a lot of good data, actual *users* of decentralized applications seem to fall into two categories:\n\n1. People who are off the grid: that is, in countries where access to competently operated traditional services is limited (for any number of reasons) but where internet is not\n\n2. People who want to be off the grid: that is, people who don't want their transactions censored or known\n\nWith that framework in mind we can ask:\n\n- For whom is Bitcoin the best/only way to make a payment?\n- For whom is Filecoin the best/only way to store a file?\n- For whom is Ethereum the best/only way to compute code?\n\nThese are the questions that get at the heart of the value proposition of the technology.\n\nSo far, most decentralized applications have very little use relative to traditional services. Bitcoin, for example, has fewer mainstream merchants accepting it as a payment option in the U.S. today than in 2014. And for all the talk of Bitcoin's value as a payments system in developing countries or emerging markets like China, it is traditional software (i.e., apps) like AliPay and Paytm that are actually driving sweeping change in payments in these markets.\n\nAt the same time, use of Bitcoin on the dark web and for ransomware is evident, even if it is hard to get good data.\n\nBut aren't people using Bitcoin as a \"store of value?\" Sure, which is just another way of saying people are investing in Bitcoin with a long time horizon. But remember I'm not talking about investing in the crypto asset yet. I'm talking about whether there are people who find a *decentralized application for payments* (which is enabled by that asset) useful. Real estate is only a good store of value *in the long run* if people live and work in the buildings. The same is true of decentralized applications.\n\nWhat should we make of Ethereum evaluated through the \"censorship resistance\" lens? After all, it seems to be getting a ton of use by developers. Since Ethereum is a developer platform for decentralized applications, does that mean it is developers who have been censored or blocked somehow? In a way, yes. Developers and start-ups who wish to build financial products do not have open and unfettered access to the world's financial infrastructure. While Ethereum doesn't provide access to that infrastructure, it does provide a different infrastructure that can be used to, for example, create and execute a financial contract.\n\nSince Ethereum is a platform, its value is ultimately a function of the value of the applications built on top. In other words, we can ask if Ethereum is useful by simply asking if anything that has been built on Ethereum is useful. For example, do we need censorship resistant prediction markets? Censorship resistant meme playing cards? Censorship resistant versions of YouTube or Twitter? What are – or will be – the killer applications on Ethereum?\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nGiven how different they are from the app models we know and love, will anyone *ever really use* decentralized applications? Will they become a critical part of the economy? It's hard to predict because it depends in part on the technology's evolution but far more on society's reaction to it.\n\nFor example: until relatively recently, encrypted messaging was only used by hackers, spies, and paranoids. That didn't seem to be changing. Until it did. Post-Snowden and post-Trump, everyone from Silicon Valley to the Acela corridor seems to be on either Signal or Telegram. WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted. The press solicit tips through SecureDrop. Yes, the technology got a little better and easier to use. But it is mainly changes in society that are driving adoption.\n\nIn other words, we grew up in the rainforest, but sometimes things change and it helps to know how to adapt to other environments.\n\nAnd this is the basic argument that the smart money is making on crypto assets and decentralized applications: that it's simply too early to say anything. That it is a profound change. That, should one or more of these decentralized applications actually become an integral part of the world, their underlying crypto assets will be extremely valuable. So might as well start placing bets now and see how it goes. Don't get to hung up on whether we see the killer apps yet.\n\nThat's not a bad argument and I tend to agree.\n\n**I would summarize the argument as:** in the long-run, a crypto asset's value is driven by use of the decentralized application it enables. While it's early, the high valuations are justified because even if the probability of mass adoption is small, the impact would be very large, so might as well go along for the ride and see what happens.\n\n**But how do we explain the recent mania?**\n\nBitcoin is up 5x in a year, Ethereum is up 30x. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is ~$175B, up from $12B just a year ago. Why?\n\nAs in every mania in history, it is currently rational to be irrational.\n\nTo understand what's going on, let's look at the buyer and seller mentality right now, starting with the buyers.\n\nIf you invested early in Bitcoin or Ethereum, you are sitting on a windfall. It feels like you are playing with \"house money,\" [a well-known psychological effect](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/1154/thaler_and_johnson.pdf). You feel smart and willing to risk more than you otherwise would if it was \"your money.\" Might as well diversify a bit and parlay your gains into the next crypto asset, or two, or three.\n\nIf you *didn't* invest, the fear-of-missing-out continues to build until the \"screw it\" moment when you buy in. Maybe you read about Bitcoin, didn't understand it, and followed Warren Buffet's (typically good) advice not to invest in things you don't understand. Some of your friends made money but you still ignored it. Then you read about Ethereum, which you *really* didn't understand, also passed on buying, and later found out that your friends are planning to retire because they did. The lesson seems to be *anti-Buffet*: only invest in things you *don't understand*. This is causing people to check their judgement at the door when the latest all-time high finally convinces them to jump into the market.\n\nAnd that is not good.\n\nBecause there will be sellers to fill the demand, especially the demand coming from people who have decided they will never understand this stuff so will just place bets on things that *sound complex and impressive.*\n\nLet's think about these sellers. And by sellers, I don't mean people selling their holdings of existing crypto assets. I mean new issuers. Teams launching new crypto assets.\n\nThe basic model is to pre-sell some percentage of the crypto assets the proposed network will generate as a way to fund the development of the decentralized application before it launches. The project founders tend to hold on to some percentage of these assets. Which means that raising money for a project this way is a) non-dilutive as it is not equity and b) not debt, so you never have to pay anyone back. This is basically free money. It's never been this good for entrepreneurs, even in the 90s dot-com boom. Which makes it incredibly tempting to try and shoe-horn every project that *could perhaps* justify an \"initial coin offering\" to go for it, even if they aren't actually building a *decentralized* application. After all, an ICO lets you exit before you even launch.\n\nAnd there is a pervasive narrative out there that supports entrepreneurs looking to create new crypto assets. The idea is that by selling assets to users before your network launches, you create \"evangelists\" who will be early users and promoters you wouldn't otherwise have if there were no financial incentive to participate in your community.\n\nThe problem with this line of thinking is that it conflates early *investors* with early *users*. The overlap between people who buy your crypto asset and people who actually want to use the service you are building is likely very, very small, especially during market manias like this one. It creates a false sense of \"product-market fit.\" Yes, people are buying your crypto asset. But that's because the \"market\" are people who want to get rich and the \"product\" you are selling is a \"way to get rich.\"\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c381a715-69d6-4b9f-ae99-f7066c7b4150.jpeg?height=345&width=727)\n\nBut \"this is fine.\"\n\nEveryone's making money. For now.\n\nIt's currently rational to be irrational.\n\nAs long as that blue line keeps going up.\n\n> Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked.\n\n**At the same time, I wouldn't bet against crypto assets.**\n\n> He who lives by the crystal ball will eat shattered glass.\n\nConsider the following. The total market cap of crypto assets has been increasing by an *order of magnitude* every few years. Where will they be in 2022? It's certain that many (most?) of the crypto assets launching today won't make it. But neither did most of the ones that were launched back in the 2013/4 boom (when they were referred to as \"alt coins\"). Though an important alt coin from 2014 did stick around and drove the most recent boom to new heights by being the platform to power all the others: Ethereum.\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/97c6751e-3218-4407-a71f-e00e0fe3babe.jpeg?height=190&width=721)\n\n**So, Jamie, what's the bottom line?**\n\nAllow me to summarize.\n\n- Cryptocurrencies (which I prefer to call crypto assets) are a new asset class that enable decentralized applications\n\n- Decentralized applications enable services we already have today, like payments, storage, or computing, but without a central operator of those services\n\n- Today, this software model is useful to people who need censorship resistance which tend to be people that are either off the grid or who want to be off the grid\n\n- For now, most people are better off using normal applications because they are 10x better on every other dimension\n\n- Society's embrace or rejection of new technology is hard to predict (think about encrypted messaging)\n\n- In the long-run, the value of a crypto asset will rise and fall in proportion to the use of the decentralized applications it enables\n\n- In the short-run, there will be extreme volatility as FOMO competes with FUD, confusion competes with understanding, and greed competes with fear (on both the buyer side and the issuer side)\n\n- Most people buying into crypto assets have checked their judgement at the door\n\n- Many sellers of new crypto assets aren't actually building decentralized applications but are instead shoe-horning an ICO into their service because of the market mania; that doesn't mean decentralized applications are bad, it just means people are capitalizing on the confusion and are probably themselves confused\n\n- Don't bet against crypto assets in the long-run: as we approach the 10 year anniversary of the Bitcoin paper it is clear that they aren't going anywhere and that decentralized applications may very well find an important place alongside all the other forms of organization we have come to take for granted.\n\nBest,\nAdam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1614696676, "digest": "Q-HIDLBN0lRy1ezLFI-Qj5JhLzHWRUgXF4cqwieQWXQ", "contributor": "0x8a32Af4AfFD816978C2Fdfa7C08c27681d05d4Fe"}
{"id": "6ZdhuBYqsd071KtUOYispHLQw_6IJ-xXAYnnzDNVpqI", "title": "Understanding Crypto, or That Time Jamie Dimon Called", "body": "A little over three years ago, Jamie Dimon called me.\n\nBitcoin was at an all-time high. Ethereum was mooning. ICOs were pumping. And Jamie wasn't having it. He called Bitcoin a fraud.\n\nI decided to write him an open letter, and the piece went viral. Two days later, he called. He was gracious, thanked me for the explanations in the post, and asked me to spend some time with his team.\n\nBut the funny thing is, I didn't write the post for Jamie. I wrote it as a primer for people who were only paying attention to crypto because of the all-time highs. I wanted to explain to them why they should care about crypto, regardless of the price. I called it the Signal in the Noise.\n\nAnd my central point was that crypto makes whole new types of software applications (dapps) and human organization (DAOs) possible. While it was still extremely early, and while prices were disconnected from reality, it nonetheless seemed likely it would lead us to new and important frontiers. That's why we should care.\n\nIncidentally, it's also why we should care right now about NFTs and DeFi, despite similar exuberance. But that will be the subject of another post... perhaps an open letter to Larry Gagosian!\n\nI wrote the original piece on Medium, under an account associated with my company at the time, Chain. That account is [now gone](https://blog.chain.com/a-letter-to-jamie-dimon-de89d417cb80), and thus so is the post. So what better way to inaugurate this new publishing platform, itself enabled by the very ideas I wrote about in the piece, than by re-posting it here on Mirror, where I'll never have to wonder if it's \"still online.\"\n\nRe-reading the post made me cringe at times. I definitely underestimated *just how magical a superpower censorship resistance is* – specifically how it enables permissionless innovation at unheard of cycle times and decentralized collaboration that doesn't need the business models of the past to survive – and thrive. 2017 was *not that long ago* and yet web3 is happening **now** and is very real.\n\nBut it's still [not Jamie's cup of tea](https://www.coindesk.com/jamie-dimon-bitcoin-blockchain-dealbook-event).\n\nThanks to the Mirror team and community for welcoming me to this platform.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**The Signal in the Noise**\n\nOctober 2017\n\nDear Jamie,\n\nMy name is Adam Ludwin and I run a company called Chain. I have been working in and around the cryptocurrency market for several years.\n\nLast week you said a few things about Bitcoin:\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1e844f2-5256-4da1-87ee-c7947f2ad3ec.jpeg?height=194&width=800)\n\nIt's easy to believe cryptocurrencies have no inherent value. Or that governments will crush them.\n\nIt's also becoming fashionable to believe the opposite: that they will disrupt banks, governments, and Silicon Valley giants once and for all.\n\nNeither extreme is true.\n\nThe reality is nuanced and important. Which is why I've decided to write you this briefing note. I hope it helps you appreciate cryptocurrencies more deeply.\n\n**Let me start by stating that I believe:**\n\n- The market for cryptocurrencies is overheated and irrationally exuberant\n- There are a lot of poseurs creating them, and some scammers, too\n- There are a lot of conflicts of interest, self-serving hype, and obfuscation\n- Very few people in the media understand what's going on\n- Very few people in finance understand what's going on\n- Very few people in technology understand what's going on\n- Very few people in academia or government understand what's going on\n- Very few people buying cryptocurrencies understand what's going on\n- It's very possible I don't understand what's going on\n\nAlso:\n\n- Banks and governments aren't going away\n- Traditional software isn't going away\n\nIn short: there's a lot of noise. But there is also signal. To find it, we need to start by *defining* cryptocurrency.\n\nWithout a working definition we are lost. Most people arguing about cryptocurrencies are talking past each other because they don't stop to ask the other side what they think cryptocurrencies are *for*.\n\n**Here's my definition: cryptocurrencies are a *new asset class* that enable *decentralized applications*.**\n\nIf this is true, your point of view on cryptocurrencies has very little to do with what you think about them in comparison to traditional currencies or securities, and everything to do with your opinion of *decentralized applications and their value relative to current software models*.\n\nDon't have an opinion on decentralized applications? Then you can't possibly have one on cryptocurrencies yet, so read on.\n\nAnd since this isn't about cryptocurrencies vs. fiat currencies let's stop using the word *currency*. It's a head fake. It has way too much baggage and I notice that when you talk about Bitcoin in public you keep comparing it to the Dollar, Euro, and Yen. That comparison won't help you understand what's going on. In fact, it's getting in the way. So for the rest of this note, I will refer to cryptocurrencies as *crypto assets*.\n\nSo, to repeat: crypto assets are a *new asset class* that enable decentralized applications.\n\nAnd like every other asset class, they exist as a mechanism to *allocate resources to a specific form of organization*. Despite the myopic focus on trading crypto assets recently, they don't exist solely to be traded. That is, in principle at least, they don't exist for their own sake.\n\nTo understand what I mean, think about other asset classes and what form of organization they serve:\n\n- Corporate equities serve companies\n- Government bonds serve nations, states, municipalities\n- Mortgages serve property owners\n\nAnd now:\n\n- Crypto assets serve decentralized applications\n\nDecentralized applications are a *new form of organization* and a *new form of software*. They're a new model for creating, financing, and operating software services in a way that is decentralized top-to-bottom. That doesn't make them better or worse than existing software models or corporate entities. As we'll see later, there are trade-offs. What we can say for now is simply that they are radically different from the forms of software and organization we are used to.\n\nHow different? Imagine the following: you grew up in a rainforest and I brought you a cactus and told you it was a tree. How would you react? You'd probably laugh and say it's not a tree because there's no point in a tree being a stumpy water tank covered in armor  —  after all, water is abundant here in the rainforest! This, roughly, is the reaction of many people working in Silicon Valley to decentralized applications and DAOs.\n\nBut I digress. I owe you an important explanation:\n\n**What is a decentralized application?**\n\nA decentralized application is a way to create a service that no single entity operates.\n\nWe'll come to the question of *whether that's useful* in a moment. But first, you need to understand how they work.\n\nLet's go back to the birth of this idea.\n\nIt's November 2008. The nadir of the financial crisis.\n\nAn anonymous person publishes a paper explaining how to make electronic payments without a trusted central party like Chase or PayPal or the Federal Reserve. It's the first *decentralized application* of this kind ever proposed.\n\nIt's a decentralized application *for payments*.\n\nThe paper is titled [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).\n\nHow does it work? How is it possible to send an electronic payment without a designated party who will track and update everyone's balances? If I hand you a dollar that's one thing. But data is not a bearer instrument. Data needs intermediation and validation to be trusted.\n\nThe paper proposes a solution: form a peer-to-peer network. Make it public. Announce your transaction to everyone. In your announcement, point to the specific funds on the network you want to spend. Cryptographically sign your announcement with the same software key that is linked to those funds so we know they're yours.\n\nIt almost works. We need one more thing: a way to make sure that if you broadcast two competing announcements (that is, if you try to spend the same funds twice) that only one of your attempts counts.\n\n*Bad solution:* designate a party to timestamp the transactions and only include the transaction that came first. We're back to square one. We have a trusted intermediary.\n\n*Breakthrough solution:* let entities compete to be the \"timestamper!\" We can't avoid the need for one, but we can avoid designating one in advance or using the same one for every batch of transactions.\n\n\"Let entities compete.\" Sounds like a market economy. What's missing? A reward for winning. An incentive. An asset.\n\nLet's call that asset Bitcoin. Let's call the entities competing for the right to timestamp the latest batch of announced transactions \"miners.\" Let's make sure anyone can join this contest at any time by making the code and network open.\n\nNow we need an actual contest. The paper proposes one. On your mark, get set: find a random number generated by the network! The number is really, really hard to find. So hard that the only way to find it is to use tons of processing power and burn through electricity. It's a computing version of what Veruca Salt made her dad and his poor factory workers do in Willy Wonka. A brute force search for a golden ticket (or in this case, a golden number).\n\n[Actual Bitcoin mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9mba2qb9do)\n\nWhy the elaborate and expensive competition to do something as simple as timestamp transactions for the network? So that we can be sure the competitors have incurred a *real financial cost*. That way, if they win the race to find the random number and become the designated timestamper for a given batch of transactions, they won't use that power for evil (like censoring transactions). Instead, they will meticulously scan each pending transaction, eliminate any attempts by users to spend the same funds twice, ensure all rules are followed, and broadcast the validated batch to the rest of the network.\n\nBecause if they do indeed follow the rules, the network is programmed to reward them...\n\n...with newly minted Bitcoin, plus the transaction fees, denominated in Bitcoin, paid by the senders. (See why they are called miners and not timestampers, now?)\n\nIn other words, miners follow the rules because it is in their economic self-interest to do the right thing.\n\nYou know, like Adam Smith said:\n\nIt is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self interest.\n\nCrypto assets: the invisible hand... of the internet.\n\nBitcoin is capitalism, distilled. You should love it!\n\nAnd since these miners have debts to pay (mostly electricity bills), they will likely sell their newly earned Bitcoins on the open market in exchange for whatever real currency they need to satisfy their liabilities. Anything left is profit. The Bitcoin is now in circulation. People who need it can buy it. And so can people who just want to speculate on it. (More on the people who \"need it\" vs. those who are speculating later.)\n\nEureka! We have killed two birds with one stone: the financial reward that substitutes our need for a trusted central party with a marketplace of competing yet honest timestampers *is the same asset* that ends up in circulation for use as a *digital bearer instrument* in an electronic payments network that has no central party (it's circular, I know).\n\nNow that you understand Bitcoin, let's generalize this to decentralized applications as a whole.\n\n**In general, a decentralized application allows you to do something you can already do today (like payments) but without a trusted central party.**\n\nHere's another example: a decentralized application called Filecoin enables users to store files on a peer-to-peer network of computers instead of in a centralized file storage service like Dropbox or Amazon S3. Its crypto asset, also called Filecoin, incentivizes entities to share excess hard drive space with the network.\n\nDigital file storage is not new. Neither is electronic payments. What's new is that they can be operated without a company. A new form of organization.\n\nOne more example.\n\nWarning: this one is a bit confusing because it's *meta*.\n\nThere's a decentralized application called Ethereum that is *a decentralized application for launching decentralized applications.* I am sure by now you have heard of \"initial coin offerings\" (ICOs) and \"tokens.\" Most of these are issued on top of Ethereum. Instead of building a decentralized application from scratch the way Bitcoin was, you can build one on top of Ethereum much more easily because a) the network already exists and b) it's not designed for a specific application but rather as a platform to build applications that can execute arbitrary code. It is \"featureless.\"\n\nEthereum's protocol incentivizes entities to contribute *computing resources* to the network. Doing so earns these entities Ether, the crypto asset of Ethereum. This makes Ethereum a new kind of computing platform for this new class of software (decentralized apps). It's not cloud computing because Ethereum itself is decentralized (like *aether*, get it?). That's why its founder, Vitalik Buterin, refers to Ethereum as a \"world computer.\"\n\nTo summarize, in just the last few years the world has invented a way to create software services that have no central operator. These services are called decentralized applications and they are enabled with crypto assets that incentivize entities on the internet to contribute resources —  processing, storage, computing  —  necessary for the service to function.\n\nIt's worth pausing to acknowledge that this is kind of *miraculous*. With just the internet, an open protocol, and a new kind of asset, we can instantiate networks that dynamically assemble the resources necessary to provide many kinds of services.\n\nAnd there are a lot of people who think this model is the future of all software, the thing that will finally challenge the FANG stocks and venture capital to boot.\n\nBut there's a problem.\n\nIt's not clear yet that decentralized applications are actually useful to most people relative to traditional software.\n\nSimply put, you cannot argue that for everyone Bitcoin is better than PayPal or Chase. Or that for everyone Filecoin is better than Dropbox or iCloud. Or that for everyone Ethereum is better than Amazon EC2 or Azure.\n\nIn fact, on almost every dimension, decentralized services have key drawbacks relative to their centralized counterparts:\n\n- They are slower\n- They are more expensive\n- They are less scalable\n- They have worse user experiences\n- They have volatile and uncertain governance\n\nAnd no, this isn't just because they are new. This won't fundamentally change with bigger blocks, lightning networks, sharding, forks, self-amending ledgers, or any other technical solutions.\n\nThat's because there are structural trade-offs that result directly from the primary design goal of these services, beneath which all other goals must be subordinated in order for them to be relevant: *decentralization*.\n\nRemember that \"elaborate and expensive competition\" I described? Well, it comes at the cost of throughput. Remember how users need to \"cryptographically sign\" their transaction announcements? Well, those private keys need to be held onto much more securely than a typical password (passwords can be recovered). Remember how \"no single entity operates\" these networks? The flip side is that there is no clear way to make decisions or govern them.\n\nSure, you can make decentralized applications more efficient and user friendly by, for example, centralizing users' cryptographic signing keys (i.e., control of their coins) with a trusted entity. But then we're mostly back to square one and would be better off using a service that is centralized.\n\nThus, bitcoin, for example, isn't best described as \"Decentralized PayPal.\" It's more accurate to say it's an extremely inefficient electronic payments network, *but in exchange we get decentralization*.\n\nBottom line: centralized applications tend to beat decentralized applications on virtually every dimension.\n\n**EXCEPT FOR ONE DIMENSION.**\n\nAnd not only are decentralized applications better at this one thing, they are the only way we can achieve it.\n\nWhat am I referring to?\n\n**Censorship resistance.**\n\nThis is where we come to the elusive signal in the noise.\n\nCensorship resistance means that access to decentralized applications is open and unfettered. Transactions on these services are *unstoppable*.\n\nMore concretely, nothing can stop me from sending Bitcoin to anyone I please. Nothing can stop me from executing code on Ethereum. Nothing can stop me from storing files on Filecoin. As long as I have an internet connection and pay the network's transaction fee, denominated in its crypto asset, I am free to do what I want.\n\n(If Bitcoin is capitalism distilled, it's also a kind of freedom distilled.)\n\nAnd for crypto enthusiasts that don't want to take my word for it, will you listen to Adam Back and Charlie Lee?\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ee4fbcb7-432a-4282-8752-caec90dc8210.jpeg?height=212&width=691)\n\n**So while we can't say \"for everyone Bitcoin is better than Visa,\" it is possible that for some cohort of users Bitcoin truly is the only way to make a payment.**\n\nMore generally, we can ask:\n\nFor whom is this the right trade-off?\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/06abc035-7c45-45d0-a505-58a7d0de5a67.jpeg?height=339&width=717)\n\nWho needs censorship resistance so much that they are willing to trade away the speed, cost, scalability, and experience benefits of centralized services?\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying you have to make this trade-off *in order to buy/speculate on crypto assets.* I am saying that in order for decentralized applications themselves to have utility to some cohort, that cohort must be optimizing for censorship resistance.\n\n**So, who are these people?**\n\nWhile there is not a lot of good data, actual *users* of decentralized applications seem to fall into two categories:\n\n1. People who are off the grid: that is, in countries where access to competently operated traditional services is limited (for any number of reasons) but where internet is not\n\n2. People who want to be off the grid: that is, people who don't want their transactions censored or known\n\nWith that framework in mind we can ask:\n\n- For whom is Bitcoin the best/only way to make a payment?\n- For whom is Filecoin the best/only way to store a file?\n- For whom is Ethereum the best/only way to compute code?\n\nThese are the questions that get at the heart of the value proposition of the technology.\n\nSo far, most decentralized applications have very little use relative to traditional services. Bitcoin, for example, has fewer mainstream merchants accepting it as a payment option in the U.S. today than in 2014. And for all the talk of Bitcoin's value as a payments system in developing countries or emerging markets like China, it is traditional software (i.e., apps) like AliPay and Paytm that are actually driving sweeping change in payments in these markets.\n\nAt the same time, use of Bitcoin on the dark web and for ransomware is evident, even if it is hard to get good data.\n\nBut aren't people using Bitcoin as a \"store of value?\" Sure, which is just another way of saying people are investing in Bitcoin with a long time horizon. But remember I'm not talking about investing in the crypto asset yet. I'm talking about whether there are people who find a *decentralized application for payments* (which is enabled by that asset) useful. Real estate is only a good store of value *in the long run* if people live and work in the buildings. The same is true of decentralized applications.\n\nWhat should we make of Ethereum evaluated through the \"censorship resistance\" lens? After all, it seems to be getting a ton of use by developers. Since Ethereum is a developer platform for decentralized applications, does that mean it is developers who have been censored or blocked somehow? In a way, yes. Developers and start-ups who wish to build financial products do not have open and unfettered access to the world's financial infrastructure. While Ethereum doesn't provide access to that infrastructure, it does provide a different infrastructure that can be used to, for example, create and execute a financial contract.\n\nSince Ethereum is a platform, its value is ultimately a function of the value of the applications built on top. In other words, we can ask if Ethereum is useful by simply asking if anything that has been built on Ethereum is useful. For example, do we need censorship resistant prediction markets? Censorship resistant meme playing cards? Censorship resistant versions of YouTube or Twitter? What are – or will be – the killer applications on Ethereum?\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nGiven how different they are from the app models we know and love, will anyone *ever really use* decentralized applications? Will they become a critical part of the economy? It's hard to predict because it depends in part on the technology's evolution but far more on society's reaction to it.\n\nFor example: until relatively recently, encrypted messaging was only used by hackers, spies, and paranoids. That didn't seem to be changing. Until it did. Post-Snowden and post-Trump, everyone from Silicon Valley to the Acela corridor seems to be on either Signal or Telegram. WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted. The press solicit tips through SecureDrop. Yes, the technology got a little better and easier to use. But it is mainly changes in society that are driving adoption.\n\nIn other words, we grew up in the rainforest, but sometimes things change and it helps to know how to adapt to other environments.\n\nAnd this is the basic argument that the smart money is making on crypto assets and decentralized applications: that it's simply too early to say anything. That it is a profound change. That, should one or more of these decentralized applications actually become an integral part of the world, their underlying crypto assets will be extremely valuable. So might as well start placing bets now and see how it goes. Don't get to hung up on whether we see the killer apps yet.\n\nThat's not a bad argument and I tend to agree.\n\n**I would summarize the argument as:** in the long-run, a crypto asset's value is driven by use of the decentralized application it enables. While it's early, the high valuations are justified because even if the probability of mass adoption is small, the impact would be very large, so might as well go along for the ride and see what happens.\n\n**But how do we explain the recent mania?**\n\nBitcoin is up 5x in a year, Ethereum is up 30x. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is ~$175B, up from $12B just a year ago. Why?\n\nAs in every mania in history, it is currently rational to be irrational.\n\nTo understand what's going on, let's look at the buyer and seller mentality right now, starting with the buyers.\n\nIf you invested early in Bitcoin or Ethereum, you are sitting on a windfall. It feels like you are playing with \"house money,\" [a well-known psychological effect](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/1154/thaler_and_johnson.pdf). You feel smart and willing to risk more than you otherwise would if it was \"your money.\" Might as well diversify a bit and parlay your gains into the next crypto asset, or two, or three.\n\nIf you *didn't* invest, the fear-of-missing-out continues to build until the \"screw it\" moment when you buy in. Maybe you read about Bitcoin, didn't understand it, and followed Warren Buffet's (typically good) advice not to invest in things you don't understand. Some of your friends made money but you still ignored it. Then you read about Ethereum, which you *really* didn't understand, also passed on buying, and later found out that your friends are planning to retire because they did. The lesson seems to be *anti-Buffet*: only invest in things you *don't understand*. This is causing people to check their judgement at the door when the latest all-time high finally convinces them to jump into the market.\n\nAnd that is not good.\n\nBecause there will be sellers to fill the demand, especially the demand coming from people who have decided they will never understand this stuff so will just place bets on things that *sound complex and impressive.*\n\nLet's think about these sellers. And by sellers, I don't mean people selling their holdings of existing crypto assets. I mean new issuers. Teams launching new crypto assets.\n\nThe basic model is to pre-sell some percentage of the crypto assets the proposed network will generate as a way to fund the development of the decentralized application before it launches. The project founders tend to hold on to some percentage of these assets. Which means that raising money for a project this way is a) non-dilutive as it is not equity and b) not debt, so you never have to pay anyone back. This is basically free money. It's never been this good for entrepreneurs, even in the 90s dot-com boom. Which makes it incredibly tempting to try and shoe-horn every project that *could perhaps* justify an \"initial coin offering\" to go for it, even if they aren't actually building a *decentralized* application. After all, an ICO lets you exit before you even launch.\n\nAnd there is a pervasive narrative out there that supports entrepreneurs looking to create new crypto assets. The idea is that by selling assets to users before your network launches, you create \"evangelists\" who will be early users and promoters you wouldn't otherwise have if there were no financial incentive to participate in your community.\n\nThe problem with this line of thinking is that it conflates early *investors* with early *users*. The overlap between people who buy your crypto asset and people who actually want to use the service you are building is likely very, very small, especially during market manias like this one. It creates a false sense of \"product-market fit.\" Yes, people are buying your crypto asset. But that's because the \"market\" are people who want to get rich and the \"product\" you are selling is a \"way to get rich.\"\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c381a715-69d6-4b9f-ae99-f7066c7b4150.jpeg?height=345&width=727)\n\nBut \"this is fine.\"\n\nEveryone's making money. For now.\n\nIt's currently rational to be irrational.\n\nAs long as that blue line keeps going up.\n\n> Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked.\n\n**At the same time, I wouldn't bet against crypto assets.**\n\n> He who lives by the crystal ball will eat shattered glass.\n\nConsider the following. The total market cap of crypto assets has been increasing by an *order of magnitude* every few years. Where will they be in 2022? It's certain that many (most?) of the crypto assets launching today won't make it. But neither did most of the ones that were launched back in the 2013/4 boom (when they were referred to as \"alt coins\"). Though an important alt coin from 2014 did stick around and drove the most recent boom to new heights by being the platform to power all the others: Ethereum.\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/97c6751e-3218-4407-a71f-e00e0fe3babe.jpeg?height=190&width=721)\n\n**So, Jamie, what's the bottom line?**\n\nAllow me to summarize.\n\n- Cryptocurrencies (which I prefer to call crypto assets) are a new asset class that enable decentralized applications\n\n- Decentralized applications enable services we already have today, like payments, storage, or computing, but without a central operator of those services\n\n- Today, this software model is useful to people who need censorship resistance which tend to be people that are either off the grid or who want to be off the grid\n\n- For now, most people are better off using normal applications because they are 10x better on every other dimension\n\n- Society's embrace or rejection of new technology is hard to predict (think about encrypted messaging)\n\n- In the long-run, the value of a crypto asset will rise and fall in proportion to the use of the decentralized applications it enables\n\n- In the short-run, there will be extreme volatility as FOMO competes with FUD, confusion competes with understanding, and greed competes with fear (on both the buyer side and the issuer side)\n\n- Most people buying into crypto assets have checked their judgement at the door\n\n- Many sellers of new crypto assets aren't actually building decentralized applications but are instead shoe-horning an ICO into their service because of the market mania; that doesn't mean decentralized applications are bad, it just means people are capitalizing on the confusion and are probably themselves confused\n\n- Don't bet against crypto assets in the long-run: as we approach the 10 year anniversary of the Bitcoin paper it is clear that they aren't going anywhere and that decentralized applications may very well find an important place alongside all the other forms of organization we have come to take for granted.\n\nBest,\nAdam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1614696922, "digest": "Q-HIDLBN0lRy1ezLFI-Qj5JhLzHWRUgXF4cqwieQWXQ", "contributor": "0x8a32Af4AfFD816978C2Fdfa7C08c27681d05d4Fe"}

When I started [the firm](http://coolmanagers.com), I believed one thing about the music industry very firmly: ownership endows power. Typically, labels had ownership over the music, and thus, power over artists. \n\nOur goal was to help artists retain ownership of their work and run their business independently, using technology to reach their fans directly. Today, we’re all creators online, and ownership continues to carry a ton of weight. Yet the role of ownership on technology platforms is often overlooked.\n\nEvery day billions of images, videos, songs, and more media are shared on social media. When those files are posted, a copy of the media is taken from the creator’s device and pasted to the server of the platform distributing it—Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok and the like. \n\nThis may seem like a lightweight interaction, but when uploading, creators don’t simply copy a file—**they also copy-paste ownership of the file to the platform itself.**\n\nI’m talking about the Terms of Service, which typically specify that when a file is uploaded, its ownership is shared with the platform, to monetize as they see fit. This comes with some advantages: platforms can offer distribution or economies of scale that optimize ad-based revenues. But it's no secret that today’s monetization models aren’t always aligned with the best interests of creators. And this is where the problem lies. For too long, platforms have reaped the bulk of the value from owning creators' content.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto is unlocking a different path—what I call the [Ownership Economy](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/)—a broader thesis that the next generation of internet platforms will be built, operated, and *owned by users directly*. \n\n[TOE](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software)\n\nIn media, NFTs—or Non-Fungible Tokens—make it possible for creators to retain ownership of their content, without limiting the propagation of their files across the internet. As a result, NFTs have the potential to invert the ownership model of media—offering creators, their audiences, and developers who build for them, a viable alternative to platform-driven monetization.  \n\n**A simple way to think about NFTs are as files that live on the blockchain.**  This means they can't be copy-pasted, edited, deleted, or otherwise manipulated. \n\nThese guarantees stem from the same technical properties that make cryptocurrencies valuable: like Bitcoin, NFTs are digital tokens that can be bought, sold, traded, and whose ownership and provenance are always immutably tracked by the blockchain. What's yours is yours, verifiably so, and without the need for any third party to intermediate that ownership.\n\n**NFTs make it possible to own digital media assets in the same way that you can own a digital currency asset, like Bitcoin.** \n\nTo many, NFTs look like a new tech toy, a soon-to-burst bubble. And while it's true the money being spent on digital art and crypto collectibles has been fast and flashy, their utility stands in sharp relief to the way platforms enable creator monetization today.\n\nI believe we are well on our way to **NFTs becoming the \"port of entry\" for every piece of media on the internet**. This includes the 2D audio/visual and text-based work of the web, and the emerging 3D work that will encompass the metaverse of games and virtual worlds tomorrow.\n\nWhat I believe will pull this future forward is the fact that the business model enabled by NFTs is better for every stakeholder involved: **creators, their audiences, and developers can all make more money in a marketplace built around true digital ownership.**\n\nTo unpack this further, I'll address some common questions I've heard about NFTs. Many of the answers below expand on tweetstorms I’ve written over the last few years.\n\n### How do NFTs work?\n\n[NFT is a file format](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1321239372449153024)\n\nIn practice, an NFT is simply a unique token representing a digital file. Each has a canonical identifier, a unique ID. Hooked to that ID is arbitrary metadata, for example, who created it, what it’s about, or its price history. When an NFT is minted by a creator, this information is immutably registered on the blockchain and becomes a sort of digital passport for the work. Moving forward, anytime that piece of media is distributed on another platform, that platform can \"check its passport\" and see its entire history. This means that instances of an idea can point back to the original, immutable record registered on the blockchain. An image on the internet no longer needs to be a two-dimensional box. Instead, it can take on a “Z-Axis” where all of its history and context can be discovered by third-parties, adding to its cultural and financial value.\n\n### Is there value in owning digital art? \n\n[The value of an NFT](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1321447490370080769?s=20)\n\nA common critique is that because digital art and digital collectibles can be copied, they don’t carry much value. But NFTs introduce a new possibility that enables true ownership to exist while a work continues to freely circulate online.  \n \nThe more a file is shared and seen online, the more cultural value it accrues. Consider the mass production of posters and t-shirts of Warhol imagery. With increase in notoriety, the concept of owning the canonical work becomes more thrilling, and more a marker of social status. It can also drive up the value that can be derived from reselling the work should its notoriety increase after purchase. NFTs enable collectors to reap most of the benefits of owning a physical work of art, with the added bonus that their collection can be freely shared across the internet without limitation—and thus accrue more value with wider distribution.\n\nAnd its not just art. The growing universe of crypto collectibles, game assets, digital fashion, skins, and more blurs the line between art and programmed utility. More on that below. \n\n### Why collect NFTs right now? \n \nPeople collect NFTs for a number of reasons. It could be the thrill of discovering a promising new artist or artwork, the allure of a piece’s potential cultural value, the social status of owning something unique and canonical, or the prospect of turning a profit by reselling the work down the line. \n \nRight now, in NFTs (and in other crypto markets) many collect for speculative value. And like the rest of the crypto market, **NFT markets are reflexive.** Just like cryptocurrencies and traditional art, the more people who think an asset might have value—even for subjective reasons—the more real value it can typically fetch in the market. \n \nAs an example of this, the reflexivity of Bitcoin markets began as the currency bootstrapped its popularity, eventually growing in momentum from a pizza memecoin to a global reserve asset. Similarly, NFTs may start out looking like fun and games for crypto whales, but as more money flows into these markets—and as more creators mint tokens and get involved—outsiders will start to see value changing hands, and the perceived value will rise. This kind of reflexivity creates a positive feedback loop that, in many instances, helps drive an inevitable rise in market activity over time. \n \n### Longterm, where are NFTs heading?\n\n[Media Legos](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1301669871789445122)\n\nComing back to utility: as with many technological hype cycles, speculative value often gives way to functional value. Because these assets are programmable and open, any developer can build on top of them. And because NFTs are user-portable, programmable assets can take on new utility across the totality of our digital world.\n\nTokens and smart contracts have been called \"money legos\" as they allow programmers to [compose and remix](https://jessewalden.com/4-eras-of-blockchain-computing-degrees-of-composability/) DeFi applications. Similarly, NFTs are \"media legos\" for developers and creators to permissionlessly remix and build new experiences around. As a result, users can look forward to richer experiences, and compounding utility around the items they own. \n\n### Is NFT adoption inevitable? \n\n[port of entry](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1346470700979089414)\n\nI think NFTs will become the port of entry to all internet media **because everyone involved can make more money from the markets they enable**: \n\n**Creators** make more money by selling directly to their fans and by collecting royalties every time their NFTs are resold. This is an entirely new revenue stream that is only possible because of true digital ownership that can encode royalty logic in the media itself.\n\nFor **consumers**, NFTs are a better model because they combine the social and utilitarian benefits of patronage with the *possibility* of turning a profit or realizing compounding utility. On the web today, consumers rent access to most goods and services, including the creators they patronize. A key tenet of new Ownership Economy platforms is the incentive alignment that comes from having skin in the game. With regard to supporting creators, I've called this “[Patronage+](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1355165547441303554)” where the “plus” is the possibility of earning value alongside the creators you support. This is a strong, under-explored incentive to become a patron in the first place—and I think it may drive more engaging and rewarding demand in markets for creative work.\n\n**Developers** can make money by building to enable these new markets. Wheras major platforms choke access to developer APIs and limit free market development, developers building atop permissionless infrastructure stand to step into the flow of a growing market-economy with property rights that in many ways, function more like those in the physical world.\n\n### Where are we in the NFT adoption cycle?\n\n[frenzy](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1335979344225820673)\n\nThe backdrop of the 2021 crypto/everything-bull market, coupled with the internet waking up to investing as a team sport (WallStreetBets), has created the right conditions for NFT markets to enter their frenzy stage, capturing mainstream attention and serious money.\n\nMuch of it is taking place in the digital art space, but it’s also happening in burgeoning niches—including gaming world assets like [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), or sets of crypto collectibles like [Hashmasks](https://www.thehashmasks.com/) and [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), or generative artworks that are programmatically created on-chain (like [this series](https://www.artblocks.io/project/5) I commissioned for Variant:) \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/5000001)\n\nWe are also seeing new marketplaces popping up where creators can mint NFTs and connect with collectors. [Foundation](https://foundation.app) saw over $150K in sales during its first week online, including the [first Vine video ever created, which sold for $14K](https://foundation.app/dom/summer-night-77). VCs are [buying AI-generated artworks for their portfolios](https://twitter.com/NTmoney/status/1346642772397199360?s=20) (myself included.)  The decentralized blogging platform on which I am publishing this essay, [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz), recently [crowdfunded $13,000+ for an essay](https://twitter.com/viamirror/status/1359990786985766918?s=20) that was subsequently auctioned as an NFT, earning the crowdfunders royalties on their investment. \n \nThis is all happening despite the fact that it’s still fairly clunky and expensive to engage with NFTs on Ethereum. Minting a single NFT costs roughly $100 in ETH, and buying and trading incurs high transaction fees. \n\nBut 2021 is also the year major technical upgrades are set to arrive in the crypto space. Reduced transaction costs and higher throughput will help developers push NFTs into higher-volume, social territory.

When I started [the firm](http://coolmanagers.com), I believed one thing about the music industry very firmly: ownership endows power. Typically, labels had ownership over the music, and thus, power over artists. \n\nOur goal was to help artists retain ownership of their work and run their business independently, using technology to reach their fans directly. Today, we’re all creators online, and ownership continues to carry a ton of weight. Yet the role of ownership on technology platforms is often overlooked.\n\nEvery day billions of images, videos, songs, and more media are shared on social media. When those files are posted, a copy of the media is taken from the creator’s device and pasted to the server of the platform distributing it—Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok and the like. \n\nThis may seem like a lightweight interaction, but when uploading, creators don’t simply copy a file—**they also copy-paste ownership of the file to the platform itself.**\n\nI’m talking about the Terms of Service, which typically specify that when a file is uploaded, its ownership is shared with the platform, to monetize as they see fit. This comes with some advantages: platforms can offer distribution or economies of scale that optimize ad-based revenues. But it's no secret that today’s monetization models aren’t always aligned with the best interests of creators. And this is where the problem lies. For too long, platforms have reaped the bulk of the value from owning creators' content.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto is unlocking a different path—what I call the [Ownership Economy](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/)—a broader thesis that the next generation of internet platforms will be built, operated, and *owned by users directly*. \n\n[TOE](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software)\n\nIn media, NFTs—or Non-Fungible Tokens—make it possible for creators to retain ownership of their content, without limiting the propagation of their files across the internet. As a result, NFTs have the potential to invert the ownership model of media—offering creators, their audiences, and developers who build for them, a viable alternative to platform-driven monetization.  \n\n**A simple way to think about NFTs are as files that live on the blockchain.**  This means they can't be copy-pasted, edited, deleted, or otherwise manipulated. \n\nThese guarantees stem from the same technical properties that make cryptocurrencies valuable: like Bitcoin, NFTs are digital tokens that can be bought, sold, traded, and whose ownership and provenance are always immutably tracked by the blockchain. What's yours is yours, verifiably so, and without the need for any third party to intermediate that ownership.\n\n**NFTs make it possible to own digital media assets in the same way that you can own a digital financial asset.** \n\nTo many, NFTs look like a new tech toy, a soon-to-burst bubble. And while it's true the money being spent on digital art and crypto collectibles has been fast and flashy, their utility stands in sharp relief to the way platforms enable creator monetization today.\n\nI believe we are well on our way to **NFTs becoming the \"port of entry\" for every piece of media on the internet**. This includes the 2D audio/visual and text-based work of the web, and the emerging 3D work that will encompass the metaverse of games and virtual worlds tomorrow.\n\nWhat I believe will pull this future forward is the fact that the business model enabled by NFTs is better for every stakeholder involved: **creators, their audiences, and developers can all make more money in a marketplace built around true digital ownership.**\n\nTo unpack this further, I'll address some common questions I've heard about NFTs. Many of the answers below expand on tweetstorms I’ve written over the last few years.\n\n### How do NFTs work?\n\n[NFT is a file format](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1321239372449153024)\n\nIn practice, an NFT is simply a unique token representing a digital file. Each has a canonical identifier, a unique ID. Hooked to that ID is arbitrary metadata, for example, who created it, what it’s about, or its price history. When an NFT is minted by a creator, this information is immutably registered on the blockchain and becomes a sort of digital passport for the work. Moving forward, anytime that piece of media is distributed on another platform, that platform can \"check its passport\" and see its entire history. This means that instances of an idea can point back to the original, immutable record registered on the blockchain. An image on the internet no longer needs to be a two-dimensional box. Instead, it can take on a “Z-Axis” where all of its history and context can be discovered by third-parties, adding to its cultural and financial value.\n\n### Is there value in owning digital art? \n\n[The value of an NFT](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1321447490370080769?s=20)\n\nA common critique is that because digital art and digital collectibles can be copied, they don’t carry much value. But NFTs introduce a new possibility that enables true ownership to exist while a work continues to freely circulate online.  \n \nThe more a file is shared and seen online, the more cultural value it accrues. Consider the mass production of posters and t-shirts of Warhol imagery. With increase in notoriety, the concept of owning the canonical work becomes more thrilling, and more a marker of social status. It can also drive up the value that can be derived from reselling the work should its notoriety increase after purchase. NFTs enable collectors to reap most of the benefits of owning a physical work of art, with the added bonus that their collection can be freely shared across the internet without limitation—and thus accrue more value with wider distribution.\n\nAnd its not just art. The growing universe of crypto collectibles, game assets, digital fashion, skins, and more blurs the line between art and programmed utility. More on that below. \n\n### Why collect NFTs right now? \n \nPeople collect NFTs for a number of reasons. It could be the thrill of discovering a promising new artist or artwork, the allure of a piece’s potential cultural value, the social status of owning something unique and canonical, or the prospect of turning a profit by reselling the work down the line. \n \nRight now, in NFTs (and in other crypto markets) many collect for speculative value. And like the rest of the crypto market, **NFT markets are reflexive.** Just like cryptocurrencies and traditional art, the more people who think an asset might have value—even for subjective reasons—the more real value it can typically fetch in the market. \n \nAs an example of this, the reflexivity of Bitcoin markets began as the currency bootstrapped its popularity, eventually growing in momentum from a pizza memecoin to a global reserve asset. Similarly, NFTs may start out looking like fun and games for crypto whales, but as more money flows into these markets—and as more creators mint tokens and get involved—outsiders will start to see value changing hands, and the perceived value will rise. This kind of reflexivity creates a positive feedback loop that, in many instances, helps drive an inevitable rise in market activity over time. \n \n### Longterm, where are NFTs heading?\n\n[Media Legos](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1301669871789445122)\n\nComing back to utility: as with many technological hype cycles, speculative value often gives way to functional value. Because these assets are programmable and open, any developer can build on top of them. And because NFTs are user-portable, programmable assets can take on new utility across the totality of our digital world.\n\nTokens and smart contracts have been called \"money legos\" as they allow programmers to [compose and remix](https://jessewalden.com/4-eras-of-blockchain-computing-degrees-of-composability/) DeFi applications. Similarly, NFTs are \"media legos\" for developers and creators to permissionlessly remix and build new experiences around. As a result, users can look forward to richer experiences, and compounding utility around the items they own. \n\n### Is NFT adoption inevitable? \n\n[port of entry](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1346470700979089414)\n\nI think NFTs will become the port of entry to all internet media **because everyone involved can make more money from the markets they enable**: \n\n**Creators** make more money by selling directly to their fans and by collecting royalties every time their NFTs are resold. This is an entirely new revenue stream that is only possible because of true digital ownership that can encode royalty logic in the media itself.\n\nFor **consumers**, NFTs are a better model because they combine the social and utilitarian benefits of patronage with the *possibility* of turning a profit or realizing compounding utility. On the web today, consumers rent access to most goods and services, including the creators they patronize. A key tenet of new Ownership Economy platforms is the incentive alignment that comes from having skin in the game. With regard to supporting creators, I've called this “[Patronage+](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1355165547441303554)” where the “plus” is the possibility of earning value alongside the creators you support. This is a strong, under-explored incentive to become a patron in the first place—and I think it may drive more engaging and rewarding demand in markets for creative work.\n\n**Developers** can make money by building to enable these new markets. Wheras major platforms choke access to developer APIs and limit free market development, developers building atop permissionless infrastructure stand to step into the flow of a growing market-economy with property rights that in many ways, function more like those in the physical world.\n\n### Where are we in the NFT adoption cycle?\n\n[frenzy](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1335979344225820673)\n\nThe backdrop of the 2021 crypto/everything-bull market, coupled with the internet waking up to investing as a team sport (WallStreetBets), has created the right conditions for NFT markets to enter their frenzy stage, capturing mainstream attention and serious money.\n\nMuch of it is taking place in the digital art space, but it’s also happening in burgeoning niches—including gaming world assets like [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), or sets of crypto collectibles like [Hashmasks](https://www.thehashmasks.com/) and [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), or generative artworks that are programmatically created on-chain (like [this series](https://www.artblocks.io/project/5) I commissioned for Variant:) \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/5000001)\n\nWe are also seeing new marketplaces popping up where creators can mint NFTs and connect with collectors. [Foundation](https://foundation.app) saw over $150K in sales during its first week online, including the [first Vine video ever created, which sold for $14K](https://foundation.app/dom/summer-night-77). VCs are [buying AI-generated artworks for their portfolios](https://twitter.com/NTmoney/status/1346642772397199360?s=20) (myself included.)  The decentralized blogging platform on which I am publishing this essay, [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz), recently [crowdfunded $13,000+ for an essay](https://twitter.com/viamirror/status/1359990786985766918?s=20) that was subsequently auctioned as an NFT, earning the crowdfunders royalties on their investment. \n \nThis is all happening despite the fact that it’s still fairly clunky and expensive to engage with NFTs on Ethereum. Minting a single NFT costs roughly $100 in ETH, and buying and trading incurs high transaction fees. \n\nBut 2021 is also the year major technical upgrades are set to arrive in the crypto space. Reduced transaction costs and higher throughput will help developers push NFTs into higher-volume, social territory. [Zora](https://zora.co) is heading that direction with a Tumblr-like interface where each “post” is minted as an NFT. Because these social experiences have markets baked-in, and users can make money alongside the creators they support, there are strong incentives to participate. \n \nAnd remember, these are not just collectors’ items, they are programmable assets that any developer can remix. As developers build new contexts for NFTs to live, there will be compounding demand from creators to have their work included in this emerging metaverse and for collectors to flex their ownership rights. \n\n### Wrapping up\n\nIn 2014, I started a company called [Mediachain Labs](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1346490319332892674?s=20) where we were working on an open protocol called Mediachain.

{"id": "iXZFVK26lJyBktR77G9PmJm94U-vVsDq8_P1abPOq1Y", "title": "Understanding Crypto, or That Time Jamie Dimon Called", "body": "A little over three years ago, Jamie Dimon called me.\n\nBitcoin was at an all-time high. Ethereum was mooning. ICOs were pumping. And Jamie wasn't having it. He called Bitcoin a fraud.\n\nI decided to write him an open letter, and the piece went viral. Two days later, he called. He was gracious, thanked me for the explanations in the post, and asked me to spend some time with his team.\n\nBut the funny thing is, I didn't write the post for Jamie. I wrote it as a primer for people who were only paying attention to crypto because of the all-time highs. I wanted to explain to them why they should care about crypto, regardless of the price. I called it the Signal in the Noise.\n\nAnd my central point was that crypto makes whole new types of software applications (dapps) and human organization (DAOs) possible. While it was still extremely early, and while prices were disconnected from reality, it nonetheless seemed likely it would lead us to new and important frontiers. That's why we should care.\n\nIncidentally, it's also why we should care right now about NFTs and DeFi, despite similar exuberance. But that will be the subject of another post... perhaps an open letter to Larry Gagosian!\n\nI wrote the original piece on Medium, under an account associated with my company at the time, Chain. That account is [now gone](https://blog.chain.com/a-letter-to-jamie-dimon-de89d417cb80), and thus so is the post. So what better way to inaugurate this new publishing platform, itself enabled by the very ideas I wrote about in the piece, than by re-posting it here on Mirror, where I'll never have to wonder if it's \"still online.\"\n\nRe-reading the post made me cringe at times. I definitely underestimated *just how magical a superpower censorship resistance is* – specifically how it enables permissionless innovation at unheard of cycle times and decentralized collaboration that doesn't need the business models of the past to survive – and thrive. 2017 was *not that long ago* and yet web3 is happening **now** and is very real.\n\nBut it's still [not Jamie's cup of tea](https://www.coindesk.com/jamie-dimon-bitcoin-blockchain-dealbook-event).\n\nThanks to the Mirror team and community for welcoming me to this platform.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**The Signal in the Noise**\n\nOctober 2017\n\nDear Jamie,\n\nMy name is Adam Ludwin and I run a company called Chain. I have been working in and around the cryptocurrency market for several years.\n\nLast week you said a few things about Bitcoin:\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1e844f2-5256-4da1-87ee-c7947f2ad3ec.jpeg?height=194&width=800)\n\nIt's easy to believe cryptocurrencies have no inherent value. Or that governments will crush them.\n\nIt's also becoming fashionable to believe the opposite: that they will disrupt banks, governments, and Silicon Valley giants once and for all.\n\nNeither extreme is true.\n\nThe reality is nuanced and important. Which is why I've decided to write you this briefing note. I hope it helps you appreciate cryptocurrencies more deeply.\n\n**Let me start by stating that I believe:**\n\n- The market for cryptocurrencies is overheated and irrationally exuberant\n- There are a lot of poseurs creating them, and some scammers, too\n- There are a lot of conflicts of interest, self-serving hype, and obfuscation\n- Very few people in the media understand what's going on\n- Very few people in finance understand what's going on\n- Very few people in technology understand what's going on\n- Very few people in academia or government understand what's going on\n- Very few people buying cryptocurrencies understand what's going on\n- It's very possible I don't understand what's going on\n\nAlso:\n\n- Banks and governments aren't going away\n- Traditional software isn't going away\n\nIn short: there's a lot of noise. But there is also signal. To find it, we need to start by *defining* cryptocurrency.\n\nWithout a working definition we are lost. Most people arguing about cryptocurrencies are talking past each other because they don't stop to ask the other side what they think cryptocurrencies are *for*.\n\n**Here's my definition: cryptocurrencies are a *new asset class* that enable *decentralized applications*.**\n\nIf this is true, your point of view on cryptocurrencies has very little to do with what you think about them in comparison to traditional currencies or securities, and everything to do with your opinion of *decentralized applications and their value relative to current software models*.\n\nDon't have an opinion on decentralized applications? Then you can't possibly have one on cryptocurrencies yet, so read on.\n\nAnd since this isn't about cryptocurrencies vs. fiat currencies let's stop using the word *currency*. It's a head fake. It has way too much baggage and I notice that when you talk about Bitcoin in public you keep comparing it to the Dollar, Euro, and Yen. That comparison won't help you understand what's going on. In fact, it's getting in the way. So for the rest of this note, I will refer to cryptocurrencies as *crypto assets*.\n\nSo, to repeat: crypto assets are a *new asset class* that enable decentralized applications.\n\nAnd like every other asset class, they exist as a mechanism to *allocate resources to a specific form of organization*. Despite the myopic focus on trading crypto assets recently, they don't exist solely to be traded. That is, in principle at least, they don't exist for their own sake.\n\nTo understand what I mean, think about other asset classes and what form of organization they serve:\n\n- Corporate equities serve companies\n- Government bonds serve nations, states, municipalities\n- Mortgages serve property owners\n\nAnd now:\n\n- Crypto assets serve decentralized applications\n\nDecentralized applications are a *new form of organization* and a *new form of software*. They're a new model for creating, financing, and operating software services in a way that is decentralized top-to-bottom. That doesn't make them better or worse than existing software models or corporate entities. As we'll see later, there are trade-offs. What we can say for now is simply that they are radically different from the forms of software and organization we are used to.\n\nHow different? Imagine the following: you grew up in a rainforest and I brought you a cactus and told you it was a tree. How would you react? You'd probably laugh and say it's not a tree because there's no point in a tree being a stumpy water tank covered in armor  —  after all, water is abundant here in the rainforest! This, roughly, is the reaction of many people working in Silicon Valley to decentralized applications and DAOs.\n\nBut I digress. I owe you an important explanation:\n\n**What is a decentralized application?**\n\nA decentralized application is a way to create a service that no single entity operates.\n\nWe'll come to the question of *whether that's useful* in a moment. But first, you need to understand how they work.\n\nLet's go back to the birth of this idea.\n\nIt's November 2008. The nadir of the financial crisis.\n\nAn anonymous person publishes a paper explaining how to make electronic payments without a trusted central party like Chase or PayPal or the Federal Reserve. It's the first *decentralized application* of this kind ever proposed.\n\nIt's a decentralized application *for payments*.\n\nThe paper is titled [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).\n\nHow does it work? How is it possible to send an electronic payment without a designated party who will track and update everyone's balances? If I hand you a dollar that's one thing. But data is not a bearer instrument. Data needs intermediation and validation to be trusted.\n\nThe paper proposes a solution: form a peer-to-peer network. Make it public. Announce your transaction to everyone. In your announcement, point to the specific funds on the network you want to spend. Cryptographically sign your announcement with the same software key that is linked to those funds so we know they're yours.\n\nIt almost works. We need one more thing: a way to make sure that if you broadcast two competing announcements (that is, if you try to spend the same funds twice) that only one of your attempts counts.\n\n*Bad solution:* designate a party to timestamp the transactions and only include the transaction that came first. We're back to square one. We have a trusted intermediary.\n\n*Breakthrough solution:* let entities compete to be the \"timestamper!\" We can't avoid the need for one, but we can avoid designating one in advance or using the same one for every batch of transactions.\n\n\"Let entities compete.\" Sounds like a market economy. What's missing? A reward for winning. An incentive. An asset.\n\nLet's call that asset Bitcoin. Let's call the entities competing for the right to timestamp the latest batch of announced transactions \"miners.\" Let's make sure anyone can join this contest at any time by making the code and network open.\n\nNow we need an actual contest. The paper proposes one. On your mark, get set: find a random number generated by the network! The number is really, really hard to find. So hard that the only way to find it is to use tons of processing power and burn through electricity. It's a computing version of what Veruca Salt made her dad and his poor factory workers do in Willy Wonka. A brute force search for a golden ticket (or in this case, a golden number).\n\n[Actual Bitcoin mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9mba2qb9do)\n\nWhy the elaborate and expensive competition to do something as simple as timestamp transactions for the network? So that we can be sure the competitors have incurred a *real financial cost*. That way, if they win the race to find the random number and become the designated timestamper for a given batch of transactions, they won't use that power for evil (like censoring transactions). Instead, they will meticulously scan each pending transaction, eliminate any attempts by users to spend the same funds twice, ensure all rules are followed, and broadcast the validated batch to the rest of the network.\n\nBecause if they do indeed follow the rules, the network is programmed to reward them...\n\n...with newly minted Bitcoin, plus the transaction fees, denominated in Bitcoin, paid by the senders. (See why they are called miners and not timestampers, now?)\n\nIn other words, miners follow the rules because it is in their economic self-interest to do the right thing.\n\nYou know, like Adam Smith said:\n\nIt is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self interest.\n\nCrypto assets: the invisible hand... of the internet.\n\nBitcoin is capitalism, distilled. You should love it!\n\nAnd since these miners have debts to pay (mostly electricity bills), they will likely sell their newly earned Bitcoins on the open market in exchange for whatever real currency they need to satisfy their liabilities. Anything left is profit. The Bitcoin is now in circulation. People who need it can buy it. And so can people who just want to speculate on it. (More on the people who \"need it\" vs. those who are speculating later.)\n\nEureka! We have killed two birds with one stone: the financial reward that substitutes our need for a trusted central party with a marketplace of competing yet honest timestampers *is the same asset* that ends up in circulation for use as a *digital bearer instrument* in an electronic payments network that has no central party (it's circular, I know).\n\nNow that you understand Bitcoin, let's generalize this to decentralized applications as a whole.\n\n**In general, a decentralized application allows you to do something you can already do today (like payments) but without a trusted central party.**\n\nHere's another example: a decentralized application called Filecoin enables users to store files on a peer-to-peer network of computers instead of in a centralized file storage service like Dropbox or Amazon S3. Its crypto asset, also called Filecoin, incentivizes entities to share excess hard drive space with the network.\n\nDigital file storage is not new. Neither is electronic payments. What's new is that they can be operated without a company. A new form of organization.\n\nOne more example.\n\nWarning: this one is a bit confusing because it's *meta*.\n\nThere's a decentralized application called Ethereum that is *a decentralized application for launching decentralized applications.* I am sure by now you have heard of \"initial coin offerings\" (ICOs) and \"tokens.\" Most of these are issued on top of Ethereum. Instead of building a decentralized application from scratch the way Bitcoin was, you can build one on top of Ethereum much more easily because a) the network already exists and b) it's not designed for a specific application but rather as a platform to build applications that can execute arbitrary code. It is \"featureless.\"\n\nEthereum's protocol incentivizes entities to contribute *computing resources* to the network. Doing so earns these entities Ether, the crypto asset of Ethereum. This makes Ethereum a new kind of computing platform for this new class of software (decentralized apps). It's not cloud computing because Ethereum itself is decentralized (like *aether*, get it?). That's why its founder, Vitalik Buterin, refers to Ethereum as a \"world computer.\"\n\nTo summarize, in just the last few years the world has invented a way to create software services that have no central operator. These services are called decentralized applications and they are enabled with crypto assets that incentivize entities on the internet to contribute resources —  processing, storage, computing  —  necessary for the service to function.\n\nIt's worth pausing to acknowledge that this is kind of *miraculous*. With just the internet, an open protocol, and a new kind of asset, we can instantiate networks that dynamically assemble the resources necessary to provide many kinds of services.\n\nAnd there are a lot of people who think this model is the future of all software, the thing that will finally challenge the FAANG stocks and venture capital to boot.\n\nBut there's a problem.\n\nIt's not clear yet that decentralized applications are actually useful to most people relative to traditional software.\n\nSimply put, you cannot argue that for everyone Bitcoin is better than PayPal or Chase. Or that for everyone Filecoin is better than Dropbox or iCloud. Or that for everyone Ethereum is better than Amazon EC2 or Azure.\n\nIn fact, on almost every dimension, decentralized services have key drawbacks relative to their centralized counterparts:\n\n- They are slower\n- They are more expensive\n- They are less scalable\n- They have worse user experiences\n- They have volatile and uncertain governance\n\nAnd no, this isn't just because they are new. This won't fundamentally change with bigger blocks, lightning networks, sharding, forks, self-amending ledgers, or any other technical solutions.\n\nThat's because there are structural trade-offs that result directly from the primary design goal of these services, beneath which all other goals must be subordinated in order for them to be relevant: *decentralization*.\n\nRemember that \"elaborate and expensive competition\" I described? Well, it comes at the cost of throughput. Remember how users need to \"cryptographically sign\" their transaction announcements? Well, those private keys need to be held onto much more securely than a typical password (passwords can be recovered). Remember how \"no single entity operates\" these networks? The flip side is that there is no clear way to make decisions or govern them.\n\nSure, you can make decentralized applications more efficient and user friendly by, for example, centralizing users' cryptographic signing keys (i.e., control of their coins) with a trusted entity. But then we're mostly back to square one and would be better off using a service that is centralized.\n\nThus, bitcoin, for example, isn't best described as \"Decentralized PayPal.\" It's more accurate to say it's an extremely inefficient electronic payments network, *but in exchange we get decentralization*.\n\nBottom line: centralized applications tend to beat decentralized applications on virtually every dimension.\n\n**EXCEPT FOR ONE DIMENSION.**\n\nAnd not only are decentralized applications better at this one thing, they are the only way we can achieve it.\n\nWhat am I referring to?\n\n**Censorship resistance.**\n\nThis is where we come to the elusive signal in the noise.\n\nCensorship resistance means that access to decentralized applications is open and unfettered. Transactions on these services are *unstoppable*.\n\nMore concretely, nothing can stop me from sending Bitcoin to anyone I please. Nothing can stop me from executing code on Ethereum. Nothing can stop me from storing files on Filecoin. As long as I have an internet connection and pay the network's transaction fee, denominated in its crypto asset, I am free to do what I want.\n\n(If Bitcoin is capitalism distilled, it's also a kind of freedom distilled.)\n\nAnd for crypto enthusiasts that don't want to take my word for it, will you listen to Adam Back and Charlie Lee?\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ee4fbcb7-432a-4282-8752-caec90dc8210.jpeg?height=212&width=691)\n\n**So while we can't say \"for everyone Bitcoin is better than Visa,\" it is possible that for some cohort of users Bitcoin truly is the only way to make a payment.**\n\nMore generally, we can ask:\n\nFor whom is this the right trade-off?\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/06abc035-7c45-45d0-a505-58a7d0de5a67.jpeg?height=339&width=717)\n\nWho needs censorship resistance so much that they are willing to trade away the speed, cost, scalability, and experience benefits of centralized services?\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying you have to make this trade-off *in order to buy/speculate on crypto assets.* I am saying that in order for decentralized applications themselves to have utility to some cohort, that cohort must be optimizing for censorship resistance.\n\n**So, who are these people?**\n\nWhile there is not a lot of good data, actual *users* of decentralized applications seem to fall into two categories:\n\n1. People who are off the grid: that is, in countries where access to competently operated traditional services is limited (for any number of reasons) but where internet is not\n\n2. People who want to be off the grid: that is, people who don't want their transactions censored or known\n\nWith that framework in mind we can ask:\n\n- For whom is Bitcoin the best/only way to make a payment?\n- For whom is Filecoin the best/only way to store a file?\n- For whom is Ethereum the best/only way to compute code?\n\nThese are the questions that get at the heart of the value proposition of the technology.\n\nSo far, most decentralized applications have very little use relative to traditional services. Bitcoin, for example, has fewer mainstream merchants accepting it as a payment option in the U.S. today than in 2014. And for all the talk of Bitcoin's value as a payments system in developing countries or emerging markets like China, it is traditional software (i.e., apps) like AliPay and Paytm that are actually driving sweeping change in payments in these markets.\n\nAt the same time, use of Bitcoin on the dark web and for ransomware is evident, even if it is hard to get good data.\n\nBut aren't people using Bitcoin as a \"store of value?\" Sure, which is just another way of saying people are investing in Bitcoin with a long time horizon. But remember I'm not talking about investing in the crypto asset yet. I'm talking about whether there are people who find a *decentralized application for payments* (which is enabled by that asset) useful. Real estate is only a good store of value *in the long run* if people live and work in the buildings. The same is true of decentralized applications.\n\nWhat should we make of Ethereum evaluated through the \"censorship resistance\" lens? After all, it seems to be getting a ton of use by developers. Since Ethereum is a developer platform for decentralized applications, does that mean it is developers who have been censored or blocked somehow? In a way, yes. Developers and start-ups who wish to build financial products do not have open and unfettered access to the world's financial infrastructure. While Ethereum doesn't provide access to that infrastructure, it does provide a different infrastructure that can be used to, for example, create and execute a financial contract.\n\nSince Ethereum is a platform, its value is ultimately a function of the value of the applications built on top. In other words, we can ask if Ethereum is useful by simply asking if anything that has been built on Ethereum is useful. For example, do we need censorship resistant prediction markets? Censorship resistant meme playing cards? Censorship resistant versions of YouTube or Twitter? What are – or will be – the killer applications on Ethereum?\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nGiven how different they are from the app models we know and love, will anyone *ever really use* decentralized applications? Will they become a critical part of the economy? It's hard to predict because it depends in part on the technology's evolution but far more on society's reaction to it.\n\nFor example: until relatively recently, encrypted messaging was only used by hackers, spies, and paranoids. That didn't seem to be changing. Until it did. Post-Snowden and post-Trump, everyone from Silicon Valley to the Acela corridor seems to be on either Signal or Telegram. WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted. The press solicit tips through SecureDrop. Yes, the technology got a little better and easier to use. But it is mainly changes in society that are driving adoption.\n\nIn other words, we grew up in the rainforest, but sometimes things change and it helps to know how to adapt to other environments.\n\nAnd this is the basic argument that the smart money is making on crypto assets and decentralized applications: that it's simply too early to say anything. That it is a profound change. That, should one or more of these decentralized applications actually become an integral part of the world, their underlying crypto assets will be extremely valuable. So might as well start placing bets now and see how it goes. Don't get too hung up on whether we see the killer apps yet.\n\nThat's not a bad argument and I tend to agree.\n\n**I would summarize the argument as:** in the long-run, a crypto asset's value is driven by use of the decentralized application it enables. While it's early, the high valuations are justified because even if the probability of mass adoption is small, the impact would be very large, so might as well go along for the ride and see what happens.\n\n**But how do we explain the recent mania?**\n\nBitcoin is up 5x in a year, Ethereum is up 30x. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is ~$175B, up from $12B just a year ago. Why?\n\nAs in every mania in history, it is currently rational to be irrational.\n\nTo understand what's going on, let's look at the buyer and seller mentality right now, starting with the buyers.\n\nIf you invested early in Bitcoin or Ethereum, you are sitting on a windfall. It feels like you are playing with \"house money,\" [a well-known psychological effect](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/1154/thaler_and_johnson.pdf). You feel smart and willing to risk more than you otherwise would if it was \"your money.\" Might as well diversify a bit and parlay your gains into the next crypto asset, or two, or three.\n\nIf you *didn't* invest, the fear-of-missing-out continues to build until the \"screw it\" moment when you buy in. Maybe you read about Bitcoin, didn't understand it, and followed Warren Buffet's (typically good) advice not to invest in things you don't understand. Some of your friends made money but you still ignored it. Then you read about Ethereum, which you *really* didn't understand, also passed on buying, and later found out that your friends are planning to retire because they did. The lesson seems to be *anti-Buffet*: only invest in things you *don't understand*. This is causing people to check their judgment at the door when the latest all-time high finally convinces them to jump into the market.\n\nAnd that is not good.\n\nBecause there will be sellers to fill the demand, especially the demand coming from people who have decided they will never understand this stuff so will just place bets on things that *sound complex and impressive.*\n\nLet's think about these sellers. And by sellers, I don't mean people selling their holdings of existing crypto assets. I mean new issuers. Teams launching new crypto assets.\n\nThe basic model is to pre-sell some percentage of the crypto assets the proposed network will generate as a way to fund the development of the decentralized application before it launches. The project founders tend to hold on to some percentage of these assets. Which means that raising money for a project this way is a) non-dilutive as it is not equity and b) not debt, so you never have to pay anyone back. This is basically free money. It's never been this good for entrepreneurs, even in the 90s dot-com boom. Which makes it incredibly tempting to try and shoe-horn every project that *could perhaps* justify an \"initial coin offering\" to go for it, even if they aren't actually building a *decentralized* application. After all, an ICO lets you exit before you even launch.\n\nAnd there is a pervasive narrative out there that supports entrepreneurs looking to create new crypto assets. The idea is that by selling assets to users before your network launches, you create \"evangelists\" who will be early users and promoters you wouldn't otherwise have if there were no financial incentive to participate in your community.\n\nThe problem with this line of thinking is that it conflates early *investors* with early *users*. The overlap between people who buy your crypto asset and people who actually want to use the service you are building is likely very, very small, especially during market manias like this one. It creates a false sense of \"product-market fit.\" Yes, people are buying your crypto asset. But that's because the \"market\" are people who want to get rich and the \"product\" you are selling is a \"way to get rich.\"\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c381a715-69d6-4b9f-ae99-f7066c7b4150.jpeg?height=345&width=727)\n\nBut \"this is fine.\"\n\nEveryone's making money. For now.\n\nIt's currently rational to be irrational.\n\nAs long as that blue line keeps going up.\n\n> Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked.\n\n**At the same time, I wouldn't bet against crypto assets.**\n\n> He who lives by the crystal ball will eat shattered glass.\n\nConsider the following. The total market cap of crypto assets has been increasing by an *order of magnitude* every few years. Where will they be in 2022? It's certain that many (most?) of the crypto assets launching today won't make it. But neither did most of the ones that were launched back in the 2013/4 boom (when they were referred to as \"alt coins\"). Though an important alt coin from 2014 did stick around and drove the most recent boom to new heights by being the platform to power all the others: Ethereum.\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/97c6751e-3218-4407-a71f-e00e0fe3babe.jpeg?height=190&width=721)\n\n**So, Jamie, what's the bottom line?**\n\nAllow me to summarize.\n\n- Cryptocurrencies (which I prefer to call crypto assets) are a new asset class that enable decentralized applications\n\n- Decentralized applications enable services we already have today, like payments, storage, or computing, but without a central operator of those services\n\n- Today, this software model is useful to people who need censorship resistance which tend to be people that are either off the grid or who want to be off the grid\n\n- For now, most people are better off using normal applications because they are 10x better on every other dimension\n\n- Society's embrace or rejection of new technology is hard to predict (think about encrypted messaging)\n\n- In the long-run, the value of a crypto asset will rise and fall in proportion to the use of the decentralized applications it enables\n\n- In the short-run, there will be extreme volatility as FOMO competes with FUD, confusion competes with understanding, and greed competes with fear (on both the buyer side and the issuer side)\n\n- Most people buying into crypto assets have checked their judgement at the door\n\n- Many sellers of new crypto assets aren't actually building decentralized applications but are instead shoe-horning an ICO into their service because of the market mania; that doesn't mean decentralized applications are bad, it just means people are capitalizing on the confusion and are probably themselves confused\n\n- Don't bet against crypto assets in the long-run: as we approach the 10 year anniversary of the Bitcoin paper it is clear that they aren't going anywhere and that decentralized applications may very well find an important place alongside all the other forms of organization we have come to take for granted.\n\nBest,\nAdam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1614700875, "digest": "Q-HIDLBN0lRy1ezLFI-Qj5JhLzHWRUgXF4cqwieQWXQ", "contributor": "0x8a32Af4AfFD816978C2Fdfa7C08c27681d05d4Fe"}

I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn’t meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you’d think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend’s living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn’t just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it’s not just a technology. It’s a philosophy. It’s a belief system. It’s a way of viewing the world. It’s about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you’re batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood. I remember the “aha moment” when I wrote my first smart contract. With just a few lines of code and a private key, I was able to transfer an internet-native currency anywhere in the world in seconds. \n\nI didn’t have to sign up for Stripe. I didn’t have to use the Plaid API to connect a bank account. I didn’t have to check if TransferWise supported payments for a specific country. There was no centralized party. Just a peer-to-peer cryptonetwork called Ethereum. It was pretty damn mindblowing.\n\nAfter the first few weeks at Dharma, I was confident that DeFi and crypto were the future. But I also got the itch to work on some of my own ideas. I wanted to build software for creative people. Writers. Artists. Musicians. Online teachers. I strongly believe our world depends on these types of people having the tools they need to serve their communities as best they can.\n\nFrankly, I also thought it would take a couple years before the crypto industry had the infrastructure in place for a mainstream consumer app to be built.\n\n\nSo I ended up leaving Dharma to take some time off and explore a few startup ideas. But a couple months ago I read a [manifesto](https://cryptomedia.wtf/) by [Zora](https://zora.co/) that changed how I thought about crypto.\n\nIt described a world where crypto could be used to give any digital media file (eg an image, a song, an essay, digital art, etc.) property rights. It explained how cryptonetworks could turn digital media into liquid financial assets, secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts.\n\nAlthough the individual ideas weren’t new, they were combined and articulated in a way that just made sense. And not just to me.\n\n[Digital artists](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9), [athletes](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html), [social media influencers](https://cryptoslate.com/logan-paul-nfts-sell-3-5-million-worth-on-first-day-of-release/), [tech executives](https://scottbelsky.medium.com/the-furry-lisa-cryptoart-the-new-economy-of-digital-creativity-6cb2300ea081), [media executives](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI), and [journalists](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1366554892035219462) that never took the crypto weirdos seriously, seem to be taking notice.\n\nBut let’s be real. Is this latest NFT craze a bubble? Probz. Yet, is there at least a kernel of value in the idea of ownership over creative work? I think so.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell, there’s been a lot of talk about high transaction fees and lack of scalability in these systems. Although I do think these problems should and will get fixed, a lack of technical scalability is kinda the point.\n\nCryptonetworks trade off technical scalability for social scalability.\n\nFacebook is technically scalable because it’s a social network that processes millions of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is socially scalable because it’s a trillion dollar economic network without a centralized authority.\n\nCrypto isn’t just a technological revolution. It’s also a revolution in capital formation and human coordination. How creative projects are funded. How groups of people are incentivized. How organizations are structured.\n\nYears from now, when I’m old and senile, I believe we’ll look back at this period as an [Internet Renaissance](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1343210395704541189) of sorts. \n\nA time where we dared to fight back against systems that have been designed for centuries to elevate certain groups and keep others disenfranchised.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe all this crypto stuff really is just an intellectual ideal that’ll never work in practice. Regardless, I think it’s at least worth trying.", "timestamp": 1614707550, "digest": "pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}
