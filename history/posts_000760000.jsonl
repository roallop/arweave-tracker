He argued that the next wave of companies built in web3 will need to build on a new “mental model” of the Internet.\n\nJohn is right, and many aspects of web3 have already done so. The decentralized publishing platform [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz) (where this piece is hosted) puts power in the hands of writers. [Royal](https://royal.market/), which recently launched, lets fans buy ownership in their favorite artists. The distributed hard drive [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) offers a permanent repository for information. And [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) sorts through it all by allowing its community to query and curate its vast store of data.\n\nAcross all these verticals, web3 is rethinking the Internet. Many of these projects, using this new Internet logic, will become the building blocks for a new economy. But social tokens today still have yet to adopt the latest mental model. If the goal of web3 is to overturn the Internet status quo, then the structure of social tokens today is fundamentally flawed from the ground up. Tokenized communities are centered around what you *have* — often social or financial capital — while they should instead be centered around what you *do.*\n\n\n---\n\nToday, decentralized communities, or DAOs, are primarily valued proportionally to their token price. When the value of a token goes up, so does the value of its community. And when the token price is higher, the community naturally becomes more desirable to join. We saw this over the last few weeks as decentralized community [Friends with Benefits](https://www.fwb.help/) ([$FWB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/friends-with-benefits-pro/)) skyrocketed to nearly $200 a token.\n\n![$FWB token price over the last 3 months](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/af6aa3dc-76c2-460c-a232-6d2338640345.png?height=800&width=1860)\n\nThe problem here — in what I call the Social Token Paradox — is that with this mental model, tokenized communities are incentivized to uphold exclusivity. Let’s work backwards: if you want your community to be valuable, you need your community’s token to go up in price. This makes sense, sure. But to make the token go up in price, you have two choices: you can either **increase** the price of the token, or you can **decrease** the number of tokens available to prospective members. Either way, this restricts access to the community and promotes exclusivity, codifying and enforcing a level of scarcity that feels almost at odds with web3’s vision of a truly open Internet.\n\n[https://twitter.com/parisrouz/status/1432389714468802566?s=20](https://twitter.com/parisrouz/status/1432389714468802566?s=20)\n\nSo how do we solve the Social Token Paradox? As an ecosystem, we need to rethink the value of a token from the ground up. The decentralized communities of tomorrow will be centered around what we *do*, instead of what we *have*. This will be accomplished through both pre-existing on-chain data, as well as through a more robust DAO onboarding process that enables communities to better understand prospective members, their values, and their goals. This will come as a tectonic shift to decentralized organizations and communities over the next few months.\n\nOnce we solve the Social Token Paradox, capital will no longer be the primary status symbol in web3. Instead, status will be composed of how many communities you are a part of, or how many things you’ve done online. The more online history you have, the richer your own story is, and the more things you can be a part of in the future.\n\nIf we can democratize access to a [veblen good](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veblen-good.asp), status becomes about being a *part* *of* *something*, rather than how much money you have. We already see this in products like [Fractional](https://fractional.art/) and [PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/), which enable collective ownership of highly sought-after NFTs, as well as in products like [Rabbit Hole](https://rabbithole.gg/), which allow users to earn crypto by using the latest decentralized apps. In both cases, democratizing access to capital is the intermittent step to on-chain reputation. These are exciting proof points of changes to come. But we are only scratching the surface.\n\nIn the real world, when we look in the mirror, we can only see a small fraction of who we are. In the metaverse, we’ll be able to go a whole lot deeper. And it’s going to start with social tokens.\n\n\n---\n\nThank you to [Brian Flynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm) and [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa) for their continued support and friendship and for informing my thinking on this piece.", "timestamp": 1630416096, "digest": "zqchiBQhWWS49gaabLU92-BUUwfBL5aHCtNT88VTI8o", "contributor": "0x01b7baA7baA864fEF3CD1C7bc118Cc97cEdCB33f"}

Following our [community raise](https://syndicate.mirror.xyz/_dIadEYTjam8Z8DGq2ezTBsYuf-bfSRoKFhNYZYJFk8), our Series A is the next major step in bringing our revolutionary protocol and platform for investing to people and communities all around the world.**\n\nWithin the next decade, investing will be decentralized, democratized, and community-driven. Syndicate is building the infrastructure to enable this at scale—we’re developing decentralized investing and social networking protocols, advanced legal tech solutions, and a next-gen social networking platform that empowers communities to raise, coordinate, and invest capital like never before. This will have a profound impact by expanding what gets funded and built in the world—by whom, for whom, and where. It’ll level the playing field, empower communities of builders, creatives, influencers, and friends to invest in new ideas and world-changing technologies, and introduce radical new models for investing to society that are fundamentally more open, free, and fair.\n\nTo realize this important yet complex mission, we’re partnering with values-aligned leaders who represent a diverse array of industries and communities as part of our Series A, including firms like Andreessen Horowitz and its Cultural Leadership Fund, IDEO CoLab Ventures, Variant, Electric Capital, CoinFund, Scalar Capital, Bill Ackman’s Table Management, Weekend Fund, Coinbase Ventures, Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary’s Sound Ventures, Kevin Durant’s Thirty Five Ventures, Aave, Protocol Labs, A Capital, Acrylic, Delphi INFINFT, True Ventures, Makena, Atelier Ventures (creator economy focused venture firm), the Council Fund (all women venture firm), entrepreneurs like Ryan Hoover (Founder of Product Hunt), Alexis Ohanian (Co-Founder of Reddit), Biz Stone (Co-Founder of Twitter), Cordozar Broadus (Snoop Dogg), and investors like Matthew Ball, Packy McCormick, Lenny Rachitsky, Scott Belsky, Alice Lloyd George, and over 100 more people and firms who each bring important capabilities, expertise, and networks to the project.\n\nThe funds from the round will be used to accelerate the development of our decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) powered technologies, integration with Web3 projects and fintech startups, and support of communities with the advanced legal and operational tools they need to succeed and grow long term.

He argued that the next wave of companies built in web3 will need to build on a new “mental model” of the Internet.\n\nJohn is right, and many aspects of web3 have already done so. The decentralized publishing platform [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz) (where this piece is hosted) puts power in the hands of writers. [Royal](https://royal.market/), which recently launched, lets fans buy ownership in their favorite artists. The distributed hard drive [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) offers a permanent repository for information. And [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) sorts through it all by allowing its community to query and curate its vast store of data.\n\nAcross all these verticals, web3 is rethinking the Internet. Many of these projects, using this new Internet logic, will become the building blocks for a new economy. But social tokens today still have yet to adopt the latest mental model. If the goal of web3 is to overturn the Internet status quo, then the structure of social tokens today is fundamentally flawed from the ground up. Tokenized communities are centered around what you *have* — often social or financial capital — while they should instead be centered around what you *do.*\n\n\n---\n\nToday, decentralized communities, or DAOs, are primarily valued proportionally to their token price. When the value of a token goes up, so does the value of its community. And when the token price is higher, the community naturally becomes more desirable to join. We saw this over the last few weeks as decentralized community [Friends with Benefits](https://www.fwb.help/) ([$FWB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/friends-with-benefits-pro/)) skyrocketed to nearly $200 a token.\n\n![$FWB token price over the last 3 months](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/af6aa3dc-76c2-460c-a232-6d2338640345.png?height=800&width=1860)\n\nThe problem here — in what I call the Social Token Paradox — is that with this mental model, tokenized communities are incentivized to uphold exclusivity. Let’s work backwards: if you want your community to be valuable, you need your community’s token to go up in price. This makes sense, sure. But to make the token go up in price, you have two choices: you can either **increase** the price of the token, or you can **decrease** the number of tokens available to prospective members. Either way, this restricts access to the community and promotes exclusivity, codifying and enforcing a level of scarcity that feels almost at odds with web3’s vision of a truly open Internet.\n\n[https://twitter.com/parisrouz/status/1432389714468802566?s=20](https://twitter.com/parisrouz/status/1432389714468802566?s=20)\n\nSo how do we solve the Social Token Paradox? As an ecosystem, we need to rethink the value of a token from the ground up. The decentralized communities of tomorrow will be centered around what we *do*, instead of what we *have*. This will be accomplished through both pre-existing on-chain data, as well as through a more robust DAO onboarding process that enables communities to better understand prospective members, their values, and their goals. This will come as a tectonic shift to decentralized organizations and communities over the next few months.\n\nOnce we solve the Social Token Paradox, capital will no longer be the primary status symbol in web3. Instead, status will be composed of how many communities you are a part of, or how many things you’ve done online. The more online history you have, the richer your own story is, and the more things you can be a part of in the future.\n\nIf we can democratize access to a [veblen good](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veblen-good.asp), status becomes about being a *part* *of* *something*, rather than how much money you have. We already see this in products like [Fractional](https://fractional.art/) and [PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/), which enable collective ownership of highly sought-after NFTs, as well as in products like [RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg/), which allow users to earn crypto by using the latest decentralized apps. In both cases, democratizing access to capital is the intermittent step to on-chain reputation. These are exciting proof points of changes to come. But we are only scratching the surface.\n\nIn the real world, when we look in the mirror, we can only see a small fraction of who we are. In the metaverse, we’ll be able to go a whole lot deeper. And it’s going to start with social tokens.\n\n\n---\n\nThank you to [Brian Flynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm) and [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa) for their continued support and friendship and for informing my thinking on this piece.", "timestamp": 1630416860, "digest": "zqchiBQhWWS49gaabLU92-BUUwfBL5aHCtNT88VTI8o", "contributor": "0x01b7baA7baA864fEF3CD1C7bc118Cc97cEdCB33f"}

{"id": "vwvHnghhkxxgYdnc3z8uRAOdvUmsYdjQ6M9QynuZsPU", "title": "So Your Brand Just Bought Your First NFT, What Next?", "body": "### Brands are buying, just not buying-in … yet\n\nMost of us recently read about how [VISA spent almost $150,000 to buy CryptoPunk 7610](https://www.coindesk.com/visa-buys-cryptopunk-for-close-to-150k), a pixelated female with a mohawk, green eyeshadow and red lipstick. Their reasoning contains phrases such as:\n\n* “We need a firsthand understanding of the infrastructure requirements for a global brand to purchase, store, and leverage an NFT.”\n* “We wanted to collect an NFT that symbolizes the excitement and opportunity of this particular cultural moment,” \n\nWhat they didn’t mention was the CryptoPunk community itself, or how certain NFT collections are also badges and gateways to dynamic decentralized communities around the world—whose influence is growing stronger by the day. CryptoPunk holders alone count Jay-Z, Odell Beckham, Jr. and Steve Aoki among their ranks. \n\nAlmost as popular (and almost as expensive) are any one of the unique 10,000 variations of a digital primate group called The Bored Ape Yacht Club. While these apes adorn many social media profiles of their 5,300 or so owners, having a Bored Ape NFT also grants you access to a virtual club. As noted on the BAYC website, “Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits” which range from a digital graffiti board, to liquidity pools to the rights to build new projects on top of your particular ape’s image and traits. The project has gotten so much attention since it launched in April, that just last week Arizona Iced Tea announced it had bought one. I wonder how long it will be before we see an Ape flavored tea on store shelves across the country. \n\n### web3 > web2, and brands should buy-in\n\nThe construct to pay attention to here is that Crypto and NFTs are more than money and images—they are gateways to networks and ecosystems. The premise of web3 is to bring together communities, commerce, and culture under many decentralized roofs, while allowing participants to co-create together.\n\n[https://twitter.com/jarroddicker/status/1425535203397804039](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker/status/1425535203397804039)\n\nIt’s not just happening in the NFT space. Friends With Benefits and JUMP are just two of the many tokenized communities that have formed around the creative class—becoming vibrant digital societies of like minded creators, programmers, business thinkers and organizers using a new set of social tools to generate more value together. \n\nFriends With Benefits counts close to 7,000 members in its Discord group, with most of the channels and engagement gated until you are accepted through a membership committee and hold 75 $FWB tokens in a digital wallet. Once you are accepted and token verified you get access to conversation and connection across the world and from topics as varied as mental health and parenting to the metaverse and trading stonks. \n\nThis DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), [which in February ‘21 claimed](https://consensys.net/blog/codefi/friends-with-benefits-a-new-model-for-social-tokens-on-ethereum/) that only 400 members were holding enough $FWB for full access, has grown exponentially not only in membership but also in valuation as it $FWB the token has increased in the last 3 months from hovering around $4.50 each to $161 at the time of this writing. The community has also recently announced potential investment from well regarded VCs such as a16z and Kindred Ventures. \n\nSimilarly, JUMP is a growing collective of marketing, advertising, and creative professionals united in looking at web3 protocols as the gateway to future experiences all collected (and gated) behind the group’s $JUMP token—which at present is being gifted to participants as a social token for value created within the community by contributing to one-of-three teams: Newsfeed, Research, and Events. \\n  \\n The above are just a small number of extremely active and influential communities utilizing blockchain dynamics and web3 protocols to create collective opportunity. SeedClub, Forefront, ArtBlocks, 0n1Force, ApeDao, Animetas, and more are active projects with access based on token or NFT ownership which represent diverse audiences from all over the world, all walks of life, and many of whom are stacked with innovative, communicative creative people with often large online presences. \n\n### Brands need to engage deeper\n\nAs a marketer by trade I started to wonder which large brand will be the first to create experiences and opportunities purely for web3 communities. \n\nIt is one thing to buy an NFT or a .ETH address as [Budweiser recently did](https://www.coindesk.com/budweiser-nft-beer-ether-domain-name-server). The true unlock is to access the value associated with these early adopters and platform forward social citizens; it feels natural that brands, publishers, and festivals would engage them from an influence and partnership perspective. For years, brands have bought into creator and influencer culture and those models work. They need to recognize that web3 communities can be even more valuable, as not only are they influential and hyper-communicative, but they also have powerful incentive structures and can get a cohort behind something that benefits the community as a whole. \n\nThe key insight is that Arizona Iced Tea and Visa’s NFT purchase is just the cost of admittance—the real magic lies in the engagement and experience. \n\n### Looking ahead, some closing ideas\n\nIt may not yet be clear on how to activate with these communities—like anyone else it is about authentic access and opportunities to participate. Let me jump start the brainstorm for you:\n\n* Will Pepsi offer a suite of luxury boxes at next year’s Super Bowl for holders of CryptoPunks?\n* Will Coachella build a wallet enabled-entry to the Bored Ape Yacht Club satellite clubhouse with exclusive performances and meet and greets?\n* How about Coinbase hosting a custom speaker series for members of SeedClub?\n* Will Fortnite hold an exclusive e-gaming tournament for 0n1force owners?\n* Will Visa create an exclusive art preview at Art Basel for those who have ArtBlocks?\n* Where is the SXSW x FWB diner and will Franklin’s provide the BBQ?\n* When does TikTok create exclusive filters and audio unlockable for members of the RLY Dao?\n* Can Uniqlo do a licensing deal with holders of Pudgy Penguins for a new NFT-backed line of shirts?\n* How about Seth Rogen’s weed company HousePlant gifting a member discounts, and an exclusive Discord AMA between Seth and Ashton Kutcher | Mila Kunis to anyone who owns a Stoner Cat?\n* When does NIKE create the Axie Infinity Run Club to get those gamers some exercise IRL?\n* Will SpaceX create customizable vehicles for planetary travel in Axie Infinity or Alien Worlds?\n* When does Spotify create the music festival where the entire line-up is chosen by the RLY DAO?\n\nAs you can see these are just quick samples of ways in which brands could get involved. Quite similar to how brands have been courting groups of influencers over the years to create relationships and collective opportunity, it is only a matter of time before brands start seeing the true NFT/Token community ecosystem as a sea of influence waiting to be authentically engaged with. Who will be the first? This is the future of creator marketing. \n\nOne final note to consider for Brands. This industry is generating a tremendous amount of wealth at the moment.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ape6743/status/1431753960080220167](https://twitter.com/ape6743/status/1431753960080220167)\n\nThe fake internet money could go up, down or plunge to zero, but with new found bags comes a new class of consumer ready to buy products from common to luxury. Understanding their mindset by spending time with them and where they are, will help create opportunities to engage with them. \n\nIt isn’t going unnoticed that Louis Vuitton and Gucci are both in the NFT space, so your future luxury consumer may be deep in the VeeFriends community and looking for her next weekend car. \n\n## Also #DYOR #NFA, etc.\n\nTo close, I will reference this quote from RealVision’s Raoul Pal regarding tokenized collectives: \n\n“*It's the biggest thing I've ever seen, we all know how big crypto is, but within crypto, community tokens are going to change all business models.*”\n\n[https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1430241316554698752](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1430241316554698752)\n\n**Author credits**\n\nThis essay was written by [Sam Ewen](https://twitter.com/SamEwen), \n\nThank you to [Jonathan Goodwin](https://twitter.com/imtalljonathan), [Brennen Schlueter](https://twitter.com/brennenschlu), and [Jeff Kauffman, Jr.](https://twitter.com/jeffkauffmanjr) for reviewing the essay’s draft and contributing additional insights.\n\n**About JUMP**\n\nJUMP is the first tokenized community for marketing and advertising professionals.\n\nJoin us at [JoinJump.Community](https://www.joinjump.community/) and follow [@jumperstweeting](https://twitter.com/jumperstweeting).\n\n**Additional reading**\n\n[NFT brand strategy: Visa and Arizona Iced Tea ape into web3](https://jump.mirror.xyz/ATrIlwxvkXwdo2R18kZIgYwspbURdyzjf1y-a9F99Jk) by [@chadhugghins](https://twitter.com/ChadHugghins)\n\n[Nifty Corporates](https://www.notboring.co/p/nifty-corporates) by [@packy](https://twitter.com/packyM)\n\n \\n ", "timestamp": 1630418283, "digest": "CPRivsU8T32ZSVvQd_ih8RPBKETGWxvvkazGvx9BmkI", "contributor": "0xC143c4E2f95B7B49aF49501323093efFeDa42e41"}

Enjoy and please share your feedback directly with me, on Twitter, or in the comments!\n\n[This piece was published first on substack, sign up for my newsletter there to get this straight in your inbox](https://nystrom.substack.com/p/the-unsyndicated-brief-1-streetwear).\n\n### 1. The Hundreds: Fashion for The Real-World & The Metaverse\n\n**From The Hundreds to The Thousands**: The Hundreds – which is I’ve now realized a west coast brand that my east-coast-born-and-raised fiancé has never heard of – is entering the NFT world. The California culture – skater, surfer, lifestyle – brand released the [Adam Bomb Squad](https://abs.thehundreds.com/#collect) (ABS), a set of 25,000 unique avatar NFTs that sold out this past Friday in 40 minutes.\n\n![Iconic Adam Bomb](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ec73d71b-0856-48fc-8822-f9b1489b2a7a.png?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Streetwear with perks**: Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the ABS (Atom Bomb Squad) NFT design is that these NFTs come with various perks including:\n\n* An exclusive Adam Bomb Squad T-shirt per NFT\n* Early access to The Hundreds drops\n* ABS exclusive drops\n* ABS exclusive events (physical and metaversal)\n* “Fast-lane” privileges at warehouse sales (whatever that means, I’m not fashionable) \n\nUnlike other NFTs without utility, The Hundreds has created NFTs that provide early access and exclusivity perks that will bring value to their owners.\n\n**People over product**: The Hundreds even announced plans to add “social token functionality” in the future, however, it’s unsure what that will entail. Additionally, The Hundreds claims it will provide NFT owners the ability to earn off The Hundreds clothing that features the ABS NFTs which would be a gamechanger. While the specifics weren’t released, this is the type of 10x improvement in consumer experience that the fashion world desperately needs. \n\n#### The Takeaway\n\n**The next level of brand ambassadors**: Dozens of companies will notice companies like The Hundreds make millions off of their NFT sales and find ways to reinvigorate their communities. Most importantly, aligning culture with financial incentives – earning money based on NFTs – will create a whole new culture of Streetwear and take the concept of brand ambassadors to the next level.  \n\n[Share Unsyndicated by Mason Nystrom](https://nystrom.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share)\n\n### 2. Apple’s Monopoly Takes A Small Step Backward For Mankind\n\n**Cutting the Apple**: In a recent class-action settlement, Apple [announced](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-will-change-its-app-store-practices-in-legal-settlement-11630024742) that the tech giant will be changing a few of its App Store policies, specifically those around how developers are able to monetize. \n\n**RIP your inbox**: Now, developers are legally allowed to monetize off of Apple’s app store by emailing their customers directly and directing individuals to pay elsewhere (e.g. Not in the App Store). This means that applications will be able to undercut Apple’s fee and also means you’ll be getting a plethora of emails from all your most-used iOS apps.\n\n**What did we win?**: A few other benefits came from the settlement including:\n\n* Apple agreed to keep a lower commission (15%) for companies making under $1 million over three years. \n* Apple will try and aid new apps in the App Store to get discovered by changing the search algorithm.\n* Developers can now set the price for their apps($4.20) rather than near-whole dollar amounts ($3.99). \n\n#### The Takeaway\n\n**Convenience still wins**: Even if developers are able to monetize on other platforms and sidestep Apple, developers will ultimately still lose a portion of sales to individuals who prefer convenience or don’t want to take the added step of going to another site to make a purchase. \n\n**An Epic moment in the making**: The recent settlement was for developers making less than $1 million. The real [showdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiSHuaw6Q4) between [Epic Games and Apple’s App Store](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/apple-ceo-tim-cook-testifies-in-epic-games-trial.html) will come from their suit which is set to be determined later this year. The official decision – positive or negative – will undoubtedly be a landmark case in the future of the App Store and Apple’s monopolistic practices. \n\n## Curated Content: What I’m Reading\n\n* Why Facebook [won’t build an open and interoperable](https://www.profgalloway.com/metaverse/) metaverse. \n* A feel-good (make you feel dumb) story [about a 12-year-old kid](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/12-year-old-coder-made-6-figures-selling-weird-whales-nfts.html) who created weird whales and made $400k.\n* The [Metaverse Index 101](https://metaportal.substack.com/p/the-metaverse-index-101) by Metaportal.\n* Great thread by Darren Lau on [angel investing](https://twitter.com/Darrenlautf/status/1431648212016779268?s=20) vs joining a fund. \n* [The Street Doesn’t Really Exist](https://abs.thehundreds.com/white-paper) by Bobby Hundreds.\n\nSpecial thanks to my brother [Gunnar Nystrom](https://twitter.com/gunnar_nystrom) for his feedback and edits!", "timestamp": 1630420576, "digest": "oGnemYTd58gVFnW2-I6WH-Yd7YnMfUfkfRsOZNgRRgc", "contributor": "0x621b35b50c508f3497437Ae777dEe70D052D6AD9"}

We are beyond excited to have you on board as we set out to begin a journey that will echo in eternity. Here is how to get started and become an Internet culture pioneer.\n\n* As a first step, make sure you’ve loaded up on some ETH in your crypto wallet, you’ll need it to complete the whole process. Don’t have a wallet? [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) are great options.\n* Head over to the [SushiSwap App](https://app.sushi.com/swap), connect your wallet (Top Right), and swap your ETH (*Swap From*) into Wrapped ETH (*Swap To*). This is simply wrapping your ETH so it will work with the Miso auction.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9a8c5fc3-927b-48d2-a41b-672cf5478af6.png?height=780&width=1212)\n\n* The $DOG auction will take place on [Miso](https://miso.sushi.com/auctions/0x5e29C9Bf97c45e55f1c2257D0Ecf6909726745f3). Again, make sure your wallet is connected and then head over to *Marketplace* > *Live Sales* from the left-hand side menu. You should be seeing the $DOG sale.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a387159f-a7ea-43ca-87a4-6193ca364195.png?height=1800&width=2880)\n\n* Use the slider on the right-hand side to choose how much ETH you want to spend on $DOG tokens and adjust accordingly. You will get $DOG proportional to the total amount of ETH committed.\n* Approve the transaction by clicking on ‘Commit ETH’ and completing the steps on your MetaMask wallet.\n* Once the auction ends, come back to the same page to claim your tokens to your MetaMask wallet. Everyone gets $DOG at the same price. \n* Woof, congratulations! You now own a piece of history and the internet’s best friend, guaranteed to make you the center of attention at every party you attend for the rest of your life. Tread lightly. And take care of Doge.\n\n\n---\n\nAlright folks, that’s enough alpha right there.

{"id": "tiXyVtToQTP7fu8uV8Wp8kFscxWd-MiqNP8sU6S3k7Q", "title": "The Doge NFT: Own a piece of Internet history", "body": "Yes, this is Doge. The *iconic* Doge. WOOF!\n\nWhat started off as ‘just’ an internet meme has worked its way into becoming a cultural phenomenon and a perennial piece of art. Doge, centered around a Shiba Inu dog with suboptimal grammar, has undoubtedly become the most loved meme of the decade. Whilst weaving its way into our hearts, this special canine has also paved the way for the viral memes that came after it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64801586-0ab9-4e5b-b02a-25467bfdc367.png?height=480&width=640)\n\nIn June 2021, Atsuko Sato, the owner of the famous Shiba Inu (who goes by Kabosu), [minted the original photo as an NFT](https://zora.co/0x337071a7e907f5a599747a2c9baf6efdf7eb4bcc/3366). The NFT is the rare 1/1 original piece that pays tribute to the whole Doge movement and related internet phenomena. It was sold for a record-breaking price of 1696 ETH ($5.5 million) to PleasrDAO, an experimental art collective.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9298ef46-6f53-4aa8-8693-c68467776fb8.png?height=1218&width=1840)\n\n**Oke, so wat?**\n\nToday, PleasrDAO is announcing that the NFT has been fractionalized into billions of pieces to be shared with the broader internet community. Using [fractional.art](https://fractional.art/vaults/0xbaac2b4491727d78d2b78815144570b9f2fe8899), the original Doge NFT has been divided into billions of $DOG ERC-20 tokens, allowing everyone and everything, including also cats, to own a piece of history.\n\n**How it werk? 🤔**\n\nThe initial auction of $DOG fractions will take place on September 1st, at 1pm EST and it will be the first opportunity for people to own this piece of art. Thereafter, it will be available to exchange on [fractional.art](https://fractional.art) or through decentralized exchanges such as [sushi.com](https://sushi.com) or [uniswap.org](https://uniswap.org).\n\nTalking numbers, there will initially be 20% of total $DOG supply available in the auction. That is 3,393,939,393 $DOG of the total supply of 16,969,696,969. An additional 25% of $DOG tokens have been allocated to $DOG community programs and continued development.\n\nOur goal at PleasrDAO is to be good stewards of this meaningful piece to help her reach her full potential. We have plans for a $DOG dev fund for projects aimed at supporting the long term community, and we will be the primary provider of liquidity on exchanges. PleasrDAO has discussed many mechanisms for getting all $DOG into the hands of the community without resulting in downward price pressure. We will ensure The Doge NFT does not go up for auction until we feel $DOG has reached full meme escape velocity and is coupled with a strong, thriving community.\n\nFor now, it’s very much as if the Louvre decided to fractionalize the Mona Lisa and distribute a portion of it for the public to own. However, unlike at the Louvre, collective ownership of art is really only possible using crypto art. In this digital-first world, NFTs can capture significant moments, phenomena and concepts while a smart contract can fractionalize and distribute them to the public.

It uses a hashing function applied to the concatenation of the token's ID and the type of the item (e.g. \"CHEST\"), and converts this to an integer (`uint256` in Solidity). Each type of item has an array of options, and this integer is used to pluck a random item from those arrays.\n\nOnce an item is found, a new random integer is produced, bounded between 0 and 21, by taking the modulus of the random number and 21. If the new number is greater than 14 (about 42% chance), then the item gets a special suffix. If it is greater or equal to 19 (about a 8.7% chance), then it gets a prefix. This creates special scarcity properties for each of the items!\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nSome of the top creators in our industry have started creating interoperable games using Loot as a foundation. This is likely the start of a phenomenon in the NFT space.\n\nIt would be preferable to prevent sybil attacks when claiming - by only allowing one person to claim one token - since the distribution of ownership is certain to be extremely weighted towards a few technical or ETH-wealthy individuals. \n\nThis project has created life-changing wealth for many people who simply took the time to submit a simple Ethereum transaction.

Their joint mission - to bend your mind through moving paintings that blur the lines between reality and imagination. Their debut work on Glass, “Echo of the Maddened Marionette“ will be put up for auction on **Wednesday, September 1 at 4 PM EST**.\n\n***Strung up by the invisible strings of deadly perfectionism, our marionette is left stuck in a broken timeline. “Echo Of The Maddened Marionette” delves into the psyche of a crazed ballerina, unveiling what lurks beneath her poised and elegant facade. The marionette constantly battles between her ideal self and the toll it takes to get there. This piece erases the borders between the opposing dimensions of her mind state.***\n\n![Echo of the Maddened Marionette](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d24de284-d4b7-4189-b28d-31a960464680.jpg?height=1365&width=2048)\n\n## Maya’s Story\n\n> *I want to make NFT art fit for the Louvre.*\n\nLondon born, Maya Peters is a young, up and coming, Irish-Indonesian filmmaker. Focused on blurring the lines between reality and imagination, she is an avid enthusiast of the visually spectacular.\n\n![Maya Peters](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/da15e399-cf3c-4b47-ab39-20f6cf307be8.jpg?height=2048&width=1365)\n\n### The Come Up\n\nGrowing up alone as an only child with a single dad, Maya was left to play with her imagination. She spent most of her time creating and developing her own make-believe worlds in order to fill the empty space and distract her from familial absence.\n\nLiving at home wasn't easy. With her father unemployed and incapacitated, she picked up odd jobs like comic book making, waitressing, commercial and film acting to put food on the table. Never a day without hard work, being a multitasker and committing to versatility was and still is a key to her survival.\n\nUsing her skills and grit to push her artistic career further she’s worked with Academy Award-winning director Anders Walter and AcademyFilms directors Si & Ad and is on the board of judges for HER International Film Festival and Chroma International Film Festival. In order to connect with her local community, she has also appeared in The Irish Independent and RTÉ for her acting and modeling work.\n\n### No Regrets\n\n![No Regrets](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f5fac205-6070-471e-8431-8383fdc7ddd9.jpg?height=2048&width=1395)\n\n> *\"Look, I've never had a dream in my life*\n>\n> *Because a dream is what you wanna do, but still haven't pursued*\n>\n> *I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done*\n>\n> *So I've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!\"*\n>\n> \\- “No Regrets” by Aesop Rock\n\nDespite the hustle, she knew she had to reach further and learnt to support herself through her art internationally. She received a scholarship to study in UWC Changhsu, China at age 17 and promptly moved to China. There she began to polish her craft free from home and financial burden.\n\nChina brought forth new memories, new opportunities and new eyes. Using her background knowledge in acting and photography, she began directing her own films with kids from all around the world. Her first film ‘Wo Ai Ni Mama’, about a young Chinese girl exploring her sexuality, based on her own experiences in embracing her bisexuality, went on to receive awards across the globe and received [commercial distribution](https://www.filmin.pt/curta/wo-ai-ni-mama-i-love-you-mama) in China and Portugal.\n\nIt has also been praised by well-known film critic, João Lopez, in Portuguese newspaper [Diário de Notícias](https://www.dn.pt/edicao-do-dia/17-out-2020/da-china-com-amor-12929557.html) and got her two scholarships to New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts to study film.\n\n### Bridging Two Worlds\n\n> *Consider an estuary for a long moment. Imagine the rush of moving water pushing against the glittering banks of the Ural River. Following its snaking bends, as it struggles along the rocky terrain of sweet European mountains before gently depositing into warmer, damper and greener Asian marshes. Just as this complex torrent bridges two worlds, I live as the estuary where white blood meets brown.*\n\nAs a mixed kid, and a girl of seemingly many in-betweens, totality has never been the forefront of anything Maya stands for. In China, she started not only observing her own culture, but how the culture of others was woven into the fabric of their lives.\n\n> *Being an “in-between” makes me used to wriggling, fighting and confronting the idea of totality from the people that have tried to box me in at all sides.*\n\nHer fascination for culture also weaves itself into her art. Tracing back to her complex multicultural roots, her work aims to explore and shine a light on moments of tension. Between realities. Between identities. Between perspectives. Through her art, she wants the viewer to accept multifaceted truths of life.\n\n![In Between](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/926faabc-c34f-446c-ae7c-6a3bcf222dd6.jpg?height=1366&width=2048)\n\n## Hita’s Story\n\n> *I want to challenge the NFT art world with enticing experimental story-telling visuals that explore the human psyche inside and out.*\n\nBoston born, Anahita von Andrian-Werburg is a promising young German-Iranian filmmaker. Focused on influencing perceptions to bring awareness through her punchy multimedia photography & videography work, she hopes to bridge the gap between reality and imagination with her fluid approach to story-telling.\n\n![Anahita von Andrian](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/54f339ed-6cf8-49bc-951d-ad3c6769dc5b.JPG?height=1038&width=828)\n\n### The Come Up\n\nAnahita was raised in Boston, Massachusetts. As a multi-ethnic and third-culture child, with family spread out across much of the globe, she was fortunate to see much of the world at a young age. Language and culture fascinated her wherever she adventured. She is quadrilingual in German, Farsi, English, and French, and aspires to channel her experiences into the vital storytelling required to preserve the complexities and tensions within and between different cultures and perspectives.\n\nShe attended a British international School throughout her tween years, until she was accepted into a rigorously academic preparatory all-girls high-school in Boston. At age 16, she left home and moved abroad to live with her 80-year-old grandmother, an avid paintress, in Munich, where she attended a local German public school. From the colorful bustling bazaars of Shiraz, to the steady flow of Munich’s Isar river paradise, Anahita matured her appreciation for color, sound, and movement; elements now omnipresent in her visual work.\n\n### Venture into Film\n\nAnahita’s diverse mosaic of experiences and images left her yearning for a method of preservation and appreciation. She turned to writing, photography, and videography as her chosen method of documentation.\n\n![Omnipresent Visuals](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e26702e6-c371-4f46-8cb8-babda8767bed.JPG?height=5168&width=2912)\n\nDespite the lack of opportunity for any formal education in filmmaking, she was not deterred. In-between participating in competitive sports and rigorous academics, she spent the bulk of her free time researching filmmaking, and shooting as much content as possible. Her hard work paid off. At the age of 15, she launched her freelance videography and photography business and has since worked with an international selection of brands, companies, organizations, and individuals.\n\n### Documenting Realites\n\nAnahita was selected as one of three finalists out of an international pool of over 800+ female applicants to join the Beautiful Destinations Creative Agency in NYC as a *Capture Your Creativity* Campaign creator. She would later go on to direct, co-film, produce, and edit, *The Urban Wave,* a short Beautiful Destinations film centered around Munich’s urban surf culture and how it ties into Munich as a travel destination.\n\nShe expanded her love for music through her work with Live Nation Entertainment, where she shot, edited, and produced content on behalf of Live Nation Boston venues for musical artists such as Mason Ramsey and the Beach Fossils.\n\n![Climate Champion](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/31ead718-4ed2-4c6a-b842-f49818d7345b.JPG?height=1080&width=864)\n\nHer activism continued in her videography work for youth Climate Activism groups in Munich, where she spearheaded the media sector for the Friday’s For Future Student-Lead Climate Justice protests and in Boston, where she was a creative lead for the Boston Youth Climate Strike, and the national motion graphics co-director for the US Youth Climate Strike.\n\nShe is currently spearheading a profile film series for Voice In Sport, the first independent community-based platform for young female athletes, as an intern on their creative team.\n\nHer multidisciplinary approach to photography, with pieces primarily concerned with mental health, won her multiple Scholastic Arts awards, honors in curated galleries, and selection for VSCO Select’s contemporary publications.\n\n## Journey to the Metaverse\n\nAnahita (director) and Maya (creative art director) most recently collaborated on the creative ad campaign for MUZE Music Inc, an up-and-coming live music performance booking platform on Zoom. Just as the platform merges the physical and digital world for performers, their campaign did the same. Mind bending lighting, out-of-the box subject styling with UV makeup, and elaborate transitions made the campaign unique.\n\nBoth Maya and Anahita are currently second-year students at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. Studying and living in New York doesn’t come without a heavy price tag. Without concrete financial support, they are forced to create work with certain limitations.\n\nNFT’s not only give the duo a fighting chance to fuel their creative minds, but also are a gateway to helping them break down the barriers between physical and digital art, ultimately bridging two worlds and becoming major players in the new economy for digital art.\n\n![The Dynamic Duo](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2e2258c7-a90b-4f85-b4c0-9b5521438235.jpg?height=800&width=1600)\n\nMaya and Anahita are here to grind and aim to continue making work that shatters the boundaries of what is imaginable and unexpected. They wants to give their audiences a complete mind-fuck sensory experience, challenging and contradicting a viewers comfortability with their existence, leaving them restless and wanting more.\n\nOn the horizon, Maya is working on a piece that explores how corporal movement can contribute to experimental narratives in a childhood mindscape. She sees herself becoming an artist who uses unusual forms of expression in her films to disrupt the rules of commercial narratives.\n\nAnahita has plans to develop her affinity for aesthetics and awareness-centered storytelling as an aspiring screenwriter, cinematographer, and director. She is currently pioneering a series of short pieces to show the stories behind the successes of some of US’s top female athletes.\n\n**Essentially, they are a dream team.**\n\nSo watch out. Together, they’re gonna play with your mind, play with your emotions and make you question what's real, forever preserved in the blockchain.

I was at a state where I was torn between my current job, and what I want to be doing.\n\n\n---\n\n### Quick Throwback to 2019\n\nI think the last time I felt like this was back in Q2 of 2019. I was in college, I had a regular freelance gig, and I ran a small sticker business (my proudest endeavor at the time).\n\nI noticed that every time a friend of mine asks me how was I, I would say \"Eto, pagod (Here I am, tired.)\" I thought that something was wrong because I'd answered that way to many people already, and I compared my answers to the other people in the room. Their answers felt normal. Working, studying, doing regular stuff. They weren't like me, who was tired.\n\nFast forward to a few months later, I unofficially dropped out of college (I just took a Leave of Absence... one that I am still in, two years later.)\n\nSince I left college, I made the layout for two magazines for that one regular freelance gig, worked in a boutique integrated marketing agency, made my own event organizing group, organized three events, and took (what I think is) a well-deserved 6-month break before going back to work, but for multinational advertising agencies.\n\n*Lowkey \"thanks pandemic\" because I feel like I wouldn't have stopped myself from the grind if it weren't for the lockdowns and all.*\n\n### Now, back to 2021\n\nIn 2019 it was college + freelance work + sticker business. Now, it's work + Web3 + urge to learn.\n\nI'm currently working at a multinational advertising agency, doing work for various known brands. I can't say anything negative about the past two months I've been with them. The work's interesting, the people are great, the pay is good, and this isn't me kissing ass or whatever.\n\nFor Web3, I've been going deep around the rabbit holes (more like anthill if you ask me) of NFTs, cryptocurrencies, decentralized platforms, how organizations work, and more. I think I can officially say that I work for a social token insight aggregator called [Forefront](https://forefront.market/), so it's kinda my job now to get even more involved in the space.\n\nOn top of those two things, I also feel like I don't know much about my craft for me to even generate more high-quality outputs. Sure, I can learn more from work experience, but I want to learn from reading and practice, not because I have to produce something in a fast-paced world. I miss learning with the freedom to make mistakes (what I think is the most important part of learning).\n\nI even want to produce my own self-taught graphic design curriculum, something I would publish here on Mirror if ever I get to do it.\n\n### What I'm thinking right now\n\nThere's so many great things happening in the world of Web3, and I want to be able to help out in any way I can.\n\n**Pay is already WAY higher than my current monthly salary, for WAY less work.** Because crypto is global, I don't have to be stuck with the low value of compensation in my country.\n\nAs a person living in a third-world country, that means being able to pay the bills and have food on my family's plates for a longer amount of time, WHILE having more time I can use to invest on myself.\n\n**Good example:** The NFT Edition below, if sold out, is already more than 1/3 of my current salary. I just made a PNG file and wrote this post, and I CAN get that money if 25 people do purchase it.\n\n*BTW, this is not me telling you to get it, LMAO. Just buy the NFT if you want it.*\n\nWhat's keeping me torn between staying in the advertising industry and leaving it for Web3 is that I won't have anything to put on whatever documents I may need when applying for a visa if I want to migrate somewhere else.\n\nCrypto isn't even regulated here, so I don't know how I am going to be able to leave this country and have a better life.\n\nI'm turning 23 near the end of the year, but these are things that I already have in mind as the first-born out of two kids. How do I migrate to another country? What if I get a condo instead so I have my own place? Can I save enough money before my mom gets hospitalized for old age?\n\nI just feel like nothing is possible just because I'm stuck in this country ruled by greedy pieces of shit.\n\nHaving to work in a full-time job and explore Web3 has been tiring as fuck, especially with the things going on in my head. I think it's time to cut one, and I think you know which one is on the chopping block. But that doesn't solve my problem of being able to leave this country.\n\nTo end on a lighter note, I am optimistic that I am still in a very early stage of my life. I want to be able to make decisions that can help me not spend the rest of my life beyond 40 just doing work in your typical 9-to-5.\n\n\n---\n\n### An update since writing this post\n\nSince writing the first draft, I got a signal boost from [Denis](https://twitter.com/Iiterature) of Mirror [for my recent post](https://gianferrer.mirror.xyz/12YcfiY7I_bfWQ4YVl5dDh2HNS5o7fW2zPW646pzHNU), giving me an unexpected amount of support (the financial kind being a plus).

I'm a 22-year-old graphic designer and creative entrepreneur from the Philippines. That's in South East Asia, like Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia.\nHere's what I've been up to with my life.\n\n\n---\n\n### School\n\nI took up Organizational Communication in college, which is like a mix of public relations, branding, and knowing how organizations work. I don't even know if I'm giving justice to my course with this definition, LMAO. IT'S BEEN A WHILE.\n\nI stopped a year before I was supposed to do my thesis. I thought that a diploma wasn't worth it anymore, and am still questioning the value of a diploma. What does it mean that a person has a diploma, even from one of the Top 4 universities in the country, especially for a creative? I care more about branding and visual identities (we're talking beyond logos), and for those disciplines, the only way I was going to be good at it is through practice. Don't get me wrong, I value education and loved my major subjects. I found them super interesting even though they were hard. But I don't understand why the educational system is what it is. (add more on that or delete)\n\nI have been on a Leave of Absence since mid-2019, and have no intention of returning, even though I have earned enough money to sustain myself AND pay for my education.\n\nUnofficial College Dropout. Do I aspire to be the next Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates? Fuck no! I'll be the only Gian Ferrer!\n\n### Creative Businesses\n\nWhile in college (I was 19 this time), I made my first brand called estitiks, which makes fun of what's *#aesthetic*. I usually sell stickers, taking note of graphic design trends like gradients and duotones and mixing them up with crass or witty statements. It's me thinking \"Will people buy this even if the statement is so stupid or mean, because it's pretty?\"\n\nBefore the pandemic, I joined over 40 events (everything from small indie gigs, art conventions, to music festivals), about 10 stores (some even inside malls), and a handful of pop-ups, selling my stuff.\n\n![My small area in a pop-up store inside a known mall. I have my stickers and my \"baket\" Hat (\"Bakit\" is \"Why\" in Filipino). Made 5-figures in sales because it was the holiday season.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/02ff9198-a216-4f87-8237-554cb534c544.jpeg?height=731&width=1440)\n\nThese days I spend a lot of time asking myself whether I've outgrown this type of branding and whether I should move on. It's been a few years since I started doing this, and I feel like I've matured... at least a little. IDK...\n\nDuring my time building estitiks, I also organized a few events, usually small gatherings for creatives. This led to me making another brand, HOHOL Events.\n\n![The crowd during my first big event, \"Powerpoint Party\". Imagine if you went to a TEDx Talk where the speaker must take shots or chug a bottle of beer BEFORE giving their talk on some insanely random topic.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b1937cd2-db5c-4266-a5c5-19b0de6a601c.jpg?height=812&width=1600)\n\nWe launched in late 2019, so we haven’t been able to do a lot of stuff yet. But during our short run we had over 200 attendees at our three events.\n\n### Freelancing\n\nDuring my last months in school, I started freelancing! This is while I had the sticker business as well. My first freelance gig was in publishing, where I created the featured images for the magazine’s blog posts and other social media content. At the same company, I did the layout for two magazines that were distributed to about 10,000 people at two of their events. I left after 6 months to work at a boutique integrated marketing agency where I wrote social media posts for a small fast food chain. During this time, I was still working on the sticker business, AND ALSO running my small event organizing group. I left the agency in December 2019.\n\nThinking about it now, I feel like I prefer being my own boss AND client, rather than being a part of a bureaucratic or hierarchical organization.\n\nThe first few months of 2020, I thought that I deserved a break from continuously going to school, then work, while making two small businesses. That break went too long because of the pandemic. But maybe I needed it. I got back to work last October 2020 and have been working for multinational advertising agencies since.\n\n### The Road Less Traveled\n\nA recurring theme in my life is that I choose the road less traveled. From unofficially dropping out of school — giving me less of a chance of getting a high-paying job locally —, building my own brands from scratch instead of being a part of one, to even getting myself into this wild world of Web3 / Crypto where outsiders just talk shit and not even try to understand it by getting their feet wet.\n\nIt's always been a lonely road, even if I meet partners or new friends that are there to support me. I just feel like nobody understands me fully, being an LGBT+ graphic designer from the Philippines, who's just trying to sustain myself, create stuff, and help others along the way. Writing this paragraph just made me realize that there's more to me, even though I don't feel it (yet?) Maybe I'm asking too much from people. IDK.\n\n![I saw this GIF and got me a little bit emotional because this is a great visual of what I feel. Anyway, stream \"Dark\" on Netflix. That show is g o o d  s h i t .](https://media1.tenor.com/images/1b398a6be179c96c990564e8e260413c/tenor.gif?height=800&width=1580)\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have various friend groups that I all love, but I feel like I haven't found my tribe yet. Will I find them in the world of Web3? I don't know. But anyways...\n\nHello, people of Web3! I'm Gian, and it's nice to meet you!\n\n\n---\n\n*If you like what you just read, feel free to collect this post as an NFT!

And in the monetary side of things, **Mirror won’t take money out of any of your posts** even with the financial features mentioned above.\n\nThis is better than Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Medium, Substack, etc. who takes majority of ad revenues — leaving $0.01 or less to the people —, or a huge chunk of the money from your subscriptions.\n\n### What have people made with the features?\n\nCheck this link for a sneak peek!\n\n[https://gianferrer.mirror.xyz/3T-7InT64Tkpd6la5Xxa-ezU-JYmnAXVve_q9iKz4FU](https://gianferrer.mirror.xyz/3T-7InT64Tkpd6la5Xxa-ezU-JYmnAXVve_q9iKz4FU)\n\n### Cool! I’m interested! How can we get in?\n\nTo get in Mirror, one must go through the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) where people vote for you if they want to see your works, and must land in the Top 10. Votes are not reset every week, so they accumulate. Frustratingly, the Race happens every Thursday, late at night (3-5AM for people in UTC+8).\n\nSo usually, only the people in the West are the only ones that can vote. Unless you have connections in the West, that’s gonna be a struggle.\n\n### Well, shit. IDK that much people there! Can you help me out?\n\nFuck yeah! This is what this Open Call is for!\n\nSome friends and I are pledging at least half of our voting power to a voting chain. Joining me are [JO7eth](https://twitter.com/JO7eth) of HanDAO and [Algoriddims](https://twitter.com/algoriddims), who I have airdropped my $WRITE tokens to so that they can have their own publication here, and help me with my mission of bringing more Asian people to the platform. I’m gonna call ourselves the **Team East Mode** for the mean time. (We’re not a DAO, lol. Unless…)\n\n**You, the creator or member of a community, MUST reply to the tweet below** with **#MirrorEastMode** on what you’ll be using Mirror for. What will you be writing about? What will you use the crowdfund for, if ever? Pitch it to us!\n\n**ALSO, please mention which country you are from.** We don’t want the group to have a dominating country. We want all countries to be represented.\n\nTeam East Mode will be picking one creator / community / organization each that we’ll vote for during the Race. Once someone is already in Mirror, we’ll be inviting them to the Discord to add to the chain.\n\nIn other words…\n\nTeam East Mode picks 3 people to bring in → Votes for Person # 1 until they get in → Votes for Person # 2 until they get in → Person # 3 → Person # 4 (Selected by Person # 1) → and so on…\n\n### What’s the catch?\n\nOnce you’re in, you’ll be able to pitch who you want to see on Mirror, and we’ll add them to the voting chain. **The catch is you have to help us vote for that person as well.** I know, having to wake up early or stay up late just to vote is a fucking pain in the ass.\n\nI personally do this as I’m not in the Western hemisphere. Sadly, if you’re like me, someone in the Eastern hemisphere, you have to join me in this struggle… *\\~\\~unless somebody wants to fucking do something about it, like IDK… \\~\\~[~~make the Race a 12-hour event again, just like the first round~~](https://dev.mirror.xyz/vZxxUIeGMQK9NNLcrT0eDYZ6wXhXVr6vTQzztj1DaEA).*\n\n### Sounds good! LFG!\n\nHell yeah! If you’re game to bring more Asian people to the platform, [sign up for the $WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) (no gas needed), and tweet us your pitch!\n\nWe also recommend putting the same pitch on the little prompt for the Race. That way, other people (besides us) will get to know you, and potentially vote for you too.\n\nYou should vote for people too! It helps get your name out there. I personally have met new people and made new friends by doing this.\n\n### Anyways…\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/belgiangwaffles)!

{"id": "F8sA5Im12wA2iLPkeEt-PwYUQlLgD8Qhivj1Dw-xFag", "title": "The Spirit of the DAO", "body": "Lately I wake up and indulge in a morning routine. I make a large pot of French press coffee, greet my Weimaraner, and then log into a technological universe to see what amazing energy in the form of bits transpired between minds, machines, and spirits while I slept.\n\nWeb3 is a living colony mind of creativity, excitement, and support for one another to build, create, and act on inspirations to harness the [adjacent possible](https://lemp.mirror.xyz/9nAXRheAFAKQKYdsa2baEIcpLslUyTJGqVXfIZe90DE).\n\nThe Spirit of the DAO is alive, and it is changing me.\n\n## What is happening\n\nIn the physical world hospitality, community, and bringing people together is core to my self identity. I host, I feed, I connect, share, and embrace those around me. In the technological world I focus internally, inquire, and follow my curiosity but haven’t shared my work too publicly. With its ethos of sharing, the web3 community joins my internal and external worlds.\n\nFor weeks I was in the weekly $WRITE race to join Mirror. The simple prompt \"what will your use Mirror for?\" lingered every Wednesday, forcing me to think about what would be my contribution to the community being built here. What was my place?\n\nWeek after week I dug deeper, begged for votes, and clarified my intent: **create a supportive community using complex systems research, art, and philosophy to build better web3 organizations.**\n\nWhat better platform to explore the concepts of systems, networks, scale, and [cybernetic organizations](https://lemp.mirror.xyz/Mf_nwOELmJChWi6oH4g-VV6QmivgiEOQGRCjWpB2MCE) than a distributed platform with tools and community embedded within?\n\n## My art auction\n\nI've been creating generative art with Processing to explore complex systems ideas for years while hording my beauties in a trove on my hard drive. The web3 community has inspired me to share my ideas with others to see where the creativity leads.\n\nWith this post I am auctioning my first minted NFTs - a small series of generative automata artworks. **Each is born from a deterministic path within multiple quadrillion possibilities of randomness, seeded and unraveled to create complex beauty from simple beginnings.**\n\nEach of these NFTs is not only a statement of non-fungible ownership, but also appreciation for the unique conditions that reveal order from chaos, and ***support for my mission to build a community where DAOs and complex systems intersect***.\n\n### Automata 0001 - Continue the Search\n\nWe are searching for a goal hidden within the complexity of our subconscious. The simple choices we make unravel and illuminate an underlying order guiding our spirit toward the evolving end state; and with this process the cycle of search and renewal lives on.\n\n[auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=4712](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=4712)\n\n### Automata 0002 - Find the Line\n\nWithin us lies a divide between comfort and creative disorder. That line is patiently waiting for us, summoning the spirit to peer across into the unknown and follow our curiosity through. Once beyond, the energy of our creative self is set free.\n\n[auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=4713](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=4713)\n\n### Automata 0003 - Where Within?\n\nA wave of creativity pulses against the walls of order in our daily lives. Sometimes the wave is subtle, hidden between the rigid structures providing predictable sequences of steps, one to the next. Our intuition finds that wave and allows it to carry the spirit away.\n\n[auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=4714](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=4714)\n\n### Automata 0004 - Secret Patterns\n\nWithin each of us exists a pattern of order and creativity. Humans have developed patterns of expression since we emerged beyond a state of simple existence into the awareness of self. Simple rules, repeated and followed, bring complex beauty to our lives.\n\n[auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=4715](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=4715)\n\n## With your support\n\nThe pay it forward, pay it back mindset leads me to release these NFTs as a split auction:\n\n* 10% of funds will go directly to support [Cabin DAO](https://creators.mirror.xyz/)\n* 10% of funds will go directly to [Jon Gold](https://twitter.com/jongold) (who gave me the $WRITE token to start this publication)\n* 10% post-sale will be donated to the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/).\n\nWeb3 is about community and I want to contribute to those who helped me realize my own potential. The rest of funds I will use to help fund my PhD, and dive deeper as a contributor to web3 projects.\n\nOver time I want to explore this model for funding research, art, and community around complex systems to build governance tools and models for sustainable DAOs.\n\nThank you, and please join me in The Spirit of the DAO.\n\n[split://0x9047996A65A130B8D333fFDBD3bb4052262800b9?network=mainnet](split://0x9047996A65A130B8D333fFDBD3bb4052262800b9?network=mainnet)\n\n", "timestamp": 1630502602, "digest": "LioIjsdpwEyHCDRwlGNC1XoLKoL8nzbcvu_K4mQLg1I", "contributor": "0x97b9958faceC9ACB7ADb2Bb72a70172CB5a0Ea7C"}

I'm a singer who became a producer out of necessity so that I could have music to sing on. I've always heard a voice in my head telling me to sing melodies over a piece of music and it took me 25 years of my life to finally listen to it and fully immerse myself in music making. I'm now 28 and for the first time in my life, I have made space for music only. I've been slowly working away to release my first set of original songs as part of an EP this year. \n\nRecently, I got exposed to Songcamp and the world of Web 3. I had a faint idea of Crypto and Web3 but participating in Songcamp has completely changed my view on this space and I'm extremely interested how I can live life as an artist only. I want to use the space and time CabinDAO is providing, to co-create a piece of music that has a visual or web3 element baked into from the start. Not a song that later gets a visual, or a song that needs to be turned into something web3, but a song that has the intention of utilizing web3 tools to be a new creation. \n\nI'm not really sure what that looks like yet, and I've only seen a few projects that seem to focus on music first (The Song that owns itself, Songcamp). I'd like to explore what a musician can do when teaming up with other creatives to create something new that has music at its core for Web3. \n\nMy goal during the month-long stay would be to create a song or piece of music alongside other CabinDAO participants or with the help of other Web3 folks. Ideally the end result isn't as simple as an audiovisual NFT. \n\nUnreleased single: <https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aj4sQx8lCyWdgsETZaVtknFwf9KB8w?e=q8irva> \n\nSpotify: <https://open.spotify.com/artist/6HG3JB45uA4EhdcLnWOJfp?si=1eZ1D20PRkK5DLS0aS02sw&dl_branch=1> \n\nSoundcloud: <https://soundcloud.com/greydientmusic>\n\n### @dela3499\n\n[https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1432362893023055875?s=21](https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1432362893023055875?s=21)\n\n### @KellyClark2021\n\n[https://twitter.com/kellyclark2021/status/1432368509783183361?s=21](https://twitter.com/kellyclark2021/status/1432368509783183361?s=21)\n\n### @uxceo\n\n[https://twitter.com/uxceo/status/1432519348351082508?s=21](https://twitter.com/uxceo/status/1432519348351082508?s=21)\n\n### @shei_p\n\n[https://twitter.com/shei_p/status/1432536032210194432?s=20](https://twitter.com/shei_p/status/1432536032210194432?s=20)\n\n### @_streamerd\n\n[https://twitter.com/_streamerd/status/1432836385828966402?s=21](https://twitter.com/_streamerd/status/1432836385828966402?s=21)\n\n", "timestamp": 1630503314, "digest": "BJUF8ygnbQY1rqpoClAsSRik0ffZdmF5LTPEGWq6gCU", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

And in the monetary side of things, **Mirror won’t take money out of any of your posts** even with the financial features mentioned above.\n\nThis is better than Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Medium, Substack, etc. who takes majority of ad revenues — leaving $0.01 or less to the people —, or a huge chunk of the money from your subscriptions.\n\n### What have people made with the features?\n\nCheck this link for a sneak peek!\n\n[https://gianferrer.mirror.xyz/3T-7InT64Tkpd6la5Xxa-ezU-JYmnAXVve_q9iKz4FU](https://gianferrer.mirror.xyz/3T-7InT64Tkpd6la5Xxa-ezU-JYmnAXVve_q9iKz4FU)\n\n### Cool! I’m interested! How can we get in?\n\nTo get in Mirror, one must go through the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) where people vote for you if they want to see your works, and must land in the Top 10. Votes are not reset every week, so they accumulate. Frustratingly, the Race happens every Thursday, late at night (3-5AM for people in UTC+8).\n\nSo usually, only the people in the West are the only ones that can vote. Unless you have connections in the West, that’s gonna be a struggle.\n\n### Well, shit. IDK that much people there! Can you help me out?\n\nFuck yeah! This is what this Open Call is for!\n\nSome friends and I are pledging at least half of our voting power to a voting chain. Joining me are [JO7eth](https://twitter.com/JO7eth) of HanDAO and [Algoriddims](https://twitter.com/algoriddims), who I have airdropped my $WRITE tokens to so that they can have their own publication here, and help me with my mission of bringing more Asian people to the platform. I’m gonna call ourselves the **Team East Mode** for the mean time. (We’re not a DAO, lol.

This is a weekly reflection essay, usually 800-1500 words (this used to be a curation newsletter – it's evolved over time) [where I open source my self-reinvention](https://www.roxinekee.com/blog/open-sourced-self-reinvention).\n\nI also have a [blog](https://www.roxinekee.com/blog) where I write about what it means to live a considered life and how to do it.\n\nAlthough I’ve been writing online for 7 years, I’ve always done it on the side or for others, as a content marketer. I’d never had the space or resources to really give my online writing undivided attention — and a real shot.\n\nUntil now.\n\nIn the first week of July 2021, I was suddenly let go from my job.

I'm a singer who became a producer out of necessity so that I could have music to sing on. I've always heard a voice in my head telling me to sing melodies over a piece of music and it took me 25 years of my life to finally listen to it and fully immerse myself in music making. I'm now 28 and for the first time in my life, I have made space for music only. I've been slowly working away to release my first set of original songs as part of an EP this year.\n\nRecently, I got exposed to Songcamp and the world of Web 3. I had a faint idea of Crypto and Web3 but participating in Songcamp has completely changed my view on this space and I'm extremely interested how I can live life as an artist only. I want to use the space and time CabinDAO is providing, to co-create a piece of music that has a visual or web3 element baked into from the start. Not a song that later gets a visual, or a song that needs to be turned into something web3, but a song that has the intention of utilizing web3 tools to be a new creation.\n\nI'm not really sure what that looks like yet, and I've only seen a few projects that seem to focus on music first (The Song that owns itself, Songcamp). I'd like to explore what a musician can do when teaming up with other creatives to create something new that has music at its core for Web3.\n\nMy goal during the month-long stay would be to create a song or piece of music alongside other CabinDAO participants or with the help of other Web3 folks. Ideally the end result isn't as simple as an audiovisual NFT.\n\nLinks to my content:\n\n* Unreleased single: <https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aj4sQx8lCyWdgsETZaVtknFwf9KB8w?e=q8irva>\n* Spotify: <https://open.spotify.com/artist/6HG3JB45uA4EhdcLnWOJfp?si=1eZ1D20PRkK5DLS0aS02sw&dl_branch=1>\n* Soundcloud: <https://soundcloud.com/greydientmusic>\n\n## Akshaj Jois\n\nCurrently studying biomedical engineering in Austin but looking to dropout to build something the regions of dao, biotech, decentralized manufacturing + smart contracts.

{"id": "Nryh1ExMqXPI58_EznVwD9193kBeD9SRcz2xEf4smeI", "title": "Open Call for Asian Creators, Communities, Organizations, etc.", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/19923afb-eb43-4f31-9d71-02e0539f63b3.jpg?height=1200&width=2400&&&&size=medium)\n\nWe’re bringing more people from Asia to this platform so that they, especially the ones from developing countries, can take advantage of Mirror’s awesome features.\n\n\n---\n\n**Mirror** is a decentralized publishing platform where writers / publishers / whoever can post works like a regular blog or newsletter (think Medium or Substack), BUT with access to Web3 tools like **NFTs, crowdfunds, auctions, automatic payment splits, and more** (all in crypto, specifically ETH / Ethereum). **This post is actually on Mirror!**\n\n### Why write on Mirror?\n\nA decentralized publishing platform means that **your content won’t be censored**. And in the monetary side of things, **Mirror won’t take money out of any of your posts** even with the financial features mentioned above.\n\nThis is better than Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Medium, Substack, etc. who takes majority of ad revenues — leaving $0.01 or less to the people —, or a huge chunk of the money from your subscriptions.\n\n### What have people made with the features?\n\nCheck this link for a sneak peek!\n\n[https://gianferrer.mirror.xyz/3T-7InT64Tkpd6la5Xxa-ezU-JYmnAXVve_q9iKz4FU](https://gianferrer.mirror.xyz/3T-7InT64Tkpd6la5Xxa-ezU-JYmnAXVve_q9iKz4FU)\n\n### Cool! I’m interested! How can we get in?\n\nTo get in Mirror, one must go through the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) where people vote for you if they want to see your works, and must land in the Top 10. Votes are not reset every week, so they accumulate. Frustratingly, the Race happens every Thursday, late at night (3-5AM for people in UTC+8).\n\nSo usually, only the people in the West are the only ones that can vote. Unless you have connections in the West, that’s gonna be a struggle.\n\n### Well, shit. IDK that much people there! Can you help me out?\n\nFuck yeah! This is what this Open Call is for!\n\nSome friends and I are pledging at least half of our voting power to a voting chain. Joining me are [JO7eth](https://twitter.com/JO7eth) of HanDAO and [Algoriddims](https://twitter.com/algoriddims), who I have airdropped my $WRITE tokens to so that they can have their own publication here, and help me with my mission of bringing more Asian people to the platform. I’m gonna call ourselves the **Team East Mode** for the mean time. (We’re not a DAO, lol. Unless…)\n\n**You, the creator or member of a community, MUST reply to the tweet below** with **#MirrorEastMode** on what you’ll be using Mirror for. What will you be writing about? What will you use the crowdfund for, if ever? Pitch it to us!\n\n[https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles/status/1433059604427010049?s=20](https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles/status/1433059604427010049?s=20)\n\n**ALSO, please mention which country you are from.** We don’t want the group to have a dominating country. We want all countries to be represented.\n\nTeam East Mode will be picking one creator / community / organization each that we’ll vote for during the Race. Once someone is already in Mirror, we’ll be inviting them to the Discord to add to the chain.\n\nIn other words…\n\nTeam East Mode picks 3 people to bring in → Votes for Person # 1 until they get in → Votes for Person # 2 until they get in → Person # 3 → Person # 4 (Selected by Person # 1) → and so on…\n\n### What’s the catch?\n\nOnce you’re in, you’ll be able to pitch who you want to see on Mirror, and we’ll add them to the voting chain. **The catch is you have to help us vote for that person as well.** I know, having to wake up early or stay up late just to vote is a fucking pain in the ass.\n\nI personally do this as I’m not in the Western hemisphere. Sadly, if you’re like me, someone in the Eastern hemisphere, you have to join me in this struggle… *unless somebody wants to fucking do something about it, like IDK… [~~make the Race a 12-hour event again, just like the first round~~](https://dev.mirror.xyz/vZxxUIeGMQK9NNLcrT0eDYZ6wXhXVr6vTQzztj1DaEA)???*\n\n### Sounds good! LFG!\n\nHell yeah! If you’re game to bring more Asian people to the platform, [sign up for the $WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) (no gas needed), and tweet us your pitch!\n\nWe also recommend putting the same pitch on the little prompt for the Race. That way, other people (besides us) will get to know you, and potentially vote for you too.\n\nYou should vote for people too! It helps get your name out there. I personally have met new people and made new friends by doing this.\n\n### Anyways…\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/belgiangwaffles)! No pitches will be accepted via DMs.\n\nGood luck, and see you around the decentralized web!", "timestamp": 1630504001, "digest": "J9eY4zliUyEeMwBEAPJ7vtTb1V4zbX7wPYQM5RVtAL8", "contributor": "0x2bD5d2e3d5852AD9960638083cb7c9F493E7A597"}

{"id": "1fjAJBgV3-2y6LiYlyQQev20sDcUOMiAxSTiWTo-GJ0", "title": "Blitmap is public domain - Blitmap - Medium", "body": "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*y7b2JsYecsWXioABH3wd9Q.jpeg?&size=large)\n\nLast night we voted unanimously to make the original Blitmap collection public domain under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).\n\nStarting today, you are free to use the original Blitmap collection for any reason and without restriction, personally or commercially. This includes any selection of pieces, components, or characters within it, or the collection as a whole.\n\nRecent developments in the NFT ecosystem indicate an increasing desire for NFTs to incorporate some of the same ideals that crypto itself is based on. Namely, that value comes from a decentralized ledger, the provenance it enables, and the trustless composability that comes out of it. At the same time, these new ideals encourage a more open ecosystem of work where historical gatekeepers (“moats”) are not the primary drivers for proliferation or longevity.\n\nWe choose to incorporate these values into our beliefs around Blitmap.\n\nWe believe that attention and mindshare — in other worlds, culture — are increasingly becoming the greatest drivers for sustainability in our space. It doesn’t matter if derivative works or outright copies can be created. In fact, it’s probably better. Every derivative work shares some of its significance with the original it was based on, and vice versa. Over time, the original has the capability to become a platform and ecosystem in and of itself.\n\nIn making our decision, we considered some pros and cons:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Decentralizes distribution and significance.** Derivatives are created trustlessly. Every derivative increases attention and mindshare of the original.\n* **Aligns interests.** Creators can make self-sustainable derivatives. They are incentivized to create more (and hopefully, higher quality) derivatives.\n* **Simplifies things.** No more worrying about rights, or answering questions about what is and isn’t okay. Everything is spelled out and easy to understand. We can focus on our work and we can be *surprised*\\*\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*by what the community does.\n* It’s **crypto-native.**\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **No exclusive rights.** Both the entity and the individual artists have the same rights as everyone else: to create derivatives.\n* **Bad actors**. The IP could be co-opted or otherwise tainted by trolls, extreme political groups, cults, etc.\n* **Will seem less valuable to some**. Some people will believe that IP is the moat and believe Blitmap has less significance if it is given up.\n\nWe also considered a list of fictional works and universes that are already in the public domain:\n\n* King Arthur\n* Shakespeare\n* Dracula\n* The Wizard of Oz\n* Jane Eyre\n* Little Women\n* Moby Dick\n* Peter Pan\n\nAn interesting thing about these examples is that many of the derivative works they are reponsible for are *not* public domain. In other words, just because the foundation and universe of King Arthur is public domain, it does not mean that adaptations like *The Green Knight* or *The Sword in the Stone* are. Still, these adaptations contribute to the significance of the original as a whole. Imagine a world where the King Arthur mythology was started on a blockchain and its components were represented as tokens. Surely, there is value in proving one is *the* creator or *the* owner of *the* Excalibur.\n\n## Does this include Blitnauts or future expansion packs?\n\nCurrently, we are releasing the original Blitmap collection, including any selection of pieces, components, or characters within it, and the collection as a whole.\n\nOur plan is to release all IP created in Season 1, including Blitnauts, the third expansion pack, and the lore reveal shortly *after* their respective drops. After Season 1, we will reevaluate and decide on our plans for future IP, but we are optimistic!\n\nYou are, of course, free to create your own expansions or interpretations (including new Blitnauts) at any time.\n\n## Does this include both originals and siblings?\n\nBecause the siblings themselves are derivative works made by combining originals, they are in a bit of a grey area. In theory, we currently have the right to release siblings, but just doing that feels strange. We value community involvement and acknowledge that the community owns most of the siblings in existence. To that end, we will put out a vote to Blitmap owners today asking for support to also release the sibling collection.\n\nRegardless of outcome, you can always use the original Blitmaps however you like, including (but certainly not limited to) remixing or combining them to create your own siblings.\n\n## What about naming?\n\nCC0 does not affect trademark rights. We are working on opening up the naming separately, but this will require a little more work on our end. For now, we would ask that you refrain from the following phrasing in your derivative works: “Official”, “Canon”, “Blitmap(s)” or “Blitnaut(s)” followed by any sequence number, *just* “Blitmap(s)”, or *just* “Blitnauts(s)”.\n\n✅ My Little Blitnauts \\n ✅ Baby Blitmaps \\n ✅ Blitland \\n ✅ Blitmaps GAN \\n ✅ Coolblits \\n ✅ Blit Blit Maps\n\n❌ Blitmaps \\n ❌ Blitnauts 2 \\n ❌ Blitmap Mk III \\n ❌ Blitnauts Part 4 \\n ❌ Official Baby Blitnauts\n\n## Does my derivative also need to be public domain?\n\nNo. There may be mutual community benefits in it but it is entirely up to you.\n\n## Do I need to acknowledge Blitmap in my derivative?\n\nNo. There may be mutual community benefits in it but it is entirely up to you.\n\n## I’m making a commercial derivative. Do I need to share profits with Blitmap?\n\nNo. There may be mutual community benefits in it but it is entirely up to you.\n\n## Does this include merch/games/toys/shows/etc?\n\nYes. You can do whatever you like.\n\n## When does this take effect? Is there documentation?\n\nAll the original artists agreed unanimously in a 17 of 17 decision, so we believe this takes effect today. For anyone who wants further assurance and immutability, we are also working on creating a smart contract that contains the release, which every artist will sign with their wallet. We expect to deploy this in the coming weeks.\n\n—\n\nWe love NFTs and the new possibilities they open for world building and storytelling. In some ways, this change is a bet on the NFT premise as a whole. In other ways, it’s just a natural extension of our own “community crafted” values. We are looking forward to seeing what we can make together.\n\nIf you are interested in discussing this or anything else related to Blitmap, join us on our Discord: **<https://discord.gg/blitmap>**\n\nP.S.

{"id": "kJIPGKLg5te__-NONBvNsQ-cFrdsu6b9FfI88YyA0HM", "title": "We Like The Loot", "body": "LOOT dropped just 5 days ago and has taken the whole NFT community by storm with simple lines of text instead of fancy jpegs.\n\n![GM](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1bea0ad8-2bc6-4c11-91cf-ee74b193035e.jpeg?height=3803&width=3626)\n\nSo, What exactly is it? It’s a deceptively simple concept. “Just a TXT file on a black background,'' consisting of randomly generated fantasy adventurer loot in a set. In fact, it was even available for anyone to mint at launch for free. The founder, Dom Hofmann of Vine, Blitmap and Supdrive fame, did not set any secondary sale fees, allowing the community to use it anyway they wanted, unbeholden to him.\n\nAt first glance, one can be forgiven for assuming LOOT was just like any other regular NFT drop (in fact, it was so under the radar, one didn’t need to jam up the gas to mint one).  Upon further reflection though, it is much more than that. It potentially represents a paradigm shift in the NFT space, for the better, taking us one step closer to cross-compatible games. \n\nWhat LOOT ultimately represents is a NFT building block, limited only by the community’s collective imagination. It feels almost like an entire community is building an open-sourced RPG in real time. This is in stark contrast with every other NFT drops that were closed ecosystems from the beginning, where founders created everything for their own benefit not caring about the possibility of building something all together. The fact that they flipped the entire script on its head is the reason why everyone is so excited about it. \n\n[https://twitter.com/tandavas/status/1432802983528448000](https://twitter.com/tandavas/status/1432802983528448000)\n\nThis is because LOOT is, in its essence, a minimum viable product that anybody can take up and expand, build upon, spin out from, and finish in however way they imagine. So far the community has been welcoming, to say the least, to this fresh take on NFTs, as is evident by how actively engaged their discord is and the depth of the lore being built around the project.  Everyone wants to be a part of it. Similarly, one can look back to DeFi Summer, and how DeFi Legos like Lending and DEXs  led to additional lego pieces like Yield Aggregators popping out as a result, one can see the similar phenomenon happening right now with LOOT as well\n\n[https://twitter.com/lootproject/status/1432793428614684674](https://twitter.com/lootproject/status/1432793428614684674)\n\n[https://twitter.com/lililashka/status/1433017503945482248](https://twitter.com/lililashka/status/1433017503945482248)\n\nThe decision to not to include any official interpretations of LOOT was an ingenious and bold take in the growing NFT-verse. This grants the community full creative autonomy over their LOOT. Imagine if you liked 1 characteristic of your CryptoPunk but didn't like how your overall Punk looked, you would tarnish the ‘identity’ of your punk had you altered it to fit your style However, with LOOT, since it’s holders have full creative autonomy,  one could easily just get a new design drawn up to suit your taste and the community as a whole would flock to appreciate it and say, ‘Looks Rare’. Arguably the fact that there’s no official artwork makes the artwork made by the community even more unique, as every artist has their own interpretation of LOOT allowing for an even broader expansion of its lore. \n\n![Woosh! You have created a new primitive!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e5a0ec3b-8f9b-4226-ad91-3858fa45da49.jpeg?height=4104&width=4105)\n\nLOOT is an evolution of NFTs with a call option on community creativity and the projects that are starting to form around it. It encapsulates the essence of the ecosystem both in the collaborative nature as well as creativity, and has injected a fresh idea into a space where we thought we had seen it all. The text, unironically, was the perfect writing prompt we needed; now everyone gets a chance to expand upon the lore of the world** \\n **\n\nWhich begs the big question, How do you value LOOT? \n\nHow do you value text? How do you value an artwork that is still in the progress of being finished with the boundless creativity of the community? Rarity by a sum of its parts? Specific equipment that makes the set exciting? Memetic power of the factions behind it?​​ \n\nOr perhaps even the case for a Bottom Up Decentralized Gaming Ecosystem Thesis (h/t Fiskantes)? \n\n[https://twitter.com/Fiskantes/status/1432984961586450432](https://twitter.com/Fiskantes/status/1432984961586450432)\n\nHonestly, there is no right answer to that yet, but we sure as hell are strapping along for the ride.\n\nPerhaps as the lo›re surrounding LOOT grows, one can ascertain the intrinsic value of the loots better as well, but we’ll ponder that in our next thread.\n\nIn the meantime, helpful threads to read up on LOOT lore 👇\n\n[https://twitter.com/ajwaxman/status/1432803519569014788](https://twitter.com/ajwaxman/status/1432803519569014788)\n\n![Thanks for reading, gn](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f6e1c9d1-c83f-4b41-9b8a-15c66c4695f5.jpeg?height=3803&width=3626)\n\n", "timestamp": 1630506502, "digest": "e1IjzeqaHdwoUd7bV5TbtQFaRkRhVMqzjiYN3CocLI8", "contributor": "0x4Ab5E3F0b2d1604dD2002CfEcA6163802D74c6Cb"}

And in the monetary side of things, **Mirror won’t take money out of any of your posts** even with the financial features mentioned above.\n\nThis is better than Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Medium, Substack, etc. who takes majority of ad revenues — leaving $0.01 or less to the people —, or a huge chunk of the money from your subscriptions.\n\n### What have people made with the features?\n\nCheck this link for a sneak peek!\n\n[https://gianferrer.mirror.xyz/3T-7InT64Tkpd6la5Xxa-ezU-JYmnAXVve_q9iKz4FU](https://gianferrer.mirror.xyz/3T-7InT64Tkpd6la5Xxa-ezU-JYmnAXVve_q9iKz4FU)\n\n### Cool! I’m interested! How can we get in?\n\nTo get in Mirror, one must go through the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) where people vote for you if they want to see your works, and must land in the Top 10. Votes are not reset every week, so they accumulate. Frustratingly, the Race happens every Thursday, late at night (3-5AM for people in UTC+8).\n\nSo usually, only the people in the West are the only ones that can vote. Unless you have connections in the West, that’s gonna be a struggle.\n\n### Well, shit. IDK that much people there! Can you help me out?\n\nFuck yeah! This is what this Open Call is for!\n\nSome friends and I are pledging at least half of our voting power to a voting chain. Joining me are [JO7eth](https://twitter.com/JO7eth) of HanDAO and [Algoriddims](https://twitter.com/algoriddims), who I have airdropped my $WRITE tokens to so that they can have their own publication here, and help me with my mission of bringing more Asian people to the platform. I’m gonna call ourselves the **Team East Mode** for the mean time. (We’re not a DAO, lol. Unless…)\n\n**You, the creator or member of a community, MUST reply to the tweet below** with **#MirrorEastMode** on what you’ll be using Mirror for. What will you be writing about? What will you use the crowdfund for, if ever? Pitch it to us!\n\n[https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles/status/1433059604427010049?s=20](https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles/status/1433059604427010049?s=20)\n\nIf you’re not on Twitter, send an email to **gianfewew@protonmail.com**.\n\n**ALSO, please mention which country you are from.** We don’t want the group to have a dominating country. We want all countries to be represented.\n\nTeam East Mode will be picking one creator / community / organization each that we’ll vote for during the Race. Once someone is already in Mirror, we’ll be inviting them to the Discord to add to the chain.\n\nIn other words…\n\nTeam East Mode picks 3 people to bring in → Votes for Person # 1 until they get in → Votes for Person # 2 until they get in → Person # 3 → Person # 4 (Selected by Person # 1) → and so on…\n\n### What’s the catch?\n\nOnce you’re in, you’ll be able to pitch who you want to see on Mirror, and we’ll add them to the voting chain. **The catch is you have to help us vote for that person as well.** I know, having to wake up early or stay up late just to vote is a fucking pain in the ass.\n\nI personally do this as I’m not in the Western hemisphere. Sadly, if you’re like me, someone in the Eastern hemisphere, you have to join me in this struggle… *unless somebody wants to fucking do something about it, like IDK… [~~make the Race a 12-hour event again, just like the first round~~](https://dev.mirror.xyz/vZxxUIeGMQK9NNLcrT0eDYZ6wXhXVr6vTQzztj1DaEA)???*\n\n### Sounds good! LFG!\n\nHell yeah! If you’re game to bring more Asian people to the platform, [sign up for the $WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) (no gas needed), and tweet us your pitch!\n\nWe also recommend putting the same pitch on the little prompt for the Race. That way, other people (besides us) will get to know you, and potentially vote for you too.\n\nYou should vote for people too! It helps get your name out there. I personally have met new people and made new friends by doing this.\n\n### Anyways…\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/belgiangwaffles) or wherever! No pitches will be accepted via DMs.\n\nGood luck, and see you around the decentralized web!", "timestamp": 1630509198, "digest": "J9eY4zliUyEeMwBEAPJ7vtTb1V4zbX7wPYQM5RVtAL8", "contributor": "0x2bD5d2e3d5852AD9960638083cb7c9F493E7A597"}

This feels especially true for NFTs, where the genesis of value is initialized by the artist while the full potential is unlocked through the power of community. It's only natural, then, that I  gravitate most towards artists who not only impress the audience but *involve* them.\n\n[https://twitter.com/JO7eth/status/1393399817724911617?s=20](https://twitter.com/JO7eth/status/1393399817724911617?s=20)\n\nOne of my favorite people in this space is a friend who goes by the pseudonym yungwknd. I first met him about 3 months ago (which in crypto-time means we've known each other forever), and at the time I knew him only as a coder who worked behind the scenes, building smart contracts for renowned artists in the space like [JAKE](https://twitter.com/jakethedegen) as a part of the [Manifold](https://twitter.com/manifoldxyz) team. However, it was't until I stumbled upon his delightfully simple, on-chain, and generative collection [Carbon RainDrops](https://carbonraindrops.com/) that I realized he is every bit an artist as he is a coder.\n\n[https://twitter.com/JO7eth/status/1415489395780685826?s=20](https://twitter.com/JO7eth/status/1415489395780685826?s=20)\n\nAfter having had the pleasure of speaking with him about his new project *[MORE or LESS](https://moreorless.eth.link/)* (which drops September 1) I can confidently say that yungwknd is a part of a new vanguard of crypto-native artists, one whose primary canvas is the blockchain and whose brushstrokes are code.\n\n### Who are you, and what's your origin story?\n\nI am yungwknd, which as you can guess is a pseudonym. The name comes from a time in my life where I only had classes and work Monday-Wednesday and so my weekend would start earlier than most. Giving birth to the name yungwknd, which is pronounced like \"young weekend.\"\n\nI heard about NFTs in the earlier part of the year, January/February just like many others. The first NFT I bought is titled \"[Strong](https://www.notion.so/d99e19a89476e2f62270e0a35bbf0756)\" and I found it while browsing OpenSea and just really liked the art and the Maya Angelou poem that came with it. After that, I really dove right in. I minted some [BGAN Punks](https://bastardganpunks.club/), some [ENS](https://ens.domains/) names, and some [Art Blocks](https://artblocks.io/) pieces.\n\nAnyway, now I'm here! I'm a software engineer by trade, and I really enjoy expressing my creativity through code and art.\n\n### Tell us a bit about your new project, MORE or LESS.\n\nFrom a very high level - *MORE or LESS* is a social experiment that allows the minter to choose their mint price of either 0.01 ETH or 0.1 ETH. There are 999 total mints available and each person can only mint once. Once sold out, whichever category has the most mints, or \"votes\", I will donate the amount of ETH in that category and keep the amount of ETH in the other.\n\nTo really dive into it, *MORE or LESS* combines a few different motifs in the NFT community.\n\nFrom a purely visual-art perspective, it falls into the category of abstract generative art. When you mint, or purchase, a piece from the project, you are buying a single output of a script that generates an SVG string and is stored on-chain.\n\nAnother big theme in the NFT space is donating to non-profits and this project is no different. For many projects, the creators decide to donate x% or y amount of ETH. What makes the donation unique here is the decision for how much to donate is out of my hands. For *MORE or LESS*, I'll be asking the community to decide. I'll expand on that a bit later.\n\nThe final motif that this project plays on is the idea of provenance. As you most likely know, transactions on the ETH blockchain are stored immutably forever so we can look back and see who minted what and when they did so. However, that's about as deep as we usually go. For *MORE or LESS*, I consider the minting experience an important event that I want to highlight. That is why each token comes with metadata that indicates who minted the token, what their \"vote\" was, and other information about the state of the experiment at that time.\n\n![moreorless.eth.link](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8b034556-e3d0-48a5-9477-b93793bb342c.png?height=1040&width=1040)\n\n### What drove you to create MORE or LESS?\n\nI first had the idea when chatting with a couple of friends. I presented the question to them - \"would you rather give me $10 or donate $100\" and I got two opposite answers. This got me thinking about what the answer might be en masse. Where would the line be drawn? Would it be at 10/100 or 10/50 or even 10/200?\n\nIt seemed like a question that would be perfect for the NFT community, where it could actually be played out instead of just theoretical questions. Just to test the waters, I brought the poll to Twitter:\n\n[https://twitter.com/yungwknd/status/1420241545534447621](https://twitter.com/yungwknd/status/1420241545534447621)\n\nAnd the results really shocked me! I was quite surprised that people would rather give me money than donate, even at a factor of 10-to-1. So, that's when I started writing up the code for the project.\n\n### Can you explain the minting mechanics and pricing model behind this project? There seem to be some interesting behavioral ideas at play...\n\nThe minting mechanics are certainly unique, in that I haven't seen them in any other projects yet. Each person gets the choice to mint at either 0.01 ETH or 0.1 ETH, with no difference in the output of the art. Additionally, there is only one mint allowed per person, sort of like they are choosing to vote to donate *more* or *less*. Whichever category gets the most votes, the ETH for that gets donated and I keep the ETH in the less category.\n\nI wanted to find the sweet spot that answers the question I posed to my friends. Early on, I even modeled out the potential results:\n\n![Green = \"community win\" Red = \"community loss\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fa209f2b-fb98-4855-ae32-e57bc2a7c935.png?height=868&width=876)\n\nIn this graph, I color in *green* what I consider a \"community win\". What this means is that the total amount donated is *more* than the total amount that I get to keep. The *red* of course is the opposite, a \"community loss\". So what's going on here? Well, the vertical and horizontal blue lines represent a given \"vote\" winning, having reached 500/999 of the mints. You can imagine that each mint moves us either up or right by one. In the model, if the *more* category wins, no matter what it's a community win. We'll be donating at minimum 50 ETH (500 x 0.1 ETH), while I get to keep at maximum 4.99 ETH (499 x 0.01 ETH). However, it's a different situation on the *less* side of things. If nearly the entire NFT community decides to mint at the *less* price, then we could have a community win. For example, if there are 950 *less* votes and 49 *more* votes, then we'll donate 9.50 ETH and I'll keep 4.9 ETH. Somewhere in the middle though, like 700 *less* votes and 299 *more* votes means that we'll donate 7.00 ETH and I'll keep 29.9 ETH.\n\nSo the math of this project really excited me and I can't wait to see how the community responds!\n\n### What inspired the aesthetic of MORE or LESS?\n\nAt first, I actually thought about the art simply being that graph above, in which a dot indicated where your vote fell on the chart. I'm glad that I very quickly abandoned this idea. I knew I wanted the art to be entirely on-chain, so that led me to try out some SVG tutorials. As you can see, there are really just a few simple shapes involved. There are circles, rectangles, triangles, and Bézier curves (lines). I continued just randomly placing them, randomly choosing their colors, etc, until I started getting outputs that I really liked.\n\nOne of my favorite traditional artists is Joan Miró. If you look up some of his early Lithographes, a lot of them are very abstract, with just random shapes and lines on the canvas. A quote of his that I think really resonates with me in relation to this project and other generative art projects is this:\n\n> When I stand in front of a canvas, I never know what I'm going to do -\n> and nobody is more surprised than I at what comes out.\n\nI think it really captures the magical experience of minting a piece of art and getting a surprise result that comes out.\n\n### The first words on your project site reads \"Provenance is everything.\" Can you expand on that?\n\nThe word \"provenance\" is thrown around a lot in art and NFTs. A quick online search shows one definition as \"a record of ownership of a work of art or an antique, used as a guide to authenticity or quality.\" I think that we as a community do a fine job of tracking the record of ownership for NFTs and this lets us easily answer questions like \"is this painting really from that artist?\". However, I feel we often miss out on some of the context along the way. With *MORE or LESS*, I highlight the minting event itself in the metadata. Though this data is accessible for other projects with tools like [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), we rarely see it brought to the forefront of the piece. For each mint, the metadata will show who minted it, whether they paid *more* or *less*, and the state of the votes at the time they minted. I'm bringing the *provenance*, or the *story*, to the foreground of the piece so that no matter where it goes, the original minter and their decision is up front and center.\n\n### How does it feel to be creating your own work versus helping other artists bring their vision to life through your work with Manifold?\n\nIt's nerve-wracking! I typically prefer to work behind the scenes to enable other artists to have great success. Putting myself out there like this is difficult and vulnerable. However, it brings me so much joy to see the all the different outputs of the algorithm I wrote along with everything else like the metadata and tech behind it. I want to bring more to the table than just the art or just the code, and I think that this \"social experiment\" is the best way for me to express my creativity with both code and art. I really hope that people participate and enjoy the experience!\n\n### What's next for you after this?\n\nWhat's next? Well, I plan to take a bit of a break. I started ideating on this in late July and have been working on the project for a bit over a month now and I don't have any concrete plans for a new project immediately after this. However, I'll leave you with one of my favorite quotes (from myself) which is \"if you have a million ideas, one of them is bound to be a one in a million idea\".\n\n### Thanks for taking the time to chat with me, friend. Congratulations on  MORE or LESS! Take care.\n\nFor those who want to stay tuned to what yungwknd has in store, be sure to follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yungwknd).", "timestamp": 1630514133, "digest": "Nr4JftIph2OkvmdRNCW7pdrvVQc15ykrPETyusgQ4U0", "contributor": "0xF65ffeD29a2E7Ca9554CfeA52EA500b5Adc5fC13"}

So far, 2021 has been about NFTs (hot [jpeg summer](https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/summer.jpg-26722) anyone?)\n\nI’m pretty sure 2022 will be all about Community DAOs.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1430694594753097728](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1430694594753097728)\n\n*Community DAOs = DeFi infrastructure + NFT business models + Creative Humans*\n\nCrypto isn’t just a technology, it’s an [internet-native economy](https://p.mirror.xyz/1EpvJwUpx_KlRcHOKLNqADEkwHL_Z1ZYKobF2uLwgBg). Revenue is tracked in ETH. Key decisions are made with community governance. Transactions are enforced on-chain through smart contracts. Treasuries are controlled via multi-sigs. And value is captured with tokens.\n\nDAOs are the native corporate structure of these crypto economies.\n\nInstead of being incorporated in Delaware or the Cayman Islands, DAOs are incorporated in Discord servers and blockchains. DAOs provide an internet-native way of pooling capital, making collective decisions, and capturing value.\n\nThese days, it seems like there’s a DAO for pretty much everything. [Collecting NFTs](https://flamingodao.xyz/collection). [Socializing](https://www.fwb.help/). [Building software](https://twitter.com/prtyDAO). [E sports](https://twitter.com/blvkhvnd). [Musicians](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc). [Media](https://twitter.com/forefront__). [Education](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq). [Funding public goods](https://twitter.com/gitcoin).\n\nBut what makes a “DAO” a *DAO?*\n\n[https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1432728441481318410](https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1432728441481318410)\n\nAlthough the purpose, scale, and sophistication of DAOs can vary, most include the same core components:\n\n* **Group chat.** Usually starts off with someone saying “wouldn’t it be cool if…” and then adding a few frens to a Telegram group or Discord server.\n* **Treasury.** The most common type of Community DAO collects blue-chip NFTs and stores them in a multi-sig. As we’ve seen with [Party Bid](https://www.partybid.app/), people love aping into NFTs with their frens. It’s an experience. Community DAOs can also bootstrap their treasury through a [tokenized crowdfund](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc). This enables the DAO to fill their treasury with ETH to spend on operations and growth.\n* **ERC-20 Token.** As word gets out about how much fun your Community DAO is having, people start blowing up your DM’s begging you to let them in. At this point, many Community DAOs issue an ERC-20 token as a way to gate membership. Depending on the exclusivity of the Community DAO, membership can cost anywhere from a few dollars worth of ETH to a few mil.\n* **Governance.** Community DAOs with valuable treasuries and hundreds of members need a way to make collective decisions. Usually, rough consensus is reached in the group chat (with emojis, ofc) and the governance vote is just a formality. But it’s fun to see who voted, how much voting power they have, and what they voted for. Also, most Community DAOs empower small, focused teams of 5 to 10 members to own specific workstreams instead of requiring a governance proposal for every smol decision.\n* **On-chain cash flow**. This is the most nascent component of Community DAOs but also the most interesting. On-chain cash flow turns a fun group chat with your frens into a sustainable business. So far, the most common way to generate on-chain cash flow has been through NFT drops.\n\nSo, are these Community DAOs *actually* working?\n\nOver the past few months, DAOs like [Fingerprints](https://fingerprintsdao.gitbook.io/fingerprints-dao/) and [Flamingo](https://twitter.com/FLAMINGODAO) have amassed five and six figure NFT collections.\n\n[https://twitter.com/awrigh01/status/1431778270727610371](https://twitter.com/awrigh01/status/1431778270727610371)\n\nDAOs like [Bright Moments](https://twitter.com/brtmoments) have sold millions worth of NFTs in minutes.\n\n[https://twitter.com/cryptovenetians/status/1427703534561206273](https://twitter.com/cryptovenetians/status/1427703534561206273)\n\n[Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), [Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq), [Forefront](https://twitter.com/forefront__), and [FWB](https://twitter.com/FWBtweets) are becoming the premier on-ramps for the next wave of active contributors in crypto.\n\n[https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1422577245671936000](https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1422577245671936000)\n\nSome DAOs like [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf/) just leave you thinking WTF.\n\n[https://twitter.com/yossihasson/status/1430815200354111488?s=20](https://twitter.com/yossihasson/status/1430815200354111488?s=20)\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject)…\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072)\n\nMultiple [top](https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/08/bright-moments-dao/) [tier](https://www.mechanism.capital/pleasrdao-thesis/) [VC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16zjMXGJwQ0s99kXLA7jW2UNNQcYQVdB9AjqaVb2s97M/edit) [funds](https://club.mirror.xyz/a5PQAwU0CuHJ90lEOmzq545nlC4qqNoTVTeHEGRrqow) have invested in these DAOs and I think they’ll end up becoming some of the best performers in their portfolios over the next decade.\n\nIn the rest of this post, we’ll take a closer look at Community DAOs - how they can become sustainable businesses, what the risks are, and what they may look like in the future.\n\n# Growing Community DAOs\n\nUnlike traditional startups, the *initial* purpose of most Community DAOs isn’t to maximize shareholder value. Instead, many Community DAOs start off just being about the vibes.\n\n![thanks drizzy for the quick vibe check](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3c93cf33-7d15-44bd-b977-8d9d0b13a961.jpeg?height=500&width=625)\n\nBut given the growth of the broader crypto market, many of these Community DAOs are finding themselves sitting on [treasuries worth millions](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) and ERC-20 tokens with [$100M+](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/friends-with-benefits-pro/) market caps. In just the past few months, they’ve gone from group chats to real businesses.\n\nOne of the keys to growing these Community DAOs will be recurring on-chain cash flow. There’s other important factors like community engagement, governance, tokenomics, etc. but generating on-chain cash flow gives Community DAOs capital to reward contributors, hire full time staff, and grow their treasury.\n\nBack in college, I studied Finance and one of the most boring things we learned was how to analyze a balance sheet. Turns out, it’s actually kinda useful.\n\nThere’s two types of assets on a Community DAO’s balance sheet:\n\n1. **Equity** (Blue-chip NFTs, Community DAO tokens, Crypto protocol tokens)\n2. **Cash** (ETH, USDC, DAI)\\*\n\n*\\*Technically ETH could be considered equity in the Ethereum network but for simplicity, let’s classify ETH as cash on the balance sheet since it’s the primary medium of exchange for DAOs*\n\nSo what can Community DAOs do with the cash and equity on their balance sheets? For many, crypto feels like a massively multiplayer [online game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game).\n\n[https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1432117673467416580](https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1432117673467416580)\n\nFor Community DAOs, the game is to increase the value of the treasury while maintaining the strong vibes that got the community going in the first place.\n\n[https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1427454307339706389](https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1427454307339706389)\n\nThere’s a few ways Community DAOs can put themselves in a position to win this game:\n\n* Collect blue-chip NFTs\n* Earn membership fees\n* Release NFT drops\n* Launch a tokenized NFT gallery\n* Build a media company\n* Sell SaaS tools\n* Invest in tokens (in DeFi protocols, NFT protocols, and other DAOs)\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each.\n\n***Collecting Blue-Chip NFTs***\n\nThis is the most common way Community DAOs get started.\n\nA group of frens want to collect blue-chips like [Punks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), [Autoglyphs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs), [DEAFBEEF](https://www.deafbeef.com/), [Fidenzas](https://tylerxhobbs.com/fidenza), [Ringers](https://artblocks.io/project/13), etc. but don’t want to put all the capital up themselves. Instead, they pool their funds to purchase a portfolio of blue-chips.\n\nHowever, in practice, storing blue-chips in a vault is *illiquid.* It doesn’t directly generate revenue. As a result, some of these DAOs issue ERC-20 tokens as a way to let people speculate on the value of the underlying NFTs, earn trading fees, and decide when to sell. [PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO), one of the largest NFT Collector DAOs, [recently announced](https://pleasr.mirror.xyz/7hpdJOWRzQx2pmCA16MDxN2FiA3eY6dwcrnEtXKnCJw) a similar liquidity strategy for their 1 of 1 Doge NFT.\n\n[https://twitter.com/business/status/1432723721521876998](https://twitter.com/business/status/1432723721521876998)\n\nThis kinda ends up being like storing gold in a vault and issuing paper certificates against it ([sound familiar?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard)). You can redeem your paper certificate for the underlying asset but you need to trust that the asset will be available and worth something when you want to redeem. But instead of gold and paper certificates we have blue-chip NFTs and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nTo be fair, some of these vaults are *extremely* valuable and have a damn good chance of being worth billions some day. So maybe instead of being like storing gold in a vault, maybe it’s more like owning equity in [iconic](https://very.auction/doge/doge) [internet](https://foundation.app/@NyanCat/nyan-cat-219) [culture](https://foundation.app/@DisasterGirl/disaster-girl-25046) and some of the most [valuable IP](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/) in the world. But the reality is that in the near term, these vaults alone don’t generate recurring on-chain cash flow.\n\nInstead of near-term cash flow, these blue-chip NFTs serve as a focal point (or as crypto people would say: [“schelling point”](https://nav.al/schelling-point)) for top collectors, artists, founders, investors, and operators to get involved in the community.\n\nAs we’ll see in the next few sections, the most valuable aspect of these vaults stuffed with blue-chip NFTs is that *they attract human capital* that converts illiquid jpegs into cash on the balance sheet.\n\n***Membership Fees***\n\n[https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera/status/1427330975227330565](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera/status/1427330975227330565)\n\nIdk about you, but the terms “follower” and “subscriber” feel weird to me. They imply a unilateral relationship. *I* follow *you*. *You* subscribe to *me*.\n\nBut the terms “member” and “owner” hit different.\n\n*We* are *members*.\n\n*We* are *owners*.\n\nIn web3, membership and ownership are encapsulated in ERC-20 tokens. Balances are stored on the blockchain. And your assets are controlled by your private key.\n\nIf the vibes are off in the community or you need liquidity after getting rekt by yet another degenerate yield farm, you can sell your tokens on an [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) or head over to the #otc channel in Discord to negotiate a fair rate. No questions asked.\n\nBut as the Community DAO increases the value of the treasury and demand for membership increases, the value of the underlying membership token increases.\n\nIf you were an early member of the community or earned a large allocation through your contributions, this can turn into meaningful wealth.\n\n![Membership in $FWB went from being worth $1,000 to $12,000 over the past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b906bb8e-f5f7-4fcb-971c-744a35cd59de.jpg?height=2138&width=1169)\n\nHowever, membership tokens aren’t just about “nUmBeR gO uP”. At a deeper level, the token is a coordination mechanism to help online communities *create*, *capture*, and *redistribute* value.\n\nAnd because token holders are also community members, they don’t need to fire up an Excel spreadsheet and make resource allocation decisions based on DCF analyses. Unless they want to.\n\nInstead, Community DAOs invest in whatever they want. Sometimes that’s [donating to charities](https://nouns.wtf/vote/1). Other times that’s [popping bottles in Paris](https://gallery.fwb.help/fwb-paris).\n\n***NFT drops***\n\nThis is the most common way Community DAOs generate on-chain cash flow. Some of these drops post serious numbers. This past weekend, Bored Ape Yacht Club sold $92M worth of [Mutant Ape NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/mutant-ape-yacht-club) in one hour.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Dogetoshi/status/1431792801751183363](https://twitter.com/Dogetoshi/status/1431792801751183363)\n\n[https://twitter.com/richerd/status/1431999591176572934](https://twitter.com/richerd/status/1431999591176572934)\n\nAnother one of my favorite drops recently was a collab between [Arihz](https://twitter.com/framergence) (an anonymous Brazilian computer scientist / NFT artist) and [FingerprintsDAO](https://twitter.com/FingerprintsDAO) (one of the leading collector DAOs for smart contracts as art). The drop was called [Avid Lines](https://avidlines.art/) and in the first 30 days, it’s done almost $10M in trading volume.\n\n[https://twitter.com/AvidLines/status/1430215479277146113](https://twitter.com/AvidLines/status/1430215479277146113)\n\nMore importantly, the drop was a great example of how to remix NFT IP in a fun and interesting way. It was a derivative of [Autoglyphs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs), which is the most valuable collection in the FingerprintsDAO treasury.\n\nHere’s how it worked:\n\n* Minters chose an Autoglyph to use as the base input for the generative algorithm\n* Autoglyph holders could whitelist their Autoglyphs to receive 10% of primary sales for mints that used their Autoglyph as the base input\n* The generative algorithm combined the base Autoglyph input with Arihz’s randomization code and the output was a remix called Avid Lines (and they’re fvcking beautiful)\n\n[https://twitter.com/dgntec/status/1417936546079072256](https://twitter.com/dgntec/status/1417936546079072256)\n\nSome of the most popular NFT drops are derivative projects that take blue-chip NFT IP and remix them in a way that’s fun, game-like, and visually appealing. These derivative projects are interesting because *they take illiquid jpegs* stored in a vault and *turn them into productive assets*. Some Autoglyph holders earned $40k worth of ETH by simply calling a whitelist function on a smart contract.\n\nAs DAOs look for new ways to increase the value of the NFTs in their treasury, we’ll continue seeing more derivative drops like these that enhance the value of the core IP while also turning NFTs into productive assets.\n\n***Tokenized NFT Gallery***\n\nMost Community DAOs don’t have their own tokenized NFT gallery yet. But in the near future I think it’ll become one of the most popular ways for Community DAOs to generate on-chain cash flow.\n\n[https://twitter.com/andy8052/status/1430715288622936066](https://twitter.com/andy8052/status/1430715288622936066)\n\nThe basic idea is:\n\n* Members use the Community DAO token to vote on which artists / drops can mint on their site\n* Multiple drop mechanisms are supported (reserve auctions, dutch auctions, editions, raffles, airdrops, generative, etc.) by letting devs register smart contracts with the DAO’s NFT gallery registry\n* Revenue from primary and secondary sales is shared between the artist, dev team, and DAO treasury\n* Artists, collectors, dev teams, and other contributors receive Community DAO tokens\n* Token holders get access to members-only features like exclusive drops, NFT badges, discounts, physical prints, merch, and more\n\nThis allows Community DAOs to build their own NFT marketplaces while rewarding token holders, artists, collectors, and devs with a mix of cash and equity. The curation abilities of top Community DAOs will eventually turn these NFT galleries into incubators for emerging artists.\n\nFor example, if you’re a generative artist and FingerprintsDAO votes you in to the their gallery, it’s basically like being a fashion designer and getting your latest clothing line in Vogue. This creates a reflexive feedback loop where the top Community DAOs build status by curating high-quality NFT collections and then help the next generation of artists get distribution while earning fees.\n\nIt’s kinda like [CAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency) or a [record label](https://jarroddicker.medium.com/?p=e14b695c43b) for internet culture.\n\n***Owned Media***\n\nBuilding media properties isn’t as sexy as a tokenized NFT gallery, but they work. Start a podcast and / or newsletter, find some sponsors, and boom. There ya go.\n\nThe top Community DAOs should have a pretty easy time finding sponsors given their community is filled with progressive individuals with cash to spend on random stuff like digital pet rocks.\n\n[https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/1431242146309238791](https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/1431242146309238791)\n\n[Club Top Shot](https://twitter.com/clubtopshot) is one of my favorite examples of a media company being built around an NFT collection.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ClubTopShot/status/1430519333613096964](https://twitter.com/ClubTopShot/status/1430519333613096964)\n\n[UTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Talent_Agency), one of the premier Hollywood talent agencies, [recently signed](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/) Larva Labs (creator of CryptoPunks, Autoglyphs, and Meebits) and will represent them across film, TV, video games, publishing, and licensing. Imagine Kevin Hart being the voiceover for a CryptoPunk or Meebit in a Netflix show lmfao. I’d watch that in a heartbeat.\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1432764961227481089](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1432764961227481089)\n\n***SaaS Tools***\n\nMost Community DAOs go through the following cycle pretty much every week:\n\n* A problem surfaces that needs to be solved\n* Somebody does research on the existing tools\n* Turns out none of the tools do exactly what the community needs\n* *\\*Ugh\\**\n\nFWB is one of the most active DAOs in building custom tooling for their community. When they needed a way to token-gate IRL events, [they built it](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/XU5_RYsow8fDbbckryr2snNyfrMV8HTJ0N39Cjkfy3s). When they needed a dashboard to highlight key information about the community, [they built it](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/KhvEi3kHy6rBJX9Lm4DI-iMkbzebEyNdM05uAB_StGY) (and it’s [vibey af](https://www.fwb.help/pulse)).\n\nOthers DAOs like Yearn built a [decentralized payroll management tool](https://medium.com/iearn/decentralized-payroll-management-for-daos-b2252160c543) because they wanted a more meritocratic way of rewarding contributors.\n\nAs Community DAOs become aggregators for top talent in crypto, we’ll see more custom tooling built to serve the broader community. And similar to how YC startups usually get initial distribution from other startups in their batch, Community DAOs will get their initial distribution from the other DAOs and projects their community is involved with.\n\n***Tokens (DeFi protocols, NFT protocols, and other DAOs)***\n\nIt’s been interesting to see DAOs align incentives by investing in each other. A few months ago FWB and WHALE did a [token swap](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmWnifY3KD5ECJNtQ23m9GHt2oQ1McA3T4DEEpFarPy9jW) where the stake in $FWB was valued at $100k. Today, that stake is worth $1.5M.\n\nGiven the amount of human capital inside these DAOs, most crypto protocols will probably have a few DAOs on their cap table as strategic investors helping with distribution, connections, and domain expertise. As the crypto market grows, these DAO-to-DAO stakes could end up being very, very large. These stakes will also create a new type of mutual alignment at a level we haven’t seen before in the competitive world of business.\n\n# Risks\n\nLike any investable asset, Community DAOs live along a risk-reward spectrum.\n\nSome of the main risks of Community DAOs include:\n\n* **Bad OpSec.** A DAO’s assets (NFTs, ETH, and ERC-20s) are stored in a smart contract that lives on the blockchain. Usually, the contract is a multi-sig wallet controlled by a trusted group of community members. To withdraw assets, a threshold needs to be reached where multiple people sign a transaction with their crypto wallet to authorize it. This prevents one of the signers from going rogue and rugging the community. Or in case one signer loses access to their private key, there should be enough redundancy in the system that transactions can still be signed and submitted. Ideally, we remove the need for any trusted parties and integrate governance with trustless transaction execution through something like [SafeSnap](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f). But in practice, most communities will require some level of trust in a select group of community members to ensure assets are stored and managed securely.\n* **Potential ETH / NFT crash.** Are NFTs in a bubble? Probably. The recent run up in prices mimics the boom and bust nature of [most technology cycles](http://lao8n.com/blog/2015/12/3/carlota-perez-technology-revolutions-financial-capital). If ETH prices crash, Community DAOs will have less cash on the balance sheet and will need to mark down the book value of their NFT assets. It’s a real risk. Many DAOs implement treasury diversification strategies with the help of domain experts like [Llama](https://www.llama.xyz/) to ensure they’re able to weather a bear market. DAOs can convert ETH to stables like USDC or DAI to protect against ETH volatility. The best DAOs will have recurring on-chain cash flow and efficient cost structures that enable them to weather a bear market.\n* **Lack of community engagement.** People are the heartbeat of any community. DAO or otherwise. The best Community DAOs have a mission that goes much deeper than “nUmBeR gO uP”. Collective action towards this mission is what keeps the core contributors and active community members coming back every day. But when people get distracted by token prices, or the core team loses interest, culture deteriorates. The magic of these Community DAOs are the people. The Discord mods that stay up all night answering questions. The volunteers that write documentation to help new members. A lot of the most valuable work in communities goes unnoticed and unrewarded. Community members need [intrinsic motivation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5364176/) to drive the community forward. Otherwise, the community will slowly devolve into just another inactive group chat.\n* **Poorly designed tokenomics.** The two biggest risks with tokenomics are: 1) the core team not having a large enough stake to keep them incentivized and 2) adversarial whales accumulating too many tokens and using them to manipulate the network through governance and / or negative price action. We’re still in the early stages of understanding best practices for Community DAO tokenomics. Many communities bring on experts like [Fire Eyez](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao), [Delphi Digital](https://twitter.com/Delphi_Digital), and [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/GauntletNetwork) to help develop a robust token strategy.\n\n# Future of Community DAOs\n\nHere’s a few predictions on the future of Community DAOs:\n\n* **There will be many billion dollar Community DAOs.** This probably isn’t controversial amongst crypto-natives but if you take a moment to think about it, it’s pretty wild. Online communities live across Discord servers, Telegram chats, Twitter DM’s, FB groups, Patreon, etc. A DAO structure gives these online communities the ability to coordinate capital, make collective decisions, and capture value with an internet-native currency. The canonical example of a community that could’ve used this functionality is [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) during the [GME short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze). Aside from just investing, I think there will be billion dollar community DAOs across gaming, publishing, music, education, art, software development, and more.\n* **Community tokens > Social tokens.** For the past couple years, social tokens were a hot topic when discussing the future of crypto-native consumer apps. The thought went, *“wouldn’t it be cool if you could invest in people the same way you can invest in stocks?”* [Bitclout’s](https://bitclout.com/) initial traction was a sign that there’s demand for this type of product. But social tokens focused on one person can lead to burnout, mental health issues, and regulatory risk. So instead of social tokens focused on individual people, I think *community tokens* focused on the *collective efforts* of groups of people will become the dominant model. Investing in the Mr. Beast token is boring. Being a member in the Mr. Beast community is fun. Social tokens feel like a top-down approach. A creator and their management team retains full control over creative decisions and IP. But as we’re seeing with [BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) and [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject), bottoms-up decentralized communities with the right incentives have the potential to create much more value than a centrally coordinated effort. It reminds of Windows / MacOS vs. Android / Linux. Arguably, the centrally coordinated approach of Windows / MacOS won in the previous era because they were able to bundle a proprietary operating system with other products like the MS Office Suite and the iPhone that had strong business models. Meanwhile, there was no native business model for open source software like Android or Linux. To capture value, Google acquired Android and bundled it into smart phones and SaaS companies like Red Hat bundled Linux into enterprise services. But now ERC-20 tokens and NFTs give open source software a business model. And not just open source software, but also open source IP. To me, social tokens are imply a top-down centrally coordinated effort whereas community tokens imply a bottoms-up decentralized community with full access to the underlying IP. The latter feels much more crypto-native to me.\n* **Service DAOs will play a key role in scaling Community DAOs.** In crypto, there’s a whole new set of specialized skills needed to build a successful project. Things like tokenomics design, treasury management, community management, onboarding, governance, smart contract development, data science, protocol security, OpSec, etc. Because there aren’t many experts in these areas yet, we’re already seeing crypto-native agencies (i.e., “Service DAOs”) that aggregate the best talent for a specialized skill and provide services to other DAOs. There’s [Llama](https://www.llama.xyz/) for treasury management, [Fire Eyez](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao) for tokenomics, and [Vector](https://twitter.com/VectorDAO) for designing crypto apps. Service DAOs combine the flexibility of freelancing with the upside of startups. Most get paid in a combination of ETH and ERC20-tokens so there’s skin-in-the-game and aligned incentives. As these Service DAOs build out their processes, hire more talent, and build software to automate their services, it’ll be much easier for Community DAOs to solve some of their toughest problems and help them scale.\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nCommunity DAOs are the next evolution in online communities. It’s like if subreddits had a shared bank account, a token, and governance mechanisms. They’ll become the [new social networks](https://www.notboring.co/p/status-monkeys). And the best way to learn is by actively contributing.\n\nHere’s what I usually share with friends interested in contributing to Community DAOs:\n\n* Join 3 to 5 Discord servers to get a sense of the different vibes\n* Introduce yourself in the #introductions channel and read the other intros to get an understanding of who’s in the community\n* Find two or three channels that are most relevant to you and check them multiple times a day. Ask questions. Answer questions. Offer encouragement.\n* Read the governance forum to understand what the top priorities are for the community and how they make decisions\n* Attend voice chats to build relationships with the most active contributors\n* Now, after this initial research phase, choose the top one or two Community DAOs you vibe with and *double down* on them\n* Find a committee you can help with and work on a project. As you get more comfortable, take on a leadership role\n* Try to get rewarded with the Community DAO’s token to align incentives and truly become an owner in the community\n* Iterate and repeat\n\nThe DAO maestro himself [Coopahtroopa](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa) recently published [an article](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw) with a bunch of DAOs you can contribute to as well as a list of people to follow.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1432403329422741504](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1432403329422741504)\n\nThe demand for talent in the space far exceeds supply so if you’re at all interested, don’t hesitate to jump in and start contributing.\n\nUntil next time ✌️\n\n\n---\n\n*Thanks for reading and feel free to DM me on Twitter with any questions, comments, or memes [@patrickxrivera](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera)*", "timestamp": 1630515835, "digest": "cVN3KOss0uqpZwxHQKtC4Syvn1RfXaxofFKHJuKLWS4", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

That citizens endure such agony only reveals how indispensable this infrastructure is. A New Yorker’s life is spent “in transit,” rushing up the stairs to the station platform, getting on and off and to transfer, and feeling relief as the train rumbles over impossible social distances.\n\n![Sunlight streams through the windows in the concourse at Grand Central Terminal in New York City in 1954 | AP Photo](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a0293ef1-d9f1-4794-93ac-81ebd08ea244.png?height=808&width=1200)\n\n### The Most Famous Project that Almost Never Got Built\n\nThe complex transportation system that supports over five million journeys a day was an audacious dream that took almost a century to realize. Consider one of these projects — Second Avenue Subway — which was received excitedly when it was proposed in 1920.\n\nHowever, it soon proved a prime example of the pitfalls of bureaucratic power-brokering — conflicts of interest between politics and capital halted the proposed project again and again. Optimism for the project’s completion ebbed and flowed depending on political priorities. It wasn’t until 2017, a century after the initial proposal, that the $17-billion project finally started serving passengers.\n\nA turning point occurred in 1988. Just as the failure of the entire project began to seem inevitable, four young city planners sat down in a crumbling old office on Lawrence Street in downtown Brooklyn. They spent weeks poring over statistics that measured travel time, ridership, crowding, and delays. With just one phone and one computer, they analyzed how rerouting trains, skipping stations, and overnight shuttle services could improve the performance and productivity of the subway system. Their plan was by and large the one that now supports over five million journeys a day.\n\nWhat made the difference? They were not power brokers, but rather citizens and prospective passengers of the very system they were designing.\n\n### Physical vs Digital Infrastructure\n\nFor anyone whose vocation involves the building and designing of systems of software, the dynamics around bottoms-up design and top-down execution must feel familiar. Individuals who are users of the system desire to improve it with no conflicting incentives but to improve their ways of living, goodwill, and reputation.\n\nBuilders of digital infrastructure should keep these lessons from our forebears in mind while considering the different affordances and requirements of the new medium. In *“Roads and Cities, ”* Nadia Eghbal made a brilliant juxtaposition between physical and digital infrastructure:\n\n> *Physical infrastructure is built to last, which is partially why these projects take so long to plan, fund, and build. The London Underground, London’s public rapid transit system, was built in 1863; the underground tunnels dug for the subway system are still in use today. The Brooklyn Bridge, which connects the boroughs of Brooklyn and Manhattan in New York City, was completed in 1883 and did not undergo any major renovations until 2010, over one hundred years later.*\n>\n> *Digital infrastructure not only requires frequent maintenance and upkeep to be compatible with other software components but its usage and adoption change frequently as well. A bridge built in the middle of New York City will have fairly consistent and guaranteed usage, commensurate with the rise or decline of the city’s population. But a programming language or framework could be extremely popular for several years, then fall out of favor when something faster, more efficient, or simply trendier comes along.*\n\nIn short, physical infrastructure traditionally *frontloads* investment costs while digital infrastructure, despite the absence of intense physical labor, much lower upfront cost, and nonlinear scalability, requires immense time and energy for *ongoing* maintenance and improvement. This makes sense: the most difficult and complex in real estate is building the first instance of a piece of infrastructure whereas in digital infrastructure, stakeholder management is an ongoing task that only gets more complex as operations grow.\n\nThe question is then how to incentivize and sustain digital infrastructure that prioritizes its citizens. Currently, the only path to longevity and sustainability for digital infrastructure is to pursue venture capital funding, corporate or ad-hoc donations, or simply to become an open-source commercial software for large enterprises by building a dedicated go-to-market and customer success team.\n\nThe flaws of each approach are apparent. Venture capital is a viable path if what the core team desires is rapid commercial growth, but it often creates boom-or-bust outcomes. Meanwhile, corporate donations can challenge the neutrality of the infrastructure, and ad-hoc donations shorten the horizon for planning and resourcing labor. Finally, becoming a service provider requires significant upfront capital, and even the most well-funded of enterprise SaaS companies have rarely allowed money to flow back as donations to the initial community of open-source developers who laid the foundations of their success.\n\nThe story of the internet is often one of open-source labors of love that quickly become gated, even from their own workers who are eventually stripped of optionality and agency. In today’s environment, more and more functions are regarded as fungible, to be delegated to anonymous freelance services and marketplaces whose workers have little autonomy and ownership over the work they produce. Workers are left to relate to each other as rectangle boxes on a screen rather than evolving, multidimensional bodies.\n\nIt’s not hard to extrapolate the future from these little rectangles. It is the future of a hyper-gig economy where only technically literate solopreneurs comfortable with building their own brand can achieve a meaningful moat through individuation, and most are treated as fungible.\n\n### Infrastructure of the Future\n\n**At STATION, we believe a permissionless, decentralized railroad built by the people could fundamentally change the relationship between our work and our identity.** We’re building the talent infrastructure and network centered around contribution and collaboration. Our goal is to empower internet-native workers by validating their contributions on-chain and helping connect them to the most interesting opportunities and connections based on that data.\n\nAt its best and most democratic, infrastructure offers social connectivity while affording those who have been marginalized on the outskirts of society the opportunity to pursue economic and creative opportunity —  be they writers that publish visual novels online, amateur gamers with a passion for digital fashion design, or teachers whose income currently depends on the rules of the platforms they serve.\n\nThis infrastructure does not currently exist for crypto. It’s currently extremely difficult for newcomers, especially if they are not technologists themselves, to navigate the ecosystem, quilted together across Discord servers and Telegram group chats.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b8aa7d0c-b578-4564-a5da-895f42acc325.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nHowever, we realized there was a deeper disconnect among those looking to build a financially sustainable, open-source future. Quite simply, for brilliant folks not currently in crypto, being asked to leave traditional tracks to jump into the great unknown without any guardrails or clear path is a tall order. The questions that came up when we interviewed brilliant friends who had not yet made the leap into crypto were not about how crypto worked, but questions around identity, meaning, and impact. ***Who’s in crypto, and why do they care about it? Why would I consider contributing? Why does it matter to me now? Why does this matter at all in 5 years?*** These questions are as important to understand the motivations of individuals as well as those of organizations. There’s a myriad of content out there explaining what crypto does, but few are answering these more fundamental questions of identity and meaning.\n\nWe believe that there is no single correct answer to these questions. The Internet is never static, but always evolving. The answer to those questions isn’t prescriptive, but something that helps people take action and form relationships.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/00737012-0c54-4017-b3f6-9e5f52d27828.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe atomic units of our product are Profiles, Terminals, and Contributions. Everyone will have a Profile on Station that aggregates their Contributions across platforms, their on-chain interactions, the groups they represent, and their closest collaborators. They will discover and get directed to values-aligned Terminals (projects, DAOs, or protocols) that are actively looking to attract and onboard more contributors through grants, RFPs (Request for Proposal), and bounties. By submitting Contributions to Terminals and tagging collaborators along the way, the Profiles will be further enriched and legitimized.\n\nThe rapidly increasing fidelity of on-chain social data, the increasing adoption of SSI wallets, and the increasing sophistication of contribution-driven tokenomics have inspired us to iterate quickly on the products and services to connect passengers to the places that will be most excited about the value they have to offer.\n\nFor example, someone with a $WRITE token who also mints poetry on Hic Et Nunc will be able to discover others with similar interests and projects that are looking for writers. Someone with a consistent POAP portfolio should be given higher priority consideration when protocols or DAOs evaluate the matriculation of new contributors.  Someone with a background in financial modeling and analysis should be given the opportunity to suggest improvements to protocol treasuries or token design mechanisms. And perhaps most importantly, newcomers will understand how and where to contribute in crypto, the paths others have taken, and what is possible for them if they do come on board.\n\n**Web3 is as much of a technological as it is a social movement.** As life migrated online during the pandemic, we saw a surge in crypto-related innovation, including the thrilling Defi summer and an abundance of new NFT projects and platforms. People collaborated in a frenzy on Discord and Telegram. We realized it was possible to coordinate people across the world. New kinds of work were enabled, along with newly crypto-enabled means for rewarding such contributions. Just like the four young planners on Lawrence Street in 1988 who were redesigning the city’s public transit system, the power lies with those who have the initiative and the desire to realize new opportunities for work and ownership.\n\n**We dream of a future of meaningful work for everybody.** We know this dream is audacious, but we also believe that it is tractable for the first time. We at Station are huddled, not in an old office in Brooklyn, but in a cozy corner of cyberspace. We’re studying the communities and natural desire paths of those arriving in crypto, and building infrastructure thoughtfully and joyfully in anticipation of the millions who will soon arrive asking for directions. We hope to not only hand them a map they can trust, but welcome them aboard and support them in whatever journey they take.\n\n**If this is a dream you’d like to be a part of, sign up for early access [here](http://station.express/).**\n\n**If you’re interested in contributing, please reach out [here](https://twitter.com/0xSTATION).**\n\nWith love,\n\nSTATION STAFF", "timestamp": 1630516993, "digest": "D0r869DJuky7fydeX6e6dR1Th5ukwRa6tNw1g2fuJv0", "contributor": "0x78918036a8e4B9179bEE3CAB57110A3397986E44"}

WOOF!\n\nWhat started off as ‘just’ an internet meme has worked its way into becoming a cultural phenomenon and a perennial piece of art. Doge, centered around a Shiba Inu dog with suboptimal grammar, has undoubtedly become the most loved meme of the decade. Whilst weaving its way into our hearts, this special canine has also paved the way for the viral memes that came after it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64801586-0ab9-4e5b-b02a-25467bfdc367.png?height=480&width=640)\n\nIn June 2021, Atsuko Sato, the owner of the famous Shiba Inu (who goes by Kabosu), [minted the original photo as an NFT](https://zora.co/0x337071a7e907f5a599747a2c9baf6efdf7eb4bcc/3366). The NFT is the rare 1/1 original piece that pays tribute to the whole Doge movement and related internet phenomena. It was sold for a record-breaking price of 1696 ETH ($5.5 million) to PleasrDAO, an experimental art collective.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9298ef46-6f53-4aa8-8693-c68467776fb8.png?height=1218&width=1840)\n\n**Oke, so wat?**\n\nToday, PleasrDAO is announcing that the NFT has been fractionalized into billions of pieces to be shared with the broader internet community. Using [fractional.art](https://fractional.art/vaults/0xbaac2b4491727d78d2b78815144570b9f2fe8899), the original Doge NFT has been divided into billions of $DOG ERC-20 tokens, allowing everyone and everything, including also cats, to own a piece of history.\n\n**How it werk? 🤔**\n\nThe initial auction of $DOG fractions will take place on September 1st, at 1pm EST and it will be the first opportunity for people to own this piece of art. Thereafter, it will be available to exchange on [fractional.art](https://fractional.art) or through decentralized exchanges such as [sushi.com](https://sushi.com) or [uniswap.org](https://uniswap.org).\n\nTalking numbers, there will initially be 20% of total $DOG supply available in the auction. That is 3,393,939,393 $DOG of the total supply of 16,969,696,969. An additional 25% of $DOG tokens have been allocated to $DOG community programs and continued development.\n\nOur goal at PleasrDAO is to be good stewards of this meaningful piece to help her reach her full potential. We have plans for a $DOG dev fund for projects aimed at supporting the long term community, and we will be the primary provider of liquidity on exchanges. PleasrDAO has discussed many mechanisms for getting all $DOG into the hands of the community without resulting in downward price pressure. We will ensure The Doge NFT does not go up for auction until we feel $DOG has reached full meme escape velocity and is coupled with a strong, thriving community.\n\nFor now, it’s very much as if the Louvre decided to fractionalize the Mona Lisa and distribute a portion of it for the public to own. However, unlike at the Louvre, collective ownership of art is really only possible using crypto art. In this digital-first world, NFTs can capture significant moments, phenomena and concepts while a smart contract can fractionalize and distribute them to the public. An incredible thing to witness and be a part of.\n\n**I buy Doge, now wat? 🎉**\n\nAfter securing a rightful place in the annals of history books, you, as a proud Doge owner, are granted additional benefits. *Much excite, very fun!*\n\nDoge ownership gives you access to an exclusive set of activities, both on- and woofline. Consider this your lifetime ticket to a perpetual festival of delight and entertainment brought to you directly by the Doge community. More details on that will soon be posted on the [Doge Discord](https://discord.gg/WyqUTTXQ).\n\n**Diamond Paws 👇**\n\nWith great pawer comes great respawnsibility. 🐾 Aside from special benefits, $DOG holders can also exercise their ownership of the NFT by voting on the valuation of the original NFT. In other words —  determine how much the NFT is worth. If sold at a given price, which is collectively determined by the whole holder base, ownership of the Doge NFT will transfer to the new owner and token holders will then be able to trade their tokens at a price proportional to that of the sale.\n\n\n---\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/447265fb-5fb4-4e24-b3a9-876b8cac27d8.png?height=476&width=796)\n\n**20% Initial Auction**\n\n* This supply will be auctioned off to the public through a batch auction at 1pm EST on September 1st, 2021.\n\n**25% Community Fund**\n\n* This will be used to provide liquidity and fund community projects such as special NFT projects, Doge parties, token-gated merch, metaverse fun, community managers, developers, PleasrLabs projects meant to bolster the one and only Doge, and lots more.\n* So far, only 1.15% in total has been committed to early contributors, artists and community managers. 1% is under a 12 month vest while 0.15% is under a 6 month vest from the date of the auction.\n\n**55% PleasrDAO**\n\n* PleasrDAO is an art collective that buys and stewards culturally significant NFTs. PleasrDAO is dedicated to a healthy transition of the most important NFTs to community ownership. They bought the original Doge NFT and for now will maintain 55% of it, acting as the main custodians. The DAO has no intention to sell this ownership and if that changes it will be communicated ahead of time. The DAO may use use the portion to backstop the community treasury should it run out.\n\nTotal Circulating Supply Post Miso Auction 20% sold at auction + $DOG in Liquidity Pool\n\n\n---\n\n**Your Guide Doc to buy $DOG**\n\n*A simple step-by-step tutorial on how to get $DOG tokens and earn your rightful place in history*\n\nIf you are reading this, you are special, much special. We are beyond excited to have you on board as we set out to begin a journey that will echo in eternity. Here is how to get started and become an Internet culture pioneer.\n\n* As a first step, make sure you’ve loaded up on some ETH in your crypto wallet, you’ll need it to complete the whole process. Don’t have a wallet? [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) are great options.\n* Head over to the [SushiSwap App](https://app.sushi.com/swap), connect your wallet (Top Right), and swap your ETH (*Swap From*) into Wrapped ETH (*Swap To*). This is simply wrapping your ETH so it will work with the Miso auction.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9a8c5fc3-927b-48d2-a41b-672cf5478af6.png?height=780&width=1212)\n\n* The $DOG auction will take place on [Miso](https://miso.sushi.com/auctions/0x5e29C9Bf97c45e55f1c2257D0Ecf6909726745f3). Again, make sure your wallet is connected and then head over to *Marketplace* > *Live Sales* from the left-hand side menu. You should be seeing the $DOG sale.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a387159f-a7ea-43ca-87a4-6193ca364195.png?height=1800&width=2880)\n\n* Use the slider on the right-hand side to choose how much ETH you want to spend on $DOG tokens and adjust accordingly. You will get $DOG proportional to the total amount of ETH committed.\n* Approve the transaction by clicking on ‘Commit ETH’ and completing the steps on your MetaMask wallet.\n* Once the auction ends, come back to the same page to claim your tokens to your MetaMask wallet. Everyone gets $DOG at the same price.\n* Woof, congratulations! You now own a piece of history and the internet’s best friend, guaranteed to make you the center of attention at every party you attend for the rest of your life. Tread lightly. And take care of Doge.\n\n\n---\n\nAlright folks, that’s enough alpha right there. We’ve already shared a tad too much and don’t want to get in twable…\n\nGo ahead and head over to our [website](http://doge.pleasr.org) to find out more about the upcoming Doge auction and follow us on Twitter to stay ahead of the curve for when we post the latest updates.\n\n*Woof 🐶*", "timestamp": 1630518423, "digest": "7hpdJOWRzQx2pmCA16MDxN2FiA3eY6dwcrnEtXKnCJw", "contributor": "0x9E64B47bBdb9c1F7B599f11987b84C416C0c4110"}
{"id": "8vWvh2b5e5NFh38KGdc1cKkFe-hR4sc5_qX1AomESlE", "title": "Crypto's Consumer Era", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/172eb5ee-8623-4ecd-8081-168ee0572a68.png?height=385&width=601)\n\nA few years ago it was common to hear the phrase, “we’re still waiting for crypto’s killer app.”\n\nCrypto markets weren’t quite ready for mainstream attention. The past five years of crypto were heavily focused on financial infrastructure and technological foundations. \n\nBut we’ve now experienced early product-market fit in DeFi, an explosion of projects like NBA Topshot, Axie Infinity, Cryptopunks and onboarded the first [\\~100M users](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/3rd-global-cryptoasset-benchmarking-study/) to crypto. ***The next 100M crypto users will be driven by consumer applications. ***\n\nTraditional consumer has gone through a transformation in the past thirty years. Consumer was about the physical -  food, beverages, media and entertainment. But eventually, the internet offered a digital business model for everything physical. Consumers now access virtually any product or service with a few clicks. Consumer brands have vastly expanded their distribution and business economics due to the internet. \n\nSo what will define the next consumer transformation? Crypto. There are 3 major reasons why crypto is poised to do this:\n\n**Ownership \\n **Crypto enables ownership from day one-- a powerful concept. For the first time, users can partake in the growth and success of the products and communities they are a part of, from the beginning. Ownership changes the model from extractive to additive. The main mechanism for ownership has been via tokens - whether they are fungible or non-fungible. Tokens offer users the ability to partake in governance, access user benefits, and more. Tokens turn users into advocates. Each additional user in a given network benefits alongside the entire network. Rather than providing content, time, attention for free, they are rewarded for making products and services successful.  \n\n**24/7 Markets \\n **Second, is the nature of crypto markets. Crypto never sleeps. Similar to how the internet trained millions of users to fast instant community, 2-day delivery, and simple UX, crypto will train users to expect 24/7 markets. The past decade has seen exchanges like Coinbase and Binance grow a user base that’s come to expect 24/7 global markets. DeFi is accessible to anyone with an internet connection. We’re now taking this to the next level by making the internet ownable. Marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.com) provide exposure to non-fungible tokens at any time of day. Consumers are shifting expectations to meet this cadence.\n\n**Open Access \\n **Lastly, a defining pillar for crypto is around open global access. The internet turned e-commerce, advertising, and media into global all-consuming models. Advertisers are able to personalize and target users while social media launched the influencer career model. However, the beneficiaries of the internet continue to be limited to a smaller set of stakeholders. Geographical constraints will continue to fall away, giving users opportunities to work and play online in manners that weren’t previously available. The focus is now on the long tail of creators and communities. \n\n### But isn’t everything “Consumer”\n\nThe first decade of crypto was about finding our footing. We saw the highs and lows of an emerging asset class and a (still developing) smart contract ecosystem.\n\nWe still have a long way to go when it comes to scaling, infrastructure, and user experiences. But, I’m certain that we’re reached a point where narratives and stories will allow us to scale. \n\nUntil we shift away from our past shadows, it’ll be challenging to resonate with what’s to come. What’s better than telling? Showing. \n\nOver the next decade, we’ll start to see bottoms-up brands, business model reinvention, and community ownership take off. The consumer category in cry\\\\pto will create opportunities we haven’t even thought of yet. \n\nThe old rules do not apply and I’m excited to be a part of the new playbook. To make this more real, here are 5 breakout categories I’m watching: \n\n \\n **1 | Curation-as-a-Service**\n\nThe internet made it so we are all consumers, creators and curators. As we are constantly reminded in our online lives - we are the product. Curation implies taste, and requires effort and skill to do so correctly. But that being said, we are all curators. We curate with our likes. We curate with our comments. We also curate via promotion. Sharing within our network and beyond. While the internet has created a business model around affiliate programs and links, ultimately, the curation space remains relatively [untapped.](https://gaby.mirror.xyz/LGrzJJbwV9ewhYAa7gcFYa2nxYlTWRH-SxmSuViEWA4)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/555afede-69d8-442f-9809-d5559abc8d2d.png?height=1332&width=2152)\n\nWeb3 offers an opportunity to curate with clear financial incentives *and* social status. What once took place across blogs and newsletters will soon find ways to curate where you can tip creators, earn money via curation, and create massive economic graphs. For example, Yup, is a curation protocol that provides an opportunity for users to curate and build their influence accordingly. Collector DAOs are curating NFT investments and making a bet on the future success of these projects. Curation-focused products allow digital content to become organized irrespective of the platform it lives on. Social token design can create a system where users earn for curating content and split the benefits with both the curators and creators. Being early has always had value, but web3 allows you to benefit from it.  \\n ** \\n Notable projects: [Yup](http://yup.io), [Bitclout](https://bitclout.com/), [Verse](https://neuroswish.mirror.xyz/2IlOa5B-eMCuSMTGjYq4lsdPRzOwqqIqy9XzHycsmrY)** \\n \n\n**2 | Social DAOs**\n\nSocial DAOs are [tokens backed by the reputation of an individual, brand, or community.](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-bull-case-for-social-tokens) These DAOs typically have the following structure: a shared mission or purpose, a strong community, and tokenized ownership. Web3, and more specifically tokenized incentives, allow for social communities to quantify their value and share in the upside. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8bfde67-be38-4c64-9b40-33a1817c1c34.png?height=1370&width=2878)\n\nToday, there are a few dozens of social token DAOs, with FWB taking center stage as the leading player. FWB, Friends with Benefits, provides a window into some of the coolest creators and thinkers in Web3. Together they’ve created a digital space that fosters conversation and translates that into digital and IRL events, editorial content and more. Infrastructure providers like Rally and Coinvise are providing the tools to allow these social token communities to thrive, with token infrastructure as well as creator support. It’s still early days for social token DAOs but I’m bullish this category will grow extensively in the coming decades. \\n ** \\n Notable projects: [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/), [Coinvise](https://www.coinvise.co/), [Rally](https://rally.io/)** \\n \n\n**3 | Play-to-Earn Games**\n\nPlay-to-earn games are the newest gaming business model to take the spotlight. Although the model has been for decades, blockchain applications are unlocking ways to earn and own in-game assets. Virtual in-game assets are plentiful but are confined to a one-way economy, where game publishers create and users buy. Despite spending millions on virtual assets, users ultimately have no ownership rights over these assets. With the play-to-earn category, users are working within games to earn in-game assets in the form of NFTs, tokens or otherwise. As more people play the game, the collective value increases while benefiting users. This introduces digital property rights, two-way markets, and in-game scarcity. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c314e7dc-605b-44d0-be25-4c1bf31071a0.png?height=576&width=1024)\n\nAxie Infinity is the most popular play-to-earn game in the blockchain world, with nearly [$500M](https://www.tokenterminal.com/) in protocol revenue generated to date. Yield Guild Games, is an organization of players, who all play games where they can earn in-game currency or assets. Play-to-earn games allow users to participate in the upside while growing the games they enjoy playing.  \\n ** \\n Notable projects: [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [YGG](https://yieldguild.io/)**\n\n**4 | Digital Spaces & Showcases**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c34387ee-1761-4b15-a651-d07a8e561acc.png?height=668&width=1352)\n\nNFTs are a tool. They allow users to tell a story, share context, collaborate, raise funding and more. As NFTs become increasingly popular, the next question arises - where do we put them? As the concept of the metaverse takes off, I’m interested in digital spaces and showcases where users can share their NFTs, socialize with others and build deeper connections. Whether it is about incorporating virtual reality (like CryptoVoxels), developing museum style exhibits (JPG Gallery) or combining the physical and digital (CryptoVenetians) there are significant opportunities to explore.  \n\nNotable projects: **[CryptoVoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/), [Super Rare Spaces](https://twitter.com/SuperRare/status/1430199846464536577), [CryptoVenetians](https://www.cryptovenetians.com/), [Gallery](https://gallery.so/), [JPG](https://jpg.space/)**\n\n**5 | Bottoms Up Brands**\n\nI’m fascinated by the concept of bottoms up brands. I define bottoms up brands as community driven, mission-oriented brands with distributed IP. This could be a particular type of PFP and the IP around it, products like PartyDAO or entertainment like Crypto Punk Comics. We’re in a world where communities are crowdsourcing product roadmaps, DAOs are spinning up to support a particular project and IP is becoming decentralized. Bored Apes Yacht Club, has done over $500M in GMV, and $100M + in revenue in a short four months. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef54fec0-9232-438d-9ac4-8e8ad8a5d2b1.png?height=411&width=601)\n\nLoot project, is another great example, of IP that starts in the hands of the community who then build games, avatars, media around the original IP that was distributed. Rather than having a team or a top-down vision, it’s entirely driven by the community of lootbag holders and supporters. \n\nThe success of a bottoms-up brand starts and ends with the community that supports it. Communities come together to make a particular product recognizable and known for something. \n\nNotable projects: **[PartyDAO](https://twitter.com/prtydao?lang=en), [Bored Apes Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/), [Loot](https://lootproject.com)**\n\nAs John discussed, Web3 changes the[ internet’s logic.](https://j.mirror.xyz/) In doing so, its turns users into owners, with an inventory of tokens, NFTs, communities that represent their online presence. Consumer brands will emerge from this landscape in new ways, economic graphs will be explored, and ultimately, participation will drive consumer adoption. These are simply a few examples of what the future will look like, but I imagine we’ve only scratched the surface. \n\nIf you’re building at the intersection of crypto x consumer, please [reach out!](https://twitter.com/_kinjalbshah?lang=en)\n\n*Many thanks to Cooper Turley and Brian Flynn for their feedback.*  \\n  \\n  \\n ", "timestamp": 1630520316, "digest": "UpJ_v1fDH_gwNcC3ebSB3rXn544G77MlbbV5rJJF-u8", "contributor": "0xA5E1C37Ad90BAAcb791Cfa18506224D7c50f1619"}

The past five years of crypto were heavily focused on financial infrastructure and technological foundations.\n\nBut we’ve now experienced early product-market fit in DeFi, an explosion of projects like NBA Topshot, Axie Infinity, Cryptopunks and onboarded the first [\\~100M users](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/3rd-global-cryptoasset-benchmarking-study/) to crypto. \\*\\*\\*The next 100M crypto users will be driven by consumer applications. \\*\\*\\*\n\nTraditional consumer has gone through a transformation in the past thirty years. Consumer was about the physical -  food, beverages, media and entertainment. But eventually, the internet offered a digital business model for everything physical. Consumers now access virtually any product or service with a few clicks. Consumer brands have vastly expanded their distribution and business economics due to the internet.\n\nSo what will define the next consumer transformation? Crypto. There are 3 major reasons why crypto is poised to do this:\n\n**Ownership**\n\nCrypto enables ownership from day one-- a powerful concept. For the first time, users can partake in the growth and success of the products and communities they are a part of, from the beginning. Ownership changes the model from extractive to additive. The main mechanism for ownership has been via tokens - whether they are fungible or non-fungible. Tokens offer users the ability to partake in governance, access user benefits, and more. Tokens turn users into advocates. Each additional user in a given network benefits alongside the entire network. Rather than providing content, time, attention for free, they are rewarded for making products and services successful.\n\n**24/7 Markets**\n\nSecond, is the nature of crypto markets. Crypto never sleeps. Similar to how the internet trained millions of users to fast instant community, 2-day delivery, and simple UX, crypto will train users to expect 24/7 markets. The past decade has seen exchanges like Coinbase and Binance grow a user base that’s come to expect 24/7 global markets. DeFi is accessible to anyone with an internet connection. We’re now taking this to the next level by making the internet ownable. Marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.com) provide exposure to non-fungible tokens at any time of day. Consumers are shifting expectations to meet this cadence.\n\n**Open Access**\n\nLastly, a defining pillar for crypto is around open global access. The internet turned e-commerce, advertising, and media into global all-consuming models. Advertisers are able to personalize and target users while social media launched the influencer career model. However, the beneficiaries of the internet continue to be limited to a smaller set of stakeholders. Geographical constraints will continue to fall away, giving users opportunities to work and play online in manners that weren’t previously available. The focus is now on the long tail of creators and communities.\n\n### But isn’t everything “Consumer”\n\nThe first decade of crypto was about finding our footing. We saw the highs and lows of an emerging asset class and a (still developing) smart contract ecosystem.\n\nWe still have a long way to go when it comes to scaling, infrastructure, and user experiences. But, I’m certain that we’re reached a point where narratives and stories will allow us to scale.\n\nUntil we shift away from our past shadows, it’ll be challenging to resonate with what’s to come. What’s better than telling? Showing.\n\nOver the next decade, we’ll start to see bottoms-up brands, business model reinvention, and community ownership take off. The consumer category in cry\\\\pto will create opportunities we haven’t even thought of yet.\n\nThe old rules do not apply and I’m excited to be a part of the new playbook. To make this more real, here are 5 breakout categories I’m watching:\n\n**1 | Curation-as-a-Service**\n\nThe internet made it so we are all consumers, creators and curators. As we are constantly reminded in our online lives - we are the product. Curation implies taste, and requires effort and skill to do so correctly. But that being said, we are all curators. We curate with our likes. We curate with our comments. We also curate via promotion. Sharing within our network and beyond. While the internet has created a business model around affiliate programs and links, ultimately, the curation space remains relatively [untapped.](https://gaby.mirror.xyz/LGrzJJbwV9ewhYAa7gcFYa2nxYlTWRH-SxmSuViEWA4)\n\n![Yup ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/555afede-69d8-442f-9809-d5559abc8d2d.png?height=1332&width=2152)\n\nWeb3 offers an opportunity to curate with clear financial incentives *and* social status. What once took place across blogs and newsletters will soon find ways to curate where you can tip creators, earn money via curation, and create massive economic graphs. For example, Yup, is a curation protocol that provides an opportunity for users to curate and build their influence accordingly. Collector DAOs are curating NFT investments and making a bet on the future success of these projects. Curation-focused products allow digital content to become organized irrespective of the platform it lives on. Social token design can create a system where users earn for curating content and split the benefits with both the curators and creators. Being early has always had value, but web3 allows you to benefit from it.\n\nNotable projects: [Yup](http://yup.io), [Bitclout](https://bitclout.com/), [Verse](https://neuroswish.mirror.xyz/2IlOa5B-eMCuSMTGjYq4lsdPRzOwqqIqy9XzHycsmrY)\n\n**2 | Social DAOs**\n\nSocial DAOs are [tokens backed by the reputation of an individual, brand, or community.](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-bull-case-for-social-tokens) These DAOs typically have the following structure: a shared mission or purpose, a strong community, and tokenized ownership. Web3, and more specifically tokenized incentives, allow for social communities to quantify their value and share in the upside.\n\n![FWB Dashboard](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8bfde67-be38-4c64-9b40-33a1817c1c34.png?height=1370&width=2878)\n\nToday, there are a few dozens of social token DAOs, with FWB taking center stage as the leading player. FWB, Friends with Benefits, provides a window into some of the coolest creators and thinkers in Web3. Together they’ve created a digital space that fosters conversation and translates that into digital and IRL events, editorial content and more. Infrastructure providers like Rally and Coinvise are providing the tools to allow these social token communities to thrive, with token infrastructure as well as creator support. It’s still early days for social token DAOs but I’m bullish this category will grow extensively in the coming decades.\n\nNotable projects: [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/), [Coinvise](https://www.coinvise.co/), [Rally](https://rally.io/)\n\n**3 | Play-to-Earn Games**\n\nPlay-to-earn games are the newest gaming business model to take the spotlight. Although the model has been for decades, blockchain applications are unlocking ways to earn and own in-game assets. Virtual in-game assets are plentiful but are confined to a one-way economy, where game publishers create and users buy. Despite spending millions on virtual assets, users ultimately have no ownership rights over these assets. With the play-to-earn category, users are working within games to earn in-game assets in the form of NFTs, tokens or otherwise. As more people play the game, the collective value increases while benefiting users. This introduces digital property rights, two-way markets, and in-game scarcity.\n\n![Axie Infinity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c314e7dc-605b-44d0-be25-4c1bf31071a0.png?height=576&width=1024)\n\nAxie Infinity is the most popular play-to-earn game in the blockchain world, with nearly [$500M](https://www.tokenterminal.com/) in protocol revenue generated to date. Yield Guild Games, is an organization of players, who all play games where they can earn in-game currency or assets. Play-to-earn games allow users to participate in the upside while growing the games they enjoy playing.\n\nNotable projects: [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [YGG](https://yieldguild.io/)\n\n**4 | Digital Spaces & Showcases**\n\n![JPG Gallery](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c34387ee-1761-4b15-a651-d07a8e561acc.png?height=668&width=1352)\n\nNFTs are a tool. They allow users to tell a story, share context, collaborate, raise funding and more. As NFTs become increasingly popular, the next question arises - where do we put them? As the concept of the metaverse takes off, I’m interested in digital spaces and showcases where users can share their NFTs, socialize with others and build deeper connections. Whether it is about incorporating virtual reality (like CryptoVoxels), developing museum style exhibits (JPG Gallery) or combining the physical and digital (CryptoVenetians) there are significant opportunities to explore.\n\nNotable projects: **[CryptoVoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/), [Super Rare Spaces](https://twitter.com/SuperRare/status/1430199846464536577), [CryptoVenetians](https://www.cryptovenetians.com/), [Gallery](https://gallery.so/), [JPG](https://jpg.space/)**\n\n**5 | Bottoms Up Brands**\n\nI’m fascinated by the concept of bottoms up brands. I define bottoms up brands as community driven, mission-oriented brands with distributed IP. This could be a particular type of PFP and the IP around it, products like PartyDAO or entertainment like Crypto Punk Comics. We’re in a world where communities are crowdsourcing product roadmaps, DAOs are spinning up to support a particular project and IP is becoming decentralized. Bored Apes Yacht Club, has done over $500M in GMV, and $100M + in revenue in a short four months.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef54fec0-9232-438d-9ac4-8e8ad8a5d2b1.png?height=411&width=601)\n\nLoot project, is another great example, of IP that starts in the hands of the community who then build games, avatars, media around the original IP that was distributed. Rather than having a team or a top-down vision, it’s entirely driven by the community of lootbag holders and supporters.\n\nThe success of a bottoms-up brand starts and ends with the community that supports it. Communities come together to make a particular product recognizable and known for something.\n\nNotable projects: **[PartyDAO](https://twitter.com/prtydao?lang=en), [Bored Apes Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/), [Loot](https://lootproject.com)**\n\nAs John discussed, Web3 changes the[ internet’s logic.](https://j.mirror.xyz/) In doing so, its turns users into owners, with an inventory of tokens, NFTs, communities that represent their online presence. Consumer brands will emerge from this landscape in new ways, economic graphs will be explored, and ultimately, participation will drive consumer adoption.

{"id": "8eUTqeFVJHo-XCXcy8bxxj99xzkxsflAm-nM9FNuMXM", "title": "Community DAOs", "body": "In crypto land, 2020 was all about DeFi. So far, 2021 has been about NFTs (hot [jpeg summer](https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/summer.jpg-26722) anyone?)\n\nI’m pretty sure 2022 will be all about Community DAOs.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1430694594753097728](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1430694594753097728)\n\n*Community DAOs = DeFi infrastructure + NFT business models + Creative Humans*\n\nCrypto isn’t just a technology, it’s an [internet-native economy](https://p.mirror.xyz/1EpvJwUpx_KlRcHOKLNqADEkwHL_Z1ZYKobF2uLwgBg). Revenue is tracked in ETH. Key decisions are made with community governance. Transactions are enforced on-chain through smart contracts. Treasuries are controlled via multi-sigs. And value is captured with tokens.\n\nDAOs are the native corporate structure of these crypto economies.\n\nInstead of being incorporated in Delaware or the Cayman Islands, DAOs are incorporated in Discord servers and blockchains. DAOs provide an internet-native way of pooling capital, making collective decisions, and capturing value.\n\nThese days, it seems like there’s a DAO for pretty much everything. [Collecting NFTs](https://flamingodao.xyz/collection). [Socializing](https://www.fwb.help/). [Building software](https://twitter.com/prtyDAO). [E sports](https://twitter.com/blvkhvnd). [Musicians](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc). [Media](https://twitter.com/forefront__). [Education](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq). [Funding public goods](https://twitter.com/gitcoin).\n\nBut what makes a “DAO” a *DAO?*\n\n[https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1432728441481318410](https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1432728441481318410)\n\nAlthough the purpose, scale, and sophistication of DAOs can vary, most include the same core components:\n\n* **Group chat.** Usually starts off with someone saying “wouldn’t it be cool if…” and then adding a few frens to a Telegram group or Discord server.\n* **Treasury.** The most common type of Community DAO collects blue-chip NFTs and stores them in a multi-sig. As we’ve seen with [Party Bid](https://www.partybid.app/), people love aping into NFTs with their frens. It’s an experience. Community DAOs can also bootstrap their treasury through a [tokenized crowdfund](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc). This enables the DAO to fill their treasury with ETH to spend on operations and growth.\n* **ERC-20 Token.** As word gets out about how much fun your Community DAO is having, people start blowing up your DM’s begging you to let them in. At this point, many Community DAOs issue an ERC-20 token as a way to gate membership. Depending on the exclusivity of the Community DAO, membership can cost anywhere from a few dollars worth of ETH to a few mil.\n* **Governance.** Community DAOs with valuable treasuries and hundreds of members need a way to make collective decisions. Usually, rough consensus is reached in the group chat (with emojis, ofc) and the governance vote is just a formality. But it’s fun to see who voted, how much voting power they have, and what they voted for. Also, most Community DAOs empower small, focused teams of 5 to 10 members to own specific workstreams instead of requiring a governance proposal for every smol decision.\n* **On-chain cash flow**. This is the most nascent component of Community DAOs but also the most interesting. On-chain cash flow turns a fun group chat with your frens into a sustainable business. So far, the most common way to generate on-chain cash flow has been through NFT drops.\n\nSo, are these Community DAOs *actually* working?\n\nOver the past few months, DAOs like [Fingerprints](https://fingerprintsdao.gitbook.io/fingerprints-dao/) and [Flamingo](https://twitter.com/FLAMINGODAO) have amassed five and six figure NFT collections.\n\n[https://twitter.com/awrigh01/status/1431778270727610371](https://twitter.com/awrigh01/status/1431778270727610371)\n\nDAOs like [Bright Moments](https://twitter.com/brtmoments) have sold millions worth of NFTs in minutes.\n\n[https://twitter.com/cryptovenetians/status/1427703534561206273](https://twitter.com/cryptovenetians/status/1427703534561206273)\n\n[Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), [Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq), [Forefront](https://twitter.com/forefront__), and [FWB](https://twitter.com/FWBtweets) are becoming the premier on-ramps for the next wave of active contributors in crypto.\n\n[https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1422577245671936000](https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1422577245671936000)\n\nSome DAOs like [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf/) just leave you thinking WTF.\n\n[https://twitter.com/yossihasson/status/1430815200354111488?s=20](https://twitter.com/yossihasson/status/1430815200354111488?s=20)\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject)…\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072)\n\nMultiple [top](https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/08/bright-moments-dao/) [tier](https://www.mechanism.capital/pleasrdao-thesis/) [VC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16zjMXGJwQ0s99kXLA7jW2UNNQcYQVdB9AjqaVb2s97M/edit) [funds](https://club.mirror.xyz/a5PQAwU0CuHJ90lEOmzq545nlC4qqNoTVTeHEGRrqow) have invested in these DAOs and I think they’ll end up becoming some of the best performers in their portfolios over the next decade.\n\nIn the rest of this post, we’ll take a closer look at Community DAOs - how they can become sustainable businesses, what the risks are, and what they may look like in the future.\n\n# Growing Community DAOs\n\nUnlike traditional startups, the *initial* purpose of most Community DAOs isn’t to maximize shareholder value. Instead, many Community DAOs start off just being about the vibes.\n\n![thanks drizzy for the quick vibe check](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3c93cf33-7d15-44bd-b977-8d9d0b13a961.jpeg?height=500&width=625)\n\nBut given the growth of the broader crypto market, many of these Community DAOs are finding themselves sitting on [treasuries worth millions](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) and ERC-20 tokens with [$100M+](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/friends-with-benefits-pro/) market caps. In just the past few months, they’ve gone from group chats to real businesses.\n\nOne of the keys to growing these Community DAOs will be recurring on-chain cash flow. There’s other important factors like community engagement, governance, tokenomics, etc. but generating on-chain cash flow gives Community DAOs capital to reward contributors, hire full time staff, and grow their treasury.\n\nBack in college, I studied Finance and one of the most boring things we learned was how to analyze a balance sheet. Turns out, it’s actually kinda useful.\n\nThere’s two types of assets on a Community DAO’s balance sheet:\n\n1. **Equity** (Blue-chip NFTs, Community DAO tokens, Crypto protocol tokens)\n2. **Cash** (ETH, USDC, DAI)\\*\n\n*\\*Technically ETH could be considered equity in the Ethereum network but for simplicity, let’s classify ETH as cash on the balance sheet since it’s the primary medium of exchange for DAOs*\n\nSo what can Community DAOs do with the cash and equity on their balance sheets? For many, crypto feels like a massively multiplayer [online game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game).\n\n[https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1432117673467416580](https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1432117673467416580)\n\nFor Community DAOs, the game is to increase the value of the treasury while maintaining the strong vibes that got the community going in the first place.\n\n[https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1427454307339706389](https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1427454307339706389)\n\nThere’s a few ways Community DAOs can put themselves in a position to win this game:\n\n* Collect blue-chip NFTs\n* Earn membership fees\n* Release NFT drops\n* Launch a tokenized NFT gallery\n* Build a media company\n* Sell SaaS tools\n* Invest in tokens (in DeFi protocols, NFT protocols, and other DAOs)\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each.\n\n***Collecting Blue-Chip NFTs***\n\nThis is the most common way Community DAOs get started.\n\nA group of frens want to collect blue-chips like [Punks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), [Autoglyphs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs), [DEAFBEEF](https://www.deafbeef.com/), [Fidenzas](https://tylerxhobbs.com/fidenza), [Ringers](https://artblocks.io/project/13), etc. but don’t want to put all the capital up themselves. Instead, they pool their funds to purchase a portfolio of blue-chips.\n\nHowever, in practice, storing blue-chips in a vault is *illiquid.* It doesn’t directly generate revenue. As a result, some of these DAOs issue ERC-20 tokens as a way to let people speculate on the value of the underlying NFTs, earn trading fees, and decide when to sell. [PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO), one of the largest NFT Collector DAOs, [recently announced](https://pleasr.mirror.xyz/7hpdJOWRzQx2pmCA16MDxN2FiA3eY6dwcrnEtXKnCJw) a similar liquidity strategy for their 1 of 1 Doge NFT.\n\n[https://twitter.com/business/status/1432723721521876998](https://twitter.com/business/status/1432723721521876998)\n\nThis kinda ends up being like storing gold in a vault and issuing paper certificates against it ([sound familiar?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard)). You can redeem your paper certificate for the underlying asset but you need to trust that the asset will be available and worth something when you want to redeem. But instead of gold and paper certificates we have blue-chip NFTs and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nTo be fair, some of these vaults are *extremely* valuable and have a damn good chance of being worth billions some day. So maybe instead of being like storing gold in a vault, maybe it’s more like owning equity in [iconic](https://very.auction/doge/doge) [internet](https://foundation.app/@NyanCat/nyan-cat-219) [culture](https://foundation.app/@DisasterGirl/disaster-girl-25046) and some of the most [valuable IP](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/) in the world. But the reality is that in the near term, these vaults alone don’t generate recurring on-chain cash flow.\n\nInstead of near-term cash flow, these blue-chip NFTs serve as a focal point (or as crypto people would say: [“schelling point”](https://nav.al/schelling-point)) for top collectors, artists, founders, investors, and operators to get involved in the community.\n\nAs we’ll see in the next few sections, the most valuable aspect of these vaults stuffed with blue-chip NFTs is that *they attract human capital* that converts illiquid jpegs into cash on the balance sheet.\n\n***Membership Fees***\n\n[https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera/status/1427330975227330565](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera/status/1427330975227330565)\n\nIdk about you, but the terms “follower” and “subscriber” feel weird to me. They imply a unilateral relationship. *I* follow *you*. *You* subscribe to *me*.\n\nBut the terms “member” and “owner” hit different.\n\n*We* are *members*.\n\n*We* are *owners*.\n\nIn web3, membership and ownership are encapsulated in ERC-20 tokens. Balances are stored on the blockchain. And your assets are controlled by your private key.\n\nIf the vibes are off in the community or you need liquidity after getting rekt by yet another degenerate yield farm, you can sell your tokens on an [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) or head over to the #otc channel in Discord to negotiate a fair rate. No questions asked.\n\nBut as the Community DAO increases the value of the treasury and demand for membership increases, the value of the underlying membership token increases.\n\nIf you were an early member of the community or earned a large allocation through your contributions, this can turn into meaningful wealth.\n\n![Membership in $FWB went from being worth $1,000 to $12,000 over the past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b906bb8e-f5f7-4fcb-971c-744a35cd59de.jpg?height=2138&width=1169)\n\nHowever, membership tokens aren’t just about “nUmBeR gO uP”. At a deeper level, the token is a coordination mechanism to help online communities *create*, *capture*, and *redistribute* value.\n\nAnd because token holders are also community members, they don’t need to fire up an Excel spreadsheet and make resource allocation decisions based on DCF analyses. Unless they want to.\n\nInstead, Community DAOs invest in whatever they want. Sometimes that’s [donating to charities](https://nouns.wtf/vote/1). Other times that’s [popping bottles in Paris](https://gallery.fwb.help/fwb-paris).\n\n***NFT drops***\n\nThis is the most common way Community DAOs generate on-chain cash flow. Some of these drops post serious numbers. This past weekend, Bored Ape Yacht Club sold $92M worth of [Mutant Ape NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/mutant-ape-yacht-club) in one hour.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Dogetoshi/status/1431792801751183363](https://twitter.com/Dogetoshi/status/1431792801751183363)\n\n[https://twitter.com/richerd/status/1431999591176572934](https://twitter.com/richerd/status/1431999591176572934)\n\nAnother one of my favorite drops recently was a collab between [Arihz](https://twitter.com/framergence) (an anonymous Brazilian computer scientist / NFT artist) and [FingerprintsDAO](https://twitter.com/FingerprintsDAO) (one of the leading collector DAOs for smart contracts as art). The drop was called [Avid Lines](https://avidlines.art/) and in the first 30 days, it’s done almost $10M in trading volume.\n\n[https://twitter.com/AvidLines/status/1430215479277146113](https://twitter.com/AvidLines/status/1430215479277146113)\n\nMore importantly, the drop was a great example of how to remix NFT IP in a fun and interesting way. It was a derivative of [Autoglyphs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs), which is the most valuable collection in the FingerprintsDAO treasury.\n\nHere’s how it worked:\n\n* Minters chose an Autoglyph to use as the base input for the generative algorithm\n* Autoglyph holders could whitelist their Autoglyphs to receive 10% of primary sales for mints that used their Autoglyph as the base input\n* The generative algorithm combined the base Autoglyph input with Arihz’s randomization code and the output was a remix called Avid Lines (and they’re fvcking beautiful)\n\n[https://twitter.com/dgntec/status/1417936546079072256](https://twitter.com/dgntec/status/1417936546079072256)\n\nSome of the most popular NFT drops are derivative projects that take blue-chip NFT IP and remix them in a way that’s fun, game-like, and visually appealing. These derivative projects are interesting because *they take illiquid jpegs* stored in a vault and *turn them into productive assets*. Some Autoglyph holders earned $40k worth of ETH by simply calling a whitelist function on a smart contract.\n\nAs DAOs look for new ways to increase the value of the NFTs in their treasury, we’ll continue seeing more derivative drops like these that enhance the value of the core IP while also turning NFTs into productive assets.\n\n***Tokenized NFT Gallery***\n\nMost Community DAOs don’t have their own tokenized NFT gallery yet. But in the near future I think it’ll become one of the most popular ways for Community DAOs to generate on-chain cash flow.\n\n[https://twitter.com/andy8052/status/1430715288622936066](https://twitter.com/andy8052/status/1430715288622936066)\n\nThe basic idea is:\n\n* Members use the Community DAO token to vote on which artists / drops can mint on their site\n* Multiple drop mechanisms are supported (reserve auctions, dutch auctions, editions, raffles, airdrops, generative, etc.) by letting devs register smart contracts with the DAO’s NFT gallery registry\n* Revenue from primary and secondary sales is shared between the artist, dev team, and DAO treasury\n* Artists, collectors, dev teams, and other contributors receive Community DAO tokens\n* Token holders get access to members-only features like exclusive drops, NFT badges, discounts, physical prints, merch, and more\n\nThis allows Community DAOs to build their own NFT marketplaces while rewarding token holders, artists, collectors, and devs with a mix of cash and equity. The curation abilities of top Community DAOs will eventually turn these NFT galleries into incubators for emerging artists.\n\nFor example, if you’re a generative artist and FingerprintsDAO votes you in to the their gallery, it’s basically like being a fashion designer and getting your latest clothing line in Vogue. This creates a reflexive feedback loop where the top Community DAOs build status by curating high-quality NFT collections and then help the next generation of artists get distribution while earning fees.\n\nIt’s kinda like [CAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency) or a [record label](https://jarroddicker.medium.com/?p=e14b695c43b) for internet culture.\n\n***Owned Media***\n\nBuilding media properties isn’t as sexy as a tokenized NFT gallery, but they work. Start a podcast and / or newsletter, find some sponsors, and boom. There ya go.\n\nThe top Community DAOs should have a pretty easy time finding sponsors given their community is filled with progressive individuals with cash to spend on random stuff like digital pet rocks.\n\n[https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/1431242146309238791](https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/1431242146309238791)\n\n[Club Top Shot](https://twitter.com/clubtopshot) is one of my favorite examples of a media company being built around an NFT collection.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ClubTopShot/status/1430519333613096964](https://twitter.com/ClubTopShot/status/1430519333613096964)\n\n[UTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Talent_Agency), one of the premier Hollywood talent agencies, [recently signed](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/) Larva Labs (creator of CryptoPunks, Autoglyphs, and Meebits) and will represent them across film, TV, video games, publishing, and licensing. Imagine Kevin Hart being the voiceover for a CryptoPunk or Meebit in a Netflix show lmfao. I’d watch that in a heartbeat.\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1432764961227481089](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1432764961227481089)\n\n***SaaS Tools***\n\nMost Community DAOs go through the following cycle pretty much every week:\n\n* A problem surfaces that needs to be solved\n* Somebody does research on the existing tools\n* Turns out none of the tools do exactly what the community needs\n* *\\*Ugh\\**\n\nFWB is one of the most active DAOs in building custom tooling for their community. When they needed a way to token-gate IRL events, [they built it](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/XU5_RYsow8fDbbckryr2snNyfrMV8HTJ0N39Cjkfy3s). When they needed a dashboard to highlight key information about the community, [they built it](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/KhvEi3kHy6rBJX9Lm4DI-iMkbzebEyNdM05uAB_StGY) (and it’s [vibey af](https://www.fwb.help/pulse)).\n\nOthers DAOs like Yearn built a [decentralized payroll management tool](https://medium.com/iearn/decentralized-payroll-management-for-daos-b2252160c543) because they wanted a more meritocratic way of rewarding contributors.\n\nAs Community DAOs become aggregators for top talent in crypto, we’ll see more custom tooling built to serve the broader community. And similar to how YC startups usually get initial distribution from other startups in their batch, Community DAOs will get their initial distribution from the other DAOs and projects their community is involved with.\n\n***Tokens (DeFi protocols, NFT protocols, and other DAOs)***\n\nIt’s been interesting to see DAOs align incentives by investing in each other. A few months ago FWB and WHALE did a [token swap](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmWnifY3KD5ECJNtQ23m9GHt2oQ1McA3T4DEEpFarPy9jW) where the stake in $FWB was valued at $100k. Today, that stake is worth $1.5M.\n\nGiven the amount of human capital inside these DAOs, most crypto protocols will probably have a few DAOs on their cap table as strategic investors helping with distribution, connections, and domain expertise. As the crypto market grows, these DAO-to-DAO stakes could end up being very, very large. These stakes will also create a new type of mutual alignment at a level we haven’t seen before in the competitive world of business.\n\n# Risks\n\nLike any investable asset, Community DAOs live along a risk-reward spectrum.\n\nSome of the main risks of Community DAOs include:\n\n* **Bad OpSec.** A DAO’s assets (NFTs, ETH, and ERC-20s) are stored in a smart contract that lives on the blockchain. Usually, the contract is a multi-sig wallet controlled by a trusted group of community members. To withdraw assets, a threshold needs to be reached where multiple people sign a transaction with their crypto wallet to authorize it. This prevents one of the signers from going rogue and rugging the community. Or in case one signer loses access to their private key, there should be enough redundancy in the system that transactions can still be signed and submitted. Ideally, we remove the need for any trusted parties and integrate governance with trustless transaction execution through something like [SafeSnap](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f). But in practice, most communities will require some level of trust in a select group of community members to ensure assets are stored and managed securely.\n* **Potential ETH / NFT crash.** Are NFTs in a bubble? Probably. The recent run up in prices mimics the boom and bust nature of [most technology cycles](http://lao8n.com/blog/2015/12/3/carlota-perez-technology-revolutions-financial-capital). If ETH prices crash, Community DAOs will have less cash on the balance sheet and will need to mark down the book value of their NFT assets. It’s a real risk. Many DAOs implement treasury diversification strategies with the help of domain experts like [Llama](https://www.llama.xyz/) to ensure they’re able to weather a bear market. DAOs can convert ETH to stables like USDC or DAI to protect against ETH volatility. The best DAOs will have recurring on-chain cash flow and efficient cost structures that enable them to weather a bear market.\n* **Lack of community engagement.** People are the heartbeat of any community. DAO or otherwise. The best Community DAOs have a mission that goes much deeper than “nUmBeR gO uP”. Collective action towards this mission is what keeps the core contributors and active community members coming back every day. But when people get distracted by token prices, or the core team loses interest, culture deteriorates. The magic of these Community DAOs are the people. The Discord mods that stay up all night answering questions. The volunteers that write documentation to help new members. A lot of the most valuable work in communities goes unnoticed and unrewarded. Community members need [intrinsic motivation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5364176/) to drive the community forward. Otherwise, the community will slowly devolve into just another inactive group chat.\n* **Poorly designed tokenomics.** The two biggest risks with tokenomics are: 1) the core team not having a large enough stake to keep them incentivized and 2) adversarial whales accumulating too many tokens and using them to manipulate the network through governance and / or negative price action. We’re still in the early stages of understanding best practices for Community DAO tokenomics. Many communities bring on experts like [Fire Eyez](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao), [Delphi Digital](https://twitter.com/Delphi_Digital), and [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/GauntletNetwork) to help develop a robust token strategy.\n\n# Future of Community DAOs\n\nHere’s a few predictions on the future of Community DAOs:\n\n* **There will be many billion dollar Community DAOs.** This probably isn’t controversial amongst crypto-natives but if you take a moment to think about it, it’s pretty wild. Online communities live across Discord servers, Telegram chats, Twitter DM’s, FB groups, Patreon, etc. A DAO structure gives these online communities the ability to coordinate capital, make collective decisions, and capture value with an internet-native currency. The canonical example of a community that could’ve used this functionality is [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) during the [GME short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze). Aside from just investing, I think there will be billion dollar community DAOs across gaming, publishing, music, education, art, software development, and more.\n* **Community tokens > Social tokens.** For the past couple years, social tokens were a hot topic when discussing the future of crypto-native consumer apps. The thought went, *“wouldn’t it be cool if you could invest in people the same way you can invest in stocks?”* [Bitclout’s](https://bitclout.com/) initial traction was a sign that there’s demand for this type of product. But social tokens focused on one person can lead to burnout, mental health issues, and regulatory risk. So instead of social tokens focused on individual people, I think *community tokens* focused on the *collective efforts* of groups of people will become the dominant model. Investing in the Mr. Beast token is boring. Being a member in the Mr. Beast community is fun. Social tokens feel like a top-down approach. A creator and their management team retains full control over creative decisions and IP. But as we’re seeing with [BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) and [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject), bottoms-up decentralized communities with the right incentives have the potential to create much more value than a centrally coordinated effort. It reminds of Windows / MacOS vs. Android / Linux. Arguably, the centrally coordinated approach of Windows / MacOS won in the previous era because they were able to bundle a proprietary operating system with other products like the MS Office Suite and the iPhone that had strong business models. Meanwhile, there was no native business model for open source software like Android or Linux. To capture value, Google acquired Android and bundled it into smart phones and SaaS companies like Red Hat bundled Linux into enterprise services. But now ERC-20 tokens and NFTs give open source software a business model. And not just open source software, but also open source IP. To me, social tokens are imply a top-down centrally coordinated effort whereas community tokens imply a bottoms-up decentralized community with full access to the underlying IP. The latter feels much more crypto-native to me.\n* **Service DAOs will play a key role in scaling Community DAOs.** In crypto, there’s a whole new set of specialized skills needed to build a successful project. Things like tokenomics design, treasury management, community management, onboarding, governance, smart contract development, data science, protocol security, OpSec, etc. Because there aren’t many experts in these areas yet, we’re already seeing crypto-native agencies (i.e., “Service DAOs”) that aggregate the best talent for a specialized skill and provide services to other DAOs. There’s [Llama](https://www.llama.xyz/) for treasury management, [Fire Eyez](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao) for tokenomics, and [Vector](https://twitter.com/VectorDAO) for designing crypto apps. Service DAOs combine the flexibility of freelancing with the upside of startups. Most get paid in a combination of ETH and ERC20-tokens so there’s skin-in-the-game and aligned incentives. As these Service DAOs build out their processes, hire more talent, and build software to automate their services, it’ll be much easier for Community DAOs to solve some of their toughest problems and help them scale.\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nCommunity DAOs are the next evolution in online communities. It’s like if subreddits had a shared bank account, a token, and governance mechanisms. They’ll become the [new social networks](https://www.notboring.co/p/status-monkeys). And the best way to learn is by actively contributing.\n\nHere’s what I usually share with friends interested in contributing to Community DAOs:\n\n* Join 3 to 5 Discord servers to get a sense of the different vibes\n* Introduce yourself in the #introductions channel and read the other intros to get an understanding of who’s in the community\n* Find two or three channels that are most relevant to you and check them multiple times a day. Ask questions. Answer questions. Offer encouragement.\n* Read the governance forum to understand what the top priorities are for the community and how they make decisions\n* Attend voice chats to build relationships with the most active contributors\n* Now, after this initial research phase, choose the top one or two Community DAOs you vibe with and *double down* on them\n* Find a committee you can help with and work on a project. As you get more comfortable, take on a leadership role\n* Try to get rewarded with the Community DAO’s token to align incentives and truly become an owner in the community\n* Iterate and repeat\n\nThe DAO maestro himself [Coopahtroopa](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa) recently published [an article](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw) with a bunch of DAOs you can contribute to as well as a list of people to follow.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1432403329422741504](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1432403329422741504)\n\nThe demand for talent in the space far exceeds supply so if you’re at all interested, don’t hesitate to jump in and start contributing.\n\nUntil next time ✌️\n\n\n---\n\n*Thanks for reading and feel free to DM me on Twitter with any questions, comments, or memes [@patrickxrivera](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera).

The past five years of crypto were heavily focused on financial infrastructure and technological foundations.\n\nBut we’ve now experienced early product-market fit in DeFi, an explosion of projects like NBA Topshot, Axie Infinity, Cryptopunks and onboarded the first [\\~100M users](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/3rd-global-cryptoasset-benchmarking-study/) to crypto. \\*\\*\\*The next 100M crypto users will be driven by consumer applications. \\*\\*\\*\n\nTraditional consumer has gone through a transformation in the past thirty years. Consumer was about the physical -  food, beverages, media and entertainment. But eventually, the internet offered a digital business model for everything physical. Consumers now access virtually any product or service with a few clicks. Consumer brands have vastly expanded their distribution and business economics due to the internet.\n\nSo what will define the next consumer transformation? Crypto. There are 3 major reasons why crypto is poised to do this:\n\n\\*\\*Ownership\\*\\*\n\nCrypto enables ownership from day one-- a powerful concept. For the first time, users can partake in the growth and success of the products and communities they are a part of, from the beginning. Ownership changes the model from extractive to additive. The main mechanism for ownership has been via tokens - whether they are fungible or non-fungible. Tokens offer users the ability to partake in governance, access user benefits, and more. Tokens turn users into advocates. Each additional user in a given network benefits alongside the entire network. Rather than providing content, time, attention for free, they are rewarded for making products and services successful.\n\n\\*\\*24/7 Markets\\*\\*\n\nSecond, is the nature of crypto markets. Crypto never sleeps. Similar to how the internet trained millions of users to fast instant community, 2-day delivery, and simple UX, crypto will train users to expect 24/7 markets. The past decade has seen exchanges like Coinbase and Binance grow a user base that’s come to expect 24/7 global markets. DeFi is accessible to anyone with an internet connection. We’re now taking this to the next level by making the internet ownable. Marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.com) provide exposure to non-fungible tokens at any time of day. Consumers are shifting expectations to meet this cadence.\n\n\\*\\*Open Access\\*\\*\n\nLastly, a defining pillar for crypto is around open global access. The internet turned e-commerce, advertising, and media into global all-consuming models. Advertisers are able to personalize and target users while social media launched the influencer career model. However, the beneficiaries of the internet continue to be limited to a smaller set of stakeholders. Geographical constraints will continue to fall away, giving users opportunities to work and play online in manners that weren’t previously available. The focus is now on the long tail of creators and communities.\n\n### But isn’t everything “Consumer”\n\nThe first decade of crypto was about finding our footing. We saw the highs and lows of an emerging asset class and a (still developing) smart contract ecosystem.\n\nWe still have a long way to go when it comes to scaling, infrastructure, and user experiences. But, I’m certain that we’re reached a point where narratives and stories will allow us to scale.\n\nUntil we shift away from our past shadows, it’ll be challenging to resonate with what’s to come. What’s better than telling? Showing.\n\nOver the next decade, we’ll start to see bottoms-up brands, business model reinvention, and community ownership take off. The consumer category in cry\\\\pto will create opportunities we haven’t even thought of yet.\n\nThe old rules do not apply and I’m excited to be a part of the new playbook. To make this more real, here are 5 breakout categories I’m watching:\n\n**1 | Curation-as-a-Service**\n\nThe internet made it so we are all consumers, creators and curators. As we are constantly reminded in our online lives - we are the product. Curation implies taste, and requires effort and skill to do so correctly. But that being said, we are all curators. We curate with our likes. We curate with our comments. We also curate via promotion. Sharing within our network and beyond. While the internet has created a business model around affiliate programs and links, ultimately, the curation space remains relatively [untapped.](https://gaby.mirror.xyz/LGrzJJbwV9ewhYAa7gcFYa2nxYlTWRH-SxmSuViEWA4)\n\n![Yup ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/555afede-69d8-442f-9809-d5559abc8d2d.png?height=1332&width=2152)\n\nWeb3 offers an opportunity to curate with clear financial incentives *and* social status. What once took place across blogs and newsletters will soon find ways to curate where you can tip creators, earn money via curation, and create massive economic graphs. For example, Yup, is a curation protocol that provides an opportunity for users to curate and build their influence accordingly. Collector DAOs are curating NFT investments and making a bet on the future success of these projects. Curation-focused products allow digital content to become organized irrespective of the platform it lives on. Social token design can create a system where users earn for curating content and split the benefits with both the curators and creators. Being early has always had value, but web3 allows you to benefit from it.\n\n\\\\n \\*\\* \\\\n Notable projects: [Yup](http://yup.io), [Bitclout](https://bitclout.com/), [Verse](https://neuroswish.mirror.xyz/2IlOa5B-eMCuSMTGjYq4lsdPRzOwqqIqy9XzHycsmrY)\\*\\* \\\\n\n\n**2 | Social DAOs**\n\nSocial DAOs are [tokens backed by the reputation of an individual, brand, or community.](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-bull-case-for-social-tokens) These DAOs typically have the following structure: a shared mission or purpose, a strong community, and tokenized ownership. Web3, and more specifically tokenized incentives, allow for social communities to quantify their value and share in the upside.\n\n![FWB Dashboard](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8bfde67-be38-4c64-9b40-33a1817c1c34.png?height=1370&width=2878)\n\nToday, there are a few dozens of social token DAOs, with FWB taking center stage as the leading player. FWB, Friends with Benefits, provides a window into some of the coolest creators and thinkers in Web3. Together they’ve created a digital space that fosters conversation and translates that into digital and IRL events, editorial content and more. Infrastructure providers like Rally and Coinvise are providing the tools to allow these social token communities to thrive, with token infrastructure as well as creator support. It’s still early days for social token DAOs but I’m bullish this category will grow extensively in the coming decades.\n\n\\\\n \\*\\* \\\\n Notable projects: [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/), [Coinvise](https://www.coinvise.co/), [Rally](https://rally.io/)\\*\\* \\\\n\n\n**3 | Play-to-Earn Games**\n\nPlay-to-earn games are the newest gaming business model to take the spotlight. Although the model has been for decades, blockchain applications are unlocking ways to earn and own in-game assets. Virtual in-game assets are plentiful but are confined to a one-way economy, where game publishers create and users buy. Despite spending millions on virtual assets, users ultimately have no ownership rights over these assets. With the play-to-earn category, users are working within games to earn in-game assets in the form of NFTs, tokens or otherwise. As more people play the game, the collective value increases while benefiting users. This introduces digital property rights, two-way markets, and in-game scarcity.\n\n![Axie Infinity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c314e7dc-605b-44d0-be25-4c1bf31071a0.png?height=576&width=1024)\n\nAxie Infinity is the most popular play-to-earn game in the blockchain world, with nearly [$500M](https://www.tokenterminal.com/) in protocol revenue generated to date. Yield Guild Games, is an organization of players, who all play games where they can earn in-game currency or assets. Play-to-earn games allow users to participate in the upside while growing the games they enjoy playing.  \\\\n \\*\\* \\\\n Notable projects: [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [YGG](https://yieldguild.io/)\\*\\*\n\n**4 | Digital Spaces & Showcases**\n\n![JPG Gallery](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c34387ee-1761-4b15-a651-d07a8e561acc.png?height=668&width=1352)\n\nNFTs are a tool. They allow users to tell a story, share context, collaborate, raise funding and more. As NFTs become increasingly popular, the next question arises - where do we put them? As the concept of the metaverse takes off, I’m interested in digital spaces and showcases where users can share their NFTs, socialize with others and build deeper connections. Whether it is about incorporating virtual reality (like CryptoVoxels), developing museum style exhibits (JPG Gallery) or combining the physical and digital (CryptoVenetians) there are significant opportunities to explore.\n\nNotable projects: **[CryptoVoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/), [Super Rare Spaces](https://twitter.com/SuperRare/status/1430199846464536577), [CryptoVenetians](https://www.cryptovenetians.com/), [Gallery](https://gallery.so/), [JPG](https://jpg.space/)**\n\n**5 | Bottoms Up Brands**\n\nI’m fascinated by the concept of bottoms up brands. I define bottoms up brands as community driven, mission-oriented brands with distributed IP. This could be a particular type of PFP and the IP around it, products like PartyDAO or entertainment like Crypto Punk Comics. We’re in a world where communities are crowdsourcing product roadmaps, DAOs are spinning up to support a particular project and IP is becoming decentralized. Bored Apes Yacht Club, has done over $500M in GMV, and $100M + in revenue in a short four months.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef54fec0-9232-438d-9ac4-8e8ad8a5d2b1.png?height=411&width=601)\n\nLoot project, is another great example, of IP that starts in the hands of the community who then build games, avatars, media around the original IP that was distributed. Rather than having a team or a top-down vision, it’s entirely driven by the community of lootbag holders and supporters.\n\nThe success of a bottoms-up brand starts and ends with the community that supports it. Communities come together to make a particular product recognizable and known for something.\n\nNotable projects: **[PartyDAO](https://twitter.com/prtydao?lang=en), [Bored Apes Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/), [Loot](https://lootproject.com)**\n\nAs John discussed, Web3 changes the[ internet’s logic.](https://j.mirror.xyz/) In doing so, its turns users into owners, with an inventory of tokens, NFTs, communities that represent their online presence. Consumer brands will emerge from this landscape in new ways, economic graphs will be explored, and ultimately, participation will drive consumer adoption. These are simply a few examples of what the future will look like, but I imagine we’ve only scratched the surface.\n\nIf you’re building at the intersection of crypto x consumer, please [reach out!](https://twitter.com/_kinjalbshah?lang=en)\n\n*Many thanks to Cooper Turley and Brian Flynn for their feedback.*", "timestamp": 1630520511, "digest": "UpJ_v1fDH_gwNcC3ebSB3rXn544G77MlbbV5rJJF-u8", "contributor": "0xA5E1C37Ad90BAAcb791Cfa18506224D7c50f1619"}
{"id": "NBwmnfdvWm6Deg0avqxM04sa5tzSj-3B8xMeKcqjg04", "title": "Community DAOs", "body": "In crypto land, 2020 was all about DeFi. So far, 2021 has been about NFTs (hot [jpeg summer](https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/summer.jpg-26722) anyone?)\n\nI’m pretty sure 2022 will be all about Community DAOs.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1430694594753097728](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1430694594753097728)\n\n*Community DAOs = DeFi infrastructure + NFT business models + Creative Humans*\n\nCrypto isn’t just a technology, it’s an [internet-native economy](https://p.mirror.xyz/1EpvJwUpx_KlRcHOKLNqADEkwHL_Z1ZYKobF2uLwgBg). Revenue is tracked in ETH. Key decisions are made with community governance. Transactions are enforced on-chain through smart contracts. Treasuries are controlled via multi-sigs. And value is captured with tokens.\n\nDAOs are the native corporate structure of these crypto economies.\n\nInstead of being incorporated in Delaware or the Cayman Islands, DAOs are incorporated in Discord servers and blockchains. DAOs provide an internet-native way of pooling capital, making collective decisions, and capturing value.\n\nThese days, it seems like there’s a DAO for pretty much everything. [Collecting NFTs](https://flamingodao.xyz/collection). [Socializing](https://www.fwb.help/). [Building software](https://twitter.com/prtyDAO). [E sports](https://twitter.com/blvkhvnd). [Musicians](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc). [Media](https://twitter.com/forefront__). [Education](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq). [Funding public goods](https://twitter.com/gitcoin).\n\nBut what makes a “DAO” a *DAO?*\n\n[https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1432728441481318410](https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1432728441481318410)\n\nAlthough the purpose, scale, and sophistication of DAOs can vary, most include the same core components:\n\n* **Group chat.** Usually starts off with someone saying “wouldn’t it be cool if…” and then adding a few frens to a Telegram group or Discord server.\n* **Treasury.** The most common type of Community DAO collects blue-chip NFTs and stores them in a multi-sig. As we’ve seen with [Party Bid](https://www.partybid.app/), people love aping into NFTs with their frens. It’s an experience. Community DAOs can also bootstrap their treasury through a [tokenized crowdfund](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc). This enables the DAO to fill their treasury with ETH to spend on operations and growth.\n* **ERC-20 Token.** As word gets out about how much fun your Community DAO is having, people start blowing up your DM’s begging you to let them in. At this point, many Community DAOs issue an ERC-20 token as a way to gate membership. Depending on the exclusivity of the Community DAO, membership can cost anywhere from a few dollars worth of ETH to a few mil.\n* **Governance.** Community DAOs with valuable treasuries and hundreds of members need a way to make collective decisions. Usually, rough consensus is reached in the group chat (with emojis, ofc) and the governance vote is just a formality. But it’s fun to see who voted, how much voting power they have, and what they voted for. Also, most Community DAOs empower small, focused teams of 5 to 10 members to own specific workstreams instead of requiring a governance proposal for every smol decision.\n* **On-chain cash flow**. This is the most nascent component of Community DAOs but also the most interesting. On-chain cash flow turns a fun group chat with your frens into a sustainable business. So far, the most common way to generate on-chain cash flow has been through NFT drops.\n\nSo, are these Community DAOs *actually* working?\n\nOver the past few months, DAOs like [Fingerprints](https://fingerprintsdao.gitbook.io/fingerprints-dao/) and [Flamingo](https://twitter.com/FLAMINGODAO) have amassed five and six figure NFT collections.\n\n[https://twitter.com/awrigh01/status/1431778270727610371](https://twitter.com/awrigh01/status/1431778270727610371)\n\nDAOs like [Bright Moments](https://twitter.com/brtmoments) have sold millions worth of NFTs in minutes.\n\n[https://twitter.com/cryptovenetians/status/1427703534561206273](https://twitter.com/cryptovenetians/status/1427703534561206273)\n\n[Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), [Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq), [Forefront](https://twitter.com/forefront__), and [FWB](https://twitter.com/FWBtweets) are becoming the premier on-ramps for the next wave of active contributors in crypto.\n\n[https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1422577245671936000](https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1422577245671936000)\n\nSome DAOs like [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf/) just leave you thinking WTF.\n\n[https://twitter.com/yossihasson/status/1430815200354111488?s=20](https://twitter.com/yossihasson/status/1430815200354111488?s=20)\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject)…\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072)\n\nMultiple [top](https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/08/bright-moments-dao/) [tier](https://www.mechanism.capital/pleasrdao-thesis/) [VC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16zjMXGJwQ0s99kXLA7jW2UNNQcYQVdB9AjqaVb2s97M/edit) [funds](https://club.mirror.xyz/a5PQAwU0CuHJ90lEOmzq545nlC4qqNoTVTeHEGRrqow) have invested in these DAOs and I think they’ll end up becoming some of the best performers in their portfolios over the next decade.\n\nIn the rest of this post, we’ll take a closer look at Community DAOs - how they can become sustainable businesses, what the risks are, and what they may look like in the future.\n\n# Growing Community DAOs\n\nUnlike traditional startups, the *initial* purpose of most Community DAOs isn’t to maximize shareholder value. Instead, many Community DAOs start off just being about the vibes.\n\n![thanks drizzy for the quick vibe check](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3c93cf33-7d15-44bd-b977-8d9d0b13a961.jpeg?height=500&width=625)\n\nBut given the growth of the broader crypto market, many of these Community DAOs are finding themselves sitting on [treasuries worth millions](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) and ERC-20 tokens with [$100M+](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/friends-with-benefits-pro/) market caps. In just the past few months, they’ve gone from group chats to real businesses.\n\nOne of the keys to growing these Community DAOs will be recurring on-chain cash flow. There’s other important factors like community engagement, governance, tokenomics, etc. but generating on-chain cash flow gives Community DAOs capital to reward contributors, hire full time staff, and grow their treasury.\n\nBack in college, I studied Finance and one of the most boring things we learned was how to analyze a balance sheet. Turns out, it’s actually kinda useful.\n\nThere’s two types of assets on a Community DAO’s balance sheet:\n\n1. **Equity** (Blue-chip NFTs, Community DAO tokens, Crypto protocol tokens)\n2. **Cash** (ETH, USDC, DAI)\\*\n\n*\\*Technically ETH could be considered equity in the Ethereum network but for simplicity, let’s classify ETH as cash on the balance sheet since it’s the primary medium of exchange for DAOs*\n\nSo what can Community DAOs do with the cash and equity on their balance sheets? For many, crypto feels like a massively multiplayer [online game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game).\n\n[https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1432117673467416580](https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1432117673467416580)\n\nFor Community DAOs, the game is to increase the value of the treasury while maintaining the strong vibes that got the community going in the first place.\n\n[https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1427454307339706389](https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1427454307339706389)\n\nThere’s a few ways Community DAOs can put themselves in a position to win this game:\n\n* Collect blue-chip NFTs\n* Earn membership fees\n* Release NFT drops\n* Launch a tokenized NFT gallery\n* Build a media company\n* Sell SaaS tools\n* Invest in tokens (in DeFi protocols, NFT protocols, and other DAOs)\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each.\n\n***Collecting Blue-Chip NFTs***\n\nThis is the most common way Community DAOs get started.\n\nA group of frens want to collect blue-chips like [Punks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), [Autoglyphs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs), [DEAFBEEF](https://www.deafbeef.com/), [Fidenzas](https://tylerxhobbs.com/fidenza), [Ringers](https://artblocks.io/project/13), etc. but don’t want to put all the capital up themselves. Instead, they pool their funds to purchase a portfolio of blue-chips.\n\nHowever, in practice, storing blue-chips in a vault is *illiquid.* It doesn’t directly generate revenue. As a result, some of these DAOs issue ERC-20 tokens as a way to let people speculate on the value of the underlying NFTs, earn trading fees, and decide when to sell. [PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO), one of the largest NFT Collector DAOs, [recently announced](https://pleasr.mirror.xyz/7hpdJOWRzQx2pmCA16MDxN2FiA3eY6dwcrnEtXKnCJw) a similar liquidity strategy for their 1 of 1 Doge NFT.\n\n[https://twitter.com/business/status/1432723721521876998](https://twitter.com/business/status/1432723721521876998)\n\nThis kinda ends up being like storing gold in a vault and issuing paper certificates against it ([sound familiar?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard)). You can redeem your paper certificate for the underlying asset but you need to trust that the asset will be available and worth something when you want to redeem. But instead of gold and paper certificates we have blue-chip NFTs and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nTo be fair, some of these vaults are *extremely* valuable and have a damn good chance of being worth billions some day. So maybe instead of being like storing gold in a vault, maybe it’s more like owning equity in [iconic](https://very.auction/doge/doge) [internet](https://foundation.app/@NyanCat/nyan-cat-219) [culture](https://foundation.app/@DisasterGirl/disaster-girl-25046) and some of the most [valuable IP](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/) in the world. But the reality is that in the near term, these vaults alone don’t generate recurring on-chain cash flow.\n\nInstead of near-term cash flow, these blue-chip NFTs serve as a focal point (or as crypto people would say: [“schelling point”](https://nav.al/schelling-point)) for top collectors, artists, founders, investors, and operators to get involved in the community.\n\nAs we’ll see in the next few sections, the most valuable aspect of these vaults stuffed with blue-chip NFTs is that *they attract human capital* that converts illiquid jpegs into cash on the balance sheet.\n\n***Membership Fees***\n\n[https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera/status/1427330975227330565](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera/status/1427330975227330565)\n\nIdk about you, but the terms “follower” and “subscriber” feel weird to me. They imply a unilateral relationship. *I* follow *you*. *You* subscribe to *me*.\n\nBut the terms “member” and “owner” hit different.\n\n*We* are *members*.\n\n*We* are *owners*.\n\nIn web3, membership and ownership are encapsulated in ERC-20 tokens. Balances are stored on the blockchain. And your assets are controlled by your private key.\n\nIf the vibes are off in the community or you need liquidity after getting rekt by yet another degenerate yield farm, you can sell your tokens on an [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) or head over to the #otc channel in Discord to negotiate a fair rate. No questions asked.\n\nBut as the Community DAO increases the value of the treasury and demand for membership increases, the value of the underlying membership token increases.\n\nIf you were an early member of the community or earned a large allocation through your contributions, this can turn into meaningful wealth.\n\n![Membership in $FWB went from being worth $1,000 to $12,000 over the past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b906bb8e-f5f7-4fcb-971c-744a35cd59de.jpg?height=2138&width=1169)\n\nHowever, membership tokens aren’t just about “nUmBeR gO uP”. At a deeper level, the token is a coordination mechanism to help online communities *create*, *capture*, and *redistribute* value.\n\nAnd because token holders are also community members, they don’t need to fire up an Excel spreadsheet and make resource allocation decisions based on DCF analyses. Unless they want to.\n\nInstead, Community DAOs invest in whatever they want. Sometimes that’s [donating to charities](https://nouns.wtf/vote/1). Other times that’s [popping bottles in Paris](https://gallery.fwb.help/fwb-paris).\n\n***NFT drops***\n\nThis is the most common way Community DAOs generate on-chain cash flow. Some of these drops post serious numbers. This past weekend, Bored Ape Yacht Club sold $92M worth of [Mutant Ape NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/mutant-ape-yacht-club) in one hour.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Dogetoshi/status/1431792801751183363](https://twitter.com/Dogetoshi/status/1431792801751183363)\n\n[https://twitter.com/richerd/status/1431999591176572934](https://twitter.com/richerd/status/1431999591176572934)\n\nAnother one of my favorite drops recently was a collab between [Arihz](https://twitter.com/framergence) (an anonymous Brazilian computer scientist / NFT artist) and [FingerprintsDAO](https://twitter.com/FingerprintsDAO) (one of the leading collector DAOs for smart contracts as art). The drop was called [Avid Lines](https://avidlines.art/) and in the first 30 days, it’s done almost $10M in trading volume.\n\n[https://twitter.com/AvidLines/status/1430215479277146113](https://twitter.com/AvidLines/status/1430215479277146113)\n\nMore importantly, the drop was a great example of how to remix NFT IP in a fun and interesting way. It was a derivative of [Autoglyphs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs), which is the most valuable collection in the FingerprintsDAO treasury.\n\nHere’s how it worked:\n\n* Minters chose an Autoglyph to use as the base input for the generative algorithm\n* Autoglyph holders could whitelist their Autoglyphs to receive 10% of primary sales for mints that used their Autoglyph as the base input\n* The generative algorithm combined the base Autoglyph input with Arihz’s randomization code and the output was a remix called Avid Lines (and they’re fvcking beautiful)\n\n[https://twitter.com/dgntec/status/1417936546079072256](https://twitter.com/dgntec/status/1417936546079072256)\n\nSome of the most popular NFT drops are derivative projects that take blue-chip NFT IP and remix them in a way that’s fun, game-like, and visually appealing. These derivative projects are interesting because *they take illiquid jpegs* stored in a vault and *turn them into productive assets*. Some Autoglyph holders earned $40k worth of ETH by simply calling a whitelist function on a smart contract.\n\nAs DAOs look for new ways to increase the value of the NFTs in their treasury, we’ll continue seeing more derivative drops like these that enhance the value of the core IP while also turning NFTs into productive assets.\n\n***Tokenized NFT Gallery***\n\nMost Community DAOs don’t have their own tokenized NFT gallery yet. But in the near future I think it’ll become one of the most popular ways for Community DAOs to generate on-chain cash flow.\n\n[https://twitter.com/andy8052/status/1430715288622936066](https://twitter.com/andy8052/status/1430715288622936066)\n\nThe basic idea is:\n\n* Members use the Community DAO token to vote on which artists / drops can mint on their site\n* Multiple drop mechanisms are supported (reserve auctions, dutch auctions, editions, raffles, airdrops, generative, etc.) by letting devs register smart contracts with the DAO’s NFT gallery registry\n* Revenue from primary and secondary sales is shared between the artist, dev team, and DAO treasury\n* Artists, collectors, dev teams, and other contributors receive Community DAO tokens\n* Token holders get access to members-only features like exclusive drops, NFT badges, discounts, physical prints, merch, and more\n\nThis allows Community DAOs to build their own NFT marketplaces while rewarding token holders, artists, collectors, and devs with a mix of cash and equity. The curation abilities of top Community DAOs will eventually turn these NFT galleries into incubators for emerging artists.\n\nFor example, if you’re a generative artist and FingerprintsDAO votes you in to the their gallery, it’s basically like being a fashion designer and getting your latest clothing line in Vogue. This creates a reflexive feedback loop where the top Community DAOs build status by curating high-quality NFT collections and then help the next generation of artists get distribution while earning fees.\n\nIt’s kinda like [CAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency) or a [record label](https://jarroddicker.medium.com/?p=e14b695c43b) for internet culture.\n\n***Owned Media***\n\nBuilding media properties isn’t as sexy as a tokenized NFT gallery, but they work. Start a podcast and / or newsletter, find some sponsors, and boom. There ya go.\n\nThe top Community DAOs should have a pretty easy time finding sponsors given their community is filled with progressive individuals with cash to spend on random stuff like digital pet rocks.\n\n[https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/1431242146309238791](https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/1431242146309238791)\n\n[Club Top Shot](https://twitter.com/clubtopshot) is one of my favorite examples of a media company being built around an NFT collection.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ClubTopShot/status/1430519333613096964](https://twitter.com/ClubTopShot/status/1430519333613096964)\n\n[UTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Talent_Agency), one of the premier Hollywood talent agencies, [recently signed](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/) Larva Labs (creator of CryptoPunks, Autoglyphs, and Meebits) and will represent them across film, TV, video games, publishing, and licensing. Imagine Kevin Hart being the voiceover for a CryptoPunk or Meebit in a Netflix show lmfao. I’d watch that in a heartbeat.\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1432764961227481089](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1432764961227481089)\n\n***SaaS Tools***\n\nMost Community DAOs go through the following cycle pretty much every week:\n\n* A problem surfaces that needs to be solved\n* Somebody does research on the existing tools\n* Turns out none of the tools do exactly what the community needs\n* *\\*Ugh\\**\n\nFWB is one of the most active DAOs in building custom tooling for their community. When they needed a way to token-gate IRL events, [they built it](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/XU5_RYsow8fDbbckryr2snNyfrMV8HTJ0N39Cjkfy3s). When they needed a dashboard to highlight key information about the community, [they built it](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/KhvEi3kHy6rBJX9Lm4DI-iMkbzebEyNdM05uAB_StGY) (and it’s [vibey af](https://www.fwb.help/pulse)).\n\nOthers DAOs like Yearn built a [decentralized payroll management tool](https://medium.com/iearn/decentralized-payroll-management-for-daos-b2252160c543) because they wanted a more meritocratic way of rewarding contributors.\n\nAs Community DAOs become aggregators for top talent in crypto, we’ll see more custom tooling built to serve the broader community. And similar to how YC startups usually get initial distribution from other startups in their batch, Community DAOs will get their initial distribution from the other DAOs and projects their community is involved with.\n\n***Tokens (DeFi protocols, NFT protocols, and other DAOs)***\n\nIt’s been interesting to see DAOs align incentives by investing in each other. A few months ago FWB and WHALE did a [token swap](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmWnifY3KD5ECJNtQ23m9GHt2oQ1McA3T4DEEpFarPy9jW) where the stake in $FWB was valued at $100k. Today, that stake is worth $1.5M.\n\nGiven the amount of human capital inside these DAOs, most crypto protocols will probably have a few DAOs on their cap table as strategic investors helping with distribution, connections, and domain expertise. As the crypto market grows, these DAO-to-DAO stakes could end up being very, very large. These stakes will also create a new type of mutual alignment at a level we haven’t seen before in the competitive world of business.\n\n# Risks\n\nLike any investable asset, Community DAOs live along a risk-reward spectrum.\n\nSome of the main risks of Community DAOs include:\n\n* **Bad OpSec.** A DAO’s assets (NFTs, ETH, and ERC-20s) are stored in a smart contract that lives on the blockchain. Usually, the contract is a multi-sig wallet controlled by a trusted group of community members. To withdraw assets, a threshold needs to be reached where multiple people sign a transaction with their crypto wallet to authorize it. This prevents one of the signers from going rogue and rugging the community. Or in case one signer loses access to their private key, there should be enough redundancy in the system that transactions can still be signed and submitted. Ideally, we remove the need for any trusted parties and integrate governance with trustless transaction execution through something like [SafeSnap](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f). But in practice, most communities will require some level of trust in a select group of community members to ensure assets are stored and managed securely.\n* **Potential ETH / NFT crash.** Are NFTs in a bubble? Probably. The recent run up in prices mimics the boom and bust nature of [most technology cycles](http://lao8n.com/blog/2015/12/3/carlota-perez-technology-revolutions-financial-capital). If ETH prices crash, Community DAOs will have less cash on the balance sheet and will need to mark down the book value of their NFT assets. It’s a real risk. Many DAOs implement treasury diversification strategies with the help of domain experts like [Llama](https://www.llama.xyz/) to ensure they’re able to weather a bear market. DAOs can convert ETH to stables like USDC or DAI to protect against ETH volatility. The best DAOs will have recurring on-chain cash flow and efficient cost structures that enable them to weather a bear market.\n* **Lack of community engagement.** People are the heartbeat of any community. DAO or otherwise. The best Community DAOs have a mission that goes much deeper than “nUmBeR gO uP”. Collective action towards this mission is what keeps the core contributors and active community members coming back every day. But when people get distracted by token prices, or the core team loses interest, culture deteriorates. The magic of these Community DAOs are the people. The Discord mods that stay up all night answering questions. The volunteers that write documentation to help new members. A lot of the most valuable work in communities goes unnoticed and unrewarded. Community members need [intrinsic motivation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5364176/) to drive the community forward. Otherwise, the community will slowly devolve into just another inactive group chat.\n* **Poorly designed tokenomics.** The two biggest risks with tokenomics are: 1) the core team not having a large enough stake to keep them incentivized and 2) adversarial whales accumulating too many tokens and using them to manipulate the network through governance and / or negative price action. We’re still in the early stages of understanding best practices for Community DAO tokenomics. Many communities bring on experts like [Fire Eyez](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao), [Delphi Digital](https://twitter.com/Delphi_Digital), and [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/GauntletNetwork) to help develop a robust token strategy.\n\n# Future of Community DAOs\n\nHere’s a few predictions on the future of Community DAOs:\n\n* **There will be many billion dollar Community DAOs.** This probably isn’t controversial amongst crypto-natives but if you take a moment to think about it, it’s pretty wild. Online communities live across Discord servers, Telegram chats, Twitter DM’s, FB groups, Patreon, etc. A DAO structure gives these online communities the ability to coordinate capital, make collective decisions, and capture value with an internet-native currency. The canonical example of a community that could’ve used this functionality is [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) during the [GME short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze). Aside from just investing, I think there will be billion dollar community DAOs across gaming, publishing, music, education, art, software development, and more.\n* **Community tokens > Social tokens.** For the past couple years, social tokens were a hot topic when discussing the future of crypto-native consumer apps. The thought went, *“wouldn’t it be cool if you could invest in people the same way you can invest in stocks?”* [Bitclout’s](https://bitclout.com/) initial traction was a sign that there’s demand for this type of product. But social tokens focused on one person can lead to burnout, mental health issues, and regulatory risk. So instead of social tokens focused on individual people, I think *community tokens* focused on the *collective efforts* of groups of people will become the dominant model. Investing in the Mr. Beast token is boring. Being a member in the Mr. Beast community is fun. Social tokens feel like a top-down approach. A creator and their management team retains full control over creative decisions and IP. But as we’re seeing with [BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) and [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject), bottoms-up decentralized communities with the right incentives have the potential to create much more value than a centrally coordinated effort. It reminds of Windows / MacOS vs. Android / Linux. Arguably, the centrally coordinated approach of Windows / MacOS won in the previous era because they were able to bundle a proprietary operating system with other products like the MS Office Suite and the iPhone that had strong business models. Meanwhile, there was no native business model for open source software like Android or Linux. To capture value, Google acquired Android and bundled it into smart phones and SaaS companies like Red Hat bundled Linux into enterprise services. But now ERC-20 tokens and NFTs give open source software a business model. And not just open source software, but also open source IP. To me, social tokens are imply a top-down centrally coordinated effort whereas community tokens imply a bottoms-up decentralized community with full access to the underlying IP. The latter feels much more crypto-native to me.\n* **Service DAOs will play a key role in scaling Community DAOs.** In crypto, there’s a whole new set of specialized skills needed to build a successful project. Things like tokenomics design, treasury management, community management, onboarding, governance, smart contract development, data science, protocol security, OpSec, etc. Because there aren’t many experts in these areas yet, we’re already seeing crypto-native agencies (i.e., “Service DAOs”) that aggregate the best talent for a specialized skill and provide services to other DAOs. There’s [Llama](https://www.llama.xyz/) for treasury management, [Fire Eyez](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao) for tokenomics, and [Vector](https://twitter.com/VectorDAO) for designing crypto apps. Service DAOs combine the flexibility of freelancing with the upside of startups. Most get paid in a combination of ETH and ERC20-tokens so there’s skin-in-the-game and aligned incentives. As these Service DAOs build out their processes, hire more talent, and build software to automate their services, it’ll be much easier for Community DAOs to solve some of their toughest problems and help them scale.\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nCommunity DAOs are the next evolution in online communities. It’s like if subreddits had a shared bank account, a token, and governance mechanisms. They’ll become the [new social networks](https://www.notboring.co/p/status-monkeys). And the best way to learn is by actively contributing.\n\nHere’s what I usually share with friends interested in contributing to Community DAOs:\n\n* Join 3 to 5 Discord servers to get a sense of the different vibes\n* Introduce yourself in the #introductions channel and read the other intros to get an understanding of who’s in the community\n* Find two or three channels that are most relevant to you and check them multiple times a day. Ask questions. Answer questions. Offer encouragement.\n* Read the governance forum to understand what the top priorities are for the community and how they make decisions\n* Attend voice chats to build relationships with the most active contributors\n* Now, after this initial research phase, choose the top one or two Community DAOs you vibe with and *double down* on them\n* Find a committee you can help with and work on a project. As you get more comfortable, take on a leadership role\n* Try to get rewarded with the Community DAO’s token to align incentives and truly become an owner in the community\n* Iterate and repeat\n\nThe DAO maestro himself [Coopahtroopa](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa) recently published [an article](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw) with a bunch of DAOs you can contribute to as well as a list of people to follow.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1432403329422741504](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1432403329422741504)\n\nThe demand for talent in the space far exceeds supply so if you’re at all interested, don’t hesitate to jump in and start contributing.\n\nUntil next time ✌️\n\n\n---\n\n*Thanks for reading and feel free to DM me on Twitter with any questions, comments, or memes [@patrickxrivera](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera).

{"id": "Qni8OxbelRRWKqQKf1X-Xa0xBwitTd8RkMGx6VIdaf4", "title": "Community DAOs", "body": "In crypto land, 2020 was all about DeFi. So far, 2021 has been about NFTs (hot [jpeg summer](https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/summer.jpg-26722) anyone?)\n\nI’m pretty sure 2022 will be all about Community DAOs.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1430694594753097728](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1430694594753097728)\n\n*Community DAOs = DeFi infrastructure + NFT business models + Creative Humans*\n\nCrypto isn’t just a technology, it’s an [internet-native economy](https://p.mirror.xyz/1EpvJwUpx_KlRcHOKLNqADEkwHL_Z1ZYKobF2uLwgBg). Revenue is tracked in ETH. Key decisions are made with community governance. Transactions are enforced on-chain through smart contracts. Treasuries are controlled via multi-sigs. And value is captured with tokens.\n\nDAOs are the native corporate structure of these crypto economies.\n\nInstead of being incorporated in Delaware or the Cayman Islands, DAOs are incorporated in Discord servers and blockchains. DAOs provide an internet-native way of pooling capital, making collective decisions, and capturing value.\n\nThese days, it seems like there’s a DAO for pretty much everything. [Collecting NFTs](https://flamingodao.xyz/collection). [Socializing](https://www.fwb.help/). [Building software](https://twitter.com/prtyDAO). [E sports](https://twitter.com/blvkhvnd). [Musicians](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc). [Media](https://twitter.com/forefront__). [Education](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq). [Funding public goods](https://twitter.com/gitcoin).\n\nBut what makes a “DAO” a *DAO?*\n\n[https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1432728441481318410](https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1432728441481318410)\n\nAlthough the purpose, scale, and sophistication of DAOs can vary, most include the same core components:\n\n* **Group chat.** Usually starts off with someone saying “wouldn’t it be cool if…” and then adding a few frens to a Telegram group or Discord server.\n* **Treasury.** The most common type of Community DAO collects blue-chip NFTs and stores them in a multi-sig. As we’ve seen with [Party Bid](https://www.partybid.app/), people love aping into NFTs with their frens. It’s an experience. Community DAOs can also bootstrap their treasury through a [tokenized crowdfund](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc). This enables the DAO to fill their treasury with ETH to spend on operations and growth.\n* **ERC-20 Token.** As word gets out about how much fun your Community DAO is having, people start blowing up your DM’s begging you to let them in. At this point, many Community DAOs issue an ERC-20 token as a way to gate membership. Depending on the exclusivity of the Community DAO, membership can cost anywhere from a few dollars worth of ETH to a few mil.\n* **Governance.** Community DAOs with valuable treasuries and hundreds of members need a way to make collective decisions. Usually, rough consensus is reached in the group chat (with emojis, ofc) and the governance vote is just a formality. But it’s fun to see who voted, how much voting power they have, and what they voted for. Also, most Community DAOs empower small, focused teams of 5 to 10 members to own specific workstreams instead of requiring a governance proposal for every smol decision.\n* **On-chain cash flow**. This is the most nascent component of Community DAOs but also the most interesting. On-chain cash flow turns a fun group chat with your frens into a sustainable business. So far, the most common way to generate on-chain cash flow has been through NFT drops.\n\nSo, are these Community DAOs *actually* working?\n\nOver the past few months, DAOs like [Fingerprints](https://fingerprintsdao.gitbook.io/fingerprints-dao/) and [Flamingo](https://twitter.com/FLAMINGODAO) have amassed five and six figure NFT collections.\n\n[https://twitter.com/awrigh01/status/1431778270727610371](https://twitter.com/awrigh01/status/1431778270727610371)\n\nDAOs like [Bright Moments](https://twitter.com/brtmoments) have sold millions worth of NFTs in minutes.\n\n[https://twitter.com/cryptovenetians/status/1427703534561206273](https://twitter.com/cryptovenetians/status/1427703534561206273)\n\n[Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), [Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq), [Forefront](https://twitter.com/forefront__), and [FWB](https://twitter.com/FWBtweets) are becoming the premier on-ramps for the next wave of active contributors in crypto.\n\n[https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1422577245671936000](https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1422577245671936000)\n\nSome DAOs like [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf/) just leave you thinking WTF.\n\n[https://twitter.com/yossihasson/status/1430815200354111488?s=20](https://twitter.com/yossihasson/status/1430815200354111488?s=20)\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject)…\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072)\n\nMultiple [top](https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/08/bright-moments-dao/) [tier](https://www.mechanism.capital/pleasrdao-thesis/) [VC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16zjMXGJwQ0s99kXLA7jW2UNNQcYQVdB9AjqaVb2s97M/edit) [funds](https://club.mirror.xyz/a5PQAwU0CuHJ90lEOmzq545nlC4qqNoTVTeHEGRrqow) have invested in these DAOs and I think they’ll end up becoming some of the best performers in their portfolios over the next decade.\n\nIn the rest of this post, we’ll take a closer look at Community DAOs - how they can become sustainable businesses, what the risks are, and what they may look like in the future.\n\n# Growing Community DAOs\n\nUnlike traditional startups, the *initial* purpose of most Community DAOs isn’t to maximize shareholder value. Instead, many Community DAOs start off just being about the vibes.\n\n![thanks drizzy for the quick vibe check](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3c93cf33-7d15-44bd-b977-8d9d0b13a961.jpeg?height=500&width=625)\n\nBut given the growth of the broader crypto market, many of these Community DAOs are finding themselves sitting on [treasuries worth millions](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) and ERC-20 tokens with [$100M+](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/friends-with-benefits-pro/) market caps. In just the past few months, they’ve gone from group chats to real businesses.\n\nOne of the keys to growing these Community DAOs will be recurring on-chain cash flow. There’s other important factors like community engagement, governance, tokenomics, etc. but generating on-chain cash flow gives Community DAOs capital to reward contributors, hire full time staff, and grow their treasury.\n\nBack in college, I studied Finance and one of the most boring things we learned was how to analyze a balance sheet. Turns out, it’s actually kinda useful.\n\nThere’s two types of assets on a Community DAO’s balance sheet:\n\n1. **Equity** (Blue-chip NFTs, Community DAO tokens, Crypto protocol tokens)\n2. **Cash** (ETH, USDC, DAI)\\*\n\n*\\*Technically ETH could be considered equity in the Ethereum network but for simplicity, let’s classify ETH as cash on the balance sheet since it’s the primary medium of exchange for DAOs*\n\nSo what can Community DAOs do with the cash and equity on their balance sheets? For many, crypto feels like a massively multiplayer [online game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game).\n\n[https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1432117673467416580](https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1432117673467416580)\n\nFor Community DAOs, the game is to increase the value of the treasury while maintaining the strong vibes that got the community going in the first place.\n\n[https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1427454307339706389](https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1427454307339706389)\n\nThere’s a few ways Community DAOs can put themselves in a position to win this game:\n\n* Collect blue-chip NFTs\n* Earn membership fees\n* Release NFT drops\n* Launch a tokenized NFT gallery\n* Build a media company\n* Sell SaaS tools\n* Invest in tokens (in DeFi protocols, NFT protocols, and other DAOs)\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each.\n\n***Collecting Blue-Chip NFTs***\n\nThis is the most common way Community DAOs get started.\n\nA group of frens want to collect blue-chips like [Punks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), [Autoglyphs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs), [DEAFBEEF](https://www.deafbeef.com/), [Fidenzas](https://tylerxhobbs.com/fidenza), [Ringers](https://artblocks.io/project/13), etc. but don’t want to put all the capital up themselves. Instead, they pool their funds to purchase a portfolio of blue-chips.\n\nHowever, in practice, storing blue-chips in a vault is *illiquid.* It doesn’t directly generate revenue. As a result, some of these DAOs issue ERC-20 tokens as a way to let people speculate on the value of the underlying NFTs, earn trading fees, and decide when to sell. [PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO), one of the largest NFT Collector DAOs, [recently announced](https://pleasr.mirror.xyz/7hpdJOWRzQx2pmCA16MDxN2FiA3eY6dwcrnEtXKnCJw) a similar liquidity strategy for their 1 of 1 Doge NFT.\n\n[https://twitter.com/business/status/1432723721521876998](https://twitter.com/business/status/1432723721521876998)\n\nThis kinda ends up being like storing gold in a vault and issuing paper certificates against it ([sound familiar?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard)). You can redeem your paper certificate for the underlying asset but you need to trust that the asset will be available and worth something when you want to redeem. But instead of gold and paper certificates we have blue-chip NFTs and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nTo be fair, some of these vaults are *extremely* valuable and have a damn good chance of being worth billions some day. So maybe instead of being like storing gold in a vault, maybe it’s more like owning equity in [iconic](https://very.auction/doge/doge) [internet](https://foundation.app/@NyanCat/nyan-cat-219) [culture](https://foundation.app/@DisasterGirl/disaster-girl-25046) and some of the most [valuable IP](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/) in the world. But the reality is that in the near term, these vaults alone don’t generate recurring on-chain cash flow.\n\nInstead of near-term cash flow, these blue-chip NFTs serve as a focal point (or as crypto people would say: [“schelling point”](https://nav.al/schelling-point)) for top collectors, artists, founders, investors, and operators to get involved in the community.\n\nAs we’ll see in the next few sections, the most valuable aspect of these vaults stuffed with blue-chip NFTs is that *they attract human capital* that converts illiquid jpegs into cash on the balance sheet.\n\n***Membership Fees***\n\n[https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera/status/1427330975227330565](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera/status/1427330975227330565)\n\nIdk about you, but the terms “follower” and “subscriber” feel weird to me. They imply a unilateral relationship. *I* follow *you*. *You* subscribe to *me*.\n\nBut the terms “member” and “owner” hit different.\n\n*We* are *members*.\n\n*We* are *owners*.\n\nIn web3, membership and ownership are encapsulated in ERC-20 tokens. Balances are stored on the blockchain. And your assets are controlled by your private key.\n\nIf the vibes are off in the community or you need liquidity after getting rekt by yet another degenerate yield farm, you can sell your tokens on an [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) or head over to the #otc channel in Discord to negotiate a fair rate. No questions asked.\n\nBut as the Community DAO increases the value of the treasury and demand for membership increases, the value of the underlying membership token increases.\n\nIf you were an early member of the community or earned a large allocation through your contributions, this can turn into meaningful wealth.\n\n![Membership in $FWB went from being worth $1,000 to $12,000 over the past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b906bb8e-f5f7-4fcb-971c-744a35cd59de.jpg?height=2138&width=1169)\n\nHowever, membership tokens aren’t just about “nUmBeR gO uP”. At a deeper level, the token is a coordination mechanism to help online communities *create*, *capture*, and *redistribute* value.\n\nAnd because token holders are also community members, they don’t need to fire up an Excel spreadsheet and make resource allocation decisions based on DCF analyses. Unless they want to.\n\nInstead, Community DAOs invest in whatever they want. Sometimes that’s [donating to charities](https://nouns.wtf/vote/1). Other times that’s [popping bottles in Paris](https://gallery.fwb.help/fwb-paris).\n\n***NFT drops***\n\nThis is the most common way Community DAOs generate on-chain cash flow. Some of these drops post serious numbers. This past weekend, Bored Ape Yacht Club sold $92M worth of [Mutant Ape NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/mutant-ape-yacht-club) in one hour.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Dogetoshi/status/1431792801751183363](https://twitter.com/Dogetoshi/status/1431792801751183363)\n\n[https://twitter.com/richerd/status/1431999591176572934](https://twitter.com/richerd/status/1431999591176572934)\n\nAnother one of my favorite drops recently was a collab between [Arihz](https://twitter.com/framergence) (an anonymous Brazilian computer scientist / NFT artist) and [FingerprintsDAO](https://twitter.com/FingerprintsDAO) (one of the leading collector DAOs for smart contracts as art). The drop was called [Avid Lines](https://avidlines.art/) and in the first 30 days, it’s done almost $10M in trading volume.\n\n[https://twitter.com/AvidLines/status/1430215479277146113](https://twitter.com/AvidLines/status/1430215479277146113)\n\nMore importantly, the drop was a great example of how to remix NFT IP in a fun and interesting way. It was a derivative of [Autoglyphs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs), which is the most valuable collection in the FingerprintsDAO treasury.\n\nHere’s how it worked:\n\n* Minters chose an Autoglyph to use as the base input for the generative algorithm\n* Autoglyph holders could whitelist their Autoglyphs to receive 10% of primary sales for mints that used their Autoglyph as the base input\n* The generative algorithm combined the base Autoglyph input with Arihz’s randomization code and the output was a remix called Avid Lines (and they’re fvcking beautiful)\n\n[https://twitter.com/dgntec/status/1417936546079072256](https://twitter.com/dgntec/status/1417936546079072256)\n\nSome of the most popular NFT drops are derivative projects that take blue-chip NFT IP and remix them in a way that’s fun, game-like, and visually appealing. These derivative projects are interesting because *they take illiquid jpegs* stored in a vault and *turn them into productive assets*. Some Autoglyph holders earned $40k worth of ETH by simply calling a whitelist function on a smart contract.\n\nAs DAOs look for new ways to increase the value of the NFTs in their treasury, we’ll continue seeing more derivative drops like these that enhance the value of the core IP while also turning NFTs into productive assets.\n\n***Tokenized NFT Gallery***\n\nMost Community DAOs don’t have their own tokenized NFT gallery yet. But in the near future I think it’ll become one of the most popular ways for Community DAOs to generate on-chain cash flow.\n\n[https://twitter.com/andy8052/status/1430715288622936066](https://twitter.com/andy8052/status/1430715288622936066)\n\nThe basic idea is:\n\n* Members use the Community DAO token to vote on which artists / drops can mint on their site\n* Multiple drop mechanisms are supported (reserve auctions, dutch auctions, editions, raffles, airdrops, generative, etc.) by letting devs register smart contracts with the DAO’s NFT gallery registry\n* Revenue from primary and secondary sales is shared between the artist, dev team, and DAO treasury\n* Artists, collectors, dev teams, and other contributors receive Community DAO tokens\n* Token holders get access to members-only features like exclusive drops, NFT badges, discounts, physical prints, merch, and more\n\nThis allows Community DAOs to build their own NFT marketplaces while rewarding token holders, artists, collectors, and devs with a mix of cash and equity. The curation abilities of top Community DAOs will eventually turn these NFT galleries into incubators for emerging artists.\n\nFor example, if you’re a generative artist and FingerprintsDAO votes you in to the their gallery, it’s basically like being a fashion designer and getting your latest clothing line in Vogue. This creates a reflexive feedback loop where the top Community DAOs build status by curating high-quality NFT collections and then help the next generation of artists get distribution while earning fees.\n\nIt’s kinda like [CAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency) or a [record label](https://jarroddicker.medium.com/?p=e14b695c43b) for internet culture.\n\n***Owned Media***\n\nBuilding media properties isn’t as sexy as a tokenized NFT gallery, but they work. Start a podcast and / or newsletter, find some sponsors, and boom. There ya go.\n\nThe top Community DAOs should have a pretty easy time finding sponsors given their community is filled with progressive individuals with cash to spend on random stuff like digital pet rocks.\n\n[https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/1431242146309238791](https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/1431242146309238791)\n\n[Club Top Shot](https://twitter.com/clubtopshot) is one of my favorite examples of a media company being built around an NFT collection.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ClubTopShot/status/1430519333613096964](https://twitter.com/ClubTopShot/status/1430519333613096964)\n\n[UTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Talent_Agency), one of the premier Hollywood talent agencies, [recently signed](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/) Larva Labs (creator of CryptoPunks, Autoglyphs, and Meebits) and will represent them across film, TV, video games, publishing, and licensing. Imagine Kevin Hart being the voiceover for a CryptoPunk or Meebit in a Netflix show lmfao. I’d watch that in a heartbeat.\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1432764961227481089](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1432764961227481089)\n\n***SaaS Tools***\n\nMost Community DAOs go through the following cycle pretty much every week:\n\n* A problem surfaces that needs to be solved\n* Somebody does research on the existing tools\n* Turns out none of the tools do exactly what the community needs\n* *\\*Ugh\\**\n\nFWB is one of the most active DAOs in building custom tooling for their community. When they needed a way to token-gate IRL events, [they built it](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/XU5_RYsow8fDbbckryr2snNyfrMV8HTJ0N39Cjkfy3s). When they needed a dashboard to highlight key information about the community, [they built it](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/KhvEi3kHy6rBJX9Lm4DI-iMkbzebEyNdM05uAB_StGY) (and it’s [vibey af](https://www.fwb.help/pulse)).\n\nOthers DAOs like Yearn built a [decentralized payroll management tool](https://medium.com/iearn/decentralized-payroll-management-for-daos-b2252160c543) because they wanted a more meritocratic way of rewarding contributors.\n\nAs Community DAOs become aggregators for top talent in crypto, we’ll see more custom tooling built to serve the broader community. And similar to how YC startups usually get initial distribution from other startups in their batch, Community DAOs will get their initial distribution from the other DAOs and projects their community is involved with.\n\n***Tokens (DeFi protocols, NFT protocols, and other DAOs)***\n\nIt’s been interesting to see DAOs align incentives by investing in each other. A few months ago FWB and WHALE did a [token swap](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmWnifY3KD5ECJNtQ23m9GHt2oQ1McA3T4DEEpFarPy9jW) where the stake in $FWB was valued at $100k. Today, that stake is worth $1.5M.\n\nGiven the amount of human capital inside these DAOs, most crypto protocols will probably have a few DAOs on their cap table as strategic investors helping with distribution, connections, and domain expertise. As the crypto market grows, these DAO-to-DAO stakes could end up being very, very large. These stakes will also create a new type of mutual alignment at a level we haven’t seen before in the competitive world of business.\n\n# Risks\n\nLike any investable asset, Community DAOs live along a risk-reward spectrum.\n\nSome of the main risks of Community DAOs include:\n\n* **Bad OpSec.** A DAO’s assets (NFTs, ETH, and ERC-20s) are stored in a smart contract that lives on the blockchain. Usually, the contract is a multi-sig wallet controlled by a trusted group of community members. To withdraw assets, a threshold needs to be reached where multiple people sign a transaction with their crypto wallet to authorize it. This prevents one of the signers from going rogue and rugging the community. Or in case one signer loses access to their private key, there should be enough redundancy in the system that transactions can still be signed and submitted. Ideally, we remove the need for any trusted parties and integrate governance with trustless transaction execution through something like [SafeSnap](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f). But in practice, most communities will require some level of trust in a select group of community members to ensure assets are stored and managed securely.\n* **Potential ETH / NFT crash.** Are NFTs in a bubble? Probably. The recent run up in prices mimics the boom and bust nature of [most technology cycles](http://lao8n.com/blog/2015/12/3/carlota-perez-technology-revolutions-financial-capital). If ETH prices crash, Community DAOs will have less cash on the balance sheet and will need to mark down the book value of their NFT assets. It’s a real risk. Many DAOs implement treasury diversification strategies with the help of domain experts like [Llama](https://www.llama.xyz/) to ensure they’re able to weather a bear market. DAOs can convert ETH to stables like USDC or DAI to protect against ETH volatility. The best DAOs will have recurring on-chain cash flow and efficient cost structures that enable them to weather a bear market.\n* **Lack of community engagement.** People are the heartbeat of any community. DAO or otherwise. The best Community DAOs have a mission that goes much deeper than “nUmBeR gO uP”. Collective action towards this mission is what keeps the core contributors and active community members coming back every day. But when people get distracted by token prices, or the core team loses interest, culture deteriorates. The magic of these Community DAOs are the people. The Discord mods that stay up all night answering questions. The volunteers that write documentation to help new members. A lot of the most valuable work in communities goes unnoticed and unrewarded. Community members need [intrinsic motivation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5364176/) to drive the community forward. Otherwise, the community will slowly devolve into just another inactive group chat.\n* **Poorly designed tokenomics.** The two biggest risks with tokenomics are: 1) the core team not having a large enough stake to keep them incentivized and 2) adversarial whales accumulating too many tokens and using them to manipulate the network through governance and / or negative price action. We’re still in the early stages of understanding best practices for Community DAO tokenomics. Many communities bring on experts like [Fire Eyez](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao), [Delphi Digital](https://twitter.com/Delphi_Digital), and [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/GauntletNetwork) to help develop a robust token strategy.\n\n# Future of Community DAOs\n\nHere’s a few predictions on the future of Community DAOs:\n\n* **There will be many billion dollar Community DAOs.** This probably isn’t controversial amongst crypto-natives but if you take a moment to think about it, it’s pretty wild. Online communities live across Discord servers, Telegram chats, Twitter DM’s, FB groups, Patreon, etc. A DAO structure gives these online communities the ability to coordinate capital, make collective decisions, and capture value with an internet-native currency. The canonical example of a community that could’ve used this functionality is [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) during the [GME short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze). Aside from just investing, I think there will be billion dollar community DAOs across gaming, publishing, music, education, art, software development, and more.\n* **Community tokens > Social tokens.** For the past couple years, social tokens were a hot topic when discussing the future of crypto-native consumer apps. The thought went, *“wouldn’t it be cool if you could invest in people the same way you can invest in stocks?”* [Bitclout’s](https://bitclout.com/) initial traction was a sign that there’s demand for this type of product. But social tokens focused on one person can lead to burnout, mental health issues, and regulatory risk. So instead of social tokens focused on individual people, I think *community tokens* focused on the *collective efforts* of groups of people will become the dominant model. Investing in the Mr. Beast token is boring. Being a member in the Mr. Beast community is fun. Social tokens feel like a top-down approach. A creator and their management team retains full control over creative decisions and IP. But as we’re seeing with [BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) and [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject), bottoms-up decentralized communities with the right incentives have the potential to create much more value than a centrally coordinated effort. It reminds of Windows / MacOS vs. Android / Linux. Arguably, the centrally coordinated approach of Windows / MacOS won in the previous era because they were able to bundle a proprietary operating system with other products like the MS Office Suite and the iPhone that had strong business models. Meanwhile, there was no native business model for open source software like Android or Linux. To capture value, Google acquired Android and bundled it into smart phones and SaaS companies like Red Hat bundled Linux into enterprise services. But now ERC-20 tokens and NFTs give open source software a business model. And not just open source software, but also open source IP. To me, social tokens are imply a top-down centrally coordinated effort whereas community tokens imply a bottoms-up decentralized community with full access to the underlying IP. The latter feels much more crypto-native to me.\n* **Service DAOs will play a key role in scaling Community DAOs.** In crypto, there’s a whole new set of specialized skills needed to build a successful project. Things like tokenomics design, treasury management, community management, onboarding, governance, smart contract development, data science, protocol security, OpSec, etc. Because there aren’t many experts in these areas yet, we’re already seeing crypto-native agencies (i.e., “Service DAOs”) that aggregate the best talent for a specialized skill and provide services to other DAOs. There’s [Llama](https://www.llama.xyz/) for treasury management, [Fire Eyez](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao) for tokenomics, and [Vector](https://twitter.com/VectorDAO) for designing crypto apps. Service DAOs combine the flexibility of freelancing with the upside of startups. Most get paid in a combination of ETH and ERC20-tokens so there’s skin-in-the-game and aligned incentives. As these Service DAOs build out their processes, hire more talent, and build software to automate their services, it’ll be much easier for Community DAOs to solve some of their toughest problems and help them scale.\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nCommunity DAOs are the next evolution in online communities. It’s like if subreddits had a shared bank account, a token, and governance mechanisms. They’ll become the [new social networks](https://www.notboring.co/p/status-monkeys). And the best way to learn is by actively contributing.\n\nHere’s what I usually share with friends interested in contributing to Community DAOs:\n\n* Join 3 to 5 Discord servers to get a sense of the different vibes\n* Introduce yourself in the #introductions channel and read the other intros to get an understanding of who’s in the community\n* Find two or three channels that are most relevant to you and check them multiple times a day. Ask questions. Answer questions. Offer encouragement.\n* Read the governance forum to understand what the top priorities are for the community and how they make decisions\n* Attend voice chats to build relationships with the most active contributors\n* Now, after this initial research phase, choose the top one or two Community DAOs you vibe with and *double down* on them\n* Find a committee you can help with and work on a project. As you get more comfortable, take on a leadership role\n* Try to get rewarded with the Community DAO’s token to align incentives and truly become an owner in the community\n* Iterate and repeat\n\nThe DAO maestro himself [Coopahtroopa](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa) recently published [an article](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw) with a bunch of DAOs you can contribute to as well as a list of people to follow.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1432403329422741504](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1432403329422741504)\n\nThe demand for talent in the space far exceeds supply so if you’re at all interested, don’t hesitate to jump in and start contributing.\n\nUntil next time ✌️\n\n\n---\n\n*Thanks for reading and feel free to DM me on Twitter with any questions, comments, or memes [@patrickxrivera](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera).

{"id": "7nN1lsyRZpLG9wT3w9kxNe9xcRPw5_VTdKjqFY6hCiw", "title": "We Like The Loot", "body": "LOOT dropped just 5 days ago and has taken the whole NFT community by storm with simple lines of text instead of fancy jpegs.\n\n![GM](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1bea0ad8-2bc6-4c11-91cf-ee74b193035e.jpeg?height=3803&width=3626)\n\nSo, What exactly is it? \n\nIt’s a deceptively simple concept. \n\n“Just a TXT file on a black background,'' consisting of randomly generated fantasy adventurer loot in a set. In fact, it was even available for anyone to mint at launch for free. The founder, Dom Hofmann of Vine, Blitmap and Supdrive fame, did not set any secondary sale fees, allowing the community to use it anyway they wanted, unbeholden to him.\n\nAt first glance, one can be forgiven for assuming LOOT was just like any other regular NFT drop (in fact, it was so under the radar, one didn’t need to jam up the gas to mint one).  \n\nUpon further reflection though, it is much more than that. It potentially represents a paradigm shift in the NFT space, for the better, taking us one step closer to cross-compatible games.\n\nWhat LOOT ultimately represents is a NFT building block, limited only by the community’s collective imagination. It feels almost like an entire community is building an open-sourced RPG in real time. The fact that they flipped the entire script on its head is the reason why everyone is so excited about it.\n\n[https://twitter.com/tandavas/status/1432802983528448000](https://twitter.com/tandavas/status/1432802983528448000)\n\nThis is because LOOT is, in its essence, a minimum viable product that anybody can take up and expand, build upon, spin out from, and finish in however way they imagine. So far the community has been welcoming to say the least, to this fresh take on NFTs, as is evident by how actively engaged their discord is and the depth of the lore being built around the project.  Everyone wants to be a part of it. \n\nOne only needs to look back to DeFi Summer, and how the DeFi Legos movement like Lending and DEXs led to additional lego pieces like Yield Aggregators popping out as a result. \n\nA similar phenomenon happening right now with LOOT as well.\n\n[https://twitter.com/lootproject/status/1432793428614684674](https://twitter.com/lootproject/status/1432793428614684674)\n\n[https://twitter.com/lililashka/status/1433017503945482248](https://twitter.com/lililashka/status/1433017503945482248)\n\nThe decision to not to include any official interpretations of LOOT was an ingenious and bold take in the growing NFT-verse. This grants the community full creative autonomy over their LOOT. Imagine if you liked 1 characteristic of your Punk but didn't like how your overall Punk looked. Should you alter it to fit your style, it would tarnish the ‘identity’ of your Punk. \n\nHowever with LOOT, since it’s holders have full creative autonomy, one could easily just get a new design drawn up to suit your taste and the community as a whole would flock to appreciate it with praises of, ‘Looks Rare’. \n\nArguably the fact that there’s no official artwork makes the artwork made by the community even more unique, as every artist has their own interpretation of LOOT allowing for an even broader expansion of its lore.\n\n![Woosh! You have created a new primitive!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e5a0ec3b-8f9b-4226-ad91-3858fa45da49.jpeg?height=4104&width=4105)\n\nLOOT is an evolution of NFTs with a call option on community creativity and the projects that are starting to form around it. It encapsulates the essence of the ecosystem both in the collaborative nature as well as creativity, and has injected a fresh idea into a space where we thought we had seen it all. \n\nUnironically the fact that is was just a ‘TXT’ file, was the perfect writing prompt we needed; now everyone gets a chance to expand upon its lore.\n\nWhich begs the big question, How do you value LOOT?\n\nHow do you value a TXT file?\n\nHow do you value an artwork that is still in the progress of being finished with the boundless creativity of the community?\n\nRarity by a sum of its parts?\n\nSpecific equipment that makes the set exciting?\n\nMemetic power of the factions behind it?​​\n\nOr perhaps even the case for a Bottom Up Decentralized Gaming Ecosystem Thesis (h/t Fiskantes)\n\n[https://twitter.com/Fiskantes/status/1432984961586450432](https://twitter.com/Fiskantes/status/1432984961586450432)\n\nHonestly, there is no right answer to that yet, but we sure as hell are strapping along for the ride.\n\nPerhaps as the lo›re surrounding LOOT grows, one can ascertain the intrinsic value of the loots better as well, but we’ll ponder that in our next thread.\n\nIn the meantime, helpful threads to read up on LOOT lore 👇\n\n[https://twitter.com/ajwaxman/status/1432803519569014788](https://twitter.com/ajwaxman/status/1432803519569014788)\n\n[https://g.mirror.xyz/p3rjG4buPGWdu6LyWW30qfIzzQJw50wWNglPFdByPvE](https://g.mirror.xyz/p3rjG4buPGWdu6LyWW30qfIzzQJw50wWNglPFdByPvE)\n\n![thanks for reading, gn](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36500981-13ba-4cd1-8d22-ac56d854c87b.jpeg?height=3803&width=3626)\n\nh/t\n\nKing @*trente* for telling us about Dom and Supdrive\n\nand for their inputs on the thread; @_anishagnihotri @Dogetoshi @econoar @0xPEPO @Fiskantes @jacksonedame\n\nand @Mazetangled for making the blue cat so divine", "timestamp": 1630523660, "digest": "e1IjzeqaHdwoUd7bV5TbtQFaRkRhVMqzjiYN3CocLI8", "contributor": "0x4Ab5E3F0b2d1604dD2002CfEcA6163802D74c6Cb"}

That citizens endure such agony only reveals how indispensable this infrastructure is. A New Yorker’s life is spent “in transit,” rushing up the stairs to the station platform, getting on and off and to transfer, and feeling relief as the train rumbles over impossible social distances.\n\n![Sunlight streams through the windows in the concourse at Grand Central Terminal in New York City in 1954 | AP Photo](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a0293ef1-d9f1-4794-93ac-81ebd08ea244.png?height=808&width=1200)\n\n### The Most Famous Project that Almost Never Got Built\n\nThe complex transportation system that supports over five million journeys a day was an audacious dream that took almost a century to realize. Consider one of these projects — Second Avenue Subway — which was received excitedly when it was proposed in 1920.\n\nHowever, it soon proved a prime example of the pitfalls of bureaucratic power-brokering — conflicts of interest between politics and capital halted the proposed project again and again. Optimism for the project’s completion ebbed and flowed depending on political priorities. It wasn’t until 2017, a century after the initial proposal, that the $17-billion project finally started serving passengers.\n\nA turning point occurred in 1988. Just as the failure of the entire project began to seem inevitable, four young city planners sat down in a crumbling old office on Lawrence Street in downtown Brooklyn. They spent weeks poring over statistics that measured travel time, ridership, crowding, and delays. With just one phone and one computer, they analyzed how rerouting trains, skipping stations, and overnight shuttle services could improve the performance and productivity of the subway system. Their plan was by and large the one that now supports over five million journeys a day.\n\nWhat made the difference? They were not power brokers, but rather citizens and prospective passengers of the very system they were designing.\n\n### Physical vs Digital Infrastructure\n\nFor anyone whose vocation involves the building and designing of systems of software, the dynamics around bottoms-up design and top-down execution must feel familiar. Individuals who are users of the system desire to improve it with no conflicting incentives but to improve their ways of living, goodwill, and reputation.\n\nBuilders of digital infrastructure should keep these lessons from our forebears in mind while considering the different affordances and requirements of the new medium. In *“Roads and Cities, ”* Nadia Eghbal made a brilliant juxtaposition between physical and digital infrastructure:\n\n> *Physical infrastructure is built to last, which is partially why these projects take so long to plan, fund, and build. The London Underground, London’s public rapid transit system, was built in 1863; the underground tunnels dug for the subway system are still in use today. The Brooklyn Bridge, which connects the boroughs of Brooklyn and Manhattan in New York City, was completed in 1883 and did not undergo any major renovations until 2010, over one hundred years later.*\n>\n> *Digital infrastructure not only requires frequent maintenance and upkeep to be compatible with other software components but its usage and adoption change frequently as well. A bridge built in the middle of New York City will have fairly consistent and guaranteed usage, commensurate with the rise or decline of the city’s population. But a programming language or framework could be extremely popular for several years, then fall out of favor when something faster, more efficient, or simply trendier comes along.*\n\nIn short, physical infrastructure traditionally *frontloads* investment costs while digital infrastructure, despite the absence of intense physical labor, much lower upfront cost, and nonlinear scalability, requires immense time and energy for *ongoing* maintenance and improvement. This makes sense: the most difficult and complex in real estate is building the first instance of a piece of infrastructure whereas in digital infrastructure, stakeholder management is an ongoing task that only gets more complex as operations grow.\n\nThe question is then how to incentivize and sustain digital infrastructure that prioritizes its citizens. Currently, the only path to longevity and sustainability for digital infrastructure is to pursue venture capital funding, corporate or ad-hoc donations, or simply to become an open-source commercial software for large enterprises by building a dedicated go-to-market and customer success team.\n\nThe flaws of each approach are apparent. Venture capital is a viable path if what the core team desires is rapid commercial growth, but it often creates boom-or-bust outcomes. Meanwhile, corporate donations can challenge the neutrality of the infrastructure, and ad-hoc donations shorten the horizon for planning and resourcing labor. Finally, becoming a service provider requires significant upfront capital, and even the most well-funded of enterprise SaaS companies have rarely allowed money to flow back as donations to the initial community of open-source developers who laid the foundations of their success.\n\nThe story of the internet is often one of open-source labors of love that quickly become gated, even from their own workers who are eventually stripped of optionality and agency. In today’s environment, more and more functions are regarded as fungible, to be delegated to anonymous freelance services and marketplaces whose workers have little autonomy and ownership over the work they produce. Workers are left to relate to each other as rectangle boxes on a screen rather than evolving, multidimensional bodies.\n\nIt’s not hard to extrapolate the future from these little rectangles. It is the future of a hyper-gig economy where only technically literate solopreneurs comfortable with building their own brand can achieve a meaningful moat through individuation, and most are treated as fungible.\n\n### Infrastructure of the Future\n\n**At STATION, we believe a permissionless, decentralized railroad built by the people could fundamentally change the relationship between our work and our identity.** We’re building the talent infrastructure and network centered around contribution and collaboration. Our goal is to empower internet-native workers by validating their contributions on-chain and helping connect them to the most interesting opportunities and connections based on that data.\n\nAt its best and most democratic, infrastructure offers social connectivity while affording those who have been marginalized on the outskirts of society the opportunity to pursue economic and creative freedom —  be they writers that publish visual novels online, amateur gamers with a passion for digital fashion design, or teachers whose income currently depends on the rules of the platforms they serve.\n\nThis infrastructure does not currently exist for crypto. It’s currently extremely difficult for newcomers, especially if they are not technologists themselves, to navigate the ecosystem, quilted together across Discord servers and Telegram group chats.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b8aa7d0c-b578-4564-a5da-895f42acc325.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nHowever, we realized there was a deeper disconnect among those looking to build a financially sustainable, open-source future. Quite simply, for brilliant folks not currently in crypto, being asked to leave traditional tracks to jump into the great unknown without any guardrails or clear path is a tall order. The questions that came up when we interviewed brilliant friends who had not yet made the leap into crypto were not about how crypto worked, but questions around identity, meaning, and impact. ***Who’s in crypto, and why do they care about it? Why would I consider contributing? Why does it matter to me now? Why does this matter at all in 5 years?*** These questions are as important to understand the motivations of individuals as well as those of organizations. There’s a myriad of content out there explaining what crypto does, but few are answering these more fundamental questions of identity and meaning.\n\nWe believe that there is no single correct answer to these questions. The Internet is never static, but always evolving. The answer to those questions isn’t prescriptive, but something that helps people take action and form relationships.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/00737012-0c54-4017-b3f6-9e5f52d27828.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nThe atomic units of our product are Profiles, Terminals, and Contributions. Everyone will have a Profile on Station that aggregates their Contributions across platforms, their on-chain interactions, the groups they represent, and their closest collaborators. They will discover and get directed to values-aligned Terminals (projects, DAOs, or protocols) that are actively looking to attract and onboard more contributors through grants, RFPs (Request for Proposal), and bounties. By submitting Contributions to Terminals and tagging collaborators along the way, the Profiles will be further enriched and legitimized.\n\nThe rapidly increasing fidelity of on-chain social data, the increasing adoption of SSI wallets, and the increasing sophistication of contribution-driven tokenomics have inspired us to iterate quickly on the products and services to connect passengers to the places that will be most excited about the value they have to offer.\n\nFor example, someone with a $WRITE token who also mints poetry on Hic Et Nunc will be able to discover others with similar interests and projects that are looking for writers. Someone with a consistent POAP portfolio should be given higher priority consideration when protocols or DAOs evaluate the matriculation of new contributors.  Someone with a background in financial modeling and analysis should be given the opportunity to suggest improvements to protocol treasuries or token design mechanisms. And perhaps most importantly, newcomers will understand how and where to contribute in crypto, the paths others have taken, and what is possible for them if they do come on board.\n\n**Web3 is as much of a technological as it is a social movement.** As life migrated online during the pandemic, we saw a surge in crypto-related innovation, including the thrilling Defi summer and an abundance of new NFT projects and platforms. People collaborated in a frenzy on Discord and Telegram. We realized it was possible to coordinate people across the world. New kinds of work were enabled, along with newly crypto-enabled means for rewarding such contributions. Just like the four young planners on Lawrence Street in 1988 who were redesigning the city’s public transit system, the power lies with those who have the initiative and the desire to realize new opportunities for work and ownership.\n\n**We dream of a future of meaningful work for everybody.** We know this dream is audacious, but we also believe that it is tractable for the first time. We at Station are huddled, not in an old office in Brooklyn, but in a cozy corner of cyberspace. We’re studying the communities and natural desire paths of those arriving in crypto, and building infrastructure thoughtfully and joyfully in anticipation of the millions who will soon arrive asking for directions. We hope to not only hand them a map they can trust, but welcome them aboard and support them in whatever journey they take.\n\n**If this is a dream you’d like to be a part of, sign up for early access [here](http://station.express/).**\n\n**If you’re interested in contributing, please reach out [here](https://twitter.com/0xSTATION).**\n\nWith love,\n\nSTATION STAFF", "timestamp": 1630525635, "digest": "D0r869DJuky7fydeX6e6dR1Th5ukwRa6tNw1g2fuJv0", "contributor": "0x78918036a8e4B9179bEE3CAB57110A3397986E44"}

{"id": "8kI8dPHjtsa0Gz8GBJfXwCBgDpKf9Orglp4z2EZhO-o", "title": "Crypto's Consumer Era", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ec6478c7-7e84-4840-80b6-44a33a7b33c7.jpg?height=2080&width=3120)\n\nA few years ago it was common to hear the phrase, “we’re still waiting for crypto’s killer app.”\n\nCrypto markets weren’t quite ready for mainstream attention. The past five years of crypto were heavily focused on financial infrastructure and technological foundations.\n\nBut we’ve now experienced early product-market fit in DeFi, an explosion of projects like NBA Topshot, Axie Infinity, Cryptopunks and onboarded the first [\\~100M users](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/3rd-global-cryptoasset-benchmarking-study/) to crypto. **The next 100M crypto users will be driven by consumer protocols, DAOs and applications.**\n\nTraditional consumer has gone through a transformation in the past thirty years. Consumer was about the physical -  food, beverages, media and entertainment. But eventually, the internet offered a digital business model for everything physical. Consumers now access virtually any product or service with a few clicks. Consumer brands have vastly expanded their distribution and business economics due to the internet.\n\nSo what will define the next consumer transformation? Crypto. There are 3 major reasons why crypto is poised to do this:\n\n**Ownership**\n\nCrypto enables ownership from day one-- a powerful concept. For the first time, users can partake in the growth and success of the products and communities they are a part of, from the beginning. Ownership changes the model from extractive to additive. The main mechanism for ownership has been via tokens - whether they are fungible or non-fungible. Tokens offer users the ability to partake in governance, access user benefits, and more. Tokens turn users into advocates. Each additional user in a given network benefits alongside the entire network. Rather than providing content, time, attention for free, they are rewarded for making products and services successful.\n\n**24/7 Markets**\n\nSecond, is the nature of crypto markets. Crypto never sleeps. Similar to how the internet trained millions of users to fast instant community, 2-day delivery, and simple UX, crypto will train users to expect 24/7 markets. The past decade has seen exchanges like Coinbase and Binance grow a user base that’s come to expect 24/7 global markets. DeFi is accessible to anyone with an internet connection. We’re now taking this to the next level by making the internet ownable. Marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.com) provide exposure to non-fungible tokens at any time of day. Consumers are shifting expectations to meet this cadence.\n\n**Open Access**\n\nLastly, a defining pillar for crypto is around open global access. The internet turned e-commerce, advertising, and media into global all-consuming models. Advertisers are able to personalize and target users while social media launched the influencer career model. However, the beneficiaries of the internet continue to be limited to a smaller set of stakeholders. Geographical constraints will continue to fall away, giving users opportunities to work and play online in manners that weren’t previously available. The focus is now on the long tail of creators and communities.\n\n### But isn’t everything “Consumer”\n\nThe first decade of crypto was about finding our footing. We saw the highs and lows of an emerging asset class and a (still developing) smart contract ecosystem.\n\nWe still have a long way to go when it comes to scaling, infrastructure, and user experiences. But, I’m certain that we’re reached a point where narratives and stories will allow us to scale.\n\nUntil we shift away from our past shadows, it’ll be challenging to resonate with what’s to come. What’s better than telling? Showing.\n\nOver the next decade, we’ll start to see bottoms-up brands, business model reinvention, and community ownership take off. The consumer category in cry\\\\pto will create opportunities we haven’t even thought of yet.\n\nThe old rules do not apply and I’m excited to be a part of the new playbook. To make this more real, here are 5 breakout categories I’m watching:\n\n**1 | Curation-as-a-Service**\n\nThe internet made it so we are all consumers, creators and curators. As we are constantly reminded in our online lives - we are the product. Curation implies taste, and requires effort and skill to do so correctly. But that being said, we are all curators. We curate with our likes. We curate with our comments. We also curate via promotion. Sharing within our network and beyond. While the internet has created a business model around affiliate programs and links, ultimately, the curation space remains relatively [untapped.](https://gaby.mirror.xyz/LGrzJJbwV9ewhYAa7gcFYa2nxYlTWRH-SxmSuViEWA4)\n\n![Yup ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/555afede-69d8-442f-9809-d5559abc8d2d.png?height=1332&width=2152)\n\nWeb3 offers an opportunity to curate with clear financial incentives *and* social status. What once took place across blogs and newsletters will soon find ways to curate where you can tip creators, earn money via curation, and create massive economic graphs. For example, Yup, is a curation protocol that provides an opportunity for users to curate and build their influence accordingly. Collector DAOs are curating NFT investments and making a bet on the future success of these projects. Curation-focused products allow digital content to become organized irrespective of the platform it lives on. Social token design can create a system where users earn for curating content and split the benefits with both the curators and creators. Being early has always had value, but web3 allows you to benefit from it.\n\nNotable projects: [Yup](http://yup.io), [Bitclout](https://bitclout.com/), [Verse](https://neuroswish.mirror.xyz/2IlOa5B-eMCuSMTGjYq4lsdPRzOwqqIqy9XzHycsmrY)\n\n**2 | Social DAOs**\n\nSocial DAOs are [tokens backed by the reputation of an individual, brand, or community.](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-bull-case-for-social-tokens) These DAOs typically have the following structure: a shared mission or purpose, a strong community, and tokenized ownership. Web3, and more specifically tokenized incentives, allow for social communities to quantify their value and share in the upside.\n\n![FWB Dashboard](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8bfde67-be38-4c64-9b40-33a1817c1c34.png?height=1370&width=2878)\n\nToday, there are a few dozens of social token DAOs, with FWB taking center stage as the leading player. FWB, Friends with Benefits, provides a window into some of the coolest creators and thinkers in Web3. Together they’ve created a digital space that fosters conversation and translates that into digital and IRL events, editorial content and more. Infrastructure providers like Rally and Coinvise are providing the tools to allow these social token communities to thrive, with token infrastructure as well as creator support. It’s still early days for social token DAOs but I’m bullish this category will grow extensively in the coming decades.\n\nNotable projects: [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/), [Coinvise](https://www.coinvise.co/), [Rally](https://rally.io/)\n\n**3 | Play-to-Earn Games**\n\nPlay-to-earn games are the newest gaming business model to take the spotlight. Although the model has been for decades, blockchain applications are unlocking ways to earn and own in-game assets. Virtual in-game assets are plentiful but are confined to a one-way economy, where game publishers create and users buy. Despite spending millions on virtual assets, users ultimately have no ownership rights over these assets. With the play-to-earn category, users are working within games to earn in-game assets in the form of NFTs, tokens or otherwise. As more people play the game, the collective value increases while benefiting users. This introduces digital property rights, two-way markets, and in-game scarcity.\n\n![Axie Infinity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c314e7dc-605b-44d0-be25-4c1bf31071a0.png?height=576&width=1024)\n\nAxie Infinity is the most popular play-to-earn game in the blockchain world, with nearly [$500M](https://www.tokenterminal.com/) in protocol revenue generated to date. Yield Guild Games, is an organization of players, who all play games where they can earn in-game currency or assets. Play-to-earn games allow users to participate in the upside while growing the games they enjoy playing.\n\nNotable projects: [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [YGG](https://yieldguild.io/)\n\n**4 | Digital Spaces & Showcases**\n\n![JPG Gallery](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c34387ee-1761-4b15-a651-d07a8e561acc.png?height=668&width=1352)\n\nNFTs are a tool. They allow users to tell a story, share context, collaborate, raise funding and more. As NFTs become increasingly popular, the next question arises - where do we put them? As the concept of the metaverse takes off, I’m interested in digital spaces and showcases where users can share their NFTs, socialize with others and build deeper connections. Whether it is about incorporating virtual reality (like CryptoVoxels), developing museum style exhibits (JPG Gallery) or combining the physical and digital (CryptoVenetians) there are significant opportunities to explore.\n\nNotable projects: **[CryptoVoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/), [Super Rare Spaces](https://twitter.com/SuperRare/status/1430199846464536577), [CryptoVenetians](https://www.cryptovenetians.com/), [Gallery](https://gallery.so/), [JPG](https://jpg.space/)**\n\n**5 | Bottoms Up Brands**\n\nI’m fascinated by the concept of bottoms up brands. I define bottoms up brands as community driven, mission-oriented brands with distributed IP. This could be a particular type of PFP and the IP around it, products like PartyDAO or entertainment like Crypto Punk Comics. We’re in a world where communities are crowdsourcing product roadmaps, DAOs are spinning up to support a particular project and IP is becoming decentralized. Bored Apes Yacht Club, has done over $500M in GMV, and $100M + in revenue in a short four months.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef54fec0-9232-438d-9ac4-8e8ad8a5d2b1.png?height=411&width=601)\n\nLoot project, is another great example, of IP that starts in the hands of the community who then build games, avatars, media around the original IP that was distributed. Rather than having a team or a top-down vision, it’s entirely driven by the community of lootbag holders and supporters.\n\nThe success of a bottoms-up brand starts and ends with the community that supports it. Communities come together to make a particular product recognizable and known for something.\n\nNotable projects: **[PartyDAO](https://twitter.com/prtydao?lang=en), [Bored Apes Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/), [Loot](https://lootproject.com)**\n\nAs John discussed, Web3 changes the[ internet’s logic.](https://j.mirror.xyz/) In doing so, its turns users into owners, with an inventory of tokens, NFTs, communities that represent their online presence. Consumer brands will emerge from this landscape in new ways, economic graphs will be explored, and ultimately, participation will drive consumer adoption. These are simply a few examples of what the future will look like, but I imagine we’ve only scratched the surface.\n\nIf you’re building at the intersection of crypto x consumer, please [reach out!](https://twitter.com/_kinjalbshah?lang=en)\n\n*Many thanks to Cooper Turley and Brian Flynn for their feedback.*", "timestamp": 1630530172, "digest": "UpJ_v1fDH_gwNcC3ebSB3rXn544G77MlbbV5rJJF-u8", "contributor": "0xA5E1C37Ad90BAAcb791Cfa18506224D7c50f1619"}

They allow users to tell a story, share context, collaborate, raise funding and more. As NFTs become increasingly popular, the next question arises - where do we put them? As the concept of the metaverse takes off, I’m interested in digital spaces and showcases where users can share their NFTs, socialize with others and build deeper connections. Whether it is about incorporating virtual reality (like CryptoVoxels), developing museum style exhibits (JPG Gallery) or combining the physical and digital (CryptoVenetians) there are significant opportunities to explore.\n\nNotable projects: **[CryptoVoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/), [Super Rare Spaces](https://twitter.com/SuperRare/status/1430199846464536577), [CryptoVenetians](https://www.cryptovenetians.com/), [Gallery](https://gallery.so/), [JPG](https://jpg.space/)**\n\n**5 | Bottoms Up Brands**\n\nI’m fascinated by the concept of bottoms up brands. I define bottoms up brands as community driven, mission-oriented brands with distributed IP. This could be a particular type of PFP and the IP around it, products like PartyDAO or entertainment like Crypto Punk Comics. We’re in a world where communities are crowdsourcing product roadmaps, DAOs are spinning up to support a particular project and IP is becoming decentralized. Bored Apes Yacht Club, has done over $500M in GMV, and $100M + in revenue in a short four months.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ef54fec0-9232-438d-9ac4-8e8ad8a5d2b1.png?height=411&width=601)\n\nLoot project, is another great example, of IP that starts in the hands of the community who then build games, avatars, media around the original IP that was distributed. Rather than having a team or a top-down vision, it’s entirely driven by the community of lootbag holders and supporters.\n\nThe success of a bottoms-up brand starts and ends with the community that supports it. Communities come together to make a particular product recognizable and known for something.\n\nNotable projects: **[PartyDAO](https://twitter.com/prtydao?lang=en), [Bored Apes Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/), [Loot](https://lootproject.com)**\n\nAs John discussed, Web3 changes the[ internet’s logic.](https://j.mirror.xyz/) In doing so, its turns users into owners, with an inventory of tokens, NFTs, communities that represent their online presence. Consumer brands will emerge from this landscape in new ways, economic graphs will be explored, and ultimately, participation will drive consumer adoption. These are simply a few examples of what the future will look like, but I imagine we’ve only scratched the surface.\n\nIf you’re building at the intersection of crypto x consumer, please [reach out!](https://twitter.com/_kinjalbshah?lang=en)\n\n*Many thanks to Cooper Turley and Brian Flynn for their feedback.*", "timestamp": 1630530713, "digest": "UpJ_v1fDH_gwNcC3ebSB3rXn544G77MlbbV5rJJF-u8", "contributor": "0xA5E1C37Ad90BAAcb791Cfa18506224D7c50f1619"}
{"id": "ZF7E3cbEk7m75Zux1dKq70vjTAz1b5NXp_gXd8O2U0M", "title": "Crypto's Consumer Era", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ec6478c7-7e84-4840-80b6-44a33a7b33c7.jpg?height=2080&width=3120)\n\nA few years ago it was common to hear the phrase, “we’re still waiting for crypto’s killer app.”\n\nCrypto markets weren’t quite ready for mainstream attention. The past five years of crypto were heavily focused on financial infrastructure and technological foundations.\n\nBut we’ve now experienced early product-market fit in DeFi, an explosion of projects like NBA Topshot, Axie Infinity, Cryptopunks and onboarded the first [\\~100M users](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/3rd-global-cryptoasset-benchmarking-study/) to crypto. **The next 100M crypto users will be driven by consumer protocols, DAOs and applications.**\n\nTraditional consumer has gone through a transformation in the past thirty years. Consumer was about the physical -  food, beverages, media and entertainment. But eventually, the internet offered a digital business model for everything physical. Consumers now access virtually any product or service with a few clicks. Consumer brands have vastly expanded their distribution and business economics due to the internet.\n\nSo what will define the next consumer transformation? Crypto. There are 3 major reasons why crypto is poised to do this:\n\n**Ownership**\n\nCrypto enables ownership from day one-- a powerful concept. For the first time, users can partake in the growth and success of the products and communities they are a part of, from the beginning. Ownership changes the model from extractive to additive. The main mechanism for ownership has been via tokens - whether they are fungible or non-fungible. Tokens offer users the ability to partake in governance, access user benefits, and more. Tokens turn users into advocates. Each additional user in a given network benefits alongside the entire network. Rather than providing content, time, attention for free, they are rewarded for making products and services successful.\n\n**24/7 Markets**\n\nSecond, is the nature of crypto markets. Crypto never sleeps. Similar to how the internet trained millions of users to fast instant community, 2-day delivery, and simple UX, crypto will train users to expect 24/7 markets. The past decade has seen exchanges like Coinbase and Binance grow a user base that’s come to expect 24/7 global markets. DeFi is accessible to anyone with an internet connection. We’re now taking this to the next level by making the internet ownable. Marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.com) provide exposure to non-fungible tokens at any time of day. Consumers are shifting expectations to meet this cadence.\n\n**Open Access**\n\nLastly, a defining pillar for crypto is around open global access. The internet turned e-commerce, advertising, and media into global all-consuming models. Advertisers are able to personalize and target users while social media launched the influencer career model. However, the beneficiaries of the internet continue to be limited to a smaller set of stakeholders. Geographical constraints will continue to fall away, giving users opportunities to work and play online in manners that weren’t previously available. The focus is now on the long tail of creators and communities.\n\n### But isn’t everything “Consumer”\n\nThe first decade of crypto was about finding our footing. We saw the highs and lows of an emerging asset class and a (still developing) smart contract ecosystem.\n\nWe still have a long way to go when it comes to scaling, infrastructure, and user experiences. But, I’m certain that we’re reached a point where narratives and stories will allow us to scale.\n\nUntil we shift away from our past shadows, it’ll be challenging to resonate with what’s to come. What’s better than telling? Showing.\n\nOver the next decade, we’ll start to see bottoms-up brands, business model reinvention, and community ownership take off. The consumer category in crypto will create opportunities we haven’t even thought of yet. The outcome, I hope, will be one that is fairer and more equitable to all participants.\n\nThe old rules do not apply and I’m excited to be a part of the new playbook. To make this more real, here are 5 breakout categories I’m watching:\n\n**1 | Curation-as-a-Service**\n\nThe internet made it so we are all consumers, creators and curators. As we are constantly reminded in our online lives - we are the product. Curation implies taste, and requires effort and skill to do so correctly. But that being said, we are all curators. We curate with our likes. We curate with our comments. We also curate via promotion. Sharing within our network and beyond. While the internet has created a business model around affiliate programs and links, ultimately, the curation space remains relatively [untapped.](https://gaby.mirror.xyz/LGrzJJbwV9ewhYAa7gcFYa2nxYlTWRH-SxmSuViEWA4)\n\n![Yup ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/555afede-69d8-442f-9809-d5559abc8d2d.png?height=1332&width=2152)\n\nWeb3 offers an opportunity to curate with clear financial incentives *and* social status. What once took place across blogs and newsletters will soon find ways to curate where you can tip creators, earn money via curation, and create massive economic graphs. For example, Yup, is a curation protocol that provides an opportunity for users to curate and build their influence accordingly. Collector DAOs are curating NFT investments and making a bet on the future success of these projects. Curation-focused products allow digital content to become organized irrespective of the platform it lives on. Social token design can create a system where users earn for curating content and split the benefits with both the curators and creators. Being early has always had value, but web3 allows you to benefit from it.\n\nNotable projects: [Yup](http://yup.io), [Bitclout](https://bitclout.com/), [Verse](https://neuroswish.mirror.xyz/2IlOa5B-eMCuSMTGjYq4lsdPRzOwqqIqy9XzHycsmrY)\n\n**2 | Social DAOs**\n\nSocial DAOs are [tokens backed by the reputation of an individual, brand, or community.](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-bull-case-for-social-tokens) These DAOs typically have the following structure: a shared mission or purpose, a strong community, and tokenized ownership. Web3, and more specifically tokenized incentives, allow for social communities to quantify their value and share in the upside.\n\n![FWB Dashboard](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8bfde67-be38-4c64-9b40-33a1817c1c34.png?height=1370&width=2878)\n\nToday, there are a few dozens of social token DAOs, with FWB taking center stage as the leading player. FWB, Friends with Benefits, provides a window into some of the coolest creators and thinkers in Web3. Together they’ve created a digital space that fosters conversation and translates that into digital and IRL events, editorial content and more. Infrastructure providers like Rally and Coinvise are providing the tools to allow these social token communities to thrive, with token infrastructure as well as creator support. It’s still early days for social token DAOs but I’m bullish this category will grow extensively in the coming decades.\n\nNotable projects: [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/), [Coinvise](https://www.coinvise.co/), [Rally](https://rally.io/)\n\n**3 | Play-to-Earn Games**\n\nPlay-to-earn games are the newest gaming business model to take the spotlight. Although the model has been for decades, blockchain applications are unlocking ways to earn and own in-game assets. Virtual in-game assets are plentiful but are confined to a one-way economy, where game publishers create and users buy. Despite spending millions on virtual assets, users ultimately have no ownership rights over these assets. With the play-to-earn category, users are working within games to earn in-game assets in the form of NFTs, tokens or otherwise. As more people play the game, the collective value increases while benefiting users. This introduces digital property rights, two-way markets, and in-game scarcity.\n\n![Axie Infinity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c314e7dc-605b-44d0-be25-4c1bf31071a0.png?height=576&width=1024)\n\nAxie Infinity is the most popular play-to-earn game in the blockchain world, with nearly [$500M](https://www.tokenterminal.com/) in protocol revenue generated to date. Yield Guild Games, is an organization of players, who all play games where they can earn in-game currency or assets. Play-to-earn games allow users to participate in the upside while growing the games they enjoy playing.\n\nNotable projects: [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [YGG](https://yieldguild.io/)\n\n**4 | Digital Spaces & Showcases**\n\n![JPG Gallery](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c34387ee-1761-4b15-a651-d07a8e561acc.png?height=668&width=1352)\n\nNFTs are a tool. They allow users to tell a story, share context, collaborate, raise funding and more. As NFTs become increasingly popular, the next question arises - where do we put them? As the concept of the metaverse takes off, I’m interested in digital spaces and showcases where users can share their NFTs, socialize with others and build deeper connections. Whether it is about incorporating virtual reality (like CryptoVoxels), developing museum style exhibits (JPG Gallery) or combining the physical and digital (CryptoVenetians) there are significant opportunities to explore.\n\nNotable projects: **[CryptoVoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/), [Super Rare Spaces](https://twitter.com/SuperRare/status/1430199846464536577), [CryptoVenetians](https://www.cryptovenetians.com/), [Gallery](https://gallery.so/), [JPG](https://jpg.space/)**\n\n**5 | Bottoms Up Brands**\n\nI’m fascinated by the concept of bottoms up brands.

She spent most of her time creating and developing her own make-believe worlds in order to fill the empty space and distract her from familial absence.\n\nLiving at home wasn't easy. With her father unemployed and incapacitated, she picked up odd jobs like comic book making, waitressing, commercial and film acting to put food on the table. Never a day without hard work, being a multitasker and committing to versatility was and still is a key to her survival.\n\nUsing her skills and grit to push her artistic career further she’s worked with Academy Award-winning director Anders Walter and AcademyFilms directors Si & Ad and is on the board of judges for HER International Film Festival and Chroma International Film Festival. In order to connect with her local community, she has also appeared in The Irish Independent and RTÉ for her acting and modeling work.\n\n### No Regrets\n\n![No Regrets](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f5fac205-6070-471e-8431-8383fdc7ddd9.jpg?height=2048&width=1395)\n\n> *\"Look, I've never had a dream in my life*\n>\n> *Because a dream is what you wanna do, but still haven't pursued*\n>\n> *I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done*\n>\n> *So I've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!\"*\n>\n> \\- “No Regrets” by Aesop Rock\n\nDespite the hustle, she knew she had to reach further and learnt to support herself through her art internationally. She received a scholarship to study in UWC Changhsu, China at age 17 and promptly moved to China. There she began to polish her craft free from home and financial burden.\n\nChina brought forth new memories, new opportunities and new eyes. Using her background knowledge in acting and photography, she began directing her own films with kids from all around the world. Her first film ‘Wo Ai Ni Mama’, about a young Chinese girl exploring her sexuality, based on her own experiences in embracing her bisexuality, went on to receive awards across the globe and received [commercial distribution](https://www.filmin.pt/curta/wo-ai-ni-mama-i-love-you-mama) in China and Portugal.\n\nIt has also been praised by well-known film critic, João Lopez, in Portuguese newspaper [Diário de Notícias](https://www.dn.pt/edicao-do-dia/17-out-2020/da-china-com-amor-12929557.html) and got her two scholarships to New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts to study film.\n\n### Bridging Two Worlds\n\n> *Consider an estuary for a long moment. Imagine the rush of moving water pushing against the glittering banks of the Ural River. Following its snaking bends, as it struggles along the rocky terrain of sweet European mountains before gently depositing into warmer, damper and greener Asian marshes. Just as this complex torrent bridges two worlds, I live as the estuary where white blood meets brown.*\n\nAs a mixed kid, and a girl of seemingly many in-betweens, totality has never been the forefront of anything Maya stands for. In China, she started not only observing her own culture, but how the culture of others was woven into the fabric of their lives.\n\n> *Being an “in-between” makes me used to wriggling, fighting and confronting the idea of totality from the people that have tried to box me in at all sides.*\n\nHer fascination for culture also weaves itself into her art. Tracing back to her complex multicultural roots, her work aims to explore and shine a light on moments of tension. Between realities. Between identities. Between perspectives. Through her art, she wants the viewer to accept multifaceted truths of life.\n\n![In Between](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/926faabc-c34f-446c-ae7c-6a3bcf222dd6.jpg?height=1366&width=2048)\n\n## Hita’s Story\n\n> *I want to challenge the NFT art world with enticing experimental story-telling visuals that explore the human psyche inside and out.*\n\nBoston born, Anahita von Andrian-Werburg is a promising young German-Iranian filmmaker. Focused on influencing perceptions to bring awareness through her punchy multimedia photography & videography work, she hopes to bridge the gap between reality and imagination with her fluid approach to story-telling.\n\n![Anahita von Andrian](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/54f339ed-6cf8-49bc-951d-ad3c6769dc5b.JPG?height=1038&width=828)\n\n### The Come Up\n\nAnahita was raised in Boston, Massachusetts. As a multi-ethnic and third-culture child, with family spread out across much of the globe, she was fortunate to see much of the world at a young age. Language and culture fascinated her wherever she adventured. She is quadrilingual in German, Farsi, English, and French, and aspires to channel her experiences into the vital storytelling required to preserve the complexities and tensions within and between different cultures and perspectives.\n\nShe attended a British international School throughout her tween years, until she was accepted into a rigorously academic preparatory all-girls high-school in Boston. At age 16, she left home and moved abroad to live with her 80-year-old grandmother, an avid paintress, in Munich, where she attended a local German public school. From the colorful bustling bazaars of Shiraz, to the steady flow of Munich’s Isar river paradise, Anahita matured her appreciation for color, sound, and movement; elements now omnipresent in her visual work.\n\n### Venture into Film\n\nAnahita’s diverse mosaic of experiences and images left her yearning for a method of preservation and appreciation. She turned to writing, photography, and videography as her chosen method of documentation.\n\n![Omnipresent Visuals](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e26702e6-c371-4f46-8cb8-babda8767bed.JPG?height=5168&width=2912)\n\nDespite the lack of opportunity for any formal education in filmmaking, she was not deterred. In-between participating in competitive sports and rigorous academics, she spent the bulk of her free time researching filmmaking, and shooting as much content as possible. Her hard work paid off. At the age of 15, she launched her freelance videography and photography business and has since worked with an international selection of brands, companies, organizations, and individuals.\n\n### Documenting Realites\n\nAnahita was selected as one of three finalists out of an international pool of over 800+ female applicants to join the Beautiful Destinations Creative Agency in NYC as a *Capture Your Creativity* Campaign creator. She would later go on to direct, co-film, produce, and edit, *The Urban Wave,* a short Beautiful Destinations film centered around Munich’s urban surf culture and how it ties into Munich as a travel destination.\n\nShe expanded her love for music through her work with Live Nation Entertainment, where she shot, edited, and produced content on behalf of Live Nation Boston venues for musical artists such as Mason Ramsey and the Beach Fossils.\n\n![Climate Champion](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/31ead718-4ed2-4c6a-b842-f49818d7345b.JPG?height=1080&width=864)\n\nHer activism continued in her videography work for youth Climate Activism groups in Munich, where she spearheaded the media sector for the Friday’s For Future Student-Lead Climate Justice protests and in Boston, where she was a creative lead for the Boston Youth Climate Strike, and the national motion graphics co-director for the US Youth Climate Strike.\n\nShe is currently spearheading a profile film series for Voice In Sport, the first independent community-based platform for young female athletes, as an intern on their creative team.\n\nHer multidisciplinary approach to photography, with pieces primarily concerned with mental health, won her multiple Scholastic Arts awards, honors in curated galleries, and selection for VSCO Select’s contemporary publications.\n\n## Journey to the Metaverse\n\nAnahita (director) and Maya (creative art director) most recently collaborated on the creative ad campaign for MUZE Music Inc, an up-and-coming live music performance booking platform on Zoom. Just as the platform merges the physical and digital world for performers, their campaign did the same. Mind bending lighting, out-of-the box subject styling with UV makeup, and elaborate transitions made the campaign unique.\n\nBoth Maya and Anahita are currently second-year students at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. Studying and living in New York doesn’t come without a heavy price tag. Without concrete financial support, they are forced to create work with certain limitations.\n\nNFT’s not only give the duo a fighting chance to fuel their creative minds, but also are a gateway to helping them break down the barriers between physical and digital art, ultimately bridging two worlds and becoming major players in the new economy for digital art.\n\n![The Dynamic Duo](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2e2258c7-a90b-4f85-b4c0-9b5521438235.jpg?height=800&width=1600)\n\nMaya and Anahita are here to grind and aim to continue making work that shatters the boundaries of what is imaginable and unexpected. They want to give their audiences a complete mind-fuck sensory experience, challenging and contradicting a viewers comfortability with their existence, leaving them restless and wanting more.\n\nOn the horizon, Maya is working on a piece that explores how corporal movement can contribute to experimental narratives in a childhood mindscape. She sees herself becoming an artist who uses unusual forms of expression in her films to disrupt the rules of commercial narratives.\n\nAnahita has plans to develop her affinity for aesthetics and awareness-centered storytelling as an aspiring screenwriter, cinematographer, and director. She is currently pioneering a series of short pieces to show the stories behind the successes of some of US’s top female athletes.\n\n**Essentially, they are a dream team.**\n\nSo watch out. Together, they’re gonna play with your mind, play with your emotions and make you question what's real, forever preserved in the blockchain.

Focused on influencing perceptions to bring awareness through her punchy multimedia photography & videography work, she hopes to bridge the gap between reality and imagination with her fluid approach to storytelling.\n\n![Anahita von Andrian](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/54f339ed-6cf8-49bc-951d-ad3c6769dc5b.JPG?height=1038&width=828)\n\n### The Come Up\n\nAnahita was raised in Boston, Massachusetts. As a multi-ethnic and third-culture child with family spread out across much of the globe, she was fortunate to see much of the world at a young age. Language and culture fascinated her wherever she adventured. She is quadrilingual in German, Farsi, English, and French. She aspires to channel her experiences into the vital storytelling required to preserve the complexities and tensions within and between different cultures and perspectives.\n\nThroughout her tween years, she attended a British international school until she was accepted into a rigorously academic preparatory all-girls high school in Boston. At age 16, she left home and moved abroad to live with her 80-year-old grandmother, an avid paintress, in Munich, where she attended a local German public school. From Shiraz's colorful, bustling bazaars to the steady flow of Munich’s Isar river paradise, Anahita matured her appreciation for color, sound, and movement, elements now omnipresent in her visual work.\n\n### Venture into Film\n\nAnahita’s diverse mosaic of experiences and images left her yearning for a method of preservation and appreciation. She turned to writing, photography, and videography as her chosen method of documentation.\n\n![Omnipresent Visuals](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e26702e6-c371-4f46-8cb8-babda8767bed.JPG?height=5168&width=2912)\n\nDespite the lack of opportunity for any formal education in filmmaking, she was not deterred. In-between participating in competitive sports and rigorous academics, she spent most of her free time researching filmmaking and shooting as much content as possible. Her hard work paid off. At 15, she launched her freelance videography and photography business and has since worked with an international selection of brands, companies, organizations, and individuals.\n\n### Documenting Realities\n\nAnahita was selected as one of three finalists out of an international pool of over 800+ female applicants to join the Beautiful Destinations Creative Agency in NYC as a *Capture Your Creativity* Campaign creator. She would later direct, co-film, produce, and edit, *The Urban Wave,* a short Beautiful Destinations film centered around Munich’s urban surf culture and how it ties into Munich as a travel destination.\n\nShe expanded her love for music through her work with Live Nation Entertainment, where she shot, edited, and produced content on behalf of Live Nation Boston venues for musical artists such as Mason Ramsey and the Beach Fossils.\n\n![Climate Champion](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/31ead718-4ed2-4c6a-b842-f49818d7345b.JPG?height=1080&width=864)\n\nHer activism continued in her videography work for youth Climate Activism groups in Munich, where she spearheaded the media sector for the Friday’s For Future Student-Lead Climate Justice protests, and in Boston, where she was a creative lead for the Boston Youth Climate Strike, and the national motion graphics co-director for the US Youth Climate Strike.\n\nShe is currently spearheading a profile film series for Voice In Sport, the first independent community-based platform for young female athletes, as an intern on their creative team.\n\nHer multidisciplinary approach to photography, with pieces primarily concerned with mental health, won her multiple Scholastic Arts awards, honors in curated galleries, and selection for VSCO Select’s contemporary publications.\n\n## Journey to the Metaverse\n\nAnahita (director) and Maya (creative art director) most recently collaborated on the creative ad campaign for MUZE Music Inc, an up-and-coming live music performance booking platform on Zoom. Just as the platform merges the physical and digital world for performers, their campaign did the same. Mind-bending lighting, out-of-the-box subject styling with UV makeup, and elaborate transitions made the campaign unique.\n\nBoth Maya and Anahita are currently second-year students at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. Studying and living in New York doesn’t come without a heavy price tag. Without concrete financial support, they are forced to create work with certain limitations.\n\nNFT’s give the duo a fighting chance to fuel their creative minds and are a gateway to helping them break down the barriers between physical and digital art, ultimately bridging two worlds and becoming significant players in the new economy for digital art.\n\n![The Dynamic Duo](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2e2258c7-a90b-4f85-b4c0-9b5521438235.jpg?height=800&width=1600)\n\nMaya and Anahita are here to grind and aim to continue doing work that shatters the boundaries of what is imaginable and unexpected. They want to give their audiences a complete mind-fuck sensory experience, challenging and contradicting viewers' comfortability with their existence, leaving them restless and wanting more.\n\nOn the horizon, Maya is working on a piece that explores how corporal movement can contribute to experimental narratives in a childhood mindscape. She sees herself becoming an artist who uses unusual forms of expression in her films to disrupt the rules of commercial narratives.\n\nAnahita has plans to develop her affinity for aesthetics and awareness-centered storytelling as an aspiring screenwriter, cinematographer, and director. She is currently pioneering a series of short pieces to show the stories behind the successes of some of the US’s top female athletes.\n\n**Essentially, they are a dream team.**\n\nSo watch out. Together, this duo is gonna play with your mind, play with your emotions and make you question what's real, forever preserved in the blockchain.

Their joint mission - to bend your mind through moving paintings that blur the lines between reality and imagination. Their debut work on Glass, “Echo of the Maddened Marionette, “ will be put up for auction on **Wednesday, September 1 at 4 PM EST**.\n\n***Strung up by the invisible strings of deadly perfectionism, our marionette is left stuck in a broken timeline. “Echo Of The Maddened Marionette” delves into the psyche of a crazed ballerina, unveiling what lurks beneath her poised and elegant facade. The marionette constantly battles between her ideal self and the toll it takes to get there. This piece erases the borders between the opposing dimensions of her mental state.***\n\n![Echo of the Maddened Marionette](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d24de284-d4b7-4189-b28d-31a960464680.jpg?height=1365&width=2048)\n\n## Maya’s Story\n\n> *I want to make NFT art fit for the Louvre.*\n\nLondon-born Maya Peters is a young, up and coming, Irish-Indonesian filmmaker. Focused on blurring the lines between reality and imagination, she is an avid enthusiast of the visually spectacular.\n\n![Maya Peters](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/da15e399-cf3c-4b47-ab39-20f6cf307be8.jpg?height=2048&width=1365)\n\n### The Come Up\n\nGrowing up alone as an only child with a single dad, Maya was left to play with her imagination. She spent most of her time creating and developing her own make-believe worlds to fill the empty space and distract her from familial absence.\n\nLiving at home wasn't easy. With her father unemployed and incapacitated, she picked up odd jobs like comic bookmaking, waitressing, commercial, and film acting to put food on the table. Never a day without hard work, being a multitasker and committing to versatility was and still is a key to her survival.\n\nUsing her skills and grit to push her artistic career further, she’s worked with Academy Award-winning director Anders Walter and AcademyFilms directors Si & Ad. She is on the board of judges for HER International Film Festival and Chroma International Film Festival. To connect with her local community, she has also appeared in The Irish Independent and RTÉ for her acting and modeling work.\n\n### No Regrets\n\n![No Regrets](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f5fac205-6070-471e-8431-8383fdc7ddd9.jpg?height=2048&width=1395)\n\n> *\"Look, I've never had a dream in my life*\n>\n> *Because a dream is what you wanna do, but still haven't pursued*\n>\n> *I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done*\n>\n> *So I've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!\"*\n>\n> \\- “No Regrets” by Aesop Rock\n\nDespite the hustle, she knew she had to reach further and learned to support herself through her art internationally. She received a scholarship to study in UWC Changshu, China, at age 17 and promptly moved to China. There she began to polish her craft free from home and financial burden.\n\nChina brought forth new memories, new opportunities, and new eyes. Using her background knowledge in acting and photography, she began directing her own films with kids from all around the world. Her first film, ‘Wo Ai Ni Mama,’ about a young Chinese girl exploring her sexuality, based on her own experiences in embracing her bisexuality, received awards across the globe and received [commercial distribution](https://www.filmin.pt/curta/wo-ai-ni-mama-i-love-you-mama) in China and Portugal.\n\nIt has also been praised by well-known film critic João Lopez, in Portuguese newspaper [Diário de Notícias](https://www.dn.pt/edicao-do-dia/17-out-2020/da-china-com-amor-12929557.html) and got her two scholarships to New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts to study film.\n\n### Bridging Two Worlds\n\n> *Consider an estuary for a long moment.

De-risking launches**\n- Community Design de-risks the launch and go-to-market success of a new project or company. Not investing in community design is expensive. Without it, the founding team operates in a vacuum, with product and engineering devoid of a true feedback from the early 100 true fans. This only results in passive or utilitarian inclusion of the so called \"community\". \n\n**2. Metaverse vibe curation**\n- Community Design involves a smash up of architectural formats. It intersects social architecture, spatial design and behavioral psychology. Truly great community design involves crafting a unique feeling around a product and the holistic experience inside the metaverse. The feeling the community invokes needs to be inviting, supportive and expansive. It has to feel like family.\n\n**3. Community meme-making**\n- Inside each strong community lies a humming Meme factory that taps into the cultural zeitgeist. Part of the Community Design OS is recognizing that meme artistry + distribution is a core tool in the arsenal of growth tools. This goes beyond pixels and moon-centric dogs.

We believe it is absolutely in the DNA of community design methodology. \n\n\n**4. Contribution flywheel**\n- Great community design means shipping a product you know the community will value.

The more seen the community feels, the more potent the contribution flywheel. The stronger the flywheel, the higher the retention, the more vigorous the virality. \n\n\n**5. The *fingerspitzengefühl***\n- We love this sneaky little German word. It cuts to the core of community not being a 'one-size-fits-all' kind of play.

{"id": "dI4SZgTi1WJ_V1jHULSIO2KytqsZuwrqgIj0RZEG0Pc", "title": "On-chain Verified CAPTCHAs ", "body": "Recently the Gamebytes team ([@kanethomasDX](https://twitter.com/kanethomasDX), [@alex_williamsa](https://twitter.com/alex_williamsa), [@MoreJelly](https://twitter.com/MoreJelly), and [@JaredDowning_](https://twitter.com/JaredDowning_)) launched a fun experiment called The CAPTCHAs. The CAPTCHAs are a showcase for the concept of *on-chain verified CAPTCHAs,* meant to help prevent bots from participating in NFT drops. Go to the site and you're given a Captcha. Get the Captcha right and you mint the Captcha as an NFT. Get the Captcha wrong and the transaction reverts. To make the drop more interesting, we tried to make the Captchas look artistic.\n\nHere's an example of one:\n\n![](https://api.thecaptcha.art/images/1481)\n\n## Bot participation in NFT drops is a big problem\n\nAnyone that has participated in an NFT drop recently knows that bots are out of control. The typical flow of a hyped NFT drop these days includes bots buying large percentages of the drop, and then immediately dumping them on Opensea for quick profits. Economically this makes a lot of sense for the bots, but it sucks for the real people trying to participate.\n\nThe bots are exploiting the fact that the NFTs are underpriced. However, raising prices would price-out passionate community members, and there are certainly downsides to your whole community being only the highest bidders. Adidas knows that they can sell Yeezys for more than $220 each, but there are plenty of good reasons they don't. Recently Vitalik wrote an article titled *Alternatives to selling at below-market-clearing prices for achieving fairness (or community sentiment, or fun)***.**\n\n[https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1429272304530313218](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1429272304530313218)\n\nThe article focussed on novel ways in which NFT drops could be modified in order to allow more participants and ease gas wars. The core propositions are shifts in the financial engineering of the situation to get buyers in at the most correct market value for the item such that demand should be closer to supply, while also not pricing everyone out. All of his proposed methods are very interesting and should be explored, but they all start off with the same premise: \"Each participant (verified by proof-of-personhood) ...\". The [site](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/) he links to in reference to proof-of-personhood essentially allows users to tie their identity to an address by submitting a video of themselves with their address. Every method to thwart bots is going to be game-able, but this method is game-able in a particularly bad way; it only requires a one time fixed human effort cost. This is a task I could pay a couple hundred dollars for many people on Fiverr to do, who will never care that someone is using their identity for this purpose. Sure, there is a lot of effort involved, but the  payout of having hundreds of addresses treated as a white-listed real person on every NFT drop from now is worth many times that effort.\n\nThere is a lot to be learned from the sneaker community, who has dealt with this issue for quite some time. The first is that you must accept you're not going to stop the bots. The only thing you can do is make it harder for them over time. Right now what we have in the NFT community is the equivalent of if Adidas let anyone make an API request to their backend to buy a shoe on the next Yeezy drop. This would result in not a single real customer getting a shoe. The only reason real people can still even get NFTs during hyped drops is because there aren't enough bots buying, but as the market matures and more people realize the money to be made, this will change. In order to get the ball rolling on making it harder for these bots, we decided to start with the most basic form of person verification, the Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). While Web2 has advanced far past the humble Captcha, it's an easy win for Web3 to implement basic on-chain verified Captchas. No, these Captchas will not stop the shadowy super coder from pulling down the images and having them quickly solved by a group of people, but at least that's 100x more work than they have to do right now, and it looks a lot closer to what I have to do when I want to buy a bunch of Yeezys.\n\n### How? (Warning: contains some technical mumbo jumbo)\n\nThe goal of the this project was to put this idea out into the community to see if we can convince other projects to adopt similar methods. We've already had people in our DMs who run bots saying that this would make their lives harder, and even more encouraging have also received lots of great feedback on how to expand on this implementation. For the sake of more fully putting the idea out there I'd like to go over specifically how we made The CAPTCHAs. On a technical level, it's really nothing ground-breaking.\n\nWe wrote a javascript file that uses Canvas to draw shapes and letters and and returns an image to be uploaded to an off-chain host (we used AWS S3 in our case for the sake of quick prototyping, but it's the same process using something like IPFS). Another script then generated 10k random strings and fed them into the image creator. The Captcha's string and its token ID were used as seeds in the random generation of the properties of the image, such as the color palette, word obstructions, etc. After all the images had uploaded, all the solution strings were hashed using keccak256. Trying to store all of these hashes in the smart contract was where we hit our first barrier, realizing how expensive it is to store one kilobyte on the blockchain. Without getting too deep into the details, the cheapest way we figured was to store all of the hashes as a single Solidity bytes type and parse out the solution from the bytes based on the token IDs index when the verification happens. Still with 10k different hashes at 32 bytes each, this was going to cost way too much in storage, so we reduced each hash to only the first 2 bytes (4 characters). This technically makes it possible to scrape the input hashes and run a script in search of a string that just matches the hash. We didn't hype our launch up so there weren't people ready to break the doors down at a specific time, so the trade off of less bytes per hash was fine. For a more hotly anticipated drop, the extra cost of a couple Eth to add more bytes per hash should be trivial. On a technical level, nothing too crazy is going on here. When the user submits a transaction to the mint function, they send the token ID and the CAPTCHA solution. The only real difference from a standard NFT smart contract is that the CAPTCHA verification has to succeed before the mint goes through.\n\n## Problems with this approach\n\nBecause this space is very early, even the simplest of prevention methods will be enough to have most bots not waste their time, and just point their contracts at a drop that doesn't do this. That being said, there are some requirements / limitations involved with this this specific launch, but none that can't be worked through in the future. Here are some of the most obvious ones:\n\n**Token ID must be tied to CAPTCHA:**\n\nThe way a lot of these random drops work is that what NFT maps to which token ID is not known until after the drop is done, \"wen reveal\" is a common term you'll see in NFT discords. Most drops that work like that don't have users minting specific NFT tokens, so users submit their transaction and just get whatever token ID is next once their transaction processes. For this implementation of the Captchas each Captcha has to be tied to a specific token ID, so the current UX of just submitting the transaction doesn't work. If two people submit the same Captcha solution the one who's transaction is processed second will fail, even if there are still tokens left to be minted, and the user will have to be served another Captcha to try again. While it does require a change in the UX, this implementation could be applied to these types of drops where you come to a webpage and user is served a random token ID that you do your best to distribute evenly by keeping track in a Web2 database of which Captchas are being served and to how many people. That could look something like this: Mirror all transactions to a Web2 database / server. This will allow you to know on the front-end whether there is already an inflight captcha request that has the correct solution, and you can refrain from serving that one, or if a user has already been served that one give them a new one. Your Web2 database could be gamed by someone who submits lots of transactions with correct captchas with very low gas, but you can also mirror estimated times and disregard transactions that are going to be past some time threshold. This is a bit more complex, but it's certainly an option! We're also still thinking of more straightforward ways to do this, preferably all on-chain.\n\n**Check if solution is correct without wasting gas:**\n\nTechnically you can know prior to submitting the transaction if it's going to revert due to the Captcha being incorrect. This is actually not a bad thing, because you don't want your users wasting gas on incorrect attempts. As long as the bytes per hash is sufficiently long then a bot won't have enough time to find hash collisions anyway.\n\n**Front-running:**\n\nIf transactions are publicly broadcast, bots can simply front-run transactions. In a naive implementation this is an issue, but simply using a private RPC or Flashbot would solve this.\n\n## Reception\n\nWe really loved seeing everyone enjoying the minting process so much; Everyone seemed to deeply understand what we were trying to do and why it was cool, which was awesome! Here is a particularly good thread from [@jonwu_](https://twitter.com/jonwu_).\n\n[https://twitter.com/jonwu_/status/1432508451540791297?s=20](https://twitter.com/jonwu_/status/1432508451540791297?s=20)\n\nAnd here is a much appreciated shoutout from [@kevinrose](https://twitter.com/kevinrose)\n\n[https://twitter.com/kevinrose/status/1433155437512339574](https://twitter.com/kevinrose/status/1433155437512339574)\n\nUltimately we would just love to see more drops try to make bots lives harder, so if you're someone involved in NFT drops please get in touch! We'd like to see approaches like this more widely adopted and would love to talk.", "timestamp": 1630539377, "digest": "cpGDRviPUqnMhjr0iWu0zUBqAdO9CmNFdHWwcr0QHAw", "contributor": "0xd26Cc622697e8f6E580645094d62742EEc9bd4fc"}
