It is best if the host of the meeting can provide rapid tests so anyone who wants to arrive in advance of the meeting can get tested right there.\n\nIt is also the case that in each of the large in-person group meetings I have done in the last few weeks, there have been a few folks on video. I think that is likely to be the new normal for large meetings and it really helps to have great audio and video in the room so the people on the screen feel as much like they are in the room as possible.\n\nBut I must say that I am very happy and very relieved to be meeting in person again in large groups.

{"id": "IBELXKOoI20GoskSJug2E_BL-3fClyNDT0VqjNZkwRo", "title": "Announcing Multiplayer Mode, Cabin DAO's Season 2", "body": "### Your invitation to join us for Cabin DAO Season 2\n\nWe are excited to announce the general availability of [Season 2 Passports](https://creators.mirror.xyz/V7Ucba89-3qV9yFxj7Spj7YxjKAhc6TOd8nUcCp9n6k), your ticket to participating in the next season of Cabin DAO. Our Season 2 Proposal, “[Multiplayer Mode](https://creators.mirror.xyz/qMIwOwLxAmY9KV_wobNFOjFnzw3ZbVb5N_aD3vJgfBQ)”, builds on lessons from Season 1 by opening up our cabin to DAOs, squads, and guilds for one week stays.\n\nThese Passports are NFTs that can be purchased for 1 ETH and grant four people a weeklong stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/). Our modern [shipping container cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/cabins) has private bedroom suites, common living spaces, sunny decks, a stock tank pool, 150 mbps of dedicated bandwidth, and access to 28 acres of nature to explore:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/94feac46-73e1-4d97-b24b-7b811465cdfa.jpeg?height=667&width=1000)\n\nAs NFTs, these Passports are composable and connectible to the wonderful world of web3. Anyone can purchase a week at the cabin, which we believe are the first on-chain micro-leases.\n\nA group of friends could buy a Passport to finally work on a project they've been dreaming about. DAOs can buy Passports to host a team retreat, vote on which members can attend, or even to start their own DAO-sponsored residency (we'll help you with the application and voting processes!). Maybe someone gets fancy and starts a PartyBid to crowdfund a live streamed micro-conference. This is web3, who knows what happens next 🤷\n\nRead on to learn more about the passports and the benefits that come with purchasing one. If you’re ready to purchase a week-long stay at the cabins, scroll down to the bottom of this article.\n\n## What is Cabin DAO?\n\nCabin DAO is a group of independent online creators building a decentralized city.\n\nWe [invest in up-and-coming web3 talent](https://creators.mirror.xyz/qMIwOwLxAmY9KV_wobNFOjFnzw3ZbVb5N_aD3vJgfBQ) and connect them into a network of squads, guilds, and DAOs where they can contribute and grow. Entering web3 can feel like wandering through a dark forest without a map. We are a cabin in the woods where you can stop in for a drink and a warm bed, in the metaverse and IRL.\n\nThe metaverse is the best place to meet people and find your tribe. But reality is much higher bandwidth. Once you’ve made connections online, we believe in coming together in person to deepen relationships and experience the liminal space and time that leads to creative breakthroughs and the best conversations.\n\nOver time, we hope to grow from cabins to villages to [decentralized internet-first cities](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4). Passport sales will help fund this vision—we will use the proceeds to help fund construction of our next cabin village on site.\n\n## Where are we located?\n\nThe first node in our decentralized city is [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/), 28-acres of private land in the Texas Hill Country about 45 minutes outside of Austin. We are [located](https://www.creatorcabins.com/land) minutes away from Pedernales Falls State Park and have a seasonal creek, wildlife, and amazing stargazing on site. And, of course, real Texas BBQ a short drive away.\n\n## What comes with a Passport?\n\nEach Passport grants the holder a specific Monday - Sunday stay in our [four bedroom shipping container cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/cabins). Passports are transferable to others, but they are only valid for the week listed on the NFT. The cabins are located about 45 minutes outside of Austin, TX. If you fly into Austin and choose not to rent a car, we will arrange for one shuttle to pick up your group on Monday and return you to the airport on Sunday.\n\nCabin DAO's guild of engineers, artists, writers, and builders will be available to help support your group remotely. Each Passport holder will be airdropped 10 $CABIN upon arrival to keep or spend on DAO services. More $CABIN can be purchased, and Passport holders will have access to the Cabin DAO bounty board to list additional bounties in $CABIN or a token of their choice.\n\nIn addition to project support from the guild, we can provide on-site ancillary services for a fee, including pre-stocked groceries, day trips (vineyard tours, state park outings, adventures in Austin), and facilitated group sessions.\n\n## When are Passports available?\n\nStarting today, we are releasing Season 2 Passports for each week (Monday - Sunday) from January 3rd - March 27th. Check-in starts at 3pm on Monday and check-out is by 12pm on Sunday. If you want to stay for multiple weeks, you can buy consecutive NFTs.\n\nYou can buy Passports now to reserve your week(s) of choice. Any weeks that aren’t sold will be used by Cabin DAO to run our free residency program for independent online creators (subsidized by Passport purchases!).\n\n## Who can buy a passport?\n\nAnyone who is vaccinated against COVID-19 and able to make it to Austin, TX for their weeklong stay. The cabin has four private bedroom suites, which can each support an individual or couple. Unfortunately, we aren’t able to host dogs in the cabin.\n\n## Who is this for?\n\nIn addition to the requirements and guidelines listed in Who can buy a passport?, we expect this program will be really great for DAOs, guilds, and squads that have worked together remotely for a period of time and would like to benefit from the high-bandwidth nature of IRL collaboration.\n\nWe would love to see all different kinds of projects and groups use the cabins. Some examples of projects and teams we think will work well in this type setting are:\n\n* A team working on a creative NFT project that wants to spend the last week(s) before launch collaborating IRL\n* A DAO’s leadership team that wants to spend a week brainstorming their next year’s roadmap at a whiteboard, on a long walk, or in the stock tank pool\n* A squad that wants to come together to work on a project in person\n* A creative team (podcast, video production, artist, or otherwise) that wants to spend a week dedicated to content creation\n\n## What happens after I buy a Passport?\n\nJoin our [discord server](https://discord.gg/xZtz5JfGUB) and introduce yourself. Then head over to the \\`#🛂 passport\\` channel, where we can answer questions and help you plan your trip. Cabin DAO can help figure out where to plug in and support your team, from stocking groceries to helping develop your governance systems.\n\nAfter the week, the NFT remains yours as a memento of your time at the cabins.\n\n## Week 1: January 3rd to January 9th, 2020\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=273](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=273)\n\n## Week 2: January 10th to January 16th, 2020\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=274](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=274)\n\n## Week 3: January 17th to January 23rd, 2020\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=275](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=275)\n\n## Week 4: January 24th to January 30th, 2020\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=276](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=276)\n\n## Week 5: January 31st to February 6th, 2020\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=277](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=277)\n\n## Week 6: February 7th to February 13th, 2020\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=278](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=278)\n\n## Week 7: February 14th to February 20th, 2020\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=279](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=279)\n\n## Week 8: February 21st to February 27th, 2020\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=280](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=280)\n\n## Week 9: February 28th to March 6th, 2020\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=281](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=281)\n\n## Week 10: March 7th to March 13th, 2020\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=282](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=282)\n\n## Week 11: March 14th to March 20th, 2020\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=283](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=283)\n\n## Week 12: March 21st to March 27th, 2020\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=284](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=284)\n\n", "timestamp": 1631665958, "digest": "wY-a-RYJ7Av2YnaSZ0vM8s5dsIhXC9PXDOBftBJRA1g", "contributor": "0xC3268DDB8E38302763fFdC9191FCEbD4C948fe1b"}
{"id": "tuL7iM3sJm_-NWlhUjZDkibtidMzkeqmegNRntU18iE", "title": "Announcing Multiplayer Mode, Cabin DAO's Season 2", "body": "### Your invitation to join us for Cabin DAO Season 2\n\nWe are excited to announce the general availability of [Season 2 Passports](https://creators.mirror.xyz/V7Ucba89-3qV9yFxj7Spj7YxjKAhc6TOd8nUcCp9n6k), your ticket to participating in the next season of Cabin DAO. Our Season 2 Proposal, “[Multiplayer Mode](https://creators.mirror.xyz/qMIwOwLxAmY9KV_wobNFOjFnzw3ZbVb5N_aD3vJgfBQ)”, builds on lessons from Season 1 by opening up our cabin to DAOs, squads, and guilds for one week stays.\n\nThese Passports are NFTs that can be purchased for 1 ETH and grant four people a weeklong stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/). Our modern [shipping container cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/cabins) has private bedroom suites, common living spaces, sunny decks, a stock tank pool, 150 mbps of dedicated bandwidth, and access to 28 acres of nature to explore:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/94feac46-73e1-4d97-b24b-7b811465cdfa.jpeg?height=667&width=1000)\n\nAs NFTs, these Passports are composable and connectible to the wonderful world of web3. Anyone can purchase a week at the cabin, which we believe are the first on-chain micro-leases.\n\nA group of friends could buy a Passport to finally work on a project they've been dreaming about. DAOs can buy Passports to host a team retreat, vote on which members can attend, or even to start their own DAO-sponsored residency (we'll help you with the application and voting processes!). Maybe someone gets fancy and starts a PartyBid to crowdfund a live streamed micro-conference. This is web3, who knows what happens next 🤷\n\nRead on to learn more about the passports and the benefits that come with purchasing one. If you’re ready to purchase a week-long stay at the cabins, scroll down to the bottom of this article.\n\n## What is Cabin DAO?\n\nCabin DAO is a group of independent online creators building a decentralized city.\n\nWe [invest in up-and-coming web3 talent](https://creators.mirror.xyz/qMIwOwLxAmY9KV_wobNFOjFnzw3ZbVb5N_aD3vJgfBQ) and connect them into a network of squads, guilds, and DAOs where they can contribute and grow. Entering web3 can feel like wandering through a dark forest without a map. We are a cabin in the woods where you can stop in for a drink and a warm bed, in the metaverse and IRL.\n\nThe metaverse is the best place to meet people and find your tribe. But reality is much higher bandwidth. Once you’ve made connections online, we believe in coming together in person to deepen relationships and experience the liminal space and time that leads to creative breakthroughs and the best conversations.\n\nOver time, we hope to grow from cabins to villages to [decentralized internet-first cities](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4). Passport sales will help fund this vision—we will use the proceeds to help fund construction of our next cabin village on site.\n\n## Where are we located?\n\nThe first node in our decentralized city is [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/), 28-acres of private land in the Texas Hill Country about 45 minutes outside of Austin. We are [located](https://www.creatorcabins.com/land) minutes away from Pedernales Falls State Park and have a seasonal creek, wildlife, and amazing stargazing on site. And, of course, real Texas BBQ a short drive away.\n\n## What comes with a Passport?\n\nEach Passport grants the holder a specific Monday - Sunday stay in our [four bedroom shipping container cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/cabins). Passports are transferable to others, but they are only valid for the week listed on the NFT. The cabins are located about 45 minutes outside of Austin, TX. If you fly into Austin and choose not to rent a car, we will arrange for one shuttle to pick up your group on Monday and return you to the airport on Sunday.\n\nCabin DAO's guild of engineers, artists, writers, and builders will be available to help support your group remotely. Each Passport holder will be airdropped 10 $CABIN upon arrival to keep or spend on DAO services. More $CABIN can be purchased, and Passport holders will have access to the Cabin DAO bounty board to list additional bounties in $CABIN or a token of their choice.\n\nIn addition to project support from the guild, we can provide on-site ancillary services for a fee, including pre-stocked groceries, day trips (vineyard tours, state park outings, adventures in Austin), and facilitated group sessions.\n\n## When are Passports available?\n\nStarting today, we are releasing Season 2 Passports for each week (Monday - Sunday) from January 3rd - March 27th. Check-in starts at 3pm on Monday and check-out is by 12pm on Sunday. If you want to stay for multiple weeks, you can buy consecutive NFTs.\n\nYou can buy Passports now to reserve your week(s) of choice. Any weeks that aren’t sold will be used by Cabin DAO to run our free residency program for independent online creators (subsidized by Passport purchases!).\n\n## Who can buy a passport?\n\nAnyone who is vaccinated against COVID-19 and able to make it to Austin, TX for their weeklong stay. The cabin has four private bedroom suites, which can each support an individual or couple. Unfortunately, we aren’t able to host dogs in the cabin.\n\n## Who is this for?\n\nIn addition to the requirements and guidelines listed in Who can buy a passport?, we expect this program will be really great for DAOs, guilds, and squads that have worked together remotely for a period of time and would like to benefit from the high-bandwidth nature of IRL collaboration.\n\nWe would love to see all different kinds of projects and groups use the cabins. Some examples of projects and teams we think will work well in this type setting are:\n\n* A team working on a creative NFT project that wants to spend the last week(s) before launch collaborating IRL\n* A DAO’s leadership team that wants to spend a week brainstorming their next year’s roadmap at a whiteboard, on a long walk, or in the stock tank pool\n* A squad that wants to come together to work on a project in person\n* A creative team (podcast, video production, artist, or otherwise) that wants to spend a week dedicated to content creation\n\n## What happens after I buy a Passport?\n\nJoin our [discord server](https://discord.gg/xZtz5JfGUB) and introduce yourself.

Our Season 2 Proposal, “[Multiplayer Mode](https://creators.mirror.xyz/qMIwOwLxAmY9KV_wobNFOjFnzw3ZbVb5N_aD3vJgfBQ)”, builds on lessons from Season 1 by opening up our cabin to DAOs, squads, and guilds for one week stays.\n\nThese Passports are NFTs that can be purchased for 1 ETH and grant four people a weeklong stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/). Our modern [shipping container cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/cabins) has private bedroom suites, common living spaces, sunny decks, a stock tank pool, 150 mbps of dedicated bandwidth, and access to 28 acres of nature to explore:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/94feac46-73e1-4d97-b24b-7b811465cdfa.jpeg?height=667&width=1000)\n\nAs NFTs, these Passports are composable and connectible to the wonderful world of web3. Anyone can purchase a week at the cabin, which we believe are the first on-chain micro-leases.\n\nA group of friends could buy a Passport to finally work on a project they've been dreaming about. DAOs can buy Passports to host a team retreat, vote on which members can attend, or even to start their own DAO-sponsored residency (we'll help you with the application and voting processes!). Maybe someone gets fancy and starts a PartyBid to crowdfund a live streamed micro-conference. This is web3, who knows what happens next 🤷\n\nRead on to learn more about the passports and the benefits that come with purchasing one. If you’re ready to purchase a week-long stay at the cabins, scroll down to the bottom of this article.\n\n## What is Cabin DAO?\n\nCabin DAO is a group of independent online creators building a decentralized city.\n\nWe [invest in up-and-coming web3 talent](https://creators.mirror.xyz/qMIwOwLxAmY9KV_wobNFOjFnzw3ZbVb5N_aD3vJgfBQ) and connect them into a network of squads, guilds, and DAOs where they can contribute and grow. Entering web3 can feel like wandering through a dark forest without a map. We are a cabin in the woods where you can stop in for a drink and a warm bed, in the metaverse and IRL.\n\nThe metaverse is the best place to meet people and find your tribe. But reality is much higher bandwidth. Once you’ve made connections online, we believe in coming together in person to deepen relationships and experience the liminal space and time that leads to creative breakthroughs and the best conversations.\n\nOver time, we hope to grow from cabins to villages to [decentralized internet-first cities](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4). Passport sales will help fund this vision—we will use the proceeds to help fund construction of our next cabin village on site.\n\n## Where are we located?\n\nThe first node in our decentralized city is [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/), 28-acres of private land in the Texas Hill Country about 45 minutes outside of Austin. We are [located](https://www.creatorcabins.com/land) minutes away from Pedernales Falls State Park and have a seasonal creek, wildlife, and amazing stargazing on site. And, of course, real Texas BBQ a short drive away.\n\n## What comes with a Passport?\n\nEach Passport grants the holder a specific Monday - Sunday stay in our [four bedroom shipping container cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/cabins). Passports are transferable to others, but they are only valid for the week listed on the NFT. The cabins are located about 45 minutes outside of Austin, TX. If you fly into Austin and choose not to rent a car, we will arrange for one shuttle to pick up your group on Monday and return you to the airport on Sunday.\n\nCabin DAO's guild of engineers, artists, writers, and builders will be available to help support your group remotely. Each Passport holder will be airdropped 10 $CABIN upon arrival to keep or spend on DAO services. More $CABIN can be purchased, and Passport holders will have access to the Cabin DAO bounty board to list additional bounties in $CABIN or a token of their choice.\n\nIn addition to project support from the guild, we can provide on-site ancillary services for a fee, including pre-stocked groceries, day trips (vineyard tours, state park outings, adventures in Austin), and facilitated group sessions.\n\n## When are Passports available?\n\nStarting today, we are releasing Season 2 Passports for each week (Monday - Sunday) from January 3rd - March 27th. Check-in starts at 3pm on Monday and check-out is by 12pm on Sunday. If you want to stay for multiple weeks, you can buy consecutive NFTs.\n\nYou can buy Passports now to reserve your week(s) of choice. Any weeks that aren’t sold will be used by Cabin DAO to run our free residency program for independent online creators (subsidized by Passport purchases!).\n\n## Who can buy a passport?\n\nAnyone who is vaccinated against COVID-19 and able to make it to Austin, TX for their weeklong stay. The cabin has four private bedroom suites, which can each support an individual or couple. Unfortunately, we aren’t able to host dogs in the cabin.\n\n## Who is this for?\n\nIn addition to the requirements and guidelines listed in Who can buy a passport?, we expect this program will be really great for DAOs, guilds, and squads that have worked together remotely for a period of time and would like to benefit from the high-bandwidth nature of IRL collaboration.\n\nWe would love to see all different kinds of projects and groups use the cabins. Some examples of projects and teams we think will work well in this type setting are:\n\n* A team working on a creative NFT project that wants to spend the last week(s) before launch collaborating IRL\n* A DAO’s leadership team that wants to spend a week brainstorming their next year’s roadmap at a whiteboard, on a long walk, or in the stock tank pool\n* A squad that wants to come together to work on a project in person\n* A creative team (podcast, video production, artist, or otherwise) that wants to spend a week dedicated to content creation\n\n## What happens after I buy a Passport?\n\nJoin our [discord server](https://discord.gg/xZtz5JfGUB) and introduce yourself.

Some examples of projects and teams we think will work well in this type setting are:\n\n* A team working on a creative NFT project that wants to spend the last week(s) before launch collaborating IRL\n* A DAO’s leadership team that wants to spend a week brainstorming their next year’s roadmap at a whiteboard, on a long walk, or in the stock tank pool\n* A squad that wants to come together to work on a project in person\n* A creative team (podcast, video production, artist, or otherwise) that wants to spend a week dedicated to content creation\n\n## What happens after I buy a Passport?\n\nJoin our [discord server](https://discord.gg/xZtz5JfGUB) and introduce yourself. Then head over to the \\`#🛂 passport\\` channel, where we can answer questions and help you plan your trip. Cabin DAO can help figure out where to plug in and support your team, from stocking groceries to helping develop your governance systems.\n\nAfter the week, the NFT remains yours as a memento of your time at the cabins.\n\n## Week 1: January 3rd to January 9th, 2022\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=273](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=273)\n\n## Week 2: January 10th to January 16th, 2022\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=274](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=274)\n\n## Week 3: January 17th to January 23rd, 2022\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=275](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=275)\n\n## Week 4: January 24th to January 30th, 2022\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=276](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=276)\n\n## Week 5: January 31st to February 6th, 2022\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=277](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=277)\n\n## Week 6: February 7th to February 13th, 2022\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=278](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=278)\n\n## Week 7: February 14th to February 20th, 2022\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=279](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=279)\n\n## Week 8: February 21st to February 27th, 2022\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=280](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=280)\n\n## Week 9: February 28th to March 6th, 2022\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=281](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=281)\n\n## Week 10: March 7th to March 13th, 2022\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=282](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=282)\n\n## Week 11: March 14th to March 20th, 2022\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=283](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=283)\n\n## Week 12: March 21st to March 27th, 2022\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=284](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=284)\n\n", "timestamp": 1631722170, "digest": "wY-a-RYJ7Av2YnaSZ0vM8s5dsIhXC9PXDOBftBJRA1g", "contributor": "0xC3268DDB8E38302763fFdC9191FCEbD4C948fe1b"}

{"id": "aHSNlEf9qQJMZqQaVUDoSnKTzwesbM7SwoiwVaEKITc", "title": "Reflections on curating with diversity for a newsletter", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6555e480-da33-42d5-9dba-5896e9e80584.jpg?height=1200&width=2400&size=medium)\n\nSince June, I’ve been contributing to a small newsletter called “[Cup of NFT](https://cupofnft.com/)”, where we feature the latest happenings in the NFT space. On every issue, we feature one artist that we think is super cool.\n\nWhen I got the gig, I personally have a mission to feature various kinds of art styles or mediums. I, personally, don’t want to just see 3D renders forever looping as they move, something that I personally can’t create… *yet*. I do graphic design, so most of my works are text-heavy posters possibly mixed with stock photo or illustrations. I don’t illustrate. I don’t do 3D renders. I don’t see myself in the space (yet), and I don’t want others to feel the same.\n\n### What am I currently doing\n\nI place all the artists I feature on a spreadsheet, and what kind of art do they make as an NFT. I also check and write from which countries do these artists come from. Not only do I want to be the kinds of artworks being made into NFTs be diverse, but also the people that we feature.\n\nI am proud to say that I’ve featured artists from Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. These artists have covered fields like photography, dancing, graphic design, watercolor, illustrations, doodles, and more.\n\nTo see who I have featured on the newsletter, you may check out my collection on Yup.\n\n[https://app.yup.io/collections/cup-of-nft-featured-artists/T4FRpxn](https://app.yup.io/collections/cup-of-nft-featured-artists/T4FRpxn)\n\nYou may also scroll to the last part of this post to see their works.\n\n*Note: I have yet to check out the 18 issues sent before I entered the picture, and a couple more issues while I was already in Cup.*\n\n## Some things I’ve noticed or I reflected on\n\n### Types of Media\n\nI haven’t featured any music or video NFTs. For music, I think it will be just like sharing a song I like that I discovered on Spotify. For video, I’m looking for longer videos, not your usual 3D render loops or 10-second clips. JPEGs, PNGs, and GIFs had their spotlight for so long.\n\n### Platforms\n\nAll of the artists I’ve featured, I discovered through Foundation or Showtime. Just being able to follow people on the platform where you saw them is a great way for me to “bookmark” these artists.\n\nIt just happens to be a coincidence when we feature an artist that’s on H=N. It’s just not a platform that I check out. Although, thinking about it, I should… as well as with other marketplaces on different networks like Polygon, NEAR, and Flow. If I am in a position where I can possibly make an artist’s first sale through featuring them, I might as well do that for artists who have less capital.\n\n### What we can do better\n\nWith the various kinds of media and platforms to check out and feature, we must give more space for creators and not just limit it to one. Maybe we can start off with having one artist from various networks, or one from each kind of media (photo, video, music, graphics).\n\nFeaturing more artists may sound like an easy solution, but it isn’t if you’re just two people doing the newsletter with other parts to work on as well. I think that we should get more people to contribute, even if it’s just with the artist feature part, maybe representing a certain network or marketplace. But now, the problem is compensation.\n\nI personally am being paid for my contributions for the newsletter, and I don’t really mind not being paid. I’m working on other projects in the space and those are the ones paying the bills. Privilege checked, I am pretty aware that this isn’t the case for everyone.\n\nAs much as I want to feature more artists and get more people to contribute and provide a different perspective, we can’t sustain that when our newsletter is free.\n\nWe’ve had some donations through Gitcoin, and I’m guessing that some of the money that I’m being paid with came from that, but the donations we got can’t even sustain getting more people too.\n\n### Send help!\n\nWe’d love to know what you think about the newsletter! If you’re not subscribed to Cup of NFT, [why not try it out](https://cupofnft.com/)? And if you’ve been checking out the past issue, do give us some feedback!\n\nWe’re thinking of keeping the news part bulleted and not have a cover story, in exchange of featuring more artists. As a reader, do you want to see more artist features? Should we get rid of other parts in exchange of that? Should we consider doing an NFT crowdfund or a sponsorship NFT to generate revenue?

{"id": "m4GEsgRzQNxep5uUZWvBycsc444DbkoPHmO63C_52OA", "title": "Reflections on curating with diversity for a newsletter", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6555e480-da33-42d5-9dba-5896e9e80584.jpg?height=1200&width=2400&size=medium)\n\nSince June, I’ve been contributing to a small newsletter called “[Cup of NFT](https://cupofnft.com/)”, where we feature the latest happenings in the NFT space. On every issue, we feature one artist that we think is super cool.\n\nWhen I got the gig, I personally have a mission to feature various kinds of art styles or mediums. I, personally, don’t want to just see 3D renders forever looping as they move, something that I personally can’t create… *yet*. I do graphic design, so most of my works are text-heavy posters possibly mixed with stock photo or illustrations. I don’t illustrate. I don’t do 3D renders. I don’t see myself in the space (yet), and I don’t want others to feel the same.\n\n### What am I currently doing\n\nI place all the artists I feature on a spreadsheet, and what kind of art do they make as an NFT. I also check and write from which countries do these artists come from. Not only do I want to be the kinds of artworks being made into NFTs be diverse, but also the people that we feature.\n\nI am proud to say that I’ve featured artists from Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. These artists have covered fields like photography, dancing, graphic design, watercolor, illustrations, doodles, and more.\n\nTo see who I have featured on the newsletter, you may check out my collection on Yup.\n\n[https://app.yup.io/collections/cup-of-nft-featured-artists/T4FRpxn](https://app.yup.io/collections/cup-of-nft-featured-artists/T4FRpxn)\n\nYou may also scroll to the last part of this post to see their works.\n\n*Note: I have yet to check out the 18 issues sent before I entered the picture, and a couple more issues while I was already in Cup.*\n\n## Some things I’ve noticed or I reflected on\n\n### Types of Media\n\nI haven’t featured any music or video NFTs. For music, I think it will be just like sharing a song I like that I discovered on Spotify. For video, I’m looking for longer videos, not your usual 3D render loops or 10-second clips. JPEGs, PNGs, and GIFs had their spotlight for so long.\n\n### Platforms\n\nAll of the artists I’ve featured, I discovered through Foundation or Showtime. Just being able to follow people on the platform where you saw them is a great way for me to “bookmark” these artists.\n\nIt just happens to be a coincidence when we feature an artist that’s on H=N. It’s just not a platform that I check out. Although, thinking about it, I should… as well as with other marketplaces on different networks like Polygon, NEAR, and Flow. If I am in a position where I can possibly make an artist’s first sale through featuring them, I might as well do that for artists who have less capital.\n\n### What we can do better\n\nWith the various kinds of media and platforms to check out and feature, we must give more space for creators and not just limit it to one. Maybe we can start off with having one artist from various networks, or one from each kind of media (photo, video, music, graphics).\n\nFeaturing more artists may sound like an easy solution, but it isn’t if you’re just two people doing the newsletter with other parts to work on as well. I think that we should get more people to contribute, even if it’s just with the artist feature part, maybe representing a certain network or marketplace. But now, the problem is compensation.\n\nI personally am being paid for my contributions for the newsletter, and I don’t really mind not being paid. I’m working on other projects in the space and those are the ones paying the bills. Privilege checked, I am pretty aware that this isn’t the case for everyone.\n\nAs much as I want to feature more artists and get more people to contribute and provide a different perspective, we can’t sustain that when our newsletter is free.\n\nWe’ve had some donations through Gitcoin, and I’m guessing that some of the money that I’m being paid with came from that, but the donations we got can’t even sustain getting more people too.\n\n### Send help!\n\nWe’d love to know what you think about the newsletter! If you’re not subscribed to Cup of NFT, [why not try it out](https://cupofnft.com/)? And if you’ve been checking out the past issue, do give us some feedback!\n\nWe’re thinking of keeping the news part bulleted and not have a cover story, in exchange of featuring more artists. As a reader, do you want to see more artist features? Should we get rid of other parts in exchange of that? Should we consider doing an NFT crowdfund or a sponsorship NFT to generate revenue? We have so many questions, so feel free to send us your thoughts!\n\nYou may DM us on Twitter [@0xElle](https://twitter.com/0xElle/), [@belGIANgwaffles](https://twitter.com/belgiangwaffles), and/or [@cupofnft](https://twitter.com/cupofnft/)!\n\nAnyways, that’s the end of this post.

{"id": "_Dy3V_-qHbPrcVvUOmc1WGzcXM0PiZdvTvQNUKD_7FA", "title": "Unbundling social token economics, governance, and access", "body": "If you look at the[ social DAO landscape](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw), you’ll see communities with different social token models. Some, like FWB, use a fungible social token to gate community access. Many emerging PFP-based communities like BAYC use NFTs as the primary community gating mechanism. Whether fungible or non-fungible, social tokens in DAOs usually represent three different but overlapping roles:\n\n* Economic value\n* Governance rights\n* Membership & access\n\nShould all three of these roles be represented by a single token? Which of them are a better match for fungible and non-fungible tokens?\n\n**Economic value** is the simplest to reason about. While NFTs can store tremendous economic value, they are inherently illiquid. Barter economies based on non-fungible assets inevitably get replaced by much more liquid economies denominated in a common fungible token. You don’t trade a house (illiquid, non-fungible), you sell it in your local currency (liquid, fungible) before buying a different one. Fungible tokens used by communities as a medium of exchange for goods and services represents an[ incredible opportunity to build new economies](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1429585831899983876).\n\n**Governance rights** face similar challenges with both fungible and non-fungible tokens: ownership naturally tends to have a power-law distribution so the question becomes: what do you do about whales? This[ recent essay by Vitalik](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) paints a clear picture for why this will become an increasingly problematic issue for DAOs, both in terms of incentive misalignment and vulnerability to attacks.\n\nThere are essentially three ways to deal with the whale problem:\n\n1. *Accept them*: treat the[ skin-in-the-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_(phrase)) of asset ownership as a feature instead of a bug\n2. *Minimize them*: use[ quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) to reduce their power in votes\n3. *Eliminate them*: implement some sort of[ proof-of-humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) mechanism to limit people to one-person-one-vote\n\nIf you go down the “accept” or “minimize” routes, fungible tokens are better suited for governance. If you want to implement tighter controls to minimize or eliminate whales, non-fungible tokens (particularly with sybil-resistant proof-of-humanity) can be better.\n\n**Membership & access** can be managed with fungible and non-fungible assets, or any combination of them. Ultimately though, access becomes increasingly non-fungible or loses meaning. To take an extreme example, if a token is infinitely divisible and any quantity grants you access, a single token can grant access to everyone in the world. To get around this, ERC-20 gated communities like FWB have a minimum required number of tokens you have to hold.\n\nIn addition to being non-fungible by definition, NFTs have several other advantages for access and membership. PFP projects have demonstrated the advantages of an internal and external social signaling layers. Setting your profile picture to an NFT publicly shows your community affiliation and advertises the community to the world. The traits or rarity of your NFT may affiliate you with a sub-tribe of the community. Art with a greater sense of direct ownership can support complex social dynamics. As smart contracts, they also have the technical advantage of being programmed with more than just a numeric and/or social value.\n\nSo, what types of tokens should be used for which community purposes? As with most things in life, the answer is: it’s complicated! Each DAO needs to evaluate what type of community they are trying to build and determine the right combination of assets for economics, governance, and membership. But, generally speaking, we think it makes more sense for economies to operate on fungible tokens and access to operate on non-fungible tokens:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b1f1b3e8-d403-49ae-9cf2-897831035294.png?height=794&width=1564)\n\n### Printing money 🤝 Printing passports\n\nThis model isn’t novel—it’s how most countries already work. The two most important pieces of paper governments produce are money and passports. Money is the economic medium of exchange, passports represent rights of access and citizenship. Governance, in practice, ends up being dependent on both.\n\nCabin DAO currently operates a token-gated community accessed with $CABIN tokens. While $CABIN is a great internal medium of exchange, we want to explore membership, governance, and access privileges through non-fungible passport NFTs.\n\nIn the metaverse, [nobody knows you’re a dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog). But in reality, it’s helpful to have some basic systems of trust to protect the safety of strangers sharing a space. As a DAO operating a physical space, we are interested in exploring ways of granting verified access to that space using web3 technologies. It’s also fun to LARP as a nation state.\n\nHere are some explorations of passports our artist guild has been working on:\n\n![designs by the magnificent @mel_being](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/59c501aa-a476-4974-8880-eca9a96a5deb.png?height=654&width=2598)\n\n### Where passports could go next\n\nNFT Passports offer a great way to combine aspects of membership, access, and identity verification. At the moment, the primary use-case for NFT smart contracts is as a transferable pointer to a jpeg on IPFS. But the possibilities of NFT smart contracts go way beyond that.\n\nNFTs can hold roles, durations, access levels, and other editable data. For example, when someone is voted into a Cabin DAO residency cohort, we could allow them to mint a passport with the role of “Resident”, active for the duration of the Cohort. This passport could provide permissions both online and IRL.\n\nBeyond tying roles and permissions to a member’s passport, we would also like to explore verifying ownership in-person. We imagine we could do this by adding a QR code to the passport. When scanned, we can send the owner a transaction that they have to sign, therefore verifying ownership in the metaverse and the meat space.\n\nWe would also like to add the ability for passport holders to set a passport image. Rather than a headshot, you could set it to your favorite PFP or another NFT of your choice. We think there’s value in being able to show membership in a standard format (like a passport) while being able to show individuality through customization.\n\nWe will continue to explore new use-cases for NFT passports and would love to hear from other DAOs interested in their own pseudo-state LARPs!

{"id": "qZhuFJhr9U5iW9hiSvIIMReSDrR_5Xm8KEB6ebdFzbE", "title": "Today's Web3 Communities: The McMansions of the Internet", "body": "**We are entering the age of living online**. An increasing number of people have employment that exists only online. We have meaningful relationships that are primarily or even only online. It should not be surprising that a growing number of us -- especially we who are most intensely online -- are embracing the concept of ‘owning’ online things. A belief in the value of NFTs is a logical extension of the vitality of online experience and existence. \n\nAs with the ‘real world,’ the things we own enable important connections to other people. If we own related things, we may share similar personalities, interests or life situations. We may have a common vested interest in preserving or increasing their ongoing value. We may also be engaged in a kind of game with each other, competing to purchase more or more special versions of the item. We are bound together by economic commitments. \n\nThe archetypal example in the physical world is real estate. Where we live is a huge part of our identity and, usually, our net worth. By owning property in the same neighborhood, we have committed, at least to some extent, to a shared destiny. When we volunteer, for example, for an event or organization that makes the block a nicer place to live, when we organize or sponsor services that enrich the area, it enhances the value of everyone’s home. As the value of the neighborhood increases, we benefit together, both in terms of status as well as financially. As our relationships and sense of self become more embedded in the neighborhood, we become more attached to the property, deepening the connection and spurring active engagement. In healthy neighborhoods, all residents benefit from this ‘virtuous circle.’ Ownership leads to meaningful engagement which leads to increased desirability.. \n\nNFT collections, and especially the latest wave of ‘avatar communities’ aka PFP collections, have the potential to mirror this healthy dynamic. When we own a SupDuck or Cryptoad, we have a motivation to engage in behavior that makes everyone’s ownership more significant. As ‘residents’ of that virtual neighborhood, we all have an interest in broadening the list of ‘stuff you get’ as part of your NFT. And yet, the vast majority of these projects pay only lip service to that potential. The vast majority of projects offer only hand-waving assurances of future amenities. Rather than investing in genuinely valuable services for its community, the focus tends rather to be on shilling and stunts to generate FOMO. \n\nLet’s take a stroll down memory lane. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the mortgage bubble made home ownership more affordable. Builders responded by investing a lot of money to purchase land in areas that allowed for mass development of residential neighborhoods. There was so much money that developers built entire neighborhoods in the middle of nowhere with hopes of driving individual interest and eventual communities. Twenty five years later, some people still live there, some projects are completely torn down and one thing is for certain; none of them were built to last. These homes weren’t built in places that were convenient or around major metropolitan cities or downtowns driven by existing communities and culture, they were built where land was cheap. But people were like whatever. And eventually there was a huge market flippening in these spaces. \n\nMost of today’s Web3 virtual neighborhoods are following the history of the physical world’s McMansions; building 10,000 ‘homes’ in the middle of nowhere hoping people move in. The awareness that needs to take place in order to avoid a mass flippening is the approach Web3 takes to constructing neighborhoods. Instead of just finding land, developing homes and hoping community fosters through a shared space, developers need to invest in making sure individual buyers get value out of their experience. This means making sure that every single day, there is something happening in the community. NFTs communities can be awesome, we just need to start building shit inside of them. \n\n## A community first approach to neighborhoods. \n\nIn order for virtual neighborhoods to be long lasting, attention needs to move from owning space and land to developing robust services  within the areas where people live. If NFTs get you into the club, what happens once you’re in it? One likely way this question will be answered is to focus the collection community on a particular shared interest. When members share values, it becomes vastly easier to determine and develop the benefits that they will consider valuable. \n\nWhat sort of shared interests might be well-suited to token-communities? Unlike Web media, NFT communities are participatory environments. It’s not about passively consuming but actively participating with the content and community directly. Content takes on an entirely new role of creating virtual space, like physical space is a venue for cooperation and collaboration. So they can be smaller in total audience size than those required to support an ad-based business, provided the members’ commitment is sufficiently intense. So there’s no shortage of potential interests that might be addressed. \n\nCommunities can be built around professional networks, for example. Picture an NFT collection celebrating and welcoming designers or teachers or security experts. Another possible focus could be causes, like the climate crisis or free speech. We might also see cohesive communities around hobbies (fashion! surfing! hunting!) or fitness/wellness activities (crossfit! fasting! meditation!) \n\nBut we need to be realistic about the effort needed to create compelling experiences with these ‘neighborhoods.’.  Web3 communities need programming. In an era where NFT drops serve as a catalyst for community building, there is a tendency to hope that  individuals will  build the culture and activities of their collection This does happen but is probably insufficient for lasting value. The reason why traditional media has done a good job for decades of readership is that there is a content cadence that drives discussion, consumption and community engagement. But the real opportunity for Web3 to break out is the reverse incentive of the contribution of work. Today’s creators deal with a sort of volunteerism where the small percentage of individuals who do break through actually make money. Authenticity is lost in exchange for trying to grasp an audience, and free labor often results in… free content. But looking outside of the media to build Web3 communities is a catalyst for innovation, where content becomes the space for activities, participation and relationships. For example, in the physical world, SoulCycle has built an entire culture around physically working out but then digitally learning how to eat better and meet like minded individuals who want to live a similar lifestyle. Individuals reside in these “neighborhoods” because there is constant programming to keep them engaged and incentives to build the community up to better themselves and those around them. Purpose is driven through the development of content, and Web3 communities must proactively work to make the places where people reside a daily habit. It is important to invest in the ability for individuals to get value out of their experience, that every single day there is something happening. \n\nGood things cost money, and you can’t get valuable experiences without investing in the community to build them. A worthy investment for NFT projects is around education. A key value of communities and neighborhoods is that individuals are able to teach one another. We are starting to see this foster in Web3 through community driven discords, telegrams and WhatsApps but oftentimes, this is happening outside of the project owners themselves. Arguably, this is a feature not a bug as the community is free to build on top of the IP distributed by the origin creators but as we think about lasting value, there needs to be an incentive to cultivate contribution through shared learning from one another. This means that it should be instilled at a foundational level that then bubbles up through the community regardless of which platforms they are spending time with one another one. \n\n## Putting interests at the forefront of infrastructure. \n\nToday’s Web3 neighborhoods are mostly being built around financial interests. And the promise of getting rich does lure people to these neighborhoods---the 10,000 houses may well be occupied, at least for a while. But we’ve seen this play out IRL, with gold-rush Boomtowns from the 1800s becoming today’s Ghost Towns, having failed to attract real residents and establish a culture. Visit one of these places today and you’ll see they didn’t get much built beyond a saloon, a place to meet up and talk about finding gold. Visit the discord of a forgotten PFP project from July and you’ll see something similar--a now abandoned general chat, containing little but a discussion of prices and sales. \\n  \\n But there were exceptions--- some Boomtowns attracted families and developed a thriving culture, becoming San Francisco, Chicago, Denver. The great HBO show Deadwood is the story of how a historical Boomtown developed a culture and transcended the speculative interests that drew people to it in the first place. Its creator David Milch felt that a true society often starts with a “symbol agreed upon”. For Milch this can be a cross, but it can also be gold (or perhaps even drawings of apes.) And it’s that agreement that liberates individuals to participate and find their “identity in the collective.” For Milch, you can start with speculation but you can’t stop there. \n\nDeadwood posits that if a lasting culture is to form, it will be aided by spaces, artifacts, rituals, and symbols. And with NFTs and DAOs we might be seeing the emergence of the digitally native forms of these essential human primitives. But it’s up to these nascent Boomtowns to use them, with success being observed with the deepening the group’s interactions and the expansion of their interests and reach. Certainly beyond the narrow motives that drew people to them in the first place, but beyond crypto as well. \n\nOn the flipside, building for interest groups has its challenges that will need to be met. By building neighborhoods around a particular interest, we are deliberately constraining the market size which will slow down value and decrease speculation. It becomes a stabler, yet less exciting investment. Why it’s critical to incorporate both financial and societal interests to maintain the right balance.\n\nNew communities are emerging on the internet by way of NFTs, giving individuals an opportunity to stake land and foster community in designated spaces constructed through residential avatars. But the approach of building communities this way is fragile. With unlimited space online and a gold rush to occupy mass areas, builders are overlooking the need for community in exchange for ownership. And that method, while momentarily successful when individuals have money to spend, deconstructs in the long run. \n\nNFT communities today are rewarding individuals for buying land and naming the sub-development versus what should be the true promise of crypto which is rewarding individuals that make the neighborhood flourish. It’s not the local mortgage services or banks that make a strong community, it’s the artists, restaurants and families that do. Today’s Web3 communities are building neighborhoods to attract community versus building communities to foster neighborhoods. This needs to change. \n\n** \\n  \\n **", "timestamp": 1631729924, "digest": "VTLvmo0xzs6I9YFIN2f7EZna-Zj4tNIEbF7RVpJOS7s", "contributor": "0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A"}

The object is to convince a general audience that blockchain technologies like bitcoin and other “digital currencies” will have a large impact on our world.\n\nThis isn’t a popular view. Today it is difficult to even explain what bitcoin is, or how a blockchain works. Proponents too-often rely on dense technical explanations, or vague gestures towards far-future use cases. To many this sounds dodgy. If this new technology is so great, why can’t you explain it?\n\nWe’ve seen this dynamic before. Blockchain technology today is a lot like the internet in 1993 or 1994. A new technology used by a limited number of enthusiasts, associated mainly with geeks and pornographers. Explaining the internet in 1993 meant either getting into technical details like IP addresses and packets, or describing a vague future with uncertain benefits. Not a pursuit for serious people. The “web”, which would eventually fulfill most of the early advocates’ promises, barely existed.\n\nBut to understand that the internet would change the world, you didn’t have to understand the technical details or believe in a specific utopia. Mostly, you needed one key insight: the internet radically reduced the cost of moving information. Any process, product or business that involved moving information would be impacted by the internet. The businesses that didn’t even realize they were in the information business — “we sell CDs, not data!” — would be decimated by it. It is striking, if popularly mundane, to think about how the world has changed in 20 years:\n\n> *Before the internet, media access was tightly delineated by national borders. You could access international media if you really sought it out — when I was a kid in a small town, there were a few families on my route who received the Sunday Times — but it was expensive, and difficult to discover if you didn’t already know you wanted it.*\n\nNow, anyone anywhere (with some exceptions) has access to all media from any country in the world. They don’t receive it as a bundle of paper delivered to their doorstep, but rather through the new common medium of the web.\n\n> *Before the internet, individual people could only exchange messages or phone calls across great distances using very expensive intermediaries like phone companies.*\n\nNow, anyone anywhere can communicate instantly with anyone else, in any form, using a device they carry around with them in their pocket.\n\n> *Before the internet, there were very high barriers to launching new media products & companies. Distribution of physical media is very expensive, and the existing networks were largely controlled by the incumbent industries (e.g. most printing presses had, and continue to have, tight business relationships with the papers that use them). You had to be local to compete with local media.*\n\nPublishing newspapers and books is still expensive, but publishing on the internet is free and accessible to anyone. Anyone can compete with “local” media because all distribution is global distribution. This lowered the costs of entry and allowed many new companies to compete in what was previously an industry dominated by a small number of players.\n\nI believe blockchain technology is a lot like the internet in 1993. We don’t have our “web” yet, the consumer-facing leap that will open it up to a mass audience. But the underlying technology is sound, and this industry is the site of an incredible outpouring of entrepreneurial energies (and capital investment).\n\nWithin the community, it can be easy to lose sight of this big picture. There are many competing projects and [competing visions](http://www.coindesk.com/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-size-debate-and-why-does-it-matter/) for how blockchain technology should evolve. Some of these projects will succeed. Others will fail. Things will not turn out as we expect. But at this point in late 2015, it is clear that however this early industry turns out, blockchain technologies like bitcoin will have *at least* one revolutionary property: they will make it incredibly cheap to move money. To control it, to manage it, to send it.\n\nWhat might that look like?\n\n> *Before blockchain, financial access was tightly delineated by national borders. Most people only had banking relationships, if any, with the select few banks that have local branches in their hometown. You could open up accounts in foreign countries if you really sought them out — and they offered specific tax advantages or investment opportunities if you did — but it was expensive to set up, and difficult to discover if you didn’t already know you wanted it.*\n\nIn the future, anyone anywhere can access financial products and services from any company in the world. They don’t access them through traditional banks or using traditional mediums of exchange, but over a new global network of common exchange.\n\n> *Before blockchain, individual people could only exchange value over great distances by using expensive intermediaries like banks & financial services companies like Western Union.*\n\nIn the future, anyone anywhere can transfer value instantly to anyone else, using a device they carry around in their pocket.\n\n> *Before blockchain, there were very high barriers to launching new financial products & companies. Receiving, managing, and distributing large sums of money is difficult and expensive, requiring specialized expertise, a large staff, and privileged relationships with existing large financial institutions.*\n\nIn the future, receiving and distributing large sums of money or managing large numbers of transfers will be an inexpensive, automated process managed almost entirely by software. Barriers to entry for new entrants into financial services will be radically lowered, allowing many new companies to compete in what was previously a small industry dominated by large players.\n\nThe internet analogy isn’t perfect. But it’s a helpful lens. The internet transformed every industry whose business was, in some form, moving information from A to B. Blockchain, the argument goes, could have an equally transformative impact on any industry involved in moving money. If your business needs to move money around, and pays for that service, blockchain might cut your costs and expand the realm of possible business models. If your business *is* the business of moving money around, then you might want to call your CTO.\n\nMoving money from A to B is, today, quite profitable. Firms like Western Union charge an average of 8% on a transfer of $200. One of their largest markets is international remittances sent to developing nations — typically, an immigrant remitting a portion of her income back to her family. In 2015, \\~$440 billion USD will be sent to developing countries this way, billions of which will go to firms like Western Union.\n\nReducing fees on remittances has been a priority for development organizations for years, for good reason. Even cutting those fees in half would add \\~$17.5 billion USD to developing nations’ economies — the size of the entire UK foreign aid budget. What if we could eliminate them entirely?\n\nIn the future, the fact that there was at one point a “remittance industry” will seem as absurd as there being an “email industry” today.

This is part 3 of 7 in a series of posts released under the pseudonym Creole.*\n\nIn the first post I wrote that blockchain technology will make it cheap and easy to transfer money. In the second post we took a brief look at what that world might look like.\n\nBut blockchains won’t only be used for money. The same technology that makes it possible to cheaply and easily exchange digital currency is being adapted for other types of value, like shares of company stock or rewards points. The focus in the industry right now is in adapting blockchain technology to be suitable for the exchange of financial assets, and a staggering amount of money and energy is being invested into creating those platforms.\n\nThat’s exciting. Especially if you work in finance. But it’s hard to know why most people should care whether we can reduce settlement times for syndicated loans, or whether the DTCC is the next Blockbuster. Blockchains didn’t become objects of passionate intensity for so many because they will make life easier for the worlds’ largest banks.\n\nBlockchain technology won’t just give us better versions of what we have today — things like dollars, shares, and Starbucks points. The really exciting part is what new things we will use them to build. Returning to our analogy from post #1, the internet didn’t just give us better TV, newspapers, mail and radio — it also gave us blogs, social media, smartphones, cloud computing, and a generation of YouTube & twitch.tv stars. What will blockchain give us?\n\nLet’s back up. What’s the difference between a dollar, a Starbucks point, and a share of Apple Inc.?\n\nStructurally, they are very different. Dollars, or any currency, are in their classic definition a medium of exchange and a store of value. Within a currency zone everyone agrees with everyone else by convention that they can be exchanged for goods and services (a medium of exchange). The government responsible for managing that currency enacts policies to help it hold its value and avoid inflation (a store of value). Almost everyone uses currency.\n\nStarbucks points are a little like a currency. But they can only be exchanged for certain goods and services, they are created by a business rather than a government, and you can only get them from Starbucks. They’re more like little contracts that entitle you to a certain amount of Starbucks products. Starbucks points are only really used by people who frequent Starbucks, which suggests a certain class and income profile.\n\nApple shares are also a contract, but a more complex one — a bundle that includes a claim on the assets of the company, as well as other rights like dividends and voting. These are defined both by the “contract” itself and a complicated legal regime of securities regulations and shareholder rights. Unlike Starbucks points, there’s a secondary market for trading shares. Most people might have some exposure to them through a pension plan or other investment, but for the most part shares and other financial assets are only held and traded by the very rich.\n\nThey’re very different. But we can already see axes that connect them. One axis is: where can you use it? On one extreme are currencies, which are accepted everywhere in a currency zone. On the other extreme are Starbucks points, which only have value at Starbucks.\n\nAnother axis is: how complex is it? Currencies are simple — they’re a unit of value that can be exchanged for anything else. Shares are very complex: they are bundles of many different conditional entitlements, rights, and obligations.\n\nAnother axis is: who defines what it is? Currencies are controlled by a central bank, Starbucks points by a private corporation. Shares are a combination: the company writes their own articles of incorporation (the “contract”), but securities regulators and a body of shareholder rights laws, maintained and enforced by a legislature and judicial system, play a large part in defining (and enforcing) what it means to own stock in Apple.\n\nIn a way, they’re all made from the same stuff. They may be valuable to us for different reasons, they are governed by different rules, and there are different sources for those rules.

What will blockchain give us?\n\n\n---\n\nLet’s back up. What’s the difference between a dollar, a Starbucks point, and a share of Apple Inc.?\n\nStructurally, they are very different. Dollars, or any currency, are in their classic definition a medium of exchange and a store of value. Within a currency zone everyone agrees with everyone else by convention that they can be exchanged for goods and services (a medium of exchange). The government responsible for managing that currency enacts policies to help it hold its value and avoid inflation (a store of value). Almost everyone uses currency.\n\nStarbucks points are a little like a currency. But they can only be exchanged for certain goods and services, they are created by a business rather than a government, and you can only get them from Starbucks. They’re more like little contracts that entitle you to a certain amount of Starbucks products. Starbucks points are only really used by people who frequent Starbucks, which suggests a certain class and income profile.\n\nApple shares are also a contract, but a more complex one — a bundle that includes a claim on the assets of the company, as well as other rights like dividends and voting. These are defined both by the “contract” itself and a complicated legal regime of securities regulations and shareholder rights. Unlike Starbucks points, there’s a secondary market for trading shares. Most people might have some exposure to them through a pension plan or other investment, but for the most part shares and other financial assets are only held and traded by the very rich.\n\nThey’re very different. But we can already see axes that connect them. One axis is: where can you use it? On one extreme are currencies, which are accepted everywhere in a currency zone. On the other extreme are Starbucks points, which only have value at Starbucks.\n\nAnother axis is: how complex is it? Currencies are simple — they’re a unit of value that can be exchanged for anything else. Shares are very complex: they are bundles of many different conditional entitlements, rights, and obligations.\n\nAnother axis is: who defines what it is? Currencies are controlled by a central bank, Starbucks points by a private corporation. Shares are a combination: the company writes their own articles of incorporation (the “contract”), but securities regulators and a body of shareholder rights laws, maintained and enforced by a legislature and judicial system, play a large part in defining (and enforcing) what it means to own stock in Apple.\n\nIn a way, they’re all made from the same stuff. They may be valuable to us for different reasons, they are governed by different rules, and there are different sources for those rules.

{"id": "8NY6O_x7CpSdB0t1E70hKv3i57-xBblXtJN1FImJ6vE", "title": "A Simple View of Blockchain", "body": "*👋 Note: Originally published on Oct 12, 2015 ([link](https://medium.com/@creole/1-a-simple-view-of-blockchain-500654a55d1d)). This is part 1 of 7 in a series of posts released under the pseudonym Creole.*\n\n\n---\n\nThis is the first post of what I am calling Creole. The object is to convince a general audience that blockchain technologies like bitcoin and other “digital currencies” will have a large impact on our world.\n\nThis isn’t a popular view. Today it is difficult to even explain what bitcoin is, or how a blockchain works. Proponents too-often rely on dense technical explanations, or vague gestures towards far-future use cases. To many this sounds dodgy. If this new technology is so great, why can’t you explain it?\n\nWe’ve seen this dynamic before. Blockchain technology today is a lot like the internet in 1993 or 1994. A new technology used by a limited number of enthusiasts, associated mainly with geeks and pornographers. Explaining the internet in 1993 meant either getting into technical details like IP addresses and packets, or describing a vague future with uncertain benefits. Not a pursuit for serious people. The “web”, which would eventually fulfill most of the early advocates’ promises, barely existed.\n\nBut to understand that the internet would change the world, you didn’t have to understand the technical details or believe in a specific utopia. Mostly, you needed one key insight: the internet radically reduced the cost of moving information. Any process, product or business that involved moving information would be impacted by the internet. The businesses that didn’t even realize they were in the information business — “we sell CDs, not data!” — would be decimated by it. It is striking, if popularly mundane, to think about how the world has changed in 20 years:\n\n> *Before the internet, media access was tightly delineated by national borders. You could access international media if you really sought it out — when I was a kid in a small town, there were a few families on my route who received the Sunday Times — but it was expensive, and difficult to discover if you didn’t already know you wanted it.*\n\nNow, anyone anywhere (with some exceptions) has access to all media from any country in the world. They don’t receive it as a bundle of paper delivered to their doorstep, but rather through the new common medium of the web.\n\n> *Before the internet, individual people could only exchange messages or phone calls across great distances using very expensive intermediaries like phone companies.*\n\nNow, anyone anywhere can communicate instantly with anyone else, in any form, using a device they carry around with them in their pocket.\n\n> *Before the internet, there were very high barriers to launching new media products & companies. Distribution of physical media is very expensive, and the existing networks were largely controlled by the incumbent industries (e.g. most printing presses had, and continue to have, tight business relationships with the papers that use them). You had to be local to compete with local media.*\n\nPublishing newspapers and books is still expensive, but publishing on the internet is free and accessible to anyone. Anyone can compete with “local” media because all distribution is global distribution. This lowered the costs of entry and allowed many new companies to compete in what was previously an industry dominated by a small number of players.\n\nI believe blockchain technology is a lot like the internet in 1993. We don’t have our “web” yet, the consumer-facing leap that will open it up to a mass audience. But the underlying technology is sound, and this industry is the site of an incredible outpouring of entrepreneurial energies (and capital investment).\n\nWithin the community, it can be easy to lose sight of this big picture. There are many competing projects and [competing visions](http://www.coindesk.com/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-size-debate-and-why-does-it-matter/) for how blockchain technology should evolve. Some of these projects will succeed. Others will fail. Things will not turn out as we expect. But at this point in late 2015, it is clear that however this early industry turns out, blockchain technologies like bitcoin will have *at least* one revolutionary property: they will make it incredibly cheap to move money. To control it, to manage it, to send it.\n\nWhat might that look like?\n\n> *Before blockchain, financial access was tightly delineated by national borders. Most people only had banking relationships, if any, with the select few banks that have local branches in their hometown. You could open up accounts in foreign countries if you really sought them out — and they offered specific tax advantages or investment opportunities if you did — but it was expensive to set up, and difficult to discover if you didn’t already know you wanted it.*\n\nIn the future, anyone anywhere can access financial products and services from any company in the world. They don’t access them through traditional banks or using traditional mediums of exchange, but over a new global network of common exchange.\n\n> *Before blockchain, individual people could only exchange value over great distances by using expensive intermediaries like banks & financial services companies like Western Union.*\n\nIn the future, anyone anywhere can transfer value instantly to anyone else, using a device they carry around in their pocket.\n\n> *Before blockchain, there were very high barriers to launching new financial products & companies. Receiving, managing, and distributing large sums of money is difficult and expensive, requiring specialized expertise, a large staff, and privileged relationships with existing large financial institutions.*\n\nIn the future, receiving and distributing large sums of money or managing large numbers of transfers will be an inexpensive, automated process managed almost entirely by software. Barriers to entry for new entrants into financial services will be radically lowered, allowing many new companies to compete in what was previously a small industry dominated by large players.\n\nThe internet analogy isn’t perfect. But it’s a helpful lens. The internet transformed every industry whose business was, in some form, moving information from A to B. Blockchain, the argument goes, could have an equally transformative impact on any industry involved in moving money. If your business needs to move money around, and pays for that service, blockchain might cut your costs and expand the realm of possible business models. If your business *is* the business of moving money around, then you might want to call your CTO.\n\nMoving money from A to B is, today, quite profitable. Firms like Western Union charge an average of 8% on a transfer of $200. One of their largest markets is international remittances sent to developing nations — typically, an immigrant remitting a portion of her income back to her family. In 2015, \\~$440 billion USD will be sent to developing countries this way, billions of which will go to firms like Western Union.\n\nReducing fees on remittances has been a priority for development organizations for years, for good reason. Even cutting those fees in half would add \\~$17.5 billion USD to developing nations’ economies — the size of the entire UK foreign aid budget. What if we could eliminate them entirely?\n\nIn the future, the fact that there was at one point a “remittance industry” will seem as absurd as there being an “email industry” today. Moving money, like moving information, is not a service you should have to pay for. It will just be a feature of the internet. A thing you do with your phone.", "timestamp": 1631750299, "digest": "Q0zQ5JdZtckCpVjQW9MnuGB9HrUDa_7UG3NEgjtg5WI", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}

This was part 4 of 7 in a series of posts released under the pseudonym Creole.*\n\n\n---\n\nYou’re a little early for work that day and decide to walk to the far Starbucks instead of going to the close Starbucks. The close Starbucks is one of those ones they cram into a rough corner of an office building, halfway between the fire exit and a fern. The far Starbucks is glass and wood and gleaming like a Starbucks should. You arrive and wait in line to buy a coffee.\n\nYour previous purchases have filled your wallet with Starbucks points. You’re dimly aware of this. There are notifications from your phone occasionally, when you reach certain milestones (100,000th point collected! *Grande Achievement unlocked!*). You remember a few recent promotions that you sought out specifically for the high point rewards (first day of pumpkin spice lattes was 4.5x last fall). Some of the points are bound to the Close Starbucks, in the sense that they offer you 1.3x when used at that location instead of the base 1x at any other Starbucks — the property management company subsidizes them, in a vain effort to entice consumers into their monument to brutalism.\n\nSome offices give employees points that are worth more at Starbucks near to their offices — a way to get them back into the office sooner — or in some other way valuable. (The ad agency up the street incentives their employees this way to visit coffee shops, bars, and restaurants that are deemed culturally relevant and therefore important for their employees to have visited, consumed, absorbed, reflected upon). \n\nSome points are redeemable not only at Starbucks but at a variety of cooperating retailers. Others won’t mature for another six months, and offer increasing returns of 1% every month after the maturity date — a way for Starbucks Inc. to hedge against demand uncertainty into the next fiscal year. Other Starbucks points offer, when spent, a chance to win a vacation in beautiful Maui. (When these points are used, your phone lights up with special graphics. You saw someone win once, the gleaming golden ticket appearing briefly on the wall menus and then residing proudly on a highlighted tab on a woman’s iPhone.)\n\nYou don’t know most of this, but your wallet does. It lazily keeps track of the multipliers and values and important dates of your various Starbucks proprietary currency and turns it into actionable advice. A map that shows the effective price of your preferred products at nearby locations, built from the bundle of value in your wallet. A system setting that prevents you from spending points below a certain redeemable value as compared to the maximum likely market value of the points within a six month horizon.\n\nAnother set of algorithms identifies ways to exchange surplus points into points for other businesses on the burgeoning secondary market, and that automatically carries out the trades. Did you visit a chain restaurant once on a trip that you will probably never visit again? Your wallet knows that, and it will trade those points away for something you will use. There is a billion dollar marketplace, consisting of trades often worth less than 50 cents, where rewards points from virtually every consumer-facing business in the world are traded by our wallets instantly, conveniently, invisibly. Worrying about, and managing, the secondary market value of points has become a new concern for the modern CEO. A thousand little central banks. Some people say that, in 10 years, we’ll use currencies issued by corporations and non-state organizations as often as we use fiat.\n\nAll of this can be abstracted away depending on your preferences — you know some people who go deep into it, but you’ve paid for a fairly good wallet and trust it to manage everything well. You often collect points, and spend them, without knowing where they came from or what they were used for. From your perspective, Friday’s after-works beers were cheaper than usual and that’s the end of it.\n\nThis is a lot more controversial than it sounds. Some merchants have taken to distributing points only to users whose wallets enable some form of brand awareness. Distributing points to people who don’t know the points came from Swiss Chalet, from the brand’s perspective, undermines part of the value of the points system for the merchant (and they have data to prove it). But many consumers feel they deserve the points without being forced to see an ad dozens of times a day. Why shouldn’t they be able to control what they have to see on their phone? Even some in the industry believe it’s an unnecessary source of friction that undermines this aspect of the New Economy. Blocking apps try to trick retail POS terminals and beacons into believing that the brand has been viewed, and points should be received. Merchants build software to detect the most common ones, and have appealed publicly to Apple/Xiaomi/Android to block the blockers from their ecosystems.\n\nOn the whole, it’s been a good thing. Directly creating monetary incentives for consumers that are easily translated into actionable advice through mediating wallet software is usually more effective and reliable than paying for advertising. Secured identities through wallets has solved a lot of the [fake-view problem](http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-click-fraud/) that plagued online ads. Some products still need ads to move units — lifestyle items, class signifiers, luxury services. But most goods are mundane, interchangeable, and most people are price sensitive.\n\nWhere rewards programs were once the exclusive domain of national brands, now they’re easy and cheap enough to implement that small businesses use them. Setting up your points system costs about as much as setting up a website. It costs less than printing and shipping an order of punch cards.\n\nThe deceptive or manipulative rewards programs / loyalty points that used to succeed by exploiting common human cognitive biases have a harder time succeeding. Your wallet is now doing the math for you, and it is very good at math. These still exist to some extent, in a different form. There’s a whole grey industry of trying to identify bugs in wallets’ pricing mechanisms or blind spots in their market data, which are then exploited by unscrupulous retailers. When a major brand gets caught doing this, it’s a scandal.\n\nYou collect far more points and coupons than your mother ever did. But she had to carefully cut them out of newspapers, and track their endless permutations in her own head, on her own calendar. She would carry a binder full of them, and embarrass you by awkwardly messing through it at the grocery shop. You collect more points than you did in your twenties, even though you had signed up for the credit cards and rewards cards that offered them. You lost your aeroplan card shortly after ordering it and could barely keep track of which purchases offered which rewards with which cards. Thick leather wallets. Forgotten passwords. Account fatigue.\n\nNow your wallet does it all, and to you, it is just money.\n\nYou purchase your coffee (**^**34 sbux.Pts @ 1.0x + 4 sbux.Pts @ 2.0x + 0.000084 btc + 0.000009 eth, **v**15 sbux.Pts \\[lock: 24hrs\\] + 10 amzn.Pts @ 2.56 ++0.1 @ 60 days) and head to work.\n\n\n---\n\n*Cover Photo by [Thibault Poriel](https://www.flickr.com/photos/thibaultporiel/) licensed under [CC BY-SA 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/)*\n\n \\n ", "timestamp": 1631751077, "digest": "89n5eEaEtyUQHvvZUHTEDQLkZeAl_F1e2o9fY7IZWwE", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}

Building them required complex business processes and record keeping systems, applying new discoveries in economics to improve them, and large staffs with new sets of expertise to manage them. They required punch cards, magnetic strips, and apps to track them.\n\nWe invented shares because they were a useful mechanism to connect investors with private ventures in need of capital. This required new laws to structure the relationships between each party. It required new types of marketplaces — stock exchanges — to expand the market and make it liquid. Whole professions, areas of expertise, branches of caselaw, legislation, regulations and bookkeeping systems were built over centuries to form what we today call a stock market.\n\nThe startup costs of new value technologies are immense. There is a reason some of them took centuries to mature. Every value technology needs a way to record ownership — a physical token, or a central database that tracks ownership. It needs a way to execute the instructions that define it, and enforce those instructions if they are not followed. And above all, it must find a way to create trust, so that people will actually use it. It requires metal, currency zones, punch-cards, databases, highly secured buildings, legal systems, legislatures, armies.\n\n![National Climatic Data Center, 1964](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*EfaeaYdQD80Hjo4DQixtZg.jpeg)\n\nBefore the internet we had phones, we had letters, we had mail, we had CD stores, we had television, we had books, and we had stacks and stacks of paper that were trucked back and forth between office buildings. Then we had the internet, and only then did it become obvious to most people that these were all just different information technologies, each with its own custom “hardware” for moving information, most of which could, it turns out, be replaced by a general platform that could agnostically move data.\n\nBlockchain is a general platform for value technologies. It is a platform that allows us to build value technologies more easily — a way to record ownership, execute instructions, and create trust in a fully digital, decentralized system.\n\nJust as with the internet, we will start by building analogs of the technologies we have today: dollars, shares, Starbucks points. The blockchain versions of these products won’t always win, but in many cases they might, because blockchains will radically change their cost structures, opening them up to new competition and new markets.\n\nBut as we alluded to earlier, we won’t just build new versions of old things. We’ll also build *new* things. It has always been so very hard to build new value technologies, but soon it will be easy. Already, thousands of people around the world are building strange new things, testing new applications, trying out new business models in new markets. The empty spaces on the axes between “currency”, “rewards points”, and “stock” will begin to be filled in as we experiment with different combinations of rights, obligations, relationships, and value.", "timestamp": 1631750711, "digest": "7K0pgXYiUX5Qs1KaJtsKNNCXNHimqwGX3xKssG1srDI", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}

You lazily wake the screen and thumb approval to the standard division:\n\n\\- 45% (0.00005600 BTC) to mobile wallet \\[x1f8K…nb7\\]\n\n\\- 50% (0.00006220 BTC) to savings \\[ICICI x1f9H…m4e\\]\n\n\\- 4.8% (0.00000597 BTC) to MSF_KL \\[x14hY…8e9\\]\n\n\\- 0.2% maintenance of PO Account \\[0\\]\n\nThat’s just your stake, of course. The rest goes to your mother in Munnar, and some cousins in Trivandrum. The money comes from a variety of sources, which you know because every few weeks you’re obligated by the wallet to flick through a screen containing details of each. You understand: when the State, ASEAN, or some rich billionaire’s kid gives you and a 100 million other people hard cash, they want you to know who to thank.\n\nYou thumb it open and pull out the history tab. The account received funds from about 32 sources this year. This is a Public Outcome account (PO), which means you needed to jump through a few hoops to set it up. A few identity challenges, made much easier by having a few existing bank accounts, social profiles, and other identity capital. Easier, always, as a family. But it’s worth it even when it’s hard, because earning the PO designation gives you the right to receive PO funds.\n\nWhen it started, PO was all billionaires. You remember when the Gates died, and the estate announced that everyone on earth would get $10 USD in BTC. Had been set up before their death, secretly turning all that fiat into crypto. A bold gesture, though obviously could have been structured more progressively. But it certainly drove a point home. Since then all sorts of billionaire pools have sprung up — all weighted in different ways, by age, location, gender, ethnicity, orientation, cis/trans. You don’t have to figure that stuff out, though. Once you have your PO set up with all your identity primitives, it checks against what’s available, and gains access to whatever you (and your family, in this case) qualify for.\n\nIn the last 5 years, the slower-moving institutions of the world have started to use it. National and state governments, development orgs, econ unions, etc. You read once that this was the point of the Gates’ initiative, the real point beyond the lump sum — doing something big enough to drive people to actually set up their POs to make a real market out of it. Jumpstart the network effects, make it big enough for other institutions to start distributing much smaller amounts.\n\nYou don’t earn much from it, but you know there are many in places like Bihar who pay their rent or groceries with it (and, in the tabloids, those who somehow bought a drone, or some LSD, or something else the poor shouldn’t have). Fraud is still a problem. People trying to set up hundreds or thousands of fakes in order to collect cash for them. Your standard arms race. Algorithms monitor accounts to identify non-human spending patterns. Bots learn better patterns and find better sources of entropy to inject. Every few months there’s a new CAPTCHA — frown and take a photo of your face, use some local slang in a sentence, tell me which man is prettier and identify the metaphor in the paragraph we’ve printed on his chest. Your mother thinks she’s going to start failing them more often than not.\n\nYou roll out of bed to shower, and as you do, open Spotify and turn it onto your speaker set in your washroom.

At the same time, your wallet is going up, bit by bit. Revenue from content you published last week, a concert review posted to Zapchain, where every view is a small number of bits. It’s not worth much now, but you’re optimistic this group could do well. If they do ever blow up, reviews of early shows can be worth a fortune if they become authoritative or linked on Genius. And you could always up the price.\n\nWhich is funny, you think. Thousands of people paying tiny amounts of money to you from all over the world. Your mother used to tell you about your father, who worked in the Emirates, and once sent her money to pay for rent, to pay for you. He would go to a man behind a counter and give him money, and the man would take the money and use a social relationship with *another* man in Munnar, who would give an equivalent amount — less a significant fee — to your mother.

This was part 1 of 7 in a series of posts released under the pseudonym Creole.*\n\n\n---\n\nThis is the first post of what I am calling Creole. The object is to convince a general audience that blockchain technologies like bitcoin and other “digital currencies” will have a large impact on our world.\n\nThis isn’t a popular view. Today it is difficult to even explain what bitcoin is, or how a blockchain works. Proponents too-often rely on dense technical explanations, or vague gestures towards far-future use cases. To many this sounds dodgy. If this new technology is so great, why can’t you explain it?\n\nWe’ve seen this dynamic before. Blockchain technology today is a lot like the internet in 1993 or 1994. A new technology used by a limited number of enthusiasts, associated mainly with geeks and pornographers. Explaining the internet in 1993 meant either getting into technical details like IP addresses and packets, or describing a vague future with uncertain benefits. Not a pursuit for serious people. The “web”, which would eventually fulfill most of the early advocates’ promises, barely existed.\n\nBut to understand that the internet would change the world, you didn’t have to understand the technical details or believe in a specific utopia. Mostly, you needed one key insight: the internet radically reduced the cost of moving information. Any process, product or business that involved moving information would be impacted by the internet. The businesses that didn’t even realize they were in the information business — “we sell CDs, not data!” — would be decimated by it. It is striking, if popularly mundane, to think about how the world has changed in 20 years:\n\n> *Before the internet, media access was tightly delineated by national borders. You could access international media if you really sought it out — when I was a kid in a small town, there were a few families on my route who received the Sunday Times — but it was expensive, and difficult to discover if you didn’t already know you wanted it.*\n\nNow, anyone anywhere (with some exceptions) has access to all media from any country in the world. They don’t receive it as a bundle of paper delivered to their doorstep, but rather through the new common medium of the web.\n\n> *Before the internet, individual people could only exchange messages or phone calls across great distances using very expensive intermediaries like phone companies.*\n\nNow, anyone anywhere can communicate instantly with anyone else, in any form, using a device they carry around with them in their pocket.\n\n> *Before the internet, there were very high barriers to launching new media products & companies. Distribution of physical media is very expensive, and the existing networks were largely controlled by the incumbent industries (e.g. most printing presses had, and continue to have, tight business relationships with the papers that use them). You had to be local to compete with local media.*\n\nPublishing newspapers and books is still expensive, but publishing on the internet is free and accessible to anyone. Anyone can compete with “local” media because all distribution is global distribution. This lowered the costs of entry and allowed many new companies to compete in what was previously an industry dominated by a small number of players.\n\nI believe blockchain technology is a lot like the internet in 1993. We don’t have our “web” yet, the consumer-facing leap that will open it up to a mass audience. But the underlying technology is sound, and this industry is the site of an incredible outpouring of entrepreneurial energies (and capital investment).\n\nWithin the community, it can be easy to lose sight of this big picture. There are many competing projects and [competing visions](http://www.coindesk.com/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-size-debate-and-why-does-it-matter/) for how blockchain technology should evolve. Some of these projects will succeed. Others will fail. Things will not turn out as we expect. But at this point in late 2015, it is clear that however this early industry turns out, blockchain technologies like bitcoin will have *at least* one revolutionary property: they will make it incredibly cheap to move money. To control it, to manage it, to send it.\n\nWhat might that look like?\n\n> *Before blockchain, financial access was tightly delineated by national borders. Most people only had banking relationships, if any, with the select few banks that have local branches in their hometown. You could open up accounts in foreign countries if you really sought them out — and they offered specific tax advantages or investment opportunities if you did — but it was expensive to set up, and difficult to discover if you didn’t already know you wanted it.*\n\nIn the future, anyone anywhere can access financial products and services from any company in the world. They don’t access them through traditional banks or using traditional mediums of exchange, but over a new global network of common exchange.\n\n> *Before blockchain, individual people could only exchange value over great distances by using expensive intermediaries like banks & financial services companies like Western Union.*\n\nIn the future, anyone anywhere can transfer value instantly to anyone else, using a device they carry around in their pocket.\n\n> *Before blockchain, there were very high barriers to launching new financial products & companies. Receiving, managing, and distributing large sums of money is difficult and expensive, requiring specialized expertise, a large staff, and privileged relationships with existing large financial institutions.*\n\nIn the future, receiving and distributing large sums of money or managing large numbers of transfers will be an inexpensive, automated process managed almost entirely by software. Barriers to entry for new entrants into financial services will be radically lowered, allowing many new companies to compete in what was previously a small industry dominated by large players.\n\nThe internet analogy isn’t perfect. But it’s a helpful lens. The internet transformed every industry whose business was, in some form, moving information from A to B. Blockchain, the argument goes, could have an equally transformative impact on any industry involved in moving money. If your business needs to move money around, and pays for that service, blockchain might cut your costs and expand the realm of possible business models. If your business *is* the business of moving money around, then you might want to call your CTO.\n\nMoving money from A to B is, today, quite profitable. Firms like Western Union charge an average of 8% on a transfer of $200. One of their largest markets is international remittances sent to developing nations — typically, an immigrant remitting a portion of her income back to her family. In 2015, \\~$440 billion USD will be sent to developing countries this way, billions of which will go to firms like Western Union.\n\nReducing fees on remittances has been a priority for development organizations for years, for good reason. Even cutting those fees in half would add \\~$17.5 billion USD to developing nations’ economies — the size of the entire UK foreign aid budget. What if we could eliminate them entirely?\n\nIn the future, the fact that there was at one point a “remittance industry” will seem as absurd as there being an “email industry” today. Moving money, like moving information, is not a service you should have to pay for. It will just be a feature of the internet. A thing you do with your phone.", "timestamp": 1631750685, "digest": "Q0zQ5JdZtckCpVjQW9MnuGB9HrUDa_7UG3NEgjtg5WI", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}

This was part 5 of 7 in a series of posts released under the pseudonym Creole.*\n\n\n---\n\nIn the third post, we explored how blockchains can serve as a platform for what I called “value technologies” — things that act like currencies, shares, or rewards points.\n\nIn this post, we take this idea further. Many people now believe that blockchains will let us build things more complex and more interesting than the simple value technologies discussed above. We can write software that can *itself* control currencies, shares, or rewards points. This “software agent” would be more like an independent economic entity. Living on the blockchain, it would be able to send, receive, or hold money — whatever it was programmed to do. Maybe it even provides a useful service to people, or to other software, for which it is paid.\n\nThe question people have begun to ask, in other words, is: can we make companies out of code?\n\n\n---\n\nOk, let’s back up. What would it mean for there to be software that “lives” on a blockchain?\n\nYou understand that bitcoin is a currency-like blockchain application. It was built to let people send, receive, and hold bitcoin. Bitcoin’s blockchain is structured like a *ledger* — a long list of transactions that records who has control over every amount of bitcoin that exists. It was built to do this one thing.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that the Bitcoin blockchain is a big computer that runs only one program. The program lets you move bitcoin from one address to another, and that’s about it. You can’t write *new* programs, or install entirely new software, or do much of anything beyond simple transactions.\n\nBut what if you *could* write new programs, install new software? What if there was a blockchain that had the same fundamental benefits as the bitcoin blockchain, but gave anyone the ability to write code that would run on it — not just transactions of a currency-like token, but things with additional rules & complexity… like shares, rewards points, or corporations?\n\nThis is the idea behind another blockchain called Ethereum. It comes with a “built in” set of programming languages that let anyone write code that “runs” on the Ethereum blockchain in a way similar to how a bitcoin transaction “runs” on the bitcoin blockchain. Instead of simply tracking balances of bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain tracks the *state* of all of the programs that are stored on it.\n\nA software agent can “live” on the Ethereum blockchain in the sense that the code that constitutes it is stored on the blockchain. Because there is always consensus on the state of the blockchain — just like there is always consensus on the state of who owns what bitcoin — the program will always behave as functioned. It cannot be altered or deleted unless it was programmed to allow it to be altered or deleted. Once it’s on the blockchain, it can be autonomous — it doesn’t depend on any individual computer to survive. It exists on thousands of computers all over the world, and every copy is kept in perfect sync by the blockchain.\n\nCrucially, for our purposes, these software agents can natively control money. In the case of Ethereum, they can control balances of Ether, the native token of that blockchain. They can also control *other* smart agents, or any other program on the blockchain. In short, they can be programmed to perform any operation that *people* can perform within the Ethereum system.\n\n![“Syndics of the Drapers’ Guild”, Rembrandt](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FSpP47rjNhy5TQ0lcSYNRw.png)\n\nIn the first post, we discussed how blockchain technology might cut out middlemen. Firms like Western Union sit in the middle of a simple transaction — moving money from A to B — and extract a fee. Bitcoin, by letting anyone anywhere send money for free, can compete with the service provided by Western Union.\n\nThe promise of blockchain “smart agents” is that they allow blockchain technology to cut out other kinds of middlemen, too. Even ones that provide complex services, and sit in the middle of complex transactions. At the top of this post I said the question was: can we make companies out of code? A better formulation might be: can we write code that can *compete* with services today only offered by companies?\n\nOne of the most promising areas for this to happen is in peer to peer marketplaces, where a company sits in the middle of complex transactions facilitated by technology. For instance, transactions where a rider pays another person a small fee in exchange for a ride.\n\nUber runs a service that connects riders to drivers. When a user requests a ride, Uber’s software matches them to a nearby driver. When the trip is verified as complete, the software calculates the fee based on the phone’s GPS, and facilitates the transfer of money from the consumer to the driver. Uber takes a 20% cut.\n\nMaybe a blockchain service could offer something similar. The core business logic — how to match drivers and riders, how to verify trips are complete, how to calculate fees — would be set in place & guaranteed by a blockchain. Payment is, of course, handled over the same platform. There is no legal entity, because there doesn’t have to be — this is all just software that a community of people have created for public use. Beyond the small fees paid as part of transactions on the blockchain, there is no entity to take a cut — which means either lower prices for riders, larger profits for drivers, or both in lesser amounts.\n\nThis blockchain “ride sharing” platform wouldn’t so much be a *company* as a protocol. Think of it like email. No one *owns* email: it is just a widely accepted protocol — a system of agreed upon rules — for exchanging information. But there are many email *clients* made by companies that let people use the email protocol.\n\nA blockchain ridesharing protocol would simply be a set of rules — enforced by the blockchain’s lock-step consensus — that define how to enter into a certain type of transaction: exchanging money for a ride. There would be many clients — apps on your phone — that would let you interface with it. But the underlying service — matching, and transfer of funds — would be facilitated by the blockchain.\n\n\n---\n\nOf course, Uber does more than match riders and drivers. They provide many other services that improve on their core offering in some way. They make software that makes it easy & convenient to call a ride. They provide an identity and reputation system for riders & drivers. They are a brand, and they’ve spent a lot of money advertising their services and creating new markets for their product.\n\nOne mistake many blockchain evangelists make is discounting the importance of these other functions. A good piece of technology is necessary but not sufficient for success as a product — especially when the product is something new or unfamiliar. I believe that an open source community could build an excellent ride sharing protocol, but I do not believe they could run an effective nationwide sales organization.\n\nBut maybe we don’t have to, in some cases. Uber has already created the market for technology-driven ridesharing. Maybe a “no name” version could compete. It wouldn’t come with all the bells and whistles at first, but it *would* be cheaper.\n\nWe might enter a world where there are *innovator* marketplace services and *generic* marketplace services. Uber, AirBnB and others had the idea, proved the technology, and changed consumer habits to build the market. But once the market exists — once renting out your apartment is simply *a thing you do* — there might be room for a generic version, run entirely by code, to compete with lower prices and by returning nearly the whole share of revenue to labour.", "timestamp": 1631751586, "digest": "32zXoqHSKkETAsm3S8BO7DfpNvZoGGl1Xy1qy7gAQRY", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}

This was part 6 of 7 in a series of posts released under the pseudonym Creole.*\n\n\n---\n\nYou’re up early for work this morning, in the kitchen making coffee. In the backyard, out the window above the sink, is your landpad & charging station, decorated with the bright bold outlines of its QR address.\n\nOn the landpad sits the delivery drone, charging quietly. As its batteries fill, small amounts of money are paid into your house’s account every few kilowatts. It could charge lots of places — there are cheaper sources of power available of course —but in the end the drone cares about location. Your backyard is close to several distribution centres and a dense neighbourhood that makes a lot of purchases that are in the right weight category for this model. It’s a nice bit of cash every month. Some neighbourhoods tried to ban renting backyard space. It worked in some places, but others weren’t happy having to pay a higher average delivery fee for drones having to charge farther away.\n\nThis drone is one of several that have often used your landpad over the last few weeks. When it landed for the first time you thumbed through the ownership structure. Unlike the last few that took up residency in your backyard, this one owns itself. When it was built it was owned 50% by the manufacturer, and the remainder split between a variety of private investors, pension funds, and a bundle of smaller shareholders. But last year, a charity collective purchased a majority of the shares and set it on a path to self-ownership, voting the drone to take its profits and invest in purchasing its own shares. Last April, the drone purchased the final shares and became sovereign.\n\nSo the drone owns itself. You had heard of these before but hadn’t contracted with one. A bit novel, but in the end it was a delivery drone like any other. The collective that did this has some ideological motivation for setting devices on a path to self-sovereignty, but it doesn’t seem to make a lot of business sense to you. Drones can’t make strategic decisions. Traditionally owned drones have shareholders who can instruct it to upgrade itself with new processors, or even scrap the drone for parts when it makes economic sense to do so. But drones themselves aren’t capable of doing much more than deliver packages and recharge themselves.\n\nBut new business models and services for delivery drones have appeared to mitigate this problem. This drone outsources strategic decisions to a streaming management service — a distributed organization of enthusiasts, experts, predictive algorithms, and other drones that provides strategic direction services for a fee. The management service comes up with broad outlines of a strategy for its collective of subscribing drones, and distributes instructions out to them. Beyond making sure the drones remain competitive with upgrades, the service performs high-level management functions like trying to predict demand. Drones are instructed to take up landing leases in neighbourhoods where demand for a new product might spike, or where a new distribution point is about to open. Drones report their outcomes back to the management service, which then refines its strategy accordingly. The drones cooperate with each other where appropriate to avoid competing directly, and there’s some form of equalization payment constantly flowing among the collective to ensure individual drones don’t suffer too much from unforeseen market conditions — a safety net.\n\nThe drones pay a small streaming fee to the collective for access to its decision making structure. Not just self-owning drones — many drones owned by corporate interests also subscribe to streaming management services to run their drones in an efficient and competitive manner. Everything, of course, is instant and automated. Tiny payment channels opening and closing between hundreds of thousands of drones and the ecosystem of services that support them, trading value and other information between each other seamlessly. Vast arrays of smart contracts flicker into form to guide every interaction, a web of rights and obligations connecting drones to their owners, their insurers, their customers, and their chosen management service. Contracts being altered, closed, wound up, abandoned as market realities change or participants form new strategic alliances, to better take advantage of the shifting demand from consumers who rely on these fleets of robots for the movement of physical goods.\n\nYou thumb through the drone’s identity page and notice a field you hadn’t seen filled in before. It might be a cute joke — or maybe they really believe this stuff — but the collective that set this drone on a path towards self-ownership also gave it a name. This drone is Russell.\n\n![by Christopher Michel CC 2.0\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mjCDPXzuGwYbSNRp6dKk9.png?height=1067&width=1600)\n\nRussell’s battery is fully charged and it will waste no time waiting on the ground. While it was charging it was listening to the constant stream of contract requests being sent out by every distribution point within the relevant radius, tracking them as they were announced, bid on, and secured by other drones. Once the battery was charged, Russell secured the first contract it could that met its margin requirements and headed towards the distribution point, a local coffee roaster. The drone lifts off. Within a few minutes, another drone will have landed to take its place to charge before returning to the skies.\n\nThe coffee roaster is a few blocks away. The drone identifies the QR-addressed landpad on the roof of the shop where a small bright yellow box sits. The drone picks up the box and sends a message to the smart contract created when it accepted the offer from the coffee shop. The coffee shop receives a notification that the box has been picked up, which it passes onto the customer’s phone. A payment channel opens up between the roastery and Russell, and small amounts of currency begin to be transferred at the agreed-upon time/distance rate as the drone begins moving towards its destination.\n\nThe roastery needs to know that the drone is taking a direct route. Not that the drone would ever behave in any other way — why would it risk it? But the loose, decentralized network of commerce & code that facilitates our daily activities depends on provable trust.\n\nPart of the contract between the Russell & the roastery was an agreement to use a decentralized geolocation service called Beholder. As Russel flies towards its destination Beholder instructs the drone to use its cameras to pick out obscure but easily identifiable features of the landscape around it, and then answer a question about that feature. Is the garage door of this house open? Is the streetlight at the intersection of 4th and Broadway currently green or red? Beholder contracts out to other drones (and other non-drone sensors, like cameras in cars or those installed on homes) to generate the challenges & verify Russell’s answers. Where possible, sensors are also used to identify Russell visually and confirm its location, and report back to the Beholder network. All of the sensors involved are paid small amounts of value for their role in Beholder’s service. It isn’t unbreakable — that’s not the point. But the cost of breaking it is high enough to reach a minimum threshold of trust in the drone’s location. Distributed, autonomous crypto-economics in action.\n\nThe drone arrives at its location and deposits the box in the backyard of a two story brownstone. The delivery pad scans a code on the underside of the box and signs a message to the contract signalling delivery once the box’s weight is fully resting on the pad and the drone has released the cargo. The drone scans a code displayed by the delivery pad and signs a message back to the contract as well, to prove that it has delivered the box.\n\nSeveral things happen at once. The payment from the recipient for the small bag of coffee ($42.76, or 0.06127 ΞTH), held in escrow by the contract, is released to the coffee shop. The payment channel between the coffee shop and the drone is closed, its task complete, and the drone lifts off again having already secured its next delivery at the delicatessen a block over. A woman’s phone buzzes in bed to tell her that the coffee she ordered (Santa Barbara Blue, 30% Arabica, espresso grind) has arrived.\n\n\n---\n\nCover photo by [Skye Jones](https://www.flickr.com/photos/picaddiction/5345535792/in/photolist-99ngyd-9bUT6U-c941HS-d3P61S-6fCExT-gtVti-4mcDVG-8h2d7e-59pXsn-73Zbd9-2dFNqv-Dbjdz-6PSU9L-5Cd8qx-9dzESD-8TmWqe-5nb4bj-BwA8tT-7piDZx-7AW2nW-4ktfyR-b1eWMT-95nGRB-58xSMS-4p8u4i-3wStv6-87couj-mAnvnq-r2GHs-7ujZcW-83vvGw-KHt43-9h4etm-aWuWU-fPdt9F-LvpMY-6KUyL7-5bFvXz-4vc18c-dYKqJ-25zuWJ-hRZr21-jx8ZHr-4meyHQ-4Cryx-81XeDD-81Wuki-956bqU-22prkZ-4fuYtz), CC 2.0\n\n \\n ", "timestamp": 1631752233, "digest": "9z-4L4yXhEVQdRQ2uxG7Df6b7lg_n3oUzwjYXXWdFKQ", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}

{"id": "MWvrmIfcZoWso_ZU7iDvzIkhCu39pjRcDqGs7m0bmvY", "title": "A simple view of Ethereum", "body": "*👋 Note: Originally published on March 8, 2016 ([link](https://medium.com/@creole/3-a-platform-for-value-technologies-b9f1531f78e0)). This was part 7 of 7 in a series of posts released under the pseudonym Creole.*\n\n\n---\n\nImagine thousands of computers all over the world connected by the internet. Some are home PCs, some are laptops, some are servers sitting deep underground. But each of them runs the same computer program, which connects all of these computers into a network of equals.\n\nThis program sets out rules for how the computers should work together. How to talk to each other. How to store data. Specifically, this program lets them behave as though they were all together a single, world-spanning computer. Every one of the thousands of devices that makes up the whole does the same thing, in the same order, in lock-step. They’re all recording the same information and running the same programs. In a real sense, it *is* one computer. This computer is Ethereum.\n\nThe Ethereum world-computer is slow. It has to be. Every one of the thousands of component computers — which we will call “nodes” — is doing doing the same things at the same time. This also makes it expensive, compared to a regular computer. Every operation must be performed in parallel, all over the world, requiring hardware and electricity.\n\nBut the point of Ethereum isn’t to be fast or cheap. The point is to be trustworthy. Any program that runs on Ethereum is guaranteed to run the same way everywhere, on every node. Data stored on Ethereum is available everywhere, and it is permanent. Ethereum is a place to run programs and store data that are *simple*, but for which trust is paramount.\n\nImagine you need to record something important. Like ownership of a house. It’s a simple piece of information, but it must have permanence. You need to be sure, first, that no one else can delete or edit this information. You also need to be sure it will always be there— so that even years later, you can refer to it as proof of ownership. And you need other people to be able to see it, and to be able to verify for themselves that it is authentic, and has not been edited. Ethereum lets you do this.\n\nOr, imagine that you need to run a simple piece of code. The code is an agreement between two parties. It’s a bet — Alice receives money if the price of oil goes down, Bob receives money if the price goes up. Both parties must have confidence that the program will operate in the way they intend, and that it cannot be deleted or edited without their permission. Alice wins. Ethereum lets them do this, too.\n\nIt turns out there are many situations where we do not need fast or powerful computers, just trustworthy ones. People are already building applications on Ethereum that take advantage of this. Devices like [locks or cars that can respond to payments of cryptocurrency](http://slock.it/), or make payments themselves. [Voting and governance systems](http://boardroom.to/) that are automatically enforced. [Prediction markets](http://www.augur.net/) where people can bet on future events. [Triple-entry accounting systems](https://consensys.net/ventures/spokes/). [Platforms for musicians to sell their music](http://ujomusic.com/), without anyone else getting a cut. These applications are only the first — the network is not yet even a year old.\n\nOur world is full of systems that depend on trust. Any activity that involves money, value, property, or control requires a way to create trust, to convince people that they can rely on it. No one engages in trade or casts their vote unless they have confidence that the system will work as it is supposed to work. Today, we rely on trusted intermediaries for this purpose. Banks, financial institutions, legal systems, and governments all act as middlemen in different contexts.\n\nNow we have a new way to create trust, a new technology unlike anything that has existed before. It doesn’t rely on any person or company or government. It doesn’t exist in any one place and can’t be permanently destroyed. Anyone can use it to create trust, and to create applications or services that are inherently trustworthy.\n\nThe traditional middleman won’t disappear. But they face a radically new form of competition.", "timestamp": 1631752545, "digest": "KfFgVMiNvRuN-DUVKg01EKrXQWkVVTuMPe9C6FsxgPI", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}
{"id": "08E6SGsAp2UA9CaNvW8YfspbVQt47Trbvq_mEPtmAd8", "title": "Player: A Protocol for Continuous NFTs", "body": "A few weeks ago I [introduced](https://neuroswish.mirror.xyz/2IlOa5B-eMCuSMTGjYq4lsdPRzOwqqIqy9XzHycsmrY) Verse, a protocol I’m working on to solve the problem of legitimacy-constrained social networks. At that time, I described Verse as a protocol for “multiplayer cryptomedia”. Some things have changed.\n\nWhile Verse is still focused on building an exponentially better model for multiplayer networks, it won’t be implemented through creating a new cryptomedia standard. But more on that backstory in a future post.\n\nWhile building Verse, one of the fundamental building block’s I’ve thought a lot about is the bonding curve. While primarily used in DeFi applications (like Uniswap) to enable automated market making, I started to think about how bonding curves could be used to solve some of the problems that have repeatedly been encountered with NFTs, especially over the last few months.\n\n### Artificial Scarcity & FOMO\n\nToday, the opportunity cost of logging off of Twitter for even a few hours can literally be millions of dollars. For example, consider [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject). Those who minted one of the limited 7799 bags immediately saw their investment (simply a gas fee) exponentially increase in value as [people](https://github.com/Anish-Agnihotri/dhof-loot) [started](https://twitter.com/jacksondame) to [build](https://twitter.com/willpapper/status/1433243941449568259?lang=en) out [experiences](https://www.lootcharacter.com/) exclusively for bag-holders.\n\nWhile those with Loot bags were deservedly excited for the ecosystem to develop so quickly, those without bags felt disappointment and anger at not being able to participate in a game without paying thousands of dollars as an entry fee.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1433157655581761538?s=20](https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1433157655581761538?s=20)\n\nDom, opposed to the idea of having to pay-to-participate, developed a Synthetic Loot contract which enabled anyone with an Ethereum address to have ticket into the Loot universe.\n\n[https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1432854537740734464?s=20](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1432854537740734464?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1433110413827317762?s=20](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1433110413827317762?s=20)\n\nThe creation of Synthetic Loot (and subsequent mLoot) raised discussions about the fundamentals of scarcity which have been a defining trait of every major NFT project.\n\n[https://twitter.com/jacksondahl/status/1434205098280845312?s=20](https://twitter.com/jacksondahl/status/1434205098280845312?s=20)\n\nFor certain applications, scarcity is a bedrock feature critical for success. Herein lies the [social token paradox](https://gaby.mirror.xyz/zqchiBQhWWS49gaabLU92-BUUwfBL5aHCtNT88VTI8o), which can be readily extended to NFT communities. For example, CryptoPunks wouldn’t be valuable if there was a continuous supply that anyone could mint. This is because the utility of CryptoPunks is primarily as an identity club. And I don’t mean that in a bad way at all. In fact, the opposite. The value of a club gets diluted when anyone and everyone can join, because different factions with opposing values inevitably emerge. Because there are only 10k CryptoPunks, the integrity of the club is maintained through imposing scarcity and aligning values among members. The CryptoPunks community is respected because many of the holders are active leaders in the broader Ethereum community and the relatively small size of their tribe allows them to more easily form a collective identity than if there were, say, 1 million punks.\n\nOn the other hand, Loot is its own universe - a collection of experiences that form an infinite meta-game. The utility of a Loot bag isn’t for identity signaling; each Loot bag primarily serves as a key to unlocking virtual worlds and bottom-up experiences made by passionate members of the community. As such, it’s easy to see that the long-term success of the Loot ecosystem is inversely correlated with high barriers-to-entry. Dom realized this early on.\n\nAs we think about the future of NFT-centric universes and bottom-up communities, relying on auction-based market systems for acquiring digital objects isn’t always ideal. Often, creators are forced to mint and sell NFTs through auctions because it’s the only way for them to earn via royalties and get compensated appropriately based on market demand (it’s important to note that Dom didn’t take any fees or royalties from secondary Loot sales). But for any NFT project focused on building digital worlds that can scale, it’s necessary to build a new system for NFT sales that incentivizes long-term asset appreciation while also eliminating the barrier-to-entry for new participants.\n\n### Liquidity (or lack thereof)\n\nAnother problem with many of today’s NFTs are that they’re pretty illiquid. On the seller side, unless you own an extremely valuable (\\~0.1%) NFT like a punk or ape, you have to list your NFT on a marketplace like Opensea and wait for someone to buy it or make a bid. Additionally, there’s the work of appropriately appraising your NFT’s value based on previous sales, the current market climate, and other factors.\n\nOn the buyer side, if you’re lucky, the NFT you’re after will be listed on a marketplace with a “buy now” option. However, in many cases if the NFT you want isn’t listed for sale, you have to track down the current owner(s), find out if they’re interested in selling, submit a bid, wait for an acceptance, negotiate, etc. Ack.\n\nSurely there’s a way to make NFT markets more liquid. Surely…\n\n## Continuous NFTs\n\nIntroducing Player, a protocol for continuous NFTs. The Player protocol is focused on building a new economic system for NFTs to mitigate the pitfalls of artificial scarcity and illiquidity that aren’t suited for the next generation of NFT-based virtual worlds and bottom-up communities.\n\nAt a high-level, think of a Player contract as hybrid of ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards. For example, if I want to buy 75 $FWB, I can go on my Rainbow wallet and pay the corresponding amount of ETH, and I receive 75 fungible $FWB tokens in return.\n\nNow, imagine that instead of receiving the 75 fungible $FWB tokens, I’m instead minted an ERC-721 FWB NFT. This NFT looks and functions identically for everyone who buys $FWB, regardless of how much they bought. Under the hood, though, my specific NFT keeps note that its value is equal to 75 $FWB tokens. I can use this NFT for whatever. If and when I don’t want the NFT anymore, I can burn it and receive ETH according to the current exchange rate for the 75 $FWB tokens that my NFT is worth.\n\nSpecifically, when a creator deploys a new Player contract, the creator specifies a token URI, just like when minting any traditional ERC-721 NFT. Each contract is governed by a bonding curve, enabling an instantly-liquid market. To mint an NFT from the contract, a buyer specifies the amount of continuous tokens he wants to buy which represents the value of his specific NFT. The buyer purchases that number of continuous tokens, and is minted an NFT in return. If the buyer ever wants to sell the NFT, he can do so by sending the NFT back to the contract, which will burn the NFT and send the user the corresponding number of continuous tokens in return (which are then converted to ETH according to the current continuous token-ETH exchange rate). Additionally, creators can specify a transaction fee and receive royalties every time tokens are purchased.\n\nWhile I believe this protocol has many potential applications, I’m most excited for uses involving items or skins for crypto-native games. Because the price of a continuous NFT is directly correlated with supply, holders of the NFT are directly incentivized to increase demand for the NFT by building experiences and features around it. I’m also excited for other people to extend the protocol and introduce extensions like tiers. For example, if someone buys 100 tokens for their NFT, maybe it has special cosmetics that distinguish it from someone who only buys 0.0001 tokens for their NFT. The core functionality of the NFT (like unlocking access to a community), however, would remain the same.\n\nIn this way, Player NFTs function more like multiplayer stocks than singular assets. Anyone can buy a piece of Tesla stock, whether it’s millions-of-dollars-worth or just a few-cents-worth. Either way, you own Tesla in your portfolio. Similarly, with Player NFTs, you can own an asset and join a community of holders no matter how much money you have to contribute. Of course, however, those with more shares will receive more upside if the NFT becomes highly demanded than those who own a small number of shares. Therefore, Player NFTs, through their limitless supply and free-market pricing system, enable a sort of native fractionalization and built-in economy for digital objects.\n\nToday, I’m [open-sourcing](https://github.com/kcherukuri/player-contracts) the V0 for the Player protocol to find other people who are interested in its capabilities, reviewing and testing the code, and making improvements.  Important note: **DO NOT USE THESE CONTRACTS ON MAINNET OR WITH REAL FUNDS. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN AUDITED OR ROBUSTLY TESTED YET AND YOU COULD LOSE FUNDS. YOU’VE BEEN WARNED**. Seriously. I’m not kidding. Don’t use these contracts with real ETH or deploy them for others to use. The purpose of this post is to find other people interested in building a robust V1 and interface over the next few days.

{"id": "ST088UF_1HG-RLpcDbXWDhK54nW5QnI60g1dUZ5NSek", "title": "Player: A Protocol for Continuous NFTs", "body": "A few weeks ago I [introduced](https://neuroswish.mirror.xyz/2IlOa5B-eMCuSMTGjYq4lsdPRzOwqqIqy9XzHycsmrY) Verse, a protocol I’m working on to solve the problem of legitimacy-constrained social networks. At that time, I described Verse as a protocol for “multiplayer cryptomedia”. Some things have changed.\n\nWhile Verse is still focused on building an exponentially better model for multiplayer networks, it won’t be implemented through creating a new cryptomedia standard. But more on that backstory in a future post.\n\nWhile building Verse, one of the fundamental building block’s I’ve thought a lot about is the bonding curve. While primarily used in DeFi applications (like Uniswap) to enable automated market making, I started to think about how bonding curves could be used to solve some of the problems that have repeatedly been encountered with NFTs, especially over the last few months.\n\n### Artificial Scarcity & FOMO\n\nToday, the opportunity cost of logging off of Twitter for even a few hours can literally be millions of dollars. For example, consider [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject). Those who minted one of the limited 7799 bags immediately saw their investment (simply a gas fee) exponentially increase in value as [people](https://github.com/Anish-Agnihotri/dhof-loot) [started](https://twitter.com/jacksondame) to [build](https://twitter.com/willpapper/status/1433243941449568259?lang=en) out [experiences](https://www.lootcharacter.com/) exclusively for bag-holders.\n\nWhile those with Loot bags were deservedly excited for the ecosystem to develop so quickly, those without bags felt disappointment and anger at not being able to participate in a game without paying thousands of dollars as an entry fee.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1433157655581761538?s=20](https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1433157655581761538?s=20)\n\nDom, opposed to the idea of having to pay-to-participate, developed a Synthetic Loot contract which enabled anyone with an Ethereum address to have ticket into the Loot universe.\n\n[https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1432854537740734464?s=20](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1432854537740734464?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1433110413827317762?s=20](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1433110413827317762?s=20)\n\nThe creation of Synthetic Loot (and subsequent mLoot) raised discussions about the fundamentals of scarcity which have been a defining trait of every major NFT project.\n\n[https://twitter.com/jacksondahl/status/1434205098280845312?s=20](https://twitter.com/jacksondahl/status/1434205098280845312?s=20)\n\nFor certain applications, scarcity is a bedrock feature critical for success. Herein lies the [social token paradox](https://gaby.mirror.xyz/zqchiBQhWWS49gaabLU92-BUUwfBL5aHCtNT88VTI8o), which can be readily extended to NFT communities. For example, CryptoPunks wouldn’t be valuable if there was a continuous supply that anyone could mint. This is because the utility of CryptoPunks is primarily as an identity club. And I don’t mean that in a bad way at all. In fact, the opposite. The value of a club gets diluted when anyone and everyone can join, because different factions with opposing values inevitably emerge. Because there are only 10k CryptoPunks, the integrity of the club is maintained through imposing scarcity and aligning values among members. The CryptoPunks community is respected because many of the holders are active leaders in the broader Ethereum community and the relatively small size of their tribe allows them to more easily form a collective identity than if there were, say, 1 million punks.\n\nOn the other hand, Loot is its own universe - a collection of experiences that form an infinite meta-game. The utility of a Loot bag isn’t for identity signaling; each Loot bag primarily serves as a key to unlocking virtual worlds and bottom-up experiences made by passionate members of the community. As such, it’s easy to see that the long-term success of the Loot ecosystem is inversely correlated with high barriers-to-entry. Dom realized this early on.\n\nAs we think about the future of NFT-centric universes and bottom-up communities, relying on auction-based market systems for acquiring digital objects isn’t always ideal. Often, creators are forced to mint and sell NFTs through auctions because it’s the only way for them to earn via royalties and get compensated appropriately based on market demand (it’s important to note that Dom didn’t take any fees or royalties from secondary Loot sales). But for any NFT project focused on building digital worlds that can scale, it’s necessary to build a new system for NFT sales that incentivizes long-term asset appreciation while also eliminating the barrier-to-entry for new participants.\n\n### Liquidity (or lack thereof)\n\nAnother problem with many of today’s NFTs are that they’re pretty illiquid. On the seller side, unless you own an extremely valuable (\\~0.1%) NFT like a punk or ape, you have to list your NFT on a marketplace like Opensea and wait for someone to buy it or make a bid. Additionally, there’s the work of appropriately appraising your NFT’s value based on previous sales, the current market climate, and other factors.\n\nOn the buyer side, if you’re lucky, the NFT you’re after will be listed on a marketplace with a “buy now” option. However, in many cases if the NFT you want isn’t listed for sale, you have to track down the current owner(s), find out if they’re interested in selling, submit a bid, wait for an acceptance, negotiate, etc. Ack.\n\nSurely there’s a way to make NFT markets more liquid. Surely…\n\n## Continuous NFTs\n\nIntroducing Player, a protocol for continuous NFTs. The Player protocol is focused on building a new economic system for NFTs to mitigate the pitfalls of artificial scarcity and illiquidity that aren’t suited for the next generation of NFT-based virtual worlds and bottom-up communities.\n\nAt a high-level, think of a Player contract as hybrid of ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards. \n\nFor example, with ERC-20 tokens, if I want to buy 75 $FWB, I can go on my Rainbow wallet and pay the corresponding amount of ETH, and I receive 75 fungible $FWB tokens in return.\n\nNow, imagine that instead of receiving the 75 fungible $FWB tokens, I’m instead minted an ERC-721 FWB NFT. This NFT looks and functions identically for everyone who buys $FWB, regardless of how much they bought. Under the hood, though, my specific NFT keeps note that its value is equal to 75 $FWB tokens. I can use this NFT for whatever. If and when I don’t want the NFT anymore, I can burn it and receive ETH according to the current exchange rate for the 75 $FWB tokens that my NFT is worth.\n\nSpecifically, when a creator deploys a new Player contract, the creator specifies a token URI, just like when minting any traditional ERC-721 NFT. Each contract is governed by a bonding curve, enabling an instantly-liquid market. To mint an NFT from the contract, a buyer specifies the amount of continuous tokens he wants to buy which represents the value of his specific NFT. The buyer purchases that number of continuous tokens, and is minted an NFT in return. If the buyer ever wants to sell the NFT, he can do so by sending the NFT back to the contract, which will burn the NFT and send the user the corresponding number of continuous tokens in return (which are then converted to ETH according to the current continuous token-ETH exchange rate). Additionally, creators can specify a transaction fee and receive royalties every time tokens are purchased.\n\nWhile I believe this protocol has many potential applications, I’m most excited for uses involving items or skins for crypto-native games. Because the price of a continuous NFT is directly correlated with supply, holders of the NFT are directly incentivized to increase demand for the NFT by building experiences and features around it. I’m also excited for other people to extend the protocol and introduce extensions like tiers. For example, if someone buys 100 tokens for their NFT, maybe it has special cosmetics that distinguish it from someone who only buys 0.0001 tokens for their NFT. The core functionality of the NFT (like unlocking access to a community), however, would remain the same.\n\nIn this way, Player NFTs function more like multiplayer stocks than singular assets. Anyone can buy a piece of Tesla stock, whether it’s millions-of-dollars-worth or just a few-cents-worth. Either way, you own Tesla in your portfolio. Similarly, with Player NFTs, you can own an asset and join a community of holders no matter how much money you have to contribute. Of course, however, those with more shares will receive more upside if the NFT becomes highly demanded than those who own a small number of shares. Therefore, Player NFTs, through their limitless supply and free-market pricing system, enable a sort of native fractionalization and built-in economy for digital objects.\n\nToday, I’m [open-sourcing](https://github.com/kcherukuri/player-contracts) the V0 for the Player protocol to find other people who are interested in its capabilities, reviewing and testing the code, and making improvements.  Important note: **DO NOT USE THESE CONTRACTS ON MAINNET OR WITH REAL FUNDS. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN AUDITED OR ROBUSTLY TESTED YET AND YOU COULD LOSE FUNDS. YOU’VE BEEN WARNED**. Seriously. I’m not kidding. Don’t use these contracts with real ETH or deploy them for others to use. The purpose of this post is to find other people interested in building a robust V1 and interface over the next few days.

{"id": "26y9bixLvtwTfRVDMMgNdiPCpPoLYlSH8XLNDmMI7CY", "title": "The Eightfold Path to DAOism", "body": "*Written by: Maria Gomez ([@MyPaoG](https://twitter.com/MyPaoG)), Julia Rosenberg ([@JulzRoze](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze)), and Chun Poon ([@zkchun](https://twitter.com/zkchun))*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0Zhq3JUuUP_AROL3nJKHO.png?height=500&width=1000)\n\nDAOs, decentralized autonomous organizations, have recently regained the attention of the crypto community. A new DAO seems to popup everyday—from [collective NFT buyers](https://pleasr.org/) to [syndicate DAO frameworks](https://syndicate.io/). Not only has consumer excitement for DAOs exploded, organizations of different shapes and sizes are increasingly eager to begin their journey to decentralization.\n\nYet, throughout this DAO boom, there has been little clarity on what these new organizations *really* are. Formal definitions are a good place to start when things are new, but there does not seem to be one for DAO—even though many attempts have been made. *What makes a DAO, a DAO? Why is it that we, as end-users, can so freely join and cooperate with new frens in the DAOs we love? And what could be useful tools for DAOs to optimize for cooperation and coordination?*\n\nIn this article, we will walk through how we think about these topics at Orca Protocol—starting from the basics.\n\n## Back to Basics\n\nDAOs are a new type of organization and to understand the key characteristics of a DAO, it is helpful to review some blockchain fundamentals. A programmable blockchain, like Ethereum, enables applications to run on a decentralized trust system—removing our need to rely on any single actor as an intermediary of trust. The trust system uses a consensus mechanism to ensure that network participants can come to an agreement on the state of the network. If competing parties, each with their own incentives and agendas, can come to an agreement about the state of the network, then us end-users can rest assured that our funds are saifu. Another way of looking at it, is that blockchains convert computing power (in the case of Proof of Work) into trust. Everyone is keeping an eye on everyone else, so that we can all keep performing economic activity on the network.\n\nIn truly decentralized systems, no one needs permission to join in on this action. The underlying consensus algorithm is publicly accessible. This means that anyone can become a network participant and help verify the behavior of other participants. This is the *key innovation* we have all gravitated towards in the crypto space.\n\nDecentralized trust systems have some very nice features to them. They welcome participation from anyone willing to contribute, regardless of borders and nations. Since there is no central point of control, they are censorship resistant, and do not rely on third parties to get trivial tasks done—contrast that with how hard it can be to send money from one country to another using traditional channels. These features culminate in a sufficient level of redundancy against corruption and other failures that traditional, centralized systems are exposed to.\n\n## Trust Blanket\n\nSo what does the above have to do with DAOs? The public blockchain and its native currency, also known as the base layer, act as a cozy blanket of trust that applications can be built on. The smart contracts of these applications are deployed on the blockchain, thereby enjoying the warmth of the trust blanket provided by the base layer. For the end-user, this means that apps can be interacted with, without having to trust a central figure. Additionally, the app’s functions are automated, so in many cases we do not even have to trust our counterpart—for example, in the case of a token swap. Of course, this is assuming the smart contract code is not faulty to begin with, but that discussion is outside of the scope of this article.\n\nIf Vitalik Buterin were the only participant in the Ethereum ecosystem, he would be bored out of his mind pretty quickly. The point of a blockchain is for many people to use it. An application layer, sitting cozily on top of a secure base layer, *lowers the cost of trust* for the end-user. This low cost of trust can be leveraged to form many new working relationships with other users—even pseudonymous users with gluttonous penguins as avatars. These working relationships between users form the coordination layer: the space where DAOs operate.\n\n## DAO Break-DAO-n\n\nWe often focus on the three word breakdown of *DAO*: decentralized, autonomous, organizations. All three are important, but discussing each letter independently does not accurately capture the relationship and prioritization of these three key elements.\n\nThe decentralization of an organization, as touched on earlier, is easily the most interesting and powerful aspect of being a DAO. It enables open, credibly neutral and censorship resistant systems, unbound by borders and nations.\n\nAutonomy and automation are essential characteristics. Automation refers to technologies that reduce human intervention in processes. Autonomy refers to the ability to be self-governed. These are not the same things, nor are they both implicitly present in every DAO.\n\nOrganization seems to be a blanket term to describe a collective ecosystem. DAOs are more like a country than an organization—made up of different sub-parts, factions, actors that attribute value to the ecosystem as a whole.\n\n## Boiling It DAO-n\n\nCurrently, there is no formal definition of what a DAO precisely is, nor are we interested in presenting you with a definitive answer here. There are, however, some key features that give a DAO its essence and make it different from traditional organizations. Keep in mind that traditional organizations can exist on-chain as well. This could make the operations of a public company more transparent and accessible, for example. But legal entities on the blockchain deserve an article of their own. From our observations, these are the features that permit DAOs to flourish and build towards a sustainable future.\n\n### 1 Automation at the Center, Humans at the Edges\n\nDAOs involve people interacting with each other around a protocol with encoded rules, which automates the purpose of the organization—automation at the center—and enforced on the blockchain through a consensus mechanism, i.e. the app layer and its cozy trust blanket. The community of the protocol is formed of loosely affiliated individuals or groups. A DAO emerges from the community working on the protocol. In many cases, a token is provided as an incentive for that work, but work can be performed for social reasons too.\n\nThere are some tasks that a protocol cannot perform on its own. It will require a human user to feed it inputs, within the bounds of the protocol’s automated rules—humans at the edges. Where humans are required to click on buttons, governance becomes relevant. After all, which human gets to click on the buttons? These humans at the edges must deal with the jurisdictions and the relevant regulations.\n\n### 2 Open Source and Blockchain-Based\n\nDAOs that control protocols must provide equal access for potential contributors and users. This helps maintain a level of trust and prevents centralization over time. Economic incentives and social empowerment lead to an emergence of an ecosystem of open source tools and protocols, enabling further growth and development. The infrastructure and tools should be composable with other tools in the DAO’s ecosystem to have staying power. Any participant in the DAO can provide open and transparent contributions for others to reuse. Knowledge sharing in a DAO is an open process; anyone can introduce a compelling new idea to mobilize and attract people to work on that idea. The tools are created for the public, but aggregate in the protocol. That said, members should be able to run whichever version of the protocol they believe the community should embrace.\n\n### 3 Independent Parties\n\nParticipants in a DAO can work independently on projects that they think will bring the most value to the protocol. Ideally, no one is standing in anyone’s way and the participants converge on a path that is mutually beneficial. Even though the participants are legally independent, they share values, goals and incentives, which enable their ability to cooperate, agree on fundamental decisions, and implement the DAO’s rules or architecture. A DAO should not be constrained by the resources or vision of one organization or person. This is one place where the advantage of low cost of trust shines through. A shared vision emerges from independent actors or parties working towards what they think is best for the protocol. The independent parties are agile by default—as new information becomes available, their views, vision, and direction can create new consensus among the community. Whoever does not agree with the consensus can, at any time, peace out from the community and fork the work into another direction. Finally, joining and leaving a DAO must be frictionless; the DAO should not be able to force a participant to work exclusively and indefinitely for that DAO.\n\n### 4 Internal Capital\n\nTokens are key for DAOs, because they bootstrap and fund the development of the protocol and its ecosystem. However, a token should not be treated as a fundraising mechanism or investment vehicle. This could lead to some funky legal consequences, depending on the jurisdiction the user is in. The token should not give rights to claim profits or dividends. It should be treated as an economic incentive and consensus medium. Economic incentives are still key to promoting contributions to a system. In exchange for their contributions, participants are rewarded with the protocol’s token. There is a clear incentive to commit time and effort to working for the protocol. The value accrued by the token increases as the protocol gets better at generating value—this could happen through new product launches or optimization of existing products. As long as the DAO’s frens can contribute freely and openly, the results of that work, and the value it brings, aggregates in the system and is captured by the token.\n\n### 5 Governance\n\nThe governance function of the token promotes long-term value and growth. It gives token holders the power to change the rules of the system when necessary and allocate the resources of the ecosystem through a decision making process. This is valuable for users as they become “owners” of the protocol. This results in stronger network effects, because the more useful a protocol is, the more valuable it becomes to govern it. A token-based governance model, however, comes with its own shortcomings—particularly at scale. There are ways to palliate these flaws, but this topic will be given its own article in the future. Governance is complex and difficult to get right—it is impossible to find a system that works perfectly in every organization. Token voting, as critical as we are of it, is and will remain a useful and necessary part of decentralized governance.\n\n### 6 Enable a Bottom-Up Structure\n\nBottom-Up does not mean leaderless. In fact, the system could be organized with a combination of bottom-up, modular and top-down processes—which is precisely what Orca Protocol enables. The community works together as independent parties—we call them *pods* at Orca. It should be possible for pods to freely organize and connect in whatever way they see fit.\n\nThis does not rule out the inclusion of top-down design. Actually, it is an essential part of intention-setting within the community. Founders can share their vision of what the protocol can become, and entice and inspire the community to follow that vision. This initial vision is key for the development of fundamental infrastructure, which then drives the emergence of bottom-up participation from individuals. With the right incentives in place, the top-down design can attract participants to build, implement and materialize that vision.\n\n### 7 Membership is Open\n\nAnyone can run a node to verify blocks and transaction data on the base layer. Or write smart contracts and deploy them on the blockchain to enrich the application layer. The same can be said for the coordination layer. Participating and contributing in a DAO is open and not limited to a select group of people. Mission critical aspects of the DAO, such as the main treasury, are not accessible to everyone but anyone could support or reject proposals, or write a proposal themselves. Participation is rewarded and keeps the system running according to its vision and rules.\n\n### 8 Collusion is A Bug\n\nIn a truly decentralized system, the common behavior of independent participants is to work for their own interests and profit instead of for a collective profit. This doesn’t mean that there are no collective values and missions that form a community. It just means that there is no common enterprise like in a traditional company. Since not every participant shares the same goal, colluding to make the outcome of the system favor specific participants is difficult, and successful collusion should not be seen as a legitimate activity.\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nThese are the essential features of a DAO, as we identify them at Orca Protocol. They are what makes a DAO different from a traditional organization. So different, in fact, that a DAO does not appear as an organization at all sometimes. A DAO is an ecosystem with loose operational borders that comprise coordination tools.\n\nOrca Protocol is proudly building tools for DAOs to reach their full potential by uncomplicating collaboration. Orca’s key tool is the pod primitive, a modular and flexible body to manage participation, shared assets, and organizational permissioning. This flexibility allows for dynamic and composable structures to be created around any party of actors within a DAO ecosystem, while introducing mechanisms for accountability, incentive alignment, and checks and balances. By creating a wrapper around the *people*, Orca enables bottom-up structures to thrive within decentralized ecosystems by giving collective power to groups of motivated actors—regardless of their initial token status.\n\nAdditional tooling is an essential piece to unlocking the true power, and true decentralization, of these project ecosystems. When we empower people to effectively coordinate within the open, public, neutral structure of a DAO, we enable an entirely new wave of work and human collaboration.\n\n# Read More\n\n* [Cryptonetwork Governance As Capital](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/2/19/cryptonetwork-governance-as-capital) by Joel Monegro\n* [DAOs, DACs, DAs and More: An Incomplete Terminology Guide](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/) by Vitalik Buterin\n* [Governance Tokens - The Good, the Bad, The Ugly](https://lexnode.substack.com/p/governance-tokens-the-good-the-bad) by Gabriel Shapiro\n\n## About Orca Protocol\n\nOrca Protocol makes governance accessible by creating tools around a DAO’s most basic primitive: people.\n\n* Visit our **[website](https://www.orcaprotocol.org/)**\n* Follow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/OrcaProtocol)**\n* Join our **[Discord](http://discord.gg/v9Bv9m32a6)**", "timestamp": 1631808007, "digest": "WVB26-PtNp8D_7A7DXNPhnOMEHnPrEP2NgJc0nRAqwo", "contributor": "0xF35d7Bd3be21Ee8d26703dA38D49f97601D94aa5"}
{"id": "9Km8X6LUKmF1QrhRhlCxUpc8dgJFDrycXMdsI0svHPQ", "title": "Thoughts on trying to become a farmer during a pandemic and a country tearing itself apart", "body": "> “Shelf of a field, green, within easy reach, the grass on it not yet high, papered with blue sky through which yellow has grown to make pure green, the surface colour of what the basin of the world contains, attendant field, shelf between sky and sea, fronted with a curtain of printed trees, friable at its edges, the corners of it rounded, answering the sun with heat, shelf on a wall through which from time to time a cuckoo is audible, shelf on which she keeps the invisible and intangible jars of her pleasure, field that I have always known, I am lying raised up on one elbow wondering whether in any direction I can see beyond where you stop. The wire around you is the horizon.”\n>\n> From *Field*, by John Berger\n\nI’ve spent countless hours this year clearing land. The property where we live in New York was owned for about 30 years by a couple that rarely used it, and they long ago stopped mowing the fields that used to be cattle pasture. Trees have marched forward from the edges of the woods. Most of them are pines that grow a foot taller every year. Because we’re working to re-establish a farm on the property, a lot of these young pines have to go.\n\nClearing land is slow work when done alone with simple tools. Becoming comfortable and familiar with the chainsaw was easy enough; the thrilling part is when you see the trunk begin to lean away from you ever so slightly and then quickly snap with a gutteral creak. Very slowly and then all at once. The hard part is cleaning up: removing each small limb, moving them into a pile to burn or chip, then bucking the larger limbs into shorter pieces that can be piled into or dragged behind the pickup. The slowness of the cleaning is characterized by a certain zen. The removal of a living thing from the land, for something new to grow, is bittersweet.\n\nThere are a few chores that continue to feel like chores. Re-baiting the mousetraps is one. Unfolded laundry another. Maybe they’re the chores that are most familiar from the pre-farm days. Over time even the chainsaw, even the tractor, will sit unused, I guess.\n\nWe’d been seriously looking for a place to farm for about a year and a half before we ended up here. I’ve known for a long time that I wanted to live and raise children in a rural area, with a small local community. It’s not how I was raised, and it’s not how I have ever lived before a year ago. If I was forced to point to a moment early in life that set me on this trajectory, I could probably argue it was my time spent in IRC rooms and on small forums as an early teenager.\n\nFor anyone who lives in a city long enough, Nature becomes a place to go -- a public park on the way home from the subway; a state park 30 minutes away by car; a weeklong national park vacation. It’s a space safely entered and exited, supporting a subset of rare Human activities. Many of us acknowledge that it’s the home of Animals, and we generally agree the Animals deserve a home. Rarely is it appreciated for its entropic tendencies. Generally those tendencies are cast only in destructive terms.\n\nThis is not an essay about climate change. I’m not talking about the impending chaos of accelerating rates of hurricane formations. This is not about how Nature Is In Control (although I do believe that).\n\nRather, I’m interested in minimizing the boundaries between my (our) ordered human life and the messiness of the woods. I hesitate to push back those boundaries, even if it’s in service of developing a place that approaches a certain harmony between chaos and order. I get over this hesitation by walking around the property over and over, feeling how I move through it efficiently (when we need to find a path for the tractor or truck) or not (when we want a place that promotes wandering). Trying to imprint the contours of the land onto my body.\n\nBerger’s field is a field of activity, a theater. I first read the essay about 15 years ago. For most of my life since then, I saw the field as the entire space of concern, the zone that could impart meaning upon both spectator and participant. This seemed a useful and accurate metaphor. But now I understand the field is also a moment, and explicitly incomplete. It’s a pause. There are some creatures which leave the security of the woods, wander serenely through cleared land, and disappear again between trees. Some creatures leave the woods by mistake, and immediately turn back. The blackbirds spend most of their days out of the woods; “their coming and going remains quite unaffected by the trains.” For both Human and Animal, the field is an irregular interruption. But it might facilitate thoughtful reflection.\n\nNow I’m thinking about another Berger essay, *The Eaters and the Eaten*:\n\n> “The principal regular meal. For the peasant this meal is usually at midday; for the bourgeois it is usually dinner in the evening. The practical reasons for this are so obvious that they need not be listed. What may be significant is that the peasant meal is in the middle of the day, surrounded by work. It is placed in the day’s stomach. The bourgeois meal comes after the day’s work and marks the transition between day and evening. It is closer to the day’s head (if the day begins with getting to the feet) and to dreams.\n>\n> At the peasant’s table the relationship between implements, food and eaters is intimate, and a value is conferred on use and handling. Each person has his own knife which he may well take out of his pocket. The knife is worn, used for many purposes other than eating, and usefully sharp. Whenever possible the same plate is kept throughout the meal, and between dishes it is cleaned with bread which is eaten. Each eater takes his share of the food and drink which are placed before all. For example: he holds the bread to his body, cuts a piece of it towards himself, and puts the bread down for another. Likewise with cheese or sausage. Contiguity as between uses, users and foods is treated as natural. There is a minimum of division.\n>\n> On the bourgeois table everything that can be is kept untouched and separate. Every dish has its own cutlery and plate. In general plates are not cleaned by eating — because eating and cleaning are distinct activities. Each eater (or a servant) holds the serving dish to allow another to serve himself. The meal is a series of discrete, untouched gifts.\n>\n> To the peasant all food represents work accomplished. The work may or may not have been his own or that of his family, but if it isn’t, the work represented is nevertheless directly exchangeable with his own work. Because food represents physical work, the eater’s body already ‘knows’ the food it is going to eat. (The peasant’s strong resistance to eating any ‘foreign’ food for the first time is partly because its origin in the work process is unknown.) He does not expect to be surprised by food — except, sometimes, by its quality. His food is familiar like his own body. Its action on his body is *continuous* with the previous action of the body (labour) on the food. He eats in the room in which the food is prepared and cooked.”\n\nAnd here it’s only appropriate to recall the videos that have become so popular lately, of Afghani or Pakistani peasants eating western foods like pizza for the first time.\n\nIn more normal times, I’m working away from home at least a third of the year.

Urban environments are built on substantial decentralization and anonymization of services; this builds a mindset of a large, mostly-invisible controlling force that keeps everything running for everybody. *Eating and cleaning are distinct activities.* Life is made as predictable as possible to make sure it runs as smoothly as possible for the greatest number of participants.

Most systems have a direct user-operator relationship by design, and those that aren’t (bureaucratic) are the source of endless complaints. The fire department is staffed by volunteers.\n\nRecently an acquaintance directed me towards Wendell Berry’s framework of exploitation and nurture, as discussed in his *Unsettling of America*:\n\n> “The standard of the exploiter is efficiency; the standard of the nurturer is care. The exploiter’s goal is money, profit; the nurturer’s goal is health—his land’s health, his own, his family’s, his community’s, his country’s. Whereas the exploiter asks of a piece of land only how much and how quickly it can be made to produce, the nurturer asks a question that is much more complex and difficult: What is its carrying capacity? \\[…\\] The competence of the exploiter is in organization; that of the nurturer is in order—a human order, that is, that accommodates itself both to other order and to mystery.”\n\nEarlier this afternoon I went to buy some parts for the tractor. One of the metal pins I needed was Made In India, and I momentarily felt a twang of unhappiness. In the past several years, and particularly this year, I've made a purposeful decision to buy products made in the United States as often as possible. I don't do this for nationalistic reasons, at least not directly. In general, I've found that Made In USA products are better-made and last longer, at least when it's an American brand, the same being true for Japanese brands made in Japan, or Italian in Italy -- localism generally implies highest possible quality. But I also prefer to buy these \"locally made\" goods because it means the motivations of the company are not pure profit; if that was the goal, they'd be exploiting workers in countries where worker protection laws are weaker and wages lower. This seems obvious maybe, but the higher quality of work must come in large part from the individual's higher quantity of pride in their work -- a skill developed as a result of nurturing at the individual level (through an apprenticeship, or through a long career at a single company) and at the group level (by implementing the Toyota Production System). The benefit of labor unions, for instance, is their ability to foster the conditions conducive to nurturing by creating friction between the company and the worker. They do not maximize for efficiency and exploitation.\n\nThere’s a connection here between pride taken in one’s work as a means to supporting one’s community -- a peasant mindset, Berger might say -- and why this pride disappears in urban environments. It’s not only because urban environments, and the culture around them, encourage capitalistic, bourgeois pursuits. It’s also because the very functional structure of urban environments cleaves the individual from their work. Their work goes out into the city and disappears. Their rewards are delivered from other sources, and often are provided by an easy access to credit. Ultimately, the rewards for work done, and the debts taken for rewards desired -- at the societal level -- are unevenly distributed throughout the entire system. History has shown where this leads.\n\nI can’t assert that all rural inhabitants retain the purity of the farmer’s mindset. Neither are all city creatures following their own social codes. Farhad Manjoo -- the NYTimes Op-Ed columnist (“lefties like myself who proudly believe in science and ostentatiously defer to expertise”) -- recently wrote, “I worry about life passing us by just as we’re trying to save it. If 2020 has taught me anything, it is to resist taking the future for granted.” This is the central talking point the right, and rural areas, have been articulating all year, and generally following -- returning to church, eating with friends, whatever. It’s also what the left has been communicating, through its actions, by going to the streets. All of this is about building up communities.

We who can should isolate so that those who can't isolate have a safer environment when they go to work. Sure, Zoom is a poor substitute for in-person visits, but it makes little sense to travel during these few weeks if you don't need to.”\n\nAs with all things, neither of the extremes is workable, at any level. The individual must, and does, make decisions about what to exploit and what to nurture.

{"id": "OGWUsrnDHx4GXTYe4PNRo6Fa9bchcAu86GrObTkjDkc", "title": "Thoughts on trying to become a farmer during a pandemic and a country tearing itself apart", "body": "> “Shelf of a field, green, within easy reach, the grass on it not yet high, papered with blue sky through which yellow has grown to make pure green, the surface colour of what the basin of the world contains, attendant field, shelf between sky and sea, fronted with a curtain of printed trees, friable at its edges, the corners of it rounded, answering the sun with heat, shelf on a wall through which from time to time a cuckoo is audible, shelf on which she keeps the invisible and intangible jars of her pleasure, field that I have always known, I am lying raised up on one elbow wondering whether in any direction I can see beyond where you stop. The wire around you is the horizon.”\n>\n> From *Field*, by John Berger\n\nI’ve spent countless hours this year clearing land. The property where we live in New York was owned for about 30 years by a couple that rarely used it, and they long ago stopped mowing the fields that used to be cattle pasture. Trees have marched forward from the edges of the woods. Most of them are pines that grow a foot taller every year. Because we’re working to re-establish a farm on the property, a lot of these young pines have to go.\n\nClearing land is slow work when done alone with simple tools. Becoming comfortable and familiar with the chainsaw was easy enough; the thrilling part is when you see the trunk begin to lean away from you ever so slightly and then quickly snap with a gutteral creak. Very slowly and then all at once. The hard part is cleaning up: removing each small limb, moving them into a pile to burn or chip, then bucking the larger limbs into shorter pieces that can be piled into or dragged behind the pickup. The slowness of the cleaning is characterized by a certain zen. The removal of a living thing from the land, for something new to grow, is bittersweet.\n\nThere are a few chores that continue to feel like chores. Re-baiting the mousetraps is one. Unfolded laundry another. Maybe they’re the chores that are most familiar from the pre-farm days. Over time even the chainsaw, even the tractor, will sit unused, I guess.\n\nWe’d been seriously looking for a place to farm for about a year and a half before we ended up here. I’ve known for a long time that I wanted to live and raise children in a rural area, with a small local community. It’s not how I was raised, and it’s not how I have ever lived before a year ago. If I was forced to point to a moment early in life that set me on this trajectory, I could probably argue it was my time spent in IRC rooms and on small forums as an early teenager.\n\nFor anyone who lives in a city long enough, Nature becomes a place to go -- a public park on the way home from the subway; a state park 30 minutes away by car; a weeklong national park vacation. It’s a space safely entered and exited, supporting a subset of rare Human activities. Many of us acknowledge that it’s the home of Animals, and we generally agree the Animals deserve a home. Rarely is it appreciated for its entropic tendencies. Generally those tendencies are cast only in destructive terms.\n\nThis is not an essay about climate change. I’m not talking about the impending chaos of accelerating rates of hurricane formations. This is not about how Nature Is In Control (although I do believe that).\n\nRather, I’m interested in minimizing the boundaries between my (our) ordered human life and the messiness of the woods. I hesitate to push back those boundaries, even if it’s in service of developing a place that approaches a certain harmony between chaos and order. I get over this hesitation by walking around the property over and over, feeling how I move through it efficiently (when we need to find a path for the tractor or truck) or not (when we want a place that promotes wandering). Trying to imprint the contours of the land onto my body.\n\nBerger’s field is a field of activity, a theater. I first read the essay about 15 years ago. For most of my life since then, I saw the field as the entire space of concern, the zone that could impart meaning upon both spectator and participant. This seemed a useful and accurate metaphor. But now I understand the field is also a moment, and explicitly incomplete. It’s a pause. There are some creatures which leave the security of the woods, wander serenely through cleared land, and disappear again between trees. Some creatures leave the woods by mistake, and immediately turn back. The blackbirds spend most of their days out of the woods; “their coming and going remains quite unaffected by the trains.” For both Human and Animal, the field is an irregular interruption. But it might facilitate thoughtful reflection.\n\nNow I’m thinking about another Berger essay, *The Eaters and the Eaten*:\n\n> “The principal regular meal. For the peasant this meal is usually at midday; for the bourgeois it is usually dinner in the evening. The practical reasons for this are so obvious that they need not be listed. What may be significant is that the peasant meal is in the middle of the day, surrounded by work. It is placed in the day’s stomach. The bourgeois meal comes after the day’s work and marks the transition between day and evening. It is closer to the day’s head (if the day begins with getting to the feet) and to dreams.\n>\n> At the peasant’s table the relationship between implements, food and eaters is intimate, and a value is conferred on use and handling. Each person has his own knife which he may well take out of his pocket. The knife is worn, used for many purposes other than eating, and usefully sharp. Whenever possible the same plate is kept throughout the meal, and between dishes it is cleaned with bread which is eaten. Each eater takes his share of the food and drink which are placed before all. For example: he holds the bread to his body, cuts a piece of it towards himself, and puts the bread down for another. Likewise with cheese or sausage. Contiguity as between uses, users and foods is treated as natural. There is a minimum of division.\n>\n> On the bourgeois table everything that can be is kept untouched and separate. Every dish has its own cutlery and plate. In general plates are not cleaned by eating — because eating and cleaning are distinct activities. Each eater (or a servant) holds the serving dish to allow another to serve himself. The meal is a series of discrete, untouched gifts.\n>\n> To the peasant all food represents work accomplished. The work may or may not have been his own or that of his family, but if it isn’t, the work represented is nevertheless directly exchangeable with his own work. Because food represents physical work, the eater’s body already ‘knows’ the food it is going to eat. (The peasant’s strong resistance to eating any ‘foreign’ food for the first time is partly because its origin in the work process is unknown.) He does not expect to be surprised by food — except, sometimes, by its quality. His food is familiar like his own body. Its action on his body is *continuous* with the previous action of the body (labour) on the food. He eats in the room in which the food is prepared and cooked.”\n\nAnd here it’s only appropriate to recall the videos that have become so popular lately, of Afghani or Pakistani peasants eating western foods like pizza for the first time.\n\nIn more normal times, I’m working away from home at least a third of the year. The farm was always intended as a respite from this type of continuous movement around the world. I would be in New York, in Los Angeles, in Seoul, and then return to the woods. Two zones, with a clear delineation between them. This delineation now seems pretty absurd.\n\nI think often about the community I joined de facto in January 2020 and in earnest a month later, and what distinguishes it from all my previous time spent in cities.

Today, we're happy to push our vision even further and introduce V3, a new paradigm for creators to not only launch a token but also to build & operate meaningful communities.\n\nWe aim to create the foundational layer for web3 communities and making creation on the internet a multiplayer game. In this article we'll go over what's new in V3 and evolution of Coinvise so far.\n\n## Social Token Dashboard\n\nOn Coinvise, every creator has their own dashboard on the platform, their corner of the internet where they will manage their token and utilize our tools.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QtCfO_ZFCEV3fE5s8Mc3N.png?height=1621&width=2881)\n\nDashboard offers tools focused on token composability, information around what drives the token value over time and a better way to manage it.\n\nV3 includes four main tools:\n\n* **Mint -** Launch a personal or community token to kickstart your journey into web3. We've worked hard to make this process as easy-as-possible and accessible to people that are new to web3. No cuts, just gas.\n* **Airdrop -** An easy way for creators to bulk airdrop tokens to early supporters, stakeholders, and community members with built in sybil resistance & additional support for native currencies & stablecoins. Airdrops can be sent to thousands of people at once via a unique link, QR code, email list or simply a list of addresses. Easy to use, cost-effective & more importantly, secure.\n* **Lockup -** The lockup allows creators to setup vesting schedules for key stakeholders of their community. By allowing creators to lock a certain amount of their tokens for a defined period of time, we ensure the possibility for creators to avoid too much speculation and ensure to contributors the seriousness of the creator. *(Note: Only available to select creators)*\n* **Rewards -** Social Tokens are best used when they scale or incentivize coordination and engagement between community members. That's why we've built \"Reward\", a tool that enable creators to create quests or bounties for rewarding tokens to contributors of community. It helps communities onboard new members, accomplish atomic tasks (with built-in payouts & notifications) & enables contributors to earn ownership into the community.\n\nAt Coinvise, we genuinely believe in creators having ownership over the means of production & distribution of their work. We also think they will build mission-driven communities, and we want to be here to support their work & build a creator-first platform. This means not taking disproportionate cuts from creator revenue, enabling better coordination within communities & creating an open platform for creators.\n\nCoinvise is a complete paradigm shift in the way creators and their community will collaborate.\n\n## Activity Feed\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xJrZRz1JQ7TDk704Wko1I.png?height=1621&width=2881)\n\nOvertime, we've seen creators build unique & valuable communities from all around the globe on Coinvise. To ensure better discovery for these communities, we're adding an activity feed.\n\nIt's a place where you can discover and explore all the exciting things happening with creator communities. If you want to see if your favorite creator has set up a new bounty or if your best friends purchased a new creator token, you'll be able to access all the information you need in a well-designed and beautiful feed.\n\nThe feed lays out the foundation of how we envision Coinvise to become a web3 social network & become the homepage for web3.\n\n## Profiles\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5UjZ4mrOJJHM2QRXhEMdm.png?height=1620&width=2881)\n\nWe won't recreate a Web2 Social Network and simply build it on ethereum. We want to create something from the ground up. We want to develop something magical that is only possible now.\n\nProfiles on Coinvise are your on-chain identity, with quantifiable metrics for value creation. Web3 finally allowed interoperability and allowed us to create \"Profile.\"\n\nIt comes with a built-in portfolio where you can showcase your ownership in tokenized communities and establish verifiable trust around you, thanks to your reputation scores.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ciUePX7Yp4OD1wY-JsBWw.png?height=1621&width=2881)\n\n## Reputation\n\nReputation scores are calculated based on your previous on-chain activities, not just on Coinvise, but from all your favorite protocols (Mirror, Gitcoin, BrightID, Proof-of-Humanity, RabbitHole & more). The score is derived from smart contract activity or on-chain participation in these protocols. It helps quantify value creation & trust on platforms but also help creators identify high-value community members.\n\nIn future, this score can be utilized to \"reputation-gate\" airdrops, bounties & other incentives to ensure higher trust & quality of participation within communities.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GflFIPx22M4k1jnLPM3Lg.png?height=1620&width=2881)\n\n## Everyone is a Creator\n\nSocial tokens created on Coinvise act as a starting point for creators to build a mission-driven creator DAO. We aim to build the most powerful tools for creators that make monetization & creation, multiplayer.\n\nSocial Tokens and communities around it are about to change the way we work and collaborate on the new internet and we're here to make this revolution accessible to anyone. See you all in the metaverse.\n\n\n---\n\n**Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  [Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en)and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/8jaQB5CZ) 🔥**\n\n\n---", "timestamp": 1631814272, "digest": "riLqVarx3tCkMZTIQJypy6J-7nnST17pNNXLKsUjI8U", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

There’s a clear need to shift the systems in power to enable a community-led, rather than corporation-led world. Web3 technologies have opened the doors to a more collaborative, decentralised, and equitable future.
