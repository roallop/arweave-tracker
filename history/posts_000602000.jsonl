This will improve the writing experience for the researcher, and will also *prevent the appropriation of ideas*.\n\nFor example, African-American activist Tarana Burke started the grassroots Me Too movement in 2006, to help sexual assault victims after being assaulted herself. Later, white actor Alyssa Milano popularized \"me too\" with a viral tweet urging harassed and assaulted woman to tag “#metoo” in social media posts. \n\nIn light of the incredible influence of the campaign, it is important that Tarana Burke herself receives credit for the origins of the meme, and that *[expanders](https://g.mirror.xyz/UU5yS0VH_4DJpGqVzOtXCaEm2dYhtVpifO_TBqx5P-M)*, benefiting from scale, are prevented in principle from receiving *all* of the influence and credit.\n\nWhen crypto networks are more popular and AI is more powerful, such prevention would be feasible. AI algorithms, working tirelessly in the background, would *know* the origins of all ideas, being able to understand concepts and trace an immutable record of all published ideas.\n\nAnother example would be color schemes; as Kevin Lo [argued](https://web.archive.org/web/20191110020348/https://www.lokidesign.net/journal/2016/2/22/the-propaganda-of-pantone-colour-and-subcultural-sublimation), the rise of pastel color schemes began with feminist artists, propagated through Tumblr, and eventually reached Pantone. The origins of the trend might be trivially provable for machines in the future — so trivial that they're done automatically at each point of propagation. Another advanced example would include photography styles.

I wrote most of it near midnight the night before, and then our team came together and helped to polish it in the morning. While reviewing the entry, we also took the opportunity to make many design improvements to the Mirror reading experience, which shows the value of using our own product to raise the quality for everybody. This is typically called \"dogfooding\" your product -- \"eating your own dogfood\". I once worked with a Spanish-speaking engineer from Chile who was very confused by this expression, and asked another engineer, in Spanish, why everyone was talking about \"eating the dog's food\"!\n\nMeetings, again, were more meandering today than they ought to have been. I think think we could do better by structuring our internal meeting times more--having really clear outcomes for our meetings, time-boxing them, and knowing when we've \"won\" the meeting.\n\nAnother thing that's on my mind is how to be great at product idea exploration. It's clear that it's part *generative* and part *pruning*, and if we're pruning too early, we stifle potential ideas that sound bad at first, but could flourish into something good. At the same time, some people in the room may have enough experience simply to know a dead-end when they see one. Balancing the rapid generation of ideas while quickly pruning bad ones is an art; a valuable art for any startup to be able to perform.\n\nCan your team generate beautiful, unique, eccentric ideas, without wasting time out in an isolated idea maze?", "timestamp": 1609996609, "digest": "ZeFBhb2yp7B2xAVnFRZd66Kn_o1EVOU1BVoxiFR0lZY", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

Assets that can be represented as NFTs range from digital goods, such as items that exist within virtual worlds, to claims on physical assets such as clothing items or real estate. In the coming years, we will see NFTs used to unlock entirely new use cases that are only made possible by crypto.\n\n![Hey there](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9799dae1-c2c9-4712-813b-10b23c279a36.jpeg)\n\nWhile the Ethereum ecosystem is where most NFT activity has taken place to date, NFTs can exist on other smart contract platforms too. This is because, at their core, NFTs are just digital abstractions used to represent assets that are one of a kind. Non-fungible token isn’t the most intuitive term since we don’t commonly refer to the fungibility of objects in the physical world, but this is an important technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain.
