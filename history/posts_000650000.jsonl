The summit is an opportunity to bring two worlds together, the Creator Economy and Crypto. \n\nNFTs, Social tokens, DAOs, Creator driven business and the uncertainties that come with it all are the topics we’ll dive into with some of the leading thinkers from both sides of the web 2.0 / web 3.0 divide. You won't want to miss it ([so register here](http://summit.seedclub.io)). \n\n### Unlocking Content with Tokens \n\nWe've had a number of requests to sponsor the event and thought we should do something special to that end. \n\nThat’s why we’re excited to announce Summit Sponsorship NFT. We’ve put 3 NFTs up for auction on Zora (each NFT represents sponsorship for one day).\n\nWe’re big fans of the utility that social tokens and NFTs bring to communities. Token Gating access to a discord is one of the clearest ways to align incentives with a small community and give all members upside in the growth in value of that community. \n\n\nWe’re auctioning off one NFT for each day of the Summit. The purchaser of the NFT is essentially “unlocking” the content for everyone that day. No tickets, no paywalls, no gates. The NFT holder will get all the thanks, accolades and admiration from our growing community and the thousands of watchers around the world. \n\n### What Sponsors Get\n\nWinning the NFT auction will entitle each sponsor to the following for the corresponding summit days:\n\n- Be the named sponsor (name + logo) of each day (on our website, the live stream and in discord.) \n- The opportunity host 1 session as a capstone session each day (up to 30 mins which you’d better make good because it’s at the end of the day, not right in the middle.)\n- A bunch of attention and thanks from the various Seed Club social media channels (Twitter, Discord, Email)\n- Recognition as an early Seed Club supporter (and all that entails … which is nothing just yet, but will hopefully be something in the future)\n\n\n### About the NFTs\n\nOne of our earliest supporters, and one of the earliest issuers of a Social Token, and really an early adopter of NFTs (man, this guy is early) is [Connie Digital](https://twitter.com/ConnieDigital). Connie brings his unique DIGITAL vibes to every piece he creates and we asked him to bring those same vibes to the creation of 3 Sponsorship NFTs. \n\nYou can view and bid on the collection here:\n\n\n\n### Auction Details. \n\n- Auction will close on Friday March 26th at 6pm Pacific time. \n- Winners will be chosen by the Seed Club team (we reserve the right not to choose the highest bid)\n- Winners will need to reach out to the Seed Club twitter and provide proof of ownership prior to unlocking full sponsorship benefits.\n\nQuestions or comments.

Token Gating access to a discord is one of the clearest ways to align incentives with a small community and give all members upside in the growth in value of that community. \n\n\n### We’re auctioning off one NFT for each day of the Summit. \n\nThe purchaser of the NFT is essentially “unlocking” the content for everyone that day. No tickets, no paywalls, no gates. The NFT holder will get all the thanks, accolades and admiration from our growing community and the thousands of watchers around the world. \n\n### What Sponsors Get\n\nWinning the NFT auction will entitle each sponsor to the following for the corresponding summit days:\n\n- Be the named sponsor (name + logo) of each day (on our website, the live stream and in discord.) \n- The opportunity host 1 session as a capstone session each day (up to 30 mins which you’d better make good because it’s at the end of the day, not right in the middle.)\n- A bunch of attention and thanks from the various Seed Club social media channels (Twitter, Discord, Email)\n- Recognition as an early Seed Club supporter (and all that entails … which is nothing just yet, but will hopefully be something in the future)\n\n\n### About the NFTs\n\nOne of our earliest supporters, and one of the earliest issuers of a Social Token, and really an early adopter of NFTs (man, this guy is early) is [Connie Digital](https://twitter.com/ConnieDigital). Connie brings his unique DIGITAL vibes to every piece he creates and we asked him to bring those same vibes to the creation of 3 Sponsorship NFTs. \n\nYou can view and bid on the collection here, or scroll to the end of this page.\n\n### Auction Details. \n\n- Auction will close on Friday March 26th at 6pm Pacific time. \n- Winners will be chosen by the Seed Club team (we reserve the right not to choose the highest bid)\n- Winners will need to reach out to the Seed Club twitter and provide proof of ownership prior to unlocking full sponsorship benefits.\n\nQuestions or comments.

The summit is an opportunity to bring two worlds together, the Creator Economy and Crypto. \n\nLearn more about the [Creator x Crypto Summit](http://www.summit.seedclub.io) here. \n\nNFTs, Social tokens, DAOs, Creator driven business and the uncertainties that come with it all are the topics we’ll dive into with some of the leading thinkers from both sides of the web 2.0 / web 3.0 divide. You won't want to miss it ([so register here](http://summit.seedclub.io)). \n\n### Hold NFT = Sponsor the Summit  \n\nThat’s why we’re excited to announce Summit Sponsorship NFT.
