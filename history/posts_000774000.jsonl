They’re NFT series of 10,000 unique and randomly generated images of characters. They’re also 2 of the most well-known examples of ‘NFT avatars’ - a trend which has exploded in the crypto space of 2021 and is set to permeate subcultures once they move into the web3.\n\nHere’s how, and why.\n\n![Larva Labs' CryptoPunks (2017)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sB36szj_PH6WfZtESr5dX.png?height=914&width=2186&&size=medium)\n\n## PFPs & NFT Avatars\n\nNFT avatar projects are casually referred to as PFPs: *P*ro*F*ile *P*ictures, since that’s a common use case for them. They most often have up to 10,000 template characters that are ‘minted’ by people wanting to own one. Minting costs money (cryptocurrency) and in the process of minting randomized traits are applied, ranging from extremely rare to common. These may be variables like skin colour, headwear, haircuts, shirts, background colours and anything else you may think of that’s appropriate to the project. Many projects will have 10 traits with 10 variables per trait. \n\nOnce minted, the character is created and will remain unchanged, so before you mint, you usually only know what the style of the project is, but not what your NFT character will end up looking like. Once all NFTs from a series have been minted, the value of some of the PFPs may increase, since people may try to purchase ones that specifically appeal to them (like **[Jay-Z](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/109655/jay-z-puts-a-cryptopunk-nft-as-his-twitter-profile-picture)**[’s CryptoPunk](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/109655/jay-z-puts-a-cryptopunk-nft-as-his-twitter-profile-picture)).\n\n![Yuga Labs' Bored Ape Yacht Club (2021)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5IMgaRsVt_wZkpyYw581o.png?height=900&width=2176&size=medium)\n\n## Being early\n\nThe  creative web3 space is still relatively small. Many of the more successful projects specifically cater to the crypto community and its aesthetics. As interest has peaked, so have the number of PFP projects that now flood the space.  Many struggle to get all their NFTs minted, often resulting in minted NFTs being sold for a price lower than the minting cost, which further slows down the minting process.\n\nYet we’re early. Many types of aesthetics that are popular in subcultures, for example as album artwork, in music videos, or as tattoos, don’t necessarily resonate well with those already onboarded to the web3. While some of the aesthetics emerging from the web3 space will go on to become cornerstones of emerging subcultures, a more diverse variety of aesthetics will become popular in the web3 as more people get onboarded.\n\nA PFP project making slow progress on minting seems bad, but if it finds ways to onboard the subculture in which its aesthetics are rooted, it can succeed over time and enjoy a potentially more meaningful success than it could by shilling to speculating crypto bros (f/m/non-binary).\n\n## Onboarding subcultures\n\nThe social dynamics of what’s happening right now are not unique. The clearest memory I have of subcultures shifting to a new type of internet is from around 2009 when artists started switching out the **MySpace Music** players on their profiles for **SoundCloud** embeds. SoundCloud’s player was clearly superior. While MySpace limited you to a maximum number of tracks per profile, SoundCloud allowed you to upload 4 tracks of any length per month for free in those days. The benefits were obvious and thus once a few musicians in a genre embedded the SoundCloud player on their MySpace profile, you’d see it spread like wildfire through their subgenre.\n\nThe type of people who were the first to switch out their player, the innovators, are now onboarding to the web3. Many of them are already experimenting with NFTs and DAOs. PFPs allow them to signal the web3 to others in their cultural space, just like how the SoundCloud player signalled a shift from the age of downloads to the age of streaming. PFPs are not enough though, since their utility is not as obvious compared to an embeddable player that was easily twice as good as what preceded it.\n\nFor subcultures to onboard to the web3, there are two main hurdles to overcome:\n\n* Proof of stake (PoS). The energy use associated with Proof of Work blockchains like **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum** has made many people unwilling to touch any type of crypto. So, I expect a few factors in the next year will drive more people to the web3: 1) Ethereum switching to PoS; 2) maturing ecosystems around PoS blockchains such as **Tezos** and **Solana**; 3) more accessible [layer 2 rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/) for more diverse use cases.\n* Usability. It currently takes about 30-60 minutes to onboard someone to the web3 and buy their first NFT, like an **ENS** domain (see my primer below). They have to open a wallet, verify their identity on an exchange, buy crypto, wait for transactions to clear, etc. It’s hard to figure things out. It’s easy to make expensive mistakes. Many people who are already onboarded forget how hard it is: try onboarding a friend who’s completely new to it. Sit next to them. Walk them through all the steps.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0OByzktIaA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0OByzktIaA)\n\n## Subcultures and PFPs\n\nA year from now, things will likely be a lot easier for newcomers. Besides work being done on the previous two bullet points, tech giants like **PayPal**, **Square** / **Cash App**, and likely **Facebook** / **Instagram** entering the space will help decrease the number of hurdles (at the cost of decentralization).\n\nIt will increase the viability of sounds and images that are specific only to certain subcultures and decrease the necessity to make plays that cater to the wider web3 community. So if you’ve been hesitating to start a PFP project or a DAO, because you don’t think the people are onboard for it yet: start small and do it anyway. Consider a lower number than 10,000, and don’t rush, don’t shill too hard. Your audience will get here eventually and you’ll be the CryptoPunk equivalent of your domain. The OG PFP NFTs of your subculture.\n\nI don’t know about you, but I’m so ready for crypto goth, crypto gabber, and actual crypto punk. See you soon.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6eFmAamBA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6eFmAamBA)\n\n", "timestamp": 1632213101, "digest": "r7kU3Ssy-MldqOOyEJN6f0vqYrB7OJDV6LJCy41EA8k", "contributor": "0xe612d9C2a9bA0Ff4403F4f7Ea87D5bE4290aC7B9"}

This will be one more.\n\nYesterday I left the USV office at the end of the day and hopped onto a Citibike E-Bike at the brand new kiosk that has been installed in the “no cars” section of Broadway between 23rd and 21st.\n\n![](https://avc.com/content/uploads/2021/09/PXL\\_20210913\\_124450154-1536x2048.jpg)\n\nI rode that E-bike all the way to Central Park West and 81st Street to get to the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. I was able to stay in a bike lane for that entire ride and it took me about twenty minutes.\n\nThere is no way I could have gotten from 21st and Broadway to the Delacorte Theater in less than twenty minutes any other way. Google Maps told me it would take 28 mins on the subway and I’d have to make at least one transfer. I did not check Uber, but given how Uber is working in NYC these days, it would have been at least a ten-minute wait just for the car to arrive. It would have likely taken twice as long in a car as a Citibike.\n\nWhen the weather is good, like it has been in NYC the last few weeks, there is no better way to get around the city than Citibike. The subway is a close second, but there is something about being out and about, a breeze in your face, seeing the sights and sounds of NYC.\n\nThe addition of E-bikes has made longer rides, like the one I did yesterday evening, a good option. I generally take the regular bikes to commute to and from work (a roughly ten-minute ride), but the E-bike makes the 60 block trip, or a trip to Brooklyn or back, a decent option.\n\nI do have a suggestion for Lyft, the owner of NYC’s Citibike service.\n\nThere should be financial rewards for taking a bike from a kiosk that is completely full or nearly full and returning to a kiosk that is empty or nearly empty. There should also be a financial reward for docking an E-Bike in a kiosk where there are no E-Bikes or very few.\n\nThe single biggest challenge with Citibike is the empty kiosk and the full kiosk. And the lack of E-Bikes in many kiosks is also a challenge.\n\nIf riders were rewarded financially for taking bikes and moving them to where they are most needed, the distribution of bikes would become more even. And there would be a “cottage industry” of people who ride Citibikes around the city for a living making sure that the bike distribution is optimal.\n\nThis would require the Citibike app to be like Venmo, with a wallet that builds up or down over time, and where balances can be transferred out.\n\nThat’s not very hard to build in this day and age, and would be a game-changer for the Citibike system.\n", "timestamp": 1632220646, "digest": "GeAbuS5nk5b6_bR2nzXY8ZM59U-xVnIZ68XT_NEYOhU", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

Sometimes the coil is more compressed.\n\n[https://twitter.com/0ddette/status/1376008296415559680](https://twitter.com/0ddette/status/1376008296415559680)\n\nMy undergrad photography program, like most liberal art programs, was built on a structure emphasizing fundamentals as a first step along a path of cumulative experimentation–in intellectual development, in visual style, and in tools used. The cornerstone was analog: shooting black and white 35mm film, developing the negatives yourself, and making prints in the darkroom. Later years had time devoted to large format view cameras, lighting, studio setups–all the stuff that’s been around for 50-100 years–and, of course, digital capture, editing, and printing.\n\nIn my last two years at school a department-wide debate emerged: whether to still require incoming freshmen to learn the wet darkroom or let them go directly digital. For a lot of younger students it made no sense to grok a skill and set of equipment they didn’t want to use. For a lot of older students it made no sense to experiment at the cutting edge without appreciation for the art’s history. Faculty, who practiced in a wide range of media, seemed caught in the middle.\n\nWorking in color captured these questions well. It isn’t practical (or really even possible) for someone to develop color film themselves, so shooting color means taking it to an outside lab as a first step; already once removed from the artist’s hands. Chromogenic prints cannot be made in the same type of wet darkroom as gelatin silver prints since no visible spectrum of light is safe to use with the paper, so they’re exposed in total darkness (in small individual darkrooms), and developed by a machine the size of a truck that’s accessed through a closet (at Tisch ours was a Colenta and probably cost $350,000 when new, in the 1990s). No hands in trays of chemicals, no fighting over control of the stereo. The complexity and relative absurdity of the process–working in complete darkness at each step, going in and out of different tiny rooms–in fact makes it far more esoteric than black and white printing, which can be done by almost anyone in almost any dark space with a few buckets and a red light bulb. But at one time, it was cutting edge. While I was in school, it was still the dominant method of printing color, and what you saw most often on gallery walls in Chelsea.\n\nMy thesis exhibition (in 2009) was entirely chromogenic prints, and if I remember correctly about a third of my classmates did the same. Within two years, the program’s head technician emailed me saying I could have the Colenta if I would get it out of the building.\n\n[https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1369237479317004289](https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1369237479317004289)\n\nEthereum opened a new space and provides an opportunity for artists to work with a previously unknown medium. This is exciting to the point of mania-inducing, which is what makes it feel simultaneously hopeful and dangerous. It’s also what creates a financial bubble, which for the obvious reasons is dramatically exacerbated in the case of NFTs. Worst of all, it’s what often pushes aside the most interesting work being done, work which is trying to understand what the technology unlocks–what it enables in itself–separate from how it can merely transport an existing object (say, a JPEG) into a different realm (say, a hyperfinancial one). I’m talking about the work that literally cannot exist without the specific tool.\n\nAn excellent example of this is Robin Sloan’s [Amulets](https://text.bargains/) project.\n\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/815](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/815)\n\nAn amulet results from the appearance of sequential 8’s in the sha256 hash of a short piece of text; it cannot exist separate from the sha256 hash function (which is integral, but not unique, to Ethereum). The quantity of 8’s determines the amulet’s rarity (as established by the artist). The full definition and set of rules are very worth reading. It’s a nice game. It’s hard to imagine anyone paying a lot of money for these.\n\n[Framergence](https://framergence.art/) is particularly interesting because the creative mechanism is tied explicitly to Ethereum, in that the set of NFTs that exists can be modified in real time on-chain by the users. Each is algorithmically generated based on fractal patterns; the contract also rewards token burning by re-minting an n-1 amount of new tokens. This has led to people purchasing examples they intend to burn in the hunt for more pleasing iterations.\n\n![](https://content.framergence.art/3023962126_hires.png)\n\nEzra Miller’s [Solvency](https://solvency.art), a personal favorite, is not only technically accomplished, with the assets stored entirely on Ethereum and Arweave, but the individual mints are also beautiful, aesthetically complex and varied between mints, yet still cohesive as a body of work. Their infinite runtime is the kicker.\n\n[https://5kuzmctr2tmkwxq7vkz6ejfqrjvz7sih34rfmu6wyhnywbvkmivq.arweave.net/6qmWCnHU2KteH6qz4iSwimufyQffIlZT1sHbiwaqYis/?seed=0x1940347e592e022caa1f5b729b5902bf39de340a44dec77a99d1d2ff4070ea53?display=iframe](https://5kuzmctr2tmkwxq7vkz6ejfqrjvz7sih34rfmu6wyhnywbvkmivq.arweave.net/6qmWCnHU2KteH6qz4iSwimufyQffIlZT1sHbiwaqYis/?seed=0x1940347e592e022caa1f5b729b5902bf39de340a44dec77a99d1d2ff4070ea53?display=iframe)\n\nThese examples demonstrate the positive feedback loop that emerges from strong artist-tool relationships and leads to canonical outcomes. In the best cases it is indistinguishable from collaboration. I would go further and say that the strongest relationships depend on high friction environments. In these cases, the tools are new. They’re difficult to understand and often expensive to use. There’s a lot of trial and error. Much of the work has to be done “by hand,” and it’s slow going. The audience doesn’t have good references to understand the output; there’s probably very little criticism to place it in a historical context. The conditions are conducive to failure rather than success. And this leads to a lot of “failures.” Outside the small ecosystem of devoted creators and users, the work that employs the most experimental elements of a new technological space tends to be misunderstood, undervalued, and in many cases lost entirely.\n\nThe same dynamic (with the opposite effect on market price) can apply to esoteric and “outdated” tools and processes. It was no surprise that [the best paper maker in Japan](https://www.washiya.com/shop/iwanohousho/kodawarienglish.html) had custom-designed all of his equipment, worked without the use of any bleach or other additives, and had not changed the process first established by his family 8 generations prior. Of course, his output is 1/100th of what a modernized paper maker can achieve, let alone a factory.\n\nWhat constitutes high friction (and low friction) is an ever-moving target and always relative. In 2007 digital photography was high friction (to achieve comparable results to analog, or to embrace the unique aesthetics of pixels), and analog low friction. That has since inverted. Today, shooting 4K video on your phone feels easy; it will eventually feel cumbersome when most people have contact lens wearables, or something equally absurd-sounding.\n\n[https://twitter.com/etheria_feed/status/1370825688647884802](https://twitter.com/etheria_feed/status/1370825688647884802)\n\n[https://twitter.com/samspike/status/1439030208640823305?s=20](https://twitter.com/samspike/status/1439030208640823305?s=20)\n\nI originally began this essay in March. Etheria has since been resuscitated; NFT archeology in the search of yield is an active pursuit. Generative art is now rampant with derivatives. Copies of copies of copies. As with everything, the financial mechanisms of crypto allow–if not require–this speedrunning. Thus, we are already in a transient period of low friction and increasing mania. We’re surrounded by work that deploys the technology as an inherent component, but is otherwise artistically unremarkable. Its newness nonetheless commands enormous value. This, too, can cause artists’ work to be overlooked. Launch a series on Art Blocks and you tap into an automatic market of collectors and liquidity. Launch the same series on your own site and you may be lucky to sell a handful (probably not in this market, but you know what I mean). This problem isn’t unique to NFTs; the same dynamic is built into the structures of the legacy art world. Indeed the same dynamic emerges any time a certain technology (and its associated market) becomes frictionless enough.\n\nIt’s a failure both when a technology is used as a non-tool acceleration vehicle, and when it’s worshipped as a self-solving perpetual motion machine. During a bubble the technology exhibits both properties. Everybody rushes in because it’s a money printer, and many of those involved begin to see it as a Rosetta stone device. Irrational exuberance. Soon after the bubble pops because it’s discovered that the tools are insufficient for the narrative they sell.\n\nA similar mistake can be made with tools and their characteristics of nostalgia. This was at the heart of the debate at Tisch. Many saw digital photography as a fad, a shortcut, and aesthetically insufficient (“It’s a lower resolution than film, what’s the point?”). Thus black and white wet darkroom printing *had* to be learned; when the current iteration of digital technology was no longer in use, the artist would still have the through-line to grasp. A safety net, and therefore superior.\n\nThis is the common misconception of any new technology: riskier, less reliable, less future-proof. Because it’s iterating so quickly, it’s impermanent whenever and wherever it’s measured. It appears fleeting because most of it is fleeting. But that’s measuring the products of a tool; it’s not taking stock of the tool itself, on its inherent conceptual terms. Certain foundational components attain extreme Lindy status, while many cutting-edge experiments are ultimately relegated to history after leapfrogging each other during the rapid expansion phase. Here’s where we start arguing about Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nOf course, even gelatin silver prints, the most Lindy form of photography in history, are becoming harder to make and more homogenized–the number of companies still producing the necessary materials (film, paper, chemicals) and equipment (enlargers, cameras) has shrunk dramatically, a process that began well before digital photography became superior (the market re-prices according to future developments, not current realities). For the few photographers still working in black and white wet darkrooms, they’ve had to further hone their craft. But most have moved on to digital.\n\nDeafBeef [understands this well](https://jpg.mirror.xyz/qSUps1Krz02iyW8FCWHiEcHGaLrslw6BSldJQpuD9_A):\n\n> Your old smartphone is junk. On the other hand, an analog signal processor can be repaired, repurposed, and scavenged for parts. Oscilloscopes remain useful tools for electrical engineers. Vinyl and magnetic tape recordings from the 60s can still be played. ASCII terminal screens, for those who know how to use them, remain the most efficient way to interact with a computer for many tasks.\n\nEventually, the old smartphone will also be a field to harvest. And It turns out that inkjet prints are actually more stable and conservation-friendly than chromogenic prints; they also don’t require the use of harsh chemicals. Thus the point is not necessarily to be faithful to a specific tool, but to a certain intellectual approach, which is reliant on an appreciation for and handiness with a certain set of tools, and an ability to recognize which tools hold the most potency for honing and distilling.\n\n![David Rudnick's EXODUS 2, VII – Jagged Quartz Towers](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kQVIyPwG9JQfTpg54kLmQ.png?height=996&width=1016)\n\nI’m reminded now of [David Rudnick](https://exodus-ii.folia.app/)’s rhetorical device of [primacy](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/primacism-david-rudnick-on-the-struggle-for-primacy-type-and-poetrys-unique-value-in-an-age-of-digital-and-physical-conflict-and-percy-shelleys-mont-blanc)–Physical Prime vs. Digital Prime. We’re rapidly approaching the event horizon of digital primacy, the point at which we will spend more of our time in digital spaces rather than physical ones. The exponential deployment of digital objects as totemic and memetic devices is testament to this. These totems help us form narratives, and their appearance (in absolute numbers, in iterative qualities, in variability of aesthetics) has a direct relationship to our distance from the threshold.\n\nA major risk is in not recognizing the threshold; the result is a digital-prime world built with tools we can’t understand, illustrating myths that only abstract our social relationship to them. It inflates a bubble. Life feels easy. But we’re really in limbo.\n\n[Dean Kissick](https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/08/rediscovering-desire-in-a-panopticon-of-virtual-pleasures/) writes of a similar problem between cultural output and friction:\n\n> Much of culture now has the hollow, vacant feeling of having been made by algorithm. Consider the drab, broken anti-spectacle of Addison Rae performing trending TikTok dances onstage with Jimmy Kimmel or NFTs sold for millions at Christie’s and Sotheby’s—it’s art and pop stripped of all verve, fertility, and eroticism. What’s left is the new aesthetic of lifelessness and void, a consumer culture of throwaway experiences that wash right over you like an Ambien. It’s made to be experienced without friction: seamless post-death entertainment from an empire ruled over by a sleepy, old man. “Avoiding friction,” the critic Rob Horning has noted, “becomes a kind of content in itself—‘readable books’; ‘listenable music’; ‘vibes’; ‘ambience,’ etc.” And this is in keeping with a generational preference for light demi-pleasures: bumps not lines; microdosing, not getting high; sugary milks made of oats; podcasts, not conversation; the simulated intimacy of ASMR. Each of life’s pleasures in small amounts.\n\nRecognizing the threshold is particularly important for artists. They *must* grok the requisite tools and use them to shape the narrative surrounding the technological shift. They must sustain a high friction environment both as creators and for their audience. They must shock.\n\nHigh tool fluency, up and down the spiral (closer to and further from the threshold), is necessary. One must know one’s history, and then push forward. Otherwise the response to an algorithmic existence itself is honed by algorithm, so as not to be too disruptive; to sell.\n\nPart of what makes this urgent is the constant stream of legacy systems busting rivets left and right.\n\n![Maxar Technologies / Associated Press](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U5ZAAeuSz80_c1zJhXEPy.jpg?height=667&width=1200)\n\nThe ship as totem: a menacing combination of high meme content, an esoteric community, and structural fragility.\n\nThe physical prime world is literally breaking as it optimizes for digital prime users. Its systems are consolidating in the name of efficiency and introducing centralized weaknesses that halt entire networks. Its tools are opaque, if not entirely unknown, to its supposed beneficiaries.\n\nIt’s easy to see this as a sign that all things analog are destined for obsolescence. There are many in the NFT realm who seem to think–or at least proclaim loudly, to sustain a trade–there’s no going back; a switch has flipped, we’ve discovered a new set of tools that are better in every way, and a panacea is upon us. That there’s a direct relationship between one’s financial exposure to said tools and one’s insistence on their panacean qualities is no surprise. It should be obvious that this binary relationship between past and future is wrong, but to extrapolate a bit: culture doesn’t lurch forward in a series of discrete steps. Generative art is not new. We might think of Sol Lewitt’s [Wall Drawings](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/) as generative artworks (Mitchell F Chan [certainly does](https://artblocks.io/project/118)), or [Marina Abramovic](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/abramovic-rhythm-0-t14875), or [Bruce Nauman](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/bruce-nauman-body-pressure), or [Lawrence Weiner](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/137437)… The Louvre predates photography and will still exist long after NFTs are outdated. A museum is a tool–a piece of infrastructure so implicit to society that it will both adapt to and force the adaptation of new aesthetics, new concepts, new media. If NFTs are successful as an artistic medium it will be because they expand culture, not fork it.\n\nIt seems to me that the turbulence of our time is a result of not allowing ourselves to cleave our digital selves from the physical and thus nurture both. We insist on bringing the algorithmic efficiency of digital primacy to bear on everything we do, eat, say, build.\n\nA dramatic inversion is necessary, and this brings me to [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/).\n\n![Bag #2957](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OmhyiqFNr7onQZr4j0xXz.png?height=2270&width=2270)\n\nLoot has been discussed mostly as a game primitive, but I think this is too simple. Loot is a generative artwork: a set of variables spawning artistic outputs off chain. Each bag is a recursive digital-prime totem, a memetic device that leads to expansive world building within digital primacy. A set of instructions.\n\nIts recursion is a direct result of its pliability through time. It’s non-static; it reflects and refracts the underlying technology. Each bag is a tool.\n\nThe rapid and frothy growth of Loot derivatives (and knock-offs) is confirmation of this. It shows the power of the idea: ”this is so stupid that I must spend my time mocking it;” “this allows us to build our own universes, how exciting;” “this will make me a lot of money.” It immediately (well, it took three days) became a bubble market. Most of these derivatives will go bust. The naysayers will celebrate. The devoted will continue building, sometimes in the wrong directions.\n\nBut as with the bubble of generative blockchain art, and the bubble of NFTs, and the (current) bubble of crypto, there remains a potent signal to which we should pay attention.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/161](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/161)\n\n", "timestamp": 1632225396, "digest": "mEoh4x8-1kDTsca-IhRIR9vygFI_vnNy0NHWTzYGF6U", "contributor": "0xa8A33539960Ef4779CB0eCEDed8002c1EcD40582"}

It isn’t practical (or really even possible) for someone to develop color film themselves, so shooting color means taking it to an outside lab as a first step; already once removed from the artist’s hands. Chromogenic prints cannot be made in the same type of wet darkroom as gelatin silver prints since no visible spectrum of light is safe to use with the paper, so they’re exposed in total darkness (in small individual darkrooms), and developed by a machine the size of a truck that’s accessed through a closet (at Tisch ours was a Colenta and probably cost $350,000 when new, in the 1990s). No hands in trays of chemicals, no fighting over control of the stereo. The complexity and relative absurdity of the process–working in complete darkness at each step, going in and out of different tiny rooms–in fact makes it far more esoteric than black and white printing, which can be done by almost anyone in almost any dark space with a few buckets and a red light bulb. But at one time, it was the vanguard. While I was in school, it was still the dominant method of printing color, and what you saw most often on gallery walls in Chelsea.\n\nMy thesis exhibition (in 2009) was entirely chromogenic prints, and if I remember correctly about a third of my classmates did the same. Within two years, the program’s head technician emailed me saying I could have the Colenta if I would get it out of the building.\n\n[https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1369237479317004289](https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1369237479317004289)\n\nEthereum opened a new space and provides an opportunity for artists to work with a previously unknown medium. This is exciting to the point of mania-inducing, which is what makes it feel simultaneously hopeful and dangerous. It’s also what creates a financial bubble, which for the obvious reasons is dramatically exacerbated in the case of NFTs. Worst of all, it’s what often pushes aside the most interesting work being done, work which is trying to understand what the technology unlocks–what it enables in itself–separate from how it can merely transport an existing object (say, a JPEG) into a different realm (say, a hyperfinancial one). I’m talking about the work that literally cannot exist without the specific tool.\n\nAn excellent example of this is Robin Sloan’s [Amulets](https://text.bargains/) project.\n\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/815](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/815)\n\nAn amulet results from the appearance of sequential 8’s in the sha256 hash of a short piece of text; it cannot exist separate from the sha256 hash function (which is integral, but not unique, to Ethereum). The quantity of 8’s determines the amulet’s rarity (as established by the artist). The full definition and set of rules are very worth reading. It’s a nice game. It’s hard to imagine anyone paying a lot of money for these.\n\n[Framergence](https://framergence.art/) is particularly interesting because the creative mechanism is tied explicitly to Ethereum, in that the set of NFTs that exists can be modified in real time on-chain by the users. Each is algorithmically generated based on fractal patterns; the contract also rewards token burning by re-minting an n-1 amount of new tokens. This has led to people purchasing examples they intend to burn in the hunt for more pleasing iterations.\n\n![](https://content.framergence.art/3023962126_hires.png)\n\nEzra Miller’s [Solvency](https://solvency.art), a personal favorite, is not only technically accomplished, with the assets stored entirely on Ethereum and Arweave, but the individual mints are also beautiful, aesthetically complex and varied between mints, yet still cohesive as a body of work. Their infinite runtime is the kicker.\n\n[https://5kuzmctr2tmkwxq7vkz6ejfqrjvz7sih34rfmu6wyhnywbvkmivq.arweave.net/6qmWCnHU2KteH6qz4iSwimufyQffIlZT1sHbiwaqYis/?seed=0x1940347e592e022caa1f5b729b5902bf39de340a44dec77a99d1d2ff4070ea53?display=iframe](https://5kuzmctr2tmkwxq7vkz6ejfqrjvz7sih34rfmu6wyhnywbvkmivq.arweave.net/6qmWCnHU2KteH6qz4iSwimufyQffIlZT1sHbiwaqYis/?seed=0x1940347e592e022caa1f5b729b5902bf39de340a44dec77a99d1d2ff4070ea53?display=iframe)\n\nThese examples demonstrate the positive feedback loop that emerges from strong artist-tool relationships and leads to canonical outcomes. In the best cases it is indistinguishable from collaboration. I would go further and say that the strongest relationships depend on high friction environments. In these cases, the tools are new. They’re difficult to understand and often expensive to use. There’s a lot of trial and error. Much of the work has to be done “by hand,” and it’s slow going. The audience doesn’t have good references to understand the output; there’s probably very little criticism to place it in a historical context. The conditions are conducive to failure rather than success. And this leads to a lot of “failures.” Outside the small ecosystem of devoted creators and users, the work that employs the most experimental elements of a new technological space tends to be misunderstood, undervalued, and in many cases lost entirely.\n\nThe same dynamic (with the opposite effect on market price) can apply to esoteric and “outdated” tools and processes. It was no surprise that [the best paper maker in Japan](https://www.washiya.com/shop/iwanohousho/kodawarienglish.html) had custom-designed all of his equipment, worked without the use of any bleach or other additives, and had not changed the process first established by his family 8 generations prior. Of course, his output is 1/100th of what a modernized paper maker can achieve, let alone a factory.\n\nWhat constitutes high friction (and low friction) is an ever-moving target and always relative. In 2007 digital photography was high friction (to achieve comparable results to analog, or to embrace the unique aesthetics of pixels), and analog low friction. That has since inverted. Today, shooting 4K video on your phone feels easy; it will eventually feel cumbersome when most people have contact lens wearables, or something equally absurd-sounding.\n\n[https://twitter.com/etheria_feed/status/1370825688647884802](https://twitter.com/etheria_feed/status/1370825688647884802)\n\n[https://twitter.com/samspike/status/1439030208640823305?s=20](https://twitter.com/samspike/status/1439030208640823305?s=20)\n\nI originally began this essay in March. Etheria has since been resuscitated; NFT archeology in the search of yield is an active pursuit. Generative art is now rampant with derivatives. Copies of copies of copies. As with everything, the financial mechanisms of crypto allow–if not require–this speedrunning. Thus, we are already in a transient period of low friction and increasing mania. We’re surrounded by work that deploys the technology as an inherent component, but is otherwise artistically unremarkable. Its newness nonetheless commands enormous value. This, too, can cause artists’ work to be overlooked. Launch a series on Art Blocks and you tap into an automatic market of collectors and liquidity. Launch the same series on your own site and you may be lucky to sell a handful (probably not in this market, but you know what I mean). This problem isn’t unique to NFTs; the same dynamic is built into the structures of the legacy art world. Indeed the same dynamic emerges any time a certain technology (and its associated market) becomes frictionless enough.\n\nIt’s a failure both when a technology is used as a non-tool acceleration vehicle, and when it’s worshipped as a self-solving perpetual motion machine. During a bubble the technology exhibits both properties. Everybody rushes in because it’s a money printer, and many of those involved begin to see it as a Rosetta stone device. Irrational exuberance. Soon after the bubble pops because it’s discovered that the tools are insufficient for the narrative they sell.\n\nA similar mistake can be made with tools and their characteristics of nostalgia. This was at the heart of the debate at Tisch. Many saw digital photography as a fad, a shortcut, and aesthetically insufficient (“It’s a lower resolution than film, what’s the point?”). Thus black and white wet darkroom printing *had* to be learned; when the current iteration of digital technology was no longer in use, the artist would still have the through-line to grasp. A safety net, and therefore superior.\n\nThis is the common misconception of any new technology: riskier, less reliable, less future-proof. Because it’s iterating so quickly, it’s impermanent whenever and wherever it’s measured. It appears fleeting because most of it is fleeting. But that’s measuring the products of a tool; it’s not taking stock of the tool itself, on its inherent conceptual terms. Certain foundational components attain extreme Lindy status, while many cutting-edge experiments are ultimately relegated to history after leapfrogging each other during the rapid expansion phase. Here’s where we start arguing about Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nOf course, even gelatin silver prints, the most Lindy form of photography in history, are becoming harder to make and more homogenized–the number of companies still producing the necessary materials (film, paper, chemicals) and equipment (enlargers, cameras) has shrunk dramatically, a process that began well before digital photography became superior (the market re-prices according to future developments, not current realities). For the few photographers still working in black and white wet darkrooms, they’ve had to further hone their craft. But most have moved on to digital.\n\nDeafBeef [understands this well](https://jpg.mirror.xyz/qSUps1Krz02iyW8FCWHiEcHGaLrslw6BSldJQpuD9_A):\n\n> Your old smartphone is junk. On the other hand, an analog signal processor can be repaired, repurposed, and scavenged for parts. Oscilloscopes remain useful tools for electrical engineers. Vinyl and magnetic tape recordings from the 60s can still be played. ASCII terminal screens, for those who know how to use them, remain the most efficient way to interact with a computer for many tasks.\n\nEventually, the old smartphone will also be a field to harvest. And It turns out that inkjet prints are actually more stable and conservation-friendly than chromogenic prints; they also don’t require the use of harsh chemicals. Thus the point is not necessarily to be faithful to a specific tool, but to a certain intellectual approach, which is reliant on an appreciation for and handiness with a certain set of tools, and an ability to recognize which tools hold the most potency for honing and distilling.\n\n![David Rudnick's EXODUS 2, VII – Jagged Quartz Towers](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kQVIyPwG9JQfTpg54kLmQ.png?height=996&width=1016)\n\nI’m reminded now of [David Rudnick](https://exodus-ii.folia.app/)’s rhetorical device of [primacy](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/primacism-david-rudnick-on-the-struggle-for-primacy-type-and-poetrys-unique-value-in-an-age-of-digital-and-physical-conflict-and-percy-shelleys-mont-blanc)–Physical Prime vs. Digital Prime. We’re rapidly approaching the event horizon of digital primacy, the point at which we will spend more of our time in digital spaces rather than physical ones. The exponential deployment of digital objects as totemic and memetic devices is testament to this. These totems help us form narratives, and their appearance (in absolute numbers, in iterative qualities, in variability of aesthetics) has a direct relationship to our distance from the threshold.\n\nA major risk is in not recognizing the threshold; the result is a digital-prime world built with tools we can’t understand, illustrating myths that only abstract our social relationship to them. It inflates a bubble. Life feels easy. But we’re really in limbo.\n\n[Dean Kissick](https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/08/rediscovering-desire-in-a-panopticon-of-virtual-pleasures/) writes of a similar problem between cultural output and friction:\n\n> Much of culture now has the hollow, vacant feeling of having been made by algorithm. Consider the drab, broken anti-spectacle of Addison Rae performing trending TikTok dances onstage with Jimmy Kimmel or NFTs sold for millions at Christie’s and Sotheby’s—it’s art and pop stripped of all verve, fertility, and eroticism. What’s left is the new aesthetic of lifelessness and void, a consumer culture of throwaway experiences that wash right over you like an Ambien. It’s made to be experienced without friction: seamless post-death entertainment from an empire ruled over by a sleepy, old man. “Avoiding friction,” the critic Rob Horning has noted, “becomes a kind of content in itself—‘readable books’; ‘listenable music’; ‘vibes’; ‘ambience,’ etc.” And this is in keeping with a generational preference for light demi-pleasures: bumps not lines; microdosing, not getting high; sugary milks made of oats; podcasts, not conversation; the simulated intimacy of ASMR. Each of life’s pleasures in small amounts.\n\nRecognizing the threshold is particularly important for artists. They *must* grok the requisite tools and use them to shape the narrative surrounding the technological shift. They must sustain a high friction environment both as creators and for their audience. They must shock.\n\nHigh tool fluency, up and down the spiral (closer to and further from the threshold), is necessary. One must know one’s history, and then push forward. Otherwise the response to an algorithmic existence itself is honed by algorithm, so as not to be too disruptive; to sell.\n\nPart of what makes this urgent is the constant stream of legacy systems busting rivets left and right.\n\n![Maxar Technologies / Associated Press](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U5ZAAeuSz80_c1zJhXEPy.jpg?height=667&width=1200)\n\nThe ship as totem: a menacing combination of high meme content, an esoteric community, and structural fragility.\n\nThe physical prime world is literally breaking as it optimizes for digital prime users. Its systems are consolidating in the name of efficiency and introducing centralized weaknesses that halt entire networks. Its tools are opaque, if not entirely unknown, to its supposed beneficiaries.\n\nIt’s easy to see this as a sign that all things analog are destined for obsolescence. There are many in the NFT realm who seem to think–or at least proclaim loudly, to sustain a trade–there’s no going back; a switch has flipped, we’ve discovered a new set of tools that are better in every way, and a panacea is upon us. That there’s a direct relationship between one’s financial exposure to said tools and one’s insistence on their panacean qualities is no surprise. It should be obvious that this binary relationship between past and future is wrong, but to extrapolate a bit: culture doesn’t lurch forward in a series of discrete steps. Generative art is not new. We might think of Sol Lewitt’s [Wall Drawings](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/) as generative artworks (Mitchell F Chan [certainly does](https://artblocks.io/project/118)), or [Marina Abramovic](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/abramovic-rhythm-0-t14875), or [Bruce Nauman](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/bruce-nauman-body-pressure), or [Lawrence Weiner](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/137437)… The Louvre predates photography and will still exist long after NFTs are outdated. A museum is a tool–a piece of infrastructure so implicit to society that it will both adapt to and force the adaptation of new aesthetics, new concepts, new media. If NFTs are successful as an artistic medium it will be because they expand culture, not fork it.\n\nIt seems to me that the turbulence of our time is a result of not allowing ourselves to cleave our digital selves from the physical and thus nurture both. We insist on bringing the algorithmic efficiency of digital primacy to bear on everything we do, eat, say, build.\n\nA dramatic inversion is necessary, and this brings me to [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/).\n\n![Bag #2957](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OmhyiqFNr7onQZr4j0xXz.png?height=2270&width=2270)\n\nLoot has been discussed mostly as a game primitive, but I think this is too simple. Loot is a generative artwork: a set of variables spawning artistic outputs off chain. Each bag is a recursive digital-prime totem, a memetic device that leads to expansive world building within digital primacy. A set of instructions.\n\nIts recursion is a direct result of its pliability through time. It’s non-static; it reflects and refracts the underlying technology. Each bag is a tool.\n\nThe rapid and frothy growth of Loot derivatives (and knock-offs) is confirmation of this. It shows the power of the idea: ”this is so stupid that I must spend my time mocking it;” “this allows us to build our own universes, how exciting;” “this will make me a lot of money.” It immediately (well, it took three days) became a bubble market. Most of these derivatives will go bust. The naysayers will celebrate. The devoted will continue building, sometimes in the wrong directions.\n\nBut as with the bubble of generative blockchain art, and the bubble of NFTs, and the (current) bubble of crypto, there remains a potent signal to which we should pay attention.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/161](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/161)\n\n", "timestamp": 1632225513, "digest": "mEoh4x8-1kDTsca-IhRIR9vygFI_vnNy0NHWTzYGF6U", "contributor": "0xa8A33539960Ef4779CB0eCEDed8002c1EcD40582"}

The cornerstone was analog: shooting black and white 35mm film, developing the negatives yourself, and making prints in the darkroom. Later years had time devoted to large format view cameras, lighting, studio setups–all the stuff that’s been around for 50-100 years–and, of course, digital capture, editing, and printing.\n\nIn my last two years at school a department-wide debate emerged: whether to still require incoming freshmen to learn the wet darkroom or let them go directly digital. For a lot of younger students it made no sense to grok a skill and set of equipment they didn’t want to use. For a lot of older students it made no sense to experiment at the cutting edge without appreciation for the art’s history.

These totems help us form narratives, and their appearance (in absolute numbers, in iterative qualities, in variability of aesthetics) has a direct relationship to our distance from the threshold.\n\nA major risk is in not recognizing the threshold; the result is a digital-prime world built with tools we can’t understand, illustrating myths that only abstract our social relationship to them. It inflates a bubble. Life feels easy. But we’re really in limbo.\n\n[Dean Kissick](https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/08/rediscovering-desire-in-a-panopticon-of-virtual-pleasures/) writes of a similar problem between cultural output and friction:\n\n> Much of culture now has the hollow, vacant feeling of having been made by algorithm. Consider the drab, broken anti-spectacle of Addison Rae performing trending TikTok dances onstage with Jimmy Kimmel or NFTs sold for millions at Christie’s and Sotheby’s—it’s art and pop stripped of all verve, fertility, and eroticism. What’s left is the new aesthetic of lifelessness and void, a consumer culture of throwaway experiences that wash right over you like an Ambien. It’s made to be experienced without friction: seamless post-death entertainment from an empire ruled over by a sleepy, old man. “Avoiding friction,” the critic Rob Horning has noted, “becomes a kind of content in itself—‘readable books’; ‘listenable music’; ‘vibes’; ‘ambience,’ etc.” And this is in keeping with a generational preference for light demi-pleasures: bumps not lines; microdosing, not getting high; sugary milks made of oats; podcasts, not conversation; the simulated intimacy of ASMR. Each of life’s pleasures in small amounts.\n\nRecognizing the threshold is particularly important for artists. They *must* grok the requisite tools and use them to shape the narrative surrounding the technological shift. They must sustain a high friction environment both as creators and for their audience. They must shock.\n\nHigh tool fluency, up and down the spiral (closer to and further from the threshold), is necessary. One must know one’s history, and then push forward. Otherwise the response to an algorithmic existence itself is honed by algorithm, so as not to be too disruptive; to sell.\n\nPart of what makes this urgent is the constant stream of legacy systems busting rivets left and right.\n\n![Maxar Technologies / Associated Press](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U5ZAAeuSz80_c1zJhXEPy.jpg?height=667&width=1200)\n\nThe ship as totem: a menacing combination of high meme content, an esoteric community, and structural fragility.\n\nThe physical prime world is literally breaking as it optimizes for digital prime users. Its systems are consolidating in the name of efficiency and introducing centralized weaknesses that halt entire networks. Its tools are opaque, if not entirely unknown, to its supposed beneficiaries.\n\nIt’s easy to see this as a sign that all things analog are destined for obsolescence. There are many in the NFT realm who seem to think–or at least proclaim loudly, to sustain a trade–there’s no going back; a switch has flipped, we’ve discovered a new set of tools that are better in every way, and a panacea is upon us. That there’s a direct relationship between one’s financial exposure to said tools and one’s insistence on their panacean qualities is no surprise. It should be obvious that this binary relationship between past and future is wrong, but to extrapolate a bit: culture doesn’t lurch forward in a series of discrete steps. Generative art is not new. We might think of Sol Lewitt’s [Wall Drawings](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/) as generative artworks (Mitchell F Chan [certainly does](https://artblocks.io/project/118)), or [Marina Abramovic](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/abramovic-rhythm-0-t14875), or [Bruce Nauman](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/bruce-nauman-body-pressure), or [Lawrence Weiner](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/137437)… The Louvre predates photography and will still exist long after NFTs are outdated. A museum is a tool–a piece of infrastructure so implicit to society that it will both adapt to and force the adaptation of new aesthetics, new concepts, new media. If NFTs are successful as an artistic medium it will be because they expand culture, not fork it.\n\nIt seems to me that the turbulence of our time is a result of not allowing ourselves to cleave our digital selves from the physical and thus nurture both. We insist on bringing the algorithmic efficiency of digital primacy to bear on everything we do, eat, say, build.\n\nA dramatic inversion is necessary, and this brings me to [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/).\n\n![Bag #2957](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OmhyiqFNr7onQZr4j0xXz.png?height=2270&width=2270)\n\nLoot has been discussed mostly as a game primitive, but I think this is too simple. Loot is a generative artwork: a set of variables spawning artistic outputs off chain. Each bag is a recursive digital-prime totem, a memetic device that leads to expansive world building within digital primacy. A set of instructions.\n\nIts recursion is a direct result of its pliability through time. It’s non-static; it reflects and refracts the underlying technology. Each bag is a tool.\n\nThe rapid and frothy growth of Loot derivatives (and knock-offs) is confirmation of this. It shows the power of the idea: ”this is so stupid that I must spend my time mocking it;” “this allows us to build our own universes, how exciting;” “this will make me a lot of money.” It immediately (well, it took three days) became a bubble market. Most of these derivatives will go bust. The naysayers will celebrate. The devoted will continue building, sometimes in the wrong directions.\n\nBut as with the bubble of generative blockchain art, and the bubble of NFTs, and the (current) bubble of crypto, there remains a potent signal to which we should pay attention.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/161](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/161)\n\n", "timestamp": 1632225702, "digest": "mEoh4x8-1kDTsca-IhRIR9vygFI_vnNy0NHWTzYGF6U", "contributor": "0xa8A33539960Ef4779CB0eCEDed8002c1EcD40582"}

Sometimes the coil is more compressed.\n\n[https://twitter.com/0ddette/status/1376008296415559680](https://twitter.com/0ddette/status/1376008296415559680)\n\nMy undergrad photography program, like most liberal art programs, was built on a structure emphasizing fundamentals as a first step along a path of cumulative experimentation–in intellectual development, in visual style, and in tools used. The cornerstone was analog: shooting black and white 35mm film, developing the negatives yourself, and making prints in the darkroom. Later years had time devoted to large format view cameras, lighting, studio setups–all the stuff that’s been around for 50-100 years–and, of course, digital capture, editing, and printing.\n\nIn my last two years at school a department-wide debate emerged: whether to still require incoming freshmen to learn the wet darkroom or let them go directly digital. For a lot of younger students it made no sense to grok a skill and set of equipment they didn’t want to use. For a lot of older students it made no sense to experiment at the cutting edge without appreciation for the art’s history. Faculty, who practiced in a wide range of media, seemed caught in the middle.\n\nWorking in color captured these questions well. It isn’t practical (or really even possible) for someone to develop color film themselves, so shooting color means taking it to an outside lab as a first step; already once removed from the artist’s hands. Chromogenic prints cannot be made in the same type of wet darkroom as gelatin silver prints since no visible spectrum of light is safe to use with the paper, so they’re exposed in total darkness (in small individual darkrooms), and developed by a machine the size of a truck that’s accessed through a closet (at Tisch ours was a Colenta and probably cost $350,000 when new, in the 1990s). No hands in trays of chemicals, no fighting over control of the stereo. The complexity and relative absurdity of the process–working in complete darkness at each step, going in and out of different tiny rooms–in fact makes it far more esoteric than black and white printing, which can be done by almost anyone in almost any dark space with a few buckets and a red light bulb. But at one time, it was the vanguard. While I was in school, it was still the dominant method of printing color, and what you saw most often on gallery walls in Chelsea.\n\nMy thesis exhibition (in 2009) was entirely chromogenic prints, and if I remember correctly about a third of my classmates did the same. Within two years, the program’s head technician emailed me saying I could have the Colenta if I would get it out of the building.\n\n[https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1369237479317004289](https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1369237479317004289)\n\nEthereum opened a new space and provides an opportunity for artists to work with a previously unknown medium. This is exciting to the point of mania-inducing, which is what makes it feel simultaneously hopeful and dangerous. It’s also what creates a financial bubble, which for the obvious reasons is dramatically exacerbated in the case of NFTs. Worst of all, it’s what often pushes aside the most interesting work being done, work which is trying to understand what the technology unlocks–what it enables in itself–separate from how it can merely transport an existing object (say, a JPEG) into a different realm (say, a hyperfinancial one). I’m talking about the work that literally cannot exist without the specific tool.\n\nAn excellent example of this is Robin Sloan’s [Amulets](https://text.bargains/) project.\n\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/815](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/815)\n\nAn amulet results from the appearance of sequential 8’s in the sha256 hash of a short piece of text; it cannot exist separate from the sha256 hash function (which is integral, but not unique, to Ethereum). The quantity of 8’s determines the amulet’s rarity (as established by the artist). The full definition and set of rules are very worth reading. It’s a nice game. It’s hard to imagine anyone paying a lot of money for these.\n\n[Framergence](https://framergence.art/) is particularly interesting because the creative mechanism is tied explicitly to Ethereum, in that the set of tokens that exists can be modified in real time on-chain by the owners. Each piece is algorithmically generated based on fractal patterns; the contract also rewards token burning by re-minting an n-1 amount of new tokens. This has led to people purchasing examples they intend to burn in the hunt for more pleasing iterations.\n\n![](https://content.framergence.art/3023962126_hires.png)\n\nEzra Miller’s [Solvency](https://solvency.art), a personal favorite, is not only technically accomplished, with the assets stored entirely on Ethereum and Arweave, but the individual mints are also beautiful, aesthetically complex and varied between mints, yet still cohesive as a body of work. Their infinite runtime is the kicker.\n\n[https://5kuzmctr2tmkwxq7vkz6ejfqrjvz7sih34rfmu6wyhnywbvkmivq.arweave.net/6qmWCnHU2KteH6qz4iSwimufyQffIlZT1sHbiwaqYis/?seed=0x1940347e592e022caa1f5b729b5902bf39de340a44dec77a99d1d2ff4070ea53?display=iframe](https://5kuzmctr2tmkwxq7vkz6ejfqrjvz7sih34rfmu6wyhnywbvkmivq.arweave.net/6qmWCnHU2KteH6qz4iSwimufyQffIlZT1sHbiwaqYis/?seed=0x1940347e592e022caa1f5b729b5902bf39de340a44dec77a99d1d2ff4070ea53?display=iframe)\n\nThese examples demonstrate the positive feedback loop that emerges from strong artist-tool relationships and leads to canonical outcomes. In the best cases it is indistinguishable from collaboration. I would go further and say that the strongest relationships depend on high friction environments. In these cases, the tools are new. They’re difficult to understand and often expensive to use. There’s a lot of trial and error. Much of the work has to be done “by hand,” and it’s slow going. The audience doesn’t have good references to understand the output; there’s probably very little criticism to place it in a historical context. The conditions are conducive to failure rather than success. And this leads to a lot of “failures.” Outside the small ecosystem of devoted creators and users, the work that employs the most experimental elements of a new technological space tends to be misunderstood, undervalued, and in many cases lost entirely.\n\nThe same dynamic (with the opposite effect on market price) can apply to esoteric and “outdated” tools and processes. It was no surprise that [the best paper maker in Japan](https://www.washiya.com/shop/iwanohousho/kodawarienglish.html) had custom-designed all of his equipment, worked without the use of any bleach or other additives, and had not changed the process first established by his family 8 generations prior. Of course, his output is 1/100th of what a modernized paper maker can achieve, let alone a factory.\n\nWhat constitutes high friction (and low friction) is an ever-moving target and always relative. In 2007 digital photography was high friction (to achieve comparable results to analog, or to embrace the unique aesthetics of pixels), and analog low friction. That has since inverted. Today, shooting 4K video on your phone feels easy; it will eventually feel cumbersome when most people have contact lens wearables, or something equally absurd-sounding.\n\n[https://twitter.com/etheria_feed/status/1370825688647884802](https://twitter.com/etheria_feed/status/1370825688647884802)\n\n[https://twitter.com/samspike/status/1439030208640823305?s=20](https://twitter.com/samspike/status/1439030208640823305?s=20)\n\nI originally began this essay in March. Etheria has since been resuscitated; NFT archeology in the search of yield is an active pursuit. Generative art is now rampant with derivatives. Copies of copies of copies. As with everything, the financial mechanisms of crypto allow–if not require–this speedrunning. Thus, we are already in a transient period of low friction and increasing mania. We’re surrounded by work that deploys the technology as an inherent component, but is otherwise artistically unremarkable. Its newness nonetheless commands enormous value. This, too, can cause artists’ work to be overlooked. Launch a series on Art Blocks and you tap into an automatic market of collectors and liquidity. Launch the same series on your own site and you may be lucky to sell a handful (probably not in this market, but you know what I mean). This problem isn’t unique to NFTs; the same dynamic is built into the structures of the legacy art world. Indeed the same dynamic emerges any time a certain technology (and its associated market) becomes frictionless enough.\n\nIt’s a failure both when a technology is used as a non-tool acceleration vehicle, and when it’s worshipped as a self-solving perpetual motion machine. During a bubble the technology exhibits both properties. Everybody rushes in because it’s a money printer, and many of those involved begin to see it as a Rosetta stone device. Irrational exuberance. Soon after the bubble pops because it’s discovered that the tools are insufficient for the narrative they sell.\n\nA similar mistake can be made with tools and their characteristics of nostalgia. This was at the heart of the debate at Tisch. Many saw digital photography as a fad, a shortcut, and aesthetically insufficient (“It’s a lower resolution than film, what’s the point?”). Thus black and white wet darkroom printing *had* to be learned; when the current iteration of digital technology was no longer in use, the artist would still have the through-line to grasp. A safety net, and therefore superior.\n\nThis is the common misconception of any new technology: riskier, less reliable, less future-proof. Because it’s iterating so quickly, it’s impermanent whenever and wherever it’s measured. It appears fleeting because most of it is fleeting. But that’s measuring the products of a tool; it’s not taking stock of the tool itself, on its inherent conceptual terms. Certain foundational components attain extreme Lindy status, while many cutting-edge experiments are ultimately relegated to history after leapfrogging each other during the rapid expansion phase. Here’s where we start arguing about Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nOf course, even gelatin silver prints, the most Lindy form of photography in history, are becoming harder to make and more homogenized–the number of companies still producing the necessary materials (film, paper, chemicals) and equipment (enlargers, cameras) has shrunk dramatically, a process that began well before digital photography became superior (the market re-prices according to future developments, not current realities). For the few photographers still working in black and white wet darkrooms, they’ve had to further hone their craft. But most have moved on to digital.\n\nDeafBeef [understands this well](https://jpg.mirror.xyz/qSUps1Krz02iyW8FCWHiEcHGaLrslw6BSldJQpuD9_A):\n\n> Your old smartphone is junk. On the other hand, an analog signal processor can be repaired, repurposed, and scavenged for parts. Oscilloscopes remain useful tools for electrical engineers. Vinyl and magnetic tape recordings from the 60s can still be played. ASCII terminal screens, for those who know how to use them, remain the most efficient way to interact with a computer for many tasks.\n\nEventually, the old smartphone will also be a field to harvest. And It turns out that inkjet prints are actually more stable and conservation-friendly than chromogenic prints; they also don’t require the use of harsh chemicals. Thus the point is not necessarily to be faithful to a specific tool, but to a certain intellectual approach, which is reliant on an appreciation for and handiness with a certain set of tools, and an ability to recognize which tools hold the most potency for honing and distilling.\n\n![David Rudnick's EXODUS 2, VII – Jagged Quartz Towers](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kQVIyPwG9JQfTpg54kLmQ.png?height=996&width=1016)\n\nI’m reminded now of [David Rudnick](https://exodus-ii.folia.app/)’s rhetorical device of [primacy](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/primacism-david-rudnick-on-the-struggle-for-primacy-type-and-poetrys-unique-value-in-an-age-of-digital-and-physical-conflict-and-percy-shelleys-mont-blanc)–Physical Prime vs. Digital Prime.

Their infinite runtime is the kicker.\n\n[https://5kuzmctr2tmkwxq7vkz6ejfqrjvz7sih34rfmu6wyhnywbvkmivq.arweave.net/6qmWCnHU2KteH6qz4iSwimufyQffIlZT1sHbiwaqYis/?seed=0x1940347e592e022caa1f5b729b5902bf39de340a44dec77a99d1d2ff4070ea53?display=iframe](https://5kuzmctr2tmkwxq7vkz6ejfqrjvz7sih34rfmu6wyhnywbvkmivq.arweave.net/6qmWCnHU2KteH6qz4iSwimufyQffIlZT1sHbiwaqYis/?seed=0x1940347e592e022caa1f5b729b5902bf39de340a44dec77a99d1d2ff4070ea53?display=iframe)\n\nThese examples demonstrate the positive feedback loop that emerges from strong artist-tool relationships and leads to canonical outcomes. In the best cases it is indistinguishable from collaboration. I would go further and say that the strongest relationships depend on high friction environments. In these cases, the tools are new. They’re difficult to understand and often expensive to use. There’s a lot of trial and error. Much of the work has to be done “by hand,” and it’s slow going. The audience doesn’t have good references to understand the output; there’s probably very little criticism to place it in a historical context. The conditions are conducive to failure rather than success. And this leads to a lot of “failures.” Outside the small ecosystem of devoted creators and users, the work that employs the most experimental elements of a new technological space tends to be misunderstood, undervalued, and in many cases lost entirely.\n\nThe same dynamic (with the opposite effect on market price) can apply to esoteric and “outdated” tools and processes that nonetheless are preserved by devoted practicians. It was no surprise that [the best paper maker in Japan](https://www.washiya.com/shop/iwanohousho/kodawarienglish.html) had custom-designed all of his equipment, worked without the use of any bleach or other additives, and had not changed the process first established by his family 8 generations prior. Of course, his output is 1/100th of what a modernized paper maker can achieve, let alone a factory.\n\nWhat constitutes high friction (and low friction) is an ever-moving target and always relative. In 2007 digital photography was high friction (to achieve comparable results to analog, or to embrace the unique aesthetics of pixels), analog low friction. That has since inverted. Today, shooting 4K video on your phone feels easy; it will eventually feel cumbersome when most people have contact lens wearables, or something equally absurd-sounding.\n\n[https://twitter.com/etheria_feed/status/1370825688647884802](https://twitter.com/etheria_feed/status/1370825688647884802)\n\n[https://twitter.com/samspike/status/1439030208640823305?s=20](https://twitter.com/samspike/status/1439030208640823305?s=20)\n\nI originally began this essay in March. Etheria has since been resuscitated; NFT archeology in the search of yield is an active pursuit. Generative art is now rampant with derivatives. Copies of copies of copies. As with everything, the financial mechanisms of crypto allow–if not require–this speedrunning. Thus, we are already in a transient period of low friction and increasing mania. We’re surrounded by work that deploys the technology as an inherent component, but is otherwise artistically unremarkable. Its newness nonetheless commands enormous value. This, too, can cause artists’ work to be overlooked. Launch a series on Art Blocks and you tap into an automatic market of collectors and liquidity. Launch the same series on your own site and you may be lucky to sell a handful (probably not in this market, but you know what I mean). This problem isn’t unique to NFTs; the same dynamic is built into the structures of the legacy art world. Indeed the same dynamic emerges any time a certain technology (and its associated market) becomes frictionless enough.\n\nIt’s a failure both when a technology is used as a non-tool acceleration vehicle, and when it’s worshipped as a self-solving perpetual motion machine. During a bubble the technology exhibits both properties. Everybody rushes in because it’s a money printer, and many of those involved begin to see it as a Rosetta stone device. Irrational exuberance. Soon after the bubble pops because it’s discovered that the tools are insufficient for the narrative they sell.\n\nA similar mistake can be made with tools and their characteristics of nostalgia. This was at the heart of the debate at Tisch. Many saw digital photography as a fad, a shortcut, and aesthetically insufficient (“It’s a lower resolution than film, what’s the point?”). Thus black and white wet darkroom printing *had* to be learned; when the current iteration of digital technology was no longer in use, the artist would still have the through-line to grasp. A safety net, and therefore superior.\n\nThis is the common misconception of any new technology: riskier, less reliable, less future-proof. Because it’s iterating so quickly, it’s impermanent whenever and wherever it’s measured. It appears fleeting because most of it is fleeting. But that’s measuring the products of a tool; it’s not taking stock of the tool itself, on its inherent conceptual terms. Certain foundational components attain extreme Lindy status, while many cutting-edge experiments are ultimately relegated to history after leapfrogging each other during the rapid expansion phase. Here’s where we start arguing about Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nOf course, even gelatin silver prints, the most Lindy form of photography in history, are becoming harder to make and more homogenized–the number of companies still producing the necessary materials (film, paper, chemicals) and equipment (enlargers, cameras) has shrunk dramatically, a process that began well before digital photography became superior (the market re-prices according to future developments, not current realities). For the few photographers still working in black and white wet darkrooms, they’ve had to further hone their craft. But most have moved on to digital.\n\nDeafBeef [understands this well](https://jpg.mirror.xyz/qSUps1Krz02iyW8FCWHiEcHGaLrslw6BSldJQpuD9_A):\n\n> Your old smartphone is junk. On the other hand, an analog signal processor can be repaired, repurposed, and scavenged for parts. Oscilloscopes remain useful tools for electrical engineers. Vinyl and magnetic tape recordings from the 60s can still be played. ASCII terminal screens, for those who know how to use them, remain the most efficient way to interact with a computer for many tasks.\n\nEventually, the old smartphone will also be a field to harvest. And it turns out that inkjet prints are actually more stable and conservation-friendly than chromogenic prints; they also don’t require the use of harsh chemicals. Thus the point is not necessarily to be faithful to a specific tool, but to a certain intellectual approach, which is reliant on an appreciation for and handiness with a certain set of tools, and an ability to recognize which tools hold the most potency for honing and distilling.\n\n![David Rudnick's EXODUS 2, VII – Jagged Quartz Towers](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kQVIyPwG9JQfTpg54kLmQ.png?height=996&width=1016)\n\nI’m reminded now of [David Rudnick](https://exodus-ii.folia.app/)’s rhetorical device of [primacy](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/primacism-david-rudnick-on-the-struggle-for-primacy-type-and-poetrys-unique-value-in-an-age-of-digital-and-physical-conflict-and-percy-shelleys-mont-blanc)–Physical Prime vs. Digital Prime. We’re rapidly approaching the event horizon of digital primacy, the point at which we will spend more of our time in digital spaces rather than physical ones. The exponential deployment of digital objects as totemic and memetic devices is testament to this. These totems help us form narratives, and their appearance (in absolute numbers, in iterative qualities, in variability of aesthetics) has a direct relationship to our distance from the threshold.\n\nA major risk is in not recognizing the threshold; the result is a digital-prime world built with tools we can’t understand, illustrating myths that only abstract our social relationship to them. It inflates a bubble. Life feels easy. But we’re really in limbo.\n\n[Dean Kissick](https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/08/rediscovering-desire-in-a-panopticon-of-virtual-pleasures/) writes of a similar problem between cultural output and friction:\n\n> Much of culture now has the hollow, vacant feeling of having been made by algorithm. Consider the drab, broken anti-spectacle of Addison Rae performing trending TikTok dances onstage with Jimmy Kimmel or NFTs sold for millions at Christie’s and Sotheby’s—it’s art and pop stripped of all verve, fertility, and eroticism. What’s left is the new aesthetic of lifelessness and void, a consumer culture of throwaway experiences that wash right over you like an Ambien. It’s made to be experienced without friction: seamless post-death entertainment from an empire ruled over by a sleepy, old man. “Avoiding friction,” the critic Rob Horning has noted, “becomes a kind of content in itself—‘readable books’; ‘listenable music’; ‘vibes’; ‘ambience,’ etc.” And this is in keeping with a generational preference for light demi-pleasures: bumps not lines; microdosing, not getting high; sugary milks made of oats; podcasts, not conversation; the simulated intimacy of ASMR. Each of life’s pleasures in small amounts.\n\nRecognizing the threshold is particularly important for artists. They *must* grok the requisite tools and use them to shape the narrative surrounding the technological shift. They must sustain a high friction environment both as creators and for their audience. They must shock.\n\nHigh tool fluency, up and down the spiral (closer to and further from the threshold), is necessary. One must know one’s history, and then push forward. Otherwise the response to an algorithmic existence itself is honed by algorithm, so as not to be too disruptive; to sell.\n\nPart of what makes this urgent is the constant stream of legacy systems busting rivets left and right.\n\n![Maxar Technologies / Associated Press](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U5ZAAeuSz80_c1zJhXEPy.jpg?height=667&width=1200)\n\nThe ship as totem: a menacing combination of high meme content, an esoteric community, and structural fragility.\n\nThe physical prime world is literally breaking as it optimizes for digital prime users. Its systems are consolidating in the name of efficiency and introducing centralized weaknesses that halt entire networks. Its tools are opaque, if not entirely unknown, to its supposed beneficiaries.\n\nIt’s easy to see this as a sign that all things analog are destined for obsolescence. There are many in the NFT realm who seem to think–or at least proclaim loudly, to sustain a trade–there’s no going back; a switch has flipped, we’ve discovered a new set of tools that are better in every way, and a panacea is upon us. That there’s a direct relationship between one’s financial exposure to said tools and one’s insistence on their panacean qualities is no surprise. It should be obvious that this binary relationship between past and future is wrong, but to extrapolate a bit: culture doesn’t lurch forward in a series of discrete steps. Generative art is not new. We might think of Sol Lewitt’s [Wall Drawings](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/) as generative artworks (Mitchell F Chan [certainly does](https://artblocks.io/project/118)), or [Marina Abramovic](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/abramovic-rhythm-0-t14875), or [Bruce Nauman](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/bruce-nauman-body-pressure), or [Lawrence Weiner](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/137437)… The Louvre predates photography and will still exist long after NFTs are outdated. A museum is a tool–a piece of infrastructure so implicit to society that it will both adapt to and force the adaptation of new aesthetics, new concepts, new media. If NFTs are successful as an artistic medium it will be because they expand culture, not fork it.\n\nIt seems to me that the turbulence of our time is a result of not allowing ourselves to cleave our digital selves from the physical and thus nurture both. We insist on bringing the algorithmic efficiency of digital primacy to bear on everything we do, eat, say, build.\n\nA dramatic inversion is necessary, and this brings me to [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/).\n\n![Bag #2957](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OmhyiqFNr7onQZr4j0xXz.png?height=2270&width=2270)\n\nLoot has been discussed mostly as a game primitive, but I think this is too simple. Loot is a generative artwork: a set of variables spawning artistic outputs off chain. Each bag is a recursive digital-prime totem, a memetic device that leads to expansive world building within digital primacy. A set of instructions.\n\nIts recursion is a direct result of its pliability through time. It’s non-static; it reflects and refracts the underlying technology. Each bag is a tool.\n\nThe rapid and frothy growth of Loot derivatives (and knock-offs) is confirmation of this. It shows the power of the idea: ”this is so stupid that I must spend my time mocking it;” “this allows us to build our own universes, how exciting;” “this will make me a lot of money.” It immediately (well, it took three days) became a bubble market. Most of these derivatives will go bust. The naysayers will celebrate. The devoted will continue building, sometimes in the wrong directions.\n\nBut as with the bubble of generative blockchain art, and the bubble of NFTs, and the (current) bubble of crypto, there remains a potent signal to which we should pay attention.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/161](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/161)\n\n", "timestamp": 1632226111, "digest": "mEoh4x8-1kDTsca-IhRIR9vygFI_vnNy0NHWTzYGF6U", "contributor": "0xa8A33539960Ef4779CB0eCEDed8002c1EcD40582"}

Sometimes the coil is more compressed.\n\n[https://twitter.com/0ddette/status/1376008296415559680](https://twitter.com/0ddette/status/1376008296415559680)\n\nMy undergrad photography program, like most liberal art programs, was built on a structure emphasizing fundamentals as a first step along a path of cumulative experimentation–in intellectual development, in visual style, and in tools used. The cornerstone was analog: shooting black and white 35mm film, developing the negatives yourself, and making prints in the darkroom. Later years had time devoted to large format view cameras, lighting, studio setups–all the stuff that’s been around for 50-100 years–and, of course, digital capture, editing, and printing.\n\nIn my last two years at school a department-wide debate emerged: whether to still require incoming freshmen to learn the wet darkroom or let them go directly digital. For a lot of younger students it made no sense to grok a skill and set of equipment they didn’t want to use. For a lot of older students it made no sense to experiment at the cutting edge without appreciation for the art’s history. Faculty, who practiced in a wide range of media, seemed caught in the middle.\n\nWorking in color captured these questions well. It isn’t practical (or really even possible) for someone to develop color film themselves, so shooting color means taking it to an outside lab as a first step; already once removed from the artist’s hands. Chromogenic prints cannot be made in the same type of wet darkroom as gelatin silver prints since no visible spectrum of light is safe to use with the paper, so they’re exposed in total darkness (in small individual darkrooms), and developed by a machine the size of a truck that’s accessed through a closet (at Tisch ours was a Colenta and probably cost $350,000 when new, in the 1990s). No hands in trays of chemicals, no fighting over control of the stereo. The complexity and relative absurdity of the process–working in complete darkness at each step, going in and out of different tiny rooms–in fact makes it far more esoteric than black and white printing, which can be done by almost anyone in almost any dark space with a few buckets and a red light bulb. But at one time, it was the vanguard. While I was in school, it was still the dominant method of printing color, and what you saw most often on gallery walls in Chelsea.\n\nMy thesis exhibition (in 2009) was entirely chromogenic prints, and if I remember correctly about a third of my classmates did the same. Within two years, the program’s head technician emailed me saying I could have the Colenta if I would get it out of the building.\n\n[https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1369237479317004289](https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1369237479317004289)\n\nEthereum opened a new space and provides an opportunity for artists to work with a previously unknown medium. This is exciting to the point of mania-inducing, which is what makes it feel simultaneously hopeful and dangerous. It’s also what creates a financial bubble, which for the obvious reasons is dramatically exacerbated in the case of NFTs. Worst of all, it’s what often pushes aside the most interesting work being done, work which is trying to understand what the technology unlocks–what it enables in itself–separate from how it can merely transport an existing object (say, a JPEG) into a different realm (say, a hyperfinancial one). I’m talking about the work that literally cannot exist without the specific tool.\n\nAn excellent example of this is Robin Sloan’s [Amulets](https://text.bargains/) project.\n\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/815](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/815)\n\nAn amulet results from the appearance of sequential 8’s in the sha256 hash of a short piece of text; it cannot exist separate from the sha256 hash function (which is integral, but not unique, to Ethereum). The quantity of 8’s determines the amulet’s rarity (as established by the artist). The full definition and set of rules are very worth reading. It’s a nice game. It’s hard to imagine anyone paying a lot of money for these.\n\n[Framergence](https://framergence.art/) is particularly interesting because the creative mechanism is tied explicitly to Ethereum, in that the set of tokens that exists can be modified in real time on-chain by the owners. Each piece is algorithmically generated based on fractal patterns; the contract also rewards token burning by re-minting an n-1 amount of new tokens. This has led to people purchasing examples they intend to burn in the hunt for more pleasing iterations.\n\n![](https://content.framergence.art/3023962126_hires.png)\n\nEzra Miller’s [Solvency](https://solvency.art), a personal favorite, is not only technically accomplished, with the assets stored entirely on Ethereum and Arweave, but the individual mints are also beautiful, aesthetically complex and varied, yet still cohesive as a body of work.

We might think of Sol Lewitt’s [Wall Drawings](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/) as generative artworks (Mitchell F Chan [certainly does](https://artblocks.io/project/118)), or [Marina Abramovic](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/abramovic-rhythm-0-t14875), or [Bruce Nauman](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/bruce-nauman-body-pressure), or [Lawrence Weiner](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/137437)… The Louvre predates photography and will still exist long after NFTs are outdated. A museum is a tool–a piece of infrastructure so implicit to society that it will both adapt to and force the adaptation of new aesthetics, new concepts, new media. If NFTs are successful as an artistic medium it will be because they expand culture, not fork it.\n\nIt seems to me that the turbulence of our time is a result of not allowing ourselves to cleave our digital selves from the physical and thus nurture both. We insist on bringing the algorithmic efficiency of digital primacy to bear on everything we do, eat, say, build.\n\nA dramatic inversion is necessary, and this brings me to [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/).\n\n![Bag #2957](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OmhyiqFNr7onQZr4j0xXz.png?height=2270&width=2270)\n\nLoot has been discussed mostly as a game primitive, but I think this is too simple. Loot is a generative artwork: a set of variables spawning artistic outputs off chain. Each bag is a recursive digital-prime totem, a memetic device that leads to expansive world building within digital primacy. A set of instructions.\n\nIts recursion is a direct result of its pliability through time. It’s non-static; it reflects and refracts the underlying technology. Each bag is a tool.\n\nThe rapid and frothy growth of Loot derivatives (and knock-offs) is confirmation of this. It shows the power of the idea: ”this is so stupid that I must spend my time mocking it;” “this allows us to build our own universes, how exciting;” “this will make me a lot of money.” It immediately (well, it took three days) became a bubble market. Most of these derivatives will go bust. The naysayers will celebrate. The devoted will continue building, sometimes in the wrong directions.\n\nBut as with the bubble of generative blockchain art, and the bubble of NFTs, and the (current) bubble of crypto, there remains a potent signal to which we should pay attention.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/161](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/161)\n\n", "timestamp": 1632226211, "digest": "mEoh4x8-1kDTsca-IhRIR9vygFI_vnNy0NHWTzYGF6U", "contributor": "0xa8A33539960Ef4779CB0eCEDed8002c1EcD40582"}

Sometimes the coil is more compressed.\n\n[https://twitter.com/0ddette/status/1376008296415559680](https://twitter.com/0ddette/status/1376008296415559680)\n\nMy undergrad photography program, like most liberal art programs, was built on a structure emphasizing fundamentals as a first step along a path of cumulative experimentation–in intellectual development, in visual style, and in tools used. The cornerstone was analog: shooting black and white 35mm film, developing the negatives yourself, and making prints in the darkroom. Later years had time devoted to large format view cameras, lighting, studio setups–all the stuff that’s been around for 50-100 years–and, of course, digital capture, editing, and printing.\n\nIn my last two years at school a department-wide debate emerged: whether to still require incoming freshmen to learn the wet darkroom or let them go directly digital. For a lot of younger students it made no sense to grok a skill and set of equipment they didn’t want to use. For a lot of older students it made no sense to experiment at the cutting edge without appreciation for the art’s history. Faculty, who practiced in a wide range of media, seemed caught in the middle.\n\nWorking in color captured these questions well. It isn’t practical (or really even possible) for someone to develop color film themselves, so shooting color means taking it to an outside lab as a first step; already once removed from the artist’s hands. Chromogenic prints cannot be made in the same type of wet darkroom as gelatin silver prints since no visible spectrum of light is safe to use with the paper, so they’re exposed in total darkness (in small individual darkrooms), and developed by a machine the size of a truck that’s accessed through a closet (at Tisch ours was a Colenta and probably cost $350,000 when new, in the 1990s). No hands in trays of chemicals, no fighting over control of the stereo. The complexity and relative absurdity of the process–working in complete darkness at each step, going in and out of different tiny rooms–in fact makes it far more esoteric than black and white printing, which can be done by almost anyone in almost any dark space with a few buckets and a red light bulb. But at one time, it was the vanguard. While I was in school, it was still the dominant method of printing color, and what you saw most often on gallery walls in Chelsea.\n\nMy thesis exhibition (in 2009) was entirely chromogenic prints, and if I remember correctly about a third of my classmates did the same. Within two years, the program’s head technician emailed me saying I could have the Colenta if I would get it out of the building.\n\n[https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1369237479317004289](https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1369237479317004289)\n\nEthereum opened a new space and provides an opportunity for artists to work with a previously unknown medium. This is exciting to the point of mania-inducing, which is what makes it feel simultaneously hopeful and dangerous. It’s also what creates a financial bubble, which for the obvious reasons is dramatically exacerbated in the case of NFTs. Worst of all, it’s what often pushes aside the most interesting work being done, work which is trying to understand what the technology unlocks–what it enables in itself–separate from how it can merely transport an existing object (say, a JPEG) into a different realm (say, a hyperfinancial one). I’m talking about the work that literally cannot exist without the specific tool.\n\nAn excellent example of this is Robin Sloan’s [Amulets](https://text.bargains/) project.\n\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/815](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/815)\n\nAn amulet results from the appearance of sequential 8’s in the sha256 hash of a short piece of text; it cannot exist separate from the sha256 hash function (which is integral, but not unique, to Ethereum). The quantity of 8’s determines the amulet’s rarity (as established by the artist). The full definition and set of rules are very worth reading. It’s a nice game. It’s hard to imagine anyone paying a lot of money for these.\n\n[Framergence](https://framergence.art/) is particularly interesting because the creative mechanism is tied explicitly to Ethereum, in that the set of tokens that exists can be modified in real time on-chain by the owners. Each piece is algorithmically generated based on fractal patterns; the contract also rewards token burning by re-minting an n-1 amount of new tokens. This has led to people purchasing examples they intend to burn in the hunt for more pleasing iterations.\n\n![](https://content.framergence.art/3023962126_hires.png)\n\nEzra Miller’s [Solvency](https://solvency.art), a personal favorite, is not only technically accomplished, with the assets stored entirely on Ethereum and Arweave, but the individual mints are also beautiful, aesthetically complex and varied, yet still cohesive as a body of work. Their infinite runtime is the kicker.\n\n[https://5kuzmctr2tmkwxq7vkz6ejfqrjvz7sih34rfmu6wyhnywbvkmivq.arweave.net/6qmWCnHU2KteH6qz4iSwimufyQffIlZT1sHbiwaqYis/?seed=0x1940347e592e022caa1f5b729b5902bf39de340a44dec77a99d1d2ff4070ea53?display=iframe](https://5kuzmctr2tmkwxq7vkz6ejfqrjvz7sih34rfmu6wyhnywbvkmivq.arweave.net/6qmWCnHU2KteH6qz4iSwimufyQffIlZT1sHbiwaqYis/?seed=0x1940347e592e022caa1f5b729b5902bf39de340a44dec77a99d1d2ff4070ea53?display=iframe)\n\nThese examples demonstrate the positive feedback loop that emerges from strong artist-tool relationships and leads to canonical outcomes. In the best cases it is indistinguishable from collaboration. I would go further and say that the strongest relationships depend on high friction environments. In these cases, the tools are new. They’re difficult to understand and often expensive to use. There’s a lot of trial and error. Much of the work has to be done “by hand,” and it’s slow going. The audience doesn’t have good references to understand the output; there’s probably very little criticism to place it in a historical context. The conditions are conducive to failure rather than success. And this leads to a lot of “failures.” Outside the small ecosystem of devoted creators and users, the work that employs the most experimental elements of a new technological space tends to be misunderstood, undervalued, and in many cases lost entirely.\n\nThe same dynamic (with the opposite effect on market price) can apply to esoteric and “outdated” tools and processes that nonetheless are sustained by devoted practicians. It was no surprise that [the best paper maker in Japan](https://www.washiya.com/shop/iwanohousho/kodawarienglish.html) had custom-designed all of his equipment, worked without the use of any bleach or other additives, and had not changed the process first established by his family 8 generations prior. Of course, his output is 1/100th of what a modernized paper maker can achieve, let alone a factory.\n\nWhat constitutes high friction (and low friction) is an ever-moving target and always relative. In 2007 digital photography was high friction (to achieve comparable results to analog, or to embrace the unique aesthetics of pixels), and analog low friction. That has since inverted. Today, shooting 4K video on your phone feels easy; it will eventually feel cumbersome when most people have contact lens wearables, or something equally absurd-sounding.\n\n[https://twitter.com/etheria_feed/status/1370825688647884802](https://twitter.com/etheria_feed/status/1370825688647884802)\n\n[https://twitter.com/samspike/status/1439030208640823305?s=20](https://twitter.com/samspike/status/1439030208640823305?s=20)\n\nI originally began this essay in March. Etheria has since been resuscitated; NFT archeology in the search of yield is an active pursuit. Generative art is now rampant with derivatives. Copies of copies of copies. As with everything, the financial mechanisms of crypto allow–if not require–this speedrunning. Thus, we are already in a transient period of low friction and increasing mania. We’re surrounded by work that deploys the technology as an inherent component, but is otherwise artistically unremarkable. Its newness nonetheless commands enormous value. This, too, can cause artists’ work to be overlooked. Launch a series on Art Blocks and you tap into an automatic market of collectors and liquidity. Launch the same series on your own site and you may be lucky to sell a handful (probably not in this market, but you know what I mean). This problem isn’t unique to NFTs; the same dynamic is built into the structures of the legacy art world. Indeed the same dynamic emerges any time a certain technology (and its associated market) becomes frictionless enough.\n\nIt’s a failure both when a technology is used as a non-tool acceleration vehicle, and when it’s worshipped as a self-solving perpetual motion machine. During a bubble the technology exhibits both properties. Everybody rushes in because it’s a money printer, and many of those involved begin to see it as a Rosetta stone device. Irrational exuberance. Soon after the bubble pops because it’s discovered that the tools are insufficient for the narrative they sell.\n\nA similar mistake can be made with tools and their characteristics of nostalgia. This was at the heart of the debate at Tisch. Many saw digital photography as a fad, a shortcut, and aesthetically insufficient (“It’s a lower resolution than film, what’s the point?”). Thus black and white wet darkroom printing *had* to be learned; when the current iteration of digital technology was no longer in use, the artist would still have the through-line to grasp. A safety net, and therefore superior.\n\nThis is the common misconception of any new technology: riskier, less reliable, less future-proof. Because it’s iterating so quickly, it’s impermanent whenever and wherever it’s measured. It appears fleeting because most of it is fleeting. But that’s measuring the products of a tool; it’s not taking stock of the tool itself, on its inherent conceptual terms. Certain foundational components attain extreme Lindy status, while many cutting-edge experiments are ultimately relegated to history after leapfrogging each other during the rapid expansion phase. Here’s where we start arguing about Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nOf course, even gelatin silver prints, the most Lindy form of photography in history, are becoming harder to make and more homogenized–the number of companies still producing the necessary materials (film, paper, chemicals) and equipment (enlargers, cameras) has shrunk dramatically, a process that began well before digital photography became superior (the market re-prices according to future developments, not current realities). For the few photographers still working in black and white wet darkrooms, they’ve had to further hone their craft. But most have moved on to digital.\n\nDeafBeef [understands this well](https://jpg.mirror.xyz/qSUps1Krz02iyW8FCWHiEcHGaLrslw6BSldJQpuD9_A):\n\n> Your old smartphone is junk. On the other hand, an analog signal processor can be repaired, repurposed, and scavenged for parts. Oscilloscopes remain useful tools for electrical engineers. Vinyl and magnetic tape recordings from the 60s can still be played. ASCII terminal screens, for those who know how to use them, remain the most efficient way to interact with a computer for many tasks.\n\nEventually, the old smartphone will also be a field to harvest. And It turns out that inkjet prints are actually more stable and conservation-friendly than chromogenic prints; they also don’t require the use of harsh chemicals. Thus the point is not necessarily to be faithful to a specific tool, but to a certain intellectual approach, which is reliant on an appreciation for and handiness with a certain set of tools, and an ability to recognize which tools hold the most potency for honing and distilling.\n\n![David Rudnick's EXODUS 2, VII – Jagged Quartz Towers](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kQVIyPwG9JQfTpg54kLmQ.png?height=996&width=1016)\n\nI’m reminded now of [David Rudnick](https://exodus-ii.folia.app/)’s rhetorical device of [primacy](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/primacism-david-rudnick-on-the-struggle-for-primacy-type-and-poetrys-unique-value-in-an-age-of-digital-and-physical-conflict-and-percy-shelleys-mont-blanc)–Physical Prime vs. Digital Prime. We’re rapidly approaching the event horizon of digital primacy, the point at which we will spend more of our time in digital spaces rather than physical ones. The exponential deployment of digital objects as totemic and memetic devices is testament to this. These totems help us form narratives, and their appearance (in absolute numbers, in iterative qualities, in variability of aesthetics) has a direct relationship to our distance from the threshold.\n\nA major risk is in not recognizing the threshold; the result is a digital-prime world built with tools we can’t understand, illustrating myths that only abstract our social relationship to them. It inflates a bubble. Life feels easy. But we’re really in limbo.\n\n[Dean Kissick](https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/08/rediscovering-desire-in-a-panopticon-of-virtual-pleasures/) writes of a similar problem between cultural output and friction:\n\n> Much of culture now has the hollow, vacant feeling of having been made by algorithm. Consider the drab, broken anti-spectacle of Addison Rae performing trending TikTok dances onstage with Jimmy Kimmel or NFTs sold for millions at Christie’s and Sotheby’s—it’s art and pop stripped of all verve, fertility, and eroticism. What’s left is the new aesthetic of lifelessness and void, a consumer culture of throwaway experiences that wash right over you like an Ambien. It’s made to be experienced without friction: seamless post-death entertainment from an empire ruled over by a sleepy, old man. “Avoiding friction,” the critic Rob Horning has noted, “becomes a kind of content in itself—‘readable books’; ‘listenable music’; ‘vibes’; ‘ambience,’ etc.” And this is in keeping with a generational preference for light demi-pleasures: bumps not lines; microdosing, not getting high; sugary milks made of oats; podcasts, not conversation; the simulated intimacy of ASMR. Each of life’s pleasures in small amounts.\n\nRecognizing the threshold is particularly important for artists. They *must* grok the requisite tools and use them to shape the narrative surrounding the technological shift. They must sustain a high friction environment both as creators and for their audience. They must shock.\n\nHigh tool fluency, up and down the spiral (closer to and further from the threshold), is necessary. One must know one’s history, and then push forward. Otherwise the response to an algorithmic existence itself is honed by algorithm, so as not to be too disruptive; to sell.\n\nPart of what makes this urgent is the constant stream of legacy systems busting rivets left and right.\n\n![Maxar Technologies / Associated Press](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U5ZAAeuSz80_c1zJhXEPy.jpg?height=667&width=1200)\n\nThe ship as totem: a menacing combination of high meme content, an esoteric community, and structural fragility.\n\nThe physical prime world is literally breaking as it optimizes for digital prime users. Its systems are consolidating in the name of efficiency and introducing centralized weaknesses that halt entire networks. Its tools are opaque, if not entirely unknown, to its supposed beneficiaries.\n\nIt’s easy to see this as a sign that all things analog are destined for obsolescence. There are many in the NFT realm who seem to think–or at least proclaim loudly, to sustain a trade–there’s no going back; a switch has flipped, we’ve discovered a new set of tools that are better in every way, and a panacea is upon us. That there’s a direct relationship between one’s financial exposure to said tools and one’s insistence on their panacean qualities is no surprise. It should be obvious that this binary relationship between past and future is wrong, but to extrapolate a bit: culture doesn’t lurch forward in a series of discrete steps. Generative art is not new.

Etheria has since been resuscitated; NFT archeology in the search of yield is an active pursuit. Generative art is now rampant with derivatives. Copies of copies of copies. As with everything, the financial mechanisms of crypto allow–if not require–this speedrunning. Thus, we are already in a transient period of low friction and increasing mania. We’re surrounded by work that deploys the technology as an inherent component, but is otherwise artistically unremarkable. Its newness nonetheless commands enormous value. This, too, can cause artists’ work to be overlooked. Launch a series on Art Blocks and you tap into an automatic market of collectors and liquidity. Launch the same series on your own site and you may be lucky to sell a handful (probably not in this market, but you know what I mean). This problem isn’t unique to NFTs; the same dynamic is built into the structures of the legacy art world. Indeed the same dynamic emerges any time a certain technology (and its associated market) becomes frictionless enough.\n\nIt’s a failure both when a technology is used as a non-tool acceleration vehicle, and when it’s worshipped as a self-solving perpetual motion machine. During a bubble the technology exhibits both properties. Everybody rushes in because it’s a money printer, and many of those involved begin to see it as a Rosetta stone device. Irrational exuberance. Soon after the bubble pops because it’s discovered that the tools are insufficient for the narrative they sell.\n\nA similar mistake can be made with tools and their characteristics of nostalgia. This was at the heart of the debate at Tisch. Many saw digital photography as a fad, a shortcut, and aesthetically insufficient (“It’s a lower resolution than film, what’s the point?”). Thus black and white wet darkroom printing *had* to be learned; when the current iteration of digital technology was no longer in use, the artist would still have the through-line to grasp. A safety net, and therefore superior.\n\nThis is the common misconception of any new technology: riskier, less reliable, less future-proof. Because it’s iterating so quickly, it’s impermanent whenever and wherever it’s measured. It appears fleeting because most of it is fleeting. But that’s measuring the products of a tool; it’s not taking stock of the tool itself, on its inherent conceptual terms. Certain foundational components attain extreme Lindy status, while many cutting-edge experiments are ultimately relegated to history after leapfrogging each other during the rapid expansion phase. Here’s where we start arguing about Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nOf course, even gelatin silver prints, the most Lindy form of photography in history, are becoming harder to make and more homogenized–the number of companies still producing the necessary materials (film, paper, chemicals) and equipment (enlargers, cameras) has shrunk dramatically, a process that began well before digital photography became superior (the market re-prices according to future developments, not current realities). For the few photographers still working in black and white wet darkrooms, they’ve had to further hone their craft. But most have moved on to digital.\n\nDeafBeef [understands this well](https://jpg.mirror.xyz/qSUps1Krz02iyW8FCWHiEcHGaLrslw6BSldJQpuD9_A):\n\n> Your old smartphone is junk. On the other hand, an analog signal processor can be repaired, repurposed, and scavenged for parts. Oscilloscopes remain useful tools for electrical engineers. Vinyl and magnetic tape recordings from the 60s can still be played. ASCII terminal screens, for those who know how to use them, remain the most efficient way to interact with a computer for many tasks.\n\nEventually, the old smartphone will also be a field to harvest. And It turns out that inkjet prints are actually more stable and conservation-friendly than chromogenic prints; they also don’t require the use of harsh chemicals. Thus the point is not necessarily to be faithful to a specific tool, but to a certain intellectual approach, which is reliant on an appreciation for and handiness with a certain set of tools, and an ability to recognize which tools hold the most potency for honing and distilling.\n\n![David Rudnick's EXODUS 2, VII – Jagged Quartz Towers](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kQVIyPwG9JQfTpg54kLmQ.png?height=996&width=1016)\n\nI’m reminded now of [David Rudnick](https://exodus-ii.folia.app/)’s rhetorical device of [primacy](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/primacism-david-rudnick-on-the-struggle-for-primacy-type-and-poetrys-unique-value-in-an-age-of-digital-and-physical-conflict-and-percy-shelleys-mont-blanc)–Physical Prime vs. Digital Prime. We’re rapidly approaching the event horizon of digital primacy, the point at which we will spend more of our time in digital spaces rather than physical ones. The exponential deployment of digital objects as totemic and memetic devices is testament to this. These totems help us form narratives, and their appearance (in absolute numbers, in iterative qualities, in variability of aesthetics) has a direct relationship to our distance from the threshold.\n\nA major risk is in not recognizing the threshold; the result is a digital-prime world built with tools we can’t understand, illustrating myths that only abstract our social relationship to them. It inflates a bubble. Life feels easy. But we’re really in limbo.\n\n[Dean Kissick](https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/08/rediscovering-desire-in-a-panopticon-of-virtual-pleasures/) writes of a similar problem between cultural output and friction:\n\n> Much of culture now has the hollow, vacant feeling of having been made by algorithm. Consider the drab, broken anti-spectacle of Addison Rae performing trending TikTok dances onstage with Jimmy Kimmel or NFTs sold for millions at Christie’s and Sotheby’s—it’s art and pop stripped of all verve, fertility, and eroticism. What’s left is the new aesthetic of lifelessness and void, a consumer culture of throwaway experiences that wash right over you like an Ambien. It’s made to be experienced without friction: seamless post-death entertainment from an empire ruled over by a sleepy, old man. “Avoiding friction,” the critic Rob Horning has noted, “becomes a kind of content in itself—‘readable books’; ‘listenable music’; ‘vibes’; ‘ambience,’ etc.” And this is in keeping with a generational preference for light demi-pleasures: bumps not lines; microdosing, not getting high; sugary milks made of oats; podcasts, not conversation; the simulated intimacy of ASMR. Each of life’s pleasures in small amounts.\n\nRecognizing the threshold is particularly important for artists. They *must* grok the requisite tools and use them to shape the narrative surrounding the technological shift. They must sustain a high friction environment both as creators and for their audience. They must shock.\n\nHigh tool fluency, up and down the spiral (closer to and further from the threshold), is necessary. One must know one’s history, and then push forward. Otherwise the response to an algorithmic existence itself is honed by algorithm, so as not to be too disruptive; to sell.\n\nPart of what makes this urgent is the constant stream of legacy systems busting rivets left and right.\n\n![Maxar Technologies / Associated Press](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U5ZAAeuSz80_c1zJhXEPy.jpg?height=667&width=1200)\n\nThe ship as totem: a menacing combination of high meme content, an esoteric community, and structural fragility.\n\nThe physical prime world is literally breaking as it optimizes for digital prime users. Its systems are consolidating in the name of efficiency and introducing centralized weaknesses that halt entire networks. Its tools are opaque, if not entirely unknown, to its supposed beneficiaries.\n\nIt’s easy to see this as a sign that all things analog are destined for obsolescence. There are many in the NFT realm who seem to think–or at least proclaim loudly, to sustain a trade–there’s no going back; a switch has flipped, we’ve discovered a new set of tools that are better in every way, and a panacea is upon us. That there’s a direct relationship between one’s financial exposure to said tools and one’s insistence on their panacean qualities is no surprise. It should be obvious that this binary relationship between past and future is wrong, but to extrapolate a bit: culture doesn’t lurch forward in a series of discrete steps. Generative art is not new. We might think of Sol Lewitt’s [Wall Drawings](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/) as generative artworks (Mitchell F Chan [certainly does](https://artblocks.io/project/118)), or [Marina Abramovic](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/abramovic-rhythm-0-t14875), or [Bruce Nauman](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/bruce-nauman-body-pressure), or [Lawrence Weiner](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/137437)… The Louvre predates photography and will still exist long after NFTs are outdated. A museum is a tool–a piece of infrastructure so implicit to society that it will both adapt to and force the adaptation of new aesthetics, new concepts, new media. If NFTs are successful as an artistic medium it will be because they expand culture, not fork it.\n\nIt seems to me that the turbulence of our time is a result of not allowing ourselves to cleave our digital selves from the physical and thus nurture both. We insist on bringing the algorithmic efficiency of digital primacy to bear on everything we do, eat, say, build.\n\nA dramatic inversion is necessary, and this brings me to [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/).\n\n![Bag #2957](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OmhyiqFNr7onQZr4j0xXz.png?height=2270&width=2270)\n\nLoot has been discussed mostly as a game primitive, but I think this is too simple. Loot is a generative artwork: a set of variables spawning artistic outputs off chain. Each bag is a recursive digital-prime totem, a memetic device that leads to expansive world building within digital primacy. A set of instructions.\n\nIts recursion is a direct result of its pliability through time. It’s non-static; it reflects and refracts the underlying technology. Each bag is a tool.\n\nThe rapid and frothy growth of Loot derivatives (and knock-offs) is confirmation of this. It shows the power of the idea: ”this is so stupid that I must spend my time mocking it;” “this allows us to build our own universes, how exciting;” “this will make me a lot of money.” It immediately (well, it took three days) became a bubble market. Most of these derivatives will go bust. The naysayers will celebrate. The devoted will continue building, sometimes in the wrong directions.\n\nBut as with the bubble of generative blockchain art, and the bubble of NFTs, and the (current) bubble of crypto, there remains a potent signal to which we should pay attention.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/161](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/161)\n\n", "timestamp": 1632225909, "digest": "mEoh4x8-1kDTsca-IhRIR9vygFI_vnNy0NHWTzYGF6U", "contributor": "0xa8A33539960Ef4779CB0eCEDed8002c1EcD40582"}
{"id": "FNR5Pd_rlKbqBVMbaoqfmGR006SSzeTQ-t5zjdbxbcM", "title": "Thoughts on trying to become a farmer during a pandemic and a country tearing itself apart", "body": "> “Shelf of a field, green, within easy reach, the grass on it not yet high, papered with blue sky through which yellow has grown to make pure green, the surface colour of what the basin of the world contains, attendant field, shelf between sky and sea, fronted with a curtain of printed trees, friable at its edges, the corners of it rounded, answering the sun with heat, shelf on a wall through which from time to time a cuckoo is audible, shelf on which she keeps the invisible and intangible jars of her pleasure, field that I have always known, I am lying raised up on one elbow wondering whether in any direction I can see beyond where you stop. The wire around you is the horizon.”\n>\n> From *Field*, by John Berger\n\nI’ve spent countless hours this year clearing land. The property where we live in New York was owned for about 30 years by a couple that rarely used it, and they long ago stopped mowing the fields that used to be cattle pasture. Trees have marched forward from the edges of the woods. Most of them are pines that grow a foot taller every year. Because we’re working to re-establish a farm on the property, a lot of these young pines have to go.\n\nClearing land is slow work when done alone with simple tools. Becoming comfortable and familiar with the chainsaw was easy enough; the thrilling part is when you see the trunk begin to lean away from you ever so slightly and then quickly snap with a gutteral creak. Very slowly and then all at once. The hard part is cleaning up: removing each small limb, moving them into a pile to burn or chip, then bucking the larger limbs into shorter pieces that can be piled into or dragged behind the pickup. The slowness of the cleaning is characterized by a certain zen. The removal of a living thing from the land, for something new to grow, is bittersweet.\n\nThere are a few chores that continue to feel like chores. Re-baiting the mousetraps is one. Unfolded laundry another. Maybe they’re the chores that are most familiar from the pre-farm days. Over time even the chainsaw, even the tractor, will sit unused, I guess.\n\nWe’d been seriously looking for a place to farm for about a year and a half before we ended up here. I’ve known for a long time that I wanted to live and raise children in a rural area, with a small local community. It’s not how I was raised, and it’s not how I have ever lived before a year ago. If I was forced to point to a moment early in life that set me on this trajectory, I could probably argue it was my time spent in IRC rooms and on small forums as an early teenager.\n\nFor anyone who lives in a city long enough, Nature becomes a place to go -- a public park on the way home from the subway; a state park 30 minutes away by car; a weeklong national park vacation. It’s a space safely entered and exited, supporting a subset of rare Human activities. Many of us acknowledge that it’s the home of Animals, and we generally agree the Animals deserve a home. Rarely is it appreciated for its entropic tendencies. Generally those tendencies are cast only in destructive terms.\n\nThis is not an essay about climate change. I’m not talking about the impending chaos of accelerating rates of hurricane formations. This is not about how Nature Is In Control (although I do believe that).\n\nRather, I’m interested in minimizing the boundaries between my (our) ordered human life and the messiness of the woods. I hesitate to push back those boundaries, even if it’s in service of developing a place that approaches a certain harmony between chaos and order. I get over this hesitation by walking around the property over and over, feeling how I move through it efficiently (when we need to find a path for the tractor or truck) or not (when we want a place that promotes wandering). Trying to imprint the contours of the land onto my body.\n\nBerger’s field is a field of activity, a theater. I first read the essay about 15 years ago. For most of my life since then, I saw the field as the entire space of concern, the zone that could impart meaning upon both spectator and participant. This seemed a useful and accurate metaphor. But now I understand the field is also a moment, and explicitly incomplete. It’s a pause. There are some creatures which leave the security of the woods, wander serenely through cleared land, and disappear again between trees. Some creatures leave the woods by mistake, and immediately turn back. The blackbirds spend most of their days out of the woods; “their coming and going remains quite unaffected by the trains.” For both Human and Animal, the field is an irregular interruption. But it might facilitate thoughtful reflection.\n\nNow I’m thinking about another Berger essay, *The Eaters and the Eaten*:\n\n> “The principal regular meal. For the peasant this meal is usually at midday; for the bourgeois it is usually dinner in the evening. The practical reasons for this are so obvious that they need not be listed. What may be significant is that the peasant meal is in the middle of the day, surrounded by work. It is placed in the day’s stomach. The bourgeois meal comes after the day’s work and marks the transition between day and evening. It is closer to the day’s head (if the day begins with getting to the feet) and to dreams.\n>\n> At the peasant’s table the relationship between implements, food and eaters is intimate, and a value is conferred on use and handling. Each person has his own knife which he may well take out of his pocket. The knife is worn, used for many purposes other than eating, and usefully sharp. Whenever possible the same plate is kept throughout the meal, and between dishes it is cleaned with bread which is eaten. Each eater takes his share of the food and drink which are placed before all. For example: he holds the bread to his body, cuts a piece of it towards himself, and puts the bread down for another. Likewise with cheese or sausage. Contiguity as between uses, users and foods is treated as natural. There is a minimum of division.\n>\n> On the bourgeois table everything that can be is kept untouched and separate. Every dish has its own cutlery and plate. In general plates are not cleaned by eating — because eating and cleaning are distinct activities. Each eater (or a servant) holds the serving dish to allow another to serve himself. The meal is a series of discrete, untouched gifts.\n>\n> To the peasant all food represents work accomplished. The work may or may not have been his own or that of his family, but if it isn’t, the work represented is nevertheless directly exchangeable with his own work. Because food represents physical work, the eater’s body already ‘knows’ the food it is going to eat. (The peasant’s strong resistance to eating any ‘foreign’ food for the first time is partly because its origin in the work process is unknown.) He does not expect to be surprised by food — except, sometimes, by its quality. His food is familiar like his own body. Its action on his body is *continuous* with the previous action of the body (labour) on the food. He eats in the room in which the food is prepared and cooked.”\n\nAnd here it’s only appropriate to recall the videos that have become so popular lately, of Afghani or Pakistani peasants eating western foods like pizza for the first time.\n\nIn more normal times, I’m working away from home at least a third of the year. The farm was always intended as a respite from this type of continuous movement around the world. I would be in New York, in Los Angeles, in Seoul, and then return to the woods. Two zones, with a clear delineation between them. This delineation now seems pretty absurd.\n\nI think often about the community I joined de facto in January 2020 and in earnest a month later, and what distinguishes it from all my previous time spent in cities. I’ve spent many months of my life driving throughout the country in search of similar data and have a few initial ideas. Urban environments are built on substantial decentralization and anonymization of services; this cultivates a mindset of a large, mostly-invisible controlling force that keeps everything running for everybody. *Eating and cleaning are distinct activities.* Life is made as predictable as possible to make sure it runs as smoothly as possible for the greatest number of participants. This framework also breaks most human-level community; people live primarily as individuals, knowing few of their neighbors, perhaps interacting hundreds of times with the same worker at the same business without ever learning each others’ name. There’s a certain predictable linearity to urbanized life.\n\nThis is inverted in rural areas, where services are often the responsibility of the individual (or the family), and a strong local community provides the foundation that enables people to live this way: by directly sharing equipment, food, childcare, skills. Life is inherently unpredictable, the future is uncertain, and mistakes are expected. Repairs are frequent. Good tools are invaluable. Most systems have a direct user-operator relationship by design, and those that aren’t (bureaucratic) are the source of endless complaints. The fire department is staffed by volunteers.\n\nRecently an acquaintance directed me towards Wendell Berry’s framework of exploitation and nurture, as discussed in his *Unsettling of America*:\n\n> “The standard of the exploiter is efficiency; the standard of the nurturer is care. The exploiter’s goal is money, profit; the nurturer’s goal is health—his land’s health, his own, his family’s, his community’s, his country’s. Whereas the exploiter asks of a piece of land only how much and how quickly it can be made to produce, the nurturer asks a question that is much more complex and difficult: What is its carrying capacity? \\[…\\] The competence of the exploiter is in organization; that of the nurturer is in order—a human order, that is, that accommodates itself both to other order and to mystery.”\n\nEarlier this afternoon I went to buy some parts for the tractor. One of the metal pins I needed was Made In India, and I momentarily felt a twang of unhappiness. In the past several years, and particularly this year, I've made a purposeful decision to buy products made in the United States as often as possible. I don't do this for nationalistic reasons, at least not directly. In general, I've found that Made In USA products are better-made and last longer, at least when it's an American brand, the same being true for Japanese brands made in Japan, or Italian in Italy -- localism generally implies highest possible quality. But I also prefer to buy these \"locally made\" goods because it means the motivations of the company are not pure profit; if that was the goal, they'd be exploiting workers in countries where worker protection laws are weaker and wages lower. This seems obvious maybe, but the higher quality of work must come in large part from the individual's higher quantity of pride in their work -- a skill developed as a result of nurturing at the individual level (through an apprenticeship, or through a long career at a single company) and at the group level (by implementing the Toyota Production System). The benefit of labor unions, for instance, is their ability to foster the conditions conducive to nurturing by creating friction between the company and the worker. They do not maximize for efficiency and exploitation.\n\nThere’s a connection here between pride taken in one’s work as a means to supporting one’s community -- a peasant mindset, Berger might say -- and why this pride disappears in urban environments. It’s not only because urban environments, and the culture around them, encourage capitalistic, bourgeois pursuits. It’s also because the very functional structure of urban environments cleaves the individual from their work. Their work goes out into the city and disappears. Their rewards are delivered from other sources, and often are provided by an easy access to credit. Ultimately, the rewards for work done, and the debts taken for rewards desired -- at the societal level -- are unevenly distributed throughout the entire system. History has shown where this leads.\n\nI can’t assert that all rural inhabitants retain the purity of the farmer’s mindset. Neither are all city creatures following their own social codes. Farhad Manjoo -- the NYTimes Op-Ed columnist (“lefties like myself who proudly believe in science and ostentatiously defer to expertise”) -- recently wrote, “I worry about life passing us by just as we’re trying to save it. If 2020 has taught me anything, it is to resist taking the future for granted.” This is the central talking point the right, and rural areas, have been articulating all year, and generally following -- returning to church, eating with friends, whatever. It’s also what the left has been communicating, through its actions, by going to the streets. All of this is about building up communities. At the root, all of this is about working through problems pragmatically. Of course, this is not how all of this is seen by each side.\n\nA top comment on the column, with which I also agree: “This discussion does not include the millions of people that don't have the privilege of isolating or communing in pods. The folks that keep the lights on, that sell us food and supplies, that deliver our heating fuel, mail and packages, the medical profession, expose themselves to risks everyday. We who can should isolate so that those who can't isolate have a safer environment when they go to work. Sure, Zoom is a poor substitute for in-person visits, but it makes little sense to travel during these few weeks if you don't need to.”\n\nAs with all things, neither of the extremes is workable, at any level. The individual must, and does, make decisions about what to exploit and what to nurture. The community makes the same decisions.\n\nI look forward to keeping a part of my mind with the entropy of the woods when I find myself on the road again, drinking coffee in the brightness of an airport, the air above me in a constant state of rapidly recirculating disinfection.\n\nOne of the recurring motifs of this year, here at the homestead, is friends visiting from the city and willfully taking on manual labor. One stayed a week and chopped firewood every day. Another helped lay out the deer fencing. Others dug holes, moved rocks, pulled nails. All do this with hardly any invitation, let alone prodding. At the end of their visit, they seem calmer. The zen of the wheelbarrow.\n\n*This essay was originally published on January 13, 2021 on usually.world.*\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=295](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=295)\n\n", "timestamp": 1632228436, "digest": "DB9Rycc-AQvi1CkSpGSKnNt2S3xZLNxakQrZCt8Fyw8", "contributor": "0xa8A33539960Ef4779CB0eCEDed8002c1EcD40582"}

Sometimes the coil is more compressed.\n\n[https://twitter.com/0ddette/status/1376008296415559680](https://twitter.com/0ddette/status/1376008296415559680)\n\nMy undergrad photography program, like most liberal art programs, was built on a structure emphasizing fundamentals as a first step along a path of cumulative experimentation–in intellectual development, in visual style, and in tools used. The cornerstone was analog: shooting black and white 35mm film, developing the negatives yourself, and making prints in the darkroom. Later years had time devoted to large format view cameras, lighting, studio setups–all the stuff that’s been around for 50-100 years–and, of course, digital capture, editing, and printing.\n\nIn my last two years at school a department-wide debate emerged: whether to still require incoming freshmen to learn the wet darkroom or let them go directly digital. For a lot of younger students it made no sense to grok a skill and set of equipment they didn’t want to use. For a lot of older students it made no sense to experiment at the cutting edge without appreciation for the art’s history. Faculty, who practiced in a wide range of media, seemed caught in the middle.\n\nWorking in color captured these questions well. It isn’t practical (or really even possible) for someone to develop color film themselves, so shooting color means taking it to an outside lab as a first step; already once removed from the artist’s hands. Chromogenic prints cannot be made in the same type of wet darkroom as gelatin silver prints since no visible spectrum of light is safe to use with the paper, so they’re exposed in total darkness (in small individual darkrooms), and developed by a machine the size of a truck that’s accessed through a closet (at Tisch ours was a Colenta and probably cost $350,000 when new, in the 1990s). No hands in trays of chemicals, no fighting over control of the stereo. The complexity and relative absurdity of the process–working in complete darkness at each step, going in and out of different tiny rooms–in fact makes it far more esoteric than black and white printing, which can be done by almost anyone in almost any dark space with a few buckets and a red light bulb. But at one time, it was the vanguard. While I was in school, it was still the dominant method of printing color, and what you saw most often on gallery walls in Chelsea.\n\nMy thesis exhibition (in 2009) was entirely chromogenic prints, and if I remember correctly about a third of my classmates did the same. Within two years, the program’s head technician emailed me saying I could have the Colenta if I would get it out of the building.\n\n[https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1369237479317004289](https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1369237479317004289)\n\nEthereum opened a new space and provides an opportunity for artists to work with a previously unknown medium. This is exciting to the point of mania-inducing, which is what makes it feel simultaneously hopeful and dangerous. It’s also what creates a financial bubble, which for the obvious reasons is dramatically exacerbated in the case of NFTs. Worst of all, it’s what often pushes aside the most interesting work being done, work which is trying to understand what the technology unlocks–what it enables in itself–separate from how it can merely transport an existing object (say, a JPEG) into a different realm (say, a hyperfinancial one). I’m talking about the work that literally cannot exist without the specific tool.\n\nAn excellent example of this is Robin Sloan’s [Amulets](https://text.bargains/) project.\n\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/815](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/815)\n\nAn amulet results from the appearance of sequential 8’s in the sha256 hash of a short piece of text; it cannot exist separate from the sha256 hash function (which is integral, but not unique, to Ethereum). The quantity of 8’s determines the amulet’s rarity (as established by the artist). The full definition and set of rules are very worth reading. It’s a nice game. It’s hard to imagine anyone paying a lot of money for these.\n\n[Framergence](https://framergence.art/) is particularly interesting because the creative mechanism is tied explicitly to Ethereum, in that the set of tokens that exists can be modified in real time on-chain by the owners. Each piece is algorithmically generated based on fractal patterns; the contract also rewards token burning by re-minting an n-1 amount of new tokens. This has led to people purchasing examples they intend to burn in the hunt for more pleasing iterations.\n\n![](https://content.framergence.art/3023962126_hires.png)\n\nEzra Miller’s [Solvency](https://solvency.art), a personal favorite, is not only technically accomplished, with the assets stored entirely on Ethereum and Arweave, but the individual mints are also beautiful, aesthetically complex and varied, yet still cohesive as a body of work. Their infinite runtime is the kicker (I highly recommend viewing the full WebGL renders on a laptop or desktop machine).\n\n[https://solvency.s3.amazonaws.com/444-1619141967765.mp4](https://solvency.s3.amazonaws.com/444-1619141967765.mp4)\n\nThese examples demonstrate the positive feedback loop that emerges from strong artist-tool relationships and leads to canonical outcomes. In the best cases it is indistinguishable from collaboration. I would go further and say that the strongest relationships depend on high friction environments. In these cases, the tools are new. They’re difficult to understand and often expensive to use. There’s a lot of trial and error. Much of the work has to be done “by hand,” and it’s slow going. The audience doesn’t have good references to understand the output; there’s probably very little criticism to place it in a historical context. The conditions are conducive to failure rather than success. And this leads to a lot of “failures.” Outside the small ecosystem of devoted creators and users, the work that employs the most experimental elements of a new technological space tends to be misunderstood, undervalued, and in many cases lost entirely.\n\nThe same dynamic (with the opposite effect on market price) can apply to esoteric and “outdated” tools and processes that nonetheless are preserved by devoted practicians. It was no surprise that [the best paper maker in Japan](https://www.washiya.com/shop/iwanohousho/kodawarienglish.html) had custom-designed all of his equipment, worked without the use of any bleach or other additives, and had not changed the process first established by his family 8 generations prior. Of course, his output is 1/100th of what a modernized paper maker can achieve, let alone a factory.\n\nWhat constitutes high friction (and low friction) is an ever-moving target and always relative. In 2007 digital photography was high friction (to achieve comparable results to analog, or to embrace the unique aesthetics of pixels), analog low friction. That has since inverted. Today, shooting 4K video on your phone feels easy; it will eventually feel cumbersome when most people have contact lens wearables, or something equally absurd-sounding.\n\n[https://twitter.com/etheria_feed/status/1370825688647884802](https://twitter.com/etheria_feed/status/1370825688647884802)\n\n[https://twitter.com/samspike/status/1439030208640823305?s=20](https://twitter.com/samspike/status/1439030208640823305?s=20)\n\nI originally began this essay in March. Etheria has since been resuscitated; NFT archeology in the search of yield is an active pursuit. Generative art is now rampant with derivatives. Copies of copies of copies. As with everything, the financial mechanisms of crypto allow–if not require–this speedrunning. Thus, we are already in a transient period of low friction and increasing mania. We’re surrounded by work that deploys the technology as an inherent component, but is otherwise artistically unremarkable. Its newness nonetheless commands enormous value. This, too, can cause artists’ work to be overlooked. Launch a series on Art Blocks and you tap into an automatic market of collectors and liquidity. Launch the same series on your own site and you may be lucky to sell a handful (probably not in this market, but you know what I mean). This problem isn’t unique to NFTs; the same dynamic is built into the structures of the legacy art world. Indeed the same dynamic emerges any time a certain technology (and its associated market) becomes frictionless enough.\n\nIt’s a failure both when a technology is used as a non-tool acceleration vehicle, and when it’s worshipped as a self-solving perpetual motion machine. During a bubble the technology exhibits both properties. Everybody rushes in because it’s a money printer, and many of those involved begin to see it as a Rosetta stone device. Irrational exuberance. Soon after the bubble pops because it’s discovered that the tools are insufficient for the narrative they sell.\n\nA similar mistake can be made with tools and their characteristics of nostalgia. This was at the heart of the debate at Tisch. Many saw digital photography as a fad, a shortcut, and aesthetically insufficient (“It’s a lower resolution than film, what’s the point?”). Thus black and white wet darkroom printing *had* to be learned; when the current iteration of digital technology was no longer in use, the artist would still have the through-line to grasp. A safety net, and therefore superior.\n\nThis is the common misconception of any new technology: riskier, less reliable, less future-proof. Because it’s iterating so quickly, it’s impermanent whenever and wherever it’s measured. It appears fleeting because most of it is fleeting. But that’s measuring the products of a tool; it’s not taking stock of the tool itself, on its inherent conceptual terms. Certain foundational components attain extreme Lindy status, while many cutting-edge experiments are ultimately relegated to history after leapfrogging each other during the rapid expansion phase. Here’s where we start arguing about Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nOf course, even gelatin silver prints, the most Lindy form of photography in history, are becoming harder to make and more homogenized–the number of companies still producing the necessary materials (film, paper, chemicals) and equipment (enlargers, cameras) has shrunk dramatically, a process that began well before digital photography became superior (the market re-prices according to future developments, not current realities). For the few photographers still working in black and white wet darkrooms, they’ve had to further hone their craft. But most have moved on to digital.\n\nDeafBeef [understands this well](https://jpg.mirror.xyz/qSUps1Krz02iyW8FCWHiEcHGaLrslw6BSldJQpuD9_A):\n\n> Your old smartphone is junk. On the other hand, an analog signal processor can be repaired, repurposed, and scavenged for parts. Oscilloscopes remain useful tools for electrical engineers. Vinyl and magnetic tape recordings from the 60s can still be played. ASCII terminal screens, for those who know how to use them, remain the most efficient way to interact with a computer for many tasks.\n\nEventually, the old smartphone will also be a field to harvest. And it turns out that inkjet prints are actually more stable and conservation-friendly than chromogenic prints; they also don’t require the use of harsh chemicals. Thus the point is not necessarily to be faithful to a specific tool, but to a certain intellectual approach, which is reliant on an appreciation for and handiness with a certain set of tools, and an ability to recognize which tools hold the most potency for honing and distilling.\n\n![David Rudnick's EXODUS 2, VII – Jagged Quartz Towers](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kQVIyPwG9JQfTpg54kLmQ.png?height=996&width=1016)\n\nI’m reminded now of [David Rudnick](https://exodus-ii.folia.app/)’s rhetorical device of [primacy](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/primacism-david-rudnick-on-the-struggle-for-primacy-type-and-poetrys-unique-value-in-an-age-of-digital-and-physical-conflict-and-percy-shelleys-mont-blanc)–Physical Prime vs. Digital Prime. We’re rapidly approaching the event horizon of digital primacy, the point at which we will spend more of our time in digital spaces rather than physical ones. The exponential deployment of digital objects as totemic and memetic devices is testament to this. These totems help us form narratives, and their appearance (in absolute numbers, in iterative qualities, in variability of aesthetics) has a direct relationship to our distance from the threshold.\n\nA major risk is in not recognizing the threshold; the result is a digital-prime world built with tools we can’t understand, illustrating myths that only abstract our social relationship to them. It inflates a bubble. Life feels easy. But we’re really in limbo.\n\n[Dean Kissick](https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/08/rediscovering-desire-in-a-panopticon-of-virtual-pleasures/) writes of a similar problem between cultural output and friction:\n\n> Much of culture now has the hollow, vacant feeling of having been made by algorithm. Consider the drab, broken anti-spectacle of Addison Rae performing trending TikTok dances onstage with Jimmy Kimmel or NFTs sold for millions at Christie’s and Sotheby’s—it’s art and pop stripped of all verve, fertility, and eroticism. What’s left is the new aesthetic of lifelessness and void, a consumer culture of throwaway experiences that wash right over you like an Ambien. It’s made to be experienced without friction: seamless post-death entertainment from an empire ruled over by a sleepy, old man. “Avoiding friction,” the critic Rob Horning has noted, “becomes a kind of content in itself—‘readable books’; ‘listenable music’; ‘vibes’; ‘ambience,’ etc.” And this is in keeping with a generational preference for light demi-pleasures: bumps not lines; microdosing, not getting high; sugary milks made of oats; podcasts, not conversation; the simulated intimacy of ASMR. Each of life’s pleasures in small amounts.\n\nRecognizing the threshold is particularly important for artists. They *must* grok the requisite tools and use them to shape the narrative surrounding the technological shift. They must sustain a high friction environment both as creators and for their audience. They must shock.\n\nHigh tool fluency, up and down the spiral (closer to and further from the threshold), is necessary. One must know one’s history, and then push forward. Otherwise the response to an algorithmic existence itself is honed by algorithm, so as not to be too disruptive; to sell.\n\nPart of what makes this urgent is the constant stream of legacy systems busting rivets left and right.\n\n![Maxar Technologies / Associated Press](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U5ZAAeuSz80_c1zJhXEPy.jpg?height=667&width=1200)\n\nThe ship as totem: a menacing combination of high meme content, an esoteric community, and structural fragility.\n\nThe physical prime world is literally breaking as it optimizes for digital prime users. Its systems are consolidating in the name of efficiency and introducing centralized weaknesses that halt entire networks. Its tools are opaque, if not entirely unknown, to its supposed beneficiaries. It is completely mispriced.\n\nIt’s easy to see this as a sign that all things analog are destined for obsolescence. There are many in the NFT realm who seem to think–or at least proclaim loudly, to sustain a trade–there’s no going back; a switch has flipped, we’ve discovered a new set of tools that are better in every way, and a panacea is upon us. That there’s a direct relationship between one’s financial exposure to said tools and one’s insistence on their panacean qualities is no surprise. It should be obvious that this binary relationship between past and future is wrong, but to extrapolate a bit: culture doesn’t lurch forward in a series of discrete steps. Generative art is not new. We might think of Sol Lewitt’s [Wall Drawings](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/) as generative artworks (Mitchell F Chan [certainly does](https://artblocks.io/project/118)), or [Marina Abramovic](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/abramovic-rhythm-0-t14875), or [Bruce Nauman](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/bruce-nauman-body-pressure), or [Lawrence Weiner](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/137437)… The Louvre predates photography and will still exist long after NFTs are outdated. A museum is a tool–a piece of infrastructure so implicit to society that it will both adapt to and force the adaptation of new aesthetics, new concepts, new media. If NFTs are successful as an artistic medium it will be because they expand culture, not fork it.\n\nIt seems to me that the turbulence of our time is a result of not allowing ourselves to cleave our digital selves from the physical and thus nurture both. We insist on bringing the algorithmic efficiency of digital primacy to bear on everything we do, eat, say, build.\n\nA dramatic inversion is necessary, and this brings me to [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/).\n\n![Bag #2957](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OmhyiqFNr7onQZr4j0xXz.png?height=2270&width=2270)\n\nLoot has been discussed mostly as a game primitive, but I think this is too simple. Loot is a generative artwork: a set of variables spawning artistic outputs off chain. Each bag is a recursive digital-prime totem, a memetic device that leads to expansive world building within digital primacy. A set of instructions.\n\nIts recursion is a direct result of its pliability through time. It’s non-static; it reflects and refracts the underlying technology. Each bag is a tool.\n\nThe rapid and frothy growth of Loot derivatives (and knock-offs) is confirmation of this. It shows the power of the idea: ”this is so stupid that I must spend my time mocking it;” “this allows us to build our own universes, how exciting;” “this will make me a lot of money.” It immediately (well, it took three days) became a bubble market. Most of these derivatives will go bust. The naysayers will celebrate. The devoted will continue building, sometimes in the wrong directions.\n\nBut as with the bubble of generative blockchain art, and the bubble of NFTs, and the (current) bubble of crypto, there remains a potent signal to which we should pay attention.\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/161](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/161)\n\n", "timestamp": 1632235166, "digest": "mEoh4x8-1kDTsca-IhRIR9vygFI_vnNy0NHWTzYGF6U", "contributor": "0xa8A33539960Ef4779CB0eCEDed8002c1EcD40582"}

Sometimes the coil is more compressed.\n\n[https://twitter.com/0ddette/status/1376008296415559680](https://twitter.com/0ddette/status/1376008296415559680)\n\nMy undergrad photography program, like most liberal art programs, was built on a structure emphasizing fundamentals as a first step along a path of cumulative experimentation–in intellectual development, in visual style, and in tools used. The cornerstone was analog: shooting black and white 35mm film, developing the negatives yourself, and making prints in the darkroom. Later years had time devoted to large format view cameras, lighting, studio setups–all the stuff that’s been around for 50-100 years–and, of course, digital capture, editing, and printing.\n\nIn my last two years at school a department-wide debate emerged: whether to still require incoming freshmen to learn the wet darkroom or let them go directly digital. For a lot of younger students it made no sense to grok a skill and set of equipment they didn’t want to use. For a lot of older students it made no sense to experiment at the cutting edge without appreciation for the art’s history. Faculty, who practiced in a wide range of media, seemed caught in the middle.\n\nWorking in color captured these questions well. It isn’t practical (or really even possible) for someone to develop color film themselves, so shooting color means taking it to an outside lab as a first step; already once removed from the artist’s hands. Chromogenic prints cannot be made in the same type of wet darkroom as gelatin silver prints since no visible spectrum of light is safe to use with the paper, so they’re exposed in total darkness (in small individual darkrooms), and developed by a machine the size of a truck that’s accessed through a closet (at Tisch ours was a Colenta and probably cost $350,000 when new, in the 1990s). No hands in trays of chemicals, no fighting over control of the stereo. The complexity and relative absurdity of the process–working in complete darkness at each step, going in and out of different tiny rooms–in fact makes it far more esoteric than black and white printing, which can be done by almost anyone in almost any dark space with a few buckets and a red light bulb. But at one time, it was the vanguard. While I was in school, it was still the dominant method of printing color, and what you saw most often on gallery walls in Chelsea.\n\nMy thesis exhibition (in 2009) was entirely chromogenic prints, and if I remember correctly about a third of my classmates did the same. Within two years, the program’s head technician emailed me saying I could have the Colenta if I would get it out of the building.\n\n[https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1369237479317004289](https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1369237479317004289)\n\nEthereum opened a new space and provides an opportunity for artists to work with a previously unknown medium. This is exciting to the point of mania-inducing, which is what makes it feel simultaneously hopeful and dangerous. It’s also what creates a financial bubble, which for the obvious reasons is dramatically exacerbated in the case of NFTs. Worst of all, it’s what often pushes aside the most interesting work being done, work which is trying to understand what the technology unlocks–what it enables in itself–separate from how it can merely transport an existing object (say, a JPEG) into a different realm (say, a hyperfinancial one). I’m talking about the work that literally cannot exist without the specific tool.\n\nAn excellent example of this is Robin Sloan’s [Amulets](https://text.bargains/) project.\n\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/815](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/815)\n\nAn amulet results from the appearance of sequential 8’s in the sha256 hash of a short piece of text; it cannot exist separate from the sha256 hash function (which is integral, but not unique, to Ethereum). The quantity of 8’s determines the amulet’s rarity (as established by the artist). The full definition and set of rules are very worth reading. It’s a nice game. It’s hard to imagine anyone paying a lot of money for these.\n\n[Framergence](https://framergence.art/) is particularly interesting because the creative mechanism is tied explicitly to Ethereum, in that the set of tokens that exists can be modified in real time on-chain by the owners. Each piece is algorithmically generated based on fractal patterns; the contract also rewards token burning by re-minting an n-1 amount of new tokens. This has led to people purchasing examples they intend to burn in the hunt for more pleasing iterations.\n\n![](https://content.framergence.art/3023962126_hires.png)\n\nEzra Miller’s [Solvency](https://solvency.art), a personal favorite, is not only technically accomplished, with the assets stored entirely on Ethereum and Arweave, but the individual mints are also beautiful, aesthetically complex and varied, yet still cohesive as a body of work. Their infinite runtime is the kicker.\n\n[https://solvency.s3.amazonaws.com/444-1619141967765.mp4](https://solvency.s3.amazonaws.com/444-1619141967765.mp4)\n\nThese examples demonstrate the positive feedback loop that emerges from strong artist-tool relationships and leads to canonical outcomes. In the best cases it is indistinguishable from collaboration. I would go further and say that the strongest relationships depend on high friction environments. In these cases, the tools are new. They’re difficult to understand and often expensive to use. There’s a lot of trial and error. Much of the work has to be done “by hand,” and it’s slow going. The audience doesn’t have good references to understand the output; there’s probably very little criticism to place it in a historical context.

For example, the early web was mostly digital adaptations of pre-internet activities like letter writing and mail-order shopping. Websites back then were mostly read only.\n\n4/ It took about a decade for technologists to start seriously exploring the idea that websites could be read/write, where users generate the content. This led to the growth of web native categories like social networking, crowdfunding, and social productivity apps.\n\n5/ This pattern is repeating itself with crypto/Web 3. There are some great native Web 3 products, but overall we are still in the skeuomorphic era. Many Web 3 products are adaptations from older domains.\n\n6/ Popular skeuomorphic Web 3 ideas include offline ticketing, supply chain management, and record keeping for offline assets. These may be good ideas, just as read-only websites were a good idea, but they only scratch the surface of what Web 3 can be.\n\n7/ A lot of today’s NFTs are adaptations from the offline world of art and collectibles. This leads people to think that NFTs are limited to those domains, in the same way people once thought the web was limited to brochures and magazines.\n\n8/ Tokens—fungibles and NFTs— are better thought of as new digital primitives, similar in flexibility and generality to past digital primitives like the website.\n\n9/ Tokens give users property rights: the ability to own a piece of the internet.\n\n10/ Web 2 left out digital property rights. When you use a site (or app), it would only let you borrow or rent things. Imagine if in the real world you had to buy everything from scratch every time you went to a new place. That’s Web 2.\n\n11/ Like websites, tokens are digital primitives that can be generalized to represent almost anything-- money, art, photo, music, text, code, game items, control, access, and whatever people dream up in the future.\n\n12/ Users can now have a persistent inventory of objects in their wallet that they take from one app to another. If their objects increase in value, the user gets the upside. This is a big change from Web 2 where the upside was mostly captured by tech companies.\n\n13/ We are still very much in the skeuomorphic era of Web 3, but are starting to see a new wave of native applications that have no prior analogue and simply couldn’t have existed before.\n\n14/ For example, building on mechanism designs pioneered by DeFi entrepreneurs, a new wave of DAOs are exploring ways for groups to come together, pool resources, build things, and self-govern.\n\n15/ Composable NFT games like Loot incentivize the community to build an entire world around a single set of NFTs— an activity that would be impossible without the ownership and portability that Web 3 enables.\n\n16/ There is nothing intrinsic about fungible tokens that needs to be related to money and finance, and nothing intrinsic about NFTs that needs to be related to art and collectibles.\n\n17/ Those are great initial applications, and will likely remain very important, but tokens are better thought of as a new digital primitive, analogous to the website— the atomic unit around which a new era of the internet is organized.", "timestamp": 1632236321, "digest": "0veLm9KKWae4T6_H3siLpKF933NSdC3F75jhPQw_qWE", "contributor": "0xe11BFCBDd43745d4Aa6f4f18E24aD24f4623af04"}

The higher the take rate, the more vulnerable the incumbent.\n\n6/ The video games industry does about $120B/year in sales, a significant portion of which is virtual goods. Most video games have 100% take rates.\n\n7/ Web 3 (aka crypto) games reduce the take rate dramatically. For example, Axie Infinity has generated over $1B in gross sales in the past year, most of which has gone back to users.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1422772933680762887](https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1422772933680762887)\n\n8/ In most video games, some people pay to get ahead and other people work to get ahead.

{"id": "pamk3YI35rwPlgd6ZKB-bTGOVm5Uxpzq028OWLLjqFA", "title": "Turning networks into economies", "body": "1/ Topic: Turning networks into economies 🧵\n\n2/ We spent the last 20 years building networks on the internet. Social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Discord are networks, which can be divided into billions of smaller networks, consisting of followers, friends, subscribers, backers, etc.\n\n3/ These platforms gave many people an audience who didn’t previously have one. But due to fundamental structural misalignments between the networks and the companies that own them, we’ve seen increasing tension around these networks’ rules and economics.\n\n4/ For example, social media companies that control large networks routinely kill off promising 3rd-party developers, fight cross-network interoperability, charge excessively high take rates, and adopt intrusive advertising models.\n\n5/ This is not due to bad people or motives. It’s the logic of the model. If you don’t do these things, your competitors will, and you’ll be out of business. I wrote more about this here:\n\n[https://cdixon.org/2018/02/18/why-decentralization-matters](https://cdixon.org/2018/02/18/why-decentralization-matters)\n\n6/ We are now entering a new era of the internet — Web 3 — where we have the chance to upgrade these networks into economies, and in the process build systems where the incentives of the network owners, network participants, and third-party developers are fully aligned.\n\n7/ Economies (as used here) are networks with various crypto assets freely flowing through them, from any node to any other node, directed by the decentralized participants and not by the centralized network owner.\n\n8/ Why crypto? You could theoretically have digital economies without crypto, but crypto guarantees genuine ownership of goods (NFTs) and money (tokens), thus lowering switching costs and preventing networks from playing Web 2 games like deprecating APIs and raising take rates.\n\n9/ When Web 2 networks allow for commerce, it is very limited, with centrally prescribed prices, products, and buyer-seller relationships. Because of user lock-in, Web 2 take rates are extremely high. I wrote more on this here:\n\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645842552086532](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645842552086532)\n\n10/ A true digital economy is like a real-world bazaar. Anyone can create new goods and services, and is free to trade with anyone else. People can fully express their creativity, and enjoy the economic upside of what they produce.\n\n11/ What might new economies built on top of existing networks look like? We can get a glimpse of the future by looking at emerging NFT communities. For example, the CryptoPunks economy flows across Discord, Twitter, Telegram, OpenSea, Larva Labs, etc.\n\n12/ In these communities, CryptoPunks are not “just jpegs.” They are cultural artifacts that derive value through the shared myths, memes, stories, and experiences of their surrounding communities. Punk 6526 explains it well here:\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1424127515476598796](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1424127515476598796)\n\n13/ Now take this and apply it to, say, a band who has spent years building a following but today gets only pennies from streaming services. Using tokens and NFTs, the band can upgrade their networks into an economy.\n\n14/ The goods that flow through the band’s economy might be social tokens, digital art, collectibles, tickets, game objects, exclusive experiences, or whatever else creators and technologists dream up (we are still early—there will be many more great ideas).\n\n15/ The band gets revenue from primary issuances and cuts of resale, and possibly by owning a chunk of fungible tokens, and is incentivized along with the community to make the economy as large as possible. If you have a good idea, you are welcome to contribute or build on top.\n\n16/ Economies will be composable, meaning new ones can be built on top of existing ones. Systems and services become like lego bricks, accelerating everyone’s progress. Like what another economy did? Don’t fight it. Build your own economy alongside it.\n\n17/ Economies that grow organically, bottom-up end up looking like cities. Economies owned by a single company with top-down control end up looking like theme parks. A single company can never match the creativity of a thriving ecosystem.\n\n18/ The internet started out with so much promise, but over the last decade got taken over by a handful of giant, unseemly theme parks. We can build great cities, with thriving economies, to replace them.

Here are a few common ways new technologies can be misunderstood.\n\n2/ “It’s just a toy.” This was the mistake made early on about breakthrough technologies like the telephone, personal computers, and social media.\n\n[https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy](https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy)\n\n3/ When the telephone was first invented, incumbents like Western Union dismissed it, as the sound quality was poor and it only worked at short distances. They failed to imagine how quickly those things would be improved.\n\n4/ Early on, blogs and services like Twitter were mostly used to discuss niche tech topics and share mundane personal details. A lot of people dismissed them as toys or passing fads. Today billions of people rely on social media as their primary news source.\n\n5/ Social media was a technology for creating global media networks that arrived disguised as a way to share what you had for lunch.\n\n6/ “It’s too expensive.” We hear this today about electric vehicles, space travel, virtual reality headsets, and more. Hardware almost always starts out expensive. Over time, the costs drop rapidly as manufacturing know-how and economies of scale kick in.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9zMfARzPGzCZkgFgCDawJ.jpg?height=837&width=1200)\n\n7/ In addition to getting cheaper, hardware gets better. A modern iPhone has over 12 billion transistors, roughly 3500 times more than a 1995 Pentium PC. Today over 80% of adults worldwide have internet-connected supercomputers, aka smartphones, in their pockets.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OY7cxtaPESz8lgYo_ysW-.jpg?height=586&width=1200)\n\n8/ Sequencing a human genome went from costing $100 million twenty years ago to under $1,000 today, making it broadly accessible. As Larry Page said: “Hardware prices eventually approach the cost of the commodity material inputs.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0BcUjNhlTB9YIAcbr-eAE.jpg?height=675&width=1200)\n\n9/ “What problem does it solve?” Many breakthrough technologies, especially those involving computers, don’t directly solve problems. Instead, they unlock new capabilities, which in turn enable users, developers, creators to solve problems.\n\n10/ Early on, personal computers were used mainly by enthusiasts to make games and hack around.

{"id": "qMYkmBA8KoHKS6YlL3c6KMQgukXtA1021_ESLvx4-1w", "title": "Turning networks into economies", "body": "1/ Topic: Turning networks into economies 🧵\n\n2/ We spent the last 20 years building networks on the internet. Social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Discord are networks, which can be divided into billions of smaller networks, consisting of followers, friends, subscribers, backers, etc.\n\n3/ These platforms gave many people an audience who didn’t previously have one. But due to fundamental structural misalignments between the networks and the companies that own them, we’ve seen increasing tension around these networks’ rules and economics.\n\n4/ For example, social media companies that control large networks routinely kill off promising 3rd-party developers, fight cross-network interoperability, charge excessively high take rates, and adopt intrusive advertising models.\n\n5/ This is not due to bad people or motives. It’s the logic of the model. If you don’t do these things, your competitors will, and you’ll be out of business. I wrote more about this here:\n\n[https://cdixon.org/2018/02/18/why-decentralization-matters](https://cdixon.org/2018/02/18/why-decentralization-matters)\n\n6/ We are now entering a new era of the internet — Web 3 — where we have the chance to upgrade these networks into economies, and in the process build systems where the incentives of the network owners, network participants, and third-party developers are fully aligned.\n\n7/ Economies (as used here) are networks with various crypto assets freely flowing through them, from any node to any other node, directed by the decentralized participants and not by the centralized network owner.\n\n8/ Why crypto? You could theoretically have digital economies without crypto, but crypto guarantees genuine ownership of goods (NFTs) and money (tokens), thus lowering switching costs and preventing networks from playing Web 2 games like deprecating APIs and raising take rates.\n\n9/ When Web 2 networks allow for commerce, it is very limited, with centrally prescribed prices, products, and buyer-seller relationships. Because of user lock-in, Web 2 take rates are extremely high. I wrote more on this here:\n\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645842552086532](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645842552086532)\n\n10/ A true digital economy is like a real-world bazaar. Anyone can create new goods and services, and is free to trade with anyone else. People can fully express their creativity, and enjoy the economic upside of what they produce.\n\n11/ What might new economies built on top of existing networks look like? We can get a glimpse of the future by looking at emerging NFT communities. For example, the CryptoPunks economy flows across Discord, Twitter, Telegram, OpenSea, Larva Labs, etc.\n\n12/ In these communities, CryptoPunks are not “just jpegs.” They are cultural artifacts that derive value through the shared myths, memes, stories, and experiences of their surrounding communities. Punk 6526 explains it well here:\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1424127515476598796](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1424127515476598796)\n\n13/ Now take this and apply it to, say, a band who has spent years building a following but today gets only pennies from streaming services. Using tokens and NFTs, the band can upgrade their networks into an economy.\n\n14/ The goods that flow through the band’s economy might be social tokens, digital art, collectibles, tickets, game objects, exclusive experiences, or whatever else creators and technologists dream up (we are still early—there will be many more great ideas).\n\n15/ The band gets revenue from primary issuances and cuts of resale, and possibly by owning a chunk of fungible tokens, and is incentivized along with the community to make the economy as large as possible. If you have a good idea, you are welcome to contribute or build on top.\n\n16/ Economies will be composable, meaning new ones can be built on top of existing ones. Systems and services become like lego bricks, accelerating everyone’s progress. Like what another economy did? Don’t fight it. Build your own economy alongside it.\n\n17/ Economies that grow organically, bottom-up end up looking like cities. Economies owned by a single company with top-down control end up looking like theme parks. A single company can never match the creativity of a thriving ecosystem.\n\n18/ The internet started out with so much promise, but over the last decade got taken over by a handful of giant, unseemly theme parks. We can build great cities, with thriving economies, to replace them. We have the tools, and the seeds have been planted.\n\n\\*\\*\n\n*Originally published 8/22/21 on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1429585831899983876?lang=en).*", "timestamp": 1632245185, "digest": "977Uy2b3ZWCNjVdHxeaNC2ecYOUS3VPgS2_PwVddiQ0", "contributor": "0xe11BFCBDd43745d4Aa6f4f18E24aD24f4623af04"}

{"id": "P1V7-hUoih2ugFP-tB8cKuB-MEOeB1cjdhttHWYFejQ", "title": "Tutorial: How to Send Funds Using Hop ", "body": "# What is Hop? 🐇\n\nHop is a scalable token bridge protocol for Ethereum’s layer-2 ecosystem. The protocol uses a special intermediary asset called an hToken to quickly move funds from one network to another. These hTokens are automatically swapped for their corresponding assets through the Hop Protocol interface, resulting in a rather seamless experience for transporting assets between networks. \n\nCurrently, Hop supports sending USDC, USDT, and MATIC across the Mainnet, Polygon, xDai, Optimisim, and Arbitrum networks. Hop also plans to add even more assets in the future, including ETH, WBTC, and DAI, making it an extremely versatile cross-chain solution to the increasingly fragmented world of layer 2s. \n\n# How to Send Funds Using Hop Tutorial 💱\n\nFor this tutorial, you will need:\n\n* A web3 wallet (e.g. Metamask)\n* USDC, USDT, or MATIC tokens you would like to transfer\n* The native gas payment token of the chain you are transferring from (e.g. MATIC if transferring from the Polygon network). \n  * **Note:** you will want to make sure you have the native gas token of the chain you are transferring to as well. For example, if you transfer USDC from Arbitrum to Optimism but don’t own any ETH on Optimism, you won’t be able to do anything with the USDC once it is there. It’s not necessary for the tutorial, but it’s still important to know. \n\nFirst, head to <https://hop.exchange/> and click ‘**Use Hop**’ in the center of the page. In the upper right corner you will see a button to connect your wallet. Go ahead and do so now. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RnkQZ592p9cIe8HTEewXi.png?height=198&width=1087)\n\nAt the time of writing, you can send USDC, USDT, and MATIC between Mainnet, Polygon, xDai, Optimism, and Arbitrum. Make sure you are on the ‘**Send**’ tab and click the dropdown next to Send to select which asset you would like to transfer. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/remrrXLiz6HtrcLxceo4t.png?height=206&width=719)\n\nThen, select the network and enter the amount in the ‘**From**’ and ‘**To**’ fields. \n\nIn the example below, I am sending 500 USDC from Polygon, and I will receive 495 USDC on Optimism after fees. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rcXS6VXu-SnXSYvykV1d5.png?height=549&width=371)\n\nAfter verifying the details, hit ‘Approve’ and confirm the transaction in your web3 wallet. This will provide Hop with the ability to spend your tokens. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F31sdA8gRTo7d-Na_lo7W.png?height=280&width=558)\n\nOnce approved, you’ll now be able to send your token between networks. Double check the estimated amount received after fees and click ‘**Send**’ if everything looks correct. \n\nConfirm ‘**Send**’ one more time and approve the transaction in your wallet. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sZ4ROfg2z1vMDT_v6HEtT.png?height=228&width=556)\n\nTransfer times vary depending on which networks you are transferring between. As a general rule of thumb, L1 to L2 transactions take the same amount of time as using the native bridge. From L2 to L1 or between L2 transactions will typically be completed in however many blocks it takes to be considered final on the sending chain. Here are some example times:\n\n**Deposits from L1**\n\n* Ethereum -> xDai: ∼5 minutes\n* Ethereum -> Polygon: ∼8 minutes\n\n**Withdrawals from xDai**\n\n* xDAI -> Ethereum: ∼2 minutes (12 blocks)\n* xDAI -> Polygon: ∼2 minutes (12 blocks)\n\n**Withdrawals from Polygon**\n\n* Polygon-> Ethereum: ∼4.5 minutes ( 124 blocks)\n* Polygon-> xDai: ∼4.5 minutes ( 124 blocks)\n\n## Congratulations! 🎈\n\nYou have now transferred assets between networks. Your funds will show up after a few minutes on the new network in whatever currency you sent (e.g. if you sent USDC from Polygon to Optimism, you will receive USDC on Optimism after a few minutes).\n\nLayer 2s, sidechains, and other scaling solutions will continue to be expanded in the near term, growing the Ethereum network beyond its present-day capabilities, but thankfully our multi-chain world does not need to be fractured. Instead, protocols like Hop will allow us to seamlessly move assets between chains without ever having to wait extended periods of time or hassle with bridging back down to Mainnet just to transfer between layer 2s. ", "timestamp": 1632254905, "digest": "1uuTNpX30dZG3X__D1CONWlcqCx_2nGG1FSfpSIU7LA", "contributor": "0xC714a62A4BF7ff475C8dc3E589e1388342A38BB8"}

On every issue, we feature one artist that we think is super cool.\n\nWhen I got the gig, I personally have a mission to feature various kinds of art styles or mediums. I, personally, don’t want to just see 3D renders forever looping as they move, something that I personally can’t create… *yet*. I do graphic design, so most of my works are text-heavy posters possibly mixed with stock photo or illustrations. I don’t illustrate. I don’t do 3D renders. I don’t see myself in the space (yet), and I don’t want others to feel the same.\n\n### What am I currently doing\n\nI place all the artists I feature on a spreadsheet, and what kind of art do they make as an NFT. I also check and write from which countries do these artists come from. Not only do I want to be the kinds of artworks being made into NFTs be diverse, but also the people that we feature.\n\nI am proud to say that I’ve featured artists from Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. These artists have covered fields like photography, dancing, graphic design, watercolor, illustrations, doodles, and more.\n\nTo see who I have featured on the newsletter, you may check out my collection on Yup.\n\n[https://app.yup.io/collections/cup-of-nft-featured-artists/T4FRpxn](https://app.yup.io/collections/cup-of-nft-featured-artists/T4FRpxn)\n\nYou may also scroll to the last part of this post to see their works.\n\n*Note: I have yet to check out the 18 issues sent before I entered the picture, and a couple more issues while I was already in Cup.*\n\n## Some things I’ve noticed or I reflected on\n\n### Types of Media\n\nI haven’t featured any music or video NFTs. For music, I think it will be just like sharing a song I like that I discovered on Spotify. For video, I’m looking for longer videos, not your usual 3D render loops or 10-second clips. JPEGs, PNGs, and GIFs had their spotlight for so long.\n\n### Platforms\n\nAll of the artists I’ve featured, I discovered through Foundation or Showtime. Just being able to follow people on the platform where you saw them is a great way for me to “bookmark” these artists.\n\nIt just happens to be a coincidence when we feature an artist that’s on H=N. It’s just not a platform that I check out. Although, thinking about it, I should… as well as with other marketplaces on different networks like Polygon, NEAR, and Flow. If I am in a position where I can possibly make an artist’s first sale through featuring them, I might as well do that for artists who have less capital.\n\n### What we can do better\n\nWith the various kinds of media and platforms to check out and feature, we must give more space for creators and not just limit it to one. Maybe we can start off with having one artist from various networks, or one from each kind of media (photo, video, music, graphics).\n\nFeaturing more artists may sound like an easy solution, but it isn’t if you’re just two people doing the newsletter with other parts to work on as well. I think that we should get more people to contribute, even if it’s just with the artist feature part, maybe representing a certain network or marketplace. But now, the problem is compensation.\n\nI personally am being paid for my contributions for the newsletter, and I don’t really mind not being paid. I’m working on other projects in the space and those are the ones paying the bills. Privilege checked, I am pretty aware that this isn’t the case for everyone.\n\nAs much as I want to feature more artists and get more people to contribute and provide a different perspective, we can’t sustain that when our newsletter is free.\n\nWe’ve had some donations through Gitcoin, and I’m guessing that some of the money that I’m being paid with came from that, but the donations we got can’t even sustain getting more people too.\n\n### Send help!\n\nWe’d love to know what you think about the newsletter! If you’re not subscribed to Cup of NFT, [why not try it out](https://cupofnft.com/)? And if you’ve been checking out the past issue, do give us some feedback!\n\nWe’re thinking of keeping the news part bulleted and not have a cover story, in exchange of featuring more artists. As a reader, do you want to see more artist features? Should we get rid of other parts in exchange of that? Should we consider doing an NFT crowdfund or a sponsorship NFT to generate revenue?

There should also be a financial reward for docking an E-Bike in a kiosk where there are no E-Bikes or very few.\n\nI got a ton of feedback via email and Twitter that Citibike already offers this via a program called [Bike Angels](https://www.citibikenyc.com/bike-angels) that rewards riders for doing things like this. I know about that program but there are three big problems with Bike Angels that Lyft, the owner of Citibike, needs to fix.\n\n1/ Bike Angels is not part of the core service, available to everyone by default.\n\n2/ The rewards are too small. They need to be increased significantly.\n\n3/ Angels is not a cash rewards program and you cannot take cash out of the system. It needs to be like Venmo.\n\nBasically Angels sucks, but it is directionally correct.\n\nIf Lyft fixed all of this and offered attractive cash rewards for moving bikes and E-bikes around the system, it would be a game changer. But Bike Angels is not that. It is not even close to that.\n", "timestamp": 1632309313, "digest": "FEGFJbiqW7fsoXYKobZqV88TLUw95S7z2x42SFVKJ1g", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}
{"id": "yYJcLKReiw9bWLBa7Zh8qB22eKuLhANv7v8IwjY9NbM", "title": "How to LP on SushiSwap (Polygon)", "body": "## What is SushiSwap? 🍣\n\n[SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending market on Ethereum. Unlike a centralized exchange, SushiSwap is non-custodial and trustless. It uses an automated market maker (AMM) model to facilitate peer-to-peer exchanges of any two ERC-20 tokens in real time.\n\nSushiSwap has quickly evolved into one of the most sophisticated token liquidity engines in decentralized finance (DeFi) by releasing innovative product offerings that stretch our conception of what a DEX is supposed to be. In addition to the steady flow of new features, SushiSwap has expanded across multiple blockchains, setting itself up to be an extremely versatile multi-chain DEX.\n\n## What is the Onsen menu (SushiSwap)? 🍣\n\n[SushiSwap Onsen](https://app.sushi.com/yield) hosts various DeFi protocols in their liquidity pools to attract users of these protocols to stake their native tokens as liquidity. The “menu” changes frequently and SUSHI tokens are distributed as liquidity mining rewards. The projects on the Onsen Menu typically have the best reward APY’s on the platform. \n\n## What is Polygon? 🌐\n\n[Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) is a protocol and framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. As many of us are aware, transacting on Ethereum can be costly to the average user when gas prices are high. Polygon offers fast and cheap transactions as a Layer 2 scalability solution to the Ethereum network, allowing users to experiment with DeFi without incurring substantial gas fees.\n\nSince its release, Polygon has seen a wave of DeFi protocols launch on the network, including Aave, Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and more.\n\n## LP on SushiSwap (Polygon) Tutorial 🎓\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walkthrough how to provide liquidity on SushiSwap (Polygon Network).\n\nWhat you will need: \n\n*     Metamask wallet\n*     MATIC tokens in your MATIC wallet for gas\n*    Two ERC-20 tokens to provide as liquidity on Sushiswap \n\n*\\*WARNING\\**\n\n*Providing liquidity is a great way to earn some income on tokens sitting in your wallet, but please be careful when providing liquidity. Sharp price increases or decreases can have a huge impact on the performance of your position.*\n\n### First, you’ll need to set up your MetaMask for Polygon.\n\n* Login to MetaMask on your browser and click on **‘Ethereum Mainnet’**.\n* From the dropdown, select **‘Custom RPC’**.\n* Enter the following information into the available fields:\n  * **Network Name:** Polygon\n  * **New RPC URL:** <https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/>\n  * **ChainID:** 137\n  * **Symbol:** MATIC\n  * **Block Explorer URL:** <https://polygonscan.com/>\n* Click ‘**Save**’.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e71eb069-fe67-4ed0-8a2c-65e2a3af36c7.png?height=500&width=340)\n\n### Next, bridge some assets from the Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon.\n\nYou can follow [this tutorial](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/wallets/matic-web-wallet/web-wallet-v2-guide/#depositing-funds-from-ethereum-to-matic) to bridge assets using the Matic Web Wallet, or you can follow the below steps to bridge your assets using Zapper.\n\n* Go to <https://zapper.fi/> and connect your MetaMask wallet.\n* Once connected, select **‘Bridge’** from the sidebar.\n* Switch your MetaMask network back to Ethereum Mainnet if it isn’t already by selecting **‘Ethereum Mainnet’** from the network dropdown (the list where you found **‘Custom RPC’** above).\n* Select the token you would like to transfer to Polygon and the token you would like to receive in exchange on Polygon from the dropdown menus. Then, enter the amount you would like to transfer.\n* Click **‘Confirm’** and approve the transaction in MetaMask.\n* Approximately 5-10 minutes following confirmation on Ethereum, your assets will arrive on Polygon. You can check this by switching back to the Polygon network in MetaMask and verifying the tokens are in your wallet (note: if you don't see your assets, try [adding the token to MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-add-unlisted-tokens-custom-tokens-in-MetaMask)).\n\n### Now that the housekeeping is out of the way, let's provide some liquidity! \n\n* Head over to <https://sushi.com/> and click the **‘Enter App’** button.\n* Connect your Metamask to SushiSwap by selecting **'Connect to a Wallet'** in the upper-right corner of the page.\n* Once your wallet is connected to SushiSwap, make sure your MetaMask is connected to the Polygon network. If properly connected, you will see ‘Polygon (Matic)’ in the upper right corner of the page.\n\n### Use the Sushiswap Onsen Menu to find the right pool to provide liquidity! \n\n* To find the best rewards on Sushiswap click “[Yield](https://app.sushi.com/yield)” at the top of the page to get to the Onsen Menu. \n* The Onsen menu will have the liquidity pools with the most attractive SUSHI rewards, and on MATIC they have created incentives for various pools which you can browse. \n* You will need to click the “Add Liquidity” to get to the interface for adding liquidity. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3f207605-209e-4960-8542-6008edb8e899.png?height=473&width=988)\n\n### Adding Liquidity!  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8a89b27a-46d4-4fc9-922a-8f4ea4703e10.png?height=842&width=758)\n\n* Using the Onsen menu you can select a token pair that you would like to provide liquidity to. Remember, you have to put an even proportion of each token into the pool (50/50) and you will typically have to approve each token before you can add liquidity. Luckily on the Polygon network this does not cost very much in gas.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/861aef1b-a3e5-4fe9-bb6f-5ec7de1ffa93.png?height=368&width=772)\n\n* Once you have added the liquidity, you will have Sushiswap Liquidity tokens (SLP) in your wallet that you can manage from the Sushiswap site and then proceed to stake those SLP tokens to start earning rewards.\n\n\n* After you have added liquidity, Sushiswap will give a readout of the token balances that indicate your share of the pool based on how many tokens you entered into the pool as shown below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7445c500-908f-412c-85e4-848271ff8320.png?height=125&width=779)\n\n### Stake SLP tokens to start earning SUSHI rewards! \n\n* Once you have the SLP tokens, you can then stake them to earn your SUSHI rewards by hitting the “Approve” button and then once it is approved the button will turn into a “Stake” button. Once it is staked, you will start earning rewards!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/72bb8701-480d-4ee3-8f88-c297c4aa2912.png?height=258&width=900)\n\n### Withdrawing Liquidity (if need be)! \n\n* Much like with Uniswap, when you withdraw your liquidity from the Sushiswap Matic pools you will get back a different number of each token than when you started.

{"id": "3941cu9yEBJFk3H7nG64hSHiGuo43zoIoUZe2f3_7mU", "title": "How to LP on SushiSwap (Polygon)", "body": "## What is SushiSwap? 🍣\n\n[SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending market on Ethereum. Unlike a centralized exchange, SushiSwap is non-custodial and trustless. It uses an automated market maker (AMM) model to facilitate peer-to-peer exchanges of any two ERC-20 tokens in real time.\n\nSushiSwap has quickly evolved into one of the most sophisticated token liquidity engines in decentralized finance (DeFi) by releasing innovative product offerings that stretch our conception of what a DEX is supposed to be. In addition to the steady flow of new features, SushiSwap has expanded across multiple blockchains, setting itself up to be an extremely versatile multi-chain DEX.\n\n## What is the Onsen menu (SushiSwap)? 🍣\n\n[SushiSwap Onsen](https://app.sushi.com/yield) hosts various DeFi protocols in their liquidity pools to attract users of these protocols to stake their native tokens as liquidity. The “menu” changes frequently and SUSHI tokens are distributed as liquidity mining rewards. The projects on the Onsen Menu typically have the best reward APY’s on the platform. \n\n## What is Polygon? 🌐\n\n[Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) is a protocol and framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. As many of us are aware, transacting on Ethereum can be costly to the average user when gas prices are high. Polygon offers fast and cheap transactions as a Layer 2 scalability solution to the Ethereum network, allowing users to experiment with DeFi without incurring substantial gas fees.\n\nSince its release, Polygon has seen a wave of DeFi protocols launch on the network, including Aave, Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and more.\n\n## LP on SushiSwap (Polygon) Tutorial 🎓\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walkthrough how to provide liquidity on SushiSwap (Polygon Network).\n\nWhat you will need: \n\n*     Metamask wallet\n*     MATIC tokens in your MATIC wallet for gas\n*    Two ERC-20 tokens to provide as liquidity on Sushiswap \n\n*\\*WARNING\\**\n\n*Providing liquidity is a great way to earn some income on tokens sitting in your wallet, but please be careful when providing liquidity. Sharp price increases or decreases can have a huge impact on the performance of your position.*\n\n### First, you’ll need to set up your MetaMask for Polygon.\n\n* Login to MetaMask on your browser and click on **‘Ethereum Mainnet’**.\n* From the dropdown, select **‘Custom RPC’**.\n* Enter the following information into the available fields:\n  * **Network Name:** Polygon\n  * **New RPC URL:** <https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/>\n  * **ChainID:** 137\n  * **Symbol:** MATIC\n  * **Block Explorer URL:** <https://polygonscan.com/>\n* Click ‘**Save**’.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e71eb069-fe67-4ed0-8a2c-65e2a3af36c7.png?height=500&width=340)\n\n### Next, bridge some assets from the Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon.\n\nYou can follow [this tutorial](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/wallets/matic-web-wallet/web-wallet-v2-guide/#depositing-funds-from-ethereum-to-matic) to bridge assets using the Matic Web Wallet, or you can follow the below steps to bridge your assets using Zapper.\n\n* Go to <https://zapper.fi/> and connect your MetaMask wallet.\n* Once connected, select **‘Bridge’** from the sidebar.\n* Switch your MetaMask network back to Ethereum Mainnet if it isn’t already by selecting **‘Ethereum Mainnet’** from the network dropdown (the list where you found **‘Custom RPC’** above).\n* Select the token you would like to transfer to Polygon and the token you would like to receive in exchange on Polygon from the dropdown menus. Then, enter the amount you would like to transfer.\n* Click **‘Confirm’** and approve the transaction in MetaMask.\n* Approximately 5-10 minutes following confirmation on Ethereum, your assets will arrive on Polygon. You can check this by switching back to the Polygon network in MetaMask and verifying the tokens are in your wallet (note: if you don't see your assets, try [adding the token to MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-add-unlisted-tokens-custom-tokens-in-MetaMask)).\n\n### Now that the housekeeping is out of the way, let's provide some liquidity! \n\n* Head over to <https://sushi.com/> and click the **‘Enter App’** button.\n* Connect your Metamask to SushiSwap by selecting **'Connect to a Wallet'** in the upper-right corner of the page.\n* Once your wallet is connected to SushiSwap, make sure your MetaMask is connected to the Polygon network. If properly connected, you will see ‘Polygon (Matic)’ in the upper right corner of the page.\n\n### Use the Sushiswap Onsen Menu to find the right pool to provide liquidity! \n\n* To find the best rewards on Sushiswap click “[Yield](https://app.sushi.com/yield)” at the top of the page to get to the Onsen Menu. \n* The Onsen menu will have the liquidity pools with the most attractive SUSHI rewards, and on MATIC they have created incentives for various pools which you can browse. \n* You will need to click the “Add Liquidity” to get to the interface for adding liquidity. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3f207605-209e-4960-8542-6008edb8e899.png?height=473&width=988)\n\n### Adding Liquidity!  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8a89b27a-46d4-4fc9-922a-8f4ea4703e10.png?height=842&width=758)\n\n* Using the Onsen menu you can select a token pair that you would like to provide liquidity to. Remember, you have to put an even proportion of each token into the pool (50/50) and you will typically have to approve each token before you can add liquidity. Luckily on the Polygon network this does not cost very much in gas.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/861aef1b-a3e5-4fe9-bb6f-5ec7de1ffa93.png?height=368&width=772)\n\n* Once you have added the liquidity, you will have Sushiswap Liquidity tokens (SLP) in your wallet that you can manage from the Sushiswap site and then proceed to stake those SLP tokens to start earning rewards.\n\n\n* After you have added liquidity, Sushiswap will give a readout of the token balances that indicate your share of the pool based on how many tokens you entered into the pool as shown below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7445c500-908f-412c-85e4-848271ff8320.png?height=125&width=779)\n\n### Stake SLP tokens to start earning SUSHI rewards! \n\n* Once you have the SLP tokens, you can then stake them to earn your SUSHI rewards by hitting the “Approve” button and then once it is approved the button will turn into a “Stake” button. Once it is staked, you will start earning rewards!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/72bb8701-480d-4ee3-8f88-c297c4aa2912.png?height=258&width=900)\n\n### Withdrawing Liquidity (if need be)! \n\n* Much like with Uniswap, when you withdraw your liquidity from the Sushiswap Matic pools you will get back a different number of each token than when you started. That is due to the automatic rebalancing that is a core feature of automated market makers (AMM’s).\n* To withdraw your liquidity from Sushiswap, you must first unstake the SLP tokens if you had them staked and earning rewards. Once they are unstaked you can hit the “Remove Liquidity” and your SLP tokens will be converted back into the two tokens you initially entered into the pool.\n\n### Congratulations! 🥳\n\nYou are now an LP on SushiSwap (Polygon)!\n\nIf you have any questions about this guide, feel free to reach out to me directly on Twitter @keirsim - happy questing! :) ", "timestamp": 1631162181, "digest": "rrUgAhyMEakuerNyb9A79cOTzRKUDFNPMHYeFx1ihr4", "contributor": "0x7310E238f2260ff111a941059B023B3eBCF2D54e"}
