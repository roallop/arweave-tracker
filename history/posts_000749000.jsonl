In April, they decided to offer a bundled version of their newsletters, expecting a few extra subscribers from the experiment. Instead, they grew together from [600 to 1,000 paying subscribers](https://digiday.com/media/how-substack-has-spawned-a-new-class-of-newsletter-entrepreneurs/) within the first month. With all this talk of *unbundling* (some examples are the unbundlings of [college](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1232193193606729728?s=20), [G Suite](https://foundationinc.co/lab/unbundling-gsuite), [Reddit](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit?utm_source=angellist), and [venture capital](https://medium.com/@marvinliao/the-slow-steady-unbundling-aka-democratization-of-venture-capital-9dcdede874af)), Nathan and Dan’s intentional *bundling* proved to be a striking success.\n\nThe Everything Bundle case study is one of my favorites, but it’s not the only one, by any means. [Channels Stack](https://www.channelsstack.com/) is a curated site for educational content on YouTube, organizing hundreds of channels into defined categories. [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/) is a daily newsletter from someone who [reads 1,000 articles a day](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/the-man-who-reads-1000-articles-a), choosing his five favorites and sending them out with a short summary. Oftentimes, these linked articles don’t have a paywall of their own at all — but subscribers of The Browser pay to have them sent in a curated list.\n\nThe demand is certainly there: Channels Stack launched on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/channels-stack) with a 5.0/5 average rating and nearly 400 upvotes, and The Browser has successfully figured out how to monetize free existing content (with over [40,000 followers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheBrowser) to boot).\n\nWe can go even further back — classic examples of successful curation businesses are record shops and [bookstores](https://pen-online.com/travel/morioka-shoten-the-book-shop-with-only-one-book/), and examples in tech include Spotify (for music), Netflix (for TV and movies), and Uber (which bundled its UberEats offering into one app, thus increasing Uber’s TAM, or total addressable market).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*S9v6cEdZr4ffVHV5UeVrMg.jpeg)\n\n**In my view, however, the business of *influencer* bundling has only just begun.** Curators are the new creators, and as consumers, we’re going to be willing to pay someone with good taste to help us sort through the ever-growing mass of information at our fingertips.\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Psychology Behind the Need for Curation**\n\nAs it turns out, there’s some [psychological ground](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/4/2/the-death-of-the-newsfeed) to all of this. Think of it as a carefully mixed cocktail of the following:\n\n*   [Zuckerberg’s Law](https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/06/mark-zuckerberg-explains-his-law-of-social-sharing-video/), or the tendency to **share more** and more on social media over time\n*   [Dunbar’s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number), or the average number of stable **social relationships one can maintain** at a given time (it’s around 150)\n*   [Zipf’s Law](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/05/31/facebook-values-itself-based-on-metcalfes-law-but-the-market-is-using-zipfs/#1e12bdff68f5), which describes how in any system of resources there are a **small number of items of high value**, and a “long tail” of many more of low value (slightly tangential but related reading: [Metcalfe’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law), which has now [largely been refuted](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-is-wrong) as a method of evaluating social networks, but in 2012 helped to rationalize Facebook’s insane over-valuation in its IPO)\n\nTo me, online content consumption seems to exist on a pendulum of sorts: we love content to the extreme — *Unbundle!! Give us more! —* until we are overwhelmed with choice and analysis — *It’s too much!! Bundle it back up again! —* and swing to the opposite side. In the end, we always end up somewhere in the middle… but it’s a lot of swinging back and forth on this creation/curation pendulum until we get there.\n\n> “There are only two ways to make money in business: One is to bundle; the other is to unbundle.” — [Jim Barksdale](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling)\n\nHaving said this, and looking at the current information overload we all face on a day-to-day basis, I think there’s room for a **new market of *creators as curators***. So, with that said, what does this look like for an influencer or brand?\n\n## **How Do You Curate — and Why?**\n\nThere isn’t one sole motivation behind why creators, influencers, and brands may want to curate. In fact, curation can:\n\n*   Build a **personal** **brand** or **audience.**\n*   **Fulfill a** **need** in a particular market. For example, [Femstreet](https://femstreet.substack.com/) is a weekly digest of timely posts from female investors and operators. It’s racked up thousands of subscribers and has been featured in Fortune, Forbes, and Crunchbase.\n*   Create an **extra category** within an existing business.\n*   Become an additional **revenue source.** As we saw with [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/) example, it’s possible to monetize free content if it’s curated well — consumers are willing to pay someone who has good taste, and it’s an easy way to add a revenue stream to your business.\n\nTo learn more, I asked my *own* audience about their favorite curated content:\n\nBelow is a categorized list of some of the responses I received. My favorites are in bold:\n\n**Newsletters: **[Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/signup?utm_expid=.ZTQPzZIzTFOdxoi4D0Ey0Q.1\\&utm_referrer=), [**Everything Bundle**](https://everything.substack.com/)**, **[LetterDrop](https://twitter.com/letterdropio), [**Femstreet**](https://femstreet.substack.com/)**, **[Brain Pickings](https://twitter.com/brainpickings), [**The Generalist**](https://www.readthegeneralist.com/)**,** [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/), [Snaxshot](https://twitter.com/thesnaxshot/status/1297660476671897602?s=20), [The Profile](https://readtheprofile.com/), [The Takeoff](https://thetakeoff.substack.com/), [Social Studies](https://socialstudies.news/), [Techmeme](https://www.techmeme.com/)\n\n**Podcasts: **[Podcast Notes](https://podcastnotes.org/), [**TLDL**](https://twitter.com/TLDLdotAPP)**,** [Shuffle](https://twitter.com/getshuffleapp), [Podshots](https://podshots.substack.com/), [Podcast Review](https://podcastreview.org/)\n\n**Crowdsourced Curation: **[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), [**Bookshlf**](https://twitter.com/joinbookshlf)**,** [Listory](https://www.listory.com/en/), [MyHighlights](https://twitter.com/UseHighlights)\n\n\\[*Note:* there are even more responses in the Twitter thread above, in case you’re curious and want to check out more!]\n\n## Making Curation Profitable\n\nThe best brands (and individual influencers, at that) are the best at an always-evolving curation as a service. Nathan and Dan’s Everything Bundle seems to be a playbook in itself, as outlined by [Ari Lewis](https://twitter.com/amlewis4) in [this thread](https://twitter.com/amlewis4/status/1296485567258034177):\n\n1.  Find initial traction\n2.  Shift the emphasis from the individual to the greater media brand\n3.  Scale and continue to add value\n\nOne way to [monetize curation](https://www.listory.com/l/beceae7e-3c84-4595-996d-d00c4123d967?share=2e9b2a53-32fe-49cc-9186-ceadf1ca09c3) is through a paid newsletter, with the Everything Bundle as a great example. Other opportunities include blogs, ebooks, e-commerce stores, and consultations/speaking gigs. I even came across [ReadBase](https://readbase.landen.co/) during my research, which allows curators to monetize their bookmarks and reading lists. In any case, curators can find success by building up a targeted online presence and then providing curated content to that audience.\n\n* * *\n\nIt’s clear that curating content within a particular niche can be an incredible way to build an audience and add value. Content curation hooks people in with the promise of learning new skills while saving time, and it keeps them coming back by building a sense of community around a particular subject or vertical. As outlined in this [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling) interview with Marc Andreessen and Jim Barksdale, bundling and curation can be a strategic decision for your business, as long as it’s done correctly.\n\nCuration, in a sense, is its own form of [intertextuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertextuality), or the shaping of a text’s meaning by another text. Content doesn’t exist on the Internet in a vacuum: it takes up space, and it forms a [web of influence and connections](https://laetitiaatwork.substack.com/p/emails-overload-newsletters-and-impostor).

Oftentimes, these linked articles don’t have a paywall of their own at all — but subscribers of The Browser pay to have them sent in a curated list.\n\nThe demand is certainly there: Channels Stack launched on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/channels-stack) with a 5.0/5 average rating and nearly 400 upvotes, and The Browser has successfully figured out how to monetize free existing content (with over [40,000 followers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheBrowser) to boot).\n\nWe can go even further back — classic examples of successful curation businesses are record shops and [bookstores](https://pen-online.com/travel/morioka-shoten-the-book-shop-with-only-one-book/), and examples in tech include Spotify (for music), Netflix (for TV and movies), and Uber (which bundled its UberEats offering into one app, thus increasing Uber’s TAM, or total addressable market).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*S9v6cEdZr4ffVHV5UeVrMg.jpeg)\n\n**In my view, however, the business of *influencer* bundling has only just begun.** Curators are the new creators, and as consumers, we’re going to be willing to pay someone with good taste to help us sort through the ever-growing mass of information at our fingertips.\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Psychology Behind the Need for Curation**\n\nAs it turns out, there’s some [psychological ground](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/4/2/the-death-of-the-newsfeed) to all of this. Think of it as a carefully mixed cocktail of the following:\n\n*   [Zuckerberg’s Law](https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/06/mark-zuckerberg-explains-his-law-of-social-sharing-video/), or the tendency to **share more** and more on social media over time\n*   [Dunbar’s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number), or the average number of stable **social relationships one can maintain** at a given time (it’s around 150)\n*   [Zipf’s Law](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/05/31/facebook-values-itself-based-on-metcalfes-law-but-the-market-is-using-zipfs/#1e12bdff68f5), which describes how in any system of resources there are a **small number of items of high value**, and a “long tail” of many more of low value (slightly tangential but related reading: [Metcalfe’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law), which has now [largely been refuted](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-is-wrong) as a method of evaluating social networks, but in 2012 helped to rationalize Facebook’s insane over-valuation in its IPO)\n\nTo me, online content consumption seems to exist on a pendulum of sorts: we love content to the extreme — *Unbundle!! Give us more! —* until we are overwhelmed with choice and analysis — *It’s too much!! Bundle it back up again! —* and swing to the opposite side. In the end, we always end up somewhere in the middle… but it’s a lot of swinging back and forth on this creation/curation pendulum until we get there.\n\n> “There are only two ways to make money in business: One is to bundle; the other is to unbundle.” — [Jim Barksdale](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling)\n\nHaving said this, and looking at the current information overload we all face on a day-to-day basis, I think there’s room for a **new market of *creators as curators***. So, with that said, what does this look like for an influencer or brand?\n\n## **How Do You Curate — and Why?**\n\nThere isn’t one sole motivation behind why creators, influencers, and brands may want to curate. In fact, curation can:\n\n*   Build a **personal** **brand** or **audience.**\n*   **Fulfill a** **need** in a particular market. For example, [Femstreet](https://femstreet.substack.com/) is a weekly digest of timely posts from female investors and operators. It’s racked up thousands of subscribers and has been featured in Fortune, Forbes, and Crunchbase.\n*   Create an **extra category** within an existing business.\n*   Become an additional **revenue source.** As we saw with [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/) example, it’s possible to monetize free content if it’s curated well — consumers are willing to pay someone who has good taste, and it’s an easy way to add a revenue stream to your business.\n\nTo learn more, I asked my *own* audience about their favorite curated content:\n\nBelow is a categorized list of some of the responses I received. My favorites are in bold:\n\n**Newsletters: **[Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/signup?utm_expid=.ZTQPzZIzTFOdxoi4D0Ey0Q.1\\&utm_referrer=), [**Everything Bundle**](https://everything.substack.com/)**, **[LetterDrop](https://twitter.com/letterdropio), [**Femstreet**](https://femstreet.substack.com/)**, **[Brain Pickings](https://twitter.com/brainpickings), [**The Generalist**](https://www.readthegeneralist.com/)**,** [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/), [Snaxshot](https://twitter.com/thesnaxshot/status/1297660476671897602?s=20), [The Profile](https://readtheprofile.com/), [The Takeoff](https://thetakeoff.substack.com/), [Social Studies](https://socialstudies.news/), [Techmeme](https://www.techmeme.com/)\n\n**Podcasts: **[Podcast Notes](https://podcastnotes.org/), [**TLDL**](https://twitter.com/TLDLdotAPP)**,** [Shuffle](https://twitter.com/getshuffleapp), [Podshots](https://podshots.substack.com/), [Podcast Review](https://podcastreview.org/)\n\n**Crowdsourced Curation: **[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), [**Bookshlf**](https://twitter.com/joinbookshlf)**,** [Listory](https://www.listory.com/en/), [MyHighlights](https://twitter.com/UseHighlights)\n\n\\[*Note:* there are even more responses in the Twitter thread above, in case you’re curious and want to check out more!]\n\n## Making Curation Profitable\n\nThe best brands (and individual influencers, at that) are the best at an always-evolving curation as a service. Nathan and Dan’s Everything Bundle seems to be a playbook in itself, as outlined by [Ari Lewis](https://twitter.com/amlewis4) in [this thread](https://twitter.com/amlewis4/status/1296485567258034177):\n\n1.  Find initial traction\n2.  Shift the emphasis from the individual to the greater media brand\n3.  Scale and continue to add value\n\nOne way to [monetize curation](https://www.listory.com/l/beceae7e-3c84-4595-996d-d00c4123d967?share=2e9b2a53-32fe-49cc-9186-ceadf1ca09c3) is through a paid newsletter, with the Everything Bundle as a great example. Other opportunities include blogs, ebooks, e-commerce stores, and consultations/speaking gigs. I even came across [ReadBase](https://readbase.landen.co/) during my research, which allows curators to monetize their bookmarks and reading lists. In any case, curators can find success by building up a targeted online presence and then providing curated content to that audience.\n\n* * *\n\nIt’s clear that curating content within a particular niche can be an incredible way to build an audience and add value. Content curation hooks people in with the promise of learning new skills while saving time, and it keeps them coming back by building a sense of community around a particular subject or vertical. As outlined in this [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling) interview with Marc Andreessen and Jim Barksdale, bundling and curation can be a strategic decision for your business, as long as it’s done correctly.\n\nCuration, in a sense, is its own form of [intertextuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertextuality), or the shaping of a text’s meaning by another text. Content doesn’t exist on the Internet in a vacuum: it takes up space, and it forms a [web of influence and connections](https://laetitiaatwork.substack.com/p/emails-overload-newsletters-and-impostor). We have the content.

{"id": "2cs9-k0q_btuH9E6HCxuAON9AdzGQ-24KhWu_xfSnIA", "title": "PaperclipDAO's landmark first trade... and a tribute to the NFTs that got away", "body": "We just made our first trade! Paperclip DAO has swapped one $PAPER/$CLIP NFT for the [1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card](https://opensea.io/assets/0x76be3b62873462d2142405439777e971754e8e77/42) offered by [@bitcoinPalmer](https://twitter.com/bitcoinPalmer/status/1425273580749742081). Palmer welcome to PaperclipDAO! 🖇\n\nWe weighed several factors in making a final decision on which trade to accept. We care about more than just the economic value of a trade; we value the culture, story, and journey of the NFT as well. We also had to make a hard call about whether to honor the past or push towards the future. Our final poll after hours of discussion was a dead heat:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7af0279e-a154-4986-9893-743dee2c21c1.jpeg?height=756&width=1169)\n\nIt wasn’t easy, but we ultimately decided to go with a trade that highlighted the future of NFTs. \n\nPaperclipDAO now owns a 1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card, which can be used in [Parallel](https://www.parallel.life/), a sci-fi collectable game composed of digital collectible cards that can be combined into decks that dictate the game (think Magic at the Gathering or Pokemon). The Earthen Concept Art NFT was given only to early supporters of Parallel, and it's gratifying to see people taking the opportunity to recount [the NFT's unique history](https://twitter.com/GarretteDVF/status/1425657844414746629?s=20). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/69760d51-7aa0-4025-be9e-15367b4fee13.jpeg?height=1620&width=1080)\n\nIt’s a promising future for digitally scarce, playable cards, and since the purchase of these NFTs funds the development of the game itself, it also demonstrates the wide range of utility of NFTs. Who knows, maybe the team will let us bestow some magical paperclip power? 💫\n\nThis decision wasn’t easy; we were blown away by the offers we received and quickly realized that the hardest part would be parting with the incredible NFTs that we couldn’t accept. Check out the full [Round 1 offer thread](https://twitter.com/PaperclipDAO/status/1425117547251343369) to see all the amazing offers. \n\nGiven the quick turnaround, we only have time to highlight a few of our favorites. In no particular order, here is our homage to the ones that got away in Round 1: \n\n- Our very first offer came from JPG’s [Maria Paula Fernandez](https://twitter.com/MPtherealMVP/status/1425118535857156101), who just plain got it and proposed a trade for [simulacra](https://opensea.io/assets/0x8644053aadb0df38e7734f5010fef643316bbb92/28) before we had explained the project at all. Legend. **EDIT:** There was actually a tie for the first offer, with [@AdrianLeb](https://twitter.com/adrianleb) offering a lovely [BlockArt](https://opensea.io/assets/0xb80fbf6cdb49c33dc6ae4ca11af8ac47b0b4c0f3/2544) at the exact same time as MP, making them co-legends. \n- Adam Cochran offered this [Cool Cat](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425206741084610566), complete with sunglasses and a great story. As competition heated up, he increased the offer to [4 Cool Cats](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425249645253496832). Adam later put forth an offer that absolutely blew his first two away! [He proposed a collection of 14 historic NFTs](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425487421895057408), in a collection titled Moments in Our History. This collection represents unique fists, influential artists, and rare defunct collectibles that helped shape the NFT space and have led to the NFT renaissance we're living right now. It’s an excellent read.\n- [A $HASH of the @paperclipDAO UNIv3 NFT](https://twitter.com/blasteasy/status/1425181303767543815) was also minted and proposed. Proof of Beauty is stunning. Just look at them. And to honor our project with a mint of the $PAPER/$CLIP NFT floored us. [Sisyphus](https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus) also offered [an original Proof of Beauty](https://opensea.io/assets/0xe18a32192ed95b0fe9d70d19e5025f103475d7ba/57896044618658097711785492504343953927315557066662158946655541218820101244980), for Beeple's first Everydays mint on-chain in another historic NFT moment offered for the first trade. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/826bf6cf-b6d7-420c-bade-3d6420592cfa.jpeg?height=1800&width=1125)\n\n- [MoonCatRescue](https://mooncatrescue.com/) is absolutely one of the great NFT stories, with a community rediscovering and rescuing these Mooncats that have been “trapped” since the project began in 2017 (!!!). No way to do it justice here--[you have to read about it](https://mooncatrescue.com/). We were lucky to be offered several Mooncats ([this one](https://opensea.io/assets/0xc3f733ca98e0dad0386979eb96fb1722a1a05e69/1549), [this one](https://opensea.io/assets/0x7c40c393dc0f283f318791d746d894ddd3693572/2223), and [this one](https://opensea.io/assets/0xc3f733ca98e0dad0386979eb96fb1722a1a05e69/18995)). \n- [Folia](https://twitter.com/foliafoliafolia/status/1425172915889266693)’s Kudzu virus is the genius brainchild of Billy Rennekamp, one of the NFT OG’s ([with the NFT to prove it](https://opensea.io/assets/0x72148fcae1d77eebcd9486af7e656bb736c213ef/3?embed=night)).

Creator Matt Furie is well known for creating Pepe the Frog back in 2005 for a comic called “Boys Club,” which subsequently went on to become the Internet meme that we all know and love. \n- [@JordanLzG](https://twitter.com/JordanLzG/status/1425259957658824709) splashed the pot by offering [The Title Open Edition by Pak](https://niftygateway.com/collections/pakopen). Pak is an anonymous creator at the forefront of experience-based art. His work was recently auctioned by Sotheby’s and his collection The Title (from which The Cheap hails) was one of the best NFT-based experiences in 2020. We were also offered 3 in Pak’s [The Flipper](https://opensea.io/assets/0x090c53bac270768759c8f4c93151bd1a808a280e/18700020009) series.\n- In a very special offer, [devops199fan](https://twitter.com/cjliu49/status/1425235759934541829) offered [#404/420 of the EthereumFilm Infinite Garden Bloom NFT](https://twitter.com/devops199fan/status/1425257222364295174) in collaboration with the one and only [pplpleasr](https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1) 🤩 . Each NFT is tied to select on-screen credits in the film, which will be the first feature-length Ethereum documentary and the first documentary funded via NFTs. \n- [Astrocryptids](https://twitter.com/CoffeeTimesTW/status/1425254256563482627?s=20) is a charming little project where a twitter transmission bot “beams” mysterious code to an artist who then creates algorithmic sprites with a unique star code.

Palmer welcome to PaperclipDAO! 🖇\n\nWe weighed several factors in making a final decision on which trade to accept. We care about more than just the economic value of a trade; we value the culture, story, and journey of the NFT as well. We also had to make a hard call about whether to honor the past or push towards the future. Our final poll after hours of discussion was a dead heat:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7af0279e-a154-4986-9893-743dee2c21c1.jpeg?height=756&width=1169)\n\nIt wasn’t easy, but we ultimately decided to go with a trade that highlighted the future of NFTs. \n\nPaperclipDAO now owns a 1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card, which can be used in [Parallel](https://www.parallel.life/), a sci-fi collectable game composed of digital collectible cards that can be combined into decks that dictate the game (think Magic at the Gathering or Pokemon). The Earthen Concept Art NFT was given only to early supporters of Parallel, and it's gratifying to see people taking the opportunity to recount [the NFT's unique history](https://twitter.com/GarretteDVF/status/1425657844414746629?s=20). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/69760d51-7aa0-4025-be9e-15367b4fee13.jpeg?height=1620&width=1080)\n\nIt’s a promising future for digitally scarce, playable cards, and since the purchase of these NFTs funds the development of the game itself, it also demonstrates the wide range of utility of NFTs. Who knows, maybe the team will let us bestow some magical paperclip power? 💫\n\nThis decision wasn’t easy; we were blown away by the offers we received and quickly realized that the hardest part would be parting with the incredible NFTs that we couldn’t accept. Check out the full [Round 1 offer thread](https://twitter.com/PaperclipDAO/status/1425117547251343369) to see all the amazing offers. \n\nGiven the quick turnaround, we only have time to highlight a few of our favorites. In no particular order, here is our homage to the ones that got away in Round 1: \n\n- Our very first offer came from JPG’s [Maria Paula Fernandez](https://twitter.com/MPtherealMVP/status/1425118535857156101), who just plain got it and proposed a trade for [simulacra](https://opensea.io/assets/0x8644053aadb0df38e7734f5010fef643316bbb92/28) before we had explained the project at all.

As competition heated up, he increased the offer to [4 Cool Cats](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425249645253496832). Adam later put forth an offer that absolutely blew his first two away! [He proposed a collection of 14 historic NFTs](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425487421895057408), in a collection titled Moments in Our History. This collection represents unique fists, influential artists, and rare defunct collectibles that helped shape the NFT space and have led to the NFT renaissance we're living right now. It’s an excellent read.\n- [A $HASH of the @paperclipDAO UNIv3 NFT](https://twitter.com/blasteasy/status/1425181303767543815) was also minted and proposed. Proof of Beauty is stunning. Just look at them. And to honor our project with a mint of the $PAPER/$CLIP NFT floored us. [Sisyphus](https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus) also offered [an original Proof of Beauty](https://opensea.io/assets/0xe18a32192ed95b0fe9d70d19e5025f103475d7ba/57896044618658097711785492504343953927315557066662158946655541218820101244980), for Beeple's first Everydays mint on-chain in another historic NFT moment offered for the first trade. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/826bf6cf-b6d7-420c-bade-3d6420592cfa.jpeg?height=1800&width=1125)\n\n- [MoonCatRescue](https://mooncatrescue.com/) is absolutely one of the great NFT stories, with a community rediscovering and rescuing these Mooncats that have been “trapped” since the project began in 2017 (!!!).

Palmer welcome to PaperclipDAO! 🖇\n\nWe weighed several factors in making a final decision on which trade to accept. We care about more than just the economic value of a trade; we value the culture, story, and journey of the NFT as well. We also had to make a hard call about whether to honor the past or push towards the future.

Who knows, maybe the team will let us bestow some magical paperclip power? 💫\n\nThis decision wasn’t easy; we were blown away by the offers we received and quickly realized that the hardest part would be parting with the incredible NFTs that we couldn’t accept. Check out the full [Round 1 offer thread](https://twitter.com/PaperclipDAO/status/1425117547251343369) to see all the amazing offers. \n\nGiven the quick turnaround, we only have time to highlight a few of our favorites.

As competition heated up, he increased the offer to [4 Cool Cats](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425249645253496832). Adam later put forth an offer that absolutely blew his first two away! [He proposed a collection of 14 historic NFTs](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425487421895057408), in a collection titled Moments in Our History.

It’s an excellent read.\n- [A $HASH of the @paperclipDAO UNIv3 NFT](https://twitter.com/blasteasy/status/1425181303767543815) was also minted and proposed. Proof of Beauty is stunning.

Each NFT is tied to select on-screen credits in the film, which will be the first feature-length Ethereum documentary and the first documentary funded via NFTs. \n- [Astrocryptids](https://twitter.com/CoffeeTimesTW/status/1425254256563482627?s=20) is a charming little project where a twitter transmission bot “beams” mysterious code to an artist who then creates algorithmic sprites with a unique star code.

Paperclip DAO has swapped one $PAPER/$CLIP NFT for the [1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card](https://opensea.io/assets/0x76be3b62873462d2142405439777e971754e8e77/42) offered by [@bitcoinPalmer](https://twitter.com/bitcoinPalmer/status/1425273580749742081). Palmer welcome to PaperclipDAO! 🖇\n\nWe weighed several factors in making a final decision on which trade to accept. We care about more than just the economic value of a trade; we value the culture, story, and journey of the NFT as well. We also had to make a hard call about whether to honor the past or push towards the future. Our final poll after hours of discussion was a dead heat:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7af0279e-a154-4986-9893-743dee2c21c1.jpeg?height=756&width=1169)\n\nIt wasn’t easy, but we ultimately decided to go with a trade that highlighted the future of NFTs. \n\nPaperclipDAO now owns a 1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card, which can be used in [Parallel](https://www.parallel.life/), a sci-fi collectable game composed of digital collectible cards that can be combined into decks that dictate the game (think Magic at the Gathering or Pokemon). The Earthen Concept Art NFT was given only to early supporters of Parallel, and it's gratifying to see people taking the opportunity to recount [the NFT's unique history](https://twitter.com/GarretteDVF/status/1425657844414746629?s=20). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/69760d51-7aa0-4025-be9e-15367b4fee13.jpeg?height=1620&width=1080)\n\nIt’s a promising future for digitally scarce, playable cards, and since the purchase of these NFTs funds the development of the game itself, it also demonstrates the wide range of utility of NFTs. Who knows, maybe the team will let us bestow some magical paperclip power? 💫\n\nThis decision wasn’t easy; we were blown away by the offers we received and quickly realized that the hardest part would be parting with the incredible NFTs that we couldn’t accept. Check out the full [Round 1 offer thread](https://twitter.com/PaperclipDAO/status/1425117547251343369) to see all the amazing offers. \n\nGiven the quick turnaround, we only have time to highlight a few of our favorites. In no particular order, here is our homage to the ones that got away in Round 1: \n\n- Our very first offer came from JPG’s [Maria Paula Fernandez](https://twitter.com/MPtherealMVP/status/1425118535857156101), who just plain got it and proposed a trade for [simulacra](https://opensea.io/assets/0x8644053aadb0df38e7734f5010fef643316bbb92/28) before we had explained the project at all.

As competition heated up, he increased the offer to [4 Cool Cats](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425249645253496832). Adam later put forth an offer that absolutely blew his first two away! [He proposed a collection of 14 historic NFTs](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425487421895057408), in a collection titled Moments in Our History. This collection represents unique fists, influential artists, and rare defunct collectibles that helped shape the NFT space and have led to the NFT renaissance we're living right now. It’s an excellent read.\n- [A $HASH of the @paperclipDAO UNIv3 NFT](https://twitter.com/blasteasy/status/1425181303767543815) was also minted and proposed. Proof of Beauty is stunning. Just look at them. And to honor our project with a mint of the $PAPER/$CLIP NFT floored us. [Sisyphus](https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus) also offered [an original Proof of Beauty](https://opensea.io/assets/0xe18a32192ed95b0fe9d70d19e5025f103475d7ba/57896044618658097711785492504343953927315557066662158946655541218820101244980), for Beeple's first Everydays mint on-chain in another historic NFT moment offered for the first trade. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/826bf6cf-b6d7-420c-bade-3d6420592cfa.jpeg?height=1800&width=1125)\n\n- [MoonCatRescue](https://mooncatrescue.com/) is absolutely one of the great NFT stories, with a community rediscovering and rescuing these Mooncats that have been “trapped” since the project began in 2017 (!!!).

{"id": "4MzUqJuyoSbLqd4MMA4B1YwoU2gs_mpVTM5uSdbRhBs", "title": "A beginner's guide to NFTs", "body": "#### What are NFTs?\n\nNon-fungible token (NFT) is a term used to describe a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. Assets that can be represented as NFTs range from digital goods, such as items that exist within virtual worlds, to claims on physical assets such as clothing items or real estate. In the coming years, we will see NFTs used to unlock entirely new use cases that are only made possible by crypto.\n\n ![Test caption](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9799dae1-c2c9-4712-813b-10b23c279a36.jpeg)\n\nWhile the Ethereum ecosystem is where most NFT activity has taken place to date, NFTs can exist on other smart contract platforms too. This is because, at their core, NFTs are just digital abstractions used to represent assets that are one of a kind. Non-fungible token isn’t the most intuitive term since we don’t commonly refer to the fungibility of objects in the physical world, but this is an important technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain. The goal for this post is not to detail every project within the NFT space, but to give a high level overview of what NFTs are, why they are interesting, and showcase some of their potential use cases.\n\n#### Why are NFTs interesting?\n\nNFTs are powerful because, when combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to issue, own, and trade them. This makes interacting with NFTs significantly more efficient than in traditional platforms. The same reason why cryptocurrency used in payments is more efficient than traditional payments, that it is borderless and significantly easier to transfer, applies to NFTs. For example, if you want to create tradable in-game items as a game developer, then you can instantly have them be tradable through protocols that allow for decentralized exchange of NFTs. You don’t have to create your own marketplace or go through the onboarding process of a centralized platform in order to have the items be tradable.\n\nNFT activity can go well past trading and include actions like being able to borrow and lend, support fractional ownership (e.g. [NIFTEX](https://www.niftex.com/)), or use it as collateral in taking out a loan (e.g. [NFTfi](https://nftfi.com/)). The possibilities are endless when you have the ability to combine NFTs with DeFi building blocks. For example, the game [Aavegotchi](http://aavegotchi.com) combines DeFi and NFT gaming where each Aavegotchi character represents a user’s collateral that is deposited within the lending platform [Aave](https://aave.com/), but you can also battle the characters, level them up, and equip wearables that change their traits.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1259686-6b61-455a-a204-f6e6da648f10.jpeg)\n\n\\\nNFTs can cover an extremely wide variety of areas given they are simply digital representations of ownership but there has been significant growth within art and gaming in particular. Note that many digital works of art and gaming items are a subset of a larger category of NFT collectibles. There is also the emerging space of social tokens, which sometimes falls into the NFT category or that is closely related to it.\n\n#### Art\n\nNFTs can make fractionalized ownership more accessible, so if there is a valuable item that otherwise wouldn’t have been accessible for someone to own, now they can own a piece of it. Custody of a physical item still requires a trustworthy custodian, but being able to issue, hold, and trade it as a cryptoasset unlocks more use cases. One can also craft an NFT such that the creator receives a percentage of all secondary sales in a completely automated way. Artists typically don’t receive a cut of secondary sales in the traditional art world.\n\nProgrammable art is another interesting concept where a piece of artwork can incorporate on-chain data to dynamically update certain features or characteristics of the work. For example, one could create a piece of programmable art whose background changes if the price of ether goes above a certain dollar-value. There are countless creative possibilities.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a51670c0-4a1c-4aaf-917d-0e551855b56d.jpeg)\n\n\\\n[Async Art](https://async.art/) is a digital art marketplace known for programmable art. Many artists on Async sell artwork where someone is able to own the “master” copy which consists of a number of individual layers, but other people can own the individual layers and adjust their attributes over time. Imagine groups of people being able to own art collectively, where members of the group manage attributes of the work.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fea07c75-8b3c-4592-b8f2-f5d6d92e544c.jpeg)\n\n\\\nA common question about digital artwork is what can you do with it? These works can be displayed in digital frames in a physical setting for people to enjoy. The digital artist Beeple sold physical tokens along with his digital NFTs and made [$3.5 million](https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x6e5dc5405baefb8c0166bcc78d2692777f2cbffb/21) from sales in an auction on the Nifty Gateway marketplace.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8689be31-b33f-46ac-94aa-feea3a1b3dd1.jpeg)\n\n\\\nDigital artwork can also be displayed in online collections like a [SuperRare profile](https://superrare.co/thevault/collection) as well as in virtual worlds. There are a number of art galleries within [Cryptovoxels](http://cryptovoxels.com), a virtual world where users can buy and sell land parcels as NFTs. As virtual reality spaces become more popular, having digital art to display will become more common. This wouldn’t be much different than someone spending money on video game items to customize a character’s appearance, already a multi-billion dollar industry.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7386d358-d43d-4934-9ea5-b51c33932365.jpeg)\n\n\\\nA common skepticism is that someone can just take a screenshot of the image or get a digital file so it’s not really scarce. However, the same argument could apply to physical items as well. Anyone can take a photo of the Mona Lisa or create a replica of it, but it isn’t the real item from the artist. People are willing to pay a premium for the original work. Another interesting aspect of digital art or collectibles is that you can easily verify the item’s ownership history. Some digital items might be worth more depending on who owned it in the past.\n\nWith NFTs, you can also prove that the item is real and tamper proof. This is an issue in the physical collectibles space. For example, a [T206 Honus Wagner baseball card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T206_Honus_Wagner) was sold to Wayne Gretzky for $451k and sold again for several million dollars. One of the sellers of the card later admitted in court to trimming the card’s edges to make it look better. You can ensure NFT supply doesn’t change and there’s no counterfeit or continued printing. For example, there are many [counterfeit Black Lotus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAvLC3fz068&) cards in the popular game Magic: The Gathering. Common verification methods include bending the card to make sure it doesn’t crease or going through centralized grading services whose rating significantly affects the card's value.\n\n#### Gaming\n\nSteam, a popular video game platform, has a [Community Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/?) where in-game items can be bought and sold. Steam’s marketplace is centralized and collects a transaction fee of 5% for each item from the buyer. Games like Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 take an additional fee of 10% for their items sold.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ad85fcf-b986-4b60-9fb5-925200fde3a9.jpeg)\n\n\\\nSteam also restricts user wallet balances to $2,000 and the price of a single item to $1,800. While these cases are outliers, many in-game items can actually sell for significantly larger amounts such as the [DotA 2 pink war dog courier](https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-06-dota-2-pink-war-dog-courier-sells-for-38-000.html) for $38,000. Within the crypto space there have also been high priced sales such as the $170,000 [CryptoKitty](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/most-expensive-cryptokitty/). Similarly Magic: The Gathering’s coveted [Black Lotus](https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/5/18251623/magic-the-gathering-black-lotus-auction-price) card sold for $166,100. There is certainly demand for valuable in-game items. In decentralized marketplaces, there isn’t a limit imposed on what game items can be sold and for what amount.\n\nDecentralized marketplaces can significantly reduce transaction fees due to the improved efficiency of starting up and operating a marketplace. Marketplaces can also improve overall user experience and increase interest in the game. Hearthstone is a wildly popular digital collectible card game created by Blizzard Entertainment that had over [100 million players](https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/hearthstone-has-over-100-million-players-1203019919/) in 2018. Hearthstone opted to not have a marketplace for their cards which leaves opportunity for other digital collectible card games that allow for an open marketplace. [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) and [SkyWeaver](https://www.skyweaver.net/) are two trading card games (TCGs) that have cards that are freely tradable. You are also able to earn cards as you level up in the game. Players that did not purchase packs of cards will still be able to improve upon the game’s default decks. It’s an exciting feeling knowing that the earned cards have real world value and can be sold or traded for other cards. Gods Unchained also lets users earn tokens for when they win a match or refer their friend. The tokens themselves unlock rare in-game items and are also freely tradable.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa82c586-39b6-46b1-ae55-cb8a2e44c8e1.jpeg)\n\n\\\nOne of the most popular games in crypto is [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/). You battle with a team of pet Axies and level them up. There's no aspect of the gameplay that feels like a blockchain game but there is the added benefit of being able to openly trade the Axies on NFT marketplaces such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). The game has become popular in the [Philippines](https://www.coindesk.com/nft-game-filipinos-covid) and earning tokens from the game has become a viable source of income for players even [beating minimum wage](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/07/08/axie-infinity-beats-minimum-wage-in-many-countries/) in many countries. There is also a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called [Yield Guild Games](https://yieldguild.io/) which leases Axies to players that want to get started with the game but don’t have the funds to purchase them. Several rare Axies were even [purchased](https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/why-we-spent-159k-on-digital-battle-pets-2/) for $159,000 total.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/26353bcc-0d05-47ea-89ac-fcdc9d2dd848.jpeg)\n\n\\\nThere’s another popular game [Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/) where you can explore different planets and collect Artifact NFTs on new planets, which give bonuses when attached to the planet. Being able to discover and collect these items or even win them in a battle and then trade them in decentralized marketplaces can make the game even more fun.\n\n\\\n ![Planet in Dark Forest which has an Artifact NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/be66b61a-05f0-46b7-aa8f-f7ed542d5cd3.jpeg)\n\n\\\nOne concern with making in-game items tradable is that the ability to trade items can negatively affect the gameplay as people are focused on extracting value from the system or only the players that are willing to pay a lot of money for items can enjoy the game. Diablo III had an auction house where users could trade in-game items for in-game currency and cash. It was [shut down](https://www.wired.com/2013/09/diablo-auction-house/) because of how it affected the game. It was no longer fun and rewarding since players would just buy the best loot. In Diablo III, having the best loot was essentially the goal of the game so having an auction house severely affected gameplay whereas other games are not set up this way. It’s important for game developers to find a balance on what should be freely traded for their game (e.g. skins rather than weapons, [game time](https://secure.eveonline.com/plex/) itself can be traded, etc).\n\n#### Social tokens\n\nThe emerging area of social tokens grew significantly in 2020. Social tokens are a broad category of tokens issued by individuals and communities. This term encompasses other similar terms like personal token, community token, and creator token. So far there hasn’t been a standardized term but I will use social tokens to refer to the broader category. Social tokens enable creators and communities to have more ownership in what they are building which is extremely exciting.\n\n\\\n ![Social tokens map created by Forefront and Seedclub in ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b9316db6-25dd-4c4e-bbb2-b18cfa9a7890.jpeg)\n\n\\\nEarly experiments of social tokens involved people tokenizing their time. For example [Reuben Bramanathan](https://twitter.com/bramanathan?lang=en), who previously worked on legal and product at Coinbase, tokenized his time where 1 [$CSNL](https://www.bramanathan.com/) token equaled 1 hour of his time and was freely traded. We also saw people attempting to tokenize part of their future income. Platforms like [Roll](https://tryroll.com/) and [Coinvise](https://coinvise.co/) make it easier for people to issue their own token.\n\nOne prominent example of a social token is [$RAC](https://blog.ourzora.com/home/introducing-rac), a community token by the Grammy award winning recording artist [RAC](https://twitter.com/RAC), issued through Zora. Token holders get access to a private Discord group and receive early access to merch drops with more perks to be added in the future. The token was retroactively distributed to his supporters including Bandcamp and Patreon supporters, people who had bought merch, and will eventually be distributed to all Twitch supporters. This allows creators to directly interact with and reward their early supporters.\n\nOne of the tools that enabled a new wave of social tokens was [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/), which built a Telegram and Discord bot that connects to an Ethereum wallet to verify token balance before joining a chat group. This allowed for the creation of token permissioned groups, such as [$JAMM](https://www.jammpad.com/) and [$KARMA](https://andrwlee.medium.com/announcing-karma-dao-first-ever-token-permissioned-networking-chat-group-on-telegram-5feab7a54def) with their native tokens, which helped make sure that those joining the group had a certain level of skin in the game. Another feature of Collab.Land is a leaderboard that keeps track of who has contributed the most to the chat group. You could imagine token rewards distributed to those with the highest amounts of participation to reward engagement.\n\nAnother useful social token tool is [Unite Community](https://unite.community/) which allows for creators to easily distribute their tokens to followers through their social media channels and reward engagement.\n\n\\\n ![Unite.community distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0026c774-c91d-443f-a295-161236ad0fba.jpeg)\n\n\\\nThe interesting part about social tokens is that it can represent anything from a person’s time to specialized access to collective ownership of a community. There is a lot of potential for social tokens and I expect many more creators to issue them in the future.\n\n#### Future\n\nThese are just a few of the many use cases that are possible and have gotten some traction. There will likely be a significant increase in NFT adoption over the next several years. Traditional assets like equity getting tokenized seems like a clear progression in the future as it would make transferring them far more efficient. Then we’ll see tokenization that bridges the traditional world but adds new possibilities such as advertising space represented as an NFT where you could sell advertising rights to a site and have that be freely tradable. This would be a form of digital real estate. These NFTs would allow people to bet that a website will get a lot of traction and that the advertising space will become more valuable. Then we’ll start seeing more tokens with brand new concepts that are only made possible because of crypto which is what I’m most excited about.\n\n\\\n ![Table from Will Warren’s presentation at ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8459ba6-156e-48a1-86ad-4182988bfdfc.jpeg)\n\n\\\nThere are a few aspects of the user experience that need to be improved in order for NFTs to become more accessible. We need to have improvements to scaling since transaction fees can make some transactions very expensive or infeasible. Scaling research is already in the works with many different teams in Ethereum working on scaling solutions and we also are seeing other blockchains being built that are catered specifically for this use case. Another point of friction with NFTs is that holders will need to self-custody them. However this complexity can be abstracted away with user friendly wallets that make it easy to onboard and support features such as a PIN, biometrics, and social account recovery. I’m optimistic that these will get built out over time and we will see a huge wave of creativity and experimentation in the NFT space.\n\n#### Resources\n\nHere are some additional resources to understand NFTs further and keep up with developments.\n\nUnderstanding NFTs\n\n* [Quick Overview of the NFT Ecosystem](https://andrewsteinwold.substack.com/p/-quick-overview-of-the-nft-ecosystem) by Andrew Steinwold\n* [The Non-Fungible Token Bible](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) by Devin Finzer\n* [Social Tokens Year in Review](https://2020inreview.forefront.news/) by Cooper Turley\n\nKeeping up with NFTs\n\n* [DeFi Arts Intelligencer newsletter](https://artsdefi.substack.com/) by William Peaster\n* [Zima Red newsletter](https://andrewsteinwold.substack.com/) by Andrew Steinwold\n* [Forefront newsletter](https://forefront.market/) on social tokens\n\nIf you want to get in touch about interesting NFT ideas or projects, I’m [@ljxie](https://twitter.com/ljxie) on Twitter.\n\nThanks to [Will Warren](https://twitter.com/willwarren89) and [Jordan Clifford](https://twitter.com/jcliff42) for reviewing this post.\n\n*Disclaimer: Linda Xie is a Managing Director of Scalar Capital Management, LLC, an investment manager focused on cryptoassets which holds ETH and Ethereum tokens.

There is certainly demand for valuable in-game items. In decentralized marketplaces, there isn’t a limit imposed on what game items can be sold and for what amount.\n\nDecentralized marketplaces can significantly reduce transaction fees due to the improved efficiency of starting up and operating a marketplace. Marketplaces can also improve overall user experience and increase interest in the game. Hearthstone is a wildly popular digital collectible card game created by Blizzard Entertainment that had over [100 million players](https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/hearthstone-has-over-100-million-players-1203019919/) in 2018. Hearthstone opted to not have a marketplace for their cards which leaves opportunity for other digital collectible card games that allow for an open marketplace. [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) and [SkyWeaver](https://www.skyweaver.net/) are two trading card games (TCGs) that have cards that are freely tradable. You are also able to earn cards as you level up in the game. Players that did not purchase packs of cards will still be able to improve upon the game’s default decks. It’s an exciting feeling knowing that the earned cards have real world value and can be sold or traded for other cards. Gods Unchained also lets users earn tokens for when they win a match or refer their friend. The tokens themselves unlock rare in-game items and are also freely tradable.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa82c586-39b6-46b1-ae55-cb8a2e44c8e1.jpeg)\n\n\\\nOne of the most popular games in crypto is [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/). You battle with a team of pet Axies and level them up. There's no aspect of the gameplay that feels like a blockchain game but there is the added benefit of being able to openly trade the Axies on NFT marketplaces such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). The game has become popular in the [Philippines](https://www.coindesk.com/nft-game-filipinos-covid) and earning tokens from the game has become a viable source of income for players even [beating minimum wage](https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/07/08/axie-infinity-beats-minimum-wage-in-many-countries/) in many countries. There is also a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called [Yield Guild Games](https://yieldguild.io/) which leases Axies to players that want to get started with the game but don’t have the funds to purchase them. Several rare Axies were even [purchased](https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/why-we-spent-159k-on-digital-battle-pets-2/) for $159,000 total.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/26353bcc-0d05-47ea-89ac-fcdc9d2dd848.jpeg)\n\n\\\nThere’s another popular game [Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/) where you can explore different planets and collect Artifact NFTs on new planets, which give bonuses when attached to the planet. Being able to discover and collect these items or even win them in a battle and then trade them in decentralized marketplaces can make the game even more fun.\n\n\\\n ![Planet in Dark Forest which has an Artifact NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/be66b61a-05f0-46b7-aa8f-f7ed542d5cd3.jpeg)\n\n\\\nOne concern with making in-game items tradable is that the ability to trade items can negatively affect the gameplay as people are focused on extracting value from the system or only the players that are willing to pay a lot of money for items can enjoy the game. Diablo III had an auction house where users could trade in-game items for in-game currency and cash. It was [shut down](https://www.wired.com/2013/09/diablo-auction-house/) because of how it affected the game. It was no longer fun and rewarding since players would just buy the best loot. In Diablo III, having the best loot was essentially the goal of the game so having an auction house severely affected gameplay whereas other games are not set up this way. It’s important for game developers to find a balance on what should be freely traded for their game (e.g. skins rather than weapons, [game time](https://secure.eveonline.com/plex/) itself can be traded, etc).\n\n#### Social tokens\n\nThe emerging area of social tokens grew significantly in 2020. Social tokens are a broad category of tokens issued by individuals and communities. This term encompasses other similar terms like personal token, community token, and creator token. So far there hasn’t been a standardized term but I will use social tokens to refer to the broader category. Social tokens enable creators and communities to have more ownership in what they are building which is extremely exciting.\n\n\\\n ![Social tokens map created by Forefront and Seedclub in ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b9316db6-25dd-4c4e-bbb2-b18cfa9a7890.jpeg)\n\n\\\nEarly experiments of social tokens involved people tokenizing their time. For example [Reuben Bramanathan](https://twitter.com/bramanathan?lang=en), who previously worked on legal and product at Coinbase, tokenized his time where 1 [$CSNL](https://www.bramanathan.com/) token equaled 1 hour of his time and was freely traded. We also saw people attempting to tokenize part of their future income. Platforms like [Roll](https://tryroll.com/) and [Coinvise](https://coinvise.co/) make it easier for people to issue their own token.\n\nOne prominent example of a social token is [$RAC](https://blog.ourzora.com/home/introducing-rac), a community token by the Grammy award winning recording artist [RAC](https://twitter.com/RAC), issued through Zora. Token holders get access to a private Discord group and receive early access to merch drops with more perks to be added in the future. The token was retroactively distributed to his supporters including Bandcamp and Patreon supporters, people who had bought merch, and will eventually be distributed to all Twitch supporters. This allows creators to directly interact with and reward their early supporters.\n\nOne of the tools that enabled a new wave of social tokens was [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/), which built a Telegram and Discord bot that connects to an Ethereum wallet to verify token balance before joining a chat group. This allowed for the creation of token permissioned groups, such as [$JAMM](https://www.jammpad.com/) and [$KARMA](https://andrwlee.medium.com/announcing-karma-dao-first-ever-token-permissioned-networking-chat-group-on-telegram-5feab7a54def) with their native tokens, which helped make sure that those joining the group had a certain level of skin in the game. Another feature of Collab.Land is a leaderboard that keeps track of who has contributed the most to the chat group. You could imagine token rewards distributed to those with the highest amounts of participation to reward engagement.\n\nAnother useful social token tool is [Unite Community](https://unite.community/) which allows for creators to easily distribute their tokens to followers through their social media channels and reward engagement.\n\n\\\n ![Unite.community distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0026c774-c91d-443f-a295-161236ad0fba.jpeg)\n\n\\\nThe interesting part about social tokens is that it can represent anything from a person’s time to specialized access to collective ownership of a community. There is a lot of potential for social tokens and I expect many more creators to issue them in the future.\n\n#### Future\n\nThese are just a few of the many use cases that are possible and have gotten some traction. There will likely be a significant increase in NFT adoption over the next several years. Traditional assets like equity getting tokenized seems like a clear progression in the future as it would make transferring them far more efficient. Then we’ll see tokenization that bridges the traditional world but adds new possibilities such as advertising space represented as an NFT where you could sell advertising rights to a site and have that be freely tradable. This would be a form of digital real estate. These NFTs would allow people to bet that a website will get a lot of traction and that the advertising space will become more valuable. Then we’ll start seeing more tokens with brand new concepts that are only made possible because of crypto which is what I’m most excited about.\n\n\\\n ![Table from Will Warren’s presentation at ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8459ba6-156e-48a1-86ad-4182988bfdfc.jpeg)\n\n\\\nThere are a few aspects of the user experience that need to be improved in order for NFTs to become more accessible. We need to have improvements to scaling since transaction fees can make some transactions very expensive or infeasible. Scaling research is already in the works with many different teams in Ethereum working on scaling solutions and we also are seeing other blockchains being built that are catered specifically for this use case. Another point of friction with NFTs is that holders will need to self-custody them. However this complexity can be abstracted away with user friendly wallets that make it easy to onboard and support features such as a PIN, biometrics, and social account recovery. I’m optimistic that these will get built out over time and we will see a huge wave of creativity and experimentation in the NFT space.\n\n#### Resources\n\nHere are some additional resources to understand NFTs further and keep up with developments.\n\nUnderstanding NFTs\n\n* [Quick Overview of the NFT Ecosystem](https://andrewsteinwold.substack.com/p/-quick-overview-of-the-nft-ecosystem) by Andrew Steinwold\n* [The Non-Fungible Token Bible](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) by Devin Finzer\n* [Social Tokens Year in Review](https://2020inreview.forefront.news/) by Cooper Turley\n\nKeeping up with NFTs\n\n* [DeFi Arts Intelligencer newsletter](https://artsdefi.substack.com/) by William Peaster\n* [Zima Red newsletter](https://andrewsteinwold.substack.com/) by Andrew Steinwold\n* [Forefront newsletter](https://forefront.market/) on social tokens\n\nIf you want to get in touch about interesting NFT ideas or projects, I’m [@ljxie](https://twitter.com/ljxie) on Twitter.\n\nThanks to [Will Warren](https://twitter.com/willwarren89) and [Jordan Clifford](https://twitter.com/jcliff42) for reviewing this post.\n\n*Disclaimer: Linda Xie is a Managing Director of Scalar Capital Management, LLC, an investment manager focused on cryptoassets which holds ETH and Ethereum tokens.

{"id": "Oiv66KcKrhn55Ti84KwKMEew6kGHACqsX632fqE37ro", "title": "A beginner's guide to NFTs", "body": "#### What are NFTs?\n\nNon-fungible token (NFT) is a term used to describe a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. Assets that can be represented as NFTs range from digital goods, such as items that exist within virtual worlds, to claims on physical assets such as clothing items or real estate. In the coming years, we will see NFTs used to unlock entirely new use cases that are only made possible by crypto.\n\n ![Test caption](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9799dae1-c2c9-4712-813b-10b23c279a36.jpeg)\n\nWhile the Ethereum ecosystem is where most NFT activity has taken place to date, NFTs can exist on other smart contract platforms too. This is because, at their core, NFTs are just digital abstractions used to represent assets that are one of a kind. Non-fungible token isn’t the most intuitive term since we don’t commonly refer to the fungibility of objects in the physical world, but this is an important technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain. The goal for this post is not to detail every project within the NFT space, but to give a high level overview of what NFTs are, why they are interesting, and showcase some of their potential use cases.\n\n#### Why are NFTs interesting?\n\nNFTs are powerful because, when combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to issue, own, and trade them. This makes interacting with NFTs significantly more efficient than in traditional platforms. The same reason why cryptocurrency used in payments is more efficient than traditional payments, that it is borderless and significantly easier to transfer, applies to NFTs. For example, if you want to create tradable in-game items as a game developer, then you can instantly have them be tradable through protocols that allow for decentralized exchange of NFTs. You don’t have to create your own marketplace or go through the onboarding process of a centralized platform in order to have the items be tradable.\n\nNFT activity can go well past trading and include actions like being able to borrow and lend, support fractional ownership (e.g. [NIFTEX](https://www.niftex.com/)), or use it as collateral in taking out a loan (e.g. [NFTfi](https://nftfi.com/)). The possibilities are endless when you have the ability to combine NFTs with DeFi building blocks. For example, the game [Aavegotchi](http://aavegotchi.com) combines DeFi and NFT gaming where each Aavegotchi character represents a user’s collateral that is deposited within the lending platform [Aave](https://aave.com/), but you can also battle the characters, level them up, and equip wearables that change their traits.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1259686-6b61-455a-a204-f6e6da648f10.jpeg)\n\n\\\nNFTs can cover an extremely wide variety of areas given they are simply digital representations of ownership but there has been significant growth within art and gaming in particular. Note that many digital works of art and gaming items are a subset of a larger category of NFT collectibles. There is also the emerging space of social tokens, which sometimes falls into the NFT category or that is closely related to it.\n\n#### Art\n\nNFTs can make fractionalized ownership more accessible, so if there is a valuable item that otherwise wouldn’t have been accessible for someone to own, now they can own a piece of it. Custody of a physical item still requires a trustworthy custodian, but being able to issue, hold, and trade it as a cryptoasset unlocks more use cases. One can also craft an NFT such that the creator receives a percentage of all secondary sales in a completely automated way. Artists typically don’t receive a cut of secondary sales in the traditional art world.\n\nProgrammable art is another interesting concept where a piece of artwork can incorporate on-chain data to dynamically update certain features or characteristics of the work. For example, one could create a piece of programmable art whose background changes if the price of ether goes above a certain dollar-value. There are countless creative possibilities.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a51670c0-4a1c-4aaf-917d-0e551855b56d.jpeg)\n\n\\\n[Async Art](https://async.art/) is a digital art marketplace known for programmable art. Many artists on Async sell artwork where someone is able to own the “master” copy which consists of a number of individual layers, but other people can own the individual layers and adjust their attributes over time. Imagine groups of people being able to own art collectively, where members of the group manage attributes of the work.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fea07c75-8b3c-4592-b8f2-f5d6d92e544c.jpeg)\n\n\\\nA common question about digital artwork is what can you do with it? These works can be displayed in digital frames in a physical setting for people to enjoy. The digital artist Beeple sold physical tokens along with his digital NFTs and made [$3.5 million](https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x6e5dc5405baefb8c0166bcc78d2692777f2cbffb/21) from sales in an auction on the Nifty Gateway marketplace.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8689be31-b33f-46ac-94aa-feea3a1b3dd1.jpeg)\n\n\\\nDigital artwork can also be displayed in online collections like a [SuperRare profile](https://superrare.co/thevault/collection) as well as in virtual worlds. There are a number of art galleries within [Cryptovoxels](http://cryptovoxels.com), a virtual world where users can buy and sell land parcels as NFTs. As virtual reality spaces become more popular, having digital art to display will become more common. This wouldn’t be much different than someone spending money on video game items to customize a character’s appearance, already a multi-billion dollar industry.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7386d358-d43d-4934-9ea5-b51c33932365.jpeg)\n\n\\\nA common skepticism is that someone can just take a screenshot of the image or get a digital file so it’s not really scarce. However, the same argument could apply to physical items as well. Anyone can take a photo of the Mona Lisa or create a replica of it, but it isn’t the real item from the artist. People are willing to pay a premium for the original work. Another interesting aspect of digital art or collectibles is that you can easily verify the item’s ownership history. Some digital items might be worth more depending on who owned it in the past.\n\nWith NFTs, you can also prove that the item is real and tamper proof. This is an issue in the physical collectibles space. For example, a [T206 Honus Wagner baseball card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T206_Honus_Wagner) was sold to Wayne Gretzky for $451k and sold again for several million dollars. One of the sellers of the card later admitted in court to trimming the card’s edges to make it look better. You can ensure NFT supply doesn’t change and there’s no counterfeit or continued printing. For example, there are many [counterfeit Black Lotus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAvLC3fz068&) cards in the popular game Magic: The Gathering. Common verification methods include bending the card to make sure it doesn’t crease or going through centralized grading services whose rating significantly affects the card's value.\n\n#### Gaming\n\nSteam, a popular video game platform, has a [Community Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/?) where in-game items can be bought and sold. Steam’s marketplace is centralized and collects a transaction fee of 5% for each item from the buyer. Games like Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 take an additional fee of 10% for their items sold.\n\n\\\n ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ad85fcf-b986-4b60-9fb5-925200fde3a9.jpeg)\n\n\\\nSteam also restricts user wallet balances to $2,000 and the price of a single item to $1,800. While these cases are outliers, many in-game items can actually sell for significantly larger amounts such as the [DotA 2 pink war dog courier](https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-06-dota-2-pink-war-dog-courier-sells-for-38-000.html) for $38,000. Within the crypto space there have also been high priced sales such as the $170,000 [CryptoKitty](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/most-expensive-cryptokitty/). Similarly Magic: The Gathering’s coveted [Black Lotus](https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/5/18251623/magic-the-gathering-black-lotus-auction-price) card sold for $166,100.

{"id": "Tt8UcA0KiRdF7qXJHgsPyFR-JXQeQvpPrN4Yr8FCZkk", "title": "Tutorial: How to provide liquidity on Balancer (Polygon)", "body": "## What is Balancer?\n\nBalancer is an automated market maker (AMM) protocol that allows users to swap assets using liquidity pools, similar to Uniswap. However, Balancer differs from Uniswap in a major way in that the liquidity pools are able to have up to 8 assets deposited in them, and the desired ratio between those assets can be set by the person that creates it. This essentially allows users to create custom investment vehicles that can act like index funds in which they can collect transaction fees from people using the pool. This comes with the added benefit of being able to maintain the ratios of the assets in their portfolio by having arbitragers effectively manage the fund for them.\n\n## Balancer on Polygon?\n\nIn this tutorial, we will be covering how to provide liquidity on Balancer on the Polygon network. Polygon is an EVM smart contract-enabled side chain that is very similar to Ethereum. This means that you can use familiar tools like MetaMask to approve transactions. An added benefit is that the transaction fees on Polygon are much lower than on Mainnet Ethereum. \n\nIn order to get assets onto Polygon, you will need to use a bridge. Which you can find here: [ETH<>Polygon bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)\n\nHere is a tutorial on how to [Use Polygon for the first time](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/Hm0zb1vkvx0yoj9EfvqCt119vsMdcD0Cp9Sk25hyNic), but in this tutorial, I will assume you have already gone through it. \n\n## How to provide liquidity on Balancer\n\n### What you will need:\n\n1. A supported web3 wallet.\n2. 1 to 8 assets in your wallet on Polygon Network that you wish to invest.\n\nI will also assume that you are familiar with approving transactions with your wallet software.\n\nOnce you have everything you need from the list above, we are ready to dive in.\n\n### Step 1. Go to the Balancer v2 investments page and connect your wallet\n\nYou can get to the investment page by clicking this link https://polygon.balancer.fi/#/. Then you will need to click the “Connect wallet” button in the top right corner of the page and select the wallet software you prefer from the list. Make sure you set the network to Polygon Mainnet.\n\n*If you are managing several wallets with the same software, you will also need to specify which address you wish to connect to the site.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0ea06ba5-a000-4cf3-8767-569ae7a3fcc2.jpeg?height=951&width=1919)\n\nStep 2. Choose a pool you wish to invest in.\n\nYou can scroll through the list or use the “Filter by token” field to search for the pool you wish to invest in. You can also use three of the column headings to sort the list by metrics that may help you decide which pool you wish to choose.\n\nNote that there are several different types of pools, and it is important to understand how each one works if you wish to invest in it. To read about them you can visit the Balancer documentation here: https://docs.balancer.fi/core-concepts/protocol/pools#pool-types\n\nWhen you’ve made your decision, click on the row in the table that represents the pool you wish to invest in.\n\n*The green dots over assets in the “Composition” column identify assets that you already have in your wallet*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/94405f2e-18bf-427e-9def-2d4011a91a42.jpeg?height=867&width=1564)\n\nStep 3. Enter the amount you wish to invest.\n\nFor this example, we’ll be using the USDC/SNX/GRT/WETH pool, which is a Weighted Pool (see top left in photo). This means that the ratios between each asset were set when the pool was created and it is optimized to maintain those ratios as it is used.  \n\nOn the right side of the screen, you will need to enter the assets in the correct ratio in order to enter the pool. However, if you don’t have all of the required assets in your wallet, Balancer will perform the necessary conversions for you as long as you deposit at least one of the required assets. In this case, there is only 100 USDC in the wallet and the weights of each asset is set to 25/25/25/25, so when depositing it, Balancer will use the pool to trade 75 USDC for the equivalent of 25 USDC of each of the other assets before entering the pool. \n\nOf course, before depositing any assets in the pool, you will need to approve the contract to use your funds. Click “Approve…” and submit a transaction for each asset you have, and then click the “Invest…\" button and submit the last transaction. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/07710629-76b6-48cd-80a2-df8c9dde7b7d.jpeg?height=626&width=1570)\n\nStep 4. Monitor your investment\n\nOnce the transaction goes through you will be able to see the pool in the “My V2 investments” section on the page from Step 1. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cd020a1a-3903-4c11-96dc-4204ece8b040.jpeg?height=416&width=1581)\n\nIf you view the pool again you can now click on the “Withdraw” tab to view the assets and their current values. If you wish to reclaim your funds, you can choose to receive them as your share of each token in the proportions shown by selecting “Best price”... \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1c25d41c-faa6-4e6e-87a4-a4f3d8f4d347.jpeg?height=628&width=504)\n\n...or you can withdraw them as a single token, by selecting “Single token” and then clicking the “Withdraw…” button and approving the transaction.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/23e1afdc-d776-407f-a5ca-14553d6ec607.jpeg?height=577&width=499)\n\n## Congrats you now know how to become an LP on Balancer!!\n\n*Always remember to return to the RabbitHole site in order to redeem each task and then mark the Quest as complete within the timeframe so that you will be eligible for the reward.*", "timestamp": 1629095852, "digest": "_MqYw-kl3-KlGnxOtgXNPr9Be8MD1Bsn4zGotMvxQQQ", "contributor": "0x8926B75642C2650aE3c5b227bAD2F7158ceaCCD1"}

Some use-cases include, but are not limited to:\n\n- paying for subscriptions by the second instead of yearly/monthly\n- paying or being paid for work in a more granular way\n- receiving rewards every second for holding a particular token\n\n## Where is Superfluid?\n\nSuperfluid is currently only available on xDai and Polygon, which are EVM smart contract enabled side chains that are very similar to Ethereum. This means that you can use familiar tools like MetaMask to approve transactions. An added benefit is that the transaction fees on these networks are much lower than on Mainnet Ethereum. \n\nIn order to get assets onto these chains, you will need to use a bridge. Which you can find here:\n\n[ETH<>Polygon bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)\n[ETH<>xDai bridge](https://omni.xdaichain.com/)\n\nYou can look up walkthroughs on how to use those bridges, but in this tutorial, I will be showing you how to complete the Superfluid task which is required to earn the Asset Management Skill on RabbitHole, and that task needs to be completed on Polygon.\n\n## How to stream using Superfluid:\n\n### What you will need:\n\n1. A web3 wallet\n2. Some Matic in your wallet on Polygon network\n3. (Optional) Any other ERC20 token: if you want to stream a token other than Matic\n\nI will also assume that you are already familiar with approving transactions with your wallet software.\n\nOnce you have everything you need from the list above, we are ready to dive in.\n\n### Step 1. Go to your Superfluid Dashboard and connect your wallet\n\nYou can get to your dashboard by following this link: https://app.superfluid.finance/ and select the wallet client you would like to use. Depending on network conditions, it can take some time for the page to load. Just be patient.

Search for and select the asset you want to deposit, enter the amount and then click “Deposit”\n\nA window will pop-up for you to approve the transaction. You can normally get a transaction through by paying just 1 gwei as the gas price. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/12cea553-61a7-4162-b554-6b547f85659a.jpeg?height=983&width=1920)\n\n### Step 4.  Click the “Send” button at the top of the screen and a smaller window will pop up \n\nNow that you have some tokens deposited, you can start a stream by clicking “Send”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/02098c41-ee09-4905-a319-ea233533aafa.jpeg?height=983&width=1920)\n\n### Step 5. Enter the Stream details.\n\nYou will need to fill in the following fields in order to start the stream:\n\nA. The destination address. Here I have cover it up so you don’t accidentally send me money ; )\nB. The asset you would like to send\nC. The amount you want to send, coupled with…\nD. The timeframe over which you wish to send it\n*The options are month, week, hour and one-off (which is the same as a regular transfer). Here I have chosen hour, which means I will send 0.0331 Matic to the destination every hour, at a rate of 0.00000919 Matic per second.*\nE. Populated for you to show you how much will be streamed per second\nF. Once all the fields are filled out the way you want them, you can click “Start Streaming”\n\n**It’s worth mentioning that the UI will not allow you to start a stream if it would consume your entire balance in under 4 hours. So you will need to make the appropriate calculations.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8ca8f4c5-1e78-42d9-87f4-56afa06e9690.jpeg?height=983&width=1920)\n\n### Step 6. Monitor your Stream\n\nOnce your stream is flowing you will see the “Current Streams” section will display the outflows (and inflows if you have any) for your account.\n\nThere will also be an estimate for when your account balance will run out. It will be important to keep an eye on this, and I’ll explain why in a second. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4cd353d7-7c6a-4212-b3cf-30e44401fa3c.jpeg?height=983&width=1920)\n\nIf you click on the stream that you just started, you will see some more details about it. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/40b3537a-c99b-4963-a423-c496a91631f0.jpeg?height=592&width=1022)\n\nBy clicking the pencil icon beside the “Estimated amount per month” value, you can adjust how much you are streaming, and over what time period. Editing this will require you to approve another transaction. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3e9415fa-d010-4f4c-ab9d-2889690cca69.jpeg?height=342&width=972)\n\nMost importantly you will notice that there is an amount held as a deposit.\n\n“This deposit is lost if you run out of funds and the stream gets closed automatically. Make sure to top up your balance or close the stream on time to get your deposit back.”\n\nIn order to close the stream you just need to click “Cancel Stream”, and approve a transaction. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/db2f33e4-45d7-4d49-98cc-44b2c672f0a0.jpeg?height=289&width=610)\n\n### Step 7. Redeem the task and claim your XP\n\nOnce you have opened the stream, you will have fulfilled the requirements for the task, and all you have to do is go and click the “Redeem” button and sign the message that pops up.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a554bcab-0c84-47d6-8256-b6e129c040d7.jpeg?height=397&width=1557)\n\n### That's it! \nYou are one step closer to completing the Asset Manager Skill on RabbitHole.

{"id": "8aPp4cJWgvCoUEJo9dmhB6pPKvYQ8T1fe7KgnPRQKEA", "title": "Mirror and tipping point to interoperable content, social, and economic graphs", "body": "*Big thanks to Patrick Rivera, Jarrod Dicker, Raphael Menezes, and Dan Shipper for their help writing this post. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin) or subscribe to [Penguins and Rabbit Holes](https://creativekitchen.so/penguins) to hear more thoughts on building public knowledge in the future.*\n\nInteroperability is the connecting thread of the future of the social web. It’s the reason Facebook and Twitter are not so secretly working to fundamentally transform their current products. It’s the argument I’ll give for the crypto publishing platform Mirror — where this post is published — being undervalued, despite raising a round at $100M a year after launch. Interoperability is the idea that to succeed in the future, builders will design individual lego pieces rather than entire sculptures.\n\nThe world of consumer tech can feel impossible to keep up with at the moment: NFTs, social tokens, crypto wallets, AR/VR, the metaverse. Those terms describe new products and experiences and will continue to change, but interoperability is the core mechanism that brings them together. It will drive the next wave of products, including and especially science where I spend most of my time. \n\nSo I’m going to try and make interoperability as cool as a pixelated punk. I want to lay out the steps to a tipping point — where you wake up one day and the internet is almost unrecognizable from how it is now. And to make those steps as concrete as possible in this abstract world, I’ll do it through the lens of Mirror, a company with a vision that makes the opportunity of interoperability obvious.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac84698a-b4a0-4b5e-9f0d-3bafa9a24824.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n## The dream of interoperability\n\nIn essence, “interoperable” means multiple products or services can make use of the same information.\n\nTake healthcare as an example. If I choose to switch doctors because my current one is a hack, I want my new doctor to have access to all of my medical history. It matters because it fosters competition and allows a more diverse ecosystem to evolve.  My doctors should compete based on who can make me healthiest, not who has exclusive access to my data. Healthcare also illustrates the challenge interoperability has faced with privacy, but more on that later.\n\nAs Ben Thompson notes in [The Web’s Missing Interoperability](https://stratechery.com/2021/the-webs-missing-interoperability/), interoperability was actually one of the core benefits mentioned at the start of the last wave of consumer tech, what many refer to as Web2.0. But we didn’t get interoperability from the big Web2 giants of Facebook, Twitter, and the like.  We got almost the exact opposite — business models built on capturing data, storing it in private databases, and charging advertisers for access to it. We are quick to point the finger at Facebook or Twitter, but blaming them is hardly different than blaming McDonalds for the rise of fast food. The system and especially consumer pressure clearly didn’t create the incentives for interoperable technology to thrive.\n\nMore than a decade later at the dawn of Web3, consumer demand for a healthier internet is growing and there are a few important data points that suggest interoperability at scale is finally possible. First, we see that the giants are exploring this space with quite a bit more energy and openness than you might expect. Twitter — [via their “BlueSky” project](https://twitter.com/bluesky) — is very openly researching how to build an open and interoperable standard for social media. Zuckerberg has recently been talking about Facebook becoming [\"becoming a metaverse company.\"](https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview) \n\nThe simple reason the social giants even consider such bold new directions is because interoperable graphs are better for creators, and creators are the scarce resource in the quickly arriving next iteration of the internet. The most valuable asset in a world of interoperable data will be the complex business relationships creators establish between their content, other creators, and their audience. Subscribers will be replaced by supporters, angel investors by angel audiences, and collaborators by co-owners. Big tech is many things but dumb isn’t one of them, and the giants realize that tapping into those flows of money is where the trillions will be made in the future.\n\nTo be clear, it’s hard to imagine how the transition to interoperability actually happens at these existing giants. While they have been building lots of new features in line with the creator-centric strategy above — tipping, subscriptions, funding for creators, better business tools — only time will tell whether they’ll be able to execute the dramatic shifts they are pretty openly exploring.\n\nThe next question after “is it possible?” is “why should we care?” What would happen if Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and the rest all opened up their vast databases? What new types of products could we imagine getting as creators and consumers from a more interoperable world? Just a few examples to paint a picture:\n- For creators:\n  - **Publish anywhere.** No matter where you publish or who you collaborate with, it is connected to your unique ID and distributed to your followers.\n  - **Auto-updated profiles.** Rather than manually building a LinkTree of your various projects, simply put in your universal creator ID and one is populated and updated automatically.\n- For consumers:\n  - **Focus Twitter.** Discover a version of Twitter which pulls in everyone you follow and their content, but in a single daily digest rather than a time-sucking feed. Ready to dive back into the “normal” app? That’s fine too - these apps live in parallel and have all of the same content.\n  - **Follow everywhere.** Love Taylor Swift? Follow her across all of her accounts with one click.\n\nInteroperability at scale is possible, and it can enable a healthier and more diverse product ecosystem. As [As Jarrod Dicker notes](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU), it remains to be seen whether Web2 will still exist in the future as a parallel to Web3. But it’s clear Web3 is coming, and ultimately whether it is a full replacement will come down to what we as creators and consumers value from our media. So the next step is to take a look at the changing preferences and pressures that are starting to allow interoperability to become mainstream.\n\n## Substack and Web2.5 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5933528b-c4bb-4daa-9bc9-fedc11f3fafb.png?height=959&width=1600)\n\nMoney talks, and building your own business as a creator has traditionally been difficult. It requires stacking a number of different building blocks on top of each other — content creation, distribution, revenue generation, admin, and so on. [The cost of integrating or coordinating those different blocks](https://www.theproductkitchen.com/p/coases-penguin-is-learning-to-fly) has been prohibitively difficult for individuals or small groups of creators, which is why they have written for the New York Times, sung for Sony records, and acted for Disney.\n\nBut things are changing — consumers increasingly prefer to build trust with individuals or small groups. Packy put it best in “[Power to the Person:](https://notboring.mirror.xyz/SPV_-bchriVn_ncDj8OgnLccSb5qAsU0sXNpg9y_UTk)”\n\n> *“**People follow people, not companies,** but companies have long had the advantage because of all of the coordination it takes to build scaled products...Ben Thompson has said that media companies are the first to adapt to a new paradigm shift because of the relative simplicity of their products. They require very little coordination among parties, just the ability to capture and distribute one person’s thoughts, images, or dance moves.”*\n\nThe media boats that first floated across Web2 moats were the Substacks and Patreons. They are the first major media networks to build huge businesses by optimizing for creator success rather than consumer engagement. They are still fully vertical — they own the content and distribution — but creators can theoretically download the emails of their audience to take it with them.\n\nThe reason I call this Web2.5 is because the Substacks and Patreons are *open* but not *interoperable.* There’s nothing stopping me from downloading my Substack subscribers and posts and manually moving to a new platform. The data is *accessible* but not *interoperable*, and that makes all the difference when it comes to building the internet of tomorrow.\n\n## Social graphs in Web2 vs Web3 - a side by side comparison\n\nSo if interoperability is possible, exciting, and we see early signs of it happening, then what would true interoperability in media actually entail? Let’s break it down.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/15b880ab-551b-4edd-b946-179f56b4e23a.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nI admit, I’m not sure I can even imagine a future where *all* of the internet works in this way. We may always have fast food. But the point is that some of it will, because some of it already is. Now we’re finally ready to hold up the Mirror. \n\n## Mirror - the reflection of an interoperable future?\n\nMirror — the red hot “crypto Substack” which just [raised >$10M at $100M from A16Z](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/union-square-ventures-values-crypto-publishing-tool-mirror-at-100-million) and others — is starting to look more like “crypto Kickstarter and crypto Patreon meets crypto Substack.”\n\nHiding behind a distracting blur of new features, Mirror’s core structure is consistent and visionary. It's a bet worth understanding on the future of interoperable content graphs, internet-native money in the form of tokens, and the dynamic new businesses that will be possible because of them.\n\nMirror does look a whole lot like Substack from afar - it has a publishing tool and a way to generate revenue. The most obvious difference is that it has lots of fancy crypto tools to run crowdfunds, generate NFTs for your content, and get tips and other ways to generate revenue. \n\nOn closer examination, however, we can pass it through the same criteria as above and see that it’s not far off:\n- **A unique creator ID:** I use my public Ethereum address, which I own through my private key, to publish on Mirror. \n- **An open database of content, connected to my ID:** Mirror stores content on a decentralized storage system called [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/). If Mirror were to shut down tomorrow, I could access all of my articles by querying Arweave for the posts signed by my Ethereum address.\n- **Open social and economic graphs:** All of the important relationships built on Mirror are stored openly. Adding new members to the platform is done via their [$WRITE race](https://dev.mirror.xyz/vZxxUIeGMQK9NNLcrT0eDYZ6wXhXVr6vTQzztj1DaEA), a decentralized and publicly viewable vote where existing members carry more weight. When I split the proceeds of my article with another writer, or when an audience member buys an NFT in a crowdfund via my article — all of those things are signed via Ethereum addresses and stored publicly. Anyone could build apps on top of this data, for example a “Crunchbase for Creators” which shows how much funding each creator has gotten over time and from whom. \n- **Standards:** Mirror is both using and helping build open standards for the core technologies they use. They use Ethereum standards like ERC20 for fungible tokens, ERC721 for NFTs, signature standards for verifying data and so on. Some other areas like NFT sales and royalties don’t have standards yet, and Mirror is working to establish standards that can be used by others. Better standards means more adoption of those new technologies, which then benefits Mirror as the place with the best creator experience to leverage those technologies to build a business.\n\nThe key point to take away from this is that **owning the content is not important to Mirror’s strategic moat.** What differentiates Mirror and makes it a sticky product for creators is that it offers a number of ways to build a business that you can’t get anywhere else. Mirror dramatically lowers the coordination cost of creating a complex online business as a writer - hidden behind what looks like a content platform is actually a crowdfunding, e-commerce, and media platform all rolled up into powerful cryptographically backed tools. It’s Kickstarter, Patreon, and Substack all in one.\n\nAs a more concrete example, a film team [just raised $2M](https://ethereumfilm.mirror.xyz/3SV8gLXHIW8Ot45h3RL7aOgDINxN2hjLfFVOvyatB2A) to produce a documentary on Ethereum. Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter have contribution limits of $10,000, require a bank account and only support certain jurisdictions. On the other hand, Mirror’s crypto-native crowdfunding tool had programmable contribution limits (the highest contribution was over $200k), required just a crypto wallet, and was open to anyone with an internet connection.  \n\nPatrick Rivera — an engineer at Mirror and one of the best people to follow to understand this space — [calls this the “protocol economy.”](https://p.mirror.xyz/1EpvJwUpx_KlRcHOKLNqADEkwHL_Z1ZYKobF2uLwgBg) Companies like Mirror own publishing and distribution for now because they have to build vertical solutions given the UX problems that are so prevalent in crypto. Being vertically integrated allows Mirror to build easy and effective onramps into the powerful protocols that will serve as their strategic moats in the future. \n\nCrypto products that aren’t vertically integrated end up sending their users through a complex maze of different crypto apps that may have varying degrees of usability. Integrating the user journey into a single app allows crypto products to significantly improve the user experience to drive better acquisition, engagement, and retention over time. The key is to use open code and data standards to build a high-quality integrated experience.\n\nLaying out the open structure that currently hides under Mirror’s vertically integrated solution, you can see that the shift from being a publishing company to stewarding a vibrant protocol economy has very little to do with the content itself. It’s about building developer tools for teams to use their contracts and content tools. It’s about SDKs, APIs, sub-graphs, and documentation. Their competitors will be the Stripes and Stirs of the world, not Substack. At that point, there could be multiple different apps handling publishing and distribution, all routing through Mirror’s business layer to handle things like funding, governance, revenue splits, and so on. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7da76ad6-0cff-40d5-aa65-a3361f3cec9f.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n## Could interoperability ever dry the Web2 moat?\nThere are a number of reasons interoperability will not happen overnight, and may never happen at scale. A few key barriers include high transaction fees, difficulty managing a crypto wallet, and scarcity of talent in the space (although all of these are rapidly improving). Not to mention privacy, security, and moderation — those topics would take an entire piece on their own but there is good reason to believe those are technical limitations which can be tackled.\n\nThe momentum to tackle these challenges can only come from an exponential UX improvement as each new interoperable product is added to the ecosystem. In other words, the network effects of the interoperable ecosystem competing with the walled-garden network effects of Web2. Using your Ethereum wallet as your Mirror account is cool, but if you can use the same wallet to log into another important product you use, the benefit scales exponentially. At a certain point, you might actively prefer to use products that allow you to use your wallet in the same way you prefer to shop with businesses that accept your credit card. That’s the tipping point.\n\nI hope that companies like Mirror will work to push interoperability even as they focus on building onramps to crypto via vertically integrated solutions that can control the end user experience. If they can actively build seamless integrations with other open content platforms such as [Audius](https://audius.co/), it could dramatically accelerate the speed of adoption of a more open internet. \n\nThe more that open platforms rely on and develop the same technology, the more they are effectively investing in each other. They become a superorganism, a swarm. As Packy put it in [“Who disrupts the disruptors”](https://www.notboring.co/p/who-disrupts-the-disrupters), people wonder which new platform will challenge the giants, but  it is the swarm of open platforms that pose the biggest threat to a real tipping point.\n\nPlatforms like Mirror have such an enormous and important challenge ahead when it comes to interoperability. But it’s not all excitement - there are a number of major challenges to a more open model. Say what you will about the job they’re doing, but centralized platforms have unique advantages to privacy and moderation that will be very difficult to build into a more decentralized web. \n\nAmusingly, the best place I’ve found to read all about the challenges that would need to be overcome to build decentralized media platforms at massive scale is Twitter’s BlueSky project. [They have curated a huge amount of content into a GitLab project on open identities](https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community1/decentralized-ecosystem/-/blob/master/topics/data.md), moderation privacy, monetization, and more. So perhaps we shouldn’t sleep on the incumbents after all - and if nothing else we should gain some confidence from the fact that those with all of the money are giving this topic quite a lot of attention.\n\nPatrick and I will be hosting a hangout to discuss interoperability, Mirror, and some exciting new developments - follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin) or join the [Forefront discord](https://forefront.community) to grab a spot when we set the date. \n\n***\nIf you enjoyed this post, be sure to leave a tip.

{"id": "2peQr4iqMWPJIAVtOPfeut7Vli7Fh9PE20QWj0xwvnI", "title": "Mirror and tipping point to interoperable content, social, and economic graphs", "body": "*Big thanks to Patrick Rivera, Jarrod Dicker, Raphael Menezes, and Dan Shipper for their help writing this post. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin) or subscribe to [Penguins and Rabbit Holes](https://creativekitchen.so/penguins) to hear more thoughts on building public knowledge in the future.*\n\nInteroperability is the connecting thread of the future of the social web. It’s the reason Facebook and Twitter are not so secretly working to fundamentally transform their current products. It’s the argument I’ll give for the crypto publishing platform Mirror — where this post is published — being undervalued, despite raising a round at $100M a year after launch. Interoperability is the idea that to succeed in the future, builders will design individual lego pieces rather than entire sculptures.\n\nThe world of consumer tech can feel impossible to keep up with at the moment: NFTs, social tokens, crypto wallets, AR/VR, the metaverse. Those terms describe new products and experiences and will continue to change, but interoperability is the core mechanism that brings them together. It will drive the next wave of products, including and especially science where I spend most of my time. \n\nSo I’m going to try and make interoperability as cool as a pixelated punk. I want to lay out the steps to a tipping point — where you wake up one day and the internet is almost unrecognizable from how it is now. And to make those steps as concrete as possible in this abstract world, I’ll do it through the lens of Mirror, a company with a vision that makes the opportunity of interoperability obvious.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac84698a-b4a0-4b5e-9f0d-3bafa9a24824.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n## The dream of interoperability\n\nIn essence, “interoperable” means multiple products or services can make use of the same information.\n\nTake healthcare as an example. If I choose to switch doctors because my current one is a hack, I want my new doctor to have access to all of my medical history. It matters because it fosters competition and allows a more diverse ecosystem to evolve.  My doctors should compete based on who can make me healthiest, not who has exclusive access to my data. Healthcare also illustrates the challenge interoperability has faced with privacy, but more on that later.\n\nAs Ben Thompson notes in [The Web’s Missing Interoperability](https://stratechery.com/2021/the-webs-missing-interoperability/), interoperability was actually one of the core benefits mentioned at the start of the last wave of consumer tech, what many refer to as Web2.0. But we didn’t get interoperability from the big Web2 giants of Facebook, Twitter, and the like.  We got almost the exact opposite — business models built on capturing data, storing it in private databases, and charging advertisers for access to it. We are quick to point the finger at Facebook or Twitter, but blaming them is hardly different than blaming McDonalds for the rise of fast food. The system and especially consumer pressure clearly didn’t create the incentives for interoperable technology to thrive.\n\nMore than a decade later at the dawn of Web3, consumer demand for a healthier internet is growing and there are a few important data points that suggest interoperability at scale is finally possible. First, we see that the giants are exploring this space with quite a bit more energy and openness than you might expect. Twitter — [via their “BlueSky” project](https://twitter.com/bluesky) — is very openly researching how to build an open and interoperable standard for social media. Zuckerberg has recently been talking about Facebook becoming [\"becoming a metaverse company.\"](https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview) \n\nThe simple reason the social giants even consider such bold new directions is because interoperable graphs are better for creators, and creators are the scarce resource in the quickly arriving next iteration of the internet. The most valuable asset in a world of interoperable data will be the complex business relationships creators establish between their content, other creators, and their audience. Subscribers will be replaced by supporters, angel investors by angel audiences, and collaborators by co-owners. Big tech is many things but dumb isn’t one of them, and the giants realize that tapping into those flows of money is where the trillions will be made in the future.\n\nTo be clear, it’s hard to imagine how the transition to interoperability actually happens at these existing giants. While they have been building lots of new features in line with the creator-centric strategy above — tipping, subscriptions, funding for creators, better business tools — only time will tell whether they’ll be able to execute the dramatic shifts they are pretty openly exploring.\n\nThe next question after “is it possible?” is “why should we care?” What would happen if Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and the rest all opened up their vast databases? What new types of products could we imagine getting as creators and consumers from a more interoperable world? Just a few examples to paint a picture:\n- For creators:\n  - **Publish anywhere.** No matter where you publish or who you collaborate with, it is connected to your unique ID and distributed to your followers.\n  - **Auto-updated profiles.** Rather than manually building a LinkTree of your various projects, simply put in your universal creator ID and one is populated and updated automatically.\n- For consumers:\n  - **Focus Twitter.** Discover a version of Twitter which pulls in everyone you follow and their content, but in a single daily digest rather than a time-sucking feed. Ready to dive back into the “normal” app? That’s fine too - these apps live in parallel and have all of the same content.\n  - **Follow everywhere.** Love Taylor Swift? Follow her across all of her accounts with one click.\n\nInteroperability at scale is possible, and it can enable a healthier and more diverse product ecosystem. As [As Jarrod Dicker notes](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU), it remains to be seen whether Web2 will still exist in the future as a parallel to Web3. But it’s clear Web3 is coming, and ultimately whether it is a full replacement will come down to what we as creators and consumers value from our media. So the next step is to take a look at the changing preferences and pressures that are starting to allow interoperability to become mainstream.\n\n## Substack and Web2.5 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5933528b-c4bb-4daa-9bc9-fedc11f3fafb.png?height=959&width=1600)\n\nMoney talks, and building your own business as a creator has traditionally been difficult. It requires stacking a number of different building blocks on top of each other — content creation, distribution, revenue generation, admin, and so on. [The cost of integrating or coordinating those different blocks](https://www.theproductkitchen.com/p/coases-penguin-is-learning-to-fly) has been prohibitively difficult for individuals or small groups of creators, which is why they have written for the New York Times, sung for Sony records, and acted for Disney.\n\nBut things are changing — consumers increasingly prefer to build trust with individuals or small groups. Packy put it best in “[Power to the Person:](https://notboring.mirror.xyz/SPV_-bchriVn_ncDj8OgnLccSb5qAsU0sXNpg9y_UTk)”\n\n> *“**People follow people, not companies,** but companies have long had the advantage because of all of the coordination it takes to build scaled products...Ben Thompson has said that media companies are the first to adapt to a new paradigm shift because of the relative simplicity of their products. They require very little coordination among parties, just the ability to capture and distribute one person’s thoughts, images, or dance moves.”*\n\nThe media boats that first floated across Web2 moats were the Substacks and Patreons. They are the first major media networks to build huge businesses by optimizing for creator success rather than consumer engagement. They are still fully vertical — they own the content and distribution — but creators can theoretically download the emails of their audience to take it with them.\n\nThe reason I call this Web2.5 is because the Substacks and Patreons are *open* but not *interoperable.* There’s nothing stopping me from downloading my Substack subscribers and posts and manually moving to a new platform. The data is *accessible* but not *interoperable*, and that makes all the difference when it comes to building the internet of tomorrow.\n\n## Social graphs in Web2 vs Web3 - a side by side comparison\n\nSo if interoperability is possible, exciting, and we see early signs of it happening, then what would true interoperability in media actually entail? Let’s break it down.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/15b880ab-551b-4edd-b946-179f56b4e23a.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nI admit, I’m not sure I can even imagine a future where *all* of the internet works in this way. We may always have fast food. But the point is that some of it will, because some of it already is. Now we’re finally ready to hold up the Mirror. \n\n## Mirror - the reflection of an interoperable future?\n\nMirror — the red hot “crypto Substack” which just [raised >$10M at $100M from A16Z](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/union-square-ventures-values-crypto-publishing-tool-mirror-at-100-million) and others — is starting to look more like “crypto Kickstarter and crypto Patreon meets crypto Substack.”\n\nHiding behind a distracting blur of new features, Mirror’s core structure is consistent and visionary. It's a bet worth understanding on the future of interoperable content graphs, internet-native money in the form of tokens, and the dynamic new businesses that will be possible because of them.\n\nMirror does look a whole lot like Substack from afar - it has a publishing tool and a way to generate revenue. The most obvious difference is that it has lots of fancy crypto tools to run crowdfunds, generate NFTs for your content, and get tips and other ways to generate revenue. \n\nOn closer examination, however, we can pass it through the same criteria as above and see that it’s not far off:\n- **A unique creator ID:** I use my public Ethereum address, which I own through my private key, to publish on Mirror. \n- **An open database of content, connected to my ID:** Mirror stores content on a decentralized storage system called [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/). If Mirror were to shut down tomorrow, I could access all of my articles by querying Arweave for the posts signed by my Ethereum address.\n- **Open social and economic graphs:** All of the important relationships built on Mirror are stored openly. Adding new members to the platform is done via their [$WRITE race](https://dev.mirror.xyz/vZxxUIeGMQK9NNLcrT0eDYZ6wXhXVr6vTQzztj1DaEA), a decentralized and publicly viewable vote where existing members carry more weight. When I split the proceeds of my article with another writer, or when an audience member buys an NFT in a crowdfund via my article — all of those things are signed via Ethereum addresses and stored publicly. Anyone could build apps on top of this data, for example a “Crunchbase for Creators” which shows how much funding each creator has gotten over time and from whom. \n- **Standards:** Mirror is both using and helping build open standards for the core technologies they use. They use Ethereum standards like ERC20 for fungible tokens, ERC721 for NFTs, signature standards for verifying data and so on. Some other areas like NFT sales and royalties don’t have standards yet, and Mirror is working to establish standards that can be used by others. Better standards means more adoption of those new technologies, which then benefits Mirror as the place with the best creator experience to leverage those technologies to build a business.\n\nThe key point to take away from this is that **owning the content is not important to Mirror’s strategic moat.** What differentiates Mirror and makes it a sticky product for creators is that it offers a number of ways to build a business that you can’t get anywhere else. Mirror dramatically lowers the coordination cost of creating a complex online business as a writer - hidden behind what looks like a content platform is actually a crowdfunding, e-commerce, and media platform all rolled up into powerful cryptographically backed tools. It’s Kickstarter, Patreon, and Substack all in one.\n\nAs a more concrete example, a film team [just raised $2M](https://ethereumfilm.mirror.xyz/3SV8gLXHIW8Ot45h3RL7aOgDINxN2hjLfFVOvyatB2A) to produce a documentary on Ethereum. Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter have contribution limits of $10,000, require a bank account and only support certain jurisdictions. On the other hand, Mirror’s crypto-native crowdfunding tool had programmable contribution limits (the highest contribution was over $200k), required just a crypto wallet, and was open to anyone with an internet connection.  \n\nPatrick Rivera — an engineer at Mirror and one of the best people to follow to understand this space — [calls this the “protocol economy.”](https://p.mirror.xyz/1EpvJwUpx_KlRcHOKLNqADEkwHL_Z1ZYKobF2uLwgBg) Companies like Mirror own publishing and distribution for now because they have to build vertical solutions given the UX problems that are so prevalent in crypto. Being vertically integrated allows Mirror to build easy and effective onramps into the powerful protocols that will serve as their strategic moats in the future. \n\nCrypto products that aren’t vertically integrated end up sending their users through a complex maze of different crypto apps that may have varying degrees of usability. Integrating the user journey into a single app allows crypto products to significantly improve the user experience to drive better acquisition, engagement, and retention over time. The key is to use open code and data standards to build a high-quality integrated experience.\n\nLaying out the open structure that currently hides under Mirror’s vertically integrated solution, you can see that the shift from being a publishing company to stewarding a vibrant protocol economy has very little to do with the content itself. It’s about building developer tools for teams to use their contracts and content tools. It’s about SDKs, APIs, sub-graphs, and documentation. Their competitors will be the Stripes and Stirs of the world, not Substack. At that point, there could be multiple different apps handling publishing and distribution, all routing through Mirror’s business layer to handle things like funding, governance, revenue splits, and so on. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7da76ad6-0cff-40d5-aa65-a3361f3cec9f.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n## Could interoperability ever dry the Web2 moat?\nThere are a number of reasons interoperability will not happen overnight, and may never happen at scale. A few key barriers include high transaction fees, difficulty managing a crypto wallet, and scarcity of talent in the space (although all of these are rapidly improving). Not to mention privacy, security, and moderation — those topics would take an entire piece on their own but there is good reason to believe those are technical limitations which can be tackled.\n\nThe momentum to tackle these challenges can only come from an exponential UX improvement as each new interoperable product is added to the ecosystem. In other words, the network effects of the interoperable ecosystem competing with the walled-garden network effects of Web2. Using your Ethereum wallet as your Mirror account is cool, but if you can use the same wallet to log into another important product you use, the benefit scales exponentially. At a certain point, you might actively prefer to use products that allow you to use your wallet in the same way you prefer to shop with businesses that accept your credit card. That’s the tipping point.\n\nI hope that companies like Mirror will work to push interoperability even as they focus on building onramps to crypto via vertically integrated solutions that can control the end user experience. If they can actively build seamless integrations with other open content platforms such as [Audius](https://audius.co/), it could dramatically accelerate the speed of adoption of a more open internet. \n\nThe more that open platforms rely on and develop the same technology, the more they are effectively investing in each other. They become a superorganism, a swarm. As Packy put it in [“Who disrupts the disruptors”](https://www.notboring.co/p/who-disrupts-the-disrupters), people wonder which new platform will challenge the giants, but  it is the swarm of open platforms that pose the biggest threat to a real tipping point.\n\nPlatforms like Mirror have such an enormous and important challenge ahead when it comes to interoperability. But it’s not all excitement - there are a number of major challenges to a more open model. Say what you will about the job they’re doing, but centralized platforms have unique advantages to privacy and moderation that will be very difficult to build into a more decentralized web. \n\nAmusingly, the best place I’ve found to read all about the challenges that would need to be overcome to build decentralized media platforms at massive scale is Twitter’s BlueSky project. [They have curated a huge amount of content into a GitLab project on open identities](https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community1/decentralized-ecosystem/-/blob/master/topics/data.md), moderation privacy, monetization, and more. So perhaps we shouldn’t sleep on the incumbents after all - and if nothing else we should gain some confidence from the fact that those with all of the money are giving this topic quite a lot of attention.\n\nPatrick and I will be hosting a hangout to discuss interoperability, Mirror, and some exciting new developments - follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin) or join the [Forefront discord](https://forefront.community) to grab a spot when we set the date. \n\n***\nIf you enjoyed this post, be sure to leave a tip.

Let’s break it down.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/15b880ab-551b-4edd-b946-179f56b4e23a.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nI admit, I’m not sure I can even imagine a future where *all* of the internet works in this way. We may always have fast food. But the point is that some of it will, because some of it already is. Now we’re finally ready to hold up the Mirror. \n\n## Mirror - the reflection of an interoperable future?\n\nMirror — the red hot “crypto Substack” which just [raised >$10M at $100M from A16Z](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/union-square-ventures-values-crypto-publishing-tool-mirror-at-100-million) and others — is starting to look more like “crypto Kickstarter and crypto Patreon meets crypto Substack.”\n\nHiding behind a distracting blur of new features, Mirror’s core structure is consistent and visionary. It's a bet worth understanding on the future of interoperable content graphs, internet-native money in the form of tokens, and the dynamic new businesses that will be possible because of them.\n\nMirror does look a whole lot like Substack from afar - it has a publishing tool and a way to generate revenue. The most obvious difference is that it has lots of fancy crypto tools to run crowdfunds, generate NFTs for your content, and get tips and other ways to generate revenue. \n\nOn closer examination, however, we can pass it through the same criteria as above and see that it’s not far off:\n- **A unique creator ID:** I use my public Ethereum address, which I own through my private key, to publish on Mirror. \n- **An open database of content, connected to my ID:** Mirror stores content on a decentralized storage system called [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/). If Mirror were to shut down tomorrow, I could access all of my articles by querying Arweave for the posts signed by my Ethereum address.\n- **Open social and economic graphs:** All of the important relationships built on Mirror are stored openly. Adding new members to the platform is done via their [$WRITE race](https://dev.mirror.xyz/vZxxUIeGMQK9NNLcrT0eDYZ6wXhXVr6vTQzztj1DaEA), a decentralized and publicly viewable vote where existing members carry more weight. When I split the proceeds of my article with another writer, or when an audience member buys an NFT in a crowdfund via my article — all of those things are signed via Ethereum addresses and stored publicly. Anyone could build apps on top of this data, for example a “Crunchbase for Creators” which shows how much funding each creator has gotten over time and from whom. \n- **Standards:** Mirror is both using and helping build open standards for the core technologies they use. They use Ethereum standards like ERC20 for fungible tokens, ERC721 for NFTs, signature standards for verifying data and so on. Some other areas like NFT sales and royalties don’t have standards yet, and Mirror is working to establish standards that can be used by others. Better standards means more adoption of those new technologies, which then benefits Mirror as the place with the best creator experience to leverage those technologies to build a business.\n\nThe key point to take away from this is that **owning the content is not important to Mirror’s strategic moat.** What differentiates Mirror and makes it a sticky product for creators is that it offers a number of ways to build a business that you can’t get anywhere else. Mirror dramatically lowers the coordination cost of creating a complex online business as a writer - hidden behind what looks like a content platform is actually a crowdfunding, e-commerce, and media platform all rolled up into powerful cryptographically backed tools. It’s Kickstarter, Patreon, and Substack all in one.\n\nAs a more concrete example, a film team [just raised $2M](https://ethereumfilm.mirror.xyz/3SV8gLXHIW8Ot45h3RL7aOgDINxN2hjLfFVOvyatB2A) to produce a documentary on Ethereum. Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter have contribution limits of $10,000, require a bank account and only support certain jurisdictions. On the other hand, Mirror’s crypto-native crowdfunding tool had programmable contribution limits (the highest contribution was over $200k), required just a crypto wallet, and was open to anyone with an internet connection.  \n\nPatrick Rivera — an engineer at Mirror and one of the best people to follow to understand this space — [calls this the “protocol economy.”](https://p.mirror.xyz/1EpvJwUpx_KlRcHOKLNqADEkwHL_Z1ZYKobF2uLwgBg) Companies like Mirror own publishing and distribution for now because they have to build vertical solutions given the UX problems that are so prevalent in crypto. Being vertically integrated allows Mirror to build easy and effective onramps into the powerful protocols that will serve as their strategic moats in the future. \n\nCrypto products that aren’t vertically integrated end up sending their users through a complex maze of different crypto apps that may have varying degrees of usability. Integrating the user journey into a single app allows crypto products to significantly improve the user experience to drive better acquisition, engagement, and retention over time. The key is to use open code and data standards to build a high-quality integrated experience.\n\nLaying out the open structure that currently hides under Mirror’s vertically integrated solution, you can see that the shift from being a publishing company to stewarding a vibrant protocol economy has very little to do with the content itself. It’s about building developer tools for teams to use their contracts and content tools. It’s about SDKs, APIs, sub-graphs, and documentation. Their competitors will be the Stripes and Stirs of the world, not Substack. At that point, there could be multiple different apps handling publishing and distribution, all routing through Mirror’s business layer to handle things like funding, governance, revenue splits, and so on. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7da76ad6-0cff-40d5-aa65-a3361f3cec9f.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n## Could interoperability ever dry the Web2 moat?\nThere are a number of reasons interoperability will not happen overnight, and may never happen at scale. A few key barriers include high transaction fees, difficulty managing a crypto wallet, and scarcity of talent in the space (although all of these are rapidly improving). Not to mention privacy, security, and moderation — those topics would take an entire piece on their own but there is good reason to believe those are technical limitations which can be tackled.\n\nThe momentum to tackle these challenges can only come from an exponential UX improvement as each new interoperable product is added to the ecosystem. In other words, the network effects of the interoperable ecosystem competing with the walled-garden network effects of Web2. Using your Ethereum wallet as your Mirror account is cool, but if you can use the same wallet to log into another important product you use, the benefit scales exponentially. At a certain point, you might actively prefer to use products that allow you to use your wallet in the same way you prefer to shop with businesses that accept your credit card. That’s the tipping point.\n\nI hope that companies like Mirror will work to push interoperability even as they focus on building onramps to crypto via vertically integrated solutions that can control the end user experience. If they can actively build seamless integrations with other open content platforms such as [Audius](https://audius.co/), it could dramatically accelerate the speed of adoption of a more open internet. \n\nThe more that open platforms rely on and develop the same technology, the more they are effectively investing in each other. They become a superorganism, a swarm. As Packy put it in [“Who disrupts the disruptors”](https://www.notboring.co/p/who-disrupts-the-disrupters), people wonder which new platform will challenge the giants, but  it is the swarm of open platforms that pose the biggest threat to a real tipping point.\n\nPlatforms like Mirror have such an enormous and important challenge ahead when it comes to interoperability. But it’s not all excitement - there are a number of major challenges to a more open model. Say what you will about the job they’re doing, but centralized platforms have unique advantages to privacy and moderation that will be very difficult to build into a more decentralized web. \n\nAmusingly, the best place I’ve found to read all about the challenges that would need to be overcome to build decentralized media platforms at massive scale is Twitter’s BlueSky project. [They have curated a huge amount of content into a GitLab project on open identities](https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community1/decentralized-ecosystem/-/blob/master/topics/data.md), moderation privacy, monetization, and more. So perhaps we shouldn’t sleep on the incumbents after all - and if nothing else we should gain some confidence from the fact that those with all of the money are giving this topic quite a lot of attention.\n\nPatrick and I will be hosting a hangout to discuss interoperability, Mirror, and some exciting new developments - follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin) or join the [Forefront discord](https://forefront.community) to grab a spot when we set the date. \n\n***\nIf you enjoyed this post, be sure to leave a tip.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin) or subscribe to [Penguins and Rabbit Holes](https://creativekitchen.so/penguins) to hear more thoughts on building public knowledge in the future.*\n\nInteroperability is the connecting thread of the future of the social web. It’s the reason Facebook and Twitter are not so secretly working to fundamentally transform their current products. It’s the argument I’ll give for the crypto publishing platform Mirror — where this post is published — being undervalued, despite raising a round at $100M a year after launch. Interoperability is the idea that to succeed in the future, builders will design individual lego pieces rather than entire sculptures.\n\nThe world of consumer tech can feel impossible to keep up with at the moment: NFTs, social tokens, crypto wallets, AR/VR, the metaverse. Those terms describe new products and experiences and will continue to change, but interoperability is the core mechanism that brings them together. It will drive the next wave of products, including and especially science where I spend most of my time. \n\nSo I’m going to try and make interoperability as cool as a pixelated punk. I want to lay out the steps to a tipping point — where you wake up one day and the internet is almost unrecognizable from how it is now. And to make those steps as concrete as possible in this abstract world, I’ll do it through the lens of Mirror, a company with a vision that makes the opportunity of interoperability obvious.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3323898e-e39a-4437-8d4c-ed3cc2c6b33a.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n## The dream of interoperability\n\nIn essence, “interoperable” means multiple products or services can make use of the same information.\n\nTake healthcare as an example. If I choose to switch doctors because my current one is a hack, I want my new doctor to have access to all of my medical history. It matters because it fosters competition and allows a more diverse ecosystem to evolve.  My doctors should compete based on who can make me healthiest, not who has exclusive access to my data. Healthcare also illustrates the challenge interoperability has faced with privacy, but more on that later.\n\nAs Ben Thompson notes in [The Web’s Missing Interoperability](https://stratechery.com/2021/the-webs-missing-interoperability/), interoperability was actually one of the core benefits mentioned at the start of the last wave of consumer tech, what many refer to as Web2.0. But we didn’t get interoperability from the big Web2 giants of Facebook, Twitter, and the like.  We got almost the exact opposite — business models built on capturing data, storing it in private databases, and charging advertisers for access to it. We are quick to point the finger at Facebook or Twitter, but blaming them is hardly different than blaming McDonalds for the rise of fast food. The system and especially consumer pressure clearly didn’t create the incentives for interoperable technology to thrive.\n\nMore than a decade later at the dawn of Web3, consumer demand for a healthier internet is growing and there are a few important data points that suggest interoperability at scale is finally possible. First, we see that the giants are exploring this space with quite a bit more energy and openness than you might expect. Twitter — [via their “BlueSky” project](https://twitter.com/bluesky) — is very openly researching how to build an open and interoperable standard for social media. Zuckerberg has recently been talking about Facebook becoming [\"becoming a metaverse company.\"](https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview) \n\nThe simple reason the social giants even consider such bold new directions is because interoperable graphs are better for creators, and creators are the scarce resource in the quickly arriving next iteration of the internet. The most valuable asset in a world of interoperable data will be the complex business relationships creators establish between their content, other creators, and their audience. Subscribers will be replaced by supporters, angel investors by angel audiences, and collaborators by co-owners. Big tech is many things but dumb isn’t one of them, and the giants realize that tapping into those flows of money is where the trillions will be made in the future.\n\nTo be clear, it’s hard to imagine how the transition to interoperability actually happens at these existing giants. While they have been building lots of new features in line with the creator-centric strategy above — tipping, subscriptions, funding for creators, better business tools — only time will tell whether they’ll be able to execute the dramatic shifts they are pretty openly exploring.\n\nThe next question after “is it possible?” is “why should we care?” What would happen if Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and the rest all opened up their vast databases? What new types of products could we imagine getting as creators and consumers from a more interoperable world? Just a few examples to paint a picture:\n- For creators:\n  - **Publish anywhere.** No matter where you publish or who you collaborate with, it is connected to your unique ID and distributed to your followers.\n  - **Auto-updated profiles.** Rather than manually building a LinkTree of your various projects, simply put in your universal creator ID and one is populated and updated automatically.\n- For consumers:\n  - **Focus Twitter.** Discover a version of Twitter which pulls in everyone you follow and their content, but in a single daily digest rather than a time-sucking feed. Ready to dive back into the “normal” app? That’s fine too - these apps live in parallel and have all of the same content.\n  - **Follow everywhere.** Love Taylor Swift? Follow her across all of her accounts with one click.\n\nInteroperability at scale is possible, and it can enable a healthier and more diverse product ecosystem. As [As Jarrod Dicker notes](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU), it remains to be seen whether Web2 will still exist in the future as a parallel to Web3. But it’s clear Web3 is coming, and ultimately whether it is a full replacement will come down to what we as creators and consumers value from our media. So the next step is to take a look at the changing preferences and pressures that are starting to allow interoperability to become mainstream.\n\n## Substack and Web2.5 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5933528b-c4bb-4daa-9bc9-fedc11f3fafb.png?height=959&width=1600)\n\nMoney talks, and building your own business as a creator has traditionally been difficult. It requires stacking a number of different building blocks on top of each other — content creation, distribution, revenue generation, admin, and so on. [The cost of integrating or coordinating those different blocks](https://www.theproductkitchen.com/p/coases-penguin-is-learning-to-fly) has been prohibitively difficult for individuals or small groups of creators, which is why they have written for the New York Times, sung for Sony records, and acted for Disney.\n\nBut things are changing — consumers increasingly prefer to build trust with individuals or small groups. Packy put it best in “[Power to the Person:](https://notboring.mirror.xyz/SPV_-bchriVn_ncDj8OgnLccSb5qAsU0sXNpg9y_UTk)”\n\n> *“**People follow people, not companies,** but companies have long had the advantage because of all of the coordination it takes to build scaled products...Ben Thompson has said that media companies are the first to adapt to a new paradigm shift because of the relative simplicity of their products. They require very little coordination among parties, just the ability to capture and distribute one person’s thoughts, images, or dance moves.”*\n\nThe media boats that first floated across Web2 moats were the Substacks and Patreons. They are the first major media networks to build huge businesses by optimizing for creator success rather than consumer engagement. They are still fully vertical — they own the content and distribution — but creators can theoretically download the emails of their audience to take it with them.\n\nThe reason I call this Web2.5 is because the Substacks and Patreons are *open* but not *interoperable.* There’s nothing stopping me from downloading my Substack subscribers and posts and manually moving to a new platform. The data is *accessible* but not *interoperable*, and that makes all the difference when it comes to building the internet of tomorrow.\n\n## Social graphs in Web2 vs Web3 - a side by side comparison\n\nSo if interoperability is possible, exciting, and we see early signs of it happening, then what would true interoperability in media actually entail?

Big tech is many things but dumb isn’t one of them, and the giants realize that tapping into those flows of money is where the trillions will be made in the future.\n\nTo be clear, it’s hard to imagine how the transition to interoperability actually happens at these existing giants. While they have been building lots of new features in line with the creator-centric strategy above — tipping, subscriptions, funding for creators, better business tools — only time will tell whether they’ll be able to execute the dramatic shifts they are pretty openly exploring.\n\nThe next question after “is it possible?” is “why should we care?” What would happen if Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and the rest all opened up their vast databases? What new types of products could we imagine getting as creators and consumers from a more interoperable world? Just a few examples to paint a picture:\n- For creators:\n  - **Publish anywhere.** No matter where you publish or who you collaborate with, it is connected to your unique ID and distributed to your followers.\n  - **Auto-updated profiles.** Rather than manually building a LinkTree of your various projects, simply put in your universal creator ID and one is populated and updated automatically.\n- For consumers:\n  - **Focus Twitter.** Discover a version of Twitter which pulls in everyone you follow and their content, but in a single daily digest rather than a time-sucking feed. Ready to dive back into the “normal” app? That’s fine too - these apps live in parallel and have all of the same content.\n  - **Follow everywhere.** Love Taylor Swift? Follow her across all of her accounts with one click.\n\nInteroperability at scale is possible, and it can enable a healthier and more diverse product ecosystem. As [As Jarrod Dicker notes](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU), it remains to be seen whether Web2 will still exist in the future as a parallel to Web3. But it’s clear Web3 is coming, and ultimately whether it is a full replacement will come down to what we as creators and consumers value from our media. So the next step is to take a look at the changing preferences and pressures that are starting to allow interoperability to become mainstream.\n\n## Substack and Web2.5 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5933528b-c4bb-4daa-9bc9-fedc11f3fafb.png?height=959&width=1600)\n\nMoney talks, and building your own business as a creator has traditionally been difficult. It requires stacking a number of different building blocks on top of each other — content creation, distribution, revenue generation, admin, and so on. [The cost of integrating or coordinating those different blocks](https://www.theproductkitchen.com/p/coases-penguin-is-learning-to-fly) has been prohibitively difficult for individuals or small groups of creators, which is why they have written for the New York Times, sung for Sony records, and acted for Disney.\n\nBut things are changing — consumers increasingly prefer to build trust with individuals or small groups. Packy put it best in “[Power to the Person:](https://notboring.mirror.xyz/SPV_-bchriVn_ncDj8OgnLccSb5qAsU0sXNpg9y_UTk)”\n\n> *“**People follow people, not companies,** but companies have long had the advantage because of all of the coordination it takes to build scaled products...Ben Thompson has said that media companies are the first to adapt to a new paradigm shift because of the relative simplicity of their products. They require very little coordination among parties, just the ability to capture and distribute one person’s thoughts, images, or dance moves.”*\n\nThe media boats that first floated across Web2 moats were the Substacks and Patreons. They are the first major media networks to build huge businesses by optimizing for creator success rather than consumer engagement. They are still fully vertical — they own the content and distribution — but creators can theoretically download the emails of their audience to take it with them.\n\nThe reason I call this Web2.5 is because the Substacks and Patreons are *open* but not *interoperable.* There’s nothing stopping me from downloading my Substack subscribers and posts and manually moving to a new platform. The data is *accessible* but not *interoperable*, and that makes all the difference when it comes to building the internet of tomorrow.\n\n## Social graphs in Web2 vs Web3 - a side by side comparison\n\nSo if interoperability is possible, exciting, and we see early signs of it happening, then what would true interoperability in media actually entail? Let’s break it down.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/15b880ab-551b-4edd-b946-179f56b4e23a.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nI admit, I’m not sure I can even imagine a future where *all* of the internet works in this way. We may always have fast food. But the point is that some of it will, because some of it already is. Now we’re finally ready to hold up the Mirror. \n\n## Mirror - the reflection of an interoperable future?\n\nMirror — the red hot “crypto Substack” which just [raised >$10M at $100M from A16Z](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/union-square-ventures-values-crypto-publishing-tool-mirror-at-100-million) and others — is starting to look more like “crypto Kickstarter and crypto Patreon meets crypto Substack.”\n\nHiding behind a distracting blur of new features, Mirror’s core structure is consistent and visionary. It's a bet worth understanding on the future of interoperable content graphs, internet-native money in the form of tokens, and the dynamic new businesses that will be possible because of them.\n\nMirror does look a whole lot like Substack from afar - it has a publishing tool and a way to generate revenue. The most obvious difference is that it has lots of fancy crypto tools to run crowdfunds, generate NFTs for your content, and get tips and other ways to generate revenue. \n\nOn closer examination, however, we can pass it through the same criteria as above and see that it’s not far off:\n- **A unique creator ID:** I use my public Ethereum address, which I own through my private key, to publish on Mirror. \n- **An open database of content, connected to my ID:** Mirror stores content on a decentralized storage system called [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/). If Mirror were to shut down tomorrow, I could access all of my articles by querying Arweave for the posts signed by my Ethereum address.\n- **Open social and economic graphs:** All of the important relationships built on Mirror are stored openly. Adding new members to the platform is done via their [$WRITE race](https://dev.mirror.xyz/vZxxUIeGMQK9NNLcrT0eDYZ6wXhXVr6vTQzztj1DaEA), a decentralized and publicly viewable vote where existing members carry more weight. When I split the proceeds of my article with another writer, or when an audience member buys an NFT in a crowdfund via my article — all of those things are signed via Ethereum addresses and stored publicly. Anyone could build apps on top of this data, for example a “Crunchbase for Creators” which shows how much funding each creator has gotten over time and from whom. \n- **Standards:** Mirror is both using and helping build open standards for the core technologies they use. They use Ethereum standards like ERC20 for fungible tokens, ERC721 for NFTs, signature standards for verifying data and so on. Some other areas like NFT sales and royalties don’t have standards yet, and Mirror is working to establish standards that can be used by others. Better standards means more adoption of those new technologies, which then benefits Mirror as the place with the best creator experience to leverage those technologies to build a business.\n\nThe key point to take away from this is that **owning the content is not important to Mirror’s strategic moat.** What differentiates Mirror and makes it a sticky product for creators is that it offers a number of ways to build a business that you can’t get anywhere else. Mirror dramatically lowers the coordination cost of creating a complex online business as a writer - hidden behind what looks like a content platform is actually a crowdfunding, e-commerce, and media platform all rolled up into powerful cryptographically backed tools. It’s Kickstarter, Patreon, and Substack all in one.\n\nAs a more concrete example, a film team [just raised $2M](https://ethereumfilm.mirror.xyz/3SV8gLXHIW8Ot45h3RL7aOgDINxN2hjLfFVOvyatB2A) to produce a documentary on Ethereum. Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter have contribution limits of $10,000, require a bank account and only support certain jurisdictions. On the other hand, Mirror’s crypto-native crowdfunding tool had programmable contribution limits (the highest contribution was over $200k), required just a crypto wallet, and was open to anyone with an internet connection.  \n\nPatrick Rivera — an engineer at Mirror and one of the best people to follow to understand this space — [calls this the “protocol economy.”](https://p.mirror.xyz/1EpvJwUpx_KlRcHOKLNqADEkwHL_Z1ZYKobF2uLwgBg) Companies like Mirror own publishing and distribution for now because they have to build vertical solutions given the UX problems that are so prevalent in crypto. Being vertically integrated allows Mirror to build easy and effective onramps into the powerful protocols that will serve as their strategic moats in the future. \n\nCrypto products that aren’t vertically integrated end up sending their users through a complex maze of different crypto apps that may have varying degrees of usability. Integrating the user journey into a single app allows crypto products to significantly improve the user experience to drive better acquisition, engagement, and retention over time. The key is to use open code and data standards to build a high-quality integrated experience.\n\nLaying out the open structure that currently hides under Mirror’s vertically integrated solution, you can see that the shift from being a publishing company to stewarding a vibrant protocol economy has very little to do with the content itself. It’s about building developer tools for teams to use their contracts and content tools. It’s about SDKs, APIs, sub-graphs, and documentation. Their competitors will be the Stripes and Stirs of the world, not Substack. At that point, there could be multiple different apps handling publishing and distribution, all routing through Mirror’s business layer to handle things like funding, governance, revenue splits, and so on. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7da76ad6-0cff-40d5-aa65-a3361f3cec9f.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n## Could interoperability ever dry the Web2 moat?\nThere are a number of reasons interoperability will not happen overnight, and may never happen at scale. A few key barriers include high transaction fees, difficulty managing a crypto wallet, and scarcity of talent in the space (although all of these are rapidly improving). Not to mention privacy, security, and moderation — those topics would take an entire piece on their own but there is good reason to believe those are technical limitations which can be tackled.\n\nThe momentum to tackle these challenges can only come from an exponential UX improvement as each new interoperable product is added to the ecosystem. In other words, the network effects of the interoperable ecosystem competing with the walled-garden network effects of Web2. Using your Ethereum wallet as your Mirror account is cool, but if you can use the same wallet to log into another important product you use, the benefit scales exponentially. At a certain point, you might actively prefer to use products that allow you to use your wallet in the same way you prefer to shop with businesses that accept your credit card. That’s the tipping point.\n\nI hope that companies like Mirror will work to push interoperability even as they focus on building onramps to crypto via vertically integrated solutions that can control the end user experience. If they can actively build seamless integrations with other open content platforms such as [Audius](https://audius.co/), it could dramatically accelerate the speed of adoption of a more open internet. \n\nThe more that open platforms rely on and develop the same technology, the more they are effectively investing in each other. They become a superorganism, a swarm. As Packy put it in [“Who disrupts the disruptors”](https://www.notboring.co/p/who-disrupts-the-disrupters), people wonder which new platform will challenge the giants, but  it is the swarm of open platforms that pose the biggest threat to a real tipping point.\n\nPlatforms like Mirror have such an enormous and important challenge ahead when it comes to interoperability. But it’s not all excitement - there are a number of major challenges to a more open model. Say what you will about the job they’re doing, but centralized platforms have unique advantages to privacy and moderation that will be very difficult to build into a more decentralized web. \n\nAmusingly, the best place I’ve found to read all about the challenges that would need to be overcome to build decentralized media platforms at massive scale is Twitter’s BlueSky project. [They have curated a huge amount of content into a GitLab project on open identities](https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community1/decentralized-ecosystem/-/blob/master/topics/data.md), moderation privacy, monetization, and more. So perhaps we shouldn’t sleep on the incumbents after all - and if nothing else we should gain some confidence from the fact that those with all of the money are giving this topic quite a lot of attention.\n\nPatrick and I will be hosting a hangout to discuss interoperability, Mirror, and some exciting new developments - follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin) or join the [Forefront discord](https://forefront.community) to grab a spot when we set the date. \n\n***\nIf you enjoyed this post, be sure to leave a tip.

Balancer differs from Uniswap in that liquidity pools can have up to 8 assets deposited in them, and the desired ratio between those assets can be set by the person that creates it. This allows users to create custom investment vehicles that can act like index funds, which comes with the added benefit of being able to maintain the ratios of the assets in their portfolio by having arbitragers effectively manage the fund for them.\n\n## Using Balancer on Polygon\nIn this tutorial, we will cover how to swap on Balancer on the Polygon network. Polygon is an EVM smart contract-enabled side chain that is very similar to Ethereum. This means that you can use familiar tools like MetaMask to approve transactions. An added benefit is that the transaction fees on Polygon are much lower than on Ethereum.\n\nIn order to use Balancer on Polygon, you'll need to have assets on Polygon. You can do this by using a bridge, which you can find here: [Ethereum <> Polygon bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/).\n\nIf this is your first time using Polygon, check out [this guide](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/Hm0zb1vkvx0yoj9EfvqCt119vsMdcD0Cp9Sk25hyNic).\n\n## How to swap on Balancer\n\n**Step 1: Go to Balancer**\n\nTo access Balancer on the Polygon network, go to [https://polygon.balancer.fi](https://polygon.balancer.fi).\n\n**Step 2: Connect your wallet**\n\nMake sure your wallet is on the Polygon Network. If you’re using MetaMask, it should look like this. You can use the dropdown to toggle between networks.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b912031e-0fbd-4314-9d9f-aa0abd2a3d27.png?height=694&width=710)\n\nOn the Balancer page, click “Connect wallet”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/96930f0d-5019-480c-a6ac-aa6845ede97d.png?height=1794&width=2756)\n\nSelect the wallet you’d like to use.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8c7815ad-5e9f-4524-af83-d94d18f36e13.png?height=1788&width=2754)\n\n**Step 3: Go to “Trade”**\n\nNow that your wallet is connected, you can swap on Balancer. To do this, select “Trade” at the top of the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/325fec49-a0b1-489e-920b-657644d4b570.png?height=1794&width=2756)\n\n**Step 4: Swap**\n\nIn the Balancer interface, enter the token and amount you’d like to send and receive. Then select “Preview Trade”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d346b95e-e0c8-4baf-b1f0-41d317e248aa.png?height=1796&width=2758)\n\nNext you’ll need to approve the swap, which gives Balancer access to the funds you are sending (in my case, USDT). You might need to wait a minute or two for this transaction to complete.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/adb0e27a-2f7d-4641-bd8e-48480876135f.png?height=1792&width=2754)\n\nOnce the “Approve” transaction completes, you will be prompted to confirm the trade. Click “Confirm trade”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/38ee716f-2cd1-47d7-8627-ee79ec3ab0d8.png?height=1796&width=2738)\n\n**Congrats!

They're called Pioneers. You can see all the guides published by Pioneers on the [Pathfinders RabbitHole Publication](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/)\n\n**Here's the way it works:**\n\n- Pathfinders decide which tasks are the highest priority\n- RabbitHole funds bounties to create the content for each task\n- RabbitHole pays it out by buying an edition of the content on Mirror for 0.1 ETH\n\nIn the first two weeks, there have been 14 guides published, and pathfinders have made +$7,500 from NFT edition sales. Pioneers are on a mission to create content for every single on-chain task, generating a library of resources to guide users through their journey.\n\nIn the near future, we’ll be launching the other roles of Pathfinder including:\n\n- **Craftsmen** (creating NFTs to be used in quests and marketing assets)\n- **Stewards** (creating quests & proposals to DAOs to bring in quests to RabbitHole)\n- **Navigators** (creating subgraphs & queries to track on-chain interactions at scale)\n\nThis is the time to step up if you're interested in onboarding the next wave of participants into the crypto ecosystem.\n\nIf you're interested in applying for the Pathfinder Program, feel free to reach out to [@chasechapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman) or [@flynnjamm](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm).\n\nUntil next week!\n\n[The First Pioneers](split://0xe1EA3639040E0FF2Cb1cd69068d018fEA0921d2c?network=mainnet)\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1629130849, "digest": "7SXBygHOf-PMwuGCUnw69IzwL_rnU7B1LKGAd6nqkXo", "contributor": "0xF719d5d368dA5c7006bFBb7e0A4873b5115Aa11f"}

To make a long story short, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to disaggregate signal from noise.\n\n[Andrew Chen](https://a16z.com/author/andrew-chen/), General Partner at [Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/), wrote last year:\n\n> “We’re living in [a pivotal time in the history of mass communication](https://a16z.com/2019/07/16/substack/) — what we believe is the golden age of new media.”\n\nWith more *creators*, more *content*, and more *choice* than ever before, consumers are now being consumed by a state of analysis paralysis. The real scarcity isn’t content anymore. It’s attention. When it’s impossible to absorb everything from the flood of information, the best we can do is pick and choose what matters to us most — or, better yet, **find the people who can do the curating for us.** [Mario Gabriele](https://twitter.com/mario_gabriele\\_/status/1295031676989345792?s=20) from [The Generalist](https://www.readthegeneralist.com/) said it best:\n\n> **“We’re all consuming more media, and** **there’s an increasing willingness to pay for high-quality content.** The last year has also seen an explosion of great writers and analysts in the space — I believe we’re at the start of a creator breakout.”\n\n* * *\n\n## **As the amount of content grows, so does the market for credible curators.**\n\nA great case study is [Nathan Baschez](https://twitter.com/nbashaw) and [Dan Shipper’s](https://twitter.com/danshipper) [Everything Bundle](https://everything.substack.com/). In April, they decided to offer a bundled version of their newsletters, expecting a few extra subscribers from the experiment. Instead, they grew together from [600 to 1,000 paying subscribers](https://digiday.com/media/how-substack-has-spawned-a-new-class-of-newsletter-entrepreneurs/) within the first month. With all this talk of *unbundling* (some examples are the unbundlings of [college](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1232193193606729728?s=20), [G Suite](https://foundationinc.co/lab/unbundling-gsuite), [Reddit](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit?utm_source=angellist), and [venture capital](https://medium.com/@marvinliao/the-slow-steady-unbundling-aka-democratization-of-venture-capital-9dcdede874af)), Nathan and Dan’s intentional *bundling* proved to be a striking success.\n\nThe Everything Bundle case study is one of my favorites, but it’s not the only one, by any means. [Channels Stack](https://www.channelsstack.com/) is a curated site for educational content on YouTube, organizing hundreds of channels into defined categories. [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/) is a daily newsletter from someone who [reads 1,000 articles a day](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/the-man-who-reads-1000-articles-a), choosing his five favorites and sending them out with a short summary. Oftentimes, these linked articles don’t have a paywall of their own at all — but subscribers of The Browser pay to have them sent in a curated list.\n\nThe demand is certainly there: Channels Stack launched on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/channels-stack) with a 5.0/5 average rating and nearly 400 upvotes, and The Browser has successfully figured out how to monetize free existing content (with over [40,000 followers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheBrowser) to boot).\n\nWe can go even further back — classic examples of successful curation businesses are record shops and [bookstores](https://pen-online.com/travel/morioka-shoten-the-book-shop-with-only-one-book/), and examples in tech include Spotify (for music), Netflix (for TV and movies), and Uber (which bundled its UberEats offering into one app, thus increasing Uber’s TAM, or total addressable market).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*S9v6cEdZr4ffVHV5UeVrMg.jpeg)\n\n**In my view, however, the business of *influencer* bundling has only just begun.** Curators are the new creators, and as consumers, we’re going to be willing to pay someone with good taste to help us sort through the ever-growing mass of information at our fingertips.\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Psychology Behind the Need for Curation**\n\nAs it turns out, there’s some [psychological ground](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/4/2/the-death-of-the-newsfeed) to all of this. Think of it as a carefully mixed cocktail of the following:\n\n*   [Zuckerberg’s Law](https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/06/mark-zuckerberg-explains-his-law-of-social-sharing-video/), or the tendency to **share more** and more on social media over time\n*   [Dunbar’s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number), or the average number of stable **social relationships one can maintain** at a given time (it’s around 150)\n*   [Zipf’s Law](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/05/31/facebook-values-itself-based-on-metcalfes-law-but-the-market-is-using-zipfs/#1e12bdff68f5), which describes how in any system of resources there are a **small number of items of high value**, and a “long tail” of many more of low value (slightly tangential but related reading: [Metcalfe’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law), which has now [largely been refuted](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-is-wrong) as a method of evaluating social networks, but in 2012 helped to rationalize Facebook’s insane over-valuation in its IPO)\n\nTo me, online content consumption seems to exist on a pendulum of sorts: we love content to the extreme — *Unbundle!! Give us more! —* until we are overwhelmed with choice and analysis — *It’s too much!! Bundle it back up again! —* and swing to the opposite side. In the end, we always end up somewhere in the middle… but it’s a lot of swinging back and forth on this creation/curation pendulum until we get there.\n\n> “There are only two ways to make money in business: One is to bundle; the other is to unbundle.” — [Jim Barksdale](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling)\n\nHaving said this, and looking at the current information overload we all face on a day-to-day basis, I think there’s room for a **new market of *creators as curators***. So, with that said, what does this look like for an influencer or brand?\n\n## **How Do You Curate — and Why?**\n\nThere isn’t one sole motivation behind why creators, influencers, and brands may want to curate. In fact, curation can:\n\n*   Build a **personal** **brand** or **audience.**\n*   **Fulfill a** **need** in a particular market. For example, [Femstreet](https://femstreet.substack.com/) is a weekly digest of timely posts from female investors and operators. It’s racked up thousands of subscribers and has been featured in Fortune, Forbes, and Crunchbase.\n*   Create an **extra category** within an existing business.\n*   Become an additional **revenue source.** As we saw with [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/) example, it’s possible to monetize free content if it’s curated well — consumers are willing to pay someone who has good taste, and it’s an easy way to add a revenue stream to your business.\n\nTo learn more, I asked my *own* audience about their favorite curated content:\n\nBelow is a categorized list of some of the responses I received. My favorites are in bold:\n\n**Newsletters: **[Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/signup?utm_expid=.ZTQPzZIzTFOdxoi4D0Ey0Q.1\\&utm_referrer=), [**Everything Bundle**](https://everything.substack.com/)**, **[LetterDrop](https://twitter.com/letterdropio), [**Femstreet**](https://femstreet.substack.com/)**, **[Brain Pickings](https://twitter.com/brainpickings), [**The Generalist**](https://www.readthegeneralist.com/)**,** [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/), [Snaxshot](https://twitter.com/thesnaxshot/status/1297660476671897602?s=20), [The Profile](https://readtheprofile.com/), [The Takeoff](https://thetakeoff.substack.com/), [Social Studies](https://socialstudies.news/), [Techmeme](https://www.techmeme.com/)\n\n**Podcasts: **[Podcast Notes](https://podcastnotes.org/), [**TLDL**](https://twitter.com/TLDLdotAPP)**,** [Shuffle](https://twitter.com/getshuffleapp), [Podshots](https://podshots.substack.com/), [Podcast Review](https://podcastreview.org/)\n\n**Crowdsourced Curation: **[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), [**Bookshlf**](https://twitter.com/joinbookshlf)**,** [Listory](https://www.listory.com/en/), [MyHighlights](https://twitter.com/UseHighlights)\n\n\\[*Note:* there are even more responses in the Twitter thread above, in case you’re curious and want to check out more!]\n\n## Making Curation Profitable\n\nThe best brands (and individual influencers, at that) are the best at an always-evolving curation as a service. Nathan and Dan’s Everything Bundle seems to be a playbook in itself, as outlined by [Ari Lewis](https://twitter.com/amlewis4) in [this thread](https://twitter.com/amlewis4/status/1296485567258034177):\n\n1.  Find initial traction\n2.  Shift the emphasis from the individual to the greater media brand\n3.  Scale and continue to add value\n\nOne way to [monetize curation](https://www.listory.com/l/beceae7e-3c84-4595-996d-d00c4123d967?share=2e9b2a53-32fe-49cc-9186-ceadf1ca09c3) is through a paid newsletter, with the Everything Bundle as a great example. Other opportunities include blogs, ebooks, e-commerce stores, and consultations/speaking gigs. I even came across [ReadBase](https://readbase.landen.co/) during my research, which allows curators to monetize their bookmarks and reading lists. In any case, curators can find success by building up a targeted online presence and then providing curated content to that audience.\n\n* * *\n\nIt’s clear that curating content within a particular niche can be an incredible way to build an audience and add value. Content curation hooks people in with the promise of learning new skills while saving time, and it keeps them coming back by building a sense of community around a particular subject or vertical. As outlined in this [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling) interview with Marc Andreessen and Jim Barksdale, bundling and curation can be a strategic decision for your business, as long as it’s done correctly.\n\nCuration, in a sense, is its own form of [intertextuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertextuality), or the shaping of a text’s meaning by another text. Content doesn’t exist on the Internet in a vacuum: it takes up space, and it forms a [web of influence and connections](https://laetitiaatwork.substack.com/p/emails-overload-newsletters-and-impostor). We have the content.
