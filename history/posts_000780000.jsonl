I learned more about myself than I could have ever hoped too. This post, supposed to come out nine months ago, should have been a triumph. Unfortunately, the first five months of 2021 were the hardest months of my life. I consistently fell into cycles of negative thinking. I couldn't escape from myself. The cerebral qualities that I developed in 2020 were the same ones that inflicted pain on me in 2021. If 2020 is my Year of Growth, then 2021 is my Year of Maturing. The fact that this post is available now for people to read is a triumph of sorts. I wrote most of this content in December; I just couldn't package it up. I know the ending now.*\n\n***\n\n## Year of Growth\n\n2020 was a year where I thought about what I actually want, particularly in my relationships and my career. I'm excited about the things I set in motion and what's to come.\n\nTo gather my thoughts for the New Year, I found [Steve Schalfman](https://schlaf.me/)'s [Ultimate Annual Review](https://annualreview.life/) invaluable. This post follows the guide exactly. I want to live openly because it creates a social contract, and the assumed peer pressure holds me accountable.\n\n## Moments & Milestones\n\n*   I spent time with Meghana for ten months.\n*   I joined the [club soccer team](https://www.gtclubsoccer.com/).\n*   I became a teaching assistant for an introductory computing class.\n*   I [interned](https://rajitkhanna.com/nasa/) at NASA and helped create an internet for the moon.\n*   I [started](https://rajitkhanna.com/creation/) this blog.\n*   I created my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RajitWrites) account to engage with my [genzmafia](https://genzmafia.com/) friends.\n*   I began time-restricted eating and lost twenty pounds.\n*   I started my [podcast](https://rajitkhanna.com/tag/podcast/).\n*   I joined [BLISSWAY](https://www.blissway.com/), a startup that helps people protect their time.\n\n## Reflections & Learnings\n\n2020 fundamentally changed my relationship with myself. I grew as a friend, brother, son, boyfriend, writer, hacker, and marketer. I wanted to focus on the lessons I learned, so I can shape 2021 along these axes.\n\n### The Power of Writing\n\nIn August, I started writing here, after I saw Daniel Bourke's [blog](https://www.mrdbourke.com/). I wrote as a means of [investigation](https://rajitkhanna.com/book/wreck/), following lingering questions to their natural conclusions. I uncovered [why I have to be good at something to value myself](https://rajitkhanna.com/perfection/),  [why learning to live is just learning to die](https://rajitkhanna.com/rosie/), and [how the negative voice in the back of my head is my own](https://rajitkhanna.com/hamlet/). This process revealed a beautiful heuristic; I don't really know anything if I can't fully explain it to someone else. Crafting a cogent reply to a difficult question requires transmuting my experience into language.\n\nThe written word continues to amaze me; language is enduring, and this act of making something enduring is called art. Now I practice my art everyday. I still don't feel fully in control of the form, but I can see that the sentences come more naturally now than they did before. In 2020, I wrote and chose to share my writing publicly. I will never forget the response.\n\n![My friend's Instagram message after I posted the blog on my story.](https://rajitkhanna.com/content/images/2021/01/blog-reply-1.jpeg)\n\nMy friend's Instagram message after I posted the blog on my story.\n\nThe idea that someone understood what I was trying to create touched my heart. I'm still overjoyed when I think about texts and direct messages my friends sent me. This website is a living document of me; I want to let people see how my thoughts and capacity to shape language evolve. This way people can see me and the questions I'm asking; this website catalogues my most authentic self, and I hope it outlives me.\n\n### Finding a Mentor\n\nI first heard the term ubuntu when I saw Netflix's documentary series *The Playbook* and its episode featuring Doc Rivers. Ubuntu is a South African word that means \"I am, because you are.\" The spirit of ubuntu captures the reality that I experienced ; I learn how to be a person from other people. Other people teach me what it means to live well. When I started this blog, I thought the desire to write, despite being a technical person, separated me from other engineers. I thought I would eventually have to choose between one or the other, because I could not be both. Now I recognize that writing is understanding, and the desire to understand is what connects me with all technologists.\n\nThis year I learned how to be a technologist from [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/), [Stepan Parunashvili](https://stopa.io/), and [Slava Akhmechet](https://www.spakhm.com/archive?sort=new). Paul Graham's essays on wealth creation challenged my long-held beliefs about the agents of change in our society. Stepan Parunashvili showed me how exciting it is to visualize [technical ideas](https://stopa.io/post/269) and bring them into real life. Slava Akhmechet exemplifies what [Justin Murphy](https://rajitkhanna.com/podcast/justin/) calls an \"edge\" and taught me how to be an independent-thinker. The beautiful part is that I never interacted with any of them – they're writing is there for me to read and re-read. Stepan knows who I am, Slava might recognize my name, and PG will likely never know my it. That's okay. What they've shown me matters more than they could even realize.\n\nWhen I joined genzmafia, I found a community of optimists. These people believed deeply in technology's power to make the world a better place. It was so refreshing to escape from the dystopian media portrayal of technology. I aligned myself with my internet friends. I spoke to Nathan Leung, Yash Godiwala, Samay Shamdasani, Sudarshan Sridharan, Wade Fletcher, Nikolas Huebecker, Andrew Roberts, Akshaya Dinesh, Eric Trimbs, Ciara London and Dival Banerjee. These people all explode outwards my conception of what it means our age and what it means to influence change. They are my greatest mentors.\n\n### The Theory of Anti-discipline\n\n[Daniel Bourke](https://www.mrdbourke.com/) first introduced me to the theory of anti-discipline. He didn't call it anti-discipline (that was [Alexander Cortes](https://cortes.site/)), but he said life improves with [subtraction](https://www.mrdbourke.com/if-youre-in-doubt-about-something-get-rid-of-it/). It's a beautiful idea to consider because it reveals how much clutter I let into my life. It's easier to start from first principles; the ones I identified for myself are reading, writing, and exercise. Daniel Bourke simplifies them to movement and making.\n\n## Intentions for 2021\n\nThis list is terse for a reason. It contains the only thing that matters and an area of growth for every year of my life.\n\n### Love Better\n\nDuring COVID, when I was trapped at home I thought often about what I wanted. I thought about the career I wanted; I thought about the body I wanted; I thought about the house I wanted. Love is counterintuitive for me, because I didn't know how to want something for someone else more than I wanted it for myself. To use [Derek Sivers' language](https://sive.rs/time), I was too future-focused to be present with other people.\n\nI want to be a better brother. When Ronit was a toddler he followed me everywhere. When I read Geronimo Stilton on the couch, even though he couldn't read, he opened a picture book and sat beside me. When I lied to him, he treated my word as gospel. Last year I realized he still hadn't stopped, although he was more covert about it. Ronit inherited the classes he takes, the sports he plays, and even the way he talks from me. I believe Ronit secretly wonders if he'll ever be as smart, athletic, or good-looking as me. I can only imagine his disappointment when he realizes he'd kept running the race so long after he'd won. I can only wonder what he'll do next.\n\nI want to be a better friend. I stopped talking to all of my friends during quarantine. In the beginning, we called every weekend, but during the summer I spoke to almost no one. When I returned to school last semester, I thought I needed to make it up to my friends. They just wanted to see my face and hear my voice again. The realization almost brought me to tears.\n\nI want to be a better son. Writing about my parents is difficult because I still can't comprehend what they've given me. What I do know is making my parents happy means fully realizing the person I can become. I want to be the person people can rely on during troubling times. I want to be the person who gives others hope. I want to be the person who makes others feel strong.\n\nI would write about being a better boyfriend, but there's a whole chapter about Meghana in my book. I'll only say that spending time with Meghana makes me so happy I come home singing and scare my dog.\n\n## My 2021 Goals\n\nDerek Sivers reminded me that goals only matter if they spur me into action in the present moment. I can think of plenty of things that I'd love to do, but many of these ideas are like shooting stars, wonderful to admire but irrevocably distant. When I think of what I can't not do, I realize I can't not write the book I've been talking about for [over a year now](https://rajitkhanna.com/book/).\n\nPeople ask me all the time what my book is about. The book answers questions I have for myself. It's a sacred weapon that acts on me. This book is my way of explaining myself to me first and then to others. The book will be a non-fungible token (NFT) on [Mirror](https://rajit.mirror.xyz/). It will also be available for free on my [website](https://rajitkhanna.com/book/), and I will print a limited number of copies for my friends. I'm planning to release the book serially, starting next week.\n\n## Reading\n\nAfter middle school, I stopped being a voracious reader. It wasn't just me – when I went to Houston, Edward and Faiz said the same things about themselves. I want to love reading again. I don't want to sleep because I can't stop reading. I want to go to bed anticipating what will happen next in the story. I want to walk around the family room in a trance because I'm imagining myself as a character in the book.\n\n### Reading List\n\n*   *Hell Yeah or No*, Derek Sivers\n*   *How to Live, *Derek Sivers\n*   *Wanting, *Luke Burgis\n*   *Skin in the Game*, Nassim Taleb\n*   *Meditations*, Marcus Aurelius\n\n### Re-reading List\n\n*   *The Other Wes Moore*, Wes Moore\n*   *Letters from a Stoic*, Seneca\n*   *Hackers & Painters*, Paul Graham\n*   *The Grand Design*, Stephen Hawking\n\n## Fin\n\nGrowth is non-linear. Last year, I felt I took ten steps forward, and at the beginning of this year I thought I'd taken ten steps back. Now I feel like I'm growing into the person I want to be again. The best knowledge from the past year and a half is the self-knowledge I've developed. I know how to move forwards if I'm feeling sad. I know how to dissect my thoughts and I know how to get out of my head. I know what areas of my life matter most to me and which ones I can't waste my finite energy on.\n\nIn 2020, I started to describe myself as an artist because I knew I could change the way people saw themselves. It was easier than I thought. In fact, I could do it by telling them how I saw myself. I learned I could weave magic. I enter my workshop and pick up my tools. I alchemize experience into language with my keyboard. I'm dedicating the rest of 2021 to weave this power more strongly than ever before.\n", "timestamp": 1632980954, "digest": "rQIrUAf7M0qbWg7gHtZfI8-JYs3xOUdf-mZwy8URQlA", "contributor": "0x28ACE08ae71e962a8079BC654914D41F76714ac0"}

And this, of course, is a big change with lots of second-order effects. As people have been forced into a rapid transition to working from home, society is having to quickly answer lots of new questions: what does it mean for [second-tier cities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/workers-are-fleeing-big-cities-for-small-onesand-taking-their-jobs-with-them-11567848600)?

[High-end lighting and video rigs](https://medium.com/@Haje/video-conferencing-ff604f6177d3)?\n\nBut while it’s true that the future of work is remote, this is a very thin, not-even-wrong two-dimensional view of where we’re headed. The problem is that people describing the future of work are mostly sitting behind big, wooden desks in sleek, modern air-conditioned offices. Or, rather, now in home offices. With COVID-19, it doesn’t take a lot of vision to see that the [remote](https://twitter.com/jillruthcarlson/status/1220500661697040385?s=20) [future](https://twitter.com/levie/status/1258412832913162241?s=20) [of](https://twitter.com/fdestin/status/1254182604158513157?s=20) [work](https://twitter.com/sarthakgh/status/1254463353013129216?s=20) is here—at least for the [37% of people](https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2020/04/24/what-percentage-of-workers-can-realistically-work-from-home-new-data-from-norway-offer-clues/#61329a0178fe) who can work from home in the US.\n\nThe truth is that the future of work *is* remote, but the [Zoom boom](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=zoom&geo=US) is one small and not particularly meaningful or long-term example of what remote work will mean. The gig economy is the best harbinger of things to come. I’ve spent the last five years building [software for gig workers](https://shoppers.instacart.com/), and I’ll share some of what I’ve learned about how this software is the first fully-formed example of the real future of work we’re headed towards.\n\n# Why do companies exist?\n\nBut first, we need to talk about [Ronald Coase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase) and his theory of transaction costs. In the wake of the Great Depression, Ronald Coase was curious about a simple question: why do companies exist? As odd as it may seem, traditional economic theory predicted that companies shouldn’t exist because an “efficient” market would make it cheaper to contract out all jobs instead of hiring people.\n\nIn his essay *[The Nature of the Firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm)*, for which he earned a Nobel prize in economics, Coase explained that companies existed because of transaction costs, the friction of the economy. Contracting out work costs more than just the price you pay the contractor—you also have to spend time and money finding people, negotiating contracts, teaching them how to do the work, and making sure they do a good job. So companies make a deal: employees get a flat sum of money for a loosely defined “job”, and then the company can generally have them do the things that need to be done, without re-negotiating for every task.\n\nFor many decades, this theory became gospel, justifying ever-larger companies that could internalize and minimize transaction costs. Companies got so good at, well, being companies, that minimizing the hiring-and-firing costs started having weird side effects. When the option value of minimizing transaction costs by keeping employees around outweighs the deadweight loss of people stuck in an [Office Space-inspired corporate purgatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsayg_S4pJg), you end up with [bullshit jobs](https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-bullshit-job-boom).\n\n# Uber and the one-click contract\n\nBy 1999, the year Office Space was released, we were in the thick of the first internet bubble—and if there’s one thing the internet is good at, it’s reducing the cost of information exchange. Companies like Craigslist and e-lance had started to realize that one nice use-case for easy information exchange was connecting people with jobs. Decades later, job postings are still the [primary way Craigslist makes money](https://www.craigslist.org/about/help/posting_fees), and newspapers are still reeling from [the loss of classified ads](https://www.niemanlab.org/2011/03/slip-and-slide-newspaper-industry-increases-production-of-scary-charts/) as a primary job search channel.\n\nBut online classifieds were small potatoes in the game of reducing Coasean transaction costs. The real innovation came in 2009 when Uber turned not just the job search process, but *the entire concept of a job* into a slick, nearly frictionless transaction. To put it simply, here are two contracts:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hwwn2MW1Lk2wNiDmxbGpW.png?height=984&width=1350)\n\nOne is trapped in the vague uncertainty of human language, covers a broad range of unknown possible duties, and has ambiguous success criteria. The other one is incredibly straightforward: you tap a button, you perform a task, you get paid.\n\n**Algorithmic management**\n\nAt this point, without getting too technical, we should familiarize ourselves with the broad categories or types of [transaction costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost):\n\n* **Search costs**: finding the best option on the market\n* **Bargaining costs**: agreeing on the details of the transaction\n* **Enforcement costs**: making sure the agreement is met\n\nIf you squint a little bit, these “costs” are not so different from the job description of a corporate manager:\n\n* **Search:** Find & hire people for a job\n* **Bargain:** Agree on role, responsibilities, and compensation\n* **Enforce:** Teach them how to do the job, evaluate & incentivize performance\n\nManagers exist because these things are challenging to do. Management is considered one of the “safest” jobs, likely to be spared by the onslaught of automation. People are idiosyncratic and individual—managing them effectively requires the skill, finesse, and art of human emotion. Selling people on the mission of your organization, motivating them to work, helping them grow and develop in their roles, and evaluating their performance are surely things that require a human hand.\n\nAt least that’s conventional wisdom. I think the robots are coming for management jobs.\n\nWhen people imagine the technology of the future, they often have the right idea about the use-case, but completely whiff on the form-factor. The film *2001: A Space Odyssey* correctly predicted video calls (and even put them in space!), but laughably maintained the idea that they [would happen from payphones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwo6JpMceg). It’s ludicrous to imagine a robot wandering around an office talking to corporate, approving memos, leading workshops, and remembering birthdays ([like a boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NisCkxU544c)).\n\nBut in its insatiably hungry way, software is eating your boss’ work. Algorithmic management is already here, and it reduces transaction costs to the absolute minimum. I know this because I lead teams whose primary goal is to reduce this friction: we optimize steps in onboarding flows to allow people to start working faster, we add pay boosts to orders when we need to get them accepted quickly, we incentivize high-quality shopping with better access to future work. The remaining human qualities of management, those things that can’t be automated, are left to the individual—the freedom and flexibility of *being your own boss*. This is the #1 reason people prefer gig work.\n\nThe gig economy has become the latest punching bag in the *Evil Tech Company* narrative. Of course, the situation is much more nuanced than this. Lacking an existing societal framework within which to operate, we are writing the book as we go. We have tried to be thoughtful, conscientious, and fair as we’ve navigated this new world, but we have made mistakes. Algorithms have the potential to be more meritocratic and less biased than humans, but they are also impersonal. Figuring out the future path for algorithmically managed gig work is a huge challenge, but I have found that my co-workers are drawn to this work with high ideals and intentions for how we can help people better support themselves and their families.\n\nBased on what you hear about the gig economy these days, you might be surprised to learn that all of the major gig companies are [backing a ballot initiative](https://protectdriversandservices.com/) to guarantee earnings significantly above local minimum wages (plus tips!), provide benefits to gig workers, and maintain the flexibility and independence that gig workers want. I believe that this ballot initiative is the first step towards a third-way of work, a solution to the current regulatory gap between contractors and employees where algorithmically managed work fits.\n\n# Where we go next\n\nI think it’s particularly important for us to figure out this third-way because I believe many more jobs will fit its mold in the future. The ability for algorithmically managed work to lower transaction costs and enable networks of loosely connected gig workers to coordinate on complex tasks is too powerful to be a passing fad.\n\nThe economic principles of a hundred years ago that predicted a lack of large corporations under the conditions of reduced transaction friction are no longer hypothetical. We will see fewer corporations bearing the weight of umpteen layers of corporate management and [free-riders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem) and more cases of work being molded into the characteristics of low-friction gig work:\n\n* Small, well-defined, atomic units of work\n* A la carte mixing and matching of jobs by workers and companies\n* Algorithmic and reputational systems for evaluating success\n* Clear pricing and incentive structures tied to success metrics\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine how a wide range of jobs could be structured this way. Customer support could become an a la carte marketplace, where workers sitting on their couches choose which company’s users to help based on the pay-rates of the individual tickets. Ironically, even software engineering may not be immune: well-defined specs could be translated into code that meets certain verification and validation tests and earns its author pre-defined payments and reputation points based on the quality assessed during a code review by a trusted arbiter.\n\nBut this is just the beginning. Economic structures are complex adaptive systems that exhibit bottom-up emergent phenomena that are hard to predict in advance. As the gig economy becomes just *the economy*, highly liquid software-driven work may create second-order effects that mirror existing technological and financial structures:\n\n* New credit and banking services\n* Secondary markets and work arbitrage\n* Complex derivative financial products\n* New layers of data mining and advertising\n* Commoditization on both sides of the market\n* Smart contracts and new forms of trustless collaboration\n* Intense incentives for reputation-gaming, identity theft, and fraud\n* A rethinking of employer-based healthcare & the social safety net\n\nSome of these things will help provide people with unparalleled job flexibility, financial liquidity, and global work opportunities. But new layers of financialization and impersonal markets, particularly if not carefully considered by companies and well-versed policy-makers, have the potential to lead to damaging outcomes. As always, technology is not inherently good or evil but is capable of being used as a means for a wide range of ends.\n\nSo far, I’ve been disappointed and concerned by the ways that regulators have implemented well-intentioned but [poorly crafted policy](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB5) in the first attempts to control algorithmically managed gig work. But we’re in the early innings, and I hope that as this type of work becomes the norm, companies, workers, and policymakers develop the language, philosophy, and policy structures to create the third-way of work: flexible, autonomous, meritocratic, fair, profitable, and frictionless.", "timestamp": 1633024377, "digest": "BN1Z2POaQbYBbZfUe7Cjir5GbRP2JjSgaDAZRmRs4tk", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

In short, I was looking for a traditional school experience. So far, that’s been about 10% of the value of the course.\n\nI was surprised to find that the other 90% hasn’t come directly from David—it has come from other members of the class. As we’ve engaged in small group video chats and commented on each other’s drafts and started interest groups on [Circle](https://circle.so/), a Facebook-like tool designed for this very purpose, it’s become increasingly clear that the value of this course has more to do with the community than the classes. And that’s not because David is a bad teacher, it’s because he’s a great community builder.\n\nThis idea is in the same ballpark as one popularized by Chris Dixon about building social networks: [come for the tool, stay for the network](https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network). Instagram started as a way to get cool filters for your photos and only later became the dominant network for people to share photos with each other. [Cold-starting social networks](https://andrewchen.co/how-to-solve-the-cold-start-problem-for-social-products/) is notoriously hard, so you often need to figure out how to provide single-player utility before you can turn it into a [multi-player game](https://cdixon.org/2010/06/12/designing-products-for-single-and-multiplayer-modes).\n\nOnline courses and communities follow the same property. There seem to be two main lessons to learn here: if you want to build educational content, turn it into a community; if you want to build an online community, start with educational content.\n\n**Multi-player education**\n\nAs schools of all shapes and sizes across the U.S. consider what Fall 2020 will look like in light of our inability to effectively control COVID-19, we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try new models of education. I am not an educator by trade, and I’ve seen my friends who are give eye-rolls every time someone says they have a shiny new educational model to save the day. I’m not here to promise a panacea or silver bullet, and I understand that what works for a highly motivated set of adults that paid thousands of dollars to proactively join an online course likely doesn’t apply to middle school kids living in poverty with disengaged parents. But, I also think professional educators should pause for a second and ask if they can learn anything from courses that people happily pay thousands of dollars for.\n\nUnfortunately, we seem to have taken the [worst aspects of in-person education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_model_school) and designed online education in the same image. Rows of desks facing a chalkboard have become isolated computer screens streaming pre-packaged videos. Online education is too often a lonely, uninspiring single-player utility that ends up feeling something like this:\n\n[https://youtu.be/dxPVyieptwA](https://youtu.be/dxPVyieptwA)\n\nIt’s the default and it’s easy—everyone puts themselves on mute on a Zoom call and someone lectures. They might feign attempts at engagement (“…Anyone? Anyone? The…Hawley Smoot Tariff Act…”), but it’s no match for dozens of students sitting at their computers with their video turned off, one click away from dank memes and TikTok dances.\n\nThe irony of this is that the internet offers the tools for even better collaborative opportunities than in-person education. We think of education as a knowledge transfer product, but it’s actually a social product—and we’ve spent the last twenty years as a society mastering the art of online social communication. Now, online courses are blazing the trail by using tried-and-true internet tools to test new pedagogical methods that move all of education forward.\n\nAnd while I’m probably massively oversimplifying how some of these lessons could be applied to more traditional educational environments, there’s a compelling emerging model of successful social education:\n\n**Cohorted classes.** It’s pretty obvious that social education requires people interacting synchronously, but it’s equally tempting to think that one of the core advantages of online education is that it doesn’t require traditional “classes” of students completing the same work at the same time.\n\nMOOCs (do people still call them MOOCs?), particularly the ones operated by universities, seem to make this fatal error. They record videos of professors’ lectures and post them online with a syllabus and some homework assignments and think they’ve made an “online class”. The problem is that an educational environment all but requires other people doing the same thing at the same time, people with which you can discuss and collaborate and learn from. You need to have peers that can hold you accountable to stick with it and a structured timeline that doesn’t allow you to put off the learning. These are the parts of traditional educational model worth preserving.\n\nWhen I was signing up for *Write of Passage*, I couldn’t figure out why anyone would pay an extra thousand dollars to be able to join future cohorts after completing the class the first time, particularly since you can still access the course material either way. Now it’s pretty clear: the chance to meet and engage with the new cohorts of students, as well as the forcing function of mindset and accountability that the community provides is actually where most of the value comes from.\n\n**Asynchronous social spaces.** While you need people to go through the educational experience across a defined period of weeks or months, you should still take as much advantage as possible of the opportunity to create virtual social spaces for people to interact. The aforementioned [Circle](https://circle.so/) is a great example of this.\n\nIf you’re doing online education right, you’re attracting a diverse audience of learners from around the world. This will include people across a myriad of timezones, working professionals, parents with kid-driven schedules, and an unknowable set of other time constraints that require the flexibility for students to engage with the class whenever works for their lives.\n\nBut even in cases where you can more fully control and account for schedules (like, say, students paying [$72,000 per year to go to virtual-Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance)), I still think there’s immense value in having asynchronous social network engagement. If you can create actual unmoderated conversation among students, you’ve found the holy grail. Of course, you have to be willing to tolerate (even encourage!) off-topic conversation for it to really work, and the fear of unmoderated discussion runs ironically deep in many academic institutions.\n\nSchools have relied on tools like [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) and [Blackboard](https://www.blackboard.com/) for online educational community engagement, but some combination of the tools and the methods of use remain embarrassingly under-powered, forced, and lacking anything that could truly be described as organic engagement. Asking students to write a 500-word post on Moodle is not creating engagement, it’s just changing the format for turning in an assignment.\n\n**Flipped classrooms.** This one is almost too obvious to include, but given the number of educational institutions fumbling the ball as we approach the start of the new school year, it’s worth re-iterating: remote learning is the perfect environment for asynchronous lectures and live collaboration on project-based work, known as the [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) model.\n\nThere is absolutely zero reason to ever make a large crowd of people all get on a video call at the same time to sit through a static lecture or presentation. It is a boring, horrid waste of people’s simultaneous attention.\n\n**Scaled interaction opportunities.** Different students operate most effectively at different scales of social interaction, and you need to meet people where they are across the introvert-extrovert spectrum. Some will thrive in the conversational environment of regular breakout rooms of 2-4 people. Others will become class clowns or eagerly frequent contributors in the chat section of full-group live classes. Others may not say much (or even attend) the live sessions, but build their own niches of community within the gathering space of your social network.\n\nOnline classroom environments make this much easier than physical ones. Create a range of spaces for people to give each other detailed feedback, compare notes, debate ideas, and collaborate. If you favor only—for instance—in-class live discussions, you bias your classroom towards certain kinds of students and make everything feel stilted and painfully inauthentic. People will find their own way to get out of the experience what they put into it. Let them do this and then evaluate based on the product they create, not the process they used to get there.\n\n**Building an online community**\n\nIn short, what I’m suggesting is that online learning works best when you build an online community. Beware that this isn’t easy—online communities are rare and wondrous specimens of the internet. I don’t mean social networks like Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn. I’m talking about communities with deep and distinct cultures: places like Hacker News, MetaFilter, and 4chan. Some sub-reddits would qualify. Loosely bounded entities like (sports, tech, black, finance, science)-twitter sit in an amorphous grey-area.\n\nI know about these ecological niches of cyberspace because I spent most of middle and high school lurking on early iterations of global web-based communities (Digg, Hacker News, MetaFilter, Reddit). I’ve even tried to start my own online community. I was fresh out of college and idealistically confident about the future of online discourse. I envisioned a beautiful sci-fi fantasy that heavily borrowed from the Net of *Ender’s Game*: great writers and deep online debate driving socio-political decision-making. I was young, naive, and I certainly [wasn’t expecting this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/08/this-is-trumps-most-spectacularly-wonderfully-terrible-tweet-ever/).\n\nBut even if I’d tried to start an online community with slightly more modest ambitions and a more realistic understanding of people’s desires for online engagement, I would have failed. The online communities that seem to really stick are the ones built around an existing pool of content and its author. Both [Reddit and Hacker News](https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/18/the-evolution-of-hacker-news/) were seeded by the community of people who read Paul Graham essays. Digg grew (and imploded) around the figure of [Kevin Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rose). We should find this behavior of community building unsurprising, given that [religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible) and [cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneesh) have usually taken the same approach.\n\nWere I to ever try to build an online community again, I wouldn’t launch the community until I already had one. I’d write, and gain followers, and then set up the infrastructure to enable them to communicate with each other. Bringing together people around a shared set of mental models may be the only way to get them to stick around and actually want to talk. In other words, I’d probably try to build something that looked a lot like *Write of Passage*.\n\n**Learning to internet**\n\nThe irony of my love of online communities is that I was mostly a [lurker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurker), which sounds creepy but just means I read content and rarely posted. I feel some regret about this, but the [general rule of thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)) is that 90% of people in online communities lurk, only 10% engage at all, and 1% create almost all of the content. Like most people, I treated online communities like television—I was a consumer, passively scrolling and absorbing. I didn’t share my thoughts. I didn’t feed the trolls.\n\nAs a result, the greatest value I’ve gotten from *Write of Passage* has nothing to do with writing. It has been a full blossoming of realization that the internet should not be a passive medium, it should be approached as an opportunity to actively engage with the world.\n\nIn the past week, I have gotten feedback on my blog posts from half a dozen writers in the class, had a twitter debate about unit economics with a private equity guy, gotten live coding help from a programmer and photographer somewhere in the West Central Africa timezone, discussed trial law with a lawyer in Dallas, submitted bug reports via slack to the team running a piece of open-source software, talked about life with a doctor in Edinburgh, learned about acquiring small SaaS businesses from a guy in Phoenix…and on, and on.\n\nIn these conversations, particularly with my fellow *Write of Passage* course-mates, there is a kind hive mind. I can always find an area of mutual intellectual interest overlap, we can usually recommend a blog post to each other about the topic we’re discussing. It feels like I’m finally living in what Venkatesh Rao refers to as the [Giant Social Computer in the Cloud](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/against-waldenponding).\n\nThe GSCC, or some similar manifestation of it, seems to be the future we are heading into. As [traditional jobs turn into freelance internet gigs](https://meatspacealgorithms.com/2020/07/06/get-ready-for-gig-work/), learning how to plug your brain into this giant cultural cyborg may be as important to workers in the [Information Age](https://meatspacealgorithms.com/2020/06/30/mega-cycles-of-technological-revolutions/) as preparing for a factory setting was to workers of the Industrial Age.\n\nAs we approach school returning in the fall, figuring out how to educate kids is one of the biggest and most important questions society faces. And if actively engaging, creating, debating, networking, and marketing yourself are keys to 21st century success, then schools have an incredible opportunity to change the educational model to fit this mold.", "timestamp": 1633024633, "digest": "f11v21KaAKESdgGEvPjk-LznUHlwhLD5gz_fL7T-Ob0", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}
{"id": "yjsqoCHH07QBkAmjlaqxntI6J9kqQdBuY6XbLKTc0k4", "title": "From last-mile to last-minute logistics", "body": "*\\[originally published July 11th, 2020\\]*\n\nThe great challenge of logistics has historically been the *last-mile*: in a fractal expansion of road networks, how do you traverse the last bit of distance to every home? It is an under-rated marvel of modern civilization that this challenge has been largely and quietly accomplished in developed countries like the United States (and is slowly but surely being solved even in [remote corners of the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/technology/delivering-amazon-india.html)).\n\nMy parents live on a ranch in Texas, a two-hour drive from the nearest metropolis and then miles down a winding dirt road covered in cactus and cow poop. After crossing seven [cattle grids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_grid), three creek beds, and a lot of desolate land, you arrive at their front gate to find a large mailbox designed to receive packages. The rest of the family rolled our eyes when my dad installed the mailbox a few years ago, but Amazon recently started delivering right to the front gate (!)\n\nIt takes a literal army of post office workers and Amazon delivery drivers to pull this off, a behemoth of coordination and corporate will. But the savvy American consumer, aided by the unyielding mechanics of modern capitalism, always wants *more* stuff *faster* and *cheaper*. People have increasingly decided they don’t just want things brought right to their house. They want those things *right now*. Last-mile logistics is becoming last-minute logistics, and solving for speed requires a very different approach than solving for geographic coverage.\n\n**Traveling Salesmen and $0.55 stamps**\n\nTo get a mental image of the challenge of the original *last-mile* problem, imagine if Amazon somewhat arbitrarily covered the United States in circles with a 1 mile radius. If every home was covered by one of these circles, and there was a delivery drop-off point at the center of each circle, everyone would be within a mile of a place where they could pick up deliveries. There would be, give-or-take, a million of these circles across the USA (3.8 million mi² / 3.14 mi²).\n\nA million delivery drop-off locations is nothing to sneeze at. But there are 130 million households in the US, so taking this approach instead of delivering to each household individually would make Amazon’s delivery routes about 100x easier (I am oversimplifying a bit here, but the general idea holds). That last mile is a real pain, but for better or worse, people have come to expect things delivered not just to their neighborhood, but to their house.\n\nIf you have enough volume of packages (and people aren’t particularly picky about *exactly* when the stuff arrives), you can load all the stuff in a truck, pretend you are a *[Traveling Salesman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)*, and drive around in a defined route that ends up looking something like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gZiZOw25jHZB2k1b-mp65.png?height=953&width=1024)\n\nThe density of your delivery locations is important, because you can subsidize the fixed costs of driving all over the place across more deliveries. Think of your friendly neighborhood mail-person. Because she delivers to essentially every house, the “cost” of adding your house to her route is small—she already has to drive past your house as she goes from your right-side neighbor to your left-side neighbor.\n\nIn other words, there is a tremendous economy of scale to route-based deliveries. Once you reach critical mass of delivery density, you’ve taken the extremely challenging last-mile problem and turned it into a last-foot problem (the distance from your curb to your mailbox). And there’s probably something else being delivered to your mailbox at the same time, so the incremental cost of dropping in one more letter is negligible. This is why mailing a letter across the country and having it hand-delivered to someone’s house costs the shockingly low price of $0.55 (despite common misconception, the Postal Service receives [no tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations](https://facts.usps.com/top-facts/)).\n\n**How speed beats scale**\n\nVery few organizations have reached the kind of density that allows you to solve the last-mile problem with route-based deliveries: The Post Office. UPS. FedEx. Amazon. Even within this sparse list, everyone is ultimately relying on the [Post Office’s last-mile infrastructure](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/USPS-postal-service-deliveries-logistics/531785/) (though Amazon has taken the leap into building out their own end-to-end last-mile systems, at the cost of [billions of dollars ](https://searchaws.techtarget.com/feature/Amazon-bets-big-on-last-mile-delivery-service-improvements)*[per quarter](https://searchaws.techtarget.com/feature/Amazon-bets-big-on-last-mile-delivery-service-improvements)*).\n\nIf you’re an AMZN bull (and I am, for the record) their logistics network is one their greatest moats. But there’s a problem with this moat: on the ever-accelerating hedonic treadmill of consumer preferences, people (ironically aided by Amazon’s [relentless](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2014/06/19/relentlesscom) focus on reducing delivery times and killing delivery fees) have increasingly decided they want their stuff to show up immediately.\n\nThis need for speed has changed the name of the game: last-mile logistics has become last-minute logistics. When people want things in the next hour or two, you don’t have the luxury of giant, highly efficient, pre-planned traditional traveling salesman routes. If people want stuff now, you have to solve a much harder problem and you have to solve it much faster.\n\nThe already [notoriously hard and computationally expensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness) *Traveling Salesman Problem* of last-mile logistics is a walk in the park compared to the mind-boggling *Stochastic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Multiple Trips*. The SCVRPTWMT (if you want an easy-to-remember shorthand) is how we solve last-minute logistics problems [at Instacart](https://tech.instacart.com/space-time-and-groceries-a315925acf3a), and it looks something like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fj5pUf45q5eIKI0-nhIY5.png?height=683&width=1528)\n\nIn plain english, the problem is essentially: how do you get stuff to people by a certain time in the very near future while the rest of the world is constantly changing around you?\n\nSolving this problem is not just computationally harder than solving more traditional last-mile logistics problems, it also requires a fundamentally different approach. Top-down, infrastructure-heavy, meticulously-planned logistics becomes brittle and unadaptable to the needs of last-minute delivery.\n\n**Why Webvan imploded and AmazonFresh withered**\n\n[Webvan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webvan) was the epitome of Dot Com mania. It went public in 1999 at a valuation of $4.8 billion on cumulative revenue of $395,000 and cumulative net losses of more than $50 million. In a mere 18 months, the company burned over $800 million in cash before going bankrupt in a spectacular display of excess that looked something like this:\n\n[https://youtu.be/ndVhgq1yHdA](https://youtu.be/ndVhgq1yHdA)\n\nAs has been throughly diagnosed in [business school cases](https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/) ever since, Webvan committed suicide via massively over-expanded logistics infrastructure. They bought parking lots full of refrigerated delivery trucks and filled massive warehouses with a billion dollars worth of top-of-the-line technology:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/keISkRxv_2gZHiDsN4vQy.png?height=354&width=615)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/O_DMgqP2Fj4nrzqxiNp1W.png?height=349&width=460)\n\nJeff Bezos, who presumably had immense piles of cash lying around and not enough ways to light it on fire, [decided to hire the same people who ran Webvan and run the same playbook](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2013/06/17/four-lessons-amazon-learned-from-webvans-flop/#6c4aacf68147)—rebranded as AmazonFresh—[with unsurprisingly similar results](https://www.vox.com/2017/11/3/16601488/amazon-fresh-cancellation-shut-down-grocery-delivery-whole-foods). Why did both of these companies make the same mistakes?\n\nBecause they were attempting to follow the tried-and-true playbook of last-mile logistics:\n\n1. Invest heavily in top-down infrastructure\n2. Forecast, plan, and optimize routes\n3. Gain massive efficiency at massive scale\n4. [???](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/profit)\n5. Profit\n\nWhile this playbook has historically worked well for last-mile logistics (as we saw with the Post Office and Amazon’s traditional delivery business), it fails when you need to get people things quickly, either due to consumer preferences or the need to keep items temperature-stable (as with grocery and restaurant delivery). Your impressive infrastructure and meticulous plans go from being an asset to a liability.\n\n**Limiting liabilities with last-minute logistics**\n\nIf you want to solve problems like the *Stochastic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Multiple Trips*, you need to make some adjustments to the logistics playbook by optimizing for real-time flexibility and adaptability over maximum theoretical efficiency. The [first rule](https://cerasis.com/effective-last-mile-logistics/) of *last-mile* logistics is that meticulous planning is essential. The first rule of *last-minute* logistics is that meticulous planning is impossible.\n\nThe first problem with planning is that the world is constantly changing. The USPS has built complex planning algorithms that run on very large and fast computers, and it still takes them most of a day to create their route plans. The problem is that by the time they calculate the routes, more packages have come into their system, and the whole thing is woefully outdated. A delayed map is increasingly [divorced from the territory](https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/).\n\nThe second problem is that forecasting is hard, and the further out into the future you go, the harder it gets. Knowing what will happen two weeks from now is much harder than knowing what will happen two days from now, which is much harder than knowing what will happen two hours from now. The magic of last-minute logistics is using real-time signals to focus on accurate predictions of the near-term over precise predictions of the longer-term.\n\n> The magic of last-minute logistics is using real-time signals to focus on accurate predictions of the near-term over precise predictions of the longer-term.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t predict demand patterns for two weeks from now. It just means you shouldn’t trust or rely on those predictions too much, and you should be able to quickly adapt in real-time to meet the needs that actually arise. Don’t pre-design complicated optimal routes, just try to do the best you can with the options available in the moment.\n\nRelying on real-time signals allows you to have a more accurate picture of the evolving stochastic state of the world, but it also requires you to be able to use those signals effectively. You need to have adaptive operational structures and flexible infrastructure. Instacart has succeeded where Webvan and AmazonFresh failed by building a [low-friction bottom-up marketplace](https://meatspacealgorithms.com/2020/07/06/get-ready-for-gig-work/) instead of a top-down centrally-planned economy. Instacart’s constantly evolving delivery routes, on-demand shoppers, and real-time incentives give it the flexibility to meet customer demand precisely when it occurs.\n\nThis ephemeral infrastructure is not only better suited to last-minute logistics, it also is much easier to bootstrap. Instead of needing to amortize billions of dollars worth of infrastructure across extremely high density deliveries, you can start small and local. And if you do this well, you can use your lightweight infrastructure to outmaneuver the trillion-dollar behemoth of Amazon’s logistics powerhouse, like guerilla warriors outflanking traditional armies.", "timestamp": 1633024553, "digest": "6lFakW53HevnBMp7LhLQ84v_LUFXh4MzXVHvM3OpByo", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

Now, online courses are blazing the trail by using tried-and-true internet tools to test new pedagogical methods that move all of education forward.\n\nAnd while I’m probably massively oversimplifying how some of these lessons could be applied to more traditional educational environments, there’s a compelling emerging model of successful social education:\n\n**Cohorted classes.** It’s pretty obvious that social education requires people interacting synchronously, but it’s equally tempting to think that one of the core advantages of online education is that it doesn’t require traditional “classes” of students completing the same work at the same time.\n\nMOOCs (do people still call them MOOCs?), particularly the ones operated by universities, seem to make this fatal error. They record videos of professors’ lectures and post them online with a syllabus and some homework assignments and think they’ve made an “online class”. The problem is that an educational environment all but requires other people doing the same thing at the same time, people with which you can discuss and collaborate and learn from. You need to have peers that can hold you accountable to stick with it and a structured timeline that doesn’t allow you to put off the learning. These are the parts of traditional educational model worth preserving.\n\nWhen I was signing up for *Write of Passage*, I couldn’t figure out why anyone would pay an extra thousand dollars to be able to join future cohorts after completing the class the first time, particularly since you can still access the course material either way. Now it’s pretty clear: the chance to meet and engage with the new cohorts of students, as well as the forcing function of mindset and accountability that the community provides is actually where most of the value comes from.\n\n**Asynchronous social spaces.** While you need people to go through the educational experience across a defined period of weeks or months, you should still take as much advantage as possible of the opportunity to create virtual social spaces for people to interact. The aforementioned [Circle](https://circle.so/) is a great example of this.\n\nIf you’re doing online education right, you’re attracting a diverse audience of learners from around the world. This will include people across a myriad of timezones, working professionals, parents with kid-driven schedules, and an unknowable set of other time constraints that require the flexibility for students to engage with the class whenever works for their lives.\n\nBut even in cases where you can more fully control and account for schedules (like, say, students paying [$72,000 per year to go to virtual-Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance)), I still think there’s immense value in having asynchronous social network engagement. If you can create actual unmoderated conversation among students, you’ve found the holy grail. Of course, you have to be willing to tolerate (even encourage!) off-topic conversation for it to really work, and the fear of unmoderated discussion runs ironically deep in many academic institutions.\n\nSchools have relied on tools like [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) and [Blackboard](https://www.blackboard.com/) for online educational community engagement, but some combination of the tools and the methods of use remain embarrassingly under-powered, forced, and lacking anything that could truly be described as organic engagement. Asking students to write a 500-word post on Moodle is not creating engagement, it’s just changing the format for turning in an assignment.\n\n**Flipped classrooms.** This one is almost too obvious to include, but given the number of educational institutions fumbling the ball as we approach the start of the new school year, it’s worth re-iterating: remote learning is the perfect environment for asynchronous lectures and live collaboration on project-based work, known as the [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) model.\n\nThere is absolutely zero reason to ever make a large crowd of people all get on a video call at the same time to sit through a static lecture or presentation. It is a boring, horrid waste of people’s simultaneous attention.\n\n**Scaled interaction opportunities.** Different students operate most effectively at different scales of social interaction, and you need to meet people where they are across the introvert-extrovert spectrum. Some will thrive in the conversational environment of regular breakout rooms of 2-4 people. Others will become class clowns or eagerly frequent contributors in the chat section of full-group live classes. Others may not say much (or even attend) the live sessions, but build their own niches of community within the gathering space of your social network.\n\nOnline classroom environments make this much easier than physical ones. Create a range of spaces for people to give each other detailed feedback, compare notes, debate ideas, and collaborate. If you favor only—for instance—in-class live discussions, you bias your classroom towards certain kinds of students and make everything feel stilted and painfully inauthentic. People will find their own way to get out of the experience what they put into it. Let them do this and then evaluate based on the product they create, not the process they used to get there.\n\n**Building an online community**\n\nIn short, what I’m suggesting is that online learning works best when you build an online community. Beware that this isn’t easy—online communities are rare and wondrous specimens of the internet. I don’t mean social networks like Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn. I’m talking about communities with deep and distinct cultures: places like Hacker News, MetaFilter, and 4chan. Some sub-reddits would qualify. Loosely bounded entities like (sports, tech, black, finance, science)-twitter sit in an amorphous grey-area.\n\nI know about these ecological niches of cyberspace because I spent most of middle and high school lurking on early iterations of global web-based communities (Digg, Hacker News, MetaFilter, Reddit). I’ve even tried to start my own online community. I was fresh out of college and idealistically confident about the future of online discourse. I envisioned a beautiful sci-fi fantasy that heavily borrowed from the Net of *Ender’s Game*: great writers and deep online debate driving socio-political decision-making. I was young, naive, and I certainly [wasn’t expecting this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/08/this-is-trumps-most-spectacularly-wonderfully-terrible-tweet-ever/).\n\nBut even if I’d tried to start an online community with slightly more modest ambitions and a more realistic understanding of people’s desires for online engagement, I would have failed. The online communities that seem to really stick are the ones built around an existing pool of content and its author. Both [Reddit and Hacker News](https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/18/the-evolution-of-hacker-news/) were seeded by the community of people who read Paul Graham essays. Digg grew (and imploded) around the figure of [Kevin Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rose). We should find this behavior of community building unsurprising, given that [religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible) and [cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneesh) have usually taken the same approach.\n\nWere I to ever try to build an online community again, I wouldn’t launch the community until I already had one. I’d write, and gain followers, and then set up the infrastructure to enable them to communicate with each other. Bringing together people around a shared set of mental models may be the only way to get them to stick around and actually want to talk. In other words, I’d probably try to build something that looked a lot like *Write of Passage*.\n\n**Learning to internet**\n\nThe irony of my love of online communities is that I was mostly a [lurker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurker), which sounds creepy but just means I read content and rarely posted. I feel some regret about this, but the [general rule of thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)) is that 90% of people in online communities lurk, only 10% engage at all, and 1% create almost all of the content. Like most people, I treated online communities like television—I was a consumer, passively scrolling and absorbing. I didn’t share my thoughts. I didn’t feed the trolls.\n\nAs a result, the greatest value I’ve gotten from *Write of Passage* has nothing to do with writing. It has been a full blossoming of realization that the internet should not be a passive medium, it should be approached as an opportunity to actively engage with the world.\n\nIn the past week, I have gotten feedback on my blog posts from half a dozen writers in the class, had a twitter debate about unit economics with a private equity guy, gotten live coding help from a programmer and photographer somewhere in the West Central Africa timezone, discussed trial law with a lawyer in Dallas, submitted bug reports via slack to the team running a piece of open-source software, talked about life with a doctor in Edinburgh, learned about acquiring small SaaS businesses from a guy in Phoenix…and on, and on.\n\nIn these conversations, particularly with my fellow *Write of Passage* course-mates, there is a kind hive mind. I can always find an area of mutual intellectual interest overlap, we can usually recommend a blog post to each other about the topic we’re discussing. It feels like I’m finally living in what Venkatesh Rao refers to as the [Giant Social Computer in the Cloud](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/against-waldenponding).\n\nThe GSCC, or some similar manifestation of it, seems to be the future we are heading into. As [traditional jobs turn into freelance internet gigs](https://meatspacealgorithms.com/2020/07/06/get-ready-for-gig-work/), learning how to plug your brain into this giant cultural cyborg may be as important to workers in the [Information Age](https://meatspacealgorithms.com/2020/06/30/mega-cycles-of-technological-revolutions/) as preparing for a factory setting was to workers of the Industrial Age.\n\nAs we approach school returning in the fall, figuring out how to educate kids is one of the biggest and most important questions society faces. And if actively engaging, creating, debating, networking, and marketing yourself are keys to 21st century success, then schools have an incredible opportunity to change the educational model to fit this mold.", "timestamp": 1633024675, "digest": "f11v21KaAKESdgGEvPjk-LznUHlwhLD5gz_fL7T-Ob0", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}
{"id": "3YIimXRfna24lfRf-xUI_B4LGh_BtUZ6vc3dVRh--3I", "title": "From last-mile to last-minute logistics", "body": "*\\[originally published July 11th, 2020\\]*\n\nThe great challenge of logistics has historically been the *last-mile*: in a fractal expansion of road networks, how do you traverse the last bit of distance to every home? It is an under-rated marvel of modern civilization that this challenge has been largely and quietly accomplished in developed countries like the United States (and is slowly but surely being solved even in [remote corners of the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/technology/delivering-amazon-india.html)).\n\nMy parents live on a ranch in Texas, a two-hour drive from the nearest metropolis and then miles down a winding dirt road covered in cactus and cow poop. After crossing seven [cattle grids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_grid), three creek beds, and a lot of desolate land, you arrive at their front gate to find a large mailbox designed to receive packages. The rest of the family rolled our eyes when my dad installed the mailbox a few years ago, but Amazon recently started delivering right to the front gate (!)\n\nIt takes a literal army of post office workers and Amazon delivery drivers to pull this off, a behemoth of coordination and corporate will. But the savvy American consumer, aided by the unyielding mechanics of modern capitalism, always wants *more* stuff *faster* and *cheaper*. People have increasingly decided they don’t just want things brought right to their house. They want those things *right now*. Last-mile logistics is becoming last-minute logistics, and solving for speed requires a very different approach than solving for geographic coverage.\n\n**Traveling Salesmen and $0.55 stamps**\n\nTo get a mental image of the challenge of the original *last-mile* problem, imagine if Amazon somewhat arbitrarily covered the United States in circles with a 1 mile radius. If every home was covered by one of these circles, and there was a delivery drop-off point at the center of each circle, everyone would be within a mile of a place where they could pick up deliveries. There would be, give-or-take, a million of these circles across the USA (3.8 million mi² / 3.14 mi²).\n\nA million delivery drop-off locations is nothing to sneeze at. But there are 130 million households in the US, so taking this approach instead of delivering to each household individually would make Amazon’s delivery routes about 100x easier (I am oversimplifying a bit here, but the general idea holds). That last mile is a real pain, but for better or worse, people have come to expect things delivered not just to their neighborhood, but to their house.\n\nIf you have enough volume of packages (and people aren’t particularly picky about *exactly* when the stuff arrives), you can load all the stuff in a truck, pretend you are a *[Traveling Salesman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)*, and drive around in a defined route that ends up looking something like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gZiZOw25jHZB2k1b-mp65.png?height=953&width=1024)\n\nThe density of your delivery locations is important, because you can subsidize the fixed costs of driving all over the place across more deliveries. Think of your friendly neighborhood mail-person. Because she delivers to essentially every house, the “cost” of adding your house to her route is small—she already has to drive past your house as she goes from your right-side neighbor to your left-side neighbor.\n\nIn other words, there is a tremendous economy of scale to route-based deliveries. Once you reach critical mass of delivery density, you’ve taken the extremely challenging last-mile problem and turned it into a last-foot problem (the distance from your curb to your mailbox). And there’s probably something else being delivered to your mailbox at the same time, so the incremental cost of dropping in one more letter is negligible. This is why mailing a letter across the country and having it hand-delivered to someone’s house costs the shockingly low price of $0.55 (despite common misconception, the Postal Service receives [no tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations](https://facts.usps.com/top-facts/)).\n\n# How speed beats scale\n\nVery few organizations have reached the kind of density that allows you to solve the last-mile problem with route-based deliveries: The Post Office. UPS. FedEx. Amazon. Even within this sparse list, everyone is ultimately relying on the [Post Office’s last-mile infrastructure](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/USPS-postal-service-deliveries-logistics/531785/) (though Amazon has taken the leap into building out their own end-to-end last-mile systems, at the cost of [billions of dollars ](https://searchaws.techtarget.com/feature/Amazon-bets-big-on-last-mile-delivery-service-improvements)*[per quarter](https://searchaws.techtarget.com/feature/Amazon-bets-big-on-last-mile-delivery-service-improvements)*).\n\nIf you’re an AMZN bull (and I am, for the record) their logistics network is one their greatest moats. But there’s a problem with this moat: on the ever-accelerating hedonic treadmill of consumer preferences, people (ironically aided by Amazon’s [relentless](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2014/06/19/relentlesscom) focus on reducing delivery times and killing delivery fees) have increasingly decided they want their stuff to show up immediately.\n\nThis need for speed has changed the name of the game: last-mile logistics has become last-minute logistics. When people want things in the next hour or two, you don’t have the luxury of giant, highly efficient, pre-planned traditional traveling salesman routes. If people want stuff now, you have to solve a much harder problem and you have to solve it much faster.\n\nThe already [notoriously hard and computationally expensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness) *Traveling Salesman Problem* of last-mile logistics is a walk in the park compared to the mind-boggling *Stochastic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Multiple Trips*. The SCVRPTWMT (if you want an easy-to-remember shorthand) is how we solve last-minute logistics problems [at Instacart](https://tech.instacart.com/space-time-and-groceries-a315925acf3a), and it looks something like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fj5pUf45q5eIKI0-nhIY5.png?height=683&width=1528)\n\nIn plain english, the problem is essentially: how do you get stuff to people by a certain time in the very near future while the rest of the world is constantly changing around you?\n\nSolving this problem is not just computationally harder than solving more traditional last-mile logistics problems, it also requires a fundamentally different approach. Top-down, infrastructure-heavy, meticulously-planned logistics becomes brittle and unadaptable to the needs of last-minute delivery.\n\n# Why Webvan imploded and AmazonFresh withered\n\n[Webvan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webvan) was the epitome of Dot Com mania. It went public in 1999 at a valuation of $4.8 billion on cumulative revenue of $395,000 and cumulative net losses of more than $50 million. In a mere 18 months, the company burned over $800 million in cash before going bankrupt in a spectacular display of excess that looked something like this:\n\n[https://youtu.be/ndVhgq1yHdA](https://youtu.be/ndVhgq1yHdA)\n\nAs has been throughly diagnosed in [business school cases](https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/) ever since, Webvan committed suicide via massively over-expanded logistics infrastructure. They bought parking lots full of refrigerated delivery trucks and filled massive warehouses with a billion dollars worth of top-of-the-line technology:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/keISkRxv_2gZHiDsN4vQy.png?height=354&width=615)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/O_DMgqP2Fj4nrzqxiNp1W.png?height=349&width=460)\n\nJeff Bezos, who presumably had immense piles of cash lying around and not enough ways to light it on fire, [decided to hire the same people who ran Webvan and run the same playbook](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2013/06/17/four-lessons-amazon-learned-from-webvans-flop/#6c4aacf68147)—rebranded as AmazonFresh—[with unsurprisingly similar results](https://www.vox.com/2017/11/3/16601488/amazon-fresh-cancellation-shut-down-grocery-delivery-whole-foods). Why did both of these companies make the same mistakes?\n\nBecause they were attempting to follow the tried-and-true playbook of last-mile logistics:\n\n1. Invest heavily in top-down infrastructure\n2. Forecast, plan, and optimize routes\n3. Gain massive efficiency at massive scale\n4. [???](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/profit)\n5. Profit\n\nWhile this playbook has historically worked well for last-mile logistics (as we saw with the Post Office and Amazon’s traditional delivery business), it fails when you need to get people things quickly, either due to consumer preferences or the need to keep items temperature-stable (as with grocery and restaurant delivery). Your impressive infrastructure and meticulous plans go from being an asset to a liability.\n\n# Limiting liabilities with last-minute logistics\n\nIf you want to solve problems like the *Stochastic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Multiple Trips*, you need to make some adjustments to the logistics playbook by optimizing for real-time flexibility and adaptability over maximum theoretical efficiency. The [first rule](https://cerasis.com/effective-last-mile-logistics/) of *last-mile* logistics is that meticulous planning is essential. The first rule of *last-minute* logistics is that meticulous planning is impossible.\n\nThe first problem with planning is that the world is constantly changing. The USPS has built complex planning algorithms that run on very large and fast computers, and it still takes them most of a day to create their route plans. The problem is that by the time they calculate the routes, more packages have come into their system, and the whole thing is woefully outdated. A delayed map is increasingly [divorced from the territory](https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/).\n\nThe second problem is that forecasting is hard, and the further out into the future you go, the harder it gets. Knowing what will happen two weeks from now is much harder than knowing what will happen two days from now, which is much harder than knowing what will happen two hours from now. The magic of last-minute logistics is using real-time signals to focus on accurate predictions of the near-term over precise predictions of the longer-term.\n\n> The magic of last-minute logistics is using real-time signals to focus on accurate predictions of the near-term over precise predictions of the longer-term.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t predict demand patterns for two weeks from now. It just means you shouldn’t trust or rely on those predictions too much, and you should be able to quickly adapt in real-time to meet the needs that actually arise. Don’t pre-design complicated optimal routes, just try to do the best you can with the options available in the moment.\n\nRelying on real-time signals allows you to have a more accurate picture of the evolving stochastic state of the world, but it also requires you to be able to use those signals effectively. You need to have adaptive operational structures and flexible infrastructure. Instacart has succeeded where Webvan and AmazonFresh failed by building a [low-friction bottom-up marketplace](https://meatspacealgorithms.com/2020/07/06/get-ready-for-gig-work/) instead of a top-down centrally-planned economy. Instacart’s constantly evolving delivery routes, on-demand shoppers, and real-time incentives give it the flexibility to meet customer demand precisely when it occurs.\n\nThis ephemeral infrastructure is not only better suited to last-minute logistics, it also is much easier to bootstrap. Instead of needing to amortize billions of dollars worth of infrastructure across extremely high density deliveries, you can start small and local. And if you do this well, you can use your lightweight infrastructure to outmaneuver the trillion-dollar behemoth of Amazon’s logistics powerhouse, like guerilla warriors outflanking traditional armies.", "timestamp": 1633025044, "digest": "6lFakW53HevnBMp7LhLQ84v_LUFXh4MzXVHvM3OpByo", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

In short, I was looking for a traditional school experience. So far, that’s been about 10% of the value of the course.\n\nI was surprised to find that the other 90% hasn’t come directly from David—it has come from other members of the class. As we’ve engaged in small group video chats and commented on each other’s drafts and started interest groups on [Circle](https://circle.so/), a Facebook-like tool designed for this very purpose, it’s become increasingly clear that the value of this course has more to do with the community than the classes. And that’s not because David is a bad teacher, it’s because he’s a great community builder.\n\nThis idea is in the same ballpark as one popularized by Chris Dixon about building social networks: [come for the tool, stay for the network](https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network). Instagram started as a way to get cool filters for your photos and only later became the dominant network for people to share photos with each other. [Cold-starting social networks](https://andrewchen.co/how-to-solve-the-cold-start-problem-for-social-products/) is notoriously hard, so you often need to figure out how to provide single-player utility before you can turn it into a [multi-player game](https://cdixon.org/2010/06/12/designing-products-for-single-and-multiplayer-modes).\n\nOnline courses and communities follow the same property. There seem to be two main lessons to learn here: if you want to build educational content, turn it into a community; if you want to build an online community, start with educational content.\n\n# Multi-player education\n\nAs schools of all shapes and sizes across the U.S. consider what Fall 2020 will look like in light of our inability to effectively control COVID-19, we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try new models of education. I am not an educator by trade, and I’ve seen my friends who are give eye-rolls every time someone says they have a shiny new educational model to save the day. I’m not here to promise a panacea or silver bullet, and I understand that what works for a highly motivated set of adults that paid thousands of dollars to proactively join an online course likely doesn’t apply to middle school kids living in poverty with disengaged parents. But, I also think professional educators should pause for a second and ask if they can learn anything from courses that people happily pay thousands of dollars for.\n\nUnfortunately, we seem to have taken the [worst aspects of in-person education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_model_school) and designed online education in the same image. Rows of desks facing a chalkboard have become isolated computer screens streaming pre-packaged videos. Online education is too often a lonely, uninspiring single-player utility that ends up feeling something like this:\n\n[https://youtu.be/dxPVyieptwA](https://youtu.be/dxPVyieptwA)\n\nIt’s the default and it’s easy—everyone puts themselves on mute on a Zoom call and someone lectures. They might feign attempts at engagement (“…Anyone? Anyone? The…Hawley Smoot Tariff Act…”), but it’s no match for dozens of students sitting at their computers with their video turned off, one click away from dank memes and TikTok dances.\n\nThe irony of this is that the internet offers the tools for even better collaborative opportunities than in-person education. We think of education as a knowledge transfer product, but it’s actually a social product—and we’ve spent the last twenty years as a society mastering the art of online social communication.

People will find their own way to get out of the experience what they put into it. Let them do this and then evaluate based on the product they create, not the process they used to get there.\n\n# Building an online community\n\nIn short, what I’m suggesting is that online learning works best when you build an online community. Beware that this isn’t easy—online communities are rare and wondrous specimens of the internet. I don’t mean social networks like Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn. I’m talking about communities with deep and distinct cultures: places like Hacker News, MetaFilter, and 4chan. Some sub-reddits would qualify. Loosely bounded entities like (sports, tech, black, finance, science)-twitter sit in an amorphous grey-area.\n\nI know about these ecological niches of cyberspace because I spent most of middle and high school lurking on early iterations of global web-based communities (Digg, Hacker News, MetaFilter, Reddit). I’ve even tried to start my own online community. I was fresh out of college and idealistically confident about the future of online discourse. I envisioned a beautiful sci-fi fantasy that heavily borrowed from the Net of *Ender’s Game*: great writers and deep online debate driving socio-political decision-making. I was young, naive, and I certainly [wasn’t expecting this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/08/this-is-trumps-most-spectacularly-wonderfully-terrible-tweet-ever/).\n\nBut even if I’d tried to start an online community with slightly more modest ambitions and a more realistic understanding of people’s desires for online engagement, I would have failed. The online communities that seem to really stick are the ones built around an existing pool of content and its author. Both [Reddit and Hacker News](https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/18/the-evolution-of-hacker-news/) were seeded by the community of people who read Paul Graham essays. Digg grew (and imploded) around the figure of [Kevin Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rose). We should find this behavior of community building unsurprising, given that [religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible) and [cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneesh) have usually taken the same approach.\n\nWere I to ever try to build an online community again, I wouldn’t launch the community until I already had one. I’d write, and gain followers, and then set up the infrastructure to enable them to communicate with each other. Bringing together people around a shared set of mental models may be the only way to get them to stick around and actually want to talk. In other words, I’d probably try to build something that looked a lot like *Write of Passage*.\n\n# Learning to internet\n\nThe irony of my love of online communities is that I was mostly a [lurker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurker), which sounds creepy but just means I read content and rarely posted. I feel some regret about this, but the [general rule of thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)) is that 90% of people in online communities lurk, only 10% engage at all, and 1% create almost all of the content. Like most people, I treated online communities like television—I was a consumer, passively scrolling and absorbing. I didn’t share my thoughts. I didn’t feed the trolls.\n\nAs a result, the greatest value I’ve gotten from *Write of Passage* has nothing to do with writing. It has been a full blossoming of realization that the internet should not be a passive medium, it should be approached as an opportunity to actively engage with the world.\n\nIn the past week, I have gotten feedback on my blog posts from half a dozen writers in the class, had a twitter debate about unit economics with a private equity guy, gotten live coding help from a programmer and photographer somewhere in the West Central Africa timezone, discussed trial law with a lawyer in Dallas, submitted bug reports via slack to the team running a piece of open-source software, talked about life with a doctor in Edinburgh, learned about acquiring small SaaS businesses from a guy in Phoenix…and on, and on.\n\nIn these conversations, particularly with my fellow *Write of Passage* course-mates, there is a kind hive mind. I can always find an area of mutual intellectual interest overlap, we can usually recommend a blog post to each other about the topic we’re discussing. It feels like I’m finally living in what Venkatesh Rao refers to as the [Giant Social Computer in the Cloud](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/against-waldenponding).\n\nThe GSCC, or some similar manifestation of it, seems to be the future we are heading into. As [traditional jobs turn into freelance internet gigs](https://meatspacealgorithms.com/2020/07/06/get-ready-for-gig-work/), learning how to plug your brain into this giant cultural cyborg may be as important to workers in the [Information Age](https://meatspacealgorithms.com/2020/06/30/mega-cycles-of-technological-revolutions/) as preparing for a factory setting was to workers of the Industrial Age.\n\nAs we approach school returning in the fall, figuring out how to educate kids is one of the biggest and most important questions society faces. And if actively engaging, creating, debating, networking, and marketing yourself are keys to 21st century success, then schools have an incredible opportunity to change the educational model to fit this mold.", "timestamp": 1633025014, "digest": "f11v21KaAKESdgGEvPjk-LznUHlwhLD5gz_fL7T-Ob0", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}
{"id": "Yje_mZNYfGrdJhQzq7W5hW3kdg6SHQSAZPGfymI9TuY", "title": "Six economies of online creators", "body": "*\\[originally published August 21st, 2020\\]*\n\nKevin Kelly described one of the first paths to becoming an independent creator employed by the internet in his classic essay 1,000 True Fans:\n\n> To be a successful creator you don’t need millions. You don’t need millions of dollars or millions of customers, millions of clients or millions of fans. To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true fans. \n\nI believe Kelly's prediction of an internet of indie creators, now 12 years old, is just hitting its stride. It's one of those cases where enough positive forces combine simultaneously to create something extraordinary:\n\nWidely available open-source software, scalable infrastructure, app and web frameworks, and full stack micro-SaaS for operating a business — what Tyler Tringas calls \"the Peace Dividend of the SaaS Wars\":\n\n• An unbundling of online social spaces and a retreat to the cozy web, which has resulted in a blossoming of niche creative communities \n\n• Acceleration of stronger cultural norms of online interaction developed during the pandemic (if you'll attend a Zoom wedding, why not a Zoom class?) \n\n• Declining transaction costs driving a macro-economic trend towards remote and gig work \n\n• Tech giants getting too big and too focused on regulation to focus on solving niche problems \n\nSo what happens when you smash all of these trends into each other? You end up with a lot of different ways to make a little money. If your independent financial goal is to make $100k per year, finding 1,000 True Fans is one path. But as Li Jin has been pointing out this year, 100 True Fans might be a better fit for many creators in the passion economy.\n\nBoth of these paths are on a wide spectrum of such economies. Before you decide how many fans you need or what to produce for them, it's worth taking a step back and looking at the full range of ways to make $100k in annual revenue. It spans six orders of magnitude, each of which represents a distinct economy of creators:\n\n**100k @ $1 / yr** — Influencer economy: ads, micropayments, affiliates\n**10k @ $10 / yr** — Gig economy: e-books, drop shipping, transactional gigs\n**1k @ $100 / yr** — Fan economy: patrons, subscription newsletters/content\n**100 @ $1k / yr** — Passion economy: Online courses, coaching/tutoring\n**10 @ $10k / yr** — Indie economy: Indie consulting, niche SaaS\n**1 @ $100k /yr** — Professional economy: aka jobs, what the rest of us are avoiding 😁\n\n\nUnderstanding these economies can be useful for thinking about the right business model for your work. You can start with the size of customer base you want to work for and then back into the type of product those customers would buy from you. Or, you can start with the product you make or want to make and figure out how many customers you would need to make it work.\n\nOn one end of the spectrum, you have influencers. Influencers are people who build very large audiences and offer them free content. They usually monetize indirectly by selling their audience (ads, affiliates, etc). Over the past decade, micropayments have also finally started realizing their long-heralded potential via platforms like Twitch. I'm still hopeful for future forms of micro-payments designed more broadly around decentralized online communities.\n\nOne order of magnitude away is the gig economy. Gigs are the hustle and grind of the independent world. This economy is best known for its highly structured vertical marketplaces like Uber, Instacart, and Thumbtack, as well as its broad open-ended freelance platforms like Fiverr and Upwork. But the gig economy also includes a wider range of less well known independent workers churning out tasks for around $10 in revenue. An example is the drop-shipping community, one of those fascinating little corners of the internet to poke around in.\n\nThe one-thousand true fan economy is having a renaissance. In the wake of massive layoffs and downsizing at newspaper and magazine companies trying to compete on the internet, independent writers and journalists are trying to find new business models. Many have built a decently portable fan base over the years, and the best are monetizing subscription newsletters and other content. Suddenly everyone has a newsletter, because newsletter subscribers are fans. Fan-based crowdfunding platforms like Patreon and Indiegogo have also established themselves as mainstream and companies like GitHub are trying this model out in new verticals. And, of course, there's OnlyFans.\n\nWe are just starting to see the early signs of successful passion economy companies and communities. The best examples are online classes—spanning from live, remote yoga and weight training sessions to full blown courses like Write of Passage and Building a Second Brain. Passion tends to lead to education and social connection, so it's unsurprising that organizations operating in this zone usually become both classes and communities. Interestingly, 100 true fans is about where Dunbar's number pegs the best size for a tribe.\n\nDiscovering the indie economy feels kind of like the first time you travel to a popular international backpacker destination and find your way to a hostel. There's a whole world of recovering former professionals company-hopping through consulting gigs the way travelers country-hop through bars, beaches, and remote mountain retreats (the only two times I've met yak herders are at an alpine lake in Nepal and in the thriving indie consulting community). Beyond consulting, the indie economy thrives on micro-SaaS products. It turns out you can make good money selling appointment reminder software to SMBs for $100/month.\n\nFinally, we have Professionals. People with jobs. Instead of selling a product, they sell themselves to work on someone else's product. Interestingly, the spectrum sort of wraps back around to the other end—Influencers and Professionals are the two groups who don't directly build and sell products to users. It turns out the classic meme that \"if you're not paying, you're the product\" works as well for producers as consumers—if you're not selling a product, you're it!\n\nI don't mean to demean professional work. I did it for awhile and often found it to be incredibly fulfilling. The point is just that everyone should find their own spot on the map. Jobs are and will continue to be the right path for many people. Gigs will become a dominant form of work in a world of low transaction costs. The fan, passion, and indie economies are having a virtual love fest right now. And micro-celebrity influencers don't appear to going anywhere.\n\nI believe all of these economies are still in their infancy, and will become increasingly dominant ways to earn a living over time. If you're interested in leaving the professional class and diving into one of these other economies, I started a Creator Fellowship to help support you. My business model is essentially an iterator for the indie economy. If I can invest in 10 people a year and help them make their $100k online, I can recoup my initial investment plus earn around $10k per person.\n\nAnd if you're interested in joining a community of people who quit their full-time jobs to build things online, reach out. The Creator Coop is a free, decentralized organization for maintaining mutual accountability to our goals and helping each other succeed. We have a community forum, regular virtual meetings, and anything else the community decides to make.", "timestamp": 1633025440, "digest": "FZrmtKcIlctHKp-2hH8e1gkj6vOtqHAU8B5ARuHMnlA", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

I'm learning a lot about the invisible physical infrastructure that surrounds us: electric lines, plumbing, septic systems. I'm also learning about the construction industry, which I think is a compelling operating model for the future of work. That's because[ the future of work is the gig](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/2020-07-06-get-ready-for-gig-work/), and construction is the original gig economy.\n\nI want to build a house, so I hired a contractor to build a foundation for it to sit on. He then turned around and hired subcontractors: one to bring trucks of concrete to the site, another to pump the concrete into the forms, a third to build the forms and shape the concrete into a foundation. There may have been more companies involved, I don't even know. All I know is that I hired a guy to deliver a completed foundation and he handled it from there.\n\nAnd that’s just the actual foundation contractor. Before we poured the foundation, the electrician had to put a grounding wire in the form, the house builder had to coordinate extensively on the foundation design, the septic guy had to get his pipes in place. It required massive coordination between people that may never meet, rely heavily on each other’s work, and are financially incentivized to make edge cases someone else’s problem. A modern multiplayer market miracle.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TQetLht4pVC5ZVap2uY_n.png?height=1500&width=2000)\n\n## Market coordination\n\nMarkets are systems for coordinating humans to produce things. What makes them different from other coordination systems, like companies or tribes or countries, is that markets can do it without anyone in charge. They produce novel and unpredictable outcomes precisely because no one planned them.\n\nA market is able to pull off this magic trick by creating the conditions for coordination among independent self-interested actors. The platonic ideal of this relies on \"[perfect information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information)\": all consumers and producers having perfect and instantaneous knowledge of all market prices, their own utility, and own cost functions. Economics relies on this sort of absurd, impractical assumption as a given in order to make any useful calculations. That's why[ economists don't have a good track record at predicting things in the real world](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/economists-are-bad-at-predicting-recessions/).\n\nBut there's a curious thing happening right now: just as we are waking up to the fact that[ economist's physics envy hasn't made for good science](https://aeon.co/ideas/few-things-are-as-dangerous-as-economists-with-physics-envy), computers and the internet have created something that much more closely resembles the platonic ideal of markets that economists live within. Markets function well when there is lots of available information and low transaction costs—when everyone knows everything and can interact with anyone.\n\nIn other words, the internet is made for markets.\n\n# Markets rule everything around me\n\nIt’s no surprise that in this [low transaction cost environment](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/2020-07-06-get-ready-for-gig-work/), many of the fastest growing, biggest emerging companies are marketplaces: Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Instacart, Doordash. They build software to reduce transaction costs and leave the physical infrastructure up to the supply side. *Stratechery* popularized the term [Aggregation Theory](https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/) to describe this dynamic:\n\n> The value chain for any given consumer market is divided into three parts: suppliers, distributors, and consumers/users. The best way to make outsize profits in any of these markets is to either gain a horizontal monopoly in one of the three parts or to integrate two of the parts such that you have a competitive advantage in delivering a vertical solution. In the pre-Internet era the latter depended on controlling distribution.\n\n> The fundamental disruption of the Internet has been to turn this dynamic on its head. First, the Internet has made distribution (of digital goods) free, neutralizing the advantage that pre-Internet distributors leveraged to integrate with suppliers. Secondly, the Internet has made transaction costs zero, making it viable for a distributor to integrate forward with end users/consumers at scale.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eDAc7bqp2CbXTjiBQCfyn.png?height=720&width=1600)\n\n \\n When I first read about Aggregation Theory, I didn’t grok the importance of what Ben Thompson was saying. The takeaway here is not just that the points of integration and modularization have changed, it’s that the integrated value capture sits right in the middle, between supply and demand—it’s a marketplace!\n\nWhat a business model: building software to do what the internet does best—reducing transaction costs—is so valuable that you can attract independent supply and demand without the challenges of vertically integrating supply. This marketplace mentality has so thoroughly encapsulated the Silicon Valley ethos over the past decade that people forget businesses can be built any other way. When I was running product interviews at Instacart, my favorite questions were always something along the lines of:\n\n*“Imagine you want to start a business in X industry. How would you do it?”*\n\nWithout skipping a beat or even considering the possibility of alternative approaches, I watched hundreds of product managers dive into designing a marketplace. These PMs were taking their cues from the startup landscape, where there was now a marketplace for everything from [dog walking to sneakers](https://a16z.com/2020/02/18/marketplace-100/):\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m1bvxfg91GPzV2nmpAZfm.png?height=1600&width=1238)\n\n# In brands we trust\n\nYou hear marketplaces like Uber and Airbnb talking a lot about trust. Airbnb claims they are a “[business fueled by trust](https://news.airbnb.com/in-the-business-of-trust/)”. Uber faced an [existential crisis of trust](https://on-the-mark.com/ubers-problem-with-trust/) that resulted in booting the founding CEO and spending ungodly amounts of money on a [PR campaign and ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMZyw5lPKgE) assuring us that we could trust them.\n\nMarketplaces sell trust because they don’t control a vertically integrated supply side, but consumers still expect brands to deliver on their promises. When you stay at a Marriott, you expect a certain level of quality and customer service because that's what you always get when you stay at a Marriott. Most hotel chains are actually franchises, owned and operated independently. Even though they don’t own most of their hotel properties, Marriott is worth $48B because they have earned a brand consumers trust by enforcing detailed control over how customers experience their brand standards at franchisee’s hotels.\n\nBut marketplace platforms like Airbnb not only don't own the inventory, they don't have the ability to enforce detailed brand standards. The marketplace platforms have outsourced their brand enforcement back to customers and the market. This is why the Airbnb review process is so cumbersome—you are the enforcement mechanism for the brand:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/biqa7D02rhFQoNKUAuqLd.png?height=433&width=999)\n\n \\n Trust is the bottleneck of marketplaces. The ability to define and enforce brand standards in a world of modularized, independent supply has kept marketplaces fragmented and specialized. It has also led to [increasingly managed marketplaces](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/25/anatomy-of-a-managed-marketplace/), where the ideal of frictionless transactions is replaced with a centralized authority that starts to look like a traditional supply-side integrated company:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YoKPXOLfBL3GSkoz8JENz.png?height=1011&width=1420)\n\n# From managed to multiplayer marketplaces\n\nAs Netscape cofounder Jim Barksdale said, [there are only two ways to make money: bundling and unbundling.](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling) Marketplaces of the past decade have unbundled atomic units of fungible goods and labor. They have massively reduced transaction costs for single transactions within a specific vertical. One ride. One delivery. One vacation rental.\n\nAs marketplaces chase trust by specializing into more centrally managed experiences, I wonder what the next wave of decentralized markets looks like. For the past decade, companies have been building marketplaces. Now, how can we use labor marketplaces to assemble just-in-time companies? How do we bring together these building blocks into larger-scale human coordination?\n\nConstruction, with its loose network of subcontractors, points the way. If dozens of people using phone calls and informal relationships of trust can come together to build physical infrastructure, surely we can do better with software and the internet.\n\nNadia Eghbal’s *[Working in Public](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software/dp/0578675862)* shows how open source software has discovered some mechanisms for managing open-contribution networks. Cooperatives like [Ampled](https://www.ampled.com/), built by a loosely coordinated army of independent engineers, designers, product people, and marketers provide another interesting example of where we may be headed.\n\nWe will also need new ways of managing decentralized trust and incentives to achieve multiplayer marketplace coordination. [Decentralized autonomous organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) built using smart contracts on blockchains are a tantalizing vision of the future.\n\nAs the [nature of the firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm) changes to reflect the reality of decreasing transaction costs, I believe we are just beginning to see the implications of small groups of independent actors self-organizing to solve problems. As we learn how to navigate trust and coordination problems in these multiplayer marketplaces, we will unlock more human potential for creation in the 21st century than corporations did in the 20th century. \\n  \\n \n\n \\n ", "timestamp": 1633025959, "digest": "TJPswiNyFEOia1FHe6D3B3-wtBCeFnQbStVouQkWW_c", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

When I was running product interviews at Instacart, my favorite questions were always something along the lines of:\n\n*“Imagine you want to start a business in X industry. How would you do it?”*\n\nWithout skipping a beat or even considering the possibility of alternative approaches, I watched hundreds of product managers dive into designing a marketplace. These PMs were taking their cues from the startup landscape, where there was now a marketplace for everything from [dog walking to sneakers](https://a16z.com/2020/02/18/marketplace-100/):\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m1bvxfg91GPzV2nmpAZfm.png?height=1600&width=1238)\n\n# In brands we trust\n\nYou hear marketplaces like Uber and Airbnb talking a lot about trust. Airbnb claims they are a “[business fueled by trust](https://news.airbnb.com/in-the-business-of-trust/)”. Uber faced an [existential crisis of trust](https://on-the-mark.com/ubers-problem-with-trust/) that resulted in booting the founding CEO and spending ungodly amounts of money on a [PR campaign and ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMZyw5lPKgE) assuring us that we could trust them.\n\nMarketplaces sell trust because they don’t control a vertically integrated supply side, but consumers still expect brands to deliver on their promises. When you stay at a Marriott, you expect a certain level of quality and customer service because that's what you always get when you stay at a Marriott. Most hotel chains are actually franchises, owned and operated independently. Even though they don’t own most of their hotel properties, Marriott is worth $48B because they have earned a brand consumers trust by enforcing detailed control over how customers experience their brand standards at franchisee’s hotels.\n\nBut marketplace platforms like Airbnb not only don't own the inventory, they don't have the ability to enforce detailed brand standards. The marketplace platforms have outsourced their brand enforcement back to customers and the market. This is why the Airbnb review process is so cumbersome—you are the enforcement mechanism for the brand:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/biqa7D02rhFQoNKUAuqLd.png?height=433&width=999)\n\n\\\\n Trust is the bottleneck of marketplaces. The ability to define and enforce brand standards in a world of modularized, independent supply has kept marketplaces fragmented and specialized. It has also led to [increasingly managed marketplaces](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/25/anatomy-of-a-managed-marketplace/), where the ideal of frictionless transactions is replaced with a centralized authority that starts to look like a traditional supply-side integrated company:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YoKPXOLfBL3GSkoz8JENz.png?height=1011&width=1420)\n\n# From managed to multiplayer marketplaces\n\nAs Netscape cofounder Jim Barksdale said, [there are only two ways to make money: bundling and unbundling.](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling) Marketplaces of the past decade have unbundled atomic units of fungible goods and labor. They have massively reduced transaction costs for single transactions within a specific vertical. One ride. One delivery. One vacation rental.\n\nAs marketplaces chase trust by specializing into more centrally managed experiences, I wonder what the next wave of decentralized markets looks like. For the past decade, companies have been building marketplaces. Now, how can we use labor marketplaces to assemble just-in-time companies? How do we bring together these building blocks into larger-scale human coordination?\n\nConstruction, with its loose network of subcontractors, points the way. If dozens of people using phone calls and informal relationships of trust can come together to build physical infrastructure, surely we can do better with software and the internet.\n\nNadia Eghbal’s *[Working in Public](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software/dp/0578675862)* shows how open source software has discovered some mechanisms for managing open-contribution networks. Cooperatives like [Ampled](https://www.ampled.com/), built by a loosely coordinated army of independent engineers, designers, product people, and marketers provide another interesting example of where we may be headed.\n\nWe will also need new ways of managing decentralized trust and incentives to achieve multiplayer marketplace coordination. [Decentralized autonomous organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) built using smart contracts on blockchains are a tantalizing vision of the future.\n\nAs the [nature of the firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm) changes to reflect the reality of decreasing transaction costs, I believe we are just beginning to see the implications of small groups of independent actors self-organizing to solve problems. As we learn how to navigate trust and coordination problems in these multiplayer marketplaces, we will unlock more human potential for creation in the 21st century than corporations did in the 20th century.", "timestamp": 1633026002, "digest": "TJPswiNyFEOia1FHe6D3B3-wtBCeFnQbStVouQkWW_c", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}
{"id": "blTD3ioYeToJpc-DGuVlvMWRpAGpTTULIZikgps4zss", "title": "Decentralized cities", "body": "*\\[originally published March 7th, 2021\\]*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Apz_13u5briqFJI7Xzq-F.png?height=720&width=2000)\n\nOne of the favorite past times of tech twitter during the pandemic has been predicting the next Silicon Valley.\n\n**Austin**, with its natural beauty, weird-chill vibe, flagship university, killer BBQ, and long history of technology companies is an obvious choice. Francis Suarez, with the hustle of a direct-to-consumer CBD salesman and the political savvy of a future president, has been miraculously tweeting **Miami** into existence as a tech hub. And, of course, you can never count out **San Francisco** to be the next San Francisco.\n\nWe know the players and we know the game. It's comforting. And the best part is, there are no wrong answers! Just wrong questions.\n\n# Wrong questions\n\nPeople still refer to the \"tech industry\" as if every industry wasn't getting eaten by software. I advise and invest in companies tackling problems in education, real estate, banking, media, fitness, construction, and healthcare. The only reason I can help this range of companies is because they are all using the same principles of software development to accomplish their goals.\n\nInternet-enabled software is in [the deployment phase](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/2020-06-30-mega-cycles-of-technological-revolutions/), where it becomes so ubiquitous as to be second nature. **Asking which city will be the next tech hub is like asking which industry will use software.**\n\nOf course, all industries use software. And any city that wants to stay economically relevant will need to figure out how to attract people that build it. San Francisco and Austin and Miami are some of the best positioned places to do this. But the \"tech industry\" is too big for one city.\n\nWhat's a better question?\n\nThe most interesting industries are not the ones software is eating, but the new ones it's creating. Things that weren't possible or economically feasible before. Autonomous cars. Virtual reality. Social networks.\n\nSo, what new types of cities might the internet create?\n\n# Cities and ambitions\n\nTo answer that question, we need to understand what makes cities great. Paul Graham wrote [an essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html) about this that starts:\n\n> Great cities attract ambitious people. You can sense it when you walk around one. In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a message: you could do more; you should try harder.\n\nHumans are [mimetic creatures](https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel/)—always looking at what others are doing, comparing ourselves to it, and copying their behaviors. Bigger cities, by nature of their size, will have more ambitious people. But it's once ambitious people are surrounded by other ambitious people that something interesting happens. They start feeding off of each other.\n\nGeoffrey West, an academic who left the field of physics to explore new pastures,[ has quantified this effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyCY6mjWOPc) by showing a strong relationship between the population of cities, higher wages, and more creative people:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jxBJ797_XoLje9PXhgwzv.png?height=1174&width=1600)\n\nBut this chart is on a log scale, which is just a fancy way of saying it’s an exponential relationship: **interesting people attract more interesting people.** Once there's a critical mass of them, other people start noticing and emulating them. This creates even more novel ways of doing things, and more people get in on the fun. Pretty soon you have a culture.\n\n# People vs. places\n\n[West goes on to explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxgHyPCCqaw&t=1254) that when you think of cities, you think of the boulevards of Paris and the Eiffel Tower, you think of the skyscrapers of New York. But that's just the stage. It's the platform on which the social networks and information and creativity is taking place. It facilitates the daily social interaction that creates ideas, wealth, and stimulates innovation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lkOLj6Aj-Bpm2kTGwl6sw.png?height=881&width=1600)\n\nIt's not the place that matters, it's **the density of creative ideas and interesting people.** When I think about where I meet interesting people, it’s increasingly not in a physical place at all. It’s on Twitter threads and Discord channels and WhatsApp groups.\n\nIn the Facebook era, people met in person and then became “friends” online. But it makes more sense to do the opposite: **find your friends online and then meet up in person.** There are at least 1000x more people to choose from online, and they conveniently [gather into easily identifiable tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_(internet)). People in the dating pool are the most highly motivated searchers for strong new connections, and [they have figured this out in droves](https://web.stanford.edu/\\~mrosenfe/Rosenfeld_et_al_Disintermediating_Friends.pdf):\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_O5cZYc_X-g6n4VTXYmt3.png?height=523&width=629)\n\nBut the physical world still matters. Once people connect, they need meatspace to come together, break bread, be present, and immerse themselves in the environment. Maybe someday there will be virtual realities with the same bandwidth as the real world, but for now, you can’t beat good old fashioned reality.\n\nSo how do we get the best of cities and the best of the internet? **What if creative, ambitious people found each other online and then decided to get together in the same place?**\n\n# Let's build\n\nThis is the premise of [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/), the community of remote cabins for remote workers and independent online creators that we're building in the Texas Hill Country, about 45 minutes outside of Austin. Here’s a view from the deck of our first cabin:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g7wbik7QxZbssZIDJxQuh.png?height=576&width=1600)\n\nLike any good startup, it's a simple premise with an ambitious goal. For now, it's a place to get together IRL with your internet friends. In the future, I hope it becomes one node in a network of decentralized properties, owned and operated by small groups of independent online creators and entrepreneurs. The density of creative energy of San Francisco or New York, but wherever and whenever you want it to be. If you were designing a 21st century city from scratch, why would you put it all in one place?\n\nFollow this idea to its logical conclusion and you can end up in some wild territory. Neal Stephenson wrote about independent distributed city-state Burbclaves in his mind-bending 1992 science fiction classic *[Snow Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash)*. James Dale Davidson envisioned not just sovereign suburbs, but [sovereign individuals](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AK9IXXM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) around the same time. Davidson's buddy Peter Thiel helped popularize the idea of [Seasteading](https://www.seasteading.org/) more recently. And now, Balaji Srinivasan is talking about exiting to cloud-first [Network States](https://1729.com/introduction/).\n\nMany of these visions make my network of cabins look woefully unambitious by comparison. But my goal isn't some grand libertarian exit from society. **I just want to take more of the magical serendipity of the internet and bring it into high-bandwidth reality.** First, we'll have [cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/cabins). Then there will be [towns](https://www.creatortowns.com/). Eventually, I think we'll have a network that really does resemble a city.\n\nI won't pretend to know exactly where this is headed. The best cities aren't planned, they evolve. But if Creator Cabins has an ambition, a central cultural tenet, I hope it is one of people gaining greater independence over their work and lives by earning a living online. I am inspired by independent online creators, writers, artists, and entrepreneurs—so I'm making a place for us to gather and meet each other and create even better things.\n\n*If you’d like to be a part of it, [come visit](https://www.creatorcabins.com/book)!

{"id": "M5dgiojWBvJFkYgGHwgqWJ_3JHh2mPy4ssTYAYHd8lQ", "title": "Token-Gated Access", "body": "![see NFT auction below](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3195373-f5f3-4e66-b228-c435702c8a63.jpeg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nThe focus of this piece is to highlight the important business opportunities that social tokens and NFTs enable for services, software, and creators without 3rd party investment. We cover what tokenized access and subscriptions look like, ongoing experiments with the tech, as well as the numerous advantages over traditional SaaS. We purposefully don’t dive specifically into other important benefits that token economies can provide services willing to decentralize, such as governance, DAOs, etc. We mainly focus on the argument that all or most SaaS and creator businesses can and should tokenize subscriptions to their services.\n\nTokenized services are especially powerful for creators, allowing them to focus on providing a good service, finding customers who want the service (a market fit), and focusing on bringing that customer value. This is good for customers since they can pay less and have a better experience. It’s good for creators since they can sustain their businesses.\n\n### TradSaaS\n\nIf you watch movies, listen to music, or own a phone, you’re probably familiar with subscriptions. At least, your wallet is. Instead of selling you today, tomorrow, and next week, they only need to convince you once and the money keeps coming. It’s a steady and predictable stream of revenue. Because each customer is so valuable, they can focus more on keeping them than doing anything and everything to get more.\n\nThe current standard Software as a service subscription model consists of monthly/yearly recurring payments. It started in publishing, and now it is used in almost all industries, from businesses like New York Times, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Seamless, and Peloton.\n\nWhere does it end? Let’s divide subscriptions into two categories. The first one is services, like Netflix, Prime, Lootcrate, and Spotify, which kinda have to be subscriptions. Sure, you can buy music and movies individually but here, you get everything. Subscription boxes, which send you new things in the mail every month, are services because they’re more about fun and surprise than the stuff itself. And then there are products - things that could be sold, but here are rented.\n\n> *Access trumps ownership. That’s the mantra behind the “subscription economy”.* - [The Economist](https://applied.economist.com/articles/a-notion-worth-subscribing-to)\n\nWhat the Economist is referring to as ownership is the mere ownership of one copy of a product or service, as was common in Web1 SaaS (*Buy Microsoft Office '09 for a one-time payment of $100)*. Your business needs either capital or recurring revenue to exist. Subscriptions are the best recurring revenue model. Current SaaS subscriptions are broken. Tokens make subscriptions better for creators and customers\n\n### Enter Community Tokens and DAOs\n\nBy using tokens as a means of purchasing access to a service, consumers can participate in the potential upside of the demand of that service. They will hold a premium on what they're receiving because they get to earn from the other side of the success. If users have any inclination or any belief that other users will want to use this product, there will be an increase in demand for this product and therefore increasing demand for the token. They will put a premium on it.\n\nTakeaway: Use tokens to create a better subscription model for your business.\n\n### Tokenized Access\n\nTokenized access is the system of gating/limiting content, features, or whole platforms with tokens, requiring users to own/hold specific tokens or NFTs. Teams/creators then monetize by releasing/minting new tokens (inflation) to sell to new customers/speculators. In its full form, it’ll feel like subscribing or going through a paywall. This can be used to gate anything and can be coupled with free and traditional subscription options.\n\n**If you held $10,000 in bitcoin for the last month, you paid $15/m to secure it.**\n\nYou didn't pay in subscription fees but rather in agreed-upon inflation. The circulating supply of BTC grew by 0.15% and your holdings' purchasing power was diluted as a result. This newly minted bitcoin was given to miners as block rewards and helped secure their holdings. Block rewards are a form of revenue for miners, and they’re critical to maintaining bitcoin.\n\nInflation-Based Revenue is not new but has been used by governments for generations now. For example, to increase revenue, the US government can, among other things, increase taxes (yearly 'subscription') or print money (inflation).\n\nWhat if we applied that same line of thinking to SaaS products: B2B, tools, newsletters, passion economy, etc.? Could token subscriptions be valuable to work on in their world?\n\nIn line with the transition from passion economy to ownership economy, [as beautifully broken down by Jesse Walden](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/), crypto emissions can be thought of as a consistent and stable revenue model for businesses and teams. Token minting is SaaS backward and powerful for users if structured correctly. This could be thought of as the natural next step for consumer software monetization. For example, Microsoft could hypothetically utilize it as their next business model for Microsoft Office:\n\n*(1995-2010) Buy Microsoft Office '09 for $100*\n\n*(2010-2020) Rent Microsoft Office Suite for $9.99 / month*\n\n*(2020-????) Own access to Microsoft Office Suite for holding 200 OFFICE tokens.*\n\n## Experiments\n\nSocial tokens have pioneered programmable access, with tools like Collab.Land and Mintgate enabling token-gated chat groups, newsletters, and articles. In Bryan Flynn’s *[The fractionalization of NFTs will lead to better social tokens](https://jammsession.mirror.xyz/-xYcfFRlhDdLDSUgRMTYJAaRJBs2VG4LP34DnOV84mI)*, Tokenized programmable access became popular in the summer of 2020 with a discord bot called Collab.Land which let any token community (ERC721 or ERC20) create their token-gated discords.\n\nSome examples of what tokenized access has gated:\n\n**1. Chat groups**\n\nThe first use case for tokenized access was token-gated chat groups, with FWB being the famous example. If you hold 55 Friends with Benefits (FWB) tokens, you can access the private discord that has some of the top creative talents in crypto. This has become quite popular among social tokens and has served as a strong mechanism for filtering for quality. For FWB specifically, participants need to apply and be approved in addition to holding tokens.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4c71b177-b30c-45d9-b1cb-a844ab667cd3.jpeg?height=932&width=1999)\n\n**2. Exclusive content**\n\nApps like Outpost allowed various communities to create token-gated newsletters. This can also be achieved with a mix of Mirror/Medium drafts that are token-gated with MintGate. When perfected, this model can be used to replace/disrupt software like Substack or Patreon. Brian Flynn, writer/leader of Jamm Session, talks about his move to token-gated content in his piece *[A Letter to Jamm Session Subscribers](https://jammsession.substack.com/p/a-letter-to-jamm-session-subscribers).*\n\n**3. Premium Products / Features**\n\nSome SaaS products have begun implementing token-gated access. In other words, users need to hold X amount of tokens to geet access to premium features. A great example of this is Astro Tools, which is displayed in the initial image of this article, gating certain features to their DeFi platform with their own ASTRO tokens. Holding 1,000 ASTRO gives you access to their unique block explorer with special filters. Holding 20,000 ASTRO gives you additional wallet tracking features.\n\n**4. Shared documents/canvas**\n\nThe Bored Apes Yacht Club NFT collection has gone viral over the last few weeks, with floor prices reaching ~4 ETH this week. On their website, they have a BAYC Bathroom, which is an open canvas, like a bar bathroom, where Ape holders can draw / paint. This is reminiscent of pixel walls but limited to Bored Apes only.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7442b68a-95e4-45d8-85be-a262b8682161.jpeg?height=598&width=1267)\n\n**5. Beta products**\n\nToken holders are usually a good representation of power users and loyal community members. This is why several projects have tokenized access to beta products to their token holdeers. We’ve witnessed Yearn do this with some of their beta apps, and Zora experimented with this with their TestFlight app and a token to go with it. Similarly, only WRITE token holders can use Mirror.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8bbb51b0-fcd6-40ca-9283-7f5174e8e56b.jpeg?height=336&width=491)\n\n**6. Exclusive Events**\n\nAs more communities and networks begin to leverage token-gated access, we’ve begun to witness physical events exclusively limited to token holders. A recent example of this was the FWB Miami party where only holders of 60 FWB tokens could get access to the [RSVP link](https://miami.fwb.help/rsvp).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/18d232e1-c8c8-4513-89a6-df52f2c03dba.jpeg?height=947&width=1563)\n\n**7. Unique NFTs**\n\nYou can imagine that NFTs can function as a sort of key or checkpoint that unlocks other NFTs. This is how the Golden State Warriors gated their most exclusive NFT: the Championship Banner. Holders needed all 6 Championship Ring NFTs in their wallet to access this. We’ve seen other cool examples over the last year, like WhaleDAOs NFT museum gating access to a certain VIP room solely for Whale NFT holders.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4c65681b-9805-431f-a072-24b7132dd68f.jpeg?height=512&width=1097)\n\n### Economic Alignment\n\nMany of us are used to getting our favorite products, services, and content for free, usually monetized by ads. Web3 business models are ‘better than free’, allowing consumers to invest by consuming and potentially earning from being early. Not only is this empowering for users, it comes with additional benefits. First, users are incentivized to become evangelists of the project, spreading it to their friends and family to boost demand for access. Second, there is a strong first-mover advantage, which should incentivize users to join early and establish some FOMO.\n\n### Composability\n\nIt’s also extremely composable meaning you could gate w multiple tokens and nfts at once easily; “need platinum access (own 10 WRITE, 100 ETH, 3 zNFTs or a crypto punk) to use this feature”. Imagine if they let RAC holders RSVP because they think it’s a cool community or collaborated on the party. They can do that despite RAC using Zora to mint and FWB minting on Roll. Let’s see Eventbrite and Facebook pull that off. There is also a great advantage here in terms of interoperability and customer targeting. One of the only times people used crypto this whole week in Miami was the token-gated FWB party, where RSVPing required holding FWB. Most if not all of those people didn't buy tokens at this rsvp page for this party. They've had them and their ownership of tokens represents membership over time: no payment, no gas, no email/data trail beyond eth address.\n\n### Liquidity\n\nIn traditional SaaS, users would be locked into a product/service for a set amount of time. But with tokenized services, consumers can liquidate, or sell their tokens, when they’re finished using the service. Additionally, they will be able to subscribe just for the amount of time that they’d like to, rather than commit forever.\n\n### Versatility\n\nTokens can serve multiple purposes. This is similar to how Amazon Prime gives subscribers access to faster delivery AND a suite of movies/shows ready for streaming. While Amazon Prime Music might be a failing product of its own, it increases demand and enhances utility that comes from being an Amazon Prime member.\n\nMany argue that there are serious issues with basing a token economic model on gated access, as consumers will purchase the tokens whenever they wish to access, rather than hold the token. Additionally, they may find themselves having to change their token supply to respond to market forces (the price of token going up or the number of tokens needed to access going down). To mediate this, we propose a lockup NFT model that can achieve long-term alignment between consumers and service providers.\n\nToken Emissions are the natural next step for SaaS because of the important consumer incentives, evangelism, and upside. Compared to existing models, it’s a whole lot less paying. Imagine claiming a concert NFT once and now having access to an artist’s Patreon forever, despite the concert being set up by completely different companies with no ties to Patreon.\n\n## Angel audiences\n\nImagine you’re in a five-year-long fishing competition with one of the best fishermen alive. You start with nothing but a hook and a small wooden raft, while he already has a nice rowboat, a bucket of baitfish, a rod, and some cash. Buying new supplies requires cash, which can only be earned by selling fish. Catching more and bigger fish requires better supplies. Play this out five years and guess who has managed to get a huge motorboat and land the blue marlin?\n\nThis is the competition new creators enter every day on the internet.\n\nZero marginal cost of distribution means that a single creator can serve endless fans without incurring major operational costs that make them charge more for the service. I can get a tennis lesson from one of the best players on tour, attend a live concert from a grammy-winning artist, and learn how to filet a halibut from a Michelin starred chef — all online, for next to nothing.\n\nIf the main challenge with building the creator middle class is helping creators establish initial traction, which systems would we need to put in place to make that possible? What existing models from other areas can we use for inspiration?\n\nIn startup land, angel investors fund projects at their very initial and riskiest steps. Although some do it to great profit, the term “angel” comes from the idea that the capital they provide is a godsend to entrepreneurs who would otherwise be too early to get investment from banks or have more established means. They are often former entrepreneurs themselves, interested in part just for the fun of it.\n\nCreators also need investment at very early moments before they find true content <> audience fit, but even just extending the analogy it’s clear that their angels will look different. If a startup’s angels are successful CEOs, a creator’s angels would be other successful creators.\n\nAnother fairly obvious but critically important difference between creators is that most creators have neither the desire nor capability to establish LLCs, issue shares, or otherwise build some way for people to share in the potential upside of their growth. A key reason for that is that most creators — even successful ones — won’t ever be so big that it warrants the overhead of setting up traditional shareholder-type structures.\n\nTokenized subscription could create an angel audience of other creators, investing in something very early and very risky with the dream of a potential upside but also just for the fun of it. We see this already with so much of what’s happening with Web3. There are pure speculators but that alone would be nowhere near enough to spin the wheel as fast as it is turning. Many people are making statements with their wallets about their values and the future they want to see, and the chances of a return just sweeten the deal.\n\n### Business Model\n\nTo better understand this model, let’s build standard revenue projections that one would expect from traditional SaaS.\n\nLet’s say you’re selling a new SaaS product (let’s call it “Saasy” for fun) and expect ~1000 subscribers to be willing to pay $5 for the service in monthly subscription fees. But you need >$10k/month to survive. In the past, your only options in this situation would be to raise venture capital. But if your early supporters are ‘true fans’, you now have an alternative option. Instead of subscription fees, you tokenize access to that service, requiring subscribers to hold $100 in SAAS tokens to access. You then mint and sell 9% of new tokens a month.\n\nBelow is a graph outlining 6 months of this token-gated business’ gross revenues. Several assumptions were made, such as a higher churn rate than usual (20%), because users can liquidate at any moment rather than wait until the end of the month, an 8% MoM growth in subscribers.\n\nInstead of calculating Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) as subscriptions * product price, here we multiply emissions by token price. The Churn Rate in this model is essentially the liquidation rate: existing users who sold because they get no more utility from the product.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/29798d71-a936-43a1-9093-a23d9f04bf04.jpeg?height=840&width=1350)\n\nIf the token price stays the same, the consumer can expect to pay/lose $27 in 6 months. **But, if your early subscribers think there’s at least a 20% chance you’ll gain 1000 net new subscribers in 6 months, this increases their expected return, so they’ll be willing to hold $100 worth of tokens, allowing you to earn $8 per user.**\n\nFor simplicity’s sake, we left out any speculating/trading, token buy-backs/burns, lock-ups/pools, or the various other tokenomics mechanisms that could be implemented here.\n\n### The Creator middle class\n\nRight now in the creator space, the closest thing to this model is in the upfront advances that more and more big platforms are paying creators to join and produce content. Substack, Clubhouse, Snapchat, Facebook, YouTube, and others all pay cash advances to creators in the hopes that they then generate even more revenue for the platform. So far, it makes sense that those platforms have benefited disproportionately from creator content and have remarkably deep pockets as a result. They can spread the risk of failure across a huge number of creators and offer cash upfront that creators couldn’t dream of otherwise. Especially for less established creators, that upfront cash is the only way they can dive in and build traction.\n\nWeb3 is pushing from several angles to make creators less dependent on platforms, and expanding the way creators can generate upfront financing would be a key way to do that. By all accounts, it seems that the primary revenue model for the next wave of creators is freemium, and tokenized subscriptions fit neatly into that frame.\n\nNo doubt there are many unanswered questions. The technology to enable this new model still has a way to go and, for it to be useful for most creators, it will have to become a whole lot less “crypto-y.” Web3 is growing fast, but most creators and consumers just want to create and consume content without having to dive too far down the rabbit hole. Unless the crypto can be hidden behind the surface, it seems likely that more traditional non-token access models will need to live in parallel for creators to maximize their revenue.\n\nThe building blocks are all in place for angel audiences and tokenized subscriptions, and the potential implications are huge. It won’t be for everyone or every creator, but even if incentivizing early financing could increase creator innovation by 1%, the compounding dividends overtime for all of us would be astronomical; a bigger creator middle class, less dependent on huge platforms, and more connected to the audience that can help them grow.\n\n### Web3 Freemium\n\nMembership models are not and will not have to be binary – free or gated, fees or tokens – the answer is probably both or all. I think if there’s a Slack free, Slack teams, Slack pro, and Slack partners and partners need tokens but get additional advantages/features/sales/etc. people will do that and bet that there will be a demand for that tier in the future.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUltimately, tokenized software and services will enable new economics and incentives for creators and small businesses. This can be paired with free or traditional subscription fees to empower super users/fans without adding friction. This is good for customers since they can pay less and have a better experience. It’s good for creators since they can sustain their businesses. It’s also good for investors since they don’t need to give up equity and can have a real stake in the success of that business.\n\n[Token #3749](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3749&auctionId=0x1516edb282ab5a8c1e87892f07df08a6378434fb1d3b62d382d9dc818bc4168d)\n\n### If you'd like to support without bidding on the NFT, send us a tip here!

{"id": "YaAowksdGS4nmQ_WIAssKt2uEARRkHSav0ZtKT_kHvo", "title": "Tokenized Access and Subscriptions", "body": "![see NFT auction below](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3195373-f5f3-4e66-b228-c435702c8a63.jpeg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nThe focus of this piece is to highlight the important business opportunities that social tokens and NFTs enable for services, software, and creators without 3rd party investment. We cover what tokenized access and subscriptions look like, ongoing experiments with the tech, as well as the numerous advantages over traditional SaaS. We purposefully don’t dive specifically into other important benefits that token economies can provide services willing to decentralize, such as governance, DAOs, etc. We mainly focus on the argument that all or most SaaS and creator businesses can and should tokenize subscriptions to their services.\n\nTokenized services are especially powerful for creators, allowing them to focus on providing a good service, finding customers who want the service (a market fit), and focusing on bringing that customer value. This is good for customers since they can pay less and have a better experience. It’s good for creators since they can sustain their businesses.\n\n### TradSaaS\n\nIf you watch movies, listen to music, or own a phone, you’re probably familiar with subscriptions. At least, your wallet is. Instead of selling you today, tomorrow, and next week, they only need to convince you once and the money keeps coming. It’s a steady and predictable stream of revenue. Because each customer is so valuable, they can focus more on keeping them than doing anything and everything to get more.\n\nThe current standard Software as a service subscription model consists of monthly/yearly recurring payments. It started in publishing, and now it is used in almost all industries, from businesses like New York Times, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Seamless, and Peloton.\n\nWhere does it end? Let’s divide subscriptions into two categories. The first one is services, like Netflix, Prime, Lootcrate, and Spotify, which kinda have to be subscriptions. Sure, you can buy music and movies individually but here, you get everything. Subscription boxes, which send you new things in the mail every month, are services because they’re more about fun and surprise than the stuff itself. And then there are products - things that could be sold, but here are rented.\n\n> *Access trumps ownership. That’s the mantra behind the “subscription economy”.* - [The Economist](https://applied.economist.com/articles/a-notion-worth-subscribing-to)\n\nWhat the Economist is referring to as ownership is the mere ownership of one copy of a product or service, as was common in Web1 SaaS (*Buy Microsoft Office '09 for a one-time payment of $100)*. Your business needs either capital or recurring revenue to exist. Subscriptions are the best recurring revenue model. Current SaaS subscriptions are broken. Tokens make subscriptions better for creators and customers\n\n### Enter Community Tokens and DAOs\n\nBy using tokens as a means of purchasing access to a service, consumers can participate in the potential upside of the demand of that service. They will hold a premium on what they're receiving because they get to earn from the other side of the success. If users have any inclination or any belief that other users will want to use this product, there will be an increase in demand for this product and therefore increasing demand for the token. They will put a premium on it.\n\nTakeaway: Use tokens to create a better subscription model for your business.\n\n### Tokenized Access\n\nTokenized access is the system of gating/limiting content, features, or whole platforms with tokens, requiring users to own/hold specific tokens or NFTs. Teams/creators then monetize by releasing/minting new tokens (inflation) to sell to new customers/speculators. In its full form, it’ll feel like subscribing or going through a paywall. This can be used to gate anything and can be coupled with free and traditional subscription options.\n\n**If you held $10,000 in bitcoin for the last month, you paid $15/m to secure it.**\n\nYou didn't pay in subscription fees but rather in agreed-upon inflation. The circulating supply of BTC grew by 0.15% and your holdings' purchasing power was diluted as a result. This newly minted bitcoin was given to miners as block rewards and helped secure their holdings. Block rewards are a form of revenue for miners, and they’re critical to maintaining bitcoin.\n\nInflation-Based Revenue is not new but has been used by governments for generations now. For example, to increase revenue, the US government can, among other things, increase taxes (yearly 'subscription') or print money (inflation).\n\nWhat if we applied that same line of thinking to SaaS products: B2B, tools, newsletters, passion economy, etc.? Could token subscriptions be valuable to work on in their world?\n\nIn line with the transition from passion economy to ownership economy, [as beautifully broken down by Jesse Walden](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/), crypto emissions can be thought of as a consistent and stable revenue model for businesses and teams. Token minting is SaaS backward and powerful for users if structured correctly. This could be thought of as the natural next step for consumer software monetization. For example, Microsoft could hypothetically utilize it as their next business model for Microsoft Office:\n\n*(1995-2010) Buy Microsoft Office '09 for $100*\n\n*(2010-2020) Rent Microsoft Office Suite for $9.99 / month*\n\n*(2020-????) Own access to Microsoft Office Suite for holding 200 OFFICE tokens.*\n\n## Experiments\n\nSocial tokens have pioneered programmable access, with tools like Collab.Land and Mintgate enabling token-gated chat groups, newsletters, and articles. In Bryan Flynn’s *[The fractionalization of NFTs will lead to better social tokens](https://jammsession.mirror.xyz/-xYcfFRlhDdLDSUgRMTYJAaRJBs2VG4LP34DnOV84mI)*, Tokenized programmable access became popular in the summer of 2020 with a discord bot called Collab.Land which let any token community (ERC721 or ERC20) create their token-gated discords.\n\nSome examples of what tokenized access has gated:\n\n**1. Chat groups**\n\nThe first use case for tokenized access was token-gated chat groups, with FWB being the famous example. If you hold 55 Friends with Benefits (FWB) tokens, you can access the private discord that has some of the top creative talents in crypto. This has become quite popular among social tokens and has served as a strong mechanism for filtering for quality. For FWB specifically, participants need to apply and be approved in addition to holding tokens.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4c71b177-b30c-45d9-b1cb-a844ab667cd3.jpeg?height=932&width=1999)\n\n**2. Exclusive content**\n\nApps like Outpost allowed various communities to create token-gated newsletters. This can also be achieved with a mix of Mirror/Medium drafts that are token-gated with MintGate. When perfected, this model can be used to replace/disrupt software like Substack or Patreon. Brian Flynn, writer/leader of Jamm Session, talks about his move to token-gated content in his piece *[A Letter to Jamm Session Subscribers](https://jammsession.substack.com/p/a-letter-to-jamm-session-subscribers).*\n\n**3. Premium Products / Features**\n\nSome SaaS products have begun implementing token-gated access. In other words, users need to hold X amount of tokens to geet access to premium features. A great example of this is Astro Tools, which is displayed in the initial image of this article, gating certain features to their DeFi platform with their own ASTRO tokens. Holding 1,000 ASTRO gives you access to their unique block explorer with special filters. Holding 20,000 ASTRO gives you additional wallet tracking features.\n\n**4. Shared documents/canvas**\n\nThe Bored Apes Yacht Club NFT collection has gone viral over the last few weeks, with floor prices reaching ~4 ETH this week. On their website, they have a BAYC Bathroom, which is an open canvas, like a bar bathroom, where Ape holders can draw / paint. This is reminiscent of pixel walls but limited to Bored Apes only.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7442b68a-95e4-45d8-85be-a262b8682161.jpeg?height=598&width=1267)\n\n**5. Beta products**\n\nToken holders are usually a good representation of power users and loyal community members. This is why several projects have tokenized access to beta products to their token holdeers. We’ve witnessed Yearn do this with some of their beta apps, and Zora experimented with this with their TestFlight app and a token to go with it. Similarly, only WRITE token holders can use Mirror.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8bbb51b0-fcd6-40ca-9283-7f5174e8e56b.jpeg?height=336&width=491)\n\n**6. Exclusive Events**\n\nAs more communities and networks begin to leverage token-gated access, we’ve begun to witness physical events exclusively limited to token holders. A recent example of this was the FWB Miami party where only holders of 60 FWB tokens could get access to the [RSVP link](https://miami.fwb.help/rsvp).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/18d232e1-c8c8-4513-89a6-df52f2c03dba.jpeg?height=947&width=1563)\n\n**7. Unique NFTs**\n\nYou can imagine that NFTs can function as a sort of key or checkpoint that unlocks other NFTs. This is how the Golden State Warriors gated their most exclusive NFT: the Championship Banner. Holders needed all 6 Championship Ring NFTs in their wallet to access this. We’ve seen other cool examples over the last year, like WhaleDAOs NFT museum gating access to a certain VIP room solely for Whale NFT holders.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4c65681b-9805-431f-a072-24b7132dd68f.jpeg?height=512&width=1097)\n\n### Economic Alignment\n\nMany of us are used to getting our favorite products, services, and content for free, usually monetized by ads. Web3 business models are ‘better than free’, allowing consumers to invest by consuming and potentially earning from being early. Not only is this empowering for users, it comes with additional benefits. First, users are incentivized to become evangelists of the project, spreading it to their friends and family to boost demand for access. Second, there is a strong first-mover advantage, which should incentivize users to join early and establish some FOMO.\n\n### Composability\n\nIt’s also extremely composable meaning you could gate w multiple tokens and nfts at once easily; “need platinum access (own 10 WRITE, 100 ETH, 3 zNFTs or a crypto punk) to use this feature”. Imagine if they let RAC holders RSVP because they think it’s a cool community or collaborated on the party. They can do that despite RAC using Zora to mint and FWB minting on Roll. Let’s see Eventbrite and Facebook pull that off. There is also a great advantage here in terms of interoperability and customer targeting. One of the only times people used crypto this whole week in Miami was the token-gated FWB party, where RSVPing required holding FWB. Most if not all of those people didn't buy tokens at this rsvp page for this party. They've had them and their ownership of tokens represents membership over time: no payment, no gas, no email/data trail beyond eth address.\n\n### Liquidity\n\nIn traditional SaaS, users would be locked into a product/service for a set amount of time. But with tokenized services, consumers can liquidate, or sell their tokens, when they’re finished using the service. Additionally, they will be able to subscribe just for the amount of time that they’d like to, rather than commit forever.\n\n### Versatility\n\nTokens can serve multiple purposes. This is similar to how Amazon Prime gives subscribers access to faster delivery AND a suite of movies/shows ready for streaming. While Amazon Prime Music might be a failing product of its own, it increases demand and enhances utility that comes from being an Amazon Prime member.\n\nMany argue that there are serious issues with basing a token economic model on gated access, as consumers will purchase the tokens whenever they wish to access, rather than hold the token. Additionally, they may find themselves having to change their token supply to respond to market forces (the price of token going up or the number of tokens needed to access going down). To mediate this, we propose a lockup NFT model that can achieve long-term alignment between consumers and service providers.\n\nToken Emissions are the natural next step for SaaS because of the important consumer incentives, evangelism, and upside. Compared to existing models, it’s a whole lot less paying. Imagine claiming a concert NFT once and now having access to an artist’s Patreon forever, despite the concert being set up by completely different companies with no ties to Patreon.\n\n## Angel audiences\n\nImagine you’re in a five-year-long fishing competition with one of the best fishermen alive. You start with nothing but a hook and a small wooden raft, while he already has a nice rowboat, a bucket of baitfish, a rod, and some cash. Buying new supplies requires cash, which can only be earned by selling fish. Catching more and bigger fish requires better supplies. Play this out five years and guess who has managed to get a huge motorboat and land the blue marlin?\n\nThis is the competition new creators enter every day on the internet.\n\nZero marginal cost of distribution means that a single creator can serve endless fans without incurring major operational costs that make them charge more for the service. I can get a tennis lesson from one of the best players on tour, attend a live concert from a grammy-winning artist, and learn how to filet a halibut from a Michelin starred chef — all online, for next to nothing.\n\nIf the main challenge with building the creator middle class is helping creators establish initial traction, which systems would we need to put in place to make that possible? What existing models from other areas can we use for inspiration?\n\nIn startup land, angel investors fund projects at their very initial and riskiest steps. Although some do it to great profit, the term “angel” comes from the idea that the capital they provide is a godsend to entrepreneurs who would otherwise be too early to get investment from banks or have more established means. They are often former entrepreneurs themselves, interested in part just for the fun of it.\n\nCreators also need investment at very early moments before they find true content <> audience fit, but even just extending the analogy it’s clear that their angels will look different. If a startup’s angels are successful CEOs, a creator’s angels would be other successful creators.\n\nAnother fairly obvious but critically important difference between creators is that most creators have neither the desire nor capability to establish LLCs, issue shares, or otherwise build some way for people to share in the potential upside of their growth. A key reason for that is that most creators — even successful ones — won’t ever be so big that it warrants the overhead of setting up traditional shareholder-type structures.\n\nTokenized subscription could create an angel audience of other creators, investing in something very early and very risky with the dream of a potential upside but also just for the fun of it. We see this already with so much of what’s happening with Web3. There are pure speculators but that alone would be nowhere near enough to spin the wheel as fast as it is turning. Many people are making statements with their wallets about their values and the future they want to see, and the chances of a return just sweeten the deal.\n\n### Business Model\n\nTo better understand this model, let’s build standard revenue projections that one would expect from traditional SaaS.\n\nLet’s say you’re selling a new SaaS product (let’s call it “Saasy” for fun) and expect ~1000 subscribers to be willing to pay $5 for the service in monthly subscription fees.

The cultural significance of the collection lies not only in the Punks, which have already achieved legendary status in the space, but in going beyond the initial purchase and its canonization through the use of different on-chain tools: fractionalization for financial purposes and community building, and JPG for a curatorial provenance and viewing experience.\n\n*“In early August I purchased 104 Cryptopunks, despite primarily viewing myself as an investor rather than a collector. While the pixelated PFP style may not be as showroom-worthy as other NFT art, Cryptopunks represent a generational shift in art-medium, moving from physical to digital, and were a true innovation both pre-dating and inspiring the ERC-721 token standard.* *This gallery, created in collaboration with the wonderful team at JPG, aims to display (sometimes humorously) the nuanced attributes and artistic elements of my Cryptopunk collection. The collection was acquired by sweeping the punk ‘floor’, a term that often refers to the undifferentiated hodge-podge of the least desirable items in an NFT collection.”* - 0x650d\n\nBeyond the interesting personal journey, 0x650d has had with this gallery, this curation provides an unfamiliar viewing experience of Cryptopunks, as well as a new experience around a fractionalized collection. \\\\n  \\\\n For those of you (us), who have spent hours looking at punks on the Larva Labs website or Opensea, the possible assortment of punks to view has been limited by search options of attributes or price. It’s rare you see punks with no attributes in common next to one another unless it is in the total randomness of what’s for sale or recently sold. Here, however, we are able to see some of the connections, the flow of aesthetics and themes, that obviously existed but rarely were seen.\n\nThis idea of seeing is also particularly interesting when it comes to fractionalized collections. While it’s an interesting financial and community tool, fractionalization can have the effect of decreasing the ‘aura’ around an art piece/ cultural object — basically, it feels “less like art”. It ends up obscured by the ERC20 ticker and you lose some of the magic feelings of looking at the actual object. By intentionally displaying the pieces that have been fractionalized, however, you get some of that aura back.  So while at first, this exhibition might appeal more to the collectibles crowd than the art historians, there are some interesting conceptual elements going on in what 0x650d has created.
