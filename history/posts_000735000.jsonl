methods. the ideation process is the fun part of writing, but the actual writing part isn't always a blast. this is where ai comes in handy: i can feed gpt-3 an idea and it can write about the idea for me. i develop the method and then the robot does the work. it's truly a dream come true.\n\nin retrospect, i realized that my method-focused book, *[it's not abstraction it's literally](quasimatt.me/notabstraction)* just lying, spent a lot of time trying to navigate and understand the way thought gets sickened in isolation—the way it becomes self-referential and recursive. this idea is explicitly addressed in this section, which was the result of blending some internal and external struggles i was having at the time:\n\n*what if you didn’t leave the city block that you lived on for a month and you didn’t have a job and you only ever walked to the store and then went back to your apartment and you kept getting the same ingredients at the store and you had your own garden where you always grew the same things because you liked them and you knew how to grow them well and you always got spices at the store and you made the same stew every day and you added in the vegetables from your garden and the spices from the store and you had it every day and you were alone and the flavors got bland and you kept adding more of the same ingredients and you used to go have dinner somewhere else and you used to have friends over and you used to have to serve up dishes that they liked and you used to have to care about what they wanted but you don’t have to do that anymore and oh my god where is the flavor you have to add something so you add a bunch of salt and it keeps happening and you keep eating the same thing and you keep making it more flavorful and the stew isn’t good for you and it starts to make you feel sick but it happens kind of slowly so you don’t notice and you just get used to being a little bit sickly and then the month that you were alone is over and you go out into the world and you go out to a restaurant and they give you some food and you don’t like it because it’s not what you’re used to and your friend comes over and they try your stew and they think it’s disgusting because you’ve put too much flavor and too much salt and they tell you it’s gross and you could either conclude that the stew is maybe a little gross to them or maybe they’re just wrong and ungrateful and maybe the food at the restaurant was normal and you’re the one with the weird palate or maybe the restaurant is wrong and it doesn’t make sense that the food is universally gross because it’s a restaurant and lots of people go there and they seem to enjoy it and you kind of know that but you don’t like it so you think to yourself maybe staying home was better and maybe my stew is better and maybe i just have good taste and you get a little sicker and you get a little sicker and the stew has so much salt in it and you never eat anywhere else and you’re so sick and you don’t even know it because you’re used to it and the stew tastes so good*\n\ni also identified and explored an analog to intellectual or academic specialization, where one often continuously abandons outside details, dwelling on increasingly esoteric minutia. without external involvement, thoughts become increasingly detached. in some cases, this can be beneficial: certainly scientific and technological advancement is often predicated on extreme specialization. the results can go either way.\n\nemulating this isolated and self-referential process using gpt-3 is rather simple:\n1. feed gpt-3 an initial text\n2. read the multiple outputs of gpt and select one to add\n3. feed the entire text into gpt-3 again\n\nthe question that remains is what initial text to base the project on. you're reading the initial text right now. not only does the method define the process by which the content is made, but the motivation and methods section also defines the content itself.\n\n**output:**\n\nwith this story, i intentionally selected themes and elements that i knew would later flare up in my output and exaggerated them. the abject nature of the stew and the aggressive addition of salt were both exaggerated, but both elements, particularly the stew, were inspired by real life.\n\nmaking the stew:\n\nbalancing humor, anecdote, and plot\n\nfinding the right balance of story, humor, and plot can prove quite difficult. story is the method by which discussion is furthered. humor and anecdote are the catalysts of reflection. how to effect each varied greatly in this section:\n\nit was a hot day and you had the stew in the oven and a lot of it was evaporating and lost and you thought it was very good but maybe a tad too salty, but you weren’t sure and you had a bunch of salt left so you just kept adding salt because you figured if it’s just a little too salty, adding more salt makes it less salty, and you added salt for a while and you put in a bunch of some ingredient that seemed salty, and, in the end, the stew was very salty and you had to go outside because you had to pee and when you went outside it was really cold and you had to pee a lot and it was just a bad time to be outside and then you went inside and then it was hot and you didn’t want to eat the stew because it was very salty, so you didn’t, and you kept adding salt to your food because you didn’t want to remember that it was very salty\n\ni don't want to over-emphasize my food-related issues. despite frequent consumption issues, i eat a lot. maybe too much. while it's common to hear about other artists compulsively eating art, i know no musician who eats his music as much as i do. i had an art show in 2015 where the visuals and the music were both actually food. the music has a past of performance art components, especially since i'm a visual artist too. there's food, and then there's food.\n\nusing anecdote and humor saves the section from being too explicit. many of the elements of the stew were combined with real world incidents. the stew also contains distressing imagery. how can you need salty and feel sick? the answer is nuanced.\n\nin part, this real-life flavor was an attempt to balance this section with the slew of narrative-based pieces that came before. hmmmmmmm...\n\nthe story:\n\nintellectual specialization\n\nwe've established that the methods used in the pieces inform and even create the content. obviously, there are situations where we must slip out of this closed process, but, on the other hand, the content can continue to define the process itself.\n\nhere, the repetitious nature of the process is the content of the section. this section was designed to demonstrate a process that was very difficult to remain involved in. sure, it was interesting at the beginning - exploring the vastness of private discovery and the infinite possibilities of thought. but it is interesting to keep doing it over and over? when the results are always the same? it starts to feel meaningless after a while.\n\nis the poem a process that should only be defined by the content?\n\noutput:\n\ndiscovery\n\nthis is the final section, so it should be the biggest and best, right? this is where you get all these strange stories that pack a huge punch - all of them selected from the massive, expansive, epic poem of ultra-specialization. but here, we have a few different stories...but they're mostly similar. they're all some sort of raw cannibalism. like, there's a lot of them, alright?\n\nit may not have the most immediate impact physically, but it has a really peculiar effect on an individual's psyche. it urges you to think about the consequences of being alone so much: learning to assimilate the self, finding meaning in repetition, needing food when you're alone....\n\nthis is where gpt-3 gets to the heart of the issue: intellectual specialization is an extreme and, perhaps, sophisticated process. while necessary and even essential to many things, it can have a negative effect on the individual involved and, at times, the environment.\n\ntake this passage, for example:\n\nafter a while, you start to lose your taste for the stew, so you leave the stew in a bowl in the closet for a year, and you ask your friends if they’d like some stew and they agree because they are all very hungry and you go in the closet and you get the bowl and you walk over to them but they are, in fact, wolves and they eat you.\n\nby commenting on individual relationships, the narrative becomes re-contextualized as a stew of character. the action of asking if they'd like some stew is essentially the same as asking if they want to mix. the person-eating-dinner is a social interaction. the reader is an outlier who doesn't understand the conversation and is thus deemed invalid.\n\nor, in a different narrative:\n\nyou eat the stew and you get sick and you get sicker and you get sicker and you never eat anywhere else and you eat the stew so much that it’s all you will ever eat and eventually you die\n\nwhile these stories seem bleak, they serve a greater purpose: they humanize this outlandish operation with something relatable. in fact, the result is something like putting yourself in this overspecialized situation. how would you feel? can you relate? how and why does this type of behavior begin to swallow itself?\n\nthe repeated nature and isolation can become overbearing and, eventually, suffocating. isolating yourself a bit too much hurts a little and it hurts a lot...but maybe, for some people, it builds something stronger? maybe the process of isolation is necessary before learning alienation?\n\nconnecting to the reader, and a brief mention of something else\n\nthe section ends with a brief discussion of reader engagement. basically, this is something that i personally wish could have been stronger. i have a very demented voice, and i'm not sure if that's always appreciated. i thought about this at length before publishing this project. i tried to figure out how i could subtly discuss this in the text. i briefly mention it a few times within the body of the text. is it enough? i doubt it.\n\nbut that's not what you're supposed to do. that's my problem, not yours. but i feel it's worth mentioning.\n\nthe methods, the content, the reader....all of these drove this project. while this project was ideal by design, it turns out that real life is messier than i expected.\n\nif someone reads this work and gets inspired to become an intellectual specialist, that's great because they're going to do something amazing. i've been deeply inspired by people who specialize themselves in some way. they have a deeper understanding of the world around them and this is how they can contribute.\n\nbut if they read this work and realize that they're freaking weird, or that they're becoming weird...and that they should stop. then they will surely turn their life towards something wonderful - that, too.\n\ngpt-3 is not a moral tale or even a cautionary tale. it's a weird story about someone who specializes.", "timestamp": 1627234420, "digest":

It allows you to create a wallet that can be controlled by multiple people and requires a minimum number of signatures before executing a transaction. \n\nGnosis Safe can be run in a trustless manner as the frontend, backend, and Smart Contracts are entirely open source. Gnosis supports ERC-20 and ERC-721, which means all your tokens and NFTs can be managed through the wallet. You can use the web, desktop, and mobile interfaces to access the safe. \n\n## Why is it important?\nWhen you use a wallet like Metamask, it’s secured with a private key. If that key ends up in the wrong hands, your funds are compromised. It isn’t possible to share access securely with multiple people as one individual could control the funds in the wallet without the authorization of others. Gnosis Safe allows multiple wallets to be added and set a minimum number of signatures needed to execute a transaction. \n\nFor example, Let’s say you and three other friends purchased some ETH jointly. You can create a Gnosis safe, add all four wallets to the safe. Now, you can set that you need a minimum of 3 signatures for a transaction to execute. This allows you to share control over the funds with multiple people while preventing them from being lost due to a single point of failure.\n\n## Setup a Gnosis Safe with multiple signers\n### 1. Connect your wallet to Gnosis Safe\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/edf4149b-9b06-4a60-bd63-842e794cd1ef.png?height=1190&width=2486)\n\n### 2. Create a New Safe\n- Enter the Name of the Safe and press Start. This name is for your convenience only and will not be shared with any third party.\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7401cd40-b155-4929-bde5-83a8f0c2ec4a.png?height=1234&width=1744)\n\n- Add the wallet addresses of the owners of this safe and select the minimum number of confirmations required to execute a transaction. I’ve set 2 out of 3, which means that any transaction requires at least two of the three wallets listed to confirm before execution.\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fa29a787-bec8-4673-9483-83a4c1debc59.png?height=1176&width=1308)\n\n- Click on Review and make sure the settings are correct.\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/27525cd0-9ea7-48ff-bb47-f885d1d701c5.png?height=918&width=1396)\n\n \n- Click on Submit to create the safe. Once you pay the gas fee, you will see the Safe Creation Process Screen. Wait for the process to complete and display the success message you see below.\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1cdf3cbe-4588-4d4b-a8f8-48c6ad74bcb4.png?height=1084&width=2518)\n\nCongratulations!

{"id": "K1_rED0NWbxZUzQqfKYrBhe7wHjjgyFtc_MVlI1r4Ew", "title": "DAOs brought me back to crypto", "body": "When the people I loved most in crypto, the OGs at r/EthTrader, broke off and formed a new subreddit, r/EthFinance in 2019, I was bummed. I migrated to r/EthFinance with them, but I could never get comfortable with the signaling of the moniker r/EthFinance at the top of the stack. I was more excited by DAOs than DeFi. If we needed a new name, why not something more inclusive, like r/EthEverything?\n\nAt the time I became obsessed with Ethereum in 2016, I was a middle manager at a big company. I was sick of the bullshit, bureaucracy, central decision making and required ass kissing. The promise of DAO's, new types of organizations that functioned differently, appealed to me more than disrupting Wall Street.\n\nThen after making a big crypto windfall in early 2018, when I was sequestered for a couple of years [writing a book](https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Crypto-Millionaire-Unlikely-Corporate-ebook/dp/B07VBS7Z5K#customerReviews) that explained how that happened, DeFi took off.\n\nMy ambivalence about DeFi was misplaced. It’s awesome, structurally-radical and also ironically populated by DAOs. But it will never be poetry to me. Disrupting Wall Street is cool, but disrupting the foundation of corporations across the board, with more general purpose DAOs is more interesting. And disrupting and/or innovating and/or invigorating the very associations that are breaking down in America, from political parties, to service clubs, to social groups like bowling leagues with social DAOs as Jarrod Dicker  describes in his [excellent essay](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/eYRttcLec0IXODpzLFsHZTRdzuWosBwfyVKnSc93NdA)? \n\nI’m here for it. \n\nFor most of 2020, I was crypto-exhausted. Living the bear and bull markets of 2016-2018, then writing a book and marketing it (plus talking about it constantly) between 2019-2020 took all of my energy. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2d9c09ff-361a-4b1d-a470-542055265af9.PNG?height=2688&width=1242)\n\n\n\nI started to think that crypto was just a phase for me. While I’d always be a cheerleader for Ethereum in particular, and decentralization in general, I’d focus my attention elsewhere. Maybe travel more.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/25408539-0d7b-4b23-a7e1-4d2e717036f2.PNG?height=896&width=414)\n\n \n\nI made some bad choices. In early 2020 Vitalik was speaking at an event in my area. A friend whom I’d introduced to crypto, sent me the invite and said, Let’s Go! I told him I wasn’t in the mood. My friend was shocked. He knew what a Vitalik fan-boy I had been. In my recent worldview, Vitalik could have pulled an Andy Kaufman and read the phone book on stage for four hours and at the end I'd be cheering \"Bravo! You've done it again, V!\" To this day I still follow his kooky yet awesome father on Twitter, even though he trolled me once. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/DanConway650/status/1411735131774087168?s=20\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DanConway650/status/1411737328591130627?s=20\n\nBack then, (as it is today in some quarters) it was all about ETH as ultra sound money, on repeat. And when I say on repeat, I mean brainwash-level repeat, 24/7, because crypto never sleeps. \n\nGood soldiers in a righteous battle, but I needed a break.\n\nWhen the bull market reemerged earlier this year, I started paying closer attention for purely financial reasons (that’s a pretty uncommon reason, right?) We bought a new house and I needed to sell some more ETH. So I turned to my trusted financial advisor(s) on crypto twitter to figure out where the price was headed. \n\nMy Class of 2017 twitter feed hadn’t evolved much over the years. So I pared back all the old bores (BTC maxis) and  looked for people and projects that sounded interesting.  \nI started following Jess Sloss @thattallguy, Cooper Turley @Cooopahtroopa and a handful of others. Those feeds led me to dozens of interesting people and projects. \n\n**Then… BOOM, right back down the rabbit hole I went, like the crypto junkie I am and always will be.** \n\nIn quick succession I secured my ENS, started using MetaMask for the *first* *time* (shameful, but true), joined Friends with Benefits, entered the Mirror $WriteRace to get my own Web3 domain and joined the Discords for Forefront and SeedClub. I interacted directly with many of the big brain thought-leaders and actual implementers of social tokens and DAOs on Twitter or Zoom. Social tokens are still in the magical early period where that’s possible. The early prophets don't yet have 200K or more twitter followers. Soon they will.\n\nI also joined the impressive Bankless DAO, though the content there still bores me. (To be clear, I’m bullish on its prospects and supportive of its mission). \n\nI am in the phase of obsession where I can bend every conversation to social tokens and/or DAOs, regardless of how implausible it is for most people to get involved just now.\n\n *Your kid’s taking college physics?* \nThat’s a math-y connection. Has she considered learning solidity to earn some DAO-bounties? \n*Your Uncle Fred likes art?* \nMight want to check out PleasrDAO. Let me explain. \n*You like to read?* \nThe zeitgeist right now is on FWB. Want a link?  \n\nI believe DAOs will change the world. I believe tokenized communities will have superpowers. I believe media will decentralize, invigorating public discourse. I believe all sorts of weird things are going to happen that we can’t forecast. And I have a lot of other beliefs, none of which are novel or original, because at this point I’m mainly a parrot for what I’ve absorbed from the social token/DAO community. In time I hope to share some original thinking and advance a small corner of this new space.  \n\nI’m also going to write about other stuff, because I’m a human being with interests and concerns outside of crypto. I’m a normal-neurotic with a need to be heard. My first writing was a column in my high school newspaper, *Conway’s Corner*. I shared tidbits of gossip, criticized the principal for screwing up the lunch service and waxed on about items of concern for sixteen year old’s in the San Francisco Bay Area. \n\nTo be honest, high school was a happy time for me, before bouts of addiction, depression and other adult complications emerged in my twenties.  Later in life, becoming immersed in the crypto community was another oasis of positive vibes and goodness, at a time when I needed it. Yes, it saved me financially. But more importantly, it connected me with an overwhelming feeling of possibility that usually only comes when you are young.\n\nSo I'm calling this publication/website *Conway’s Corner*. It's a tribute to the the joy I felt having my words published for the first time, and the joy crypto has brought me, decades later. I hope you will stick around and read some of my stuff.\n\n**Note: I feel like a schlepp not using the NFT/Auction and other exotic Web3 tools that Mirror allows me. But as one of the relatively few people in the world with access to Mirror right now, I feel a stronger obligation to publish. And I'm afraid that I might accidentally auction an NFT of a body part, since I don't know what I'm doing. So I'm erring on the side of speed this week while I figure out how the rest of this stuff works. **\n\n****\n\n", "timestamp": 1627279472, "digest": "Fs__Loi2MmV0N6xiaFAHGLvuUGGwaz3vRtGgAx8MjG8", "contributor": "0xfbdf598dB4dBA841f40680Cd9C2D3cF618265be0"}

The space has you covered for anything ranging from [peer-to-protocol lending protocols](https://aave.com/) to [insurance policies that protect users from loss of funds due to protocol bugs](https://nexusmutual.io/). Derivative protocols like [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) have you covered for any investments in non ETH-based assets, and you need look no further than [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/) for all your cash-settled options trading needs. \n\nThe space is quickly starting to resemble a fully functional financial system, with all the applications and systems needed for standard retail investor transactions established and regularly audited, but also the most niche structured products thriving and innovating further with every passing day. \n\nHowever, the most striking difference is that DeFi is trying to do what TradFi (Traditional Finance) did over the past 2,000 years in just a couple of years. This pace of innovation is in large part aided by the true and native [composability](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-true-power-of-defi-composability-14fe8355e0d0#:~:text=Composability%2C%20in%20DeFi%2C%20is%20the,and%20therefore%20each%20other's%20utility.) of DeFi which allows projects to seamlessly integrate with each other like Lego and create mind-blowing synergies. DeFi is well on its way to catching up to TradFi in terms of functionality and has its eyes set on surpassing it as soon as the mainstream is ready. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6d974fc1-8031-47f3-9f5b-4bda5509abc9.png?height=700&width=1801)\n\nThe future is bright for DeFi, and the space is always vibrant and full of energy, no matter the state of the overall crypto market. We are still a while away from widespread adoption of DeFi, and as many people often say, *we are still early*. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), the most popular chrome extension based wallet used to interact with DeFi, only recently reached 5 million monthly active users. Mainstream adoption too soon would potentially come at the wrong time for DeFi as the applications may not be properly optimised to support the large and sudden influx of users, but I have had a lot of time to think about this problem lately and have come to some conclusions about what I believe are the main hurdles DeFi needs to surpass before it is truly ready for the *mainnet* to hit the *mainstream*.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76a440fa-1ae5-443a-97fd-356ebd1a0f25.png?height=848&width=2152)\n\nI call these hurdles **the Three \"U\"s of DeFi Ubiquity**.\n\n## Usability\n\nThe first, and arguably most important of these hurdles to ubiquity, is usability. Many of the most successful DeFi protocols are advanced, regularly audited and professionally run but have user interfaces that are unapproachable to all but the most sophisticated investors. In reality, the underlying service these protocols are offering is groundbreaking in the quest for the democratisation of many of the world's most powerful financial instruments which were previously unavailable to most retail investors. Consequently it is important that the people set to benefit the most from this democratisation are also able to understand and use these tools without having to resort to financial advisors.\n\nThe key to this issue is going to be knowing which parts of the UI to hide, and which to display prominently. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is one of the market leaders in keeping its UI simple yet powerful. Still, there will eventually be a divergence of the consumer level interfaces and pro-level interfaces using the same backend, a bit like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) vs [Coinbase **Pro**](https://pro.coinbase.com) to really drive this point home. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) does not focus greatly on UI refinement at the moment, but it will take a [beginner-friendly browser wallet](https://rainbow.me) that has a good fiat on-ramp and perhaps doesn't even refer to itself as a wallet but more as a key to Web3 to really help push DApps into the mainstream. \n\nIncreasingly we will start to see startups cropping up worldwide in various industries focusing on leveraging DeFi technologies to verticalise and fine-tune the experience for different audiences with different financial preferences. The technology behind many of the most popular DeFi protocols is optimised for scale, performance and reliability, so there is a wide-open opportunity for startups to come into specific geographies such as developing economies, where debt financing for small businesses is harder to come by, and build a straightforward front end. This front end could then automatically tap into the sea of open-source protocols and liquidity that is readily available. It could then focus on making it accessible to non-crypto-native audiences with seamless on-ramps for Fiat which, in the future, could allow someone in Venezuela to take out a loan using stablecoins on [AAVE](http://aave.com/) using an [L2 solution like Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) without ever noticing that they have done all of this on a trustless and decentralised back end. \n\nIdeally, customers would eventually be aware of the fact that they are interacting with DeFi, but in order to reach a truly mainstream audience there will be a transitionary period where perhaps these front ends do not lean too heavily into the crypto angle. This movement comes straight out of the playbook of new Fintech startups like [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) and [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) that have spent the past decade taking complex financial systems, reducing their complexity and making them accessible to retail investors. These startups often build on top of TradFi and reduce friction for retail users by bending the rules or by [bundling transactions together](https://www.freetrade.io). DeFi could use the same approach and reduce friction even further by abstracting away the complexities of the Ethereum blockchain and presenting a seamless solution to the end-user. It is unlikely that this simplified DeFi front end innovation will come from the existing Fintech incumbents because the way they are used to working is so different to the way DeFi works. TradFi Fintech startups are used to pushing up against and fighting the traditional systems to try and squeeze them into a user experience that is pleasant to use. The DeFi space is flexible by design so the approach taken by these verticalised DeFi gateways will be simple, and even encouraged by the protocols themselves, contrary to the struggles faced by TradFi Fintech startups where in this case the incumbent banks are constantly trying to play catch-up with the challenger Fintech startups . \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/619cb9ed-b108-46e9-af75-3b211568bb06.png?height=806&width=1825)\n\nWhile there will be many independent startups fulfilling this function and maybe even getting funded through the protocols' own grants DAOs, many of these usability improvements will also come from the protocols' own core teams, especially on the institutional side. Institutional TradFi, at least in the short term, tends to prefer interacting directly with the people that built the technology they are going to be leveraging. [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) has actually started experimenting with [permissioned pools for institutional investors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-lending-platform-aave-reveals-private-pool-for-institutions) because institutional investors previously found it tough to use the protocol due to lack of [KYC and AML](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc-aml-know-your-customer-vs-anti-money-laundering/) compliance, and this has allowed banks and other institutional clients using [AAVE](https://www.aave.com) to know that the other parties in the network are compliant and vetted not to be on an [OFAC sanctions list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). This is just another example of DeFi slightly adapting to TradFi without compromising on their core principles as an almost intermediate stage to mainstream adoption. Whether that be through making it feel like Fiat through stable-coins, or increasing KYC for institutions to help them to feel more at ease about the protocols they are transacting with, these measures all go a long way towards lowering hurdles to mass adoption. \n\nIt is also likely that whilst at this early stage the protocol teams themselves are working on the UI and UX as well as the underlying infrastructure, they may slowly start to shift their focus away from the consumer side and specialise more on the protocol itself. This would likely manifest itself in protocols keeping their existing UIs more as a reference with the aim of slowly phasing them out in the very long-term. Platforms like [Zapper](https://www.zapper.fi) and [Zerion](https://zerion.io/), which are focused almost exclusively on usability and accessibility, will then step in to focus on the front ends and leave the protocol teams free to optimise their platforms.\n\nThe runway is wide open, and the tech is ready. These protocols exist and are being built and tested by thousands of users every day. The best part is that anyone can come in and make them more useful to any specific demographic. Look no further than projects like [Ribbon](https://www.ribbon.finance) to see this in action. [Ribbon](htts://www.ribbon.finance) has made some sophisticated covered call strategies available to anyone with a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) by building directly on [Opyn's](https://www.opyn.co/) cash-settled ETH options protocol, all while making it feel as simple as an, admittedly high-risk, savings account to the end-user.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0ec888-d3db-4856-af1d-48280478715d.png?height=851&width=2325)\n\n## Undercolateralisation \n\nThe second hurdle is the issue of overcolateralisation in DeFi lending protocols. When you put the whole DeFi stack together, what you are left with is essentially a fully decentralised crypto bank that runs itself in the most traditional sense of the word. DeFi, just like a bank, allows you to convert between currencies, deposit money and receive interest in return for providing liquidity to the bank to then allow them to loan it back out. On the other side of the equation, anyone can then go to the bank, take out a loan and then pay it back at a rate most suited to their risk profile and time horizon. In TradFi some loans are unsecured, but many are secured in that they have some form of collateral backing the loan. If you fail to pay back said loan, the traditional bank has the legal authority to repossess that asset and liquidate it in exchange for cash. The percentage of the total loan required as collateral often depends on a credit score and past successful repayment of loans. Some traditional bank loans are overcollateralised when the asset is highly illiquid to make sure that enough cash can be recouped in the event of a loan default. Conversely in most DeFi lending protocols, you need to provide significantly more crypto as collateral than the stable-coins you are borrowing, sometimes as much as 700%.\n\nIt can be hard to understand why someone would ever want to take out a loan worth less than the amount they are putting down as collateral, and whilst there are some valid reasons for this such as delaying a taxable event or increasing leverage on positions through complex financial gymnastics, the vast majority of the world is **unwilling** or, more importantly, **unable** to borrow money in this way. \n\nThe main reason people borrow money is precisely because they do not have the spare capital available at that time. People take out mortgages to buy houses, or take out loans to start a small business in their hometown. Sometimes a mortgage may even start highly collateralised but later turn undercollateralised if the value of the house goes down, however due to the credit history of the borrower the loan is still able to remain a [_performing loan_](https://pocketsense.com/difference-between-performing-nonperforming-loans-12224160.html). The downside of undercollateralisation is of course that if the loan were to default, the collateral would not be able to cover the principal. In this case, the borrower would step in to cover the difference if they are in fact creditworthy and have some reputational skin in the game not to run off with the money with no consequence. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17b662fe-a9af-4b5c-afda-aeb07b88e131.png?height=845&width=2138)\n\nTo cater properly to these kinds of users it is important that DeFi eventually gets to a point where loans can be undercollateralised in some way. The difficulty is that DeFi is by its very nature anonymous and trustless, which means that the concept of social proof and credit scores becomes very difficult to handle and potentially even ideologically problematic. A potential solution could be a quasi-anonymous loan passport solution in which the user is anonymous on one dimension but not on another, i.e. their wallet address is public, but the owner of the wallet is not. One could, in theory, understand someone's creditworthiness through their DeFi loans history, which is of course publicly visible on Web3 or even decrease the user's collateral requirement for their next loan by a certain percentage every time they repay successfully. Another alternative is allowing user loans to be secured and guaranteed by other individuals they know in real life that trust the borrower enough to guarantee their loan and [delegate their credit](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation).\n\nPerhaps we could even see some CeFi institutions step in to perform credit checks on DeFi users on a per address basis. This solution would, of course, introduce some centralisation as it would involve real-identity based KYC, but may be a necessary interim solution for users that prioritise a low collateral ratio over absolute anonymity as lending protocols could eventually introduce pools of loans where a trusted third party has verified creditworthiness in advance. This CeFi verification could also be a [Zero Knowledge Proof](https://www.wired.com/story/zero-knowledge-proofs/), in that the verifying party would know that the borrower is creditworthy but would essentially allow the borrowers to prove their creditworthiness to another party without having to reveal their identity. When the borrower proves their creditworthiness with zero knowledge, they would display the fact that the CeFi institution has deemed them creditworthy as a boolean value in their wallet, perhaps as a non-transferrable NFT.\n\nThere are already some great projects being built in this space like [teller.finance](https://www.teller.finance/) which is taking a similar approach to the aforementioned CeFi integration by connecting to your bank account through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) and then offering risk-assessed DeFi loans on their platform without the need for collateral. Although we are still a while away from a foolproof creditworthiness checker solution in DeFi there are many different approaches one can take and I believe a combination of these approaches will play a large part in solving the issue of collateralisation in the quest for widespread adoption.\n\nAside from lending protocols, there is also a significant level of overcollateralisation across the whole DeFi universe which was initially there for the sake of simplicity including in options protocols. There has been some great research done into [improving the collateral efficiency of these protocols](https://medium.com/opyn/partially-collateralized-options-now-in-defi-b9d223eb3f4d) to allow for partial collateralisation without having to worry about creditworthiness through strategic liquidations with a \"shock buffer\" of a size large enough to withstand a Black Thursday event.\n\n## Understandability\n\nThe final hurdle that, depending on how you look at things could be the hardest or easiest of these to solve, is the difficulty around understandability and education. This hurdle may ultimately solve itself if the first two issues are solved and DeFi starts to resemble the way in which users are used to dealing with and thinking about finances. However, it is still important to acknowledge that for non-technical people, the DeFi space can be very opaque and consequently more difficult to trust.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/46fc773f-114b-42c0-b1db-eade3492e306.png?height=697&width=2015)\n\nFiat money and the way centralised traditional financial systems work is deeply ingrained in our culture and is a little easier to properly comprehend because many parts of the system rely on trust and simple written agreements which come together to form financial systems. Understanding the way these systems work in DeFi is a lot less straightforward. While in TradFi it is relatively straightforward to explain the basics of how a bank works, in that one can deposit money, and in return the bank lends that money out and pays interest for that privilege. There are very few parts of that process that are opaque because, ultimately, it just involves numbers moving from one spreadsheet to another.\n\nThe difference with DeFi is that you first have to feel comfortable with the concept of decentralisation, anonymity, trustless systems, distributed ledgers, and then you have to try and explain how all of this functions automatically through smart-contracts. There are many parts of DeFi that have to be hand-waved away and perhaps this could become a hindrance to trust. \n\nOne could also, of course, argue that many people implicitly trust the banking system because enough other trusted people do and not because they understand every part of the process. The same could eventually be true when enough knowledgeable people trust DeFi and understand a good enough percentage of the current information gaps. \n\nThere are some great resources out there like [Finematics](https://finematics.com/) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) doing amazing things in the education space and teaching newcomers about all things DeFi. This will be crucial in making sure people are comfortable enough with the technology to use it, especially when currently decentralisation slightly goes against the grain and users may be met with scepticism from friends and family. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/56920551-f6e6-47ad-b44d-493b815bc264.png?height=589&width=1262)\n\nIt should, however, be noted that the younger digital-native generation finds the concept of digital money extremely intuitive as they have grown up interacting with various in-game currencies, and the youngest among them have potentially never even used physical cash in their lives. This will undoubtedly make the proliferation of DeFi a more natural process as Gen-Z is starting to trust the digital world more than physical and may even start to learn about finance through DeFi in context rather than adapting antiquated financial concepts to fit the DeFi world as in the current status-quo.\n\n\n\nOverall the space is going in all the right directions. It will take a while for these ideas to materialise fully, but this is the part that interests me the most about the DeFi space. There is so much mind-blowing R&D going on every day, and people are experimenting, taking risks and breaking boundaries. I'm very passionate about making sure as many people as possible have access to these tools and can take part in the revolution.

He straightened himself and let a deep sigh float from his simulated lungs into the throng of fellow uploaded minds alongside him. Despite countless denials, he believed that this time, he would make it back to reality.\n\nThat’s what all of the uploaded minds in this endless line wanted. To move on from their infinite simulated lives. To anchor themselves again in a real city. One last life, truly lived. New challenges, unforgettable memories, and a chance to be alive again. However, the *Uploaded Minds and Human Coexistence Pact* determined the fates of uploaded minds like Alan. At the end of the line, before the gates to Anchor City, were the agents.\n\nAlongside a large stack of required documents, each uploaded mind had to have a reason to move on. For most of the minds, the answer was the same: they’ve become bored of all of their lives. To live a final life of limitations meant feeling human again for one last time. For many uploaded minds this was true, and that’s the reason that Alan’s lawyers recommended he present.\n\nBut, Alan had his own reason to move on towards the city that allowed him to have a real body again. An infinite amount of lives weren’t enough to shake a woman he once met on a promenade in Kinshasa. That distant evening, the city of Brazzaville on the opposite bank illuminated a simulated cloud that had just burst its numerous waters into the Congo River. Even now, the fresh smell of petrichor rising from the soaked earth would take him back to that night when she introduced herself. \n\n“Hi,” she said from a gentle smile. \n\nEnsuing discussions about soil and rain led them to an agreement to leave the rest of the uploaded minds in the public overworld simulation behind and disappear into their own instance: a common act where uploaded minds forked the simulation into less computationally intensive copies for their own, private use. It was the start of a budding relationship that grew over countless simulations until the long river of time washed them apart. She moved on.\n\nAfter another infinite lives since, Alan could no longer resist the pull of her gravity from where she used to be. She was the reason. However, afraid to get denied, he kept with his lawyer’s recommendations and used the same reason she also said goodbye with: “I want feel human again. To be real again.” Many made it through the line and into Anchor City, but many were also, unfortunately, frequently denied: Alan Bloom, included. He never knew why. Frustrating, like a pregnant cloud that would not release its life-giving rain.\n\nAs he practised the rehearsed reason in his head, the line shuffled forward like a wave, minds rippling down it from the agents up ahead to somewhere distant behind him.\n\nComing into view was Cappy’s Hotel. \n\nWith the line ever present and many millions undertaking it every day, it had formed its own city. Bars, hotels, police, housing authorities, and all the usual abundant bureaucracy you’d find in any metropolis. With many uploaded minds living an infinite amount of lives, it wasn’t that absurd that a city had grown from a queue.\n\n“Alan? Is that you? So nice to see you again! Staying for the night?” Cappy announced, shouting through his unkempt beard.\n\nAlan smiled at his old friend. “Of course. How could I not? A nice rest, defrag the old loose ends, and enjoy some amazing curries. How have you been, man? Still not moving on?”\n\nCappy stroked his beard in thought. *That was new. Was he going to join the line?* “Frankly Alan. If I see you one more time coming past here, I think I might follow you along,” Cappy said, throwing out a laugh and a slap onto Alan’s back. “Come! Take your papers to storage and then join us for a beer and some hot curry!”\n\nAlan dragged his papers to the back of the hotel and tugged on the storage locker. It didn’t budge. Not wanting to make a scene, he tugged a bit harder and then stopped before the handle might break. A hotel employee putting out some trash, spotted him and hurried over. One loud bang on the door later and it popped open. Alan nodded a thank you, avoiding the worker’s eyes and found a corner for his documents. Despite the warm glow from the hotel in the line behind him, butterflies were flapping about in his stomach. Forgetting a document meant you were denied without appeal. So, even though his papers were in order for the past hundred times he’s walked the line, Alan, paged through it all again.\n\n*Documentation of All Lives Lived.\nNegative Tests for Common Memetic Pathogens.\nProof-of-Updates to Core Logic Units.\nProof-of-Funds to Anchor.\nInitial Upload Certificates.*\n\n...\n\nSitting alone in the penumbra, paging through piles of papers, it reminded him of his pointless pre-upload life. Even though his past was hazy, he had not forgotten why he chose to exit and upload his mind. Infinite lives as a simulated mind was his opportunity to get rid of his social anxiety. It would allow him to not be so afraid. To not be that 40-something weirdo in the office without a family.\n\nIn time, it did help. Yet, like a river coursing over the earth and etching a canyon, the more he lived, the harder it became to change course. Alan became more Alan: a reserved man that truly felt free when he first uploaded, only to settle back in his ways. In his most free and flourishing lives, he spent it with her.\n\nAfter what felt like an hour, he came to what was supposed to be the penultimate document: *The Attestation*. If the agents discovered he lied or forged any documents, the attestation gave them the right to delist him from Anchor City, freeing up space for another mind. Real death. Except, the document wasn’t there. His eyes darted around the storage locker, only finding the neatly stored documents from the other patrons. Nothing! Alan hurriedly got up and retraced his steps right into Cappy’s bearded silhouette entering the locker.\n\n“You look like a feedback loop gone awry!” Cappy said through a slurred smile. “Your curry is getting cold, you nincompoop. Come!” Alan was still frozen, but Cappy grabbed his arm. \n\nAlan shrugged him away. “Wait. My attestation! I lost it.”\n\n“Alan, you’ve done this so many times now. It’s in there. Relax buddy,” Cappy said, tacking on a laugh. Alan still wasn’t sure, but Cappy was right. His curry was getting cold.\n\nFloating in thought through sounds of patrons clinking their glasses and sauces being slurped from bowls, Alan found their table already adorned with a few empty beers. As he took a bite of the now somewhat cold curry, he could feel Cappy’s eyes dissect his clouded mind.\n\n“Yo, mate, relax! The attestation is in there. Push comes to shove, you can always get back in the line!”\n\nDespite the cold curry, the chilli pushed simulated sweat to Alan’s forehead. That, or he was actually bristled by Cappy’s comment alongside his attestation anxiety. “Fuck that, Cappy. I’m done, man. I can’t come back here.” Alan straightened himself before he boiled over. “In fact, last time I checked, you’ve never even faced the line! So, rich coming from you!”\n\nCappy was unperturbed by Alan’s outburst, still nursing a beer and staring into the distance: perhaps even peering into the lines of code that made up their simulation. A deep breath rose in Cappy’s chest and he exhaled himself into an upright position. Despite not ageing, Alan could see the years on his face. They’ve done a lot together. From living an instance of becoming writers, to an instance of becoming cooks. Alan’s shoulders slouched. He felt bad. It was Cappy that first persuaded Alan to try and move on. It wasn’t due to some philosophical or existential reason. Cappy just became fed up with him endlessly talking about her.\n\n“Alan,” Cappy started, swallowing more than the sip of his beer. “You’re right…”\n\n“I'm sorry. Dude…”\n\n“No, you're right…” Cappy said with an escaping chuckle that turned into a sigh. “Can I level with you?”\n\nThat's a line Cappy never seemed to cross. Never got serious. A happy go lucky man, living each life like he was watching himself in a film: detached with a metaphorical box of popcorn by his side. Alan nodded. \n\n“I lied… I just can’t handle the rejection. You know me, man. Never afraid. Remember that time we took up base jumping? But. For some reason, I have this mental block when it comes to the line, and I think I know why.” Cappy looked up as Alan nodded back without judgement. Cappy continued, his eyes mapping out his reasons on the table amongst the empty beers. “It’s fucking stupid. My dad, you see. I was a chubby kid. He kept saying how fat I was, and so no matter how much I tried, I always feared that people would reject me for that. And somehow it feels like my father is one of the agents, and going to judge me for...”\n\n“No! Hey,” Alan interjected.\n\n“It’s so stupid. So many lives to unlearn it and… Listen, sorry,” Cappy said, pulling himself straight.\n\n“No. Look. It’s normal. We all share some of the scars of our pre-upload selves…”\n\nCappy slouched back into his beer. “I’m just so tired. I’m so bored. I can’t do this anymore. Life upon life, upon life. I’ve been everywhere. Even made it out of this simulated solar system. I’ve loved everyone. I’ve created so many things… Do you want to know the real reason I started this hotel in the line?”\n\nAlan always thought that Cappy just wanted something different. No doubt that Alan also felt that tinge of emptiness from all his own lives, but he hadn’t hit rock bottom yet: that deep abyss where some minds even spent lives just lying on their back, just to see what that would feel like.\n\n“I started this hotel, because I was in the line, ready to leave. To move on. To anchor. But, I couldn’t face the rejection. It’s so silly. So, I stopped. To help others instead.”\n\nNo doubt that Cappy’s helped many minds move on. Millions of them came through the hotel: some for the last time, and some, again and again. Like Alan.\n\n“You’ve helped many a wary mind in this line, Cappy. Cheers to that,” Alan said, lifting his beer. Cappy just drunkenly slapped Alan’s mug, mimicking a cheers.  “Thanks for sharing!”\n\n“It’s stupid. Whatever…” Cappy said, seemingly waving away his vulnerable self.\n\nAlan leaned into the moment to console his friend, changing the topic to what Cappy did best. “Want to help me?”\n\nCappy smiled. “What you got, brother?”\n\n“I trained as an actor. Helps me sell my reason. Wanna hear?”\n\n“Oh yeah? Go for it.”\n\nThis was Alan’s trump card that would get him to move on. He straightened himself and rested into a swagger and confidence that covered up his usual anxious self. He projected the words he had said so many times over: “I want to live a life with limitations. To anchor myself to the blockchain. To exist outside of all these infinite simulations. To be real. To live among the humans again. I am tired. I am bored. I want out of this prison of the mind.”\n\nRaptured by Alan’s new talent, the rest of the lounge fell silent for a moment.\n\n“Damn,” was all that Cappy could muster as the clientele resumed their clinking drinks and hearty meals. It was hard to tell if it was due to Cappy being sincerely flabbergasted or whether the alcohol was talking for him. “I’ve had many actors come past here, and that, I’m not lying, is fucking good.”\n\nRegardless, Alan’s heart warmed. He knew why. Maybe he could finally get to see her again.\n\nThe rest of evening was spent over more beers and stores about some strange lives that they’ve lived. When Alan retreated to bed, he gave himself permission again to wonder why she mattered so much. He’s lived countless lives with many people. *Why her?* He tried to recall his first life. The one before the upload. If Cappy’s fear came from his pre-upload life, maybe she mattered because of a memory he had once lost.\n\n*Pre-upload life.* Such a strange feeling and concept. A distant memory, much like the inability to place the source of a faint smell. And yet, to become anchored into a nanobody would be a final rebirth back to reality: anchored to the same hyperreal blockchain database that the humans use. Equals again in a way that a simulation could never be. The risk of death would be ever present, only hindered by accidents and the maintenance of the city that kept them running. No restart. That’s how the humans ordained it.\n\nLife would slow down, their simulated mental cycles reduced and limited by the pace of the chain itself. A reasonable trade-off. *Limited by the pace…* That’s where the memories of his first life sprouted again. She reminded him of the girl he grew up with on the farm next door. After all these lives, he never made the connection. As kids they roamed the farms between, playing at myriads of fantasies. On the cusp of becoming a teenager, with all its hormones and confusion, she left. Never to be seen again. Is that why he missed the woman he spent so many lives with as an uploaded mind? Both had the same messy, dark hair and slim face. And both moved on. \n\nNow, more than ever, he hoped they would let him give up this fake, simulated life. To be alive and walk through Anchor City, to find her. He let go and his head sank into the pillow with dreams of the promised city.\n\nTo humans, they wouldn’t notice Anchor City, unless they knew it existed. It was entirely white, the size of a bus and located in Antarctica. If you peered behind its unassuming veneer you’d see a mass of densely packed circuitry and cooling systems: the digital backbone that powered the uploaded minds. Once anchored, a mind gained a tiny body, fit to size for its computational power. Despite being limited by the pace of the chain, the newly anchored minds still ran 500x times faster than humans. Thus, in that white, bus-sized city were millions of minds creating an abundance of new, final memories and experiencing what it’s like again to live in the real world. \n\nAnchored minds were allowed to venture away from Anchor City, but they rarely did. Nowhere else on Earth was the bandwidth as fast and the computational power as dense. To venture away from Anchor City as a nanobot was the same as a human venturing into the vast nothingness of most of the universe. Moving on, however, didn't mean giving up on living. All the anchored minds just wanted to feel alive again. To feel like death was possible. Thus, even though it looked like snow, Anchor City had many layers of computation, augmented reality filters through immense streets, and stories of millions of lives. It was as if a human walked into a multi-layered city that combined a server farm with pieces of New York, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, Johannesburg, Lagos, Cairo, Mumbai, and Jakarta combined. Within all of that, she was there. Or, Alan hoped she was.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next morning he got up early, fetched his cart of documents, and joined the line for the final stretch. Cappy, somehow, not hungover said goodbye with a joke and nothing about his heart that he spilled over the beers the previous evening. “I hope I don’t see you again!” Old habits, even after infinite lives, die hard.\n\nAlan laughed and wanted to reply with a similar joke related to Cappy’s anxiety about rejection, but couldn’t find something to say.\n\nAs Alan got closer his palms started sweating. It never did. He watched as the minds in front of him went through the gauntlet. Denied. Denied. Accepted. Denied. Accepted. Accepted. Minds sent back to live many more lives, or minds given the opportunity to live one final one. To anchor back into the reality. *Should I do it?* A question that always faced him when he came close to the answer. But, this time, it was clear. His time had come. A deep anxious sigh left his body, rattling every simulated bone he had in himself.\n\n“Who are you?” Came the faceless agent behind the transparent window.\n\n“My pre-upload self was Alan Bloom. My simulated id is 0xbe6d59ff.”\n\n“What is your reason?”\n\nAlan straightened himself into the strut he had practiced for a lifetime. “I want to live a life with limitations. To anchor myself to the blockchain. To exist outside of all these infinite simulations. To be real. To live among the humans again. I am tired. I am bored. I want out of this prison of the mind.” Flawless, he felt.\n\nUnmoved by his magnum opus, the agent continued. *“Documentation of All Lives Lived.”*\n\n*Anti-climax…* Alan nodded and gave it to the agent.\n\n*“Negative Tests for Common Memetic Pathogens.”*\n\nThe laboratory reports were extensive, but it all passed the required checks. The documentation checking continued for a few hours until it came to the Attestation. Alan’s stomach lurched at the sight of the missing document. It usually rested neatly in between *“Signatures To Delist”* and the final document: *“Receipt of Payment To Pre-Pay Delisting Fee.”* His eyes widened, with bright dread rushing in. *No. No. Please. No.* It really was missing!\n\n“Alan Bloom, please present your *Attestation*.”\n\nHis world started turning, shock and heat coursing through his simulated veins. *I can’t. I really can’t…* His body took control, words bursting from the banks of his subconscious.\n“Please… Please! I can’t keep doing this,” Alan shouted, simulated spit splashing into the glass divider. His palms launched from his sides, trying to slam his desired reality into place. “I want to see her again. Please. I miss her! PLEASE!”\n\n“Guards,” the agent said, with the calmest voice that only caused Alan to lose control of his legs. He fell to the floor. As it dawned on him, he noticed the line fidgeting and pulsating, as if it were about to vomit out something it tried to keep down. As the guards drew closer, a few seconds later, the line belched up Cappy, holding Alan’s *Attestation.*\n\n“It… It was…” Cappy started, catching his breath. “It was outside the hotel!”\n\n“Holy shit. Cappy, get up,” Alan said, hoisting his friend up from the floor. He looked around at the guards, making sure they knew what was going on. Alan took the Attestation and presented it to the agent.\n\n*“Receipt of Payment To Pre-Pay Delisting Fee.”*\n\nAlan moved to hand over the last document and paused. The adrenaline had given him newfound clarity. “I need to revise my reason.”\n\n“What’s your reason?”\n\nAlan glanced at Cappy that was still catching his breath through his beard. His friend, spilling his guts over the beers at the hotel, held the true reason. They were the same. If Alan gave up all his simulated lives for one last one in Anchor City, he had no proof that she would still even be alive, or that she would even care about him. He never knew the real reason that made him want to move on. Until now. “I want to see her again. But. I also want to stop being afraid. By moving on I can also let go. I need to.”\n\nCappy’s eyes widened alongside a smile.\n\n“Reason revised. Please present your final document. *Receipt of Payment To Pre-Pay Delisting Fee.*”\n\nA blackhole of anxiety formed in Alan’s stomach. This was it.\n\nThe agent’s blank face rose up from his computer. “Thank you Alan Bloom. Given analysis of all the documents, your reason is legitimate. You are cleared to anchor.”\n\n...and suddenly, the black hole in his stomach became like the end of a wormhole, spewing out all the emotions he had collected over his many lifetimes. *Is that all it was? You had to merely speak your truth?*\n\n“Here’s your anchor certificate. Keep it safe. If you die, you will be delisted along with the certificate. Proceed to the transaction pool. A miner will anchor you.”\n\nAlan faced Cappy. Stunned, they launched into a deep hug, one that tried to come as close as possible to share what they were feeling. Cappy unwrapped, speechless.\n \nAlan reciprocated what Cappy had offered to so many before him. “I’ll have a room for you in the city. Please. When you are ready. Come! Just speak your truth!” \n\nCappy, still frozen, only eked out a nod.\n\nThe line didn’t wait. Alan was ushered along and slowly moved forward to the transaction pool. A miner took his anchor certificate, stamped it with some computational gas and turned towards Alan.\n\n“This is your final chance to turn back. From here on out, you will give up the opportunity to live a further infinite lives, in exchange for one final one in the real world. Do you want to proceed?”\n\nAll Alan could see was the visions of Anchor City, her face, and his final opportunity to let go. Tears streamed down as if all his infinite lives in all the simulations came to say goodbye. He had lived so much. He had seen so much. He took a deep breath and let the last tears fall where they belonged. Here, at the end of the line, in this infinite simulation.\n\n“I’m ready to anchor.” \n\n---\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nBid on the cover image by [@MadMaraca](https://twitter.com/MadMaraca). 100% of proceeds go to her:\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/25290)\n\nNFT memorabilia from this story in the form of Anchor Certificates were available for purchase from 28 June to 26 July!

Bars, hotels, police, housing authorities, and all the usual abundant bureaucracy you’d find in any metropolis. With many uploaded minds living an infinite amount of lives, it wasn’t that absurd that a city had grown from a queue.\n\n“Alan? Is that you? So nice to see you again! Staying for the night?” Cappy announced, shouting through his unkempt beard.\n\nAlan smiled at his old friend. “Of course. How could I not? A nice rest, defrag the old loose ends, and enjoy some amazing curries. How have you been, man? Still not moving on?”\n\nCappy stroked his beard in thought. *That was new. Was he going to join the line?* “Frankly Alan. If I see you one more time coming past here, I think I might follow you along,” Cappy said, throwing out a laugh and a slap onto Alan’s back. “Come! Take your papers to storage and then join us for a beer and some hot curry!”\n\nAlan dragged his papers to the back of the hotel and tugged on the storage locker. It didn’t budge. Not wanting to make a scene, he tugged a bit harder and then stopped before the handle might break. A hotel employee putting out some trash, spotted him and hurried over. One loud bang on the door later and it popped open. Alan nodded a thank you, avoiding the worker’s eyes and found a corner for his documents. Despite the warm glow from the hotel in the line behind him, butterflies were flapping about in his stomach. Forgetting a document meant you were denied without appeal. So, even though his papers were in order for the past hundred times he’s walked the line, Alan, paged through it all again.\n\n*Documentation of All Lives Lived.\nNegative Tests for Common Memetic Pathogens.\nProof-of-Updates to Core Logic Units.\nProof-of-Funds to Anchor.\nInitial Upload Certificates.*\n\n...\n\nSitting alone in the penumbra, paging through piles of papers, it reminded him of his pointless pre-upload life. Even though his past was hazy, he had not forgotten why he chose to exit and upload his mind. Infinite lives as a simulated mind was his opportunity to get rid of his social anxiety. It would allow him to not be so afraid. To not be that 40-something weirdo in the office without a family.\n\nIn time, it did help. Yet, like a river coursing over the earth and etching a canyon, the more he lived, the harder it became to change course. Alan became more Alan: a reserved man that truly felt free when he first uploaded, only to settle back in his ways. In his most free and flourishing lives, he spent it with her.\n\nAfter what felt like an hour, he came to what was supposed to be the penultimate document: *The Attestation*. If the agents discovered he lied or forged any documents, the attestation gave them the right to delist him from Anchor City, freeing up space for another mind. Real death. Except, the document wasn’t there. His eyes darted around the storage locker, only finding the neatly stored documents from the other patrons. Nothing! Alan hurriedly got up and retraced his steps right into Cappy’s bearded silhouette entering the locker.\n\n“You look like a feedback loop gone awry!” Cappy said through a slurred smile. “Your curry is getting cold, you nincompoop. Come!” Alan was still frozen, but Cappy grabbed his arm. \n\nAlan shrugged him away. “Wait. My attestation! I lost it.”\n\n“Alan, you’ve done this so many times now. It’s in there. Relax buddy,” Cappy said, tacking on a laugh. Alan still wasn’t sure, but Cappy was right. His curry was getting cold.\n\nFloating in thought through sounds of patrons clinking their glasses and sauces being slurped from bowls, Alan found their table already adorned with a few empty beers. As he took a bite of the now somewhat cold curry, he could feel Cappy’s eyes dissect his clouded mind.\n\n“Yo, mate, relax! The attestation is in there. Push comes to shove, you can always get back in the line!”\n\nDespite the cold curry, the chilli pushed simulated sweat to Alan’s forehead. That, or he was actually bristled by Cappy’s comment alongside his attestation anxiety. “Fuck that, Cappy. I’m done, man. I can’t come back here.” Alan straightened himself before he boiled over. “In fact, last time I checked, you’ve never even faced the line! So, rich coming from you!”\n\nCappy was unperturbed by Alan’s outburst, still nursing a beer and staring into the distance: perhaps even peering into the lines of code that made up their simulation. A deep breath rose in Cappy’s chest and he exhaled himself into an upright position. Despite not ageing, Alan could see the years on his face. They’ve done a lot together. From living an instance of becoming writers, to an instance of becoming cooks. Alan’s shoulders slouched. He felt bad. It was Cappy that first persuaded Alan to try and move on. It wasn’t due to some philosophical or existential reason. Cappy just became fed up with him endlessly talking about her.\n\n“Alan,” Cappy started, swallowing more than the sip of his beer. “You’re right…”\n\n“I'm sorry. Dude…”\n\n“No, you're right…” Cappy said with an escaping chuckle that turned into a sigh. “Can I level with you?”\n\nThat's a line Cappy never seemed to cross. Never got serious. A happy go lucky man, living each life like he was watching himself in a film: detached with a metaphorical box of popcorn by his side. Alan nodded. \n\n“I lied… I just can’t handle the rejection. You know me, man. Never afraid. Remember that time we took up base jumping? But. For some reason, I have this mental block when it comes to the line, and I think I know why.” Cappy looked up as Alan nodded back without judgement. Cappy continued, his eyes mapping out his reasons on the table amongst the empty beers. “It’s fucking stupid. My dad, you see. I was a chubby kid. He kept saying how fat I was, and so no matter how much I tried, I always feared that people would reject me for that. And somehow it feels like my father is one of the agents, and going to judge me for...”\n\n“No! Hey,” Alan interjected.\n\n“It’s so stupid. So many lives to unlearn it and… Listen, sorry,” Cappy said, pulling himself straight.\n\n“No. Look. It’s normal. We all share some of the scars of our pre-upload selves…”\n\nCappy slouched back into his beer. “I’m just so tired. I’m so bored. I can’t do this anymore. Life upon life, upon life. I’ve been everywhere. Even made it out of this simulated solar system. I’ve loved everyone. I’ve created so many things… Do you want to know the real reason I started this hotel in the line?”\n\nAlan always thought that Cappy just wanted something different. No doubt that Alan also felt that tinge of emptiness from all his own lives, but he hadn’t hit rock bottom yet: that deep abyss where some minds even spent lives just lying on their back, just to see what that would feel like.\n\n“I started this hotel, because I was in the line, ready to leave. To move on. To anchor. But, I couldn’t face the rejection. It’s so silly. So, I stopped. To help others instead.”\n\nNo doubt that Cappy’s helped many minds move on. Millions of them came through the hotel: some for the last time, and some, again and again. Like Alan.\n\n“You’ve helped many a wary mind in this line, Cappy. Cheers to that,” Alan said, lifting his beer. Cappy just drunkenly slapped Alan’s mug, mimicking a cheers.  “Thanks for sharing!”\n\n“It’s stupid. Whatever…” Cappy said, seemingly waving away his vulnerable self.\n\nAlan leaned into the moment to console his friend, changing the topic to what Cappy did best. “Want to help me?”\n\nCappy smiled. “What you got, brother?”\n\n“I trained as an actor. Helps me sell my reason. Wanna hear?”\n\n“Oh yeah? Go for it.”\n\nThis was Alan’s trump card that would get him to move on. He straightened himself and rested into a swagger and confidence that covered up his usual anxious self. He projected the words he had said so many times over: “I want to live a life with limitations. To anchor myself to the blockchain. To exist outside of all these infinite simulations. To be real. To live among the humans again. I am tired. I am bored. I want out of this prison of the mind.”\n\nRaptured by Alan’s new talent, the rest of the lounge fell silent for a moment.\n\n“Damn,” was all that Cappy could muster as the clientele resumed their clinking drinks and hearty meals. It was hard to tell if it was due to Cappy being sincerely flabbergasted or whether the alcohol was talking for him. “I’ve had many actors come past here, and that, I’m not lying, is fucking good.”\n\nRegardless, Alan’s heart warmed. He knew why. Maybe he could finally get to see her again.\n\nThe rest of evening was spent over more beers and stores about some strange lives that they’ve lived. When Alan retreated to bed, he gave himself permission again to wonder why she mattered so much. He’s lived countless lives with many people. *Why her?* He tried to recall his first life. The one before the upload. If Cappy’s fear came from his pre-upload life, maybe she mattered because of a memory he had once lost.\n\n*Pre-upload life.* Such a strange feeling and concept. A distant memory, much like the inability to place the source of a faint smell. And yet, to become anchored into a nanobody would be a final rebirth back to reality: anchored to the same hyperreal blockchain database that the humans use. Equals again in a way that a simulation could never be. The risk of death would be ever present, only hindered by accidents and the maintenance of the city that kept them running. No restart. That’s how the humans ordained it.\n\nLife would slow down, their simulated mental cycles reduced and limited by the pace of the chain itself. A reasonable trade-off. *Limited by the pace…* That’s where the memories of his first life sprouted again. She reminded him of the girl he grew up with on the farm next door. After all these lives, he never made the connection. As kids they roamed the farms between, playing at myriads of fantasies. On the cusp of becoming a teenager, with all its hormones and confusion, she left. Never to be seen again. Is that why he missed the woman he spent so many lives with as an uploaded mind? Both had the same messy, dark hair and slim face. And both moved on. \n\nNow, more than ever, he hoped they would let him give up this fake, simulated life. To be alive and walk through Anchor City, to find her. He let go and his head sank into the pillow with dreams of the promised city.\n\nTo humans, they wouldn’t notice Anchor City, unless they knew it existed. It was entirely white, the size of a bus and located in Antarctica. If you peered behind its unassuming veneer you’d see a mass of densely packed circuitry and cooling systems: the digital backbone that powered the uploaded minds. Once anchored, a mind gained a tiny body, fit to size for its computational power. Despite being limited by the pace of the chain, the newly anchored minds still ran 500x times faster than humans. Thus, in that white, bus-sized city were millions of minds creating an abundance of new, final memories and experiencing what it’s like again to live in the real world. \n\nAnchored minds were allowed to venture away from Anchor City, but they rarely did. Nowhere else on Earth was the bandwidth as fast and the computational power as dense. To venture away from Anchor City as a nanobot was the same as a human venturing into the vast nothingness of most of the universe. Moving on, however, didn't mean giving up on living. All the anchored minds just wanted to feel alive again. To feel like death was possible. Thus, even though it looked like snow, Anchor City had many layers of computation, augmented reality filters through immense streets, and stories of millions of lives. It was as if a human walked into a multi-layered city that combined a server farm with pieces of New York, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, Johannesburg, Lagos, Cairo, Mumbai, and Jakarta combined. Within all of that, she was there. Or, Alan hoped she was.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next morning he got up early, fetched his cart of documents, and joined the line for the final stretch. Cappy, somehow, not hungover said goodbye with a joke and nothing about his heart that he spilled over the beers the previous evening. “I hope I don’t see you again!” Old habits, even after infinite lives, die hard.\n\nAlan laughed and wanted to reply with a similar joke related to Cappy’s anxiety about rejection, but couldn’t find something to say.\n\nAs Alan got closer his palms started sweating. It never did. He watched as the minds in front of him went through the gauntlet. Denied. Denied. Accepted. Denied. Accepted. Accepted. Minds sent back to live many more lives, or minds given the opportunity to live one final one. To anchor back into the reality. *Should I do it?* A question that always faced him when he came close to the answer. But, this time, it was clear. His time had come. A deep anxious sigh left his body, rattling every simulated bone he had in himself.\n\n“Who are you?” Came the faceless agent behind the transparent window.\n\n“My pre-upload self was Alan Bloom. My simulated id is 0xbe6d59ff.”\n\n“What is your reason?”\n\nAlan straightened himself into the strut he had practiced for a lifetime. “I want to live a life with limitations. To anchor myself to the blockchain. To exist outside of all these infinite simulations. To be real. To live among the humans again. I am tired. I am bored. I want out of this prison of the mind.” Flawless, he felt.\n\nUnmoved by his magnum opus, the agent continued. *“Documentation of All Lives Lived.”*\n\n*Anti-climax…* Alan nodded and gave it to the agent.\n\n*“Negative Tests for Common Memetic Pathogens.”*\n\nThe laboratory reports were extensive, but it all passed the required checks. The documentation checking continued for a few hours until it came to the Attestation. Alan’s stomach lurched at the sight of the missing document. It usually rested neatly in between *“Signatures To Delist”* and the final document: *“Receipt of Payment To Pre-Pay Delisting Fee.”* His eyes widened, with bright dread rushing in. *No. No. Please. No.* It really was missing!\n\n“Alan Bloom, please present your *Attestation*.”\n\nHis world started turning, shock and heat coursing through his simulated veins. *I can’t. I really can’t…* His body took control, words bursting from the banks of his subconscious.\n“Please… Please! I can’t keep doing this,” Alan shouted, simulated spit splashing into the glass divider. His palms launched from his sides, trying to slam his desired reality into place. “I want to see her again. Please. I miss her! PLEASE!”\n\n“Guards,” the agent said, with the calmest voice that only caused Alan to lose control of his legs. He fell to the floor. As it dawned on him, he noticed the line fidgeting and pulsating, as if it were about to vomit out something it tried to keep down. As the guards drew closer, a few seconds later, the line belched up Cappy, holding Alan’s *Attestation.*\n\n“It… It was…” Cappy started, catching his breath. “It was outside the hotel!”\n\n“Holy shit. Cappy, get up,” Alan said, hoisting his friend up from the floor. He looked around at the guards, making sure they knew what was going on. Alan took the Attestation and presented it to the agent.\n\n*“Receipt of Payment To Pre-Pay Delisting Fee.”*\n\nAlan moved to hand over the last document and paused. The adrenaline had given him newfound clarity. “I need to revise my reason.”\n\n“What’s your reason?”\n\nAlan glanced at Cappy that was still catching his breath through his beard. His friend, spilling his guts over the beers at the hotel, held the true reason. They were the same. If Alan gave up all his simulated lives for one last one in Anchor City, he had no proof that she would still even be alive, or that she would even care about him. He never knew the real reason that made him want to move on. Until now. “I want to see her again. But. I also want to stop being afraid. By moving on I can also let go. I need to.”\n\nCappy’s eyes widened alongside a smile.\n\n“Reason revised. Please present your final document. *Receipt of Payment To Pre-Pay Delisting Fee.*”\n\nA blackhole of anxiety formed in Alan’s stomach. This was it.\n\nThe agent’s blank face rose up from his computer. “Thank you Alan Bloom. Given analysis of all the documents, your reason is legitimate. You are cleared to anchor.”\n\n...and suddenly, the black hole in his stomach became like the end of a wormhole, spewing out all the emotions he had collected over his many lifetimes. *Is that all it was? You had to merely speak your truth?*\n\n“Here’s your anchor certificate. Keep it safe. If you die, you will be delisted along with the certificate. Proceed to the transaction pool. A miner will anchor you.”\n\nAlan faced Cappy. Stunned, they launched into a deep hug, one that tried to come as close as possible to share what they were feeling. Cappy unwrapped, speechless.\n \nAlan reciprocated what Cappy had offered to so many before him. “I’ll have a room for you in the city. Please. When you are ready. Come! Just speak your truth!” \n\nCappy, still frozen, only eked out a nod.\n\nThe line didn’t wait. Alan was ushered along and slowly moved forward to the transaction pool. A miner took his anchor certificate, stamped it with some computational gas and turned towards Alan.\n\n“This is your final chance to turn back. From here on out, you will give up the opportunity to live a further infinite lives, in exchange for one final one in the real world. Do you want to proceed?”\n\nAll Alan could see was the visions of Anchor City, her face, and his final opportunity to let go. Tears streamed down as if all his infinite lives in all the simulations came to say goodbye. He had lived so much. He had seen so much. He took a deep breath and let the last tears fall where they belonged. Here, at the end of the line, in this infinite simulation.\n\n“I’m ready to anchor.” \n\n---\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nBid on the cover image by [@MadMaraca](https://twitter.com/MadMaraca). 100% of proceeds go to her:\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/25290)\n\nNFT memorabilia from this story in the form of Anchor Certificates were available for purchase from 28 June to 26 July!

{"id": "vt1phzmscf4NnEk4KTlb5mCaGqopZRg4PhLcl0CY1_E", "title": "Token-gated physical spaces (an experimental recipe)\n", "body": "As part of Seed Club’s Season 2 cohort, there are a range of compelling projects exploring the frontiers of social token application. There is Jump (a community of b2b advertising agency leaders), Global Coin Research (a tokenized media organization), and more. \n\nI participated in Seed Club as part of the [Ampled](www.ampled.com) team. We’re a web platform for direct support of musicians, formed as an artist and worker-owned cooperative. Within the accelerator, we have been exploring the implementation of community tokens, as a coordination layer within an existing democratic cooperative. \n\nSome of the questions we have been exploring include:\n\n**Earning:** How does someone earn community tokens?\n\n- Are bounties created to incentivize community engagement?\n- Which work/ tasks should be rewarded?\n\n**Redeeming:** Once you have community tokens, what can you do with them? \n\n- Can we use native community tokens as a currency within auctions for music gear? \n- Can we give merch discounts to token holders?\n- Can they be used across other platforms? (Like bidding on 1/1 releases on [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/))\n\n**Accessing:** What do token holders get special access to?\n\n- Do members get access to finances and private channels?\n- Could members unlock a physical shared space?\n\n## Killer access app: token gated physical space\n\nThe idea of token-gated physical space isn’t new. It seems like it has been a long-running point of discussion around the potential power of token utility. And now, there has been increasing usage and discussion around NFTs as tickets, and protocols like Unlock creating tools to give NFTs utility across a suite of integrations. Recently, the Friends with Benefits community held a party, in which only people who had 60 $FWB tokens could enter. It’s one of the most clear examples of how tokens can not only gate access (literally), but also how valuable the shared in-person social component to tokenized communities can be.\n\nAmpled workers, since the beginning of the project, have talked about the idea of having a shared physical workspace/ home base. We’d love to create a space, likely in NYC, that any Ampled members have access to. It could be an office with space to work or socialize, or it could be an event space or shared music rehearsal space. The thought is, if you are a co-owner of the cooperative, any space that belonged to Ampled would belong to you. It helps reinforce the meaning of ownership and cooperativism in a very intuitive way. \n\nRecently, with support from Unlock Protocol, we are beginning to pursue this idea -- and create a space in Brooklyn, NY that all members can have access to. And, we are planning a pilot that will give current members tokens that will allow access to the space.\n\nThe idea is to demonstrate an exciting way to bridge membership from digital spaces to physical spaces.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/06a76ee7-44a3-4de4-a576-4b9249c2a304.jpg?height=428&width=642)\n\n*The Patch House was an early inspiration for this idea. It was a brand-sponsored space where bands could stay in Brooklyn for free while on tour.*\n\n## Creating a working token-gated smart lock\n\nThe goal of this experiment was to create an MVP, no-code version of a token-gated smart lock. I ended up created a relatively simple way of using Unlock to grant access to a physical space using an NFT created through Unlock Protocol. Here’s how it works.\n\n1. Member purchases NFT lock using Unlock. (but this could work with any NFT or social token)\n2. Token(s) grants access to a private Discord channel via Collab.Land\n3. The private members-only Discord channel has a bot that sends a new 4 digit PIN code each day.\n4. The codes, which are preprogrammed and also scheduled as temporary codes to work with a smart lock, can be used to open the door on that day.\n\nIt’s a very hacky and simple solution. Basically, the codes are already preprogrammed and scheduled to work with a smart lock, and the bot within the token-gated Discord channel just reveals each morning which code will open the lock that day (by querying an airtable database).\n\n## Hardware\n\nFor this proof of concept, I used this Schlage Encode smart lock. The reason why I chose this lock is that its native mobile app allows for the ability to create scheduled temporary keypad codes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/83c39005-5402-4125-b043-d4006573b34a.jpg?height=2232&width=1340)\n\n\n\n## Software\n\nIn order to make this idea work, I used several no-code software tools. \n\n- Collab.Land (for token gating the Discord channel)\n- Airtable (as a database for storing the preprogrammed locks)\n- Airtable Automation (query database and send an email with associated code to Zapier if day = today)\n- Zapier (to parse email and send code to Discord)\n- Discord & Discord webhooks (to accept and display the code)\n\nTo be clear, this system has several imperfections, and I am by no means a no-code automation expert. However, I have tested this out with the smart lock and it does work (even if the end-to-end system could be dramatically more efficient and optimized). Potential improvements aside, it works! This is one way to create a token-gated physical space.\n\nThere are many possible applications of token-gated physical spaces. This could include:\n- Coworking spaces\n- Libraries of things (example: [Library of Things](https://www.libraryofthings.co.uk/) & [Synth Library NYC](https://www.synthlibrarynyc.org/) )\n- Social clubs\n- Speakeasies\n- Meeting space\n- Private bar or restaurant\n- Shared practice/ rehearsal space\n\nTo view the full post and more details on how this was created, including links to some of the automation recipes used, click here to read on [Unlock Protocol’s Discourse forum](https://unlock.community/t/unlock-experiments-token-gated-physical-space/96).\n", "timestamp": 1627332921, "digest": "Iutxpw3iidtxPs1drAq3pkb0Kn5MU_KLri0r0nNCsNA", "contributor": "0xa4142A998EeD156228b2F925a43fcEA25f363Cc5"}

{"id": "TO6yPnhWDw90uOzEUN5qSJ391P-RZaoccA62XwsrVBM", "title": "Tutorial: How to Signal on The Graph", "body": "## What is The Graph?\nThe Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains. If you are building an application that accesses data from the blockchain, it might take a long time to look through each block on the blockchain and extract relevant data. To solve this issue, you could build your own service to index data and store it in a conventional database. But this takes time and money. \n\nHere’s where The Graph comes in. By allowing multiple types of network participants with specific roles, The Graph enables developers to build applications that can access blockchain data in a decentralized way without sacrificing performance. This \n\nLet’s look at the participants in The Graph ecosystem.\n**Indexers**: They stake GRT tokens and operate a Graph Node to index relevant data and process queries. They earn Indexing Rewards and Query Fees. Indexers are incentivized to serve correct data as their staked tokens will be slashed if they act maliciously. \n**Delegators**: Delegators stake their GRT tokens on behalf of one or more Indexers. As a result, Delegators earn a portion of the Indexer rewards and Query fees without running their own Graph Node.\n**Consumers**: These are the application developers that access data and pay for queries.\n\nHow do Indexers identify data that is relevant and store it in a suitable format? Here is where the next participant comes in. \n\n**Curators**\nCurators identify subgraphs that are important and of high quality by using their GRT tokens to signal to Indexers, who then proceed to index data and process queries. Curators also earn a portion of the query fees, which incentivizes them to curate data sources that are of high quality. \n\n## Risks of being a Curator\n### Bonding Curve Risks\nWhen you use GRT tokens to signal on a subgraph, you deposit GRT in return for Curation Shares minted on a Bonding Curve. The Bonding Curve defines the relationship between the price of Curation Shares and its supply. This means that each additional Curation Share costs more than the last one. \nBonding Curves are volatile, and there is a possibility that you might receive less GRT than when you started.\n\n### Subgraph Assessment\nIf you falsely assess the quality of a subgraph and signal on a subgraph that may not receive many queries, you may risk earning very little or no query fees at all.\n\n## Costs of Being a Curator\n\n- GRT Tokens\n- ETH for Gas Fees\n- A 2.5% Curation Fee charged by the protocol.\n\n\n## How to Curate a Subgraph on the Graph?\n- Purchase GRT Tokens on [Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0xc944e90c64b2c07662a292be6244bdf05cda44a7) or an exchange of your choice. \n- Head over to the [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer) and choose a Subgraph that you’d like to Signal on. For this example, I will select the ENS Protocol Subgraph to walk you through the steps. Feel free to choose one that you find interesting!\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6aac03c5-ea95-4cad-ae57-aaa7d65f998e.png?height=1510&width=2854)\n\n- Connect your Wallet by clicking on the top right. Once connected, click on the Signal button, and you’ll be greeted with this. \n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8f2ef198-2f35-42bf-9396-01f253ef9ac0.png?height=1516&width=660)\n\n- You can see the price per Curation Share denominated in GRT.
