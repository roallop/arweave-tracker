{"id": "bs-kwj7sn57lA9pc9ZEaanjrQfjbKL1cF0eLNv0bEFQ", "title": "Implementing Pain Tracing Blockchain into Organizations", "body": "# I. Can We be Good without a Definition of Good?\n\nMany people in society may have good intentions. Yet, protests as an outpouring of goodwill, such as demonstrations and signature drives, are not always fruitful.\n\nNevertheless, some believe that the protest itself is meaningful and the movement can change the reality by causing the politicians to care about it. But demanding the mental strength to continue activities without feedback, aiming at too distant goals and indirect realizations, is hard. It would be difficult to guarantee that the activities do not degenerate into a protest for protest’s sake.\n\nIt is hard for sporadic good intentions to produce results unless they are connected in some way. Although, there are histories of further tragedies (Nazism, massacres in the Soviet Union, etc.) in “revolutionary movements = organizational renewal” that centralize movements from the top.\n\nBesides national and social organizations, we also belong to companies and local communities. The same problem of difficulty in reforming such familiar organizations also exists, though on a different scale. The first question is, what is the ideal state of an organization? Revolutionary movements in the past have been disastrous by defining dreams and hopes that are inherently unwritable as “ideals” and then ostracizing those who do not follow them in internal struggles or accusing anyone who refuses to bow to its favored interpretation as “reactionary.”\n\n*The problem is that we can only have a vague idea of what is “good.”* It is difficult to define what is “good” for the community affirmatively, and when we write it down, it tends to become a skeleton. *So, instead of seeking to gain something positive, what if we thought of reducing the negative?* We want to consider “non-positive ideals (minimal ideals)” in a way that is different from a mere “ denial,” in which the boundary is gradually limited from the outside by stating “this is wrong” each time.\n\nThis article will define a condition that an organization should satisfy as “minimal ideals” and present **the idea of “pain tokens” for a concrete mechanism toward its feasibility**.\n\n# II. A Minimum Ideal for Organization, PS3\n\nLet us assume the following four conditions as minimum ideals for the desirable state of organizations.\n\n**1: Sustainability: Efficient enough to be competitive with all existing organizational forms.**\n\nEven if an organization provides a \"dream work environment\" for its members (e.g., workers), its output will not be competitive if it is too inefficient or unproductive. The organization will eventually force itself into dissolution. The comparison for efficiency is with existing organizations that are producing the same product.\n\n**2: Pain minimization: Reduce the total amount of stakeholders suffering as much as possible.**\n\nSuppose an excellent efficiency is obtained. Nevertheless, if that efficiency is redeemed by the intense suffering of the organization’s community, then the organization is undesirable.\n\nThe reason for minimizing suffering and not maximizing total happiness (utility) is that in an organization with huge inequalities, even if suffering occurs, the total can be increased by some members corresponding to the “utility monster,” or only the utility of investors can be enhanced. In the past, many revolutionary activities have ignored this condition. Therefore, they forced “sacrifice for the organization (revolution).”\n\n**3: Scalability: Even if the number of members increases, other conditions can continue to be met.**\n\nIt is common that a venture company with a good atmosphere starting with a small group, becomes a mere bureaucratic organization after it becomes a giant. However, since individual members' intelligence and cognitive abilities are limited, there is no way to avoid organizational growth, division of labor, and division of authority. Existing organizations often solve this problem by hierarchization.\n\nThere may be other ways, but none have been discovered yet. Also, simply decentralizing the organization will not solve the problem of cognitive ability. However, it is not clear to what extent managers and upper-level members of the hierarchy need to be rewarded with higher rewards. Hence, changing this condition may be possible.\n\n**4: Security: Less likely to be destroyed by malicious attackers**\n\nConsider a society where there are only good people. Suppose an organization is created that happens to meet all the requirements. However, if a single selfish intruder destroys it, the organizational structure is too unstable to be adopted.\n\nOur history provides many examples of “revolutions” that temporarily create a “good system” and then break it all at once. So, not trusting all people? That will not work either. Ideally, an organization should be able to reduce the cost of security as much as possible. Of course, there is no way to know how to do this.\n\nWe call these “ideals” the **PS3 condition (Pain, Scalability, Sustainability, Security)** for ease of remembering. PS3 is incompatible with, for example, the position that “society values only the concentration of resources on talent and its creativity.\n\nSo it is not the ideals for everyone. However, PS3 defines the ideal of an organization only through the properties of the organization itself. In this sense, it is a “minimalist” ideal. It is possible to plugin such ideals as “freedom and equality (of members)” into PS3, but it is necessary to examine whether attached one will not destroy PS3. In this sense, PS3 is more like a “condition” than a normal “ideal.”\n\n# III: Empathy and Concern for Others in the PS3\n\nAs previously written, in the articles that follow, the conditions of pain minimization, security, scalability, and sustainability are referred to as “PS3” (Pain, Security, Scalability, Sustainability) and are assumed to be the basic requirements of governance (the minimal ideal).\n\nPS3 is a negative goal. It is a restraint against bad organizational conditions such as bullshit jobs and does not positively depict an ideal state.\n\nIn addition, PS3 does not treat attributes that are unconditionally good, such as diversity of members, as positive in and of themselves.\n\nFor example, if “lack of diversity leads to failure to learn and over-adaptation to the environment, resulting in the organization losing its ability to cope with reality and becoming unsustainable (a violation of Sustainability) or causing increased suffering (a violation of Pain),” then we say, “That is not good.”\n\nPS3 is similar to, but different from, a situation where the only thought is “follow the rules, and the rest is up to the individual. How is it different?\n\nFor one thing, empathy and concern for others, in a paraphrased form, are included in every item.\n\n* **Pain** minimization, as emotional or sensory empathy\n* **Security**, as concern for others with unfathomable intentions\n* **Scalability**, as the inability of institutions to be destroyed by being buried in the crowd of others\n* **Sustainability**, as the ability to continue to survive with others who have conflicting goals and beliefs\n\nAnd so on.\n\nPS3 is a working hypothesis postulated in thinking about the systematic possibilities of (autonomous) decentralized organizations made feasible by blockchain technology. In other words, it was hypothesized as a condition for thinking about “a way to keep the organization self-renewing without ideals or orders” in the search for the potential of a decentralized organization that does not exist in conventional centralized organizations bound from above by ideals, goals, and investments.\n\nMinimizing suffering is useless if there is no way to track and evaluate it, and if that trust is maintained by entrusting it to a particular power, we are ultimately back to a situation where there is no higher level of the state centralization. It is very tough to convince humankind, which has gone through totalitarianism and realism, that the state is not dishonest only in tracking suffering.\n\nHowever, now, with the blockchain, we can concretely imagine a way to technologically combine “traceability” (to suffering) with “decentralized trust” (without relying on centralized organizations and authorities). That is the pain token.\n\n# IV: What is Pain Token?\n\nPhilosopher Hannah Arendt called for a certain kind of courage, the kind of judgment that requires individuals to risk their lives to defy orders and maintain justice for humanity.\n\nCourage is probably necessary. However, governance that relies too much on individual courage is not sustainable. The number of people with courage is small and unlikely to increase.\n\nWe can now create a mechanism (which was impossible in the past) to objectively tell people that we do not like something without courage.\n\nAsaki Nishikawa, a member of VECTION, has proposed a simple system called “Pain Tokens”. It is a hypothetical right that assumes the following context.\n\n* It is easier to reach an agreement on pain than on happiness\n* Avoid believing that a cause (idea) or someone’s happiness naturally involves suffering\n* Make latent and invisible pain visible\n* Organizational failure can appear as a signal of pain, through which the organizational structure can change\n\nPain Tokens take the form of tokens (a unit of entitlement, like virtual currency) that are used in the network and operate according to the following rules:\n\n1. Pain Tokens are distributed to the organization’s members in fixed amounts over a fixed period of time\n2. Non-transferable\n3. Members decide how much to exercise each period\n4. Exercising is done anonymously\n5. The organization is obligated to attach to its output a traceable amount of Pain Tokens exercised in producing them\n\nPain Tokens are recorded in a public blockchain, and therefore cannot be tampered with, and are an anonymous, decentralized, change request authority for the organization.\n\nPain Tokens do not require any evaluation of the specific proposal. Moreover, it is unique in that it can anonymously express the fact that “pain” is occurring without knowing who is causing it or why it is painful.\n\nSo, how does an organization respond to the exercise of the Pain Token? For example, the following assumptions are possible.\n\nThe exercise of the Pain Token changes the organizational structure (the contribution of each member, authority, command, and the way resources to route).\n\nThe size and shape of the change are determined by a separately defined algorithm (without human intervention to prevent as much discretion as possible), taking into account the total amount of Pain Tokens exercised, the classified information of the exercised member groups, and the current organizational structure.\n\nPain Tokens are just a rudimentary example of a mechanism for tracing the pain signals of organizational members inside and outside the organization. However, if a similar mechanism can work successfully, it should be able to give a little more concrete substance to actions such as “Do not purchase products that are not fair.”\n\n# V: Changing the Organization through Pain Tokens (DAO + Pain Tokens)\n\nFor example, if a decentralized organization such as the DAO adopts pain tokens, we can consider the following changes in the automated organizational structure without the intervention of human will (politics).\n\n![Changing the organization through pain tokens](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pWDu35dxCn4_hwYtvpRi0.png?height=586&width=1024&&&&size=medium)\n\nN: A completely flat and decentralized network-like organization, tentatively assumed.\n\nT=N(T): tree-like routing structure (= organization) formed by the environment and learning up to a certain point.\n\nN(T) is a network that represents the same structure as T.\n\nT´=N(T´): Another tree structure newly re-routed by feeding back the results of exercising the pain token.\n\nN(T´) is a network that represents the same structure as T´.\n\nN´: An organization with multiple inherent tree-like support structures as dynamic routing structures that can quickly switch to N(T) and N(T´).\n\na: The network N becomes a tree T according to the current task and situation. The necessity to make it a tree is because trees are effective in many cases in terms of division of work and speed of execution. However, the problem is that once the tree is in place, rigidity, concession, discretion, and control become a problem.\n\nb: Use blockchain to trace the pain tokens fired as environmental maladaptation signals of T. This signal should use a public blockchain to ensure objectivity from intra-organizational politics. An automatic process that accounts for the pain token tracing will transform the tree T into T´. Then, run an algorithm to reflect the signals of these pain tokens to the organizational structure and routing in a human-free manner.\n\nSince it uses a public blockchain, the trace results are externally referable. The total amount of pain tokens that the organization has produced through its activities will appear like gas emissions. In this way, we will attempt to counteract the opacity of governance in dishonest companies and the like. If the organization does not disclose the tracing results, it will have to face the question from the public as to why it does not.\n\nThe members themselves are the ones who operate the pain tokens, and since they are anonymous and the blockchain ensures objectivity, fraud in the information input part is highly preventable. Instead, the problem seems to be the politics of how the pain tokens reflect the organizational structure and the update algorithm. We plan to discuss this separately at some point.\n\nc: Depending on the state of the environment, reconfigure the organizational structure as actions referring to past learning results. In the figure, N(T) and N(T´) appear simultaneously, but there can be many tree structures, and it is sometimes impossible to separate them clearly.\n\nIn this situation, heterogeneous tree structures live together in the organization, so relationships such as “boss-staff” reverse depending on the condition. If keeping such a dynamic structure has a higher adaptability and learning ability to the environment than a fixed tree-like organization, such an organization will have a robust competitive advantage. Since pain is subjective, it may be reduced by a free lunch (= consuming no physical resource), so to speak, independent of physical and statistical conservation, and therein lies the hope.\n\n# VI: From “Subject / Responsible” to “Pain Token / Distributed Change”\n\nThe use of AI and routing algorithms, described to illustrate the idea of pain tokens, is very conceptual, and realistically, it raises a variety of issues, especially around AI specification changes, such as lack of data, the impossibility of replication, unclear tasks, how to define rewards, and learning failures.\n\nConsidering these factors, routing change rules can be done mechanically, without the aid of machine learning, with straightforward rules whose meaning is obvious to everyone.

Although, there are histories of further tragedies (Nazism, massacres in the Soviet Union, etc.) in “revolutionary movements = organizational renewal” that centralize movements from the top.\n\nBesides national and social organizations, we also belong to companies and local communities. The same problem of difficulty in reforming such familiar organizations also exists, though on a different scale. The first question is, what is the ideal state of an organization? Revolutionary movements in the past have been disastrous by defining dreams and hopes that are inherently unwritable as “ideals” and then ostracizing those who do not follow them in internal struggles or accusing anyone who refuses to bow to its favored interpretation as “reactionary.”\n\n*The problem is that we can only have a vague idea of what is “good.”* It is difficult to define what is “good” for the community affirmatively, and when we write it down, it tends to become a skeleton. *So, instead of seeking to gain something positive, what if we thought of reducing the negative?* We want to consider “non-positive ideals (minimal ideals)” in a way that is different from a mere “ denial,” in which the boundary is gradually limited from the outside by stating “this is wrong” each time.\n\nThis article will define a condition that an organization should satisfy as “minimal ideals” and present **the idea of “pain tokens” for a concrete mechanism toward its feasibility**.\n\n# II. A Minimum Ideal for Organization, PS3\n\nLet us assume the following four conditions as minimum ideals for the desirable state of organizations.\n\n**1: Sustainability: Efficient enough to be competitive with all existing organizational forms.**\n\nEven if an organization provides a \"dream work environment\" for its members (e.g., workers), its output will not be competitive if it is too inefficient or unproductive. The organization will eventually force itself into dissolution. The comparison for efficiency is with existing organizations that are producing the same product.\n\n**2: Pain minimization: Reduce the total amount of stakeholders suffering as much as possible.**\n\nSuppose an excellent efficiency is obtained. Nevertheless, if that efficiency is redeemed by the intense suffering of the organization’s community, then the organization is undesirable.\n\nThe reason for minimizing suffering and not maximizing total happiness (utility) is that in an organization with huge inequalities, even if suffering occurs, the total can be increased by some members corresponding to the “utility monster,” or only the utility of investors can be enhanced. In the past, many revolutionary activities have ignored this condition. Therefore, they forced “sacrifice for the organization (revolution).”\n\n**3: Scalability: Even if the number of members increases, other conditions can continue to be met.**\n\nIt is common that a venture company with a good atmosphere starting with a small group, becomes a mere bureaucratic organization after it becomes a giant. However, since individual members' intelligence and cognitive abilities are limited, there is no way to avoid organizational growth, division of labor, and division of authority. Existing organizations often solve this problem by hierarchization.\n\nThere may be other ways, but none have been discovered yet. Also, simply decentralizing the organization will not solve the problem of cognitive ability. However, it is not clear to what extent managers and upper-level members of the hierarchy need to be rewarded with higher rewards. Hence, changing this condition may be possible.\n\n**4: Security: Less likely to be destroyed by malicious attackers**\n\nConsider a society where there are only good people. Suppose an organization is created that happens to meet all the requirements. However, if a single selfish intruder destroys it, the organizational structure is too unstable to be adopted.\n\nOur history provides many examples of “revolutions” that temporarily create a “good system” and then break it all at once. So, not trusting all people? That will not work either. Ideally, an organization should be able to reduce the cost of security as much as possible. Of course, there is no way to know how to do this.\n\nWe call these “ideals” the **PS3 condition (Pain, Scalability, Sustainability, Security)** for ease of remembering. PS3 is incompatible with, for example, the position that “society values only the concentration of resources on talent and its creativity.\n\nSo it is not the ideals for everyone. However, PS3 defines the ideal of an organization only through the properties of the organization itself. In this sense, it is a “minimalist” ideal. It is possible to plugin such ideals as “freedom and equality (of members)” into PS3, but it is necessary to examine whether attached one will not destroy PS3. In this sense, PS3 is more like a “condition” than a normal “ideal.”\n\n# III: Empathy and Concern for Others in the PS3\n\nAs previously written, in the articles that follow, the conditions of pain minimization, security, scalability, and sustainability are referred to as “PS3” (Pain, Security, Scalability, Sustainability) and are assumed to be the basic requirements of governance (the minimal ideal).\n\nPS3 is a negative goal. It is a restraint against bad organizational conditions such as bullshit jobs and does not positively depict an ideal state.\n\nIn addition, PS3 does not treat attributes that are unconditionally good, such as diversity of members, as positive in and of themselves.\n\nFor example, if “lack of diversity leads to failure to learn and over-adaptation to the environment, resulting in the organization losing its ability to cope with reality and becoming unsustainable (a violation of Sustainability) or causing increased suffering (a violation of Pain),” then we say, “That is not good.”\n\nPS3 is similar to, but different from, a situation where the only thought is “follow the rules, and the rest is up to the individual. How is it different?\n\nFor one thing, empathy and concern for others, in a paraphrased form, are included in every item.\n\n* **Pain** minimization, as emotional or sensory empathy\n* **Security**, as concern for others with unfathomable intentions\n* **Scalability**, as the inability of institutions to be destroyed by being buried in the crowd of others\n* **Sustainability**, as the ability to continue to survive with others who have conflicting goals and beliefs\n\nAnd so on.\n\nPS3 is a working hypothesis postulated in thinking about the systematic possibilities of (autonomous) decentralized organizations made feasible by blockchain technology. In other words, it was hypothesized as a condition for thinking about “a way to keep the organization self-renewing without ideals or orders” in the search for the potential of a decentralized organization that does not exist in conventional centralized organizations bound from above by ideals, goals, and investments.\n\nMinimizing suffering is useless if there is no way to track and evaluate it, and if that trust is maintained by entrusting it to a particular power, we are ultimately back to a situation where there is no higher level of the state centralization. It is very tough to convince humankind, which has gone through totalitarianism and realism, that the state is not dishonest only in tracking suffering.\n\nHowever, now, with the blockchain, we can concretely imagine a way to technologically combine “traceability” (to suffering) with “decentralized trust” (without relying on centralized organizations and authorities). That is the pain token.\n\n# IV: What is Pain Token?\n\nPhilosopher Hannah Arendt called for a certain kind of courage, the kind of judgment that requires individuals to risk their lives to defy orders and maintain justice for humanity.\n\nCourage is probably necessary. However, governance that relies too much on individual courage is not sustainable. The number of people with courage is small and unlikely to increase.\n\nWe can now create a mechanism (which was impossible in the past) to objectively tell people that we do not like something without courage.\n\nAsaki Nishikawa, a member of VECTION, has proposed a simple system called “Pain Tokens”. It is a hypothetical right that assumes the following context.\n\n* It is easier to reach an agreement on pain than on happiness\n* Avoid believing that a cause (idea) or someone’s happiness naturally involves suffering\n* Make latent and invisible pain visible\n* Organizational failure can appear as a signal of pain, through which the organizational structure can change\n\nPain Tokens take the form of tokens (a unit of entitlement, like virtual currency) that are used in the network and operate according to the following rules:\n\n1. Pain Tokens are distributed to the organization’s members in fixed amounts over a fixed period of time\n2. Non-transferable\n3. Members decide how much to exercise each period\n4. Exercising is done anonymously\n5. The organization is obligated to attach to its output a traceable amount of Pain Tokens exercised in producing them\n\nPain Tokens are recorded in a public blockchain, and therefore cannot be tampered with, and are an anonymous, decentralized, change request authority for the organization.\n\nPain Tokens do not require any evaluation of the specific proposal. Moreover, it is unique in that it can anonymously express the fact that “pain” is occurring without knowing who is causing it or why it is painful.\n\nSo, how does an organization respond to the exercise of the Pain Token? For example, the following assumptions are possible.\n\nThe exercise of the Pain Token changes the organizational structure (the contribution of each member, authority, command, and the way resources to route).\n\nThe size and shape of the change are determined by a separately defined algorithm (without human intervention to prevent as much discretion as possible), taking into account the total amount of Pain Tokens exercised, the classified information of the exercised member groups, and the current organizational structure.\n\nPain Tokens are just a rudimentary example of a mechanism for tracing the pain signals of organizational members inside and outside the organization. However, if a similar mechanism can work successfully, it should be able to give a little more concrete substance to actions such as “Do not purchase products that are not fair.”\n\n# V: Changing the Organization through Pain Tokens (DAO + Pain Tokens)\n\nFor example, if a decentralized organization such as the DAO adopts pain tokens, we can consider the following changes in the automated organizational structure without the intervention of human will (politics).\n\n![Changing the organization through pain tokens](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pWDu35dxCn4_hwYtvpRi0.png?height=586&width=1024&&&&size=medium)\n\nN: A completely flat and decentralized network-like organization, tentatively assumed.\n\nT=N(T): tree-like routing structure (= organization) formed by the environment and learning up to a certain point.\n\nN(T) is a network that represents the same structure as T.\n\nT´=N(T´): Another tree structure newly re-routed by feeding back the results of exercising the pain token.\n\nN(T´) is a network that represents the same structure as T´.\n\nN´: An organization with multiple inherent tree-like support structures as dynamic routing structures that can quickly switch to N(T) and N(T´).\n\na: The network N becomes a tree T according to the current task and situation. The necessity to make it a tree is because trees are effective in many cases in terms of division of work and speed of execution. However, the problem is that once the tree is in place, rigidity, concession, discretion, and control become a problem.\n\nb: Use blockchain to trace the pain tokens fired as environmental maladaptation signals of T. This signal should use a public blockchain to ensure objectivity from intra-organizational politics. An automatic process that accounts for the pain token tracing will transform the tree T into T´. Then, run an algorithm to reflect the signals of these pain tokens to the organizational structure and routing in a human-free manner.\n\nSince it uses a public blockchain, the trace results are externally referable. The total amount of pain tokens that the organization has produced through its activities will appear like gas emissions. In this way, we will attempt to counteract the opacity of governance in dishonest companies and the like. If the organization does not disclose the tracing results, it will have to face the question from the public as to why it does not.\n\nThe members themselves are the ones who operate the pain tokens, and since they are anonymous and the blockchain ensures objectivity, fraud in the information input part is highly preventable. Instead, the problem seems to be the politics of how the pain tokens reflect the organizational structure and the update algorithm. We plan to discuss this separately at some point.\n\nc: Depending on the state of the environment, reconfigure the organizational structure as actions referring to past learning results. In the figure, N(T) and N(T´) appear simultaneously, but there can be many tree structures, and it is sometimes impossible to separate them clearly.\n\nIn this situation, heterogeneous tree structures live together in the organization, so relationships such as “boss-staff” reverse depending on the condition. If keeping such a dynamic structure has a higher adaptability and learning ability to the environment than a fixed tree-like organization, such an organization will have a robust competitive advantage. Since pain is subjective, it may be reduced by a free lunch (= consuming no physical resource), so to speak, independent of physical and statistical conservation, and therein lies the hope.\n\n# VI: From “Subject / Responsible” to “Pain Token / Distributed Change”\n\nThe use of AI and routing algorithms, described to illustrate the idea of pain tokens, is very conceptual, and realistically, it raises a variety of issues, especially around AI specification changes, such as lack of data, the impossibility of replication, unclear tasks, how to define rewards, and learning failures.\n\nConsidering these factors, routing change rules can be done mechanically, without the aid of machine learning, with straightforward rules whose meaning is obvious to everyone. However, in that case, the ability to adapt to the environment may be sacrificed. The point is to make it automated, decentralized, and explicit so that the responsibility and discretion of specific entities become as irrelevant as possible.\n\nThen, if such a system were to work, the question might arise, “Who should be responsible if an organizational change occurs that is unfortunate for someone else?”\n\nHowever, making a specific person or entity take responsibility is no longer effective in maintaining the system when it becomes complicated. It follows that the pain token is an attempt to replace the “subject / responsibility” pair with a “pain token / distributed change” pair.\n\n### Credits:\n\nOriginal idea and articles by Asaki NISHIKAWA,Draft written by Toshihiro FURUYA and Moya,Simultaneous editing by VECTION\n\nThis article is based on the “[Blockchain and Revolution: What are the conditions under which decentralization can be a ‘revolution’?](https://www.10plus1.jp/monthly/2017/01/issue-10.php)” and “[r/place subjects and governance: Blockchain and interfaces that invite revolution](https://ekrits.jp/2019/03/3046/).” We have extracted, added, and re-edited the parts describing pain tokens and PS3.", "timestamp": 1635512111, "digest": "vCDLvvHSQ67w_glfxUeC9ma7cJ0mIq2pdUTE8dljwmk", "contributor": "0x8B754F13f971A59fa05d1B5EA7830860c7C110af"}

That is the pain token.\n\n# IV: What is Pain Token?\n\nPhilosopher Hannah Arendt called for a certain kind of courage, the kind of judgment that requires individuals to risk their lives to defy orders and maintain justice for humanity.\n\nCourage is probably necessary. However, governance that relies too much on individual courage is not sustainable. The number of people with courage is small and unlikely to increase.\n\nWe can now create a mechanism (which was impossible in the past) to objectively tell people that we do not like something without courage.\n\nAsaki Nishikawa, a member of VECTION, has proposed a simple system called “Pain Tokens”. It is a hypothetical right that assumes the following context.\n\n* It is easier to reach an agreement on pain than on happiness\n* Avoid believing that a cause (idea) or someone’s happiness naturally involves suffering\n* Make latent and invisible pain visible\n* Organizational failure can appear as a signal of pain, through which the organizational structure can change\n\nPain Tokens take the form of tokens (a unit of entitlement, like virtual currency) that are used in the network and operate according to the following rules:\n\n1. Pain Tokens are distributed to the organization’s members in fixed amounts over a fixed period of time\n2. Non-transferable\n3. Members decide how much to exercise each period\n4. Exercising is done anonymously\n5. The organization is obligated to attach to its output a traceable amount of Pain Tokens exercised in producing them\n\nPain Tokens are recorded in a public blockchain, and therefore cannot be tampered with, and are an anonymous, decentralized, change request authority for the organization.\n\nPain Tokens do not require any evaluation of the specific proposal. Moreover, it is unique in that it can anonymously express the fact that “pain” is occurring without knowing who is causing it or why it is painful.\n\nSo, how does an organization respond to the exercise of the Pain Token? For example, the following assumptions are possible.\n\nThe exercise of the Pain Token changes the organizational structure (the contribution of each member, authority, command, and the way resources to route).\n\nThe size and shape of the change are determined by a separately defined algorithm (without human intervention to prevent as much discretion as possible), taking into account the total amount of Pain Tokens exercised, the classified information of the exercised member groups, and the current organizational structure.\n\nPain Tokens are just a rudimentary example of a mechanism for tracing the pain signals of organizational members inside and outside the organization. However, if a similar mechanism can work successfully, it should be able to give a little more concrete substance to actions such as “Do not purchase products that are not fair.”\n\n# V: Changing the Organization through Pain Tokens (DAO + Pain Tokens)\n\nFor example, if a decentralized organization such as the DAO adopts pain tokens, we can consider the following changes in the automated organizational structure without the intervention of human will (politics).\n\n![Changing the organization through pain tokens](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pWDu35dxCn4_hwYtvpRi0.png?height=586&width=1024&&&&size=medium)\n\nN: A completely flat and decentralized network-like organization, tentatively assumed.\n\nT=N(T): tree-like routing structure (= organization) formed by the environment and learning up to a certain point.\n\nN(T) is a network that represents the same structure as T.\n\nT´=N(T´): Another tree structure newly re-routed by feeding back the results of exercising the pain token.\n\nN(T´) is a network that represents the same structure as T´.\n\nN´: An organization with multiple inherent tree-like support structures as dynamic routing structures that can quickly switch to N(T) and N(T´).\n\na: The network N becomes a tree T according to the current task and situation. The necessity to make it a tree is because trees are effective in many cases in terms of division of work and speed of execution. However, the problem is that once the tree is in place, rigidity, concession, discretion, and control become a problem.\n\nb: Use blockchain to trace the pain tokens fired as environmental maladaptation signals of T. This signal should use a public blockchain to ensure objectivity from intra-organizational politics. An automatic process that accounts for the pain token tracing will transform the tree T into T´. Then, run an algorithm to reflect the signals of these pain tokens to the organizational structure and routing in a human-free manner.\n\nSince it uses a public blockchain, the trace results are externally referable. The total amount of pain tokens that the organization has produced through its activities will appear like gas emissions. In this way, we will attempt to counteract the opacity of governance in dishonest companies and the like. If the organization does not disclose the tracing results, it will have to face the question from the public as to why it does not.\n\nThe members themselves are the ones who operate the pain tokens, and since they are anonymous and the blockchain ensures objectivity, fraud in the information input part is highly preventable. Instead, the problem seems to be the politics of how the pain tokens reflect the organizational structure and the update algorithm. We plan to discuss this separately at some point.\n\nc: Depending on the state of the environment, reconfigure the organizational structure as actions referring to past learning results. In the figure, N(T) and N(T´) appear simultaneously, but there can be many tree structures, and it is sometimes impossible to separate them clearly.\n\nIn this situation, heterogeneous tree structures live together in the organization, so relationships such as “boss-staff” reverse depending on the condition. If keeping such a dynamic structure has a higher adaptability and learning ability to the environment than a fixed tree-like organization, such an organization will have a robust competitive advantage. Since pain is subjective, it may be reduced by a free lunch (= consuming no physical resource), so to speak, independent of physical and statistical conservation, and therein lies the hope.\n\n# VI: From “Subject / Responsible” to “Pain Token / Distributed Change”\n\nThe use of AI and routing algorithms, described to illustrate the idea of pain tokens, is very conceptual, and realistically, it raises a variety of issues, especially around AI specification changes, such as lack of data, the impossibility of replication, unclear tasks, how to define rewards, and learning failures.\n\nConsidering these factors, routing change rules can be done mechanically, without the aid of machine learning, with straightforward rules whose meaning is obvious to everyone. However, in that case, the ability to adapt to the environment may be sacrificed. The point is to make it automated, decentralized, and explicit so that the responsibility and discretion of specific entities become as irrelevant as possible.\n\nThen, if such a system were to work, the question might arise, “Who should be responsible if an organizational change occurs that is unfortunate for someone else?”\n\nHowever, making a specific person or entity take responsibility is no longer effective in maintaining the system when it becomes complicated. It follows that the pain token is an attempt to replace the “subject / responsibility” pair with a “pain token / distributed change” pair.\n\n### Credits:\n\nOriginal idea and articles by Asaki NISHIKAWA,Draft written by Toshihiro FURUYA and Moya,Simultaneous editing by VECTION\n\nThis article is based on the “[Blockchain and Revolution: What are the conditions under which decentralization can be a ‘revolution’?](https://www.10plus1.jp/monthly/2017/01/issue-10.php)” and “[r/place subjects and governance: Blockchain and interfaces that invite revolution](https://ekrits.jp/2019/03/3046/).” We have extracted, added, and re-edited the parts describing pain tokens and PS3.", "timestamp": 1635513169, "digest": "vCDLvvHSQ67w_glfxUeC9ma7cJ0mIq2pdUTE8dljwmk", "contributor": "0x8B754F13f971A59fa05d1B5EA7830860c7C110af"}

How are you doing? Hanging in there? I hope so.\n\nI know it can be hard, parenting during the pandemic and even harder if you have chosen to breastfeed. I’m choosing to share my experience and some tips with you in hopes that you can leave encouraged and informed.\n\nMy breastfeeding journey began way before I started producing milk. Once I was pregnant, I knew I wanted to breastfeed. I’m not sure the motivation came from but I was very determined to make it happen. Isn’t life funny…when you make a decision to become conscious or aware of something, things that are related start to appear in front of you. I had two high school FB friends in particular who were vocal about breastfeeding as black women (Thank you, Ashley and Whitney). I reached out to them and they poured so many resources on to me.\n\nThe most important resources were two Facebook groups; [Black Breastfeeding Mamas Circle](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1911893642453654) and  [Breastfeeding Support Group for Black Moms](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Blackmomsdobreastfeed)\n\nThose groups are a wealth of information, run by women who are extremely passionate about supporting Black women during their breastfeeding journey with emotional support and fact-based education.\n\nFrom one momma to another, here are some things you should know as you work remotely and breastfeed your baby.\n\n1. 1. \\*\\*Go see a lactation consultant who is board certified IBCLC \\*\\*([International Board Certified  Lactation Consultant](http://www.mybreastfedbaby.co.uk/what-is-an-ibclc.html)). Not ya pediatrician, not ya doctor, not ya momma or ya grandma. Get an IBCLC because they are certified in lactation specifically, pediatricians and other doctors usually are not trained in breastfeeding or as fluent as a lactation consultant. See one as soon as the baby is born and as you need support and education along your breastfeeding journey.\n   2. **Join a community.** You need support from other women who are dedicated to breastfeeding. You need people that can relate to your struggle (that dreaded feeling when you waste your liquid gold), your wins, and overall experience. Facebook groups were the best place for me. It’s best to join Facebook groups that have two audience profiles. For instance, Montessori x breastfeeding or black woman x breastfeeding. This way you’ll run into less friction and arguments and the conversations will be centered on the main topics. Trust me, momma, follow this advice to avoid drama.\n   3. **Ask for support!** Be vocal about what you need. When you first have a baby, everyone says “what can I do to help”, “let me know what you need”. Well, sis this is your time to ask for someone to do the dishes, laundry, help clean up. I felt guilty asking for help but when I finally did I felt so relieved. When your baby is young, it will feel like they’re latched on all the damn time. The least you can do is let people help you, ease your self of any worries and focus on yourself and your baby.\n   4. **Share educational articles with family.** I found this to be a useful way to gain support, especially because everyone thinks they know all about breastfeeding. Don't be afraid to hit someone with a Kelly mom link and don’t think this will solve your problems. Beware, sharing education is for rational family members only. You know there will always be some people who swear they’re an expert and at that moment you have to remind them who’s the momma (trust your gut, mommas know what best for their babies).\n   5. \\*\\*Get on a schedule. \\*\\*When it's time to go back to work, a schedule will be your friend. Get your baby on a schedule before you go back, so you know the feeding times ahead of time and you can schedule meetings around your feeding times. My son wouldn’t take a bottle so I had no choice but to breastfeed him through the workday.  It was hard for both of us. If you can pump, do it! Give yourself a lil breaky break. Pumping is still work but at least it won’t knock your focus.\n\n* \\*\\*Work in a separate room + door closed + earphones on. \\*\\*Working from home is hard when your baby is home too. Hearing a laugh, cry, babble just makes you want to hop in the other room and hold your baby. Well, if you have to work, I’m sorry to break it to you momma but you’ll need boundaries if you want to accomplish at least one thing by the end of the day.\n* \\*\\*Be kind to yourself. \\*\\*This is the most important piece of advice I can share with you. You decided to breastfeed, it’s the equivalent of a full-time job. Everything is not going to be perfect all the time and that’s ok. When it feels like shit is hitting the fan, just be grateful for your little one and try to slow down a little bit. They’ll only be this little once. 🙂\n\nI usually write about marketing but none of my work and growth would be possible without me doing the things I listed above. It’s ok to be a working momma, it’s ok to choose to breastfeed. You got this, you’ll be so proud of yourself when you look back on what you’re about to endure and accomplish.\n\nStay Golden,\n\nKarima", "timestamp": 1635513086, "digest": "HHISwOkYXIHQnjDTL3GFSmCIqisq44NjKiwRpO1J1Zs", "contributor": "0x4a38c18f58e574C28c57E3344F140a32141775D4"}

We’ve seen projects like [Friends with Benefits](https://consensys.net/blog/codefi/friends-with-benefits-a-new-model-for-social-tokens-on-ethereum/) introduce us to tokenized communities based on social bonds, shared value, and a collective approach to creating. As well as an [emergence of NFT DAOS](https://blog.niftex.com/nft-dao/), which allows its members to collectively build “high value” NFTs portfolios.\n\n**The Introduction**\n\nToday, we’re building the world’s first Hip Hop & R&B NFT DAO, called The Culture DAO, where we’re reimagining the application of collective creativity, NFT fractionalization & liquidity, trustless systems, fair decision making, and tokenized communities.\n\nLet’s get into what we bring to the table: :\n\n## U.N.I.T.Y\n\n**Collective Creativity:** *A NFT community that decides the creative direction and production of its NFTs.*\n\nWe imagine a metaverse where creative minds are inspired to make history with CryptoMC collections while taking action on their inspirations. The Culture DAO enables its community to be active participants in creating, coordinating, and releasing CryptoMC collections. This means that the community will choose the Hip Hop and/or R&B artists featured, the style of the trading cards, the budget for producing them as well as the designer who will bring the community’s vision to light. It all starts with a proposal and a community vote with $DOPE tokens. The Culture DAO proposals will be created on Snapshot, a gasless, user-friendly voting platform. Our community-generated NFT collections make the success of CryptoMCs mutually beneficial for everyone involved and of course, $DOPE holders.\n\n## Mo’ Money, Less Problems\n\n**Building our treasury so the entire community eats**\n\n$DOPE token holders govern the DAO treasury. They have the power to vote on how rewards from the sales of each CryptoMC generation are allocated and how the treasury spends its funds.\n\nThe Culture DAO’s protocol revenue is stored within the $DOPE treasury. It distributes CryptoMC sales and trading revenue to its treasury and to artists featured in CryptoMCs (via the Artist Reserve).\n\nTake a look into how the treasury is funded:\n\n* 33% of sales revenue from each CryptoMC generation\n* 5% of Secondary trade commissions \n* The treasury is also funded by profits from buying and selling NFTs acquired by the $DOPE NFT Vault\n\n![A Deeper Look Into The Culture DAO Treasury](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/julbzWZ8Ivr6o4Z9Z-dKY.png?height=710&width=484)\n\n### **Paying the artists**\n\nArtists featured in CryptoMCs are also rewarded, and can claim their royalties from The Culture DAO at any time. The Culture DAO has an Artist Reserve Fund, stored in a Gnosis Safe multi-sig wallet, which earns 33% of sales , 1% of trade value and makes payouts to confirmed artists’ public addresses via [Sablier](https://sablier.finance/) payment streams.\n\n## Everyone should get a piece of the pie ...\n\nWeb 3 has opened the doors for us to be able to fractionalize ownership of NFTs that we consider high value or culturally significant. Right now, there are amazing projects to facilitate this but the process is somewhat fragmented and illiquid.\n\nThe Culture DAO is a vehicle for NFT fractionalization by way of the $DOPE NFT vault. The $DOPE NFT Vault purchases, holds, and sells the world’s rarest Hip Hop and R&B NFTs as directed by $DOPE token holders who govern The Culture. The Culture DAO can also decide whether to acquire Blue Chip NFTs to store in the $DOPE NFT Vault or when to sell NFT assets.\n\nAll profits are paid out to The Culture DAO treasury which $DOPE token holders control. $DOPE token holders can vote to have rewards paid proportionally to the amount of $DOPE tokens each token holder has over the circulating supply of $DOPE tokens at the time of reward distribution.\n\nThink about this ...\n\nWhat if you could own a piece of a crypto punk? What would that change for you or your children? Owning a piece of cultural history is new for us, many of us come from families where we will be the first to create generational wealth. Right now, with crypto assets, we have an opportunity to pass on a new asset class to our families without speculatively spending our life savings or entering illiquid NFT pools.\n\n## A $**DOPE Community**\n\nThe better CryptoMCs and The Culture DAO does, the more the $DOPE tokens are demanded by the community. $DOPE token holders are rewarded when each CryptoMCs generation increases in popularity and market demand, the $DOPE Vault sells a NFT at a profit and through popularity yield.\n\n![Figure 1.0 The Culture DAO Liquidity Flywheel](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ezAECrHXK9xsXbkNwzKwX.png?height=1056&width=1896)\n\nThe Culture DAO focuses on building a community of $DOPE holders who are also the drivers of creation, managers of the treasury, and stewards of the community.\n\nNFTs present an opportunity for community members to collaborate on proposals and contribute to something in the crypto world that feels tangible. The ability to create new generations of CryptoMCs lowers the barrier for anyone who may feel like they’re “not technical enough” to contribute to a DAO or NFT project.\n\nThe Culture DAO incentivizes participation and we do this by making it super easy. We’ll use tools like Snapshot, discord, notion, video chat and emails for communication.\n\n## Trust-less Systems & Decision Making\n\nThe Culture DAO allows us to share values in a trusted environment where we can trust in the code to uphold the rules we set. It is constructed as a set of Ethereum smart contracts: 1 Governance smart contract, 1 NFT contract, and 1 ERC20 smart contract. The governance smart contract controls the NFT and ERC20 smart contracts and ensures all $DOPE token holder votes are implemented. \n\nToken holders can vote on how the treasury spends its funds, governance changes, reward distribution, NFT creation & destruction, artist reserve, NFT $DOPE Vault and community grants. Community members need at least 5 $DOPE tokens to vote on proposals and 500 $DOPE tokens to submit a proposal.\n\nFigure 3.0 provides a high level overview of how The Culture DAO is constructed and how capital flows throughout.\n\n![Figure 3.0: The Culture DAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nGccAaiuh-FtRYSefabi3.png?height=610&width=778)\n\nThe Culture DAO is segmented in to various parts, each with its own responsibilities - all governed by the $DOPE token holders. \n\n## It’s Time To Do It For The Culture\n\nHip-hop culture has become one of the most far-reaching arts movements of the past three decades ([Jeff Chang, It’s a Hip Hop World](https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/12/its-a-hip-hop-world/)) and it's time for us to transcend the power of that art into Web 3. Hip-hop is an important element of The Culture and has always been a voice for the people driving the culture.\n\nLaunching The Culture DAO will be another step in the direction to put “The Culture” in a position to monetize itself for the influence it drives and The Culture DAO is only the start. This will be one of the $DOPE-est movements in crypto. We’re adding the culture, bridging the gap, and asking YOU to join us.\n\n![CryptoMC (Not Final Version)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GZkUtuwO0G9HR_oqyHklb.png?height=1054&width=1808)\n\nWe would like to welcome you to the CryptoMCs universe, governed by The Culture DAO. \n\nIn December 2021, we’re dropping the GEN0 Collection of CryptoMCs, the world’s first Hip-Hop and R&B trading card NFTs. Each MC comes in the form of a randomly generated MP4 file.\n\nThere will be 2500 CryptoMCs, each CryptoMC owner will be airdropped 5000 $DOPE tokens and the Culture DAO community will be unlocked.\n\nIf you're reading this you've been a driver of the \"The Culture\" in some way. Now this your opportunity for you to get rewarded by being in the driver seat for all these years. \n\nJoin The Culture DAO, let's prosper together.

We’ll use tools like Snapshot, discord, notion, video chat and emails for communication.\n\n## Trust-less Systems & Decision Making\n\nThe Culture DAO allows us to share values in a trusted environment where we can trust in the code to uphold the rules we set. It is constructed as a set of Ethereum smart contracts: 1 Governance smart contract, 1 NFT contract, and 1 ERC20 smart contract. The governance smart contract controls the NFT and ERC20 smart contracts and ensures all $DOPE token holder votes are implemented. \n\nToken holders can vote on how the treasury spends its funds, governance changes, reward distribution, NFT creation & destruction, artist reserve, NFT $DOPE Vault and community grants. Community members need at least 5 $DOPE tokens to vote on proposals and 500 $DOPE tokens to submit a proposal.\n\nFigure 3.0 provides a high level overview of how The Culture DAO is constructed and how capital flows throughout.\n\n![Figure 3.0: The Culture DAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nGccAaiuh-FtRYSefabi3.png?height=610&width=778)\n\nThe Culture DAO is segmented in to various parts, each with its own responsibilities - all governed by the $DOPE token holders. \n\n## It’s Time To Do It For The Culture\n\nHip-hop culture has become one of the most far-reaching arts movements of the past three decades ([Jeff Chang, It’s a Hip Hop World](https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/12/its-a-hip-hop-world/)) and it's time for us to transcend the power of that art into Web 3. Hip-hop is an important element of The Culture and has always been a voice for the people driving the culture.\n\nLaunching The Culture DAO will be another step in the direction to put “The Culture” in a position to monetize itself for the influence it drives and The Culture DAO is only the start. This will be one of the $DOPE-est movements in crypto. We’re adding the culture, bridging the gap, and asking YOU to join us.\n\n![CryptoMC (Not Final Version)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GZkUtuwO0G9HR_oqyHklb.png?height=1054&width=1808)\n\nWe would like to welcome you to the CryptoMCs universe, governed by The Culture DAO. \n\nIn December 2021, we’re dropping the GEN0 Collection of CryptoMCs, the world’s first Hip-Hop and R&B trading card NFTs. Each MC comes in the form of a randomly generated MP4 file.\n\nThere will be 2500 CryptoMCs, each CryptoMC owner will be airdropped 5000 $DOPE tokens and the Culture DAO community will be unlocked.\n\nIf you're reading this you've been a driver of the \"The Culture\" in some way. Now this your opportunity for you to get rewarded by being in the driver seat for all these years. \n\nJoin The Culture DAO, let's prosper together.

90%合并，10%难度炸弹💣\n\n正如在[上一篇更新](https://tim.mirror.xyz/CHQtTJb1NDxCK41JpULL-zAJe7YOtw-m4UDw6KDju6c)里承诺的，这篇更新会深入介绍合并后的以太坊客户端架构。随着[Amphora 互操作性活动](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/10/15/amphora-merge-milestone/)取得的进展，合并的规范现在已经接近最终敲定 🎉\n\n在我们深入合并的内容之前，先简单介绍一下难度炸弹的最新情况！\n\n## Arrow Glacier 🏹🧊\n\n在第 124 次的核心开发者会议里 ([视频](https://youtu.be/BTtwbvZZpfs)、[推文](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1449047538103767044))，我们对难度炸弹的两个时间达成共识：升级在 2021 年 12 月进行，推迟到 2022 年 6 月。为此，我们需要一次网络升级——[Arrow Glacier](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/arrow-glacier.md)，它将仅包括关于推迟难度炸弹的 [EIP-4345](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4345)。\n\nArrow Glacier 计划在区块 13,773,000 激活，预计时间会在 [2021 年 12 月 8 日](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/13773000)。\n\n在核心开发者会议上，我们对冰河时期推迟的多个选项进行了讨论。之所以选择 6 月，是因为我们有信心“合并”能在此前实现，而且我们想避免在此前再组织一次难度炸弹推迟。\n\n当然，合并和难度炸弹是分开的：它需要单独的一次网络升级，且是基于 PoW `total difficulty` 的临界值来激活的。**这意味着我们不需要“等待”难度炸弹爆炸才能把以太坊过渡到权益证明。同样地，如果我们在过渡上遇到问题，我们可以决定再次推迟难度炸弹。**\n\n希望 Arrow Glacir 将是 PoW 以太坊🤞🏻到合并之前最后一次网络升级！\n\n## 合并后的架构🏗\n\n合并的架构利用了以太坊用于执行链 (Eth1) 和信标链 (Eth2) 久经实战的客户端。由于它们已经存在了，继续使用它们是合理的。\n\n概括来说，在合并过程中，客户端将从根据 PoW 链转为根据 PoS 链来决定以太坊的最新有效区块。此外，客户端大多数的功能，以及更重要的 EVM、它的状态，和它是如何执行交易的，都保持不变。\n\n**合并后，现在的 Eth1 和 Eth2 客户端分别变成以太坊的执行层和共识层 (或叫做引擎)。这意味着 Eth1 或信标链客户端的节点运行者将需要运行堆栈的“另一半”，以拥有一个完整的验证节点**。 Danny Ryan 制作了非常好的图表对其进行说明。它们都已经[被铸造成 NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/when-merge) 了，所有的收益都将用于奖励合并工作的工程师和研究员。\n\n![合并后的客户端架构。NFT 艺术家：Danny Ryan](https://i.imgur.com/l65cGy0.png)\n\n上图展示了合并后一个完整的以太坊客户端的样子。让我们以此为起点，深入到每个组件。\n\n## 信标节点🚨\n\n现在，信标节点是对空区块 (从终端用户角度来看) 达成共识的。这些区块包括与共识相关的信息，称为操作 (Operations)，比如证明 (attestations)、存款合约根和验证者的罚没/退出，但不包括 Eth1 意义上的交易信息 (例如，发送 ETH 或与智能合约交互)。合并将改变这个情况。\n\n在合并发生时，信标节点将监测当前的 PoW 链，并等待它触达预设定的`total difficulty` （总难度）阈值，被称为 `TERMINAL_TOTAL_DIFFICULTY` (终结总难度)。一旦出了一个区块的`total difficulty >= TERMINAL_TOTAL_DIFFICULTY`，该区块将会被视为最后的 PoW 区块。随后的区块都开始由信标链上的验证者构建和证明。\n\n要做到以上内容，信标节点将需要与它们的执行引擎 (以前的 Eth1 客户端) 通信，并请求它生成或验证`ExecutionPayloads` (执行数据)。这些数据是 Eth1 区块合并后的等同物。它们包含这些信息：父块的哈希值 (parent's hash)、状态根 (state root)、基本费用 ( base fee)、需要执行交易列表。一旦这些信息都被生成或验证了，信标节点将在 p2p 网络与其他节点分享。\n\n![合并后的区块：共识层 (即信标节点) 验证所有现在属于信标链区块的栏位。当它在网络上收到 ExecutionPayloads 时，它会将其传送到执行层进行验证。](https://i.imgur.com/9ju947n.png)\n\n为了在共识层和执行层建立通信，会引入一组新的 JSON RPC 端点：Engine API (引擎应用程序接口)。\n\n## Engine API ⚙️\n\n[Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/main/src/engine) 是共识层和执行层间的通信接口。它不在执行层的公共 JSON RPC API，而在一个独立的端口。为了简单，对 API 的调用总是由共识层发起，而 API 只引入三个方法：`engine_executePayload`、 `engine_forkchoiceUpdated` 和 `engine_getPayload`。让我们逐个看看它们是做什么的：\n\n* `engine_executePayload` (引擎执行数据)要求执行层验证 `ExecutionPayload` 是否符合所有协议规则。\n\n  在通过这个调用接收到数据后，执行层将返回 `VALID`/`INVALID` (有效/无效) 或，如果它还没同步完链头，则返回 `SYNCING` (同步中)。因为一个区块的有效性是取决于它的父块有效性的，如果执行层缺乏历史数据来评估数据的有效性，它将从网络上获取这些数据。\n* `engine_forkchoiceUpdated` (引擎分叉选择更新)是共识层在网络上告知执行层新的链头和最终敲定的区块的方式。如果共识层需要执行层在最新的链头区块上生成一个新的 `ExecutionPayload`，它会和这个调用一起传送一个 `payloadAttributes`  栏位。\n\n  `payloadAttributes` 栏位包含与执行引擎生成一个`ExecutionPayload`的相关信息，特别是 `timestamp` (时间戳), `random` (乱数) and `feeRecipient` (相当于以前的 `coinbase`) 的值。在接收到这个调用时，执行层将更新它的链头，根据需要进行同步，以及，如果有需要的话，开始用 `payloadAttributes` 的数值构建一个 `ExecutionPayload`。\n* `engine_getPayload` (引擎获取数据)请求执行层返回它的最佳 `ExecutionPayload`，它的构建过程已在之前对 `engine_forkChoiceUpdated` 的相关调用时启动了。\n\n  这就是当验证者必须出块时，它从它的执行引擎获取一个有效区块的方式。其他节点在从 p2p 层接收到该区块后将调用 `engine_executePayload`来评估其有效性。\n\n......就是这样！有了这三个新的端点，共识层和执行层可以就链的状态和交易数据进行通信。现在，让我们深入了解执行引擎的工作原理。\n\n## 执行引擎🛠\n\n如上文所述，执行引擎就是合并后的 Eth1 客户端。在这点上，任何与共识相关的内容都从它们的权限中移除了。它们的主要重点变成状态管理、区块构建和验证，这些都稍有修改。大部分的修改都写在了 [EIP-3675](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675)。\n\n第一，合并将需要对区块格式进行一些修改。有些仅与 PoW 而非 PoS 相关的栏位会被设为 `0` (或它们的数据结构的等同物)。这些栏位不是与挖矿 (`difficulty`, `mixHash`, `nonce`) 就是与 ommers (`ommers`, `ommersHash`) 有关，它们在 PoS 上都是不存在的。主网上 `extraData` 的长度也将被限制在 32 个字节上。\n\n第二，由于合并后代币增发仅会在信标链上发生，执行层将不再处理区块和叔块奖励。也就是说。执行引擎将仍然负责处理交易费。事实上，当它创建 `ExecutionPayload`时，执行引擎会确保所有交易发送者至少可以支付当前的 `baseFeePerGas` (每单位gas 的基本费用)，且任何额外费用都会被发送到 `feeReceipient` (费用接收者)。请注意，`feeReceipient` 指的是“传统”的以太坊地址，而不是信标链验证者。\n\n第三，当 PoS 取代了 PoW，执行引擎将不再广播区块。这意味着将弃用在 p2p 网络上的 `NewBlockHashes (0x01)` 和 `NewBlock (0x07)` 的处理程序。同样，执行层将仍然负责同步网络状态，广播交易和维持它的交易池。\n\n下图同样由 Danny Ryan 制作，它展示了当合并发生时执行层弃用 PoW 转而依赖信标链的过程。\n\n![区块不再生成，而信标链区块在合并后开始包含 ExecutionPayloads。](https://tim.mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FIpF4PeStURgtLYdXGs0Rn.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\nPoW 区块不再生成，而信标链区块在合并后开始包含 ExecutionPayloads。\n\n我们现在已经介绍了客户端如何处理区块以及合并后进行内部通信的核心组件了。现在，让我们简单谈谈系统的的各种相对“边缘”的组件。\n\n## P2P 网络、用户 API 和 同步📡\n\n如本文第一张图表所示，合并后，执行和信标链层都在 p2p 网络里。除了执行层上区块广播被弃用外，p2p 网络上的所有东西保持不变：在它们各自独立的 p2p 网络上，信标节点将广播证明、罚没等，而执行层将分享交易、同步状态等。\n\n同样，[信标链](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-apis) 和 [执行层](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/) 上的用户 API 都将保持独立，除了新创建的 Engine API。\n\n有一个组件是跨越两个层的，就是同步。我们正在为合并前和合并后各种可能的边缘情况开发各种同步策略。它们仍在完善和测试中，并可能成为未来的深入研究主题👀\n\n## 后续工作👀\n\n[Amphora](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/10/15/amphora-merge-milestone/) 工作坊后，工作重心一直放在规范的完善和开发测试网的测试中。在未来几周内，预计规范将确定下来，即我们预期不会再有大修改的地步。\n\n同时， [Pithos](https://pithos-explorer.ethdevops.io/) 测试网构建并运行起来了，有多个客户端组合每天在上面做测试，[计划下周有一个社区会议](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/402)，让基础设施和工具提供商快速了解合并。到时见👋🏻\n\n![在 Pithos 测试网上运行的各种客户端组合，来源：

{"id": "Rw0YAIbaRR2IwQiKtKIusWAFff_pjeoueeDykhlYQQE", "title": "为什么 rollups + 数据分片模式将是唯一可持续的高可扩展性解决方案", "body": "来源 | [polynya.medium](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)\n\n翻译/校对：Lochaiching/ECN\n\n关于 rollups + 数据分片 (以下简称 rads) 的讨论，通常是从它会 “更安全和去中心化” 的角度着手，但这只是其中一部分原因。rads 会成为实现全球规模吞吐量的唯一解决方案的真正原因是其可观的可扩展性 —— 这是长期实现数百万 TPS 的唯一方法。更加具体一点，我个人会偏向考虑 zkRollups，因为 optimistic rollups 有自己固有的局限性。我会得出以上论点，主要归结为两个原因： a) 技术可持续性以及 b) 经济可持续性。\n\n# 技术可持续性\n\n要是进行进一步的细分，一个在技术上可持续的区块链节点必须做到以下三件事：\n\n1\\.在链上与节点保持同步一致。\n\n2\\.能够在合理的时间内从创世区块开始同步。\n\n3\\.避免状态膨胀甚至失控。\n\n显然，对于去中心化的网络来说，所有这些都没有商量的余地，并且会容易导致严重的瓶颈出现。\\[附录：有人指出 2) 的内容并不是必要的，这一点我同意。因为经过社会共识验证的快照就已经能达到很好的水平了。\\] 以太坊在尝试实现这三点的同时，推动其他可能性的发展，而这显然还不够。同时保留了这三点的分片链最多只能将可扩展性提高到几千TPS —— 但这种程度还不够。\n\n## 中心化解决方案及其硬性限制\n\n但较中心化的网络可能会开始妥协。1) 不需要每个人都跟上链的同步情况，只要能满足最低要求的验证者数量即可。2) 不需要从创世纪区块开始同步，只需使用快照和其他快捷方式就可以了。3) 状态休眠机制 (state expiry) 是一个很好的解决方案，并将在大多数的链上实现；在那之前，像 regenesis  这样的蛮力到期解决方案 (brute force expiry solutions) 可能会有所帮助。介绍到这里，大家可能会觉得这种网络不够去中心化，但我们本文中并不关心这一点 —— 本文中只关心可扩展性这个问题。\n\n其中，1) 是硬性限制，而 RAM、CPU、磁盘 I/O 和带宽是每个节点的潜在瓶颈，更重要的是 —— 在网络中保持最低要求的节点同步，这意味着扩容的程度具有一定的硬性限制。事实上，你可以看到像 Solana 和 Polygon 这样的 PoS 网络已经努力到了最高的程度了，尽管目前处理的只是几百 TPS (不包括投票) 的交易。之前我访问 Solana Beach 的网站时，看到上面说 “Solana Beach 在同步 Solana 区块链节点上遇到了一些问题”，其中提到的区块时间为 0.55 秒 —— 比 0.4 秒的目标慢了 43%。你至少需要 128 GB 才能跟上区块的同步，即使 256 GB RAM 的空间也不足以从创世区块开始同步 —— 所以你需要快照来使其发挥作用。这是上述提到的折衷方案 2)，我们不会把太多的笔墨放在这上面，可扩展性才是我们今天的关注点。[Jameson Lopp 在一台 32 GB 的机器上做了一个测试](https://blog.lopp.net/2021-altcoin-node-sync-tests/) —— 在开始之前就预计了测试失败的必然性 —— 它在一个小时内崩溃了，根本无法同步上区块的数据。当然，Solana 在这里给其他链做了一个很好的示范，因为其他链上的情况其实也是如此。\n\n## zkRollups 可以轻易地打败中心化的 L1\n\nzkRs 的要求甚至比最中心化的 L1 还要高得多，因为有效性证明使其与最去中心化的 L1 一样安全！ 你可以在给定时间内，只有一个活跃节点的前提下，仍然保持高度的安全性。当然，为了抗审查和可恢复性，我们需要多个定序者，但这些定序者不需要达成共识，还可以相应地进行轮换。例如，Hermez 和 Optimism 只计划在某一段时间内设置一个活跃定序者，并可以让多个定序者在不同时间段进行轮换。\n\n此外，zkRs 可以利用所有这些创新来使全节点客户端尽可能地高效，无论它们是为 zkRs 还是 L1 服务的。 zkRollups 可以通过状态休眠机制变得非常有创意，因为交易历史可以直接从 L1 开始重建。 事实上，将来还会有[分片和交易历史访问预编译](https://ethresear.ch/t/future-proof-shard-and-history-access-precompiles/9781)的创新，这些技术能够帮助实现直接在数据分片上运行 zkRs。我们还需要轻量级的独立提款形式来达到所有功能上的安全性需求。\n\n然而，即使在这里，我们也受到了硬性限制。就算是 1 TB 的 RAM 或者 2 TB 的 RAM，这样的配置也是有硬性限制的。除此之外，还需要考虑能够同步节点数据的基础设施提供商。所以，没错，zkR 的可扩展性确实比最能扩容的 L1 都强得多，然而单靠它本身就达到全球规模的可扩展性也不可能实现。\n\n## 保持使用多个 zkR\n\n简单来说就是在以太坊数据分片上运行多个 zkR —— 并且是有效的分片 zkR。这种 zkR 一旦发布，它们将提供大规模的数据可用性，并将根据需要继续进行扩展，[预计在 10 年内将达到 1500 万 TPS](https://polynya.medium.com/conjecture-how-far-can-rollups-data-shards-scale-in-2030-14-million-tps-933b87ca622e?source=user_profile---------21----------------------------)。一个 zkR 是没有办法做到这种程度的吞吐量，但是多个 zkR 共同运作是可以实现的。\n\n具有不同的 zkR 分片会破坏可组合性吗？以目前的情况来看，确实会。但这个领域中不断涌现出别的方案，比如像 Hop、Connext、cBridge、Biconomy 这种快速桥接项目，以及[像 dAMM ](https://medium.com/starkware/damm-decentralized-amm-59b329fb4cc3)这样可以让多个 zkR 共享流动性的创新解决方案。许多这些创新在 L1 上更加难以实现以及不可能。 我希望在这个领域能够继续保持创新，可以让这类拥有多个 zkR 的链能够实现无缝互操作性。\n\n**太长不读：无论最中心化的 L1 能做什么，zkR 都可以做得更好，TPS 也明显可以达到更高。此外，我们可以有多个 zkR，从而有效地实现全球规模的吞吐量。**\n\n# 经济可持续性\n\n这个问题相当直接。一个网络需要收集更多的交易费用，而不是发放给验证者和托管商的增发奖励。但在现实中，这是一个非常复杂的话题，我会尽量简单地阐述。诚然，用户的对代币的投机热情和期待的货币溢价可以使网络保持可持续发展，即使它实际上处于亏损状态。但对于一个真正有弹性、去中心化的网络，我们应该努力实现经济可持续性。\n\n## 中心化 L1 的维护成本远高于所收取的收入\n\n下面来看看我们最喜欢举的两个例子 —— Polygon PoS 和 Solana。Polygon PoS 每天收取大约 5 万 美元的交易费用，也就是每年 1800 万美元。与此同时，它在增发奖励方面的分配却远大于 4 亿美元。所以要是你计算一下就能得出这相当于是 95% 的净亏损，这其实达到了一个令人难以置信的数字了！至于 Solana，它在很长的一段时间内仅收取约 1 万美元/天的收益，但随着投机情况越来越狂热，它已显着增加至约 10 万美元/天，即每年约 3650 万美元。Solana 提供了一个更夸张的增发奖励 —— 40 亿美元，这个数据导致了 99.2% 的净亏损数值。我从 [Token Terminal](https://www.tokenterminal.com/) 和 [Staking Rewards](https://www.stakingrewards.com/) 上得到这些数字，我对这些数字的估算已经算是保守了 —— 实际上它们看起来更糟。但我们也应该知道，以太坊一天收取的费用就比这两个网络全年的总和还要多！\n\n## 不能仅仅将吞吐量提高到超出技术可能的范围\n\n目前的论点为：他们将来会处理更多的交易并收取更多的费用，增发会减少，最终，网络将实现收支平衡。但是实际情况要复杂得多。首先，即使我们考虑到 Solana 在这十年内达到的最低增发率的话，它仍会达到 96% 的损失。事情是如此地扭曲，以至于这几乎无关紧要 —— 需要使吞吐量远远超过收支平衡的可能性。作为一个思想实验，按照当前的交易费，Solana 需要达到 154,000 TPS 才能实现收支平衡 —— 但是鉴于当前的硬件和带宽情况，这是完全不可能的。\n\n但更大的问题是，这些额外增加的交易并不是白来的 —— 它们对带宽有了更高的需求，更大的状态膨胀，以及对系统的要求也更高了。有些人进一步争辩说，目前有很大的空间，他们可以做得更多。然而，正如我在技术可扩展性部分所提到的，这充其量只是一个划问号的假设 —— 因为你需要 128GB 的内存才能成功同步一条只做几百 TPS 的链的数据。另一个论点是硬件将变得更便宜 —— 这倒毋庸置疑，但这不是一个神奇的解决方案 —— 你要么需要选择更大的规模，要么将成本降低，或在这两者中间找到平衡。请注意 zkR 也将同样受益于摩尔定律和尼尔森定律。\n\n## 最后，所有中心化的 L1 都必须增加他们的费用。\n\n这种情况的唯二解决办法是：a) 网络变得更加中心化；b) 当网络达到其极限时，费用就会增加。方案 a) 具有限制，如上所讨论那样，因而选择 b) 是无可避免的。可以看到这种情况发生在 Polygon PoS 上，[费用就开始攀升](https://polygonscan.com/chart/gasprice)。事实上，币安智能链已经经历了这个过程，现在已经是一个可持续发展的网络了 —— 尽管达到这个目的的费用要高很多。但请记住，我们在这里谈论的只是经济的可持续性。\n\n在继续下文之前，我想再次指出，目前存在的变量还有很多很多 —— 比如价格升值和波动性 ——这绝对是一种简单的看法，但我相信这一类一般的逻辑会让你在理解上更加清楚。\n\n## rads 是如何显著提高效率的，同时成本却可以这么低。\n\n下面谈到 rads。在 rollup 方面，它的维护成本非常非常低，只有很少的节点需要在特定的时间内运行，而且不需要昂贵的共识机制来保证其安全性。然而它们都提供了比任何 L1 更大的吞吐量。Rollups 可以简单地收取 L2 名义上的交易费，从而保持网络的可盈利性。在数据可用性方面，以太坊目前是高度通缩的，结合高效的信标链共识机制，只需要保持最低水平的活动就可以实现接近于零的增发了。\n\n因此，整个 rads 生态系统可以以更大的可扩展性加上更低的潜在费用来保持可持续性。事实上，zkRs 最符合 L1 的利益，我很高兴 [Solana 至少在考虑这个问题](https://polynya.medium.com/anatoly-yakovenko-on-solana-as-an-ethereum-rollup-78329ca69a98?source=user_profile---------4----------------------------)。\n\n**太长不读：Rads 的成本开销只占中心化 L1 的一小部分，因而同样的花费，rads 能够为用户提供更大的吞吐量；或者实现相似的吞吐量，rads 只需花费一小部分的费用。**\n\n短期观点\n\n很重要的一点是，rads 是一个长期的方案，[需要几年的时间才能发展成熟](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/paipgj/why_the_transition_to_rollupcentric_ethereum_is_a/)。\n\n不过，在短期内，有两个选择。\n\n.\t一个可持续的中心化 L1，如币安智能链和 rollups。\n\n.\t一个不可持续的中心化 L1。\n\n1. 对大多数人来说太昂贵了。像 Hermez、dYdX 或 Loopring 这样的较佳的 rollup 方案[提供类似 BSC 的费用](https://l2fees.info/)，而 Arbitrum One 和 Optimistic Ethereum 还有一段路要走 (尽管下个月发布的 OVM 2.0 承诺将会把 OE 的费用降低 10 倍)。2) Polygon PoS 和 Solana 目前提供较低的费用，但我已经在上文做了一个广泛的论证，说明了这从长期来看是不可持续的。不过在短期内，他们为那些寻求低价交易的用户提供了一个很好的选择。但其实还有第三个选择， 3)Validiums。\n\nValidiums 提供的费用和 Polygon PoS 还有 Solana 相当 —— 事实上，Immutable X 现在已经上线，可以免费铸造 NFT，[你可以在 SwiftMint](https://swiftmint.io/) 上试试。目前 validium 的数据可用性方面和中心化的 L1 一样，可以算得上都属于不可持续的情况。虽然还可以选择使用数据可用性委员会等替代性的共识方法，但实际上这个选择还是要便宜很多的。Validiums 的绝妙之处在于，当数据分片发布后，它们可以直接向前兼容到 rollups 或 volitions。当然，如上所述，L1 也有这个选项，但这将是一个更具颠覆性的变化。另外，使用 validium 明显比中心化的  L1 更安全。\n\n# 总结\n\n* 区块链行业尚不具备实现全球规模吞吐量的技术。\n* 一些项目的费用特别低，实际上是通过对代币的投机行为进行补贴。当然，对于那些正在寻找低价费用的用户来说，这是一个不错的选择。不过你要意识到这不是一种可持续的模式，更不用说去中心化和安全妥协上的问题了。\n* 但即使是这些低费用的项目，如果有机会获得巨大的流量，长期来看也是会被迫增加费用。永远都会有更多新的、更中心化的 L1 出现。这是一场无法长期持续的争夺底层用户的竞争。\n* 目前，确实存在可持续的选择，例如币安智能链（至少在经济上）或优化的 rollups，它们的费用范围约在 0.1～1 美元之间。\n* 从长远来看，rads 是唯一可以扩展到数百万 TPS，达到全球规模吞吐量，同时在技术和经济上保持可持续性的解决方案。除此之外，还能保持高度安全、去中心化、无需许可、去信任以及可信的中立性，这确实很让人意想不到。正如一位智者曾经说过的那样，“任何足够先进的技术都与魔法无异”，这就是 rollups + 数据分片所呈现的。\n\n最后，这不仅仅是以太坊，[Tezos 和 Polygon 也制作了以 rollup 为中心的枢轴](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBSs0DSuzQ)，并且所有 L1 都不可避免 a) 应用 zkRollup； b) 成为一条让 rollup 在其之上构建的安全的、提供数据可用性的链；或 c) 接受技术过时并完全依赖营销、memes 和网络效应。\n\n\nECN的翻译工作旨在为中国以太坊社区传递优质资讯和学习资源，文章版权归原作者所有，[转载须注明原文出处以及ethereum.cn](http://xn--ethereum-vp1mp8wkye2oa647cfk5b2wb2v6c083k0ia912m.cn)，若需长期转载，请联系eth@ecn.co进行授权。", "timestamp": 1635515160,

{"id": "Vfosgr3RoY7eOWrjkWiPZ88huTMWSYRyHI34lSACJHE", "title": "CrossFit's Web3 Killer", "body": "As I was finishing up a workout at my local box, I saw an old ad for the gym taped to the white board.\n\n“CrossFit is more than fitness. It’s a community.” \n  \n No arguments here. I firmly believe one of the reasons CrossFit came to thrive is community. The reason people pay a lot of money for CrossFit is community. The reason most people stay active members at their gyms is community.\n\nPeople want to feel a part of something.\n\nBut something very interesting happened during the pandemic. CrossFit’s founder, Greg Glassman, was [ousted](https://www.clubindustry.com/commercial-clubs/greg-glassman-sells-crossfit-inc-to-affiliate-owner-eric-roza) for making insensitive tweets about the George Floyd situation, and further allegations of sexism, racism and homophobia were disclosed.\n\nIn the various articles that reported this, Glassman was described as a co-founder and then sole owner of CrossFit. All major organizational decisions were ultimately signed off by one person. The CEO. Glassman. \n  \n Many affiliates (gyms officially associated with CrossFit HQ) distanced themselves from the organization, removed the term “CrossFit” from their names, and began saying that their methodology was functional fitness. The underlying sentiment was that CrossFit the community was separate from HQ.\n\nThis change, which many reverted when Glassman stepped down, showed the ability for CrossFit to decentralize. The pandemic showed that affiliates have the ability to manage their communities online. The various programs offered by professional CrossFit athletes proved that you don’t even need to join an affiliate. These programs’ workouts are organized similarly to local gyms, and the online community can provide the same sense of belonging.\n\nThis is all amazing. Despite losing one of its strongest attributes with in-person community and relationships, most affiliates managed to stay afloat. Members didn’t cancel their memberships, they rented equipment to take home, and everyone rode out the Covid wave while it lasted. \n\nThe biggest issue with all of this? Ownership.\n\nThe hardest thing when managing an online community is incentivizing its members to remain active. Many try do this through various channels. Zoom classes, swag drops, the occasional (but painfully awkward) meet and greets… They all get some initial participation going, but for most, the activity wains as new members’ initial enthusiasm drops.\n\nAlso, the lack of coordination from gyms at the top level was a concern. Many gyms remain (officially or unofficially) disaffiliated with CrossFit HQ and have decided to go in their own direction. This lack of coordination can lead to a poor end product, which ends up with people getting physically hurt. Five times CrossFit Games champion Mat Fraser brought [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVTLQx0HNYE) up on Joe Rogan’s podcast.\n\nI’ll spare you all from the crypto promo, but something made possible by crypto is a truly decentralized organizational structure. One that gives everyone the opportunity to own a stake, and participate within the organization at the speed they’d like to.\n\nThis structure could create CrossFit’s 3.0 dream or nightmare.\n\n1\\.0 was inception. 2.0 was the use of technology to track and scale the progress of CrossFit communities and its members.\n\n3\\.0 is something much more powerful.\n\n3\\.0 will be inspired by the Web3 revolution. It will incentivize community members through financial capital, and will build upon the social capital that CrossFit has already generated.\n\nI wrote above that online CrossFit at times was painful, but it doesn’t have to be. With more coordination, standardization of communication channels, and a hierarchy based on CrossFit-related competence, combined with participation and ownership, would create a real engine that redefines what it means to be a part of a fitness community.\n\nLet’s break down the four things (in my opinion) that are most pressing to build this type of engine.\n\n1. Ownership \n  \n In order for someone to be an owner, they need to provide value to the organization. In order to receive ownership for providing value, there needs to be a treasury (sum of money) where collateral can be added capital can be distributed from.  \n  \n The best way to organize this is through digital tokens. A group of early founders create a token pool and put up their own individual capital to receive portions of the pool. They then allocate certain percentages of the pool for future members to invest, earn through participation and they can also allocate tokens for other initiatives they find important. For example, scholarship funds or community programs. \n  \n This form of incentivisation creates financial reward and gain for members of the community as it grows, scales and increases in relevancy and mind share in the world.\n\n   People like making money.  \n \n2. Social Capital \n  \n As mentioned, one of CrossFit’s best attributes is its community. If the community structure and organization were to move online, there is still a real human element that can be leveraged.\n\n   Say that members of this online community have engaged with each other for certain periods of time, and one travels to a part of the world where the other lives. They can meet up at the gym for a workout, have a coffee or a beer, anything. \n  \n The physical locations are already in place for this; there just needs to be better coordination and incentives to go out and interact within said locations. People already drop in to CrossFit gyms when they’re on the road (for outrageous fees may I add). This experience provides most a great workout, a greeting or two, but that’s really it. \n  \n Doing this, however, through a format that is powered by an online community which you own a stake in will make the human experience more meaningful, memorable and worthwhile.  \n  \n I love dropping in to gyms, but imagine a world where your drop-in is actually a long awaited meet up? This is a better form of community. \n \n3. Hierarchy & Governance \n  \n Founding members would need to have some form of credibility within CrossFit, or functional fitness in general. While wild west scenarios are fun, poor competence structures in this scenario would result in people getting physically hurt. Therefore, the founding team would need to create an onboarding process that determines a person’s competence level related to CrossFit. They would also need to create an onboarding process that enables aspiring contributors to work on the projects they want to. \n  \n **Hierarchy** \n  \n For example, let’s say someone enters the community. They’ve purchased tokens and are now a member of the organization. Where do they stand in the hierarchy? \n  \n The organization creates an exam that members take to show their knowledge of CrossFit and/or functional fitness. Their score then determines where they stand in the competence hierarchy. \n  \n Let’s say there are three levels to this. 3) Member 2) Athlete 1) Coach. People who join the community are explicitly told that coaches are those who provide fitness guidance, athletes can help with less pressing questions, and members are good to chat with. \n  \n This hierarchy doesn’t exclude people from participation in various projects, it rather establishes a group of people where community members can route their fitness specific questions. \n  \n **Contributing** \n  \n The other side of this is the onboarding of members who want to contribute. This can be done fairly easily at the beginning. Community members are asked where they want to participate, they are encouraged to engage in that project’s communication channels and are awarded with tokens as they complete projects. If they were not previous token holders, they then become members of the organization and are assigned to the third level of the fitness competence hierarchy until passing the “exam” to move up. \n  \n **Governance** \n  \n The two subjects discussed previously do not affect governance. Governance determines the direction of the organization, and there are many models that can be followed. To not dive down a technical rabbit hole, we’ll keep this explanation shorter.  \n  \n Any decision that affects the organization should be voted on by its members. Anyone who has ownership (owns tokens) in the organization can vote on proposals that would affect the future state of the organization. \n  \n This furthers the financial incentivisation that members have, and will likely keep them more active and invested in the organization’s future. It changes the game completely. HQ doesn’t tell you what to do. People submit proposals and members vote yes or no. If there are more yes votes than no, the proposal passes.  \n  \n A democratic fitness organization. Who would’ve thought? \n  \n PS. There are many ways to determine the weight and value of someone’s vote. I would recommend googling *coin voting blockchain* and *quadratic voting blockchain* to understand this better. \n \n4. Coordination \n  \n The biggest hurdle that a prospective organization like this faces is coordination. Founding members will need to quickly establish the communication channels, member onboarding, the organization’s economics (tokenomics), and the governance structure. \n  \n By doing this, the organization will have a clear strategic narrative, new members won’t feel lost in a likely new world, and the community will be able to operate autonomously while maintaining its vision.  \n  \n If these processes are quickly established, prior to scale, the end product of a CrossFit 3.0 will be far superior than its current state.  \n \n\nCrossFit has changed my life for the better, and I couldn’t agree more with its philosophy and approach to sport, health and wellness. However, with another economic revolution on the horizon, it’s important that organizations that heavily rely on community understand the power of Web3 and DAO organizational structures. \n\nReason being, the decentralization experiment for CrossFit has produced a lot of economic upside for HQ and the influential persons associated with it and the CrossFit Games. Again this wasn’t and isn’t a bad thing, but it’s important to understand as generational and economic circumstances transform, organizations must transform with them. Otherwise, they will become increasingly irrelevant and possibly fail.\n\nA truly decentralized CrossFit that gives community ownership and a voice is an interesting proposition. One I believe would succeed.

{"id": "CX7oTsThrUsgtmJNvsRI925Z9UTKIaS5eRqwVQ2tUsU", "title": "After Reading this Article my Mom Finally Understands Crypto, NFTs, DAOs, and the Beginnings of Web3 ", "body": "**In 1983 the internet was born. In the 1990s the first-ever web page was created. Then in the early 2000s, the surge in broadband & wifi accessibility catapulted the practical use of the internet for research and work. Next, in 2010 the rise of smartphones and increase in thriving social media outlets made way for an extracurricular use case for the internet.**\n\nIf the last 30 to 40 years of the history of the internet has it right, every decade seems to bring about new advances in technology coupled with strong and deep-rooted community or social trends that when bred tend to create the next big advances in how we as humans interact online and use the internet as a whole.\n\nSo my question to you is, now that we are in the early stages of the 2020s, what is next? Have you thought of this or seen the writing on the walls? Well if you have not thought about this please read on as I try to explain the beginnings of the next new phase of the internet, also known as web3. \n\nTo understand web3, let’s start with how we got here and all of the events that occurred over the past 12 years in order to make the web3 revolution possible. \n\n**2008**\n\nOkay by this point unless you live under a rock you have heard of Bitcoin. You might not have any idea what it is or how it works, but you have most likely at least heard of it, so let’s start there.\n\n\\*If you already know all about Satoshi, Bitcoin, and crypto you can skip this section and start at the section titled 2014, but if not read on...\n\nBitcoin is a type of digital currency called cryptocurrency in which a record of transactions is kept on a decentralized digital ledger most commonly referred to as the blockchain, and new units of currency can be produced by solving computational mathematical puzzles. There are a finite amount of Bitcoin and the creator, ​​Satoshi Nakamoto, designed the digital currency so that only 21 million bitcoin will ever be in existence. Bitcoin also operates completely independent of any current central banking system. \n\nBitcoin was first mentioned by Satoshi in 2008 and has since grown to the most famous and widely used cryptocurrency in the world. Currently, one Bitcoin or BTC for short is worth over ​​$61,000 USD. While BTC is worth a lot today it is still considered a very volatile asset. For example at the beginning of 2017 1 BTC was worth about $1,000 and by the end of that same year, 1 BTC was worth over $20,000 USD and then by the end of 2018, the price crashed to $3,300. Since then the cryptocurrency has had several other pullbacks but ultimately has continued to climb.\n\nThis is pretty groundbreaking stuff. The Bitcoin Network and BTC were created on a completely different system than the traditional centralized banking system. If Satoshi tried to create this currency using the current system it would still be trying to make its way through all of the red tape, bureaucracy, and regulations. Secondly, since it is an entirely new system that is decentralized you can send money (BTC) almost instantaneously to anyone in the world as long as they have an internet connection. And you can do this without any third parties taking outrageous ‘transaction fees’ off the top. \n\nFor example, I can send $1,000 USD to someone in Africa who does not have a bank account almost instantaneously with very minimal transaction fees as long as they have an internet connection. That is pretty incredible! \n\n**What Exactly is Bitcoin?**\n\nBitcoin is a type of digital currency called a cryptocurrency. Well, you might be thinking, how can this be a currency? Doesn’t someone official have to ‘approve’ and validate this so-called currency first? A currency is simply a medium of exchange for goods or services. *Typically* it is validated by a central government as in the Euro or USD. However, as long as something is an accepted medium of exchange between the two exchanging parties it can be used as a currency.\n\nDigital Currencies are pretty self-explanatory but a little confusing as it is a relatively new concept. A digital currency is digital in nature and can only be accessed via computers, phones, the internet, or digital wallets, i.e. digital game currencies. \n\nThis differs from traditional fiat currencies, USD or EURO, as it is not issued and backed by a central government. It is important to note that while fiat currencies are backed by a government that essentially says XYZ currency has value because we say so, *so 90s mom of them*, these currencies are not backed by a commodity, i.e. gold. \n\nNow a Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that transacts on a decentralized system using cryptography. In general, people like to use the term ‘crypto’ for short. \n\nCryptography literally means, ‘secret writing,’ and it has been around for a very long time. In the most recent era, cryptography is actually used to send private information over the internet. Think about sending money online from your bank account to someone else’s bank account (i.e. Zelle), something most of us have done. Cryptography is what prevents hackers and other third parties from intercepting that money transfer and what makes the process secure.\n\nThere are now thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation. Some of the most notable are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, and Dogecoin. Each coin is different and has its unique qualities or reasons for use. Most cryptocurrencies operate on the blockchain, but they are not the only great use for the blockchain just the first example of practical use. \n\nBitcoin is important to understand because it was the very first real-world implementation of using the blockchain. \n\nOkay so now we know that we have cryptocurrencies and they operate on the blockchain, but how does this all work, and how does it play into web3? The answer to this question lies in diving further into what the blockchain is. \n\n**Enter the blockchain**\n\nThe blockchain is a specific type of database that is extremely secure and decentralized. It is a digital ledger system that distributes all transactions across all of the nodes, or computers around the world, that are a part of the database and it is also viewable to everyone.\n\nThere are many differences between how traditional databases function compared to the fundamental of the blockchain. Two main differences it is important to highlight are how data is stored and how it is processed. \n\nTraditional databases store data into complex tables. Large databases are essentially spreadsheets on steroids. But the blockchain stores data into groups commonly referred to as *blocks*. Once the storage capacity of a block is filled it is time-stamped and added in order to the block before it. This process creates the *chain* of information. Any new information that is added begins on the next block, hence the name *block-chain*.\n\nAlso, with a traditional database all the computers that make up the servers are housed under one facility or a few groups of facilities and one business or entity has full control (i.e. centralized), in the blockchain computers from around the world work together and the control over the information or database is decentralized, i.e. no one person has complete control and everyone has access.\n\nImagine that Google’s 2.5 million servers or computers that are housed in only a few facilities, 21 to be exact, around the globe are instead just 2.5 million computers monitored by 2.5 million people all around the world. That is essentially the decentralized concept of the blockchain.\n\nWe can have so many cryptocurrencies because blockchain technology is open source. This means that any developer can use the original code and build off of it. Allowing for a lot of diversity and innovation. So while The original Bitcoin Network uses blockchain technology only as a ledger for transactions, with a few tweaks the blockchain can be used as a secure record system for many different types of data points. It can be used for legal contracts, voting, and as the backbone for the web3 ecosystem.\n\n**2014**\n\n2014 and the rise of Ethereum, which is a decentralized ledger built on blockchain technology and founded by Vitalik Buterin, Anthony Di Iorio, Charles Hoskinson, Mihai Alisie & Amir Chetrit. These founders had the foresight to see what was being accomplished with the Bitcoin blockchain and had a different vision for the technology. They envisioned the blockchain being used for more than just cryptocurrencies. Although Ethereum does have a currency, Ether or ETH, the use cases for the Ethereum blockchain go far beyond just currency, unlike the original bitcoin network. \n\nEthereum offers the ability to create smart contracts as a method of exchange and decentralized applications. The network does this using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). \n\nSmart Contracts are a piece of code that runs on a blockchain such as Ethereum and serve as a digital contract between two or more individuals. These contracts are programmed based on a certain set of predetermined rules. When these rules are met the contract is automatically executed.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the blockchain-based software platform that Ethereum uses and it is written in a language called Solidity. Using EVM developers can create many things including decentralized apps.\n\nDecentralized Applications (dApps) are essentially web applications created on the blockchain. For the typical user, it might be hard to grasp the concept of dApps at first because the front-end interface looks pretty similar to your typical web application. The real difference is the backend and the plumbing of dApps. \n\nToday’s big web applications such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube access data to be displayed to the end-user via privately owned servers. In contrast, dApps use all of the nodes on the blockchain and their associated wallets to serve the end-user said information.  \n\ndApps have already started to revolutionize banking through decentralized finance (covered below). And they have the ability to scale and offer services to consumers and creators that are similar to that of Amazon and the Apple App store but without the involvement of those intermediaries (i.e. Amazon, Apple). Thus making everything entirely peer-to-peer.  \n\nSince the technology that Ethereum runs on is open source the opportunities for what can be created are endless. \n\n**2015 - 2017**\n\nThe next big crazes after Bitcoin, thanks to the Etherum network, were ICOs, DeFi, and NFTs.\n\nICOs or Initial Coin Offerings started making headlines in 2017. You can think of ICOs like the IPO version for the blockchain. Several new companies started popping up and instead of raising money for their projects via IPOs companies were creating their own tokens and offering those to investors in exchange for ETH to fund their business venture. The problem was that several of these companies weren’t real businesses at all and they were just trying to game the system and make a quick buck. It did not take long before the ICO bubble burst in late 2017.\n\nDeFi stands for decentralized finance. DeFi is the offering of financial products for buying, borrowing, storing, lending, etc. on a decentralized platform and with no central financial middlemen like in traditional banking. With the first use case of the blockchain being a form of digital currency (BTC) it makes logical sense that the rise of DeFi would follow not far behind. In early 2020 DeFi really started to make a name for itself and continues to grow today. The industry is currently valued at [$95 billion dollars](https://defipulse.com/).\n\nNFTs or non-fungible Tokens, built off the Etherium blockchain. First, let’s explain the difference between fungible and non-fungible as this is important to understanding the entire concept of NFTs.\n\nSomething that is fungible is something that is not unique and one of a kind but can be exchanged for something of similar value. A dollar is a fungible asset. If you gave me a dollar and I gave you a dollar back we each have the same amount of purchasing power, one dollar, but different dollars than what we started out with. \n\nSo an example of a fungible token would be a cryptocurrency like BTC or ETH. If you gave me 1 of your BTC for 1 of my BTC then we both still have 1 BTC (and we are rich, yay!) but it is technically a different one than we started out with. \n\nA Non-fungible token also called an NFT means that the asset is digitally unique and no two NFTs can be exactly the same. Every NFT has an owner and that owner can be publically verified on the blockchain that the NFT was created on. An example of a non-fungible asset would be art. Take Da Vinci’s *The Last Supper* for example. While many have replicated this work of art from their own viewpoints there is still only one original. \n\nSo a non-fungible token or NFT is ownership of a digital asset or a digital certificate of ownership of a physical or digital asset. You are the only one who owns or can claim your NFT and there is no other one of its kind in the world. \n\nMost, but not all, NFTs are created on the Ethereum network. This is because of the EVM and smart contract capabilities of Ethereum previously mentioned. \n\nNFTs really gained popularity first as collectibles and digital art. CryptoKitties, CryptoPunks, Beeple, Kings of Leon, and Jack Dorsey. These are some of the names you might see in the mainstream headlines next to NFTs. The most popular digital auction house for NFTs is [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). While these are some of the first and well known NFT cases there are so many more opportunities out there for NFTs within the web3 ecosystem. \n\nFor example, imagine if the deed to your house was digitized and made into an NFT using smart contracts. By doing this you could move the property deed onto the blockchain. You also get to create the rules that correspond to that NFT. Let’s say, for example, you put a lot of money into building your house, and after you sell the initial deed to another owner you want an additional 1% of every sale of that property you built, forever. This means every time anyone re-sells your house you will receive 1% of that transaction even if you weren’t directly involved for as long as people are buying and selling your house. With NFTs you can do this and this digital or smart contract is irrefutable, unchangeable, and public on the blockchain forever.\n\nCurrently, most NFTs are made for social or collectible reasons (art, gaming, social status) but the secure and irrefutable nature of NFTs makes it so that in the future things like voting, private records such as birth, and health records could all become NFTs.** \n **\n\n**2020**\n\nMake way for DAOs and autonomous agents. Although the first DAO technically launched in 2016 the concept didn’t really start making headlines until 2020.  I am not even going to try to describe DAOs in the great detail that Vitalik Buterin does [here](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/). But I will try to sum up some useful definitions below.\n\nThink of a typical company. In the simplest form, there are inventors, varying levels of employees based on a hierarchical system, and customers. Each class has its own set of legal and social rules they need to follow. In a Decentralized Organization, all of the people are collaborating with each other according to a specific protocol that lives on the blockchain. Everyone has the opportunity to be an investor, an employee, and a customer all at the same time.\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are organizations that live on the internet and operate via a set of predefined codes or automation. It can use humans to do the work that automation is not capable of and most importantly has a source of internal capital.\n\nThere are several different types of DAOs and DAOs can organize for any number of unified reasons. People can come together to form a DAO for a specific cause or purpose. They can also come together to form a DAO for social or community reasons. The rules for DAOs and their members can be changed based on the collective focus and agreement of the DAO.\n\nCurrently, there are several different types of DAOs. There are investor, protocol, project, curator, and community DAOs just to name a few. Kevin Nielsen does a great job of laying out the framework of the current DAO landscape in this [article](https://thedefiant.io/what-is-a-dao-mapping-out-the-ecosystem/).\n\nImagine that you want to pool together a like-minded group of people, have them invest their capital, knowledge, and talent as a collective into purchasing and managing a pro sports team. Well with DAOs this is possible, it is even on the brink of happening right now with the sports fan investor DAO, [Krause House](https://krausehouse.club/).\n\n**2020- 2021**\n\nEnter the next big trends in this space; social tokens and the metaverse. \n\nSocial Tokens can be seen as a form of cryptocurrency that is based around a community, brand, person, or interest and holds value to its members. This value can be social (members only) or monetary. What the tokens can be used for depends on the community and tokenomics for said community/social group.\n\nTokenomics is a combination of two words tokens and economics. So it is the economics of how tokens work, have value, and are distributed to token holders.\n\nThe Metaverse is a new type of virtual reality where people and communities can interact fully online through AI, VR, and augmented reality by using all the latest tech and gadgets. \n\nThis expands way beyond the typical vision of a hard-core gamer sitting in front of a 60 in. screen with a clunky headset on screaming out obscenities at their online opponents before relentlessly firing their remote control assault rifle. The metaverse of today would have a much more mainstream and practical use. It could include things like virtual boardrooms for work and virtual stores with virtual fitting rooms where you can virtually try on clothes. Bringing a lot of our daily lives, not just our social lives, online. \n\n**The next iteration of the internet**\n\nIf web 1.0 was the rise of the internet and web 2.0 was how we access and socialize on the internet (mobile and social media) then web 3.0 is the decentralization and new economy of the internet (blockchain, the creator economy, and community employment).\n\nWith web3 the big giants of the current social and online spaces will essentially be eliminated. Or they will at the very least need a complete restructuring. Web3 adds a totally new layer of piping to the way we access and interact with each other over the internet. The current status quo of data centers, servers, big corporations, and monarchical type decision-making will be replaced with blockchain technology, decentralization, community pooling, and collective rule. \n\nThe decentralization of this new ecosystem will make way for more than just DeFi. There will be decentralized content, decentralized entertainment, decentralized retail, decentralized marketing, and much more.\n\nImagine a new version of YouTube where the video creator creates a video, posts it online and the viewer who views the video can tip the creator directly through the platform or the creator can charge a fee to watch the video that gets paid by a consumer and placed directly in the creator’s wallet. There will be no need for YouTube and its big brother type regulation. \n\nWith artificial intelligence, decentralized networks, and the metaverse, this type of creator economy is where we are heading. This is web 3.0 and the possibilities are endless. \n\n*Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future? -BTTF*** \n **\n\nSources:\n\n* [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/cryptocurrency-4427699)\n* [The Ethereum Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)\n* [What is a DAO?

{"id": "aXV2QRhjA-z7WlmP7OBcn4Y8ZqlLTJeNdHeIVhoerWU", "title": "Philosophical investigation of the metaverse and NFTs /2", "body": "In the first post of this series I wrote about the philosopher Walter Benjamin (1892-1940) and his essay [The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction) (1935). There is another text I really find fascinating - but difficult. The text, [The Origin of German Tragic Drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_German_Tragic_Drama) (Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels), offers a weird reading experience. I got glimpses of understanding, of something which one could call “the truth” of that text, but only glimpses and there is no truth I can somehow appropriate. However, I don’t want to risk a thorough interpretation of the text, but I’d like to quote some passages which help us ask new questions about NFTs. \n\nOne of these passages uses the imagery of the mosaic: “Just as mosaics preserve their majesty despite their fragmentation into capricious particles, so philosophical contemplation is not lacking in momentum. Both are made up of the distinct and the disparate; and nothing could bear more powerful testimony to the transcendent force of the sacred image and the truth itself.” \n\nBenjamin himself was a collector of quotes and facts, for example about Paris in the nineteenth century, because maybe a city and the rapid changes there can only be read as a mosaic. \n\nMaybe NFTs are pieces of a mosaic, demonstrating something about the the changes we live through in this day and age. \n\n“The value of fragments of thought is all the greater the less direct their relationship to the underlying idea, and the brilliance of the representation depends as much on this value as the brilliance of the mosaic does on the quality of the glass paste”, Benjamin writes. The fragments constituted by NFTs demonstrate something about our epoch,the fact that there is no direct relationship to one underlying idea does not mean there is no meaning to be found here, even if this meaning is impossible to appropriate.

{"id": "cau5Wz82HWCluI8pK0TZLXGACmw9Q9rMZvR3S_YsHno", "title": "CrossFit's Web3 Killer", "body": "As I was finishing up a workout at my local box, I saw an old ad for the gym taped to the white board.\n\n“CrossFit is more than fitness. It’s a community.”\n\nNo arguments here. I firmly believe one of the reasons CrossFit came to thrive is community. The reason people pay a lot of money for CrossFit is community. The reason most people stay active members at their gyms is community.\n\nPeople want to feel a part of something.\n\nBut something very interesting happened during the pandemic. CrossFit’s founder, Greg Glassman, was [ousted](https://www.clubindustry.com/commercial-clubs/greg-glassman-sells-crossfit-inc-to-affiliate-owner-eric-roza) for making insensitive tweets about the George Floyd situation, and further allegations of sexism, racism and homophobia were disclosed.\n\nIn the various articles that reported this, Glassman was described as a co-founder and then sole owner of CrossFit. All major organizational decisions were ultimately signed off by one person. The CEO. Glassman.\n\nMany affiliates (gyms officially associated with CrossFit HQ) distanced themselves from the organization, removed the term “CrossFit” from their names, and began saying that their methodology was functional fitness. The underlying sentiment was that CrossFit the community was separate from HQ.\n\nThis change, which many reverted when Glassman stepped down, showed the ability for CrossFit to decentralize. The pandemic showed that affiliates have the ability to manage their communities online. The various programs offered by professional CrossFit athletes proved that you don’t even need to join an affiliate. These programs’ workouts are organized similarly to local gyms, and the online community can provide the same sense of belonging.\n\nThis is all amazing. Despite losing one of its strongest attributes with in-person community and relationships, most affiliates managed to stay afloat. Members didn’t cancel their memberships, they rented equipment to take home, and everyone rode out the Covid wave while it lasted.\n\nThe biggest issue with all of this? Ownership.\n\n\n---\n\nThe hardest thing when managing an online community is incentivizing its members to remain active. Many try do this through various channels. Zoom classes, swag drops, the occasional (but painfully awkward) meet and greets… They all get some initial participation going, but for most, the activity wains as new members’ initial enthusiasm drops.\n\nAlso, the lack of coordination from gyms at the top level was a concern. Many gyms remain (officially or unofficially) disaffiliated with CrossFit HQ and have decided to go in their own direction. This lack of coordination can lead to a poor end product, which ends up with people getting physically hurt. Five times CrossFit Games champion Mat Fraser brought [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVTLQx0HNYE) up on Joe Rogan’s podcast.\n\nI’ll spare you all from the crypto promo, but something made possible by crypto is a truly decentralized organizational structure. One that gives everyone the opportunity to own a stake, and participate within the organization at the speed they’d like to.\n\nThis structure could create CrossFit’s 3.0 dream or nightmare.\n\n1\\.0 was inception. 2.0 was the use of technology to track and scale the progress of CrossFit communities and its members.\n\n3\\.0 is something much more powerful.\n\n3\\.0 will be inspired by the Web3 revolution. It will incentivize community members through financial capital, and will build upon the social capital that CrossFit has already generated.\n\nI wrote above that online CrossFit at times was painful, but it doesn’t have to be. With more coordination, standardization of communication channels, and a hierarchy based on CrossFit-related competence, combined with participation and ownership, would create a real engine that redefines what it means to be a part of a fitness community.\n\nLet’s break down the four things (in my opinion) that are most pressing to build this type of engine.\n\n\n---\n\n**1. Ownership**\n\nIn order for someone to be an owner, they need to provide value to the organization. In order to receive ownership for providing value, there needs to be a treasury (sum of money) where collateral can be added capital can be distributed from.\n\nThe best way to organize this is through digital tokens. A group of early founders create a token pool and put up their own individual capital to receive portions of the pool. They then allocate certain percentages of the pool for future members to invest, earn through participation and they can also allocate tokens for other initiatives they find important. For example, scholarship funds or community programs.\n\nThis form of incentivisation creates financial reward and gain for members of the community as it grows, scales and increases in relevancy and mind share in the world.\n\nPeople like making money.\n\n**2. Social Capital**\n\nAs mentioned, one of CrossFit’s best attributes is its community. If the community structure and organization were to move online, there is still a real human element that can be leveraged.\n\nSay that members of this online community have engaged with each other for certain periods of time, and one travels to a part of the world where the other lives. They can meet up at the gym for a workout, have a coffee or a beer, anything.\n\nThe physical locations are already in place for this; there just needs to be better coordination and incentives to go out and interact within said locations. People already drop in to CrossFit gyms when they’re on the road (for outrageous fees may I add). This experience provides most a great workout, a greeting or two, but that’s really it.\n\nDoing this, however, through a format that is powered by an online community which you own a stake in will make the human experience more meaningful, memorable and worthwhile.\n\nI love dropping in to gyms, but imagine a world where your drop-in is actually a long awaited meet up? This is a better form of community.\n\n**3. Hierarchy & Governance**\n\nFounding members would need to have some form of credibility within CrossFit, or functional fitness in general. While wild west scenarios are fun, poor competence structures in this scenario would result in people getting physically hurt. Therefore, the founding team would need to create an onboarding process that determines a person’s competence level related to CrossFit. They would also need to create an onboarding process that enables aspiring contributors to work on the projects they want to.\n\n**Hierarchy**\n\nFor example, let’s say someone enters the community. They’ve purchased tokens and are now a member of the organization. Where do they stand in the hierarchy?\n\nThe organization creates an exam that members take to show their knowledge of CrossFit and/or functional fitness. Their score then determines where they stand in the competence hierarchy.\n\nLet’s say there are three levels to this. 3) Member 2) Athlete 1) Coach. People who join the community are explicitly told that coaches are those who provide fitness guidance, athletes can help with less pressing questions, and members are good to chat with.\n\nThis hierarchy doesn’t exclude people from participation in various projects, it rather establishes a group of people where community members can route their fitness specific questions.\n\n**Contributing**\n\nThe other side of this is the onboarding of members who want to contribute. This can be done fairly easily at the beginning. Community members are asked where they want to participate, they are encouraged to engage in that project’s communication channels and are awarded with tokens as they complete projects. If they were not previous token holders, they then become members of the organization and are assigned to the third level of the fitness competence hierarchy until passing the “exam” to move up.\n\n**Governance**\n\nThe two subjects discussed previously do not affect governance. Governance determines the direction of the organization, and there are many models that can be followed. To not dive down a technical rabbit hole, we’ll keep this explanation shorter.\n\nAny decision that affects the organization should be voted on by its members. Anyone who has ownership (owns tokens) in the organization can vote on proposals that would affect the future state of the organization.\n\nThis furthers the financial incentivisation that members have, and will likely keep them more active and invested in the organization’s future. It changes the game completely. HQ doesn’t tell you what to do. People submit proposals and members vote yes or no. If there are more yes votes than no, the proposal passes.\n\nA democratic fitness organization. Who would’ve thought?\n\nPS. There are many ways to determine the weight and value of someone’s vote. I would recommend googling *coin voting blockchain* and *quadratic voting blockchain* to understand this better.\n\n**4. Coordination**\n\nThe biggest hurdle that a prospective organization like this faces is coordination. Founding members will need to quickly establish the communication channels, member onboarding, the organization’s economics (tokenomics), and the governance structure.\n\nBy doing this, the organization will have a clear strategic narrative, new members won’t feel lost in a likely new world, and the community will be able to operate autonomously while maintaining its vision.\n\nIf these processes are quickly established, prior to scale, the end product of a CrossFit 3.0 will be far superior than its current state.\n\n\n---\n\nCrossFit has changed my life for the better, and I couldn’t agree more with its philosophy and approach to sport, health and wellness. However, with another economic revolution on the horizon, it’s important that organizations that heavily rely on community understand the power of Web3 and DAO organizational structures.\n\nReason being, the decentralization experiment for CrossFit has produced a lot of economic upside for HQ and the influential persons associated with it and the CrossFit Games. Again this wasn’t and isn’t a bad thing, but it’s important to understand as generational and economic circumstances transform, organizations must transform with them. Otherwise, they will become increasingly irrelevant and possibly fail.\n\nA truly decentralized CrossFit that gives community ownership and a voice is an interesting proposition.

It’s a community.”\n\nNo arguments here. I firmly believe one of the reasons CrossFit thrives today is its community. The reason people pay a lot of money for CrossFit is community. The reason most people stay active members at their gyms is community.\n\nPeople want to feel a part of something.\n\nBut something very interesting happened during the pandemic. CrossFit’s founder, Greg Glassman, was ousted for making insensitive tweets about the George Floyd situation, and further allegations of sexism, racism and homophobia were disclosed.\n\nIn the various articles that reported this, Glassman was described as a co-founder and then sole owner of CrossFit. All major organizational decisions were ultimately signed off by one person. The CEO. Glassman.\n\nMany affiliates (gyms officially associated with CrossFit HQ) distanced themselves from the organization, removed the term “CrossFit” from their names, and began saying that their methodology was functional fitness. The underlying sentiment was that CrossFit the community was separate from HQ.\n\nThis change, which many reverted when Glassman stepped down, showed the ability for CrossFit to decentralize. The pandemic showed that affiliates have the ability to manage their communities online. The various programs offered by professional CrossFit athletes proved that you don’t even need to join an affiliate. These programs’ workouts are organized similarly to local gyms, and the online community can provide the same sense of belonging.\n\nThis is all amazing. Despite losing one of its strongest attributes with in-person community and relationships, most affiliates managed to stay afloat. Members didn’t cancel their memberships, they rented equipment to take home, and everyone rode out the Covid wave while it lasted.\n\nThe biggest issue with all of this? Ownership.\n\n\n---\n\nThe hardest thing when managing an online community is incentivizing its members to remain active. Many try do this through various channels. Zoom classes, swag drops, the occasional (but painfully awkward) meet and greets… They all get some initial participation going, but for most, the activity wains as new members’ initial enthusiasm drops.\n\nAlso, the lack of coordination from gyms at the top level was a concern. Many gyms remain (officially or unofficially) disaffiliated with CrossFit HQ and have decided to go in their own direction. This lack of coordination can lead to a poor end product, which ends up with people getting physically hurt. Five times CrossFit Games champion Mat Fraser brought this up on Joe Rogan’s podcast.\n\nI’ll spare you all from the crypto promo, but something made possible by crypto is a truly decentralized organizational structure. One that gives everyone the opportunity to own a stake, and participate within the organization at the speed they’d like to.\n\nThis structure could create CrossFit’s 3.0 dream or nightmare. 1.0 was inception. 2.0 was the use of technology to track and scale the progress of CrossFit communities and its members.\n\n3\\.0 is something much more powerful.\n\n3\\.0 will be inspired by the Web3 revolution. It will incentivize community members through financial capital, and will build upon the social capital that CrossFit has already generated.\n\nI wrote above that online CrossFit at times was painful, but it doesn’t have to be. With more coordination, standardization of communication channels, and a hierarchy based on CrossFit-related competence, combined with participation and ownership, would create a real engine that redefines what it means to be a part of a fitness community.\n\nLet’s break down the four things (in my opinion) that are most pressing to build this type of engine.\n\n\n---\n\n**1. Ownership**\n\nIn order for someone to be an owner, they need to provide value to the organization. In order to receive ownership for providing value, there needs to be a treasury (sum of money) where collateral can be added capital can be distributed from. The best way to organize this is through digital tokens. A group of early founders create a token pool and put up their own individual capital to receive portions of the pool. They then allocate certain percentages of the pool for future members to invest, earn through participation and they can also allocate tokens for other initiatives they find important. For example, scholarship funds or community programs. This form of incentivisation creates financial reward and gain for members of the community as it grows, scales and increases in relevancy and mind share in the world. People like making money.\n\n**2. Social Capital**\n\nAs mentioned, one of CrossFit’s best attributes is its community. If the community structure and organization were to move online, there is still a real human element that can be leveraged. Say that members of this online community have engaged with each other for certain periods of time, and one travels to a part of the world where the other lives. They can meet up at the gym for a workout, have a coffee or a beer, anything. The physical locations are already in place for this; there just needs to be better coordination and incentives to go out and interact within said locations. People already drop in to CrossFit gyms when they’re on the road (for outrageous fees may I add). This experience provides most a great workout, a greeting or two, but that’s really it. Doing this, however, through a format that is powered by an online community which you own a stake in will make the human experience more meaningful, memorable and worthwhile. I love dropping in to gyms, but imagine a world where your drop-in is actually a long awaited meet up? This is a better form of community.\n\n**3. Hierarchy & Governance**\n\nFounding members would need to have some form of credibility within CrossFit, or functional fitness in general. While wild west scenarios are fun, poor competence structures in this scenario would result in people getting physically hurt. Therefore, the founding team would need to create an onboarding process that determines a person’s competence level related to CrossFit. They would also need to create an onboarding process that enables aspiring contributors to work on the projects they want to.\n\n**Hierarchy**\n\nFor example, let’s say someone enters the community. They’ve purchased tokens and are now a member of the organization. Where do they stand in the hierarchy? The organization creates an exam that members take to show their knowledge of CrossFit and/or functional fitness. Their score then determines where they stand in the competence hierarchy. Let’s say there are three levels to this. 3) Member 2) Athlete 1) Coach. People who join the community are explicitly told that coaches are those who provide fitness guidance, athletes can help with less pressing questions, and members are good to chat with. This hierarchy doesn’t exclude people from participation in various projects, it rather establishes a group of people where community members can route their fitness specific questions.\n\n**Contributing**\n\nThe other side of this is the onboarding of members who want to contribute. This can be done fairly easily at the beginning. Community members are asked where they want to participate, they are encouraged to engage in that project’s communication channels and are awarded with tokens as they complete projects. If they were not previous token holders, they then become members of the organization and are assigned to the third level of the fitness competence hierarchy until passing the “exam” to move up.\n\n**Governance**\n\nThe two subjects discussed previously do not affect governance. Governance determines the direction of the organization, and there are many models that can be followed. To not dive down a technical rabbit hole, we’ll keep this explanation shorter.\n\nAny decision that affects the organization should be voted on by its members. Anyone who has ownership (owns tokens) in the organization can vote on proposals that would affect the future state of the organization. This furthers the financial incentivisation that members have, and will likely keep them more active and invested in the organization’s future.\n\nIt changes the game completely. HQ doesn’t tell you what to do. People submit proposals and members vote yes or no. If there are more yes votes than no, the proposal passes.\n\nA democratic fitness organization. Who would’ve thought?\n\nPS. There are many ways to determine the weight and value of someone’s vote. I would recommend googling *coin voting blockchain* and *quadratic voting blockchain* to understand this better.\n\n**4. Coordination**\n\nThe biggest hurdle that a prospective organization like this faces is coordination. Founding members will need to quickly establish the communication channels, member onboarding, the organization’s economics (tokenomics), and the governance structure. By doing this, the organization will have a clear strategic narrative, new members won’t feel lost in a likely new world, and the community will be able to operate autonomously while maintaining its vision. If these processes are quickly established, prior to scale, the end product of a CrossFit 3.0 will be far superior than its current state.\n\n\n---\n\nCrossFit has changed my life for the better, and I couldn’t agree more with its philosophy and approach to sport, health and wellness. However, with another economic revolution on the horizon, it’s important that organizations that heavily rely on community understand the power of Web3 and DAO organizational structures.\n\nReason being, the decentralization experiment for CrossFit has produced a lot of economic upside for HQ and the influential persons associated with it and the CrossFit Games. Again this wasn’t and isn’t a bad thing, but it’s important to understand as generational and economic circumstances transform, organizations must transform with them. Otherwise, they will become increasingly irrelevant and possibly fail.\n\nA truly decentralized CrossFit that gives community ownership and a voice is an interesting proposition.

{"id": "DlzIUOIUZNT7SIx5xNq0aOQFHG5KWv5xkcLymXQtoeE", "title": "Vega Validator Progress Update 0.1", "body": "Hello wordl!\n\nIt’s about time we start regular updates on our validator operations.\n\nSince early August, we have been working on preparations to become one of the [Vega](https://vega.xyz/) Mainnet validators, and we would like to use this post to share insights of what is happening behind the scenes.\n\n## Wen Mainnet\n\nSince the start of August, we have all been working hard to launch the network. Vega is a bespoke blockchain, built specifically for trading. Part of Vega’s alpha is that it is able to optimise for computation, incentives, speed and decentralisation in a way which exchange software running on general purpose blockchains can’t.\n\nIn combination with the cross-chain architecture of Vega, this introduces some complexities that don’t exist with other chains. As a group, we are taking the necessary steps to ensure that we do not cut any corners, and preparing robust infrastructure capable of facilitating a smooth launch, and minimal rugs. \n\nAfter the validator set was [voted on](https://blog.vega.xyz/mainnet-validator-recommendations-and-governance-vote-4b5573630321) by the Vega V1 token holders, the validators took the initiative to open a private Discord server with all of the teams. This has been the main place of collaboration, along with weekly calls, GitHub and Notion. Together, we have coordinated the following:\n\n**August**\n\n* Validator set voted on by Vega V1 token holders\n* Validator Discord opened\n* Introductory call, how to install the basic Vega validator software\n* Validator teams begin architecture design\n* Validator teams install Vega software and test privately\n* Genesis file for private Testnet created using keys from each team\n* Private Testnet V1 started with 8 validators signing blocks\n* Data node software released to validator teams\n\n**September**\n\n* Ethereum smart contracts for private Testnet deployed\n* Private Testnet V2 started - with nearly all 13 validators participating\n* Bug fixes, key management feature requests from validator teams\n* Ethereum Event Forwarder released and installed by validators\n* Update to Vega core v0.44 - checkpoint functionality added, new config tree, clef added for Ethereum key management, bug fixes\n* Validator Notion created to assist with coordination\n\n**October**\n\n* Validator emergency response requirements discussed \n* New Testnet genesis file created, with all validator teams submitting pull requests containing their Vega, Tendermint and Ethereum keys\n* Private Testnet V3 started\n* Checkpoint test completed\n* Private Testnet V4 started\n\n## More than just another validator node\n\nOperating the Vega network requires more than a single application. Each validator consists of Tendermint, Vega core, Vega’s Data Node (for APIs), and an application that forwards events from Etheruem to the Vega network. There are additional applications required to ensure that key management is implemented in a secure manner (a post will follow on this later).\n\n![Cosmos validator teams starting on Vega](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aN4y9vYlDXESCEDzzaMvz.png?height=450&width=800)\n\nEach validator team must decide how they wish to configure their own hardware, and the security precautions they deem necessary to put in place. For example, our consensus keys are isolated such that even the Nala team can’t access them once the service has been initialized (though we can restore them blind in the event of a failure). We will share more information about the architectural decisions we have made in another post.\n\nIt has taken a substantial amount of time to ensure that our systems are architected correctly, as well as to test and iterate on, but we’re now in a position where we can confidently support the launch of a network very soon. The Vega team, especially @bill0 (Discord pseudonym) and Jeremy, have been extremely helpful with  our questions and displayed a willingness to implement new features when we have requested them. \n\nRemember we’re not getting paid zilch until this network is up, and we’ve had multiple contributors working full time on it for nearly three months, helping as much as we can with the creation of the network. We’re excited for Vega to launch as soon as it is ready to do so, and the Nala team will be available around the clock to ensure that it happens in an efficient manner.\n\n## R&D\n\nVega’s choice of including both industrial validator teams/companies and community initiatives has paid off. Each validator has contributed uniquely to the development of software and social processes to support this complex blockchain. As the Vega community, you can look forward to each team presenting their own research.\n\n## Get involved\n\nAs a community validator, we are grateful for the opportunity to develop our best practices alongside the veterans of the industry. We can’t wait to begin sharing our methods with you all and helping you run your own validators. \n\nIn the mean time, you can find us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/PurrNala) or [discord](https://discord.gg/QnxH6H7n).

{"id": "I2qgn-17d5Uy4s4aLfP0AZc6JyDcFoHOxTHelthR96g", "title": "CrossFit's Web3 Killer", "body": "As I was finishing up a workout at my local box, I saw an old ad for the gym taped to the white board.\n\n“CrossFit is more than fitness. It’s a community.”\n\nNo arguments here. I firmly believe one of the reasons CrossFit thrives today is its community. The reason people pay a lot of money for CrossFit is community. The reason most people stay active members at their gyms is community. People want to feel a part of something.\n\nBut something very interesting happened during the pandemic. CrossFit’s founder, Greg Glassman, was ousted for making insensitive tweets about the George Floyd situation, and further allegations of sexism, racism and homophobia were disclosed. In the various articles that reported this, Glassman was described as a co-founder and then sole owner of CrossFit. All major organizational decisions were ultimately signed off by one person. The CEO. Glassman.\n\nMany affiliates (gyms officially associated with CrossFit HQ) distanced themselves from the organization, removed the term “CrossFit” from their names, and began saying that their methodology was functional fitness. The underlying sentiment was that CrossFit the community was separate from HQ.\n\nThis change, which many reverted when Glassman stepped down, showed the ability for CrossFit to decentralize. The pandemic showed that affiliates have the ability to manage their communities online. The various programs offered by professional CrossFit athletes proved that you don’t even need to join an affiliate. These programs’ workouts are organized similarly to local gyms, and the online community can provide the same sense of belonging.\n\nThis is all amazing. Despite losing one of its strongest attributes with in-person community and relationships, most affiliates managed to stay afloat. Members didn’t cancel their memberships, they rented equipment to take home, and everyone rode out the Covid wave while it lasted.\n\nThe biggest issue with all of this? Ownership.\n\n\n---\n\nThe hardest thing when managing an online community is incentivizing its members to remain active. Many try do this through various channels. Zoom classes, swag drops, the occasional (but painfully awkward) meet and greets… They all get some initial participation going, but for most, the activity wains as new members’ initial enthusiasm drops.\n\nAlso, the lack of coordination from gyms at the top level was a concern. Many gyms remain (officially or unofficially) disaffiliated with CrossFit HQ and have decided to go in their own direction. This lack of coordination can lead to a poor end product, which ends up with people getting physically hurt. Five times CrossFit Games champion Mat Fraser brought this up on Joe Rogan’s podcast.\n\nI’ll spare you all from the crypto promo, but something made possible by crypto is a truly decentralized organizational structure. One that gives everyone the opportunity to own a stake, and participate within the organization at the speed they’d like to.\n\nThis structure could create CrossFit’s 3.0 dream or nightmare. 1.0 was inception. 2.0 was the use of technology to track and scale the progress of CrossFit communities and its members.\n\n3\\.0 is something much more powerful.\n\n3\\.0 will be inspired by the Web3 revolution. It will incentivize community members through financial capital, and will build upon the social capital that CrossFit has already generated.\n\nI wrote above that online CrossFit at times was painful, but it doesn’t have to be. With more coordination, standardization of communication channels, and a hierarchy based on CrossFit-related competence, combined with participation and ownership, would create a real engine that redefines what it means to be a part of a fitness community.\n\nLet’s break down the four things (in my opinion) that are most pressing to build this type of engine.\n\n\n---\n\n**1. Ownership**\n\nIn order for someone to be an owner, they need to provide value to the organization. In order to receive ownership for providing value, there needs to be a treasury (sum of money) where collateral can be added capital can be distributed from. The best way to organize this is through digital tokens. A group of early founders create a token pool and put up their own individual capital to receive portions of the pool. They then allocate certain percentages of the pool for future members to invest, earn through participation and they can also allocate tokens for other initiatives they find important. For example, scholarship funds or community programs. This form of incentivisation creates financial reward and gain for members of the community as it grows, scales and increases in relevancy and mind share in the world. People like making money.\n\n**2. Social Capital**\n\nAs mentioned, one of CrossFit’s best attributes is its community. If the community structure and organization were to move online, there is still a real human element that can be leveraged. Say that members of this online community have engaged with each other for certain periods of time, and one travels to a part of the world where the other lives. They can meet up at the gym for a workout, have a coffee or a beer, anything. The physical locations are already in place for this; there just needs to be better coordination and incentives to go out and interact within said locations. People already drop in to CrossFit gyms when they’re on the road (for outrageous fees may I add). This experience provides most a great workout, a greeting or two, but that’s really it. Doing this, however, through a format that is powered by an online community which you own a stake in will make the human experience more meaningful, memorable and worthwhile. I love dropping in to gyms, but imagine a world where your drop-in is actually a long awaited meet up? This is a better form of community.\n\n**3. Hierarchy & Governance**\n\nFounding members would need to have some form of credibility within CrossFit, or functional fitness in general. While wild west scenarios are fun, poor competence structures in this scenario would result in people getting physically hurt. Therefore, the founding team would need to create an onboarding process that determines a person’s competence level related to CrossFit. They would also need to create an onboarding process that enables aspiring contributors to work on the projects they want to.\n\n**Hierarchy**\n\nFor example, let’s say someone enters the community. They’ve purchased tokens and are now a member of the organization. Where do they stand in the hierarchy? The organization creates an exam that members take to show their knowledge of CrossFit and/or functional fitness. Their score then determines where they stand in the competence hierarchy. Let’s say there are three levels to this. 3) Member 2) Athlete 1) Coach. People who join the community are explicitly told that coaches are those who provide fitness guidance, athletes can help with less pressing questions, and members are good to chat with. This hierarchy doesn’t exclude people from participation in various projects, it rather establishes a group of people where community members can route their fitness specific questions.\n\n**Contributing**\n\nThe other side of this is the onboarding of members who want to contribute. This can be done fairly easily at the beginning. Community members are asked where they want to participate, they are encouraged to engage in that project’s communication channels and are awarded with tokens as they complete projects. If they were not previous token holders, they then become members of the organization and are assigned to the third level of the fitness competence hierarchy until passing the “exam” to move up.\n\n**Governance**\n\nThe two subjects discussed previously do not affect governance. Governance determines the direction of the organization, and there are many models that can be followed. To not dive down a technical rabbit hole, we’ll keep this explanation shorter.\n\nAny decision that affects the organization should be voted on by its members. Anyone who has ownership (owns tokens) in the organization can vote on proposals that would affect the future state of the organization. This furthers the financial incentivisation that members have, and will likely keep them more active and invested in the organization’s future.\n\nIt changes the game completely. HQ doesn’t tell you what to do. People submit proposals and members vote yes or no. If there are more yes votes than no, the proposal passes.\n\nA democratic fitness organization. Who would’ve thought?\n\nPS. There are many ways to determine the weight and value of someone’s vote. I would recommend googling *coin voting blockchain* and *quadratic voting blockchain* to understand this better.\n\n**4. Coordination**\n\nThe biggest hurdle that a prospective organization like this faces is coordination. Founding members will need to quickly establish the communication channels, member onboarding, the organization’s economics (tokenomics), and the governance structure. By doing this, the organization will have a clear strategic narrative, new members won’t feel lost in a likely new world, and the community will be able to operate autonomously while maintaining its vision. If these processes are quickly established, prior to scale, the end product of a CrossFit 3.0 will be far superior than its current state.\n\n\n---\n\nCrossFit has changed my life for the better, and I couldn’t agree more with its philosophy and approach to sport, health and wellness. However, with another economic revolution on the horizon, it’s important that organizations that heavily rely on community understand the power of Web3 and DAO organizational structures.\n\nReason being, the decentralization experiment for CrossFit has produced a lot of economic upside for HQ and the influential persons associated with it and the CrossFit Games. Again this wasn’t and isn’t a bad thing, but it’s important to understand as generational and economic circumstances transform, organizations must transform with them. Otherwise, they will become increasingly irrelevant and possibly fail.\n\nA truly decentralized CrossFit that gives community ownership and a voice is an interesting proposition. One I believe would succeed. The economic distribution will change from few to all, and the social community will change from local to global.", "timestamp": 1635527595, "digest": "v2ZEBQAQTPYdLPtnxx2g7r4kYW8BRfrfCn_DsElRcbY", "contributor": "0xa32D089F144e613106072fE2Ec4FF2ff95b7606D"}

Especially in crypto.\n\nSexy marketing can get a token price to pump off forking a protocol onto a new network. Impact is designing, building, and battle testing a core primitive for the next generation of the Internet. That’s what the Gnosis team have done with the Gnosis Safe, which is the [premier multi-sig wallet for individuals and DAOs to hold billions of dollars of value](https://dune.xyz/tschubotz/gnosis-safe_2). They just crossed $100B secured…and that doesn’t even include NFT value. 👀\n\nI could go on and on about how they transitioned the Gnosis Safe into a [platform where apps can be listed](https://docs.gnosis-safe.io/docs/sdks_safe_apps/), have leading projects like [Coinshift](https://coinshift.xyz/) and Parcel building alternative UIs on top, or launching [Zodiac, the lego blocks of DAOs](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/OuhG5s2X5uSVBx1EK4tKPhnUc91Wh9YM0fwSnC8UNcg), for all your governance and operational needs. Just incredible execution with much less of the hype than other projects. 👏👏👏 For the trading enthusiasts, check out [Cowswap](https://cowswap.exchange/) as well, which solves the MEV problem with an elegant “Coincidences of Wants” design that I think will be used more and more for tokens and NFT marketplaces.

NFT minting, distribution, auctions, and airdrops will be built into **every creator tool** over the next 5 years. Images, video, audio, social, 3d, gaming, virtual world (especially). **ALL OF IT**.\n\nYou’ll see a slow trickle of news from tik tok/photoshop/sound cloud/twitter/etc adopting NFT mint and verification over the coming years. This is inevitable (shoutout to Thanos). For the investing-minded folks out there, bet on the infrastructure (picks and shovels) for this space in every ecosystem (Eth, Solana, Cosmos, etc). It won’t be winner-take-all (Peter Thiel’s tech monopolies are less of a thing in web3) but there will be the tier 1 players. Decentralized storage (see below), data, analytics, verification, pricing, etc. [Alchemy being one recent bet](https://twitter.com/AlchemyPlatform/status/1453709340938944513). There will be entire VC funds raised on this thesis, and it’s a good bet from my view.\n\n\n---\n\n[https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-orbit-filecoin-year-one-in-review/](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-orbit-filecoin-year-one-in-review/)\n\n**🤔   Why it Matters**\n\nBitcoin : Money :: Filecoin : NFTs\n\nFilecoin launched a year ago on October 15th 2020 and recently held its [Filecoin Orbit](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-orbit-filecoin-year-one-in-review/) event to celebrate and reflect on its first year of operation. The growth metrics speak for themselves:\n\n* 12 EiB of total network storage power\n* 3,362 Filecoin storage providers\n* 10,000+ developers participating at hackathons\n\nBut why does this matter?\n\nIn an alternative universe, internet currency and DeFi originated in a Facebook / Google / Stripe corporate-owned walled garden. 😥 Frankly, it would have been less confusing and faster to market, but that never happened because humans need trust and there was no internet trust layer. You had to have the messiness and computational expense of Proof of Work to create Bitcoin, then Ethereum, then DeFi/NFTs and the goodness we’re lucky to have today. You needed those fundamental security guarantees to get this off the ground, even if the end consumer doesn’t care much about them today. They also don’t care about `https` or `smtp` but needed them to have amazing web apps.\n\nWell Filecoin is Bitcoin for NFTs (particularly media) and Web3 (user-owned data). You need an unstoppable, permissionless layer as a foundation to build all the great use cases on top. There’s an alternative universe where all this activity stays on AWS ([like many NFTs today](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/23/its-an-nft-boom-do-you-know-where-your-digital-art-lives/)) but that’s not likely to happen. Humans need that trust layer. So that’s why I’m so bullish on Filecoin over a 10 year horizon.

Together, we have coordinated the following:\n\n**August**\n\n* Validator set voted on by Vega V1 token holders\n* Validator Discord opened\n* Introductory call, how to install the basic Vega validator software\n* Validator teams begin architecture design\n* Validator teams install Vega software and test privately\n* Genesis file for private Testnet created using keys from each team\n* Private Testnet V1 started with 8 validators signing blocks\n* Data node software released to validator teams\n\n**September**\n\n* Ethereum smart contracts for private Testnet deployed\n* Private Testnet V2 started - with nearly all 13 validators participating\n* Bug fixes, key management feature requests from validator teams\n* Ethereum Event Forwarder released and installed by validators\n* Update to Vega core v0.44 - checkpoint functionality added, new config tree, clef added for Ethereum key management, bug fixes\n* Validator Notion created to assist with coordination\n\n**October**\n\n* Validator emergency response requirements discussed \n* New Testnet genesis file created, with all validator teams submitting pull requests containing their Vega, Tendermint and Ethereum keys\n* Private Testnet V3 started\n* Checkpoint test completed\n* Private Testnet V4 started\n\n## More than just another validator node\n\nOperating the Vega network requires more than a single application. Each validator consists of Tendermint, Vega core, Vega’s Data Node (for APIs), and an application that forwards events from Etheruem to the Vega network. There are additional applications required to ensure that key management is implemented in a secure manner (a post will follow on this later).\n\n![Cosmos validator teams starting on Vega](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aN4y9vYlDXESCEDzzaMvz.png?height=450&width=800)\n\nEach validator team must decide how they wish to configure their own hardware, and the security precautions they deem necessary to put in place. For example, our consensus keys are isolated such that even the Nala team can’t access them once the service has been initialized (though we can restore them blind in the event of a failure). We will share more information about the architectural decisions we have made in another post.\n\nIt has taken a substantial amount of time to ensure that our systems are architected correctly, as well as to test and iterate on, but we’re now in a position where we can confidently support the launch of a network very soon. The Vega team, especially @bill0 (Discord pseudonym) and Jeremy, have been extremely helpful with  our questions and displayed a willingness to implement new features when we have requested them. \n\nRemember we’re not getting paid zilch until this network is up, and we’ve had multiple contributors working full time on it for nearly three months, helping as much as we can with the creation of the network. We’re excited for Vega to launch as soon as it is ready to do so, and the Nala team will be available around the clock to ensure that it happens in an efficient manner.\n\n## R&D\n\nVega’s choice of including both industrial validator teams/companies and community initiatives has paid off. Each validator has contributed uniquely to the development of software and social processes to support this complex blockchain. As the Vega community, you can look forward to each team presenting their own research.\n\n## Get involved\n\nAs a community validator, we are grateful for the opportunity to develop our best practices alongside the veterans of the industry. We can’t wait to begin sharing our methods with you all and helping you run your own validators. \n\nIn the mean time, you can find us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/PurrNala) or [discord](https://discord.gg/QnxH6H7n). If you’d like to be part of starting this network drop a message and we’ll find a place for you ✨\n\n\\~Nala DAO", "timestamp": 1635526208, "digest": "WkDLYNLgw5xxQa3UJXJyxBtybBmIUzSa_SRLZiXiniw", "contributor": "0xd05883061A06048fB150904A93bbDf25FEBEeb55"}

It’s a community.”\n\nNo arguments here. I firmly believe one of the reasons CrossFit came to thrive is community. The reason people pay a lot of money for CrossFit is community. The reason most people stay active members at their gyms is community. People want to feel a part of something.\n\nBut something very interesting happened during the pandemic. CrossFit’s founder, Greg Glassman, was ousted for making insensitive tweets about the George Floyd situation, and further allegations of sexism, racism and homophobia were disclosed. In the various articles that reported this, Glassman was described as a co-founder and then sole owner of CrossFit. All major organizational decisions were ultimately signed off by one person. The CEO. Glassman.\n\n Many affiliates (gyms officially associated with CrossFit HQ) distanced themselves from the organization, removed the term “CrossFit” from their names, and began saying that their methodology was functional fitness. The underlying sentiment was that CrossFit the community was separate from HQ.\n\nThis change, which many reverted when Glassman stepped down, showed the ability for CrossFit to decentralize. The pandemic showed that affiliates have the ability to manage their communities online. The various programs offered by professional CrossFit athletes proved that you don’t even need to join an affiliate. These programs’ workouts are organized similarly to local gyms, and the online community can provide the same sense of belonging.\n\nThis is all amazing. Despite losing one of its strongest attributes with in-person community and relationships, most affiliates managed to stay afloat. Members didn’t cancel their memberships, they rented equipment to take home, and everyone rode out the Covid wave while it lasted.\n\nThe biggest issue with all of this? Ownership.\n\n\n---\n\nThe hardest thing when managing an online community is incentivizing its members to remain active. Many try do this through various channels. Zoom classes, swag drops, the occasional (but painfully awkward) meet and greets… They all get some initial participation going, but for most, the activity wains as new members’ initial enthusiasm drops.\n\nAlso, the lack of coordination from gyms at the top level was a concern. Many gyms remain (officially or unofficially) disaffiliated with CrossFit HQ and have decided to go in their own direction. This lack of coordination can lead to a poor end product, which ends up with people getting physically hurt. Five times CrossFit Games champion Mat Fraser brought this up on Joe Rogan’s podcast.\n\nI’ll spare you all from the crypto promo, but something made possible by crypto is a truly decentralized organizational structure. One that gives everyone the opportunity to own a stake, and participate within the organization at the speed they’d like to.\n\nThis structure could create CrossFit’s 3.0 dream or nightmare. 1.0 was inception. 2.0 was the use of technology to track and scale the progress of CrossFit communities and its members.\n\n3\\.0 is something much more powerful.\n\n3\\.0 will be inspired by the Web3 revolution. It will incentivize community members through financial capital, and will build upon the social capital that CrossFit has already generated.\n\nI wrote above that online CrossFit at times was painful, but it doesn’t have to be. With more coordination, standardization of communication channels, and a hierarchy based on CrossFit-related competence, combined with participation and ownership, would create a real engine that redefines what it means to be a part of a fitness community.\n\nLet’s break down the four things (in my opinion) that are most pressing to build this type of engine.\n\n**1. Ownership**\n\nIn order for someone to be an owner, they need to provide value to the organization. In order to receive ownership for providing value, there needs to be a treasury (sum of money) where collateral can be added capital can be distributed from. The best way to organize this is through digital tokens. A group of early founders create a token pool and put up their own individual capital to receive portions of the pool. They then allocate certain percentages of the pool for future members to invest, earn through participation and they can also allocate tokens for other initiatives they find important. For example, scholarship funds or community programs. This form of incentivisation creates financial reward and gain for members of the community as it grows, scales and increases in relevancy and mind share in the world. People like making money.\n\n**2. Social Capital**\n\nAs mentioned, one of CrossFit’s best attributes is its community. If the community structure and organization were to move online, there is still a real human element that can be leveraged. Say that members of this online community have engaged with each other for certain periods of time, and one travels to a part of the world where the other lives. They can meet up at the gym for a workout, have a coffee or a beer, anything. The physical locations are already in place for this; there just needs to be better coordination and incentives to go out and interact within said locations. People already drop in to CrossFit gyms when they’re on the road (for outrageous fees may I add). This experience provides most a great workout, a greeting or two, but that’s really it. Doing this, however, through a format that is powered by an online community which you own a stake in will make the human experience more meaningful, memorable and worthwhile. I love dropping in to gyms, but imagine a world where your drop-in is actually a long awaited meet up? This is a better form of community.\n\n**3. Hierarchy & Governance** \n\nFounding members would need to have some form of credibility within CrossFit, or functional fitness in general. While wild west scenarios are fun, poor competence structures in this scenario would result in people getting physically hurt. Therefore, the founding team would need to create an onboarding process that determines a person’s competence level related to CrossFit. They would also need to create an onboarding process that enables aspiring contributors to work on the projects they want to. \n\n**Hierarchy**\n\nFor example, let’s say someone enters the community. They’ve purchased tokens and are now a member of the organization. Where do they stand in the hierarchy? The organization creates an exam that members take to show their knowledge of CrossFit and/or functional fitness. Their score then determines where they stand in the competence hierarchy. Let’s say there are three levels to this. 3) Member 2) Athlete 1) Coach. People who join the community are explicitly told that coaches are those who provide fitness guidance, athletes can help with less pressing questions, and members are good to chat with. This hierarchy doesn’t exclude people from participation in various projects, it rather establishes a group of people where community members can route their fitness specific questions.\n\n**Contributing**\n\nThe other side of this is the onboarding of members who want to contribute. This can be done fairly easily at the beginning. Community members are asked where they want to participate, they are encouraged to engage in that project’s communication channels and are awarded with tokens as they complete projects. If they were not previous token holders, they then become members of the organization and are assigned to the third level of the fitness competence hierarchy until passing the “exam” to move up. \n\n**Governance**\n\nThe two subjects discussed previously do not affect governance. Governance determines the direction of the organization, and there are many models that can be followed. To not dive down a technical rabbit hole, we’ll keep this explanation shorter.\n\nAny decision that affects the organization should be voted on by its members. Anyone who has ownership (owns tokens) in the organization can vote on proposals that would affect the future state of the organization. This furthers the financial incentivisation that members have, and will likely keep them more active and invested in the organization’s future.\n\nIt changes the game completely. HQ doesn’t tell you what to do. People submit proposals and members vote yes or no. If there are more yes votes than no, the proposal passes.\n\nA democratic fitness organization. Who would’ve thought?\n\nPS. There are many ways to determine the weight and value of someone’s vote. I would recommend googling coin voting blockchain and quadratic voting blockchain to understand this better.\n\n**4. Coordination**\n\nThe biggest hurdle that a prospective organization like this faces is coordination. Founding members will need to quickly establish the communication channels, member onboarding, the organization’s economics (tokenomics), and the governance structure. By doing this, the organization will have a clear strategic narrative, new members won’t feel lost in a likely new world, and the community will be able to operate autonomously while maintaining its vision. If these processes are quickly established, prior to scale, the end product of a CrossFit 3.0 will be far superior than its current state.\n\n\n---\n\nCrossFit has changed my life for the better, and I couldn’t agree more with its philosophy and approach to sport, health and wellness. However, with another economic revolution on the horizon, it’s important that organizations that heavily rely on community understand the power of Web3 and DAO organizational structures.\n\nReason being, the decentralization experiment for CrossFit has produced a lot of economic upside for HQ and the influential persons associated with it and the CrossFit Games. Again this wasn’t and isn’t a bad thing, but it’s important to understand as generational and economic circumstances transform, organizations must transform with them. Otherwise, they will become increasingly irrelevant and possibly fail.\n\nA truly decentralized CrossFit that gives community ownership and a voice is an interesting proposition. One I believe would succeed. The economic distribution will change from few to all, and the social community will change from local to global.", "timestamp": 1635526528, "digest": "v2ZEBQAQTPYdLPtnxx2g7r4kYW8BRfrfCn_DsElRcbY", "contributor": "0xa32D089F144e613106072fE2Ec4FF2ff95b7606D"}

HQ doesn’t tell you what to do. People submit proposals and members vote yes or no. If there are more yes votes than no, the proposal passes.\n\nA democratic fitness organization. Who would’ve thought?\n\nPS. There are many ways to determine the weight and value of someone’s vote. I would recommend googling *coin voting blockchain* and *quadratic voting blockchain* to understand this better.\n\n**4. Coordination**\n\nThe biggest hurdle that a prospective organization like this faces is coordination. Founding members will need to quickly establish the communication channels, member onboarding, the organization’s economics (tokenomics), and the governance structure.\n\nBy doing this, the organization will have a clear strategic narrative, new members won’t feel lost in a likely new world, and the community will be able to operate autonomously while maintaining its vision.\n\nIf these processes are quickly established, prior to scale, the end product of a CrossFit 3.0 will be far superior than its current state.\n\n\n---\n\nCrossFit has changed my life for the better, and I couldn’t agree more with its philosophy and approach to sport, health and wellness. However, with another economic revolution on the horizon, it’s important that organizations that heavily rely on community understand the power of Web3 and DAO organizational structures.\n\nReason being, the decentralization experiment for CrossFit has produced a lot of economic upside for HQ and the influential persons associated with it and the CrossFit Games. Again this wasn’t and isn’t a bad thing, but it’s important to understand as generational and economic circumstances transform, organizations must transform with them. Otherwise, they will become increasingly irrelevant and possibly fail.\n\nA truly decentralized CrossFit that gives community ownership and a voice is an interesting proposition. One I believe would succeed. The economic distribution will change from few to all, and the social community will change from local to global.", "timestamp": 1635527981, "digest": "v2ZEBQAQTPYdLPtnxx2g7r4kYW8BRfrfCn_DsElRcbY", "contributor": "0xa32D089F144e613106072fE2Ec4FF2ff95b7606D"}

{"id": "dkEzmyoqCtUchKD-IaCLYOsqNnNsaqav0goPVM07pLI", "title": "Welcome to the Metaverse", "body": "Wait what? The metaverse is a virtual-reality space where users can interact in a computer-generated environment. Most importantly, this is the new frontier where a new [direct-to-avatar business model](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2020/08/09/is-direct-to-avatar-the-next-direct-to-consumer/#58f6186c102a) is growing.\n\nHow tempting indeed to give up on the real world, where environment is flailing, and life full of pandemics and real-life confrontations. Everything looks new and shiny in the metaverse. You can build from scratch, and yet not be afraid to lose, as in the end you’ll have infinite lives to live.\n\nAlbeit sounding like the trailer to Total Recall, Facebook was the latest one to embrace it fully, even changing its name to Meta, in order to achieve a renaissance of sort. Doing so, it leaves behind the sordid stories of breach of privacy, debilitating content for the younger audience, and online bullying. Not that it doesn’t exist in the metaverse, but everything is more seamless when everyone is presumably anon and the environment looks new.\n\nWhat is at stake here? Short answer is “a lot of money”. Digital contents command $300BN revenues, and are estimated to grow to $400BN by 2025. More importantly, the community-driven approach of gaming drives a high velocity adoption, and therefore a lot of Xs in value in a short timeframe. As an example, NFT sales punched $9BN since last summer.\n\nMake no mistake, Facebook is merely hopping on a trend that really started with video games. Virtual gamification is actually eating the world, but who should be holding the keys to the metaverse? There is of course the sempiternal debate about whether a centralized or a decentralized player would be more eligible. The latter is actually the most tempting craze of the moment with its permissionless construct, which could lead the path toward a more unbiased environment.\n\nCrypto and its NFT derivatives (aka [Liquid IP](https://blog.coinfund.io/all-digital-content-is-going-on-chain-ae26a7071657)) provide the ideal infrastructure for enabling digital transactions, and building a network of mutual dependence. One crucial question remains though, does permissionless mean that everything goes? And if not, who decides? The initiatives of DAOs and social tokens provide the premise of such decision networks where consensus is formed, even though they remain heavily influenced by benevolent guides.\n\nReality is that the crypto-driven virtual world unlocks new possibilities, a play-to-earn model such as the one experienced by Axie Infinity whose total revenues are close to $1BN after launching mid-year. Users earn marketable rewards the more they play. Some gamers spend countless hours harvesting artefacts that they then sold to gamers whose time value is higher. In fact, this game arbitrages the spread in time value, between the US (median wage/hour $20) and the Philippines ($5.73).\n\nPowerful interests are at play to exploit the metaverse. How mutually beneficial this would really be is still to be decided.", "timestamp": 1635528505, "digest": "PEkRWQ1RXDgoLYrOTc2XfEw5FXEBJXgE2QragyN26tI", "contributor": "0xa1e8fC5d9D3499F87eaA9fA47651c3B04182aC5f"}

There is another text I really find fascinating - but difficult. The text, [The Origin of German Tragic Drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_German_Tragic_Drama) (Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels), offers a weird reading experience. I got glimpses of understanding, of something which one could call “the truth” of that text, but only glimpses and there is no truth I can somehow appropriate. However, I don’t want to risk a thorough interpretation of the text, but I’d like to quote some passages which help us ask new questions about NFTs.\n\nOne of these passages uses the imagery of the mosaic: “Just as mosaics preserve their majesty despite their fragmentation into capricious particles, so philosophical contemplation is not lacking in momentum. Both are made up of the distinct and the disparate; and nothing could bear more powerful testimony to the transcendent force of the sacred image and the truth itself.”\n\nBenjamin himself was a collector of quotes and facts, for example about Paris in the nineteenth century, because maybe a city and the rapid changes there can only be read as a mosaic.\n\nMaybe NFTs are pieces of a mosaic, demonstrating something about the the changes we live through in this day and age.\n\n“The value of fragments of thought is all the greater the less direct their relationship to the underlying idea, and the brilliance of the representation depends as much on this value as the brilliance of the mosaic does on the quality of the glass paste”, Benjamin writes. The fragments constituted by NFTs demonstrate something about our epoch,the fact that there is no direct relationship to one underlying idea does not mean there is no meaning to be found here, even if this meaning is impossible to appropriate.", "timestamp": 1635533033, "digest": "rvZwE-xA3QoxCEUfnk0RArBx00ThO2_1NA7xEr0IodY", "contributor": "0xD1f5a5B13B5903eE22e5aB2f0AfC00f9Cd7CB65e"}

Together, we have coordinated the following:\n\n**August**\n\n* Validator set voted on by Vega V1 token holders\n* Validator Discord opened\n* Introductory call, how to install the basic Vega validator software\n* Validator teams begin architecture design\n* Validator teams install Vega software and test privately\n* Genesis file for private Testnet created using keys from each team\n* Private Testnet V1 started with 8 validators signing blocks\n* Data node software released to validator teams\n\n**September**\n\n* Ethereum smart contracts for private Testnet deployed\n* Private Testnet V2 started - with nearly all 13 validators participating\n* Bug fixes, key management feature requests from validator teams\n* Ethereum Event Forwarder released and installed by validators\n* Update to Vega core v0.44 - checkpoint functionality added, new config tree, clef added for Ethereum key management, bug fixes\n* Validator Notion created to assist with coordination\n\n**October**\n\n* Validator emergency response requirements discussed\n* New Testnet genesis file created, with all validator teams submitting pull requests containing their Vega, Tendermint and Ethereum keys\n* Private Testnet V3 started\n* Checkpoint test completed\n* Private Testnet V4 started\n\n## More than just another validator node\n\nOperating the Vega network requires more than a single application. Each validator consists of Tendermint, Vega core, Vega’s Data Node (for APIs), and an application that forwards events from Etheruem to the Vega network. There are additional applications required to ensure that key management is implemented in a secure manner (a post will follow on this later).\n\n![Cosmos validator teams starting on Vega](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aN4y9vYlDXESCEDzzaMvz.png?height=450&width=800)\n\nEach validator team must decide how they wish to configure their own hardware, and the security precautions they deem necessary to put in place. For example, our consensus keys are isolated such that even the Nala team can’t access them once the service has been initialized (though we can restore them blind in the event of a failure). We will share more information about the architectural decisions we have made in another post.\n\nIt has taken a substantial amount of time to ensure that our systems are architected correctly, as well as to test and iterate on, but we’re now in a position where we can confidently support the launch of a network very soon. The Vega team, especially @bill0 (Discord pseudonym) and Jeremy, have been extremely helpful with  our questions and displayed a willingness to implement new features when we have requested them.\n\nRemember we’re not getting paid zilch until this network is up, and we’ve had multiple contributors working full time on it for nearly three months, helping as much as we can with the creation of the network. We’re excited for Vega to launch as soon as it is ready to do so, and the Nala team will be available around the clock to ensure that it happens in an efficient manner.\n\n## R&D\n\nThe validator set that Vega's V1 token holders voted to start the network included industrial strength operations and community led initiatives (like us, a DAO). This has meant a blend of perspectives and approaches. We have been proudly learning and challenging the status quo alongside new teams and veterans alike. As the Vega community, you can look forward to each team presenting their own research once the network has stabilised 🔬\n\n## Get involved\n\nAs a community validator, we are grateful for the opportunity to develop our best practices alongside the veterans of the industry. We can’t wait to begin sharing our methods with you all and helping you run your own validators.\n\nIn the mean time, you can find us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/PurrNala) or [discord](https://discord.gg/QnxH6H7n). If you’d like to be part of starting this network drop a message and we’ll find a place for you ✨\n\n\\~Nala DAO", "timestamp": 1635534485, "digest": "WkDLYNLgw5xxQa3UJXJyxBtybBmIUzSa_SRLZiXiniw", "contributor": "0xd05883061A06048fB150904A93bbDf25FEBEeb55"}

Normally my focus is on NFTs, but my research for this upcoming week was unfortunately very fruitless - it seems that NFTs are currently in a coma and waiting for volume to leave the memecoin environment and start flowing back towards the NFT world. As you can see below, over the last few weeks volume has been steadily declining with a massive -60% drop in just the last 24 hours alone. This, coupled with the massive rise in gas fees for SHIB and Uniswap indicates that retail frenzy is driving most of the volume towards shitcoins, causing ETH gas prices to surge to over $200 per ERC transaction. This is probably one of the larger contributing factors towards the massive decline in NFT transactions lately, as fewer people are willing to gamble on mints when gas is so expensive.\n\n![OpenSea volume is at the lowest levels seen since August, largely due to memecoin mania and massive spikes in gas prices.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EVu4vwFMOSZnF5OVM7B45.png?height=570&width=1861)\n\n![OpenSea has been the top gas consumer for over 3 months, averaging between 15-20% of all ETH gas usage. However, this has changed dramatically in the last few days, with OS gas volume down over 80% in the last week. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o_J9E_Vjlsj0NpKvn6eQA.png?height=425&width=2031)\n\n**Additionally**, my research on upcoming projects didn’t yield me many results on things worth discussing, leading me to believe that over-saturation is another headwind in NFT land, and we’ll probably see more contraction and consolidation around proven, quality projects over the next few weeks. **Therefore, this week’s Future Friday post will focus on DeFi instead of NFTs.** \n\nFor those that know me, my true professional expertise actually lies with DeFi and DAOs whereas NFTs are more of an interest of mine that I’ve been writing about for fun. This, combined with the fact that we’re seeing some massive growth in new forms of DeFi protocols (a.k.a. DeFi 2.0) leads me to want to share with you some cool interesting protocols that might be worth investigating. If you want an introduction into DeFi 2.0, see my previous post linked below. \n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x940653d9C5076d2FDfd44F7BC8e66aeb5Fb598BE/PZUSeyjIq8-Fow0sZas_KfinlGy4U_93nH6oKC8mWKg](https://mirror.xyz/0x940653d9C5076d2FDfd44F7BC8e66aeb5Fb598BE/PZUSeyjIq8-Fow0sZas_KfinlGy4U_93nH6oKC8mWKg)\n\n\n---\n\nAssuming you’re already aware of DeFi 2.0 (or that you’ve read the above article), I’d like to talk a bit about several new developments in the DeFi universe. First and foremost, it’s important to note that Ethereum is still the undisputed king of decentralized finance - over 95% of total value locked (TVL) in pools, farms, and various protocols is in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, this doesn’t mean that it’s the only viable option. There are many other promising blockchain ecosystems that have a burgeoning DeFi scene, and this is primarily what we’re going to discuss today. In order to fully appreciate the topics at hand, I recommend you become familiar with the following concepts if you aren’t already, as they won’t be covered in this post:\n\n* Bridging from Ethereum to another blockchain\n* Staking funds and earning liquidity provider (LP) tokens\n* Layer 1 vs. Layer 2 vs. Layer 0\n* Bonding and protocol-owned liquidity\n\nIf you’re familiar with all of the above, then let’s dive into a few of the cool upcoming projects I’ve been looking at. Remember, none of this is financial advice - the purpose of this post is purely educational. Do your own research and do not invest more than you can comfortably afford to lose.\n\n# Secret Network (SCRT)\n\nThe [Secret Network](https://scrt.network) (SCRT) is a blockchain that has actually been in development for over 3 years, but has been low on the radar profile until very recently when the price of their proprietary token started surging in October. The Secret Network is a smart contract-capable blockchain that utilizes the Tendermint protocol (the same as Cosmos) to achieve higher scalability and throughput than currently available on Ethereum. However, scalability isn’t the primary selling point here. As the name suggests, the Secret Network is a privacy-preserving dApps platform that allows for fully private transactions and smart contracts that are provably secure and entirely private. \n\nOne of the major draws of permissionless blockchain ecosystems is their public auditability, so why is Secret such a big deal? Well, the community can easily audit smart contracts deployed to the blockchain and ensure their safety, but the contents of transactions are (optionally) entirely private. The Secret Network achieves this via its decentralized network of specialized hardware nodes that create secure computation environments called Trusted Execution Environments (TEE’s) that not even the node operators can access. The data is computed securely off-chain in these contained nodes, and then securely broadcast to the network without ever revealing their contents. \n\nThis enables fully privatized decentralized finance, which of course is going to be a major step forward for secure and discreet transactions. I must admit that the lack of transparency might attract bad actors to the chain as it will become trivial to disguise the movement of capital throughout the network, but private DeFi was always an inevitability and the Secret team has created a very polished and high-quality product. \n\nThere are a few places to visit once on the Secret Network, but the first is [Sienna](www.sienna.network). Sienna (and their SIENNA token) is the premier DEX for the Secret Network. By changing your SCRT tokens into sSCRT (secret Secret) you can initiate fully privatized swaps and stake your tokens in secret pools where no prying eyes can see the details of your wallet or transaction. The SIENNA token has been growing rapidly in the last few weeks, and is poised to become a significant player in the Secret ecosystem. The SIENNA token hasn’t dramatically pumped yet, but is on a steady and consistent grind upwards and I am very optimistic about its future. \n\n![Trading volume has topped out at around $50m per day for SIENNA, and the hype on Twitter for everything SCRT-related has been huge. I fully expect SIENNA to break $100 soon and have positioned myself accordingly.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cBXFqM0bga6PymSuySns9.png?height=711&width=1254)\n\n# Avalanche (AVAX)\n\nThe [Avalanche](www.avax.network) (AVAX) network is an alternative blockchain to Ethereum that uses its proprietary Avalanche Consensus (Proof of Stake) mechanism to secure the protocol. It boasts the fastest time to transaction finality in the industry with a roughly 2.5s time to finality, as compared with 3-5s with Solana and 10-60s or more with Ethereum. Avalanche is *fast*, and not only is bridging easy, it’s cheap. The average transaction on Avalanche costs between $0.10 to $0.60, meaning lightning-fast swaps into and out of any project you want. The first place you should stop when on the Avalanche chain is [Trader Joe](www.traderjoexyz.com). From here you can transfer your AVAX into any token you like, just like with every other major DEX, and the first two I recommend are listed below: \n\n* $JOE, the token for the Trader Joe DEX, has been on a moon mission lately that experienced a meteoric rise from below $0.05 at launch to over $4.00. Of course, most moon missions such as this are unsustainable, but JOE has retested supports  around $2.00 and has held consistently well with strong volume (see chart below) \n\n![With strong support at $2 and being by far the most popular DEX on AVAX, $JOE is a strong hold for those interested in the AVAX ecosystem.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1wXq5bi7xNxcIx97PzaUn.png?height=695&width=1271)\n\n* Wonderland ($TIME) is the first major OlympusDAO fork and is the biggest DeFi project on Avalanche by far. With over $800m in assets and an eye-watering 67700% APY, staking TIME is one of the easiest plays of the year. TIME has a strong and active community behind it, similar to the OlympusDAO, and is affiliated with [Daniele Sesta](www.twitter.com/danielesesta) who is a proven code-writing machine. Daniele is the creator of (or a major contributor to) numerous major DeFi projects including TIME, SPELL, MIM, and ICE. A character to follow on Twitter, his ability to pump out complex smart contracts and build strong communities around robust protocols is encouraging for anybody that is looking to get involved in the next generation of DeFi.\n\n  Going back to Wonderland, there’s not a huge difference between the mechanics of Olympus (OHM) and Wonderland (TIME), but TIME is being build specifically to cross blockchain ecosystems with a vision for an inter-chain staking, lending and bonding protocol to provide sustainable liquidity for DeFi apps across various ecosystems. Remember from my previous post that OHM (and by extension TIME) is backed by a basket of assets, where the price of TIME cannot fall below the value of this basket. Unlike other DeFi protocols that rent their liquidity from anonymous stakers, TIME *owns* all of its liquidity and therefore does not suffer from the problems that plague other DeFi protocols. (Be sure to read the “What is DeFi 2.0” article above if you want more information.\n\n  Either way, with TIME’s huge APY rewards (you currently double your ***staked*** tokens roughly every 30 days) it’s an excellent way to make passive money while also profiting from the hype as the token price continues to soar. Visit app.wonderland.money after bridging to AVAX and buying TIME on TraderJoe to stake.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JlUAyG506k63rgiannvd5.png?height=771&width=1229)\n\n# Harmony (ONE)\n\nThe last ecosystem we will look at today is Harmony (ONE). Many of you should be familiar with Harmony, as it’s a fast and cheap protocol that has a smaller market cap than its main competitors, including Avalanche and Fantom. Harmony is EVM compatible, meaning that Ethereum smart contracts are fully compatible in the Harmony ecosystem, but it’s actually based on a fork of the Binance Smart Chain - meaning it’s *also* directly compatible with BSC projects. \n\nHowever, my focus isn’t on Harmony itself, but on one of the most promising DeFi projects I’ve seen to date.\n\n### DeFi Kingdoms\n\n![DeFi Kingdoms is a really unique twist on decentralized finance.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dlZoL8th6engC_Dzo0JIJ.png?height=1589&width=2830)\n\n[DeFi Kingdoms](game.defikingdoms.com) (from here on out referred to as DFK, though their token is called $JEWEL) is a decentralized exchange, liquidity pool, *and* an NFT marketplace all wrapped up in a shiny RPG game in your browser. In this app you can swap coins at the Marketplace (DEX), stake your coins at the Bank, plant your LP tokens in the Garden for extra rewards, and hire or summon playable NFT heroes that allow you to complete quests, earn tokens, and summon new heroes through the Portal from beyond the ether! \n\nDFK has turned DeFi into a playable experience where not only are you earning money for providing liquidity for users on the Harmony blockchain, you’re also able to earn rewards for putting more effort into the game. The primary token is $JEWEL, which can be earned via staking or via playing the game. There exists a secondary currency in-game called Tears, which are earned by actually playing the game and are used to summon and empower your heroes.\n\nYour heroes are playable NFTs that can be bought or sold on DeFi kingdom’s own marketplace (located in the Tavern). These heroes are similar to heroes you find in other video games, which have their own stats (strength, wisdom, endurance, etc.) and professions (right now you can be a miner, fisher, gardener, or forager) which provide bonuses when completing in-game quests and bounties. \n\nThe game is currently in a nascent stage, but buying some $JEWEL on Harmony and staking in the bank alongside some $ONE and coming back in 6 months is probably a very solid moonshot strategy. This game has plenty of room to grow, but has complex [documentation](docs.defikingdoms.com) that you can read in order to learn more on how to play the game. I will be doing a deeper dive specifically into DFK in the near future, but until then you can find my Wizard Warrior lurking about in the kingdom somewhere!\n\n\n---\n\nThat’s it for the Future Friday post. I could write a novel about each of these protocols, but luckily for me that’s what the documentation is for. If you are interested in any of these projects, visit their linked websites and be sure to dive into their documentation before making a decision. I wouldn’t vouch for these if I didn’t already do so myself, and it should also be made known that I personally have money in all 3 of these projects. Do your own research, never spend more than you can afford to lose, and always feel free to ask me more questions!\n\nUntil next time!", "timestamp": 1635535011, "digest": "63cBx2EY61raSByXQ7jpjzAYpIkNX3eBBuTwd2euKWI", "contributor": "0x940653d9C5076d2FDfd44F7BC8e66aeb5Fb598BE"}

Why does it matter? And, most importantly, why should you care?**\n\nI have provided several resources for you below so you can explore the wonderful world of DAOs. These resources are organized in order of depth on the topic. Several examples of DAOs are included at the bottom of the list. I will leave much of the explanation to those who are more sophisticated and eloquent than I, but here’s a brief appetizer to put you in the proper emotional and digestive state so you can dive in.\n\n## DAOs Will Change the World\n\nA **Distributed Autonomous Organization**, or DAO, is a paradigm shift in how we define ownership, organizational design, and community governance. There are a number of applications already in the market today and many more are waiting to be dreamt of and implemented in the future.\n\n> From art, to business, to social capital, DAOs have cemented themselves as a cornerstone of the emerging ownership economy that favors **partnership** and **cooperation** rather than transactional relationships and value extraction.\n\nVery simply put, DAOs enable ownership. Think about owning a share of Apple stock. As the holder of that digital stock certificate, you *own* a piece of Apple. You have the right to vote on company initiatives, and you may benefit from increases in the company’s value or dividends that may be issued.\n\nA DAO creates **tokens** that are analogous to those Apple stock certificates. Those tokens can be either fungible tokens (interchangeable assets that may be used to transact like paper currency or Bitcoin) or non-fungible tokens (one-of-a-kind artworks or assets).\n\nAlright, so now your primed and ready to go.

The SIENNA token hasn’t dramatically pumped yet, but is on a steady and consistent grind upwards and I am very optimistic about its future.\n\n![Trading volume has topped out at around $50m per day for SIENNA, and the hype on Twitter for everything SCRT-related has been huge. I fully expect SIENNA to break $100 soon and have positioned myself accordingly.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cBXFqM0bga6PymSuySns9.png?height=711&width=1254)\n\n# Avalanche (AVAX)\n\nThe [Avalanche](www.avax.network) (AVAX) network is an alternative blockchain to Ethereum that uses its proprietary Avalanche Consensus (Proof of Stake) mechanism to secure the protocol. It boasts the fastest time to transaction finality in the industry with a roughly 2.5s time to finality, as compared with 3-5s with Solana and 10-60s or more with Ethereum. Avalanche is *fast*, and not only is bridging easy, it’s cheap. The average transaction on Avalanche costs between $0.10 to $0.60, meaning lightning-fast swaps into and out of any project you want. The first place you should stop when on the Avalanche chain is [Trader Joe](www.traderjoexyz.com). From here you can transfer your AVAX into any token you like, just like with every other major DEX, and the first two I recommend are listed below:\n\n* $JOE, the token for the Trader Joe DEX, has been on a moon mission lately that experienced a meteoric rise from below $0.05 at launch to over $4.00. Of course, most moon missions such as this are unsustainable, but JOE has retested supports  around $2.00 and has held consistently well with strong volume (see chart below)\n\n![With strong support at $2 and being by far the most popular DEX on AVAX, $JOE is a strong hold for those interested in the AVAX ecosystem.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1wXq5bi7xNxcIx97PzaUn.png?height=695&width=1271)\n\n* Wonderland ($TIME) is the first major OlympusDAO fork and is the biggest DeFi project on Avalanche by far. With over $800m in assets and an eye-watering 67700% APY, staking TIME is one of the easiest plays of the year. TIME has a strong and active community behind it, similar to the OlympusDAO, and is affiliated with [Daniele Sesta](www.twitter.com/danielesesta) who is a proven code-writing machine. Daniele is the creator of (or a major contributor to) numerous major DeFi projects including TIME, SPELL, MIM, and ICE. A character to follow on Twitter, his ability to pump out complex smart contracts and build strong communities around robust protocols is encouraging for anybody that is looking to get involved in the next generation of DeFi.\n\n  Going back to Wonderland, there’s not a huge difference between the mechanics of Olympus (OHM) and Wonderland (TIME), but TIME is being build specifically to cross blockchain ecosystems with a vision for an inter-chain staking, lending and bonding protocol to provide sustainable liquidity for DeFi apps across various ecosystems. Remember from my previous post that OHM (and by extension TIME) is backed by a basket of assets, where the price of TIME cannot fall below the value of this basket. Unlike other DeFi protocols that rent their liquidity from anonymous stakers, TIME *owns* all of its liquidity and therefore does not suffer from the problems that plague other DeFi protocols. (Be sure to read the “What is DeFi 2.0” article above if you want more information.\n\n  Either way, with TIME’s huge APY rewards (you currently double your ***staked*** tokens roughly every 30 days) it’s an excellent way to make passive money while also profiting from the hype as the token price continues to soar. Visit app.wonderland.money after bridging to AVAX and buying TIME on TraderJoe to stake.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JlUAyG506k63rgiannvd5.png?height=771&width=1229)\n\n# Harmony (ONE)\n\nThe last ecosystem we will look at today is Harmony (ONE). Many of you should be familiar with Harmony, as it’s a fast and cheap protocol that has a smaller market cap than its main competitors, including Avalanche and Fantom. Harmony is EVM compatible, meaning that Ethereum smart contracts are fully compatible in the Harmony ecosystem, but it’s actually based on a fork of the Binance Smart Chain - meaning it’s *also* directly compatible with BSC projects.\n\nHowever, my focus isn’t on Harmony itself, but on one of the most promising DeFi projects I’ve seen to date.\n\n### DeFi Kingdoms\n\n![DeFi Kingdoms is a really unique twist on decentralized finance.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dlZoL8th6engC_Dzo0JIJ.png?height=1589&width=2830)\n\n[DeFi Kingdoms](game.defikingdoms.com) (from here on out referred to as DFK, though their token is called $JEWEL) is a decentralized exchange, liquidity pool, *and* an NFT marketplace all wrapped up in a shiny RPG game in your browser. In this app you can swap coins at the Marketplace (DEX), stake your coins at the Bank, plant your LP tokens in the Garden for extra rewards, and hire or summon playable NFT heroes that allow you to complete quests, earn tokens, and summon new heroes through the Portal from beyond the ether!\n\nDFK has turned DeFi into a playable experience where not only are you earning money for providing liquidity for users on the Harmony blockchain, you’re also able to earn rewards for putting more effort into the game. The primary token is $JEWEL, which can be earned via staking or via playing the game. There exists a secondary currency in-game called Tears, which are earned by actually playing the game and are used to summon and empower your heroes.\n\nYour heroes are playable NFTs that can be bought or sold on DeFi kingdom’s own marketplace (located in the Tavern). These heroes are similar to heroes you find in other video games, which have their own stats (strength, wisdom, endurance, etc.) and professions (right now you can be a miner, fisher, gardener, or forager) which provide bonuses when completing in-game quests and bounties.\n\nThe game is currently in a nascent stage, but buying some $JEWEL on Harmony and staking in the bank alongside some $ONE and coming back in 6 months is probably a very solid moonshot strategy. The token is brand new and has tremendous upside potential, and is growing quickly. This game still has plenty of room to grow, but has complex [documentation](docs.defikingdoms.com) that you can read in order to learn more on how to play the game. I will be doing a deeper dive specifically into DFK in the near future, but until then you can find my Wizard Warrior lurking about in the kingdom somewhere!\n\n![$JEWEL has been growing consistently since it was released on 21 October, and is the primary token for DeFi Kingdoms. Plenty of upside potential on this one, but it requires further onboarding of users to make the token viable. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YTy4SW2t_ALPFwiL63yeZ.png?height=709&width=1245)\n\n\n---\n\nThat’s it for the Future Friday post. I could write a novel about each of these protocols, but luckily for me that’s what the documentation is for. If you are interested in any of these projects, visit their linked websites and be sure to dive into their documentation before making a decision. I wouldn’t vouch for these if I didn’t already do so myself, and it should also be made known that I personally have money in all 3 of these projects. Do your own research, never spend more than you can afford to lose, and always feel free to ask me more questions!\n\nUntil next time!", "timestamp": 1635535157, "digest": "63cBx2EY61raSByXQ7jpjzAYpIkNX3eBBuTwd2euKWI", "contributor": "0x940653d9C5076d2FDfd44F7BC8e66aeb5Fb598BE"}
{"id": "FS48dEZ78P7glMwX6ctsLKos1STYbPymxm6f0Wo1q9o", "title": "Future Friday - 29 October", "body": "Hello everyone, glad to be back for the next edition of **Future Friday** where we discuss the upcoming week in the metaverse. Normally my focus is on NFTs, but my research for this upcoming week was unfortunately very fruitless - it seems that NFTs are currently in a coma and waiting for volume to leave the memecoin environment and start flowing back towards the NFT world. As you can see below, over the last few weeks volume has been steadily declining with a massive -60% drop in just the last 24 hours alone. This, coupled with the massive rise in gas fees for SHIB and Uniswap indicates that retail frenzy is driving most of the volume towards shitcoins, causing ETH gas prices to surge to over $200 per ERC transaction. This is probably one of the larger contributing factors towards the massive decline in NFT transactions lately, as fewer people are willing to gamble on mints when gas is so expensive.\n\n![OpenSea volume is at the lowest levels seen since August, largely due to memecoin mania and massive spikes in gas prices.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EVu4vwFMOSZnF5OVM7B45.png?height=570&width=1861)\n\n![OpenSea has been the top gas consumer for over 3 months, averaging between 15-20% of all ETH gas usage. However, this has changed dramatically in the last few days, with OS gas volume down over 80% in the last week. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o_J9E_Vjlsj0NpKvn6eQA.png?height=425&width=2031)\n\n**Additionally**, my research on upcoming projects didn’t yield me many results on things worth discussing, leading me to believe that over-saturation is another headwind in NFT land, and we’ll probably see more contraction and consolidation around proven, quality projects over the next few weeks. **Therefore, this week’s Future Friday post will focus on DeFi instead of NFTs.**\n\nFor those that know me, my true professional expertise actually lies with DeFi and DAOs whereas NFTs are more of an interest of mine that I’ve been writing about for fun. This, combined with the fact that we’re seeing some massive growth in new forms of DeFi protocols (a.k.a. DeFi 2.0) leads me to want to share with you some cool interesting protocols that might be worth investigating. If you want an introduction into DeFi 2.0, see my previous post linked below.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x940653d9C5076d2FDfd44F7BC8e66aeb5Fb598BE/PZUSeyjIq8-Fow0sZas_KfinlGy4U_93nH6oKC8mWKg](https://mirror.xyz/0x940653d9C5076d2FDfd44F7BC8e66aeb5Fb598BE/PZUSeyjIq8-Fow0sZas_KfinlGy4U_93nH6oKC8mWKg)\n\n\n---\n\nAssuming you’re already aware of DeFi 2.0 (or that you’ve read the above article), I’d like to talk a bit about several new developments in the DeFi universe. First and foremost, it’s important to note that Ethereum is still the undisputed king of decentralized finance - over 95% of total value locked (TVL) in pools, farms, and various protocols is in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, this doesn’t mean that it’s the only viable option. There are many other promising blockchain ecosystems that have a burgeoning DeFi scene, and this is primarily what we’re going to discuss today. In order to fully appreciate the topics at hand, I recommend you become familiar with the following concepts if you aren’t already, as they won’t be covered in this post:\n\n* Bridging from Ethereum to another blockchain\n* Staking funds and earning liquidity provider (LP) tokens\n* Layer 1 vs. Layer 2 vs. Layer 0\n* Bonding and protocol-owned liquidity\n\nIf you’re familiar with all of the above, then let’s dive into a few of the cool upcoming projects I’ve been looking at. Remember, none of this is financial advice - the purpose of this post is purely educational. Do your own research and do not invest more than you can comfortably afford to lose.\n\n# Secret Network (SCRT)\n\nThe [Secret Network](https://scrt.network) (SCRT) is a blockchain that has actually been in development for over 3 years, but has been low on the radar profile until very recently when the price of their proprietary token started surging in October. The Secret Network is a smart contract-capable blockchain that utilizes the Tendermint protocol (the same as Cosmos) to achieve higher scalability and throughput than currently available on Ethereum. However, scalability isn’t the primary selling point here. As the name suggests, the Secret Network is a privacy-preserving dApps platform that allows for fully private transactions and smart contracts that are provably secure and entirely private.\n\nOne of the major draws of permissionless blockchain ecosystems is their public auditability, so why is Secret such a big deal? Well, the community can easily audit smart contracts deployed to the blockchain and ensure their safety, but the contents of transactions are (optionally) entirely private. The Secret Network achieves this via its decentralized network of specialized hardware nodes that create secure computation environments called Trusted Execution Environments (TEE’s) that not even the node operators cannot access. The data is computed securely off-chain in these contained nodes, and then securely broadcast to the network without ever revealing their contents.\n\nThis enables fully privatized decentralized finance, which of course is going to be a major step forward for secure and discreet transactions. I must admit that the lack of transparency might attract bad actors to the chain as it will become trivial to disguise the movement of capital throughout the network, but private DeFi was always an inevitability and the Secret team has created a very polished and high-quality product.\n\nThere are a few places to visit once on the Secret Network, but the first is [Sienna](www.sienna.network). Sienna (and their SIENNA token) is the premier DEX for the Secret Network. By changing your SCRT tokens into sSCRT (secret Secret) you can initiate fully privatized swaps and stake your tokens in secret pools where no prying eyes can see the details of your wallet or transaction. The SIENNA token has been growing rapidly in the last few weeks, and is poised to become a significant player in the Secret ecosystem. The SIENNA token hasn’t dramatically pumped yet, but is on a steady and consistent grind upwards and I am very optimistic about its future.\n\n![Trading volume has topped out at around $50m per day for SIENNA, and the hype on Twitter for everything SCRT-related has been huge.

{"id": "QE0zVh-bblr6BO9oIyGUjyWfERK8ci0QLqahgV3wnDM", "title": "Future Friday - 29 October", "body": "Hello everyone, glad to be back for the next edition of **Future Friday** where we discuss the upcoming week in the metaverse. Normally my focus is on NFTs, but my research for this upcoming week was unfortunately very fruitless - it seems that NFTs are currently in a coma and waiting for volume to leave the memecoin environment and start flowing back towards the NFT world. As you can see below, over the last few weeks volume has been steadily declining with a massive -60% drop in just the last 24 hours alone. This, coupled with the massive rise in gas fees for SHIB and Uniswap indicates that retail frenzy is driving most of the volume towards shitcoins, causing ETH gas prices to surge to over $200 per ERC transaction. This is probably one of the larger contributing factors towards the massive decline in NFT transactions lately, as fewer people are willing to gamble on mints when gas is so expensive.\n\n![OpenSea volume is at the lowest levels seen since August, largely due to memecoin mania and massive spikes in gas prices.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EVu4vwFMOSZnF5OVM7B45.png?height=570&width=1861)\n\n![OpenSea has been the top gas consumer for over 3 months, averaging between 15-20% of all ETH gas usage. However, this has changed dramatically in the last few days, with OS gas volume down over 80% in the last week. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o_J9E_Vjlsj0NpKvn6eQA.png?height=425&width=2031)\n\n**Additionally**, my research on upcoming projects didn’t yield me many results on things worth discussing, leading me to believe that over-saturation is another headwind in NFT land, and we’ll probably see more contraction and consolidation around proven, quality projects over the next few weeks. **Therefore, this week’s Future Friday post will focus on DeFi instead of NFTs.**\n\nFor those that know me, my true professional expertise actually lies with DeFi and DAOs whereas NFTs are more of an interest of mine that I’ve been writing about for fun. This, combined with the fact that we’re seeing some massive growth in new forms of DeFi protocols (a.k.a. DeFi 2.0) leads me to want to share with you some cool interesting protocols that might be worth investigating. If you want an introduction into DeFi 2.0, see my previous post linked below.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x940653d9C5076d2FDfd44F7BC8e66aeb5Fb598BE/PZUSeyjIq8-Fow0sZas_KfinlGy4U_93nH6oKC8mWKg](https://mirror.xyz/0x940653d9C5076d2FDfd44F7BC8e66aeb5Fb598BE/PZUSeyjIq8-Fow0sZas_KfinlGy4U_93nH6oKC8mWKg)\n\n\n---\n\nAssuming you’re already aware of DeFi 2.0 (or that you’ve read the above article), I’d like to talk a bit about several new developments in the DeFi universe. First and foremost, it’s important to note that Ethereum is still the undisputed king of decentralized finance - over 95% of total value locked (TVL) in pools, farms, and various protocols is in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, this doesn’t mean that it’s the only viable option. There are many other promising blockchain ecosystems that have a burgeoning DeFi scene, and this is primarily what we’re going to discuss today. In order to fully appreciate the topics at hand, I recommend you become familiar with the following concepts if you aren’t already, as they won’t be covered in this post:\n\n* Bridging from Ethereum to another blockchain\n* Staking funds and earning liquidity provider (LP) tokens\n* Layer 1 vs. Layer 2 vs. Layer 0\n* Bonding and protocol-owned liquidity\n\nIf you’re familiar with all of the above, then let’s dive into a few of the cool upcoming projects I’ve been looking at. Remember, none of this is financial advice - the purpose of this post is purely educational. Do your own research and do not invest more than you can comfortably afford to lose.\n\n# Secret Network (SCRT)\n\nThe [Secret Network](https://scrt.network) (SCRT) is a blockchain that has actually been in development for over 3 years, but has been low on the radar profile until very recently when the price of their proprietary token started surging in October. The Secret Network is a smart contract-capable blockchain that utilizes the Tendermint protocol (the same as Cosmos) to achieve higher scalability and throughput than currently available on Ethereum. However, scalability isn’t the primary selling point here. As the name suggests, the Secret Network is a privacy-preserving dApps platform that allows for fully private transactions and smart contracts that are provably secure and entirely private.\n\nOne of the major draws of permissionless blockchain ecosystems is their public auditability, so why is Secret such a big deal? Well, the community can easily audit smart contracts deployed to the blockchain and ensure their safety, but the contents of transactions are (optionally) entirely private. The Secret Network achieves this via its decentralized network of specialized hardware nodes that create secure computation environments called Trusted Execution Environments (TEE’s) that not even the node operators cannot access. The data is computed securely off-chain in these contained nodes, and then securely broadcast to the network without ever revealing their contents.\n\nThis enables fully privatized decentralized finance, which of course is going to be a major step forward for secure and discreet transactions. I must admit that the lack of transparency might attract bad actors to the chain as it will become trivial to disguise the movement of capital throughout the network, but private DeFi was always an inevitability and the Secret team has created a very polished and high-quality product.\n\nThere are a few places to visit once on the Secret Network, but the first is [Sienna](www.sienna.network). Sienna (and their SIENNA token) is the premier DEX for the Secret Network. By changing your SCRT tokens into sSCRT (secret Secret) you can initiate fully privatized swaps and stake your tokens in secret pools where no prying eyes can see the details of your wallet or transaction. The SIENNA token has been growing rapidly in the last few weeks, and is poised to become a significant player in the Secret ecosystem. The SIENNA token hasn’t dramatically pumped yet, but is on a steady and consistent grind upwards and I am very optimistic about its future.\n\n![Trading volume has topped out at around $50m per day for SIENNA, and the hype on Twitter for everything SCRT-related has been huge. I fully expect SIENNA to break $100 soon and have positioned myself accordingly.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cBXFqM0bga6PymSuySns9.png?height=711&width=1254)\n\n# Avalanche (AVAX)\n\nThe [Avalanche](www.avax.network) (AVAX) network is an alternative blockchain to Ethereum that uses its proprietary Avalanche Consensus (Proof of Stake) mechanism to secure the protocol. It boasts the fastest time to transaction finality in the industry with a roughly 2.5s time to finality, as compared with 3-5s with Solana and 10-60s or more with Ethereum. Avalanche is *fast*, and not only is bridging easy, it’s cheap. The average transaction on Avalanche costs between $0.10 to $0.60, meaning lightning-fast swaps into and out of any project you want. The first place you should stop when on the Avalanche chain is [Trader Joe](www.traderjoexyz.com). From here you can transfer your AVAX into any token you like, just like with every other major DEX, and the first two I recommend are listed below:\n\n* $JOE, the token for the Trader Joe DEX, has been on a moon mission lately that experienced a meteoric rise from below $0.05 at launch to over $4.00. Of course, most moon missions such as this are unsustainable, but JOE has retested supports  around $2.00 and has held consistently well with strong volume (see chart below)\n\n![With strong support at $2 and being by far the most popular DEX on AVAX, $JOE is a strong hold for those interested in the AVAX ecosystem.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1wXq5bi7xNxcIx97PzaUn.png?height=695&width=1271)\n\n* Wonderland ($TIME) is the first major OlympusDAO fork and is the biggest DeFi project on Avalanche by far. With over $800m in assets and an eye-watering 67700% APY, staking TIME is one of the easiest plays of the year. TIME has a strong and active community behind it, similar to the OlympusDAO, and is affiliated with [Daniele Sesta](www.twitter.com/danielesesta) who is a proven code-writing machine. Daniele is the creator of (or a major contributor to) numerous major DeFi projects including TIME, SPELL, MIM, and ICE. A character to follow on Twitter, his ability to pump out complex smart contracts and build strong communities around robust protocols is encouraging for anybody that is looking to get involved in the next generation of DeFi.\n\n  Going back to Wonderland, there’s not a huge difference between the mechanics of Olympus (OHM) and Wonderland (TIME), but TIME is being build specifically to cross blockchain ecosystems with a vision for an inter-chain staking, lending and bonding protocol to provide sustainable liquidity for DeFi apps across various ecosystems. Remember from my previous post that OHM (and by extension TIME) is backed by a basket of assets, where the price of TIME cannot fall below the value of this basket. Unlike other DeFi protocols that rent their liquidity from anonymous stakers, TIME *owns* all of its liquidity and therefore does not suffer from the problems that plague other DeFi protocols. (Be sure to read the “What is DeFi 2.0” article above if you want more information.\n\n  Either way, with TIME’s huge APY rewards (you currently double your ***staked*** tokens roughly every 30 days) it’s an excellent way to make passive money while also profiting from the hype as the token price continues to soar. Visit app.wonderland.money after bridging to AVAX and buying TIME on TraderJoe to stake.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JlUAyG506k63rgiannvd5.png?height=771&width=1229)\n\n# Harmony (ONE)\n\nThe last ecosystem we will look at today is Harmony (ONE). Many of you should be familiar with Harmony, as it’s a fast and cheap protocol that has a smaller market cap than its main competitors, including Avalanche and Fantom. Harmony is EVM compatible, meaning that Ethereum smart contracts are fully compatible in the Harmony ecosystem, but it’s actually based on a fork of the Binance Smart Chain - meaning it’s *also* directly compatible with BSC projects.\n\nHowever, my focus isn’t on Harmony itself, but on one of the most promising DeFi projects I’ve seen to date.\n\n### DeFi Kingdoms\n\n![DeFi Kingdoms is a really unique twist on decentralized finance.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dlZoL8th6engC_Dzo0JIJ.png?height=1589&width=2830)\n\n[DeFi Kingdoms](game.defikingdoms.com) (from here on out referred to as DFK, though their token is called $JEWEL) is a decentralized exchange, liquidity pool, *and* an NFT marketplace all wrapped up in a shiny RPG game in your browser. In this app you can swap coins at the Marketplace (DEX), stake your coins at the Bank, plant your LP tokens in the Garden for extra rewards, and hire or summon playable NFT heroes that allow you to complete quests, earn tokens, and summon new heroes through the Portal from beyond the ether!\n\nDFK has turned DeFi into a playable experience where not only are you earning money for providing liquidity for users on the Harmony blockchain, you’re also able to earn rewards for putting more effort into the game. The primary token is $JEWEL, which can be earned via staking or via playing the game. There exists a secondary currency in-game called Tears, which are earned by actually playing the game and are used to summon and empower your heroes.\n\nYour heroes are playable NFTs that can be bought or sold on DeFi kingdom’s own marketplace (located in the Tavern). These heroes are similar to heroes you find in other video games, which have their own stats (strength, wisdom, endurance, etc.) and professions (right now you can be a miner, fisher, gardener, or forager) which provide bonuses when completing in-game quests and bounties.\n\nThe game is currently in a nascent stage, but buying some $JEWEL on Harmony and staking in the bank alongside some $ONE and coming back in 6 months is probably a very solid moonshot strategy. The token is brand new and has tremendous upside potential, and is growing quickly. This game still has plenty of room to grow, but has complex [documentation](docs.defikingdoms.com) that you can read in order to learn more on how to play the game. I will be doing a deeper dive specifically into DFK in the near future, but until then you can find my Wizard Warrior lurking about in the kingdom somewhere!\n\n![$JEWEL has been growing consistently since it was released on 21 October, and is the primary token for DeFi Kingdoms. Plenty of upside potential on this one, but it requires further onboarding of users to make the token viable. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YTy4SW2t_ALPFwiL63yeZ.png?height=709&width=1245)\n\n\n---\n\nThat’s it for the Future Friday post. I could write a novel about each of these protocols, but luckily for me that’s what the documentation is for. If you are interested in any of these projects, visit their linked websites and be sure to dive into their documentation before making a decision. I wouldn’t vouch for these if I didn’t already do so myself, and it should also be made known that I personally have money in all 3 of these projects. Do your own research, never spend more than you can afford to lose, and always feel free to ask me more questions!\n\nUntil next time!", "timestamp": 1635535500, "digest": "63cBx2EY61raSByXQ7jpjzAYpIkNX3eBBuTwd2euKWI", "contributor": "0x940653d9C5076d2FDfd44F7BC8e66aeb5Fb598BE"}

And unfortunately, instances like the insurrection of the Capitol building, the spread of covid-related misinformation, and the rise of hyper partisan political environments have taught us this the hard way. \n\nIn an environment where over 500 hours of video content are uploaded to YouTube every minute, moderation functions as the core commodity that platforms have to offer. These algorithmically-programmed systems of curation maintain profitability by holding our attention on sites (to see ads) and presenting us with content that will change our behavior (to sell ads). Problem is, these algorithms have learned to “nudge” our behaviour for more sinister reasons than just bleeding our wallets dry.\n\nTo make matters worse, we’re completely blind to what’s going on behind the gold-plated doors of Silicon Valley. Under [Section 230 of the Communications and Decency Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230#:\\~:text=Section%20230%20is%20a%20section,respect%20to%20third%2Dparty%20content.), platform companies basically have sole discretion in how they’re able to collect, collate, use, and sell our personal information. \n\nOh, and did I mention that we get no share of the profit. While Zuckerberg basks in  “Meta's” rising stock price, we’re fighting over what’s fact versus fiction. *How can we create a strong public sphere if we can’t even agree on the issues we face?* \n\nTo state the obvious here: this is bad, really bad. Time’s up tech giants. We must move away from the current data climate and work together to foster a more open and democratized distribution of the “new oil”–aka, user data. \n\nSure, opting in and out of advertisements for a cut of the profits is a step in the right direction, as [Brave browser and the BAT (Basic Attention Token)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) have shown, but this solution only covers part of the equation. \n\nImagine having access to your entire data registry, without having to ask the platforms that collect it to “please” share it with you. Gaining awareness into how platform companies use AI models and marketing segmentation to drive profit from our user behavior would do more than just offer transparency. We're talking about flipping the tables from platform ownership to user ownership, giving you the power to rent, sell, stake or withdraw your data from wherever it may be used.\n\nOnly through blockchain can users handle their valuable information through a tokenized package: don't like what Facebook is using your likes for? Withdraw their access; found a new AI research team that you really vibe with. Take part in their growth by helping to train their models. Possibilities are really endless when each and every one of us controls our grain of the sand. This could enable us to shape the future we want, not what our overlords at Silicon Valley decide is best for us.\n\nNot everything is sunshine and butterflies though, there's a ton of hurdles to overcome before this idyllic vision can become a reality, most of them coming from within. Legal measures like [GDPR](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_en), [the Cookie Law ](https://www.cookielaw.org/the-cookie-law/)and the upcoming (hopefully) update to [Section 230 of the Communications and Decency Act ](https://www.eff.org/es/issues/cda230)barely scratch the surface in terms of giving people the agency they deserve. When it comes to how accountable platforms are for the real-world effects of the content we produce, and the value they extract from it, we need to have a voice. \n\nFunnily enough, some steps in the right direction have been made by the same people that got us here in the first place. [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/decentralized-collaborative-ai-on-blockchain/), [Nokia](https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/blockchain-powered-marketplace-for-sharing-data-and-ai-models-launched-6385) and other [leading-edge companies](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2020.497985/full) are currently setting the ground for modular, smart contract-based, and decentralized datasets leveraging all of the advantages of the blockchain to guide AI research and usage into a more equitable industry of the future.\n\nWhether or not they'll stick to that promise is up to us, but the opportunity is there. Decentralization is our chance at having a say in how our data is used, it's up to us to keep that agency and not serve it up again for MANGA (formerly FAANG) to exploit as they see fit.\n\n*Written by [@anay_sim](https://twitter.com/anay_sim) and [@sumin_of_note](https://twitter.com/sumin_of_note)*\n\n### New Pathfinder guides: \n\nEnjoy some fresh new guides this week to bring you even further down the rabbit hole.\n\n* [Setting up/Bridging Funds on Celo](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/SYGPJ-_m7pdhtrI9babxltZJsQCIsdb5vdU8SrDxI0o) by [@bvajresh](https://twitter.com/bvajresh) \n* [How to Stake OHM on Olympus](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/TeL1wa-FZTPiUoOpK8zHnB2FD8JWiG76SgchzIJ7SBc) by [@zach_davidson](https://twitter.com/zach__davidson)\n\n### Pathfinder updates:\n\n***Editorial Update:***\n\nZach Davidson published an instant classic on the blossoming RabbitHoleDAO and [why decentralization matters](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/CYsaX0fT-IOV5OO3JiDcXpLFdcnhocVOO5pTZ52hsLE).

Now imagine that child always blending into the background; never defining who they are and usually playing second fiddle to friends and family.\n\nAt a certain point, there is a switch and drive to move out of the shadows. In this successful venture, they redefine themselves and realize that they have a knack for understanding perceptions and can use their skills to influence that.

Therefore, Enryakuji Temple is a historically and culturally important place, and it once had possessed far more cultural properties and historical documents than are still in existence.\n\nBut the enormous cultural properties and historical documents of Enryakuji Temple suffered damage from [the Siege of Mount Hiei in 1571](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Mount_Hiei) and much of these were lost. Currently, there are only a few historical documents that can tell us what the precincts of Enryakuji Temple in the past looked like.\n\n*Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu* is probably the most detailed pictorial old maps of the precincts of Enryakuji Temple in existence and also shows the halls of temples and shrines that may have existed before [1571](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Mount_Hiei).\\[8\\] Therefore, these maps are valuable historical documents to know about what the precincts in the past looked like.\n\n### Repository\n\nCurrently, these maps are one of the collections in [the National Archives of Japan (NAJ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives_of_Japan). (These maps were formerly one of the collections in the Japanese Cabinet Library.)\n\n### Dimensions\n\n* 1st volume size : Width 280cm x Height 187.5cm\\[9\\]\n* 2nd volume size : Width 279cm x Height 187.5cm\\[9\\]\n\n## Public on Wikimedia Commons & Wikipedia\n\nI published the image files of these maps (1st & 2nd volume) in the public domain on Wikimedia Commons as follows.\n\n* Wikimedia Commons (1st volume): [File:The whole map of Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu (1st volume).png - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_whole_map_of_Sanmon-Sant%C5%8D_Sakamoto_S%C5%8Dezu_(1st_volume).png)\n* Wikimedia Commons (2nd volume): [File:The whole map of Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu (2nd volume).png - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_whole_map_of_Sanmon-Sant%C5%8D_Sakamoto_S%C5%8Dezu_(2nd_volume).png)\n\nI published information about them on Wikipedia (English & Japanese) as follows.\n\n* Wikipedia (English): [Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanmon-Sant%C5%8D_Sakamoto_S%C5%8Dezu)\n* Wikipedia (Japanese): [山門三塔坂本惣絵図 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)\n\n## Background of my acquisition of the image files\n\nI followed the regular procedure of [the National Archives of Japan (NAJ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives_of_Japan), requested the use of the digital data (image files) of the 2 maps, paid the following fees and other charges, and obtained the image files from NAJ, April 2021.\n\n* Fees for digital camera photography (medium format special photography) : 4 shots x 543 JPY/shot = 2,172 JPY\n* Fees for digital camera photography (high-definition special photography) : 32 shots x 3,300 JPY/shot = 105,600 JPY\n* Fees for writing of the above shooting data to DVD-R : 2 DVD-Rs x 543 JPY/disc = 1,086 JPY\n* Fees for packing and shipping : 1 mail x 520 JPY/mail = 520 JPY\n* Total fees and charges : 109,378 JPY\n\nEach of the 2 maps (1st and 2nd volume) is too big to take the picture of it at one time. (The sizes of 1st and 2nd volume : Width 280cm x Height 187.5cm, Width 279cm x Height 187.5cm.) Therefore, NAJ took the pictures for each parts of them separately. Each of the 2 maps was divided into 16 pieces of image files. (In addition to those, NAJ took the pictures of the front cover and the back cover for each maps. Eventually the number of the image files of the 2 maps is 18 for each (total is 36).)\n\nI connected these 2 x 16 pieces of image files and made 2 image files of the whole map of *[Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanmon-Sant%C5%8D_Sakamoto_S%C5%8Dezu)* (1st & 2nd volume).\n\nI publish these image files in the public domain in accordance with [the terms of secondary use of digital images, etc](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use_e.html) of NAJ.\n\n* [Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu (山門三塔坂本惣絵図)](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/file/en/1227276.html) ([The National Archives of Japan Digital Archive](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/index_e.html))\n* [Guide for Users : NATIONAL ARCHIVES OF JAPAN](http://www.archives.go.jp/english/gettingstarted/guide.html)\n* Price list for special copying (Japanese-language version : [特別複写に係る料金表(PDF)](http://www.archives.go.jp/guide/pdf/price_list.pdf))\n* Price list for packing and shipping (Japanese-language version : [梱包・送料一覧(PDF)](http://www.archives.go.jp/guide/pdf/kouhu_souryou.pdf))\n* [Secondary use of content | NATIONAL ARCHIVES OF JAPAN Digital Archive](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use_e.html)\n\n## Notes\n\n* \\[1\\] *Take Kakuchō* (Japanese: [武覚超](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A6%E8%A6%9A%E8%B6%85)) (2008). *Hieizan shodō shi no kenkyū* (Japanese: [比叡山諸堂史の研究](https://ndlonline.ndl.go.jp/#!/detail/R300000001-I000009432843-00), The Study of the History of the Halls of Enryakuji Temple on Mount Hiei). *Hōzōkan* (Japanese: 法藏館). p. 116.\n* \\[2\\] *Take Kakuchō* (Japanese: [武覚超](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A6%E8%A6%9A%E8%B6%85)) (1992). \"*Naikaku Bunko zou Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu zen niyō no seiritsu ni tsuite* (Japanese: 内閣文庫蔵『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』全二葉の成立について, About the Formation of the 2 Maps, Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu, in the Collection of Japanese Cabinet Library)\". *Eizan Gakuin kenkyū kiyō* (Japanese: [叡山学院研究紀要](https://ndlonline.ndl.go.jp/#!/detail/R300000003-I4421875-00), Bulletin of Eizan Gakuin College (Annual of Buddhist studies)). *Eizan Gakuin* (Japanese: 叡山学院, Eizan Gakuin College (part of the Enryakuji Academy group)). **15**: 60–61.\n* \\[3\\] [Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities) - Maps - UNESCO World Heritage Centre](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/688/multiple=1&unique_number=814)\n* \\[4\\] [Enryakuji Temple | Shiga Attractions | Travel Japan | JNTO](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1075/) ([Japan National Tourism Organization](https://www.japan.travel/en/us/))\n* \\[5\\] [World Heritage in Japan | Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan](https://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/culture/coop/unesco/c_heritage/w_heritage/property.html)\n* \\[6\\] *Sekai-isan bunkazai online* (Japanese: [世界遺産 文化遺産オンライン](https://bunka.nii.ac.jp/special_content/hlink3), World Heritage Site | Japanese Cultural Heritage Online)\n* \\[7\\] *Kyōto-shi : Sekai-isan \"Koto Kyōto no bunkazai (Kyōto-shi, Uji-shi, Ōtsu-shi)\"* (Japanese: [京都市：世界遺産「古都京都の文化財（京都市・宇治市・大津市）」](https://www.city.kyoto.lg.jp/bunshi/page/0000005538.html), Kyoto City | World Heritage Site \"Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities)\")\n* \\[8\\] *Take Kakuchō* (Japanese: [武覚超](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A6%E8%A6%9A%E8%B6%85)) (2008). *Hieizan shodō shi no kenkyū* (Japanese: [比叡山諸堂史の研究](https://ndlonline.ndl.go.jp/#!/detail/R300000001-I000009432843-00), The Study of the History of the Halls of Enryakuji Temple on Mount Hiei). *Hōzōkan* (Japanese: 法藏館). pp. 106–107.\n* \\[9\\] On April 13, 2021, contacted the NAJ and confirmed the size (width and length) of the 1st and 2nd maps.\n\n## References\n\n* *Take Kakuchō* (Japanese: 武覚超) (2008). *Hieizan shodō shi no kenkyū* (Japanese: *[比叡山諸堂史の研究](https://ndlonline.ndl.go.jp/#!/detail/R300000001-I000009432843-00), The Study of the History of the Halls of Enryakuji Temple on Mount Hiei)*. *Hōzōkan* (Japanese: 法藏館). pp. 106–116.\n* *Take Kakuchō* (Japanese: 武覚超) (1992). \"*Naikaku Bunko zou Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu zen niyō no seiritsu ni tsuite* (Japanese: 内閣文庫蔵『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』全二葉の成立について, About the Formation of the 2 Maps, Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu, in the Collection of Japanese Cabinet Library)\". *Eizan Gakuin kenkyū kiyō* (Japanese: *[叡山学院研究紀要](https://ndlonline.ndl.go.jp/#!/detail/R300000003-I4421875-00), Bulletin of Eizan Gakuin College (Annual of Buddhist studies))*. *Eizan Gakuin* (Japanese: 叡山学院, Eizan Gakuin College (part of the Enryakuji Academy group)). **15**: 51–120.\n* Otsu City Museum of History (Japanese: 大津市歴史博物館, Hepburn: *Ōtsu-shi rekishi hakubutsukan*), ed.

{"id": "GnMw73xDyBC1_H8jAJSxzBV6yF4uHtH0XIJ5AIvANcw", "title": "Covalent, the indexing of Blockchain", "body": "最近花时间读完了Covalent的白皮书，来分享下项目的设计细节，进度，还有我的看法。\n\n## 项目内容\n\nCovalent提供的服务，可以让用户（比如dapp开发者），很简单的使用SQL一样的语法检索所有的链上数据。举例子的话，比如搜索出所有Eth链上持有XX nft的地址，再按持有时间排个序等等。\n\n这种检索，现在想要做到，只能自己写代码，一个区块一个区块的扒拉，然后自己设计数据库，自己存，自己索引。不仅对用户来说门槛很高，花费也很高（运行代码+aws 数据库都是要花钱的）。但是有了Covalent的服务之后，只需要写常规的RPC，或者Json的API，然后按照API 访问频率收费就可以了，搜索链上数据变得简单且方便。\n\n## 代币模型\n\n这个项目是发币了的$CQT。主要是个功能性代币。具体使用场景如下：\n\n1. 当做奖励。\n   不同的结点有不同的功能，当不同的结点正确的做了该做的事，那么CQT就会用来当做奖励。\n   1. 爬虫结点(Block Specimen Producer Node),也就是负责把各个链上数据转换成固定格式数据的结点，正确转换之后，可以得到奖励。错误的话，结点内部stake的所有$CQT会被验证者(Validator)，收走。作为对Validator的奖励。\n   2. 索引结点(Indexer Node)， 负责给爬虫结点转换的数据，增加索引。正确索引之后，可以得到奖励。错误的话内部stake的$CQT会被收走。\n   3. 存储结点(Storage Node)， 负责存储索引好的数据，响应外界的搜索要求。正确回复外界搜索之后，会得到奖励。\n   4. 性能差的结点，比如availability低的，会被惩罚。但是性能好的，会被奖励。\n2. 买数据。\n   一些特殊的数据的买卖，可以使用$CQT交易。\n3. 用来DAO的管理。\n   可以用来投票，比如是否增加新的功能之类的。$CQT相关的投票只涉及功能方面，不涉及股权，团队分红等方面。\n\n注意，作为普通用户，使用CQT的索引数据，比如搜索多少地址持有XXX NFT，不是花费$CQT，而是稳定币。这样是为了签订服务合同的时候，避开$CQT价格波动的影响。\n\n## 整体架构\n\n![Overview of Covalent](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dBdhhLOtpvYIBEi3fEl8-.png?height=600&width=800)\n\n上图中，蓝色为Covalent网络里不同的角色，黄色是数据转换过程。从区块链数据，变为用户可搜索的数据，整个网络里需要4种结点。有两个特殊的结点角色画不下了，它们是：\n\n1. 验证结点(Validator)\n   每一步新数据的产生，都可以被质疑，依据Validator的验证结果，要么结点会被关闭(做了坏数据)，所有stake的$CQT被没收; 要么结点安然无恙，质疑者的$CQT被没收。\n2. 路由结点(Directory Service Node)\n   每个存储结点存的内容并不一样，比如有的可以只存BSC的数据，有的只存ETH的数据，那么用户的搜索需要被引导到哪个存储结点，就是路由结点的功能。\n\n## 当前进度\n\n根据白皮书，最终的设想是完全分布式。也就是团队只负责开发运行各种结点需要的SDK，但是结点本身由各个不同身份的社区成员运行。但是在上线的时候，大部分的结点目前为止还是由团队运行的。可以理解为现在还是一个中心化的网络。\n\n当前支持的链：\n\n[https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#tag--Class-B](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#tag--Class-B)\n\n## 设计细节\n\n1. 想成为任意一种结点，几乎都需要质押一部分$CQT。\n2. 爬虫结点\n   1. 想成为爬虫结点，需要跑一个SDK(extract and norm worker)。\n   2. 爬虫结点转换完数据之后，会提交一个工作证明给CQT 主网。第一个被接受的结点，会被奖励$CQT。此过程类似于挖矿。\n   3. 一般一个爬虫结点同时会兼任验证者的职能。因此整个网络里验证者至少和原始数据生产者数量一致。\n3. 索引结点。\n   1. 需要跑一个SDK (stateless tracker).\n   2. 产生的新数据结构被称为trace specimen.产生的结果会存到存储结点，并且发一个结果的hash值给主网，第一个被接受的结点，会被奖励$CQT, 依旧类似于挖矿。\n   3. 索引结点最好自己同时也是存储结点，不然把结果存储到另一个结点的花费会比较高。\n4. 存储结点。\n   1. 主要处理内部的request，对于每一个request，存储结点都可以收费。内部的request主要是索引结点发起的，目的是找到最经济实惠的存储地址。\n   2. 他们需要告诉路由结点，自己的费用，自己存什么样的数据。\n5. 搜索结点。\n   1. 会需要跑一个Covalent ETL worker，预先从搜索结点加载一些数据，放到本地，以便拥有更快的响应速度。\n   2. (QQ??) query node收谁的钱？？用户付钱不是付的stable coin嘛？？\n\n## 质疑点\n\n1. 现在项目的近况如何了？每种node都有多少个？\n2. 由于用户不会直接使用$CQT支付搜索费用, 那么什么情况下$CQT价格会升高？\n   (Those making requests for data (as customers) will however **never interact with the CQT economy.** Instead, their payments will be made in **standard dollar figures and charged in stablecoins**.

{"id": "XIgPDYL-iZwUasWODP1MlS1xARsI_Xg1hpncxvQ9h-g", "title": "Covalent, the indexing of Blockchain", "body": "lockchain\n\n最近花时间读完了Covalent的白皮书，来分享下项目的设计细节，进度，还有我的看法。\n\n## 项目内容\n\nCovalent提供的服务，可以让用户（比如dapp开发者），很简单的使用SQL一样的语法检索所有的链上数据。举例子的话，比如搜索出所有Eth链上持有XX nft的地址，再按持有时间排个序等等。\n\n这种检索，现在想要做到，只能自己写代码，一个区块一个区块的扒拉，然后自己设计数据库，自己存，自己索引。不仅对用户来说门槛很高，花费也很高（运行代码+aws 数据库都是要花钱的）。但是有了Covalent的服务之后，只需要写常规的RPC，或者Json的API，然后按照API 访问频率收费就可以了，搜索链上数据变得简单且方便。\n\n## 代币模型\n\n这个项目是发币了的$CQT。主要是个功能性代币。具体使用场景如下：\n\n1. 当做奖励。 \n 不同的结点有不同的功能，当不同的结点正确的做了该做的事，那么CQT就会用来当做奖励。\n   1. 爬虫结点(Block Specimen Producer Node),也就是负责把各个链上数据转换成固定格式数据的结点，正确转换之后，可以得到奖励。错误的话，结点内部stake的所有$CQT会被验证者(Validator)，收走。作为对Validator的奖励。\n   2. 索引结点(Indexer Node)， 负责给爬虫结点转换的数据，增加索引。正确索引之后，可以得到奖励。错误的话内部stake的$CQT会被收走。\n   3. 存储结点(Storage Node)， 负责存储索引好的数据，响应外界的搜索要求。正确回复外界搜索之后，会得到奖励。\n   4. 性能差的结点，比如availability低的，会被惩罚。但是性能好的，会被奖励。\n2. 买数据。 \n 一些特殊的数据的买卖，可以使用$CQT交易。\n3. 用来DAO的管理。 \n 可以用来投票，比如是否增加新的功能之类的。$CQT相关的投票只涉及功能方面，不涉及股权，团队分红等方面。\n\n注意，作为普通用户，使用CQT的索引数据，比如搜索多少地址持有XXX NFT，不是花费$CQT，而是稳定币。这样是为了签订服务合同的时候，避开$CQT价格波动的影响。\n\n## 整体架构\n\n![Overview of Covalent](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dBdhhLOtpvYIBEi3fEl8-.png?height=600&width=800)\n\n上图中，蓝色为Covalent网络里不同的角色，黄色是数据转换过程。从区块链数据，变为用户可搜索的数据，整个网络里需要4种结点。有两个特殊的结点角色画不下了，它们是：\n\n1. 验证结点(Validator) \n 每一步新数据的产生，都可以被质疑，依据Validator的验证结果，要么结点会被关闭(做了坏数据)，所有stake的$CQT被没收; 要么结点安然无恙，质疑者的$CQT被没收。\n2. 路由结点(Directory Service Node) \n 每个存储结点存的内容并不一样，比如有的可以只存BSC的数据，有的只存ETH的数据，那么用户的搜索需要被引导到哪个存储结点，就是路由结点的功能。\n\n## 当前进度\n\n根据白皮书，最终的设想是完全分布式。也就是团队只负责开发运行各种结点需要的SDK，但是结点本身由各个不同身份的社区成员运行。但是在上线的时候，大部分的结点目前为止还是由团队运行的。可以理解为现在还是一个中心化的网络。\n\n当前支持的链：\n\n[https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#tag--Class-B](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#tag--Class-B)\n\n## 设计细节\n\n1. 想成为任意一种结点，几乎都需要质押一部分$CQT。\n2. 爬虫结点\n   1. 想成为爬虫结点，需要跑一个SDK(extract and norm worker)。\n   2. 爬虫结点转换完数据之后，会提交一个工作证明给CQT 主网。第一个被接受的结点，会被奖励$CQT。此过程类似于挖矿。\n   3. 一般一个爬虫结点同时会兼任验证者的职能。因此整个网络里验证者至少和原始数据生产者数量一致。\n3. 索引结点。\n   1. 需要跑一个SDK (stateless tracker).\n   2. 产生的新数据结构被称为trace specimen.产生的结果会存到存储结点，并且发一个结果的hash值给主网，第一个被接受的结点，会被奖励$CQT, 依旧类似于挖矿。\n   3. 索引结点最好自己同时也是存储结点，不然把结果存储到另一个结点的花费会比较高。\n4. 存储结点。\n   1. 主要处理内部的request，对于每一个request，存储结点都可以收费。内部的request主要是索引结点发起的，目的是找到最经济实惠的存储地址。\n   2. 他们需要告诉路由结点，自己的费用，自己存什么样的数据。\n5. 搜索结点。\n   1. 会需要跑一个Covalent ETL worker，预先从搜索结点加载一些数据，放到本地，以便拥有更快的响应速度。\n   2. (QQ??) query node收谁的钱？？用户付钱不是付的stable coin嘛？？\n\n## 质疑点\n\n1. 现在项目的近况如何了？每种node都有多少个？\n2. 由于用户不会直接使用$CQT支付搜索费用, 那么什么情况下$CQT价格会升高？ \n (Those making requests for data (as customers) will however **never interact with the CQT economy.** Instead, their payments will be made in **standard dollar figures and charged in stablecoins**. This makes it possible for standard agreements and pre-set pricing to be made when a company chooses to use the Covalent Network for running its operations. It also protects them from speculating on the underlying currency.)\n\n## 个人思考\n\n1. 项目设计的不错。不像是圈钱就要跑的。\n2. 作为一个数据库，最重要的性能就是两个，Availability(不能宕机，用户使用的时候最好永远在线，像Google一样) and Durability(数据不能丢)。这两个性能在这个系统里，极大取决于负责读取的结点的个数，也就是存储结点，搜索结点，和路由结点。\n3. 还没太想明白CQT用户增多和$CQT价格上涨之间的关系。感觉其实可以没什么关系？ \n 越多的用户 -→ 越多的搜索需求 -→ 越多的stable coin和美元订单 -→团队更多钱。但是不知道团队更多钱和$CQT价格上涨有啥关系。感觉可以毫无关系…", "timestamp": 1635546436, "digest": "BVaisaRLGHMmSDywjaRllx9QlKw6o_OO5-ufGw8_raM", "contributor": "0xBBf442191aB5213de67Dd4026560c9940F349A6B"}

We've put together a guide to help you navigate through the different steps you'll need to follow.\n\n## Preparing a Wallet\n\nTo mint an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain, you'll need both Ether (ETH) and a wallet that can hold your NFT.\n\nThe easiest way to do both at the same time is to download [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/), an iOS app that allows you to create a wallet and add up to $500 a week using Apple Pay. If that amount works for you, you can go straight to Minting.\n\nHowever, if you need more than $500, follow these next steps.\n\n### Creating a Wallet\n\nFirst, create an Ethereum wallet that you can use to conduct your transactions and hold your NFTs. A few options that we support are Metamask, WalletConnect (which works for Rainbow and many other wallets), and Coinbase Wallet (which is different from a Coinbase.com account).\n\nYour Ethereum wallet will have a public address on the Ethereum network, which is where you can send and receive tokens like Ether and NFTs.\n\n### Buying Ether\n\nThe easiest way to buy Ether, the currency used on Ethereum, is to use a crypto exchange.\n\nWe recommend Coinbase for beginners. Note that this [Coinbase.com](http://Coinbase.com) account is *different* from a Coinbase Wallet account—it is an account for Coinbase's exchange, which allows you to trade currencies like USD for cryptocurrencies like Ether.\n\n1. Create an account and buy some Ether.\n   1. Make sure that you have *more* Ether than you need for the cost of the mint—each Ethereum transaction requires \"gas,\" the network fees that go into processing blockchain transactions. Gas fees vary by the type of transaction and depending on the level of activity in the Ethereum network, but minting an NFT can cost significantly more when there's high traffic. For example, the witches cost 0.07 ETH each to mint, so you may want to have 0.1 ETH per witch on hand.\n2. Once you've bought your Ether, transfer it by sending it to the address of the wallet you just created earlier. Now you're ready to mint an NFT!\n\n# Minting\n\nWhen you \"mint\" an NFT, you're interacting with a smart contract on the blockchain and making a transaction to create a new token under that contract, one that you own. For Crypto Coven, you can either mint through our website (beginner-friendly) or directly through Etherscan (more advanced).\n\n### Website (Beginner-Friendly)\n\nThe easiest way to mint a witch will be through the [Crypto Coven website](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/), since we'll handle a lot of the complexity for you.\n\n1. You'll need to connect your wallet to our website using the \"Connect Wallet\" button—a modal will open, and you'll need to choose the wallet type you created earlier.\n   1. If you created a [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) wallet (or any other WalletConnect-enabled wallet), click the WalletConnect option. You'll see a QR code you need to scan. In Rainbow, you'll want to press the \"Discover\" button on the upper-right corner of the main screen, then the QR scanner icon on the upper-right corner of the next screen. Once you're there, scan the code on your screen, and you should be connected to our website.\n2. Once your wallet is connected, select the number of witches you'd like to mint, with a max of three. Then click \"Mint,\" and you should see an overview of the transaction you're about to create in your wallet, with the option to confirm it.\n3. In most cases, the transaction should take a minute or two and then complete. Hooray, you've just minted your first NFT!\n\nNote: In some uncommon cases (i.e., the contract hits the total limit of witches to mint), there is a possibility that your transaction will fail, which means that you will lose some or even all of the gas you paid. The reason that this scenario can happen is that *any* transaction on Ethereum requires gas to execute—you always have to pay for the computations you're enacting on the network. [Here](https://info.etherscan.com/reason-for-failed-transaction/) are some common reasons transactions can fail.\n\n### Etherscan (Advanced)\n\nIf you'd like to interact directly with the smart contract, you can mint witches on Etherscan. Etherscan only supports Metamask or WalletConnect, so Coinbase Wallet will not work for this method.\n\n1. Go to our smart contract in Etherscan—we’ll include the link once it’s deployed. It should have a green checkmark on the \"Contract\" tab to indicate that the source code is deployed and verified.\n2. You can click on the \"Read Contract\" button to check if the sale is active.\n   1. If you're participating in the public sale, make sure that `isPublicSaleActive` is set to `true` before you attempt to mint a witch—otherwise, your transaction will be reverted, and you may lose gas.\n   2. If you're participating in the community sale, you will need to have already added your wallet address to the list in order to mint a witch. Make sure that `isCommunitySaleActive` is set to `true` before you attempt to mint a witch. Otherwise, your transaction will be reverted, and you may lose gas.\n3. Now head over to the \"Write Contract\" view. Here, you'll need to connect your wallet to Etherscan by clicking the \"Connect to web3\" button. Once you're connected, you can start creating transactions under the smart contract.\n4. Now it's time to do the minting!\n   1. If you're participating in the public sale, head to the function that just says `mint`. The price per witch in the public sale is 0.07 ETH, so multiply that by the number of witches you want to mint (up to three). Enter that total in the `payableAmount` field, along with the number of witches you want in the `numberOfTokens` field.\n   2. If you're participating in the community sale, you'll need to go to the function named `mintCommunitySale` instead.\n      1. The community sale price per witch is 0.05 ETH. Multiply that by the number of witches you want to mint (up to three) and enter that total in the `payableAmount` field.\n      2. Enter the number of witches you want in the `numberOfTokens` field.\n      3. The last field you'll need is your proof, which is how we verify that your address is on our list for this sale. You can retrieve your proof by finding your wallet address at a URL we’ll link when it’s ready. Copy the proof associated with your address and paste it into the `merkleProof` field in Etherscan. It should look like a list of hashes:\n\n         ```\n         [\"0xe970...52d9\",\"0xe970...52d9\",\"0xe970...52d9\",\"0xe970...52d9\"]\n         ```\n5. In most cases, the transaction should take a minute or two and then complete. And… now you’ve got got your witch.\n\n# Viewing Your Witch\n\nYou won't be able to see your witch immediately after minting! Once a day, we reveal all witches minted in the past day, so you'll see a placeholder in your wallet until the next reveal.

{"id": "eUJuVaB8l8VrbpamLERGF33cCpotkk4Weicgas0-XW4", "title": "What is defi", "body": "DeFi is short for “decentralized finance,” an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain geared toward disrupting financial intermediaries.\n\nDeFi draws inspiration from [blockchain](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/), the technology behind the digital currency bitcoin, which allows several entities to hold a copy of a history of transactions, meaning it isn't controlled by a single, central source. That's important because centralized systems and human gatekeepers can limit the speed and sophistication of transactions while offering users less direct control over their money. DeFi is distinct because it expands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex financial use cases.\n\nBitcoin and many other digital-native assets stand out from legacy digital payment methods, such as those run by Visa and PayPal, in that they remove all middlemen from transactions. When you pay with a credit card for coffee at a cafe, a financial institution sits between you and the business, with control over the transaction, retaining the authority to stop or pause it and record it in its private ledger. With bitcoin, those institutions are cut out of the picture.\n\nDirect purchases aren't the only type of transaction or contract overseen by big companies; financial applications such as loans, insurance, crowdfunding, derivatives, betting and more are also in their control. Cutting out middlemen from all kinds of transactions is one of the primary advantages of DeFi.\n\nBefore it was commonly known as decentralized finance, the idea of DeFi was often called \"open finance.\"", "timestamp": 1635554925, "digest": "STppW-jvq-WXEVYJBGuIB_n3imQ0oXPOT1dpMH8rJlM", "contributor": "0xE8C97650AA7E4525cc45851af5b2f5F81403432A"}
{"id": "ECL6LCGQIqEPMas0WWyiWUlRNwSyZuQocA4NH8_BWlY", "title": "defi FAQ", "body": "## DeFi FAQ\n\n### How do I make money with DeFi?\n\nThe value locked up in Ethereum DeFi projects has been exploding, with many users reportedly [making a lot of money](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/).\n\nUsing Ethereum-based lending apps, as mentioned above, users can generate \"passive income\" by loaning out their money and generating interest from the loans. [Yield farming](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/), described above, has the potential for even larger returns, but with larger risk. It allows for users to leverage the lending aspect of DeFi to put their crypto assets to work generating the best possible returns. However, these systems tend to be complex and often lack transparency.\n\n### Is investing in DeFi safe?\n\nNo, it's risky. Many believe DeFi is the future of finance and that investing in the disruptive technology early could lead to massive gains.\n\nBut it's difficult for newcomers to separate the good projects from the bad. And, there has been plenty of bad.\n\nAs DeFi has increased in activity and popularity through 2020, many DeFi applications, such as meme coin [YAM](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/), have crashed and burned, [sending](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/) the market capitalization from $60 million to $0 in 35 minutes. Other DeFi projects, including [Hotdog](https://twitter.com/JeffKirdeikis/status/1301221894385852421) and Pizza, faced the same fate, and many investors lost a lot of money.\n\nIn addition, DeFi bugs are unfortunately [still very common](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/). Smart contracts are powerful, but they can't be changed once the rules are baked into the protocol, which often makes bugs permanent and thus increasing risk.\n\n### When will DeFi go mainstream?\n\nWhile more and more people are being drawn to these DeFi applications, it's hard to say where they’ll go. Much of that depends on who finds them useful and why. Many believe various DeFi projects have the potential to become [the next Robinhood](https://twitter.com/UniswapProtocol/status/1300446158733574148), drawing in hordes of new users by making financial applications more inclusive and open to those who don't traditionally have access to such platforms.\n\nThis financial technology is new, experimental and isn't without problems, especially with regard to security or [scalability](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/).\n\nDevelopers hope to eventually rectify these problems. Ethereum 2.0 could tackle scalability concerns through a concept known as [sharding](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/), a way of splitting the underlying database into smaller pieces that are more manageable for individual users to run.\n\n### How will Ethereum 2.0 impact DeFi?\n\nEthereum 2.0 isn't a panacea for all of DeFi’s issues, but it's a start. Other protocols such as Raiden and [TrueBit](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/) are also in the works to further tackle Ethereum's scalability issues.\n\nIf and when these solutions fall into place, Ethereum's DeFi experiments will have an even better chance of becoming real products, potentially even going mainstream.\n\n## Bitcoin as DeFi\n\nWhile Ethereum is top dog in the DeFi world, many proponents of Bitcoin share the goal of cutting the middleman out of more complex financial transactions, and they’ve developed ways to do so using the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nCompanies such as [DG Labs](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/) and [Suredbits](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/), for instance, are working on a Bitcoin DeFi technology called discreet log contracts (DLC). DLC offers a way to execute more complex financial contracts, such as derivatives, with the help of Bitcoin. One use case of DLC is to pay out bitcoin to someone only if certain future conditions are met, say, if the Chicago White Sox team win its next baseball game, the money will be dispensed to the winner.", "timestamp": 1635554972, "digest": "k6C_YLjqVbad_Z1pjrPJ0t69_6wTXi4JN1uZmAs-cxU", "contributor": "0xE8C97650AA7E4525cc45851af5b2f5F81403432A"}

Yet, despite this fact, most people don’t really understand what the metaverse is or why it’s important.\n\n**In short, the metaverse is an entirely new media format--one that is likely to consume everybody’s free time, much the same way that social media has.**\n\nEvery time a new technology emerges, it re-shuffles the cards and changes the game. Similarly, those who do not adapt to this new reality will be left behind.\n\nFor the large tech giants, the metaverse is not merely a possible future outcome; it is a requirement for their survival.\n\nEspecially for Facebook, the metaverse will unlock a whole new experience of virtual social worlds where users transact and utilize NFTs to confer social currency and wealth, rather than luxury handbags or sneakers. Instead of their real-world hobbies, they will gather in the metaverse to discuss their hobbies there. **But Facebook, is based on a real life social network, which is why they are starting to panic.**\n\nThe greatest of Facebook’s attributes is its ability to evolve and adapt quickly-- like how they acquired both WhatsApp and Instagram before they achieved peak popularity. But this time, Facebook cannot just buy a metaverse to survive, so it has to build its own.\n\n**I predict that the metaverse is where everyone will interact in the coming years. It will consume everything just like TikTok has.**\n\n**Metaverses are made up of three components: infrastructure, economy and contents.** For most of us, we can understand the metaverse as the sum of its contents.\n\nLet me take TikTok as an example to explain this how the contents will be the substance of the metaverse:\n\nIn the case of TikTok, Infrastructure meant the platform, the 4G / 5G cellular and mobile devices that enable the ability for short videos to be shared from person to person. And, also these devices included high-resolution cameras. These become the indispensable INFRASTRUCTURE which enabled the new TikTok paradigm\n\n**An economy needs a system, a circle to share value.** In TikTok’s economic system, it’s quite easy: user/consumers spend their attention and watch advertisements. Advertisers pay for the attention, creators benefit from the advertising spend, so TikTok is a fully operational and self-sustaining economy. More users = more advertisers = more creators and then the flywheel keeps spinning.\n\nSo, what lures the end-user? The answer is content; every short video either you like or dislike, either because it’s funny or inscrutably weird forms the basis of content. And that content is what is attracting and retaining users.\n\nIt’s important that every metaverse industry player understands from the user standpoint that the **metaverse is all about content.** It is a world where content is shared, in a global open competitive market. And that content and its quality is the most important thing.\n\n**The metaverse is a game-changer, just like TikTok. In TikTok, most of the older giants failed to compete; they were too slow to embrace the new media format.** This will also happen in the metaverse.\n\nMy parting advice is both for the people inside and outside this industry. **The metaverse will create prosperity for content creators, and it will definitelyshuffle the cards and incubate new opportunities.** The big question is exactly how this change will occur and what it will look like.\n\nBut what I am absolutely certain of is that it will dramatically change the market.\n\n\n---\n\nSpecial thanks to [Janine Yorio](https://twitter.com/janineyorio) from [Republic Realm](https://twitter.com/joinrepublic_re).", "timestamp": 1635557683, "digest": "WOfHLhO3mX1iOnttVSAbt_XghveNFvP79ATltA0u660", "contributor": "0x9A1c43135B90409B4af788b64D8E5e2cEA62D133"}

It would be a third 'nation’, a society but not a State, made of many peoples.\n\nA long decentralization began, not that anyone was aware, with the rise of the Internet. A gold rush was on to explore and expand this new 'land', scalability was the priority.\n\nBoth East and West empires fought a secret war, a \"cold war\" after becoming the victors of the Wars between 1918 and 1945. They were obsessed with secrets, keeping their own and uncovering others, and everyone was in the middle of it.\n\nWhile the long secret war ended with the collapse of the USSR, a 'scene' emerged, the Cypherpunks - one of them wrote a letter.‘\n\nA Cypherpunk's Manifesto', was a warning, and a promise, to the future.\n\nPrivacy of individuals was a necessary part of the social contract for an Open Society. New technology was enabling what was impossible: anonymity and privacy in speech and commerce.\n\nThe desire for privacy was equal to piracy in the failed empire of the East but there were worries about privacy fading in the West. Privacy is not the same as secrecy, it is about individual power to choose what we share with the world.\n\nIf anyone communicates or transacts with another in public, as in most of life, they were vulnerable to the State. The State's power to limit privacy was the power to control people. The choices were either vulnerability or secrecy, there was no privacy in open public life - yet.\n\nNew technologies, the Internet and Cryptography could build a new society on a network. \n\nOne of the pillars of the great decentralization coming, privacy, was being built at last.\n\n**2877 EARTH, THE NECKLACE, FROM POLICE TO CONSULATE**\n\n\"Officer, there's someone I need to find, I think they've taken her.\"\n\n\"Chief Inspector, My name is Chief Inspector Field.\"\n\nThe Chief Inspector poured more water into my glass. He had a glass too. He was watching me, the way I did during interrogations in the War. I was waiting for questions. I didn’t have many answers.\n\n\"We're not allowed to run any scans on you, Commander. You have diplomatic protection. I saw what you did to most of the others we found when we were alerted and we found you on the floor of the restaurant, lights out. My guess is designer nanos.\"\n\nHow did they make it pass my routine consular treatments, I wondered. It must be something way off-chain, black market, military, and stolen. It was in that spring water I liked. They were prepared. The Chief Inspector seemed to read my mind.\n\n\"There are shadow coops, in business as far back as to when the Long War started, and some of them had connections. Precision stuff. You're still alive or your nanos kept the worst from happening. Have your medical staff in the Consulate check you.\"\n\n\"Chief Inspector, there's a girl, a woman. She's with the Martian Trade Delegation, from a respected, influential trading coop.”\n\n\"She was with you? What does she have to do with all of this?\"\n\n\"She got caught up in this brawl. She's a trade delegate, a friend.\"\n\n\"Commander, before you are safe inside the Consulate, I'm going to ask you, what is the truth? I can't arrest you but I have this diplomatic mess. Higher-ups ready to demote me to patrol. The people you put in the hospital belong to a shadow coop I've been paying attention to, for a long time. I can't arrest you but maybe we can help each other.\"\n\nAs I drank my water, I “read” his face and decided to risk telling him.\n\n“Chief Inspector, she brought to Earth something valuable and dangerous, one of your black market operators wants it. She doesn’t have it but they’ll use her. Will you help me?”\n\n[https://audius.co/sjit/privacy](https://audius.co/sjit/privacy)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uPL00Mo1uwUDNh5mJVgoe.png?height=1600&width=1200)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jJ_qHbdFLUDihwlY2Rlhc.png?height=1600&width=1200)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635568869, "digest": "JTM2yqQALUfenFW-thzOpUwRxCK8XUSnDFKQCMSxU3w", "contributor": "0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f"}

Share the industry conferences I have participated in, specifically what activities are there, and what everyone does it for.\n\nThe main highlight of the industry conference is the keynote speech and thematic round table discussion. This is clear to everyone. For a conference, I am embarrassed to collect tickets without inviting a few big V to come to the platform. The bigger the PPT screen in the conference, the more awesome the conference will be.\n\nThere are many different attitudes towards speeches and roundtable discussions. Generally speaking, I think it is the most basic supply of the conference. The value of attending the conference is relatively low in terms of speeches and round-table discussions. The information density and quality are far inferior to watching news reports directly.\n\nAn accessory to a speech is an advertisement. Between speeches, there are usually advertisements on the big screen. This may be the main source of income for the conference.\n\nThe second important task of the industry conference is to invite some companies in the industry to set up booths, commonly known as booths. The exhibiting company will set up a table with some brochures and roll-up banners. Two employees will communicate with visitors. If you talk a few words, they will usually give you a small gift or something.\n\nI have a lot of t-shirts from various companies. Basically, I don’t need to buy clothes in the summer. These are all I can chat with at industry conferences. I hope that the participating companies will give away some pants or something, so that I can save some money and buy more coins.\n\nThe third important thing of the industry conference is that many companies or project parties will take the opportunity to organize some small conferences, because the conference has called people from the industry, and some project parties simply pull their customers together to cultivate feelings. . These are often cocktail parties, small road shows and project introduction activities.\n\nThese surrounding small meetings are generally separated from the organizer of the organizer, and the venue of the event is usually in the coffee shop next to the organizer’s meeting place, hotel conference room and the like.\n\nAs long as there is an industry conference a few days before the start, my WeChat will receive invitations from some companies, asking me to attend their receptions.\n\nThe fourth major event of the industry conference is that someone will organize some fairly high-end private seminars. This is similar to the surrounding small meeting above, but the reasons and goals are completely different. The surrounding small clubs tend to be biased towards advertising and marketing, and private seminars are often aimed at some industry issues, and several mutually recognized experts are invited to have a brainstorm.\n\nEvery time I attend an industry conference, what I look forward to most is this type of discussion. Before attending the conference, I myself would ask my friends if there are similar activities in advance, and even make an appointment for my friends to discuss specific issues.\n\nThe fifth major event of the industry conference is the social interaction of participants. The two of them pulled to the corner of the meeting to communicate, exchange business cards, add WeChat or something. There are often opportunities for cooperation.\n\nDo you think there are any details of the conference?

The energy of newness is earned. Stretching is involved. Facing your fears, a cornerstone of this existence, can be a game or it can wield unrelenting anguish on the human psyche. The scale is wide and dramatic, almost slightly incomprehensible. Accomplishments and their measuring tape is skewed and distorted in the current age and era. For instance a man 50 years ago might feel a sense of accomplishment for having found his place in the world, whatever that may have been, A local disk jokey or a passionate merchant. Crystallising a skill and purpose into the fibre of their existence. The scale on which they operated was not a main contributing factor in this measure of accomplishment. The Vantage point of their unique experience in and of itself gave rise to solid conviction. Now, the validation of today, comes only through pure superficialities. The idea of accomplishments is far more attractive and widely praised than actual accomplishments. Every accomplishment of today is applauded. There is no fact checking these accomplishments. It has become routine to seek the applause for an accomplishment you want to achieve but have not yet done so. We are an age of people in a debt of accomplishment. We owe society and the inner psyche a great deal.  This sort of debt crystallises man in a different sort of way. Instead of a man or womans inner ‘I’ being one of a calculated reference. A sum total of algorithmic math. This new generation of mans inner I is completely heuristic in nature. It is like a tight rope tied by a 3rd grader, completely subject to all elements of outside influence. The practice of presence is just a word to this new man.  The feeling of being, which is equal to taking responsibility for the sum total of your life, to acknowledge the divine aspect of your existence. To be worshipful of the combination of breath and consciousness that is undoubtedly an aspect of God. Fear of acknowledging God is so terrific in the collective that people would rather throw themselves into the river of accomplishment than to look reality in the eye. In this action consensus becomes divine understanding, acceptance takes the place of conviction. We must be brave enough to evaluate the true total of our situation. Do you sincerely believe that you have no time to pause and reflect, to take responsibility by re-evaluating your priorities. It has been said a thousand times over again. This life is like a morning dew. Eternal we stand facing the sum total of our fears and beliefs. Everything must be acknowledged. The world is not what you pretend it to be. I don’t need to explain this to you because its as evident as the teeth in your mouth. Life is a road. We walk this road straightly and well by looking it dead in the eye. All matter of horrible evils must be confronted. Death must be confronted.  Failure, Sin, past acts of evil and hatred must be confronted and forgiven. If you jump off the road and hide in a hole in the sand, you will be comforted, you will be welcomed and you will be buried.", "timestamp": 1635579067, "digest": "mq8nEEg9S7dvkugO_6szI8MQjHaOWyx-xAIuIin1j7Y", "contributor": "0x222AbFB4bF7B11A3d6d824b76C0634C1512D7EdC"}

Crypto hype is concentrated around a new era of the internet with decentralized applications (or dApps, if you want to sound like a dWeeb)**\n\nIn today's internet landscape, most websites are owned (hosted, designed, governed etc) by private corporations or even individuals.\n\nIf you make an account on, say, YouTube, the world's second most highly trafficked site, you provide Youtube (Google) some basic details about yourself such as your interests, age, gender, and location. You assert that YouTube gets to do what they want with that data about you because it belongs to them. \n \nBut it doesn't stop there: YouTube's bread and butter is user-generated content. It's a website that owns and monetizes on videos that everyday people provide to them. Any rules about the content that goes on the website is dictated by YouTube. After all, it's their site. They are paying for the engineers and data centres that maintain the website.\n\nWhat if you decided one day that YouTube didn't have the right to create policies and govern the website? After all, it was users who created all their content and gave them all their traffic. Maybe an entertainment hub like YouTube should democratically governed by everyone. Everyone who wanted to be part of running YouTube would pitch in computing resources and code to run this decentralized application.\n\nThe underlying technology that enables decentralized computing (read: spreading the computing power across many computers) is the blockchain. When we move most of our biggest internet websites to this decentralized model, we will have reached a new era of the web theoretically dubbed as \"Web3\".\n\n**2. Ethereum was the first decentralized application platform.**\n\nThe first public blockchain that gained widespread adoption was behind the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. If you contributed to growing and maintaining the security of the Bitcoin blockchain with your computing power, you would be rewarded by getting some Bitcoin. Everyone would theoretically hold the same power to propose changes to this system because nobody held all the computing power to run the currency themselves. As far as I can tell, the Bitcoin blockchain was only built to record currency transactions.\n\nIn 2013, college student Vitalik Buterin extracted the idea that blockchain enabled demographic maintenance of applications beyond currency- It could be used to demographically run other software applications in general as I described above. He proposed a software development platform on a blockchain in a whitepaper, and was given $100,000 to drop out and build this new blockchain. That's how Ethereum was born.\n\nEthereum is still the largest software development platform for decentralized apps almost a decade later. At the time I'm writing this, Ethereum powers 78% of decentralized software applications.\n\n**3. In a decentralized application, data and actions are recorded to the public blockchain**\n\nWhen I like a tweet, Twitter records my like activity to their private database that only they can access and verify. On Dwitter (imaginary decentralized Twitter), my like activity has to be saved to the public blockchain.\n\nThe code to record app activity, such as a dweet (too far?) or a like, to the blockchain is called a \"smart contract\". Smart contracts can be written to record any event to the blockchain.\n\n**4. You need to pay someone to record your app's actions to the blockchain**\n\nIf Ethereum's main selling point is that it allows developers to easily build decentralized apps, why is there an associated currency you can buy, and why is it worth so much?\n\nBefore I can write data to Ethereum, I need a random person's computer to validate that my action is legit. This validation step may seem totally unnecessary, but it's the whole protocol that allows the blockchain to be editable by the general public because it protects from any fake or malicious actions.\n\nHow do we pay the random person for validating our transaction? One way could be wiring USD to them for their services, which can get really messy. Luckily, Ethereum conveniently coded in an automatic mechanism to request you to offer up some coin, named Ether, for someone to claim when they validate your transaction. People who win the bid to record your entry to the blockchain get your Ether. In order to get your own Ether, you set up a computer to help with validating the blockchain or you buy it off of someone else who does it instead.\n\nOne reason Ether may be worth so much is because a lot of people use the Ethereum blockchain to power their decentralized applications, and thus there is always a need for people to pay for transactions to be added. This statement is measured because this I am not giving investment advice.\n\n**5. The Ethereum blockchain processes 30 transactions per second.**\n\nWith so many people using the Ethereum platform, processing just 30 transactions often means that your data will take a little while to be recorded. If you want to speed up your processing, you need to bid more Ether for your transaction to validated first. That can get really expensive.\n\n> Whereas it costs \\~$3 today to do a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, and \\~$8-40 on Ethereum, it costs $0.0001 to do a transaction on Solana. (Source)\n\nIn response, a number of competitive software development focused blockchains have entered the market. Offerings such as Solana and Cardano boast that they can process many more transactions per second than Ethereum can, which makes working with their blockchains much faster and cheaper.\n\nGenerally, when blockchains try to increase the number of transactions they can process every second (scalability), they will make tradeoffs in the security or true decentralization of their technology. \n\nCurrently it's not possible to be the best offering in all three: Decentralization, scalability, and security - Unless the chain introduces a major technical innovation. With that being said, chains such as Solana are rapidly growing in market share of decentralized applications being built on it because it prioritizes scalability and security over true decentralization. At a high level, here’s why: Ethereum is meant to be accessibly validated by any random person with an average computer. When it comes to the Solana chain which is handling a lot more data all at once, you’re going to need to get a much nicer and inaccessibly priced computer to validate that chain. Fewer people are able to govern the chain.\n\n\n---\n\nTo recap- the concept of decentralized applications have been around for almost a decade when Ethereum was introduced in a whitepaper. It appears that recently, a palpable number of celebrities have put their names behind crypto technology such as NFTs to usher in newfound speculation and excitement for what these decentralized applications could mean for our online experience in the future.\n\nI didn't get it a week ago, but since writing this piece I’ve developed newfound admiration for the incredible minds who dreamed up mechanisms to build and enforce a democratic digital world.", "timestamp": 1635580503, "digest": "Fkqc5ha8kqhMM15UfbtY8RZGABBb0kc1C32hJYVJzxw", "contributor": "0x4bD52a120B0cB29aC95560D6d6eA393033d9eaE0"}

My grade-school teachers will bug out if they read this.** \n\n**My band was doing a show in Salt Lake City–you know, Mormon utopia in the middle of the desert. Our next gig in Boise had been cancelled for reasons we didn’t entirely understand. When you’re on the road you just kind of run with things, I guess. We decided to hang out in Utah for a couple of days. Somebody said we could “backpack in the watercolor meadows of the Uintahs”. Sounded like a good time. We do retrowave electronica stuff, lots of synthy sounds with flashing lights and voice effects. Everyone’s into the eighties again, even the Mormons it turns out.** \n\n**I still don’t think of myself as a hook-up guy, even after all these years on the road. I’m serious. It’s not something I enjoy or even particularly like. I see hook-ups as one of the rites of being a traveling musician, or maybe even a curse. It’s like how prime ministers have to shake hands with people they don’t necessarily like. I’m a reluctant diplomat of the grunge scene. Everything that guys like David Bowie did make total sense to me. They turned their lives upside-down just to try and find something real. I wonder if they ever found it–when I did, it scared the crap out of me.** \n\n**The first Tinder girl I met in Utah was one of those “it’s for a good cause”-type chicks. I’m not trying to offend anybody, it’s just the only way I can think to describe her. What annoys me about those girls is that they all have the same personality. They’re almost breathless to prove how angry they are about all the *right* things. It makes me feel like everything I know is wrong or something. You just sit there and listen and drown in their syndicated outrage. I swiped right for shallow reasons, yes. The messed-up thing is that I anticipated my annoyance as I glanced at her pics. I was shamelessly undeterred.** \n\n**Her peach spaghetti-strap top swallowed most of my attention, even as she soliloquized about non binary love and dying pandas. (OK, I made that last one up.) Her blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail. It was less a conversation and more a kind of reciting on her part–anyone could’ve been sitting in front of her. I wonder if she would’ve acted differently if she knew who I was. A few hours later, I finished softly somewhere in the bobbing bramble of hair in my lap. It was depressing. She fixed her ponytail in the mirror, checked her phone, then quickly left.** \n\n**I don’t usually let people get to know me too well, not even my bandmates. I mean we drop acid together sometimes, bro-bonding stuff, that kind of thing. That’s about it. Even with girls, I’m a sex-in-the-dark kind of dude. They probably think I’m weird but I never ask. When the peach-top pedant was leaving I gave her one of our albums on cassette tape. It was awkward (“Uh, thanks…?”) but I feel like it’s the best I can do.** \n\n**Somewhere in the discussion of her saintly works, she had mentioned something her uncle had seen in a mall near downtown Salt Lake City. It was like an upright human with amphibian skin or something. Her uncle was a janitor who cleaned floors there late at night. The thing had come out of a basement stairwell, looked at him for a moment, then turned right back around and disappeared. The really crazy thing was that her uncle said he felt some kind of emotion deep in his chest that he never felt before, sort of like how you feel when you lock eyes with a stranger that looks inexplicably familiar. She reported all of this as a joke, rattling it off at blinding speed in her machine-gun dialogue of goodspeak. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, though, even when we started making out.** \n\n**The guys in our band like to joke about the golden thumb–it’s when you start a streak of matching with the city’s hottest women. That’s millennial serendipity at its finest. Isaac had the golden thumb in Topeka and we didn’t see him until Michigan, but in Michigan the algorithms failed him. It works in mysterious ways. When I matched with this Clarissa girl from Provo, I decided Salt Lake City *was* a promised land, or at least my own Topeka. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, nor has that condition of not-knowing changed. But let me back up...**\n\n**Clarissa was one of those one-pic profiles, which is risky. You’re betting that this single picture is so alluring that the opposite swiper needs no further proof of your hotness. In her case, it was a win. She was wearing a black romper striped orange, yellow, green; her hair was blue and cut boyishly short. The obligatory septum piercing made her nose look like a jewelled accessory. Style, attitude, cuteness. Bad-ass but delicate. The interesting part: the picture wasn’t a picture but actually a moving boomerang, one of those images perpetually repeating two seconds of movement.**\n\n**The boomerang showed Clarissa from behind, jogging in-place on a sidewalk with her face looking coyly back into the camera. I don’t need to mention the advantages such an angle affords those of the requisite affinities–but there was something else. Something *else.* There looked to be a kind of independent movement beneath the fabric around her tailbone, like an appendage that was rising and falling as she ran. You could *just* make out the outline. It couldn’t be…**\n\n**I put my phone away and started pumping some beat-mixes to get my mind straight. Things couldn’t be *that* freaky in Utah. My headphones weren’t loud enough to block out the image. The thing that bothered me most was that my attraction to her hadn’t waned; if anything, I felt *more* attracted. Had I been watching too many shapeshifter animes? That was probably the case regardless.** \n\n**Even so, there was no doubt that Clarissa’s festive romper was hiding a full-grown tail–like, none at all.  I watched the boomerang over and over again, turning my phone this way and that. There was no other conclusion. I considered calling my bandmates for brotherly support but in the end opted for privacy. Imagine if they heard I was seeing a girl with a *tail.* Literally a tail dangling down her rear. Her caption read: “Wyoming-raised, Utah-grown. I don’t want to go to Paris or Prague. Take me to a hidden place we can share secrets.” It was just too much.** \n\n**The first time I met Clarissa it was somewhere near State St. It’s hard for me to keep track of the roads because they’re all numbered on a grid based on their proximity to the Mormon temple. Clarissa told me that this system makes it easier to get around and not get lost. She laughed when I disagreed. We ate vegan wraps in one of those generic Salt Lake plazas made of Mexican eateries and Asian stores. Clarissa explained that she ate healthy when it suited her schedule and mood, which made her “a seasonal vegan”. It was summertime in Salt Lake; she wore a dirty-green tank-top and gray denim shorts ripped across the thighs; her hair was bluer than Freddie Mercury’s stage lighting.** \n\n**She was one of those girls who was easy to talk to, but from whom you couldn’t allow your attention to waver. Clarissa was no prolific talker. Instead I got a watchful loner vibe, someone you’d see walking along deserted railroad tracks, someone who considered Bjork their private therapist. I kept imagining how I could bring the topic up without coming across as a total creep. “I didn’t know people in Utah had tails...is that common here?” Gross. Maybe something more personal. “That romper you had on does a lot for your tail.” God, no. I settled on: “Can you show me that running move from your profile?”** \n\n**We were walking along the sidewalks in the glow of the street lamps; night had fallen on the strange city made of numbers. Clarissa’s hand was clasped softly in mine. I kept resisting the temptation to look behind her like an idiot. She was pressing me with questions somewhat absently. When I told her my band’s name was Nineteeneightyfornicate, she lost it and started going through all of our pictures on Instagram. That name was Isaac’s idea, not mine! It did have a nice ring to it.** \n\n**She stopped walking and turned on me suddenly.**\n\n**“You know, don’t you?”**\n\n**“Know–know what?” I stammered lamely.** \n\n**“Oh come off the bullshit, man. You’ve known this whole time.” Staring me frankly in the eyes, she took my hand and ran it along something long, firm, cylindrical on her backside. My heartbeat quickened and a soft moan emitted from my throat. Clarissa giggled and threw my hand away.** \n\n**“Any secrets you’d like to share with me?”** \n\n**I looked at her for a second, processing. “I already told you my dirty band name–”**\n\n**“Right,” she scoffed. “I hope you come up with something better by tomorrow.”**\n\n**She turned and began receding into the jasmine-bordered shadows. I realized that we had been surrounded by cats ever since we started walking. They now trailed her in unison like a row of ducklings down the sidewalk.** \n\n**“I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE A CAT PERSON!” I yelled hopelessly.** \n\n**She laughed and raised a long middle finger into the air without turning around. I sighed and began walking in the other direction back to my hotel. I opened my phone to a new text message from Clarissa. It didn’t say anything; she’d only sent three cat emojis with their tails in the air. I marveled at how little I knew what in the hell was going on. *I just stroked a human tail. That really happened.* And yet, perversely, I couldn’t wait for the next day.** \n\n***....Any secrets you’d like to share with me…***\n\n**I’ll come clean–that night wasn’t the first time I googled “humans with tails”. There had been drunken nights alone that I obsessed over the idea. My thoughts were ransacked by half-humanoids risen from primordial tetrapods, dripping with sea-foam and tails dragging in the sand. I told you I was a weird guy. To this point, the greatest harm all this had done was butcher my online algorithms–I would get ads for kinky Halloween costumes, which routinely raised some eyebrows.** \n\n***She could be a government spy on some troll-job,* I thought to myself. The idea tormented me for several hours. What was worse, I thought, the CIA using search history and store-bought accessories to play with my mind, or the possibility that I had met some kind of hybrid human with a rope of flesh swinging from her backside? The little bit of ganja I had left made my speculations thicker and more confusing. She had to be real. Why would the government waste time mind-fucking a guy from a band named Nineteeneightyfornicate? I went from that to wondering what she ate when she was stoned.**  \n\n**Before I knew it, I was stepping out onto the curb in front of her house in my black knock-off Christian Diors. Who was this profane intruder in Provo? An agent *provo*cateur, I grinned to myself. I didn’t know there could be neighborhoods with trees in the desert. Seemed like the Mormons were pretty good landscapers when they weren’t busy granting all their wives eternal life. Who knew! Clarissa lived in a blue house with a quaint little front porch, one of those places that really has the picture-book mailbox with a perfect red lever pointed upwards.** \n\n**“Were you tailing me earlier?”** \n\n**Clarissa’s voice came out of nowhere, disembodied. I looked around me wildly, my unease ratcheting up several notches. A hand rested on my shoulder from behind; I wheeled around.**  \n\n**“Chill out, freak,” Clarissa laughed. She looked at the tree next to her, brushing off some twigs. “My nest is up *there*.”** \n\n**“Your–nest?”** \n\n**“It’s a joke, heard of those before?”** \n\n**I suddenly noticed she was wearing a yellow Walkman cassette player. We always BS that if we meet a chick with a portable cassette player, we’ll automatically drop to one knee, no questions asked.** \n\n**“So you’re that much of a dork that you listen to cassette tapes in 2020?!”** \n\n**“And you’re telling me you don’t have one on you right now?”**\n\n**Wordlessly, I raised my band’s cassette tape out of my pocket.** \n\n**“Give me that,” she laughed, snatching it out of my hand. “Maybe we *are* a match!”** \n\n**I followed her inside.** \n\n**“My roommates are out for the weekend”–glancing at the couch–”you can just shove all that shit over, sorry. We have beer, lemonade, soda...or maybe you like the harder stuff?”** \n\n**I settled in and tried to relax, taking in what was around me. Nothing odd really. There was a crystal salt lamp whose warm glow looked afloat in the dim room. I could faintly sniff sage. A white cat met my gaze and darted out of sight, desperate to be forgotten.** \n\n**“You don’t get many visit–”** \n\n**The sentence was robbed from my throat. Clarissa was putting a glass of Jack Daniels on the table, naked beside the burgundy lingerie faintly interrupting her skin. I could see the thing in plain sight–it was moving from side to side in a sort of carefree, feline attitude, *curling* back on itself this way and that, hairless and freckled as it tapered to its tip. It was a magnificent tail, too magnificent to be an accident. I closed my eyes and took a shot of the Jack.** \n\n**“I know what you’re thinking,” Clarissa smiled. She sat down next to me, running her hand along my shoulder. “You’re thinking ‘it’s impossible, this can’t actually be happening.’”** \n\n**“You must be psychic,” I shot back dryly.** \n\n**“You’re thinking,” she pressed on, “that science eliminates the possibility of my existence.”**\n\n**I didn’t say anything.** \n\n**“What’s wrong, rock star, you don’t want to play along? I know that you know it all–how they say a human tail is only an abomination of the coccyx, a *vestige* of the behind that we all left behind...right?”**\n\n**“What are you getting at here, Clarissa?”** \n\n**She took a swig of lemonade and rolled the juice around her mouth, her gaze unbroken.** \n\n**“Nothing you haven’t already thought of ten thousand times, but I’ll humor you. If the only reason humans don’t have tails is because of some kind of disabled gene-signal, then the chances of more than one being on the planet is like one in billions. So if you realized there were *others like you*, that hypothesis would suddenly be on very thin ice.”** \n\n**My blood ran cold. I leaned all the way back on the sofa until my eyes were looking at the ceiling. The clustered nerve-endings were firing off in tingles that made it hard for me to resist the urge to let it squirm beneath me. All of my practiced methods for controlling the thing were failing. It was as if it somehow sensed another of its kind and now had license to awaken. She’d caught me by the tail.** \n\n**Clarissa leaned over me, her face close to mine. “Show it to me,” she whispered.** \n\n**No one had set eyes on it outside of my parents; I hadn’t seen them since they put me up for adoption. I sat up, pulled the back of my shirt up and leaned over. Her eyes felt like hot embers across its naked surface. She lifted it between her fingers, held it in her palm, caressed it. I suddenly noticed how heavily I was breathing.**\n\n**“There are many of us, you know,” she said softly.**\n\n**“How many?”**\n\n**Clarissa paused. “I don’t know, to be honest. But a lot. I met them in the genetic labs outside Salt Lake.”** \n\n**“Wait, genetic–”**\n\n**“Shhh!” She put a finger to my lips and straddled me, pulling my hands through her blue hair. “We’ll talk about it later.”** \n\n**I clutched her swaying tail and let its smoothness run through my fingers.** \n\n**“We’re a match,” she giggled, “a match made in some dirty heaven.”** \n\n**That evening, for the first time in my life, I surrendered fully to whatever it is that I am. Clarissa hasn’t left my side since; we’re in Cheyenne now. There’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think: I’ve never been happier–or more deeply, inconsolably frightened.** \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1635580578, "digest": "56648re9YKSnaRoHNgg2OrkLba9o04K-E3bNS5Hdiqc", "contributor": "0xBbb538b84ED95aBa94585c6cE7C2f8790dBfE53B"}

Different from the hierarchical structure of modern enterprises, the flat structure of DAO can maximize the rights and interests of ordinary participants.  The non-intermediary and completely open communication make the barriers to participation extremely low. At the same time, the direct collision of ideas makes the communication generate value, and it is put into practice through DAO Treasury.  All in all, DAO can make many people's dreams come true.  Below I will explore the infinite possibilities of DAO by analyzing the DAO architecture and several possible examples.\n\nRelatively flat architecture (node-link)-an opportunity for ordinary people\n\nThe autonomous function of DAO is realized through governance, and due to its flat structure, each participant can obtain relatively fair participation and decision-making power.  Compared with the wear and tear of thinking caused by distinct levels in modern social organizations, DAO's node-like links can maximize the use of individual ideas.  In the web2 social system, the output productivity of ordinary people's ideas is extremely low, because it is insignificant in the eyes of bystanders and can be almost negligible, and ideas without attention will naturally be lost in the flood of information.  (Unless it is under the attention of the public) In DAO, because each individual is a participant in it, consensus exists directly, ideas directly collide, are gathered and transformed, and efficiency is greatly improved.  As a result, ordinary people can seek opportunities in it, because in DAO, Every Thought Counts. Every sentence of your speech can become productive.\n\nNo intermediary-Fuck algorithm\n\nThe essence of web2's social system is based on algorithms.  As we all know, algorithms can manipulate human cognition, just as information flow can indulge people and weaken their sensitivity to the content.  Therefore, DAO's non-intermediate open-content minimizes the intermediate impact.  After all, people should not be chosen by content.  Fuck algorithm.\n\nOpen-anyone welcome\n\nAs long as you have the most basic physiological functions, you can join a DAO.  The decentralized nature of the DAO itself determines that it can be open like any blockchain, but you don’t have to remember complicated private keys or mnemonic words, and you don’t have to worry about your copy of their books being damaged.  You need a discord and Feishu account, just remember their passwords, after all, ideas don’t need to be carved into the blockchain.  (But if there is on-chain governance, it must be a wallet, but there are also many centralized wallet solutions)\n\nExample-uploader\n\nGenerally speaking, video making is centralized.  But on DAO, everyone can edit, and small can provide ideas. In essence, it is a process of accumulating scattered productivity through DAO.\n\nInstance-writer\n\nWriting things is not practical for much collaboration, but besides the content, many derivatives are still worth discussing.  The organizational form of DAO allows output and reception to be at the same level, which reduces the loss and at the same time brings the heart closer to the heart, forming a benign development.\n\nSummarize:\n\nSince the types of DAOs are relatively abundant now, what we are talking about here should be attributed to social DAO, but the development of DAO in the future should tend to be Lego, similar to the current Defi.  However, the human level is essentially higher than the code, so the author is looking forward to how the ecology derived from DAO will affect the existing web2 ecology in the future.

I wonder if she would’ve acted differently if she knew who I was. A few hours later, I finished softly somewhere in the bobbing bramble of hair in my lap. It was depressing. She fixed her ponytail in the mirror, checked her phone, then quickly left.** \n\n**I don’t usually let people get to know me too well, not even my bandmates. I mean we drop acid together sometimes, bro-bonding stuff, that kind of thing. That’s about it. Even with girls, I’m a sex-in-the-dark kind of dude. They probably think I’m weird but I never ask. When the peach-top pedant was leaving I gave her one of our albums on cassette tape. It was awkward (“Uh, thanks…?”) but I feel like it’s the best I can do.** \n\n**Somewhere in the discussion of her saintly works, she had mentioned something her uncle had seen in a mall near downtown Salt Lake City. It was like an upright human with amphibian skin or something. Her uncle was a janitor who cleaned floors there late at night. The thing had come out of a basement stairwell, looked at him for a moment, then turned right back around and disappeared. The really crazy thing was that her uncle said he felt some kind of emotion deep in his chest that he never felt before, sort of like how you feel when you lock eyes with a stranger that looks inexplicably familiar. She reported all of this as a joke, rattling it off at blinding speed in her machine-gun dialogue of goodspeak. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, though, even when we started making out.** \n\n**The guys in our band like to joke about the golden thumb–it’s when you start a streak of matching with the city’s hottest women. That’s millennial serendipity at its finest. Isaac had the golden thumb in Topeka and we didn’t see him until Michigan, but in Michigan the algorithms failed him. It works in mysterious ways. When I matched with this Clarissa girl from Provo, I decided Salt Lake City *was* a promised land, or at least my own Topeka. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, nor has that condition of not-knowing changed. But let me back up...**\n\n**Clarissa was one of those one-pic profiles, which is risky. You’re betting that this single picture is so alluring that the opposite swiper needs no further proof of your hotness. In her case, it was a win. She was wearing a black romper striped orange, yellow, green; her hair was blue and cut boyishly short. The obligatory septum piercing made her nose look like a jewelled accessory. Style, attitude, cuteness. Bad-ass but delicate. The interesting part: the picture wasn’t a picture but actually a moving boomerang, one of those images perpetually repeating two seconds of movement.**\n\n**The boomerang showed Clarissa from behind, jogging in-place on a sidewalk with her face looking coyly back into the camera. I don’t need to mention the advantages such an angle affords those of the requisite affinities–but there was something else. Something *else.* There looked to be a kind of independent movement beneath the fabric around her tailbone, like an appendage that was rising and falling as she ran. You could *just* make out the outline. It couldn’t be…**\n\n**I put my phone away and started pumping some beat-mixes to get my mind straight. Things couldn’t be *that* freaky in Utah. My headphones weren’t loud enough to block out the image. The thing that bothered me most was that my attraction to her hadn’t waned; if anything, I felt *more* attracted. Had I been watching too many shapeshifter animes? That was probably the case regardless.** \n\n**Even so, there was no doubt that Clarissa’s festive romper was hiding a full-grown tail–like, none at all.  I watched the boomerang over and over again, turning my phone this way and that. There was no other conclusion. I considered calling my bandmates for brotherly support but in the end opted for privacy. Imagine if they heard I was seeing a girl with a *tail.* Literally a tail dangling down her rear. Her caption read: “Wyoming-raised, Utah-grown. I don’t want to go to Paris or Prague. Take me to a hidden place we can share secrets.” It was just too much.** \n\n**The first time I met Clarissa it was somewhere near State St. It’s hard for me to keep track of the roads because they’re all numbered on a grid based on their proximity to the Mormon temple. Clarissa told me that this system makes it easier to get around and not get lost. She laughed when I disagreed. We ate vegan wraps in one of those generic Salt Lake plazas made of Mexican eateries and Asian stores. Clarissa explained that she ate healthy when it suited her schedule and mood, which made her “a seasonal vegan”. It was summertime in Salt Lake; she wore a dirty-green tank-top and gray denim shorts ripped across the thighs; her hair was bluer than Freddie Mercury’s stage lighting.** \n\n**She was one of those girls who was easy to talk to, but from whom you couldn’t allow your attention to waver. Clarissa was no prolific talker. Instead I got a watchful loner vibe, someone you’d see walking along deserted railroad tracks, someone who considered Bjork their private therapist. I kept imagining how I could bring the topic up without coming across as a total creep. “I didn’t know people in Utah had tails...is that common here?” Gross. Maybe something more personal. “That romper you had on does a lot for your tail.” God, no. I settled on: “Can you show me that running move from your profile?”** \n\n**We were walking along the sidewalks in the glow of the street lamps; night had fallen on the strange city made of numbers. Clarissa’s hand was clasped softly in mine. I kept resisting the temptation to look behind her like an idiot. She was pressing me with questions somewhat absently. When I told her my band’s name was Nineteeneightyfornicate, she lost it and started going through all of our pictures on Instagram. That name was Isaac’s idea, not mine! It did have a nice ring to it.** \n\n**She stopped walking and turned on me suddenly.**\n\n**“You know, don’t you?”**\n\n**“Know–know what?” I stammered lamely.** \n\n**“Oh come off the bullshit, man. You’ve known this whole time.” Staring me frankly in the eyes, she took my hand and ran it along something long, firm, cylindrical on her backside. My heartbeat quickened and a soft moan emitted from my throat. Clarissa giggled and threw my hand away.** \n\n**“Any secrets you’d like to share with me?”** \n\n**I looked at her for a second, processing. “I already told you my dirty band name–”**\n\n**“Right,” she scoffed. “I hope you come up with something better by tomorrow.”**\n\n**She turned and began receding into the jasmine-bordered shadows. I realized that we had been surrounded by cats ever since we started walking. They now trailed her in unison like a row of ducklings down the sidewalk.** \n\n**“I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE A CAT PERSON!” I yelled hopelessly.** \n\n**She laughed and raised a long middle finger into the air without turning around. I sighed and began walking in the other direction back to my hotel. I opened my phone to a new text message from Clarissa. It didn’t say anything; she’d only sent three cat emojis with their tails in the air. I marveled at how little I knew what in the hell was going on. *I just stroked a human tail. That really happened.* And yet, perversely, I couldn’t wait for the next day.** \n\n***....Any secrets you’d like to share with me…***\n\n**I’ll come clean–that night wasn’t the first time I googled “humans with tails”. There had been drunken nights alone that I obsessed over the idea. My thoughts were ransacked by half-humanoids risen from primordial tetrapods, dripping with sea-foam and tails dragging in the sand. I told you I was a weird guy. To this point, the greatest harm all this had done was butcher my online algorithms–I would get ads for kinky Halloween costumes, which routinely raised some eyebrows.** \n\n***She could be a government spy on some troll-job,* I thought to myself. The idea tormented me for several hours. What was worse, I thought, the CIA using search history and store-bought accessories to play with my mind, or the possibility that I had met some kind of hybrid human with a rope of flesh swinging from her backside? The little bit of ganja I had left made my speculations thicker and more confusing. She had to be real. Why would the government waste time mind-fucking a guy from a band named Nineteeneightyfornicate? I went from that to wondering what she ate when she was stoned.**  \n\n**Before I knew it, I was stepping out onto the curb in front of her house in my black knock-off Christian Diors. Who was this profane intruder in Provo? An agent *provo*cateur, I grinned to myself. I didn’t know there could be neighborhoods with trees in the desert. Seemed like the Mormons were pretty good landscapers when they weren’t busy granting all their wives eternal life. Who knew! Clarissa lived in a blue house with a quaint little front porch, one of those places that really has the picture-book mailbox with a perfect red lever pointed upwards.** \n\n**“Were you tailing me earlier?”** \n\n**Clarissa’s voice came out of nowhere, disembodied. I looked around me wildly, my unease ratcheting up several notches. A hand rested on my shoulder from behind; I wheeled around.**  \n\n**“Chill out, freak,” Clarissa laughed. She looked at the tree next to her, brushing off some twigs. “My nest is up *there*.”** \n\n**“Your–nest?”** \n\n**“It’s a joke, heard of those before?”** \n\n**I suddenly noticed she was wearing a yellow Walkman cassette player. We always BS that if we meet a chick with a portable cassette player, we’ll automatically drop to one knee, no questions asked.** \n\n**“So you’re that much of a dork that you listen to cassette tapes in 2020?!”** \n\n**“And you’re telling me you don’t have one on you right now?”**\n\n**Wordlessly, I raised my band’s cassette tape out of my pocket.** \n\n**“Give me that,” she laughed, snatching it out of my hand. “Maybe we *are* a match!”** \n\n**I followed her inside.** \n\n**“My roommates are out for the weekend”–glancing at the couch–”you can just shove all that shit over, sorry. We have beer, lemonade, soda...or maybe you like the harder stuff?”** \n\n**I settled in and tried to relax, taking in what was around me. Nothing odd really. There was a crystal salt lamp whose warm glow looked afloat in the dim room. I could faintly sniff sage. A white cat met my gaze and darted out of sight, desperate to be forgotten.** \n\n**“You don’t get many visit–”** \n\n**The sentence was robbed from my throat. Clarissa was putting a glass of Jack Daniels on the table, naked beside the burgundy lingerie faintly interrupting her skin. I could see the thing in plain sight–it was moving from side to side in a sort of carefree, feline attitude, *curling* back on itself this way and that, hairless and freckled as it tapered to its tip. It was a magnificent tail, too magnificent to be an accident. I closed my eyes and took a shot of the Jack.** \n\n**“I know what you’re thinking,” Clarissa smiled. She sat down next to me, running her hand along my shoulder. “You’re thinking ‘it’s impossible, this can’t actually be happening.’”** \n\n**“You must be psychic,” I shot back dryly.** \n\n**“You’re thinking,” she pressed on, “that science eliminates the possibility of my existence.”**\n\n**I didn’t say anything.** \n\n**“What’s wrong, rock star, you don’t want to play along? I know that you know it all–how they say a human tail is only an abomination of the coccyx, a *vestige* of the behind that we all left behind...right?”**\n\n**“What are you getting at here, Clarissa?”** \n\n**She took a swig of lemonade and rolled the juice around her mouth, her gaze unbroken.** \n\n**“Nothing you haven’t already thought of ten thousand times, but I’ll humor you. If the only reason humans don’t have tails is because of some kind of disabled gene-signal, then the chances of more than one being on the planet is like one in billions. So if you realized there were *others like you*, that hypothesis would suddenly be on very thin ice.”** \n\n**My blood ran cold. I leaned all the way back on the sofa until my eyes were looking at the ceiling. The clustered nerve-endings were firing off in tingles that made it hard for me to resist the urge to let it squirm beneath me. All of my practiced methods for controlling the thing were failing. It was as if it somehow sensed another of its kind and now had license to awaken. She’d caught me by the tail.** \n\n**Clarissa leaned over me, her face close to mine. “Show it to me,” she whispered.** \n\n**No one had set eyes on it outside of my parents; I hadn’t seen them since they put me up for adoption. I sat up, pulled the back of my shirt up and leaned over. Her eyes felt like hot embers across its naked surface. She lifted it between her fingers, held it in her palm, caressed it. I suddenly noticed how heavily I was breathing.**\n\n**“There are many of us, you know,” she said softly.**\n\n**“How many?”**\n\n**Clarissa paused. “I don’t know, to be honest. But a lot. I met them in the genetic labs outside Salt Lake.”** \n\n**“Wait, genetic–”**\n\n**“Shhh!” She put a finger to my lips and straddled me, pulling my hands through her blue hair. “We’ll talk about it later.”** \n\n**I clutched her swaying tail and let its smoothness run through my fingers.** \n\n**“We’re a match,” she giggled, “a match made in some dirty heaven.”** \n\n**That evening, for the first time in my life, I surrendered fully to whatever it is that I am. Clarissa hasn’t left my side since; we’re in Cheyenne now. There’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think: I’ve never been happier–or more deeply, inconsolably frightened.** \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1635582484, "digest": "56648re9YKSnaRoHNgg2OrkLba9o04K-E3bNS5Hdiqc", "contributor": "0xBbb538b84ED95aBa94585c6cE7C2f8790dBfE53B"}

Everyone’s into the eighties again, even the Mormons it turns out.**\n\n**I still don’t think of myself as a hook-up guy, even after all these years on the road. I’m serious. It’s not something I enjoy or even particularly like. I see hook-ups as one of the rites of being a traveling musician, or maybe even a curse. It’s like how prime ministers have to shake hands with people they don’t necessarily like. I’m a reluctant diplomat of the grunge scene. Everything that guys like David Bowie did make total sense to me. They turned their lives upside-down just to try and find something real. I wonder if they ever found it–when I did, it scared the crap out of me.**\n\n**The first Tinder girl I met in Utah was one of those “it’s for a good cause”-type chicks. I’m not trying to offend anybody, it’s just the only way I can think to describe her. What annoys me about those girls is that they all have the same personality. They’re almost breathless to prove how angry they are about all the *right* things. It makes me feel like everything I know is wrong or something. You just sit there and listen and drown in their syndicated outrage. I swiped right for shallow reasons, yes. The messed-up thing is that I anticipated my annoyance as I glanced at her pics. I was shamelessly undeterred.**\n\n**Her peach spaghetti-strap top swallowed most of my attention, even as she soliloquized about non binary love and dying pandas. (OK, I made that last one up.) Her blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail. It was less a conversation and more a kind of reciting on her part–anyone could’ve been sitting in front of her. I wonder if she would’ve acted differently if she knew who I was. A few hours later, I finished softly somewhere in the bobbing bramble of hair in my lap. It was depressing. She fixed her ponytail in the mirror, checked her phone, then quickly left.**\n\n**I don’t usually let people get to know me too well, not even my bandmates. I mean we drop acid together sometimes, bro-bonding stuff, that kind of thing. That’s about it. Even with girls, I’m a sex-in-the-dark kind of dude. They probably think I’m weird but I never ask. When the peach-top pedant was leaving I gave her one of our albums on cassette tape. It was awkward (“Uh, thanks…?”) but I feel like it’s the best I can do.**\n\n**Somewhere in the discussion of her saintly works, she had mentioned something her uncle had seen in a mall near downtown Salt Lake City. It was like an upright human with amphibian skin or something. Her uncle was a janitor who cleaned floors there late at night. The thing had come out of a basement stairwell, looked at him for a moment, then turned right back around and disappeared. The really crazy thing was that her uncle said he felt some kind of emotion deep in his chest that he never felt before, sort of like how you feel when you lock eyes with a stranger that looks inexplicably familiar. She reported all of this as a joke, rattling it off at blinding speed in her machine-gun dialogue of goodspeak. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, though, even when we started making out.**\n\n**The guys in our band like to joke about the golden thumb–it’s when you start a streak of matching with the city’s hottest women. That’s millennial serendipity at its finest. Isaac had the golden thumb in Topeka and we didn’t see him until Michigan, but in Michigan the algorithms failed him. It works in mysterious ways. When I matched with this Clarissa girl from Provo, I decided Salt Lake City *was* a promised land, or at least my own Topeka. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, nor has that condition of not-knowing changed. But let me back up...**\n\n**Clarissa was one of those one-pic profiles, which is risky. You’re betting that this single picture is so alluring that the opposite swiper needs no further proof of your hotness. In her case, it was a win. She was wearing a black romper striped orange, yellow, green; her hair was blue and cut boyishly short. The obligatory septum piercing made her nose look like a jewelled accessory. Style, attitude, cuteness. Bad-ass but delicate. The interesting part: the picture wasn’t a picture but actually a moving boomerang, one of those images perpetually repeating two seconds of movement.**\n\n**The boomerang showed Clarissa from behind, jogging in-place on a sidewalk with her face looking coyly back into the camera. I don’t need to mention the advantages such an angle affords those of the requisite affinities–but there was something else. Something *else.* There looked to be a kind of independent movement beneath the fabric around her tailbone, like an appendage that was rising and falling as she ran. You could *just* make out the outline. It couldn’t be…**\n\n**I put my phone away and started pumping some beat-mixes to get my mind straight. Things couldn’t be *that* freaky in Utah. My headphones weren’t loud enough to block out the image. The thing that bothered me most was that my attraction to her hadn’t waned; if anything, I felt *more* attracted. Had I been watching too many shapeshifter animes? That was probably the case regardless.**\n\n**Even so, there was no doubt that Clarissa’s festive romper was hiding a full-grown tail–like, none at all.  I watched the boomerang over and over again, turning my phone this way and that. There was no other conclusion. I considered calling my bandmates for brotherly support but in the end opted for privacy. Imagine if they heard I was seeing a girl with a *tail.* Literally a tail dangling down her rear. Her caption read: “Wyoming-raised, Utah-grown. I don’t want to go to Paris or Prague. Take me to a hidden place we can share secrets.” It was just too much.**\n\n**The first time I met Clarissa it was somewhere near State St. It’s hard for me to keep track of the roads because they’re all numbered on a grid based on their proximity to the Mormon temple. Clarissa told me that this system makes it easier to get around and not get lost. She laughed when I disagreed. We ate vegan wraps in one of those generic Salt Lake plazas made of Mexican eateries and Asian stores. Clarissa explained that she ate healthy when it suited her schedule and mood, which made her “a seasonal vegan”. It was summertime in Salt Lake; she wore a dirty-green tank-top and gray denim shorts ripped across the thighs; her hair was bluer than Freddie Mercury’s stage lighting.**\n\n**She was one of those girls who was easy to talk to, but from whom you couldn’t allow your attention to waver. Clarissa was no prolific talker. Instead I got a watchful loner vibe, someone you’d see walking along deserted railroad tracks, someone who considered Bjork their private therapist. I kept imagining how I could bring the topic up without coming across as a total creep. “I didn’t know people in Utah had tails...is that common here?” Gross. Maybe something more personal. “That romper you had on does a lot for your tail.” God, no. I settled on: “Can you show me that running move from your profile?”**\n\n**We were walking along the sidewalks in the glow of the street lamps; night had fallen on the strange city made of numbers. Clarissa’s hand was clasped softly in mine. I kept resisting the temptation to look behind her like an idiot. She was pressing me with questions somewhat absently. When I told her my band’s name was Nineteeneightyfornicate, she lost it and started going through all of our pictures on Instagram. That name was Isaac’s idea, not mine! It did have a nice ring to it.**\n\n**She stopped walking and turned on me suddenly.**\n\n**“You know, don’t you?”**\n\n**“Know–know what?” I stammered lamely.**\n\n**“Oh come off the bullshit, man. You’ve known this whole time.” Staring me frankly in the eyes, she took my hand and ran it along something long, firm, cylindrical on her backside. My heartbeat quickened and a soft moan emitted from my throat. Clarissa giggled and threw my hand away.**\n\n**“Any secrets you’d like to share with me?”**\n\n**I looked at her for a second, processing. “I already told you my dirty band name–”**\n\n**“Right,” she scoffed. “I hope you come up with something better by tomorrow.”**\n\n**She turned and began receding into the jasmine-bordered shadows. I realized that we had been surrounded by cats ever since we started walking. They now trailed her in unison like a row of ducklings down the sidewalk.**\n\n**“I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE A CAT PERSON!” I yelled hopelessly.**\n\n**She laughed and raised a long middle finger into the air without turning around. I sighed and began walking in the other direction back to my hotel. I opened my phone to a new text message from Clarissa. It didn’t say anything; she’d only sent three cat emojis with their tails in the air. I marveled at how little I knew what in the hell was going on. *I just stroked a human tail. That really happened.* And yet, perversely, I couldn’t wait for the next day.**\n\n***....Any secrets you’d like to share with me…***\n\n**I’ll come clean–that night wasn’t the first time I googled “humans with tails”. There had been drunken nights alone that I obsessed over the idea. My thoughts were ransacked by half-humanoids risen from primordial tetrapods, dripping with sea-foam and tails dragging in the sand. I told you I was a weird guy. To this point, the greatest harm all this had done was butcher my online algorithms–I would get ads for kinky Halloween costumes, which routinely raised some eyebrows.**\n\n***She could be a government spy on some troll-job,* I thought to myself. The idea tormented me for several hours. What was worse, I thought, the CIA using search history and store-bought accessories to play with my mind, or the possibility that I had met some kind of hybrid human with a rope of flesh swinging from her backside? The little bit of ganja I had left made my speculations thicker and more confusing. She had to be real. Why would the government waste time mind-fucking a guy from a band named Nineteeneightyfornicate? I went from that to wondering what she ate when she was stoned.**\n\n**Before I knew it, I was stepping out onto the curb in front of her house in my black knock-off Christian Diors. Who was this profane intruder in Provo? An agent *provo*cateur, I grinned to myself. I didn’t know there could be neighborhoods with trees in the desert. Seemed like the Mormons were pretty good landscapers when they weren’t busy granting all their wives eternal life. Who knew! Clarissa lived in a blue house with a quaint little front porch, one of those places that really has the picture-book mailbox with a perfect red lever pointed upwards.**\n\n**“Were you tailing me earlier?”**\n\n**Clarissa’s voice came out of nowhere, disembodied. I looked around me wildly, my unease ratcheting up several notches. A hand rested on my shoulder from behind; I wheeled around.**\n\n**“Chill out, freak,” Clarissa laughed. She looked at the tree next to her, brushing off some twigs. “My nest is up *there*.”**\n\n**“Your–nest?”**\n\n**“It’s a joke, heard of those before?”**\n\n**I suddenly noticed she was wearing a yellow Walkman cassette player. We always BS that if we meet a chick with a portable cassette player, we’ll automatically drop to one knee, no questions asked.**\n\n**“So you’re that much of a dork that you listen to cassette tapes in 2020?!”**\n\n**“And you’re telling me you don’t have one on you right now?”**\n\n**Wordlessly, I raised my band’s cassette tape out of my pocket.**\n\n**“Give me that,” she laughed, snatching it out of my hand. “Maybe we *are* a match!”**\n\n**I followed her inside.**\n\n**“My roommates are out for the weekend”–glancing at the couch–”you can just shove all that shit over, sorry. We have beer, lemonade, soda...or maybe you like the harder stuff?”**\n\n**I settled in and tried to relax, taking in what was around me. Nothing odd really. There was a crystal salt lamp whose warm glow looked afloat in the dim room. I could faintly sniff sage. A white cat met my gaze and darted out of sight, desperate to be forgotten.**\n\n**“You don’t get many visit–”**\n\n**The sentence was robbed from my throat. Clarissa was putting a glass of Jack Daniels on the table, naked beside the burgundy lingerie faintly interrupting her skin. I could see the thing in plain sight–it was moving from side to side in a sort of carefree, feline attitude, *curling* back on itself this way and that, hairless and freckled as it tapered to its tip. It was a magnificent tail, too magnificent to be an accident. I closed my eyes and took a shot of the Jack.**\n\n**“I know what you’re thinking,” Clarissa smiled. She sat down next to me, running her hand along my shoulder. “You’re thinking ‘it’s impossible, this can’t actually be happening.’”**\n\n**“You must be psychic,” I shot back dryly.**\n\n**“You’re thinking,” she pressed on, “that science eliminates the possibility of my existence.”**\n\n**I didn’t say anything.**\n\n**“What’s wrong, rock star, you don’t want to play along? I know that you know it all–how they say a human tail is only an abomination of the coccyx, a *vestige* of the behind that we all left behind...right?”**\n\n**“What are you getting at here, Clarissa?”**\n\n**She took a swig of lemonade and rolled the juice around her mouth, her gaze unbroken.**\n\n**“Nothing you haven’t already thought of ten thousand times, but I’ll humor you. If the only reason humans don’t have tails is because of some kind of disabled gene-signal, then the chances of more than one being on the planet is like one in billions. So if you realized there were *others like you*, that hypothesis would suddenly be on very thin ice.”**\n\n**My blood ran cold. I leaned all the way back on the sofa until my eyes were looking at the ceiling. The clustered nerve-endings were firing off in tingles that made it hard for me to resist the urge to let it squirm beneath me. All of my practiced methods for controlling the thing were failing. It was as if it somehow sensed another of its kind and now had license to awaken. She’d caught me by the tail.**\n\n**Clarissa leaned over me, her face close to mine. “Show it to me,” she whispered.**\n\n**No one had set eyes on it outside of my parents; I hadn’t seen them since they put me up for adoption. I sat up, pulled the back of my shirt up and leaned over. Her eyes felt like hot embers across its naked surface. She lifted it between her fingers, held it in her palm, caressed it. I suddenly noticed how heavily I was breathing.**\n\n**“There are many of us, you know,” she said softly.**\n\n**“How many?”**\n\n**Clarissa paused. “I don’t know, to be honest. But a lot. I met them in the genetic labs outside Salt Lake.”**\n\n**“Wait, genetic–”**\n\n**“Shhh!” She put a finger to my lips and straddled me, pulling my hands through her blue hair. “We’ll talk about it later.”**\n\n**I clutched her swaying tail and let its smoothness run through my fingers.**\n\n**“We’re a match,” she giggled, “a match made in some dirty heaven.”**\n\n**That evening, for the first time in my life, I surrendered fully to whatever it is that I am. Clarissa hasn’t left my side since; we’re in Cheyenne now. There’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think: I’ve never been happier–or more deeply, inconsolably frightened.**\n\nethereum://\n\n[https://rarible.com/token/0xb66a603f4cfe17e3d27b87a8bfcad319856518b8:84902693470525082384740468196227512365765395370008326743476849522106481770497?tab=owners](https://rarible.com/token/0xb66a603f4cfe17e3d27b87a8bfcad319856518b8:84902693470525082384740468196227512365765395370008326743476849522106481770497?tab=owners)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635584591, "digest": "56648re9YKSnaRoHNgg2OrkLba9o04K-E3bNS5Hdiqc", "contributor": "0xBbb538b84ED95aBa94585c6cE7C2f8790dBfE53B"}

And the scariest. I know it sounds stupid and indulgent to say that, especially coming from another hetero-normative dude in black Christian Diors like me. (Whatever, they were knock-offs.) But given the extraordinary features of this interaction, along with its consequences for how people think of themselves, I really don’t think it’s an exaggeration. All of this is true by the way. I don’t have the time to make any of this up, and frankly I sucked pretty bad in Language Arts.

If the only reason humans don’t have tails is because of some kind of disabled gene-signal, then the chances of more than one being on the planet is like one in billions. So if you realized there were *others like you*, that hypothesis would suddenly be on very thin ice.”**\n\n**My blood ran cold. I leaned all the way back on the sofa until my eyes were looking at the ceiling. The clustered nerve-endings were firing off in tingles that made it hard for me to resist the urge to let it squirm beneath me. All of my practiced methods for controlling the thing were failing. It was as if it somehow sensed another of its kind and now had license to awaken. She’d caught me by the tail.**\n\n**Clarissa leaned over me, her face close to mine. “Show it to me,” she whispered.**\n\n**No one had set eyes on it outside of my parents; I hadn’t seen them since they put me up for adoption. I sat up, pulled the back of my shirt up and leaned over. Her eyes felt like hot embers across its naked surface. She lifted it between her fingers, held it in her palm, caressed it. I suddenly noticed how heavily I was breathing.**\n\n**“There are many of us, you know,” she said softly.**\n\n**“How many?”**\n\n**Clarissa paused. “I don’t know, to be honest. But a lot. I met them in the genetic labs outside Salt Lake.”**\n\n**“Wait, genetic–”**\n\n**“Shhh!” She put a finger to my lips and straddled me, pulling my hands through her blue hair. “We’ll talk about it later.”**\n\n**I clutched her swaying tail and let its smoothness run through my fingers.**\n\n**“We’re a match,” she giggled, “a match made in some dirty heaven.”**\n\n**That evening, for the first time in my life, I surrendered fully to whatever it is that I am. Clarissa hasn’t left my side since; we’re in Cheyenne now. There’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think: I’ve never been happier–or more deeply, inconsolably frightened.**", "timestamp": 1635584710, "digest": "56648re9YKSnaRoHNgg2OrkLba9o04K-E3bNS5Hdiqc", "contributor": "0xBbb538b84ED95aBa94585c6cE7C2f8790dBfE53B"}

{"id": "zri1aL7pq5JlkW_RqlxGLEUe5_xX2TkvgnGgSX_pwV0", "title": "1SWIPEAWAY", "body": "**I think it hit me at some point during the Uber ride to her house: this could be the most important hook-up in human history. And the scariest. I know it sounds stupid and indulgent to say that, especially coming from another hetero-normative dude in black Christian Diors like me. (Whatever, they were knock-offs.) But given the extraordinary features of this interaction, along with its consequences for how people think of themselves, I really don’t think it’s an exaggeration. All of this is true by the way. I don’t have the time to make any of this up, and frankly I sucked pretty bad in Language Arts. My grade-school teachers will bug out if they read this.**\n\n**My band was doing a show in Salt Lake City–you know, Mormon utopia in the middle of the desert. Our next gig in Boise had been cancelled for reasons we didn’t entirely understand. When you’re on the road you just kind of run with things, I guess. We decided to hang out in Utah for a couple of days. Somebody said we could “backpack in the watercolor meadows of the Uintahs”. Sounded like a good time. We do retrowave electronica stuff, lots of synthy sounds with flashing lights and voice effects. Everyone’s into the eighties again, even the Mormons it turns out.**\n\n**I still don’t think of myself as a hook-up guy, even after all these years on the road. I’m serious. It’s not something I enjoy or even particularly like. I see hook-ups as one of the rites of being a traveling musician, or maybe even a curse. It’s like how prime ministers have to shake hands with people they don’t necessarily like. I’m a reluctant diplomat of the grunge scene. Everything that guys like David Bowie did make total sense to me. They turned their lives upside-down just to try and find something real. I wonder if they ever found it–when I did, it scared the crap out of me.**\n\n**The first Tinder girl I met in Utah was one of those “it’s for a good cause”-type chicks. I’m not trying to offend anybody, it’s just the only way I can think to describe her. What annoys me about those girls is that they all have the same personality. They’re almost breathless to prove how angry they are about all the *right* things. It makes me feel like everything I know is wrong or something. You just sit there and listen and drown in their syndicated outrage. I swiped right for shallow reasons, yes. The messed-up thing is that I anticipated my annoyance as I glanced at her pics. I was shamelessly undeterred.**\n\n**Her peach spaghetti-strap top swallowed most of my attention, even as she soliloquized about non binary love and dying pandas. (OK, I made that last one up.) Her blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail. It was less a conversation and more a kind of reciting on her part–anyone could’ve been sitting in front of her. I wonder if she would’ve acted differently if she knew who I was. A few hours later, I finished softly somewhere in the bobbing bramble of hair in my lap. It was depressing. She fixed her ponytail in the mirror, checked her phone, then quickly left.**\n\n**I don’t usually let people get to know me too well, not even my bandmates. I mean we drop acid together sometimes, bro-bonding stuff, that kind of thing. That’s about it. Even with girls, I’m a sex-in-the-dark kind of dude. They probably think I’m weird but I never ask. When the peach-top pedant was leaving I gave her one of our albums on cassette tape. It was awkward (“Uh, thanks…?”) but I feel like it’s the best I can do.**\n\n**Somewhere in the discussion of her saintly works, she had mentioned something her uncle had seen in a mall near downtown Salt Lake City. It was like an upright human with amphibian skin or something. Her uncle was a janitor who cleaned floors there late at night. The thing had come out of a basement stairwell, looked at him for a moment, then turned right back around and disappeared. The really crazy thing was that her uncle said he felt some kind of emotion deep in his chest that he never felt before, sort of like how you feel when you lock eyes with a stranger that looks inexplicably familiar. She reported all of this as a joke, rattling it off at blinding speed in her machine-gun dialogue of goodspeak. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, though, even when we started making out.**\n\n**The guys in our band like to joke about the golden thumb–it’s when you start a streak of matching with the city’s hottest women. That’s millennial serendipity at its finest. Isaac had the golden thumb in Topeka and we didn’t see him until Michigan, but in Michigan the algorithms failed him. It works in mysterious ways. When I matched with this Clarissa girl from Provo, I decided Salt Lake City *was* a promised land, or at least my own Topeka. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, nor has that condition of not-knowing changed. But let me back up...**\n\n**Clarissa was one of those one-pic profiles, which is risky. You’re betting that this single picture is so alluring that the opposite swiper needs no further proof of your hotness. In her case, it was a win. She was wearing a black romper striped orange, yellow, green; her hair was blue and cut boyishly short. The obligatory septum piercing made her nose look like a jewelled accessory. Style, attitude, cuteness. Bad-ass but delicate. The interesting part: the picture wasn’t a picture but actually a moving boomerang, one of those images perpetually repeating two seconds of movement.**\n\n**The boomerang showed Clarissa from behind, jogging in-place on a sidewalk with her face looking coyly back into the camera. I don’t need to mention the advantages such an angle affords those of the requisite affinities–but there was something else. Something *else.* There looked to be a kind of independent movement beneath the fabric around her tailbone, like an appendage that was rising and falling as she ran. You could *just* make out the outline. It couldn’t be…**\n\n**I put my phone away and started pumping some beat-mixes to get my mind straight. Things couldn’t be *that* freaky in Utah. My headphones weren’t loud enough to block out the image. The thing that bothered me most was that my attraction to her hadn’t waned; if anything, I felt *more* attracted. Had I been watching too many shapeshifter animes? That was probably the case regardless.**\n\n**Even so, there was no doubt that Clarissa’s festive romper was hiding a full-grown tail–like, none at all.  I watched the boomerang over and over again, turning my phone this way and that. There was no other conclusion. I considered calling my bandmates for brotherly support but in the end opted for privacy. Imagine if they heard I was seeing a girl with a *tail.* Literally a tail dangling down her rear. Her caption read: “Wyoming-raised, Utah-grown. I don’t want to go to Paris or Prague. Take me to a hidden place we can share secrets.” It was just too much.**\n\n**The first time I met Clarissa it was somewhere near State St. It’s hard for me to keep track of the roads because they’re all numbered on a grid based on their proximity to the Mormon temple. Clarissa told me that this system makes it easier to get around and not get lost. She laughed when I disagreed. We ate vegan wraps in one of those generic Salt Lake plazas made of Mexican eateries and Asian stores. Clarissa explained that she ate healthy when it suited her schedule and mood, which made her “a seasonal vegan”. It was summertime in Salt Lake; she wore a dirty-green tank-top and gray denim shorts ripped across the thighs; her hair was bluer than Freddie Mercury’s stage lighting.**\n\n**She was one of those girls who was easy to talk to, but from whom you couldn’t allow your attention to waver. Clarissa was no prolific talker. Instead I got a watchful loner vibe, someone you’d see walking along deserted railroad tracks, someone who considered Bjork their private therapist. I kept imagining how I could bring the topic up without coming across as a total creep. “I didn’t know people in Utah had tails...is that common here?” Gross. Maybe something more personal. “That romper you had on does a lot for your tail.” God, no. I settled on: “Can you show me that running move from your profile?”**\n\n**We were walking along the sidewalks in the glow of the street lamps; night had fallen on the strange city made of numbers. Clarissa’s hand was clasped softly in mine. I kept resisting the temptation to look behind her like an idiot. She was pressing me with questions somewhat absently. When I told her my band’s name was Nineteeneightyfornicate, she lost it and started going through all of our pictures on Instagram. That name was Isaac’s idea, not mine! It did have a nice ring to it.**\n\n**She stopped walking and turned on me suddenly.**\n\n**“You know, don’t you?”**\n\n**“Know–know what?” I stammered lamely.**\n\n**“Oh come off the bullshit, man. You’ve known this whole time.” Staring me frankly in the eyes, she took my hand and ran it along something long, firm, cylindrical on her backside. My heartbeat quickened and a soft moan emitted from my throat. Clarissa giggled and threw my hand away.**\n\n**“Any secrets you’d like to share with me?”**\n\n**I looked at her for a second, processing. “I already told you my dirty band name–”**\n\n**“Right,” she scoffed. “I hope you come up with something better by tomorrow.”**\n\n**She turned and began receding into the jasmine-bordered shadows. I realized that we had been surrounded by cats ever since we started walking. They now trailed her in unison like a row of ducklings down the sidewalk.**\n\n**“I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE A CAT PERSON!” I yelled hopelessly.**\n\n**She laughed and raised a long middle finger into the air without turning around. I sighed and began walking in the other direction back to my hotel. I opened my phone to a new text message from Clarissa. It didn’t say anything; she’d only sent three cat emojis with their tails in the air. I marveled at how little I knew what in the hell was going on. *I just stroked a human tail. That really happened.* And yet, perversely, I couldn’t wait for the next day.**\n\n***....Any secrets you’d like to share with me…***\n\n**I’ll come clean–that night wasn’t the first time I googled “humans with tails”. There had been drunken nights alone that I obsessed over the idea. My thoughts were ransacked by half-humanoids risen from primordial tetrapods, dripping with sea-foam and tails dragging in the sand. I told you I was a weird guy. To this point, the greatest harm all this had done was butcher my online algorithms–I would get ads for kinky Halloween costumes, which routinely raised some eyebrows.**\n\n***She could be a government spy on some troll-job,* I thought to myself. The idea tormented me for several hours. What was worse, I thought, the CIA using search history and store-bought accessories to play with my mind, or the possibility that I had met some kind of hybrid human with a rope of flesh swinging from her backside? The little bit of ganja I had left made my speculations thicker and more confusing. She had to be real. Why would the government waste time mind-fucking a guy from a band named Nineteeneightyfornicate? I went from that to wondering what she ate when she was stoned.**\n\n**Before I knew it, I was stepping out onto the curb in front of her house in my black knock-off Christian Diors. Who was this profane intruder in Provo? An agent *provo*cateur, I grinned to myself. I didn’t know there could be neighborhoods with trees in the desert. Seemed like the Mormons were pretty good landscapers when they weren’t busy granting all their wives eternal life. Who knew! Clarissa lived in a blue house with a quaint little front porch, one of those places that really has the picture-book mailbox with a perfect red lever pointed upwards.**\n\n**“Were you tailing me earlier?”**\n\n**Clarissa’s voice came out of nowhere, disembodied. I looked around me wildly, my unease ratcheting up several notches. A hand rested on my shoulder from behind; I wheeled around.**\n\n**“Chill out, freak,” Clarissa laughed. She looked at the tree next to her, brushing off some twigs. “My nest is up *there*.”**\n\n**“Your–nest?”**\n\n**“It’s a joke, heard of those before?”**\n\n**I suddenly noticed she was wearing a yellow Walkman cassette player. We always BS that if we meet a chick with a portable cassette player, we’ll automatically drop to one knee, no questions asked.**\n\n**“So you’re that much of a dork that you listen to cassette tapes in 2020?!”**\n\n**“And you’re telling me you don’t have one on you right now?”**\n\n**Wordlessly, I raised my band’s cassette tape out of my pocket.**\n\n**“Give me that,” she laughed, snatching it out of my hand. “Maybe we *are* a match!”**\n\n**I followed her inside.**\n\n**“My roommates are out for the weekend”–glancing at the couch–”you can just shove all that shit over, sorry. We have beer, lemonade, soda...or maybe you like the harder stuff?”**\n\n**I settled in and tried to relax, taking in what was around me. Nothing odd really. There was a crystal salt lamp whose warm glow looked afloat in the dim room. I could faintly sniff sage. A white cat met my gaze and darted out of sight, desperate to be forgotten.**\n\n**“You don’t get many visit–”**\n\n**The sentence was robbed from my throat. Clarissa was putting a glass of Jack Daniels on the table, naked beside the burgundy lingerie faintly interrupting her skin. I could see the thing in plain sight–it was moving from side to side in a sort of carefree, feline attitude, *curling* back on itself this way and that, hairless and freckled as it tapered to its tip. It was a magnificent tail, too magnificent to be an accident. I closed my eyes and took a shot of the Jack.**\n\n**“I know what you’re thinking,” Clarissa smiled. She sat down next to me, running her hand along my shoulder. “You’re thinking ‘it’s impossible, this can’t actually be happening.’”**\n\n**“You must be psychic,” I shot back dryly.**\n\n**“You’re thinking,” she pressed on, “that science eliminates the possibility of my existence.”**\n\n**I didn’t say anything.**\n\n**“What’s wrong, rock star, you don’t want to play along? I know that you know it all–how they say a human tail is only an abomination of the coccyx, a *vestige* of the behind that we all left behind...right?”**\n\n**“What are you getting at here, Clarissa?”**\n\n**She took a swig of lemonade and rolled the juice around her mouth, her gaze unbroken.**\n\n**“Nothing you haven’t already thought of ten thousand times, but I’ll humor you. If the only reason humans don’t have tails is because of some kind of disabled gene-signal, then the chances of more than one being on the planet is like one in billions. So if you realized there were *others like you*, that hypothesis would suddenly be on very thin ice.”**\n\n**My blood ran cold. I leaned all the way back on the sofa until my eyes were looking at the ceiling. The clustered nerve-endings were firing off in tingles that made it hard for me to resist the urge to let it squirm beneath me. All of my practiced methods for controlling the thing were failing. It was as if it somehow sensed another of its kind and now had license to awaken. She’d caught me by the tail.**\n\n**Clarissa leaned over me, her face close to mine. “Show it to me,” she whispered.**\n\n**No one had set eyes on it outside of my parents; I hadn’t seen them since they put me up for adoption. I sat up, pulled the back of my shirt up and leaned over. Her eyes felt like hot embers across its naked surface. She lifted it between her fingers, held it in her palm, caressed it. I suddenly noticed how heavily I was breathing.**\n\n**“There are many of us, you know,” she said softly.**\n\n**“How many?”**\n\n**Clarissa paused. “I don’t know, to be honest. But a lot. I met them in the genetic labs outside Salt Lake.”**\n\n**“Wait, genetic–”**\n\n**“Shhh!” She put a finger to my lips and straddled me, pulling my hands through her blue hair. “We’ll talk about it later.”**\n\n**I clutched her swaying tail and let its smoothness run through my fingers.**\n\n**“We’re a match,” she giggled, “a match made in some dirty heaven.”**\n\n**That evening, for the first time in my life, I surrendered fully to whatever it is that I am.

And the scariest. I know it sounds stupid and indulgent to say that, especially coming from another hetero-normative dude in black Christian Diors like me. (Whatever, they were knock-offs.) But given the extraordinary features of this interaction, along with its consequences for how people think of themselves, I really don’t think it’s an exaggeration. All of this is true by the way. I don’t have the time to make any of this up, and frankly I sucked pretty bad in Language Arts. My grade-school teachers will bug out if they read this.**\n\n**My band was doing a show in Salt Lake City–you know, Mormon utopia in the middle of the desert. Our next gig in Boise had been cancelled for reasons we didn’t entirely understand. When you’re on the road you just kind of run with things, I guess. We decided to hang out in Utah for a couple of days. Somebody said we could “backpack in the watercolor meadows of the Uintahs”. Sounded like a good time. We do retrowave electronica stuff, lots of synthy sounds with flashing lights and voice effects. Everyone’s into the eighties again, even the Mormons it turns out.**\n\n**I still don’t think of myself as a hook-up guy, even after all these years on the road. I’m serious. It’s not something I enjoy or even particularly like. I see hook-ups as one of the rites of being a traveling musician, or maybe even a curse. It’s like how prime ministers have to shake hands with people they don’t necessarily like. I’m a reluctant diplomat of the grunge scene. Everything that guys like David Bowie did make total sense to me. They turned their lives upside-down just to try and find something real. I wonder if they ever found it–when I did, it scared the crap out of me.**\n\n**The first Tinder girl I met in Utah was one of those “it’s for a good cause”-type chicks. I’m not trying to offend anybody, it’s just the only way I can think to describe her. What annoys me about those girls is that they all have the same personality. They’re almost breathless to prove how angry they are about all the *right* things. It makes me feel like everything I know is wrong or something. You just sit there and listen and drown in their syndicated outrage. I swiped right for shallow reasons, yes. The messed-up thing is that I anticipated my annoyance as I glanced at her pics. I was shamelessly undeterred.**\n\n**Her peach spaghetti-strap top swallowed most of my attention, even as she soliloquized about non binary love and dying pandas. (OK, I made that last one up.) Her blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail. It was less a conversation and more a kind of reciting on her part–anyone could’ve been sitting in front of her. I wonder if she would’ve acted differently if she knew who I was. A few hours later, I finished softly somewhere in the bobbing bramble of hair in my lap. It was depressing. She fixed her ponytail in the mirror, checked her phone, then quickly left.**\n\n**I don’t usually let people get to know me too well, not even my bandmates. I mean we drop acid together sometimes, bro-bonding stuff, that kind of thing. That’s about it. Even with girls, I’m a sex-in-the-dark kind of dude. They probably think I’m weird but I never ask. When the peach-top pedant was leaving I gave her one of our albums on cassette tape. It was awkward (“Uh, thanks…?”) but I feel like it’s the best I can do.**\n\n**Somewhere in the discussion of her saintly works, she had mentioned something her uncle had seen in a mall near downtown Salt Lake City. It was like an upright human with amphibian skin or something. Her uncle was a janitor who cleaned floors there late at night. The thing had come out of a basement stairwell, looked at him for a moment, then turned right back around and disappeared. The really crazy thing was that her uncle said he felt some kind of emotion deep in his chest that he never felt before, sort of like how you feel when you lock eyes with a stranger that looks inexplicably familiar. She reported all of this as a joke, rattling it off at blinding speed in her machine-gun dialogue of goodspeak. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, though, even when we started making out.**\n\n**The guys in our band like to joke about the golden thumb–it’s when you start a streak of matching with the city’s hottest women. That’s millennial serendipity at its finest. Isaac had the golden thumb in Topeka and we didn’t see him until Michigan, but in Michigan the algorithms failed him. It works in mysterious ways. When I matched with this Clarissa girl from Provo, I decided Salt Lake City *was* a promised land, or at least my own Topeka. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, nor has that condition of not-knowing changed. But let me back up...**\n\n**Clarissa was one of those one-pic profiles, which is risky. You’re betting that this single picture is so alluring that the opposite swiper needs no further proof of your hotness. In her case, it was a win. She was wearing a black romper striped orange, yellow, green; her hair was blue and cut boyishly short. The obligatory septum piercing made her nose look like a jewelled accessory. Style, attitude, cuteness. Bad-ass but delicate. The interesting part: the picture wasn’t a picture but actually a moving boomerang, one of those images perpetually repeating two seconds of movement.**\n\n**The boomerang showed Clarissa from behind, jogging in-place on a sidewalk with her face looking coyly back into the camera. I don’t need to mention the advantages such an angle affords those of the requisite affinities–but there was something else. Something *else.* There looked to be a kind of independent movement beneath the fabric around her tailbone, like an appendage that was rising and falling as she ran. You could *just* make out the outline. It couldn’t be…**\n\n**I put my phone away and started pumping some beat-mixes to get my mind straight. Things couldn’t be *that* freaky in Utah. My headphones weren’t loud enough to block out the image. The thing that bothered me most was that my attraction to her hadn’t waned; if anything, I felt *more* attracted. Had I been watching too many shapeshifter animes? That was probably the case regardless.**\n\n**Even so, there was no doubt that Clarissa’s festive romper was hiding a full-grown tail–like, none at all.  I watched the boomerang over and over again, turning my phone this way and that. There was no other conclusion. I considered calling my bandmates for brotherly support but in the end opted for privacy. Imagine if they heard I was seeing a girl with a *tail.* Literally a tail dangling down her rear. Her caption read: “Wyoming-raised, Utah-grown. I don’t want to go to Paris or Prague. Take me to a hidden place we can share secrets.” It was just too much.**\n\n**The first time I met Clarissa it was somewhere near State St. It’s hard for me to keep track of the roads because they’re all numbered on a grid based on their proximity to the Mormon temple. Clarissa told me that this system makes it easier to get around and not get lost. She laughed when I disagreed. We ate vegan wraps in one of those generic Salt Lake plazas made of Mexican eateries and Asian stores. Clarissa explained that she ate healthy when it suited her schedule and mood, which made her “a seasonal vegan”. It was summertime in Salt Lake; she wore a dirty-green tank-top and gray denim shorts ripped across the thighs; her hair was bluer than Freddie Mercury’s stage lighting.**\n\n**She was one of those girls who was easy to talk to, but from whom you couldn’t allow your attention to waver. Clarissa was no prolific talker. Instead I got a watchful loner vibe, someone you’d see walking along deserted railroad tracks, someone who considered Bjork their private therapist. I kept imagining how I could bring the topic up without coming across as a total creep. “I didn’t know people in Utah had tails...is that common here?” Gross. Maybe something more personal. “That romper you had on does a lot for your tail.” God, no. I settled on: “Can you show me that running move from your profile?”**\n\n**We were walking along the sidewalks in the glow of the street lamps; night had fallen on the strange city made of numbers. Clarissa’s hand was clasped softly in mine. I kept resisting the temptation to look behind her like an idiot. She was pressing me with questions somewhat absently. When I told her my band’s name was Nineteeneightyfornicate, she lost it and started going through all of our pictures on Instagram. That name was Isaac’s idea, not mine! It did have a nice ring to it.**\n\n**She stopped walking and turned on me suddenly.**\n\n**“You know, don’t you?”**\n\n**“Know–know what?” I stammered lamely.**\n\n**“Oh come off the bullshit, man. You’ve known this whole time.” Staring me frankly in the eyes, she took my hand and ran it along something long, firm, cylindrical on her backside. My heartbeat quickened and a soft moan emitted from my throat. Clarissa giggled and threw my hand away.**\n\n**“Any secrets you’d like to share with me?”**\n\n**I looked at her for a second, processing. “I already told you my dirty band name–”**\n\n**“Right,” she scoffed. “I hope you come up with something better by tomorrow.”**\n\n**She turned and began receding into the jasmine-bordered shadows. I realized that we had been surrounded by cats ever since we started walking. They now trailed her in unison like a row of ducklings down the sidewalk.**\n\n**“I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE A CAT PERSON!” I yelled hopelessly.**\n\n**She laughed and raised a long middle finger into the air without turning around. I sighed and began walking in the other direction back to my hotel. I opened my phone to a new text message from Clarissa. It didn’t say anything; she’d only sent three cat emojis with their tails in the air. I marveled at how little I knew what in the hell was going on. *I just stroked a human tail. That really happened.* And yet, perversely, I couldn’t wait for the next day.**\n\n***....Any secrets you’d like to share with me…***\n\n**I’ll come clean–that night wasn’t the first time I googled “humans with tails”. There had been drunken nights alone that I obsessed over the idea. My thoughts were ransacked by half-humanoids risen from primordial tetrapods, dripping with sea-foam and tails dragging in the sand. I told you I was a weird guy. To this point, the greatest harm all this had done was butcher my online algorithms–I would get ads for kinky Halloween costumes, which routinely raised some eyebrows.**\n\n***She could be a government spy on some troll-job,* I thought to myself. The idea tormented me for several hours. What was worse, I thought, the CIA using search history and store-bought accessories to play with my mind, or the possibility that I had met some kind of hybrid human with a rope of flesh swinging from her backside? The little bit of ganja I had left made my speculations thicker and more confusing. She had to be real. Why would the government waste time mind-fucking a guy from a band named Nineteeneightyfornicate? I went from that to wondering what she ate when she was stoned.**\n\n**Before I knew it, I was stepping out onto the curb in front of her house in my black knock-off Christian Diors. Who was this profane intruder in Provo? An agent *provo*cateur, I grinned to myself. I didn’t know there could be neighborhoods with trees in the desert. Seemed like the Mormons were pretty good landscapers when they weren’t busy granting all their wives eternal life. Who knew! Clarissa lived in a blue house with a quaint little front porch, one of those places that really has the picture-book mailbox with a perfect red lever pointed upwards.**\n\n**“Were you tailing me earlier?”**\n\n**Clarissa’s voice came out of nowhere, disembodied. I looked around me wildly, my unease ratcheting up several notches. A hand rested on my shoulder from behind; I wheeled around.**\n\n**“Chill out, freak,” Clarissa laughed. She looked at the tree next to her, brushing off some twigs. “My nest is up *there*.”**\n\n**“Your–nest?”**\n\n**“It’s a joke, heard of those before?”**\n\n**I suddenly noticed she was wearing a yellow Walkman cassette player. We always BS that if we meet a chick with a portable cassette player, we’ll automatically drop to one knee, no questions asked.**\n\n**“So you’re that much of a dork that you listen to cassette tapes in 2020?!”**\n\n**“And you’re telling me you don’t have one on you right now?”**\n\n**Wordlessly, I raised my band’s cassette tape out of my pocket.**\n\n**“Give me that,” she laughed, snatching it out of my hand. “Maybe we *are* a match!”**\n\n**I followed her inside.**\n\n**“My roommates are out for the weekend”–glancing at the couch–”you can just shove all that shit over, sorry. We have beer, lemonade, soda...or maybe you like the harder stuff?”**\n\n**I settled in and tried to relax, taking in what was around me. Nothing odd really. There was a crystal salt lamp whose warm glow looked afloat in the dim room. I could faintly sniff sage. A white cat met my gaze and darted out of sight, desperate to be forgotten.**\n\n**“You don’t get many visit–”**\n\n**The sentence was robbed from my throat. Clarissa was putting a glass of Jack Daniels on the table, naked beside the burgundy lingerie faintly interrupting her skin. I could see the thing in plain sight–it was moving from side to side in a sort of carefree, feline attitude, *curling* back on itself this way and that, hairless and freckled as it tapered to its tip. It was a magnificent tail, too magnificent to be an accident. I closed my eyes and took a shot of the Jack.**\n\n**“I know what you’re thinking,” Clarissa smiled. She sat down next to me, running her hand along my shoulder. “You’re thinking ‘it’s impossible, this can’t actually be happening.’”**\n\n**“You must be psychic,” I shot back dryly.**\n\n**“You’re thinking,” she pressed on, “that science eliminates the possibility of my existence.”**\n\n**I didn’t say anything.**\n\n**“What’s wrong, rock star, you don’t want to play along? I know that you know it all–how they say a human tail is only an abomination of the coccyx, a *vestige* of the behind that we all left behind...right?”**\n\n**“What are you getting at here, Clarissa?”**\n\n**She took a swig of lemonade and rolled the juice around her mouth, her gaze unbroken.**\n\n**“Nothing you haven’t already thought of ten thousand times, but I’ll humor you. If the only reason humans don’t have tails is because of some kind of disabled gene-signal, then the chances of more than one being on the planet is like one in billions. So if you realized there were *others like you*, that hypothesis would suddenly be on very thin ice.”**\n\n**My blood ran cold. I leaned all the way back on the sofa until my eyes were looking at the ceiling. The clustered nerve-endings were firing off in tingles that made it hard for me to resist the urge to let it squirm beneath me. All of my practiced methods for controlling the thing were failing. It was as if it somehow sensed another of its kind and now had license to awaken. She’d caught me by the tail.**\n\n**Clarissa leaned over me, her face close to mine. “Show it to me,” she whispered.**\n\n**No one had set eyes on it outside of my parents; I hadn’t seen them since they put me up for adoption. I sat up, pulled the back of my shirt up and leaned over. Her eyes felt like hot embers across its naked surface. She lifted it between her fingers, held it in her palm, caressed it. I suddenly noticed how heavily I was breathing.**\n\n**“There are many of us, you know,” she said softly.**\n\n**“How many?”**\n\n**Clarissa paused. “I don’t know, to be honest. But a lot. I met them in the genetic labs outside Salt Lake.”**\n\n**“Wait, genetic–”**\n\n**“Shhh!” She put a finger to my lips and straddled me, pulling my hands through her blue hair. “We’ll talk about it later.”**\n\n**I clutched her swaying tail and let its smoothness run through my fingers.**\n\n**“We’re a match,” she giggled, “a match made in some dirty heaven.”**\n\n**That evening, for the first time in my life, I surrendered fully to whatever it is that I am. Clarissa hasn’t left my side since; we’re in Cheyenne now. There’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think: I’ve never been happier–or more deeply, inconsolably frightened.**", "timestamp": 1635590392, "digest": "56648re9YKSnaRoHNgg2OrkLba9o04K-E3bNS5Hdiqc", "contributor": "0xBbb538b84ED95aBa94585c6cE7C2f8790dBfE53B"}

Do what you don't want others to do  \n\n \n\nBuffett also told his son, \"Don't do what other people do. Do what you love.\"  \n\n \n\nBuffett once gave his son Peter only $90,000, but he gave him a supportive, encouraging and inducing environment.  He encouraged Peter: If you want to live a colorful life, try to learn all the things that interest you.  He urged Peter to look inside himself and find his passion.  Buffett: Figuring out what you're passionate about is a painstaking, arcane process that requires a lot of freedom, and parental pressure can backfire.  It was such an environment and painstaking parents that made Peter a successful composer today. \n\n 2. Take action when the opportunity comes  \n\n \n\nBuffett told his children: \"to seize the opportunity, when an opportunity comes, immediate action\" don't miss this opportunity, at the time of waiting for the opportunity, to read, when their increasing their experience and their own knowledge base, the opportunity comes, can not hesitate to seize the opportunity, so close to success even further.  \n\n \n\nFigure it out before you start trading  \n\n \n\nAll successful investors, not just Buffett, certainly don't act on feelings.  Before making any investment decision, they must conduct in-depth research and analysis of the market.  Buffett's prudent investment, never do \"uncertain things\" strategy makes Buffett every time to consider once are particularly careful, because we do not know how strong risk tolerance.  Figuring everything out will allow capital to grow quickly when the opportunity arises.  However, many investors are not clear about the risk or they do not have enough risk control ability to invest rashly, or because of excessive greed and lost the sense of risk control.  That's why Buffett taught his children, \"When you're going to do something, know it before you start trading, because when you know it, you're going to win.\"  Although buffett is the richest man in the world, three children also didn't get much economic benefits, father told they want to rely on their own ability to create wealth, investment in the child's mental education, compared with the contemporary parents, always want all their dedication to their children, but it is in ruin children's creative ability, he lost the opportunity to create self value.  \n\n \n\nBuffett put more people attitude, learning work experience and methods, in the \"Buffett to children's advice for life\", through this book, face to face with the god of Shares, appreciate his outstanding knowledge and vision, learn the ability to create wealth.  \n\n \n\nRead this book to learn about Warren Buffett's business philosophy and how fathers care for their children.  Try to learn buffett's education philosophy, read Buffett's business acumen and accurate investment vision. It will last you a lifetime.  \n\n \n\nYou are ruining your child's life by giving him a gold dagger instead of a gold spoon!  Try taking away your child's golden spoon. It may hurt, but it will benefit you in the future.  ", "timestamp": 1635591055, "digest": "qE22nMr9GhRkk7U8ZtaSIGTGVKdpnyYyWiQekdi6JFQ", "contributor": "0x854070C754bc5f7395e57C4F2763c616D96973CB"}

If you can't be your own master, the consequences are very dangerous.  Those who want to find their own cause, to solve the problem, change the result.\n\nLife will be different depending on the depth and height of change.  There are three kinds of people in history:\n\nPeople who change quickly, they have a high level of motivation, the ability to quickly see into the nature of things, the ability to deeply understand themselves, and the ability to think rationally.\n\nSlow changers, people who are prone to procrastination, difficulty making choices, anxiety, wanting to change but not taking action.  Need a person to supervise and urge, spur, in the final analysis is the giant on thought, the short person on action, too lazy, more passive.\n\nPeople who never change, who are basically content with the status quo and hiding in their comfort zone.  Don't want to think, too lazy to change, self-satisfaction.  I have never tried to change everything subjectively because of external reasons, my innate ability and the attitude of the outside world towards me.

The self-comforter, believing that things or oneself are the way they should be.  Whether it's success or failure, bad or wonderful, good or bad, it's all taken for granted.  They will not notice the existence of a third party, their weaknesses, weaknesses, help from others, and efforts of others. If they are too self-centered, as time goes by, they will become obstacles to their own change and progress.\n2. Get used to it.  Habits become natural, from the way of thinking to the way of action are the same, do not seek breakthrough and change.  Different things the same way to deal with, not deep thinking, let irrational beliefs and habits occupy their brains.\n3. Callousness.  Treat others, other things are stuffy and numb, treat yourself rigid and stubborn, have a indifferent attitude.  Lack of enthusiasm and enthusiasm, indifference is protection.\n4. Commonly known as appointment.  Conformism, not innovation.  Make excuses for not changing.  That's what everybody does. That's how it used to be.  Never actively look for the reason, ask why?  But to follow the herd.\n\nLife change starts with responsibility.The way to change yourself is to be accountable to yourself, to eliminate the bad habits that prevent us from being accountable to ourselves.

Currently, there are a wide variety of financial products with uneven investment returns. Many people tend to ignore investment risks and blindly pursue high returns, resulting in investment damage or even loss of all their money.  Therefore, the general public in the purchase of financial products must pay attention to risk prevention.  First, do not blindly pursue high returns.  Investment and financial management is by no means an opportunistic way to make money. Only by ensuring the safety of funds can we preserve and increase wealth.  Guo Shuqing, chairman of China Banking Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBRC), once stressed: High yield means high risk. If the yield exceeds 6%, there will be a question mark, if the yield exceeds 8%, it will be dangerous, and if the yield exceeds 10%, you will be prepared to lose all the principal.  The return is always proportional to the risk, promising low risk and high return is fraud.  Therefore, financial management should maintain a normal mind, higher than the bank deposit interest rate of the same period of financial management should be carefully screened, do not covet high returns.  \n\nSecond, don't put too much faith in advertising.  Some investment institutions in order to attract investors eye will product revenue through various channels and the company background, the propaganda strength, some even will arrange in order to achieve better effect and celebrity platform fictitious company strength, background in finance and investment must make financial firms and financial products to invest again after careful study and identify, don't be fooled by surface propaganda.  \n\nThe third is to make clear their own risk tolerance.  Many investors do not know their risk tolerance, blind investment, some even borrow money to invest and take life to invest, once can not recover the principal and interest, will fall into poverty immediately.  So it's important to know your risk tolerance.  Investment and financial management must make reasonable planning, in the guarantee of normal life, pension, medical care, education and other expenses under the circumstances of the remaining money to conduct reasonable financial management;  We must pay attention to the safety of the principal and consider the risk of losing the principal to zero after investment.  We must pay attention to risk sharing, diversify financial products, and do not concentrate all capital on one or two products.  \n\nFourth, we must choose the right investment path.  Now there are many investment and financial planning in the financial market. If you and your family have investment and financial planning needs, please choose banks, securities, insurance and other formal financial institutions and channels that have obtained the license of financial business activities of the Financial regulatory department of The State Council.

{"id": "eu_C35d4eFL0OdV8RDS8Ngw6udKpYASMFeiwBwmDZRE", "title": "What is blockchain? What is bitcoin? What is an ICO?", "body": "There is a closed mountain village, the main work of the villagers is to dig jade, the wealth of the village is also calculated in jade.  We dig jade stacked together, by the village head count accounting.  The wealth of Zhang SAN, Li Si and Wang Wu was recorded in the village chief's account book, and they could exchange it for other daily necessities.  \n\n \n\nThis approach is now known as the central book-keeping financial system.  Banks, brokerages, Alipay and other financial institutions are village leaders.  Almost all of our liquid assets are in their books.  \n\n \n\nBut the village head is a mortal, old muddled, Parkinson's disease, salacious......  There is no shortage of faults.  When accounting, see beautiful peasant woman, write down two more;  Encounter a thorn, less remember a piece.  And then there were problems with the books, too, with damp blurriness in places and rats gnawed them away.  More excessive is, little widow Zhao Liu and village head fool around when, the account book was also altered by her a few pens.  \n\n \n\nThe villagers decided to get rid of the village leader who did not work, ate for free, overcharged and made mistakes.  Who's going to do the bookkeeping?  The villagers thought of a way: everyone with a ledger, who dug jade, their records at the same time to inform everyone, everyone in their books to write down the same content, ledger are respectively by the villagers custody.  After the villagers between the goods exchange, exchange jade, also through this way of accounting.  This saves a bookkeeping labor, but also to avoid problems such as dampness.  Even if the little widow altered Zhang SAN's account books, but we take li Si, Wang Wu, Sun Qi's account books out of comparison, can immediately find the problem and correct.  If there are enough villagers (and women), the little widow, no matter how powerful she is, cannot change the books of half the people.  This is decentralized distributed bookkeeping.  \n\n \n\nThe problem came, Li Si suddenly had a flash of inspiration, \"IF I take the jade that has been recorded and record it again, won't my wealth soon be doubled and doubled again?\"  In order to solve Li Si's fraud, the villagers came up with a solution.  Each piece of jade is marked with a record of when, where and who it was dug up, as well as information about the last piece of jade dug up.  \n\n \n\nTherefore, each villager's ledger records complete information about each piece of jade.  Each piece of jade has information associated with the previous piece, forming a chain.  Li Si could neither make things up out of thin air nor change previous records.  This is blockchain -- P2P distributed accounting.  \n\n \n\nIn the above case, distributed bookkeeping, every time they dig jade, the villagers need to stop work and update the accounts once, but reduce production efficiency.  But in the computers of the Internet, it's all instantaneous.  \n\n \n\nA blockchain doesn't necessarily need to mine jade. Jade (bitcoin, or anything else) can be created according to a variety of rules.  Blockchain is not equal to bitcoin, which is an application based on blockchain technology.  \n\n \n\nThe main purpose of blockchain is to keep track of these objects (virtual money).  According to the mainstream view of the blockchain industry, compared with the traditional central accounting, distributed blockchain is safe, accurate, efficient and open.  It does not need to sacrifice huge frictional costs to feed huge financial institutions (village heads), and since it is decentralized storage in the form of P2P, there is no need to worry about problems such as financial institutions' databases being hacked, computer rooms suffering from natural disasters, coups and so on.  Blockchain is a disrupter of traditional financial institutions.  \n\n \n\nSo could this new cross-border, anarchic, decentralised technology, and the financial system built around it, be jointly strangled?  \n\n \n\nWhat is bitcoin?  \n\n \n\nGod sent a messenger named Satoshi, to the global village.  The messenger told the villagers, \"God loves the world and has decided to give out a total of 21 million bitcoins to everyone.  What is the use of this bitcoin?  God didn't talk to me, and I don't know.  But according to what standard?  Can not be directly evenly distributed, too easy to get everyone do not understand gratitude;  Zhao Liu's legs are long, and Sun Qi's breasts are big.  More can not directly to the sky a throw, everyone rushed to rob, rob of broken and bleeding, against god's love intention.  What to do?  I'll tell you what. I'll hide all my bitcoins in fields, forests, river valleys, etc. If you dig hard enough, you'll have a chance to get them.  God helps those who work hard, so it is fair to all, just ask everyone to get bitcoin, through the way of blockchain record.  ' '  \n\n \n\nAt the beginning, the villagers didn't know what bitcoin could be used for, and not many people participated.  After receiving bitcoin, some people used it to play games, while others traded 10,000 bitcoins for a pizza.  Until one bitcoin was worth a few cows, the villagers frantically joined in.  \n\n \n\nIn order to remind the villagers of God's grace and prolong the joy of labor, Satoshi nakamoto set up the mining rules, no matter how many people participate, only once every 10 minutes, 50 bitcoins each time.  So, the more people who participate, the lower the probability of an individual getting it.  And the number of single acquisitions is halved every four years.  At first, the villagers used shovels, then excavators, and then thousands of excavators in formation.  No way, other villagers large-scale use of modern equipment, you still use a small shovel, may never dig.  \n\n \n\nIn a real Bitcoin scenario, mining involves running a set of hashing algorithms on a networked computer. If the results match the preset scenario, you get bitcoins and complete the exchange of information on the blockchain.  At first, we used ordinary PCS, and then evolved to video card machines, which greatly improved efficiency, and then there were special mining machines.  \n\n \n\nIn this digging process, like villagers everywhere digging earth, is a man-made design, no actual function of labor.  The amount of electricity consumed by millions of working mining machines in the world would rank among the top ten if calculated by country.  That's why so many miners make their homes near hydropower stations in the remote mountains of Sichuan and Yunnan.  \n\n \n\nSo bitcoin, essentially a string of computer characters, is distributed and stored in a P2P network of all participants via blockchain.  Bitcoin is decentralized, secure, open, anonymous and borderless.  \n\n \n\nWhy can bitcoin be exchanged for other things?  Nothing, as long as the villagers are willing to exchange other things, can be exchanged.  Some villagers may be pure at the beginning of a small price to spend a few coins when the collection of play.  But as more and more villagers recognized that the things they could exchange became more and more expensive, the price of Bitcoin soared.  Some villagers simply stopped mining and bought and sold bitcoin to make a difference.  It also created exchanges for bitcoin.  \n\n \n\nIn addition, Satoshi emissary, but also in bitcoin given a preset conditions for automatic implementation of the function.  For example, Egg claimed that Maotai's stock price could break 500 this year, and MAO thought he was lying, so they set up a 1 million yuan bet.  If you follow the traditional way, in order to avoid default, you need to find a reliable third party, everyone will first give 1 million to this third party, and at the end of the year, the third party will give all the money to the winner based on the result.  In the bitcoin world, Eggs and Maomao simply add words like \"If Moutai's share price is above 500 in 2017, then...\" to their respective bitcoins.  When bitcoin expires, the result will be executed automatically, without the need for a third party.  As a result, many people believe that Bitcoin can replace credit brokers, payment brokers, insurance companies, casinos and so on.  \n\n \n\nLater in the story, the villagers found that Satoshi nakamoto is not the messenger of God, and he actually has more than 1 million bitcoin in his pocket, although never used, we are still worried that the function of bitcoin to exchange goods, will depreciate or even disappear, because there is no public power credit endorsement.  \n\n \n\nMore intelligent villagers found that IN fact, I can also issue a set of cat coins, dog coins what ah, simply send straight to everyone, the number can also be unlimited, to avoid the helpless and painful digging work.  \n\n \n\nIn fact, since all of bitcoin's coding algorithms are open source, anyone can issue their own catecoin or dogecoin with simple modifications.  However, if no one else is involved, your Kitty coins will only show off to your own Kitty.  Of the thousands of coins that have emerged so far, only a handful have enough people involved to keep them going.  \n\n \n\nWhat is an ICO?  \n\n \n\nIn order to attract others to participate in their shanzhai coins, clever villagers thought that if the virtual coins are linked to real property, in a sense, equivalent to providing a guarantee, the shanzhai coins may have investment, collection and circulation value.  \n\n \n\nLi Si of clever mind, collect a pile of dog excreta, legend is ancient times, Lv Dongbin's dog stole ate flat peach and pull, have the effect of nourishing Yin zhuang Yang, strong body.  Li Si now needs some capital to make dog shit into dog shit cakes and sell them all over the world.  Li Si registered a shit company and planned to sell 10% of his shares at a valuation of 100 million yuan.  In the traditional way, Li Si can either seek angel, VC direct investment, or through an exchange listing (IPO) to raise funds.  But the angel is to see the face, VC to data, listing is far from meeting the standards of the exchange, even with, layers of approval down, Lv Dongbin are resurrected.  \n\n \n\nAfter li Si understood blockchain and bitcoin, he decided to issue 10 million shit coins by himself and promised 10% of the shares of the corresponding shit company.  For convenience and security, dogshit company does not accept cash or other items to buy dogshit coins, people can only subscribe through Bitcoin.  Assuming that the current unit price of Bitcoin is 20,000 RMB, then transfer one bitcoin to Li Si's shit company, and the shit company will transfer 20,000 shit coins to the other party.  In the end, the dog shit company sent 10 million dog shit coins and received 500 Bitcoins, which were then exchanged for 10 million yuan.  \n\n \n\nThis is an initial public offering, or ICO, of shit coins.  Is an ICO almost the same as an IPO?  No, people's ICO does not need law firm compliance, investment bank packaging, accounting audit, CSRC approval, exchange listing and other costly and time-consuming processes, and the real issue is global, raised funds can also be freely transferred around the world.  Icos have the characteristics of illegal fundraising, such as targeting an unspecified majority of people and public fundraising.  ICO industry chain, is in addition to the supervision of authorities, set up a full set of listed companies, securities, stocks, exchanges and other financial systems.  So...  Grief.  \n\n \n\nWhy are villagers willing to trade bitcoins for shit money?  As investors hit new, we do not care about the company behind the code is what business, only need to have a continuous soaring IPO case incentive, it is hard to find a share.  Why can shit coin go up after ICO?  The immediate reason is that some people are willing to pay a higher price for it, and those who buy it believe the price will go up.  In the world of anonymous ICOs, there are no shortage of real-life stock market stories.  Someone might seriously analyze the cost and efficacy of dog poop cookies, and estimate market sales and profit in turn.  More people are studying past price movements, gathering gossip and predicting tomorrow's prices.  Of course, not to mention the big family sitting, from buy from sell, control the price.  Where does the money that shit corporation raises end up?  Are dog poo cakes really made and selling like hot cakes?  Only God knows.  ", "timestamp": 1635592586, "digest": "wWRVURrRqxM86rYeu_u7dktAUSD9S3NX4hPyusvuhgc", "contributor": "0xfc38d21478178504Af5d02916eA283233163FEA3"}

Forefront’s Season One was no exception.\n\nThroughout the season, our community was in the weeds of dozens of projects, initiatives, and discoveries. Every day there were new people to meet, new challenges to overcome, and new boundaries to push forward.\n\nIn order to keep progressing efficiently towards our mission of becoming the **“Port of Entry to Web3”**, we need to reflect, recover, and recalibrate.\n\nAs Season One comes to a close, we’re calling on our community to take some time to explore what made their Forefront experience great, provide insight about where we can improve, and shape where we go from here.\n\nFirst, let’s take some time to celebrate what we’ve accomplished.\n\n## Season One Highlights\n\n![Season One — Highlights](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vjsfewomFqroPlrJTi3cb.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n[Forefront Season One](https://ff.mirror.xyz/Fj6LKnH1FSwz5eFaHBNuvChhn1Z_nA82w7FthkOV8Hg) was titled Enter the Forge. Our goal was to begin to build the teams and structures necessary to grow Forefront into a DAO powerhouse. It is unbelievable to think about all we’ve achieved in the last three months.\n\n### DAO Contributors\n\nThe Forefront DAO grew from just 5 core contributors in the Pre-Season to now 29 contributors spread across three Guilds. Our Culture Guild took the lead on building out a formal onboarding process, helping new members gain context, meet other contributors, and complete bounties as a pathway to becoming a contributor. In parallel, we build out a contributor rewards structure with base allocations, project rewards, and an end-of-season Coordinape pool.\n\nIn part thanks to the treasury diversification round, Forefront was also able to [onboard](https://snapshot.org/#/ffdao.eth/proposal/QmejUFkTFzhWS3McVpYbfX3C4u1cBLSFqqfqysvXe3rrL5) its first official Full- and Part-Time Core Contributors to the DAO who can be paid (partially) in USDC. These Contributors have each made long-term commitments to pushing forward high-level DAO initiatives and helping coordinate Guild activities.\n\nThe strides we’ve taken to empower and retain talent to put Forefront in an exciting position moving forward. While there is plenty to improve, we are extremely optimistic for what is to come.\n\n### Projects & Initiatives\n\nWhile the newsletter was one of Forefront’s core “products” heading into Season One, the team managed to ship at an insane rate throughout the last three months, dramatically expanding our reach and workload.\n\nFirst, Forefront pushed the boundaries of DAO culture with our FF Birthday Celebration. This was a multi-day digital event with games, competitions, DJ sets, and so much more. Be on the lookout for [Forefront DAOlloween](https://metaverse.forefront.club/) coming this month.\n\nFrom a content perspective, Season One saw the launch of some major new media pillars:\n\n* [Forefront Learn](https://forefront.market/learn/social-tokens), a comprehensive resource to go from zero to DAO contributor by learning about social tokens, DAOs, and more.\n* [Forefront Podcast](https://forefront.market/newsletter), which includes high-quality recordings of our weekly FF Hangouts + weekly news wrap-ups of the crypto space at large.\n* [Forefront Wrapped](https://forum.forefront.news/d/43-forefront-wrapped-5), our weekly DAO summary for contributors and lurkers alike to be able to stay up-to-date on all things happening in the Forefront DAO.\n\nThere are plenty more projects in the works, all with the mission of making Forefront the port of entry for web3.\n\nFinally, Forefront had some in-person fun this Season as well! FF Contributors attended and [spoke at MCON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=797dfjgF1wg), and we’ll be making some moves at LisCon as well.\n\n### Treasury Diversification\n\nThe beginning of Season One kicked off Forefront’s [treasury diversification](https://ff.mirror.xyz/Yqo1j1RlCowOCRBnxupprIZ8w4RLRxit67x6pIK1hrA) round. A lot went into this process, including answering questions like who should we include in the round, how much should we raise, what should the terms be, and many more.\n\nEventually, with tons of community support, we landed on a $2.1M raise from dozens of strategic investors, angels, and community contributors. This addition to Forefront’s treasury will help us scale our effort, onboard full-time contributors, and continue to build at the cutting edge of DAOs.\n\nThe initial proposal was hosted on our Forum for community feedback. We then hosted 3 separate Hangouts in our Discord with many of the investors leading the round where community members could ask questions and submit ideas. Many changes were suggested, which we incorporated into the proposal. That final proposal was then voted on Snapshot before the process was kicked off. We’re proud to be able to involve so many community members in the process and in the round itself.\n\n### Growth\n\n![Season One — Snapshot](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WbWGOuDJXwrOJ5IcEKJE7.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nAs our output has increased, so has our impact. During season one our core contributors grew from 5 to 29 people (a 480% increase), who collectively earned 68,971 $FF in return for their efforts.\n\nAcross the 13 events and hangouts we ran in Season One we saw thousands of attendees and a truly insane roster of featured guests including Kei Kreutler, Toby Shorin, Ameer “Sirsu”, Patrick Rivera, John Palmer and Jarrod Dicker.\n\nBigger and bigger ships are bringing people to the shores of web3 and to new projects within it, and we’re thrilled that the leaders who are truly pioneering the space are coming to Forefront’s port to help guide them forward.\n\n## Introduction Off-Season\n\n![Off-Season Goals](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8wFm1pIBwf-hYsZ8A8KbJ.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n### Off-Season Goals\n\nWhile we’re more excited than ever about the future of Forefront, we can’t move forward blindly. Planning for Season Two and beyond must be an intentional, community-driven effort. As such, we’re kicking off an “Off-Season” period featuring community feedback opportunities, North Star sessions, Values Design, and much more. The goal is to ensure that everyone’s voice is heard in imagining the future of Forefront. Be on the lookout in the Discord, newsletter, and forum for meeting dates!\n\nWe’ve been running full speed ahead for the last 3 months – this next period is a time to slow down, reflect, and reimagine. We’ll still be working hard to produce and ship as a DAO, but with a renewed focus on the future.\n\nWe are gently building each other up by strengthening our bonds through trust and vulnerability. It is imperative for longevity and community health that we build these Off-Season periods into the fabric of Forefront.\n\n### Off-Season Program:\n\n1. Reflection gatherings on Community Feedback;\n2. North Star workshop;\n3. Governance workshop;\n4. Season & Product roadmap workshop;\n5. Team Building & Health sessions;\n6. Party like it’s 1999;\n7. More TBD via community Vibez.\n\nOff-Season will officially starts October 28th and run for a period of about 5 weeks.\n\n### Community Feedback\n\nPlease take a few minutes to complete our Community Feedback Form.\n\nThis form is our first step in aggregating community feedback and insight to continue to grow and improve throughout the Off-Season and beyond. Regardless of whether you were a hardcore Season 1 Contributor or a lurker looking to get involved, definitely take some time to fill out the form!\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRFErRsBQ3rtb9volggxHG1fkS2FmZeTbU7Q1DcMiVPfS1aQ/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRFErRsBQ3rtb9volggxHG1fkS2FmZeTbU7Q1DcMiVPfS1aQ/viewform)\n\n## Season Two - Looking Ahead\n\nWhile there’s plenty to think through during the Off-Season, the Forefront community has already been thinking hard about what the future might look like.\n\n![Season Two — What's Next ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hIH7cQiezzoTsLfIn_ggJ.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nSome projects are already in the works across various Guilds. For example, we’re completely reimagining what Forefront’s DAO2DAO strategy looks like and how we can promote ecosystem-wide positive-sum games. We’re also working on product development (infrastructure for social token communities), public goods funding, new media experiments, and so much more.\n\n## Forefront Foundations\n\nForefront has come a long way, and we’re extremely excited for the future as we continue to grow and evolve, together.\n\nNow, more than ever, we’re calling on the larger web3 community to come join us in building a vibrant, positive, creative community.

{"id": "hNH80XyM-_sGJDPBBKY-PjR6G3sA-0LI9LZfq5wRKg0", "title": "After reading 100 articles on blockchain, I strongly recommend these 5 articles", "body": "The blockchain, which grew out of Bitcoin, is in the crosshail.  \n\n \n\nYou've probably heard a lot of \"stories\" around you.  A few bitcoins were later sold for thousands of yuan each (the highest time was 130,000 yuan each), regretting it forever;  And after buying more than 10, the hard drive was formatted and the bitcoin was never recovered.  What's worse, I invested 100,000 yuan in the morning and only had 3,000 yuan left in the afternoon.  \n\n \n\nOne day stir-fry currency, a year stir-fry.  Ups and downs, life is fried currency.  \n\n \n\nThe blockchain behind the story is a real technological innovation.  \n\n \n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that blockchain's transformation is similar to the Internet, and its position today is similar to that of the Internet in the early 1990s.  Who knew what the Internet was then?  As long as the company hang up the \".com \"domain name, a blunt flying.  Until the bubble burst;  In those days, the real wealth was made by the \"shovel seller\";  Since then, the Internet has been in a slump for more than a decade;  After a few more periods, it eventually led to changes in one field after another, resulting in social, economic and cultural innovation at all levels.  \n\n \n\nEach revolution is driven by technology, such as cloud computing, big data, the Internet of things and now the most talked about artificial intelligence.  Moreover, these technologies are standing on the accumulation of technology in the past, step by step brewing and erupting.  \n\n \n\nThe Internet solves the problem of \"information\" asymmetry and delivers information.  Blockchain solves the problem of \"trust\" and delivers \"value\".  Comparatively speaking, blockchain has little connection with other technologies, and can even \"remake\" the underlying architecture of the Internet, changing the form of companies, investment and financing, and business transformation.  \n\n \n\nThat's what's great and exciting about it.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\"Distributed ledger\", \"decentralization\", \"asymmetric encryption algorithm\", \"co-maintenance\", \"programmability\" and other technical characteristics determine that blockchain is different from the traditional Internet architecture.  Still rely on traditional Internet architecture now, later, perhaps subvert.  \n\n \n\nFor example, the current cloud computing is not really \"distributed\", but depends on cloud data centers such as AWS, Microsoft and Aliyun.  Future data storage, in theory, can be \"decentralized\", multiple copies of the same exist in multiple nodes, there is really no data center hosting.  And instead of today's peer-to-peer delivery, email will be broadcast around the world, accessible to all but the \"key\" person.  \n\n \n\nAnother example is that e-commerce transactions now require intermediaries or platforms such as Taobao and JINGdong to ensure the security of funds and solve the problem of trust.  In the future, it will be point-to-point. With smart contracts, you won't be afraid not to pay.  Of course, the scene could be more varied.  Smart contracts, combined with the sharing economy and the Internet of things, can dictate what happens when, where and by whom.  Like renting a house, booking a car after the set time, automatic fulfillment, no longer need to worry about the time problem.  \n\n \n\nThere is more talk of bitcoin becoming legal tender.  To some extent, its anonymity, rapidness and trustworthiness have attracted the attention of many countries and regions.  Rather than blocking, there are several banking organizations that are organizing efforts to develop various types of blockchain cooperation, such as R3.  \n\n \n\nBlockchain can also be divided into common chains, federation chains and private chains, depending on the number of participants and scope of application.  This makes it possible to use public, private, and hybrid clouds on a case-by-case basis;  Modifiable technology.  \n\n \n\nThe best part of blockchain is the DAO (distributed autonomous Organization), which is a pure technology-oriented architecture.  Companies can issue their own ICOs (tokens, which you can think of as shares or options) as long as they have a good project.  ICO changed the process and concept of investment and financing in the past;  Anyone can hold an ICO, but at a cost such as mining.  As long as the project is valuable and the ICO holder has an incentive to promote the project, the project will continue to grow.  Once the project is released, control is no longer in the founders' hands.  Leave everything to the market.  The responsibility of the project sponsor is to provide better technical support and service.  Ethereum is now moving in that direction.  \n\n \n\nToo much room for imagination.  But in reality, blockchain has only reached the 1.0 era, and there is still a long time for smart contracts in the 2.0 era and industrial applications in the 3.0 era.  Even if 1.0 is to arrive, it will probably take 5-10 years.  \n\n \n\nHow could this mess not produce a giant or two?  \n\n \n\nAlthough at present, most of the ICO in China, the majority of crooks, mud.  But blockchain is real and has the power of technological change.  \n\n \n\nIn order to sort out these contents, I have recently read more than 100 articles and read several books, and selected some excellent contents as follows.  Take a look.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nConcept.  \n\nTitle: The original blockchain was born because of the village head's sexual hands;  \n\nSource: Snowball public account.  This is by far the most accessible article I've read.  Starting with examples, let's talk about the application of blockchain.  This can be read together with this article on Zhihu.  However, most of zhihu's articles are shaking clever, in the back of the exposition is powerless.  The author of this article estimated that snowball community, from the investment point of view, how to package an ICO project, what is the value.  For ordinary people, the important principle is, don't buy if you don't understand.  Nevertheless, you anyhow be when leek, still buy casually, lest regret.  \n\nIndustrial pattern.  \n\nTitle: Release of the most complete blockchain ecological map, a map to see 2400 typical projects;  \n\nSource: Whale Research Institute.  As the title says, this is the release of the most complete blockchain ecological map;  A research institute. This is our familiar perspective, which analyzes the concept, technical layer, application scope, scenario and industry of blockchain.  If someone says they do blockchain, ask what they do and where they fit into the industry.  If you can't answer, you're probably a liar, probably named Li.  \n\nVC.  \n\nTitle: Blockchain, it brings me inner expansion and suffering;  \n\nSource: Wang Lijie.  This one was written by an investor.  He made four times profit in a month, invested in 10 projects, is really a mixed world, people can not stop the desire, are naked eating.  Who are 99% of the losers in this round, and who will take over?  The author once published a book \"investing in outliers\", also recommended.  \n\nInvestment.  \n\nTitle: Civilization doesn't think, but It chooses: Crumbling blockchain and its investment Opportunities;  \n\nSource: Hong Kong stocks that matter.  This article continues to recommend investment perspective.  Because bitcoin this big rise and fall, and money related to national policies, banking supervision, institutions.  See a problem from the Angle of capital, often can seize essence.  There are some introductions to listed companies in it.  From my point of view, I firmly believe that the value of blockchain will be released eventually, which is closely related to each of us.  But the current climate is not right, to have faith in this.  \n\nTechnical articles.  \n\nTitle: Report on Blockchain Technology and Application Value;  \n\nSource: Bizarre Notes.  A bit of technical wizardry for the last post.  This is from the perspective of database, network, storage, ledger, P2P, and core technologies.  The author's logic is the same as that of most men of science and technology: what is it, what can be done, and what is the bottleneck.  More suitable for IT men to read.  ", "timestamp": 1635592786, "digest": "nBND54dSiyR8F29KoUuKBmfMZX2S5cDQG6BbpgGBhgo", "contributor": "0xa14F0912bA2a069E0371290e7F00a724a3f5E36F"}
{"id": "KDfwB1ax_I2wpd3DwFFyfvuHp1DdBS7hTAi4iHLpx8w", "title": "A MYSTERIES Of THE MANDELA EFFECT, The Merging and collapsing of parallel realities.", "body": "The ‘Mandela Effect’ is a curious, mysterious and fascinating phenomenon where masses of people clearly recall either a specific event in history or the name or spelling of an item as being a particular way, however all public historical records and other people contradict what you remember as being a fact.\n\nIt is like what all these people remember never actually happened, yet you are so sure that it did and you have clear memories of it. This leaves the people experiencing the anomalies as feeling completely perplexed, puzzled and even weirded out, like reality has changed.\n\nWhat is interesting about this is that it is not just the odd person. In some cases it is thousands of people who share the same memory that contrasts current historical data or timelines.\n\nThere are literally people all over the world who are not related or connected to each other at all, that are collectively recalling the exact same historical information – yet all written information whether in books , newspapers or online sources of information contradict this. So it is not a sole, subjective experience – making it harder to disprove and debunk.\n\n**Why is it Called the ‘Mandela’ Effect?**\n\nThe name ‘Mandela’ links to Nelson Mandela and the fact that thousands of people recall seeing the news in the 1980’s, that Nelson Mandela died in prison during that time. Some even recollect being there and seeing him buried! They distinctly remember seeing the actual memorial.\n\nThe rest of us do not have such a recollection. All the other people of the world who found out about his death will agree with what all current public information reports – that he actually passed away in December 2013.\n\n**Which Reality Do You Recall?**\n\n**Test Yourself on Other Common Examples of the Mandela Effect:**\n\n​Famous People - When Did They Die, or Did They Die At All?\n\n​Apart from the questioning of Nelson Mandela's death, the death of other famous people has also been questioned.:\n\n​Muhammed Ali passed away on 3rd June 2016 - some people recall him dying before that already.\n\nBilly Graham - many people recall that he died around the time of Ted Kennedy's death. They watched the funeral on TV! As of July 2016 he is reportedly alive and well.\n\nShirley Temple died in 2014 - some recall that she died as a child\n\nThe Spelling or Word Change of Books, Movies & Products\n\nA big one that people recall differently is the old children's book - remembered as 'The Berenstein Bears', however in this reality the books are called: 'The Berenstain Bears.' Do you recall it spelled with an 'e' or an 'a'?\n\nThe iconic TV series / movie is named 'Sex and the City '– however many of us are sure that the name was “Sex in the City” when it first aired.\n\nMost people will recall the title \"Interview with a Vampire\" - Apparently not. Now everywhere it is referenced as \"Interview with the Vampire\"!\n\nWho doesn't remember the famous line from the movie Forest Gump as being: ​​\"Life is like a box of chocolates.\" I remember reciting it that way many a time. Apparently not! Believe it or not, if you watch the movie in this reality timeline, Forrest actually says \"Life was like a box of chocolates!\"\n\n​​​​We all know Star wars – according to your historic recollection, was Darth Vader's famous line: “LUKE, I am your father” now: “No, I am your father”? Believe it or not, it is the latter!\n\nThis is a cereal I never buy for my kids, however I am pretty sure I recall it being spelt as 'Fruit Loops', not 'Froot Loops'! How about you? (and no - it hasn't had a name change!)\n\n**Color Changes**\n\nThe color chartreuse - many people including artists remember this colour to be a kind of pinky blue/red/purple shade, now it is apparently a yellowy green colour, named after the liquor!\n\n**Geographical Shifts**\n\nNZ on the left (West) or right (East) of Australia? I recall clearly NZ was in the LEFT of Au! (or that its shifted further Norths??)​​\n\n**Other Reported Oddities:**\n\n​Which way do you spell this word: dilemna or dilemma? As an excellent speller I KNOW that its spelt 'dilemna' with an 'n'! But no, check any dictionary - apparently its spelled dilemma!\n\nDid 9/11 really happen on that date? There are people who believe it actually happened on the 10th!\n\nIt is interesting to note that there are alternate reality excerpts of the bible which are different, and scholars and priests are even commenting about that and the link to the Mandela effect online!\n\n**Which reality are you in?**\n\nThe predominant theory out there about this whole phenomenon is that it is a byproduct of the fact that there are multi dimensions and parallel universes, and thus a limitless number of alternate realities. This is a theory that is also supported by modern quantum physics.\n\n​Is the fact that there are a number of people who have alternative memories actual proof of parallel / alternative realities / universes?​\n\n**The Concept of 'Alternate Realities'?**\n\nWe are collectively becoming more and more aware that we all have multiple alternative realities happening at once. In fact the angels recently told me in a channeling that follows:\n\n​\"Be the Divine creature that you are in all spheres of life, the after life, all directions of 'time and space', because it is all happening instantaneously. All of your past, present and futures is happening all at once Dear Ones, and you will begin to understand this more as quantum Physics and breaks through the 'surface' of reality and throws old perspectives askew.\"\n\nEven though this sounds like the stuff of science fiction, those who are into the theories or are quite conscious of the ‘reality’ around them, really feel that it is real and happening. This has certainly been the case for me.\n\nMany people are starting to question reality and experience what current quantum physics is actually suggesting - that we are all living in a holographic and computer simulated world of multi dimensions. The theory is that the people that remember alternative facts had tapped into an alternative universe.\n\n​So the alternate reality where Mandela died in the 80s no longer exists, or isn’t the one that we are in right now. It is said that the more ‘dominant’ history takes over, the one that is stronger – and that eventually we forget or acclimatize - and it all becomes one though glitches in the system, although some still recall – and they are the ones questioning things.\n\n**A Merging of Dimensions**\n\nThings are rapidly changing. Reality is shifting before our eyes. Now, with the quickening of energies and energetic revolution on earth, some people might be moving in and out of or sliding between various alternative realities, and either not be conscious of it at all, or be somewhat conscious of small idiosyncrasies, glitches, oddities, or even a shift in the feel of the energy. Something feels different or out of place.\n\n​As we move into different timelines, our consciousness is moving too. And with shifting timelines, history changes also. Our reality is changing before our eyes, including the written word, right down to how we spell things. Timelines and blurring, dimensions are merging. Some say that there are two earths – the old earth and the new earth, and they are converging, coalescing into one.\n\n**A ‘Glitch’ in the System**\n\nIs there a glitch in the matrix? Whatever ‘reality’ you are in today might not be the one you are in tomorrow.\n\n**The Case for 'Mind Control'**\n\n​Some Christians believe that this is the sign of the devil, that we are being deceived and illusions are being created on a grand scale. Others believe that government agencies & secret power groups are mind controlling us.\n\nI confirm that the Mandela effect is but a deliberate deception by those in power and control. This whole phenomenon is based on: “False memories which is an off shoot of the mind control MK Ultra experiments-alternate histories and shared memories which are being intentionally broadcast to change our perception of what’s real and what's not-a virtual \"devil’s mental playground.\" The U.S. military and intelligence agencies are spending vast amounts of money to program the brain and to be able to both read your thoughts and control them and or implant them.”\n\nNow since electrons are the core element, the building blocks of all matter including our reality and every 'solid' object in it, if we apply this to our physical 'reality' of time and space, quantum physics has proven that reality therefore collapses as soon as we stop observing it. It is important to note that this process does not only apply to the electrons, but also the nucleus, molecules and whole atoms.\n\nSo what we experience as matter in any way, shape or form is only solid when we look at it. Other than that it is not solid at all but rather a wave. Therefore the natural state of an electron is as a wave. The only time that this wave forms into the state of a particle in a specific location, time and space is when it is being viewed. Scientists refer to this process as 'popping in and out of existence'.\n\nWhat then is our physical universe if it is not truly solid and real? I mean, we can touch it, smell it, feel it, taste it, and see it (well, when we are looking at it and imagining it)...\n\n​There are theories that scientists have come up with in order to ask this profound question and elucidate upon the existence and workings of this quantum world which we do not see. It involves both the concept of the \"Field\" and the idea of the universe as being holographic.\n\nLet's first examine the Field concept. The field is said to be a field of unlimited possibilities out of which everything is created, and is known as many terms, some of which you may have heard, such as:\n\nThe unified field\n\nThe zero point field\n\n​The Planck scale (based on famous scientist Max Planck)\n\nThe implicate order\n\n**​The quantum wave function**\n\nAnd how does the 'field' create reality? Quantum physicists say that the process is very similar indeed to that in which a hologram is made. What they are saying is that our universe is actually not real, but holographic.\n\nYou can not argue with this when you look at the true definition of the word hologram as being a virtual image, where an image can be reconstructed through information that is stored throughout the hologram. This demonstrates that the information pattern of a three-dimensional object can be encoded in a beam of light, which is more-or-less two-dimensional.\"\n\nTherefore just like what we understand to be 'virtual reality' in a game, images 'appear' to be there but they are not actually there in solid form or real reality. ​It is all an illusion.\n\nDespite its apparent solidity, the universe is at heart a phantasm - a gigantic and splendidly detailed hologram.\n\nIn understanding of all this, there is also some connection to the mystery of the workings and existence of the black hole. The idea that we live in a hologram probably sounds absurd, but it is a natural extension of our best understanding of black holes.\n\nWe are part of the whole called by us \" Universe\", a part limited in time and space. We are experiencing ourselves through our thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of our consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for all human beings, restricting us to grow and expand our consciousness.", "timestamp": 1635592854, "digest": "YOc7UC8vrQTUW6ThUWd5LFSw8fxdYMUqcivU3BAcfNc", "contributor": "0xD0d1dfB7Df6d563BA87eEACB55D8EA3ef23525a3"}

{"id": "GzuJ_AvqsxClMoFxnlr2tjKjQOrbkA7jcEHMyJepSaA", "title": "#meta: the cultural appropriation of web3", "body": "On Thursday Mr. Zuckerberg took Facebook to the next level: Meta. Within 24 hours, the word meta, which is really more of a prefix than standalone word, topped both [Google search](https://trends.google.com/trends/trendingsearches/daily?geo=US) and [Tweet volume trends](https://www.exportdata.io/trends/worldwide/2021-10-28) worldwide. As a prefix, meta is commonly used to describe things that refer to themselves. Like metadata being data about data, or metamemes being memes about memes. So why did one of the most egocentric silicon valley CEOs decide to rebrand his imperium of companies to a self-referential-prefix? \n\n### Facebook says “Rebrand”\n\nThe rebrand manifests earlier talks of turning Facebook into “a metaverse company”. It also distances other brands in Mr Zuckerberg’s imperium from the deteriorating Facebook family name, according to [Forbes](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/technology/facebook-meta-name-change.html) and [the Guardian.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/29/mark-zuckerbergs-role-in-facebook-rebrand-may-backfire-experts-say)\n\nIn Facebook’s words: “Meta’s focus will be to bring the metaverse to life”. According to the founder’s [letter](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/) accompanying the rebrand, Facebooks metaverse will  be an immersive, embodied virtual space, “where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it” (like going drinking with my friends in an online game and actually feeling tipsy, I guess?). The letter also states that “the metaverse will not be created by one company”, should include open standards like Crypto and NFTs and incorporate new governance models. Whether this actually refers to the inclusion of external parties or only to companies under the Meta brand remains to be seen. “Meta” would suggest the latter. \n\n### Disagree. I say “Internet Imperialism” \n\nBy rebranding to Meta, Mr. Zuckerberg is appropriating an important concept from gaming and especially web3 culture. I call this “internet imperialism”, by which Facebook wants to capitalize on a concept which at it’s core encompasses an anti-surveillance-capitalist-bigtech, decentralized, grassroots driven, diverse and creative vision for our digital future. That’s not ok. The Metaverse was explicitly anti Facebook and Mr Zuckerberg shouldn’t copyright that. Let me explain.\n\n### The metaverse is evolving as a cultural artefact in gaming and web3 \n\nThe term Metaverse was first coined by Neil Stephenson’s 1992 scifi novel Snow Crash and popularized by movies such as Ready Player One. Books, movies and the concepts they birth often evolve into cultural artifacts. Culture here refers to [“the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time\"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/culture). Think french culture, coffee culture or Berlin techno subculture. Cultures exist both online and offline.

{"id": "R7-c-AxrSSj32HOeQZc01fuxBrE6F1eikM2EuCwO2XI", "title": "Odyssey I — The Dark Forest", "body": "It lies before me, the accursed place that all men fear. The overarching canopy blocks out the light of the sun and moon. Thin rays pierce through it for brief moments when the clouds break way. However, the forest retains cloud cover as if it has them on a leash. For you see, this forest does not want to be seen. It wants to be hidden from the light of the world and from the eyes of those who wander.\n\nIf a man has the desire to find his true destiny, he will, at one point, wander into the forest at great peril. This forest, you see, is filled with demons, monsters, and other fantastical creatures. It is devoid of any light, save that which the man brings with him. Those who wander into the dark forest without light are bound to be consumed by it. Do not trust the lightless men who return.\n\nI stand at the border, peering into the ever-growing labyrinth. It is at this moment that I must trust in my light and journey into darkness. The light of the outside world quickly fades to as I step in, torch in hand, flame alight. The trail is narrow, the bush is thick. I pull out my sword, the sharpened steel glistens in the firelight. I hack the vines that block my path and continue into the depths. Whatever shall I find?\n\nIn the blackness beyond the reaches of my torchlight, I see scores of floating eyes, watching, waiting, hoping that my light burns out. For once it does, they will come at me like water upon rock, slowly etching away my very soul. For a moment, I feel I had made a mistake — that I had stepped into the forest, unready and in folly. The doubt quickly faded as I realized that it was the forest whispering to me. The thoughts were not my own.\n\nCutting through more of the bush, I made my way deeper into the trees. With every step, the forest grew thicker, the thorns grew sharper, and the eyes that watched me multiplied. I dared not venture from the path, to uncover what creatures observed me so intently. Whatever they were, they would not take me this night. I had a quest to fulfill, one that I had started when I was a young boy, and only now, as an adult, was I truly beginning the journey.\n\nAs I moved further into the depths, the eyes that crowded the distance began to encroach. Whatever vile creatures crept in the shadows were coming for me now. They moved not with swiftness, but in a terrifying languid way. Their silence lifted, and howls began to echo through the trees — howls of hunger.\n\nI arrived at a wall of vines and thorns. They were so tightly intertwined that it appeared solid. The path ended at the wall. I frivolously attempted to cut my way through, but the vines grew back as soon as I reared for another slice. What magic possessed these plants? It was a dark magic, no doubt. One that was there to corrupt me and my light — the light!\n\nI took the torch in hand and lit the wall ablaze. Foul screams erupted from the wall, like thousands of dying wenches. The high-pitched squeals continued as the wall turned to ash, and the growing light of the flame scared away those watchful eyes. My light had outshone the darkness at this test. The weapons of men could not cut down the wall to the inner forest, only my light could do so. For those who failed to grow their light bright enough, I fear for their demise.\n\nBefore me stood an empty glade and a break in the canopy. The ground was soft with green blades of grass lit by the moonlight. They were cold to the touch, yet filled me with calm. Looking up, I could see the stars flickering in the celestial sky. The outer planets rested in their nightly orbits, and the moon stood proud above the centre of the glade, watching over my progress.\n\nA falling star, the angels of the night, shot across the cosmos, descending on the world below. It was falling straight into the glade. The light blinded me, and I recoiled as it impacted the earth before me. After a few moments, the light faded to a dim glow and in the crater of a star lay a beautiful maiden. I approached her carefully, fearing yet another test from the forest.\n\nShe was stunning on all accounts. Adorned in white robes, she stood unshaken from the heights from which she had fallen. Her hair did not obey the laws of nature of this world, the blonde locks seemed to float as if she was underwater. The amber colour of her eyes drew me in. I had never seen a real angel before and was mesmerized by what I beheld.\n\n“You enter the forest. Risking all. Why?” asked the angel.\n\n“I am ready to uncover my destiny. I have grown my light, lived in virtue and truth, and stayed away from the corruption of this world. I had a feeling that I must venture here, to defeat any remaining demons.”\n\n“When you look upon me, what do you see?”\n\n“I see an angel, one who is filled with perfection, graceful yet bewitching,” I responded.\n\n“Yes, graceful and bewitching. You have passed the test. Not all understand that the angel can just as well be a demon. You are wise, unlike others who venture into this place. You may continue.”\n\nThe fallen star lifted from the glade, her flowing white robes began to glow as she shot back into the night sky. I was now alone again, and the eyes of the watchers returned. They peered from the edge of the glade but dared not enter.\n\nI stepped beyond the crater and made my way to the centre of the glade. Here, I found a stone well filled with dark water. I was parched from my journey thus far, yet felt I should not drink from the well. Instead, I peered over the edge, and I saw myself in the reflection as a vile demon. Horns grew from my forehead, and my eyes were filled with blackness. Veins were visible across my face with pulses of inky blood running through them.\n\nAt first glance fear swept over me, a desire to flee this evil well. I soon realized that the well was me. This reflection was my own shadow. I must address it, I thought.\n\n“So this is it, where the forest leads?”\n\n“Yes, you know who I am, and I know who you are,” said the shadowy reflection.\n\n“Who are you?” I demanded.\n\n“I am you, and you are me,” a smirk stretched across his face.\n\n“You have made it to this point, I am impressed. You now have a choice.”\n\n“What is this choice? And is it a trick? I don’t trust you,” I admitted.\n\n“Very wise. But I must still relay the choice to you. You may trust me or not.”\n\n“Alright, give it.”\n\n“First, I must congratulate you. You have passed all three tests within the forest. And now, for the choice. You may cast me away, destroy my grasp on your mind and live without darkness. Or you can join with me and together, we can use the balance to become powerful and achieve great victories.”\n\n“This is the choice,” I asked.\n\n“Yes, you must choose,” my shadow responded.\n\n“Why only two choices? The tests were in threes. The trinity is three. Yet the choice is two? What is the third?”\n\nSuddenly, the ground beneath me began to shake. The stars in the sky began to orbit so quickly that all turned to streaks of white. The eyes of the watchers fled once again, and the forest shrieked as if dying. The water in the well erupted skyward, raining down upon me like a thick syrup, throwing me to the ground. The sun rose in a matter of seconds, my eyes were slow to adjust. The night sky had become day.\n\nI now saw the forest in a new light. The watchers that had filled many men with fear were fauns, deer, and squirrels. They were not the terrifying beasts of lore. The tales were wrong. The dark forest had become a forest of light. Sounds of running water could now be heard. Meadows were all about, with lambs resting with wolves. And the thickness of the brush fell away to an open and inviting paradise.\n\nWiping the viscous liquid from my face, I stood in awe of the transformation. The well was now emptied of my shadow, for he was nowhere to be seen or heard. Peering into the well revealed a golden key. To my right, a doorway was carved into a mighty tree. I realized what this all meant now. I had passed all of the tests. I wouldn’t have been unable if not for the preparation that my life had given me. Those who journey into darkness without the hardships of light would be unable to pass.\n\nTaking the key in hand, I turned to the doorway and to a new realm.", "timestamp": 1635597159, "digest": "gCqgUtwrr32yf46oAx-BKKcMSkfP7l2rln-C9GHJOrw", "contributor": "0x653b9EA6AC3d6424a2eC360BA8E93FfaAfdA8CA1"}

And the scariest. I know it sounds stupid and indulgent to say that, especially coming from another hetero-normative dude in black Christian Diors like me. (Whatever, they were knock-offs.) But given the extraordinary features of this interaction, along with its consequences for how people think of themselves, I really don’t think it’s an exaggeration. All of this is true by the way. I don’t have the time to make any of this up, and frankly I sucked pretty bad in Language Arts. My grade-school teachers will bug out if they read this.**\n\n**My band was doing a show in Salt Lake City–you know, Mormon utopia in the middle of the desert. Our next gig in Boise had been cancelled for reasons we didn’t entirely understand. When you’re on the road you just kind of run with things, I guess. We decided to hang out in Utah for a couple of days. Somebody said we could “backpack in the watercolor meadows of the Uintahs”. Sounded like a good time. We do retrowave electronica stuff, lots of synthy sounds with flashing lights and voice effects. Everyone’s into the eighties again, even the Mormons it turns out.**\n\n**I still don’t think of myself as a hook-up guy, even after all these years on the road. I’m serious. It’s not something I enjoy or even particularly like. I see hook-ups as one of the rites of being a traveling musician, or maybe even a curse. It’s like how prime ministers have to shake hands with people they don’t necessarily like. I’m a reluctant diplomat of the grunge scene. Everything that guys like David Bowie did make total sense to me. They turned their lives upside-down just to try and find something real. I wonder if they ever found it–when I did, it scared the crap out of me.**\n\n**The first Tinder girl I met in Utah was one of those “it’s for a good cause”-type chicks. I’m not trying to offend anybody, it’s just the only way I can think to describe her. What annoys me about those girls is that they all have the same personality. They’re almost breathless to prove how angry they are about all the *right* things. It makes me feel like everything I know is wrong or something. You just sit there and listen and drown in their syndicated outrage. I swiped right for shallow reasons, yes. The messed-up thing is that I anticipated my annoyance as I glanced at her pics. I was shamelessly undeterred.**\n\n**Her peach spaghetti-strap top swallowed most of my attention, even as she soliloquized about non binary love and dying pandas. (OK, I made that last one up.) Her blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail. It was less a conversation and more a kind of reciting on her part–anyone could’ve been sitting in front of her. I wonder if she would’ve acted differently if she knew who I was. A few hours later, I finished softly somewhere in the bobbing bramble of hair in my lap. It was depressing. She fixed her ponytail in the mirror, checked her phone, then quickly left.**\n\n**I don’t usually let people get to know me too well, not even my bandmates. I mean we drop acid together sometimes, bro-bonding stuff, that kind of thing. That’s about it. Even with girls, I’m a sex-in-the-dark kind of dude. They probably think I’m weird but I never ask. When the peach-top pedant was leaving I gave her one of our albums on cassette tape. It was awkward (“Uh, thanks…?”) but I feel like it’s the best I can do.**\n\n**Somewhere in the discussion of her saintly works, she had mentioned something her uncle had seen in a mall near downtown Salt Lake City. It was like an upright human with amphibian skin or something. Her uncle was a janitor who cleaned floors there late at night. The thing had come out of a basement stairwell, looked at him for a moment, then turned right back around and disappeared. The really crazy thing was that her uncle said he felt some kind of emotion deep in his chest that he never felt before, sort of like how you feel when you lock eyes with a stranger that looks inexplicably familiar. She reported all of this as a joke, rattling it off at blinding speed in her machine-gun dialogue of goodspeak. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, though, even when we started making out.**\n\n**The guys in our band like to joke about the golden thumb–it’s when you start a streak of matching with the city’s hottest women. That’s millennial serendipity at its finest. Isaac had the golden thumb in Topeka and we didn’t see him until Michigan, but in Michigan the algorithms failed him. It works in mysterious ways. When I matched with this Clarissa girl from Provo, I decided Salt Lake City *was* a promised land, or at least my own Topeka. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, nor has that condition of not-knowing changed. But let me back up...**\n\n**Clarissa was one of those one-pic profiles, which is risky. You’re betting that this single picture is so alluring that the opposite swiper needs no further proof of your hotness. In her case, it was a win. She was wearing a black romper striped orange, yellow, green; her hair was blue and cut boyishly short. The obligatory septum piercing made her nose look like a jewelled accessory. Style, attitude, cuteness. Bad-ass but delicate. The interesting part: the picture wasn’t a picture but actually a moving boomerang, one of those images perpetually repeating two seconds of movement.**\n\n**The boomerang showed Clarissa from behind, jogging in-place on a sidewalk with her face looking coyly back into the camera. I don’t need to mention the advantages such an angle affords those of the requisite affinities–but there was something else. Something *else.* There looked to be a kind of independent movement beneath the fabric around her tailbone, like an appendage that was rising and falling as she ran. You could *just* make out the outline. It couldn’t be…**\n\n**I put my phone away and started pumping some beat-mixes to get my mind straight. Things couldn’t be *that* freaky in Utah. My headphones weren’t loud enough to block out the image. The thing that bothered me most was that my attraction to her hadn’t waned; if anything, I felt *more* attracted. Had I been watching too many shapeshifter animes? That was probably the case regardless.**\n\n**Even so, there was no doubt that Clarissa’s festive romper was hiding a full-grown tail–like, none at all.  I watched the boomerang over and over again, turning my phone this way and that. There was no other conclusion. I considered calling my bandmates for brotherly support but in the end opted for privacy. Imagine if they heard I was seeing a girl with a *tail.* Literally a tail dangling down her rear. Her caption read: “Wyoming-raised, Utah-grown. I don’t want to go to Paris or Prague. Take me to a hidden place we can share secrets.” It was just too much.**\n\n**The first time I met Clarissa it was somewhere near State St. It’s hard for me to keep track of the roads because they’re all numbered on a grid based on their proximity to the Mormon temple. Clarissa told me that this system makes it easier to get around and not get lost. She laughed when I disagreed. We ate vegan wraps in one of those generic Salt Lake plazas made of Mexican eateries and Asian stores. Clarissa explained that she ate healthy when it suited her schedule and mood, which made her “a seasonal vegan”. It was summertime in Salt Lake; she wore a dirty-green tank-top and gray denim shorts ripped across the thighs; her hair was bluer than Freddie Mercury’s stage lighting.**\n\n**She was one of those girls who was easy to talk to, but from whom you couldn’t allow your attention to waver. Clarissa was no prolific talker. Instead I got a watchful loner vibe, someone you’d see walking along deserted railroad tracks, someone who considered Bjork their private therapist. I kept imagining how I could bring the topic up without coming across as a total creep. “I didn’t know people in Utah had tails...is that common here?” Gross. Maybe something more personal. “That romper you had on does a lot for your tail.” God, no. I settled on: “Can you show me that running move from your profile?”**\n\n**We were walking along the sidewalks in the glow of the street lamps; night had fallen on the strange city made of numbers. Clarissa’s hand was clasped softly in mine. I kept resisting the temptation to look behind her like an idiot. She was pressing me with questions somewhat absently. When I told her my band’s name was Nineteeneightyfornicate, she lost it and started going through all of our pictures on Instagram. That name was Isaac’s idea, not mine! It did have a nice ring to it.**\n\n**She stopped walking and turned on me suddenly.**\n\n**“You know, don’t you?”**\n\n**“Know–know what?” I stammered lamely.**\n\n**“Oh come off the bullshit, man. You’ve known this whole time.” Staring me frankly in the eyes, she took my hand and ran it along something long, firm, cylindrical on her backside. My heartbeat quickened and a soft moan emitted from my throat. Clarissa giggled and threw my hand away.**\n\n**“Any secrets you’d like to share with me?”**\n\n**I looked at her for a second, processing. “I already told you my dirty band name–”**\n\n**“Right,” she scoffed. “I hope you come up with something better by tomorrow.”**\n\n**She turned and began receding into the jasmine-bordered shadows. I realized that we had been surrounded by cats ever since we started walking. They now trailed her in unison like a row of ducklings down the sidewalk.**\n\n**“I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE A CAT PERSON!” I yelled hopelessly.**\n\n**She laughed and raised a long middle finger into the air without turning around. I sighed and began walking in the other direction back to my hotel. I opened my phone to a new text message from Clarissa. It didn’t say anything; she’d only sent three cat emojis with their tails in the air. I marveled at how little I knew what in the hell was going on. *I just stroked a human tail. That really happened.* And yet, perversely, I couldn’t wait for the next day.**\n\n***....Any secrets you’d like to share with me…***\n\n**I’ll come clean–that night wasn’t the first time I googled “humans with tails”. There had been drunken nights alone that I obsessed over the idea. My thoughts were ransacked by half-humanoids risen from primordial tetrapods, dripping with sea-foam and tails dragging in the sand. I told you I was a weird guy. To this point, the greatest harm all this had done was butcher my online algorithms–I would get ads for kinky Halloween costumes, which routinely raised some eyebrows.**\n\n***She could be a government spy on some troll-job,* I thought to myself. The idea tormented me for several hours. What was worse, I thought, the CIA using search history and store-bought accessories to play with my mind, or the possibility that I had met some kind of hybrid human with a rope of flesh swinging from her backside? The little bit of ganja I had left made my speculations thicker and more confusing. She had to be real. Why would the government waste time mind-fucking a guy from a band named Nineteeneightyfornicate? I went from that to wondering what she ate when she was stoned.**\n\n**Before I knew it, I was stepping out onto the curb in front of her house in my black knock-off Christian Diors. Who was this profane intruder in Provo? An agent *provo*cateur, I grinned to myself. I didn’t know there could be neighborhoods with trees in the desert. Seemed like the Mormons were pretty good landscapers when they weren’t busy granting all their wives eternal life. Who knew! Clarissa lived in a blue house with a quaint little front porch, one of those places that really has the picture-book mailbox with a perfect red lever pointed upwards.**\n\n**“Were you tailing me earlier?”**\n\n**Clarissa’s voice came out of nowhere, disembodied. I looked around me wildly, my unease ratcheting up several notches. A hand rested on my shoulder from behind; I wheeled around.**\n\n**“Chill out, freak,” Clarissa laughed. She looked at the tree next to her, brushing off some twigs. “My nest is up *there*.”**\n\n**“Your–nest?”**\n\n**“It’s a joke, heard of those before?”**\n\n**I suddenly noticed she was wearing a yellow Walkman cassette player. We always BS that if we meet a chick with a portable cassette player, we’ll automatically drop to one knee, no questions asked.**\n\n**“So you’re that much of a dork that you listen to cassette tapes in 2020?!”**\n\n**“And you’re telling me you don’t have one on you right now?”**\n\n**Wordlessly, I raised my band’s cassette tape out of my pocket.**\n\n**“Give me that,” she laughed, snatching it out of my hand. “Maybe we *are* a match!”**\n\n**I followed her inside.**\n\n**“My roommates are out for the weekend”–glancing at the couch–”you can just shove all that shit over, sorry. We have beer, lemonade, soda...or maybe you like the harder stuff?”**\n\n**I settled in and tried to relax, taking in what was around me. Nothing odd really. There was a crystal salt lamp whose warm glow looked afloat in the dim room. I could faintly sniff sage. A white cat met my gaze and darted out of sight, desperate to be forgotten.**\n\n**“You don’t get many visit–”**\n\n**The sentence was robbed from my throat. Clarissa was putting a glass of Jack Daniels on the table, naked beside the burgundy lingerie faintly interrupting her skin. I could see the thing in plain sight–it was moving from side to side in a sort of carefree, feline attitude, *curling* back on itself this way and that, hairless and freckled as it tapered to its tip. It was a magnificent tail, too magnificent to be an accident. I closed my eyes and took a shot of the Jack.**\n\n**“I know what you’re thinking,” Clarissa smiled. She sat down next to me, running her hand along my shoulder. “You’re thinking ‘it’s impossible, this can’t actually be happening.’”**\n\n**“You must be psychic,” I shot back dryly.**\n\n**“You’re thinking,” she pressed on, “that science eliminates the possibility of my existence.”**\n\n**I didn’t say anything.**\n\n**“What’s wrong, rock star, you don’t want to play along? I know that you know it all–how they say a human tail is only an abomination of the coccyx, a *vestige* of the behind that we all left behind...right?”**\n\n**“What are you getting at here, Clarissa?”**\n\n**She took a swig of lemonade and rolled the juice around her mouth, her gaze unbroken.**\n\n**“Nothing you haven’t already thought of ten thousand times, but I’ll humor you. If the only reason humans don’t have tails is because of some kind of disabled gene-signal, then the chances of more than one being on the planet is like one in billions. So if you realized there were *others like you*, that hypothesis would suddenly be on very thin ice.”**\n\n**My blood ran cold. I leaned all the way back on the sofa until my eyes were looking at the ceiling. The clustered nerve-endings were firing off in tingles that made it hard for me to resist the urge to let it squirm beneath me. All of my practiced methods for controlling the thing were failing. It was as if it somehow sensed another of its kind and now had license to awaken. She’d caught me by the tail.**\n\n**Clarissa leaned over me, her face close to mine. “Show it to me,” she whispered.**\n\n**No one had set eyes on it outside of my parents; I hadn’t seen them since they put me up for adoption. I sat up, pulled the back of my shirt up and leaned over. Her eyes felt like hot embers across its naked surface. She lifted it between her fingers, held it in her palm, caressed it. I suddenly noticed how heavily I was breathing.**\n\n**“There are many of us, you know,” she said softly.**\n\n**“How many?”**\n\n**Clarissa paused. “I don’t know, to be honest. But a lot. I met them in the genetic labs outside Salt Lake.”**\n\n**“Wait, genetic–”**\n\n**“Shhh!” She put a finger to my lips and straddled me, pulling my hands through her blue hair. “We’ll talk about it later.”**\n\n**I clutched her swaying tail and let its smoothness run through my fingers.**\n\n**“We’re a match,” she giggled, “a match made in some dirty heaven.”**\n\n**That evening, for the first time in my life, I surrendered fully to whatever it is that I am. Clarissa hasn’t left my side since; we’re in Cheyenne now. There’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think: I’ve never been happier–or more deeply, inconsolably frightened.**", "timestamp": 1635597640, "digest": "56648re9YKSnaRoHNgg2OrkLba9o04K-E3bNS5Hdiqc", "contributor": "0xBbb538b84ED95aBa94585c6cE7C2f8790dBfE53B"}

{"id": "uFoaYBjZZrtV3yH2mBupifcNsjxFGBtxvy8KTB_mv6M", "title": "Blockchain origin, concept definition, development history?", "body": "The origin of the voice  \n\nBlockchain originated from Bitcoin. On November 1, 2008, a person claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto published bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash System \\[4\\].  Based on P2P network technology, encryption technology, time stamp technology, blockchain technology and other electronic cash system architecture concept, which marks the birth of Bitcoin.  Two months later, the theory was put into practice. On January 3, 2009, the first Trands block with serial number 0 was born.  A few days later, on January 9, 2009, block numbered 1 appeared and was connected with Trands Block numbered 0 to form a chain, marking the birth of block chain \\[5\\].  \n\nIn recent years, the world's attitude toward bitcoin has waxed and waned, but blockchain technology, one of bitcoin's underlying technologies, is gaining traction.  During the formation of Bitcoin, blocks are storage units that record all communication between each block node over a period of time.  Each block is linked by random hashing (also known as hash algorithm), and the latter block contains the hash value of the previous block. With the expansion of information exchange, one block is connected with another block, and the result is called blockchain \\[6\\].  \n\nConcept definition speech  \n\nWhat is blockchain?  In terms of technology, blockchain involves math, cryptography, the Internet, computer programming and many other scientific and technological issues.  From an application perspective, to put it simply, blockchain is a distributed shared ledger and database that is decentralized, tamper-free, whole-process traces, traceable, collectively maintained, and open and transparent.  These features ensure the \"honesty\" and \"transparency\" of blockchain and lay the foundation for creating trust in blockchain.  However, the rich application scenarios of blockchain are basically based on the fact that blockchain can solve the problem of information asymmetry and realize collaboration trust and concerted action between multiple subjects \\[7\\].  \n\nBlockchain is a new application mode of distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanism, encryption algorithm and other computer technologies.  Blockchain is an important concept of Bitcoin. In essence, it is a decentralized database. At the same time, as the underlying technology of Bitcoin, it is a string of data blocks associated with the use of cryptography.  It is used to verify the validity of its information (anti-counterfeiting) and generate the next block \\[8\\].  \n\n\\[4\\] The term blockchain does not actually appear, but instead uses chain of blocks.  In the earliest Chinese translation of bitcoin white paper \\[9\\], chain of Blocks was translated into blockchain.  This is the earliest time that the Chinese word \"blockchain\" appeared.  \n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China issued the Provisions on the Management of Blockchain Information Services on January 10, 2019, which will come into force on February 15, 2019 \\[1\\].  \n\nAs an important breakthrough of independent innovation of core technology, the security risk of blockchain is regarded as a major shortcoming restricting the healthy development of the industry. Frequent security incidents ring the alarm bell for the industry.  To embrace blockchain, it is necessary to speed up the exploration and establishment of a security guarantee system adapted to the mechanism of blockchain technology.  \\[10\\]  \n\nDevelopment history phonology  \n\n \n\nThe concept of blockchain was first proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 \\[4\\]. In the following years, blockchain has become a core component of bitcoin, the electronic currency: as a public ledger for all transactions.  By leveraging peer-to-peer networks and distributed timestamp servers, blockchain databases can be managed autonomously.  The blockchain invented for Bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the problem of repeated spending.  Bitcoin's design has become a source of inspiration for other apps.  \n\nIn 2014, \"blockchain 2.0\" became a term for a decentralized blockchain database.  For this second-generation programmable blockchain, economists see it as a programming language that allows users to write more sophisticated and intelligent protocols \\[11\\].  Therefore, when the profit reaches a certain level, the profit can be obtained from the distribution of completed shipping orders or shared certificates.  Blockchain 2.0 technology skips transactions and \"intermediaries that act as arbitrators of money and information in the exchange of value\".  They are used to insulate people from the globalised economy, to protect privacy, to \"monetise information\" and to ensure that owners of intellectual property benefit.  The second generation of blockchain technology makes it possible to store a person's \"permanent digital ID and image\" and provide a solution to the \"underlying social wealth distribution\" inequality \\[12\\].  \n\nOn January 20, 2016, the People's Bank of China digital Currency Seminar announced that the research on digital currency has achieved phased results.  The meeting affirmed the value of digital currencies in reducing the issuance of traditional currencies, and said the central bank is exploring the issuance of digital currencies.  The expression of the People's Bank of China digital currency seminar greatly enhanced the confidence of the digital currency industry.  This is the first time that the central bank has expressed a clear attitude towards the digital currency after five ministries and commissions of the CENTRAL bank issued a notice on preventing bitcoin risks on December 5, 2013.  \\[13\\]  \n\nOn December 20, 2016, digital Currency Alliance -- China FinTech Digital Currency Alliance and FinTech Research Institute were officially established \\[14\\].  \n\nNowadays, Bitcoin is still the absolute mainstream of digital currency. Digital currency presents a state of a hundred flowers blooming, common ones include Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin and Dashcoin. In addition to currency applications, there are also various derivative applications.  Underlying application development platforms such as Ethereum, Ethereum and Asch, as well as industry applications such as NXT, SIA, Bitstock, MaidSafe and Ripple \\[15\\].  ", "timestamp": 1635601521, "digest": "2IqzEzbzus2WtyBZvk41e89gGHS7-Wnak5w7zHQy3TQ", "contributor": "0xD5B73938AefF07e165DF3629Ff757E2D0FD00E1B"}

But I believe that no company has done particularly well so far, otherwise why the examples are still perfect diary, Xibei... Talking about members, super users...\nHowever, in addition to tools or products with low customer unit price, most decisions of B2B enterprises are more complex and have many processes, so the sales method is still traditional. The main reasons are as follows:\n\n1. It takes time to change the customer's mind\n   Most intuitively, it is not realistic for large and medium-sized enterprises to change the relationship that can be maintained only by drinking, singing K, playing ball games and picking up children into online care and operation.\n   The common membership, points, discounts and so on in the B2C industry are of no use to corporate customers. In front of bidding and bidding, this small favor is nothing.\n   Of course, traditions are also changing.\n   For example, different departments within the enterprise are increasingly communicating and interacting directly with customers. Some enterprises for customers to establish \"a customer a group\" or \"a customer N internal group\", technology, pre-sale, after-sales all-round service.\n   Some enterprises also establish customer communities, such as technical community, to let customers participate in feedback or even product optimization, insight into customer needs, faster response and service.\n2. If there is no rigid demand, there will be no procurement\n   B2C demand can be stimulated by the level of product appearance, vanity, curiosity and so on, but NOT B2B, no demand, no purchase, this is the naked reality.\n   B2B marketing teams may be able to turn potential problems into requirements through initial contact with customers, understanding requirements, and guiding customers to new products and solutions at appropriate opportunities.\n   This process from excavation, incubation and transformation to sales may take a long time and requires digital means to manage, which is also the fundamental logic of SCRM now.\n3. It's not up to B2B users\n   Can B2B learn B2C? Of course, because the decision makers are people. But the biggest difference is that B2B decision makers and users are often not one person or a group of people.\n   Especially for those enterprises that need financial approval to buy a ruler or a stapler, it is a little difficult to change into a user-led purchase.\n   But users can influence decision makers, such as more shareable content, peer cases, industry white papers, and so on.", "timestamp": 1635601756, "digest": "RCMrhWjPmKJLn_s_5p4WCrHpg8TzbVpjRl7W2OxBRwM", "contributor": "0xAC8dDeE07b58D63AFdb3a2846dD0F10aA33D15fE"}

Tesla doesn't sell cars, it sells technology services.\nFor the automotive field, \"new energy vehicles\" is not a new product, \"intelligent mobile terminal\" is the real new product.\nSimilarly, in the consumer goods world, if you make a replacement or an upgrade, you're not really a new consumer product at all.\nFor example, traditional consumer goods are mainly oversold in stores, while you are selling through emerging channels such as Douyin Xiaohongshu Live. This kind of replacement or upgrade can be easily achieved with traditional consumer goods.\nAs I said in the \"New\" Scam of New Consumer Goods, the so-called \"new crowd\", \"new products\", \"new media\" and \"new channels\" of new consumer goods are all \"fake new\".\nThe reason why new consumer goods can be called new consumer goods is that the \"way of driving growth\" is different from traditional consumer goods. If new consumer goods do not find new ways to drive growth, the rest of the \"new\" is just skin deep.\nToday, we will disassemble a very important topic: where is the new consumption?\nWho is the \"elephant\" in new consumption?\nIn the field of new consumer goods, an interesting phenomenon is that it is very easy for a brand to go from 0-1 and easily achieve sales of 100 million +, but it is extremely difficult to go from 1-100. For 95% of new consumer goods, there is no path and no hope to break the one billion mark.\nThe world of new consumer goods is a world of quick life and quick death, a world of ants and no elephants.\nThe only \"elephant\" is a very low-key enterprise named Shein.\nA quick look at the brand through a set of descriptions:\n\n1. Shein's revenue in 2020 is $65 billion, equivalent to 1.5 Uniqlo stores;\n2. Shein is a cross-border fast fashion e-commerce company that buys clothes in 220 countries around the world, but its headquarters is in Nanjing, China;\n3. Shein has about 120 million registered users, ranking first in 56 countries in the Apple App Store;\n4. Shein was founded 13 years ago, last valued at $47 billion, and has been growing at more than 100% every year.\n   Shein is low-key because you won't see the company in almost any coverage until 2020. Everyone from the Wall Street Journal to Chinese Business weeklies missed the e-commerce giant.\n   Although many new consumer brands have created a big topic on the Internet in recent years, it is this seemingly low-key brand that really leads the new consumer wave.\n   Shein leads the new wave of consumption, and young girls overseas are addicted to Shein like Douyin. Shein opened its first store in Miami, and 125 people came into the store every hour in the first three days...\n   On the surface, Shein is the online version of Zara, taking the fast fashion route. All fast fashion brands have two characteristics: one is cheap, one is fast on the new speed.\n   Shein's popularity was first attributed to its outrageous price tag. $7 hoodies, $12 dresses, $17 jeans;\n   Shein outperformed LAN in the new speed. In general, uniqlo takes six months to update, Zara takes 14 days, and Shein takes seven days.\n   If you log in to Shein, the words \"new 1000+ daily\" are prominently displayed. Moreover, Shein's interface is more like Xiaohongshu than Taobao, with a large number of new styles + information flow interface, which can keep girls scrolling.\n   What exactly is Shein? Cheaper than Amazon, faster than Zara, more choice than Vipshop and as indulged as Tiktok, that's Shein.\n   The question is, how does it all work?\n   All clothing business, the biggest pain point is: how to grasp the trend? When consumers buy a piece of clothing, they have already passed the stage of quality selection. What we value is the aesthetic temperament expressed by design, tailoring and materials.\n   If the trend is wrong, the clothes produced will not be bought, and the unmarketable clothes will be overstocked and sold at a discount. Moreover, there is a long lead time between fashion prediction and product hitting the shelves. If the production cycle is too long, the tide will pass.\n   The reason why fast fashion brands beat traditional clothing brands is that Uniqlo, Zara and HM have solved this problem.\n   Fast fashion brands grasp the trend of the way is a word - copy. Pick all the hot styles of the big brands this season, and then refer to the design of the big brands for \"optimization\".\n   Then, according to different design styles, they will first produce some clothing orders in small batches, put them in the store to see the sales performance, and then place additional orders to the factory for the clothes that sell well. This mode is called \"quick return of small orders\" in the industry.\n   The reason why Shein's new speed catches up with Zara and other traditional fast fashion companies is that Shein has connected front-end sales and back-end factories in a digital way.\n   First, Shein will grab the data of the whole network to predict the trend of clothing.\n   Shein usually uses Google's Trend Finder tool to track all clothing products online and analyze the fabric, style, color, pattern and other information of clothing. At the same time, it will also grab the user's search terms on clothing. Changes in search terms plus changes in the clothing itself constitute Shein's algorithm map.\n   In 2018, Shein reportedly used this logic to successfully predict lace in summer and cotton in India.\n   Shein then guesses the fashion trends of the next season based on these data, and then makes a large number of orders for the goods, which are put on the shelves for sales testing.\n   Zara can test about six items at a time, while Shein can test 30 items at a time. And burst rate in 50%, unsalable rate of 10%.\n   Shein's APP is more like Xiaohongshu than Taobao, with a large number of new styles + information flow style products, allowing users to indulge in the ocean of buying and buying.\n   So Shein has a lot of data on consumer behavior. Shein can then use one party's data on its own site to continuously calibrate previous third-party data.\n   First, Shein integrates e-commerce data with factory data, allowing factories to directly add orders for popular products and adjust the output of different products.\n   Second, let the design team modify the products that are not selling well and remix the fashion elements until they become hits.\n   To accomplish all these, Shein needs not excellent designers, supply chain talents or e-commerce operators, but a huge team of big data and algorithms. It is said that Shein has recruited a technical team of about several hundred people in Shenzhen to be responsible for Shein's big data analysis and algorithm recommendation.\n   As a result, Shein is more like \"Douyin of clothing,\" a real new consumer company that uses big data and algorithms to transform traditional industries.\n   I guess that the upcoming \"Douyin E-commerce\" will also refer to or even simulate Shein's business model and challenge the traditional e-commerce with Alibaba, JINGdong and Vipshop as the core.\n   If I had to find a representative of \"new\" consumption, I think Shein is it. Because Shein is \"new\", it has found a new way to drive growth, rather than just using a new tool or optimizing a business segment.\n   Shein may not represent a new consumer industry, but it is a clothing brand and an e-commerce platform. But there's a basic lesson to be learned from Shein:\n   Only by innovating your business model can you become a new species. You have a chance to topple a seemingly impossible industry giant.\n   Douyin eclipsed IQiyi Youku not because short videos are newer and better than long ones, but because Douyin short videos are essentially a technology company and IQiyi Youku is essentially a content company.\n   Apple beat Nokia not because apple's phone is better looking and has a better experience, but because Apple is a mobile smart terminal and Nokia is still a mobile phone.\n   In the same way, if a new consumer brand is to truly lead the consumer wave, it must find new growth-driven models, not better packaging, younger demographics, newer channels and edgier marketing.\n   The \"new\" of new consumer goods should be \"innovative\" rather than \"old and new\". In my view, there are three things that distinguish truly new and traditional consumer goods:\n5. Unidirectional vs. bidirectional channels\n6. Dot vs. mesh\n7. Buying traffic vs. generative traffic\n   One-way channel VS two-way channel\n   This new consumption wave is more like a big explosion of new consumer categories, with many small and rare consumer categories popping up. Like these:\n   A. Hair and makeup\n   B. Fashion makeup for girls\n   C. Coconut light\n   Aromatherapy skin care\n   E. Oriental fragrance\n   F. Sleep environment brand\n   Countless new consumer products emerge, most of which tend to keep consumers fresh for a while and fade after a year or two.\n   The new consumer goods are like the idol trainees of that year, and the idols of that year are regarded as \"annual cast idols\" by their fans. The fate of most new consumer goods is the same as idol, become our annual sales products.\n   This is a big challenge for us to start a business, that is, it is difficult for us to grasp consumer demand. \"Hard to grasp\" does not mean that we cannot discern consumer needs, but that consumers' \"demand cycles\" are becoming shorter and their \"demand types\" more fragmentary.\n   In my opinion, it is hard for the next Wong Lo Kat and six walnuts to emerge at present, and it is hard for enterprises that rely on large single product strategy to succeed today.\n   In those days, when Wong Lo Kat launched herbal tea, there were only imitators and no competitors trying to innovate the category of herbal tea.\n   But now? An entrepreneur may have just developed a lime tea, and soon there will be a variety of flavor innovations: sweet lime, fragrant lime, green lime, hand whipped lime...\n   In other words, the lead time brought by \"category innovation\" is getting shorter and shorter.\n   The presence of imitators is not necessarily a bad thing, it shows that the category is promising, and the more players come in, the sooner the market ripens. What's really scary is that more \"category innovation\" keeps popping up, making your new category suddenly old and less unusual.\n   As requirements iteration speeds up and product life cycles shorten, traditional business models begin to weaken.\n   In the past, consumer goods entrepreneurship is to produce their own products, and then put the products in the store, and then through advertising and marketing for consumption tips, and finally when consumers use the after-sales service.\n   The traditional business chain goes like this:\n   The biggest problem with this business chain is that it is a one-way road. If any link fails, the rest cannot be sustained.\n   In the current consumer environment, a new product may just be introduced to jiangsu and Zhejiang markets, but even before it starts to spread nationwide, there will be more innovative products. We start to question ourselves, should we continue with the product we have, or should we introduce the newer product?\n   Again, we pull back to Shein's business model.\n   Shein's business chain has not changed, but what is different is that the traditional business chain is a \"one-way channel\", while Shein's business chain is a \"two-way channel\".\n   In Shein's business chain, the sales end can provide data feedback to the production end, so that the production end can better control the ever-changing needs of users.\n   What is the biggest difference between a one-way channel and a two-way channel? The \"one-way channel\" business model can only pursue a \"static\" business model.\n   The \"two-way channel\" because of continuous data feedback, so its product, selection, sales mode, service mode, can be based on the client data of continuous iteration, is a \"dynamic\" business model.\n   You may think that Shein can do this because it is essentially an e-commerce platform rather than a consumer product, and it belongs to the clothing industry and has many SKUs.\n   But let's recall whether the entrepreneurial logic of Yuanqi Forest is somewhat similar to Shein's logic.\n   Each media once advocated that Yuanqi Forest is \"making products just like making apps\" : it will first launch A series of products in different categories or different flavors of the same category, and then take them to the regional market for A/B test. Whichever product and flavor can stand out, it will push forward in the future.\n   The big difference between this approach and traditional business, where decisions are made entirely by people, is that we rely directly on data feedback and market effects to make decisions. But Yuanqi Forest does not have its own stores, nor does it have its own e-commerce platform, and its grasp of big data and algorithms is much worse.\n   The essence of \"two-way channel\" is to digitize offline services. Let the user's consumer behavior into data, fast feedback to the production and marketing end, forming a decision-making loop.\n   Dot brand VS mesh brand\n   The vast majority of new consumer products don't have brands at all, they just look good. The design of product packaging is good-looking, and the brand words are written with a sense of network. This is not called a brand, but a \"skin\".\n   A lot of traditional consumable is vulgar mediocre, a lot of new consumable is beautiful mediocre, both do not have how many difference.\n   Is there a difference in the way new consumer goods are branded versus traditional consumer goods?\n   Traditional consumer goods follow the pattern of finding an identity for a brand and then occupying it by penetrating the consumer's mind through saturation advertising.\n   I call this kind of brand \"point brand\", because the real valuable asset of a brand is almost a slogan, which the brand tries to pin into the heart of consumer goods in communication.\n   Traditional brands believe in \"domineering\", I don't care whether you like me or not, as long as I can occupy your attention, you can only hold me in your life.\n   But this approach is becoming less effective today, as \"centralised media\" is dying and all media is evolving towards \"a thousand faces\". Brands, especially new brands, should not attempt to dominate the minds of consumers, without the environment and budget.\n   The new generation of brand, can no longer believe in \"domineering\", to believe in \"king's way\". \"Hegemony\" and \"kingship\" may both be able to establish a state, but the difference is that \"hegemony\" can not care about the people, while \"kingship\" depends on the people to win the world.\n   Therefore, the current brand building is not to occupy the user's mind, but to create the possibility of \"being linked\". Let users sincerely support your brand, in order to achieve great achievements.\n   From \"occupy\" to \"be linked\", the brand of play to change.", "timestamp": 1635602099, "digest": "9ie3flrbqHAdmY8sQD-3lc-BofxiSvaJaUfydgwbeYY", "contributor": "0x5ce95Da89e73ef1822949cB0fcF69671d3eB8917"}

A great brand needs the efforts of all the organizations of the company. As CMO or brand director, on the basis of company strategy, we need to find the focal point of information from the source of business (brand undertaking track), and find the output point of information from consumer insight (brand orientation to consumers).\n\nExternal information unification.\n\nWhat a brand does determines who you are in the consumer's mind. All propagating activities should be reasonably paced within the proper range. CMO or brand director, before you do brand control, you need to know what the standards are.\n\nWe try to carry out fine division, find the underlying logic of brand house.\n\nSince the brand house is a house, it has its own structure. From strategy to tactics, from roof to bottom, we divide it into four sections: mental occupation, interest expression, argument support and product provision.\n\nThese four sections are gradually advancing, echoing each other to achieve the effect of brand strategy management.\n\nThe mind occupied\n\nBrand positioning from market positioning, occupy the market is to win the hearts of the people. The dividend of the heart is the dividend of the market. Therefore, the occupation of the mind is an important way of brand development.\n\nBrand positioning: for whom (target consumers)? What category do you belong to? Solve what problem? What can be achieved? Because you have reason 1/2/3 (RTB system).\n\nThe category here, namely the consumer demand category, is the customer logic, rather than divorced from the so-called imagined market logic or factory logic.\n\nBrand proposition: brand proposition provides customers with functional value, emotional value and self-expression value. Effective value proposition is the way to drive the brand to establish customer relationship.\n\nBrand tonality: what kind of impression does this brand insist on in the process of communication?\n\nBrand slogan: is to convey brand concept, long-term communication with consumers slogan. Brand is the brand dimension, conveys the brand concept or product selling point. Slogan is a communicative dimension, short and provocative pep talk. Long-term is the implementation dimension, refers to a long time, repeated use.\n\nPositioning is the foundation, with positioning, there will be advocated value propositions. Based on brand positioning or brand characteristics, there will be brand tonality, with the expression of brand positioning, there will be brand slogan communication.\n\nInterest expression\n\nBrands originate from customer needs, products solve problems and provide consumer benefits. Brand positioning is rooted in consumer demand, and interest expression is oriented to \"consumer solutions\".\n\nCore target audience: products serve demand, demand from the crowd. The core target group here is not as detailed as the user portrait, mainly determined age, gender, social role.\n\nInterest points are divided into functional interest and emotional interest, functional interest is the category itself, to solve the physical needs. Emotional benefit is a category of consumer meaning, or brand in this big consumer meaning itself on a subdivision.\n\nArguments to support\n\nThe argument is the RTB system, why are you believed?\n\nWho you are, brand positioning, why you can be who, is the support of the argument. From the perspective of skin care products, RTB (Reason To Believe) is mainly the core technology and main ingredient.\n\nProducts provide\n\nUnder the origin of brand positioning, what series of products do you have? These series are mainly from the point of view of product selling points or related configurations.\n\nBrand positioning is not empty talk, need its products to answer. The former describes what they are, the latter what they can do.\n\nProduct matrix is not just a combination of multiple products, but also together to consolidate the brand positioning.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n  \n\nConclusion:\n\nWe should not brand house for brand house's sake. The house is shape, and the communication is god. Brand house expresses not only the strategic power of the enterprise, but also the tactical power of communication.\n\nBrand house is one of the effective means of strategy leading ability of brand strategy people. It is not only the \"take\" of brand positioning and expression, but also the \"give up\" in the process of taking.", "timestamp": 1635602241, "digest": "T-LWCU1e_3YHwN3EIgUzJy763qHJEiOTTJWEQZY3bqc", "contributor": "0x4C2ea40099c2eeeD330fd2eFC2d9cAad013b691d"}

These biases can lead us to infer information from the wrong sources, always try to confirm existing beliefs, or even fail to reconstruct the truth of events!\nYes, it's part of human nature -- but this cognitive bias can have profound effects on our careers, investments, and lives in general.\nWhat is cognitive bias?\nHumans tend to think in certain ways, which can lead to systematic biases in rational judgments.\nThese tendencies often arise from:\nInformation processing short circuit\nThe limited processing power of the brain\nEmotion and moral motivation\nDistortions in memory storage and recall\nSocial influence\nResearchers in cognitive science, social psychology and behavioral economics have studied cognitive biases for decades, but they are actually particularly important in today's information-rich world.

Familiarity bias: An investor invests her money in \"what she knows\" rather than seeking the obvious benefits of portfolio diversification.

Attribution bias: Entrepreneurs excessively attribute their company's success to themselves rather than other factors (team, luck, industry trends).

Anchoring bias: Employees in salary negotiations rely too much on the first number mentioned in the negotiation, rather than rationally examining a range of options.\n4. Survivor bias: Starting a business seems easy because there are so many successful entrepreneurs in the world. However, this is a cognitive bias: successful entrepreneurs are seen, but millions of failed ones are not.\n5.

{"id": "kCQH2BjplPjlpOCytGBkB9yQIVzkNjleRTaErXnXdXE", "title": "What is cognitive ability? Meaning and Definition？", "body": "What is cognition? The word comes from the Latin root cognoscere, meaning 'to know'. When we talk about cognition, we usually mean everything related to knowledge. In other words, we have accumulated information through learning and experience.\n\nCognition, by its accepted definition, is the ability to process information through perception (that is, we get stimuli through different senses) and is an important process of acquiring knowledge, while our subjective features enable us to integrate all this information into the analysis and interpretation of our world. In other words, cognition is what we perceive about ourselves from different sources (perception, experience, belief......) The ability to absorb and process received information and convert it into knowledge. Cognition includes the different cognitive processes of learning, attention, memory, language, reasoning, decision-making, etc., and is an important part of shaping our intellectual development.\n\nStudy cognition from different disciplines, such as neurology, psychology, anthropology, philosophy, and even information science. However, the in-depth study of cognitive psychology is the study of how to deal with the influence of information on behavior and the relationship with the acquisition of knowledge in different mental processes. Cognitive psychology emerged in the late 1950s in opposition to popular behaviorism. The revolutionary scientific theories of writers such as Piaget and Vigotsky and their research on cognitive learning are still relevant today. Since the '60s, people have been more and more interested in studying cognitive ability, which is why we have so many results.\n\nAdvances in neuroimaging have contributed to the study of neuroanatomy and our understanding of mental processes and how they affect our behavior and emotions.\n\nWhat is cognition?\n\nCognitive processes\n\nWhat is the cognitive process? We can think of it as a cognitive process in which we make decisions and understand based on all knowledge or new knowledge. Different cognitive functions play different roles in these processes: perception, attention, memory, reasoning...... Each of these cognitive functions works together to integrate new knowledge and create interpretations of the world around us.\n\nPerception as a cognitive process: Cognitive perception allows us to organize and understand stimuli received through our different senses, such as sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. While most are familiar with common sense, there are a few others that are less well known about sensation, spatial sensation (the involuntary sensation of our position in space and the stimulation of spatial orientation) and vocal sensation (which is our sense of organs in our bodies). What it is can let us know when we are hungry, or thirsty. Once the stimulus is received, our brain integrates all the information and creates a new memory.\n\nAttention is a cognitive process: Attention is a stimulus that allows us to focus on cognitive processes or activities in order to process information more thoroughly. Attention is a basic cognitive function that we use a lot in our daily lives. In fact, it is thought to be the mechanism that controls and regulates the rest of the cognitive process: perception (we need to be aware that we must be able to exclude stimuli received by our senses) in order to learn and reason complex.\n\nMemory as a cognitive process: Memory is the cognitive function that allows us to process, store, and recover information from the past. Memory is a fundamental process of learning because it is the ability to create our sense of identity. There are many types of memory, such as short-term memory, which is the ability to retain information for a short time (remember a phone number until we can write it down on paper), and long-term memory, which is all we retain for a long period of time. Long-term memory can be broken down into more specific, declarative and procedural memories. Declarative memory includes information gained through language and education (e.g., knowing that World War II ended in 1945), knowledge gained, and knowledge gained from personal experience (remember that my grandmother used to make it for me). Procedural memory is when there are learning routines (learning how to drive a car or ride a bike). Other types of memory are auditory memory, episodic memory, naming, and recognition.\n\nThinking is a cognitive process: thought is the foundation of all cognitive processes. It enables us to integrate all the information we have received and establish relationships between events and knowledge. To do this, it uses reasoning, synthesis, and problem-solving (administrative) capabilities.\n\nThe process of language cognition: Language is the ability to express our thoughts and feelings orally. This is the tool we use to communicate, organize and deliver information about ourselves and the world. Language and thinking are closely related, they influence each other and develop together.\n\nLearning is thought of as a cognitive process: it is the cognitive process we use to combine new information with our existing knowledge. Learning involves different things and so on. We develop social behaviors or habits by learning, like brushing our teeth or walking, and memorizing knowledge. Piaget and other writers talk about learning as a process by which our cognitive system takes in and processes information.\n\nCognitive processes\n\nCognitive processes can occur naturally or artificially, consciously or unconsciously, but they often develop very quickly, constantly trying to improve without achieving the desired outcome. For example, when we walk down the street and we see traffic lights turn red, we begin to generate cognitive processes that tell us what to do (pass or not pass). The first thing we did was to focus our attention on the traffic light, which was red by sight. In milliseconds, we draw information from our memory that when a traffic light is red, you should not pass; But we also remember that sometimes, if there is no car then we can pass. This gives us a decision: wait until the light turns green to pass, or look left and right (again to divert our attention) to see if there is a car coming, and pass when there is none.\n\nCan cognitive abilities be improved?\n\nIs it possible to improve cognition? How to improve it? Here we show you a tool to enhance and improve your cognitive abilities:\n\nCogniFit's cognitive stimulation program was designed by a team of neurologists and cognitive psychologists to investigate the plasticity of learning synapses and the processes of neural development. All you need (2-3 times a week) is 15 minutes to stimulate your cognitive processes. : The program can be used online and then has specific plans for individuals, researchers, health professionals and schools.\n\nCogniFit's cognitive stimulation exercises effectively assess over 20 basic cognitive functions, accurately test against objectives and provide different age-standard levels, and compare standard levels based on results.\n\nDifferent interactive exercises come in the form of puzzle games that you can practice on your computer. After each training, CogniFit presents a detailed picture of the user's evolving cognitive state and how it compares to other users' cognitive functions. CogniFit online clinical exercises have been shown to promote the reorganization of new synapses and neural circuits and restore cognitive function in deteriorated cognitive areas.\n\nNeuroscience and the plasticity of the brain have shown us that the more you use neural circuits, the stronger the brain's neural circuits are. CogniFit's cognitive stimulation program helps explore our cognitive processes. Only when we understand each person's cognitive state can we provide them with personalized cognitive training programs. Focusing on the most challenging tasks, making sure we're creating and building new neural connections, the brain is getting stronger as a result of training.\n\nCan you improve your cognitive level?\n\nReduce stress levels: Stress increases cortisol levels, while attacking axons and myelin sheaths block effective transmission of information. If we can reduce stress in our lives, we may be able to improve our cognition, because reducing stress improves synaptic connections. Keeping a positive attitude makes us more creative in solving problems and makes our thinking more flexible.\n\nMeditate: Meditation can also help us improve our cognition. In the past few years, there has been increasing research into the effects of meditation on cognitive processes. Because it requires conscious focus and attention on a task, as we said, is an important skill for creating new neural network connections. This study demonstrates that meditation is involved in improvements in attention, memory, executive function, increased reaction times, and general cognitive function.\n\nPhysical Activity: Exercise to improve cognition. It doesn't have to be particularly intense. In fact, walking for 45 minutes three times a week improved memory and reasoning (administrative functions), and tai chi also improved key executive functions.", "timestamp": 1635602335, "digest": "pDmBWH8kwFrFfRBhs721_nvUdo5BJ7xB_TkyFZhfNfs", "contributor": "0x798909489740aD7c8a1A3736511e5B3eCF841F77"}

These 8 must-see tips for Newcomers?", "body": "Today we share, how to title, to more attractive? A number of clicks on the article, is inseparable from a moving title, how to play a good title? A lot of people have said that, but there are always people who can't, right? Today I will talk to you again!\nFirst of all, I need to know the mistake of the title:\n\n1. The title completely reflects the theme\n   Many writers will appear this situation, feel that the title is to show the theme of the article, reflect the main content, however, we have an important aspect of the title, it is ignored, that is to attract the eye, if only monotonous show the theme, it will not attract the eye effect.\n   2, lack of reading\n   A readable headline is one that makes the reader want to read the whole article, not one that makes the reader want to read the whole article.\n2. Never make headlines\n   The title is seriously inconsistent with the content of the article. In order to increase the click rate, a grandiose title is created, but the content of the article has no connection with the title. This is cheating readers.\n   Secondly, these are the aspects we should consider when writing the title:\n   1, the title should pay attention to objective facts, not grandiose, to be easy to understand, consider our article audience level, understanding ability, not too obscure, especially rare words to avoid as far as possible.\n   2, a suspense title let us see the title at the beginning of the mind with a question, want to read the article to solve the problem, a suspense title is easier to attract the attention of readers.\n   3, the purpose of the title, directly describe the details of the article, such a title is suitable for teaching articles, let readers know what you want to teach at a glance, want to learn people know is not their own needs to meet the knowledge and skills needs of readers.\n3. Contradictory and controversial titles\n   Use conflicting arguments to engage readers directly in the debate, but articles with such titles need to be good content and worth reading.\n4. Hot event titles\n   Hot events are always the easiest for people to chase after, and the flow can not be underestimated. Actively mastering the dynamics of public opinion and always paying attention to hot news events are beneficial for us to write articles.\n5. The Angle of the title\n   Articles on the same topic can be divided into different sub-categories. For example, when we write about agriculture, rural areas and farmers, we can start to describe them from different aspects. A novel perspective and a distinct attitude will have different contents from others.\n6. Use \"I\", \"you\" and \"TA\"\n   Use the first, second, third person to write the title, with the story to move people, from the beginning directly hit the reader's mind, to achieve the title effect.\n7. The number of title words is also critical\n   A longer title can put down more eye-catching words, of course, also can not be a long title, there is a topic skill is split, the key words of the article listed first, take a look to remove the most critical, the rest of the combination, see the result is not the title you want!", "timestamp": 1635602514, "digest": "XxFtMlTYlM5Fszhb4J6AB4Kip1PAXCopelV-xUShFyU", "contributor": "0x55e0bfAC36aEB685E1Bd25b168F28bCb37381e3b"}
{"id": "PVMXoJuM5_NEg-QmwKrp1ip30ko9UYQ7Le5lnGPl1H8", "title": "1SWIPEAWAY", "body": "**I think it hit me at some point during the Uber ride to her house: this could be the most important hook-up in human history. And the scariest. I know it sounds stupid and indulgent to say that, especially coming from another hetero-normative dude in black Christian Diors like me. (Whatever, they were knock-offs.) But given the extraordinary features of this interaction, along with its consequences for how people think of themselves, I really don’t think it’s an exaggeration. All of this is true by the way. I don’t have the time to make any of this up, and frankly I sucked pretty bad in Language Arts. My grade-school teachers will bug out if they read this.**\n\n**My band was doing a show in Salt Lake City–you know, Mormon utopia in the middle of the desert. Our next gig in Boise had been cancelled for reasons we didn’t entirely understand. When you’re on the road you just kind of run with things, I guess. We decided to hang out in Utah for a couple of days. Somebody said we could “backpack in the watercolor meadows of the Uintahs”. Sounded like a good time. We do retrowave electronica stuff, lots of synthy sounds with flashing lights and voice effects. Everyone’s into the eighties again, even the Mormons it turns out.**\n\n**I still don’t think of myself as a hook-up guy, even after all these years on the road. I’m serious. It’s not something I enjoy or even particularly like. I see hook-ups as one of the rites of being a traveling musician, or maybe even a curse. It’s like how prime ministers have to shake hands with people they don’t necessarily like. I’m a reluctant diplomat of the grunge scene. Everything that guys like David Bowie did make total sense to me. They turned their lives upside-down just to try and find something real. I wonder if they ever found it–when I did, it scared the crap out of me.**\n\n**The first Tinder girl I met in Utah was one of those “it’s for a good cause”-type chicks. I’m not trying to offend anybody, it’s just the only way I can think to describe her. What annoys me about those girls is that they all have the same personality. They’re almost breathless to prove how angry they are about all the *right* things. It makes me feel like everything I know is wrong or something. You just sit there and listen and drown in their syndicated outrage. I swiped right for shallow reasons, yes. The messed-up thing is that I anticipated my annoyance as I glanced at her pics. I was shamelessly undeterred.**\n\n**Her peach spaghetti-strap top swallowed most of my attention, even as she soliloquized about non binary love and dying pandas. (OK, I made that last one up.) Her blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail. It was less a conversation and more a kind of reciting on her part–anyone could’ve been sitting in front of her. I wonder if she would’ve acted differently if she knew who I was. A few hours later, I finished softly somewhere in the bobbing bramble of hair in my lap. It was depressing. She fixed her ponytail in the mirror, checked her phone, then quickly left.**\n\n**I don’t usually let people get to know me too well, not even my bandmates. I mean we drop acid together sometimes, bro-bonding stuff, that kind of thing. That’s about it. Even with girls, I’m a sex-in-the-dark kind of dude. They probably think I’m weird but I never ask. When the peach-top pedant was leaving I gave her one of our albums on cassette tape. It was awkward (“Uh, thanks…?”) but I feel like it’s the best I can do.**\n\n**Somewhere in the discussion of her saintly works, she had mentioned something her uncle had seen in a mall near downtown Salt Lake City. It was like an upright human with amphibian skin or something. Her uncle was a janitor who cleaned floors there late at night. The thing had come out of a basement stairwell, looked at him for a moment, then turned right back around and disappeared. The really crazy thing was that her uncle said he felt some kind of emotion deep in his chest that he never felt before, sort of like how you feel when you lock eyes with a stranger that looks inexplicably familiar. She reported all of this as a joke, rattling it off at blinding speed in her machine-gun dialogue of goodspeak. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, though, even when we started making out.**\n\n**The guys in our band like to joke about the golden thumb–it’s when you start a streak of matching with the city’s hottest women. That’s millennial serendipity at its finest. Isaac had the golden thumb in Topeka and we didn’t see him until Michigan, but in Michigan the algorithms failed him. It works in mysterious ways. When I matched with this Clarissa girl from Provo, I decided Salt Lake City *was* a promised land, or at least my own Topeka. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, nor has that condition of not-knowing changed. But let me back up...**\n\n**Clarissa was one of those one-pic profiles, which is risky. You’re betting that this single picture is so alluring that the opposite swiper needs no further proof of your hotness. In her case, it was a win. She was wearing a black romper striped orange, yellow, green; her hair was blue and cut boyishly short. The obligatory septum piercing made her nose look like a jewelled accessory. Style, attitude, cuteness. Bad-ass but delicate. The interesting part: the picture wasn’t a picture but actually a moving boomerang, one of those images perpetually repeating two seconds of movement.**\n\n**The boomerang showed Clarissa from behind, jogging in-place on a sidewalk with her face looking coyly back into the camera. I don’t need to mention the advantages such an angle affords those of the requisite affinities–but there was something else. Something *else.* There looked to be a kind of independent movement beneath the fabric around her tailbone, like an appendage that was rising and falling as she ran. You could *just* make out the outline. It couldn’t be…**\n\n**I put my phone away and started pumping some beat-mixes to get my mind straight. Things couldn’t be *that* freaky in Utah. My headphones weren’t loud enough to block out the image. The thing that bothered me most was that my attraction to her hadn’t waned; if anything, I felt *more* attracted. Had I been watching too many shapeshifter animes? That was probably the case regardless.**\n\n**Even so, there was no doubt that Clarissa’s festive romper was hiding a full-grown tail–like, none at all.  I watched the boomerang over and over again, turning my phone this way and that. There was no other conclusion. I considered calling my bandmates for brotherly support but in the end opted for privacy. Imagine if they heard I was seeing a girl with a *tail.* Literally a tail dangling down her rear. Her caption read: “Wyoming-raised, Utah-grown. I don’t want to go to Paris or Prague. Take me to a hidden place we can share secrets.” It was just too much.**\n\n**The first time I met Clarissa it was somewhere near State St. It’s hard for me to keep track of the roads because they’re all numbered on a grid based on their proximity to the Mormon temple. Clarissa told me that this system makes it easier to get around and not get lost. She laughed when I disagreed. We ate vegan wraps in one of those generic Salt Lake plazas made of Mexican eateries and Asian stores. Clarissa explained that she ate healthy when it suited her schedule and mood, which made her “a seasonal vegan”. It was summertime in Salt Lake; she wore a dirty-green tank-top and gray denim shorts ripped across the thighs; her hair was bluer than Freddie Mercury’s stage lighting.**\n\n**She was one of those girls who was easy to talk to, but from whom you couldn’t allow your attention to waver. Clarissa was no prolific talker. Instead I got a watchful loner vibe, someone you’d see walking along deserted railroad tracks, someone who considered Bjork their private therapist. I kept imagining how I could bring the topic up without coming across as a total creep. “I didn’t know people in Utah had tails...is that common here?” Gross. Maybe something more personal. “That romper you had on does a lot for your tail.” God, no. I settled on: “Can you show me that running move from your profile?”**\n\n**We were walking along the sidewalks in the glow of the street lamps; night had fallen on the strange city made of numbers. Clarissa’s hand was clasped softly in mine. I kept resisting the temptation to look behind her like an idiot. She was pressing me with questions somewhat absently. When I told her my band’s name was Nineteeneightyfornicate, she lost it and started going through all of our pictures on Instagram. That name was Isaac’s idea, not mine! It did have a nice ring to it.**\n\n**She stopped walking and turned on me suddenly.**\n\n**“You know, don’t you?”**\n\n**“Know–know what?” I stammered lamely.**\n\n**“Oh come off the bullshit, man. You’ve known this whole time.” Staring me frankly in the eyes, she took my hand and ran it along something long, firm, cylindrical on her backside. My heartbeat quickened and a soft moan emitted from my throat. Clarissa giggled and threw my hand away.**\n\n**“Any secrets you’d like to share with me?”**\n\n**I looked at her for a second, processing. “I already told you my dirty band name–”**\n\n**“Right,” she scoffed. “I hope you come up with something better by tomorrow.”**\n\n**She turned and began receding into the jasmine-bordered shadows. I realized that we had been surrounded by cats ever since we started walking. They now trailed her in unison like a row of ducklings down the sidewalk.**\n\n**“I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE A CAT PERSON!” I yelled hopelessly.**\n\n**She laughed and raised a long middle finger into the air without turning around. I sighed and began walking in the other direction back to my hotel. I opened my phone to a new text message from Clarissa. It didn’t say anything; she’d only sent three cat emojis with their tails in the air. I marveled at how little I knew what in the hell was going on. *I just stroked a human tail. That really happened.* And yet, perversely, I couldn’t wait for the next day.**\n\n***....Any secrets you’d like to share with me…***\n\n**I’ll come clean–that night wasn’t the first time I googled “humans with tails”. There had been drunken nights alone that I obsessed over the idea. My thoughts were ransacked by half-humanoids risen from primordial tetrapods, dripping with sea-foam and tails dragging in the sand. I told you I was a weird guy. To this point, the greatest harm all this had done was butcher my online algorithms–I would get ads for kinky Halloween costumes, which routinely raised some eyebrows.**\n\n***She could be a government spy on some troll-job,* I thought to myself. The idea tormented me for several hours. What was worse, I thought, the CIA using search history and store-bought accessories to play with my mind, or the possibility that I had met some kind of hybrid human with a rope of flesh swinging from her backside? The little bit of ganja I had left made my speculations thicker and more confusing. She had to be real. Why would the government waste time mind-fucking a guy from a band named Nineteeneightyfornicate? I went from that to wondering what she ate when she was stoned.**\n\n**Before I knew it, I was stepping out onto the curb in front of her house in my black knock-off Christian Diors. Who was this profane intruder in Provo? An agent *provo*cateur, I grinned to myself. I didn’t know there could be neighborhoods with trees in the desert. Seemed like the Mormons were pretty good landscapers when they weren’t busy granting all their wives eternal life. Who knew! Clarissa lived in a blue house with a quaint little front porch, one of those places that really has the picture-book mailbox with a perfect red lever pointed upwards.**\n\n**“Were you tailing me earlier?”**\n\n**Clarissa’s voice came out of nowhere, disembodied. I looked around me wildly, my unease ratcheting up several notches. A hand rested on my shoulder from behind; I wheeled around.**\n\n**“Chill out, freak,” Clarissa laughed. She looked at the tree next to her, brushing off some twigs. “My nest is up *there*.”**\n\n**“Your–nest?”**\n\n**“It’s a joke, heard of those before?”**\n\n**I suddenly noticed she was wearing a yellow Walkman cassette player. We always BS that if we meet a chick with a portable cassette player, we’ll automatically drop to one knee, no questions asked.**\n\n**“So you’re that much of a dork that you listen to cassette tapes in 2020?!”**\n\n**“And you’re telling me you don’t have one on you right now?”**\n\n**Wordlessly, I raised my band’s cassette tape out of my pocket.**\n\n**“Give me that,” she laughed, snatching it out of my hand. “Maybe we *are* a match!”**\n\n**I followed her inside.**\n\n**“My roommates are out for the weekend”–glancing at the couch–”you can just shove all that shit over, sorry. We have beer, lemonade, soda...or maybe you like the harder stuff?”**\n\n**I settled in and tried to relax, taking in what was around me. Nothing odd really. There was a crystal salt lamp whose warm glow looked afloat in the dim room. I could faintly sniff sage. A white cat met my gaze and darted out of sight, desperate to be forgotten.**\n\n**“You don’t get many visit–”**\n\n**The sentence was robbed from my throat. Clarissa was putting a glass of Jack Daniels on the table, naked beside the burgundy lingerie faintly interrupting her skin. I could see the thing in plain sight–it was moving from side to side in a sort of carefree, feline attitude, *curling* back on itself this way and that, hairless and freckled as it tapered to its tip. It was a magnificent tail, too magnificent to be an accident. I closed my eyes and took a shot of the Jack.**\n\n**“I know what you’re thinking,” Clarissa smiled. She sat down next to me, running her hand along my shoulder. “You’re thinking ‘it’s impossible, this can’t actually be happening.’”**\n\n**“You must be psychic,” I shot back dryly.**\n\n**“You’re thinking,” she pressed on, “that science eliminates the possibility of my existence.”**\n\n**I didn’t say anything.**\n\n**“What’s wrong, rock star, you don’t want to play along? I know that you know it all–how they say a human tail is only an abomination of the coccyx, a *vestige* of the behind that we all left behind...right?”**\n\n**“What are you getting at here, Clarissa?”**\n\n**She took a swig of lemonade and rolled the juice around her mouth, her gaze unbroken.**\n\n**“Nothing you haven’t already thought of ten thousand times, but I’ll humor you. If the only reason humans don’t have tails is because of some kind of disabled gene-signal, then the chances of more than one being on the planet is like one in billions. So if you realized there were *others like you*, that hypothesis would suddenly be on very thin ice.”**\n\n**My blood ran cold. I leaned all the way back on the sofa until my eyes were looking at the ceiling. The clustered nerve-endings were firing off in tingles that made it hard for me to resist the urge to let it squirm beneath me. All of my practiced methods for controlling the thing were failing. It was as if it somehow sensed another of its kind and now had license to awaken. She’d caught me by the tail.**\n\n**Clarissa leaned over me, her face close to mine. “Show it to me,” she whispered.**\n\n**No one had set eyes on it outside of my parents; I hadn’t seen them since they put me up for adoption. I sat up, pulled the back of my shirt up and leaned over. Her eyes felt like hot embers across its naked surface. She lifted it between her fingers, held it in her palm, caressed it. I suddenly noticed how heavily I was breathing.**\n\n**“There are many of us, you know,” she said softly.**\n\n**“How many?”**\n\n**Clarissa paused. “I don’t know, to be honest. But a lot. I met them in the genetic labs outside Salt Lake.”**\n\n**“Wait, genetic–”**\n\n**“Shhh!” She put a finger to my lips and straddled me, pulling my hands through her blue hair. “We’ll talk about it later.”**\n\n**I clutched her swaying tail and let its smoothness run through my fingers.**\n\n**“We’re a match,” she giggled, “a match made in some dirty heaven.”**\n\n**That evening, for the first time in my life, I surrendered fully to whatever it is that I am.

After today, I summarize my reading experience.\n\nMany people complain that they are too busy at the end of the day to find time to develop their hobbies and skills. In fact, when we remove most of the major time, we leave a fragment of time that is of great use. This fragmented time is often ignored and not used well. Fragmented time includes leisure time, time to play, and time to be used, such as waiting for the bus, queuing for receipts, and commuting time. There are also smaller chunks of fragmented time, such as waking up early and going to bed.\n\nSo how do you make the most of fragmentation time? Time management book, summed up this sentence; This means getting things done while everyone else is asleep and doing a few more things while everyone else is asleep.\n\nGetting up early is a good living habit. There are many benefits to getting up early. In the book on effective learning, the human brain is most awake and efficient in the morning. So we can use this time to quietly and efficiently do what we love to do.

{"id": "Hf8HcZCOHxMcH2Tcn5LYYc4zh9buX1A71LaWwx4_DF4", "title": "What is blockchain?", "body": "Blockchain is the underlying technology that powers Bitcoin, the digital currency.\nIn October 2008, A man named Satoshi Nakamoto published A paper titled Bitcoin:A Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System Bitcoin:A Peer-to-peer Electronic Money System. Three months later, on Jan. 4, 2009, Nakamoto created the first block, bitcoin's founding block, on a small server in Helsinki, Finland, and was rewarded with the first 50 bitcoins. At this point, a set of bitcoin's underlying technology was built, and countless people have participated in the process since then. Bitcoin developed steadily for seven years from 2009 to 2015, during which time the industry used the term \"Bitcoin\" (capital B) for the underlying technology of the Bitcoin system, and \"Bitcoin\" (lowercase B) for Bitcoin, the digital currency. For seven years, there was no concept of blockchain, not even the term blockchain.\nBlockchains was first proposed on October 31, 2015. On The same day, The Economist published The cover article Blockchains: The Great Chain of Being Sure about things, blockchain Technology reshaping The World, first proposed Blockchains blockchain concept. According to the Meaning of English Block and Chains translated into Chinese blockchain. The cover article called Bitcoin, the underlying technology of Bitcoin, Blockchains, and proposed that the technology could be used far beyond digital currencies and could be widely used in other fields. Therefore, Bitcoin, the underlying technology that supports Bitcoin, has been known by the world after changing its name to blockchain Blockchains, and has been widely spread and concerned.\nSecond, the value of blockchain itself\nThe greatest value of blockchain is to realize value transfer in a decentralized environment; In the decentralized link, technological innovation is used to solve the problem of mutual trust between individuals in a low-cost way.\n● Deliver value in a decentralized environment\nIn the network world, A has an e-book and transmits it to B. Then A copies an e-book and transmits it to B. Both A and B have the e-book at the same time, which is called information transmission. A has A 200 yuan red envelope, which is passed to B through the network, so A doesn't have this red envelope, and B has this 200 yuan red envelope, which is the value transmission. But now the network of the world to send red envelopes, is relying on similar Alipay, wechat such centralized services to achieve transmission value. If the world does not have Alipay or wechat, in A decentralized environment, how can A transfer the value of his 200 yuan red envelope to B? Blockchain is a good solution to this problem. In a decentralized environment, point-to-point users can transfer value to each other.\n● Use technological innovation to solve the problem of mutual trust between individuals in a low-cost way\nIn complex environments or areas where the cost of mutual trust is high, blockchain can be a good solution to the problem of mutual trust between individuals. A bought A small property right house from the village committee, but the local real estate center cannot handle the property ownership certificate for the small property right house. Worried about future housing disputes, A asked the head of the village committee to issue A house purchase certificate. But A is still worried. What if there is A fire and the purchase certificate is burned? What if the head of the village council sells the house to someone else and issues a certificate of purchase? What if the next village chief disowns the previous one's house purchase certificate? As long as all parties recognize blockchain, these realistic problems can be solved technically by using the immutable characteristics of blockchain.\n3\\. Characteristics and principles of blockchain\nBlockchain comes from the underlying technology of Bitcoin, and its technical features ensure the stability of data storage, accuracy of data records and imtamability of data contents in a decentralized environment. The main features of blockchain are as follows:\nDistributed storage, decentralized, point-to-point transmission: data is stable and indestructible.\nConsensus mechanism (proof of work) : In a decentralized environment, it is clear who will keep the books and who will distribute the resources.\nEncryption mechanism: The encryption mechanism is used to verify the accuracy of data and ensure that system data cannot be tampered with.\nTime stamp: data is divided into different packets and recorded in sequence to solve data conflict.\nTimestamp + consensus mechanism (proof of work) : Solve duplicate records and Byzantine generals. In a decentralized network, data information of all nodes is kept accurate.\nIn order to better understand the operation principle of blockchain, here is an example to explain the operation mechanism of blockchain. Example: Repairing family trees. A family plans to revise its family tree, hoping to update it every year to keep the data accurate and ensure its continuity in good times and bad.\nform\nThe example of genealogy revision mentioned above is to ensure the continuity, stability, accuracy and uninterrupted transmission of genealogy revision in a decentralized environment through a set of rules and procedures. The scheme itself is a set of human blockchain system constructed by using the principle of blockchain.\n4\\. Blockchain related technologies\nBlockchain is not a new technology, just the integration of the underlying technologies that support Bitcoin, the digital currency. Peer-to-peer distributed technology, encryption technology, consensus mechanism, timestamps and other related technologies used by blockchain have been very mature for more than a decade.\nPeer-to-peer distributed (P2P) technology: traditional network data transmission relies on the support of the central server, and point-to-point distributed data transmission is the network participating terminal, without the support of the central server, direct point-to-point data transmission. In a distributed system, data loss on any single terminal has no impact on the system.\nEncryption technology: there are many specific computer encryption technologies, including symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, hash hash algorithm encryption and so on. It doesn't matter what kind of encryption method blockchain uses. You can choose any encryption method or create a new encryption method, as long as it meets the needs of anti-cracking encryption. Common encryption modes include SHA-1, MD5, DES, 3DES, AES, RSA, and ECC.\nConsensus mechanism: a rule agreed upon by all participants in a way that only one participant at a time is responsible for recording new data and distributing it. Bitcoin's consensus mechanism is that everyone calculates the problem together, and the first one who calculates the answer is responsible for recording the new data.\nTimestamp: Specifies that every once in a while, a packet is generated with a new timestamp, and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... Time-stamped packets, in order. Use timestamp order to arrange features and link related records together.\nIt doesn't matter what technologies the blockchain uses, they are neither original to the blockchain nor necessary to it. In fact, it doesn't matter if there is another technology or another technology in the blockchain application, as long as the system can be guaranteed to run under the blockchain principle, it doesn't matter. Blockchain is just a solution and technically not standardized at all. Technical problems, never a problem.\n5\\. Advantages of blockchain\nDecentralization: Due to the use of distributed accounting and storage, there is no centralized hardware or management organization, the rights and obligations of any node are equal, and the data blocks in the system are jointly maintained by nodes with maintenance functions in the whole system.\nOpenness: The system is open. In addition to the encryption of the private information of the parties to the transaction, the data of the blockchain is open to all. Anyone can query the blockchain data and develop related applications through the open interface, so the information of the whole system is highly transparent.\nAutonomy: Blockchain uses consensual norms and protocols (such as a set of open and transparent algorithms) to enable all nodes in the system to freely and securely exchange data in a trustless environment, so that trust in \"people\" is replaced by trust in machines, and any human intervention does not work.\nInformation cannot be tampered with: Once the information has been verified and added to the blockchain, it is permanently stored. Changes to the database on a single node are invalid unless more than 51% of the nodes in the system can be controlled at the same time. Therefore, the data stability and reliability of the blockchain are extremely high.\nAnonymity: Since the exchange between nodes follows a fixed algorithm, the data interaction is trust-free (procedural rules in the blockchain determine for themselves whether the activity is valid or not), so the counterparty can remain anonymous without having to make itself known to the other party.\n6\\. Deficiencies and shortcomings of blockchain\nUnrelentingly high latency: Decentralized blockchains have latency issues in the transmission of information, and they are long and high latency. When information is posted to the blockchain, it needs to be verified and recorded, and nodes across the network need to undergo a slow and lengthy process to synchronize the information. The more nodes the network has, the more serious the network delay becomes. In the case of network instability, a bitcoin message delay of 1 hour, 1 day, many days to update the whole network, which is very normal. In pursuit of the stability and imtamability of data transmission in a decentralized environment, blockchain actually sacrifices the speed requirement of data transmission.\nMassive computing power consumption: Blockchain architecture based on distributed features, in order to verify the consistency of blockchain information. Each node in the system, at each piece of information recorded, will generate computing power (computing cost) consumption. The computation power loss of all nodes, summed up, is a massive computation power consumption, this cost is very high. In addition, in order to ensure that the information on the blockchain system can not be tampered with, it is necessary to ensure that the computing power of any single organization cannot control more than 51% of the nodes on the system, which in turn raises the threshold of computing power of the blockchain system. Is it really worth consuming huge amounts of computing power to ensure the stability and immutability of an insignificant blockchain system? Long-term high computing power consumption cost, who will bear? Considering the massive amount of computing power that bitcoin miners consume, is it really worth the investment?\nStorage space consumption: The information of the blockchain system needs to be stored locally, and each node needs to record the data information locally, which puts forward high requirements on the data storage space of a single node. As the application scope of blockchain expands, the pressure of data storage space on a single node will become greater and greater. The pressure of data storage space consumption on all nodes of the whole system will also become larger and larger. Massive disk space consumption, need to be considered in advance.\nConsumption of network bandwidth resources: in the centralized network environment, information transmission can be completed only by using the central server for one or two transmissions. In a blockchain system, there is no central node to support information transmission, which requires continuous information exchange between multiple points. Theoretically, the consumption of network bandwidth resources is N times of the number of nodes. The more nodes a network has, the more bandwidth resources it consumes.\n7\\. Application of blockchain in aviation\nThe main applications of blockchain in aviation are as follows:\nLufthansa, Deutsche Air and Etihad airways have teamed up with WindingTree to apply blockchain to ticket distribution.\nSingapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways and China Southern Airlines have applied blockchain technology to convert frequent flyer points and miles to connect with third-party merchants.\nBritish Airways applied VChain block chain authentication system in the verification of passenger identity information.\nSITALab has worked with IAG, HAL, Geneva and Miami to develop FlightChain as the only trusted source of flight data.\nBrussels Airport is using blockchain technology to enhance digital management of the air cargo industry.\nGEAviation uses blockchain technology to track the supply chain to monitor and collect data related to the manufacturing and life cycle of key components of aircraft engines.\nZamna, a UK company, is using blockchain technology to dramatically improve security screening by enabling a unified identity service for passenger information between airlines, governments and security agencies.\nThe aviation industry is an industry with high degree of standardization and timeliness, and relies heavily on centralized data operation. It has high real-time requirements in flight query, ticket sales, point acceptance and other fields. Whether there is a premise for blockchain application in the aviation industry, whether there is a need for decentralized value transmission, and whether there is a need for decentralized mutual trust confirmation?\nViii. Summary:\nBlockchain is not a new technology, just an integration of the underlying technologies that underpin the operation of Bitcoin, the digital currency. Bitcoin had been running steadily for seven years before the term blockchain came along, when the technology that underpinned it was called Bitcoin. Blockchains are Bitcoin, the underlying technology that supports Bitcoin.\nThe greatest value of blockchain is to realize value transfer in a decentralized environment; In the decentralized link, technological innovation is used to solve the problem of mutual trust between individuals in a low-cost way.\nBlockchain is a very expensive and luxurious solution, which has its own advantages and values, but also unavoidable shortcomings and shortcomings. A mature blockchain system needs to consume a lot of computing power, disk storage and network bandwidth resources, and there must be a long delay due to decentralized information transmission.\nWhether there are decentralized application scenarios for value transfer in the aviation industry, whether there are decentralized mutual trust verification requirements, and whether there is a need for blockchain, a very expensive technology, needs further discussion.

{"id": "Ps139CoViMI0pM2PLKBddux1RCHYuDIj4EKZ_PYm1ss", "title": "1SWIPEAWAY", "body": "**I think it hit me at some point during the Uber ride to her house: this could be the most important hook-up in human history. And the scariest. I know it sounds stupid and indulgent to say that, especially coming from another hetero-normative dude in black Christian Diors like me. (Whatever, they were knock-offs.) But given the extraordinary features of this interaction, along with its consequences for how people think of themselves, I really don’t think it’s an exaggeration. All of this is true by the way. I don’t have the time to make any of this up, and frankly I sucked pretty bad in Language Arts. My grade-school teachers will bug out if they read this.**\n\n**My band was doing a show in Salt Lake City–you know, Mormon utopia in the middle of the desert. Our next gig in Boise had been cancelled for reasons we didn’t entirely understand. When you’re on the road you just kind of run with things, I guess. We decided to hang out in Utah for a couple of days. Somebody said we could “backpack in the watercolor meadows of the Uintahs”. Sounded like a good time. We do retrowave electronica stuff, lots of synthy sounds with flashing lights and voice effects. Everyone’s into the eighties again, even the Mormons it turns out.**\n\n**I still don’t think of myself as a hook-up guy, even after all these years on the road. I’m serious. It’s not something I enjoy or even particularly like. I see hook-ups as one of the rites of being a traveling musician, or maybe even a curse. It’s like how prime ministers have to shake hands with people they don’t necessarily like. I’m a reluctant diplomat of the grunge scene. Everything that guys like David Bowie did make total sense to me. They turned their lives upside-down just to try and find something real. I wonder if they ever found it–when I did, it scared the crap out of me.**\n\n**The first Tinder girl I met in Utah was one of those “it’s for a good cause”-type chicks. I’m not trying to offend anybody, it’s just the only way I can think to describe her. What annoys me about those girls is that they all have the same personality. They’re almost breathless to prove how angry they are about all the *right* things. It makes me feel like everything I know is wrong or something. You just sit there and listen and drown in their syndicated outrage. I swiped right for shallow reasons, yes. The messed-up thing is that I anticipated my annoyance as I glanced at her pics. I was shamelessly undeterred.**\n\n**Her peach spaghetti-strap top swallowed most of my attention, even as she soliloquized about non binary love and dying pandas. (OK, I made that last one up.) Her blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail. It was less a conversation and more a kind of reciting on her part–anyone could’ve been sitting in front of her. I wonder if she would’ve acted differently if she knew who I was. A few hours later, I finished softly somewhere in the bobbing bramble of hair in my lap. It was depressing. She fixed her ponytail in the mirror, checked her phone, then quickly left.**\n\n**I don’t usually let people get to know me too well, not even my bandmates. I mean we drop acid together sometimes, bro-bonding stuff, that kind of thing. That’s about it. Even with girls, I’m a sex-in-the-dark kind of dude. They probably think I’m weird but I never ask. When the peach-top pedant was leaving I gave her one of our albums on cassette tape. It was awkward (“Uh, thanks…?”) but I feel like it’s the best I can do.**\n\n**Somewhere in the discussion of her saintly works, she had mentioned something her uncle had seen in a mall near downtown Salt Lake City. It was like an upright human with amphibian skin or something. Her uncle was a janitor who cleaned floors there late at night. The thing had come out of a basement stairwell, looked at him for a moment, then turned right back around and disappeared. The really crazy thing was that her uncle said he felt some kind of emotion deep in his chest that he never felt before, sort of like how you feel when you lock eyes with a stranger that looks inexplicably familiar. She reported all of this as a joke, rattling it off at blinding speed in her machine-gun dialogue of goodspeak. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, though, even when we started making out.**\n\n**The guys in our band like to joke about the golden thumb–it’s when you start a streak of matching with the city’s hottest women. That’s millennial serendipity at its finest. Isaac had the golden thumb in Topeka and we didn’t see him until Michigan, but in Michigan the algorithms failed him. It works in mysterious ways. When I matched with this Clarissa girl from Provo, I decided Salt Lake City *was* a promised land, or at least my own Topeka. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, nor has that condition of not-knowing changed. But let me back up...**\n\n**Clarissa was one of those one-pic profiles, which is risky. You’re betting that this single picture is so alluring that the opposite swiper needs no further proof of your hotness. In her case, it was a win. She was wearing a black romper striped orange, yellow, green; her hair was blue and cut boyishly short. The obligatory septum piercing made her nose look like a jewelled accessory. Style, attitude, cuteness. Bad-ass but delicate. The interesting part: the picture wasn’t a picture but actually a moving boomerang, one of those images perpetually repeating two seconds of movement.**\n\n**The boomerang showed Clarissa from behind, jogging in-place on a sidewalk with her face looking coyly back into the camera. I don’t need to mention the advantages such an angle affords those of the requisite affinities–but there was something else. Something *else.* There looked to be a kind of independent movement beneath the fabric around her tailbone, like an appendage that was rising and falling as she ran. You could *just* make out the outline. It couldn’t be…**\n\n**I put my phone away and started pumping some beat-mixes to get my mind straight. Things couldn’t be *that* freaky in Utah. My headphones weren’t loud enough to block out the image. The thing that bothered me most was that my attraction to her hadn’t waned; if anything, I felt *more* attracted. Had I been watching too many shapeshifter animes? That was probably the case regardless.**\n\n**Even so, there was no doubt that Clarissa’s festive romper was hiding a full-grown tail–like, none at all.  I watched the boomerang over and over again, turning my phone this way and that. There was no other conclusion. I considered calling my bandmates for brotherly support but in the end opted for privacy. Imagine if they heard I was seeing a girl with a *tail.* Literally a tail dangling down her rear. Her caption read: “Wyoming-raised, Utah-grown. I don’t want to go to Paris or Prague. Take me to a hidden place we can share secrets.” It was just too much.**\n\n**The first time I met Clarissa it was somewhere near State St. It’s hard for me to keep track of the roads because they’re all numbered on a grid based on their proximity to the Mormon temple. Clarissa told me that this system makes it easier to get around and not get lost. She laughed when I disagreed. We ate vegan wraps in one of those generic Salt Lake plazas made of Mexican eateries and Asian stores. Clarissa explained that she ate healthy when it suited her schedule and mood, which made her “a seasonal vegan”. It was summertime in Salt Lake; she wore a dirty-green tank-top and gray denim shorts ripped across the thighs; her hair was bluer than Freddie Mercury’s stage lighting.**\n\n**She was one of those girls who was easy to talk to, but from whom you couldn’t allow your attention to waver. Clarissa was no prolific talker. Instead I got a watchful loner vibe, someone you’d see walking along deserted railroad tracks, someone who considered Bjork their private therapist. I kept imagining how I could bring the topic up without coming across as a total creep. “I didn’t know people in Utah had tails...is that common here?” Gross. Maybe something more personal. “That romper you had on does a lot for your tail.” God, no. I settled on: “Can you show me that running move from your profile?”**\n\n**We were walking along the sidewalks in the glow of the street lamps; night had fallen on the strange city made of numbers. Clarissa’s hand was clasped softly in mine. I kept resisting the temptation to look behind her like an idiot. She was pressing me with questions somewhat absently. When I told her my band’s name was Nineteeneightyfornicate, she lost it and started going through all of our pictures on Instagram. That name was Isaac’s idea, not mine! It did have a nice ring to it.**\n\n**She stopped walking and turned on me suddenly.**\n\n**“You know, don’t you?”**\n\n**“Know–know what?” I stammered lamely.**\n\n**“Oh come off the bullshit, man. You’ve known this whole time.” Staring me frankly in the eyes, she took my hand and ran it along something long, firm, cylindrical on her backside. My heartbeat quickened and a soft moan emitted from my throat. Clarissa giggled and threw my hand away.**\n\n**“Any secrets you’d like to share with me?”**\n\n**I looked at her for a second, processing. “I already told you my dirty band name–”**\n\n**“Right,” she scoffed. “I hope you come up with something better by tomorrow.”**\n\n**She turned and began receding into the jasmine-bordered shadows. I realized that we had been surrounded by cats ever since we started walking. They now trailed her in unison like a row of ducklings down the sidewalk.**\n\n**“I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE A CAT PERSON!” I yelled hopelessly.**\n\n**She laughed and raised a long middle finger into the air without turning around. I sighed and began walking in the other direction back to my hotel. I opened my phone to a new text message from Clarissa. It didn’t say anything; she’d only sent three cat emojis with their tails in the air. I marveled at how little I knew what in the hell was going on. *I just stroked a human tail. That really happened.* And yet, perversely, I couldn’t wait for the next day.**\n\n***....Any secrets you’d like to share with me…***\n\n**I’ll come clean–that night wasn’t the first time I googled “humans with tails”. There had been drunken nights alone that I obsessed over the idea. My thoughts were ransacked by half-humanoids risen from primordial tetrapods, dripping with sea-foam and tails dragging in the sand. I told you I was a weird guy. To this point, the greatest harm all this had done was butcher my online algorithms–I would get ads for kinky Halloween costumes, which routinely raised some eyebrows.**\n\n***She could be a government spy on some troll-job,* I thought to myself. The idea tormented me for several hours. What was worse, I thought, the CIA using search history and store-bought accessories to play with my mind, or the possibility that I had met some kind of hybrid human with a rope of flesh swinging from her backside? The little bit of ganja I had left made my speculations thicker and more confusing. She had to be real. Why would the government waste time mind-fucking a guy from a band named Nineteeneightyfornicate? I went from that to wondering what she ate when she was stoned.**\n\n**Before I knew it, I was stepping out onto the curb in front of her house in my black knock-off Christian Diors. Who was this profane intruder in Provo? An agent *provo*cateur, I grinned to myself. I didn’t know there could be neighborhoods with trees in the desert. Seemed like the Mormons were pretty good landscapers when they weren’t busy granting all their wives eternal life. Who knew! Clarissa lived in a blue house with a quaint little front porch, one of those places that really has the picture-book mailbox with a perfect red lever pointed upwards.**\n\n**“Were you tailing me earlier?”**\n\n**Clarissa’s voice came out of nowhere, disembodied. I looked around me wildly, my unease ratcheting up several notches. A hand rested on my shoulder from behind; I wheeled around.**\n\n**“Chill out, freak,” Clarissa laughed. She looked at the tree next to her, brushing off some twigs. “My nest is up *there*.”**\n\n**“Your–nest?”**\n\n**“It’s a joke, heard of those before?”**\n\n**I suddenly noticed she was wearing a yellow Walkman cassette player. We always BS that if we meet a chick with a portable cassette player, we’ll automatically drop to one knee, no questions asked.**\n\n**“So you’re that much of a dork that you listen to cassette tapes in 2020?!”**\n\n**“And you’re telling me you don’t have one on you right now?”**\n\n**Wordlessly, I raised my band’s cassette tape out of my pocket.**\n\n**“Give me that,” she laughed, snatching it out of my hand. “Maybe we *are* a match!”**\n\n**I followed her inside.**\n\n**“My roommates are out for the weekend”–glancing at the couch–”you can just shove all that shit over, sorry. We have beer, lemonade, soda...or maybe you like the harder stuff?”**\n\n**I settled in and tried to relax, taking in what was around me. Nothing odd really. There was a crystal salt lamp whose warm glow looked afloat in the dim room. I could faintly sniff sage. A white cat met my gaze and darted out of sight, desperate to be forgotten.**\n\n**“You don’t get many visit–”**\n\n**The sentence was robbed from my throat. Clarissa was putting a glass of Jack Daniels on the table, naked beside the burgundy lingerie faintly interrupting her skin. I could see the thing in plain sight–it was moving from side to side in a sort of carefree, feline attitude, *curling* back on itself this way and that, hairless and freckled as it tapered to its tip. It was a magnificent tail, too magnificent to be an accident. I closed my eyes and took a shot of the Jack.**\n\n**“I know what you’re thinking,” Clarissa smiled. She sat down next to me, running her hand along my shoulder. “You’re thinking ‘it’s impossible, this can’t actually be happening.’”**\n\n**“You must be psychic,” I shot back dryly.**\n\n**“You’re thinking,” she pressed on, “that science eliminates the possibility of my existence.”**\n\n**I didn’t say anything.**\n\n**“What’s wrong, rock star, you don’t want to play along? I know that you know it all–how they say a human tail is only an abomination of the coccyx, a *vestige* of the behind that we all left behind...right?”**\n\n**“What are you getting at here, Clarissa?”**\n\n**She took a swig of lemonade and rolled the juice around her mouth, her gaze unbroken.**\n\n**“Nothing you haven’t already thought of ten thousand times, but I’ll humor you. If the only reason humans don’t have tails is because of some kind of disabled gene-signal, then the chances of more than one being on the planet is like one in billions. So if you realized there were *others like you*, that hypothesis would suddenly be on very thin ice.”**\n\n**My blood ran cold. I leaned all the way back on the sofa until my eyes were looking at the ceiling. The clustered nerve-endings were firing off in tingles that made it hard for me to resist the urge to let it squirm beneath me. All of my practiced methods for controlling the thing were failing. It was as if it somehow sensed another of its kind and now had license to awaken. She’d caught me by the tail.**\n\n**Clarissa leaned over me, her face close to mine. “Show it to me,” she whispered.**\n\n**No one had set eyes on it outside of my parents; I hadn’t seen them since they put me up for adoption. I sat up, pulled the back of my shirt up and leaned over. Her eyes felt like hot embers across its naked surface. She lifted it between her fingers, held it in her palm, caressed it. I suddenly noticed how heavily I was breathing.**\n\n**“There are many of us, you know,” she said softly.**\n\n**“How many?”**\n\n**Clarissa paused. “I don’t know, to be honest. But a lot. I met them in the genetic labs outside Salt Lake.”**\n\n**“Wait, genetic–”**\n\n**“Shhh!” She put a finger to my lips and straddled me, pulling my hands through her blue hair. “We’ll talk about it later.”**\n\n**I clutched her swaying tail and let its smoothness run through my fingers.**\n\n**“We’re a match,” she giggled, “a match made in some dirty heaven.”**\n\n**That evening, for the first time in my life, I surrendered fully to whatever it is that I am. Clarissa hasn’t left my side since; we’re in Cheyenne now. There’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think: I’ve never been happier–or more deeply, inconsolably frightened.**", "timestamp": 1635612051, "digest": "56648re9YKSnaRoHNgg2OrkLba9o04K-E3bNS5Hdiqc", "contributor": "0xBbb538b84ED95aBa94585c6cE7C2f8790dBfE53B"}

Pop art is best described as art that is based on what’s “popular” in culture. In today’s world, whatever is being discussed by the masses on social media. Art funds are interesting to me because they’re the only other way one could invest in art without owning specific pieces. I’ll dig into art funds later in the article, but for now, let’s learn about pop artists!\n\n## The Machine\n\nWhen it came to researching pop artists, I had a litany of people to choose from. I could look into Banksy, Koons, Lichtenstein, and many others, but only one name stood out to me — Warhol.\n\nI chose Andy Warhol for 3 reasons:\n\n1\\) He’s famous for being prolific\\\n2\\) His work spans multiple disciplines (pop art, music, film, and fashion)\\\n3\\) He was innovative and broke boundaries.\n\nIn my research of Andy Warhol, it became evident to me that he would’ve **thrived** in today’s era of entrepreneurship. He was prolific and multi-dimensional — he was a polymath. He dipped his toes into any and every art form he pleased and was rewarded for it with fame, fortune, and legacy. His ability to be multi-medium has no doubt inspired today’s modern-day polymaths — West, Abloh, Pharrell. On top of this, he was obsessed with scaling his artistic ability — he was obsessed with mass production.\n\n> **“The goal of mass production is low‐cost manufacturing. Three enablers contribute to the achievement of this goal: (1) interchangeable parts, (2) the moving assembly line, and (3) dedicated machinery and manufacturing systems.” \\[**[**source**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470618813.ch4)**]**\n\nFor Warhol, he would take these principles and reformat them to fit his production process.\n\n## Warhol’s 3 Enablers:\n\n*   Interchangeable parts: Warhol and his “art-workers”\n*   Assembly line: The Factory\n*   Dedicated machinery: Silkscreens\n\nHis obsession with the mass production of his work is evident in his opening of *The Factory*, his art studio and collective that would become the assembly line to his work. Even his choice of materials, silkscreens, allowed him to replicate the artistic process at a scale he pleased.\n\n*The Factory* was his crowdsourced incubator for creativity, and it allowed him to scale his thoughts and desires. It allowed him to dig down rabbit holes. It freed up his ability to explore whatever he desired, rest assured the execution of his thoughts were in good hands.\n\nKnowing this about Warhol and his approach helps us understand how we should be thinking of MSCHF. I’m by no means suggesting that MSCHF has, is, or will create work as groundbreaking as Warhol. I’m merely pointing out that MSCHF is adopting a similar approach.\n\n## MSCHF’s 3 Enablers:\n\n*   Interchangeable parts: The MSCHF Collective (their team members)\n*   Assembly line: The Internet\n*   Dedicated machinery: MacBooks, iPhones, Notepads, Whiteboards, etc\n\nBy positioning MSCHF as an ‘artist,’ we allow ourselves to think about their exit opportunity in the same light as we would with an artist and their art. Therein lies the opportunity for MSCHF — treat your work as art and monetize accordingly.\n\nSo, how does MSCHF get on Warhol’s level? By employing the modern-day marketing strategy — hype and virality.\n\n## The Present — The Flywheel of Culture\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*LtLw8ZDT5IX3bviS.png)\n\nCredit: [Eater](https://www.eater.com/2020/2/19/21143918/supreme-oreos-collab-resale-ebay)\n\nCulture is an interesting word. Merriam-Webster describes it as, “the characteristic features of everyday existence (such as diversions or a way of life) shared by people in a place or time.” \\[[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture)] In conversations with friends, culture is used as a noun most analogous to the word zeitgeist. We often base thought experiments around prompts such as, “Why is this culturally relevant?” or “Who is driving culture?”\n\nThe mechanisms for becoming culturally relevant are inextricably linked — virality and hype are the two-punch combo every brand trying to sell to Generation Z tries to master. Most end up failing. These two mechanisms provide the kinetic energy necessary for brands to break through the boundaries of culture and set the tone for their success. Few brands can master this. Even fewer can stay relevant over time and stay consistent through the noise. But there’s one brand in particular that has outlasted the trend-riding, fast-dying norm of hype culture to build a name that’s become synonymous with the word hype — Supreme.\n\nWhen you compare the strategies MSCHF and Supreme employ, you begin to recognize a through-line. Let’s explore.\n\nIn a very solid [breakdown](https://medium.com/predict/https-medium-com-strategy-insider-the-supreme-theory-of-hype-branding-af3f9acd7fe) of Supreme’s growth strategy, [Soham Kulkarni](https://medium.com/@sk.sohamkulkarni?source=post_page-----af3f9acd7fe----------------------) assesses the tactics behind the 21st-century hype strategy.\n\n## Hype Branding Theory:\n\n*   The art of limited supply\n*   Unique approach towards customers\n*   Collaborations to increase the brand hype\n\nFor the MSCHF ‘Jesus shoe’ drop, you can tie threads between the execution of the drop and the aforementioned Hype Branding Theory. Only 25 pairs available? Limited supply. You have to text them to get notified of the drop? Unique approach towards customers. Nike shoes and Holy Water from the River Jordan? The “ultimate” collaboration\\*.\n\n*\\*In fact, the drop was meant as a commentary on how absurd collab culture has gotten.*\n\nIn today’s noise, it’s becoming evident that the only way to truly build a great brand is to evoke such a strong association with consumers’ emotion that people are willing to camp out for [days at a time](https://www.manrepeller.com/2018/08/supreme-line-interviews.html) to secure a drop or even pay 5X retail on platforms like StockX just to wear it out one time and afterward list on Grailed.\n\nI’ve been subscribed to MSCHF’s text line for the past 6 weeks now, and I’ve still yet to get early access to their drops. I can’t tell whether or not it’s on purpose or due to poor management. Regardless, it’s working on me, and I imagine others around the country are waiting with bated breath to see what they’re going to do next.\n\n## The future — The Mechanism of Capital\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*YcaxHehrA1QSggTK.jpg)\n\nCredit: [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-25/rally-rd-app-opens-soho-store-for-investors-in-classic-cars)\n\nIn the wealth management industry, art is increasingly becoming a recommendation as an alternative asset. The global art market alone reached $64.1B in 2019. Currently, there are two ways high net worth individuals can invest in art — directly as a collector or indirectly through art funds.\n\nArt funds, in particular, are interesting to explore since they share a similar model to venture capital firms. Instead of investing in a portfolio of startups, however, art firms acquire a portfolio of art. And as with venture capital, the portfolio’s success depends on the successful sale of the underlying assets (the art).\n\nLike a venture capital firm, the art fund operates by taking in capital from limited partners, identifying and investing in arbitrage opportunities, holding onto them while the assets’ value increases, and selling them for more than they were worth at the time of purchase. In the case of art funds, the assets are works of art (literally). They often include paintings, sculptures, photographs, and a variety of other art forms.\n\nThe art fund strategy is a longer-term, buy and hold strategy, not too dissimilar from startups and venture capital. In both cases, it takes time for fund operators to identify, invest, and divest high ROI opportunities.\n\nSo why does this matter? For MSCHF to be successful, I propose this strategy — they must treat themselves as an art fund in which the underlying assets are the art pieces they create.\n\nImagine if Andy Warhol had created a holding company, Andy Warhol Incorporated (AW Inc.), that owned every piece of art he ever created. Now imagine you invested in that company just as he was becoming popular. If you owned, let’s say, 5% of AW Inc., and he sold the company for $1B, you’d make $50M. (Lots of assumptions here but work with me)\n\nThere’s a flaw in that thought experiment. For AW Inc. to hold that valuation, it would require Warhol not to sell any of his pieces and just let the collection appreciate. This wouldn’t work, however, because if no one is buying Warhol pieces, how could we possibly know what his pieces (and overall, his portfolio) are worth?\n\nEnter ✨*technology*✨. In recent years, platforms like Masterworks, Otis, and Rally Rd. have launched to essentially democratize the art investment industry. Before them, one could only invest in art if they were a high net worth individual. These tech platforms allow everyday investors to purchase **shares** of art and collectibles, instead of whole pieces. They source and purchase the art, securitize each piece with the SEC, open investment up to the public, and then they eventually sell the whole piece and distribute the profits accordingly.\n\nBy partnering directly with a platform like this, AW Inc. would be able to sell each of its pieces as Warhol creates them, while still keeping a portion of ownership. As each piece is sold, the shares would be given a tangible price point, in turn, pricing the entire Warhol portfolio. And when AW Inc. wants to sell, the acquirer would be assuming ownership of the AW Inc. portfolio made up by shares of each art piece AW Inc. created.\n\nIf MSCHF were to do this, it would give them and their investors a clear path to exit — they just need to find someone who wants to own a portfolio of art catered to Generation Z hypebeasts. *Maybe The Carlyle Group? *👀\n\nAs MSCHF continues to carve their name into culture, they’ll inevitably grow their portfolio value. They don’t even have to switch up their drop strategy, either. They can continue as planned, and when they drop anything that has a physical component, they can partner with one of the tech platforms to add it to their portfolio.\n\nOne closing note: Something that stood out to me when analyzing artists (and subsequently MSCHF), is that artists are the ultimate [linear commerce](https://2pml.com/2018/02/23/linear-commerce/) play. They are both an audience company as well as a product company, and when they become near-household names, almost everything they do is a product. Almost everything they do is newsworthy. And as artists strive to break through boundaries and pigeonholes, it seems as if MSCHF started multidisciplinary so they won’t have to face the same thing.\n", "timestamp": 1635613322, "digest": "mRqFNwcL_6rTdBA7xF4R4q-9hSp_MFleNdBF_lJxqZU", "contributor": "0x439366006C840DFA6508Bb8075Bd0b3e21f6CEe2"}

By employing the modern-day marketing strategy — hype and virality.\n\n## The Present — The Flywheel of Culture\n\n![Credit: Eater](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*LtLw8ZDT5IX3bviS.png)\n\nCulture is an interesting word. Merriam-Webster describes it as, “the characteristic features of everyday existence (such as diversions or a way of life) shared by people in a place or time.” \\[[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture)\\] In conversations with friends, culture is used as a noun most analogous to the word zeitgeist. We often base thought experiments around prompts such as, “Why is this culturally relevant?” or “Who is driving culture?”\n\nThe mechanisms for becoming culturally relevant are inextricably linked — virality and hype are the two-punch combo every brand trying to sell to Generation Z tries to master. Most end up failing. These two mechanisms provide the kinetic energy necessary for brands to break through the boundaries of culture and set the tone for their success. Few brands can master this. Even fewer can stay relevant over time and stay consistent through the noise. But there’s one brand in particular that has outlasted the trend-riding, fast-dying norm of hype culture to build a name that’s become synonymous with the word hype — Supreme.\n\nWhen you compare the strategies MSCHF and Supreme employ, you begin to recognize a through-line. Let’s explore.\n\nIn a very solid [breakdown](https://medium.com/predict/https-medium-com-strategy-insider-the-supreme-theory-of-hype-branding-af3f9acd7fe) of Supreme’s growth strategy, [Soham Kulkarni](https://medium.com/@sk.sohamkulkarni?source=post_page-----af3f9acd7fe----------------------) assesses the tactics behind the 21st-century hype strategy.\n\n## Hype Branding Theory:\n\n* The art of limited supply\n* Unique approach towards customers\n* Collaborations to increase the brand hype\n\nFor the MSCHF ‘Jesus shoe’ drop, you can tie threads between the execution of the drop and the aforementioned Hype Branding Theory. Only 25 pairs available? Limited supply. You have to text them to get notified of the drop? Unique approach towards customers. Nike shoes and Holy Water from the River Jordan? The “ultimate” collaboration\\*.\n\n*\\*In fact, the drop was meant as a commentary on how absurd collab culture has gotten.*\n\nIn today’s noise, it’s becoming evident that the only way to truly build a great brand is to evoke such a strong association with consumers’ emotion that people are willing to camp out for [days at a time](https://www.manrepeller.com/2018/08/supreme-line-interviews.html) to secure a drop or even pay 5X retail on platforms like StockX just to wear it out one time and afterward list on Grailed.\n\nI’ve been subscribed to MSCHF’s text line for the past 6 weeks now, and I’ve still yet to get early access to their drops. I can’t tell whether or not it’s on purpose or due to poor management. Regardless, it’s working on me, and I imagine others around the country are waiting with bated breath to see what they’re going to do next.\n\n## The future — The Mechanism of Capital\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*YcaxHehrA1QSggTK.jpg)\n\nIn the wealth management industry, art is increasingly becoming a recommendation as an alternative asset. The global art market alone reached $64.1B in 2019. Currently, there are two ways high net worth individuals can invest in art — directly as a collector or indirectly through art funds.\n\nArt funds, in particular, are interesting to explore since they share a similar model to venture capital firms. Instead of investing in a portfolio of startups, however, art firms acquire a portfolio of art. And as with venture capital, the portfolio’s success depends on the successful sale of the underlying assets (the art).\n\nLike a venture capital firm, the art fund operates by taking in capital from limited partners, identifying and investing in arbitrage opportunities, holding onto them while the assets’ value increases, and selling them for more than they were worth at the time of purchase. In the case of art funds, the assets are works of art (literally). They often include paintings, sculptures, photographs, and a variety of other art forms.\n\nThe art fund strategy is a longer-term, buy and hold strategy, not too dissimilar from startups and venture capital. In both cases, it takes time for fund operators to identify, invest, and divest high ROI opportunities.\n\nSo why does this matter? For MSCHF to be successful, I propose this strategy — they must treat themselves as an art fund in which the underlying assets are the art pieces they create.\n\nImagine if Andy Warhol had created a holding company, Andy Warhol Incorporated (AW Inc.), that owned every piece of art he ever created. Now imagine you invested in that company just as he was becoming popular. If you owned, let’s say, 5% of AW Inc., and he sold the company for $1B, you’d make $50M. (Lots of assumptions here but work with me)\n\nThere’s a flaw in that thought experiment. For AW Inc. to hold that valuation, it would require Warhol not to sell any of his pieces and just let the collection appreciate. This wouldn’t work, however, because if no one is buying Warhol pieces, how could we possibly know what his pieces (and overall, his portfolio) are worth?\n\nEnter ✨*technology*✨. In recent years, platforms like Masterworks, Otis, and Rally Rd. have launched to essentially democratize the art investment industry. Before them, one could only invest in art if they were a high net worth individual. These tech platforms allow everyday investors to purchase **shares** of art and collectibles, instead of whole pieces. They source and purchase the art, securitize each piece with the SEC, open investment up to the public, and then they eventually sell the whole piece and distribute the profits accordingly.\n\nBy partnering directly with a platform like this, AW Inc. would be able to sell each of its pieces as Warhol creates them, while still keeping a portion of ownership. As each piece is sold, the shares would be given a tangible price point, in turn, pricing the entire Warhol portfolio. And when AW Inc. wants to sell, the acquirer would be assuming ownership of the AW Inc. portfolio made up by shares of each art piece AW Inc. created.\n\nIf MSCHF were to do this, it would give them and their investors a clear path to exit — they just need to find someone who wants to own a portfolio of art catered to Generation Z hypebeasts. \\*Maybe The Carlyle Group? \\*👀\n\nAs MSCHF continues to carve their name into culture, they’ll inevitably grow their portfolio value. They don’t even have to switch up their drop strategy, either. They can continue as planned, and when they drop anything that has a physical component, they can partner with one of the tech platforms to add it to their portfolio.\n\nOne closing note: Something that stood out to me when analyzing artists (and subsequently MSCHF), is that artists are the ultimate [linear commerce](https://2pml.com/2018/02/23/linear-commerce/) play. They are both an audience company as well as a product company, and when they become near-household names, almost everything they do is a product. Almost everything they do is newsworthy. And as artists strive to break through boundaries and pigeonholes, it seems as if MSCHF started multidisciplinary so they won’t have to face the same thing.", "timestamp": 1635613426, "digest": "mRqFNwcL_6rTdBA7xF4R4q-9hSp_MFleNdBF_lJxqZU", "contributor": "0x439366006C840DFA6508Bb8075Bd0b3e21f6CEe2"}

And while most of the tech in this space epic held onto the 60’s zeitgeist, a particular piece featured is pin-pointedly accurate to our 21st century reality.\n\nAfter setting the scene for the Discovery One spaceship, we're introduced to a futuristic gadget. Sitting on the table while the crew eats breakfast is a flat, portable screen, broadcasting the galaxy’s news from Earth all the way to Jupiter.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ8pQVDyaLo&t=9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ8pQVDyaLo&t=9s)\n\n[Samsung](https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-says-2001-a-space-odyssey-invented-the-tablet-not-apple/) later used this scene to argue against Apple's iPad patent in 2011, stating, “In a clip from that film lasting about one minute, two astronauts are eating and, at the same time, using personal tablet computers.”\n\nThink about that—a one minute clip from a 43 year old movie was used as solid proof that Apple didn't own the idea of tablets.\n\nThese examples from seemingly clairvoyant artists and visionaries are dotted throughout history, and so we ask ourselves: Can this speculation manifest our inventions into reality?\n\nThe birth of the Internet brought its fair share of “prophets” into the information age; among them, the fathers of the [cypherpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) and crypto anarchy movements stand out as particularly eerie in how their original ideas translate to today’s blockchain wave.\n\nAs one example, [Timothy C. May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_C._May) proposed a movement based around privacy and freedom through technology—cryptography to be specific. Sounds a lot like Web3, doesn't it?\n\nAlmost a full 20 years before Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin (and, more importantly, the concept of blockchains), May predicted our current revolution down to a T. Don't believe us? Here's a little excerpt from his [Crypto Anarchist Manifesto](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/cypherpunks/may-crypto-manifesto.html):\n\n> *“The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification.”...”The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration.”...”crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures.”*\n\nFeel the goosebumps yet?\n\nFlash forward six years and [John Perry Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow) wrote up [his own version](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence) of what he thought the Internet would become. Borrowing from some of May’s initial ideas, but with a much more techno-deterministic approach, he describes the Internet as altering the structure of society by allowing individuals to escape government’s tyrannies.\n\nThere’s no denying this vision has, at least partially, come to fruition. The Internet has disrupted traditional forms of power and created more opportunities for collective action and political engagement. But as the Internet has become increasingly adept at escaping government’s tyrannical nature, control has accumulated in the hands of a select number of platforms—the FAANG companies who’re re-consolidating power and fragmenting our civic discourse.\n\nThis is the fundamental tension that will shape web3: the tension between decentralized individual and collective empowerment, and centralized, hierarchical control.\n\nThe irony is, most people don’t actually want power—they just don’t want to be controlled. This begs the question: how do we create infrastructure and implement policies to effectively achieve individual and collective empowerment without hierarchical organizational structures?\n\nIf there’s anything we’ve learned from web2: greed clouds altruistic innovation. And as we think about and start building the next iteration of the Internet, let’s not make the same mistakes.\n\n\"Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!\"  -[Timothy C.

And unfortunately, instances like the insurrection of the Capitol building, the spread of covid-related misinformation, and the rise of hyper partisan political environments have taught us this the hard way. \n\nIn an environment where over 500 hours of video content are uploaded to YouTube every minute, moderation functions as the core commodity that platforms have to offer. These algorithmically-programmed systems of curation maintain profitability by holding our attention on sites (to see ads) and presenting us with content that will change our behavior (to sell ads). Problem is, these algorithms have learned to “nudge” our behaviour for more sinister reasons than just bleeding our wallets dry.\n\nTo make matters worse, we’re completely blind to what’s going on behind the gold-plated doors of Silicon Valley. Under [Section 230 of the Communications and Decency Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230#:\\~:text=Section%20230%20is%20a%20section,respect%20to%20third%2Dparty%20content.), platform companies basically have sole discretion in how they’re able to collect, collate, use, and sell our personal information. \n\nOh, and did I mention that we get no share of the profit. While Zuckerberg basks in  “Meta's” rising stock price, we’re fighting over what’s fact versus fiction. *How can we create a strong public sphere if we can’t even agree on the issues we face?* \n\nTo state the obvious here: this is bad, really bad. Time’s up tech giants. We must move away from the current data climate and work together to foster a more open and democratized distribution of the “new oil”–aka, user data. \n\nSure, opting in and out of advertisements for a cut of the profits is a step in the right direction, as [Brave browser and the BAT (Basic Attention Token)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) have shown, but this solution only covers part of the equation. \n\nImagine having access to your entire data registry, without having to ask the platforms that collect it to “please” share it with you. Gaining awareness into how platform companies use AI models and marketing segmentation to drive profit from our user behavior would do more than just offer transparency. We're talking about flipping the tables from platform ownership to user ownership, giving you the power to rent, sell, stake or withdraw your data from wherever it may be used.\n\nOnly through blockchain can users handle their valuable information through a tokenized package: don't like what Facebook is using your likes for? Withdraw their access; found a new AI research team that you really vibe with. Take part in their growth by helping to train their models. Possibilities are really endless when each and every one of us controls our grain of the sand. This could enable us to shape the future we want, not what our overlords at Silicon Valley decide is best for us.\n\nNot everything is sunshine and butterflies though, there's a ton of hurdles to overcome before this idyllic vision can become a reality, most of them coming from within. Legal measures like [GDPR](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_en), [the Cookie Law ](https://www.cookielaw.org/the-cookie-law/)and the upcoming (hopefully) update to [Section 230 of the Communications and Decency Act ](https://www.eff.org/es/issues/cda230)barely scratch the surface in terms of giving people the agency they deserve. When it comes to how accountable platforms are for the real-world effects of the content we produce, and the value they extract from it, we need to have a voice. \n\nFunnily enough, some steps in the right direction have been made by the same people that got us here in the first place. [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/decentralized-collaborative-ai-on-blockchain/), [Nokia](https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/blockchain-powered-marketplace-for-sharing-data-and-ai-models-launched-6385) and other [leading-edge companies](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2020.497985/full) are currently setting the ground for modular, smart contract-based, and decentralized datasets leveraging all of the advantages of the blockchain to guide AI research and usage into a more equitable industry of the future.\n\nWhether or not they'll stick to that promise is up to us, but the opportunity is there. Decentralization is our chance at having a say in how our data is used, it's up to us to keep that agency and not serve it up again for MANGA (formerly FAANG) to exploit as they see fit.\n\n*Written by [@anay_sim](https://twitter.com/anay_sim) and [@sumin_of_note](https://twitter.com/sumin_of_note)*\n\n### New Pathfinder guides: \n\nEnjoy some fresh new guides this week to bring you even further down the rabbit hole.\n\n* [Setting up/Bridging Funds on Celo](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/SYGPJ-_m7pdhtrI9babxltZJsQCIsdb5vdU8SrDxI0o) by [@bvajresh](https://twitter.com/bvajresh) \n* [How to Stake OHM on Olympus](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/TeL1wa-FZTPiUoOpK8zHnB2FD8JWiG76SgchzIJ7SBc) by [@zach_davidson](https://twitter.com/zach__davidson)\n\n### Pathfinder updates:\n\n***Editorial Update:***\n\nZach Davidson published an instant classic on the blossoming RabbitHoleDAO and [why decentralization matters](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/CYsaX0fT-IOV5OO3JiDcXpLFdcnhocVOO5pTZ52hsLE).

It is also in aide of The DAOists in their mission of educating and converting the world into “DAOism.”\n\n[https://discord.gg/dEJFDKHvCp](https://discord.gg/dEJFDKHvCp)\n\nDAOhaus is playing a playing a game.

If you are the owner of the POAP you are then able to enter the “War Games.” This game is a DAO and is about as open ended as possible. The direction of the game is decided by making proposals in the DAO, and holding votes. Basically, doing the thing that DAOs do. It truly is a wonderful way to teach about DAO’s and how to use a moloch DAO. So I’m stealing their idea.\n\n## German Art and Slaying Demons\n\n![Slaying Moloch requires Co-Ordination](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dry6Az1t194mgdoARFgE.png?height=719&width=721)\n\nIn [Scott Alexander’s](https://slatestarcodex.com/author/admin/) essay [Meditaions on Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) we learn of a powerful demon Moloch that represents a system humankind hates but lack the tools to co-ordinate and make the changes everyone knows needs to be made.\n\n> There’s [a passage](http://principiadiscordia.com/book/45.php) in the *Principia Discordia* where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. “Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.”\n>\n> The Goddess answers: “What is the matter with that, if it’s what you want to do?”\n>\n> Malaclypse: “But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!”\n>\n> Goddess: “Oh. Well, then stop.”\n>\n> The implicit question is – if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: “Moloch”.\n\nThe Moloch DAO framework seems to have been built around the ideas introduced in Alexander’s analysis of Ginsberg’s poem [Howl](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl). Aiming to create a set of tools humans can use, to address the issues of co-ordination failure and truly take the world into a new direction and slaying the moloch.\n\nDAOhaus brings a whole new level to the story of co-ordination. What they have done, is take the Moloch code and created a user interface in which anybody with a little knowledge of how to navigate [Web3](https://web3.foundation/), can create and/or be a part of a DAO.\n\n> [DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/) was [born at ETHBerlin 2019](https://medium.com/odyssy/daohaus-bauhaus-b855cd9db19e), a hackathon project aiming to make it easier (or possible at all) to interact with the [Moloch DAO smart contracts](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch/blob/master/v1_contracts/README.md) in a human-readable way. After a days-long, Club Mate induced frenzy, the very first build of DAOhaus was born! Thus beginning the almost two year journey focused on bringing more open tools for financial coordination to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n[https://medium.com/daohaus-club/haus-launch-bd781bbbf13a](https://medium.com/daohaus-club/haus-launch-bd781bbbf13a)\n\nThe story that I’ve heard, (I was looking everywhere for where I’ve heard, so I may well be taking some artistic liberty here) is something about the original hack group in Berlin rocking out to a band called Bauhaus during EthBerlin 2019. Which, if true, is a very serendipitous event.\n\nIf we look a little deeper, into the history of the German bauhaus art scene, we learn it is built around a philosophy of creating functional art using multidisciplinary skillsets collaborating in new and innovative ways. This began in actual buildings in which the interiors were fitted with all the tools students required to work and collaborate together. In a digital Web3 format, DAOhaus is doing the same thing. Providing a haus of tools for people to collaborate and slay moloch.\n\n> The Bauhaus was founded in 1919 in the city of Weimar by German architect Walter Gropius (1883–1969). Its core objective was a radical concept: to reimagine the material world to reflect the unity of all the arts. Gropius explained this vision for a union of art and design in the Proclamation of the Bauhaus (1919), which described a utopian craft guild combining architecture, sculpture, and painting into a single creative expression. Gropius developed a craft-based curriculum that would turn out artisans and designers capable of creating useful and beautiful objects appropriate to this new system of living.\n\n[https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm)\n\nThe idea is, I am going to create a new DAO. As you may have already guessed, it will be called Boiler DAO. In this case, I put the cart before the horse. I made the token, named after my social media alias, then decided instead of it just taking up space, I might as well use it. The token is not swappable for anything on any exchange. It is a “pure” social token. It may not always be that way.\n\nThe goal of this DAO will be to tell a story. In both the literal sense and the figurative sense. I will begin this DAO and start some of the basic fundamentals. From there, I will let it grow or fade on it’s own.  Creativity in decentralized story telling, at the same time learning about DAO’s, provides a new tool to aide startups who would like to spend their time focusing on the product or service they intend to offer, instead of teaching fundementals of DAOs.\n\n## How the Story Will be Told\n\nHonestly, I don’t know. If I did, then I wouldn’t be honest in my intentions to have a decentralized project. I will start it. I will create videos. These videos will aide anybody who wants to view them in their own journey of creating or participating in a DAO. This will be a large part of the educational aspect of this DAO.\n\nI will do the basics and then the DAO will decide everything else through proposals, this article being the first part of the process. Obviously I’m not going to make a video of myself typing an article but the rest of it I will. I will create the DAO on xDai. I will then create a [safe minion](https://daohaus.club/docs/users/minion/), which will create a [gnosis safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/), controlled by the DAO. I will deposit 9 Million BOILD tokens into the DAO and from that point forward those tokens will be controlled by the DAO.\n\nI will then create a Discord server and a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjlcjNvqwUxRIma1_d05uYA) channel. Again, this will be as bare bones as possible but it is an opportunity to teach how to do this, as it is a pretty vital part of the *process for this DAO.* I say this because there are many ways to form a DAO and I don’t want anybody to come out of this thinking, ok, If I do every step I see here, I will have a DAO. This may very well be true, but you may not have the DAO you want. The point of this exercise, is to show a particular set of tools that I happened to learn about. All I want you to recognize is that they are tools, and you can use many different tools in different combinations to form your own DAO. If you click the link I provided above to The DAOists tools airtable you will get a good overview of some of the other tools available to you.\n\nThere certainly are other forms of social media at our disposal I could set up as well but it will be up to the DAO to decide how that goes. The one thing I will do, beyond the basics, is set up the collab.land bot on the discord. This will allow for distribution of the remaining tokens to people interested in the DAO. I will distribute 1000 tokens, through the bot to anybody that requests them, up until the point that the DAO decides to change that. Being the creator of the discord, I will be the mod there, until there are a few members of the DAO, then the DAO will decide. 500,000 tokens will be deposited into the collab.land bot for distribution purposes.\n\nThe remaining tokens I reserve to keep, as the creator of the token. It will be mostly used during the making of the tutorial videos but maybe one day I will use them to buy a lambo.\n\n![Who Knows?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RQlRj7T29gFxs02IdeBZl.gif?height=187&width=198)\n\nThe price for entry into the DAO will be: one share per one $BOILD token. The token will also be used as the currency to perform actions within the DAO (so if you do propose membership, keep that in mind you will still need some to make proposals, sponsor proposals etc.). After everything is set up, with the basics, I will then make the first proposal for the beginning of the literal story and gamification of The Boiler DAO.\n\n## Gamification of Boiler DAO\n\nThe idea will be a fictional tale with distributed authorship and each part of the story told after being democratically decided upon by the DAO. A proposal can be a sentence, paragraph, chapter, word, haiku, an edit, a photo…. who knows. Perhaps to entries for the next part of the story are so good it creates a fork in the story, which may even cause a fork in the DAO itself, which would also be super interesting. The point being, the DAO will decide and grow (or fail) as it’s own organism set loose upon the Web3 space.\n\nMy original thought was that, after everything was set up, I would make a proposal for the first line or paragraph and *we* would take it from there. As I was working on this document and doing a few other tasks I was listening in on a Discord call for the Moloch DAO discord server.\n\n[https://discord.gg/5HeK8Dwfth](https://discord.gg/5HeK8Dwfth)\n\nFor the most part I was just enjoying the talk, I believe I could listen to [Travis Wyche](https://medium.com/@traviswyche) talk for hours. Eventually I could no longer concentrate on what I was doing and had to focus on the conversation until it actually lead to a point where I could jump in. It was interesting because the *first* act of collaboration for this “autonomous” organization still required some human to human collaboration. (He also suggested xdai as opposed to the “[broken](https://cryptobriefing.com/polygon-swerves-850-million-hack-ethereum-bridge/)” [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) as another successful virtual yet personal collaboration).\n\nThe point of Travis’ constructive questioning of decentralized story telling was the very valid concern that character development and plot is essentially the result of an authors imagination which leads to a narrative being told and there may be a fundamental problem in the story which could lead to a directionless jumble of words. That could also be interesting, but perhaps unreadable.\n\nSo now I have changed my mind about how to start this. Instead of starting the story, I will just leave a blank page. Perhaps the DAO will decide to spend time on character and plot development first and then “elect” writers to move the story forward. I really don’t know and I don’t want to know either. This \"game” could turn into a publishing powerhouse with multiple ongoing narratives, or it might produce a haiku and dissolve. Time will tell and democracy will decide.\n\nThere are many tools available to us in the Web3 space. This game/story/educational DAO will attempt to use as many tools as it can in order to be successful. It is meant as a seed and will grow if tended to. Hopefully it will take advantage of as many web3 tools as we can. We will start with youtube and hopefully transition that to a Web3 service WHEN one become available. We can use this DAO to experiment with new ideas and new tools, find out what works what doesn’t and offer suggestions to create things that don’t even exist yet.\n\n## Fictionalized Micro Economy\n\nAs this story unfolds, there will be opportunities within the DAO to earn tokens. Again, this will be up to the DAO how this is handled but there are many tasks that will need to be completed in order to make this successful. For example, there may not be a way for the DAO, after a proposal has passed for the next paragraph, to automate the text adding the text to the publishing service. A member of the DAO may be hired to perform that task and be rewarded by tips or even through a constant trickle of tokens, controlled by the DAO (yes this is possible). The direction is to be decided as we weave our way through [The Rise of The Micro-Economies](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/gWY6Kfebs9wHdfoZZswfiLTBVzfKiyFaIwNf2q8JpgI)\n\nThe DAO may even decide that there is a particular NFT on Rarible that would be an excellent part of the story. There are many different ways for the DAO to go about acquiring one and the fun part will be for the DAO to figure out which tools it will need to carry out the tasks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI think I have explained enough as far as the creation of this DAO goes. It is nearly impossible to start a DAO without the original creator or creators influence. I intend to minimize that as much as possible for the launch and then let it be an exercise in creative use of existing and future Web3 technologies. Let’s do it as an exercise in democracy in a micro-economy with no borders. Let’s use it as a foundational educational tool for an emerging technology that is more and more becoming the daily life of humans.\n\nLet’s make a cool story.\n\n![When we're done you'll be buff](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SVMy6xuWDsvttRsHZCVxa.JPG?height=1200&width=1190)\n\n[https://youtu.be/TNQ0fK-kqow](https://youtu.be/TNQ0fK-kqow)\n\nI would have liked to have done a split here with some of the people mentioned in this article.

After everything is set up, with the basics, I will then make the first proposal for the beginning of the literal story and gamification of The Boiler DAO.\n\n## Gamification of Boiler DAO\n\nThe idea will be a fictional tale with distributed authorship and each part of the story told after being democratically decided upon by the DAO. A proposal can be a sentence, paragraph, chapter, word, haiku, an edit, a photo…. who knows. Perhaps to entries for the next part of the story are so good it creates a fork in the story, which may even cause a fork in the DAO itself, which would also be super interesting. The point being, the DAO will decide and grow (or fail) as it’s own organism set loose upon the Web3 space.\n\nMy original thought was that, after everything was set up, I would make a proposal for the first line or paragraph and *we* would take it from there. As I was working on this document and doing a few other tasks I was listening in on a Discord call for the Moloch DAO discord server.\n\n[https://discord.gg/5HeK8Dwfth](https://discord.gg/5HeK8Dwfth)\n\nFor the most part I was just enjoying the talk, I believe I could listen to [Travis Wyche](https://medium.com/@traviswyche) talk for hours. Eventually I could no longer concentrate on what I was doing and had to focus on the conversation until it actually lead to a point where I could jump in. It was interesting because the *first* act of collaboration for this “autonomous” organization still required some human to human collaboration. (He also suggested xdai as opposed to the “[broken](https://cryptobriefing.com/polygon-swerves-850-million-hack-ethereum-bridge/)” [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) as another successful virtual yet personal collaboration).\n\nThe point of Travis’ constructive questioning of decentralized story telling was the very valid concern that character development and plot is essentially the result of an authors imagination which leads to a narrative being told and there may be a fundamental problem in the story which could lead to a directionless jumble of words. That could also be interesting, but perhaps unreadable.\n\nSo now I have changed my mind about how to start this. Instead of starting the story, I will just leave a blank page. Perhaps the DAO will decide to spend time on character and plot development first and then “elect” writers to move the story forward. I really don’t know and I don’t want to know either. This \"game” could turn into a publishing powerhouse with multiple ongoing narratives, or it might produce a haiku and dissolve. Time will tell and democracy will decide.\n\nThere are many tools available to us in the Web3 space. This game/story/educational DAO will attempt to use as many tools as it can in order to be successful. It is meant as a seed and will grow if tended to. Hopefully it will take advantage of as many web3 tools as we can. We will start with youtube and hopefully transition that to a Web3 service WHEN one become available. We can use this DAO to experiment with new ideas and new tools, find out what works what doesn’t and offer suggestions to create things that don’t even exist yet.\n\n## Fictionalized Micro Economy\n\nAs this story unfolds, there will be opportunities within the DAO to earn tokens. Again, this will be up to the DAO how this is handled but there are many tasks that will need to be completed in order to make this successful. For example, there may not be a way for the DAO, after a proposal has passed for the next paragraph, to automate the text adding the text to the publishing service. A member of the DAO may be hired to perform that task and be rewarded by tips or even through a constant trickle of tokens, controlled by the DAO (yes this is possible). The direction is to be decided as we weave our way through [The Rise of The Micro-Economies](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/gWY6Kfebs9wHdfoZZswfiLTBVzfKiyFaIwNf2q8JpgI)\n\nThe DAO may even decide that there is a particular NFT on Rarible that would be an excellent part of the story. There are many different ways for the DAO to go about acquiring one and the fun part will be for the DAO to figure out which tools it will need to carry out the tasks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI think I have explained enough as far as the creation of this DAO goes. It is nearly impossible to start a DAO without the original creator or creators influence. I intend to minimize that as much as possible for the launch and then let it be an exercise in creative use of existing and future Web3 technologies. Let’s do it as an exercise in democracy in a micro-economy with no borders. Let’s use it as a foundational educational tool for an emerging technology that is more and more becoming the daily life of humans.\n\nLet’s make a cool story.\n\n![When we're done you'll be buff](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SVMy6xuWDsvttRsHZCVxa.JPG?height=1200&width=1190)\n\n[https://youtu.be/TNQ0fK-kqow](https://youtu.be/TNQ0fK-kqow)\n\nI would have liked to have done a split here with some of the people mentioned in this article.

I remember how when I told my friends I built a website (which was just a black background site with some basic animation, links to jokes and a sound clip with the Mission Impossible theme playing in the background), the main question they asked me was “Why?! What purpose did my website have?” To be honest, I didn’t have an answer. Building a website was just something cool I was interested in, and it didn’t really have any utility or real-world function. I see web3 at the moment in nearly the exact same phase right now. There are a lot of cool technologies coming up, but most of them are being used by early adopters that find the technology cool, while the function in a lot of cases is not very compelling. If you’re one of those people that think it’s silly that someone would pay more than a million dollars for a picture of a rock, I urge you to look at the actual innovation happening in the technology itself, to see that we’re at a stage where the utility of these innovations is just on the verge of becoming a lot more practical. \n\n## Exciting things coming up in web3\n\nHere are just a few of the upcoming trends that are making me excited about the direction the web is heading.\n\n### Decentralization Centralization\n\n The first area is around the centralization of your identity. You’ll no longer have to ever enter a password on a website or app ever again. You can be authenticated via your public key (which currently could be stored on a wallet extension like MetaMask that will match it against your private key on the blockchain).\n\n### Governance and Access Tokens\n\nBy being a token holder (of whatever coin a community you join is using) you’ll be able to get access to either collectively vote on issues that are happening in a DAO (more on what that is below), and be given special access depending on how many tokens you hold.\n\n### NFT’s beyond art NFT \n\nNon-fungible tokens (or just tokens that each have a unique id and media attached to them) have exploded in popularity recently on marketplaces like OpenSea. The main use case at the moment is selling art on the Ethereum blockchain. However, that is just the beginning. Some other use cases of NFT’s could be:\n\n1. Access or Ownership (if they possess an NFT they can join a community or group)\n2. Proof they performed an action (ex. POAP - Proof of Attendance Protocol, which could say they actually attended an event)\n3. Credentials, such as a certification or verification (that they completed a course or training)\n\n### DAO’s\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations. These are probably what I am most excited about on web3. The idea behind them is that they are organizations (similar to traditional co-ops), in which\n\n1. Ownership is shared with the community (everyone can own tokens or shares in the community)\n2. Rewards are shared with the community (could be in the form of their own token)\n3. Decisions are made collectively in the form of proposals that members can vote on (usually in the form of governance tokens). For now, I’ve heard people call them “Discord communities with a bank account”, but as the space starts to mature, I can imagine them being the co-ops of the 21st century (imagine what a digital version of the Mondragon Corporation would look like).\n\n   ### What about you?\n\n   Are you as excited about web3 as I am?

我们是否处于加密超级周期？\n\n加密与纳斯达克市值（在不同时间段）的并排比较表明我们处于超级周期。\n\n![图一](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D5a0vx-lfno8sZgQ_NMhJ.jpeg?height=1002&width=1029)\n\n这两个市场都遵循了超级周期中常见的类似发展阶段。\n\n**第 1 阶段：**意识和初步采用（缓慢上升趋势） \n 新技术的颠覆性潜力开始吸引市场的想象力，估值在随后的热潮中迅速膨胀。对于加密货币而言，这是 2017 年的牛市，而对于纳斯达克，则是 2000 年的互联网泡沫。\n\n**第 2 阶段：**泡沫破裂（快速抛售） \n 牛市剧烈结束，资产价格暴跌至炒作前的水平。对于纳斯达克而言，这是互联网泡沫破灭的爆发，而对于加密货币而言，则是 2018 年的崩盘。\n\n**第 3 阶段：**整合（横向交易） \n 熊市或整合期延长，导致许多人在持续发展的情况下忽视资产类别或细分市场。\n\n第 4 阶段：狂热（价格快速上涨） \n 技术的大量采用会迅速暴露估值差距。市场追逐这一缺口，导致价格上涨超过先前高点 5 倍以上的狂热。\n\n在这两个市场上演的这些超级周期阶段之间的主要区别在于时间的长短；纳斯达克超过 40 年，而迄今为止的加密货币则在 6 年内。\n\n加速阶段可能是指数增长的货币供应量以及前所未有的交易工具和数字资产带来的杠杆作用的结果。如果是这样，我们应该为加密货币的市场繁荣/萧条周期做好准备，以便在未来变得更短、更快。\n\n## 下一个超级周期——去中心化金融和 NFT（不可替代的代币）\n\nDefi 和 NFT 市场似乎才刚刚开始他们自己的初始意识/采用阶段，许多人仍然不知道生态系统中的机会。随着 BTC 成熟为投资资产（即使现在有了 tradfi ETF），Defi 和 NFT 才刚刚开始。\n\n## 定义\n\n去中心化金融 (Defi) 目前在 500 多个独立平台上拥有 2000 亿美元的总价值锁定 (TVL)。大约一半的 TVL 流入 Lending & Decentralized 交换协议，总价值为 1000 亿美元的 TVL（图 2）。\n\n去中心化交易所是加密货币独有的，是非托管的点对点交易所，使用自动做市商而不是订单簿。\n\n![图2](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2BicTFbo0NiwIB__27JbK.jpeg?height=691&width=1101)\n\n去中心化交易所（Dexes）和借贷协议目前是 Defi 的主要吸引力，但更具创新性和越来越实用的协议为生态系统的发展做出了重大贡献。这些新的创新协议包括保险、支付计划、衍生品交易和其他服务，许多团队每天都会推出新协议。\n\n越来越多的创新项目直接导致更多的 TVL 被整体吸引到 Defi 生态系统中。\n\n我们预计 Defi 将成为未来加密领域的主要增长支柱。就连高盛也插手了[此事](https://blockworks.co/goldman-sachs-defi-has-its-advantages-over-traditional-finance/)！\n\n## NFT\n\n在 Defi 和 NFT 之间，NFT 是两者中的陌生人，因为它融合了艺术和技术。NFT 是唯一的单一发行代币，可证明一段数字媒体是独一无二的且无法复制。想想属于任何数字文件或媒体的唯一序列号（链码），以保证其作为收藏或独特作品的一部分的真实性。\n\n例如，蒙娜丽莎或任何其他无价的艺术品。蒙娜丽莎可以被任何有能力的艺术家复制，但它永远不会是原版。这与数字艺术作品相同，它可以轻松复制，但作为 NFT，可以通过检查区块链轻松证明它是非原创的。这使它从艺术中脱颖而出，在这种艺术中，感兴趣的一方可能必须不遗余力地向专家鉴定一件需要花费大量时间的作品。在加密中，您可以在几秒钟内简单地检查区块链。\n\n然而，与简单的一块画布或大理石块不同，NFT 可以通过功能进行编程。它可以用作各种功能的密钥或访问/权限代码。例如，Bored Apes Yacht Club NFT 也是Bored Apes 独家活动的会员卡。\n\nNFT 的其他效用示例是为年轻的 defi 平台 Gfarmv2 提供给早期流动性提供者的“钥匙”。这些密钥现在不再发行，但对现有持有人来说，他们现在允许在平台上赌注时提高利率。这使得二级市场可以围绕生态系统发展，在该生态系统中，不仅可以交易代币，还可以交易从产量农民（抵押者）到其他产量农民的 NFT 密钥。\n\n毫无疑问，随着 NFT 生态系统的不断发展，越来越多的创新用例将发展起来，就像随着 Defi 领域的增长所看到的创新。\n\n## NFT 是否存在泡沫？价格会崩盘吗？\n\nNFT 的疯狂价格变动引起了很多兴奋和炒作。以下部分是我们对 NFT 估值的看法。\n\n要问的第一个合乎逻辑的问题是 NFT 是否会造成稀缺性。\n\nNansen 市场领先的 NFT 追踪器显示，目前在 Opensea 上，有 1288 个独立的 ETH 集合，其中 700 个是在过去一个月中创建的，仅在过去一周就有 200 个！这甚至不包括 Solana 等其他链上的 NFT。\n\n在每个集合中，流通的 NFT 数量可以从通常的几千个到高达 200 万（Cryptokitties）甚至 700 万（Gods Unchained Cards）不等！供应完全取决于项目的原始建筑师的判断力，制造稀缺是许多 NFT 项目的众所周知的特征。\n\n过去 3 个月 NFT 数量的指数增长确实表明，在加密中创建无限的“可投资资产”并立即开始交易的速度是没有限制的。\n\n在过去，任何收藏品，例如棒球交易卡，在进入非常不透明的二级市场之前，都会有一个完整的生产/分销周期。对于现在的任何 NFT，主要拍卖铸币厂之后会在几秒钟内进行二级交易——所有这些，包括每笔交易和实时订单在区块链上都是完全透明的。\n\n虽然大部分藏品毫无价值，但所有 Opensea ETH NFT 的总市值为 580 万 ETH – 198 亿美元。其中仅前 30 个收藏品就占 460 万个 ETH——价值 157 亿美元。\n\n这些cryptoArt NFT 之所以可以无限增加，是因为它非常简单——基本算法通过随机化几个基本属性的组合来产生任意数量的外观特征。\n\nCryptopunks 是 NFT 的先行者，类似于 BTC，或许可以保证现在平均为它们支付 123 ETH（420,000 美元）——事实上，迄今为止，它的价值比任何其他收藏品都要好。BoredApe 系列也引人注目，获得了更大艺术界的认可，107 件在苏富比以 2,440 万美元的价格售出。当然还有成功的区块链游戏 Axie Infinity 的效用。（图 3：10 月 5 日市值排名前十的 Opensea ETH 收藏 – [Nansen.ai](http://nansen.ai/)）\n\n许多分析师试图通过统计数据来确定创作的最终价值，例如发布日期或艺术家，但所有这些都没有显示出什么相关性，并强化了这一切可能只是随机的看法。不可否认，人气和社区是藏品价格上涨的驱动因素，而这一切都归结为文化和地位的吸引力。许多曾经匿名的收藏家公开亮相以展示他们的在线收藏。\n\n![图 3](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P-xc9vr6STIDEMmBi8A1B.jpeg?height=714&width=1038)\n\n社区在藏品价格增长中扮演着重要角色。无聊的猿类 NFT 收藏品在其持有者中引发了一种囚徒困境，因为许多无聊的猿类串通一气竞标彼此的 NFT，以提高底价，这是基于另一个收藏家实际上不会出售的好主意。这样做是为了提高 Opensea 上显示的底价，并且非常有利于他们。\n\n强大的社区联系和协作在项目的 hodler 社区内培养了一种热情。这些持有者开始通过他们在 twitter 等网站上的 NFT 头像来代表自己，这激起了那些仍然在他们的微型 NFT 社区之外的人的兴趣。\n\n随着热情的增加，许多人发现自己想要购买该项目以成为更伟大事物的一部分。再加上对现有用户的强烈拒绝出售，可能会使价格底线上升。一个很好的例子是 solana 链上的 Solana 猴子业务及其 MonkeDao。\n\n毕竟这是 meme-flex-game 一代——虚拟世界最终往往比现实世界本身更真实。NFTs 以及几乎所有艺术的价值都取决于人们愿意为它付出的代价——按照这个逻辑，任何艺术都没有逻辑上限。\n\n然而，当前的 NFT 艺术趋势和 Play-to-earn (P2E) 趋势与郁金香狂热现象非常相似。与所有此类泡沫一样，这个故事最终将呈指数分布，只有少数几个项目或收藏品幸存下来，就像 2018 年 ICO 崩盘时 99% 的 ICO 消失一样。\n\n然而，并非一切都是厄运和悲观，NFT 领域的泡沫破灭将清除垃圾项目，并使日常消费者变得明智，类似于 2018 年的 ICO 流行如何加强生态系统。\n\nCryptoArt 和 P2E 的狂热阶段将与范式转变相吻合，人们的日常生活将与元宇宙更加交织在一起。这将大大有利于这两个市场。\n\n对于整个 NFT 而言，当它发现自己嵌入到每个人的日常生活中时，它就会出现在从资产所有权证明到数字服务认证的各种现实世界用途中的狂热阶段。\n\n8 月底，一项围绕 Doge meme NFT 的新实验让人们得以一窥当前 NFT 趋势为世界提供的巨大长期潜力和广泛影响，而不仅仅是令人眼花缭乱的估值。\n\nPleasrDAO 以 1696 ETH（550 万美元）的价格购买了原始的 Doge NFT 模因图片，并立即将其分成近 170 亿股 NFT 股票，支持相同数量的称为 $DOG 的 ERC-20 代币——每个拥有 $DOG 代币的人都将拥有一小部分原始 NFT。在某种程度上，一种“资产支持”证券。\n\n$DOG 市值，或暗示仅原始 meme NFT 的市值在推出后几天内就价值超过 2.25 亿美元！撇开令人难以置信的估值不谈，在资产证券化领域，这一成功实验有很多用例。历史上任何时候都无法想象这样的事情——即时证券化和分配。\n\n最终，该领域的细微差别并没有为价格是否会崩盘的问题提供一个简单的答案。我们个人的赌注是 P2E 中的 NFT，我们正在积极播种有希望的即将到来的游戏和公会。\n\n## 加密估值\n\n关于 NFT 估值的问题可以广泛应用于一般的加密资产。如何准确确定硬币和代币的公允价值？\n\n在与实体经济相关的传统市场中，我们可以使用与实体经济本身相关的各种指标来衡量人为夸大的资产价格。\n\n例如，在股票方面，比较标准普尔 500 指数相对于美国 GDP 和 M2 的估值，我们可以看到被高估的 QE2、3 和最新的 Covid 推动的 QE4（有史以来）如何使股票相对于实体经济的价值（图 4）。\n\n基于这一点可以说，QE1 之后的每一轮 QE 都产生了令人难以置信的递减效应，但这完全是另一回事。\n\n![图 4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A7KLGa2qn38TX6sJ1H2wj.jpeg?height=691&width=1101)\n\n相比之下，除了使用渗透率和资金流动之外，没有什么能真正锚定加密资产。这既是牛市的福音（上行没有上限），也是熊市的灾难（资产价格下限很快变得不存在）。\n\n加密定价和估值与实体经济几乎没有联系。公允价值没有参考点。任何数字都可以以某种方式证明是合理的。我们都是盲目的飞行吗？\n\n## 那我们应该如何交易呢？\n\n在没有估值锚的情况下，只要能保持敏捷，加密货币可能会提供目前所有资产类别中最多的 alpha 机会。\n\n但是为了长期驾驭这样的市场，我们倾向于采用一些通用框架。\n\n最终，我们预计随着在加密领域开发更广泛的效用，加密资产的价格将出现更大的差异。\n\n直到今天，BTC 一直是加密领域的整体宏观潮流引领者。即使是现在，许多代币仍与 BTC 的价格走势具有极高的相关性，使其成为事实上的市场领导者。BTC 指向的地方，还有许多其他人跟随。\n\n然而，截至今年，随着市场开始转向主题，我们开始看到整体相关性急剧下降，这是许多像我们这样的长期加密货币本地人一直希望的（图 5）。\n\n即使 BTC 下跌或横盘整理，许多代币也开始表现良好，这表明市场如何开始成熟并与盲目追随 BTC 趋势脱钩。\n\n![图 5](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4L-eiAX4KEiZbkZlqTUc4.jpeg?height=733&width=1034)\n\n**我们的长期框架：**\n\n**1.**全球 M2（货币供应量）必须增加才能看到宏观资产价格普遍升值（牛市周期）。自 2017 年以来，BTC 整合的唯一两个时期是全球 M2 停滞的时期（图 6 - 红框和 Covid（红线）中的 M2 停滞）。\n\n尽管每天都有嘈杂的头条新闻，但最终推动总体趋势的只是 M2 扩张/收缩。\n\n![图6](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Ua2UnEkXoEHuOxuzofRi.jpeg?height=577&width=1128)\n\n**2.**自 2017 年以来，BTC 与标准普尔 500 指数的比较显示了它们如何以不同的节奏敲击相同的鼓点（图 7）。\n\n![图 7](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AHZqGEMCVUdFgUS61Hs9W.jpeg?height=836&width=1034)\n\n具有较高贝塔系数和敏感性的 BTC 在之前的两个场合都比标准普尔指数高 9 个月（黄线 BTC 顶部与红线标准普尔 500 指数顶部），但两者总是同时触底（绿线）。全球流动性注入。\n\n这种不同的宏观资产表现反映了 M2 的 Beta 扩张/收缩，其中更高的 Beta 资产对全球流动性状况更为敏感。\n\n全球流动性注入/提取的速度、幅度和提前/滞后时间都取决于此。不同贝塔系数的原因各不相同——与资产流动性、风险状况和资产的超级周期阶段有关。\n\n**3.**最终是需求和供应驱动资产价格，就像经济中的其他一切一样。\n\n虽然不断扩大的 M2 可以提供持续的需求，但要在长期内产生正的实际回报，它需要与固定（最大）供应相结合，或者与法定货币相比更好的是通货紧缩供应。这给了我们投资的圣杯——稀缺性。\n\n**一种。**比特币的减半机制被广泛理解为降低其供应通胀，直到最终固定下来。考虑到丢失的硬币和休眠的钱包，由于许多硬币无法获得并因此流失到一般市场，因此固定供应量可以被视为有效的温和通货紧缩。\n\n**湾** 随着 8 月 EIP-1559 的实施和明年某个时候进入 ETH 2.0，ETH 的主要代币学变化意味着，由于其新实施的销毁机制，ETH 很快将面临彻底的通货紧缩供应。\n\n假设平均 Gas 价格为 50 Gwei 以及预计在第一季度末 ETH 2.0 的实施日期，ETH 的供应量将在 ETH 2.0 发布日期达到约 1.194 亿个 ETH 的峰值，之后总供应量将开始收缩（图 8）。\n\n这与旧的工作量证明结构中以前的无限供应形成鲜明对比，后者在供应动态方面与法币相当。当然，ETH 2.0 实施日期将是可能彻底改变这一时间表的事件。\n\n图 8\n\n**C。**也是为什么尽管最近高调大张旗鼓，但目前供应无限的 Doge 不太可能成为良好的长期价值存储 (SOV)。\n\nVitalik 加入担任顾问确实带来了希望，也许改变总督代币经济学已提上日程。或者，也许总督军的意图是创建一种伪法定数字货币，可以不断扩大供应量，但它不是作为 SOV，而是被开发为一种被广泛接受的交换媒介。\n\n相反，由于其设计，比特币不太可能以目前的形式成为一种广泛的交换媒介，尽管南美社会主义者可能希望如此。然而，如果 Doge 的交易速度能够加快到 SOL 或 ALGO 等新代币的速度，那么在足够强大的团体的足够支持下，Doge 可能会在未来实现这一目标。\n\n总体而言，我们在结构上做多 BTC、ETH 和大多数第 1 层，例如 ALGO 和 SOL。我们的短期交易侧重于这些代币的期权和远期曲线的低效率。随着加密交易变得越来越制度化，衍生品是我们看到可扩展的阿尔法的地方，这很类似于几十年前的股票、债券和外汇市场。\n\n## 接下来是什么？加密作为解决菲亚特第 1 层问题的第 2 层解决方案\n\n在加密去中心化生态系统中，第 1 层的定义是指基础区块链层——如比特币、以太坊、Polkadot、Solana、Algorand 等。 另一方面，第 2 层是指建立在该底层之上的网络和协议1 区块链，极大地提高了可扩展性和效率。\n\n层的概念可以简单地分解为第1层是服务基础，第2层是建立在底层1层之上的免费服务。 在其他行业，可以说互联网是第1层（协议层）和第2层谷歌是一种建立在互联网之上的服务，可以帮助用户更轻松地浏览互联网。\n\n在我们生活的宏观经济世界中，加密第 1 层/第 2 层结构存在相似之处。我们经济中当前基于法定货币的货币体系代表了基本的第 1 层，未来的加密货币将成为第一个在法定第 1 层之上构建和扩展的第 2 层资产类别。\n\n意思是说加密所依赖的基础是传统的货币系统，而加密作为第 2 层将有助于使日常人员更容易导航。这是因为加密消除了传统金融中的许多中间人。萨尔瓦多使比特币成为法定货币的原因之一是因为它有助于消除像西联汇款这样的中间人，从而消除了日常萨尔瓦多人的额外成本。\n\n我们将当前基于法定货币的货币汇率制度视为第 1 层，因为全球经济中的每一种商品、服务和资产都只是其上的衍生品。第 1 层扩张 (M2) 的数量会影响一切的价格——尤其是所有资产价格。\n\n**由于以下原因，加密将作为第 2 层发挥作用：**\n\n**1.**通过经过验证的代币通胀乘数，其自身大规模创造价值的能力。\n\n**2.**加密的使用最终将扩展到实体经济的所有部门——每个人都可以访问加密生态系统。毫无疑问，Covid 一直是巩固这一不可逆转转变的催化剂。\n\n最终，我们认为实体经济中的一切最终都会转变并建立在这个第 2 层上。\n\n第 1 层是基于法币的基础层。大多数创新随后发展到第 2 层——去中心化/加密生态系统。\n\n加密有很多价值主张——不仅仅是作为主流的替代价值存储 (SOV)，或者作为一种公认的交换媒介；但与金融的大规模民主化或艺术、文化、体育和日常功能相关的应用。\n\n幸运的是，我们仍处于加密发展成为经济第 2 层的第一局的早期阶段，现在可以说只是让 BTC 成为主流 SOV。\n\n如果我们将加密发展到经济层 2 的愿景成真，那么毫无疑问，整体加密市值将进一步呈指数级增长。\n\n未来全球 M2 总量中有多少实际上会流经第 2 层？我们仍在争论这个问题。但是对于Layer 2 中的资产，供应量固定或减少，资产的价格上涨将是不可避免的。\n\n我们经常被问到是否认为投资或进入加密货币为时已晚。价格上涨太多了吗？船早已经启航了吗？\n\n**随着加密生态系统继续发展为基于法定货币系统之上的应用程序和交互层，我们认为我们才刚刚开始。** \n\n原文：QCP

That’s it.\n\nUnder the hood, however, there are thousands of messages being sent every day containing everything from links to incredible content, useful resources, new projects being launched, courses to be taken, events to attend and so much much more.\n\nHowever, while Discord is a fantastic place to hang out and chat, it isn’t great for recalling the information you may have missed or seen the popular/most engaging conversations of that day.\n\nSo, that’s why we’ll be building out a Shiny front-end! While we plan to build this openly inside Discord we can say that there will be a custom Graph & Information Directory with the tooling needed to grab and index information shared in Discord and discovered online in real-time.\n\nTo accompany this, there will be a searchable member directory (pseudonymity allowed obviously) to help members connect and collaborate with others more easily. Some parts of the front end will be accessible to all while the majority of it will only be accessible to members.\n\nAll member-only content will be token gated and NFT gated with some information available to holders of specific NFTs!\n\n## Launch the $SHINY Token\n\nAs a community, we are proud to be part of the second cohort to go through the [Seed Club](https://seedclub.xyz/) accelerator to launch the $SHINY token.\n\nWe’re firm believers that communities and cooperatives with aligned incentives and governance structures will be the key to unlocking the true potential Web3 offers.\n\nAs of today, [$SHINY](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc150bac3cd3678acb2c093e433bed40a6ef08542) token holders are able to vote on key decisions via Snapshot and access unique spaces and channels within the Discord. Soon the token will be the key (alongside Shiny Magpie NFTs) to unlocking the community as a whole.\n\nVery shortly members will be able to get $SHINY for participating, attending events, completing bounties, or building epic shit within the community.\n\nWe have A LOT more planned for the future as well!\n\n## Launch the Shiny DAO\n\nOne core ethos at the front of every decision made so far is that SOSC will be a community-owned project.\n\nTransitioning to being a DAO is something we are already in the process of and will look to solidify this over the coming months.\n\nWe believe that DAOs have incredible potential to raise & deploy capital, build products and services and create value for the world faster than most traditional businesses and we want to be part of that.\n\nThroughout Season 1 we’ll put the remaining infrastructure and compliance in place to transition SOSC to being a DAO under the guidance of Awisemaninotion.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dj-iuzFpZHb94A0EpXu1V.png?height=2048&width=2732)\n\n## Content\n\nThe internet lights up with new Shiny Objects each and every day but as mentioned above if you aren’t on Discord when something is being discussed then chances are you may miss it completely.\n\nSo, it’s time to start producing some content around the huge amount of chatter going on.\n\nLast week we launched the Shiny Podcast, a private feed available for members only as a way to catch up with what's been going on over the previous week. Members are also able to attend the recording live.\n\nTo accompany the podcast, the weekly Shiny Newsletter Digest will be resumed, packed full of links and notes from the week before.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mmlQXWowcONkW8IR24BfJ.png?height=2048&width=2732)\n\n## Switch Memberships\n\nUp to this point access has always been gated and the entirety of the Club has only been available to members with memberships only being open sporadically.\n\nIn Season 1 we’ll be moving membership to always-on meaning you’ll be able to apply and join the Discord in a limited capacity at any time. There will also be ways to contribute even if you’re not a full member.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5K5XcAp0M5yoydtUqr3aO.png?height=2048&width=2732)\n\nAdditionally, we’ll be building some new infrastructure to further support fiat and crypto on-ramps.\n\nThat’s it!\n\nIf you’re interested in joining us then please apply [here](https://tally.so/r/nP1P0m). \n\nOnce you have been accepted you will need to acquire 200 SHINY on Uniswap and then once inside Discord, type !join to claim your role.\n\nSee you on the other side.", "timestamp": 1635632666, "digest": "pJVikHhCgwiAOw0RT2v9osToBzRWj12obcaSroXeG54", "contributor": "0x54681ac94D4e3C8F58F54B576B654DC2D1950ae0"}

Each piece is a reflection of her children's true essence and represents an emotion we have shared with our parents and grandparents. Together in unity here and now, we celebrate the “Fabric of Life” and your existence in the first dimension, by looking into the mirror of the second dimension we are reminded how to be evolution, patient, and kind. In the third dimension, we are introduced to the concept of time by remembering the past, present, and future and with our emotions and in this fourth dimension, the “Fabric of Life” DAO has the purpose of creating digital art in the metaverse and a mission of creating a different kind of buzz...\n\nWe intend on co-creating a message of love, balanced emotions, and a “Fabric of Life” fairy tale with NFT’s for ”Little People” everywhere to enjoy for the rest of time. After the collection of 111 “Fabric of Life” NFT’s have been released we also intend on using the collection for a book and card game launch.\n\n## The Artist\n\nThe RonX111 collection is slowly being released on two platforms Rarible and OpenSea. RonX111 is an authentic street artist with all prints and holding the stencils, as well as the actual original artworks. RonX111 was born in Australia and is a street activist, he has a primary focus on bringing balance to all and ensuring the things he loves from family to nature are preserved. He has the ability to make immediate and concrete moves if he believes his higher level is at risk.\n\nRonX111 uses nature and the leading street artists in the world to deliver very timely and deep messages for all, even if it takes time to understand the message being delivered. He sees nature in ways many do not like it’s the thing that brings light to his dark nights and the Sun is what reactivates Ron back into the reality that we all live in. His messages can be very kind and very hard it depends on the temperature of the moment. RonX111 is focused on mother nature, protecting and fighting for the greater universe that will be left in place, not fighting for today he fights for years ahead and every action has a consequence.\n\n[Mirror](https://ronx111.com)\n\n## The Animator\n\nDestrola who is in partnership with RonX111 is the animation artist. Together they take the original art to animation for the NFT market, while they still focus on their unique crafts globally. Consider the life of a Destrola as a curious child, one in which every day was another opportunity to understand and evolve the world around them. Now imagine that child always blending into the background; never defining who they are and usually playing second fiddle to friends and family.\n\nAt a certain point, there is a switch and drive to move out of the shadows. In this successful venture, they redefine themselves and realize that they have a knack for understanding perceptions and can use their skills to influence that. Moving forward Destrola forges a career in animation and design; spending time with clients to understand the questions that need to be asked and creating solutions that answer them. At the age of 23 Destrola starts pivoting into the realm of education and became a lecturer and tutor at a university; reevaluating the base understandings and helping students begin to question their own perspective of the world through their designs and creations.\n\n[Mirror](https://www.destrola.com)\n\n## RISE: Humboldt Grace Fire Recovery Project\n\nRemembering the Wildfires that devastated their homeland of Australia in 2020, sitting idly by was not an option.
