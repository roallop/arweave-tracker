While the content and framing has evolved over the past 6 months, the core vision has remained the same: to craft a crypto-native artifact that captures the humanity of the people building the future of Ethereum.\n\nIt contains the hopes, fears, and anticipations of the Eth2 researchers and client implementers directly responsible for bringing the Beacon Chain to life on December 1, 2020. The future of the Beacon Chain is the future of Ethereum, and we‚Äôre proud to tell part of its story this far.\n\nWe prompted contributors with a few questions - you'll find them in order in each response, some but not all answered.\n\n- Name / handle\n- Affiliated orgs\n- Primary role\n- Eth2 rough start date\n- General summary of experiences\n- Code or documentation they are particularly proud of\n- Most memorable or painful-to-discover Eth2 bug\n- Person you've come to admire or want to give a shoutout to\n\nKeep in mind that these responses were gathered both before and after the Beacon Chain launch, so references to launch expectations will vary. Profiles are ordered alphabetically by first name.\n\nFinally, while we made the utmost effort to include as many people as possible, it‚Äôs inevitable that we missed or were unable to feature some contributors. Eth2 wouldn‚Äôt be what it is without the input of hundreds of community testers and code contributors - thank you.\n\n---\n\n### Ethereum = Eth1 + Eth2\n\n- Ben Edgington\n- Originally [published on eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/wnie2_210328), 28th March, 2021\n\nLet's start with a quick history of what's become known as Eth2, and where it's headed in the future.\n\nRecently, Danny Ryan has announced his [intent to deprecate](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/) the use of the terms eth1 and eth2. As the creator and curator of ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New in Eth2,‚Äù this is a bit of a blow!\n\nBut, on the whole, I agree that these terms are beginning to outlive their usefulness, and are in danger of becoming quite misleading. It‚Äôs not really about fiddling with names; it‚Äôs about capturing fundamental changes in direction, and communicating them clearly. Changes in the roadmap are confusing for the community. Clarity in naming aids clarity of understanding.\n\nHere's a brief history of naming things in Ethereum‚Äôs roadmap.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the first use of the name ‚ÄúEthereum 2‚Äù was by Vitalik in Hacker News, way back in [April 2014](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7554923). He positioned Ethereum 2 as being a future step-change in the capability of Ethereum through the use of ‚Äúfundamental cryptographic upgrades.‚Äù\n\nEthereum 2 then drops out of view, and the main narrative becomes the familiar Frontier ‚Üí Homestead ‚Üí Metropolis ‚Üí Serenity progression, first described in [March 2015](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). In this scheme, Serenity is the network upgrade to Proof of Stake; Serenity isn‚Äôt Ethereum 2 per se. Interestingly, sharding/scaling doesn‚Äôt have a clear place in that roadmap, although it was certainly discussed [around that time](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/05/blockchain-scalability-chain-fibers-redux/).\n\nProgress largely followed this plan for some years, with Homestead going live in March 2016, and Metropolis (in name at least) in a pair of upgrades in October 2017 and February 2019.\n\nSerenity was to have been delivered via a process of upgrading the existing Ethereum chain to bootstrap Proof of Stake. That upgrade was specified in [EIP-1011](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1011.md) and there was even a [testnet](https://hackmd.io/@aTTDQ4GiRVyyce6trnsfpg/Hk6UiFU7z?type=view) that went live on December 31st, 2017.\n\nHowever, the road to Serenity was found to be a dead-end, not least because of the vast amount of Ether that stakers would require - 1500 was the number back then.\n\nSo, in mid 2018, we tore up that roadmap and started afresh with Ethereum 2.0. Rather, we reverted to Vitalik‚Äôs original idea from 2014 of an Ethereum 2 that was to be a significant cryptographic step-change to the protocol. Calling this Eth 2.0 made sense: we were planning to change pretty much everything about the platform. Ethereum 1 would eventually be brought in as a kind of legacy system. This Ethereum 2.0 roadmap came with neat consecutive phases: Phase 0 for Proof of Stake; Phase 1 for data shards; Phase 2 for executable shards; and, finally, bring Eth1 over to Eth2 after all that.\n\nWe‚Äôve now delivered Phase 0, but the rest of the plan has evolved. As per the latest Eth2 pages [on the ethereum.org website](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/), ‚ÄúEth2 [now] refers to a *set of interconnected upgrades* that will make Ethereum more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable‚Äù (emphasis mine). This looks much more like the old Serenity plan! We‚Äôre upgrading the Ethereum chain in-place rather than doing the old rip-and-replace.\n\nSo, you see, the roadmap narrative has vacillated over the years between effectively doing a replacement of Ethereum 1, referred to at various times as Eth2, and doing in-place upgrades to Eth1. Today, we‚Äôre more or less back in upgrade territory.\n\nIn view of all this, applying the Ethereum 2.0 moniker to the entire project is now seen as confusing: to some it implies a different chain to today‚Äôs Ethereum; to others, even [a different coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/md75k2/will_be_eth_20_a_new_coin_or_will_be_the_same_eth/). It suggests incompatibilities and problems ahead.\n\nThe [latest naming trend](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/), then, is to limit Eth2 to refer only to the consensus layer upgrade of Ethereum to Proof of Stake, and to refer to all of today‚Äôs Ethereum (fka Eth1) as the execution layer.\n\nIt's good to see everything moving under a consistent terminology and a shared roadmap. I'm looking forward to a productive rest of 2021 and beyond!\n\n[Continuations [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=26)\n\n### Aditya Asgaonkar\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2019 \n\nEth2 promises to deliver a decentralized, scalable, and secure blockchain platform on which stateful applications can live. These three qualities will be the driving force towards the mass adoption of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn the quest to satisfy the design requirements, we've also seen some amazing research and engineering progress. We have pushed the frontier of computer science in areas such as Byzantine consensus, signature aggregation, and VDFs. With the launch of Phase 0, we created the largest BFT consensus network in existence, which is an awesome feat in itself!\n\nMy favorite bit of work was the [\"Weak Subjectivity Guide\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/weak-subjectivity.md) - a document that outlines the weak subjectivity safety features of the Eth2.0 network. The goal is to prevent long range attacks that appear specifically in PoS consensus.\n\nAs for favorite bug, there was a consensus (fork-choice) issue discovered right before the Beacon Chain launch. The first priority was to assess the threat level of the attack -- it was critical and could have lead to a large-scale failure, but was extremely difficult to execute. Fixing this attack vector required a comprehensive review of the fork-choice component, and we had already identified a couple of solutions. At the end, there was agreement among the spec team that the attack didn't pose a critical threat because of its difficult execution, and we decided to publish a fix after further review was completed.\n\n### Adrian Manning\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Co-Lead Developer\n- Aug 2018 \n\nThe project has always been ambitious. The early designs were well thought out, but had shortcomings which became apparent when realising them through implementation. The collaboration between researchers and developers constantly iterated on these design specs for years, finally achieving a workable version of the original concept. The process was longer than expected, but it's been amazing to see the coordination and what has been achieved by a globally distributed group of implementers and researchers.\n\nOf all the work put into the Lighthouse client, I've changed and modified various architectures and designs and I'll likely continue to do so. I'm therefore not particularly fond of any individual piece relative to another. But I'm very proud of the end result. The resulting Lighthouse code-base that came together from everyone's hard work is what I'm most proud of.\n\nAs for person to give a shoutout to, I'm sure everyone has a similar answer, but for me it's Danny and Proto. Danny for the amazing organisational role and interfacing with all the client teams (especially on contentious topics) has sped up the development immensely. Proto (Diederick) for his relentless troubleshooting, bug-finding and research endeavours. He has been invaluable in interop testing, optimisation improvements and all round improving the general state of all clients and the eth2 ecosystem in general.\n\nAlso - there's an Australian saying, which I think applies to all eth2 researchers and developers: We're not here to f$!k spiders!\n\n### Adrian Sutton\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nEth2 is this big idea that started as a seed right back when Ethereum began and then went on this crazy, messy, long journey as the details were thrashed out through open research and public collaboration. All that messiness and the length of the journey is a result of this unique, highly collaborative and distributed approach to designing it. Multiple times, concepts that had been thought settled were thrown out because a better idea came along. While that has been frustrating for on-lookers, it has led to and continues to lead to huge improvements in the resulting technology.\n\nThe interop lock-in in Canada was a major turning point in the progress of Phase 0. It forced the Beacon Chain out of that research mode. Suddenly, client development was less about translating the Python spec to another language and more about engineering all the other components that make a client actually usable. Client teams finally had a stable platform to work from and make clients interoperable. There was an explosion of tools to aid developers in debugging and testing across clients. The Beacon Chain had stopped being a research project and started being an engineering one. The road to Mainnet started to become clear.\n\nNow with the deposit contract launched and deposits flowing into it, the pressure to deliver the rest of Eth2 really amps up. Community pressure to unlock those funds again will become overwhelming and despite all the warnings that it won't be quick, people will be disappointed at how long it takes. But those locked funds will also be the equivalent of the interop lock-in, forcing work out of the research phase and into production. All that time spent researching led people to wonder if Eth2 will ever ship, but with the beacon chain launch and all that money locked in, Eth2 has almost unstoppable momentum.\n\nThe future of Ethereum is very bright.\n\nI'm quite proud of my blog post explaining the weak subjectivity period: [\"Exploring Ethereum 2: Weak Subjectivity Period.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2019/11/27/exploring-ethereum-2-weak-subjectivity-period/) It was just me trying to get my head around a concept everyone seemed to be very hand-wavy about and put off solving to the future, yet it's become one of the standard reference points to explain the concept.\n\nI'm proud to have worked with Meredith Baxter and Cem Ozer. They have both been doing all the heavy lifting for Teku, almost entirely behind the scenes. They aren't flashy Twitter personalities, they just put their heads down and do the work.\n\nA few anecdotes to conclude: \n\n1. Family commitments mean I don't travel much, so when the first 7-client interop happened and a photo was posted of people crowded around the computer watching it, everyone in the photo was quickly identified but no one had any clue who I was. For a little while I was just \"that random guy in all the eth2 photos\".\n2. Before Ethereum, Ben Edgington only ever wore button-up, collared shirts. He's now exclusively dressed in Ethereum related T-shirts and has even picked up a penchant for Ethereum hoodies.\n\n[Caravans [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=27)\n\n### Afri Schoedon\n\n- Byzantine Fault / ESP Grantee¬† \n- Testnet Engineer\n- June 2018 \n\nI was working at Parity Technologies in 2018 which managed to implement EIP 1011, the \"Hybrid Casper FFG\" in the Parity Ethereum client. It was a hybrid proof-of-stake approach to the consensus engine and literally my first memory of seeing anything Eth2 related actually being implemented and run. There was Casper testnet up and running with Harmony, Pythereum, and Parity. It was exciting to see the idea of \"Serenity\" starting to materialize. \n\nHowever, it was the same year (only a few weeks later) that the Berlin Eth2 workshop decided to completely discard the hybrid Casper ideas in favor of the beacon chain. Admittedly, it was a massive undertaking. After all the ideation and the first implementations and testnets, we basically started from scratch. \n\nPrysmatic Labs first caught my attention when they launched their first public beacon chain testnets at the end of 2019. I was wondering why we had seven Eth2 clients but none of them was able to synchronize to the other clients' testnets. I was hooked and reached out to the Ethereum Foundation and the Goerli Initiative about contributing to multi-client testnets. And that's what I did in 2020, testnet after testnet up to the mainnet launch.\n\nWhen we launched the Goerli testnet in January 2019, it was not only an important milestone for Eth1 but it was also the perfect chance for Eth2 client teams to use this for their Eth1 integration leading up to the beacon chain genesis. Prysmatic Labs seized this moment and deployed all their Eth2 testnets to date to the Goerli testnet. Coindesk wrote a feature story with the headline [\"A New Test Network Just Activated and Ethereum 2.0 Will Be Using It.\"](https://www.coindesk.com/testnet-gorli-ethereum-serenity)\n\nAll my work on Eth2 concluded with the Eth2 mainnet launch in December 2020. The eight multi-client testnets are well documented on Github and received quite some [media attention](https://github.com/goerli/medalla).\n\nAs for bugs or missing features, that would be the lack of [BLS signature verifications](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/2081) in the deposit contract.\n\nShoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang!\n\n### Alex Stokes\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2018 \n\nWhat a ride it has been! The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020 represents the culmination of years of research and development across countless contributors from every corner of the globe, reaching as far back as the Ethereum genesis block.\n\nIt has been exhilarating to watch this effort go from a collection of wild ideas (e.g. informal talks on Casper from Devcon 3) to today‚Äôs production-scale mainnet. Having been involved before the ‚Äúcasper + sharding‚Äù merge and the formation of the eth2 umbrella, I have seen time and again how a dedicated group of individuals adapts and responds to changes both inside and outside the community. It is this resilience that I find most exciting, and that gives me confidence in a very bright future for Ethereum.\n\nWe are ready to weather whatever challenges may come our way and I cannot wait as we deploy a scalable Ethereum in 2021 and beyond.\n\nI'll highlight [some of the early Casper work](https://github.com/ethereum/casper/pull/143) that got me involved directly with eth2 in mid-2018. Part of the original proof-of-stake design involved a validator registry contract hosted on the eth1 chain. As part of the deposit process, validators provided an arbitrary smart contract for signature verification. While an interesting application of account abstraction, this smart contract needed to be deterministic so that signatures could be independently verified on-chain. In order to ensure the smart contract had the desired properties, it was processed by another smart contract, the \"purity checker\" (in the sense of a pure computation), during the initial registration.\n\nAn early version of the purity checker was written in a now deprecated smart contract language called Serpent LLL. I created a Gitcoin bounty to port the Serpent LLL to a language stack used in the ethereum/casper project, Vyper LLL.\n\nMost painful bug would definitely have to be debugging cross-client interactions during the eth2 interop event in 2019. Fun times, good people and challenging bugs!\n\nShoutout to protolambda!\n\n### Alex Vlasov\n\n- TX/RX¬† \n- Applied Researcher\n- July 2019 \n\nMy predominant impression is that Eth2 poses problems, which are perhaps the most challenging from a software engineering point of view, at the moment. This is exciting from a researcher's perspective, but sometimes frustrating from a software engineer's one. We must adapt, in order to survive in the endeavor.\n\nOne aspect is that we, as software engineers, are used to optimizing for the common case, largely overlooking rare ones. But the latter ones are exactly what an attacker will thoroughly scrutinize! The habit is difficult to break, especially considering that it demands huge amounts of time to analyze and optimize the worst case behavior.\n\nI'm confident that we have to use Formal Methods, as testing is not able to explore the search space exhaustively (except for rare cases, when the space is relatively small).\n\nAnother important aspect is that modern DeFi is demanding on resources. And that is not only data throughput, but EVM/CPU throughput too. ZKP/zkRollups is an obvious example. However, asset pricing can be computation hungry too. And, as we can see now, DeFi asset pricing is an important topic. Unfortunately, EWASM turned to be a much harder idea to implement than initially expected. And it's basically for the same reason - WASM JIT compilers are optimized for a common case, while worst case scenarios can be exploited by an attacker. So, I treat it as another manifestation of the problem discussed above.\n\nWhile the problems are difficult, I am very excited to investigate and implement potential solutions.\n\nOne idea that I'm working on is a (semi-)automated transpilation of Eth2 beacon chain Python specs to Kotlin. The [resulting Kotlin code](https://github.com/ericsson49/research/blob/master/beacon_kotlin_generated/src/phase1/spec.kt) is beautiful, IMHO. Kotlin turned to be a pretty good match for (a statically-typed subset of) Python.\t\n\nAs for a specific bug, it's not yet made public (as it can turn to be a serious vulnerability). But the basic idea is that swapping two lines leaves a function 100% functionally correct, while an attacker can send the code into a practically endless loop.\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan!\n\n[Discovery [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=28)\n\n### Ben Edgington\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Chronicler of Eth2 and Teku PM\n- January 2018 \n\nI could write a book on this, and perhaps one day I will. But the tl;dr is that getting to where we are has been the most incredible journey of my career.\n\nThe technology is thrilling, and the distributed development model no less so. But the highlight above all is getting to work every day with such a brilliant, thoughtful, capable, and generous group of people. If it's true that technology reflects the people who build it, then Eth2 is going to be a superb foundation for all the systems of the world.\n\nAs for the future, the beacon chain was designed, developed and delivered astonishingly quickly, having been conceived only in June 2018. Things get harder from now on: the beacon chain already carries so much value, and we need to begin taking into account the existing value on the Eth1 chain as we work on a merge. I think our main challenges ahead may not be technical, but more governance related. But I am confident that, with the ethos we've established and momentum we have as a community, we can bring this thing to a successful conclusion.\t\n\nI've enjoyed writing up regular digests of the latest developments in the spec since October 2018 at [eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/), really with an audience of just the other Eth2 devs in mind. Over time it's grown and evolved, and now gets between three thousand and ten thousand views per edition. This amazes me.\n\nI am still happy with my one and only ethresear.ch post, co-written with Nicolas Liochon: [\"Exploring the Proposer Collator split.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/exploring-the-proposer-collator-split/1632) While more of a design bug than a code bug, some credited it with finally finishing off the old sharding design, and precipitating the move to the beacon chain. I think things may have already been heading in that direction at the time.\n\nAs for individual shoutouts, what an incredible group of people - you are all amazing!\n\n### Carl Beekhuizen\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nAlthough eth2 has taken longer to get off the ground than I think any of us imagined, the result is extremely robust, secure, and decentralised.\n\nIt is incredibly exciting to see how eth2 is evolving and maturing into the backbone of the decentralised future we all dream about.\n\nI'm most proud of the key-derivation EIPs (2333, 2334, 2335). Specifically, the quantum-secure backup keys built into EIP 2333. In the event of a quantum apocalypse, validators should be able to recover using these Lamport signatures.\n\nI'm also really proud of the Launchpad. ü¶è So many validators managed to deposit safely.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang for the attention to detail and diligence she brings to everything she works on.\n\n### Cayman Nava\n\n- Chainsafe Systems¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- December 2018 \n\nThe past two years have been a blast. Looking back on the progress we've collectively made and the state of the ecosystem, I feel like we're on the cusp of something great. And I'm honored to be a part of it. I anticipate that Ethereum will be of critical importance for the future, as a rock-solid foundation that empowers ultimately successful experiments which aim to resolve many of the hardest problems facing society today.\n\nI'm proud of the [typescript implementation](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ssz) of SSZ (a copy of Proto's remerkleable). It fulfills the spec, but in an ergonomic way. You can operate on an ssz merkle tree as if it is a 'normal' javascript object. This required some exotic code, but the result is seamless [ssz <-> javascript interoperability](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/lodestar-medalla-update-59865a5cce1a).\n\nHuge thanks to Proto and his work! Many of the tools / algorithms / methods he's published are present in Lodestar: remerkleable, eth2-fastspec, protoarray fork choice, etc. the list goes on.\n\n### Celeste Seberras\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Technical Content Strategist\n- May 2018 \n\nIt has been a humbling experience to have witnessed the growth of Prysmatic from a small seedling with a dream to the robust and diverse community it harbours today; equally so for the broader Eth2 ecosystem. Hard work over the past two years has proven that, through all the speculative noise and interindustry drama, the things that truly speak are code and passion.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Prysm client usage manual.\n\nShout out to all the boys here at Prysmatic Labs. You are all fantastic to work with, here's to the future!\n\nShoot for the stars. Even if you miss, holy fuck you're in space!\n\n### Cem Ozer\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2019 \n\nI‚Äôm blown away that the Eth2.0 beacon chain is now alive and well. For me it was such a complex undertaking, and deep down I was scared it would never launch or be successful.\t\n\nWhen I first joined Teku (called Artemis back then) we were almost only working on the state transition. The spec changed pretty rapidly at the time, and as a result we had to update our state transition many times. I found myself leading these changes at Artemis, and it would almost always be a week long intense marathon where we‚Äôd change thousands of lines of code as a team, and I‚Äôd try to make sure we did not break anything.\n\nLuckily this was in the prototyping phase, this is not how it‚Äôs done today in the production phase :). I‚Äôm also pretty proud of having worked on the Eth1 Deposit Management of Teku.\n\nMy best bug discovery is luckily documented by my team lead Adrian Sutton on his blog: [\"The Curious Case of the Invisible Fork.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2020/07/06/exploring-ethereum-2-the-curious-case-of-the-invisible-fork/)\n\nShoutout to Johnny Rhea, Adrian Sutton, and Protolambda. These three people are all geniuses in their own unique ways. It was an honor and an incredible experience working with them.\n\n[Build - Maintain [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=29)\n\n### Chih Cheng Liang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2017 \n\nI'm glad to be part of Eth2 development. There are too many people; I can't express my gratitude enough. There are lots of beautiful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nI'm excited to see what Ethereum will be with fully-fledged PoS as well as sharding.\n\nI'm most proud of introducing the Milagro BLS binding to Trinity. BLS signatures are like the steroids of Eth2. Back then, only one Python library, py_ecc, met the requirements of the Beacon Chain spec. py_ecc is great for research or education purposes, but for things like client implementations, the performance of the library is not on par. The na√Øve alternative is to find a Python binding of a fast language. Chia's Python binding to C++ code was the low hanging fruit to pursue.\n\nAs the Beacon Chain BLS requirements became more specific, and we had to interop with other clients in a short timeframe, we decided to try using Python to wrap \"milagro_bls\" - Sigma Prime's Rust library. The result is the \"milagro_bls_binding\" library. I'm proud of it because that's my first Rust-ish project, and it was used in a real use case.\n\nAs for most challenging bug, in early 2018 I worked on the [Casper prototype testnet](https://github.com/ethereum/trinity/pull/954) that Karl and Vitalik built on pyethapp. Pyethapp had many issues, but the most difficult one to debug was the peer connection issue. I got a lot of help from Dmitry from the Harmony team, he discovered many peer connection issues with the Java client's logs. One of them was pyethapp's catastrophic peer-to-peer bug.\n\nSpecial thanks to Jannik Luhn - he contributed lots of quality work in peer to peer research/simulation and Trinity.\n\n### Dankrad Feist\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- June 2018 \n\nBy historical accident, one of my first ever involvements with Ethereum was the research workshop in Berlin 2018 where the Beacon chain design (and merging of Casper and Sharding) was first decided. I had only come to the workshop because I was in Berlin at the time for my startup and my former colleague and friend, Justin Drake, had invited me to check it out. The concepts that were talked about at this workshop immediately appealed to the nerd inside me -- deep maths and computer science problems, nevertheless approachable and worth exploring to find elegant solutions. \n\nOver the next few months, I tried my luck on some of the problems that were discussed, especially the randomness problem. However, it would only be March 2019 that I left my startup and went to work on Ethereum 2.0 full time, so I would say that the concept of the beacon chain was by then fairly mature and what was left to be done was more tinkering around the edges.\n\nI think it is always worth reminding ourselves that the beacon chain itself, while only one part of Eth2.0, is a very ambitious project. As far as I am aware, Proof of Stake has never been tried on this scale: neither economically nor in the networking sense. What I mean by this is the sheer amount of funds that can be staked on the beacon chain, which due to the Ether market cap can easily approach billions of dollars in value. This is one advantage smaller projects certainly do have over Ethereum -- they can increase stake gradually, whereas Eth2.0 will very quickly go all the way.\n\nNot only that, but most other projects have refrained from actually imposing penalties on validators -- which compromises the security of PoS networks, but obviously makes designing it much easier, because literally nothing is at stake except for some very minor rewards.\n\nFinally, and this is the most important distinction, Eth2.0 is designed so that it can literally accommodate a million validators. That's pretty impressive considering that most other projects only support around 100! Not only that, but this feat is achievable using fairly modest node requirements, in fact it seems perfectly plausible to run a validator on a mobile phone or a Raspberry Pi.\n\nWhen we do launch the beacon chain, which is now truly imminent (barring extreme surprises), we should keep in mind just how ambitious this project is even on its own. \n\nThe beacon chain was essentially frozen 3 months after I joined the team full time, so I would not claim that I have made any major contributions to it. My most important contribution to Eth2.0 that is slated for inclusion so far is re-architecting the Proof of Custody construction so that it is fully suitable for SSVs (Secret Shared Validators). While we weren't too sure of the experimental cryptographic Legendre pseudo-random function (PRF) when we first came across it in March 2019, it has successively improved to a truly impressive construction on all fronts that I am now very proud of:\n\n1. Extended cryptoanalysis has improved our confidence in the Legendre PRF a lot in response to several bounties that we have set out.\n2. The combination of the Legendre PRF with the Universal Hash Function primitive, suggested by Dmitry Khovratovich, means that only a single evaluation of the PRF is needed per proof of custody, and the rest of the computation is extremely efficient and even faster than regular (sha256) hashing.\n3. Thanks to the probabilistic 0.01 bit proof of custody idea, only a small amount of information is leaked from the proof of custody, such that it would be impossible to gain access to custody secrets even if the Legendre PRF were broken outright.\n\nFinally, I have huge respect for Danny Ryan. He is phenomenal at keeping everything together and making it work.\n\n### Danny Ryan\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2017 \n\nSurprise! Everything is a bit harder than originally expected (at least from my perspective) - I suppose most of the things worth doing in life are. Today, I am very excited about the project and the progress. Eth2 has an incredibly strong technical background and is ready for the next wave of upgrades. Huge shout-out to the hard work from client teams, as well as to the validator community keeping this thing running.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the [beacon chain spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md).\n\nFinally, I don't want to imagine how this would have gone without protolambda's insight and technical contributions over the past couple of years.\n\n### Dmitriy Ryajov\n\n- Status¬† \n- libp2p developer\n- August 2019 \n\nSuper grueling, but rewarding in terms of overall impact on the different ecosystems, Eth2 itself, the Nim language and libp2p.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Nim libp2p implementation.\n\n### Hsiao-Wei Wang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Summer 2017 \n\nMy journey started with implementing Serenity‚Ñ¢. It was an ambitious and abstract concept. We've struggled with the design trade-offs for a long time, but with more and more contributors who devoted their efforts, and years of hard work, we were finally able to divide and conquer Eth2.\n\nIt was a fantastic journey to launch Phase 0 finally. I'm so grateful for the broad community support. And, of course, the Ethereum heroes who dove into Ethereum R&D.\n\nI'm very excited about the next Eth2 milestones and the creative ideas that the community will build on Eth2.\n\nI want to mention my admiration for Virgil Griffith, a pioneer that paved the way for Ethereum research work.\n\n[Seen and Seeing [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=30)\n\n### Ivan Martinez\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Engineer\n- August 2018 \n\nWorking on Eth2 has been an amazing adventure. It went from contributing in my free time to becoming my longest running full-time job. While there have been a few blocks on the way (unstable spec, implementation problems, testnet drama), it's been an absolute blast and this is just the start! Very excited to release, and move forward with future phases!\n\nI am particularly proud of building our [end-to-end testing suite](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/3932), which has proved incredibly useful for detecting issues before changes reach the canary. I've also helped build a lot of the [slasher](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5043) and optimized it for mainnet usage.\n\nOne of the most memorable bugs I encountered would have to be: [\"Change StreamIndexedAttestations to use target root for state regen #5971.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5971)\n\nShoutout to Terence Tsao! His ability to understand the spec has constantly amazed me (he's the largest contributor to the spec outside of the EF!).\n\nAlso.. Danny Ryan is awesome :)\n\n### Jacek Sieka\n\n- Status¬† \n- Research Lead\n- March 2018 \n\nI was fortunate to join Eth2 at the very start - having worked on many open source projects before, for fun, peer-to-peer networks like DC++, compilers like nlvm, as well as high-frequency trading. It all came together at that point like a perfect fit - a giant stroke of good luck. Here we are, years later, with the baby well on its way to being delivered.\n\nThe work I'm most proud of is managing to restore sanity and switching [Eth2 to Little Endian](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/139). It survived several high-profile attempts to swing it back to Big. I guess a more memorable, and certainly more involved feature, was the deep collaboration on the networking protocol that culminated with [what we have today](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1328) - this was quite the achievement made possible by some round-the-world collaboration with Adrian (of Sigma Prime), Ra√∫l (of libp2p) and lots of others! Less known is that me and Adrian resorted to flipping an Ethereum block hash coin to see who would get to post the PR :)\n\nI'm most proud of when Paul Hauner and I managed to run a fully independent, self-sufficient [multi-client Eth2 network](https://twitter.com/jcksie/status/1171886857908609024) for the first time, at the Canada retreat!\n\n### Jonny Rhea\n\n- Teku, TX/RX¬† \n- Client lead & TX/RX co-founder\n- November 2018 \n\n\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.\"\n\nParticularly proud of my Ethresearch post, [\"Packetology: Validator \nPrivacy.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/packetology-validator-privacy/7547) \n\nMost memorable bug: [\"DoS Attack on Prysm Stops Finality.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/public-attacknets/issues/12)\n\nShoutout to the Russians!

The equivalents of Project Gemini and Project Apollo are needed next. Rollups and Layer 2 will help improve scalability, but I believe there is much innovation that can and should continue to be done in Layer 1. There is a place for some execution, and cross-shard transactions in Layer 1. I also think that we should be careful about assumptions that we might make, like assuming that cross-shard transactions must be asynchronous. The challenges in the Ethresearch thread [‚ÄúCross-shard DeFi composability‚Äù](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-defi-composability/6268/9) need tackling with minimal assumptions.\n\nI dream of a system that is more scalable, performant, but preserves the default atomicity and synchronicity of Ethereum. I dream of shards that are transparent and automatically load-balancing. It may sound impossible, but can be used to inspire the engineers of the world to build the ambitious system that we can envision.\n\nDevelopments like Apollo and the Internet are an encouraging reminder to what humanity can accomplish: where there's a will, there's a way.\n\nWhy is this important? Why is a platform for decentralized systems important? John Perry Barlow may have answered it with his [‚ÄúDeclaration of the Independence of Cyberspace.‚Äù](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)\n\nPersonally, I'm delighted that [\"The Beacon Chain Ethereum 2.0 explainer you need to read first\"](https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain/) is usually on the first page of Google for \"beacon chain.\" I'm most proud of forming and recruiting a talented R&D group at ConsenSys that has made numerous Ethereum contributions. For Eth2, these include a review of the deposit contract and influencing an important Solidity implementation. More well known is the Quilt team, which started from R&D of Eth2 Phase 2 (execution, threads [quilting], rather than Plasma). Finally, years ago I helped connect Karl Floersch to the Casper \"team\" at EDCON Paris.\n\nShoutout to all of Ethereum Layer 0 -- its people -- without which there would be no Layer 1 or beyond. Layer 0 always welcomes you, and all contributions great and small :)\n\n### Justin Drake\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Late 2017 \n\nLooking back, the beacon chain took longer than expected to ship and there is significant work remaining in the coming years. Having said that, I am incredibly optimistic and excited about the future of Ethereum‚ÄîI could not be more bullish :)\n\nI'm pretty proud of the fact that the beacon chain spec is executable - it's pretty remarkable IMO. How many complex internet protocols have a full executable spec, not to mention four production-grade implementations on day 1?\t\n\nOne of the \"design bugs\" I was involved with early on was having PoS and sharding be separate cryptoeconomic systems as opposed to one unified design. Another big design flaw was using plain (as opposed to aggregatable) signatures. Looking back, in ~2 years we took a visionary but very rough design and made it orders of magnitude better.\n\nFolks dedicated to Eth2 are a rare breed (less than 100 of us) and I have tremendous respect for the team as a whole, as well as many individuals. I will note that, with where things are headed, we may soon have trillions of dollars running on Eth2 and we will need more manpower. So I want to give a shoutout to you‚Äîthe reader‚Äîto consider joining the Ethereum mission :) Hit me up by email, on Twitter, or on Telegram!\n\n[Traditions [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=31)\n\n### Karl Floersch\n\n- prev. Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Winter 2017 \n\nIt has been a wild journey to scale Ethereum & we are ridiculously close to realizing the vision after all this time. It's pretty insane. I'm most proud of the early work I did on [Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/casper) and initial implementation of [Hybrid Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/tree/b704a5c6577863edc539a1ec3d2620a443b950fb/ethereum/hybrid_casper). As for bugs, the pyethereum p2p layer was absolutely terrible and really crippled the testnet :'''(\n\nShoutout to Vitalik, Hsiao-Wei Wang, & Justin Drake!\n\n### Kirk Baird\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt's been a very busy two years; as only my second job working in IT, the learning curve has been massive. First and most importantly, my understanding of the core technologies around blockchains has matured from seeing them as a secure linked list to the complex beast they are. With the focus of my work being on integrating BLS into Lighthouse, a significant knowledge of pairing based cryptography was needed. The BLS signature scheme is far more complicated than the existing ECDSA used in Eth1. Luckily, there are a lot of good resources out there which explain how to progress from classical elliptic curve cryptography to pairing based cryptography.\n\nI was lucky enough to go to DevCon Osaka in 2019 which was an amazing experience! There were so many keen minds all meeting to relish and enjoy the progress Ethereum has made, but also to provide insights and ideas on how it will be improved and developed over the coming years. Japan itself is also an amazing place with so much to see, until we almost got stuck in a typhoon.\n\nI am most proud of the work done on [Milagro BLS](https://github.com/sigp/milagro_bls). This library was rough around the edges when I first inherited it, being a long way from the standardised signature scheme we have now.\n\nFinally, wanted to give a shoutout to Danny Ryan! The man is a weapon.\n\n### Mamy Andr√©-Ratsimbazafy\n\n- Status¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nI remember reading the \"70% ready\" spec in july 2018, that was the wild wild west. Things were on a HackMD document, changes were made every 6 hours and very hard to track - as mentioned in the EthCC 2 talk [\"Tests and Simulations of Eth2.0.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c4mQg5L6Rs&t=597s)\n\nOne of the most significant milestones was when, out of nowhere, all 7 clients at the time were able to create a testnet back in September 2019 in Muskoka. Anticipation, apprehension, will the launch work? If yes, that is definitely a huge milestone!\n\nI'm proud of my work on the [\"Auditors Handbook to Nimbus Beacon Chain.\"](https://nimbus.guide/auditors-book/01_introduction.html) Nimbus uses a dark horse language called Nim. It happens to be easily picked up, and our 3 audit teams were pleasantly surprised by its features, including those related to correctness.\n\nThe most infamous bugs we had were related to fork choice / Proof-of-Stake. The most infamous one would be this one-liner hotfix, where some votes were skipped in period of non-finality: [\"hotfix fork choice score application #2041.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/2041/files)\n\nBig respect to Protolambda! He came like the Hagibis storm.\n\n### Matt Garnett \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Researcher\n- January 2019 \n\nMy perspective on eth2 is probably very different from many people who were focused on Phase 0. Although I compartmentalized Phase 0 and Phase 1 to a large degree to allow myself to consider the possibilities of Phase 2, I never considered the possibility that eth2 wouldn't ship. To me, it was not a matter of \"if\" but \"when.\"\n\nI'm proud of the work I did writing the first Execution Environment for eth2, called [\"sheth.\"](https://github.com/quilt/sheth) It was completely stateless and allowed Ether transfers within a shard. \n\nShoutout to Proto, he has been instrumental in making eth2 happen, I don't know how he manages to be so prolific.\n\nA quick story to wrap up. On the first day of the Canada interop, the Quilt team drove up from Toronto in a 15-person passenger van. It had rained a bit so the area was sort of wet. The venue was tucked away off on a gravel road, right beside the lake. We pulled the van up next to the parked cars and headed in to visit with the eth2 teams. \n\nAfter catching up with everyone, we returned to the van to drive over to the airbnb we were sharing with the ewasm team. Will Villanueva had driven us there, so he hopped in the driver's seat and began orienting the van forwards to head out. The area we had parked in was sort of a T-intersection and there were small drop-offs (0.5m maybe) into a heavily wooded ditch anywhere there wasn't road. Will backed into one of the legs of the T and started to drive forward to leave. Unfortunately, the exit path was a rather steep gravel hill. The 2WD van didn't have the traction climb out and now we were positioned at an awkward angle in the T. The van was perilously close to tipping over into the ditch. Will backed up to a flatter part to regroup. I offered to give it a shot and he obliged. \n\nAt this point, we had drawn a bit of a crowd. I recall having people at each corner of the van, keeping an eye out to help avoid falling off into the ditch. I gave it a few attempts, but realized how difficult of a situation we were in. At this point, it was unclear if we could even return to our starting place, as the front left and back right of the van were less than a foot away from falling into the ditch - a ditch that would no doubt require a tow truck to collect the van from. There was no other option than making it up the hill. Fortunately, there was a bit of flatter ground between the van and the beginning of the hill. Although it would be a tight fit, likely inches on either side into the wooded ditch, I thought that with speed we should be able to build enough momentum to get past the steep portion of the hill. I shared my plan with the spectators. Unsurprisingly, the uninvested patrons were eager to fill me with confidence so they could enjoy the spectacle. I backed up the van as far as the gravel road would allow and then slammed the gas down. The van lurched forward, albeit lethargically, towards the top of the hill. The eth2 gods were almost certainly looking down on us in that moment and guided that van safely to the hill's peak. \n\nAt the top of the hill, I collected my emotions and then stepped out to enjoy the laughing and cheering. We inspected the ridiculous situation we had been in, and examined the ruts that the tires had made spinning out on the fail attempts. After the excitement died down and the spectators returned to the venue to continue working on their clients, we headed back up the hill to our van and drove home. \n\nFor the rest of the time there, we parked the van at the top of the hill and walked down to the venue.\n\n### Mehdi Zerouali\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Security Engineer, Cofounder\n- October 2018 \n\nI find it hard to believe that we're finally launching the beacon chain! So much hard work from so many different entities has gone into this over the past couple of years. I'm extremely proud of what Sigma Prime has accomplished so far and look forward to the Lighthouse crew making Phase 1, Phase 1.5 and Phase 2 a reality.\n\nThe structural differential fuzzer I've helped build as part of Beacon Fuzz is definitely something I'm proud of. Over the last few months, Beacon Fuzz helped uncover more than 40+ bugs on all major client implementations, including critical consensus related vulnerabilities.\n\nIt's hard to pick one person to recognize, but Diederik Loerakker (aka protolambda) has done such an amazing job helping the client teams navigate the optimisations required to implement the eth2 spec in production. Of course, the coordination job done by Danny Ryan is second to none. I doubt we'd be where we are today without these two exceptional individuals.\n\nFun fact: Lighthouse releases are named after Rick & Morty characters!\n\n### Meredith Baxter\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer, Software Engineer\n- November 2019 \n\nI was fortunate to join the Teku team at an exciting time (about a year ahead of the beacon chain launch) in November of 2019. We had a lot of work ahead of us and we weren't sure whether or not we would meet launch deadline with a fully functional, production-ready client. The learning curve to understanding eth2 is also pretty steep, which only increased the pressure. Luckily, the EF and other eth2 client teams have been an incredible resource for us throughout the development process. The engineers involved across the client teams have been very open and supportive. And the EF researchers have been amazingly welcoming, approachable, and responsive. They've always been there for us to answer questions and provide insights. It has been hugely gratifying to be a part of the successful launch of the beacon chain with the help of this incredible group of people. I'm very excited to continue the work as we look forward to upcoming changes including our first hard fork, sharding, and the merge.\t\n\nOne exciting milestone was getting [Teku syncing to a live](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/1143) testnet (Prysm's Sapphire testnet).\n\nI'm also really proud of our [checkpoint sync feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz3flfj50Ig) which allows new nodes to sync up and become fully operational within minutes. See the issue as well: \"[Implement sync from a recent state #3063](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/issues/3063).\"\n\nThe instability on the Medalla testnet in the fall of 2020 was a trying moment across the client teams, but we came out stronger on the other side. We were all working overtime to improve performance and patch issues revealed by the long period of non-finalization. One big fix I managed to push during this time involved putting a hard limit on amount of work required to regenerate states that dropped out of our in-memory cache: [\"[Issue 2608] Add ability to periodically persist hot states #2611.\"](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/2611) More context on the network instability can be found here: [\"Eth2 Implementers‚Äô Call #46 - 2020-08-20.\"](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/S1b2sJhzv)\n\n### Michael Sproul\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nAfter a brief foray into the blockchain world in 2017, I developed a taste for it and knew I had to come back. When I saw a job ad from SigP on Twitter for a proof-of-stake client in Rust, I dropped what I was doing and got involved ASAP. At the beginning I got deep into Lighthouse's consensus code which was then very much in flux due to lots of spec changes, and had been written in a gargantuan solo effort by Paul! From that foothold in consensus I then branched out into the database, op pool and slashing -- all of which captured my interest in a way no other project had. \n\nWhen we ran the first testnets in September 2019 off code I'd contributed to, I was kind of shocked the thing worked at all, and awed by all the hard work done by everyone else involved. This community of researchers, programmers and enthusiasts has been nothing but amazing, and I'm optimistic for a successful Phase 0 launch and the realisation of the Eth2 dream in Phase 1 and beyond. Personally, I can't wait until we can run some transactions, and look forward to getting into the minutiae of WebAssembly execution environments.\t\n\nI'm very proud of Lighthouse's slasher. I was able to draw inspiration from great foundational research laid by Proto, and dedicate myself to building a fast, concise implementation. Testing the implementation on Medalla and watching the carnage inflicted on other validators brought a perverse form of satisfaction ;)\n\nOne of my favorite bugs: [\"DB inconsistent after restart #1488.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/1488)\n\nShoutout to Cem √ñzer!\n\nI know of at least one core dev who force pushed a commit to master in the EthDenver bathrooms...\n\n### Mikhail Kalinin\n\n- PegaSys, TX/RX¬† \n- Applied Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nIt's been exciting to see how Hybrid Casper FFG and the Sharding proposal have been merged into what is now called the Beacon Chain. And how this research is evolving, growing, attracting a lot of new people. And finally the result is about to be shipped pretty soon. This was a big part of my life for two and a half years. I anticipate rapid movement towards Shards and the Merge when Phase 0 is shipped. Though there are many things yet to deal with.\n\nI am proud of the [Eth1 Shard Demo](https://github.com/txrx-research/eth1-shard-demo) that we made together with Guillaume from EF with decent support from EF researchers.\n\nI can give recognition to a bunch of people tbh. But, narrowing down, Danny Ryan and Ben Edgington.\n\n### Nathaniel Jensen\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Security Engineer\n- September 2019 \n\nI'd heard a bit about Ethereum before but had not developed a solid understanding.\n\nAlthough relatively new, I'm glad to play a small part in such a technically impressive undertaking. I am continually appreciative that I can work in such an interesting space, with such friendly and impressive colleagues and community, and contribute to something that has the potential to be profoundly important. I'm excited to see Phase 0 mainnet kick off, the culmination of so much effort!\n\nI look forward seeing the space continue to develop with the incorporation of the EVM chain and Layer 2 solutions, and all the interesting use-cases that I can't begin to imagine.\n\nMy primary contribution to the Eth2 ecosystem had been taking on maintenance and development of a differential fuzzer that compares state transitions across the Eth2 clients: beacon-fuzz. In September 2019, Sigma Prime was engaged by the Ethereum Foundation to continue development of Guido Vranken's previous differential fuzzing solution - comparing ZRNT and Pyspec, the Go and Python Eth2.0 executable specifications.\n\nI was primarily responsible for building out [the fuzzing framework](https://github.com/sigp/beacon-fuzz) to include comparison of other client implementations: Lighthouse, Prysm, Nimbus, Teku, Trinity, as well as adding fuzzing targets for additional state transition functions.\n\nAs for most painful bug, see the [\"Beacon Fuzz update 001\"](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/beacon-fuzz-01.html) on the Sigma Prime blog, section \"Golang Library Linking Errors.\" How to try to get multiple Go implementations running without having their dependencies clash, and dealing with arcane linking issues using existing tooling to build a Go fuzzing library that exercises cgo/C code (as Prysm depends on a C/assembly BLS library).\n\nI want to give a shoutout to Protolambda (Diederik Loerakker). He reliably gets to the bottom of really obtuse fuzzing results. He's our consistent fallback for deciphering complicated results across multiple Eth2 client implementations. From our interactions, he clearly comes across as a friendly, genuine, and technically outstanding individual.\n\n### Nishant Das\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- June 2018 \n\nIt was a very difficult endeavour to get Eth2 running smoothly. Ultimately, with teams well distributed across the globe, constant communication is always a challenge. However, despite all that, I am really proud of the fact that we have launched Phase 0 with 4 different clients running. I'm very optimistic for the future and am looking forward to the merge. There have been too many bugs to count, and I keep on finding new ones every week.\n\nShoutout to Proto - cross client compatibility would be nowhere near what it is without him constantly monitoring and working on it.\n\n### Paul Hauner\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has fostered an inclusive, open, and merit-based approach to technical collaboration. Under this environment we've seen many researchers, engineers and communicators flourish. This is a testament to what people can do when they share a common goal and are empowered to work on the things that interest them.\n\nAs Eth2 has progressed, Sigma Prime has grown steadily to include a team of talented engineers and computer scientists. I am grateful to work with these people and I learn from them every day.\n\nI hope to see Ethereum evolve into a tool that provides honest utility to everyday people, without jeopardising the sovereignty of their data or selves.\n\nRegarding work I'm proud of, I quite like the [minimal-allocation Merkle-tree hasher](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/consensus/tree_hash/src/merkle_hasher.rs) I built in 2018. It's simpler and more powerful than other algorithms I have seen.\n\nOne notable bug: [\"Manipulating deposit contract to gain an early majority #1446.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1446)\n\n### Pawan Dhananjay\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2019 \n\nI remember reading Vitalik's proof of stake blog posts in early 2018 and thinking that it sounds all good in theory, but no way we'll have a proof of stake protocol for more than a small number of participants which would work well in practice. Needless to say, it's been extremely impressive to see how far the effort has come in just a few years. Kudos to everyone involved, I'm glad to have been a part of the effort for the past year.\n\nAlso, a huge shoutout to the SigP crew! It has been an absolute blast working with these guys, learning from them and also indulging in their jolly Aussie humor :) Excited for the Phase 0 launch and geared up to begin work on Phase 1!\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be: [\"Update state before producing attestation #1596.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/1596)\n\nBig thanks to protolambda for sure. All his debugging tools have saved me (and many others I'm sure) hours of effort.\n\n### Preston Van Loon\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe last few years have been an adventure, to say the least. At first, I had just a mild interest in Ethereum. I didn't own any cryptocurrencies or really understand how they worked. After a few months of reading, I started to realize two things: 1) Ethereum was this incredible technology that has an unlimited potential to change the world for the better, and 2) Ethereum is incredibly slow and desperately needed to scale. \n\nImmediately, I looked for ways to help contribute to the scaling effort and then I met Raul Jordan. We met together in NYC for coffee and talked about starting a project to work on sharding for Ethereum. We formed Prysmatic Labs. Since starting the company in January of 2018, I've met some of the most interesting people in the world - many have become close friends. Working in Ethereum continues to fulfill my desire to make a positive impact, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the completed roll out of Eth2.\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be that time that all of Prysm nodes thought they were 4 hours in the future and thousands of validators were slashed in a testnet: [\"Roughtime reports clock offset by 4hrs #6825.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/6825)\n\n### Protolambda\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- November 2018 \n\nThe main theme is that we - researchers and client devs - did not make our lives easy. Spec updates have continued to improve the protocol itself, but caused instability in the process of updating implementations. A new network stack was adopted, and many difficult research and implementation problems had to be solved. In the future, I do not think this will change, as Phase 1 and later are complicated too. But the approach can be improved. Exploratory single-client implementation ahead of others could avoid duplicating work for other clients, and enable faster spec updates.\n\nMost memorable bug: [\"247120: encoding/binary: read at most MaxVarintLen64 bytes in ReadUvarint.\"](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/247120)\n\nShoutout to @Butta for his work on the beaconchain explorer.\n\n### Rados≈Çaw Kapka\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Software Engineer\n- May 2020 \n\nWhat struck me most when I joined the project was the seemingly infinite amount of good will and patience from others when onboarding a new contributor. I really appreciate it. As for the future, I fail to see how Eth2 can not succeed when there are so many great people working on it.\n\nShoutout to the whole Prysmatic team! Everyone is so cool I can't just pick one person.\n\nI planned to visit Japan in the summer of 2020 and start learning Eth2 after coming back. The pandemic ruined my plans so I joined the Prysm project in May as a contributor. Three months later I got invited to be one of the core team members. Pretty cool, huh? I guess 2020 is not that bad after all.\n\n### Raul Jordan\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nWe went from being a bunch of hobbyists and volunteers interested in Ethereum's future, to having a ton of responsibility with a client being used by a large portion of stakers today. Core dev work was indistinguishable from magic to me before starting on this, and it honestly still is. However, I am fortunate to be surrounded by people much smarter than I am, and constantly learning how to write better code. Every day, we feel the weight of the work we do and we foresee it will only keep getting more important, as Phases 1 and 2 develop and eventually Ethereum will be powering world-scale transaction volume, likely using the code we wrote. At some point, the blockchain we are building might have multinational implications, and the hard work from the research team to make it as robust as possible is very encouraging. I could not be any happier with how far it‚Äôs come along, and we'll ship it.\n\nI am most proud of our [original eth2 API](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/ethereumapis). One day I was hanging out with Preston and Terence and we‚Äôre like ‚Äúwhoa! Etherscan built a block explorer using our API for eth2??‚Äù and then beaconcha.in popped up and it was honestly mind-blowing. We spent a lot of time putting it together and it contributed to the success of the Prysm client early on.\n\nOur most memorable bug would have to be the [Medalla Testnet Incident](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-medalla-testnet-incident-f7fbc3cc934a).\n\nI admire my team at Prysmatic Labs. I look up to them every week in awe of their resourcefulness, prescience, and just overall raw software engineering knowledge.\n\nOur journey with eth2 started with a few of us posting in a go-ethereum gitter channel regarding starting a prototype implementation of Vitalik‚Äôs sharding FAQ. Little did we know that just a few months later, we would be neck deep into everything about proof of stake and sharding with Vitalik and the Ethereum Research team in Taipei. Coincidentally, I was visiting New York the same week I met Preston online via gitter, and managed to meet up in his office and start Prysmatic Labs officially within the next few days!\n\n### Robert Drost \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Project Manager\n- August 2018 \n\nLooking back, one remarkable thing that stands out to me is the unifying culture of optimism and positivity among the people who found Eth and Eth2 and dove into working on it. Kind of by self-selection over time, it's a community that wants to strive for the positive side of things. While it‚Äôs not always possible to maintain this, somehow over time it seems to always get back there again.\n\nMoving forward, two themes I look forward to will be the acceleration of innovation and delivery around Eth2, and the growth of bridging among Eth2 and most other crypto communities and protocols that matter.\n\nShoutout to Casey Detrio ‚Äî I love how he always seems to find a novel analysis angle to things!\n\n### Sam Wilson \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Protocol Research Engineer\n- October 2019 \n\nWell, I'm a relative newcomer to Ethereum. I'd been vaguely aware of Ethereum for years, and I had (and still have) a couple hundredths of a bitcoin lying around, but Devcon V was jumping head first into the space.\n\nThe Ethereum community, once you get past all the... crap on the fringe, is full of really welcoming people who come from really diverse philosophies. I found that particularly surprising, given how many scammers and hangers on there are.\n\nEth2, which is actually where I started learning Ethereum, is a huge undertaking being built by an equally huge amorphous conglomeration. Seeing the discussions from execution environments and WASM to pure data availability and minimal execution, and the journey from where we were a year ago to actually getting the beacon chain launched has been one of the most exciting periods of my career so far.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next phases, layers, and whatever else comes with Eth2, but more importantly, I'm excited for the memes, because really, that's what this is all about.\n\nIt's hard to compare what I've contributed with the amazing other things going on in the space, but I guess I'd have to say that the write-up on dynamic state access that Ansgar Dietrichs and I put together is probably the most influential thing I've worked on: [\"State Provider Models in Ethereum 2.0.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/state-provider-models-in-ethereum-2-0/6750)\n\n### Shay Zluf\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nLooking back on this past two years makes me feel how this space is being shaped by the people who build it, their values and their convictions. Working in Prysmatic Labs developed my skills and code quality in a way that I cannot describe. Raul Jordan and Preston van Loon make sure to lead by example. All the team members are super motivated and take eth2.0's success as their own responsibility. That kind of dedication comes only from taking part in a project that has higher purpose for each member of the team. Looking forward, I see those bright and enthusiastic figures attracting many more talented people into the eth2.0 effort, while step by step the Ethereum ecosystem becomes the collaboration infrastructure of humanity.\n\nI took part in kickstarting the slasher implementation in Prysm's code base. As context, old POS systems had a major flaw, called the \"nothing at stake problem.\" Policing the set of rules to avoid this on the massive scale of the beacon chain is a challenge. Solving this led to the design and implementation of the Prysmatic Labs slasher. Working with other team members and protolambda from the eth2.0 research team was a great privilege. I got a first hand experience of protolambda‚Äôs ingenuity in finding novel solutions to hard problems.\n\nShoutout goes to Preston Van Loon.\n\n### Stefan Talpalaru\n\n- Status¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2018 \n\nWe're moving at what probably looks like a slow pace, from the outside, but I'm confident we'll be able to replace Proof of Work with Proof of Stake. I can't wait to see the estimates for energy consumption reduction in the years to come!\n\nI'm proud of the many changes that lead to reproducible builds. It all started with replacing a language-specific package manager with Makefiles and Git submodules, in order to have a fine-grained control over all our dependencies. Over time, it grew into a somewhat reusable [\"build system.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-build-system)\n\nI also liked designing and implementing well-defined components like our [metrics library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-metrics/) or the [NAT traversal library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-nat-traversal). Much messier, but equally rewarding, was changing the Nim compiler and standard library to implement [efficient stack traces](https://github.com/status-im/nim-libbacktrace).\n\nI like hunting down mysterious stack corruptions. A memorable one was due to the wrong calling convention being used in a [C library wrapper](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/677#issuecomment-575636421). Another [nice one](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/issues/640#issuecomment-57008484) was triggered by a procedure parameter called \"errno\" (which the Nim compiler forgot to name-mangle).\n\n### Terence Tsao\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt has been an amazing journey, we have learned and accomplished so much along the way. Lots of great memories and friendships were formed. \n\nWith Phase 0 heading towards finish line, I'm particular excited about Phase 1 and all its cutting edge research. Go Eth2!\n\n### Victor Farazdagi\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Engineer\n- February 2020 \n\nMy Ethereum journey started in 2016, when I joined Status in building a censorship-resistant messenger. It quickly became apparent that, despite all the goodness the Ethereum platform and its decentralized network brought, in its current implementation they are relatively limited. So, getting attracted to Ethereum 2, with all its ambitious plans to revamp an already hugely innovative product, was just a matter of time for me. Right now, being part of the amazing crowd of highly motivated, even idealistic, people - with a chance to participate in delivering on the original Ethereum promises - is nothing less than a dream come true. I love the community, the leadership, and even the complexity of the software we're building. With Phase 0 behind us, we have significant momentum, so 2021 will definitely become a year of groundbreaking accomplishments!\n\nOne bit of work I am particularly proud of is the [\"initial synchronization implementation,\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/tree/develop/beacon-chain/sync/initial-sync) which absolutely every beacon-node runner relies on. So, whenever you cannot sync, or sync takes forever, you know who to blame for it now!\n\nRegarding nasty bugs, during the [\"Medalla incident\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/7039) in August 2020, we had troubles syncing back. While the fix was easy, discovering the problem wasn't.\n\nShoutout to Diederik Loerakker! (yeah, better known as protolambda)\n\n### Vitalik Buterin\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- January 2014 \n\nI'm really happy to see how far the Ethereum ecosystem has come in the last few years! In the dark old days back in 2014-2017, it was just myself, Vlad and a couple other people thinking about proof of stake and sharding, and progress was slow; since then, there has been a rapid growth, professionalization and general improvement in the ecosystem and the team. We have much more sophisticated tools, are dealing with advanced cryptography, and a much better process for creating and refining the spec and the implementations. 2020 eth2 is sooo much better than Casper in 2017!\n\nNow, of course, we enter what may perhaps prove to be the most difficult part of the whole process: getting eth2 actually out the door and running. The whole process reminds me of what we had to deal with back in 2015, except this time there's 10x the complexity, 100x more people watching and 1000x the value at stake. Good luck all :)\n\nIf I had to pick one component I'm proud of .. maybe [the entire phase 0 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md)?\n\nShoutout to Danny.\n\n### Will Villanueva\n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Researcher\n- February 2018 \n\nEth2 research was overwhelmingly fun. We explored pushing the boundaries on how the execution layer could operate. We prototyped, researched, and implemented a simpler version of advanced execution (Execution Environments) on eth1, also known as account abstraction.\n\nA lot of the work Quilt pursued is covered in the post titled [\"Ethereum 2.0 Phase 2 Progress.\"](https://medium.com/@william.j.villanueva/ethereum-2-0-phase-2-progress-7673b57eabff) \n\nAdditionally, some of our account abstraction work can be found on Ethresear.ch as [\"DoS Vectors in Account Abstraction (AA) or Validation Generalization, a Case Study in Geth.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/dos-vectors-in-account-abstraction-aa-or-validation-generalization-a-case-study-in-geth/7937)\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan, all the way!\n\n[Onward [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=32)\n\n---\n\n*Kudos for reading to the end!

While the content and framing has evolved over the past 6 months, the core vision has remained the same: to craft a crypto-native artifact that captures the humanity of the people building the future of Ethereum.\n\nIt contains the hopes, fears, and anticipations of the Eth2 researchers and client implementers directly responsible for bringing the Beacon Chain to life on December 1, 2020. The future of the Beacon Chain is the future of Ethereum, and we‚Äôre proud to tell part of its story this far.\n\nWe prompted contributors with a few questions - you'll find them in order in each response, some but not all answered.\n\n- Name / handle\n- Affiliated orgs\n- Primary role\n- Eth2 rough start date\n- General summary of experiences\n- Code or documentation they are particularly proud of\n- Most memorable or painful-to-discover Eth2 bug\n- Person you've come to admire or want to give a shoutout to\n\nKeep in mind that these responses were gathered both before and after the Beacon Chain launch, so references to launch expectations will vary. Profiles are ordered alphabetically by first name.\n\nFinally, while we made the utmost effort to include as many people as possible, it‚Äôs inevitable that we missed or were unable to feature some contributors. Eth2 wouldn‚Äôt be what it is without the input of hundreds of community testers and code contributors - thank you.\n\n---\n\n### Ethereum = Eth1 + Eth2\n\n- Ben Edgington\n- Originally [published on eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/wnie2_210328), 28th March, 2021\n\nLet's start with a quick history of what's become known as Eth2, and where it's headed in the future.\n\nRecently, Danny Ryan has announced his [intent to deprecate](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/) the use of the terms eth1 and eth2. As the creator and curator of ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New in Eth2,‚Äù this is a bit of a blow!\n\nBut, on the whole, I agree that these terms are beginning to outlive their usefulness, and are in danger of becoming quite misleading. It‚Äôs not really about fiddling with names; it‚Äôs about capturing fundamental changes in direction, and communicating them clearly. Changes in the roadmap are confusing for the community. Clarity in naming aids clarity of understanding.\n\nHere's a brief history of naming things in Ethereum‚Äôs roadmap.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the first use of the name ‚ÄúEthereum 2‚Äù was by Vitalik in Hacker News, way back in [April 2014](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7554923). He positioned Ethereum 2 as being a future step-change in the capability of Ethereum through the use of ‚Äúfundamental cryptographic upgrades.‚Äù\n\nEthereum 2 then drops out of view, and the main narrative becomes the familiar Frontier ‚Üí Homestead ‚Üí Metropolis ‚Üí Serenity progression, first described in [March 2015](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). In this scheme, Serenity is the network upgrade to Proof of Stake; Serenity isn‚Äôt Ethereum 2 per se. Interestingly, sharding/scaling doesn‚Äôt have a clear place in that roadmap, although it was certainly discussed [around that time](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/05/blockchain-scalability-chain-fibers-redux/).\n\nProgress largely followed this plan for some years, with Homestead going live in March 2016, and Metropolis (in name at least) in a pair of upgrades in October 2017 and February 2019.\n\nSerenity was to have been delivered via a process of upgrading the existing Ethereum chain to bootstrap Proof of Stake. That upgrade was specified in [EIP-1011](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1011.md) and there was even a [testnet](https://hackmd.io/@aTTDQ4GiRVyyce6trnsfpg/Hk6UiFU7z?type=view) that went live on December 31st, 2017.\n\nHowever, the road to Serenity was found to be a dead-end, not least because of the vast amount of Ether that stakers would require - 1500 was the number back then.\n\nSo, in mid 2018, we tore up that roadmap and started afresh with Ethereum 2.0. Rather, we reverted to Vitalik‚Äôs original idea from 2014 of an Ethereum 2 that was to be a significant cryptographic step-change to the protocol. Calling this Eth 2.0 made sense: we were planning to change pretty much everything about the platform. Ethereum 1 would eventually be brought in as a kind of legacy system. This Ethereum 2.0 roadmap came with neat consecutive phases: Phase 0 for Proof of Stake; Phase 1 for data shards; Phase 2 for executable shards; and, finally, bring Eth1 over to Eth2 after all that.\n\nWe‚Äôve now delivered Phase 0, but the rest of the plan has evolved. As per the latest Eth2 pages [on the ethereum.org website](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/), ‚ÄúEth2 [now] refers to a *set of interconnected upgrades* that will make Ethereum more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable‚Äù (emphasis mine). This looks much more like the old Serenity plan! We‚Äôre upgrading the Ethereum chain in-place rather than doing the old rip-and-replace.\n\nSo, you see, the roadmap narrative has vacillated over the years between effectively doing a replacement of Ethereum 1, referred to at various times as Eth2, and doing in-place upgrades to Eth1. Today, we‚Äôre more or less back in upgrade territory.\n\nIn view of all this, applying the Ethereum 2.0 moniker to the entire project is now seen as confusing: to some it implies a different chain to today‚Äôs Ethereum; to others, even [a different coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/md75k2/will_be_eth_20_a_new_coin_or_will_be_the_same_eth/). It suggests incompatibilities and problems ahead.\n\nThe [latest naming trend](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/), then, is to limit Eth2 to refer only to the consensus layer upgrade of Ethereum to Proof of Stake, and to refer to all of today‚Äôs Ethereum (fka Eth1) as the execution layer.\n\nIt's good to see everything moving under a consistent terminology and a shared roadmap. I'm looking forward to a productive rest of 2021 and beyond!\n\n[Continuations [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=26)\n\n### Aditya Asgaonkar\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2019 \n\nEth2 promises to deliver a decentralized, scalable, and secure blockchain platform on which stateful applications can live. These three qualities will be the driving force towards the mass adoption of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn the quest to satisfy the design requirements, we've also seen some amazing research and engineering progress. We have pushed the frontier of computer science in areas such as Byzantine consensus, signature aggregation, and VDFs. With the launch of Phase 0, we created the largest BFT consensus network in existence, which is an awesome feat in itself!\n\nMy favorite bit of work was the [\"Weak Subjectivity Guide\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/weak-subjectivity.md) - a document that outlines the weak subjectivity safety features of the Eth2.0 network. The goal is to prevent long range attacks that appear specifically in PoS consensus.\n\nAs for favorite bug, there was a consensus (fork-choice) issue discovered right before the Beacon Chain launch. The first priority was to assess the threat level of the attack -- it was critical and could have lead to a large-scale failure, but was extremely difficult to execute. Fixing this attack vector required a comprehensive review of the fork-choice component, and we had already identified a couple of solutions. At the end, there was agreement among the spec team that the attack didn't pose a critical threat because of its difficult execution, and we decided to publish a fix after further review was completed.\n\n### Adrian Manning\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Co-Lead Developer\n- Aug 2018 \n\nThe project has always been ambitious. The early designs were well thought out, but had shortcomings which became apparent when realising them through implementation. The collaboration between researchers and developers constantly iterated on these design specs for years, finally achieving a workable version of the original concept. The process was longer than expected, but it's been amazing to see the coordination and what has been achieved by a globally distributed group of implementers and researchers.\n\nOf all the work put into the Lighthouse client, I've changed and modified various architectures and designs and I'll likely continue to do so. I'm therefore not particularly fond of any individual piece relative to another. But I'm very proud of the end result. The resulting Lighthouse code-base that came together from everyone's hard work is what I'm most proud of.\n\nAs for person to give a shoutout to, I'm sure everyone has a similar answer, but for me it's Danny and Proto. Danny for the amazing organisational role and interfacing with all the client teams (especially on contentious topics) has sped up the development immensely. Proto (Diederick) for his relentless troubleshooting, bug-finding and research endeavours. He has been invaluable in interop testing, optimisation improvements and all round improving the general state of all clients and the eth2 ecosystem in general.\n\nAlso - there's an Australian saying, which I think applies to all eth2 researchers and developers: We're not here to f$!k spiders!\n\n### Adrian Sutton\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nEth2 is this big idea that started as a seed right back when Ethereum began and then went on this crazy, messy, long journey as the details were thrashed out through open research and public collaboration. All that messiness and the length of the journey is a result of this unique, highly collaborative and distributed approach to designing it. Multiple times, concepts that had been thought settled were thrown out because a better idea came along. While that has been frustrating for on-lookers, it has led to and continues to lead to huge improvements in the resulting technology.\n\nThe interop lock-in in Canada was a major turning point in the progress of Phase 0. It forced the Beacon Chain out of that research mode. Suddenly, client development was less about translating the Python spec to another language and more about engineering all the other components that make a client actually usable. Client teams finally had a stable platform to work from and make clients interoperable. There was an explosion of tools to aid developers in debugging and testing across clients. The Beacon Chain had stopped being a research project and started being an engineering one. The road to Mainnet started to become clear.\n\nNow with the deposit contract launched and deposits flowing into it, the pressure to deliver the rest of Eth2 really amps up. Community pressure to unlock those funds again will become overwhelming and despite all the warnings that it won't be quick, people will be disappointed at how long it takes. But those locked funds will also be the equivalent of the interop lock-in, forcing work out of the research phase and into production. All that time spent researching led people to wonder if Eth2 will ever ship, but with the beacon chain launch and all that money locked in, Eth2 has almost unstoppable momentum.\n\nThe future of Ethereum is very bright.\n\nI'm quite proud of my blog post explaining the weak subjectivity period: [\"Exploring Ethereum 2: Weak Subjectivity Period.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2019/11/27/exploring-ethereum-2-weak-subjectivity-period/) It was just me trying to get my head around a concept everyone seemed to be very hand-wavy about and put off solving to the future, yet it's become one of the standard reference points to explain the concept.\n\nI'm proud to have worked with Meredith Baxter and Cem Ozer. They have both been doing all the heavy lifting for Teku, almost entirely behind the scenes. They aren't flashy Twitter personalities, they just put their heads down and do the work.\n\nA few anecdotes to conclude: \n\n1. Family commitments mean I don't travel much, so when the first 7-client interop happened and a photo was posted of people crowded around the computer watching it, everyone in the photo was quickly identified but no one had any clue who I was. For a little while I was just \"that random guy in all the eth2 photos\".\n2. Before Ethereum, Ben Edgington only ever wore button-up, collared shirts. He's now exclusively dressed in Ethereum related T-shirts and has even picked up a penchant for Ethereum hoodies.\n\n[Caravans [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=27)\n\n### Afri Schoedon\n\n- Byzantine Fault / ESP Grantee¬† \n- Testnet Engineer\n- June 2018 \n\nI was working at Parity Technologies in 2018 which managed to implement EIP 1011, the \"Hybrid Casper FFG\" in the Parity Ethereum client. It was a hybrid proof-of-stake approach to the consensus engine and literally my first memory of seeing anything Eth2 related actually being implemented and run. There was Casper testnet up and running with Harmony, Pythereum, and Parity. It was exciting to see the idea of \"Serenity\" starting to materialize. \n\nHowever, it was the same year (only a few weeks later) that the Berlin Eth2 workshop decided to completely discard the hybrid Casper ideas in favor of the beacon chain. Admittedly, it was a massive undertaking. After all the ideation and the first implementations and testnets, we basically started from scratch. \n\nPrysmatic Labs first caught my attention when they launched their first public beacon chain testnets at the end of 2019. I was wondering why we had seven Eth2 clients but none of them was able to synchronize to the other clients' testnets. I was hooked and reached out to the Ethereum Foundation and the Goerli Initiative about contributing to multi-client testnets. And that's what I did in 2020, testnet after testnet up to the mainnet launch.\n\nWhen we launched the Goerli testnet in January 2019, it was not only an important milestone for Eth1 but it was also the perfect chance for Eth2 client teams to use this for their Eth1 integration leading up to the beacon chain genesis. Prysmatic Labs seized this moment and deployed all their Eth2 testnets to date to the Goerli testnet. Coindesk wrote a feature story with the headline [\"A New Test Network Just Activated and Ethereum 2.0 Will Be Using It.\"](https://www.coindesk.com/testnet-gorli-ethereum-serenity)\n\nAll my work on Eth2 concluded with the Eth2 mainnet launch in December 2020. The eight multi-client testnets are well documented on Github and received quite some [media attention](https://github.com/goerli/medalla).\n\nAs for bugs or missing features, that would be the lack of [BLS signature verifications](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/2081) in the deposit contract.\n\nShoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang!\n\n### Alex Stokes\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2018 \n\nWhat a ride it has been! The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020 represents the culmination of years of research and development across countless contributors from every corner of the globe, reaching as far back as the Ethereum genesis block.\n\nIt has been exhilarating to watch this effort go from a collection of wild ideas (e.g. informal talks on Casper from Devcon 3) to today‚Äôs production-scale mainnet. Having been involved before the ‚Äúcasper + sharding‚Äù merge and the formation of the eth2 umbrella, I have seen time and again how a dedicated group of individuals adapts and responds to changes both inside and outside the community. It is this resilience that I find most exciting, and that gives me confidence in a very bright future for Ethereum.\n\nWe are ready to weather whatever challenges may come our way and I cannot wait as we deploy a scalable Ethereum in 2021 and beyond.\n\nI'll highlight [some of the early Casper work](https://github.com/ethereum/casper/pull/143) that got me involved directly with eth2 in mid-2018. Part of the original proof-of-stake design involved a validator registry contract hosted on the eth1 chain. As part of the deposit process, validators provided an arbitrary smart contract for signature verification. While an interesting application of account abstraction, this smart contract needed to be deterministic so that signatures could be independently verified on-chain. In order to ensure the smart contract had the desired properties, it was processed by another smart contract, the \"purity checker\" (in the sense of a pure computation), during the initial registration.\n\nAn early version of the purity checker was written in a now deprecated smart contract language called Serpent LLL. I created a Gitcoin bounty to port the Serpent LLL to a language stack used in the ethereum/casper project, Vyper LLL.\n\nMost painful bug would definitely have to be debugging cross-client interactions during the eth2 interop event in 2019. Fun times, good people and challenging bugs!\n\nShoutout to protolambda!\n\n### Alex Vlasov\n\n- TX/RX¬† \n- Applied Researcher\n- July 2019 \n\nMy predominant impression is that Eth2 poses problems, which are perhaps the most challenging from a software engineering point of view, at the moment. This is exciting from a researcher's perspective, but sometimes frustrating from a software engineer's one. We must adapt, in order to survive in the endeavor.\n\nOne aspect is that we, as software engineers, are used to optimizing for the common case, largely overlooking rare ones. But the latter ones are exactly what an attacker will thoroughly scrutinize! The habit is difficult to break, especially considering that it demands huge amounts of time to analyze and optimize the worst case behavior.\n\nI'm confident that we have to use Formal Methods, as testing is not able to explore the search space exhaustively (except for rare cases, when the space is relatively small).\n\nAnother important aspect is that modern DeFi is demanding on resources. And that is not only data throughput, but EVM/CPU throughput too. ZKP/zkRollups is an obvious example. However, asset pricing can be computation hungry too. And, as we can see now, DeFi asset pricing is an important topic. Unfortunately, EWASM turned to be a much harder idea to implement than initially expected. And it's basically for the same reason - WASM JIT compilers are optimized for a common case, while worst case scenarios can be exploited by an attacker. So, I treat it as another manifestation of the problem discussed above.\n\nWhile the problems are difficult, I am very excited to investigate and implement potential solutions.\n\nOne idea that I'm working on is a (semi-)automated transpilation of Eth2 beacon chain Python specs to Kotlin. The [resulting Kotlin code](https://github.com/ericsson49/research/blob/master/beacon_kotlin_generated/src/phase1/spec.kt) is beautiful, IMHO. Kotlin turned to be a pretty good match for (a statically-typed subset of) Python.\t\n\nAs for a specific bug, it's not yet made public (as it can turn to be a serious vulnerability). But the basic idea is that swapping two lines leaves a function 100% functionally correct, while an attacker can send the code into a practically endless loop.\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan!\n\n[Discovery [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=28)\n\n### Ben Edgington\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Chronicler of Eth2 and Teku PM\n- January 2018 \n\nI could write a book on this, and perhaps one day I will. But the tl;dr is that getting to where we are has been the most incredible journey of my career.\n\nThe technology is thrilling, and the distributed development model no less so. But the highlight above all is getting to work every day with such a brilliant, thoughtful, capable, and generous group of people. If it's true that technology reflects the people who build it, then Eth2 is going to be a superb foundation for all the systems of the world.\n\nAs for the future, the beacon chain was designed, developed and delivered astonishingly quickly, having been conceived only in June 2018. Things get harder from now on: the beacon chain already carries so much value, and we need to begin taking into account the existing value on the Eth1 chain as we work on a merge. I think our main challenges ahead may not be technical, but more governance related. But I am confident that, with the ethos we've established and momentum we have as a community, we can bring this thing to a successful conclusion.\t\n\nI've enjoyed writing up regular digests of the latest developments in the spec since October 2018 at [eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/), really with an audience of just the other Eth2 devs in mind. Over time it's grown and evolved, and now gets between three thousand and ten thousand views per edition. This amazes me.\n\nI am still happy with my one and only ethresear.ch post, co-written with Nicolas Liochon: [\"Exploring the Proposer Collator split.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/exploring-the-proposer-collator-split/1632) While more of a design bug than a code bug, some credited it with finally finishing off the old sharding design, and precipitating the move to the beacon chain. I think things may have already been heading in that direction at the time.\n\nAs for individual shoutouts, what an incredible group of people - you are all amazing!\n\n### Carl Beekhuizen\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nAlthough eth2 has taken longer to get off the ground than I think any of us imagined, the result is extremely robust, secure, and decentralised.\n\nIt is incredibly exciting to see how eth2 is evolving and maturing into the backbone of the decentralised future we all dream about.\n\nI'm most proud of the key-derivation EIPs (2333, 2334, 2335). Specifically, the quantum-secure backup keys built into EIP 2333. In the event of a quantum apocalypse, validators should be able to recover using these Lamport signatures.\n\nI'm also really proud of the Launchpad. ü¶è So many validators managed to deposit safely.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang for the attention to detail and diligence she brings to everything she works on.\n\n### Cayman Nava\n\n- Chainsafe Systems¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- December 2018 \n\nThe past two years have been a blast. Looking back on the progress we've collectively made and the state of the ecosystem, I feel like we're on the cusp of something great. And I'm honored to be a part of it. I anticipate that Ethereum will be of critical importance for the future, as a rock-solid foundation that empowers ultimately successful experiments which aim to resolve many of the hardest problems facing society today.\n\nI'm proud of the [typescript implementation](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ssz) of SSZ (a copy of Proto's remerkleable). It fulfills the spec, but in an ergonomic way. You can operate on an ssz merkle tree as if it is a 'normal' javascript object. This required some exotic code, but the result is seamless [ssz <-> javascript interoperability](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/lodestar-medalla-update-59865a5cce1a).\n\nHuge thanks to Proto and his work! Many of the tools / algorithms / methods he's published are present in Lodestar: remerkleable, eth2-fastspec, protoarray fork choice, etc. the list goes on.\n\n### Celeste Seberras\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Technical Content Strategist\n- May 2018 \n\nIt has been a humbling experience to have witnessed the growth of Prysmatic from a small seedling with a dream to the robust and diverse community it harbours today; equally so for the broader Eth2 ecosystem. Hard work over the past two years has proven that, through all the speculative noise and interindustry drama, the things that truly speak are code and passion.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Prysm client usage manual.\n\nShout out to all the boys here at Prysmatic Labs. You are all fantastic to work with, here's to the future!\n\nShoot for the stars. Even if you miss, holy fuck you're in space!\n\n### Cem Ozer\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2019 \n\nI‚Äôm blown away that the Eth2.0 beacon chain is now alive and well. For me it was such a complex undertaking, and deep down I was scared it would never launch or be successful.\t\n\nWhen I first joined Teku (called Artemis back then) we were almost only working on the state transition. The spec changed pretty rapidly at the time, and as a result we had to update our state transition many times. I found myself leading these changes at Artemis, and it would almost always be a week long intense marathon where we‚Äôd change thousands of lines of code as a team, and I‚Äôd try to make sure we did not break anything.\n\nLuckily this was in the prototyping phase, this is not how it‚Äôs done today in the production phase :). I‚Äôm also pretty proud of having worked on the Eth1 Deposit Management of Teku.\n\nMy best bug discovery is luckily documented by my team lead Adrian Sutton on his blog: [\"The Curious Case of the Invisible Fork.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2020/07/06/exploring-ethereum-2-the-curious-case-of-the-invisible-fork/)\n\nShoutout to Johnny Rhea, Adrian Sutton, and Protolambda. These three people are all geniuses in their own unique ways. It was an honor and an incredible experience working with them.\n\n[Build - Maintain [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=29)\n\n### Chih Cheng Liang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2017 \n\nI'm glad to be part of Eth2 development. There are too many people; I can't express my gratitude enough. There are lots of beautiful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nI'm excited to see what Ethereum will be with fully-fledged PoS as well as sharding.\n\nI'm most proud of introducing the Milagro BLS binding to Trinity. BLS signatures are like the steroids of Eth2. Back then, only one Python library, py_ecc, met the requirements of the Beacon Chain spec. py_ecc is great for research or education purposes, but for things like client implementations, the performance of the library is not on par. The na√Øve alternative is to find a Python binding of a fast language. Chia's Python binding to C++ code was the low hanging fruit to pursue.\n\nAs the Beacon Chain BLS requirements became more specific, and we had to interop with other clients in a short timeframe, we decided to try using Python to wrap \"milagro_bls\" - Sigma Prime's Rust library. The result is the \"milagro_bls_binding\" library. I'm proud of it because that's my first Rust-ish project, and it was used in a real use case.\n\nAs for most challenging bug, in early 2018 I worked on the [Casper prototype testnet](https://github.com/ethereum/trinity/pull/954) that Karl and Vitalik built on pyethapp. Pyethapp had many issues, but the most difficult one to debug was the peer connection issue. I got a lot of help from Dmitry from the Harmony team, he discovered many peer connection issues with the Java client's logs. One of them was pyethapp's catastrophic peer-to-peer bug.\n\nSpecial thanks to Jannik Luhn - he contributed lots of quality work in peer to peer research/simulation and Trinity.\n\n### Dankrad Feist\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- June 2018 \n\nBy historical accident, one of my first ever involvements with Ethereum was the research workshop in Berlin 2018 where the Beacon chain design (and merging of Casper and Sharding) was first decided. I had only come to the workshop because I was in Berlin at the time for my startup and my former colleague and friend, Justin Drake, had invited me to check it out. The concepts that were talked about at this workshop immediately appealed to the nerd inside me -- deep maths and computer science problems, nevertheless approachable and worth exploring to find elegant solutions. \n\nOver the next few months, I tried my luck on some of the problems that were discussed, especially the randomness problem. However, it would only be March 2019 that I left my startup and went to work on Ethereum 2.0 full time, so I would say that the concept of the beacon chain was by then fairly mature and what was left to be done was more tinkering around the edges.\n\nI think it is always worth reminding ourselves that the beacon chain itself, while only one part of Eth2.0, is a very ambitious project. As far as I am aware, Proof of Stake has never been tried on this scale: neither economically nor in the networking sense. What I mean by this is the sheer amount of funds that can be staked on the beacon chain, which due to the Ether market cap can easily approach billions of dollars in value. This is one advantage smaller projects certainly do have over Ethereum -- they can increase stake gradually, whereas Eth2.0 will very quickly go all the way.\n\nNot only that, but most other projects have refrained from actually imposing penalties on validators -- which compromises the security of PoS networks, but obviously makes designing it much easier, because literally nothing is at stake except for some very minor rewards.\n\nFinally, and this is the most important distinction, Eth2.0 is designed so that it can literally accommodate a million validators. That's pretty impressive considering that most other projects only support around 100! Not only that, but this feat is achievable using fairly modest node requirements, in fact it seems perfectly plausible to run a validator on a mobile phone or a Raspberry Pi.\n\nWhen we do launch the beacon chain, which is now truly imminent (barring extreme surprises), we should keep in mind just how ambitious this project is even on its own. \n\nThe beacon chain was essentially frozen 3 months after I joined the team full time, so I would not claim that I have made any major contributions to it. My most important contribution to Eth2.0 that is slated for inclusion so far is re-architecting the Proof of Custody construction so that it is fully suitable for SSVs (Secret Shared Validators). While we weren't too sure of the experimental cryptographic Legendre pseudo-random function (PRF) when we first came across it in March 2019, it has successively improved to a truly impressive construction on all fronts that I am now very proud of:\n\n1. Extended cryptoanalysis has improved our confidence in the Legendre PRF a lot in response to several bounties that we have set out.\n2. The combination of the Legendre PRF with the Universal Hash Function primitive, suggested by Dmitry Khovratovich, means that only a single evaluation of the PRF is needed per proof of custody, and the rest of the computation is extremely efficient and even faster than regular (sha256) hashing.\n3. Thanks to the probabilistic 0.01 bit proof of custody idea, only a small amount of information is leaked from the proof of custody, such that it would be impossible to gain access to custody secrets even if the Legendre PRF were broken outright.\n\nFinally, I have huge respect for Danny Ryan. He is phenomenal at keeping everything together and making it work.\n\n### Danny Ryan\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2017 \n\nSurprise! Everything is a bit harder than originally expected (at least from my perspective) - I suppose most of the things worth doing in life are. Today, I am very excited about the project and the progress. Eth2 has an incredibly strong technical background and is ready for the next wave of upgrades. Huge shout-out to the hard work from client teams, as well as to the validator community keeping this thing running.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the [beacon chain spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md).\n\nFinally, I don't want to imagine how this would have gone without protolambda's insight and technical contributions over the past couple of years.\n\n### Dmitriy Ryajov\n\n- Status¬† \n- libp2p developer\n- August 2019 \n\nSuper grueling, but rewarding in terms of overall impact on the different ecosystems, Eth2 itself, the Nim language and libp2p.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Nim libp2p implementation.\n\n### Hsiao-Wei Wang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Summer 2017 \n\nMy journey started with implementing Serenity‚Ñ¢. It was an ambitious and abstract concept. We've struggled with the design trade-offs for a long time, but with more and more contributors who devoted their efforts, and years of hard work, we were finally able to divide and conquer Eth2.\n\nIt was a fantastic journey to launch Phase 0 finally. I'm so grateful for the broad community support. And, of course, the Ethereum heroes who dove into Ethereum R&D.\n\nI'm very excited about the next Eth2 milestones and the creative ideas that the community will build on Eth2.\n\nI want to mention my admiration for Virgil Griffith, a pioneer that paved the way for Ethereum research work.\n\n[Seen and Seeing [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=30)\n\n### Ivan Martinez\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Engineer\n- August 2018 \n\nWorking on Eth2 has been an amazing adventure. It went from contributing in my free time to becoming my longest running full-time job. While there have been a few blocks on the way (unstable spec, implementation problems, testnet drama), it's been an absolute blast and this is just the start! Very excited to release, and move forward with future phases!\n\nI am particularly proud of building our [end-to-end testing suite](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/3932), which has proved incredibly useful for detecting issues before changes reach the canary. I've also helped build a lot of the [slasher](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5043) and optimized it for mainnet usage.\n\nOne of the most memorable bugs I encountered would have to be: [\"Change StreamIndexedAttestations to use target root for state regen #5971.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5971)\n\nShoutout to Terence Tsao! His ability to understand the spec has constantly amazed me (he's the largest contributor to the spec outside of the EF!).\n\nAlso.. Danny Ryan is awesome :)\n\n### Jacek Sieka\n\n- Status¬† \n- Research Lead\n- March 2018 \n\nI was fortunate to join Eth2 at the very start - having worked on many open source projects before, for fun, peer-to-peer networks like DC++, compilers like nlvm, as well as high-frequency trading. It all came together at that point like a perfect fit - a giant stroke of good luck. Here we are, years later, with the baby well on its way to being delivered.\n\nThe work I'm most proud of is managing to restore sanity and switching [Eth2 to Little Endian](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/139). It survived several high-profile attempts to swing it back to Big. I guess a more memorable, and certainly more involved feature, was the deep collaboration on the networking protocol that culminated with [what we have today](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1328) - this was quite the achievement made possible by some round-the-world collaboration with Adrian (of Sigma Prime), Ra√∫l (of libp2p) and lots of others! Less known is that me and Adrian resorted to flipping an Ethereum block hash coin to see who would get to post the PR :)\n\nI'm most proud of when Paul Hauner and I managed to run a fully independent, self-sufficient [multi-client Eth2 network](https://twitter.com/jcksie/status/1171886857908609024) for the first time, at the Canada retreat!\n\n### Jonny Rhea\n\n- Teku, TX/RX¬† \n- Client lead & TX/RX co-founder\n- November 2018 \n\n\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.\"\n\nParticularly proud of my Ethresearch post, [\"Packetology: Validator \nPrivacy.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/packetology-validator-privacy/7547) \n\nMost memorable bug: [\"DoS Attack on Prysm Stops Finality.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/public-attacknets/issues/12)\n\nShoutout to the Russians!

Most proud of my implementation of the deposit tree logic in Teku. Toughest bug was getting the \"is_valid_merkle_branch\" method working in Teku.\n\nShoutout to Jonny Rhea & Mikhail!\n\n### JosephC \n\n- ConsenSys¬† \n- R&D\n- January 2019 \n\nThe Beacon Chain launch is like Project Mercury: getting into space/orbit. The equivalents of Project Gemini and Project Apollo are needed next. Rollups and Layer 2 will help improve scalability, but I believe there is much innovation that can and should continue to be done in Layer 1. There is a place for some execution, and cross-shard transactions in Layer 1. I also think that we should be careful about assumptions that we might make, like assuming that cross-shard transactions must be asynchronous. The challenges in the Ethresearch thread [‚ÄúCross-shard DeFi composability‚Äù](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-defi-composability/6268/9) need tackling with minimal assumptions.\n\nI dream of a system that is more scalable, performant, but preserves the default atomicity and synchronicity of Ethereum. I dream of shards that are transparent and automatically load-balancing. It may sound impossible, but can be used to inspire the engineers of the world to build the ambitious system that we can envision.\n\nDevelopments like Apollo and the Internet are an encouraging reminder to what humanity can accomplish: where there's a will, there's a way.\n\nWhy is this important? Why is a platform for decentralized systems important? John Perry Barlow may have answered it with his [‚ÄúDeclaration of the Independence of Cyberspace.‚Äù](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)\n\nPersonally, I'm delighted that [\"The Beacon Chain Ethereum 2.0 explainer you need to read first\"](https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain/) is usually on the first page of Google for \"beacon chain.\" I'm most proud of forming and recruiting a talented R&D group at ConsenSys that has made numerous Ethereum contributions. For Eth2, these include a review of the deposit contract and influencing an important Solidity implementation. More well known is the Quilt team, which started from R&D of Eth2 Phase 2 (execution, threads [quilting], rather than Plasma). Finally, years ago I helped connect Karl Floersch to the Casper \"team\" at EDCON Paris.\n\nShoutout to all of Ethereum Layer 0 -- its people -- without which there would be no Layer 1 or beyond. Layer 0 always welcomes you, and all contributions great and small :)\n\n### Justin Drake\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Late 2017 \n\nLooking back, the beacon chain took longer than expected to ship and there is significant work remaining in the coming years. Having said that, I am incredibly optimistic and excited about the future of Ethereum‚ÄîI could not be more bullish :)\n\nI'm pretty proud of the fact that the beacon chain spec is executable - it's pretty remarkable IMO. How many complex internet protocols have a full executable spec, not to mention four production-grade implementations on day 1?\t\n\nOne of the \"design bugs\" I was involved with early on was having PoS and sharding be separate cryptoeconomic systems as opposed to one unified design. Another big design flaw was using plain (as opposed to aggregatable) signatures. Looking back, in ~2 years we took a visionary but very rough design and made it orders of magnitude better.\n\nFolks dedicated to Eth2 are a rare breed (less than 100 of us) and I have tremendous respect for the team as a whole, as well as many individuals. I will note that, with where things are headed, we may soon have trillions of dollars running on Eth2 and we will need more manpower. So I want to give a shoutout to you‚Äîthe reader‚Äîto consider joining the Ethereum mission :) Hit me up by email, on Twitter, or on Telegram!\n\n[Traditions [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=31)\n\n### Karl Floersch\n\n- prev. Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Winter 2017 \n\nIt has been a wild journey to scale Ethereum & we are ridiculously close to realizing the vision after all this time. It's pretty insane. I'm most proud of the early work I did on [Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/casper) and initial implementation of [Hybrid Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/tree/b704a5c6577863edc539a1ec3d2620a443b950fb/ethereum/hybrid_casper). As for bugs, the pyethereum p2p layer was absolutely terrible and really crippled the testnet :'''(\n\nShoutout to Vitalik, Hsiao-Wei Wang, & Justin Drake!\n\n### Kirk Baird\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt's been a very busy two years; as only my second job working in IT, the learning curve has been massive. First and most importantly, my understanding of the core technologies around blockchains has matured from seeing them as a secure linked list to the complex beast they are. With the focus of my work being on integrating BLS into Lighthouse, a significant knowledge of pairing based cryptography was needed. The BLS signature scheme is far more complicated than the existing ECDSA used in Eth1. Luckily, there are a lot of good resources out there which explain how to progress from classical elliptic curve cryptography to pairing based cryptography.\n\nI was lucky enough to go to DevCon Osaka in 2019 which was an amazing experience! There were so many keen minds all meeting to relish and enjoy the progress Ethereum has made, but also to provide insights and ideas on how it will be improved and developed over the coming years. Japan itself is also an amazing place with so much to see, until we almost got stuck in a typhoon.\n\nI am most proud of the work done on [Milagro BLS](https://github.com/sigp/milagro_bls). This library was rough around the edges when I first inherited it, being a long way from the standardised signature scheme we have now.\n\nFinally, wanted to give a shoutout to Danny Ryan! The man is a weapon.\n\n### Mamy Andr√©-Ratsimbazafy\n\n- Status¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nI remember reading the \"70% ready\" spec in july 2018, that was the wild wild west. Things were on a HackMD document, changes were made every 6 hours and very hard to track - as mentioned in the EthCC 2 talk [\"Tests and Simulations of Eth2.0.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c4mQg5L6Rs&t=597s)\n\nOne of the most significant milestones was when, out of nowhere, all 7 clients at the time were able to create a testnet back in September 2019 in Muskoka. Anticipation, apprehension, will the launch work? If yes, that is definitely a huge milestone!\n\nI'm proud of my work on the [\"Auditors Handbook to Nimbus Beacon Chain.\"](https://nimbus.guide/auditors-book/01_introduction.html) Nimbus uses a dark horse language called Nim. It happens to be easily picked up, and our 3 audit teams were pleasantly surprised by its features, including those related to correctness.\n\nThe most infamous bugs we had were related to fork choice / Proof-of-Stake. The most infamous one would be this one-liner hotfix, where some votes were skipped in period of non-finality: [\"hotfix fork choice score application #2041.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/2041/files)\n\nBig respect to Protolambda! He came like the Hagibis storm.\n\n### Matt Garnett \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Researcher\n- January 2019 \n\nMy perspective on eth2 is probably very different from many people who were focused on Phase 0. Although I compartmentalized Phase 0 and Phase 1 to a large degree to allow myself to consider the possibilities of Phase 2, I never considered the possibility that eth2 wouldn't ship. To me, it was not a matter of \"if\" but \"when.\"\n\nI'm proud of the work I did writing the first Execution Environment for eth2, called [\"sheth.\"](https://github.com/quilt/sheth) It was completely stateless and allowed Ether transfers within a shard. \n\nShoutout to Proto, he has been instrumental in making eth2 happen, I don't know how he manages to be so prolific.\n\nA quick story to wrap up. On the first day of the Canada interop, the Quilt team drove up from Toronto in a 15-person passenger van. It had rained a bit so the area was sort of wet. The venue was tucked away off on a gravel road, right beside the lake. We pulled the van up next to the parked cars and headed in to visit with the eth2 teams. \n\nAfter catching up with everyone, we returned to the van to drive over to the airbnb we were sharing with the ewasm team. Will Villanueva had driven us there, so he hopped in the driver's seat and began orienting the van forwards to head out. The area we had parked in was sort of a T-intersection and there were small drop-offs (0.5m maybe) into a heavily wooded ditch anywhere there wasn't road. Will backed into one of the legs of the T and started to drive forward to leave. Unfortunately, the exit path was a rather steep gravel hill. The 2WD van didn't have the traction climb out and now we were positioned at an awkward angle in the T. The van was perilously close to tipping over into the ditch. Will backed up to a flatter part to regroup. I offered to give it a shot and he obliged. \n\nAt this point, we had drawn a bit of a crowd. I recall having people at each corner of the van, keeping an eye out to help avoid falling off into the ditch. I gave it a few attempts, but realized how difficult of a situation we were in. At this point, it was unclear if we could even return to our starting place, as the front left and back right of the van were less than a foot away from falling into the ditch - a ditch that would no doubt require a tow truck to collect the van from. There was no other option than making it up the hill. Fortunately, there was a bit of flatter ground between the van and the beginning of the hill. Although it would be a tight fit, likely inches on either side into the wooded ditch, I thought that with speed we should be able to build enough momentum to get past the steep portion of the hill. I shared my plan with the spectators. Unsurprisingly, the uninvested patrons were eager to fill me with confidence so they could enjoy the spectacle. I backed up the van as far as the gravel road would allow and then slammed the gas down. The van lurched forward, albeit lethargically, towards the top of the hill. The eth2 gods were almost certainly looking down on us in that moment and guided that van safely to the hill's peak. \n\nAt the top of the hill, I collected my emotions and then stepped out to enjoy the laughing and cheering. We inspected the ridiculous situation we had been in, and examined the ruts that the tires had made spinning out on the fail attempts. After the excitement died down and the spectators returned to the venue to continue working on their clients, we headed back up the hill to our van and drove home. \n\nFor the rest of the time there, we parked the van at the top of the hill and walked down to the venue.\n\n### Mehdi Zerouali\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Security Engineer, Cofounder\n- October 2018 \n\nI find it hard to believe that we're finally launching the beacon chain! So much hard work from so many different entities has gone into this over the past couple of years. I'm extremely proud of what Sigma Prime has accomplished so far and look forward to the Lighthouse crew making Phase 1, Phase 1.5 and Phase 2 a reality.\n\nThe structural differential fuzzer I've helped build as part of Beacon Fuzz is definitely something I'm proud of. Over the last few months, Beacon Fuzz helped uncover more than 40+ bugs on all major client implementations, including critical consensus related vulnerabilities.\n\nIt's hard to pick one person to recognize, but Diederik Loerakker (aka protolambda) has done such an amazing job helping the client teams navigate the optimisations required to implement the eth2 spec in production. Of course, the coordination job done by Danny Ryan is second to none. I doubt we'd be where we are today without these two exceptional individuals.\n\nFun fact: Lighthouse releases are named after Rick & Morty characters!\n\n### Meredith Baxter\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer, Software Engineer\n- November 2019 \n\nI was fortunate to join the Teku team at an exciting time (about a year ahead of the beacon chain launch) in November of 2019. We had a lot of work ahead of us and we weren't sure whether or not we would meet launch deadline with a fully functional, production-ready client. The learning curve to understanding eth2 is also pretty steep, which only increased the pressure. Luckily, the EF and other eth2 client teams have been an incredible resource for us throughout the development process. The engineers involved across the client teams have been very open and supportive. And the EF researchers have been amazingly welcoming, approachable, and responsive. They've always been there for us to answer questions and provide insights. It has been hugely gratifying to be a part of the successful launch of the beacon chain with the help of this incredible group of people. I'm very excited to continue the work as we look forward to upcoming changes including our first hard fork, sharding, and the merge.\t\n\nOne exciting milestone was getting [Teku syncing to a live](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/1143) testnet (Prysm's Sapphire testnet).\n\nI'm also really proud of our [checkpoint sync feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz3flfj50Ig) which allows new nodes to sync up and become fully operational within minutes. See the issue as well: \"[Implement sync from a recent state #3063](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/issues/3063).\"\n\nThe instability on the Medalla testnet in the fall of 2020 was a trying moment across the client teams, but we came out stronger on the other side. We were all working overtime to improve performance and patch issues revealed by the long period of non-finalization. One big fix I managed to push during this time involved putting a hard limit on amount of work required to regenerate states that dropped out of our in-memory cache: [\"[Issue 2608] Add ability to periodically persist hot states #2611.\"](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/2611) More context on the network instability can be found here: [\"Eth2 Implementers‚Äô Call #46 - 2020-08-20.\"](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/S1b2sJhzv)\n\n### Michael Sproul\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nAfter a brief foray into the blockchain world in 2017, I developed a taste for it and knew I had to come back. When I saw a job ad from SigP on Twitter for a proof-of-stake client in Rust, I dropped what I was doing and got involved ASAP. At the beginning I got deep into Lighthouse's consensus code which was then very much in flux due to lots of spec changes, and had been written in a gargantuan solo effort by Paul! From that foothold in consensus I then branched out into the database, op pool and slashing -- all of which captured my interest in a way no other project had. \n\nWhen we ran the first testnets in September 2019 off code I'd contributed to, I was kind of shocked the thing worked at all, and awed by all the hard work done by everyone else involved. This community of researchers, programmers and enthusiasts has been nothing but amazing, and I'm optimistic for a successful Phase 0 launch and the realisation of the Eth2 dream in Phase 1 and beyond. Personally, I can't wait until we can run some transactions, and look forward to getting into the minutiae of WebAssembly execution environments.\t\n\nI'm very proud of Lighthouse's slasher. I was able to draw inspiration from great foundational research laid by Proto, and dedicate myself to building a fast, concise implementation. Testing the implementation on Medalla and watching the carnage inflicted on other validators brought a perverse form of satisfaction ;)\n\nOne of my favorite bugs: [\"DB inconsistent after restart #1488.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/1488)\n\nShoutout to Cem √ñzer!\n\nI know of at least one core dev who force pushed a commit to master in the EthDenver bathrooms...\n\n### Mikhail Kalinin\n\n- PegaSys, TX/RX¬† \n- Applied Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nIt's been exciting to see how Hybrid Casper FFG and the Sharding proposal have been merged into what is now called the Beacon Chain. And how this research is evolving, growing, attracting a lot of new people. And finally the result is about to be shipped pretty soon. This was a big part of my life for two and a half years. I anticipate rapid movement towards Shards and the Merge when Phase 0 is shipped. Though there are many things yet to deal with.\n\nI am proud of the [Eth1 Shard Demo](https://github.com/txrx-research/eth1-shard-demo) that we made together with Guillaume from EF with decent support from EF researchers.\n\nI can give recognition to a bunch of people tbh. But, narrowing down, Danny Ryan and Ben Edgington.\n\n### Nathaniel Jensen\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Security Engineer\n- September 2019 \n\nI'd heard a bit about Ethereum before but had not developed a solid understanding.\n\nAlthough relatively new, I'm glad to play a small part in such a technically impressive undertaking. I am continually appreciative that I can work in such an interesting space, with such friendly and impressive colleagues and community, and contribute to something that has the potential to be profoundly important. I'm excited to see Phase 0 mainnet kick off, the culmination of so much effort!\n\nI look forward seeing the space continue to develop with the incorporation of the EVM chain and Layer 2 solutions, and all the interesting use-cases that I can't begin to imagine.\n\nMy primary contribution to the Eth2 ecosystem had been taking on maintenance and development of a differential fuzzer that compares state transitions across the Eth2 clients: beacon-fuzz. In September 2019, Sigma Prime was engaged by the Ethereum Foundation to continue development of Guido Vranken's previous differential fuzzing solution - comparing ZRNT and Pyspec, the Go and Python Eth2.0 executable specifications.\n\nI was primarily responsible for building out [the fuzzing framework](https://github.com/sigp/beacon-fuzz) to include comparison of other client implementations: Lighthouse, Prysm, Nimbus, Teku, Trinity, as well as adding fuzzing targets for additional state transition functions.\n\nAs for most painful bug, see the [\"Beacon Fuzz update 001\"](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/beacon-fuzz-01.html) on the Sigma Prime blog, section \"Golang Library Linking Errors.\" How to try to get multiple Go implementations running without having their dependencies clash, and dealing with arcane linking issues using existing tooling to build a Go fuzzing library that exercises cgo/C code (as Prysm depends on a C/assembly BLS library).\n\nI want to give a shoutout to Protolambda (Diederik Loerakker). He reliably gets to the bottom of really obtuse fuzzing results. He's our consistent fallback for deciphering complicated results across multiple Eth2 client implementations. From our interactions, he clearly comes across as a friendly, genuine, and technically outstanding individual.\n\n### Nishant Das\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- June 2018 \n\nIt was a very difficult endeavour to get Eth2 running smoothly. Ultimately, with teams well distributed across the globe, constant communication is always a challenge. However, despite all that, I am really proud of the fact that we have launched Phase 0 with 4 different clients running. I'm very optimistic for the future and am looking forward to the merge. There have been too many bugs to count, and I keep on finding new ones every week.\n\nShoutout to Proto - cross client compatibility would be nowhere near what it is without him constantly monitoring and working on it.\n\n### Paul Hauner\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has fostered an inclusive, open, and merit-based approach to technical collaboration. Under this environment we've seen many researchers, engineers and communicators flourish. This is a testament to what people can do when they share a common goal and are empowered to work on the things that interest them.\n\nAs Eth2 has progressed, Sigma Prime has grown steadily to include a team of talented engineers and computer scientists. I am grateful to work with these people and I learn from them every day.\n\nI hope to see Ethereum evolve into a tool that provides honest utility to everyday people, without jeopardising the sovereignty of their data or selves.\n\nRegarding work I'm proud of, I quite like the [minimal-allocation Merkle-tree hasher](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/consensus/tree_hash/src/merkle_hasher.rs) I built in 2018. It's simpler and more powerful than other algorithms I have seen.\n\nOne notable bug: [\"Manipulating deposit contract to gain an early majority #1446.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1446)\n\n### Pawan Dhananjay\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2019 \n\nI remember reading Vitalik's proof of stake blog posts in early 2018 and thinking that it sounds all good in theory, but no way we'll have a proof of stake protocol for more than a small number of participants which would work well in practice. Needless to say, it's been extremely impressive to see how far the effort has come in just a few years. Kudos to everyone involved, I'm glad to have been a part of the effort for the past year.\n\nAlso, a huge shoutout to the SigP crew! It has been an absolute blast working with these guys, learning from them and also indulging in their jolly Aussie humor :) Excited for the Phase 0 launch and geared up to begin work on Phase 1!\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be: [\"Update state before producing attestation #1596.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/1596)\n\nBig thanks to protolambda for sure. All his debugging tools have saved me (and many others I'm sure) hours of effort.\n\n### Preston Van Loon\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe last few years have been an adventure, to say the least. At first, I had just a mild interest in Ethereum. I didn't own any cryptocurrencies or really understand how they worked. After a few months of reading, I started to realize two things: 1) Ethereum was this incredible technology that has an unlimited potential to change the world for the better, and 2) Ethereum is incredibly slow and desperately needed to scale. \n\nImmediately, I looked for ways to help contribute to the scaling effort and then I met Raul Jordan. We met together in NYC for coffee and talked about starting a project to work on sharding for Ethereum. We formed Prysmatic Labs. Since starting the company in January of 2018, I've met some of the most interesting people in the world - many have become close friends. Working in Ethereum continues to fulfill my desire to make a positive impact, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the completed roll out of Eth2.\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be that time that all of Prysm nodes thought they were 4 hours in the future and thousands of validators were slashed in a testnet: [\"Roughtime reports clock offset by 4hrs #6825.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/6825)\n\n### Protolambda\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- November 2018 \n\nThe main theme is that we - researchers and client devs - did not make our lives easy. Spec updates have continued to improve the protocol itself, but caused instability in the process of updating implementations. A new network stack was adopted, and many difficult research and implementation problems had to be solved. In the future, I do not think this will change, as Phase 1 and later are complicated too. But the approach can be improved. Exploratory single-client implementation ahead of others could avoid duplicating work for other clients, and enable faster spec updates.\n\nMost memorable bug: [\"247120: encoding/binary: read at most MaxVarintLen64 bytes in ReadUvarint.\"](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/247120)\n\nShoutout to @Butta for his work on the beaconchain explorer.\n\n### Rados≈Çaw Kapka\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Software Engineer\n- May 2020 \n\nWhat struck me most when I joined the project was the seemingly infinite amount of good will and patience from others when onboarding a new contributor. I really appreciate it. As for the future, I fail to see how Eth2 can not succeed when there are so many great people working on it.\n\nShoutout to the whole Prysmatic team! Everyone is so cool I can't just pick one person.\n\nI planned to visit Japan in the summer of 2020 and start learning Eth2 after coming back. The pandemic ruined my plans so I joined the Prysm project in May as a contributor. Three months later I got invited to be one of the core team members. Pretty cool, huh? I guess 2020 is not that bad after all.\n\n### Raul Jordan\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nWe went from being a bunch of hobbyists and volunteers interested in Ethereum's future, to having a ton of responsibility with a client being used by a large portion of stakers today. Core dev work was indistinguishable from magic to me before starting on this, and it honestly still is. However, I am fortunate to be surrounded by people much smarter than I am, and constantly learning how to write better code. Every day, we feel the weight of the work we do and we foresee it will only keep getting more important, as Phases 1 and 2 develop and eventually Ethereum will be powering world-scale transaction volume, likely using the code we wrote. At some point, the blockchain we are building might have multinational implications, and the hard work from the research team to make it as robust as possible is very encouraging. I could not be any happier with how far it‚Äôs come along, and we'll ship it.\n\nI am most proud of our [original eth2 API](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/ethereumapis). One day I was hanging out with Preston and Terence and we‚Äôre like ‚Äúwhoa! Etherscan built a block explorer using our API for eth2??‚Äù and then beaconcha.in popped up and it was honestly mind-blowing. We spent a lot of time putting it together and it contributed to the success of the Prysm client early on.\n\nOur most memorable bug would have to be the [Medalla Testnet Incident](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-medalla-testnet-incident-f7fbc3cc934a).\n\nI admire my team at Prysmatic Labs. I look up to them every week in awe of their resourcefulness, prescience, and just overall raw software engineering knowledge.\n\nOur journey with eth2 started with a few of us posting in a go-ethereum gitter channel regarding starting a prototype implementation of Vitalik‚Äôs sharding FAQ. Little did we know that just a few months later, we would be neck deep into everything about proof of stake and sharding with Vitalik and the Ethereum Research team in Taipei. Coincidentally, I was visiting New York the same week I met Preston online via gitter, and managed to meet up in his office and start Prysmatic Labs officially within the next few days!\n\n### Robert Drost \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Project Manager\n- August 2018 \n\nLooking back, one remarkable thing that stands out to me is the unifying culture of optimism and positivity among the people who found Eth and Eth2 and dove into working on it. Kind of by self-selection over time, it's a community that wants to strive for the positive side of things. While it‚Äôs not always possible to maintain this, somehow over time it seems to always get back there again.\n\nMoving forward, two themes I look forward to will be the acceleration of innovation and delivery around Eth2, and the growth of bridging among Eth2 and most other crypto communities and protocols that matter.\n\nShoutout to Casey Detrio ‚Äî I love how he always seems to find a novel analysis angle to things!\n\n### Sam Wilson \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Protocol Research Engineer\n- October 2019 \n\nWell, I'm a relative newcomer to Ethereum. I'd been vaguely aware of Ethereum for years, and I had (and still have) a couple hundredths of a bitcoin lying around, but Devcon V was jumping head first into the space.\n\nThe Ethereum community, once you get past all the... crap on the fringe, is full of really welcoming people who come from really diverse philosophies. I found that particularly surprising, given how many scammers and hangers on there are.\n\nEth2, which is actually where I started learning Ethereum, is a huge undertaking being built by an equally huge amorphous conglomeration. Seeing the discussions from execution environments and WASM to pure data availability and minimal execution, and the journey from where we were a year ago to actually getting the beacon chain launched has been one of the most exciting periods of my career so far.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next phases, layers, and whatever else comes with Eth2, but more importantly, I'm excited for the memes, because really, that's what this is all about.\n\nIt's hard to compare what I've contributed with the amazing other things going on in the space, but I guess I'd have to say that the write-up on dynamic state access that Ansgar Dietrichs and I put together is probably the most influential thing I've worked on: [\"State Provider Models in Ethereum 2.0.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/state-provider-models-in-ethereum-2-0/6750)\n\n### Shay Zluf\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nLooking back on this past two years makes me feel how this space is being shaped by the people who build it, their values and their convictions. Working in Prysmatic Labs developed my skills and code quality in a way that I cannot describe. Raul Jordan and Preston van Loon make sure to lead by example. All the team members are super motivated and take eth2.0's success as their own responsibility. That kind of dedication comes only from taking part in a project that has higher purpose for each member of the team. Looking forward, I see those bright and enthusiastic figures attracting many more talented people into the eth2.0 effort, while step by step the Ethereum ecosystem becomes the collaboration infrastructure of humanity.\n\nI took part in kickstarting the slasher implementation in Prysm's code base. As context, old POS systems had a major flaw, called the \"nothing at stake problem.\" Policing the set of rules to avoid this on the massive scale of the beacon chain is a challenge. Solving this led to the design and implementation of the Prysmatic Labs slasher. Working with other team members and protolambda from the eth2.0 research team was a great privilege. I got a first hand experience of protolambda‚Äôs ingenuity in finding novel solutions to hard problems.\n\nShoutout goes to Preston Van Loon.\n\n### Stefan Talpalaru\n\n- Status¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2018 \n\nWe're moving at what probably looks like a slow pace, from the outside, but I'm confident we'll be able to replace Proof of Work with Proof of Stake. I can't wait to see the estimates for energy consumption reduction in the years to come!\n\nI'm proud of the many changes that lead to reproducible builds. It all started with replacing a language-specific package manager with Makefiles and Git submodules, in order to have a fine-grained control over all our dependencies. Over time, it grew into a somewhat reusable [\"build system.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-build-system)\n\nI also liked designing and implementing well-defined components like our [metrics library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-metrics/) or the [NAT traversal library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-nat-traversal). Much messier, but equally rewarding, was changing the Nim compiler and standard library to implement [efficient stack traces](https://github.com/status-im/nim-libbacktrace).\n\nI like hunting down mysterious stack corruptions. A memorable one was due to the wrong calling convention being used in a [C library wrapper](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/677#issuecomment-575636421). Another [nice one](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/issues/640#issuecomment-57008484) was triggered by a procedure parameter called \"errno\" (which the Nim compiler forgot to name-mangle).\n\n### Terence Tsao\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt has been an amazing journey, we have learned and accomplished so much along the way. Lots of great memories and friendships were formed. \n\nWith Phase 0 heading towards finish line, I'm particular excited about Phase 1 and all its cutting edge research. Go Eth2!\n\n### Victor Farazdagi\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Engineer\n- February 2020 \n\nMy Ethereum journey started in 2016, when I joined Status in building a censorship-resistant messenger. It quickly became apparent that, despite all the goodness the Ethereum platform and its decentralized network brought, in its current implementation they are relatively limited. So, getting attracted to Ethereum 2, with all its ambitious plans to revamp an already hugely innovative product, was just a matter of time for me. Right now, being part of the amazing crowd of highly motivated, even idealistic, people - with a chance to participate in delivering on the original Ethereum promises - is nothing less than a dream come true. I love the community, the leadership, and even the complexity of the software we're building. With Phase 0 behind us, we have significant momentum, so 2021 will definitely become a year of groundbreaking accomplishments!\n\nOne bit of work I am particularly proud of is the [\"initial synchronization implementation,\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/tree/develop/beacon-chain/sync/initial-sync) which absolutely every beacon-node runner relies on. So, whenever you cannot sync, or sync takes forever, you know who to blame for it now!\n\nRegarding nasty bugs, during the [\"Medalla incident\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/7039) in August 2020, we had troubles syncing back. While the fix was easy, discovering the problem wasn't.\n\nShoutout to Diederik Loerakker! (yeah, better known as protolambda)\n\n### Vitalik Buterin\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- January 2014 \n\nI'm really happy to see how far the Ethereum ecosystem has come in the last few years! In the dark old days back in 2014-2017, it was just myself, Vlad and a couple other people thinking about proof of stake and sharding, and progress was slow; since then, there has been a rapid growth, professionalization and general improvement in the ecosystem and the team. We have much more sophisticated tools, are dealing with advanced cryptography, and a much better process for creating and refining the spec and the implementations. 2020 eth2 is sooo much better than Casper in 2017!\n\nNow, of course, we enter what may perhaps prove to be the most difficult part of the whole process: getting eth2 actually out the door and running. The whole process reminds me of what we had to deal with back in 2015, except this time there's 10x the complexity, 100x more people watching and 1000x the value at stake. Good luck all :)\n\nIf I had to pick one component I'm proud of .. maybe [the entire phase 0 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md)?\n\nShoutout to Danny.\n\n### Will Villanueva\n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Researcher\n- February 2018 \n\nEth2 research was overwhelmingly fun. We explored pushing the boundaries on how the execution layer could operate. We prototyped, researched, and implemented a simpler version of advanced execution (Execution Environments) on eth1, also known as account abstraction.\n\nA lot of the work Quilt pursued is covered in the post titled [\"Ethereum 2.0 Phase 2 Progress.\"](https://medium.com/@william.j.villanueva/ethereum-2-0-phase-2-progress-7673b57eabff) \n\nAdditionally, some of our account abstraction work can be found on Ethresear.ch as [\"DoS Vectors in Account Abstraction (AA) or Validation Generalization, a Case Study in Geth.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/dos-vectors-in-account-abstraction-aa-or-validation-generalization-a-case-study-in-geth/7937)\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan, all the way!\n\n[Onward [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=32)\n\n---\n\n*Kudos for reading to the end!

{"id": "9sJwIIoK8hFqckz6IBI9HwxX2r16g9KtpdY8SZhoDqk", "title": "All SaaS Should Be Tokenized", "body": "![see NFT auction below](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3195373-f5f3-4e66-b228-c435702c8a63.jpeg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nThe focus of this piece is to highlight the important business opportunities that social tokens and NFTs enable for services, software, and creators without 3rd party investment. We cover what tokenized access and subscriptions look like, ongoing experiments with the tech, as well as the numerous advantages over traditional SaaS. We purposefully don‚Äôt dive specifically into other important benefits that token economies can provide services willing to decentralize, such as governance, DAOs, etc. We mainly focus on the argument that all or most SaaS and creator businesses can and should tokenize subscriptions to their services.\n\nTokenized services are especially powerful for creators, allowing them to focus on providing a good service, finding customers who want the service (a market fit), and focusing on bringing that customer value. This is good for customers since they can pay less and have a better experience. It‚Äôs good for creators since they can sustain their businesses.\n\n### TradSaaS\n\nIf you watch movies, listen to music, or own a phone, you‚Äôre probably familiar with subscriptions. At least, your wallet is. Instead of selling you today, tomorrow, and next week, they only need to convince you once and the money keeps coming. It‚Äôs a steady and predictable stream of revenue. Because each customer is so valuable, they can focus more on keeping them than doing anything and everything to get more.\n\nThe current standard Software as a service subscription model consists of monthly/yearly recurring payments. It started in publishing, and now it is used in almost all industries, from businesses like New York Times, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Seamless, and Peloton.\n\nWhere does it end? Let‚Äôs divide subscriptions into two categories. The first one is services, like Netflix, Prime, Lootcrate, and Spotify, which kinda have to be subscriptions. Sure, you can buy music and movies individually but here, you get everything. Subscription boxes, which send you new things in the mail every month, are services because they‚Äôre more about fun and surprise than the stuff itself. And then there are products - things that could be sold, but here are rented.\n\n> *Access trumps ownership. That‚Äôs the mantra behind the ‚Äúsubscription economy‚Äù.* - [The Economist](https://applied.economist.com/articles/a-notion-worth-subscribing-to)\n\nWhat the Economist is referring to as ownership is the mere ownership of one copy of a product or service, as was common in Web1 SaaS (*Buy Microsoft Office '09 for a one-time payment of $100)*. Your business needs either capital or recurring revenue to exist. Subscriptions are the best recurring revenue model. Current SaaS subscriptions are broken. Tokens make subscriptions better for creators and customers\n\n### Enter Community Tokens and DAOs\n\nBy using tokens as a means of purchasing access to a service, consumers can participate in the potential upside of the demand of that service. They will hold a premium on what they're receiving because they get to earn from the other side of the success. If users have any inclination or any belief that other users will want to use this product, there will be an increase in demand for this product and therefore increasing demand for the token. They will put a premium on it.\n\nTakeaway: Use tokens to create a better subscription model for your business.\n\n### Tokenized Access\n\nTokenized access is the system of gating/limiting content, features, or whole platforms with tokens, requiring users to own/hold specific tokens or NFTs. Teams/creators then monetize by releasing/minting new tokens (inflation) to sell to new customers/speculators. In its full form, it‚Äôll feel like subscribing or going through a paywall. This can be used to gate anything and can be coupled with free and traditional subscription options.\n\n**If you held $10,000 in bitcoin for the last month, you paid $15/m to secure it.**\n\nYou didn't pay in subscription fees but rather in agreed-upon inflation. The circulating supply of BTC grew by 0.15% and your holdings' purchasing power was diluted as a result. This newly minted bitcoin was given to miners as block rewards and helped secure their holdings. Block rewards are a form of revenue for miners, and they‚Äôre critical to maintaining bitcoin.\n\nInflation-Based Revenue is not new but has been used by governments for generations now. For example, to increase revenue, the US government can, among other things, increase taxes (yearly 'subscription') or print money (inflation).\n\nWhat if we applied that same line of thinking to SaaS products: B2B, tools, newsletters, passion economy, etc.? Could token subscriptions be valuable to work on in their world?\n\nIn line with the transition from passion economy to ownership economy, [as beautifully broken down by Jesse Walden](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/), crypto emissions can be thought of as a consistent and stable revenue model for businesses and teams. Token minting is SaaS backward and powerful for users if structured correctly. This could be thought of as the natural next step for consumer software monetization. For example, Microsoft could hypothetically utilize it as their next business model for Microsoft Office:\n\n*(1995-2010) Buy Microsoft Office '09 for $100*\n\n*(2010-2020) Rent Microsoft Office Suite for $9.99 / month*\n\n*(2020-????) Own access to Microsoft Office Suite for holding 200 OFFICE tokens.*\n\n## Experiments\n\nSocial tokens have pioneered programmable access, with tools like Collab.Land and Mintgate enabling token-gated chat groups, newsletters, and articles. In Bryan Flynn‚Äôs *[The fractionalization of NFTs will lead to better social tokens](https://jammsession.mirror.xyz/-xYcfFRlhDdLDSUgRMTYJAaRJBs2VG4LP34DnOV84mI)*, Tokenized programmable access became popular in the summer of 2020 with a discord bot called Collab.Land which let any token community (ERC721 or ERC20) create their token-gated discords.\n\nSome examples of what tokenized access has gated:\n\n**1. Chat groups**\n\nThe first use case for tokenized access was token-gated chat groups, with FWB being the famous example. If you hold 55 Friends with Benefits (FWB) tokens, you can access the private discord that has some of the top creative talents in crypto. This has become quite popular among social tokens and has served as a strong mechanism for filtering for quality. For FWB specifically, participants need to apply and be approved in addition to holding tokens.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4c71b177-b30c-45d9-b1cb-a844ab667cd3.jpeg?height=932&width=1999)\n\n**2. Exclusive content**\n\nApps like Outpost allowed various communities to create token-gated newsletters. This can also be achieved with a mix of Mirror/Medium drafts that are token-gated with MintGate. When perfected, this model can be used to replace/disrupt software like Substack or Patreon. Brian Flynn, writer/leader of Jamm Session, talks about his move to token-gated content in his piece *[A Letter to Jamm Session Subscribers](https://jammsession.substack.com/p/a-letter-to-jamm-session-subscribers).*\n\n**3. Premium Products / Features**\n\nSome SaaS products have begun implementing token-gated access. In other words, users need to hold X amount of tokens to geet access to premium features. A great example of this is Astro Tools, which is displayed in the initial image of this article, gating certain features to their DeFi platform with their own ASTRO tokens. Holding 1,000 ASTRO gives you access to their unique block explorer with special filters. Holding 20,000 ASTRO gives you additional wallet tracking features.\n\n**4. Shared documents/canvas**\n\nThe Bored Apes Yacht Club NFT collection has gone viral over the last few weeks, with floor prices reaching ~4 ETH this week. On their website, they have a BAYC Bathroom, which is an open canvas, like a bar bathroom, where Ape holders can draw / paint. This is reminiscent of pixel walls but limited to Bored Apes only.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7442b68a-95e4-45d8-85be-a262b8682161.jpeg?height=598&width=1267)\n\n**5. Beta products**\n\nToken holders are usually a good representation of power users and loyal community members. This is why several projects have tokenized access to beta products to their token holdeers. We‚Äôve witnessed Yearn do this with some of their beta apps, and Zora experimented with this with their TestFlight app and a token to go with it. Similarly, only WRITE token holders can use Mirror.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8bbb51b0-fcd6-40ca-9283-7f5174e8e56b.jpeg?height=336&width=491)\n\n**6. Exclusive Events**\n\nAs more communities and networks begin to leverage token-gated access, we‚Äôve begun to witness physical events exclusively limited to token holders. A recent example of this was the FWB Miami party where only holders of 60 FWB tokens could get access to the [RSVP link](https://miami.fwb.help/rsvp).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/18d232e1-c8c8-4513-89a6-df52f2c03dba.jpeg?height=947&width=1563)\n\n**7. Unique NFTs**\n\nYou can imagine that NFTs can function as a sort of key or checkpoint that unlocks other NFTs. This is how the Golden State Warriors gated their most exclusive NFT: the Championship Banner. Holders needed all 6 Championship Ring NFTs in their wallet to access this. We‚Äôve seen other cool examples over the last year, like WhaleDAOs NFT museum gating access to a certain VIP room solely for Whale NFT holders.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4c65681b-9805-431f-a072-24b7132dd68f.jpeg?height=512&width=1097)\n\n### Economic Alignment\n\nMany of us are used to getting our favorite products, services, and content for free, usually monetized by ads. Web3 business models are ‚Äòbetter than free‚Äô, allowing consumers to invest by consuming and potentially earning from being early. Not only is this empowering for users, it comes with additional benefits. First, users are incentivized to become evangelists of the project, spreading it to their friends and family to boost demand for access. Second, there is a strong first-mover advantage, which should incentivize users to join early and establish some FOMO.\n\n### Composability\n\nIt‚Äôs also extremely composable meaning you could gate w multiple tokens and nfts at once easily; ‚Äúneed platinum access (own 10 WRITE, 100 ETH, 3 zNFTs or a crypto punk) to use this feature‚Äù. Imagine if they let RAC holders RSVP because they think it‚Äôs a cool community or collaborated on the party. They can do that despite RAC using Zora to mint and FWB minting on Roll. Let‚Äôs see Eventbrite and Facebook pull that off. There is also a great advantage here in terms of interoperability and customer targeting. One of the only times people used crypto this whole week in Miami was the token-gated FWB party, where RSVPing required holding FWB. Most if not all of those people didn't buy tokens at this rsvp page for this party. They've had them and their ownership of tokens represents membership over time: no payment, no gas, no email/data trail beyond eth address.\n\n### Liquidity\n\nIn traditional SaaS, users would be locked into a product/service for a set amount of time. But with tokenized services, consumers can liquidate, or sell their tokens, when they‚Äôre finished using the service. Additionally, they will be able to subscribe just for the amount of time that they‚Äôd like to, rather than commit forever.\n\n### Versatility\n\nTokens can serve multiple purposes. This is similar to how Amazon Prime gives subscribers access to faster delivery AND a suite of movies/shows ready for streaming. While Amazon Prime Music might be a failing product of its own, it increases demand and enhances utility that comes from being an Amazon Prime member.\n\nMany argue that there are serious issues with basing a token economic model on gated access, as consumers will purchase the tokens whenever they wish to access, rather than hold the token. Additionally, they may find themselves having to change their token supply to respond to market forces (the price of token going up or the number of tokens needed to access going down). To mediate this, we propose a lockup NFT model that can achieve long-term alignment between consumers and service providers.\n\nToken Emissions are the natural next step for SaaS because of the important consumer incentives, evangelism, and upside. Compared to existing models, it‚Äôs a whole lot less paying. Imagine claiming a concert NFT once and now having access to an artist‚Äôs Patreon forever, despite the concert being set up by completely different companies with no ties to Patreon.\n\n## Angel audiences\n\nImagine you‚Äôre in a five-year-long fishing competition with one of the best fishermen alive. You start with nothing but a hook and a small wooden raft, while he already has a nice rowboat, a bucket of baitfish, a rod, and some cash. Buying new supplies requires cash, which can only be earned by selling fish. Catching more and bigger fish requires better supplies. Play this out five years and guess who has managed to get a huge motorboat and land the blue marlin?\n\nThis is the competition new creators enter every day on the internet.\n\nZero marginal cost of distribution means that a single creator can serve endless fans without incurring major operational costs that make them charge more for the service. I can get a tennis lesson from one of the best players on tour, attend a live concert from a grammy-winning artist, and learn how to filet a halibut from a Michelin starred chef ‚Äî¬†all online, for next to nothing.\n\nIf the main challenge with building the creator middle class is helping creators establish initial traction, which systems would we need to put in place to make that possible? What existing models from other areas can we use for inspiration?\n\nIn startup land, angel investors fund projects at their very initial and riskiest steps. Although some do it to great profit, the term ‚Äúangel‚Äù comes from the idea that the capital they provide is a godsend to entrepreneurs who would otherwise be too early to get investment from banks or have more established means. They are often former entrepreneurs themselves, interested in part just for the fun of it.\n\nCreators also need investment at very early moments before they find true content <> audience fit, but even just extending the analogy it‚Äôs clear that their angels will look different. If a startup‚Äôs angels are successful CEOs, a creator‚Äôs angels would be other successful creators.\n\nAnother fairly obvious but critically important difference between creators is that most creators have neither the desire nor capability to establish LLCs, issue shares, or otherwise build some way for people to share in the potential upside of their growth. A key reason for that is that most creators ‚Äî¬†even successful ones ‚Äî¬†won‚Äôt ever be so big that it warrants the overhead of setting up traditional shareholder-type structures.\n\nTokenized subscription could create an angel audience of other creators, investing in something very early and very risky with the dream of a potential upside but also just for the fun of it. We see this already with so much of what‚Äôs happening with Web3. There are pure speculators but that alone would be nowhere near enough to spin the wheel as fast as it is turning. Many people are making statements with their wallets about their values and the future they want to see, and the chances of a return just sweeten the deal.\n\n### Business Model\n\nTo better understand this model, let‚Äôs build standard revenue projections that one would expect from traditional SaaS.\n\nLet‚Äôs say you‚Äôre selling a new SaaS product (let‚Äôs call it ‚ÄúSaasy‚Äù for fun) and expect ~1000 subscribers to be willing to pay $5 for the service in monthly subscription fees. But you need >$10k/month to survive. In the past, your only options in this situation would be to raise venture capital. But if your early supporters are ‚Äòtrue fans‚Äô, you now have an alternative option. Instead of subscription fees, you tokenize access to that service, requiring subscribers to hold $100 in SAAS tokens to access. You then mint and sell 9% of new tokens a month.\n\nBelow is a graph outlining 6 months of this token-gated business‚Äô gross revenues. Several assumptions were made, such as a higher churn rate than usual (20%), because users can liquidate at any moment rather than wait until the end of the month, an 8% MoM growth in subscribers.\n\nInstead of calculating Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) as subscriptions * product price, here we multiply emissions by token price. The Churn Rate in this model is essentially the liquidation rate: existing users who sold because they get no more utility from the product.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/29798d71-a936-43a1-9093-a23d9f04bf04.jpeg?height=840&width=1350)\n\nIf the token price stays the same, the consumer can expect to pay/lose $27 in 6 months. **But, if your early subscribers think there‚Äôs at least a 20% chance you‚Äôll gain 1000 net new subscribers in 6 months, this increases their expected return, so they‚Äôll be willing to hold $100 worth of tokens, allowing you to earn $8 per user.**\n\nFor simplicity‚Äôs sake, we left out any speculating/trading, token buy-backs/burns, lock-ups/pools, or the various other tokenomics mechanisms that could be implemented here.\n\n### The Creator middle class\n\nRight now in the creator space, the closest thing to this model is in the upfront advances that more and more big platforms are paying creators to join and produce content. Substack, Clubhouse, Snapchat, Facebook, YouTube, and others all pay cash advances to creators in the hopes that they then generate even more revenue for the platform. So far, it makes sense that those platforms have benefited disproportionately from creator content and have remarkably deep pockets as a result. They can spread the risk of failure across a huge number of creators and offer cash upfront that creators couldn‚Äôt dream of otherwise. Especially for less established creators, that upfront cash is the only way they can dive in and build traction.\n\nWeb3 is pushing from several angles to make creators less dependent on platforms, and expanding the way creators can generate upfront financing would be a key way to do that. By all accounts, it seems that the primary revenue model for the next wave of creators is freemium, and tokenized subscriptions fit neatly into that frame.\n\nNo doubt there are many unanswered questions. The technology to enable this new model still has a way to go and, for it to be useful for most creators, it will have to become a whole lot less ‚Äúcrypto-y.‚Äù Web3 is growing fast, but most creators and consumers just want to create and consume content without having to dive too far down the rabbit hole. Unless the crypto can be hidden behind the surface, it seems likely that more traditional non-token access models will need to live in parallel for creators to maximize their revenue.\n\nThe building blocks are all in place for angel audiences and tokenized subscriptions, and the potential implications are huge. It won‚Äôt be for everyone or every creator, but even if incentivizing early financing could increase creator innovation by 1%, the compounding dividends overtime for all of us would be astronomical; a bigger creator middle class, less dependent on huge platforms, and more connected to the audience that can help them grow.\n\n### Web3 Freemium\n\nMembership models are not and will not have to be binary ‚Äì free or gated, fees or tokens ‚Äì the answer is probably both or all. I think if there‚Äôs a Slack free, Slack teams, Slack pro, and Slack partners and partners need tokens but get additional advantages/features/sales/etc. people will do that and bet that there will be a demand for that tier in the future.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUltimately, tokenized software and services will enable new economics and incentives for creators and small businesses. This can be paired with free or traditional subscription fees to empower super users/fans without adding friction. This is good for customers since they can pay less and have a better experience. It‚Äôs good for creators since they can sustain their businesses. It‚Äôs also good for investors since they don‚Äôt need to give up equity and can have a real stake in the success of that business.\n\n[Token #3749](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3749&auctionId=0x1516edb282ab5a8c1e87892f07df08a6378434fb1d3b62d382d9dc818bc4168d)\n\n### If you'd like to support without bidding on the NFT, send us a tip here!

{"id": "ri_6lTrmfnUDon3JR40a-g9Ajip7SjgCNdRnWwMe5ks", "title": "Welcome to the Creator DAO Revolution", "body": "As we move from Web2 to Web3, we‚Äôll see a shift toward a more creator-centric economy. In this ecosystem, creators will no longer sit at the bottom of the totem pole picking up scraps leftover by corporate giants but will instead be able to earn in full and instantaneously for their work. \n\nThe convergence of the creator economy and DAOs is where the magic happens. The decentralized, non-hierarchical structure of DAOs serves as a turbo boost to propel the creator economy (which is mostly theoretical right now) into reality.\n\n## The problem with the current (lack of) creator economy\n\nAfter I quit my job as an attorney to travel the world in 2017, I became a travel blogger and Instagram influencer to pay the bills while not having a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job. I got a nice camera, leveled up my photography skills, spent hours each day trying to build my social media following, and learned the latest marketing strategies for building an online following.\n\nI was creating content regularly, posting daily on social media and multiple times per week on my blog. I grew my following to over 15,000 monthly views on my blog and 20,000 Instagram followers, but it wasn‚Äôt enough. There were other travel bloggers and Instagram influencers with larger followings, and I wasn‚Äôt able to secure the largest brand deals because I didn‚Äôt have the largest following.\n\nDespite the struggle to monetize my content, I had a loyal and active audience. I received messages regularly from inspired fans and noticed a group of followers commenting on all of my posts.\n\nSo why did I have to rely on Instagram and other centralized platforms to decide whether my content was valuable when I already received validation that it is from my audience?\n\n## The creator economy of Web3\n\nThe creator economy of Web3 will revolutionize the way artists, musicians, and content creators have been monetizing their work for decades. Rather than relying on centralized platforms to pay them a fraction of what consumers are willing to pay, creators will get paid directly by their fans. That means creators will receive the full amount that consumers are willing to pay because intermediaries will no longer exist to take a cut of their profits.\n\nThis doesn‚Äôt mean that all of a sudden, creators will all become millionaires. On the contrary, competition will only become stiffer as more people discover the freedom that comes with being a creator. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important for creators to not only have opportunities to create for themselves and for their followers but also for decentralized projects and protocols that have larger and more reliable funding engines.\n\n## Creator economy, meet DAOs\n\nThis is where DAOs come in. A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a group of people who have a common mission and are governed by rules coded into a smart contract on the blockchain that all members of the DAO agree to. The founding members of a DAO decide on a set of rules to code into the smart contract that will govern the DAO, and anyone who joins the DAO after that agrees to abide by that set of rules. \n\nEach DAO is formed with a specific mission in mind, and that mission can vary widely. A DAO can be set up to fund proposals ([Moloch DAO](https://twitter.com/MolochDAO)), buy NFTs ([pleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO)), support communities ([Panvala](https://twitter.com/PanvalaHQ)), or just for fun ([pizzaDAO](https://twitter.com/pizza_dao)).\n\nOne type of DAO that hasn‚Äôt made a noticeable impact yet is the creator DAO. The intersection of the creator economy and DAOs has always felt natural and inevitable. DAOs democratize access to resources, pulling them away from the top of hierarchical structures and redistributing them amongst creators. Instead of the traditional model of \n\n> Stack resume with top credentials ‚Üí Get a job/income ‚Üí Contribute \n\nwhere most people can‚Äôt make it past the first step, DAOs allow creators to at least have some skin in the game by shifting the model to\n\n> Contribute ‚Üí Make money ‚Üí Contribute more ‚Üí Make more money\n\nCompetition amongst creators will remain strong, but this model at least gives creators an opportunity to compete - not just amongst themselves but against larger, more established entities. Creators will find more opportunities to work on interesting projects that were traditionally outsourced to agencies or built in house with full time staff. \n\n## Renaissance Creator DAO\n\nThis shared mission to help Web2 creators make money in Web3 is what brought [Alex Yao](https://twitter.com/TheAlexYao) and I together during our time in the Gitcoin [KERNEL](https://twitter.com/KERNEL0x) fellowship. Together with a group of several others and led by Alex, we formed Renaissance Creator DAO, a community for content creators to learn about creating content for Web3 projects and, in turn, earn money (crypto) for their contributions.\n\nWe believe having a community like Renaissance DAO is important because each creator has a unique voice that will bring new audiences and perspectives to Web3. It also enables creators to work together, which allows them to do more than they could individually - and have more fun doing it.\n\nOur goal is to help solve for some of the common problems creators face in today‚Äôs economy, including:\n\n- The desire to do what they love but the inability to monetize their work\n- The procurement of a dedicated following but the inability to monetize that following\n- The need for freedom but the inability to earn a consistent income\n\nAs a member of Renaissance DAO, you will:\n\n- Learn how to create content in Web3\n- Match with Web3 projects and protocols to collaborate on paid work\n- Be part of a community of other Web3 creators\n- Earn tokens in proportion to the amount of content you create\n- Get access to exclusive community-only talks and events\n\nI‚Äôm excited to share more details about what we‚Äôve been working on with you shortly, and we‚Äôre launching a formal cohort-based application process soon, but in the meantime, feel free to tweet any questions you have to me at [@ddwchen](twitter.com/ddwchen). \n", "timestamp": 1625607573, "digest": "Y19OlShAGp8nf6t_Rngj9SuISGBIWfzHfa7j2_dWdF8", "contributor": "0xcEd09CCFc82b091195bdE04E6Cd65374518E7b95"}
{"id": "Q66guQDTugUSWCvJH8KjTrxKsBID9To17VWoQohDgXk", "title": "Is This Public? (or...Why I‚Äôm leaving TradFi for Crypto) ", "body": "\n### It‚Äôs All Stocks\nA portfolio manager I used to work with once remarked that if you stay in finance for long enough, you begin to see everything as a stock. When I first heard this, as an intern at an investment firm in 2017, it seemed like one of those Wall Street neologisms that sound true, but don‚Äôt **feel** true until you‚Äôve lived them firsthand (other neologisms that fall under this category: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt short on valuation‚Äù, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt short on competition‚Äù, and my personal favorite: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try to predict the future. Try to describe the present‚Äù). This particular piece of wisdom was palpable almost immediately: in August of 2017, I drove to the Hamptons with some friends and realized that the PM who said that everything looked like a stock had a long or short position in half of the retailers occupying the strip malls along the Southhampton Bypass. In finance, even a trip to the beach is a quest for alpha. \n\nThe 2017 internship turned into a job offer, which turned into a full time position in 2018 after I graduated from college. I felt luckier than a lot of my peers who spent senior year either cramming for McKinsey case studies or lamenting because they doubted they had the quantitative skills to even attempt one. Before the summer of 2017, I probably would‚Äôve put myself in the latter camp: a history major who only did theater, film, and journalism in college. But the internship taught me that you can learn any quantitative skill on the job, by sheer force of attrition. Someone will ask you for the diluted share count of an upcoming IPO, or to input a company‚Äôs EBITDA into an earnings model (which raises other questions, like what is depreciation and amortization, and how do you use Excel?), or might say to you ‚Äúyes, gross margins are 50% ***right now***, but what happens when GMs reach 65%, and S&M spend falls to 30% of revenue, and Trump manages to pass corporate tax cuts? How much are they earning ***then***?‚Äù Early on in my internship, it might take me an hour to figure out what question I was even being asked, and another few hours to answer it. But over time -- through attrition -- the concepts fall into place. And then you begin to start seeing everything as a stock. \n\nIn the initial phase, ‚Äúseeing stocks'' might just mean the sudden realization that the vast majority of items and systems you interact with on a daily basis are actually public companies. This understanding gets augmented even further when the above concepts (diluted shares, EBITDA, tax cuts) get layered in, and you begin to think of companies as their own little organisms: sentient income statements with hopes and dreams that evolve with every quarter. Then, the companies begin to talk to each other: you have a laser component company over here, and a global OEM powerhouse over there, and a Chinese phone manufacturer somewhere else, and a smorgasbord of social camera apps, and with all of that information you might ask yourself something like: where is the 3D imaging industry heading? If you were to peer inside the brain of a truly great portfolio manager it would look a bit like a timelapse of a rapidly industrializing metropolis. A single question about the destiny of 3D imaging would be the launching pad for a mental model around the P+L of dozens of companies, implications for global supply chains, and assumptions around how consumer behavior will continue to evolve. Change one input, and the other variables will instantly recalibrate. \n\nThe most exciting thing about investing (or learning something new in general) are the moments where your own brain surprises you. A few weeks into the internship, I pitched my first stock. A couple days later, I was writing up earnings calls. Even though I definitely didn‚Äôt understand everything I was hearing, I realized that writing was a great way to interrogate where the gaps in my knowledge actually were: moments where the logic didn‚Äôt compute or my ideas failed to flow seamlessly into the next were clearly places where I needed to do more research. In a short amount of time, no one needs to ask you ‚ÄúWhat happens when GMs reach 65%?‚Äù because the question automatically populates itself in your brain (and then you want to know what happens when gross margins reach 70%, 80% and 85%), and you can pipe over to Excel, change some cells, and figure out the answer. The truly great moments are when you preempt a question even before the smart people you work for ask it.  \n\nIn this way, seeing things as stocks becomes its own network effect: everyone in the in-group is inculcated with a similar (though -- it should be emphasized -- not identical) set of priorities and platonic ideals to seek out in the investment process. In doing this, you learn to think not only on behalf of yourself, but on behalf of other investors, and the meta-game is the process of trying to parse the blind spots of the players around you. Yes, this can result in a lot of group-think (and sometimes compounds into a bubble) but the combination of being right, being wrong, being wrong about others being right, and being right about others being wrong (and vice versa) is a kind of palliative against things getting too out of hand. Generally, the people who make the most amount of money are optimists with a streak of paranoia: PMs whose heads are in the clouds, with eyes that glance constantly over their shoulders. \n\nToward the end of the summer, I knew I wanted a job offer. The desire went beyond my aversion to McKinsey case studies (after what I‚Äôd learned through attrition, I had more confidence in my ability to tackle one) and had more to do with the fact that I loved the job. I began to think of it as a privatized form of journalism or history scholarship: you speak to experts, read primary and secondary research, scrutinize transcripts, and try to form a narrative that never existed before (with the added component, of course, of being sensitive to what other investors are thinking). So when I got an offer, near the end of August, I accepted immediately on the spot. \n\nBut now onto other things that were happening around the same time. \n\n### You Either Grok It Or You Don‚Äôt\nThe period of 2017-2018 also happened to coincide with the third wave of crypto hype -- the runup of Bitcoin from $1,500 to $19,000, and Ethereum to $200 to $1,200 (and back down again). I wish I could say that the combination of a job offer, a light course load, and the relative abandon of senior year created the ideal environment for me to start picking up white papers and getting into crypto. But quite the opposite: getting TradFi-pilled made me dubious of anything that threatened to disrupt the cushy world I had just entered. During senior year, I‚Äôd sometimes visit my colleagues at the office, where we‚Äôd spot the occasional appearance of an ICO promoter or Winklevoss twin on the CNBC-designated flatscreen TV in our trading room. We‚Äôd gaze in silent, baffled horror, like we were observing a natural disaster in a foreign country. \n\nWhen my colleagues and I did discuss crypto, it was mostly in an orthogonal (and subtly pessimistic) way: what would happen to the price of AMD and Nvidia stock when crypto ultimately crashed and demand for GPUs would plummet? Should we be shorting the public companies which were opportunistically appending ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù to their name and business plans, but clearly had no prior bonafides in crypto (in retrospect, probably yes). Even among the TradFi people who bought Bitcoin and Ethereum, there was a degree of calculating opportunism -- the bubble would pop eventually, and the key was to sell before the crowd. \n\nWe didn‚Äôt grok. \n\nBut crypto wasn‚Äôt completely alien to me either. In June of 2017, right around the time I started my internship, I began getting a Ethereum-focused newsletter from my friend [Teo](https://twitter.com/teo_leibowitz) (who now works at Uniswap). I can‚Äôt recall exactly how I ended up on his mailing list -- I must‚Äôve run into him on Columbia‚Äôs campus or at a nearby bar and expressed interest, but anyway, I do know that I got the first issue, sent out on Saturday, Jun 24, 2017 at 1:52 PM. The subject header: *Crypto Chat #1: Flash Crash, Visa, China, ICOs*. It began:\n\n> *Hello - hope this finds you well.*\n> *As I've become more and more involved in discussions around Ethereum (ETH) in past months, several of you have mentioned interest in some kind of regular newsletter sharing a roundup of thoughts/news, so here goes - please find attached.*\n\nWithin the newsletter was a breathtaking roundup of recent crypto news: the [GDAX flash crash](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/22/ethereum-price-crash-10-cents-gdax-exchange-after-multimillion-dollar-trade.html#:~:text=Ethereum%20briefly%20suffered%20a%20flash,The%20cryptocurrency%20later%20rebounded.), a Visa job posting for Ethereum developers, [the staggering 65 million dollar Status ICO](https://www.coindesk.com/ico-blues-status-raises-58-million-leaves-buyers-waiting). Recall, I was still learning how exactly an IPO works (plus how to judge and value one), so the new mechanics of the crypto economy were a bit too much for me to wrap my head around.  I opened Teo‚Äôs newsletters most weeks (they arrived at a steady near-weekly pace until October of 2018), but at best I skimmed them and at worst I raised my eyebrows and said to myself dubiously ‚Äúwell that shit‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù\n\nI had other opportunities to grok, and flubbed those too. Fall semester of senior year I went on a few dates with a Turkish grad student with a mining rig set up in his Morningside Heights apartment. The way he talked about Bitcoin and Ethereum was completely different from how I heard the media describe what was going on. He came from a country with a debased currency, an untrustworthy government, and ungreased payment rails. He had grown up on the internet, and foresaw an interlinked, nationless society governed by the will of networked users and executed by code. The way he talked about it sounded exciting -- the kind of thing some of my SaaS-happy colleagues would‚Äôve been into. The only problem was that...well the place I‚Äôd just accepted a job offer from only invested in enterprises that were public companies. Bitcoin and Ethereum were just ideas, and their most prominent manifestations were failed ICOs that were beginning to attract the wrath of the SEC. \n\nBy the time I graduated in May 2018, both Bitcoin and Ethereum had fallen below the high prices that attracted snarky clickbait pieces from the New York Times. Which meant that I pretty much stopped wondering about cryptocurrency and what all the hype was about. And then I stepped into full-time TradFi, which is an animal of its own. \n\n### The Social Network\nOne thing I was never told about Wall Street is that it‚Äôs one giant social network. From the outside it looks like numbers, lines, and glittering abstraction, but from the inside it‚Äôs essentially a high school cafeteria. Reputations are brokered and leveraged for allocations in an IPO, lavish, well-attended lunches are sponsored by investment banks, and the myth of the anonymous whale are overblown: your traders can call up pretty much any other desk in the industry and figure out who just made a block trade in a stock you‚Äôre jockeying to buy. You will attend dinners, and have the opportunity to rub shoulders with management teams. Names of prolific or disgraced traders who pop up in Bloomberg and the Financial Times are usually one degree of separation away. No one is incognito, even if the charts make it look that way. \n\nThis is a digression, but a private theory I have about the wave of SPACs in 2020 is that they had less to do with macroeconomic trends (COVID, low interest rates) or microeconomic trends (investment banks who wanted to earn a nice fee) than they did with the simple compulsion to sustain the social network. People were bored at home, and wanted to feel important. So they all did SPACs. \n\nStock investors aren‚Äôt even the most aggressively social creatures; our bond-trading counterparts are even more outgoing. About a year into my job, in April of 2019, I looked at the IPO of TradeWeb, a digital trading network for fixed-income assets. I was shocked to discover that just 20% of bonds, treasuries, swaps, and derivatives are traded electronically. The remaining 80% are done on the phone, over fax, or during lunch and golf. This is partially due to the fact that many fixed income assets have shallow liquidity pools or trade infrequently. But there‚Äôs another reason too: the social network keeps people locked into the old way of doing things. \n\nAnother thing you begin to notice as a stock investor is that some of the companies you‚Äôre evaluating -- the VC-annointed, so-called disruptors who are changing the world and giving the incumbents a million reasons to be fearful at night -- are not actually that innovative. They‚Äôve just figured out one bit of arbitrage (better advertising, better branding, more money from VCs, clever financial engineering) to realize staggering growth, with punt-the-proverbial-can-down-the-road promises about future profitability. \n\nThis is especially true in the fintech space, where you might see, for example, a digital lender sell off consolidated loans in the form a variable interest entity, thus sacrificing the cash flows from those loans--and thus, the long-term upside (and so, the very ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù digital lender will be stuck losing money until the FDIC throws it a bone and lets it get a banking license...but by then the marketing dollars will have dried up so the growth will have slowed, and the earnings multiple will compress). Or you might see other forms of arbitrage, like an insure-tech company that gets its customer foothold in low-competition fields like renter‚Äôs insurance...but is forced to fight against high churn and low retention (which is why there‚Äôs so little competition in those fields -- you probably don‚Äôt want that customer to begin with). Or a home iBuyer that promises faster selling times...all in exchange for commission fees that are roughly double the industry average (and in a home-buying environment where homes sell at a staggering velocity without the need for an iBuyer to begin with). Just fun, late-stage growth stuff. \n\nNow to be clear, I‚Äôm not saying that new public companies aren‚Äôt doing exciting and innovative things -- there are plenty of companies in biotechnology, data warehousing, web security, eCommerce, and retail that are delighting their customers and doing wildly great things. And even those fintechs have better customer service, and sometimes better APYs and lending rates than their more established rivals. But at the end of the day, everyone is subservient to the same master business model, and a lot of things that look like real change are just shiny skin-grafts atop the old way of doing things.  \n\nUnderstanding this was one part of why finance began to feel a little ridiculous to me. And the understanding was by no means instantaneous; it took me a little over a year and a half before I started recognizing the skin-graft business model. But once you see it, you can‚Äôt unsee it: you‚Äôll look deep in the unconsolidated section of a company‚Äôs balance sheet, or maybe just glance at the sales and marketing expenses (if this product is really better, why do they need to spend 90% of revenue on S+M?) and begin to question whether what you‚Äôre being pitched is actually all that world-changing, or if you‚Äôve just been seduced by the accoutrements of Wall Street life (nice lunches, smooth-talking management teams, brassy salespeople etc.). Of course, there are plenty of people who see all of this and love Wall Street for other reasons: the constant challenge and sense that you‚Äôre learning something every moment, being surrounded by brilliant people, the game of it all, and yes, the money. And of course, I enjoyed all of this...but I still couldn‚Äôt get beyond the skin-grafting.   \n\nAt the beginning of 2020, I had a number of ideas that I wanted to try after TradFi. Most of the things on my list involved more creativity than being a stock analyst: I was weighing the idea of either returning to my film roots and working in production, or doing a bunch of coding bootcamps and trying to work in game design. I played a ton of games as a kid (Maplestory, The Sims, Runescape, and Civilization were some of my favorites), and my job had given me a fresh pair of eyes through which to view the various incentives and nuances at play when you orient people around mercenary goals. Between my love for devising narratives and the quantitative bent I‚Äôd picked up over the past few years, I thought that it might be worth trying out game development. In the time since graduation, I‚Äôd taught myself some coding basics but never sat down to undergo the requisite brain-attrition necessary to actually be proficient. Anyway, at the beginning of 2020, I had tentative plans to leave my job by the summer of 2020 -- exactly three years since the start of my 2017 internship -- and try something new. \n\nAnd then a pandemic happened.\n\n### It‚Äôs All A Game \nSo, March 2020. COVID-19 is officially a national crisis. In the realm of finance, the Dow plunged 26%, the Vix spiked all the way up to 83, and in a panic I withdrew 50% of my stock portfolio from the market. On March 16th, 2020 my entire team called in for our first work-from-home 9am call, and spent about half the time speculating about when New York would reach herd immunity and the other half discussing what stocks we should buy when the pandemic ended (perhaps a testament to our enduring optimism). Stocks continued to plummet through the end of March, and then began their staggering, unprecedented recovery (thank you, Federal Reserve).\n\nUnbeknownst to me, similar stress tests were unfolding in crypto: Bitcoin fell 50%, and the crash of Ethereum set off a chain reaction of pricing oracle lags, surging gas prices, [decentralized exchange liquidations](https://medium.com/aave/crypto-black-thursday-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-7f2acebf2b83), and [the Maker debt auction](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/agenda-discussion-scientific-governance-and-risk-tuesday-march-17-9am-pst-4-00-pm-utc/1630/7) (on the bright side, Hayden Adams popped onto Twitter [to chirpily inform people](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1238457224214786048) that Uniswap achieved a then-record amount of volume). Months later, when I finally started seriously getting into crypto (and to be honest, specifically Ethereum), I spent hours reading Medium posts, Twitter threads, and forums, unearthing lore across the ecosystem, and reliving not only the drama of March 2020, but sagas from the past decade. This is another instance where having majored in history really helped me: it‚Äôs just that my sources expanded beyond library archives and into stuff like blogs, DAO forums, Discord servers, and Etherscan transactions. \n\nAnyway, back to Spring 2020. If Wall Street felt like a game before, this sense got further compounded when the sexiness and thrill of conferences and hand-shaking were stripped away, and all we were left with were Bloomberg terminal windows and Zoom meetings. In other words, the skin-graft of Wall Street itself was lifted. While the actual content of work was certainly getting more interesting -- markets and the narratives that animated them were being rewritten on a daily basis --- the substance of everyday life was, perhaps unsurprisingly, quite banal. Everything was unfolding on the interface-layer, on the screen, like a videogame. \n\nI still remember why and when I started reading about crypto again. Every Sunday, I‚Äôd send out an email to my colleagues with a roundup of news related to stocks and trade ideas we‚Äôve been discussing. On May 31st, 2020, I included [a link to a New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/business/media/new-model-celebrity.html) about Cameo, Patreon, and Substack -- one of the first mainstream pieces I‚Äôd read codifying the ‚Äúcreator economy‚Äù as a real force in the market. The Times also linked to a bunch of articles -- including [a few](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/) [by Li Jin](https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/), which brought me to the a16z website, which (after the relentless hyperlink-clicking that I tend to do) [landed me on a podcast](https://a16z.com/2020/05/26/a16z-podcast-new-fan-engagement-models-for-athletes-and-influencers/) with Jeff Jordan, Jesse Walden, Zoran Basich and the NBA player Spencer Dinwiddie. Spencer, a point guard with the Brooklyn Nets, was planning on tokenizing a portion of his three-year contract with the team, in an effort to receive more of his income upfront. What struck me about the podcast was the way Spencer articulated crypto as a unique enabler of an internet of value -- a way to create liquidity in an idiosyncratic pool of assets underpinned both by monetary worth and personal affinity. For the first time, crypto started to make sense, despite his occasional drops of industry lingo (Eth2, Polkadot, Tezos) that I still wasn‚Äôt totally familiar with. \n\nFrom the podcast, I clicked on [Jesse Walden‚Äôs](https://a16z.com/author/jesse-walden/) name, which led me to his author page where I landed on his (then) most recent article: [‚ÄúCrypto‚Äôs Business Model is Familiar. What Isn‚Äôt is Who Benefits.‚Äù](https://a16z.com/2020/04/08/crypto-network-effects/) This piece was another crucial unlock for me. In it, Jesse described a system I was much more familiar with: network effects. But Jesse wasn‚Äôt just talking about the networked models I had grown familiar with as a stock analyst (Uber, Facebook/Instagram, Twilio, Wall Street life itself, etc.), but actually drawing analogies between Web 2.0 companies and their crypto counterparts. I hadn‚Äôt yet heard of Compound or Uniswap, but I knew about LendingClub and Coinbase, and what Jesse was describing seemed to be a far fairer model for organizing a business and aligning incentives. As Jesse writes in the piece: ‚Äú[t]he principal innovation of crypto networks is their ability to grow network effects by enabling users to share in the value they create.‚Äù \n\nTo those already in the crypto space, this might seem like the most obvious observation in the world. ***Of course*** web3 protocols need users, and of course those users are attracted to networks with the deepest liquidity pools and most attractive incentives. But for someone who, up until that point, didn‚Äôt really grasp that actual businesses were being built on top of decentralized blockchains like Ethereum, this was an absolute revelation. The way I‚Äôd seen crypto written about by mainstream media tended to focus on cryptocurrencies as assets and investments -- but Jesse‚Äôs piece went a layer deeper and looked at crypto at the layer of ERC-20 tokens and business models. \n\nThat was a major turning point for me. Starting in June 2020, I began to follow the space a bit more closely. I began checking Coindesk and other crypto-focused news sites, and tracked the wave of token drops and liquidity-mining incentives that were picking up momentum. Admittedly, the significance of DeFi Summer ([the launch of the Compound](https://www.coindesk.com/compounds-comp-token-price-doubles-amid-defi-mania) and [Balancer](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-platform-balancer-bal-token-distribution-compound-comp) tokens, rampant yield farming, and [TVL reaching nearly $8 billion by the end of August](https://news.bitcoin.com/total-value-locked-in-defi-jumped-83-in-august-8-billion-in-assets-held/)) was actually a little lost on me. I assumed that everything that was going on was simply a continuation from the 2017-2018 hype cycle, rather than (as it now seems) a genuine shift forward in the energy and momentum of the industry. Still, I felt like things were different than they were two years prior. By the time the UNI token dropped in September 2020, I was beginning to develop a suspicion that tokens might one day shift the nature of traditional capital markets as well. \n\nIf users are given tokens, early investors are offered liquidity faster, and outsiders are given the opportunity to buy-in, is there a future where the need for traditional capital markets is reduced or rendered obsolete completely? Clearly, we‚Äôre still in a very early phase of this (and a large number of tokens dropped today have nebulous utility), but it does seem possible that with everything shifting upstream in the realm of finance (DeFi, token drops, faster and more-efficient asset trading), everything downstream will begin to adjust as well. The model of Uniswap loomed in my head when the Coinbase S1 dropped in February of this year. A decentralized exchange is running head-to-head in daily volume and revenue with a centralized leviathan valued at several magnitudes more -- and that leviathan has over a thousand employees, and likely lower margins (note: this should not be read as a knock against Coinbase which has a much more diverse business: an institutional segment, [a nascent debit card](https://www.coinbase.com/card) and [high-yield interest account](https://www.coinbase.com/lend), a much larger compliance/legal team, an investing arm, a strategic affiliation with USDC, a much more diverse balance sheet, etc...but still, the rise of Uniswap is truly staggering). It raises the question: how many more industries can crypto disrupt, when decentralized protocols replace employees and overhead costs, and value can instead be shared with users and stakeholders? \n\nBut I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself. In October of 2020, my friend [Nikita](https://twitter.com/singareddynm) invited me and a bunch of mutual friends to spend the month in a house in Maine. While there, I met [Reggie](https://twitter.com/HipCityReg), who was getting even deeper into crypto than I was. I had only been reading the articles and token drop announcements -- Reggie was investing, reading white papers, swapping tokens, yield farming, and just generally ***living*** in it (in addition to all of that, he‚Äôs also the CEO of an avatar social network company called Eternal). Anyway, the trip was the extra push I needed to begin seriously thinking about leaving my current job (I‚Äôd put that plan on temporary hiatus because of the pandemic). I was surrounded by people in various stages of mid-20‚Äôs self-discovery: everyone was either accepting a new position, about to quit a job, applying to grad school, launching an angel fund, raising money for a startup, working in VC, [or working](https://twitter.com/_TamaraWinter) [for Stripe](https://twitter.com/orbuch). As a stock analyst I didn‚Äôt quite feel like a vampire squid, but I did feel a little like a barnacle -- hanging on the outer rim of life but not really participating in it substantially. The trip truly changed my life in a lot of ways -- I met people who loved their work, were optimistic about tech, and felt a clear sense of responsibility about the direction of the industry. \n\nWhen I got back from the trip, I started really diving into crypto. I read the Ethereum White Paper for the first time (I know, I know, it took me awhile!). I discovered MEV; in fact, when I read the paper [‚ÄúFlash Boys 2.0: Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and Consensus Instability in Decentralized Exchanges\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf), it was the first time I felt like I really understood how smart contracts work and orders are processed on the blockchain (what that paper does really well is highlight how the Ethereum network functions by exposing points of arbitrage). I started doing research and buying currencies and tokens -- trying to assess their businesses the way I evaluate a stock (once you start seeing things as stocks, anything is up for fair valuation). I [discovered NFTs that I love](https://twitter.com/VirtualElena/status/1389377447402033155), and met people like [Toby Shorin](https://twitter.com/tobyshorin) and [John Palmer](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer) who had been doing work in the industry for a few years. \n\nIn late January, I was still at the firm, but had already told my boss I was starting to look for new positions. I was already quietly buzzing with excitement about crypto, and was also jazzed by a few other personal projects I had just worked on (including messing a bit around with Unity and learning a bit of C#). That entire month had a kind of ‚Äúcrossing-the-Rubicon‚Äù valence to it. Between finally making it to 2021, the storm on the Capitol, and the promise of vaccines on the horizon, it seemed like the world was reconstituting itself. \n\nStill, like everyone else at my job, in finance, and probably most people in the country, I was completely shocked to watch what happened in the final few weeks of January when Gamestop rose roughly 750% in the span of a few days, invigorated by the forces of Reddit. Among my colleagues, the reaction was a mix of fear, awe, and self-protection. Chief among the concerns: could one of our positions be next (a new neologism: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt short something if r/WallStreetBets is about to send it to the moon. You will get rekt‚Äù). Over the next few days, our outlook evolved: by January 28th we had a deeper grasp of the months-long leadup to the saga. RoaringKitty had sowed the seeds for months on YouTube and the idea had been percolating for awhile on Reddit. This realization prompted a more nuanced discussion about the way the average retail investor was a lot more sophisticated than the elite Wall Streeter gives them credit for. \n\nr/WallStreet bets had illuminated something: everyone was now playing the same game, mediated by the same interface. COVID rendered us all crouched, behind screens, contending to steer the same pools of capital in different directions. I think institutional Wall Street is afraid for a reason that‚Äôs even more intrinsic than the idea of being liquidated or margin-called. The game that we‚Äôd spent decades perfecting and protecting for a select group of insiders was now open to anyone. A great incursion on the social network was unfolding for everyone to witness. The funhouse culmination of Metcalfe‚Äôs law. \n\nI believe crypto only intensifies that. Capital can now move at the same pace of online thought. Jesse Walden even hinted at that in the first article of his that I read: ‚ÄúWe can now move bits of value in the way we move bits of information: using an open standard, in very granular transmissions, instantly, to anyone, anywhere in the world.‚Äù That ability will change everything. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e0065b2b-dd1e-411b-bd11-87a515588576.jpg?height=311&width=577)\n\n### Describing the Present \nEveryone‚Äôs journey down the crypto rabbit-hole is deeply personal to them. Mine is an amalgamation of my work in finance and investing, my private anxieties around whether I gave film enough of a shot (and underpinning that, a desire to make the act of creating art easier and more financially viable for my friends who were brave enough to go all-in), my personal tendencies toward light iconoclasm, my delight in uncertainty, and my desire to make the world a fairer, more economically just place. I think most people in crypto share some array of these traits, and have their own motivations as well. I think the key is finding the unlock for each person, and introducing them to crypto that way.\n\nMy dad began to grasp Ethereum after I suggested he read the white paper; as a lawyer, he immediately grokked the idea of immutable smart contracts. I‚Äôve started a consulting gig with a resale and limited-run goods startup on a social token rewards system, and our conversations have centered around unifying the values of buyers, sellers, and creating relationships that endure beyond a transaction. Given the pace of sell-side notes, investment bank-hosted webinars, and recent high-profile announcements of potential TradFi-DeFi alliances ([Compound Treasury, for example](https://medium.com/compound-finance/announcing-compound-treasury-for-businesses-institutions-83d4484fb82e)) I think Wall Street is beginning to wake up to the indelible momentum of crypto as well.\n \nIn my final weeks as a stock analyst, I pitched Ethereum, Uniswap, and MakerDAO as long positions to my colleagues (though no one bought...yet). We had numerous discussions around the promises of crypto, and what various crypto-native business models might look like. [Marc Rubenstein‚Äôs](https://twitter.com/MarcRuby) excellent [Reinventing The Financial System post](https://www.netinterest.co/p/reinventing-the-financial-system) about MakerDAO was the catalyst for a thorough, long-winding conversation about the fractional reserve banking system, and the way loans underpin the financial industry. I think my former teammates were surprised to hear that crypto could be used as a means to issue a dollar-backed stablecoin, and that a blockchain-based issuer could also begin to do work in new segments like [real-world-asset-backed loans](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/real-world-finance). While MakerDAO‚Äôs initial pool of RWA loans is quite small (just under [~4m in total loans outstanding today](https://duneanalytics.com/queries/38282/75752)), it‚Äôs easy to see this scaling into a much larger operation (which [could help diversify their collateral base away from USDC](https://daistats.com/)). These are early signs that crypto has the potential to grow to touch more than just value-exchange online. \n\nIt‚Äôs still so early for everything. A few nights ago, I went back and re-read some of the first messages I sent with the Turkish grad student from 2017. I wanted to revisit what I was really thinking about cryptocurrencies at the time. Our messages began in September, just a few weeks after my post-internship job offer. This part in particular stuck out to me:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d87d30d1-c279-453e-8e65-d716bd26d23b.jpeg?height=523&width=665)\n\nEssentially, I was asking -- how can Bitcoin (or Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency) scale without the kind of leverage and rehypothecation that we see in traditional financial markets? In my own words ‚Äú*Bitcoin (or the blockchain) can‚Äôt replicate the international banking system we have where money and ‚Äòvalue‚Äô is basically manufactured through securitization and other fancy financial instruments.*‚Äù Obviously, I was not anticipating DeFi. As I said in the second message ‚Äú*I‚Äôve noticed that tech people are usually way more imaginative.*‚Äù I was right about that. DeFi had a little under $2bn in TVL a year ago and now sits [just above $50bn in TVL today](https://defipulse.com/) (and much more if you include blockchains like Solana and Binance)  -- a staggering amount of growth. \n\nWhile you might argue that DeFi encourages some degree of reckless over-speculation, overleveraged trading, and is artificially inflating the value of certain crypto-assets today, I actually don‚Äôt think that matters longer-term. For one, price action in the industry serves as a form of advertising, and an early engine of innovation (Chris Dixon and Eddy Lazzarin [had a good post that examined this phenomenon](https://a16z.com/2020/05/15/the-crypto-price-innovation-cycle/) with respect to the price of Bitcoin, but the same is likely true if you map in assets like Ethereum or Solana). Even if certain assets fluctuate today (and those fluctuations are intensified by leverage), the overall impact of getting more people interested in crypto is a positive counterweight to any near-term mania (though yes, it does suck for the people who lose a lot of money). \n\nAnd even if DeFi and yield farming is creating nearer-term hype, it‚Äôs also illuminating the greater promise of crypto in general: the idea that if you eliminate middlemen and share value with users of a protocol instead, the positive externalities are so great that crypto can start behaving like a public good. Grants issued by groups like Uniswap and the Ethereum Foundation are an early indication of this. And this isn‚Äôt confined to just DeFi; NFT projects allow creators and collectors to share in the value of art created by eliminating (or at the very least, reducing the take rate) of middlemen, while encoding an enduring revenue stream for the originator of a specific work. Hopefully we‚Äôll soon see ways to map this model onto other scalable operations, like music and other forms of entertainment, DAOs that own real estate, and maybe a blockchain-based Uber. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b229174b-6b68-48b8-8a23-7567eb750663.jpeg?height=259&width=460)\n\nThe ‚Äúseeing things as stocks‚Äù mindset that was first inculcated in me four years ago will likely need to be reframed. In the future, public companies may see no separation between users, employees, and shareholders. In fact, ‚Äúpublic companies‚Äù as we understand them today may not even exist, as they will have issued tokens at an earlier stage, and might not even IPO. While I realize I‚Äôm now violating my favorite neologism (‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try to predict the future. Try to describe the present.‚Äù), I think we have early signals that this could come to pass. Everything from the increased focus [on DAO treasury management](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-daos-should-approach-treasury) to aforementioned efforts to collateralize real-world-assets with DeFi indicate that the need to tap public markets for capital may recede (it‚Äôs also quite possible that public markets and TradFi in general are reshaped from within by crypto, in ways that I‚Äôm not yet imagining, and they continue to endure in a revitalized form). Of course, there are tons of uncertainties here: the continued pace of user adoption, and regulatory overhangs are two big ones. \n\nMostly, I‚Äôm just unabashedly optimistic, for all the reasons I outlined above. In the four years since I first started paying attention to crypto, the industry has transitioned into an instrument of genuine value creation. I‚Äôve met so many people in the past year who have inspired and galvanized me -- and my only hope is that I can contribute to an industry that I believe will revolutionize the way we live, both online and in the physical world. \n\nUsually when I write an essay, I start with the concluding paragraph already written, at least in my head. I tend to begin already knowing what I want the lesson to be. This is one of the few exceptions -- an hour before publishing this, I‚Äôm sitting on the couch in my living room, trying to figure out the best way to bring both the past four years of my professional life, and the promise of crypto to some kind of satisfying finale. And I‚Äôm realizing that it‚Äôs probably an impossible task to achieve in writing. Because with crypto, you just have to live it. So now I‚Äôm off to go do that. \n\n*Thanks to early readers of this essay: Andrew, Jeremy, Keeks, Reggie, Tarun, and Toby.* \n\n*Also boundless thanks to the builders, writers, thinkers, tinkerers, and visionaries who have made their work available on everything from Github to blogs to forums to Discord messages.

While the content and framing has evolved over the past 6 months, the core vision has remained the same: to craft a crypto-native artifact that captures the humanity of the people building the future of Ethereum.\n\nIt contains the hopes, fears, and anticipations of the Eth2 researchers and client implementers directly responsible for bringing the Beacon Chain to life on December 1, 2020. The future of the Beacon Chain is the future of Ethereum, and we‚Äôre proud to tell part of its story this far.\n\nWe prompted contributors with a few questions - you'll find them in order in each response, some but not all answered.\n\n- Name / handle\n- Affiliated orgs\n- Primary role\n- Eth2 rough start date\n- General summary of experiences\n- Code or documentation they are particularly proud of\n- Most memorable or painful-to-discover Eth2 bug\n- Person you've come to admire or want to give a shoutout to\n\nKeep in mind that these responses were gathered both before and after the Beacon Chain launch, so references to launch expectations will vary. Profiles are ordered alphabetically by first name.\n\nFinally, while we made the utmost effort to include as many people as possible, it‚Äôs inevitable that we missed or were unable to feature some contributors. Eth2 wouldn‚Äôt be what it is without the input of hundreds of community testers and code contributors - thank you.\n\n---\n\n### Ethereum = Eth1 + Eth2\n\n- Ben Edgington\n- Originally [published on eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/wnie2_210328), 28th March, 2021\n\nLet's start with a quick history of what's become known as Eth2, and where it's headed in the future.\n\nRecently, Danny Ryan has announced his [intent to deprecate](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/) the use of the terms eth1 and eth2. As the creator and curator of ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New in Eth2,‚Äù this is a bit of a blow!\n\nBut, on the whole, I agree that these terms are beginning to outlive their usefulness, and are in danger of becoming quite misleading. It‚Äôs not really about fiddling with names; it‚Äôs about capturing fundamental changes in direction, and communicating them clearly. Changes in the roadmap are confusing for the community. Clarity in naming aids clarity of understanding.\n\nHere's a brief history of naming things in Ethereum‚Äôs roadmap.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the first use of the name ‚ÄúEthereum 2‚Äù was by Vitalik in Hacker News, way back in [April 2014](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7554923). He positioned Ethereum 2 as being a future step-change in the capability of Ethereum through the use of ‚Äúfundamental cryptographic upgrades.‚Äù\n\nEthereum 2 then drops out of view, and the main narrative becomes the familiar Frontier ‚Üí Homestead ‚Üí Metropolis ‚Üí Serenity progression, first described in [March 2015](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). In this scheme, Serenity is the network upgrade to Proof of Stake; Serenity isn‚Äôt Ethereum 2 per se. Interestingly, sharding/scaling doesn‚Äôt have a clear place in that roadmap, although it was certainly discussed [around that time](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/05/blockchain-scalability-chain-fibers-redux/).\n\nProgress largely followed this plan for some years, with Homestead going live in March 2016, and Metropolis (in name at least) in a pair of upgrades in October 2017 and February 2019.\n\nSerenity was to have been delivered via a process of upgrading the existing Ethereum chain to bootstrap Proof of Stake. That upgrade was specified in [EIP-1011](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1011.md) and there was even a [testnet](https://hackmd.io/@aTTDQ4GiRVyyce6trnsfpg/Hk6UiFU7z?type=view) that went live on December 31st, 2017.\n\nHowever, the road to Serenity was found to be a dead-end, not least because of the vast amount of Ether that stakers would require - 1500 was the number back then.\n\nSo, in mid 2018, we tore up that roadmap and started afresh with Ethereum 2.0. Rather, we reverted to Vitalik‚Äôs original idea from 2014 of an Ethereum 2 that was to be a significant cryptographic step-change to the protocol. Calling this Eth 2.0 made sense: we were planning to change pretty much everything about the platform. Ethereum 1 would eventually be brought in as a kind of legacy system. This Ethereum 2.0 roadmap came with neat consecutive phases: Phase 0 for Proof of Stake; Phase 1 for data shards; Phase 2 for executable shards; and, finally, bring Eth1 over to Eth2 after all that.\n\nWe‚Äôve now delivered Phase 0, but the rest of the plan has evolved. As per the latest Eth2 pages [on the ethereum.org website](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/), ‚ÄúEth2 [now] refers to a *set of interconnected upgrades* that will make Ethereum more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable‚Äù (emphasis mine). This looks much more like the old Serenity plan! We‚Äôre upgrading the Ethereum chain in-place rather than doing the old rip-and-replace.\n\nSo, you see, the roadmap narrative has vacillated over the years between effectively doing a replacement of Ethereum 1, referred to at various times as Eth2, and doing in-place upgrades to Eth1. Today, we‚Äôre more or less back in upgrade territory.\n\nIn view of all this, applying the Ethereum 2.0 moniker to the entire project is now seen as confusing: to some it implies a different chain to today‚Äôs Ethereum; to others, even [a different coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/md75k2/will_be_eth_20_a_new_coin_or_will_be_the_same_eth/). It suggests incompatibilities and problems ahead.\n\nThe [latest naming trend](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/), then, is to limit Eth2 to refer only to the consensus layer upgrade of Ethereum to Proof of Stake, and to refer to all of today‚Äôs Ethereum (fka Eth1) as the execution layer.\n\nIt's good to see everything moving under a consistent terminology and a shared roadmap. I'm looking forward to a productive rest of 2021 and beyond!\n\n[Continuations [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=26)\n\n### Aditya Asgaonkar\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2019 \n\nEth2 promises to deliver a decentralized, scalable, and secure blockchain platform on which stateful applications can live. These three qualities will be the driving force towards the mass adoption of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn the quest to satisfy the design requirements, we've also seen some amazing research and engineering progress. We have pushed the frontier of computer science in areas such as Byzantine consensus, signature aggregation, and VDFs. With the launch of Phase 0, we created the largest BFT consensus network in existence, which is an awesome feat in itself!\n\nMy favorite bit of work was the [\"Weak Subjectivity Guide\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/weak-subjectivity.md) - a document that outlines the weak subjectivity safety features of the Eth2.0 network. The goal is to prevent long range attacks that appear specifically in PoS consensus.\n\nAs for favorite bug, there was a consensus (fork-choice) issue discovered right before the Beacon Chain launch. The first priority was to assess the threat level of the attack -- it was critical and could have lead to a large-scale failure, but was extremely difficult to execute. Fixing this attack vector required a comprehensive review of the fork-choice component, and we had already identified a couple of solutions. At the end, there was agreement among the spec team that the attack didn't pose a critical threat because of its difficult execution, and we decided to publish a fix after further review was completed.\n\n### Adrian Manning\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Co-Lead Developer\n- Aug 2018 \n\nThe project has always been ambitious. The early designs were well thought out, but had shortcomings which became apparent when realising them through implementation. The collaboration between researchers and developers constantly iterated on these design specs for years, finally achieving a workable version of the original concept. The process was longer than expected, but it's been amazing to see the coordination and what has been achieved by a globally distributed group of implementers and researchers.\n\nOf all the work put into the Lighthouse client, I've changed and modified various architectures and designs and I'll likely continue to do so. I'm therefore not particularly fond of any individual piece relative to another. But I'm very proud of the end result. The resulting Lighthouse code-base that came together from everyone's hard work is what I'm most proud of.\n\nAs for person to give a shoutout to, I'm sure everyone has a similar answer, but for me it's Danny and Proto. Danny for the amazing organisational role and interfacing with all the client teams (especially on contentious topics) has sped up the development immensely. Proto (Diederick) for his relentless troubleshooting, bug-finding and research endeavours. He has been invaluable in interop testing, optimisation improvements and all round improving the general state of all clients and the eth2 ecosystem in general.\n\nAlso - there's an Australian saying, which I think applies to all eth2 researchers and developers: We're not here to f$!k spiders!\n\n### Adrian Sutton\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nEth2 is this big idea that started as a seed right back when Ethereum began and then went on this crazy, messy, long journey as the details were thrashed out through open research and public collaboration. All that messiness and the length of the journey is a result of this unique, highly collaborative and distributed approach to designing it. Multiple times, concepts that had been thought settled were thrown out because a better idea came along. While that has been frustrating for on-lookers, it has led to and continues to lead to huge improvements in the resulting technology.\n\nThe interop lock-in in Canada was a major turning point in the progress of Phase 0. It forced the Beacon Chain out of that research mode. Suddenly, client development was less about translating the Python spec to another language and more about engineering all the other components that make a client actually usable. Client teams finally had a stable platform to work from and make clients interoperable. There was an explosion of tools to aid developers in debugging and testing across clients. The Beacon Chain had stopped being a research project and started being an engineering one. The road to Mainnet started to become clear.\n\nNow with the deposit contract launched and deposits flowing into it, the pressure to deliver the rest of Eth2 really amps up. Community pressure to unlock those funds again will become overwhelming and despite all the warnings that it won't be quick, people will be disappointed at how long it takes. But those locked funds will also be the equivalent of the interop lock-in, forcing work out of the research phase and into production. All that time spent researching led people to wonder if Eth2 will ever ship, but with the beacon chain launch and all that money locked in, Eth2 has almost unstoppable momentum.\n\nThe future of Ethereum is very bright.\n\nI'm quite proud of my blog post explaining the weak subjectivity period: [\"Exploring Ethereum 2: Weak Subjectivity Period.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2019/11/27/exploring-ethereum-2-weak-subjectivity-period/) It was just me trying to get my head around a concept everyone seemed to be very hand-wavy about and put off solving to the future, yet it's become one of the standard reference points to explain the concept.\n\nI'm proud to have worked with Meredith Baxter and Cem Ozer. They have both been doing all the heavy lifting for Teku, almost entirely behind the scenes. They aren't flashy Twitter personalities, they just put their heads down and do the work.\n\nA few anecdotes to conclude: \n\n1. Family commitments mean I don't travel much, so when the first 7-client interop happened and a photo was posted of people crowded around the computer watching it, everyone in the photo was quickly identified but no one had any clue who I was. For a little while I was just \"that random guy in all the eth2 photos\".\n2. Before Ethereum, Ben Edgington only ever wore button-up, collared shirts. He's now exclusively dressed in Ethereum related T-shirts and has even picked up a penchant for Ethereum hoodies.\n\n[Caravans [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=27)\n\n### Afri Schoedon\n\n- Byzantine Fault / ESP Grantee¬† \n- Testnet Engineer\n- June 2018 \n\nI was working at Parity Technologies in 2018 which managed to implement EIP 1011, the \"Hybrid Casper FFG\" in the Parity Ethereum client. It was a hybrid proof-of-stake approach to the consensus engine and literally my first memory of seeing anything Eth2 related actually being implemented and run. There was Casper testnet up and running with Harmony, Pythereum, and Parity. It was exciting to see the idea of \"Serenity\" starting to materialize. \n\nHowever, it was the same year (only a few weeks later) that the Berlin Eth2 workshop decided to completely discard the hybrid Casper ideas in favor of the beacon chain. Admittedly, it was a massive undertaking. After all the ideation and the first implementations and testnets, we basically started from scratch. \n\nPrysmatic Labs first caught my attention when they launched their first public beacon chain testnets at the end of 2019. I was wondering why we had seven Eth2 clients but none of them was able to synchronize to the other clients' testnets. I was hooked and reached out to the Ethereum Foundation and the Goerli Initiative about contributing to multi-client testnets. And that's what I did in 2020, testnet after testnet up to the mainnet launch.\n\nWhen we launched the Goerli testnet in January 2019, it was not only an important milestone for Eth1 but it was also the perfect chance for Eth2 client teams to use this for their Eth1 integration leading up to the beacon chain genesis. Prysmatic Labs seized this moment and deployed all their Eth2 testnets to date to the Goerli testnet. Coindesk wrote a feature story with the headline [\"A New Test Network Just Activated and Ethereum 2.0 Will Be Using It.\"](https://www.coindesk.com/testnet-gorli-ethereum-serenity)\n\nAll my work on Eth2 concluded with the Eth2 mainnet launch in December 2020. The eight multi-client testnets are well documented on Github and received quite some [media attention](https://github.com/goerli/medalla).\n\nAs for bugs or missing features, that would be the lack of [BLS signature verifications](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/2081) in the deposit contract.\n\nShoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang!\n\n### Alex Stokes\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2018 \n\nWhat a ride it has been! The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020 represents the culmination of years of research and development across countless contributors from every corner of the globe, reaching as far back as the Ethereum genesis block.\n\nIt has been exhilarating to watch this effort go from a collection of wild ideas (e.g. informal talks on Casper from Devcon 3) to today‚Äôs production-scale mainnet. Having been involved before the ‚Äúcasper + sharding‚Äù merge and the formation of the eth2 umbrella, I have seen time and again how a dedicated group of individuals adapts and responds to changes both inside and outside the community. It is this resilience that I find most exciting, and that gives me confidence in a very bright future for Ethereum.\n\nWe are ready to weather whatever challenges may come our way and I cannot wait as we deploy a scalable Ethereum in 2021 and beyond.\n\nI'll highlight [some of the early Casper work](https://github.com/ethereum/casper/pull/143) that got me involved directly with eth2 in mid-2018. Part of the original proof-of-stake design involved a validator registry contract hosted on the eth1 chain. As part of the deposit process, validators provided an arbitrary smart contract for signature verification. While an interesting application of account abstraction, this smart contract needed to be deterministic so that signatures could be independently verified on-chain. In order to ensure the smart contract had the desired properties, it was processed by another smart contract, the \"purity checker\" (in the sense of a pure computation), during the initial registration.\n\nAn early version of the purity checker was written in a now deprecated smart contract language called Serpent LLL. I created a Gitcoin bounty to port the Serpent LLL to a language stack used in the ethereum/casper project, Vyper LLL.\n\nMost painful bug would definitely have to be debugging cross-client interactions during the eth2 interop event in 2019. Fun times, good people and challenging bugs!\n\nShoutout to protolambda!\n\n### Alex Vlasov\n\n- TX/RX¬† \n- Applied Researcher\n- July 2019 \n\nMy predominant impression is that Eth2 poses problems, which are perhaps the most challenging from a software engineering point of view, at the moment. This is exciting from a researcher's perspective, but sometimes frustrating from a software engineer's one. We must adapt, in order to survive in the endeavor.\n\nOne aspect is that we, as software engineers, are used to optimizing for the common case, largely overlooking rare ones. But the latter ones are exactly what an attacker will thoroughly scrutinize! The habit is difficult to break, especially considering that it demands huge amounts of time to analyze and optimize the worst case behavior.\n\nI'm confident that we have to use Formal Methods, as testing is not able to explore the search space exhaustively (except for rare cases, when the space is relatively small).\n\nAnother important aspect is that modern DeFi is demanding on resources. And that is not only data throughput, but EVM/CPU throughput too. ZKP/zkRollups is an obvious example. However, asset pricing can be computation hungry too. And, as we can see now, DeFi asset pricing is an important topic. Unfortunately, EWASM turned to be a much harder idea to implement than initially expected. And it's basically for the same reason - WASM JIT compilers are optimized for a common case, while worst case scenarios can be exploited by an attacker. So, I treat it as another manifestation of the problem discussed above.\n\nWhile the problems are difficult, I am very excited to investigate and implement potential solutions.\n\nOne idea that I'm working on is a (semi-)automated transpilation of Eth2 beacon chain Python specs to Kotlin. The [resulting Kotlin code](https://github.com/ericsson49/research/blob/master/beacon_kotlin_generated/src/phase1/spec.kt) is beautiful, IMHO. Kotlin turned to be a pretty good match for (a statically-typed subset of) Python.\t\n\nAs for a specific bug, it's not yet made public (as it can turn to be a serious vulnerability). But the basic idea is that swapping two lines leaves a function 100% functionally correct, while an attacker can send the code into a practically endless loop.\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan!\n\n[Discovery [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=28)\n\n### Ben Edgington\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Chronicler of Eth2 and Teku PM\n- January 2018 \n\nI could write a book on this, and perhaps one day I will. But the tl;dr is that getting to where we are has been the most incredible journey of my career.\n\nThe technology is thrilling, and the distributed development model no less so. But the highlight above all is getting to work every day with such a brilliant, thoughtful, capable, and generous group of people. If it's true that technology reflects the people who build it, then Eth2 is going to be a superb foundation for all the systems of the world.\n\nAs for the future, the beacon chain was designed, developed and delivered astonishingly quickly, having been conceived only in June 2018. Things get harder from now on: the beacon chain already carries so much value, and we need to begin taking into account the existing value on the Eth1 chain as we work on a merge. I think our main challenges ahead may not be technical, but more governance related. But I am confident that, with the ethos we've established and momentum we have as a community, we can bring this thing to a successful conclusion.\t\n\nI've enjoyed writing up regular digests of the latest developments in the spec since October 2018 at [eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/), really with an audience of just the other Eth2 devs in mind. Over time it's grown and evolved, and now gets between three thousand and ten thousand views per edition. This amazes me.\n\nI am still happy with my one and only ethresear.ch post, co-written with Nicolas Liochon: [\"Exploring the Proposer Collator split.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/exploring-the-proposer-collator-split/1632) While more of a design bug than a code bug, some credited it with finally finishing off the old sharding design, and precipitating the move to the beacon chain. I think things may have already been heading in that direction at the time.\n\nAs for individual shoutouts, what an incredible group of people - you are all amazing!\n\n### Carl Beekhuizen\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nAlthough eth2 has taken longer to get off the ground than I think any of us imagined, the result is extremely robust, secure, and decentralised.\n\nIt is incredibly exciting to see how eth2 is evolving and maturing into the backbone of the decentralised future we all dream about.\n\nI'm most proud of the key-derivation EIPs (2333, 2334, 2335). Specifically, the quantum-secure backup keys built into EIP 2333. In the event of a quantum apocalypse, validators should be able to recover using these Lamport signatures.\n\nI'm also really proud of the Launchpad. ü¶è So many validators managed to deposit safely.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang for the attention to detail and diligence she brings to everything she works on.\n\n### Cayman Nava\n\n- Chainsafe Systems¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- December 2018 \n\nThe past two years have been a blast. Looking back on the progress we've collectively made and the state of the ecosystem, I feel like we're on the cusp of something great. And I'm honored to be a part of it. I anticipate that Ethereum will be of critical importance for the future, as a rock-solid foundation that empowers ultimately successful experiments which aim to resolve many of the hardest problems facing society today.\n\nI'm proud of the [typescript implementation](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ssz) of SSZ (a copy of Proto's remerkleable). It fulfills the spec, but in an ergonomic way. You can operate on an ssz merkle tree as if it is a 'normal' javascript object. This required some exotic code, but the result is seamless [ssz <-> javascript interoperability](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/lodestar-medalla-update-59865a5cce1a).\n\nHuge thanks to Proto and his work! Many of the tools / algorithms / methods he's published are present in Lodestar: remerkleable, eth2-fastspec, protoarray fork choice, etc. the list goes on.\n\n### Celeste Seberras\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Technical Content Strategist\n- May 2018 \n\nIt has been a humbling experience to have witnessed the growth of Prysmatic from a small seedling with a dream to the robust and diverse community it harbours today; equally so for the broader Eth2 ecosystem. Hard work over the past two years has proven that, through all the speculative noise and interindustry drama, the things that truly speak are code and passion.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Prysm client usage manual.\n\nShout out to all the boys here at Prysmatic Labs. You are all fantastic to work with, here's to the future!\n\nShoot for the stars. Even if you miss, holy fuck you're in space!\n\n### Cem Ozer\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2019 \n\nI‚Äôm blown away that the Eth2.0 beacon chain is now alive and well. For me it was such a complex undertaking, and deep down I was scared it would never launch or be successful.\t\n\nWhen I first joined Teku (called Artemis back then) we were almost only working on the state transition. The spec changed pretty rapidly at the time, and as a result we had to update our state transition many times. I found myself leading these changes at Artemis, and it would almost always be a week long intense marathon where we‚Äôd change thousands of lines of code as a team, and I‚Äôd try to make sure we did not break anything.\n\nLuckily this was in the prototyping phase, this is not how it‚Äôs done today in the production phase :). I‚Äôm also pretty proud of having worked on the Eth1 Deposit Management of Teku.\n\nMy best bug discovery is luckily documented by my team lead Adrian Sutton on his blog: [\"The Curious Case of the Invisible Fork.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2020/07/06/exploring-ethereum-2-the-curious-case-of-the-invisible-fork/)\n\nShoutout to Johnny Rhea, Adrian Sutton, and Protolambda. These three people are all geniuses in their own unique ways. It was an honor and an incredible experience working with them.\n\n[Build - Maintain [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=29)\n\n### Chih Cheng Liang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2017 \n\nI'm glad to be part of Eth2 development. There are too many people; I can't express my gratitude enough. There are lots of beautiful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nI'm excited to see what Ethereum will be with fully-fledged PoS as well as sharding.\n\nI'm most proud of introducing the Milagro BLS binding to Trinity. BLS signatures are like the steroids of Eth2. Back then, only one Python library, py_ecc, met the requirements of the Beacon Chain spec. py_ecc is great for research or education purposes, but for things like client implementations, the performance of the library is not on par. The na√Øve alternative is to find a Python binding of a fast language. Chia's Python binding to C++ code was the low hanging fruit to pursue.\n\nAs the Beacon Chain BLS requirements became more specific, and we had to interop with other clients in a short timeframe, we decided to try using Python to wrap \"milagro_bls\" - Sigma Prime's Rust library. The result is the \"milagro_bls_binding\" library. I'm proud of it because that's my first Rust-ish project, and it was used in a real use case.\n\nAs for most challenging bug, in early 2018 I worked on the [Casper prototype testnet](https://github.com/ethereum/trinity/pull/954) that Karl and Vitalik built on pyethapp. Pyethapp had many issues, but the most difficult one to debug was the peer connection issue. I got a lot of help from Dmitry from the Harmony team, he discovered many peer connection issues with the Java client's logs. One of them was pyethapp's catastrophic peer-to-peer bug.\n\nSpecial thanks to Jannik Luhn - he contributed lots of quality work in peer to peer research/simulation and Trinity.\n\n### Dankrad Feist\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- June 2018 \n\nBy historical accident, one of my first ever involvements with Ethereum was the research workshop in Berlin 2018 where the Beacon chain design (and merging of Casper and Sharding) was first decided. I had only come to the workshop because I was in Berlin at the time for my startup and my former colleague and friend, Justin Drake, had invited me to check it out. The concepts that were talked about at this workshop immediately appealed to the nerd inside me -- deep maths and computer science problems, nevertheless approachable and worth exploring to find elegant solutions. \n\nOver the next few months, I tried my luck on some of the problems that were discussed, especially the randomness problem. However, it would only be March 2019 that I left my startup and went to work on Ethereum 2.0 full time, so I would say that the concept of the beacon chain was by then fairly mature and what was left to be done was more tinkering around the edges.\n\nI think it is always worth reminding ourselves that the beacon chain itself, while only one part of Eth2.0, is a very ambitious project. As far as I am aware, Proof of Stake has never been tried on this scale: neither economically nor in the networking sense. What I mean by this is the sheer amount of funds that can be staked on the beacon chain, which due to the Ether market cap can easily approach billions of dollars in value. This is one advantage smaller projects certainly do have over Ethereum -- they can increase stake gradually, whereas Eth2.0 will very quickly go all the way.\n\nNot only that, but most other projects have refrained from actually imposing penalties on validators -- which compromises the security of PoS networks, but obviously makes designing it much easier, because literally nothing is at stake except for some very minor rewards.\n\nFinally, and this is the most important distinction, Eth2.0 is designed so that it can literally accommodate a million validators. That's pretty impressive considering that most other projects only support around 100! Not only that, but this feat is achievable using fairly modest node requirements, in fact it seems perfectly plausible to run a validator on a mobile phone or a Raspberry Pi.\n\nWhen we do launch the beacon chain, which is now truly imminent (barring extreme surprises), we should keep in mind just how ambitious this project is even on its own. \n\nThe beacon chain was essentially frozen 3 months after I joined the team full time, so I would not claim that I have made any major contributions to it. My most important contribution to Eth2.0 that is slated for inclusion so far is re-architecting the Proof of Custody construction so that it is fully suitable for SSVs (Secret Shared Validators). While we weren't too sure of the experimental cryptographic Legendre pseudo-random function (PRF) when we first came across it in March 2019, it has successively improved to a truly impressive construction on all fronts that I am now very proud of:\n\n1. Extended cryptoanalysis has improved our confidence in the Legendre PRF a lot in response to several bounties that we have set out.\n2. The combination of the Legendre PRF with the Universal Hash Function primitive, suggested by Dmitry Khovratovich, means that only a single evaluation of the PRF is needed per proof of custody, and the rest of the computation is extremely efficient and even faster than regular (sha256) hashing.\n3. Thanks to the probabilistic 0.01 bit proof of custody idea, only a small amount of information is leaked from the proof of custody, such that it would be impossible to gain access to custody secrets even if the Legendre PRF were broken outright.\n\nFinally, I have huge respect for Danny Ryan. He is phenomenal at keeping everything together and making it work.\n\n### Danny Ryan\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2017 \n\nSurprise! Everything is a bit harder than originally expected (at least from my perspective) - I suppose most of the things worth doing in life are. Today, I am very excited about the project and the progress. Eth2 has an incredibly strong technical background and is ready for the next wave of upgrades. Huge shout-out to the hard work from client teams, as well as to the validator community keeping this thing running.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the [beacon chain spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md).\n\nFinally, I don't want to imagine how this would have gone without protolambda's insight and technical contributions over the past couple of years.\n\n### Dmitriy Ryajov\n\n- Status¬† \n- libp2p developer\n- August 2019 \n\nSuper grueling, but rewarding in terms of overall impact on the different ecosystems, Eth2 itself, the Nim language and libp2p.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Nim libp2p implementation.\n\n### Hsiao-Wei Wang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Summer 2017 \n\nMy journey started with implementing Serenity‚Ñ¢. It was an ambitious and abstract concept. We've struggled with the design trade-offs for a long time, but with more and more contributors who devoted their efforts, and years of hard work, we were finally able to divide and conquer Eth2.\n\nIt was a fantastic journey to launch Phase 0 finally. I'm so grateful for the broad community support. And, of course, the Ethereum heroes who dove into Ethereum R&D.\n\nI'm very excited about the next Eth2 milestones and the creative ideas that the community will build on Eth2.\n\nI want to mention my admiration for Virgil Griffith, a pioneer that paved the way for Ethereum research work.\n\n[Seen and Seeing [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=30)\n\n### Ivan Martinez\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Engineer\n- August 2018 \n\nWorking on Eth2 has been an amazing adventure. It went from contributing in my free time to becoming my longest running full-time job. While there have been a few blocks on the way (unstable spec, implementation problems, testnet drama), it's been an absolute blast and this is just the start! Very excited to release, and move forward with future phases!\n\nI am particularly proud of building our [end-to-end testing suite](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/3932), which has proved incredibly useful for detecting issues before changes reach the canary. I've also helped build a lot of the [slasher](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5043) and optimized it for mainnet usage.\n\nOne of the most memorable bugs I encountered would have to be: [\"Change StreamIndexedAttestations to use target root for state regen #5971.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5971)\n\nShoutout to Terence Tsao! His ability to understand the spec has constantly amazed me (he's the largest contributor to the spec outside of the EF!).\n\nAlso.. Danny Ryan is awesome :)\n\n### Jacek Sieka\n\n- Status¬† \n- Research Lead\n- March 2018 \n\nI was fortunate to join Eth2 at the very start - having worked on many open source projects before, for fun, peer-to-peer networks like DC++, compilers like nlvm, as well as high-frequency trading. It all came together at that point like a perfect fit - a giant stroke of good luck. Here we are, years later, with the baby well on its way to being delivered.\n\nThe work I'm most proud of is managing to restore sanity and switching [Eth2 to Little Endian](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/139). It survived several high-profile attempts to swing it back to Big. I guess a more memorable, and certainly more involved feature, was the deep collaboration on the networking protocol that culminated with [what we have today](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1328) - this was quite the achievement made possible by some round-the-world collaboration with Adrian (of Sigma Prime), Ra√∫l (of libp2p) and lots of others! Less known is that me and Adrian resorted to flipping an Ethereum block hash coin to see who would get to post the PR :)\n\nI'm most proud of when Paul Hauner and I managed to run a fully independent, self-sufficient [multi-client Eth2 network](https://twitter.com/jcksie/status/1171886857908609024) for the first time, at the Canada retreat!\n\n### Jonny Rhea\n\n- Teku, TX/RX¬† \n- Client lead & TX/RX co-founder\n- November 2018 \n\n\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.\"\n\nParticularly proud of my Ethresearch post, [\"Packetology: Validator \nPrivacy.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/packetology-validator-privacy/7547) \n\nMost memorable bug: [\"DoS Attack on Prysm Stops Finality.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/public-attacknets/issues/12)\n\nShoutout to the Russians!

The equivalents of Project Gemini and Project Apollo are needed next. Rollups and Layer 2 will help improve scalability, but I believe there is much innovation that can and should continue to be done in Layer 1. There is a place for some execution, and cross-shard transactions in Layer 1. I also think that we should be careful about assumptions that we might make, like assuming that cross-shard transactions must be asynchronous. The challenges in the Ethresearch thread [‚ÄúCross-shard DeFi composability‚Äù](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-defi-composability/6268/9) need tackling with minimal assumptions.\n\nI dream of a system that is more scalable, performant, but preserves the default atomicity and synchronicity of Ethereum. I dream of shards that are transparent and automatically load-balancing. It may sound impossible, but can be used to inspire the engineers of the world to build the ambitious system that we can envision.\n\nDevelopments like Apollo and the Internet are an encouraging reminder to what humanity can accomplish: where there's a will, there's a way.\n\nWhy is this important? Why is a platform for decentralized systems important? John Perry Barlow may have answered it with his [‚ÄúDeclaration of the Independence of Cyberspace.‚Äù](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)\n\nPersonally, I'm delighted that [\"The Beacon Chain Ethereum 2.0 explainer you need to read first\"](https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain/) is usually on the first page of Google for \"beacon chain.\" I'm most proud of forming and recruiting a talented R&D group at ConsenSys that has made numerous Ethereum contributions. For Eth2, these include a review of the deposit contract and influencing an important Solidity implementation. More well known is the Quilt team, which started from R&D of Eth2 Phase 2 (execution, threads [quilting], rather than Plasma). Finally, years ago I helped connect Karl Floersch to the Casper \"team\" at EDCON Paris.\n\nShoutout to all of Ethereum Layer 0 -- its people -- without which there would be no Layer 1 or beyond. Layer 0 always welcomes you, and all contributions great and small :)\n\n### Justin Drake\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Late 2017 \n\nLooking back, the beacon chain took longer than expected to ship and there is significant work remaining in the coming years. Having said that, I am incredibly optimistic and excited about the future of Ethereum‚ÄîI could not be more bullish :)\n\nI'm pretty proud of the fact that the beacon chain spec is executable - it's pretty remarkable IMO. How many complex internet protocols have a full executable spec, not to mention four production-grade implementations on day 1?\t\n\nOne of the \"design bugs\" I was involved with early on was having PoS and sharding be separate cryptoeconomic systems as opposed to one unified design. Another big design flaw was using plain (as opposed to aggregatable) signatures. Looking back, in ~2 years we took a visionary but very rough design and made it orders of magnitude better.\n\nFolks dedicated to Eth2 are a rare breed (less than 100 of us) and I have tremendous respect for the team as a whole, as well as many individuals. I will note that, with where things are headed, we may soon have trillions of dollars running on Eth2 and we will need more manpower. So I want to give a shoutout to you‚Äîthe reader‚Äîto consider joining the Ethereum mission :) Hit me up by email, on Twitter, or on Telegram!\n\n[Traditions [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=31)\n\n### Karl Floersch\n\n- prev. Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Winter 2017 \n\nIt has been a wild journey to scale Ethereum & we are ridiculously close to realizing the vision after all this time. It's pretty insane. I'm most proud of the early work I did on [Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/casper) and initial implementation of [Hybrid Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/tree/b704a5c6577863edc539a1ec3d2620a443b950fb/ethereum/hybrid_casper). As for bugs, the pyethereum p2p layer was absolutely terrible and really crippled the testnet :'''(\n\nShoutout to Vitalik, Hsiao-Wei Wang, & Justin Drake!\n\n### Kirk Baird\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt's been a very busy two years; as only my second job working in IT, the learning curve has been massive. First and most importantly, my understanding of the core technologies around blockchains has matured from seeing them as a secure linked list to the complex beast they are. With the focus of my work being on integrating BLS into Lighthouse, a significant knowledge of pairing based cryptography was needed. The BLS signature scheme is far more complicated than the existing ECDSA used in Eth1. Luckily, there are a lot of good resources out there which explain how to progress from classical elliptic curve cryptography to pairing based cryptography.\n\nI was lucky enough to go to DevCon Osaka in 2019 which was an amazing experience! There were so many keen minds all meeting to relish and enjoy the progress Ethereum has made, but also to provide insights and ideas on how it will be improved and developed over the coming years. Japan itself is also an amazing place with so much to see, until we almost got stuck in a typhoon.\n\nI am most proud of the work done on [Milagro BLS](https://github.com/sigp/milagro_bls). This library was rough around the edges when I first inherited it, being a long way from the standardised signature scheme we have now.\n\nFinally, wanted to give a shoutout to Danny Ryan! The man is a weapon.\n\n### Mamy Andr√©-Ratsimbazafy\n\n- Status¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nI remember reading the \"70% ready\" spec in july 2018, that was the wild wild west. Things were on a HackMD document, changes were made every 6 hours and very hard to track - as mentioned in the EthCC 2 talk [\"Tests and Simulations of Eth2.0.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c4mQg5L6Rs&t=597s)\n\nOne of the most significant milestones was when, out of nowhere, all 7 clients at the time were able to create a testnet back in September 2019 in Muskoka. Anticipation, apprehension, will the launch work? If yes, that is definitely a huge milestone!\n\nI'm proud of my work on the [\"Auditors Handbook to Nimbus Beacon Chain.\"](https://nimbus.guide/auditors-book/01_introduction.html) Nimbus uses a dark horse language called Nim. It happens to be easily picked up, and our 3 audit teams were pleasantly surprised by its features, including those related to correctness.\n\nThe most infamous bugs we had were related to fork choice / Proof-of-Stake. The most infamous one would be this one-liner hotfix, where some votes were skipped in period of non-finality: [\"hotfix fork choice score application #2041.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/2041/files)\n\nBig respect to Protolambda! He came like the Hagibis storm.\n\n### Matt Garnett \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Researcher\n- January 2019 \n\nMy perspective on eth2 is probably very different from many people who were focused on Phase 0. Although I compartmentalized Phase 0 and Phase 1 to a large degree to allow myself to consider the possibilities of Phase 2, I never considered the possibility that eth2 wouldn't ship. To me, it was not a matter of \"if\" but \"when.\"\n\nI'm proud of the work I did writing the first Execution Environment for eth2, called [\"sheth.\"](https://github.com/quilt/sheth) It was completely stateless and allowed Ether transfers within a shard. \n\nShoutout to Proto, he has been instrumental in making eth2 happen, I don't know how he manages to be so prolific.\n\nA quick story to wrap up. On the first day of the Canada interop, the Quilt team drove up from Toronto in a 15-person passenger van. It had rained a bit so the area was sort of wet. The venue was tucked away off on a gravel road, right beside the lake. We pulled the van up next to the parked cars and headed in to visit with the eth2 teams. \n\nAfter catching up with everyone, we returned to the van to drive over to the airbnb we were sharing with the ewasm team. Will Villanueva had driven us there, so he hopped in the driver's seat and began orienting the van forwards to head out. The area we had parked in was sort of a T-intersection and there were small drop-offs (0.5m maybe) into a heavily wooded ditch anywhere there wasn't road. Will backed into one of the legs of the T and started to drive forward to leave. Unfortunately, the exit path was a rather steep gravel hill. The 2WD van didn't have the traction climb out and now we were positioned at an awkward angle in the T. The van was perilously close to tipping over into the ditch. Will backed up to a flatter part to regroup. I offered to give it a shot and he obliged. \n\nAt this point, we had drawn a bit of a crowd. I recall having people at each corner of the van, keeping an eye out to help avoid falling off into the ditch. I gave it a few attempts, but realized how difficult of a situation we were in. At this point, it was unclear if we could even return to our starting place, as the front left and back right of the van were less than a foot away from falling into the ditch - a ditch that would no doubt require a tow truck to collect the van from. There was no other option than making it up the hill. Fortunately, there was a bit of flatter ground between the van and the beginning of the hill. Although it would be a tight fit, likely inches on either side into the wooded ditch, I thought that with speed we should be able to build enough momentum to get past the steep portion of the hill. I shared my plan with the spectators. Unsurprisingly, the uninvested patrons were eager to fill me with confidence so they could enjoy the spectacle. I backed up the van as far as the gravel road would allow and then slammed the gas down. The van lurched forward, albeit lethargically, towards the top of the hill. The eth2 gods were almost certainly looking down on us in that moment and guided that van safely to the hill's peak. \n\nAt the top of the hill, I collected my emotions and then stepped out to enjoy the laughing and cheering. We inspected the ridiculous situation we had been in, and examined the ruts that the tires had made spinning out on the fail attempts. After the excitement died down and the spectators returned to the venue to continue working on their clients, we headed back up the hill to our van and drove home. \n\nFor the rest of the time there, we parked the van at the top of the hill and walked down to the venue.\n\n### Mehdi Zerouali\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Security Engineer, Cofounder\n- October 2018 \n\nI find it hard to believe that we're finally launching the beacon chain! So much hard work from so many different entities has gone into this over the past couple of years. I'm extremely proud of what Sigma Prime has accomplished so far and look forward to the Lighthouse crew making Phase 1, Phase 1.5 and Phase 2 a reality.\n\nThe structural differential fuzzer I've helped build as part of Beacon Fuzz is definitely something I'm proud of. Over the last few months, Beacon Fuzz helped uncover more than 40+ bugs on all major client implementations, including critical consensus related vulnerabilities.\n\nIt's hard to pick one person to recognize, but Diederik Loerakker (aka protolambda) has done such an amazing job helping the client teams navigate the optimisations required to implement the eth2 spec in production. Of course, the coordination job done by Danny Ryan is second to none. I doubt we'd be where we are today without these two exceptional individuals.\n\nFun fact: Lighthouse releases are named after Rick & Morty characters!\n\n### Meredith Baxter\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer, Software Engineer\n- November 2019 \n\nI was fortunate to join the Teku team at an exciting time (about a year ahead of the beacon chain launch) in November of 2019. We had a lot of work ahead of us and we weren't sure whether or not we would meet launch deadline with a fully functional, production-ready client. The learning curve to understanding eth2 is also pretty steep, which only increased the pressure. Luckily, the EF and other eth2 client teams have been an incredible resource for us throughout the development process. The engineers involved across the client teams have been very open and supportive. And the EF researchers have been amazingly welcoming, approachable, and responsive. They've always been there for us to answer questions and provide insights. It has been hugely gratifying to be a part of the successful launch of the beacon chain with the help of this incredible group of people. I'm very excited to continue the work as we look forward to upcoming changes including our first hard fork, sharding, and the merge.\t\n\nOne exciting milestone was getting [Teku syncing to a live](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/1143) testnet (Prysm's Sapphire testnet).\n\nI'm also really proud of our [checkpoint sync feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz3flfj50Ig) which allows new nodes to sync up and become fully operational within minutes. See the issue as well: \"[Implement sync from a recent state #3063](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/issues/3063).\"\n\nThe instability on the Medalla testnet in the fall of 2020 was a trying moment across the client teams, but we came out stronger on the other side. We were all working overtime to improve performance and patch issues revealed by the long period of non-finalization. One big fix I managed to push during this time involved putting a hard limit on amount of work required to regenerate states that dropped out of our in-memory cache: [\"[Issue 2608] Add ability to periodically persist hot states #2611.\"](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/2611) More context on the network instability can be found here: [\"Eth2 Implementers‚Äô Call #46 - 2020-08-20.\"](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/S1b2sJhzv)\n\n### Michael Sproul\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nAfter a brief foray into the blockchain world in 2017, I developed a taste for it and knew I had to come back. When I saw a job ad from SigP on Twitter for a proof-of-stake client in Rust, I dropped what I was doing and got involved ASAP. At the beginning I got deep into Lighthouse's consensus code which was then very much in flux due to lots of spec changes, and had been written in a gargantuan solo effort by Paul! From that foothold in consensus I then branched out into the database, op pool and slashing -- all of which captured my interest in a way no other project had. \n\nWhen we ran the first testnets in September 2019 off code I'd contributed to, I was kind of shocked the thing worked at all, and awed by all the hard work done by everyone else involved. This community of researchers, programmers and enthusiasts has been nothing but amazing, and I'm optimistic for a successful Phase 0 launch and the realisation of the Eth2 dream in Phase 1 and beyond. Personally, I can't wait until we can run some transactions, and look forward to getting into the minutiae of WebAssembly execution environments.\t\n\nI'm very proud of Lighthouse's slasher. I was able to draw inspiration from great foundational research laid by Proto, and dedicate myself to building a fast, concise implementation. Testing the implementation on Medalla and watching the carnage inflicted on other validators brought a perverse form of satisfaction ;)\n\nOne of my favorite bugs: [\"DB inconsistent after restart #1488.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/1488)\n\nShoutout to Cem √ñzer!\n\nI know of at least one core dev who force pushed a commit to master in the EthDenver bathrooms...\n\n### Mikhail Kalinin\n\n- PegaSys, TX/RX¬† \n- Applied Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nIt's been exciting to see how Hybrid Casper FFG and the Sharding proposal have been merged into what is now called the Beacon Chain. And how this research is evolving, growing, attracting a lot of new people. And finally the result is about to be shipped pretty soon. This was a big part of my life for two and a half years. I anticipate rapid movement towards Shards and the Merge when Phase 0 is shipped. Though there are many things yet to deal with.\n\nI am proud of the [Eth1 Shard Demo](https://github.com/txrx-research/eth1-shard-demo) that we made together with Guillaume from EF with decent support from EF researchers.\n\nI can give recognition to a bunch of people tbh. But, narrowing down, Danny Ryan and Ben Edgington.\n\n### Nathaniel Jensen\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Security Engineer\n- September 2019 \n\nI'd heard a bit about Ethereum before but had not developed a solid understanding.\n\nAlthough relatively new, I'm glad to play a small part in such a technically impressive undertaking. I am continually appreciative that I can work in such an interesting space, with such friendly and impressive colleagues and community, and contribute to something that has the potential to be profoundly important. I'm excited to see Phase 0 mainnet kick off, the culmination of so much effort!\n\nI look forward seeing the space continue to develop with the incorporation of the EVM chain and Layer 2 solutions, and all the interesting use-cases that I can't begin to imagine.\n\nMy primary contribution to the Eth2 ecosystem had been taking on maintenance and development of a differential fuzzer that compares state transitions across the Eth2 clients: beacon-fuzz. In September 2019, Sigma Prime was engaged by the Ethereum Foundation to continue development of Guido Vranken's previous differential fuzzing solution - comparing ZRNT and Pyspec, the Go and Python Eth2.0 executable specifications.\n\nI was primarily responsible for building out [the fuzzing framework](https://github.com/sigp/beacon-fuzz) to include comparison of other client implementations: Lighthouse, Prysm, Nimbus, Teku, Trinity, as well as adding fuzzing targets for additional state transition functions.\n\nAs for most painful bug, see the [\"Beacon Fuzz update 001\"](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/beacon-fuzz-01.html) on the Sigma Prime blog, section \"Golang Library Linking Errors.\" How to try to get multiple Go implementations running without having their dependencies clash, and dealing with arcane linking issues using existing tooling to build a Go fuzzing library that exercises cgo/C code (as Prysm depends on a C/assembly BLS library).\n\nI want to give a shoutout to Protolambda (Diederik Loerakker). He reliably gets to the bottom of really obtuse fuzzing results. He's our consistent fallback for deciphering complicated results across multiple Eth2 client implementations. From our interactions, he clearly comes across as a friendly, genuine, and technically outstanding individual.\n\n### Nishant Das\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- June 2018 \n\nIt was a very difficult endeavour to get Eth2 running smoothly. Ultimately, with teams well distributed across the globe, constant communication is always a challenge. However, despite all that, I am really proud of the fact that we have launched Phase 0 with 4 different clients running. I'm very optimistic for the future and am looking forward to the merge. There have been too many bugs to count, and I keep on finding new ones every week.\n\nShoutout to Proto - cross client compatibility would be nowhere near what it is without him constantly monitoring and working on it.\n\n### Paul Hauner\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has fostered an inclusive, open, and merit-based approach to technical collaboration. Under this environment we've seen many researchers, engineers and communicators flourish. This is a testament to what people can do when they share a common goal and are empowered to work on the things that interest them.\n\nAs Eth2 has progressed, Sigma Prime has grown steadily to include a team of talented engineers and computer scientists. I am grateful to work with these people and I learn from them every day.\n\nI hope to see Ethereum evolve into a tool that provides honest utility to everyday people, without jeopardising the sovereignty of their data or selves.\n\nRegarding work I'm proud of, I quite like the [minimal-allocation Merkle-tree hasher](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/consensus/tree_hash/src/merkle_hasher.rs) I built in 2018. It's simpler and more powerful than other algorithms I have seen.\n\nOne notable bug: [\"Manipulating deposit contract to gain an early majority #1446.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1446)\n\n### Pawan Dhananjay\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2019 \n\nI remember reading Vitalik's proof of stake blog posts in early 2018 and thinking that it sounds all good in theory, but no way we'll have a proof of stake protocol for more than a small number of participants which would work well in practice. Needless to say, it's been extremely impressive to see how far the effort has come in just a few years. Kudos to everyone involved, I'm glad to have been a part of the effort for the past year.\n\nAlso, a huge shoutout to the SigP crew! It has been an absolute blast working with these guys, learning from them and also indulging in their jolly Aussie humor :) Excited for the Phase 0 launch and geared up to begin work on Phase 1!\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be: [\"Update state before producing attestation #1596.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/1596)\n\nBig thanks to protolambda for sure. All his debugging tools have saved me (and many others I'm sure) hours of effort.\n\n### Preston Van Loon\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe last few years have been an adventure, to say the least. At first, I had just a mild interest in Ethereum. I didn't own any cryptocurrencies or really understand how they worked. After a few months of reading, I started to realize two things: 1) Ethereum was this incredible technology that has an unlimited potential to change the world for the better, and 2) Ethereum is incredibly slow and desperately needed to scale. \n\nImmediately, I looked for ways to help contribute to the scaling effort and then I met Raul Jordan. We met together in NYC for coffee and talked about starting a project to work on sharding for Ethereum. We formed Prysmatic Labs. Since starting the company in January of 2018, I've met some of the most interesting people in the world - many have become close friends. Working in Ethereum continues to fulfill my desire to make a positive impact, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the completed roll out of Eth2.\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be that time that all of Prysm nodes thought they were 4 hours in the future and thousands of validators were slashed in a testnet: [\"Roughtime reports clock offset by 4hrs #6825.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/6825)\n\n### Protolambda\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- November 2018 \n\nThe main theme is that we - researchers and client devs - did not make our lives easy. Spec updates have continued to improve the protocol itself, but caused instability in the process of updating implementations. A new network stack was adopted, and many difficult research and implementation problems had to be solved. In the future, I do not think this will change, as Phase 1 and later are complicated too. But the approach can be improved. Exploratory single-client implementation ahead of others could avoid duplicating work for other clients, and enable faster spec updates.\n\nMost memorable bug: [\"247120: encoding/binary: read at most MaxVarintLen64 bytes in ReadUvarint.\"](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/247120)\n\nShoutout to @Butta for his work on the beaconchain explorer.\n\n### Rados≈Çaw Kapka\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Software Engineer\n- May 2020 \n\nWhat struck me most when I joined the project was the seemingly infinite amount of good will and patience from others when onboarding a new contributor. I really appreciate it. As for the future, I fail to see how Eth2 can not succeed when there are so many great people working on it.\n\nShoutout to the whole Prysmatic team! Everyone is so cool I can't just pick one person.\n\nI planned to visit Japan in the summer of 2020 and start learning Eth2 after coming back. The pandemic ruined my plans so I joined the Prysm project in May as a contributor. Three months later I got invited to be one of the core team members. Pretty cool, huh? I guess 2020 is not that bad after all.\n\n### Raul Jordan\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nWe went from being a bunch of hobbyists and volunteers interested in Ethereum's future, to having a ton of responsibility with a client being used by a large portion of stakers today. Core dev work was indistinguishable from magic to me before starting on this, and it honestly still is. However, I am fortunate to be surrounded by people much smarter than I am, and constantly learning how to write better code. Every day, we feel the weight of the work we do and we foresee it will only keep getting more important, as Phases 1 and 2 develop and eventually Ethereum will be powering world-scale transaction volume, likely using the code we wrote. At some point, the blockchain we are building might have multinational implications, and the hard work from the research team to make it as robust as possible is very encouraging. I could not be any happier with how far it‚Äôs come along, and we'll ship it.\n\nI am most proud of our [original eth2 API](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/ethereumapis). One day I was hanging out with Preston and Terence and we‚Äôre like ‚Äúwhoa! Etherscan built a block explorer using our API for eth2??‚Äù and then beaconcha.in popped up and it was honestly mind-blowing. We spent a lot of time putting it together and it contributed to the success of the Prysm client early on.\n\nOur most memorable bug would have to be the [Medalla Testnet Incident](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-medalla-testnet-incident-f7fbc3cc934a).\n\nI admire my team at Prysmatic Labs. I look up to them every week in awe of their resourcefulness, prescience, and just overall raw software engineering knowledge.\n\nOur journey with eth2 started with a few of us posting in a go-ethereum gitter channel regarding starting a prototype implementation of Vitalik‚Äôs sharding FAQ. Little did we know that just a few months later, we would be neck deep into everything about proof of stake and sharding with Vitalik and the Ethereum Research team in Taipei. Coincidentally, I was visiting New York the same week I met Preston online via gitter, and managed to meet up in his office and start Prysmatic Labs officially within the next few days!\n\n### Robert Drost \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Project Manager\n- August 2018 \n\nLooking back, one remarkable thing that stands out to me is the unifying culture of optimism and positivity among the people who found Eth and Eth2 and dove into working on it. Kind of by self-selection over time, it's a community that wants to strive for the positive side of things. While it‚Äôs not always possible to maintain this, somehow over time it seems to always get back there again.\n\nMoving forward, two themes I look forward to will be the acceleration of innovation and delivery around Eth2, and the growth of bridging among Eth2 and most other crypto communities and protocols that matter.\n\nShoutout to Casey Detrio ‚Äî I love how he always seems to find a novel analysis angle to things!\n\n### Sam Wilson \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Protocol Research Engineer\n- October 2019 \n\nWell, I'm a relative newcomer to Ethereum. I'd been vaguely aware of Ethereum for years, and I had (and still have) a couple hundredths of a bitcoin lying around, but Devcon V was jumping head first into the space.\n\nThe Ethereum community, once you get past all the... crap on the fringe, is full of really welcoming people who come from really diverse philosophies. I found that particularly surprising, given how many scammers and hangers on there are.\n\nEth2, which is actually where I started learning Ethereum, is a huge undertaking being built by an equally huge amorphous conglomeration. Seeing the discussions from execution environments and WASM to pure data availability and minimal execution, and the journey from where we were a year ago to actually getting the beacon chain launched has been one of the most exciting periods of my career so far.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next phases, layers, and whatever else comes with Eth2, but more importantly, I'm excited for the memes, because really, that's what this is all about.\n\nIt's hard to compare what I've contributed with the amazing other things going on in the space, but I guess I'd have to say that the write-up on dynamic state access that Ansgar Dietrichs and I put together is probably the most influential thing I've worked on: [\"State Provider Models in Ethereum 2.0.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/state-provider-models-in-ethereum-2-0/6750)\n\n### Shay Zluf\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nLooking back on this past two years makes me feel how this space is being shaped by the people who build it, their values and their convictions. Working in Prysmatic Labs developed my skills and code quality in a way that I cannot describe. Raul Jordan and Preston van Loon make sure to lead by example. All the team members are super motivated and take eth2.0's success as their own responsibility. That kind of dedication comes only from taking part in a project that has higher purpose for each member of the team. Looking forward, I see those bright and enthusiastic figures attracting many more talented people into the eth2.0 effort, while step by step the Ethereum ecosystem becomes the collaboration infrastructure of humanity.\n\nI took part in kickstarting the slasher implementation in Prysm's code base. As context, old POS systems had a major flaw, called the \"nothing at stake problem.\" Policing the set of rules to avoid this on the massive scale of the beacon chain is a challenge. Solving this led to the design and implementation of the Prysmatic Labs slasher. Working with other team members and protolambda from the eth2.0 research team was a great privilege. I got a first hand experience of protolambda‚Äôs ingenuity in finding novel solutions to hard problems.\n\nShoutout goes to Preston Van Loon.\n\n### Stefan Talpalaru\n\n- Status¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2018 \n\nWe're moving at what probably looks like a slow pace, from the outside, but I'm confident we'll be able to replace Proof of Work with Proof of Stake. I can't wait to see the estimates for energy consumption reduction in the years to come!\n\nI'm proud of the many changes that lead to reproducible builds. It all started with replacing a language-specific package manager with Makefiles and Git submodules, in order to have a fine-grained control over all our dependencies. Over time, it grew into a somewhat reusable [\"build system.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-build-system)\n\nI also liked designing and implementing well-defined components like our [metrics library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-metrics/) or the [NAT traversal library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-nat-traversal). Much messier, but equally rewarding, was changing the Nim compiler and standard library to implement [efficient stack traces](https://github.com/status-im/nim-libbacktrace).\n\nI like hunting down mysterious stack corruptions. A memorable one was due to the wrong calling convention being used in a [C library wrapper](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/677#issuecomment-575636421). Another [nice one](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/issues/640#issuecomment-57008484) was triggered by a procedure parameter called \"errno\" (which the Nim compiler forgot to name-mangle).\n\n### Terence Tsao\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt has been an amazing journey, we have learned and accomplished so much along the way. Lots of great memories and friendships were formed. \n\nWith Phase 0 heading towards finish line, I'm particular excited about Phase 1 and all its cutting edge research. Go Eth2!\n\n### Victor Farazdagi\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Engineer\n- February 2020 \n\nMy Ethereum journey started in 2016, when I joined Status in building a censorship-resistant messenger. It quickly became apparent that, despite all the goodness the Ethereum platform and its decentralized network brought, in its current implementation they are relatively limited. So, getting attracted to Ethereum 2, with all its ambitious plans to revamp an already hugely innovative product, was just a matter of time for me. Right now, being part of the amazing crowd of highly motivated, even idealistic, people - with a chance to participate in delivering on the original Ethereum promises - is nothing less than a dream come true. I love the community, the leadership, and even the complexity of the software we're building. With Phase 0 behind us, we have significant momentum, so 2021 will definitely become a year of groundbreaking accomplishments!\n\nOne bit of work I am particularly proud of is the [\"initial synchronization implementation,\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/tree/develop/beacon-chain/sync/initial-sync) which absolutely every beacon-node runner relies on. So, whenever you cannot sync, or sync takes forever, you know who to blame for it now!\n\nRegarding nasty bugs, during the [\"Medalla incident\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/7039) in August 2020, we had troubles syncing back. While the fix was easy, discovering the problem wasn't.\n\nShoutout to Diederik Loerakker! (yeah, better known as protolambda)\n\n### Vitalik Buterin\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- January 2014 \n\nI'm really happy to see how far the Ethereum ecosystem has come in the last few years! In the dark old days back in 2014-2017, it was just myself, Vlad and a couple other people thinking about proof of stake and sharding, and progress was slow; since then, there has been a rapid growth, professionalization and general improvement in the ecosystem and the team. We have much more sophisticated tools, are dealing with advanced cryptography, and a much better process for creating and refining the spec and the implementations. 2020 eth2 is sooo much better than Casper in 2017!\n\nNow, of course, we enter what may perhaps prove to be the most difficult part of the whole process: getting eth2 actually out the door and running. The whole process reminds me of what we had to deal with back in 2015, except this time there's 10x the complexity, 100x more people watching and 1000x the value at stake. Good luck all :)\n\nIf I had to pick one component I'm proud of .. maybe [the entire phase 0 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md)?\n\nShoutout to Danny.\n\n### Will Villanueva\n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Researcher\n- February 2018 \n\nEth2 research was overwhelmingly fun. We explored pushing the boundaries on how the execution layer could operate. We prototyped, researched, and implemented a simpler version of advanced execution (Execution Environments) on eth1, also known as account abstraction.\n\nA lot of the work Quilt pursued is covered in the post titled [\"Ethereum 2.0 Phase 2 Progress.\"](https://medium.com/@william.j.villanueva/ethereum-2-0-phase-2-progress-7673b57eabff) \n\nAdditionally, some of our account abstraction work can be found on Ethresear.ch as [\"DoS Vectors in Account Abstraction (AA) or Validation Generalization, a Case Study in Geth.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/dos-vectors-in-account-abstraction-aa-or-validation-generalization-a-case-study-in-geth/7937)\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan, all the way!\n\n[Onward [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=32)\n\n---\n\n*Kudos for reading to the end!

We‚Äôre looking for thoughtful, kind, and compassionate members with an operational background.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8615428c-fc33-46cd-8c38-41a831cef153.jpeg?height=726&width=1334)\n\n### Treasury \n\nAs the FWB DAO matures in operations and begins to explore revenue streams, having an experienced treasury management team becomes paramount for cost control and transparency for the community.\n\nThe Treasury team will help set budgets for various teams ranging from Editorial to Product, as well as continue to provide quarterly financial recaps on runway, success metrics, and revenue. \n\nJoin the [Treasury team](https://airtable.com/shrFKE83fThjmffDU) to help define the future of DAO processes and strategies.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/499a55a3-e103-4c0a-ad94-7a8f64a42658.jpeg?height=726&width=1334)\n\n------\n\nTying it all together, these four teams set the stage for the first round of many to come.\n\nWe‚Äôll be tracking engagement through active participation in a team, ultimately building on the evolution of FWB to build more verticals for members of all disciplines to get involved in the ways they see fit.\n\nMore on this front coming SoonTM!\n\n## Season Three Membership\n\nStarting on July 9th, the membership threshold will be raised to 75 $FWB.\n\nThis threshold was decided through governance and finalized through a [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmRQiMmyfAFD8DxhGGyFMYZecLcGGCS5wQQVBPqRjTA2a8).\n\nWe‚Äôve [distributed 2000 FWB](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1r555SU_CAb5-rMIl2y3stpwx8_YvR6RLENczLMoWPHE/edit?usp=sharing) (or twice as much as last Season) through SourceCred across all members who have linked their wallet to earn FWB from their contributions to Discord.\n\nWhile the last two Seasons featured a 5 FWB increase, this Season's 15 FWB increase should create an active push for members to engage with a team of their choice.\n\nAs we create deeper relationships, so too should the ability to get involved.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt done so already, please [consider applying](https://airtable.com/shrFKE83fThjmffDU) for a team of your choice. While still in its early stages, there‚Äôs no better way to add value to the DAO than by working with your Friends.\n\nRegardless, we‚Äôre thrilled to be pioneering what it means to work in a decentralized world and look forward to curating the next wave of culture for all to enjoy.\n\nWith each passing Season, the FWB family grows stronger.\n\nThank you to each and every loyal contributor and we look forward to expanding what it means to be a [Friend with Benefits](https://discord.gg/4Sk79s)", "timestamp": 1625618127, "digest": "TvKSPfZqHNXRZVYFYyJuziCMIZ8fZ34q585YcUYRGtc", "contributor": "0xCaCEa967ae0d35d2A006Bb63ec557Fd8A6F013db"}

I was at a state where I was torn between my current job, and what I want to be doing.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Throwback to 2019\n\nI think the last time I felt like this was back in Q2 of 2019. I was in college, I had a regular freelance gig, and I ran a small sticker business (my proudest endeavor at the time). \n\nI noticed that every time a friend of mine asks me how was I, I would say \"Eto, pagod (Here I am, tired.)\" I thought that something was wrong because I'd answered that way to many people already, and I compared my answers to the other people in the room. Their answers felt normal. Working, studying, doing regular stuff. They weren't like me, who was tired.\n\nFast forward to a few months later, I unofficially dropped out of college (I just took a Leave of Absence... one that I am still in, two years later.)\n\nSince I left college, I made the layout for two magazines for that one regular freelance gig, worked in a boutique integrated marketing agency, made my own event organizing group, organized three events, and took (what I think is) a well-deserved 6-month break before going back to work, but for multinational advertising agencies.\n\n*Lowkey \"thanks pandemic\" because I feel like I wouldn't have stopped myself from the grind if it weren't for the lockdowns and all.*\n\n### Now, back to 2021\n\nIn 2019 it was college + freelance work + sticker business. Now, it's work + Web3 + urge to learn.\n\nI'm currently working at a multinational advertising agency, doing work for various known brands. I can't say anything negative about the past two months I've been with them. The work's interesting, the people are great, the pay is good, and this isn't me kissing ass or whatever.\n\nFor Web3, I've been going deep around the rabbit holes (more like anthill if you ask me) of NFTs, cryptocurrencies, decentralized platforms, how organizations work, and more. I think I can officially say that I work for a social token insight aggregator called [Forefront](https://forefront.market/), so it's kinda my job now to get even more involved in the space.\n\nOn top of those two things, I also feel like I don't know much about my craft for me to even generate more high-quality outputs. Sure, I can learn more from work experience, but I want to learn from reading and practice, not because I have to produce something in a fast-paced world. I miss learning with the freedom to make mistakes (what I think is the most important part of learning).\n\nI even want to produce my own self-taught graphic design curriculum, something I would publish here on Mirror if ever I get to do it.\n\n### What I'm thinking right now\n\nThere's so many great things happening in the world of Web3, and I want to be able to help out in any way I can. \n\n**Pay is already WAY higher than my current monthly salary, for WAY less work.** Because crypto is global, I don't have to be stuck with the low value of compensation in my country. \n\nAs a person living in a third-world country, that means being able to pay the bills and have food on my family's plates for a longer amount of time, WHILE having more time I can use to invest on myself.\n\n**Good example:** The NFT Edition below, if sold out, is already more than 1/3 of my current salary. I just made a PNG file and wrote this post, and I CAN get that money if 25 people do purchase it.\n\n*BTW, this is not me telling you to get it, LMAO. Just buy the NFT if you want it.*\n\nWhat's keeping me torn between staying in the advertising industry and leaving it for Web3 is that I won't have anything to put on whatever documents I may need when applying for a visa if I want to migrate somewhere else.\n\nCrypto isn't even regulated here, so I don't know how I am going to be able to leave this country and have a better life. \n\nI'm turning 23 near the end of the year, but these are things that I already have in mind as the first-born out of two kids. How do I migrate to another country? What if I get a condo instead so I have my own place? Can I save enough money before my mom gets hospitalized for old age?\n\nI just feel like nothing is possible just because I'm stuck in this country ruled by greedy pieces of shit.\n\nHaving to work in a full-time job and explore Web3 has been tiring as fuck, especially with the things going on in my head. I think it's time to cut one, and I think you know which one is on the chopping block. But that doesn't solve my problem of being able to leave this country.\n\nTo end on a lighter note, I am optimistic that I am still in a very early stage of my life. I want to be able to make decisions that can help me not spend the rest of my life beyond 40 just doing work in your typical 9-to-5.\n\n---\n\n### An update since writing this post\n\nSince writing the first draft, I got a signal boost from [Denis](https://twitter.com/Iiterature) of Mirror [for my recent post](https://gianferrer.mirror.xyz/12YcfiY7I_bfWQ4YVl5dDh2HNS5o7fW2zPW646pzHNU), giving me an unexpected amount of support (the financial kind being a plus). I also had an interview with a platform around the Creator x Crypto space. \n\nI don't know what the future holds, but it looks very exciting.\n\n---\n\n*If you like what you just read, feel free to collect this post as an NFT!

The current price of a ton of carbon on the EU‚Äôs Emission Trading System is about $60/ton and you can buy carbon offsets for much less than that although you may be purchasing junk credits if you are not careful.\n\nIf you bought carbon today at $60/ton and held it until 2030 and sold it at $150/ton, you would get 2.5x on your money and a roughly 11.4% annual rate of return. If you can figure out how to buy carbon for a lot less than $60/ton, then your returns could be a lot higher.\n\nIt is increasingly obvious that the world will need to get off its addiction to carbon in order to stave off very serious climate impacts. The path to doing so is fairly clear but will be expensive. This chart from our portfolio company [Wren‚Äôs website](https://www.wren.co/our-approach) shows how we might get there:\n\n![](https://avc.com/content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-6.45.54-AM.png)\n\nThe bet on the price of carbon is a belief that the world will choose to eliminate its addiction to carbon over the next thirty years and that one way or another carbon emissions will become very costly and carbon capture will become very profitable.\n\nIf you believe that will happen, you can profit from it by investing in the price of carbon. There are many ways to do that and some will be more profitable than others. But a ‚Äúmacro bet‚Äù on the price of carbon feels like one of the strongest ones out there right now.\n", "timestamp": 1625655285, "digest": "FDtyWqyx57zi_UpKJiPYx5aT5za0-jRP8GknZ_p_-Z8", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

Is that something you might be interested in?\n\nThat‚Äôs pretty much Ethereum. It‚Äôs one of the most fascinating and compelling assets in the world, but its story is obfuscated by complexity and the specter of crypto. \n\nEthereum is so many things at once, all of which feed off of each other. **Ethereum**, the blockchain, is a world computer, the backbone of a decentralized internet (web3), and the settlement layer for web3. Its cryptocurrency, **Ether (ETH)**, is a bunch of things, too: \n\n*   Internet money. \n*   Ownership of the Ethereum network. \n*   The most commonly-used token in the *[Great Online Game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game)*. \n*   Yield-generating. \n*   A Store of Value (SoV). \n*   A bet on more on-chain activity, or the web3 future. \n\nBecause Ethereum is so much at once, it‚Äôs hard to understand. This post is an attempt to help Ethereum be understood. To a group like us, people interested in technology businesses, finance, and strategy, it‚Äôs much more fascinating than bitcoin, but that comes with a tradeoff. It‚Äôs much harder to grok than bitcoin, and because of that, it hasn‚Äôt gotten the mainstream or institutional attention that bitcoin has. \n\nBitcoin is easy. It‚Äôs digital gold. It‚Äôs a Store of Value (SoV). It just kind of sits there. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3679a2a3-d467-4975-8641-f6712310848d\\_484x500.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3679a2a3-d467-4975-8641-f6712310848d\\_484x500.png)\n\nThat‚Äôs its value prop. It‚Äôs immutable and the most decentralized asset in the world. It‚Äôs the OG and the hardest to attack. At this point, your bitcoin will not disappear overnight (although [this post on Tether](https://crypto-anonymous-2021.medium.com/the-bit-short-inside-cryptos-doomsday-machine-f8dcf78a64d3) is illuminating with regards to ways it, and other cryptos including ETH, can be manipulated nonetheless). As long as other people believe in its value, it will continue to be valuable. Technically, upper-case-B-Bitcoin is the blockchain and lower-case-b-bitcoin is the cryptocurrency, but for all intents and purposes, they‚Äôre the same. Bitcoin exists to make and track bitcoin. It‚Äôs very good at what it does.\n\nEthereum is so much more than a cryptocurrency. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúworld computer,‚Äù and the ‚Äúvalue layer‚Äù of the internet. It lets people build apps and products with money baked into the code. If you believe that web3 is going to continue to grow, then you likely believe that over time, Ethereum will become the settlement layer of a new internet. All sorts of transactions, whether they happen on Ethereum, another blockchain, or even [Visa](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/99639/visa-now-settles-payments-in-usdc-stablecoin-ethereum), will turn to Ethereum to exchange funds and keep secure, immutable records. A year ago, I wouldn‚Äôt have said that. \n\nUntil the past year, a lot of Ethereum‚Äôs value existed in a theoretical state, in the ideas of what *might* be possible on a decentralized global internet. Personally, I viewed it as a kind of more interesting thing that was kind of like Bitcoin but smaller and maybe higher upside? As a result, after buying ETH for fun in the 2017 run-up, I sold all 15 of my remaining ETH in June 2020 once I broke even. Lack of understanding = weak hands. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7a97ce6-6f7f-44c6-9ba9-ab7b310c2c6b\\_1008x80.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7a97ce6-6f7f-44c6-9ba9-ab7b310c2c6b\\_1008x80.png)\n\nAs you know, I‚Äôm an idiot. Even after the recent drop, those 15 ETH are worth over $30,000. I missed \\~10x upside. Not as painful as my $2 million [bitcoin mistake](https://www.notboring.co/p/is-blockfi-future-of-finance-2), but still dumb. To be fair, though, you shouldn‚Äôt invest in this stuff unless you understand it, and I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm starting to. \n\nBetween then and now, a few things have happened that flipped me from moderately curious to both very curious and very bullish: \n\n*   **Use Case Explosion.** DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs have emerged as real use cases for crypto, and have grown spectacularly over the past year.\n*   **Ultra Sound Money.** With the upcoming implementation of EIP 1559, Ethereum will likely become deflationary, knocking out its biggest monetary weakness. \n*   **Eth2.** Ethereum is currently running a test chain that will merge with the main Ethereum chain in about six months. When it does, Ethereum will switch from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), and more value will accrue to ETH holders.\n*   **Narrative.** The narrative around Ethereum is gaining steam and jumping from crypto people to the mainstream. Last week‚Äôs releases from Patrick O‚ÄôShaughnessy, James Wang, and Joe Weisenthal came in hot. This essay is one small additional push. \n\nRight now, **Ethereum is at a narrative inflection point,** and narrative reflexivity is more important for blockchains than for almost any other company or asset.\n\nI‚Äôm increasingly convinced that ETH will be one of the best assets to own over the next five years. Here‚Äôs the bull case in a nutshell: \n\n**Owning ETH is like owning shares in the internet. Demand for ETH will go up with increased web3 adoption, while upcoming changes will decrease the supply of ETH and let more value accrue to holders. It‚Äôs like a tech stock, a bond, a ticket to web3, and money, rolled into one.**\n\nTo make the bull case clear, we‚Äôll need to understand why Ethereum will survive and adoption will grow, how it actually makes money, and the differences between ETH and a tech stock. We‚Äôll cover:\n\n*   **Ethereum is the Excel of Blockchains**\n*   **How Ethereum Makes Money**\n*   **Legitimacy and Lindy**\n*   **L1 Ecosystem**\n*   **The Bull Case for Ethereum**\n*   **Threats, More Caveats, and a Conclusion**\n\nFor ETH to be worth something, and for the bull case to matter, Ethereum needs to survive and grow. It has faced early challenges and competition from purpose-built blockchains, and this past week was scary. Nothing‚Äôs guaranteed. \n\nTo understand why Ethereum isn‚Äôt going to die, let‚Äôs start with an analogy. \n\n### **Ethereum is the Excel of Blockchains**\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff681f94a-7b2c-4f9c-9aa1-b4ffcc765dc7\\_1502x438.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff681f94a-7b2c-4f9c-9aa1-b4ffcc765dc7\\_1502x438.png)\n\nIf you‚Äôre going to be bullish on Ethereum, the first thing you‚Äôll need to believe is that it will be around for a long time, and that more and more people will continue to use it, and that other people also believe those things to be true.\n\nYou‚Äôll be comforted to know, then, that **Ethereum is the Excel of blockchains**. \n\nThat‚Äôs not *exactly* right. The analogy breaks down in places. But for our purposes, it‚Äôs good enough. Start by comparing it to Bitcoin. \n\nBitcoin is like a database. That‚Äôs what a blockchain is -- a distributed ledger of transactions. The Bitcoin blockchain lets people send each other bitcoin (BTC) and tracks who owns which bitcoin at any given time. It can also reward people for securing the database by giving them BTC for turning electricity into solutions to math problems (Proof of Work or PoW). It does one thing really well: track ownership of bitcoin. \n\nBitcoin is kind of like a spreadsheet, and many people compare blockchains to spreadsheets, but that‚Äôs not what I mean when I say that Ethereum is like Excel. I mean that the same elements that have propelled Excel for nearly four decades are present in Ethereum, too. \n\nIt starts with flexibility. Ethereum is a Turing complete, programmable blockchain that lets anyone build full-blown applications using smart contracts. People can build all sorts of decentralized apps (dApps) on top of Ethereum, plugging into the blockchain and the surrounding ecosystem to provide everything from security to identity to payments. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) apps, NFT marketplaces, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and games and virtual worlds can all be built on top of Ethereum, all fueled by the native currency, ETH. \n\nThat flexibility is really hard to do. \n\nIn *[Excel Never Dies](https://www.notboring.co/p/excel-never-dies),* [Ben Rollert](https://twitter.com/benrollert) and I wrote about Excel‚Äôs staying power in a technology landscape that typically sees new products replace old ones every few years. We wrote: \n\n> ***If there is a core product design lesson to learn from Excel, it‚Äôs that combining usability with flexibility is both incredibly difficult and incredibly rewarding‚Ä¶.***\n>\n> *A design principle for developers is to make any one piece of software really good at one specific thing, deliberately constraining its capabilities to a specific domain. **Excel is a truly remarkable exception to this rule - it is something of a choose-a-phone, and clearly hundreds of millions of people do want to compose for it.***\n\nYou could replace ‚ÄúExcel‚Äù with ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äù and it works perfectly. Ethereum‚Äôs early usability challenges are a function of its flexibility. Ethereum is something of a choose-a-phone, and clearly millions of people do want to compose for it. \n\nBeyond the product philosophy, there are some specific similarities between the two: \n\n*   **Turing Completeness**. If something is Turing complete, it means that it can solve any reasonable computational problem. With the introduction of Lambda, which lets users create their own formulas, Excel became Turing complete. With Ethereum, you can write smart contracts that can solve any reasonable problem. \n*   **Composability.** In Excel, ‚ÄúYou can chain functions, passing the output of one function as the input to another, allowing for an enormous number of potential computational pipelines. Each time Excel adds a function, the power and flexibility of Excel is multiplied, since that new function can be chained to a large number of existing functions.‚Äù This is very similar to the idea of composability, or ‚ÄúX Legos,‚Äù on Ethereum. \n\nTogether, Turing completeness and composability mean that you can build smart contracts to compute anything, and then chain them together to build increasingly complex things, more quickly. It takes time to get the engine revving, but it should move quickly once it‚Äôs moving. \n\nThat‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening. After years of building in relative obscurity through the crypto winter, facing doubt that there was any actual use for any of this stuff, 2020 and early 2021 saw an explosion of real use cases for the Ethereum ecosystem.

This is not one thing. It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúprice go up.‚Äù It‚Äôs a sign of the momentum and composability in the space, where improvements in one area feed directly into improvements in another: \n\n*   Volume traded on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) like Uniswap increased 76x to from $2.3 billion in Q1 2020 to $177 billion in Q1 2021. \n*   Total Value Locked, or the amount of ETH staked in DeFi, increased 64x from $800 million to $52 billion. \n*   Beyond finance, NFT art sales increased 562x from $700k to $396 million. \n\nEthereum usage exploded in Q1, and while NFT sales have slowed, partially as a result of high gas fees and partially because the initial euphoria has died down, DeFi is still going strong: \n\nFrom May 1st through May 22nd, just Uniswap and Sushiswap, the two largest Ethereum-based DEXes, **handled $78 billion in transaction volume**. Q2 will blow Q1 out of the water. \n\nDespite the explosion in activity and transaction volume, though, the question remains: what does that mean for ETH? \n\n### **How Ethereum Makes Money**\n\nI‚Äôve been aware of Ethereum for a long time. I first bought (then sold) ETH in 2017, but it was speculative and I didn‚Äôt get it. The big question mark I had with Ethereum was how it made money. **How does more activity on top of Ethereum translate into a higher price for ETH?**\n\nIn the near future, the answer will be that more transactions mean higher yields for ETH holders and a decreasing supply of ETH. But that‚Äôs not how it works, yet. \n\nLet‚Äôs start with how it works today, look at the challenges of the current model, the proposed solutions, and what it will look like in the future. \n\n*(Note: For a more in-depth explanation, listen to [Justin Drake on Business Breakdowns](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ZXzLELW1489aCjUPHjTO4?si=2d3df8b0977f4d9d))*\n\n**Today**\n\nToday, when you want to transact on Ethereum, you need to use ETH. There are currently around 116 million ETH, and the price is loosely governed by supply and demand. More transactions on Ethereum means more demand for ETH which means higher price, all else equal. \n\nWhen you transact, say if you send another person ETH, a few things happen: \n\n*   You send 1 ETH and the other person receives 1 ETH\n*   You pay gas fees, say .01 ETH\n*   Your account balance on the chain goes down by 1.01 ETH, theirs goes up by 1 ETH\n\nTo keep Ethereum running, it uses a [Proof of Work consensus mechanism](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/#:\\~:text=Ethereum%2C%20like%20Bitcoin%2C%20currently%20uses,certain%20kinds%20of%20economic%20attacks.\\&text=This%20will%20also%20phase%20out%20mining%20from%20Ethereum.) to trustlessly agree on the state of the blockchain. Bitcoin also uses Proof of Work, that‚Äôs where Ethereum got it from, although Bitcoin mining is able to be run on cheaper hardware and has 20x more miners than Ethereum, and is therefore more decentralized.\n\nPoW achieves the same thing as your bank account balance going up and someone else‚Äôs going down when they send you money, except in the place of a centralized bank, there is a distributed network of miners who agree that these transactions occurred and that all balances are updated.\n\nTo do it, miners around the world race to solve increasingly difficult cryptographic problems in order to create a new block on the blockchain containing the new transactions. These problems are typically hard to solve -- read: require a lot of energy -- but [easy to verify](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/269786/what-computational-problems-would-be-good-proof-of-work-problems-for-cryptocurre). When a block is entered into the blockchain, the transactions in it officially become part of the record. Miners who successfully create a block are rewarded with 2 freshly-minted ETH (down from 5 in the beginning) and all the transaction fees within the block. \n\nThose transaction fees, called **gas**, are what people pay to submit transactions to be included in the block. When a user sends someone ETH on Ethereum, or mints an NFT, or does any number of things that need to be validated on-chain, they have to pay a gas fee. That gas fee goes towards incentivizing miners to spend the money required, in the form of hardware and electricity, to solve the puzzle and create the block. \n\nSo currently, the price of Ethereum is based on a combination of supply and demand, and the price it costs miners to secure the blockchain. To participate, you need ETH, and you need to pay the gas. Miners receive ETH in the form of newly-minted supply and your fees. Miners pay for hardware and electricity and taxes, and keep \\~5% of their earnings. Today, most of the value accrues to GPU makers, electric utilities, and the government, with the miner‚Äôs portion competed down to close to 0. \n\n**Challenges**\n\nThere are a bunch of challenges with this system. \n\n1.  **It‚Äôs Slow**. The Ethereum blockchain currently does somewhere around 19 transactions per second. Visa, for comparison, does about 1,700. \n2.  **It‚Äôs Expensive.** The simplest transaction costs about $5 in gas fees, and when I minted [The Great Online Game as an NFT](https://notboring.mirror.xyz/tw9hW87Sd1YXz_IqcvJXIS9pCxSSYBFVtZ2umBOdng0) with [Jack Butcher](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher) a couple weeks ago, it cost nearly $1k to mint and auction it. \n3.  **It‚Äôs Volatile**. Gas fees are based on auction, and change all of the time based on demand. That makes it hard to transact with confidence or predictability. \n4.  **It‚Äôs Inflationary.** Unlike Bitcoin, there‚Äôs no hard cap on the number of ETH that could theoretically be minted, and Proof of Work requires minting a bunch of new ETH, which means growth leads to dilution for existing ETH holders. \n5.  **It‚Äôs Environmentally Unfriendly.** Mining means using a lot of electricity. \n6.  **It‚Äôs Inefficient.** Most of the money spent on transaction fees leaves the system -- miners are forced to sell the ETH they earn to pay for electricity, hardware, and taxes. \n\nThe fact that Ethereum has seen the adoption it has *despite *all of those challenges is impressive, but they remain real challenges. When I tweeted that ill-fated tweet asking for reasons not to buy ETH, many of the answers centered around one of the above, most commonly the cost of gas and inflation. \n\nPlus, increased demand for Ethereum-based dApps -- more DeFi, more NFTs, more DAOs, more games -- means more transaction fees, but those fees don‚Äôt really accrue to ETH holders. They leak out of the system to cover miners‚Äô real-world, fiat costs in the Proof of Work process. \n\nSo today, ETH‚Äôs price is based on demand for more ETH, like Bitcoin‚Äôs is, and like the dollar‚Äôs is. It isn‚Äôt tied to revenue, like a company‚Äôs is, but it will be soon. \n\n**Proposed Solutions: EIP 1559 and Eth2**\n\nOne of the things that Bitcoin Maximalists like the most about bitcoin is that you can‚Äôt really change it. One of the things they *don‚Äôt* like about Ethereum is that you can change it. It‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs possible.\n\nTwo changes are coming to the Ethereum blockchain that aim to fix the challenges mentioned above.  \n\n**[EIP-1559](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip-1559-faq)** is a proposal that changes how gas fees work by splitting them into two parts -- a base fee and a tip. With EIP 1559, the **base fee is burned** on each transaction and the miner (and soon validator) keeps the tip. It sounds dull, but it‚Äôs huge, because burning will likely make ETH **deflationary**. Plus, the tip allows people who value better block positions to pay more. That might be important for DeFi participants trying to execute an arbitrage, for example. The proposal was approved in March and will go into effect in July (as part of the [London hard fork](https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-london-tour-guide-what-the-eip-1559-hard-fork-promises-for-ethereum)).\n\n**[Eth2](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/)** is an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain itself that will shift consensus from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake and introduce sharding. Eth2 is expected to make Ethereum more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable. The PoS chain, or Beacon Chain, is already live, and is expected to merge with the main chain some time in late 2021 or early 2022. \n\nProof of Stake is a shift in how the network is secured, and who earns rewards. It means that instead of anyone in the world solving math problems to mine blocks, ETH holders can validate block transactions according to how many ETH they hold. Validators secure the network in exchange for yield in the form of tips and newly minted ETH. Ethereum claims that PoS will be more secure because validators will have ETH at stake, which can be destroyed if they try to cheat. Critics claim that staking puts more power into the hands of the people who hold the most ETH, making it less decentralized and therefore less secure. \n\nOn the scalability side, sharding aims to increase throughput, or transactions per second, by 100x by creating 64 shard chains which validate transactions in parallel. Each shard will only need to validate a fraction of the total chain, instead of every miner needing to validate the entire chain today. \n\nAdditionally, third-party Layer 2 solutions, like [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) and [Optimism](https://optimism.io/), are already working to speed up transactions and lower fees by essentially batching transactions off-chain and settling on-chain in one transaction instead of many (there are intricacies, but this is close enough). L2 solutions could increase throughput another 100x, and combining Eth2 and L2 solutions could lead to a 10,000x improvement if the theory plays out in practice.  \n\nTaken together, EIP 1559 and Eth2 could be revolutionary for ETH holders because they improve performance while dramatically altering where value accrues in the Ethereum ecosystem. \n\n**The Future: Triple-Point, Ultra Sound Money**\n\nIn 2019, David Hoffman wrote an essay called *[Ether: A New Model for Money](https://medium.com/pov-crypto/ether-a-new-model-for-money-17365b5535ba)*. If you want to go deeper, you should read it. In it, he cites a 1997 Journal of Portfolio Management paper by Robert Greer, *[What is an Asset Class Anyway?](https://jpm.pm-research.com/content/23/2/86),* which says that there are three asset superclasses: \n\n*   **Capital Assets** are productive and generate value or cash-flow. Examples include equities, bonds, or rentable real estate. \n*   **Transformable/Consumable Assets** can be consumed one time, transformed into another asset, and their consumption produces economic yield. Think energy or commodities. \n*   **Store-of-Value Assets** are scarce, cannot be consumed, just transferred, and their value persists over time and space. Examples include gold, currencies, art, or bitcoin. \n\nHoffman argues that Ether, as Turing complete programmable money, can be *all three* once EIP 1559 and Eth2 go through, and further, can be all three at the same time. He calls this **triple-point money**, referring to the concept in thermodynamics that at the exact right temperature and pressure, a substance can exist as a solid, liquid, and gas at the same time. \n\nHow they occur simultaneously with Ether is beyond the scope here, what‚Äôs important to understand is the three phases in which Ether can exist: \n\n*   **Store of Value.** ETH is locked up as collateral for DeFi transactions. For example, you can put up ETH to secure a loan or to provide liquidity to a DEX. Currently, nearly 10 million ETH are locked in DeFi. \n\n> [![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5c7787a-de0e-4dfb-9a25-3564cb8d9367\\_884x357.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5c7787a-de0e-4dfb-9a25-3564cb8d9367\\_884x357.png)\n>\n> Source: DeFi Pulse\n\n*   **Consumable Asset.** With EIP 1559, gas fees will act like gasoline in a car. Any time something happens on Ethereum, gas needs to be burned, decreasing the overall supply. \n*   **Capital Asset.** Ether acts as a capital asset in a few ways. Owning ETH represents a share of the Ethereum network, like owning equity in a company. Once staked, ETH gives its owner the right to do work for the network by becoming a Validator and a right to collect fees generated by the network.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8195092b-a59a-441e-aba7-d1235da049a9\\_700x501.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8195092b-a59a-441e-aba7-d1235da049a9\\_700x501.png)\n\n*Source: David Hoffman*\n\nSo how does ETH make money? Where does value accrue? \n\nThere are a lot of ways to earn money on your ETH -- staking, yield farming, liquidity pools, validating, and more -- but let‚Äôs look at the simplest, just owning ETH like you‚Äôd own a stock. \n\nOnce EIP-1559 is implemented and the Eth2 merge is complete, value accrues to the people who hold ETH, in a few ways: \n\n*   **Tips and Issuance.** Tips and new issuance go to ETH holders and are retained in the system (net of taxes) instead of going to miners to pay for hardware and electricity.\n*   **Burned Gas.** Burned gas permanently removes supply from the ecosystem, and at certain transaction rates, actually *decreases* the overall supply of ETH each year. \n\nWe‚Äôll get into the implications of those two things in the bull case, but before we do, we need to understand why Ethereum is defensible. Why can‚Äôt another L1 just come in and steal its volume? \n\n### **Legitimacy and Lindy**\n\nSince Ethereum kind of behaves like a business, with the added benefit of its own currency, we can analyze its strategic position like we would a business. It benefits from **brand** and **network effects.**\n\nIn March, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote a post titled *[The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html)*, in which he argues that the real value of any crypto asset comes not from actually owning the thing, but from **legitimacy**. He defines legitimacy like this: \n\n> *Legitimacy is a pattern of higher-order acceptance. An outcome in some social context is legitimate if the people in that social context broadly accept and play their part in enacting that outcome, and each individual person does so because they expect everyone else to do the same.*\n\nIf people believe that other people believe something, it makes more sense for them to believe that thing as well, and act accordingly. On the popular Ethereum podcast *[Bankless](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3cy1YM9fWOByAQdyWbm3EK?si=7DzVUdC7SGe3IbnhL0Vxlg),* hosts Ryan Sean Adams and David Hoffman call legitimacy ‚Äúthe theory of everything for crypto.‚Äù They listed a series of questions people often ask about the space:\n\n*   Why is cryptocurrency trading over $2 trillion dollars?\n*   Why are NFTs valuable? \n*   How come you can‚Äôt fork your own bitcoin and make it valuable? \n*   Why do we have confidence that Ethereum‚Äôs monetary policy will only change towards decreasing inflation? \n\nThe answer to all of them, according to Adams and Hoffman, is legitimacy. \n\nIn the post, Vitalik highlights six ways that legitimacy can come about. Two are particularly relevant here: \n\n*   **Legitimacy by performance**: if the outputs of a process lead to results that satisfy people, then that process can gain legitimacy (eg. successful dictatorships are sometimes described in this way).\n*   **Legitimacy by continuity**: if something was legitimate at time T, it is by default legitimate at time T+1.\n\nPerformance and continuity create the [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect), which says that the **longer something lasts, the longer it can be expected to last.** Something that has been around for a year is expected to be around for another year, but something that has been around for 100 years is expected to be around for another 100 years. \n\nThis is an observable phenomenon. Amazon is more likely to be around in 30 years than a new startup, our kids are more likely to listen to the Beatles than to Olivia Rodrigo, and our grandkids‚Äô grandkids‚Äô grandkids‚Äô are more likely to read Socrates than Dan Brown. \n\nLegitimacy helps explain the Lindy Effect. The longer something has been around, the more people can expect that other people will continue to use it. In the Excel piece, we described a couple more reasons something can be Lindy: \n\n1.  **Quality.** Some things are just better than others, and the quality that allowed them to survive until now will allow them to continue to survive in the future. \n2.  **Network Effects.** As people recognize the quality of a thing and as it lasts longer, more people use it, so more people build on top of it. That creates a [Two-Sided Platform Network Effect](https://www.nfx.com/post/network-effects-manual/). More users attract more developers, more developers attract more users, and so on. \n\nFor Excel, the network effect comes from the fact that developers (people building models) know that other people use Excel, so they build their models there, which means that more people need to use Excel, which means that the next person building a model is more likely to use Excel.\n\nIn Ethereum‚Äôs case, more dApps on Ethereum means more users on Ethereum, and more users mean it makes sense for more developers to build dApps. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdf1256-667c-4798-8ad0-ecaaf6325fbe\\_955x1220.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdf1256-667c-4798-8ad0-ecaaf6325fbe\\_955x1220.png)\n\niOS is an example of Two-Sided Platform Network Effects. The more people who have iPhones, the more likely developers are to make iPhone apps, and the more iPhone apps there are, the more likely someone is to buy an iPhone. In Apple‚Äôs case, this network effect is so strong that it takes a 30% cut of all App Store revenues -- whether through the purchase of an app, or through in-app purchases. \n\nWhile they‚Äôve been doing it for years, that model is starting to show cracks. Fortnite-maker Epic Games is battling Apple in the courtroom over the fees, and just this past week, Twitter was atwitter over the fact that [Apple will make more from ticketed Twitter Spaces than Twitter itself will](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447328/twitter-ticketed-spaces-monetization-stripe-approval). Whether it‚Äôs monopolistic or not, Apple‚Äôs fees feel extractive. \n\nWhat makes Ethereum‚Äôs network effect potentially stronger, and potentially more long-lasting, is that it aligns incentives in a way that traditional software doesn‚Äôt. \n\nBoth users and developers hold ETH -- its the most used token in the Great Online Game -- and benefit from its appreciation. With EIP-1559 and the Eth2 merge, the more ETH is used, the more value accrues to its holders. Additionally, the **more ETH is worth, the harder it is to attack**. \n\nIn *Ether: A New Model for Money,* Hoffman said that fees paid to Ethereum validators act as a wall that protects Ethereum: ‚ÄúThe height of the wall is highly correlated with the total fees produced by the network. The height of the wall is the cost of attacking Ethereum.‚Äù \n\n[Solana‚Äôs](https://solana.com/) [Ben Sparango](https://twitter.com/bennybitcoins?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) took it a step further when we spoke, explaining to me that it‚Äôs in the best interest of everyone involved for the value of the underlying blockchain to exceed the value of all of the dApps built on top of it. If that weren‚Äôt the case, bad actors would be incentivized to spend what it takes to attack the blockchain to drain those dApps of their value. \n\nThe implication is pretty wild: **projects that build on top of certain blockchains are actually financially incentivized to support the value of the underlying blockchain in order to secure their project.** They don‚Äôt pay for AWS or security software; hosting and security is provided by the blockchain. Instead, projects built on Solana may pay out of their Treasury to support the price of SOL, and projects built on Ethereum may pay out of their Treasury to support the price of ETH. \n\nThat‚Äôs a Platform Network Effect unlike any other. It‚Äôs hard to imagine an app voluntarily paying to pump up Apple‚Äôs stock price. \n\nIn traditional software, the [Bill Gates Line](https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/), coined by Ben Thompson, describes what makes something a platform according to Gates: \n\n> *A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it, exceeds the value of the company that creates it. Then it‚Äôs a platform.*\n\nEthereum has a built-in Bill Gates Line. By owning and using ETH, and making ETH more valuable through usage, the value of everybody that uses Ethereum exceeds the value of Ethereum itself. But they‚Äôre also incentivized to make Ethereum more valuable in the process. It blurs the Bill Gates Line by so tightly aligning incentives that the line becomes irrelevant. \n\nImportantly, this wall is also why the narrative is so important, and why **narrative reflexivity** is so powerful in crypto. More demand for ETH doesn‚Äôt just increase prices; it shifts some of the burden of security from builders to investors, heightens the wall, makes the network more secure, increases the attractiveness of building on Ethereum, which makes ETH more valuable, heightens the wall further, and so on. It‚Äôs a narrative-led flywheel. \n\nDefinitionally, then, most of the value accrues to Layer 1 and those who hold the Layer 1 tokens. It makes being the Layer 1 on top of which everything is built the prime spot in the value chain. \n\nBecause of that, and because of Ethereum‚Äôs shortcomings to date, a handful of L1 competitors have sprung up that seek to challenge Ethereum‚Äôs dominance, or at least pick off some of its use cases. \n\n**L1 Landscape**\n\nWhen I first made the connection between Ethereum and Excel, I didn‚Äôt realize just how deep it went. In *Excel Never Dies,*  Ben and I wrote that, ‚ÄúExcel‚Äôs flexibility lets businesses build all sorts of work flows and processes in the humble spreadsheet. That creates an emergent product roadmap for the B2B software industry.‚Äù\n\nThe result is the Unbundling of Excel, which has created software companies collectively worth half a trillion dollars. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c697918-4e7f-4f1b-9893-625b2ec463ed\\_1456x1101.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c697918-4e7f-4f1b-9893-625b2ec463ed\\_1456x1101.png)\n\nSimilarly, a handful of blockchains/L1s are aiming to thrive where Ethereum is weak. As a refresher, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other blockchains are Layer 1 in the Web3 tech stack. For Bitcoin, pretty much everything, aside from Lightning Network, happens at Layer 1. Hold BTC, send BTC, track BTC. For Ethereum, most of the magic comes in the interaction with Layer 2, the application layer. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f18717-bfd3-4d3b-ac4b-755058692f1f\\_1456x791.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f18717-bfd3-4d3b-ac4b-755058692f1f\\_1456x791.png)\n\n*Source: readthedocs.io, examples mine*\n\nThe second layer is where builders create Lego blocks of protocols and smart contracts that can be arranged in countless combinations and formations to do anything from mint art to trade crypto, directly, without the need for a third-party. It‚Äôs also where L2 scaling solutions like Polygon and Optimism live. \n\nWhen I asked Twitter for compelling reasons not to buy Ethereum, other than Bitcoin Maxis, the most common nonsensical responses came from people shilling other L1s. There are a lot of Something Maxis, people who believe their thing is the one and only solution, but I subscribe to the idea that each successful L1 or L2 will focus on what it does best and interoperate with others who do something else best. I‚Äôm a Maximalist Minimalist. \n\nTo be fair, before digging in, I also would have thought that other L1s were the biggest risk to Ethereum. But in talking to people much smarter in the space, and comparing the situation to Excel, I think the most credible L1s are complementary, and that the ones that are trying to compete directly will lose outright. \n\nChief among the direct competitors is Cardano ($ADA). A lot of people in my replies were shilling Cardano. Then I looked at the website: \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa64671-dab4-4264-999b-5fa2f03e8d1f\\_1520x650.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa64671-dab4-4264-999b-5fa2f03e8d1f\\_1520x650.png)\n\n‚ÄúCardano is a blockchain platform for **changemakers, innovators, and visionaries**, with the tools and technologies required to **create possibility for the many, as well as the few**, and bring about positive global change.‚Äù I read and write a lot of words and I have no fucking idea what that means. The whole site has strong Quibi vibes, like seasoned execs heard about the blockchain and tried to make one that woke kids would appreciate. Plus, it‚Äôs trying to compete directly with Ethereum via smart contracts and faster speeds, and is somehow based on peer-reviewed research? ngmi. \n\nOthers, like [Avalanche](https://www.avalabs.org/) and [Hedera](https://hedera.com/) seem to be building for the enterprise. It‚Äôs an interesting approach, but not a huge threat to what Ethereum is going for. \n\nThere are others, though, that are more interesting and less directly competitive, aimed at serving use cases that Ethereum doesn‚Äôt serve well.  If Ethereum sits in the middle of the Pareto Frontier, these others move up or down on the line: \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7734c83-bc8f-4f46-b3b4-ca042656ac57\\_940x235.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7734c83-bc8f-4f46-b3b4-ca042656ac57\\_940x235.png)\n\n*Source: Sino Global Capital, h/t [@luxetveritasil](https://twitter.com/luxetveritas_il)*\n\nThey make trade-offs to optimize for certain characteristics, and potentially use Ethereum as a settlement layer, where its greater security will give whales more comfort holding high-value accounts and digital items. \n\nTwo of the L1s taking this approach that I‚Äôm most interested in are Flow and Solana. \n\n**Flow**\n\nWhen Axiom Labs launched the first NFTs, CryptoKitties, they overwhelmed Ethereum with volume and overwhelmed buyers with transaction fees. In response, the team set up Dapper Labs and created the Flow Blockchain.\n\nDapper Labs, and its NBA TopShot, were the darlings of the recent NFT boom. They recently raised a [round at a $7.5 billion valuation](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-startup-dapper-labs-raising-money-at-over-7-5-billion-valuation), led by Coatue, to continue to build out Flow and expand the ecosystem built on top of it. I‚Äôve talked to a few consumer-focused NFT startups in the past few weeks that are building on Flow with funding from Dapper Labs. It‚Äôs a win-win for both sides -- startups get funding and support from the company that has had the most success scaling NFTs to non-crypto people, and Dapper gets more usage on, and consumers of, Flow. \n\nOn [Invest Like the Best](https://joincolossus.com/episodes/22848496/dixon-the-potential-of-blockchain-technology?tab=transcript), a16z partner [Chris Dixon](https://twitter.com/cdixon) explained how Flow and Ethereum might interoperate: \n\n> *Imagine a world where you're playing a game, it has virtual goods, and those virtual goods are interacting with Flow. But then some of your virtual goods get really valuable. You say, \"You know what? I want to put these in the bank.\" So you move them over to Ethereum, using a trustless bridge, which is a way for NFTs and cryptocurrencies to move across blockchains. And maybe I pay a little bit higher fee on Ethereum, because Ethereum makes a different set of trade offs. It's trading off performance for higher security.*\n\nAs Flow brings more non-crypto people into Web3, both Flow and Ethereum benefit. \n\n**Solana**\n\nThe L1 that I‚Äôm most excited about besides Ethereum is [Solana](https://solana.com/) *(disclosure: I own some SOL)*. \n\nSolana is likely the fastest and lowest cost blockchain in operation, capable of 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), compared to Ethereum‚Äôs current 19 TPS, at a cost of less than one-tenth of one cent. This thread from Sino Global is chock full of information on Solana for the curious. \n\nI spoke to Solana founder and CEO [Anatoly Yakovenko](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko), and he told me that what Solana is trying to optimize for is **instantaneous censorship-resistance over very short periods of time to create fair and open market access to data**. He wants to build the ***execution layer*** for finance, not necessarily competitive with Ethereum, but with the New York Stock Exchange. Where those transactions settle, and where people hold their coins, doesn‚Äôt matter as much to him. \n\nLike Eth2, Solana uses a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, but unlike Eth2 or most of the other scaling solutions, Solana is **single-shard**. Everything happens on the same chain. They achieve that by using something called **Proof of History**, which isn‚Äôt a consensus mechanism but a source of time, or as Anatoly explained it, ‚Äúthe implementation of the arrow of time in math.‚Äù Proof of History uses cryptographic timestamps to sequentially order each transaction that occurs on Solana to provide verifiable ordering without requiring all nodes to agree simultaneously.\n\nThat has obvious use cases in finance. Just as Ethereum users may be willing to pay a larger tip to move up in the block order, Solana makes money through Miner Extractable Value (or MEV). It sounds evil, but it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like Payment for Order Flow, but open to anyone in the world with the right hardware instead of just hedge funds. It‚Äôs hoping to commoditize and democratize what high-frequency traders are able to do today. \n\nThere are also non-financial products building on top of Solana. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F031c8167-4a2e-4e74-badd-39b9aa31d0bf\\_1061x367.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F031c8167-4a2e-4e74-badd-39b9aa31d0bf\\_1061x367.png)\n\n*The Solana Ecosystem*\n\n[Audius](https://audius.co/), the web3 music streaming platform, **builds on both Ethereum and Solana**. It issues and manages the $AUDIO token on Ethereum, but it runs upvotes and likes, things that need high speed and low-cost to work as well as a Web2 counterpart, on Solana, powered by the same engine used by some of the most sophisticated finance professionals in the world. \n\nThat‚Äôs one of the most interesting things about blockchain technology -- the ability to build a super high-performance machine that anyone in the world can plug into and use, even if they could never afford to otherwise. \n\nHere, too, something that I first thought was competitive with Ethereum is actually a complement. By optimizing for a high-speed trading use case not currently possible on Ethereum, Solana is bringing more financial activity on-chain. By enabling microtransactions like votes and likes, on-chain, and improving the user experience for products that also run on Ethereum, Solana is improving the web3 experience and onboarding more users. \n\nPlus, Solana is building compatibility with Ethereum that would allow it to behave like an Ethereum L2, but with the functionality of a L1, including the ability to deposit USD directly at miniscule fees. More on-ramps is net positive for the ecosystem as a whole, and Ethereum sits at the center of the ecosystem. This thread captures the argument well. \n\nIf you come at the king, you best not miss. Just as nothing has killed Excel‚Äôs core use case but plenty of multi-billion dollar companies have built businesses by focusing on specific use cases, none of the ETH-killers are going to kill ETH. To the contrary, given the nature of web3 and how early the ecosystem is, more complements bringing more demand is a positive. \n\n### **The Bull Case for Ethereum**\n\nMore demand and less supply leads to higher prices. More fees accrue to fewer coins. \n\nI‚Äôve written a lot of words up to here, but the bull case for Ethereum is that simple if you believe a few things.\n\n*   **Web3 will continue to grow**. I do. I‚Äôve written about it many times. There are too many smart people building too many crazy things that wouldn‚Äôt be possible without this technology for it not to. \n*   **EIP 1559 and Eth2 will Go Through Smoothly.** This is certainly a risk, but people seem optimistic. \n*   **Ethereum will remain the main L1 for web3.** At this point, Ethereum‚Äôs network effects are too strong to overcome. Developers, users, and even other L1s are building on or compatible with Ethereum. \n\nIf you believe all of those things, then here‚Äôs the bull case. \n\n**Demand Will Go Up**\n\nBetween Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, there was a massive increase in demand across all categories, from DeFi to NFTs to virtual worlds. Transaction fees increased 200x. \n\nAll of that happened while usability was rough and fees were exorbitantly high. As my friend [Jon Wu](https://twitter.com/jonwu\\_) (who you should follow to get smarter on all of this) explained it:\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d712a74-2910-4b27-a443-10390720a33d\\_249x382.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d712a74-2910-4b27-a443-10390720a33d\\_249x382.png)\n\nThis past year was as bad as it‚Äôs ever going to get for Ethereum. It‚Äôs only going to get better from here, for a few reasons. \n\nFirst, assuming everything goes as planned with EIP 1559 and the Eth2 merge, transaction speeds will go up, and gas fees will become both lower and more predictable. **diIt will be easier and cheaper to transact. Lower transaction fees and faster transaction times should lead to more transactions.**\n\nSecond, even if what we just experienced was a bubble, **short-term bubbles are long-term useful**! They attract money and talent to the space, and money and talent will mix to create new products that attract new users and more demand. I‚Äôve seen dozens of pitches from strong teams leaving traditional startups to build web3 products, many on top of Ethereum, in the past couple of months alone. More products and better experiences will attract more users. ETH is an indexed bet on that growth more than a bet on the success of any one project. \n\nStrong trends, lower prices, better experiences, and new products = growing demand. \n\n**Lower Supply**\n\nFor many ETH bulls, this is the crux of the argument: **EIP 1559 means that ETH becomes deflationary**. \n\nBitcoin issuance is capped at 21 million. This has been the strongest bull case for BTC. You can‚Äôt just print more, like the evil central banks, it‚Äôs math, and it‚Äôs capped. It‚Äôs **sound money.**\n\nThe knock against Ethereum is that there is no cap. Theoretically, enough Ethereum users could decide to keep printing ETH and inflating supply. If you‚Äôre going to have an inflationary asset, why not just use fiat ü§Æ amiright? \n\nBut EIP 1559 and Eth2 flip that. With Eth2, new issuance to reward validators is expected to drop dramatically versus Proof of Work rewards. With EIP 1559, by burning ETH in every transaction, assuming a conservative amount of daily transaction fees and that 70% of the gas fee is burnt and 30% is sent as a tip, then more ETH will be burnt than issued every day. Together, **the supply of ETH will actually begin decreasing after EIP 1559 and the Eth2 merge**. \n\nIt‚Äôs better than sound money. It‚Äôs **Ultra Sound Money**. ü¶á üîä\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3fc34c-1ff9-440e-be07-f5ed05dfe3d4\\_640x337.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3fc34c-1ff9-440e-be07-f5ed05dfe3d4\\_640x337.png)\n\nTo understand the numbers, check out the models that Justin Drake built on [ETH Peak Supply](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZN444\\__qkPWPjMJQ_t6FfqbhllkWNhHF-06ivRF73nQ/edit#gid=0) and [The Road to 100M ETH](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XmeYkWEmaaZEUZ078A-lolchzNUrnlUllLkVXSGPzAU/edit#gid=0). \n\nThe implications here are enormous. \n\nDirectly, it means lower supply meeting growing or accelerating demand, which should lead to higher prices. \n\nEven wilder, if people and institutions are holding BTC because of its use as a non-inflationary Store of Value, might they switch to Ethereum instead if the Ultra Sound Money thesis plays out? Could Ethereum flip Bitcoin as the most valuable cryptocurrency? \n\nBut it doesn‚Äôt stop there, because ETH isn‚Äôt just a store of value. \n\n**Value Accrues to ETH Holders**\n\nETH ownership also grants the right to do work for the Ethereum network as a validator and earn a share of fees. \n\nIn Proof of Work, miners need to sell the ETH that they earn to cover costs. Today, that creates a daily sell pressure of 22.3k ETH, according to [another Justin Drake model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TsrdbdusUop4NJbvjGBbOWTUwYH-Jgg1QBkQ5CtY\\_-k/edit#gid=0). That means that every day, 22.3k newly-created ETH, about $50 million worth, are dumped on the market. With Proof of Stake, the only costs are taxes, which Drake assumes to be 50%, and new issuance drops from 13.5k ETH to 2.1k ETH. That leads to a net sell pressure reduction, from 22.3k ETH per day to 2.6k ETH per day. That‚Äôs the equivalent of roughly **$40 million per day in new demand**.\n\nPlus, instead of leaking out of the system, the value accrue to validators. Another [Drake model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FslqTnECKvi7\\_l4x6lbyRhNtzW9f6CVEzwDf04zprfA/edit#gid=0) estimates that people who stake their ETH (meaning lock it up to secure the network) can **earn a 25% APR including new issuance and tips**. \n\nIn sum: \n\n*   Ethereum has strong **network effects** and will remain at the center of the web3 ecosystem as it continues to grow, creating more transactions and more fees\n*   ETH will become a **deflationary asset** as demand for it increases\n*   ETH will become a **capital asset** that earns holders high APR \n\nI don‚Äôt even know how you price that, but of course, [Justin Drake tried](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U9cGxGY3\\_t7m4MEIpjKWtRcA2zRajywaxMCZYqbF9eI/edit#gid=0), putting his best guess somewhere between $13-51k. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04088ff8-fe71-4acc-8b16-9778e6eb66fa\\_1086x284.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04088ff8-fe71-4acc-8b16-9778e6eb66fa\\_1086x284.png)\n\n### **Risks, More Caveats, and a Conclusion**\n\nWhenever you‚Äôre reading Not Boring, you need to remember a couple things: \n\n*   I‚Äôm incredibly optimistic and excited by technology\n*   I have a higher risk tolerance than most\n\nPart of the reason I‚Äôm so bullish on ETH, the asset, is that the potential of Ethereum, the technology, excites me. ETH is a ticket to web3, but it‚Äôs also an excuse to keep going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. What I look for in an investment -- returns + participation + education + fun -- might be completely different than what you‚Äôre looking for. \n\nThis past weekend showed just how volatile crypto can be, and how pegged everything still is to bitcoin. If you were in ETH for a quick trade, this weekend could have been nauseating. If you‚Äôre in it because you want to learn and explore web3, it was a great opportunity to buy more tokens to play the game at half-off. \n\nDespite my overall bullishness, there are real risks ahead for Ethereum, both macro and specific. \n\nOn the macro side, what happens if Tether blows up? What if governments crack down on crypto generally? What if rates rise ahead of schedule and risk assets tank? What if Elon Musk tweets again? One of the scariest things about this past weekend‚Äôs sell-off is that there wasn‚Äôt a clear and obvious catalyst. Crypto markets can be wild. \n\nSomewhere in between the micro and the macro, there‚Äôs a question: **what if people outside of the early adopter set just don‚Äôt really care about decentralization?** What if more centralized solutions like Binance Smart Chain, which comes with a built-in user base of millions of people who trade on Binance, are *decentralized enough* and more performant? \n\nOn the micro side, Ethereum faces some real challenges. What if EIP 1559 doesn‚Äôt go through as planned? What if the Eth2 merge is delayed? What if sharding doesn‚Äôt work as planned, and creates more issues than improvements? One very real possibility is that sharding makes the Legos built on Ethereum less composable, weakening one of the most exciting aspects of the network. \n\nMaybe the biggest issue facing ETH is adoption of fragmented Layer 2 scaling solutions. While L2 solutions hold the potential to dramatically improve performance, they present two main challenges, one to Ethereum, and one to ETH:\n\n*   **Ethereum:** Adoption of fragmented L2 solutions may make composability more difficult, as execution happens in L2, settles on L1, and then goes back to another L2 for another part of the transaction. Ideally, one or two L2 solutions emerge victorious, but a world in which there are a number of L2s may strengthen Ethereum‚Äôs network effect while weakening the product experience. \n*   **ETH.** Layer 2 solutions are called rollups because they roll up a bunch of transactions into one transaction that settles on Layer 1. Maybe 100 transactions happen on L2, and the whole group shows up on L1 as one transaction. That would decrease transaction fees by 100x unless better performance and lower prices from L2 leads to a 100x increase in transactions or L2 handles transactions that represent new demand because they‚Äôre not possible at current speed and prices. \n\nAdmittedly, I don‚Äôt know enough to have a strong opinion on the topic. This is an area for more exploration, and maybe a [future post](https://twitter.com/jillruthcarlson/status/1396686804963631111?s=20).\n\nIf nothing else, I hope this piece changed the way that you think about Ethereum and makes you want to keep exploring for yourself. That‚Äôs the fun here. \n\nNormies are getting ETH-pilled, the narrative is changing, and the most bullish thing for Ether is to be understood.\n\n*Thanks to [Anatoly Yakovenko](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko), [Ben Sparango](https://twitter.com/bennybitcoins), [Jon Wu](https://twitter.com/jonwu\\_), and [Ryan Sean Adams](https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams) for input, and brother [Dan](https://twitter.com/damccormick13) for editing!*", "timestamp": 1625665345, "digest": "ccZME8tpD4rXACIiVf2NTDpdi8I5EqBph1f6gHZ3m8s", "contributor": "0x5507dbd48a5A5bAcE8a6030e878cC4E0af147C33"}

Is that something you might be interested in?\n\nThat‚Äôs pretty much Ethereum. It‚Äôs one of the most fascinating and compelling assets in the world, but its story is obfuscated by complexity and the specter of crypto. \n\nEthereum is so many things at once, all of which feed off of each other. **Ethereum**, the blockchain, is a world computer, the backbone of a decentralized internet (web3), and the settlement layer for web3. Its cryptocurrency, **Ether (ETH)**, is a bunch of things, too: \n\n*   Internet money. \n*   Ownership of the Ethereum network. \n*   The most commonly-used token in the *[Great Online Game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game)*. \n*   Yield-generating. \n*   A Store of Value (SoV). \n*   A bet on more on-chain activity, or the web3 future. \n\nBecause Ethereum is so much at once, it‚Äôs hard to understand. This post is an attempt to help Ethereum be understood. To a group like us, people interested in technology businesses, finance, and strategy, it‚Äôs much more fascinating than bitcoin, but that comes with a tradeoff. It‚Äôs much harder to grok than bitcoin, and because of that, it hasn‚Äôt gotten the mainstream or institutional attention that bitcoin has. \n\nBitcoin is easy. It‚Äôs digital gold. It‚Äôs a Store of Value (SoV). It just kind of sits there. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3679a2a3-d467-4975-8641-f6712310848d\\_484x500.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3679a2a3-d467-4975-8641-f6712310848d\\_484x500.png)\n\nThat‚Äôs its value prop. It‚Äôs immutable and the most decentralized asset in the world. It‚Äôs the OG and the hardest to attack. At this point, your bitcoin will not disappear overnight (although [this post on Tether](https://crypto-anonymous-2021.medium.com/the-bit-short-inside-cryptos-doomsday-machine-f8dcf78a64d3) is illuminating with regards to ways it, and other cryptos including ETH, can be manipulated nonetheless). As long as other people believe in its value, it will continue to be valuable. Technically, upper-case-B-Bitcoin is the blockchain and lower-case-b-bitcoin is the cryptocurrency, but for all intents and purposes, they‚Äôre the same. Bitcoin exists to make and track bitcoin. It‚Äôs very good at what it does.\n\nEthereum is so much more than a cryptocurrency. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúworld computer,‚Äù and the ‚Äúvalue layer‚Äù of the internet. It lets people build apps and products with money baked into the code. If you believe that web3 is going to continue to grow, then you likely believe that over time, Ethereum will become the settlement layer of a new internet. All sorts of transactions, whether they happen on Ethereum, another blockchain, or even [Visa](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/99639/visa-now-settles-payments-in-usdc-stablecoin-ethereum), will turn to Ethereum to exchange funds and keep secure, immutable records. A year ago, I wouldn‚Äôt have said that. \n\nUntil the past year, a lot of Ethereum‚Äôs value existed in a theoretical state, in the ideas of what *might* be possible on a decentralized global internet. Personally, I viewed it as a kind of more interesting thing that was kind of like Bitcoin but smaller and maybe higher upside? As a result, after buying ETH for fun in the 2017 run-up, I sold all 15 of my remaining ETH in June 2020 once I broke even. Lack of understanding = weak hands. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7a97ce6-6f7f-44c6-9ba9-ab7b310c2c6b\\_1008x80.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7a97ce6-6f7f-44c6-9ba9-ab7b310c2c6b\\_1008x80.png)\n\nAs you know, I‚Äôm an idiot.

I‚Äôm starting to. \n\nBetween then and now, a few things have happened that flipped me from moderately curious to both very curious and very bullish: \n\n*   **Use Case Explosion.** DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs have emerged as real use cases for crypto, and have grown spectacularly over the past year.\n*   **Ultra Sound Money.** With the upcoming implementation of EIP 1559, Ethereum will likely become deflationary, knocking out its biggest monetary weakness. \n*   **Eth2.** Ethereum is currently running a test chain that will merge with the main Ethereum chain in about six months. When it does, Ethereum will switch from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), and more value will accrue to ETH holders.\n*   **Narrative.** The narrative around Ethereum is gaining steam and jumping from crypto people to the mainstream. Last week‚Äôs releases from Patrick O‚ÄôShaughnessy, James Wang, and Joe Weisenthal came in hot. This essay is one small additional push. \n\nRight now, **Ethereum is at a narrative inflection point,** and narrative reflexivity is more important for blockchains than for almost any other company or asset.\n\nI‚Äôm increasingly convinced that ETH will be one of the best assets to own over the next five years. Here‚Äôs the bull case in a nutshell: \n\n**Owning ETH is like owning shares in the internet. Demand for ETH will go up with increased web3 adoption, while upcoming changes will decrease the supply of ETH and let more value accrue to holders. It‚Äôs like a tech stock, a bond, a ticket to web3, and money, rolled into one.**\n\nTo make the bull case clear, we‚Äôll need to understand why Ethereum will survive and adoption will grow, how it actually makes money, and the differences between ETH and a tech stock. We‚Äôll cover:\n\n*   **Ethereum is the Excel of Blockchains**\n*   **How Ethereum Makes Money**\n*   **Legitimacy and Lindy**\n*   **L1 Ecosystem**\n*   **The Bull Case for Ethereum**\n*   **Threats, More Caveats, and a Conclusion**\n\nFor ETH to be worth something, and for the bull case to matter, Ethereum needs to survive and grow. It has faced early challenges and competition from purpose-built blockchains, and this past week was scary. Nothing‚Äôs guaranteed. \n\nTo understand why Ethereum isn‚Äôt going to die, let‚Äôs start with an analogy. \n\n### **Ethereum is the Excel of Blockchains**\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff681f94a-7b2c-4f9c-9aa1-b4ffcc765dc7\\_1502x438.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff681f94a-7b2c-4f9c-9aa1-b4ffcc765dc7\\_1502x438.png)\n\nIf you‚Äôre going to be bullish on Ethereum, the first thing you‚Äôll need to believe is that it will be around for a long time, and that more and more people will continue to use it, and that other people also believe those things to be true.\n\nYou‚Äôll be comforted to know, then, that **Ethereum is the Excel of blockchains**. \n\nThat‚Äôs not *exactly* right. The analogy breaks down in places. But for our purposes, it‚Äôs good enough. Start by comparing it to Bitcoin. \n\nBitcoin is like a database. That‚Äôs what a blockchain is -- a distributed ledger of transactions. The Bitcoin blockchain lets people send each other bitcoin (BTC) and tracks who owns which bitcoin at any given time. It can also reward people for securing the database by giving them BTC for turning electricity into solutions to math problems (Proof of Work or PoW). It does one thing really well: track ownership of bitcoin. \n\nBitcoin is kind of like a spreadsheet, and many people compare blockchains to spreadsheets, but that‚Äôs not what I mean when I say that Ethereum is like Excel. I mean that the same elements that have propelled Excel for nearly four decades are present in Ethereum, too. \n\nIt starts with flexibility. Ethereum is a Turing complete, programmable blockchain that lets anyone build full-blown applications using smart contracts. People can build all sorts of decentralized apps (dApps) on top of Ethereum, plugging into the blockchain and the surrounding ecosystem to provide everything from security to identity to payments. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) apps, NFT marketplaces, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and games and virtual worlds can all be built on top of Ethereum, all fueled by the native currency, ETH. \n\nThat flexibility is really hard to do. \n\nIn *[Excel Never Dies](https://www.notboring.co/p/excel-never-dies),* [Ben Rollert](https://twitter.com/benrollert) and I wrote about Excel‚Äôs staying power in a technology landscape that typically sees new products replace old ones every few years. We wrote: \n\n> ***If there is a core product design lesson to learn from Excel, it‚Äôs that combining usability with flexibility is both incredibly difficult and incredibly rewarding‚Ä¶.***\n>\n> *A design principle for developers is to make any one piece of software really good at one specific thing, deliberately constraining its capabilities to a specific domain. **Excel is a truly remarkable exception to this rule - it is something of a choose-a-phone, and clearly hundreds of millions of people do want to compose for it.***\n\nYou could replace ‚ÄúExcel‚Äù with ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äù and it works perfectly. Ethereum‚Äôs early usability challenges are a function of its flexibility. Ethereum is something of a choose-a-phone, and clearly millions of people do want to compose for it. \n\nBeyond the product philosophy, there are some specific similarities between the two: \n\n*   **Turing Completeness**. If something is Turing complete, it means that it can solve any reasonable computational problem. With the introduction of Lambda, which lets users create their own formulas, Excel became Turing complete. With Ethereum, you can write smart contracts that can solve any reasonable problem. \n*   **Composability.** In Excel, ‚ÄúYou can chain functions, passing the output of one function as the input to another, allowing for an enormous number of potential computational pipelines. Each time Excel adds a function, the power and flexibility of Excel is multiplied, since that new function can be chained to a large number of existing functions.‚Äù This is very similar to the idea of composability, or ‚ÄúX Legos,‚Äù on Ethereum. \n\nTogether, Turing completeness and composability mean that you can build smart contracts to compute anything, and then chain them together to build increasingly complex things, more quickly. It takes time to get the engine revving, but it should move quickly once it‚Äôs moving. \n\nThat‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening. After years of building in relative obscurity through the crypto winter, facing doubt that there was any actual use for any of this stuff, 2020 and early 2021 saw an explosion of real use cases for the Ethereum ecosystem. In [Ethereum Announces First Quarter 2021 Results](https://draecomino.substack.com/p/ethereum-q1-2021-results?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNDE3ODEyLCJwb3N0X2lkIjozNjQ5NTU5OCwiXyI6ImpSbXJBIiwiaWF0IjoxNjIxMjQ4OTA1LCJleHAiOjE2MjEyNTI1MDUsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0zMTQ0MDQiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.o5U_ekN2jxy7JRJXtSwxLFhlMZe8Bq113kapI7himAI), [James Wang](https://twitter.com/draecomino) included a Results Table highlighting the year‚Äôs progress:\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe11d1e75-2381-4644-adf8-209135bdb68c\\_982x734.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe11d1e75-2381-4644-adf8-209135bdb68c\\_982x734.png)\n\n***Source:** James Wang, Ethereum Announces First Quarter 2021 Results*\n\nThose are just absolutely massive numbers across a wide range of use cases. This is not one thing. It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúprice go up.‚Äù It‚Äôs a sign of the momentum and composability in the space, where improvements in one area feed directly into improvements in another: \n\n*   Volume traded on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) like Uniswap increased 76x to from $2.3 billion in Q1 2020 to $177 billion in Q1 2021. \n*   Total Value Locked, or the amount of ETH staked in DeFi, increased 64x from $800 million to $52 billion. \n*   Beyond finance, NFT art sales increased 562x from $700k to $396 million. \n\nEthereum usage exploded in Q1, and while NFT sales have slowed, partially as a result of high gas fees and partially because the initial euphoria has died down, DeFi is still going strong: \n\nFrom May 1st through May 22nd, just Uniswap and Sushiswap, the two largest Ethereum-based DEXes, **handled $78 billion in transaction volume**. Q2 will blow Q1 out of the water. \n\nDespite the explosion in activity and transaction volume, though, the question remains: what does that mean for ETH? \n\n### **How Ethereum Makes Money**\n\nI‚Äôve been aware of Ethereum for a long time. I first bought (then sold) ETH in 2017, but it was speculative and I didn‚Äôt get it. The big question mark I had with Ethereum was how it made money. **How does more activity on top of Ethereum translate into a higher price for ETH?**\n\nIn the near future, the answer will be that more transactions mean higher yields for ETH holders and a decreasing supply of ETH. But that‚Äôs not how it works, yet. \n\nLet‚Äôs start with how it works today, look at the challenges of the current model, the proposed solutions, and what it will look like in the future. \n\n*(Note: For a more in-depth explanation, listen to [Justin Drake on Business Breakdowns](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ZXzLELW1489aCjUPHjTO4?si=2d3df8b0977f4d9d))*\n\n**Today**\n\nToday, when you want to transact on Ethereum, you need to use ETH. There are currently around 116 million ETH, and the price is loosely governed by supply and demand. More transactions on Ethereum means more demand for ETH which means higher price, all else equal. \n\nWhen you transact, say if you send another person ETH, a few things happen: \n\n*   You send 1 ETH and the other person receives 1 ETH\n*   You pay gas fees, say .01 ETH\n*   Your account balance on the chain goes down by 1.01 ETH, theirs goes up by 1 ETH\n\nTo keep Ethereum running, it uses a [Proof of Work consensus mechanism](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/#:\\~:text=Ethereum%2C%20like%20Bitcoin%2C%20currently%20uses,certain%20kinds%20of%20economic%20attacks.\\&text=This%20will%20also%20phase%20out%20mining%20from%20Ethereum.) to trustlessly agree on the state of the blockchain. Bitcoin also uses Proof of Work, that‚Äôs where Ethereum got it from, although Bitcoin mining is able to be run on cheaper hardware and has 20x more miners than Ethereum, and is therefore more decentralized.\n\nPoW achieves the same thing as your bank account balance going up and someone else‚Äôs going down when they send you money, except in the place of a centralized bank, there is a distributed network of miners who agree that these transactions occurred and that all balances are updated.\n\nTo do it, miners around the world race to solve increasingly difficult cryptographic problems in order to create a new block on the blockchain containing the new transactions. These problems are typically hard to solve -- read: require a lot of energy -- but [easy to verify](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/269786/what-computational-problems-would-be-good-proof-of-work-problems-for-cryptocurre). When a block is entered into the blockchain, the transactions in it officially become part of the record. Miners who successfully create a block are rewarded with 2 freshly-minted ETH (down from 5 in the beginning) and all the transaction fees within the block. \n\nThose transaction fees, called **gas**, are what people pay to submit transactions to be included in the block. When a user sends someone ETH on Ethereum, or mints an NFT, or does any number of things that need to be validated on-chain, they have to pay a gas fee. That gas fee goes towards incentivizing miners to spend the money required, in the form of hardware and electricity, to solve the puzzle and create the block. \n\nSo currently, the price of Ethereum is based on a combination of supply and demand, and the price it costs miners to secure the blockchain. To participate, you need ETH, and you need to pay the gas. Miners receive ETH in the form of newly-minted supply and your fees. Miners pay for hardware and electricity and taxes, and keep \\~5% of their earnings. Today, most of the value accrues to GPU makers, electric utilities, and the government, with the miner‚Äôs portion competed down to close to 0. \n\n**Challenges**\n\nThere are a bunch of challenges with this system. \n\n1.  **It‚Äôs Slow**. The Ethereum blockchain currently does somewhere around 19 transactions per second. Visa, for comparison, does about 1,700. \n2.  **It‚Äôs Expensive.** The simplest transaction costs about $5 in gas fees, and when I minted [The Great Online Game as an NFT](https://notboring.mirror.xyz/tw9hW87Sd1YXz_IqcvJXIS9pCxSSYBFVtZ2umBOdng0) with [Jack Butcher](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher) a couple weeks ago, it cost nearly $1k to mint and auction it. \n3.  **It‚Äôs Volatile**. Gas fees are based on auction, and change all of the time based on demand. That makes it hard to transact with confidence or predictability. \n4.  **It‚Äôs Inflationary.** Unlike Bitcoin, there‚Äôs no hard cap on the number of ETH that could theoretically be minted, and Proof of Work requires minting a bunch of new ETH, which means growth leads to dilution for existing ETH holders. \n5.  **It‚Äôs Environmentally Unfriendly.** Mining means using a lot of electricity. \n6.  **It‚Äôs Inefficient.** Most of the money spent on transaction fees leaves the system -- miners are forced to sell the ETH they earn to pay for electricity, hardware, and taxes. \n\nThe fact that Ethereum has seen the adoption it has *despite *all of those challenges is impressive, but they remain real challenges. When I tweeted that ill-fated tweet asking for reasons not to buy ETH, many of the answers centered around one of the above, most commonly the cost of gas and inflation. \n\nPlus, increased demand for Ethereum-based dApps -- more DeFi, more NFTs, more DAOs, more games -- means more transaction fees, but those fees don‚Äôt really accrue to ETH holders. They leak out of the system to cover miners‚Äô real-world, fiat costs in the Proof of Work process. \n\nSo today, ETH‚Äôs price is based on demand for more ETH, like Bitcoin‚Äôs is, and like the dollar‚Äôs is. It isn‚Äôt tied to revenue, like a company‚Äôs is, but it will be soon. \n\n**Proposed Solutions: EIP 1559 and Eth2**\n\nOne of the things that Bitcoin Maximalists like the most about bitcoin is that you can‚Äôt really change it. One of the things they *don‚Äôt* like about Ethereum is that you can change it. It‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs possible.\n\nTwo changes are coming to the Ethereum blockchain that aim to fix the challenges mentioned above.  \n\n**[EIP-1559](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip-1559-faq)** is a proposal that changes how gas fees work by splitting them into two parts -- a base fee and a tip. With EIP 1559, the **base fee is burned** on each transaction and the miner (and soon validator) keeps the tip. It sounds dull, but it‚Äôs huge, because burning will likely make ETH **deflationary**. Plus, the tip allows people who value better block positions to pay more. That might be important for DeFi participants trying to execute an arbitrage, for example. The proposal was approved in March and will go into effect in July (as part of the [London hard fork](https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-london-tour-guide-what-the-eip-1559-hard-fork-promises-for-ethereum)).\n\n**[Eth2](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/)** is an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain itself that will shift consensus from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake and introduce sharding. Eth2 is expected to make Ethereum more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable. The PoS chain, or Beacon Chain, is already live, and is expected to merge with the main chain some time in late 2021 or early 2022. \n\nProof of Stake is a shift in how the network is secured, and who earns rewards. It means that instead of anyone in the world solving math problems to mine blocks, ETH holders can validate block transactions according to how many ETH they hold. Validators secure the network in exchange for yield in the form of tips and newly minted ETH. Ethereum claims that PoS will be more secure because validators will have ETH at stake, which can be destroyed if they try to cheat. Critics claim that staking puts more power into the hands of the people who hold the most ETH, making it less decentralized and therefore less secure. \n\nOn the scalability side, sharding aims to increase throughput, or transactions per second, by 100x by creating 64 shard chains which validate transactions in parallel. Each shard will only need to validate a fraction of the total chain, instead of every miner needing to validate the entire chain today. \n\nAdditionally, third-party Layer 2 solutions, like [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) and [Optimism](https://optimism.io/), are already working to speed up transactions and lower fees by essentially batching transactions off-chain and settling on-chain in one transaction instead of many (there are intricacies, but this is close enough). L2 solutions could increase throughput another 100x, and combining Eth2 and L2 solutions could lead to a 10,000x improvement if the theory plays out in practice.  \n\nTaken together, EIP 1559 and Eth2 could be revolutionary for ETH holders because they improve performance while dramatically altering where value accrues in the Ethereum ecosystem. \n\n**The Future: Triple-Point, Ultra Sound Money**\n\nIn 2019, David Hoffman wrote an essay called *[Ether: A New Model for Money](https://medium.com/pov-crypto/ether-a-new-model-for-money-17365b5535ba)*. If you want to go deeper, you should read it. In it, he cites a 1997 Journal of Portfolio Management paper by Robert Greer, *[What is an Asset Class Anyway?](https://jpm.pm-research.com/content/23/2/86),* which says that there are three asset superclasses: \n\n*   **Capital Assets** are productive and generate value or cash-flow. Examples include equities, bonds, or rentable real estate. \n*   **Transformable/Consumable Assets** can be consumed one time, transformed into another asset, and their consumption produces economic yield. Think energy or commodities. \n*   **Store-of-Value Assets** are scarce, cannot be consumed, just transferred, and their value persists over time and space. Examples include gold, currencies, art, or bitcoin. \n\nHoffman argues that Ether, as Turing complete programmable money, can be *all three* once EIP 1559 and Eth2 go through, and further, can be all three at the same time. He calls this **triple-point money**, referring to the concept in thermodynamics that at the exact right temperature and pressure, a substance can exist as a solid, liquid, and gas at the same time. \n\nHow they occur simultaneously with Ether is beyond the scope here, what‚Äôs important to understand is the three phases in which Ether can exist: \n\n*   **Store of Value.** ETH is locked up as collateral for DeFi transactions. For example, you can put up ETH to secure a loan or to provide liquidity to a DEX. Currently, nearly 10 million ETH are locked in DeFi. \n\n> [![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5c7787a-de0e-4dfb-9a25-3564cb8d9367\\_884x357.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5c7787a-de0e-4dfb-9a25-3564cb8d9367\\_884x357.png)\n>\n> Source: DeFi Pulse\n\n*   **Consumable Asset.** With EIP 1559, gas fees will act like gasoline in a car. Any time something happens on Ethereum, gas needs to be burned, decreasing the overall supply. \n*   **Capital Asset.** Ether acts as a capital asset in a few ways. Owning ETH represents a share of the Ethereum network, like owning equity in a company. Once staked, ETH gives its owner the right to do work for the network by becoming a Validator and a right to collect fees generated by the network.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8195092b-a59a-441e-aba7-d1235da049a9\\_700x501.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8195092b-a59a-441e-aba7-d1235da049a9\\_700x501.png)\n\n*Source: David Hoffman*\n\nSo how does ETH make money? Where does value accrue? \n\nThere are a lot of ways to earn money on your ETH -- staking, yield farming, liquidity pools, validating, and more -- but let‚Äôs look at the simplest, just owning ETH like you‚Äôd own a stock. \n\nOnce EIP-1559 is implemented and the Eth2 merge is complete, value accrues to the people who hold ETH, in a few ways: \n\n*   **Tips and Issuance.** Tips and new issuance go to ETH holders and are retained in the system (net of taxes) instead of going to miners to pay for hardware and electricity.\n*   **Burned Gas.** Burned gas permanently removes supply from the ecosystem, and at certain transaction rates, actually *decreases* the overall supply of ETH each year. \n\nWe‚Äôll get into the implications of those two things in the bull case, but before we do, we need to understand why Ethereum is defensible. Why can‚Äôt another L1 just come in and steal its volume? \n\n### **Legitimacy and Lindy**\n\nSince Ethereum kind of behaves like a business, with the added benefit of its own currency, we can analyze its strategic position like we would a business. It benefits from **brand** and **network effects.**\n\nIn March, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote a post titled *[The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html)*, in which he argues that the real value of any crypto asset comes not from actually owning the thing, but from **legitimacy**. He defines legitimacy like this: \n\n> *Legitimacy is a pattern of higher-order acceptance. An outcome in some social context is legitimate if the people in that social context broadly accept and play their part in enacting that outcome, and each individual person does so because they expect everyone else to do the same.*\n\nIf people believe that other people believe something, it makes more sense for them to believe that thing as well, and act accordingly. On the popular Ethereum podcast *[Bankless](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3cy1YM9fWOByAQdyWbm3EK?si=7DzVUdC7SGe3IbnhL0Vxlg),* hosts Ryan Sean Adams and David Hoffman call legitimacy ‚Äúthe theory of everything for crypto.‚Äù They listed a series of questions people often ask about the space:\n\n*   Why is cryptocurrency trading over $2 trillion dollars?\n*   Why are NFTs valuable? \n*   How come you can‚Äôt fork your own bitcoin and make it valuable? \n*   Why do we have confidence that Ethereum‚Äôs monetary policy will only change towards decreasing inflation? \n\nThe answer to all of them, according to Adams and Hoffman, is legitimacy. \n\nIn the post, Vitalik highlights six ways that legitimacy can come about. Two are particularly relevant here: \n\n*   **Legitimacy by performance**: if the outputs of a process lead to results that satisfy people, then that process can gain legitimacy (eg. successful dictatorships are sometimes described in this way).\n*   **Legitimacy by continuity**: if something was legitimate at time T, it is by default legitimate at time T+1.\n\nPerformance and continuity create the [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect), which says that the **longer something lasts, the longer it can be expected to last.** Something that has been around for a year is expected to be around for another year, but something that has been around for 100 years is expected to be around for another 100 years. \n\nThis is an observable phenomenon. Amazon is more likely to be around in 30 years than a new startup, our kids are more likely to listen to the Beatles than to Olivia Rodrigo, and our grandkids‚Äô grandkids‚Äô grandkids‚Äô are more likely to read Socrates than Dan Brown. \n\nLegitimacy helps explain the Lindy Effect. The longer something has been around, the more people can expect that other people will continue to use it. In the Excel piece, we described a couple more reasons something can be Lindy: \n\n1.  **Quality.** Some things are just better than others, and the quality that allowed them to survive until now will allow them to continue to survive in the future. \n2.  **Network Effects.** As people recognize the quality of a thing and as it lasts longer, more people use it, so more people build on top of it. That creates a [Two-Sided Platform Network Effect](https://www.nfx.com/post/network-effects-manual/). More users attract more developers, more developers attract more users, and so on. \n\nFor Excel, the network effect comes from the fact that developers (people building models) know that other people use Excel, so they build their models there, which means that more people need to use Excel, which means that the next person building a model is more likely to use Excel.\n\nIn Ethereum‚Äôs case, more dApps on Ethereum means more users on Ethereum, and more users mean it makes sense for more developers to build dApps. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdf1256-667c-4798-8ad0-ecaaf6325fbe\\_955x1220.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdf1256-667c-4798-8ad0-ecaaf6325fbe\\_955x1220.png)\n\niOS is an example of Two-Sided Platform Network Effects. The more people who have iPhones, the more likely developers are to make iPhone apps, and the more iPhone apps there are, the more likely someone is to buy an iPhone. In Apple‚Äôs case, this network effect is so strong that it takes a 30% cut of all App Store revenues -- whether through the purchase of an app, or through in-app purchases. \n\nWhile they‚Äôve been doing it for years, that model is starting to show cracks. Fortnite-maker Epic Games is battling Apple in the courtroom over the fees, and just this past week, Twitter was atwitter over the fact that [Apple will make more from ticketed Twitter Spaces than Twitter itself will](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447328/twitter-ticketed-spaces-monetization-stripe-approval). Whether it‚Äôs monopolistic or not, Apple‚Äôs fees feel extractive. \n\nWhat makes Ethereum‚Äôs network effect potentially stronger, and potentially more long-lasting, is that it aligns incentives in a way that traditional software doesn‚Äôt. \n\nBoth users and developers hold ETH -- its the most used token in the Great Online Game -- and benefit from its appreciation. With EIP-1559 and the Eth2 merge, the more ETH is used, the more value accrues to its holders. Additionally, the **more ETH is worth, the harder it is to attack**. \n\nIn *Ether: A New Model for Money,* Hoffman said that fees paid to Ethereum validators act as a wall that protects Ethereum: ‚ÄúThe height of the wall is highly correlated with the total fees produced by the network. The height of the wall is the cost of attacking Ethereum.‚Äù \n\n[Solana‚Äôs](https://solana.com/) [Ben Sparango](https://twitter.com/bennybitcoins?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) took it a step further when we spoke, explaining to me that it‚Äôs in the best interest of everyone involved for the value of the underlying blockchain to exceed the value of all of the dApps built on top of it. If that weren‚Äôt the case, bad actors would be incentivized to spend what it takes to attack the blockchain to drain those dApps of their value. \n\nThe implication is pretty wild: **projects that build on top of certain blockchains are actually financially incentivized to support the value of the underlying blockchain in order to secure their project.** They don‚Äôt pay for AWS or security software; hosting and security is provided by the blockchain. Instead, projects built on Solana may pay out of their Treasury to support the price of SOL, and projects built on Ethereum may pay out of their Treasury to support the price of ETH. \n\nThat‚Äôs a Platform Network Effect unlike any other. It‚Äôs hard to imagine an app voluntarily paying to pump up Apple‚Äôs stock price. \n\nIn traditional software, the [Bill Gates Line](https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/), coined by Ben Thompson, describes what makes something a platform according to Gates: \n\n> *A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it, exceeds the value of the company that creates it. Then it‚Äôs a platform.*\n\nEthereum has a built-in Bill Gates Line. By owning and using ETH, and making ETH more valuable through usage, the value of everybody that uses Ethereum exceeds the value of Ethereum itself. But they‚Äôre also incentivized to make Ethereum more valuable in the process. It blurs the Bill Gates Line by so tightly aligning incentives that the line becomes irrelevant. \n\nImportantly, this wall is also why the narrative is so important, and why **narrative reflexivity** is so powerful in crypto. More demand for ETH doesn‚Äôt just increase prices; it shifts some of the burden of security from builders to investors, heightens the wall, makes the network more secure, increases the attractiveness of building on Ethereum, which makes ETH more valuable, heightens the wall further, and so on. It‚Äôs a narrative-led flywheel. \n\nDefinitionally, then, most of the value accrues to Layer 1 and those who hold the Layer 1 tokens. It makes being the Layer 1 on top of which everything is built the prime spot in the value chain. \n\nBecause of that, and because of Ethereum‚Äôs shortcomings to date, a handful of L1 competitors have sprung up that seek to challenge Ethereum‚Äôs dominance, or at least pick off some of its use cases. \n\n**L1 Landscape**\n\nWhen I first made the connection between Ethereum and Excel, I didn‚Äôt realize just how deep it went. In *Excel Never Dies,*  Ben and I wrote that, ‚ÄúExcel‚Äôs flexibility lets businesses build all sorts of work flows and processes in the humble spreadsheet. That creates an emergent product roadmap for the B2B software industry.‚Äù\n\nThe result is the Unbundling of Excel, which has created software companies collectively worth half a trillion dollars. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c697918-4e7f-4f1b-9893-625b2ec463ed\\_1456x1101.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c697918-4e7f-4f1b-9893-625b2ec463ed\\_1456x1101.png)\n\nSimilarly, a handful of blockchains/L1s are aiming to thrive where Ethereum is weak. As a refresher, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other blockchains are Layer 1 in the Web3 tech stack. For Bitcoin, pretty much everything, aside from Lightning Network, happens at Layer 1. Hold BTC, send BTC, track BTC. For Ethereum, most of the magic comes in the interaction with Layer 2, the application layer. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f18717-bfd3-4d3b-ac4b-755058692f1f\\_1456x791.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f18717-bfd3-4d3b-ac4b-755058692f1f\\_1456x791.png)\n\n*Source: readthedocs.io, examples mine*\n\nThe second layer is where builders create Lego blocks of protocols and smart contracts that can be arranged in countless combinations and formations to do anything from mint art to trade crypto, directly, without the need for a third-party. It‚Äôs also where L2 scaling solutions like Polygon and Optimism live. \n\nWhen I asked Twitter for compelling reasons not to buy Ethereum, other than Bitcoin Maxis, the most common nonsensical responses came from people shilling other L1s. There are a lot of Something Maxis, people who believe their thing is the one and only solution, but I subscribe to the idea that each successful L1 or L2 will focus on what it does best and interoperate with others who do something else best. I‚Äôm a Maximalist Minimalist. \n\nTo be fair, before digging in, I also would have thought that other L1s were the biggest risk to Ethereum. But in talking to people much smarter in the space, and comparing the situation to Excel, I think the most credible L1s are complementary, and that the ones that are trying to compete directly will lose outright. \n\nChief among the direct competitors is Cardano ($ADA). A lot of people in my replies were shilling Cardano. Then I looked at the website: \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa64671-dab4-4264-999b-5fa2f03e8d1f\\_1520x650.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa64671-dab4-4264-999b-5fa2f03e8d1f\\_1520x650.png)\n\n‚ÄúCardano is a blockchain platform for **changemakers, innovators, and visionaries**, with the tools and technologies required to **create possibility for the many, as well as the few**, and bring about positive global change.‚Äù I read and write a lot of words and I have no fucking idea what that means. The whole site has strong Quibi vibes, like seasoned execs heard about the blockchain and tried to make one that woke kids would appreciate. Plus, it‚Äôs trying to compete directly with Ethereum via smart contracts and faster speeds, and is somehow based on peer-reviewed research? ngmi. \n\nOthers, like [Avalanche](https://www.avalabs.org/) and [Hedera](https://hedera.com/) seem to be building for the enterprise. It‚Äôs an interesting approach, but not a huge threat to what Ethereum is going for. \n\nThere are others, though, that are more interesting and less directly competitive, aimed at serving use cases that Ethereum doesn‚Äôt serve well.  If Ethereum sits in the middle of the Pareto Frontier, these others move up or down on the line: \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7734c83-bc8f-4f46-b3b4-ca042656ac57\\_940x235.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7734c83-bc8f-4f46-b3b4-ca042656ac57\\_940x235.png)\n\n*Source: Sino Global Capital, h/t [@luxetveritasil](https://twitter.com/luxetveritas_il)*\n\nThey make trade-offs to optimize for certain characteristics, and potentially use Ethereum as a settlement layer, where its greater security will give whales more comfort holding high-value accounts and digital items. \n\nTwo of the L1s taking this approach that I‚Äôm most interested in are Flow and Solana. \n\n**Flow**\n\nWhen Axiom Labs launched the first NFTs, CryptoKitties, they overwhelmed Ethereum with volume and overwhelmed buyers with transaction fees. In response, the team set up Dapper Labs and created the Flow Blockchain.\n\nDapper Labs, and its NBA TopShot, were the darlings of the recent NFT boom. They recently raised a [round at a $7.5 billion valuation](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-startup-dapper-labs-raising-money-at-over-7-5-billion-valuation), led by Coatue, to continue to build out Flow and expand the ecosystem built on top of it. I‚Äôve talked to a few consumer-focused NFT startups in the past few weeks that are building on Flow with funding from Dapper Labs. It‚Äôs a win-win for both sides -- startups get funding and support from the company that has had the most success scaling NFTs to non-crypto people, and Dapper gets more usage on, and consumers of, Flow. \n\nOn [Invest Like the Best](https://joincolossus.com/episodes/22848496/dixon-the-potential-of-blockchain-technology?tab=transcript), a16z partner [Chris Dixon](https://twitter.com/cdixon) explained how Flow and Ethereum might interoperate: \n\n> *Imagine a world where you're playing a game, it has virtual goods, and those virtual goods are interacting with Flow. But then some of your virtual goods get really valuable. You say, \"You know what? I want to put these in the bank.\" So you move them over to Ethereum, using a trustless bridge, which is a way for NFTs and cryptocurrencies to move across blockchains. And maybe I pay a little bit higher fee on Ethereum, because Ethereum makes a different set of trade offs. It's trading off performance for higher security.*\n\nAs Flow brings more non-crypto people into Web3, both Flow and Ethereum benefit. \n\n**Solana**\n\nThe L1 that I‚Äôm most excited about besides Ethereum is [Solana](https://solana.com/) *(disclosure: I own some SOL)*. \n\nSolana is likely the fastest and lowest cost blockchain in operation, capable of 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), compared to Ethereum‚Äôs current 19 TPS, at a cost of less than one-tenth of one cent. This thread from Sino Global is chock full of information on Solana for the curious. \n\nI spoke to Solana founder and CEO [Anatoly Yakovenko](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko), and he told me that what Solana is trying to optimize for is **instantaneous censorship-resistance over very short periods of time to create fair and open market access to data**. He wants to build the ***execution layer*** for finance, not necessarily competitive with Ethereum, but with the New York Stock Exchange. Where those transactions settle, and where people hold their coins, doesn‚Äôt matter as much to him. \n\nLike Eth2, Solana uses a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, but unlike Eth2 or most of the other scaling solutions, Solana is **single-shard**. Everything happens on the same chain. They achieve that by using something called **Proof of History**, which isn‚Äôt a consensus mechanism but a source of time, or as Anatoly explained it, ‚Äúthe implementation of the arrow of time in math.‚Äù Proof of History uses cryptographic timestamps to sequentially order each transaction that occurs on Solana to provide verifiable ordering without requiring all nodes to agree simultaneously.\n\nThat has obvious use cases in finance. Just as Ethereum users may be willing to pay a larger tip to move up in the block order, Solana makes money through Miner Extractable Value (or MEV). It sounds evil, but it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like Payment for Order Flow, but open to anyone in the world with the right hardware instead of just hedge funds. It‚Äôs hoping to commoditize and democratize what high-frequency traders are able to do today. \n\nThere are also non-financial products building on top of Solana. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F031c8167-4a2e-4e74-badd-39b9aa31d0bf\\_1061x367.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F031c8167-4a2e-4e74-badd-39b9aa31d0bf\\_1061x367.png)\n\n*The Solana Ecosystem*\n\n[Audius](https://audius.co/), the web3 music streaming platform, **builds on both Ethereum and Solana**. It issues and manages the $AUDIO token on Ethereum, but it runs upvotes and likes, things that need high speed and low-cost to work as well as a Web2 counterpart, on Solana, powered by the same engine used by some of the most sophisticated finance professionals in the world. \n\nThat‚Äôs one of the most interesting things about blockchain technology -- the ability to build a super high-performance machine that anyone in the world can plug into and use, even if they could never afford to otherwise. \n\nHere, too, something that I first thought was competitive with Ethereum is actually a complement. By optimizing for a high-speed trading use case not currently possible on Ethereum, Solana is bringing more financial activity on-chain. By enabling microtransactions like votes and likes, on-chain, and improving the user experience for products that also run on Ethereum, Solana is improving the web3 experience and onboarding more users. \n\nPlus, Solana is building compatibility with Ethereum that would allow it to behave like an Ethereum L2, but with the functionality of a L1, including the ability to deposit USD directly at miniscule fees. More on-ramps is net positive for the ecosystem as a whole, and Ethereum sits at the center of the ecosystem. This thread captures the argument well. \n\nIf you come at the king, you best not miss. Just as nothing has killed Excel‚Äôs core use case but plenty of multi-billion dollar companies have built businesses by focusing on specific use cases, none of the ETH-killers are going to kill ETH. To the contrary, given the nature of web3 and how early the ecosystem is, more complements bringing more demand is a positive. \n\n### **The Bull Case for Ethereum**\n\nMore demand and less supply leads to higher prices. More fees accrue to fewer coins. \n\nI‚Äôve written a lot of words up to here, but the bull case for Ethereum is that simple if you believe a few things.\n\n*   **Web3 will continue to grow**. I do. I‚Äôve written about it many times. There are too many smart people building too many crazy things that wouldn‚Äôt be possible without this technology for it not to. \n*   **EIP 1559 and Eth2 will Go Through Smoothly.** This is certainly a risk, but people seem optimistic. \n*   **Ethereum will remain the main L1 for web3.** At this point, Ethereum‚Äôs network effects are too strong to overcome. Developers, users, and even other L1s are building on or compatible with Ethereum. \n\nIf you believe all of those things, then here‚Äôs the bull case. \n\n**Demand Will Go Up**\n\nBetween Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, there was a massive increase in demand across all categories, from DeFi to NFTs to virtual worlds. Transaction fees increased 200x. \n\nAll of that happened while usability was rough and fees were exorbitantly high. As my friend [Jon Wu](https://twitter.com/jonwu\\_) (who you should follow to get smarter on all of this) explained it:\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d712a74-2910-4b27-a443-10390720a33d\\_249x382.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d712a74-2910-4b27-a443-10390720a33d\\_249x382.png)\n\nThis past year was as bad as it‚Äôs ever going to get for Ethereum. It‚Äôs only going to get better from here, for a few reasons. \n\nFirst, assuming everything goes as planned with EIP 1559 and the Eth2 merge, transaction speeds will go up, and gas fees will become both lower and more predictable. **diIt will be easier and cheaper to transact. Lower transaction fees and faster transaction times should lead to more transactions.**\n\nSecond, even if what we just experienced was a bubble, **short-term bubbles are long-term useful**! They attract money and talent to the space, and money and talent will mix to create new products that attract new users and more demand. I‚Äôve seen dozens of pitches from strong teams leaving traditional startups to build web3 products, many on top of Ethereum, in the past couple of months alone. More products and better experiences will attract more users. ETH is an indexed bet on that growth more than a bet on the success of any one project. \n\nStrong trends, lower prices, better experiences, and new products = growing demand. \n\n**Lower Supply**\n\nFor many ETH bulls, this is the crux of the argument: **EIP 1559 means that ETH becomes deflationary**. \n\nBitcoin issuance is capped at 21 million. This has been the strongest bull case for BTC. You can‚Äôt just print more, like the evil central banks, it‚Äôs math, and it‚Äôs capped. It‚Äôs **sound money.**\n\nThe knock against Ethereum is that there is no cap. Theoretically, enough Ethereum users could decide to keep printing ETH and inflating supply. If you‚Äôre going to have an inflationary asset, why not just use fiat ü§Æ amiright? \n\nBut EIP 1559 and Eth2 flip that. With Eth2, new issuance to reward validators is expected to drop dramatically versus Proof of Work rewards. With EIP 1559, by burning ETH in every transaction, assuming a conservative amount of daily transaction fees and that 70% of the gas fee is burnt and 30% is sent as a tip, then more ETH will be burnt than issued every day. Together, **the supply of ETH will actually begin decreasing after EIP 1559 and the Eth2 merge**. \n\nIt‚Äôs better than sound money. It‚Äôs **Ultra Sound Money**. ü¶á üîä\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3fc34c-1ff9-440e-be07-f5ed05dfe3d4\\_640x337.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3fc34c-1ff9-440e-be07-f5ed05dfe3d4\\_640x337.png)\n\nTo understand the numbers, check out the models that Justin Drake built on [ETH Peak Supply](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZN444\\__qkPWPjMJQ_t6FfqbhllkWNhHF-06ivRF73nQ/edit#gid=0) and [The Road to 100M ETH](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XmeYkWEmaaZEUZ078A-lolchzNUrnlUllLkVXSGPzAU/edit#gid=0). \n\nThe implications here are enormous. \n\nDirectly, it means lower supply meeting growing or accelerating demand, which should lead to higher prices. \n\nEven wilder, if people and institutions are holding BTC because of its use as a non-inflationary Store of Value, might they switch to Ethereum instead if the Ultra Sound Money thesis plays out? Could Ethereum flip Bitcoin as the most valuable cryptocurrency? \n\nBut it doesn‚Äôt stop there, because ETH isn‚Äôt just a store of value. \n\n**Value Accrues to ETH Holders**\n\nETH ownership also grants the right to do work for the Ethereum network as a validator and earn a share of fees. \n\nIn Proof of Work, miners need to sell the ETH that they earn to cover costs. Today, that creates a daily sell pressure of 22.3k ETH, according to [another Justin Drake model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TsrdbdusUop4NJbvjGBbOWTUwYH-Jgg1QBkQ5CtY\\_-k/edit#gid=0). That means that every day, 22.3k newly-created ETH, about $50 million worth, are dumped on the market. With Proof of Stake, the only costs are taxes, which Drake assumes to be 50%, and new issuance drops from 13.5k ETH to 2.1k ETH. That leads to a net sell pressure reduction, from 22.3k ETH per day to 2.6k ETH per day. That‚Äôs the equivalent of roughly **$40 million per day in new demand**.\n\nPlus, instead of leaking out of the system, the value accrue to validators. Another [Drake model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FslqTnECKvi7\\_l4x6lbyRhNtzW9f6CVEzwDf04zprfA/edit#gid=0) estimates that people who stake their ETH (meaning lock it up to secure the network) can **earn a 25% APR including new issuance and tips**. \n\nIn sum: \n\n*   Ethereum has strong **network effects** and will remain at the center of the web3 ecosystem as it continues to grow, creating more transactions and more fees\n*   ETH will become a **deflationary asset** as demand for it increases\n*   ETH will become a **capital asset** that earns holders high APR \n\nI don‚Äôt even know how you price that, but of course, [Justin Drake tried](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U9cGxGY3\\_t7m4MEIpjKWtRcA2zRajywaxMCZYqbF9eI/edit#gid=0), putting his best guess somewhere between $13-51k. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04088ff8-fe71-4acc-8b16-9778e6eb66fa\\_1086x284.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04088ff8-fe71-4acc-8b16-9778e6eb66fa\\_1086x284.png)\n\n### **Risks, More Caveats, and a Conclusion**\n\nWhenever you‚Äôre reading Not Boring, you need to remember a couple things: \n\n*   I‚Äôm incredibly optimistic and excited by technology\n*   I have a higher risk tolerance than most\n\nPart of the reason I‚Äôm so bullish on ETH, the asset, is that the potential of Ethereum, the technology, excites me. ETH is a ticket to web3, but it‚Äôs also an excuse to keep going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. What I look for in an investment -- returns + participation + education + fun -- might be completely different than what you‚Äôre looking for. \n\nThis past weekend showed just how volatile crypto can be, and how pegged everything still is to bitcoin. If you were in ETH for a quick trade, this weekend could have been nauseating. If you‚Äôre in it because you want to learn and explore web3, it was a great opportunity to buy more tokens to play the game at half-off. \n\nDespite my overall bullishness, there are real risks ahead for Ethereum, both macro and specific. \n\nOn the macro side, what happens if Tether blows up? What if governments crack down on crypto generally? What if rates rise ahead of schedule and risk assets tank? What if Elon Musk tweets again? One of the scariest things about this past weekend‚Äôs sell-off is that there wasn‚Äôt a clear and obvious catalyst. Crypto markets can be wild. \n\nSomewhere in between the micro and the macro, there‚Äôs a question: **what if people outside of the early adopter set just don‚Äôt really care about decentralization?** What if more centralized solutions like Binance Smart Chain, which comes with a built-in user base of millions of people who trade on Binance, are *decentralized enough* and more performant? \n\nOn the micro side, Ethereum faces some real challenges. What if EIP 1559 doesn‚Äôt go through as planned? What if the Eth2 merge is delayed? What if sharding doesn‚Äôt work as planned, and creates more issues than improvements? One very real possibility is that sharding makes the Legos built on Ethereum less composable, weakening one of the most exciting aspects of the network. \n\nMaybe the biggest issue facing ETH is adoption of fragmented Layer 2 scaling solutions. While L2 solutions hold the potential to dramatically improve performance, they present two main challenges, one to Ethereum, and one to ETH:\n\n*   **Ethereum:** Adoption of fragmented L2 solutions may make composability more difficult, as execution happens in L2, settles on L1, and then goes back to another L2 for another part of the transaction. Ideally, one or two L2 solutions emerge victorious, but a world in which there are a number of L2s may strengthen Ethereum‚Äôs network effect while weakening the product experience. \n*   **ETH.** Layer 2 solutions are called rollups because they roll up a bunch of transactions into one transaction that settles on Layer 1. Maybe 100 transactions happen on L2, and the whole group shows up on L1 as one transaction. That would decrease transaction fees by 100x unless better performance and lower prices from L2 leads to a 100x increase in transactions or L2 handles transactions that represent new demand because they‚Äôre not possible at current speed and prices. \n\nAdmittedly, I don‚Äôt know enough to have a strong opinion on the topic. This is an area for more exploration, and maybe a [future post](https://twitter.com/jillruthcarlson/status/1396686804963631111?s=20).\n\nIf nothing else, I hope this piece changed the way that you think about Ethereum and makes you want to keep exploring for yourself. That‚Äôs the fun here. \n\nNormies are getting ETH-pilled, the narrative is changing, and the most bullish thing for Ether is to be understood.\n\n*Thanks to [Anatoly Yakovenko](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko), [Ben Sparango](https://twitter.com/bennybitcoins), [Jon Wu](https://twitter.com/jonwu\\_), and [Ryan Sean Adams](https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams) for input, and brother [Dan](https://twitter.com/damccormick13) for editing!*", "timestamp": 1625665493, "digest": "qQGJJDHQju6yJ7n23UuiBZ4-5MBpfzTGF4djpgDC9WQ", "contributor": "0x5507dbd48a5A5bAcE8a6030e878cC4E0af147C33"}

Is that something you might be interested in?\n\nThat‚Äôs pretty much Ethereum. It‚Äôs one of the most fascinating and compelling assets in the world, but its story is obfuscated by complexity and the specter of crypto. \n\nEthereum is so many things at once, all of which feed off of each other. **Ethereum**, the blockchain, is a world computer, the backbone of a decentralized internet (web3), and the settlement layer for web3. Its cryptocurrency, **Ether (ETH)**, is a bunch of things, too: \n\n*   Internet money. \n*   Ownership of the Ethereum network. \n*   The most commonly-used token in the *[Great Online Game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game)*. \n*   Yield-generating. \n*   A Store of Value (SoV). \n*   A bet on more on-chain activity, or the web3 future. \n\nBecause Ethereum is so much at once, it‚Äôs hard to understand. This post is an attempt to help Ethereum be understood. To a group like us, people interested in technology businesses, finance, and strategy, it‚Äôs much more fascinating than bitcoin, but that comes with a tradeoff. It‚Äôs much harder to grok than bitcoin, and because of that, it hasn‚Äôt gotten the mainstream or institutional attention that bitcoin has. \n\nBitcoin is easy. It‚Äôs digital gold. It‚Äôs a Store of Value (SoV). It just kind of sits there. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3679a2a3-d467-4975-8641-f6712310848d\\_484x500.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3679a2a3-d467-4975-8641-f6712310848d\\_484x500.png)\n\nThat‚Äôs its value prop. It‚Äôs immutable and the most decentralized asset in the world. It‚Äôs the OG and the hardest to attack. At this point, your bitcoin will not disappear overnight (although [this post on Tether](https://crypto-anonymous-2021.medium.com/the-bit-short-inside-cryptos-doomsday-machine-f8dcf78a64d3) is illuminating with regards to ways it, and other cryptos including ETH, can be manipulated nonetheless). As long as other people believe in its value, it will continue to be valuable. Technically, upper-case-B-Bitcoin is the blockchain and lower-case-b-bitcoin is the cryptocurrency, but for all intents and purposes, they‚Äôre the same. Bitcoin exists to make and track bitcoin. It‚Äôs very good at what it does.\n\nEthereum is so much more than a cryptocurrency. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúworld computer,‚Äù and the ‚Äúvalue layer‚Äù of the internet. It lets people build apps and products with money baked into the code. If you believe that web3 is going to continue to grow, then you likely believe that over time, Ethereum will become the settlement layer of a new internet. All sorts of transactions, whether they happen on Ethereum, another blockchain, or even [Visa](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/99639/visa-now-settles-payments-in-usdc-stablecoin-ethereum), will turn to Ethereum to exchange funds and keep secure, immutable records. A year ago, I wouldn‚Äôt have said that. \n\nUntil the past year, a lot of Ethereum‚Äôs value existed in a theoretical state, in the ideas of what *might* be possible on a decentralized global internet. Personally, I viewed it as a kind of more interesting thing that was kind of like Bitcoin but smaller and maybe higher upside? As a result, after buying ETH for fun in the 2017 run-up, I sold all 15 of my remaining ETH in June 2020 once I broke even. Lack of understanding = weak hands. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7a97ce6-6f7f-44c6-9ba9-ab7b310c2c6b\\_1008x80.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7a97ce6-6f7f-44c6-9ba9-ab7b310c2c6b\\_1008x80.png)\n\nAs you know, I‚Äôm an idiot. Even after the recent drop, those 15 ETH are worth over $30,000. I missed \\~10x upside. Not as painful as my $2 million [bitcoin mistake](https://www.notboring.co/p/is-blockfi-future-of-finance-2), but still dumb. To be fair, though, you shouldn‚Äôt invest in this stuff unless you understand it, and I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm starting to. \n\nBetween then and now, a few things have happened that flipped me from moderately curious to both very curious and very bullish: \n\n*   **Use Case Explosion.** DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs have emerged as real use cases for crypto, and have grown spectacularly over the past year.\n*   **Ultra Sound Money.** With the upcoming implementation of EIP 1559, Ethereum will likely become deflationary, knocking out its biggest monetary weakness. \n*   **Eth2.** Ethereum is currently running a test chain that will merge with the main Ethereum chain in about six months. When it does, Ethereum will switch from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), and more value will accrue to ETH holders.\n*   **Narrative.** The narrative around Ethereum is gaining steam and jumping from crypto people to the mainstream. Last week‚Äôs releases from Patrick O‚ÄôShaughnessy, James Wang, and Joe Weisenthal came in hot. This essay is one small additional push. \n\nRight now, **Ethereum is at a narrative inflection point,** and narrative reflexivity is more important for blockchains than for almost any other company or asset.\n\nI‚Äôm increasingly convinced that ETH will be one of the best assets to own over the next five years. Here‚Äôs the bull case in a nutshell: \n\n**Owning ETH is like owning shares in the internet. Demand for ETH will go up with increased web3 adoption, while upcoming changes will decrease the supply of ETH and let more value accrue to holders. It‚Äôs like a tech stock, a bond, a ticket to web3, and money, rolled into one.**\n\nTo make the bull case clear, we‚Äôll need to understand why Ethereum will survive and adoption will grow, how it actually makes money, and the differences between ETH and a tech stock. We‚Äôll cover:\n\n*   **Ethereum is the Excel of Blockchains**\n*   **How Ethereum Makes Money**\n*   **Legitimacy and Lindy**\n*   **L1 Ecosystem**\n*   **The Bull Case for Ethereum**\n*   **Threats, More Caveats, and a Conclusion**\n\nFor ETH to be worth something, and for the bull case to matter, Ethereum needs to survive and grow. It has faced early challenges and competition from purpose-built blockchains, and this past week was scary. Nothing‚Äôs guaranteed. \n\nTo understand why Ethereum isn‚Äôt going to die, let‚Äôs start with an analogy. \n\n### **Ethereum is the Excel of Blockchains**\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff681f94a-7b2c-4f9c-9aa1-b4ffcc765dc7\\_1502x438.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff681f94a-7b2c-4f9c-9aa1-b4ffcc765dc7\\_1502x438.png)\n\nIf you‚Äôre going to be bullish on Ethereum, the first thing you‚Äôll need to believe is that it will be around for a long time, and that more and more people will continue to use it, and that other people also believe those things to be true.\n\nYou‚Äôll be comforted to know, then, that **Ethereum is the Excel of blockchains**. \n\nThat‚Äôs not *exactly* right. The analogy breaks down in places. But for our purposes, it‚Äôs good enough. Start by comparing it to Bitcoin. \n\nBitcoin is like a database. That‚Äôs what a blockchain is -- a distributed ledger of transactions. The Bitcoin blockchain lets people send each other bitcoin (BTC) and tracks who owns which bitcoin at any given time. It can also reward people for securing the database by giving them BTC for turning electricity into solutions to math problems (Proof of Work or PoW). It does one thing really well: track ownership of bitcoin. \n\nBitcoin is kind of like a spreadsheet, and many people compare blockchains to spreadsheets, but that‚Äôs not what I mean when I say that Ethereum is like Excel. I mean that the same elements that have propelled Excel for nearly four decades are present in Ethereum, too. \n\nIt starts with flexibility. Ethereum is a Turing complete, programmable blockchain that lets anyone build full-blown applications using smart contracts. People can build all sorts of decentralized apps (dApps) on top of Ethereum, plugging into the blockchain and the surrounding ecosystem to provide everything from security to identity to payments. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) apps, NFT marketplaces, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and games and virtual worlds can all be built on top of Ethereum, all fueled by the native currency, ETH. \n\nThat flexibility is really hard to do. \n\nIn *[Excel Never Dies](https://www.notboring.co/p/excel-never-dies),* [Ben Rollert](https://twitter.com/benrollert) and I wrote about Excel‚Äôs staying power in a technology landscape that typically sees new products replace old ones every few years. We wrote: \n\n> ***If there is a core product design lesson to learn from Excel, it‚Äôs that combining usability with flexibility is both incredibly difficult and incredibly rewarding‚Ä¶.***\n>\n> *A design principle for developers is to make any one piece of software really good at one specific thing, deliberately constraining its capabilities to a specific domain. **Excel is a truly remarkable exception to this rule - it is something of a choose-a-phone, and clearly hundreds of millions of people do want to compose for it.***\n\nYou could replace ‚ÄúExcel‚Äù with ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äù and it works perfectly. Ethereum‚Äôs early usability challenges are a function of its flexibility. Ethereum is something of a choose-a-phone, and clearly millions of people do want to compose for it. \n\nBeyond the product philosophy, there are some specific similarities between the two: \n\n*   **Turing Completeness**. If something is Turing complete, it means that it can solve any reasonable computational problem. With the introduction of Lambda, which lets users create their own formulas, Excel became Turing complete. With Ethereum, you can write smart contracts that can solve any reasonable problem. \n*   **Composability.** In Excel, ‚ÄúYou can chain functions, passing the output of one function as the input to another, allowing for an enormous number of potential computational pipelines. Each time Excel adds a function, the power and flexibility of Excel is multiplied, since that new function can be chained to a large number of existing functions.‚Äù This is very similar to the idea of composability, or ‚ÄúX Legos,‚Äù on Ethereum. \n\nTogether, Turing completeness and composability mean that you can build smart contracts to compute anything, and then chain them together to build increasingly complex things, more quickly. It takes time to get the engine revving, but it should move quickly once it‚Äôs moving. \n\nThat‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening. After years of building in relative obscurity through the crypto winter, facing doubt that there was any actual use for any of this stuff, 2020 and early 2021 saw an explosion of real use cases for the Ethereum ecosystem. In [Ethereum Announces First Quarter 2021 Results](https://draecomino.substack.com/p/ethereum-q1-2021-results?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNDE3ODEyLCJwb3N0X2lkIjozNjQ5NTU5OCwiXyI6ImpSbXJBIiwiaWF0IjoxNjIxMjQ4OTA1LCJleHAiOjE2MjEyNTI1MDUsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0zMTQ0MDQiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.o5U_ekN2jxy7JRJXtSwxLFhlMZe8Bq113kapI7himAI), [James Wang](https://twitter.com/draecomino) included a Results Table highlighting the year‚Äôs progress:\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe11d1e75-2381-4644-adf8-209135bdb68c\\_982x734.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe11d1e75-2381-4644-adf8-209135bdb68c\\_982x734.png)\n\n***Source:** James Wang, Ethereum Announces First Quarter 2021 Results*\n\nThose are just absolutely massive numbers across a wide range of use cases. This is not one thing. It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúprice go up.‚Äù It‚Äôs a sign of the momentum and composability in the space, where improvements in one area feed directly into improvements in another: \n\n*   Volume traded on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) like Uniswap increased 76x to from $2.3 billion in Q1 2020 to $177 billion in Q1 2021. \n*   Total Value Locked, or the amount of ETH staked in DeFi, increased 64x from $800 million to $52 billion. \n*   Beyond finance, NFT art sales increased 562x from $700k to $396 million. \n\nEthereum usage exploded in Q1, and while NFT sales have slowed, partially as a result of high gas fees and partially because the initial euphoria has died down, DeFi is still going strong: \n\nFrom May 1st through May 22nd, just Uniswap and Sushiswap, the two largest Ethereum-based DEXes, **handled $78 billion in transaction volume**. Q2 will blow Q1 out of the water. \n\nDespite the explosion in activity and transaction volume, though, the question remains: what does that mean for ETH? \n\n### **How Ethereum Makes Money**\n\nI‚Äôve been aware of Ethereum for a long time. I first bought (then sold) ETH in 2017, but it was speculative and I didn‚Äôt get it. The big question mark I had with Ethereum was how it made money. **How does more activity on top of Ethereum translate into a higher price for ETH?**\n\nIn the near future, the answer will be that more transactions mean higher yields for ETH holders and a decreasing supply of ETH. But that‚Äôs not how it works, yet. \n\nLet‚Äôs start with how it works today, look at the challenges of the current model, the proposed solutions, and what it will look like in the future. \n\n*(Note: For a more in-depth explanation, listen to [Justin Drake on Business Breakdowns](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ZXzLELW1489aCjUPHjTO4?si=2d3df8b0977f4d9d))*\n\n**Today**\n\nToday, when you want to transact on Ethereum, you need to use ETH. There are currently around 116 million ETH, and the price is loosely governed by supply and demand. More transactions on Ethereum means more demand for ETH which means higher price, all else equal. \n\nWhen you transact, say if you send another person ETH, a few things happen: \n\n*   You send 1 ETH and the other person receives 1 ETH\n*   You pay gas fees, say .01 ETH\n*   Your account balance on the chain goes down by 1.01 ETH, theirs goes up by 1 ETH\n\nTo keep Ethereum running, it uses a [Proof of Work consensus mechanism](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/#:\\~:text=Ethereum%2C%20like%20Bitcoin%2C%20currently%20uses,certain%20kinds%20of%20economic%20attacks.\\&text=This%20will%20also%20phase%20out%20mining%20from%20Ethereum.) to trustlessly agree on the state of the blockchain. Bitcoin also uses Proof of Work, that‚Äôs where Ethereum got it from, although Bitcoin mining is able to be run on cheaper hardware and has 20x more miners than Ethereum, and is therefore more decentralized.\n\nPoW achieves the same thing as your bank account balance going up and someone else‚Äôs going down when they send you money, except in the place of a centralized bank, there is a distributed network of miners who agree that these transactions occurred and that all balances are updated.\n\nTo do it, miners around the world race to solve increasingly difficult cryptographic problems in order to create a new block on the blockchain containing the new transactions. These problems are typically hard to solve -- read: require a lot of energy -- but [easy to verify](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/269786/what-computational-problems-would-be-good-proof-of-work-problems-for-cryptocurre). When a block is entered into the blockchain, the transactions in it officially become part of the record. Miners who successfully create a block are rewarded with 2 freshly-minted ETH (down from 5 in the beginning) and all the transaction fees within the block. \n\nThose transaction fees, called **gas**, are what people pay to submit transactions to be included in the block. When a user sends someone ETH on Ethereum, or mints an NFT, or does any number of things that need to be validated on-chain, they have to pay a gas fee. That gas fee goes towards incentivizing miners to spend the money required, in the form of hardware and electricity, to solve the puzzle and create the block. \n\nSo currently, the price of Ethereum is based on a combination of supply and demand, and the price it costs miners to secure the blockchain. To participate, you need ETH, and you need to pay the gas. Miners receive ETH in the form of newly-minted supply and your fees. Miners pay for hardware and electricity and taxes, and keep \\~5% of their earnings. Today, most of the value accrues to GPU makers, electric utilities, and the government, with the miner‚Äôs portion competed down to close to 0. \n\n**Challenges**\n\nThere are a bunch of challenges with this system. \n\n1.  **It‚Äôs Slow**. The Ethereum blockchain currently does somewhere around 19 transactions per second. Visa, for comparison, does about 1,700. \n2.  **It‚Äôs Expensive.** The simplest transaction costs about $5 in gas fees, and when I minted [The Great Online Game as an NFT](https://notboring.mirror.xyz/tw9hW87Sd1YXz_IqcvJXIS9pCxSSYBFVtZ2umBOdng0) with [Jack Butcher](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher) a couple weeks ago, it cost nearly $1k to mint and auction it. \n3.  **It‚Äôs Volatile**. Gas fees are based on auction, and change all of the time based on demand. That makes it hard to transact with confidence or predictability. \n4.  **It‚Äôs Inflationary.** Unlike Bitcoin, there‚Äôs no hard cap on the number of ETH that could theoretically be minted, and Proof of Work requires minting a bunch of new ETH, which means growth leads to dilution for existing ETH holders. \n5.  **It‚Äôs Environmentally Unfriendly.** Mining means using a lot of electricity. \n6.  **It‚Äôs Inefficient.** Most of the money spent on transaction fees leaves the system -- miners are forced to sell the ETH they earn to pay for electricity, hardware, and taxes. \n\nThe fact that Ethereum has seen the adoption it has *despite *all of those challenges is impressive, but they remain real challenges. When I tweeted that ill-fated tweet asking for reasons not to buy ETH, many of the answers centered around one of the above, most commonly the cost of gas and inflation. \n\nPlus, increased demand for Ethereum-based dApps -- more DeFi, more NFTs, more DAOs, more games -- means more transaction fees, but those fees don‚Äôt really accrue to ETH holders. They leak out of the system to cover miners‚Äô real-world, fiat costs in the Proof of Work process. \n\nSo today, ETH‚Äôs price is based on demand for more ETH, like Bitcoin‚Äôs is, and like the dollar‚Äôs is. It isn‚Äôt tied to revenue, like a company‚Äôs is, but it will be soon. \n\n**Proposed Solutions: EIP 1559 and Eth2**\n\nOne of the things that Bitcoin Maximalists like the most about bitcoin is that you can‚Äôt really change it. One of the things they *don‚Äôt* like about Ethereum is that you can change it. It‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs possible.\n\nTwo changes are coming to the Ethereum blockchain that aim to fix the challenges mentioned above.  \n\n**[EIP-1559](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip-1559-faq)** is a proposal that changes how gas fees work by splitting them into two parts -- a base fee and a tip. With EIP 1559, the **base fee is burned** on each transaction and the miner (and soon validator) keeps the tip. It sounds dull, but it‚Äôs huge, because burning will likely make ETH **deflationary**. Plus, the tip allows people who value better block positions to pay more. That might be important for DeFi participants trying to execute an arbitrage, for example. The proposal was approved in March and will go into effect in July (as part of the [London hard fork](https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-london-tour-guide-what-the-eip-1559-hard-fork-promises-for-ethereum)).\n\n**[Eth2](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/)** is an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain itself that will shift consensus from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake and introduce sharding. Eth2 is expected to make Ethereum more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable. The PoS chain, or Beacon Chain, is already live, and is expected to merge with the main chain some time in late 2021 or early 2022. \n\nProof of Stake is a shift in how the network is secured, and who earns rewards. It means that instead of anyone in the world solving math problems to mine blocks, ETH holders can validate block transactions according to how many ETH they hold. Validators secure the network in exchange for yield in the form of tips and newly minted ETH. Ethereum claims that PoS will be more secure because validators will have ETH at stake, which can be destroyed if they try to cheat. Critics claim that staking puts more power into the hands of the people who hold the most ETH, making it less decentralized and therefore less secure. \n\nOn the scalability side, sharding aims to increase throughput, or transactions per second, by 100x by creating 64 shard chains which validate transactions in parallel. Each shard will only need to validate a fraction of the total chain, instead of every miner needing to validate the entire chain today. \n\nAdditionally, third-party Layer 2 solutions, like [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) and [Optimism](https://optimism.io/), are already working to speed up transactions and lower fees by essentially batching transactions off-chain and settling on-chain in one transaction instead of many (there are intricacies, but this is close enough). L2 solutions could increase throughput another 100x, and combining Eth2 and L2 solutions could lead to a 10,000x improvement if the theory plays out in practice.  \n\nTaken together, EIP 1559 and Eth2 could be revolutionary for ETH holders because they improve performance while dramatically altering where value accrues in the Ethereum ecosystem. \n\n**The Future: Triple-Point, Ultra Sound Money**\n\nIn 2019, David Hoffman wrote an essay called *[Ether: A New Model for Money](https://medium.com/pov-crypto/ether-a-new-model-for-money-17365b5535ba)*. If you want to go deeper, you should read it. In it, he cites a 1997 Journal of Portfolio Management paper by Robert Greer, *[What is an Asset Class Anyway?](https://jpm.pm-research.com/content/23/2/86),* which says that there are three asset superclasses: \n\n*   **Capital Assets** are productive and generate value or cash-flow. Examples include equities, bonds, or rentable real estate. \n*   **Transformable/Consumable Assets** can be consumed one time, transformed into another asset, and their consumption produces economic yield. Think energy or commodities. \n*   **Store-of-Value Assets** are scarce, cannot be consumed, just transferred, and their value persists over time and space. Examples include gold, currencies, art, or bitcoin. \n\nHoffman argues that Ether, as Turing complete programmable money, can be *all three* once EIP 1559 and Eth2 go through, and further, can be all three at the same time. He calls this **triple-point money**, referring to the concept in thermodynamics that at the exact right temperature and pressure, a substance can exist as a solid, liquid, and gas at the same time. \n\nHow they occur simultaneously with Ether is beyond the scope here, what‚Äôs important to understand is the three phases in which Ether can exist: \n\n*   **Store of Value.** ETH is locked up as collateral for DeFi transactions. For example, you can put up ETH to secure a loan or to provide liquidity to a DEX. Currently, nearly 10 million ETH are locked in DeFi. \n*   **Consumable Asset.** With EIP 1559, gas fees will act like gasoline in a car. Any time something happens on Ethereum, gas needs to be burned, decreasing the overall supply. \n*   **Capital Asset.** Ether acts as a capital asset in a few ways. Owning ETH represents a share of the Ethereum network, like owning equity in a company. Once staked, ETH gives its owner the right to do work for the network by becoming a Validator and a right to collect fees generated by the network.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8195092b-a59a-441e-aba7-d1235da049a9\\_700x501.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8195092b-a59a-441e-aba7-d1235da049a9\\_700x501.png)\n\n*Source: David Hoffman*\n\nSo how does ETH make money? Where does value accrue? \n\nThere are a lot of ways to earn money on your ETH -- staking, yield farming, liquidity pools, validating, and more -- but let‚Äôs look at the simplest, just owning ETH like you‚Äôd own a stock. \n\nOnce EIP-1559 is implemented and the Eth2 merge is complete, value accrues to the people who hold ETH, in a few ways: \n\n*   **Tips and Issuance.** Tips and new issuance go to ETH holders and are retained in the system (net of taxes) instead of going to miners to pay for hardware and electricity.\n*   **Burned Gas.** Burned gas permanently removes supply from the ecosystem, and at certain transaction rates, actually *decreases* the overall supply of ETH each year. \n\nWe‚Äôll get into the implications of those two things in the bull case, but before we do, we need to understand why Ethereum is defensible. Why can‚Äôt another L1 just come in and steal its volume? \n\n### **Legitimacy and Lindy**\n\nSince Ethereum kind of behaves like a business, with the added benefit of its own currency, we can analyze its strategic position like we would a business. It benefits from **brand** and **network effects.**\n\nIn March, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote a post titled *[The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html)*, in which he argues that the real value of any crypto asset comes not from actually owning the thing, but from **legitimacy**. He defines legitimacy like this: \n\n> *Legitimacy is a pattern of higher-order acceptance. An outcome in some social context is legitimate if the people in that social context broadly accept and play their part in enacting that outcome, and each individual person does so because they expect everyone else to do the same.*\n\nIf people believe that other people believe something, it makes more sense for them to believe that thing as well, and act accordingly. On the popular Ethereum podcast *[Bankless](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3cy1YM9fWOByAQdyWbm3EK?si=7DzVUdC7SGe3IbnhL0Vxlg),* hosts Ryan Sean Adams and David Hoffman call legitimacy ‚Äúthe theory of everything for crypto.‚Äù They listed a series of questions people often ask about the space:\n\n*   Why is cryptocurrency trading over $2 trillion dollars?\n*   Why are NFTs valuable? \n*   How come you can‚Äôt fork your own bitcoin and make it valuable? \n*   Why do we have confidence that Ethereum‚Äôs monetary policy will only change towards decreasing inflation? \n\nThe answer to all of them, according to Adams and Hoffman, is legitimacy. \n\nIn the post, Vitalik highlights six ways that legitimacy can come about. Two are particularly relevant here: \n\n*   **Legitimacy by performance**: if the outputs of a process lead to results that satisfy people, then that process can gain legitimacy (eg. successful dictatorships are sometimes described in this way).\n*   **Legitimacy by continuity**: if something was legitimate at time T, it is by default legitimate at time T+1.\n\nPerformance and continuity create the [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect), which says that the **longer something lasts, the longer it can be expected to last.** Something that has been around for a year is expected to be around for another year, but something that has been around for 100 years is expected to be around for another 100 years. \n\nThis is an observable phenomenon. Amazon is more likely to be around in 30 years than a new startup, our kids are more likely to listen to the Beatles than to Olivia Rodrigo, and our grandkids‚Äô grandkids‚Äô grandkids‚Äô are more likely to read Socrates than Dan Brown. \n\nLegitimacy helps explain the Lindy Effect. The longer something has been around, the more people can expect that other people will continue to use it. In the Excel piece, we described a couple more reasons something can be Lindy: \n\n1.  **Quality.** Some things are just better than others, and the quality that allowed them to survive until now will allow them to continue to survive in the future. \n2.  **Network Effects.** As people recognize the quality of a thing and as it lasts longer, more people use it, so more people build on top of it. That creates a [Two-Sided Platform Network Effect](https://www.nfx.com/post/network-effects-manual/). More users attract more developers, more developers attract more users, and so on. \n\nFor Excel, the network effect comes from the fact that developers (people building models) know that other people use Excel, so they build their models there, which means that more people need to use Excel, which means that the next person building a model is more likely to use Excel.\n\nIn Ethereum‚Äôs case, more dApps on Ethereum means more users on Ethereum, and more users mean it makes sense for more developers to build dApps. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdf1256-667c-4798-8ad0-ecaaf6325fbe\\_955x1220.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdf1256-667c-4798-8ad0-ecaaf6325fbe\\_955x1220.png)\n\niOS is an example of Two-Sided Platform Network Effects. The more people who have iPhones, the more likely developers are to make iPhone apps, and the more iPhone apps there are, the more likely someone is to buy an iPhone. In Apple‚Äôs case, this network effect is so strong that it takes a 30% cut of all App Store revenues -- whether through the purchase of an app, or through in-app purchases. \n\nWhile they‚Äôve been doing it for years, that model is starting to show cracks. Fortnite-maker Epic Games is battling Apple in the courtroom over the fees, and just this past week, Twitter was atwitter over the fact that [Apple will make more from ticketed Twitter Spaces than Twitter itself will](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447328/twitter-ticketed-spaces-monetization-stripe-approval). Whether it‚Äôs monopolistic or not, Apple‚Äôs fees feel extractive. \n\nWhat makes Ethereum‚Äôs network effect potentially stronger, and potentially more long-lasting, is that it aligns incentives in a way that traditional software doesn‚Äôt. \n\nBoth users and developers hold ETH -- its the most used token in the Great Online Game -- and benefit from its appreciation. With EIP-1559 and the Eth2 merge, the more ETH is used, the more value accrues to its holders. Additionally, the **more ETH is worth, the harder it is to attack**. \n\nIn *Ether: A New Model for Money,* Hoffman said that fees paid to Ethereum validators act as a wall that protects Ethereum: ‚ÄúThe height of the wall is highly correlated with the total fees produced by the network. The height of the wall is the cost of attacking Ethereum.‚Äù \n\n[Solana‚Äôs](https://solana.com/) [Ben Sparango](https://twitter.com/bennybitcoins?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) took it a step further when we spoke, explaining to me that it‚Äôs in the best interest of everyone involved for the value of the underlying blockchain to exceed the value of all of the dApps built on top of it. If that weren‚Äôt the case, bad actors would be incentivized to spend what it takes to attack the blockchain to drain those dApps of their value. \n\nThe implication is pretty wild: **projects that build on top of certain blockchains are actually financially incentivized to support the value of the underlying blockchain in order to secure their project.** They don‚Äôt pay for AWS or security software; hosting and security is provided by the blockchain. Instead, projects built on Solana may pay out of their Treasury to support the price of SOL, and projects built on Ethereum may pay out of their Treasury to support the price of ETH. \n\nThat‚Äôs a Platform Network Effect unlike any other. It‚Äôs hard to imagine an app voluntarily paying to pump up Apple‚Äôs stock price. \n\nIn traditional software, the [Bill Gates Line](https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/), coined by Ben Thompson, describes what makes something a platform according to Gates: \n\n> *A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it, exceeds the value of the company that creates it. Then it‚Äôs a platform.*\n\nEthereum has a built-in Bill Gates Line. By owning and using ETH, and making ETH more valuable through usage, the value of everybody that uses Ethereum exceeds the value of Ethereum itself. But they‚Äôre also incentivized to make Ethereum more valuable in the process. It blurs the Bill Gates Line by so tightly aligning incentives that the line becomes irrelevant. \n\nImportantly, this wall is also why the narrative is so important, and why **narrative reflexivity** is so powerful in crypto. More demand for ETH doesn‚Äôt just increase prices; it shifts some of the burden of security from builders to investors, heightens the wall, makes the network more secure, increases the attractiveness of building on Ethereum, which makes ETH more valuable, heightens the wall further, and so on. It‚Äôs a narrative-led flywheel. \n\nDefinitionally, then, most of the value accrues to Layer 1 and those who hold the Layer 1 tokens. It makes being the Layer 1 on top of which everything is built the prime spot in the value chain. \n\nBecause of that, and because of Ethereum‚Äôs shortcomings to date, a handful of L1 competitors have sprung up that seek to challenge Ethereum‚Äôs dominance, or at least pick off some of its use cases. \n\n**L1 Landscape**\n\nWhen I first made the connection between Ethereum and Excel, I didn‚Äôt realize just how deep it went. In *Excel Never Dies,*  Ben and I wrote that, ‚ÄúExcel‚Äôs flexibility lets businesses build all sorts of work flows and processes in the humble spreadsheet. That creates an emergent product roadmap for the B2B software industry.‚Äù\n\nThe result is the Unbundling of Excel, which has created software companies collectively worth half a trillion dollars. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c697918-4e7f-4f1b-9893-625b2ec463ed\\_1456x1101.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c697918-4e7f-4f1b-9893-625b2ec463ed\\_1456x1101.png)\n\nSimilarly, a handful of blockchains/L1s are aiming to thrive where Ethereum is weak. As a refresher, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other blockchains are Layer 1 in the Web3 tech stack. For Bitcoin, pretty much everything, aside from Lightning Network, happens at Layer 1. Hold BTC, send BTC, track BTC. For Ethereum, most of the magic comes in the interaction with Layer 2, the application layer. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f18717-bfd3-4d3b-ac4b-755058692f1f\\_1456x791.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f18717-bfd3-4d3b-ac4b-755058692f1f\\_1456x791.png)\n\n*Source: readthedocs.io, examples mine*\n\nThe second layer is where builders create Lego blocks of protocols and smart contracts that can be arranged in countless combinations and formations to do anything from mint art to trade crypto, directly, without the need for a third-party. It‚Äôs also where L2 scaling solutions like Polygon and Optimism live. \n\nWhen I asked Twitter for compelling reasons not to buy Ethereum, other than Bitcoin Maxis, the most common nonsensical responses came from people shilling other L1s. There are a lot of Something Maxis, people who believe their thing is the one and only solution, but I subscribe to the idea that each successful L1 or L2 will focus on what it does best and interoperate with others who do something else best. I‚Äôm a Maximalist Minimalist. \n\nTo be fair, before digging in, I also would have thought that other L1s were the biggest risk to Ethereum. But in talking to people much smarter in the space, and comparing the situation to Excel, I think the most credible L1s are complementary, and that the ones that are trying to compete directly will lose outright. \n\nChief among the direct competitors is Cardano ($ADA). A lot of people in my replies were shilling Cardano. Then I looked at the website: \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa64671-dab4-4264-999b-5fa2f03e8d1f\\_1520x650.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa64671-dab4-4264-999b-5fa2f03e8d1f\\_1520x650.png)\n\n‚ÄúCardano is a blockchain platform for **changemakers, innovators, and visionaries**, with the tools and technologies required to **create possibility for the many, as well as the few**, and bring about positive global change.‚Äù I read and write a lot of words and I have no fucking idea what that means. The whole site has strong Quibi vibes, like seasoned execs heard about the blockchain and tried to make one that woke kids would appreciate. Plus, it‚Äôs trying to compete directly with Ethereum via smart contracts and faster speeds, and is somehow based on peer-reviewed research? ngmi. \n\nOthers, like [Avalanche](https://www.avalabs.org/) and [Hedera](https://hedera.com/) seem to be building for the enterprise. It‚Äôs an interesting approach, but not a huge threat to what Ethereum is going for. \n\nThere are others, though, that are more interesting and less directly competitive, aimed at serving use cases that Ethereum doesn‚Äôt serve well.  If Ethereum sits in the middle of the Pareto Frontier, these others move up or down on the line: \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7734c83-bc8f-4f46-b3b4-ca042656ac57\\_940x235.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7734c83-bc8f-4f46-b3b4-ca042656ac57\\_940x235.png)\n\n*Source: Sino Global Capital, h/t [@luxetveritasil](https://twitter.com/luxetveritas_il)*\n\nThey make trade-offs to optimize for certain characteristics, and potentially use Ethereum as a settlement layer, where its greater security will give whales more comfort holding high-value accounts and digital items. \n\nTwo of the L1s taking this approach that I‚Äôm most interested in are Flow and Solana. \n\n**Flow**\n\nWhen Axiom Labs launched the first NFTs, CryptoKitties, they overwhelmed Ethereum with volume and overwhelmed buyers with transaction fees. In response, the team set up Dapper Labs and created the Flow Blockchain.\n\nDapper Labs, and its NBA TopShot, were the darlings of the recent NFT boom. They recently raised a [round at a $7.5 billion valuation](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-startup-dapper-labs-raising-money-at-over-7-5-billion-valuation), led by Coatue, to continue to build out Flow and expand the ecosystem built on top of it. I‚Äôve talked to a few consumer-focused NFT startups in the past few weeks that are building on Flow with funding from Dapper Labs. It‚Äôs a win-win for both sides -- startups get funding and support from the company that has had the most success scaling NFTs to non-crypto people, and Dapper gets more usage on, and consumers of, Flow. \n\nOn [Invest Like the Best](https://joincolossus.com/episodes/22848496/dixon-the-potential-of-blockchain-technology?tab=transcript), a16z partner [Chris Dixon](https://twitter.com/cdixon) explained how Flow and Ethereum might interoperate: \n\n> *Imagine a world where you're playing a game, it has virtual goods, and those virtual goods are interacting with Flow. But then some of your virtual goods get really valuable. You say, \"You know what? I want to put these in the bank.\" So you move them over to Ethereum, using a trustless bridge, which is a way for NFTs and cryptocurrencies to move across blockchains. And maybe I pay a little bit higher fee on Ethereum, because Ethereum makes a different set of trade offs. It's trading off performance for higher security.*\n\nAs Flow brings more non-crypto people into Web3, both Flow and Ethereum benefit. \n\n**Solana**\n\nThe L1 that I‚Äôm most excited about besides Ethereum is [Solana](https://solana.com/) *(disclosure: I own some SOL)*. \n\nSolana is likely the fastest and lowest cost blockchain in operation, capable of 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), compared to Ethereum‚Äôs current 19 TPS, at a cost of less than one-tenth of one cent. This thread from Sino Global is chock full of information on Solana for the curious. \n\nI spoke to Solana founder and CEO [Anatoly Yakovenko](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko), and he told me that what Solana is trying to optimize for is **instantaneous censorship-resistance over very short periods of time to create fair and open market access to data**. He wants to build the ***execution layer*** for finance, not necessarily competitive with Ethereum, but with the New York Stock Exchange. Where those transactions settle, and where people hold their coins, doesn‚Äôt matter as much to him. \n\nLike Eth2, Solana uses a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, but unlike Eth2 or most of the other scaling solutions, Solana is **single-shard**. Everything happens on the same chain. They achieve that by using something called **Proof of History**, which isn‚Äôt a consensus mechanism but a source of time, or as Anatoly explained it, ‚Äúthe implementation of the arrow of time in math.‚Äù Proof of History uses cryptographic timestamps to sequentially order each transaction that occurs on Solana to provide verifiable ordering without requiring all nodes to agree simultaneously.\n\nThat has obvious use cases in finance. Just as Ethereum users may be willing to pay a larger tip to move up in the block order, Solana makes money through Miner Extractable Value (or MEV). It sounds evil, but it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like Payment for Order Flow, but open to anyone in the world with the right hardware instead of just hedge funds. It‚Äôs hoping to commoditize and democratize what high-frequency traders are able to do today. \n\nThere are also non-financial products building on top of Solana. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F031c8167-4a2e-4e74-badd-39b9aa31d0bf\\_1061x367.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F031c8167-4a2e-4e74-badd-39b9aa31d0bf\\_1061x367.png)\n\n*The Solana Ecosystem*\n\n[Audius](https://audius.co/), the web3 music streaming platform, **builds on both Ethereum and Solana**. It issues and manages the $AUDIO token on Ethereum, but it runs upvotes and likes, things that need high speed and low-cost to work as well as a Web2 counterpart, on Solana, powered by the same engine used by some of the most sophisticated finance professionals in the world. \n\nThat‚Äôs one of the most interesting things about blockchain technology -- the ability to build a super high-performance machine that anyone in the world can plug into and use, even if they could never afford to otherwise. \n\nHere, too, something that I first thought was competitive with Ethereum is actually a complement. By optimizing for a high-speed trading use case not currently possible on Ethereum, Solana is bringing more financial activity on-chain. By enabling microtransactions like votes and likes, on-chain, and improving the user experience for products that also run on Ethereum, Solana is improving the web3 experience and onboarding more users. \n\nPlus, Solana is building compatibility with Ethereum that would allow it to behave like an Ethereum L2, but with the functionality of a L1, including the ability to deposit USD directly at miniscule fees. More on-ramps is net positive for the ecosystem as a whole, and Ethereum sits at the center of the ecosystem. This thread captures the argument well. \n\nIf you come at the king, you best not miss. Just as nothing has killed Excel‚Äôs core use case but plenty of multi-billion dollar companies have built businesses by focusing on specific use cases, none of the ETH-killers are going to kill ETH. To the contrary, given the nature of web3 and how early the ecosystem is, more complements bringing more demand is a positive. \n\n### **The Bull Case for Ethereum**\n\nMore demand and less supply leads to higher prices. More fees accrue to fewer coins. \n\nI‚Äôve written a lot of words up to here, but the bull case for Ethereum is that simple if you believe a few things.\n\n*   **Web3 will continue to grow**. I do. I‚Äôve written about it many times. There are too many smart people building too many crazy things that wouldn‚Äôt be possible without this technology for it not to. \n*   **EIP 1559 and Eth2 will Go Through Smoothly.** This is certainly a risk, but people seem optimistic. \n*   **Ethereum will remain the main L1 for web3.** At this point, Ethereum‚Äôs network effects are too strong to overcome. Developers, users, and even other L1s are building on or compatible with Ethereum. \n\nIf you believe all of those things, then here‚Äôs the bull case. \n\n**Demand Will Go Up**\n\nBetween Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, there was a massive increase in demand across all categories, from DeFi to NFTs to virtual worlds. Transaction fees increased 200x. \n\nAll of that happened while usability was rough and fees were exorbitantly high. As my friend [Jon Wu](https://twitter.com/jonwu\\_) (who you should follow to get smarter on all of this) explained it:\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d712a74-2910-4b27-a443-10390720a33d\\_249x382.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d712a74-2910-4b27-a443-10390720a33d\\_249x382.png)\n\nThis past year was as bad as it‚Äôs ever going to get for Ethereum. It‚Äôs only going to get better from here, for a few reasons. \n\nFirst, assuming everything goes as planned with EIP 1559 and the Eth2 merge, transaction speeds will go up, and gas fees will become both lower and more predictable. **diIt will be easier and cheaper to transact. Lower transaction fees and faster transaction times should lead to more transactions.**\n\nSecond, even if what we just experienced was a bubble, **short-term bubbles are long-term useful**! They attract money and talent to the space, and money and talent will mix to create new products that attract new users and more demand. I‚Äôve seen dozens of pitches from strong teams leaving traditional startups to build web3 products, many on top of Ethereum, in the past couple of months alone. More products and better experiences will attract more users. ETH is an indexed bet on that growth more than a bet on the success of any one project. \n\nStrong trends, lower prices, better experiences, and new products = growing demand. \n\n**Lower Supply**\n\nFor many ETH bulls, this is the crux of the argument: **EIP 1559 means that ETH becomes deflationary**. \n\nBitcoin issuance is capped at 21 million. This has been the strongest bull case for BTC. You can‚Äôt just print more, like the evil central banks, it‚Äôs math, and it‚Äôs capped. It‚Äôs **sound money.**\n\nThe knock against Ethereum is that there is no cap. Theoretically, enough Ethereum users could decide to keep printing ETH and inflating supply. If you‚Äôre going to have an inflationary asset, why not just use fiat ü§Æ amiright? \n\nBut EIP 1559 and Eth2 flip that. With Eth2, new issuance to reward validators is expected to drop dramatically versus Proof of Work rewards. With EIP 1559, by burning ETH in every transaction, assuming a conservative amount of daily transaction fees and that 70% of the gas fee is burnt and 30% is sent as a tip, then more ETH will be burnt than issued every day. Together, **the supply of ETH will actually begin decreasing after EIP 1559 and the Eth2 merge**. \n\nIt‚Äôs better than sound money. It‚Äôs **Ultra Sound Money**. ü¶á üîä\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3fc34c-1ff9-440e-be07-f5ed05dfe3d4\\_640x337.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3fc34c-1ff9-440e-be07-f5ed05dfe3d4\\_640x337.png)\n\nTo understand the numbers, check out the models that Justin Drake built on [ETH Peak Supply](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZN444\\__qkPWPjMJQ_t6FfqbhllkWNhHF-06ivRF73nQ/edit#gid=0) and [The Road to 100M ETH](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XmeYkWEmaaZEUZ078A-lolchzNUrnlUllLkVXSGPzAU/edit#gid=0). \n\nThe implications here are enormous. \n\nDirectly, it means lower supply meeting growing or accelerating demand, which should lead to higher prices. \n\nEven wilder, if people and institutions are holding BTC because of its use as a non-inflationary Store of Value, might they switch to Ethereum instead if the Ultra Sound Money thesis plays out? Could Ethereum flip Bitcoin as the most valuable cryptocurrency? \n\nBut it doesn‚Äôt stop there, because ETH isn‚Äôt just a store of value. \n\n**Value Accrues to ETH Holders**\n\nETH ownership also grants the right to do work for the Ethereum network as a validator and earn a share of fees. \n\nIn Proof of Work, miners need to sell the ETH that they earn to cover costs. Today, that creates a daily sell pressure of 22.3k ETH, according to [another Justin Drake model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TsrdbdusUop4NJbvjGBbOWTUwYH-Jgg1QBkQ5CtY\\_-k/edit#gid=0). That means that every day, 22.3k newly-created ETH, about $50 million worth, are dumped on the market. With Proof of Stake, the only costs are taxes, which Drake assumes to be 50%, and new issuance drops from 13.5k ETH to 2.1k ETH. That leads to a net sell pressure reduction, from 22.3k ETH per day to 2.6k ETH per day. That‚Äôs the equivalent of roughly **$40 million per day in new demand**.\n\nPlus, instead of leaking out of the system, the value accrue to validators. Another [Drake model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FslqTnECKvi7\\_l4x6lbyRhNtzW9f6CVEzwDf04zprfA/edit#gid=0) estimates that people who stake their ETH (meaning lock it up to secure the network) can **earn a 25% APR including new issuance and tips**. \n\nIn sum: \n\n*   Ethereum has strong **network effects** and will remain at the center of the web3 ecosystem as it continues to grow, creating more transactions and more fees\n*   ETH will become a **deflationary asset** as demand for it increases\n*   ETH will become a **capital asset** that earns holders high APR \n\nI don‚Äôt even know how you price that, but of course, [Justin Drake tried](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U9cGxGY3\\_t7m4MEIpjKWtRcA2zRajywaxMCZYqbF9eI/edit#gid=0), putting his best guess somewhere between $13-51k. \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04088ff8-fe71-4acc-8b16-9778e6eb66fa\\_1086x284.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04088ff8-fe71-4acc-8b16-9778e6eb66fa\\_1086x284.png)\n\n### **Risks, More Caveats, and a Conclusion**\n\nWhenever you‚Äôre reading Not Boring, you need to remember a couple things: \n\n*   I‚Äôm incredibly optimistic and excited by technology\n*   I have a higher risk tolerance than most\n\nPart of the reason I‚Äôm so bullish on ETH, the asset, is that the potential of Ethereum, the technology, excites me. ETH is a ticket to web3, but it‚Äôs also an excuse to keep going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. What I look for in an investment -- returns + participation + education + fun -- might be completely different than what you‚Äôre looking for. \n\nThis past weekend showed just how volatile crypto can be, and how pegged everything still is to bitcoin. If you were in ETH for a quick trade, this weekend could have been nauseating. If you‚Äôre in it because you want to learn and explore web3, it was a great opportunity to buy more tokens to play the game at half-off. \n\nDespite my overall bullishness, there are real risks ahead for Ethereum, both macro and specific. \n\nOn the macro side, what happens if Tether blows up? What if governments crack down on crypto generally? What if rates rise ahead of schedule and risk assets tank? What if Elon Musk tweets again? One of the scariest things about this past weekend‚Äôs sell-off is that there wasn‚Äôt a clear and obvious catalyst. Crypto markets can be wild. \n\nSomewhere in between the micro and the macro, there‚Äôs a question: **what if people outside of the early adopter set just don‚Äôt really care about decentralization?** What if more centralized solutions like Binance Smart Chain, which comes with a built-in user base of millions of people who trade on Binance, are *decentralized enough* and more performant? \n\nOn the micro side, Ethereum faces some real challenges. What if EIP 1559 doesn‚Äôt go through as planned? What if the Eth2 merge is delayed? What if sharding doesn‚Äôt work as planned, and creates more issues than improvements? One very real possibility is that sharding makes the Legos built on Ethereum less composable, weakening one of the most exciting aspects of the network. \n\nMaybe the biggest issue facing ETH is adoption of fragmented Layer 2 scaling solutions. While L2 solutions hold the potential to dramatically improve performance, they present two main challenges, one to Ethereum, and one to ETH:\n\n*   **Ethereum:** Adoption of fragmented L2 solutions may make composability more difficult, as execution happens in L2, settles on L1, and then goes back to another L2 for another part of the transaction. Ideally, one or two L2 solutions emerge victorious, but a world in which there are a number of L2s may strengthen Ethereum‚Äôs network effect while weakening the product experience. \n*   **ETH.** Layer 2 solutions are called rollups because they roll up a bunch of transactions into one transaction that settles on Layer 1. Maybe 100 transactions happen on L2, and the whole group shows up on L1 as one transaction. That would decrease transaction fees by 100x unless better performance and lower prices from L2 leads to a 100x increase in transactions or L2 handles transactions that represent new demand because they‚Äôre not possible at current speed and prices. \n\nAdmittedly, I don‚Äôt know enough to have a strong opinion on the topic. This is an area for more exploration, and maybe a [future post](https://twitter.com/jillruthcarlson/status/1396686804963631111?s=20).\n\nIf nothing else, I hope this piece changed the way that you think about Ethereum and makes you want to keep exploring for yourself. That‚Äôs the fun here. \n\nNormies are getting ETH-pilled, the narrative is changing, and the most bullish thing for Ether is to be understood.\n\n*Thanks to [Anatoly Yakovenko](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko), [Ben Sparango](https://twitter.com/bennybitcoins), [Jon Wu](https://twitter.com/jonwu\\_), and [Ryan Sean Adams](https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams) for input, and brother [Dan](https://twitter.com/damccormick13) for editing!*", "timestamp": 1625666020, "digest": "qQGJJDHQju6yJ7n23UuiBZ4-5MBpfzTGF4djpgDC9WQ", "contributor": "0x5507dbd48a5A5bAcE8a6030e878cC4E0af147C33"}

I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn‚Äôt meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you‚Äôd think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend‚Äôs living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn‚Äôt just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it‚Äôs not just a technology. It‚Äôs a philosophy. It‚Äôs a belief system. It‚Äôs a way of viewing the world. It‚Äôs about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you‚Äôre batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood. I remember the ‚Äúaha moment‚Äù when I wrote my first smart contract. With just a few lines of code and a private key, I was able to transfer an internet-native currency anywhere in the world in seconds. \n\nI didn‚Äôt have to sign up for Stripe. I didn‚Äôt have to use the Plaid API to connect a bank account. I didn‚Äôt have to check if TransferWise supported payments for a specific country. There was no centralized party. Just a peer-to-peer cryptonetwork called Ethereum. It was pretty damn mindblowing.\n\nAfter the first few weeks at Dharma, I was confident that DeFi and crypto were the future. But I also got the itch to work on some of my own ideas. I wanted to build software for creative people. Writers. Artists. Musicians. Online teachers. I strongly believe our world depends on these types of people having the tools they need to serve their communities as best they can.\n\nFrankly, I also thought it would take a couple years before the crypto industry had the infrastructure in place for a mainstream consumer app to be built.\n\n\nSo I ended up leaving Dharma to take some time off and explore a few startup ideas. But a couple months ago I read a [manifesto](https://cryptomedia.wtf/) by [Zora](https://zora.co/) that changed how I thought about crypto.\n\nIt described a world where crypto could be used to give any digital media file (eg an image, a song, an essay, digital art, etc.) property rights. It explained how cryptonetworks could turn digital media into liquid financial assets, secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts.\n\nAlthough the individual ideas weren‚Äôt new, they were combined and articulated in a way that just made sense. And not just to me.\n\n[Digital artists](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9), [athletes](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html), [social media influencers](https://cryptoslate.com/logan-paul-nfts-sell-3-5-million-worth-on-first-day-of-release/), [tech executives](https://scottbelsky.medium.com/the-furry-lisa-cryptoart-the-new-economy-of-digital-creativity-6cb2300ea081), [media executives](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI), and [journalists](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1366554892035219462) that never took the crypto weirdos seriously, seem to be taking notice.\n\nBut let‚Äôs be real. Is this latest NFT craze a bubble? Probz. Yet, is there at least a kernel of value in the idea of ownership over creative work? I think so.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell, there‚Äôs been a lot of talk about high transaction fees and lack of scalability in these systems. Although I do think these problems should and will get fixed, a lack of technical scalability is kinda the point.\n\nCryptonetworks trade off technical scalability for social scalability.\n\nFacebook is technically scalable because it‚Äôs a social network that processes millions of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is socially scalable because it‚Äôs a trillion dollar economic network without a centralized authority.\n\nCrypto isn‚Äôt just a technological revolution. It‚Äôs also a revolution in capital formation and human coordination. How creative projects are funded. How groups of people are incentivized. How organizations are structured.\n\nYears from now, when I‚Äôm old and senile, I believe we‚Äôll look back at this period as an [Internet Renaissance](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1343210395704541189) of sorts. \n\nA time where we dared to fight back against systems that have been designed for centuries to elevate certain groups and keep others disenfranchised.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe all this crypto stuff really is just an intellectual ideal that‚Äôll never work in practice. Regardless, I think it‚Äôs at least worth trying.", "timestamp": 1625669510, "digest": "pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

(or‚Ä¶Why I‚Äôm leaving TradFi for Crypto)", "body": "### It‚Äôs All Stocks\nA portfolio manager I used to work with once remarked that if you stay in finance for long enough, you begin to see everything as a stock. When I first heard this, as an intern at an investment firm in 2017, it seemed like one of those Wall Street neologisms that sound true, but don‚Äôt feel true until you‚Äôve lived them firsthand (other neologisms that fall under this category: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt short on valuation‚Äù, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt short on competition‚Äù, and my personal favorite: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try to predict the future. Try to describe the present‚Äù). This particular piece of wisdom was palpable almost immediately: in August of 2017, I drove to the Hamptons with some friends and realized that the PM who said that everything looked like a stock had a long or short position in half of the retailers occupying the strip malls along the Southhampton Bypass. In finance, even a trip to the beach is a quest for alpha.\n\nThe 2017 internship turned into a job offer, which turned into a full time position in 2018 after I graduated from college. I felt luckier than a lot of my peers who spent senior year either cramming for McKinsey case studies or lamenting because they doubted they had the quantitative skills to even attempt one. Before the summer of 2017, I probably would‚Äôve put myself in the latter camp: a history major who only did theater, film, and journalism in college. But the internship taught me that you can learn any quantitative skill on the job, by sheer force of attrition. Someone will ask you for the diluted share count of an upcoming IPO, or to input a company‚Äôs EBITDA into an earnings model (which raises other questions, like what is depreciation and amortization, and how do you use Excel?), or might say to you ‚Äúyes, gross margins are 50% right now, but what happens when GMs reach 65%, and S&M spend falls to 30% of revenue, and Trump manages to pass corporate tax cuts? How much are they earning then?‚Äù Early on in my internship, it might take me an hour to figure out what question I was even being asked, and another few hours to answer it. But over time -- through attrition -- the concepts fall into place. And then you begin to start seeing everything as a stock.\n\nIn the initial phase, ‚Äúseeing stocks'' might just mean the sudden realization that the vast majority of items and systems you interact with on a daily basis are actually public companies. This understanding gets augmented even further when the above concepts (diluted shares, EBITDA, tax cuts) get layered in, and you begin to think of companies as their own little organisms: sentient income statements with hopes and dreams that evolve with every quarter. Then, the companies begin to talk to each other: you have a laser component company over here, and a global OEM powerhouse over there, and a Chinese phone manufacturer somewhere else, and a smorgasbord of social camera apps, and with all of that information you might ask yourself something like: where is the 3D imaging industry heading? If you were to peer inside the brain of a truly great portfolio manager it would look a bit like a timelapse of a rapidly industrializing metropolis. A single question about the destiny of 3D imaging would be the launching pad for a mental model around the P+L of dozens of companies, implications for global supply chains, and assumptions around how consumer behavior will continue to evolve. Change one input, and the other variables will instantly recalibrate.\n\nThe most exciting thing about investing (or learning something new in general) are the moments where your own brain surprises you. A few weeks into the internship, I pitched my first stock. A couple days later, I was writing up earnings calls. Even though I definitely didn‚Äôt understand everything I was hearing, I realized that writing was a great way to interrogate where the gaps in my knowledge actually were: moments where the logic didn‚Äôt compute or my ideas failed to flow seamlessly into the next were clearly places where I needed to do more research. In a short amount of time, no one needs to ask you ‚ÄúWhat happens when GMs reach 65%?‚Äù because the question automatically populates itself in your brain (and then you want to know what happens when gross margins reach 70%, 80% and 85%), and you can pipe over to Excel, change some cells, and figure out the answer. The truly great moments are when you preempt a question even before the smart people you work for ask it.\n\nIn this way, seeing things as stocks becomes its own network effect: everyone in the in-group is inculcated with a similar (though -- it should be emphasized -- not identical) set of priorities and platonic ideals to seek out in the investment process. In doing this, you learn to think not only on behalf of yourself, but on behalf of other investors, and the meta-game is the process of trying to parse the blind spots of the players around you. Yes, this can result in a lot of group-think (and sometimes compounds into a bubble) but the combination of being right, being wrong, being wrong about others being right, and being right about others being wrong (and vice versa) is a kind of palliative against things getting too out of hand. Generally, the people who make the most amount of money are optimists with a streak of paranoia: PMs whose heads are in the clouds, with eyes that glance constantly over their shoulders.\n\nToward the end of the summer, I knew I wanted a job offer. The desire went beyond my aversion to McKinsey case studies (after what I‚Äôd learned through attrition, I had more confidence in my ability to tackle one) and had more to do with the fact that I loved the job. I began to think of it as a privatized form of journalism or history scholarship: you speak to experts, read primary and secondary research, scrutinize transcripts, and try to form a narrative that never existed before (with the added component, of course, of being sensitive to what other investors are thinking). So when I got an offer, near the end of August, I accepted immediately on the spot.\n\nBut now onto other things that were happening around the same time.\n\n### You Either Grok It Or You Don‚Äôt\nThe period of 2017-2018 also happened to coincide with the third wave of crypto hype -- the runup of Bitcoin from $1,500 to $19,000, and Ethereum to $200 to $1,200 (and back down again). I wish I could say that the combination of a job offer, a light course load, and the relative abandon of senior year created the ideal environment for me to start picking up white papers and getting into crypto. But quite the opposite: getting TradFi-pilled made me dubious of anything that threatened to disrupt the cushy world I had just entered. During senior year, I‚Äôd sometimes visit my colleagues at the office, where we‚Äôd spot the occasional appearance of an ICO promoter or Winklevoss twin on the CNBC-designated flatscreen TV in our trading room. We‚Äôd gaze in silent, baffled horror, like we were observing a natural disaster in a foreign country.\n\nWhen my colleagues and I did discuss crypto, it was mostly in an orthogonal (and subtly pessimistic) way: what would happen to the price of AMD and Nvidia stock when crypto ultimately crashed and demand for GPUs would plummet? Should we be shorting the public companies which were opportunistically appending ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù to their name and business plans, but clearly had no prior bonafides in crypto (in retrospect, probably yes). Even among the TradFi people who bought Bitcoin and Ethereum, there was a degree of calculating opportunism -- the bubble would pop eventually, and the key was to sell before the crowd.\n\nWe didn‚Äôt grok.\n\nBut crypto wasn‚Äôt completely alien to me either. In June of 2017, right around the time I started my internship, I began getting a Ethereum-focused newsletter from my friend Teo (who now works at Uniswap). I can‚Äôt recall exactly how I ended up on his mailing list -- I must‚Äôve run into him on Columbia‚Äôs campus or at a nearby bar and expressed interest, but anyway, I do know that I got the first issue, sent out on Saturday, Jun 24, 2017 at 1:52 PM. The subject header: Crypto Chat #1: Flash Crash, Visa, China, ICOs. It began:\n\nHello - hope this finds you well.\nAs I've become more and more involved in discussions around Ethereum (ETH) in past months, several of you have mentioned interest in some kind of regular newsletter sharing a roundup of thoughts/news, so here goes - please find attached.\n\nWithin the newsletter was a breathtaking roundup of recent crypto news: the GDAX flash crash, a Visa job posting for Ethereum developers, the staggering 65 million dollar Status ICO. Recall, I was still learning how exactly an IPO works (plus how to judge and value one), so the new mechanics of the crypto economy were a bit too much for me to wrap my head around. I opened Teo‚Äôs newsletters most weeks (they arrived at a steady near-weekly pace until October of 2018), but at best I skimmed them and at worst I raised my eyebrows and said to myself dubiously ‚Äúwell that shit‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù\n\nI had other opportunities to grok, and flubbed those too. Fall semester of senior year I went on a few dates with a Turkish grad student with a mining rig set up in his Morningside Heights apartment. The way he talked about Bitcoin and Ethereum was completely different from how I heard the media describe what was going on. He came from a country with a debased currency, an untrustworthy government, and ungreased payment rails. He had grown up on the internet, and foresaw an interlinked, nationless society governed by the will of networked users and executed by code. The way he talked about it sounded exciting -- the kind of thing some of my SaaS-happy colleagues would‚Äôve been into. The only problem was that...well the place I‚Äôd just accepted a job offer from only invested in enterprises that were public companies. Bitcoin and Ethereum were just ideas, and their most prominent manifestations were failed ICOs that were beginning to attract the wrath of the SEC.\n\nBy the time I graduated in May 2018, both Bitcoin and Ethereum had fallen below the high prices that attracted snarky clickbait pieces from the New York Times. Which meant that I pretty much stopped wondering about cryptocurrency and what all the hype was about. And then I stepped into full-time TradFi, which is an animal of its own.\n\n### The Social Network\nOne thing I was never told about Wall Street is that it‚Äôs one giant social network. From the outside it looks like numbers, lines, and glittering abstraction, but from the inside it‚Äôs essentially a high school cafeteria. Reputations are brokered and leveraged for allocations in an IPO, lavish, well-attended lunches are sponsored by investment banks, and the myth of the anonymous whale are overblown: your traders can call up pretty much any other desk in the industry and figure out who just made a block trade in a stock you‚Äôre jockeying to buy. You will attend dinners, and have the opportunity to rub shoulders with management teams. Names of prolific or disgraced traders who pop up in Bloomberg and the Financial Times are usually one degree of separation away. No one is incognito, even if the charts make it look that way.\n\nThis is a digression, but a private theory I have about the wave of SPACs in 2020 is that they had less to do with macroeconomic trends (COVID, low interest rates) or microeconomic trends (investment banks who wanted to earn a nice fee) than they did with the simple compulsion to sustain the social network. People were bored at home, and wanted to feel important. So they all did SPACs.\n\nStock investors aren‚Äôt even the most aggressively social creatures; our bond-trading counterparts are even more outgoing. About a year into my job, in April of 2019, I looked at the IPO of TradeWeb, a digital trading network for fixed-income assets. I was shocked to discover that just 20% of bonds, treasuries, swaps, and derivatives are traded electronically. The remaining 80% are done on the phone, over fax, or during lunch and golf. This is partially due to the fact that many fixed income assets have shallow liquidity pools or trade infrequently. But there‚Äôs another reason too: the social network keeps people locked into the old way of doing things.\n\nAnother thing you begin to notice as a stock investor is that some of the companies you‚Äôre evaluating -- the VC-annointed, so-called disruptors who are changing the world and giving the incumbents a million reasons to be fearful at night -- are not actually that innovative. They‚Äôve just figured out one bit of arbitrage (better advertising, better branding, more money from VCs, clever financial engineering) to realize staggering growth, with punt-the-proverbial-can-down-the-road promises about future profitability.\n\nThis is especially true in the fintech space, where you might see, for example, a digital lender sell off consolidated loans in the form a variable interest entity, thus sacrificing the cash flows from those loans--and thus, the long-term upside (and so, the very ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù digital lender will be stuck losing money until the FDIC throws it a bone and lets it get a banking license...but by then the marketing dollars will have dried up so the growth will have slowed, and the earnings multiple will compress). Or you might see other forms of arbitrage, like an insure-tech company that gets its customer foothold in low-competition fields like renter‚Äôs insurance...but is forced to fight against high churn and low retention (which is why there‚Äôs so little competition in those fields -- you probably don‚Äôt want that customer to begin with). Or a home iBuyer that promises faster selling times...all in exchange for commission fees that are roughly double the industry average (and in a home-buying environment where homes sell at a staggering velocity without the need for an iBuyer to begin with). Just fun, late-stage growth stuff.\n\nNow to be clear, I‚Äôm not saying that new public companies aren‚Äôt doing exciting and innovative things -- there are plenty of companies in biotechnology, data warehousing, web security, eCommerce, and retail that are delighting their customers and doing wildly great things. And even those fintechs have better customer service, and sometimes better APYs and lending rates than their more established rivals. But at the end of the day, everyone is subservient to the same master business model, and a lot of things that look like real change are just shiny skin-grafts atop the old way of doing things.\n\nUnderstanding this was one part of why finance began to feel a little ridiculous to me. And the understanding was by no means instantaneous; it took me a little over a year and a half before I started recognizing the skin-graft business model. But once you see it, you can‚Äôt unsee it: you‚Äôll look deep in the unconsolidated section of a company‚Äôs balance sheet, or maybe just glance at the sales and marketing expenses (if this product is really better, why do they need to spend 90% of revenue on S+M?) and begin to question whether what you‚Äôre being pitched is actually all that world-changing, or if you‚Äôve just been seduced by the accoutrements of Wall Street life (nice lunches, smooth-talking management teams, brassy salespeople etc.). Of course, there are plenty of people who see all of this and love Wall Street for other reasons: the constant challenge and sense that you‚Äôre learning something every moment, being surrounded by brilliant people, the game of it all, and yes, the money. And of course, I enjoyed all of this...but I still couldn‚Äôt get beyond the skin-grafting.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, I had a number of ideas that I wanted to try after TradFi. Most of the things on my list involved more creativity than being a stock analyst: I was weighing the idea of either returning to my film roots and working in production, or doing a bunch of coding bootcamps and trying to work in game design. I played a ton of games as a kid (Maplestory, The Sims, Runescape, and Civilization were some of my favorites), and my job had given me a fresh pair of eyes through which to view the various incentives and nuances at play when you orient people around mercenary goals. Between my love for devising narratives and the quantitative bent I‚Äôd picked up over the past few years, I thought that it might be worth trying out game development. In the time since graduation, I‚Äôd taught myself some coding basics but never sat down to undergo the requisite brain-attrition necessary to actually be proficient. Anyway, at the beginning of 2020, I had tentative plans to leave my job by the summer of 2020 -- exactly three years since the start of my 2017 internship -- and try something new.\n\nAnd then a pandemic happened.\n\n### It‚Äôs All A Game\nSo, March 2020. COVID-19 is officially a national crisis. In the realm of finance, the Dow plunged 26%, the Vix spiked all the way up to 83, and in a panic I withdrew 50% of my stock portfolio from the market. On March 16th, 2020 my entire team called in for our first work-from-home 9am call, and spent about half the time speculating about when New York would reach herd immunity and the other half discussing what stocks we should buy when the pandemic ended (perhaps a testament to our enduring optimism). Stocks continued to plummet through the end of March, and then began their staggering, unprecedented recovery (thank you, Federal Reserve).\n\nUnbeknownst to me, similar stress tests were unfolding in crypto: Bitcoin fell 50%, and the crash of Ethereum set off a chain reaction of pricing oracle lags, surging gas prices, decentralized exchange liquidations, and the Maker debt auction (on the bright side, Hayden Adams popped onto Twitter to chirpily inform people that Uniswap achieved a then-record amount of volume). Months later, when I finally started seriously getting into crypto (and to be honest, specifically Ethereum), I spent hours reading Medium posts, Twitter threads, and forums, unearthing lore across the ecosystem, and reliving not only the drama of March 2020, but sagas from the past decade. This is another instance where having majored in history really helped me: it‚Äôs just that my sources expanded beyond library archives and into stuff like blogs, DAO forums, Discord servers, and Etherscan transactions.\n\nAnyway, back to Spring 2020. If Wall Street felt like a game before, this sense got further compounded when the sexiness and thrill of conferences and hand-shaking were stripped away, and all we were left with were Bloomberg terminal windows and Zoom meetings. In other words, the skin-graft of Wall Street itself was lifted. While the actual content of work was certainly getting more interesting -- markets and the narratives that animated them were being rewritten on a daily basis --- the substance of everyday life was, perhaps unsurprisingly, quite banal. Everything was unfolding on the interface-layer, on the screen, like a videogame.\n\nI still remember why and when I started reading about crypto again. Every Sunday, I‚Äôd send out an email to my colleagues with a roundup of news related to stocks and trade ideas we‚Äôve been discussing. On May 31st, 2020, I included a link to a New York Times article about Cameo, Patreon, and Substack -- one of the first mainstream pieces I‚Äôd read codifying the ‚Äúcreator economy‚Äù as a real force in the market. The Times also linked to a bunch of articles -- including a few by Li Jin, which brought me to the a16z website, which (after the relentless hyperlink-clicking that I tend to do) landed me on a podcast with Jeff Jordan, Jesse Walden, Zoran Basich and the NBA player Spencer Dinwiddie. Spencer, a point guard with the Brooklyn Nets, was planning on tokenizing a portion of his three-year contract with the team, in an effort to receive more of his income upfront. What struck me about the podcast was the way Spencer articulated crypto as a unique enabler of an internet of value -- a way to create liquidity in an idiosyncratic pool of assets underpinned both by monetary worth and personal affinity. For the first time, crypto started to make sense, despite his occasional drops of industry lingo (Eth2, Polkadot, Tezos) that I still wasn‚Äôt totally familiar with.\n\nFrom the podcast, I clicked on Jesse Walden‚Äôs name, which led me to his author page where I landed on his (then) most recent article: ‚ÄúCrypto‚Äôs Business Model is Familiar. What Isn‚Äôt is Who Benefits.‚Äù This piece was another crucial unlock for me. In it, Jesse described a system I was much more familiar with: network effects. But Jesse wasn‚Äôt just talking about the networked models I had grown familiar with as a stock analyst (Uber, Facebook/Instagram, Twilio, Wall Street life itself, etc.), but actually drawing analogies between Web 2.0 companies and their crypto counterparts. I hadn‚Äôt yet heard of Compound or Uniswap, but I knew about LendingClub and Coinbase, and what Jesse was describing seemed to be a far fairer model for organizing a business and aligning incentives. As Jesse writes in the piece: ‚Äú[t]he principal innovation of crypto networks is their ability to grow network effects by enabling users to share in the value they create.‚Äù\n\nTo those already in the crypto space, this might seem like the most obvious observation in the world. Of course web3 protocols need users, and of course those users are attracted to networks with the deepest liquidity pools and most attractive incentives. But for someone who, up until that point, didn‚Äôt really grasp that actual businesses were being built on top of decentralized blockchains like Ethereum, this was an absolute revelation. The way I‚Äôd seen crypto written about by mainstream media tended to focus on cryptocurrencies as assets and investments -- but Jesse‚Äôs piece went a layer deeper and looked at crypto at the layer of ERC-20 tokens and business models.\n\nThat was a major turning point for me. Starting in June 2020, I began to follow the space a bit more closely. I began checking Coindesk and other crypto-focused news sites, and tracked the wave of token drops and liquidity-mining incentives that were picking up momentum. Admittedly, the significance of DeFi Summer (the launch of the Compound and Balancer tokens, rampant yield farming, and TVL reaching nearly $8 billion by the end of August) was actually a little lost on me. I assumed that everything that was going on was simply a continuation from the 2017-2018 hype cycle, rather than (as it now seems) a genuine shift forward in the energy and momentum of the industry. Still, I felt like things were different than they were two years prior. By the time the UNI token dropped in September 2020, I was beginning to develop a suspicion that tokens might one day shift the nature of traditional capital markets as well.\n\nIf users are given tokens, early investors are offered liquidity faster, and outsiders are given the opportunity to buy-in, is there a future where the need for traditional capital markets is reduced or rendered obsolete completely? Clearly, we‚Äôre still in a very early phase of this (and a large number of tokens dropped today have nebulous utility), but it does seem possible that with everything shifting upstream in the realm of finance (DeFi, token drops, faster and more-efficient asset trading), everything downstream will begin to adjust as well. The model of Uniswap loomed in my head when the Coinbase S1 dropped in February of this year. A decentralized exchange is running head-to-head in daily volume and revenue with a centralized leviathan valued at several magnitudes more -- and that leviathan has over a thousand employees, and likely lower margins (note: this should not be read as a knock against Coinbase which has a much more diverse business: an institutional segment, a nascent debit card and high-yield interest account, a much larger compliance/legal team, an investing arm, a strategic affiliation with USDC, a much more diverse balance sheet, etc...but still, the rise of Uniswap is truly staggering). It raises the question: how many more industries can crypto disrupt, when decentralized protocols replace employees and overhead costs, and value can instead be shared with users and stakeholders?\n\nBut I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself. In October of 2020, my friend Nikita invited me and a bunch of mutual friends to spend the month in a house in Maine. While there, I met Reggie, who was getting even deeper into crypto than I was. I had only been reading the articles and token drop announcements -- Reggie was investing, reading white papers, swapping tokens, yield farming, and just generally living in it (in addition to all of that, he‚Äôs also the CEO of an avatar social network company called Eternal). Anyway, the trip was the extra push I needed to begin seriously thinking about leaving my current job (I‚Äôd put that plan on temporary hiatus because of the pandemic). I was surrounded by people in various stages of mid-20‚Äôs self-discovery: everyone was either accepting a new position, about to quit a job, applying to grad school, launching an angel fund, raising money for a startup, working in VC, or working for Stripe. As a stock analyst I didn‚Äôt quite feel like a vampire squid, but I did feel a little like a barnacle -- hanging on the outer rim of life but not really participating in it substantially. The trip truly changed my life in a lot of ways -- I met people who loved their work, were optimistic about tech, and felt a clear sense of responsibility about the direction of the industry.\n\nWhen I got back from the trip, I started really diving into crypto. I read the Ethereum White Paper for the first time (I know, I know, it took me awhile!). I discovered MEV; in fact, when I read the paper ‚ÄúFlash Boys 2.0: Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and Consensus Instability in Decentralized Exchanges\", it was the first time I felt like I really understood how smart contracts work and orders are processed on the blockchain (what that paper does really well is highlight how the Ethereum network functions by exposing points of arbitrage). I started doing research and buying currencies and tokens -- trying to assess their businesses the way I evaluate a stock (once you start seeing things as stocks, anything is up for fair valuation). I discovered NFTs that I love, and met people like Toby Shorin and John Palmer who had been doing work in the industry for a few years.\n\nIn late January, I was still at the firm, but had already told my boss I was starting to look for new positions. I was already quietly buzzing with excitement about crypto, and was also jazzed by a few other personal projects I had just worked on (including messing a bit around with Unity and learning a bit of C#). That entire month had a kind of ‚Äúcrossing-the-Rubicon‚Äù valence to it. Between finally making it to 2021, the storm on the Capitol, and the promise of vaccines on the horizon, it seemed like the world was reconstituting itself.\n\nStill, like everyone else at my job, in finance, and probably most people in the country, I was completely shocked to watch what happened in the final few weeks of January when Gamestop rose roughly 750% in the span of a few days, invigorated by the forces of Reddit. Among my colleagues, the reaction was a mix of fear, awe, and self-protection. Chief among the concerns: could one of our positions be next (a new neologism: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt short something if r/WallStreetBets is about to send it to the moon. You will get rekt‚Äù). Over the next few days, our outlook evolved: by January 28th we had a deeper grasp of the months-long leadup to the saga. RoaringKitty had sowed the seeds for months on YouTube and the idea had been percolating for awhile on Reddit. This realization prompted a more nuanced discussion about the way the average retail investor was a lot more sophisticated than the elite Wall Streeter gives them credit for.\n\nr/WallStreet bets had illuminated something: everyone was now playing the same game, mediated by the same interface. COVID rendered us all crouched, behind screens, contending to steer the same pools of capital in different directions. I think institutional Wall Street is afraid for a reason that‚Äôs even more intrinsic than the idea of being liquidated or margin-called. The game that we‚Äôd spent decades perfecting and protecting for a select group of insiders was now open to anyone. A great incursion on the social network was unfolding for everyone to witness. The funhouse culmination of Metcalfe‚Äôs law.\n\nI believe crypto only intensifies that. Capital can now move at the same pace of online thought. Jesse Walden even hinted at that in the first article of his that I read: ‚ÄúWe can now move bits of value in the way we move bits of information: using an open standard, in very granular transmissions, instantly, to anyone, anywhere in the world.‚Äù That ability will change everything.\n\n### Describing the Present\nEveryone‚Äôs journey down the crypto rabbit-hole is deeply personal to them. Mine is an amalgamation of my work in finance and investing, my private anxieties around whether I gave film enough of a shot (and underpinning that, a desire to make the act of creating art easier and more financially viable for my friends who were brave enough to go all-in), my personal tendencies toward light iconoclasm, my delight in uncertainty, and my desire to make the world a fairer, more economically just place. I think most people in crypto share some array of these traits, and have their own motivations as well. I think the key is finding the unlock for each person, and introducing them to crypto that way.\n\nMy dad began to grasp Ethereum after I suggested he read the white paper; as a lawyer, he immediately grokked the idea of immutable smart contracts. I‚Äôve started a consulting gig with a resale and limited-run goods startup on a social token rewards system, and our conversations have centered around unifying the values of buyers, sellers, and creating relationships that endure beyond a transaction. Given the pace of sell-side notes, investment bank-hosted webinars, and recent high-profile announcements of potential TradFi-DeFi alliances (Compound Treasury, for example) I think Wall Street is beginning to wake up to the indelible momentum of crypto as well.\n\nIn my final weeks as a stock analyst, I pitched Ethereum, Uniswap, and MakerDAO as long positions to my colleagues (though no one bought...yet). We had numerous discussions around the promises of crypto, and what various crypto-native business models might look like. Marc Rubenstein‚Äôs excellent Reinventing The Financial System post about MakerDAO was the catalyst for a thorough, long-winding conversation about the fractional reserve banking system, and the way loans underpin the financial industry. I think my former teammates were surprised to hear that crypto could be used as a means to issue a dollar-backed stablecoin, and that a blockchain-based issuer could also begin to do work in new segments like real-world-asset-backed loans. While MakerDAO‚Äôs initial pool of RWA loans is quite small (just under ~4m in total loans outstanding today), it‚Äôs easy to see this scaling into a much larger operation (which could help diversify their collateral base away from USDC). These are early signs that crypto has the potential to grow to touch more than just value-exchange online.\n\nIt‚Äôs still so early for everything. A few nights ago, I went back and re-read some of the first messages I sent with the Turkish grad student from 2017. I wanted to revisit what I was really thinking about cryptocurrencies at the time. Our messages began in September, just a few weeks after my post-internship job offer. This part in particular stuck out to me:\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, I was asking -- how can Bitcoin (or Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency) scale without the kind of leverage and rehypothecation that we see in traditional financial markets? In my own words ‚ÄúBitcoin (or the blockchain) can‚Äôt replicate the international banking system we have where money and ‚Äòvalue‚Äô is basically manufactured through securitization and other fancy financial instruments.‚Äù Obviously, I was not anticipating DeFi. As I said in the second message ‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed that tech people are usually way more imaginative.‚Äù I was right about that. DeFi had a little under $2bn in TVL a year ago and now sits just above $50bn in TVL today (and much more if you include blockchains like Solana and Binance) -- a staggering amount of growth.\n\nWhile you might argue that DeFi encourages some degree of reckless over-speculation, overleveraged trading, and is artificially inflating the value of certain crypto-assets today, I actually don‚Äôt think that matters longer-term. For one, price action in the industry serves as a form of advertising, and an early engine of innovation (Chris Dixon and Eddy Lazzarin had a good post that examined this phenomenon with respect to the price of Bitcoin, but the same is likely true if you map in assets like Ethereum or Solana). Even if certain assets fluctuate today (and those fluctuations are intensified by leverage), the overall impact of getting more people interested in crypto is a positive counterweight to any near-term mania (though yes, it does suck for the people who lose a lot of money).\n\nAnd even if DeFi and yield farming is creating nearer-term hype, it‚Äôs also illuminating the greater promise of crypto in general: the idea that if you eliminate middlemen and share value with users of a protocol instead, the positive externalities are so great that crypto can start behaving like a public good. Grants issued by groups like Uniswap and the Ethereum Foundation are an early indication of this. And this isn‚Äôt confined to just DeFi; NFT projects allow creators and collectors to share in the value of art created by eliminating (or at the very least, reducing the take rate) of middlemen, while encoding an enduring revenue stream for the originator of a specific work. Hopefully we‚Äôll soon see ways to map this model onto other scalable operations, like music and other forms of entertainment, DAOs that own real estate, and maybe a blockchain-based Uber.\n\n\n\n\nThe ‚Äúseeing things as stocks‚Äù mindset that was first inculcated in me four years ago will likely need to be reframed. In the future, public companies may see no separation between users, employees, and shareholders. In fact, ‚Äúpublic companies‚Äù as we understand them today may not even exist, as they will have issued tokens at an earlier stage, and might not even IPO. While I realize I‚Äôm now violating my favorite neologism (‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try to predict the future. Try to describe the present.‚Äù), I think we have early signals that this could come to pass. Everything from the increased focus on DAO treasury management to aforementioned efforts to collateralize real-world-assets with DeFi indicate that the need to tap public markets for capital may recede (it‚Äôs also quite possible that public markets and TradFi in general are reshaped from within by crypto, in ways that I‚Äôm not yet imagining, and they continue to endure in a revitalized form). Of course, there are tons of uncertainties here: the continued pace of user adoption, and regulatory overhangs are two big ones.\n\nMostly, I‚Äôm just unabashedly optimistic, for all the reasons I outlined above. In the four years since I first started paying attention to crypto, the industry has transitioned into an instrument of genuine value creation. I‚Äôve met so many people in the past year who have inspired and galvanized me -- and my only hope is that I can contribute to an industry that I believe will revolutionize the way we live, both online and in the physical world.\n\nUsually when I write an essay, I start with the concluding paragraph already written, at least in my head. I tend to begin already knowing what I want the lesson to be. This is one of the few exceptions -- an hour before publishing this, I‚Äôm sitting on the couch in my living room, trying to figure out the best way to bring both the past four years of my professional life, and the promise of crypto to some kind of satisfying finale. And I‚Äôm realizing that it‚Äôs probably an impossible task to achieve in writing. Because with crypto, you just have to live it. So now I‚Äôm off to go do that.\n\n*Thanks to early readers of this essay: Andrew, Jeremy, Keeks, Reggie, Tarun, and Toby.*\n\n*Also boundless thanks to the builders, writers, thinkers, tinkerers, and visionaries who have made their work available on everything from Github to blogs to forums to Discord messages.

While the content and framing has evolved over the past 6 months, the core vision has remained the same: to craft a crypto-native artifact that captures the humanity of the people building the future of Ethereum.\n\nIt contains the hopes, fears, and anticipations of the Eth2 researchers and client implementers directly responsible for bringing the Beacon Chain to life on December 1, 2020. The future of the Beacon Chain is the future of Ethereum, and we‚Äôre proud to tell part of its story this far.\n\nWe prompted contributors with a few questions - you'll find them in order in each response, some but not all answered.\n\n- Name / handle\n- Affiliated orgs\n- Primary role\n- Eth2 rough start date\n- General summary of experiences\n- Code or documentation they are particularly proud of\n- Most memorable or painful-to-discover Eth2 bug\n- Person you've come to admire or want to give a shoutout to\n\nKeep in mind that these responses were gathered both before and after the Beacon Chain launch, so references to launch expectations will vary. Profiles are ordered alphabetically by first name.\n\nFinally, while we made the utmost effort to include as many people as possible, it‚Äôs inevitable that we missed or were unable to feature some contributors. Eth2 wouldn‚Äôt be what it is without the input of hundreds of community testers and code contributors - thank you.\n\n---\n\n### Ethereum = Eth1 + Eth2\n\n- Ben Edgington\n- Originally [published on eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/wnie2_210328), 28th March, 2021\n\nLet's start with a quick history of what's become known as Eth2, and where it's headed in the future.\n\nRecently, Danny Ryan has announced his [intent to deprecate](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/) the use of the terms eth1 and eth2. As the creator and curator of ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New in Eth2,‚Äù this is a bit of a blow!\n\nBut, on the whole, I agree that these terms are beginning to outlive their usefulness, and are in danger of becoming quite misleading. It‚Äôs not really about fiddling with names; it‚Äôs about capturing fundamental changes in direction, and communicating them clearly. Changes in the roadmap are confusing for the community. Clarity in naming aids clarity of understanding.\n\nHere's a brief history of naming things in Ethereum‚Äôs roadmap.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the first use of the name ‚ÄúEthereum 2‚Äù was by Vitalik in Hacker News, way back in [April 2014](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7554923). He positioned Ethereum 2 as being a future step-change in the capability of Ethereum through the use of ‚Äúfundamental cryptographic upgrades.‚Äù\n\nEthereum 2 then drops out of view, and the main narrative becomes the familiar Frontier ‚Üí Homestead ‚Üí Metropolis ‚Üí Serenity progression, first described in [March 2015](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). In this scheme, Serenity is the network upgrade to Proof of Stake; Serenity isn‚Äôt Ethereum 2 per se. Interestingly, sharding/scaling doesn‚Äôt have a clear place in that roadmap, although it was certainly discussed [around that time](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/05/blockchain-scalability-chain-fibers-redux/).\n\nProgress largely followed this plan for some years, with Homestead going live in March 2016, and Metropolis (in name at least) in a pair of upgrades in October 2017 and February 2019.\n\nSerenity was to have been delivered via a process of upgrading the existing Ethereum chain to bootstrap Proof of Stake. That upgrade was specified in [EIP-1011](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1011.md) and there was even a [testnet](https://hackmd.io/@aTTDQ4GiRVyyce6trnsfpg/Hk6UiFU7z?type=view) that went live on December 31st, 2017.\n\nHowever, the road to Serenity was found to be a dead-end, not least because of the vast amount of Ether that stakers would require - 1500 was the number back then.\n\nSo, in mid 2018, we tore up that roadmap and started afresh with Ethereum 2.0. Rather, we reverted to Vitalik‚Äôs original idea from 2014 of an Ethereum 2 that was to be a significant cryptographic step-change to the protocol. Calling this Eth 2.0 made sense: we were planning to change pretty much everything about the platform. Ethereum 1 would eventually be brought in as a kind of legacy system. This Ethereum 2.0 roadmap came with neat consecutive phases: Phase 0 for Proof of Stake; Phase 1 for data shards; Phase 2 for executable shards; and, finally, bring Eth1 over to Eth2 after all that.\n\nWe‚Äôve now delivered Phase 0, but the rest of the plan has evolved. As per the latest Eth2 pages [on the ethereum.org website](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/), ‚ÄúEth2 [now] refers to a *set of interconnected upgrades* that will make Ethereum more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable‚Äù (emphasis mine). This looks much more like the old Serenity plan! We‚Äôre upgrading the Ethereum chain in-place rather than doing the old rip-and-replace.\n\nSo, you see, the roadmap narrative has vacillated over the years between effectively doing a replacement of Ethereum 1, referred to at various times as Eth2, and doing in-place upgrades to Eth1. Today, we‚Äôre more or less back in upgrade territory.\n\nIn view of all this, applying the Ethereum 2.0 moniker to the entire project is now seen as confusing: to some it implies a different chain to today‚Äôs Ethereum; to others, even [a different coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/md75k2/will_be_eth_20_a_new_coin_or_will_be_the_same_eth/). It suggests incompatibilities and problems ahead.\n\nThe [latest naming trend](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/), then, is to limit Eth2 to refer only to the consensus layer upgrade of Ethereum to Proof of Stake, and to refer to all of today‚Äôs Ethereum (fka Eth1) as the execution layer.\n\nIt's good to see everything moving under a consistent terminology and a shared roadmap. I'm looking forward to a productive rest of 2021 and beyond!\n\n[Continuations [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=26)\n\n### Aditya Asgaonkar\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2019 \n\nEth2 promises to deliver a decentralized, scalable, and secure blockchain platform on which stateful applications can live. These three qualities will be the driving force towards the mass adoption of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn the quest to satisfy the design requirements, we've also seen some amazing research and engineering progress. We have pushed the frontier of computer science in areas such as Byzantine consensus, signature aggregation, and VDFs. With the launch of Phase 0, we created the largest BFT consensus network in existence, which is an awesome feat in itself!\n\nMy favorite bit of work was the [\"Weak Subjectivity Guide\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/weak-subjectivity.md) - a document that outlines the weak subjectivity safety features of the Eth2.0 network. The goal is to prevent long range attacks that appear specifically in PoS consensus.\n\nAs for favorite bug, there was a consensus (fork-choice) issue discovered right before the Beacon Chain launch. The first priority was to assess the threat level of the attack -- it was critical and could have lead to a large-scale failure, but was extremely difficult to execute. Fixing this attack vector required a comprehensive review of the fork-choice component, and we had already identified a couple of solutions. At the end, there was agreement among the spec team that the attack didn't pose a critical threat because of its difficult execution, and we decided to publish a fix after further review was completed.\n\n### Adrian Manning\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Co-Lead Developer\n- Aug 2018 \n\nThe project has always been ambitious. The early designs were well thought out, but had shortcomings which became apparent when realising them through implementation. The collaboration between researchers and developers constantly iterated on these design specs for years, finally achieving a workable version of the original concept. The process was longer than expected, but it's been amazing to see the coordination and what has been achieved by a globally distributed group of implementers and researchers.\n\nOf all the work put into the Lighthouse client, I've changed and modified various architectures and designs and I'll likely continue to do so. I'm therefore not particularly fond of any individual piece relative to another. But I'm very proud of the end result. The resulting Lighthouse code-base that came together from everyone's hard work is what I'm most proud of.\n\nAs for person to give a shoutout to, I'm sure everyone has a similar answer, but for me it's Danny and Proto. Danny for the amazing organisational role and interfacing with all the client teams (especially on contentious topics) has sped up the development immensely. Proto (Diederick) for his relentless troubleshooting, bug-finding and research endeavours. He has been invaluable in interop testing, optimisation improvements and all round improving the general state of all clients and the eth2 ecosystem in general.\n\nAlso - there's an Australian saying, which I think applies to all eth2 researchers and developers: We're not here to f$!k spiders!\n\n### Adrian Sutton\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nEth2 is this big idea that started as a seed right back when Ethereum began and then went on this crazy, messy, long journey as the details were thrashed out through open research and public collaboration. All that messiness and the length of the journey is a result of this unique, highly collaborative and distributed approach to designing it. Multiple times, concepts that had been thought settled were thrown out because a better idea came along. While that has been frustrating for on-lookers, it has led to and continues to lead to huge improvements in the resulting technology.\n\nThe interop lock-in in Canada was a major turning point in the progress of Phase 0. It forced the Beacon Chain out of that research mode. Suddenly, client development was less about translating the Python spec to another language and more about engineering all the other components that make a client actually usable. Client teams finally had a stable platform to work from and make clients interoperable. There was an explosion of tools to aid developers in debugging and testing across clients. The Beacon Chain had stopped being a research project and started being an engineering one. The road to Mainnet started to become clear.\n\nNow with the deposit contract launched and deposits flowing into it, the pressure to deliver the rest of Eth2 really amps up. Community pressure to unlock those funds again will become overwhelming and despite all the warnings that it won't be quick, people will be disappointed at how long it takes. But those locked funds will also be the equivalent of the interop lock-in, forcing work out of the research phase and into production. All that time spent researching led people to wonder if Eth2 will ever ship, but with the beacon chain launch and all that money locked in, Eth2 has almost unstoppable momentum.\n\nThe future of Ethereum is very bright.\n\nI'm quite proud of my blog post explaining the weak subjectivity period: [\"Exploring Ethereum 2: Weak Subjectivity Period.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2019/11/27/exploring-ethereum-2-weak-subjectivity-period/) It was just me trying to get my head around a concept everyone seemed to be very hand-wavy about and put off solving to the future, yet it's become one of the standard reference points to explain the concept.\n\nI'm proud to have worked with Meredith Baxter and Cem Ozer. They have both been doing all the heavy lifting for Teku, almost entirely behind the scenes. They aren't flashy Twitter personalities, they just put their heads down and do the work.\n\nA few anecdotes to conclude: \n\n1. Family commitments mean I don't travel much, so when the first 7-client interop happened and a photo was posted of people crowded around the computer watching it, everyone in the photo was quickly identified but no one had any clue who I was. For a little while I was just \"that random guy in all the eth2 photos\".\n2. Before Ethereum, Ben Edgington only ever wore button-up, collared shirts. He's now exclusively dressed in Ethereum related T-shirts and has even picked up a penchant for Ethereum hoodies.\n\n[Caravans [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=27)\n\n### Afri Schoedon\n\n- Byzantine Fault / ESP Grantee¬† \n- Testnet Engineer\n- June 2018 \n\nI was working at Parity Technologies in 2018 which managed to implement EIP 1011, the \"Hybrid Casper FFG\" in the Parity Ethereum client. It was a hybrid proof-of-stake approach to the consensus engine and literally my first memory of seeing anything Eth2 related actually being implemented and run. There was Casper testnet up and running with Harmony, Pythereum, and Parity. It was exciting to see the idea of \"Serenity\" starting to materialize. \n\nHowever, it was the same year (only a few weeks later) that the Berlin Eth2 workshop decided to completely discard the hybrid Casper ideas in favor of the beacon chain. Admittedly, it was a massive undertaking. After all the ideation and the first implementations and testnets, we basically started from scratch. \n\nPrysmatic Labs first caught my attention when they launched their first public beacon chain testnets at the end of 2019. I was wondering why we had seven Eth2 clients but none of them was able to synchronize to the other clients' testnets. I was hooked and reached out to the Ethereum Foundation and the Goerli Initiative about contributing to multi-client testnets. And that's what I did in 2020, testnet after testnet up to the mainnet launch.\n\nWhen we launched the Goerli testnet in January 2019, it was not only an important milestone for Eth1 but it was also the perfect chance for Eth2 client teams to use this for their Eth1 integration leading up to the beacon chain genesis. Prysmatic Labs seized this moment and deployed all their Eth2 testnets to date to the Goerli testnet. Coindesk wrote a feature story with the headline [\"A New Test Network Just Activated and Ethereum 2.0 Will Be Using It.\"](https://www.coindesk.com/testnet-gorli-ethereum-serenity)\n\nAll my work on Eth2 concluded with the Eth2 mainnet launch in December 2020. The eight multi-client testnets are well documented on Github and received quite some [media attention](https://github.com/goerli/medalla).\n\nAs for bugs or missing features, that would be the lack of [BLS signature verifications](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/2081) in the deposit contract.\n\nShoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang!\n\n### Alex Stokes\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2018 \n\nWhat a ride it has been! The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020 represents the culmination of years of research and development across countless contributors from every corner of the globe, reaching as far back as the Ethereum genesis block.\n\nIt has been exhilarating to watch this effort go from a collection of wild ideas (e.g. informal talks on Casper from Devcon 3) to today‚Äôs production-scale mainnet. Having been involved before the ‚Äúcasper + sharding‚Äù merge and the formation of the eth2 umbrella, I have seen time and again how a dedicated group of individuals adapts and responds to changes both inside and outside the community. It is this resilience that I find most exciting, and that gives me confidence in a very bright future for Ethereum.\n\nWe are ready to weather whatever challenges may come our way and I cannot wait as we deploy a scalable Ethereum in 2021 and beyond.\n\nI'll highlight [some of the early Casper work](https://github.com/ethereum/casper/pull/143) that got me involved directly with eth2 in mid-2018. Part of the original proof-of-stake design involved a validator registry contract hosted on the eth1 chain. As part of the deposit process, validators provided an arbitrary smart contract for signature verification. While an interesting application of account abstraction, this smart contract needed to be deterministic so that signatures could be independently verified on-chain. In order to ensure the smart contract had the desired properties, it was processed by another smart contract, the \"purity checker\" (in the sense of a pure computation), during the initial registration.\n\nAn early version of the purity checker was written in a now deprecated smart contract language called Serpent LLL. I created a Gitcoin bounty to port the Serpent LLL to a language stack used in the ethereum/casper project, Vyper LLL.\n\nMost painful bug would definitely have to be debugging cross-client interactions during the eth2 interop event in 2019. Fun times, good people and challenging bugs!\n\nShoutout to protolambda!\n\n### Alex Vlasov\n\n- TX/RX¬† \n- Applied Researcher\n- July 2019 \n\nMy predominant impression is that Eth2 poses problems, which are perhaps the most challenging from a software engineering point of view, at the moment. This is exciting from a researcher's perspective, but sometimes frustrating from a software engineer's one. We must adapt, in order to survive in the endeavor.\n\nOne aspect is that we, as software engineers, are used to optimizing for the common case, largely overlooking rare ones. But the latter ones are exactly what an attacker will thoroughly scrutinize! The habit is difficult to break, especially considering that it demands huge amounts of time to analyze and optimize the worst case behavior.\n\nI'm confident that we have to use Formal Methods, as testing is not able to explore the search space exhaustively (except for rare cases, when the space is relatively small).\n\nAnother important aspect is that modern DeFi is demanding on resources. And that is not only data throughput, but EVM/CPU throughput too. ZKP/zkRollups is an obvious example. However, asset pricing can be computation hungry too. And, as we can see now, DeFi asset pricing is an important topic. Unfortunately, EWASM turned to be a much harder idea to implement than initially expected. And it's basically for the same reason - WASM JIT compilers are optimized for a common case, while worst case scenarios can be exploited by an attacker. So, I treat it as another manifestation of the problem discussed above.\n\nWhile the problems are difficult, I am very excited to investigate and implement potential solutions.\n\nOne idea that I'm working on is a (semi-)automated transpilation of Eth2 beacon chain Python specs to Kotlin. The [resulting Kotlin code](https://github.com/ericsson49/research/blob/master/beacon_kotlin_generated/src/phase1/spec.kt) is beautiful, IMHO. Kotlin turned to be a pretty good match for (a statically-typed subset of) Python.\t\n\nAs for a specific bug, it's not yet made public (as it can turn to be a serious vulnerability). But the basic idea is that swapping two lines leaves a function 100% functionally correct, while an attacker can send the code into a practically endless loop.\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan!\n\n[Discovery [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=28)\n\n### Ben Edgington\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Chronicler of Eth2 and Teku PM\n- January 2018 \n\nI could write a book on this, and perhaps one day I will. But the tl;dr is that getting to where we are has been the most incredible journey of my career.\n\nThe technology is thrilling, and the distributed development model no less so. But the highlight above all is getting to work every day with such a brilliant, thoughtful, capable, and generous group of people. If it's true that technology reflects the people who build it, then Eth2 is going to be a superb foundation for all the systems of the world.\n\nAs for the future, the beacon chain was designed, developed and delivered astonishingly quickly, having been conceived only in June 2018. Things get harder from now on: the beacon chain already carries so much value, and we need to begin taking into account the existing value on the Eth1 chain as we work on a merge. I think our main challenges ahead may not be technical, but more governance related. But I am confident that, with the ethos we've established and momentum we have as a community, we can bring this thing to a successful conclusion.\t\n\nI've enjoyed writing up regular digests of the latest developments in the spec since October 2018 at [eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/), really with an audience of just the other Eth2 devs in mind. Over time it's grown and evolved, and now gets between three thousand and ten thousand views per edition. This amazes me.\n\nI am still happy with my one and only ethresear.ch post, co-written with Nicolas Liochon: [\"Exploring the Proposer Collator split.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/exploring-the-proposer-collator-split/1632) While more of a design bug than a code bug, some credited it with finally finishing off the old sharding design, and precipitating the move to the beacon chain. I think things may have already been heading in that direction at the time.\n\nAs for individual shoutouts, what an incredible group of people - you are all amazing!\n\n### Carl Beekhuizen\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nAlthough eth2 has taken longer to get off the ground than I think any of us imagined, the result is extremely robust, secure, and decentralised.\n\nIt is incredibly exciting to see how eth2 is evolving and maturing into the backbone of the decentralised future we all dream about.\n\nI'm most proud of the key-derivation EIPs (2333, 2334, 2335). Specifically, the quantum-secure backup keys built into EIP 2333. In the event of a quantum apocalypse, validators should be able to recover using these Lamport signatures.\n\nI'm also really proud of the Launchpad. ü¶è So many validators managed to deposit safely.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang for the attention to detail and diligence she brings to everything she works on.\n\n### Cayman Nava\n\n- Chainsafe Systems¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- December 2018 \n\nThe past two years have been a blast. Looking back on the progress we've collectively made and the state of the ecosystem, I feel like we're on the cusp of something great. And I'm honored to be a part of it. I anticipate that Ethereum will be of critical importance for the future, as a rock-solid foundation that empowers ultimately successful experiments which aim to resolve many of the hardest problems facing society today.\n\nI'm proud of the [typescript implementation](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ssz) of SSZ (a copy of Proto's remerkleable). It fulfills the spec, but in an ergonomic way. You can operate on an ssz merkle tree as if it is a 'normal' javascript object. This required some exotic code, but the result is seamless [ssz <-> javascript interoperability](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/lodestar-medalla-update-59865a5cce1a).\n\nHuge thanks to Proto and his work! Many of the tools / algorithms / methods he's published are present in Lodestar: remerkleable, eth2-fastspec, protoarray fork choice, etc. the list goes on.\n\n### Celeste Seberras\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Technical Content Strategist\n- May 2018 \n\nIt has been a humbling experience to have witnessed the growth of Prysmatic from a small seedling with a dream to the robust and diverse community it harbours today; equally so for the broader Eth2 ecosystem. Hard work over the past two years has proven that, through all the speculative noise and interindustry drama, the things that truly speak are code and passion.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Prysm client usage manual.\n\nShout out to all the boys here at Prysmatic Labs. You are all fantastic to work with, here's to the future!\n\nShoot for the stars. Even if you miss, holy fuck you're in space!\n\n### Cem Ozer\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2019 \n\nI‚Äôm blown away that the Eth2.0 beacon chain is now alive and well. For me it was such a complex undertaking, and deep down I was scared it would never launch or be successful.\t\n\nWhen I first joined Teku (called Artemis back then) we were almost only working on the state transition. The spec changed pretty rapidly at the time, and as a result we had to update our state transition many times. I found myself leading these changes at Artemis, and it would almost always be a week long intense marathon where we‚Äôd change thousands of lines of code as a team, and I‚Äôd try to make sure we did not break anything.\n\nLuckily this was in the prototyping phase, this is not how it‚Äôs done today in the production phase :). I‚Äôm also pretty proud of having worked on the Eth1 Deposit Management of Teku.\n\nMy best bug discovery is luckily documented by my team lead Adrian Sutton on his blog: [\"The Curious Case of the Invisible Fork.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2020/07/06/exploring-ethereum-2-the-curious-case-of-the-invisible-fork/)\n\nShoutout to Johnny Rhea, Adrian Sutton, and Protolambda. These three people are all geniuses in their own unique ways. It was an honor and an incredible experience working with them.\n\n[Build - Maintain [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=29)\n\n### Chih Cheng Liang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2017 \n\nI'm glad to be part of Eth2 development. There are too many people; I can't express my gratitude enough. There are lots of beautiful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nI'm excited to see what Ethereum will be with fully-fledged PoS as well as sharding.\n\nI'm most proud of introducing the Milagro BLS binding to Trinity. BLS signatures are like the steroids of Eth2. Back then, only one Python library, py_ecc, met the requirements of the Beacon Chain spec. py_ecc is great for research or education purposes, but for things like client implementations, the performance of the library is not on par. The na√Øve alternative is to find a Python binding of a fast language. Chia's Python binding to C++ code was the low hanging fruit to pursue.\n\nAs the Beacon Chain BLS requirements became more specific, and we had to interop with other clients in a short timeframe, we decided to try using Python to wrap \"milagro_bls\" - Sigma Prime's Rust library. The result is the \"milagro_bls_binding\" library. I'm proud of it because that's my first Rust-ish project, and it was used in a real use case.\n\nAs for most challenging bug, in early 2018 I worked on the [Casper prototype testnet](https://github.com/ethereum/trinity/pull/954) that Karl and Vitalik built on pyethapp. Pyethapp had many issues, but the most difficult one to debug was the peer connection issue. I got a lot of help from Dmitry from the Harmony team, he discovered many peer connection issues with the Java client's logs. One of them was pyethapp's catastrophic peer-to-peer bug.\n\nSpecial thanks to Jannik Luhn - he contributed lots of quality work in peer to peer research/simulation and Trinity.\n\n### Dankrad Feist\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- June 2018 \n\nBy historical accident, one of my first ever involvements with Ethereum was the research workshop in Berlin 2018 where the Beacon chain design (and merging of Casper and Sharding) was first decided. I had only come to the workshop because I was in Berlin at the time for my startup and my former colleague and friend, Justin Drake, had invited me to check it out. The concepts that were talked about at this workshop immediately appealed to the nerd inside me -- deep maths and computer science problems, nevertheless approachable and worth exploring to find elegant solutions. \n\nOver the next few months, I tried my luck on some of the problems that were discussed, especially the randomness problem. However, it would only be March 2019 that I left my startup and went to work on Ethereum 2.0 full time, so I would say that the concept of the beacon chain was by then fairly mature and what was left to be done was more tinkering around the edges.\n\nI think it is always worth reminding ourselves that the beacon chain itself, while only one part of Eth2.0, is a very ambitious project. As far as I am aware, Proof of Stake has never been tried on this scale: neither economically nor in the networking sense. What I mean by this is the sheer amount of funds that can be staked on the beacon chain, which due to the Ether market cap can easily approach billions of dollars in value. This is one advantage smaller projects certainly do have over Ethereum -- they can increase stake gradually, whereas Eth2.0 will very quickly go all the way.\n\nNot only that, but most other projects have refrained from actually imposing penalties on validators -- which compromises the security of PoS networks, but obviously makes designing it much easier, because literally nothing is at stake except for some very minor rewards.\n\nFinally, and this is the most important distinction, Eth2.0 is designed so that it can literally accommodate a million validators. That's pretty impressive considering that most other projects only support around 100! Not only that, but this feat is achievable using fairly modest node requirements, in fact it seems perfectly plausible to run a validator on a mobile phone or a Raspberry Pi.\n\nWhen we do launch the beacon chain, which is now truly imminent (barring extreme surprises), we should keep in mind just how ambitious this project is even on its own. \n\nThe beacon chain was essentially frozen 3 months after I joined the team full time, so I would not claim that I have made any major contributions to it. My most important contribution to Eth2.0 that is slated for inclusion so far is re-architecting the Proof of Custody construction so that it is fully suitable for SSVs (Secret Shared Validators). While we weren't too sure of the experimental cryptographic Legendre pseudo-random function (PRF) when we first came across it in March 2019, it has successively improved to a truly impressive construction on all fronts that I am now very proud of:\n\n1. Extended cryptoanalysis has improved our confidence in the Legendre PRF a lot in response to several bounties that we have set out.\n2. The combination of the Legendre PRF with the Universal Hash Function primitive, suggested by Dmitry Khovratovich, means that only a single evaluation of the PRF is needed per proof of custody, and the rest of the computation is extremely efficient and even faster than regular (sha256) hashing.\n3. Thanks to the probabilistic 0.01 bit proof of custody idea, only a small amount of information is leaked from the proof of custody, such that it would be impossible to gain access to custody secrets even if the Legendre PRF were broken outright.\n\nFinally, I have huge respect for Danny Ryan. He is phenomenal at keeping everything together and making it work.\n\n### Danny Ryan\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2017 \n\nSurprise! Everything is a bit harder than originally expected (at least from my perspective) - I suppose most of the things worth doing in life are. Today, I am very excited about the project and the progress. Eth2 has an incredibly strong technical background and is ready for the next wave of upgrades. Huge shout-out to the hard work from client teams, as well as to the validator community keeping this thing running.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the [beacon chain spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md).\n\nFinally, I don't want to imagine how this would have gone without protolambda's insight and technical contributions over the past couple of years.\n\n### Dmitriy Ryajov\n\n- Status¬† \n- libp2p developer\n- August 2019 \n\nSuper grueling, but rewarding in terms of overall impact on the different ecosystems, Eth2 itself, the Nim language and libp2p.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Nim libp2p implementation.\n\n### Hsiao-Wei Wang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Summer 2017 \n\nMy journey started with implementing Serenity‚Ñ¢. It was an ambitious and abstract concept. We've struggled with the design trade-offs for a long time, but with more and more contributors who devoted their efforts, and years of hard work, we were finally able to divide and conquer Eth2.\n\nIt was a fantastic journey to launch Phase 0 finally. I'm so grateful for the broad community support. And, of course, the Ethereum heroes who dove into Ethereum R&D.\n\nI'm very excited about the next Eth2 milestones and the creative ideas that the community will build on Eth2.\n\nI want to mention my admiration for Virgil Griffith, a pioneer that paved the way for Ethereum research work.\n\n[Seen and Seeing [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=30)\n\n### Ivan Martinez\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Engineer\n- August 2018 \n\nWorking on Eth2 has been an amazing adventure. It went from contributing in my free time to becoming my longest running full-time job. While there have been a few blocks on the way (unstable spec, implementation problems, testnet drama), it's been an absolute blast and this is just the start! Very excited to release, and move forward with future phases!\n\nI am particularly proud of building our [end-to-end testing suite](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/3932), which has proved incredibly useful for detecting issues before changes reach the canary. I've also helped build a lot of the [slasher](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5043) and optimized it for mainnet usage.\n\nOne of the most memorable bugs I encountered would have to be: [\"Change StreamIndexedAttestations to use target root for state regen #5971.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5971)\n\nShoutout to Terence Tsao! His ability to understand the spec has constantly amazed me (he's the largest contributor to the spec outside of the EF!).\n\nAlso.. Danny Ryan is awesome :)\n\n### Jacek Sieka\n\n- Status¬† \n- Research Lead\n- March 2018 \n\nI was fortunate to join Eth2 at the very start - having worked on many open source projects before, for fun, peer-to-peer networks like DC++, compilers like nlvm, as well as high-frequency trading. It all came together at that point like a perfect fit - a giant stroke of good luck. Here we are, years later, with the baby well on its way to being delivered.\n\nThe work I'm most proud of is managing to restore sanity and switching [Eth2 to Little Endian](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/139). It survived several high-profile attempts to swing it back to Big. I guess a more memorable, and certainly more involved feature, was the deep collaboration on the networking protocol that culminated with [what we have today](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1328) - this was quite the achievement made possible by some round-the-world collaboration with Adrian (of Sigma Prime), Ra√∫l (of libp2p) and lots of others! Less known is that me and Adrian resorted to flipping an Ethereum block hash coin to see who would get to post the PR :)\n\nI'm most proud of when Paul Hauner and I managed to run a fully independent, self-sufficient [multi-client Eth2 network](https://twitter.com/jcksie/status/1171886857908609024) for the first time, at the Canada retreat!\n\n### Jonny Rhea\n\n- Teku, TX/RX¬† \n- Client lead & TX/RX co-founder\n- November 2018 \n\n\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.\"\n\nParticularly proud of my Ethresearch post, [\"Packetology: Validator \nPrivacy.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/packetology-validator-privacy/7547) \n\nMost memorable bug: [\"DoS Attack on Prysm Stops Finality.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/public-attacknets/issues/12)\n\nShoutout to the Russians!

Most proud of my implementation of the deposit tree logic in Teku. Toughest bug was getting the \"is_valid_merkle_branch\" method working in Teku.\n\nShoutout to Jonny Rhea & Mikhail!\n\n### JosephC \n\n- ConsenSys¬† \n- R&D\n- January 2019 \n\nThe Beacon Chain launch is like Project Mercury: getting into space/orbit. The equivalents of Project Gemini and Project Apollo are needed next. Rollups and Layer 2 will help improve scalability, but I believe there is much innovation that can and should continue to be done in Layer 1. There is a place for some execution, and cross-shard transactions in Layer 1. I also think that we should be careful about assumptions that we might make, like assuming that cross-shard transactions must be asynchronous. The challenges in the Ethresearch thread [‚ÄúCross-shard DeFi composability‚Äù](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-defi-composability/6268/9) need tackling with minimal assumptions.\n\nI dream of a system that is more scalable, performant, but preserves the default atomicity and synchronicity of Ethereum. I dream of shards that are transparent and automatically load-balancing. It may sound impossible, but can be used to inspire the engineers of the world to build the ambitious system that we can envision.\n\nDevelopments like Apollo and the Internet are an encouraging reminder to what humanity can accomplish: where there's a will, there's a way.\n\nWhy is this important? Why is a platform for decentralized systems important? John Perry Barlow may have answered it with his [‚ÄúDeclaration of the Independence of Cyberspace.‚Äù](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)\n\nPersonally, I'm delighted that [\"The Beacon Chain Ethereum 2.0 explainer you need to read first\"](https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain/) is usually on the first page of Google for \"beacon chain.\" I'm most proud of forming and recruiting a talented R&D group at ConsenSys that has made numerous Ethereum contributions. For Eth2, these include a review of the deposit contract and influencing an important Solidity implementation. More well known is the Quilt team, which started from R&D of Eth2 Phase 2 (execution, threads [quilting], rather than Plasma). Finally, years ago I helped connect Karl Floersch to the Casper \"team\" at EDCON Paris.\n\nShoutout to all of Ethereum Layer 0 -- its people -- without which there would be no Layer 1 or beyond. Layer 0 always welcomes you, and all contributions great and small :)\n\n### Justin Drake\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Late 2017 \n\nLooking back, the beacon chain took longer than expected to ship and there is significant work remaining in the coming years. Having said that, I am incredibly optimistic and excited about the future of Ethereum‚ÄîI could not be more bullish :)\n\nI'm pretty proud of the fact that the beacon chain spec is executable - it's pretty remarkable IMO. How many complex internet protocols have a full executable spec, not to mention four production-grade implementations on day 1?\t\n\nOne of the \"design bugs\" I was involved with early on was having PoS and sharding be separate cryptoeconomic systems as opposed to one unified design. Another big design flaw was using plain (as opposed to aggregatable) signatures. Looking back, in ~2 years we took a visionary but very rough design and made it orders of magnitude better.\n\nFolks dedicated to Eth2 are a rare breed (less than 100 of us) and I have tremendous respect for the team as a whole, as well as many individuals. I will note that, with where things are headed, we may soon have trillions of dollars running on Eth2 and we will need more manpower. So I want to give a shoutout to you‚Äîthe reader‚Äîto consider joining the Ethereum mission :) Hit me up by email, on Twitter, or on Telegram!\n\n[Traditions [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=31)\n\n### Karl Floersch\n\n- prev. Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Winter 2017 \n\nIt has been a wild journey to scale Ethereum & we are ridiculously close to realizing the vision after all this time. It's pretty insane. I'm most proud of the early work I did on [Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/casper) and initial implementation of [Hybrid Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/tree/b704a5c6577863edc539a1ec3d2620a443b950fb/ethereum/hybrid_casper). As for bugs, the pyethereum p2p layer was absolutely terrible and really crippled the testnet :'''(\n\nShoutout to Vitalik, Hsiao-Wei Wang, & Justin Drake!\n\n### Kirk Baird\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt's been a very busy two years; as only my second job working in IT, the learning curve has been massive. First and most importantly, my understanding of the core technologies around blockchains has matured from seeing them as a secure linked list to the complex beast they are. With the focus of my work being on integrating BLS into Lighthouse, a significant knowledge of pairing based cryptography was needed. The BLS signature scheme is far more complicated than the existing ECDSA used in Eth1. Luckily, there are a lot of good resources out there which explain how to progress from classical elliptic curve cryptography to pairing based cryptography.\n\nI was lucky enough to go to DevCon Osaka in 2019 which was an amazing experience! There were so many keen minds all meeting to relish and enjoy the progress Ethereum has made, but also to provide insights and ideas on how it will be improved and developed over the coming years. Japan itself is also an amazing place with so much to see, until we almost got stuck in a typhoon.\n\nI am most proud of the work done on [Milagro BLS](https://github.com/sigp/milagro_bls). This library was rough around the edges when I first inherited it, being a long way from the standardised signature scheme we have now.\n\nFinally, wanted to give a shoutout to Danny Ryan! The man is a weapon.\n\n### Mamy Andr√©-Ratsimbazafy\n\n- Status¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nI remember reading the \"70% ready\" spec in july 2018, that was the wild wild west. Things were on a HackMD document, changes were made every 6 hours and very hard to track - as mentioned in the EthCC 2 talk [\"Tests and Simulations of Eth2.0.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c4mQg5L6Rs&t=597s)\n\nOne of the most significant milestones was when, out of nowhere, all 7 clients at the time were able to create a testnet back in September 2019 in Muskoka. Anticipation, apprehension, will the launch work? If yes, that is definitely a huge milestone!\n\nI'm proud of my work on the [\"Auditors Handbook to Nimbus Beacon Chain.\"](https://nimbus.guide/auditors-book/01_introduction.html) Nimbus uses a dark horse language called Nim. It happens to be easily picked up, and our 3 audit teams were pleasantly surprised by its features, including those related to correctness.\n\nThe most infamous bugs we had were related to fork choice / Proof-of-Stake. The most infamous one would be this one-liner hotfix, where some votes were skipped in period of non-finality: [\"hotfix fork choice score application #2041.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/2041/files)\n\nBig respect to Protolambda! He came like the Hagibis storm.\n\n### Matt Garnett \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Researcher\n- January 2019 \n\nMy perspective on eth2 is probably very different from many people who were focused on Phase 0. Although I compartmentalized Phase 0 and Phase 1 to a large degree to allow myself to consider the possibilities of Phase 2, I never considered the possibility that eth2 wouldn't ship. To me, it was not a matter of \"if\" but \"when.\"\n\nI'm proud of the work I did writing the first Execution Environment for eth2, called [\"sheth.\"](https://github.com/quilt/sheth) It was completely stateless and allowed Ether transfers within a shard. \n\nShoutout to Proto, he has been instrumental in making eth2 happen, I don't know how he manages to be so prolific.\n\nA quick story to wrap up. On the first day of the Canada interop, the Quilt team drove up from Toronto in a 15-person passenger van. It had rained a bit so the area was sort of wet. The venue was tucked away off on a gravel road, right beside the lake. We pulled the van up next to the parked cars and headed in to visit with the eth2 teams. \n\nAfter catching up with everyone, we returned to the van to drive over to the airbnb we were sharing with the ewasm team. Will Villanueva had driven us there, so he hopped in the driver's seat and began orienting the van forwards to head out. The area we had parked in was sort of a T-intersection and there were small drop-offs (0.5m maybe) into a heavily wooded ditch anywhere there wasn't road. Will backed into one of the legs of the T and started to drive forward to leave. Unfortunately, the exit path was a rather steep gravel hill. The 2WD van didn't have the traction climb out and now we were positioned at an awkward angle in the T. The van was perilously close to tipping over into the ditch. Will backed up to a flatter part to regroup. I offered to give it a shot and he obliged. \n\nAt this point, we had drawn a bit of a crowd. I recall having people at each corner of the van, keeping an eye out to help avoid falling off into the ditch. I gave it a few attempts, but realized how difficult of a situation we were in. At this point, it was unclear if we could even return to our starting place, as the front left and back right of the van were less than a foot away from falling into the ditch - a ditch that would no doubt require a tow truck to collect the van from. There was no other option than making it up the hill. Fortunately, there was a bit of flatter ground between the van and the beginning of the hill. Although it would be a tight fit, likely inches on either side into the wooded ditch, I thought that with speed we should be able to build enough momentum to get past the steep portion of the hill. I shared my plan with the spectators. Unsurprisingly, the uninvested patrons were eager to fill me with confidence so they could enjoy the spectacle. I backed up the van as far as the gravel road would allow and then slammed the gas down. The van lurched forward, albeit lethargically, towards the top of the hill. The eth2 gods were almost certainly looking down on us in that moment and guided that van safely to the hill's peak. \n\nAt the top of the hill, I collected my emotions and then stepped out to enjoy the laughing and cheering. We inspected the ridiculous situation we had been in, and examined the ruts that the tires had made spinning out on the fail attempts. After the excitement died down and the spectators returned to the venue to continue working on their clients, we headed back up the hill to our van and drove home. \n\nFor the rest of the time there, we parked the van at the top of the hill and walked down to the venue.\n\n### Mehdi Zerouali\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Security Engineer, Cofounder\n- October 2018 \n\nI find it hard to believe that we're finally launching the beacon chain! So much hard work from so many different entities has gone into this over the past couple of years. I'm extremely proud of what Sigma Prime has accomplished so far and look forward to the Lighthouse crew making Phase 1, Phase 1.5 and Phase 2 a reality.\n\nThe structural differential fuzzer I've helped build as part of Beacon Fuzz is definitely something I'm proud of. Over the last few months, Beacon Fuzz helped uncover more than 40+ bugs on all major client implementations, including critical consensus related vulnerabilities.\n\nIt's hard to pick one person to recognize, but Diederik Loerakker (aka protolambda) has done such an amazing job helping the client teams navigate the optimisations required to implement the eth2 spec in production. Of course, the coordination job done by Danny Ryan is second to none. I doubt we'd be where we are today without these two exceptional individuals.\n\nFun fact: Lighthouse releases are named after Rick & Morty characters!\n\n### Meredith Baxter\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer, Software Engineer\n- November 2019 \n\nI was fortunate to join the Teku team at an exciting time (about a year ahead of the beacon chain launch) in November of 2019. We had a lot of work ahead of us and we weren't sure whether or not we would meet launch deadline with a fully functional, production-ready client. The learning curve to understanding eth2 is also pretty steep, which only increased the pressure. Luckily, the EF and other eth2 client teams have been an incredible resource for us throughout the development process. The engineers involved across the client teams have been very open and supportive. And the EF researchers have been amazingly welcoming, approachable, and responsive. They've always been there for us to answer questions and provide insights. It has been hugely gratifying to be a part of the successful launch of the beacon chain with the help of this incredible group of people. I'm very excited to continue the work as we look forward to upcoming changes including our first hard fork, sharding, and the merge.\t\n\nOne exciting milestone was getting [Teku syncing to a live](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/1143) testnet (Prysm's Sapphire testnet).\n\nI'm also really proud of our [checkpoint sync feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz3flfj50Ig) which allows new nodes to sync up and become fully operational within minutes. See the issue as well: \"[Implement sync from a recent state #3063](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/issues/3063).\"\n\nThe instability on the Medalla testnet in the fall of 2020 was a trying moment across the client teams, but we came out stronger on the other side. We were all working overtime to improve performance and patch issues revealed by the long period of non-finalization. One big fix I managed to push during this time involved putting a hard limit on amount of work required to regenerate states that dropped out of our in-memory cache: [\"[Issue 2608] Add ability to periodically persist hot states #2611.\"](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/2611) More context on the network instability can be found here: [\"Eth2 Implementers‚Äô Call #46 - 2020-08-20.\"](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/S1b2sJhzv)\n\n### Michael Sproul\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nAfter a brief foray into the blockchain world in 2017, I developed a taste for it and knew I had to come back. When I saw a job ad from SigP on Twitter for a proof-of-stake client in Rust, I dropped what I was doing and got involved ASAP. At the beginning I got deep into Lighthouse's consensus code which was then very much in flux due to lots of spec changes, and had been written in a gargantuan solo effort by Paul! From that foothold in consensus I then branched out into the database, op pool and slashing -- all of which captured my interest in a way no other project had. \n\nWhen we ran the first testnets in September 2019 off code I'd contributed to, I was kind of shocked the thing worked at all, and awed by all the hard work done by everyone else involved. This community of researchers, programmers and enthusiasts has been nothing but amazing, and I'm optimistic for a successful Phase 0 launch and the realisation of the Eth2 dream in Phase 1 and beyond. Personally, I can't wait until we can run some transactions, and look forward to getting into the minutiae of WebAssembly execution environments.\t\n\nI'm very proud of Lighthouse's slasher. I was able to draw inspiration from great foundational research laid by Proto, and dedicate myself to building a fast, concise implementation. Testing the implementation on Medalla and watching the carnage inflicted on other validators brought a perverse form of satisfaction ;)\n\nOne of my favorite bugs: [\"DB inconsistent after restart #1488.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/1488)\n\nShoutout to Cem √ñzer!\n\nI know of at least one core dev who force pushed a commit to master in the EthDenver bathrooms...\n\n### Mikhail Kalinin\n\n- PegaSys, TX/RX¬† \n- Applied Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nIt's been exciting to see how Hybrid Casper FFG and the Sharding proposal have been merged into what is now called the Beacon Chain. And how this research is evolving, growing, attracting a lot of new people. And finally the result is about to be shipped pretty soon. This was a big part of my life for two and a half years. I anticipate rapid movement towards Shards and the Merge when Phase 0 is shipped. Though there are many things yet to deal with.\n\nI am proud of the [Eth1 Shard Demo](https://github.com/txrx-research/eth1-shard-demo) that we made together with Guillaume from EF with decent support from EF researchers.\n\nI can give recognition to a bunch of people tbh. But, narrowing down, Danny Ryan and Ben Edgington.\n\n### Nathaniel Jensen\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Security Engineer\n- September 2019 \n\nI'd heard a bit about Ethereum before but had not developed a solid understanding.\n\nAlthough relatively new, I'm glad to play a small part in such a technically impressive undertaking. I am continually appreciative that I can work in such an interesting space, with such friendly and impressive colleagues and community, and contribute to something that has the potential to be profoundly important. I'm excited to see Phase 0 mainnet kick off, the culmination of so much effort!\n\nI look forward seeing the space continue to develop with the incorporation of the EVM chain and Layer 2 solutions, and all the interesting use-cases that I can't begin to imagine.\n\nMy primary contribution to the Eth2 ecosystem had been taking on maintenance and development of a differential fuzzer that compares state transitions across the Eth2 clients: beacon-fuzz. In September 2019, Sigma Prime was engaged by the Ethereum Foundation to continue development of Guido Vranken's previous differential fuzzing solution - comparing ZRNT and Pyspec, the Go and Python Eth2.0 executable specifications.\n\nI was primarily responsible for building out [the fuzzing framework](https://github.com/sigp/beacon-fuzz) to include comparison of other client implementations: Lighthouse, Prysm, Nimbus, Teku, Trinity, as well as adding fuzzing targets for additional state transition functions.\n\nAs for most painful bug, see the [\"Beacon Fuzz update 001\"](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/beacon-fuzz-01.html) on the Sigma Prime blog, section \"Golang Library Linking Errors.\" How to try to get multiple Go implementations running without having their dependencies clash, and dealing with arcane linking issues using existing tooling to build a Go fuzzing library that exercises cgo/C code (as Prysm depends on a C/assembly BLS library).\n\nI want to give a shoutout to Protolambda (Diederik Loerakker). He reliably gets to the bottom of really obtuse fuzzing results. He's our consistent fallback for deciphering complicated results across multiple Eth2 client implementations. From our interactions, he clearly comes across as a friendly, genuine, and technically outstanding individual.\n\n### Nishant Das\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- June 2018 \n\nIt was a very difficult endeavour to get Eth2 running smoothly. Ultimately, with teams well distributed across the globe, constant communication is always a challenge. However, despite all that, I am really proud of the fact that we have launched Phase 0 with 4 different clients running. I'm very optimistic for the future and am looking forward to the merge. There have been too many bugs to count, and I keep on finding new ones every week.\n\nShoutout to Proto - cross client compatibility would be nowhere near what it is without him constantly monitoring and working on it.\n\n### Paul Hauner\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has fostered an inclusive, open, and merit-based approach to technical collaboration. Under this environment we've seen many researchers, engineers and communicators flourish. This is a testament to what people can do when they share a common goal and are empowered to work on the things that interest them.\n\nAs Eth2 has progressed, Sigma Prime has grown steadily to include a team of talented engineers and computer scientists. I am grateful to work with these people and I learn from them every day.\n\nI hope to see Ethereum evolve into a tool that provides honest utility to everyday people, without jeopardising the sovereignty of their data or selves.\n\nRegarding work I'm proud of, I quite like the [minimal-allocation Merkle-tree hasher](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/consensus/tree_hash/src/merkle_hasher.rs) I built in 2018. It's simpler and more powerful than other algorithms I have seen.\n\nOne notable bug: [\"Manipulating deposit contract to gain an early majority #1446.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1446)\n\n### Pawan Dhananjay\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2019 \n\nI remember reading Vitalik's proof of stake blog posts in early 2018 and thinking that it sounds all good in theory, but no way we'll have a proof of stake protocol for more than a small number of participants which would work well in practice. Needless to say, it's been extremely impressive to see how far the effort has come in just a few years. Kudos to everyone involved, I'm glad to have been a part of the effort for the past year.\n\nAlso, a huge shoutout to the SigP crew! It has been an absolute blast working with these guys, learning from them and also indulging in their jolly Aussie humor :) Excited for the Phase 0 launch and geared up to begin work on Phase 1!\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be: [\"Update state before producing attestation #1596.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/1596)\n\nBig thanks to protolambda for sure. All his debugging tools have saved me (and many others I'm sure) hours of effort.\n\n### Preston Van Loon\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe last few years have been an adventure, to say the least. At first, I had just a mild interest in Ethereum. I didn't own any cryptocurrencies or really understand how they worked. After a few months of reading, I started to realize two things: 1) Ethereum was this incredible technology that has an unlimited potential to change the world for the better, and 2) Ethereum is incredibly slow and desperately needed to scale. \n\nImmediately, I looked for ways to help contribute to the scaling effort and then I met Raul Jordan. We met together in NYC for coffee and talked about starting a project to work on sharding for Ethereum. We formed Prysmatic Labs. Since starting the company in January of 2018, I've met some of the most interesting people in the world - many have become close friends. Working in Ethereum continues to fulfill my desire to make a positive impact, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the completed roll out of Eth2.\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be that time that all of Prysm nodes thought they were 4 hours in the future and thousands of validators were slashed in a testnet: [\"Roughtime reports clock offset by 4hrs #6825.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/6825)\n\n### Protolambda\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- November 2018 \n\nThe main theme is that we - researchers and client devs - did not make our lives easy. Spec updates have continued to improve the protocol itself, but caused instability in the process of updating implementations. A new network stack was adopted, and many difficult research and implementation problems had to be solved. In the future, I do not think this will change, as Phase 1 and later are complicated too. But the approach can be improved. Exploratory single-client implementation ahead of others could avoid duplicating work for other clients, and enable faster spec updates.\n\nMost memorable bug: [\"247120: encoding/binary: read at most MaxVarintLen64 bytes in ReadUvarint.\"](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/247120)\n\nShoutout to @Butta for his work on the beaconchain explorer.\n\n### Rados≈Çaw Kapka\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Software Engineer\n- May 2020 \n\nWhat struck me most when I joined the project was the seemingly infinite amount of good will and patience from others when onboarding a new contributor. I really appreciate it. As for the future, I fail to see how Eth2 can not succeed when there are so many great people working on it.\n\nShoutout to the whole Prysmatic team! Everyone is so cool I can't just pick one person.\n\nI planned to visit Japan in the summer of 2020 and start learning Eth2 after coming back. The pandemic ruined my plans so I joined the Prysm project in May as a contributor. Three months later I got invited to be one of the core team members. Pretty cool, huh? I guess 2020 is not that bad after all.\n\n### Raul Jordan\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nWe went from being a bunch of hobbyists and volunteers interested in Ethereum's future, to having a ton of responsibility with a client being used by a large portion of stakers today. Core dev work was indistinguishable from magic to me before starting on this, and it honestly still is. However, I am fortunate to be surrounded by people much smarter than I am, and constantly learning how to write better code. Every day, we feel the weight of the work we do and we foresee it will only keep getting more important, as Phases 1 and 2 develop and eventually Ethereum will be powering world-scale transaction volume, likely using the code we wrote. At some point, the blockchain we are building might have multinational implications, and the hard work from the research team to make it as robust as possible is very encouraging. I could not be any happier with how far it‚Äôs come along, and we'll ship it.\n\nI am most proud of our [original eth2 API](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/ethereumapis). One day I was hanging out with Preston and Terence and we‚Äôre like ‚Äúwhoa! Etherscan built a block explorer using our API for eth2??‚Äù and then beaconcha.in popped up and it was honestly mind-blowing. We spent a lot of time putting it together and it contributed to the success of the Prysm client early on.\n\nOur most memorable bug would have to be the [Medalla Testnet Incident](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-medalla-testnet-incident-f7fbc3cc934a).\n\nI admire my team at Prysmatic Labs. I look up to them every week in awe of their resourcefulness, prescience, and just overall raw software engineering knowledge.\n\nOur journey with eth2 started with a few of us posting in a go-ethereum gitter channel regarding starting a prototype implementation of Vitalik‚Äôs sharding FAQ. Little did we know that just a few months later, we would be neck deep into everything about proof of stake and sharding with Vitalik and the Ethereum Research team in Taipei. Coincidentally, I was visiting New York the same week I met Preston online via gitter, and managed to meet up in his office and start Prysmatic Labs officially within the next few days!\n\n### Robert Drost \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Project Manager\n- August 2018 \n\nLooking back, one remarkable thing that stands out to me is the unifying culture of optimism and positivity among the people who found Eth and Eth2 and dove into working on it. Kind of by self-selection over time, it's a community that wants to strive for the positive side of things. While it‚Äôs not always possible to maintain this, somehow over time it seems to always get back there again.\n\nMoving forward, two themes I look forward to will be the acceleration of innovation and delivery around Eth2, and the growth of bridging among Eth2 and most other crypto communities and protocols that matter.\n\nShoutout to Casey Detrio ‚Äî I love how he always seems to find a novel analysis angle to things!\n\n### Sam Wilson \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Protocol Research Engineer\n- October 2019 \n\nWell, I'm a relative newcomer to Ethereum. I'd been vaguely aware of Ethereum for years, and I had (and still have) a couple hundredths of a bitcoin lying around, but Devcon V was jumping head first into the space.\n\nThe Ethereum community, once you get past all the... crap on the fringe, is full of really welcoming people who come from really diverse philosophies. I found that particularly surprising, given how many scammers and hangers on there are.\n\nEth2, which is actually where I started learning Ethereum, is a huge undertaking being built by an equally huge amorphous conglomeration. Seeing the discussions from execution environments and WASM to pure data availability and minimal execution, and the journey from where we were a year ago to actually getting the beacon chain launched has been one of the most exciting periods of my career so far.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next phases, layers, and whatever else comes with Eth2, but more importantly, I'm excited for the memes, because really, that's what this is all about.\n\nIt's hard to compare what I've contributed with the amazing other things going on in the space, but I guess I'd have to say that the write-up on dynamic state access that Ansgar Dietrichs and I put together is probably the most influential thing I've worked on: [\"State Provider Models in Ethereum 2.0.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/state-provider-models-in-ethereum-2-0/6750)\n\n### Shay Zluf\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nLooking back on this past two years makes me feel how this space is being shaped by the people who build it, their values and their convictions. Working in Prysmatic Labs developed my skills and code quality in a way that I cannot describe. Raul Jordan and Preston van Loon make sure to lead by example. All the team members are super motivated and take eth2.0's success as their own responsibility. That kind of dedication comes only from taking part in a project that has higher purpose for each member of the team. Looking forward, I see those bright and enthusiastic figures attracting many more talented people into the eth2.0 effort, while step by step the Ethereum ecosystem becomes the collaboration infrastructure of humanity.\n\nI took part in kickstarting the slasher implementation in Prysm's code base. As context, old POS systems had a major flaw, called the \"nothing at stake problem.\" Policing the set of rules to avoid this on the massive scale of the beacon chain is a challenge. Solving this led to the design and implementation of the Prysmatic Labs slasher. Working with other team members and protolambda from the eth2.0 research team was a great privilege. I got a first hand experience of protolambda‚Äôs ingenuity in finding novel solutions to hard problems.\n\nShoutout goes to Preston Van Loon.\n\n### Stefan Talpalaru\n\n- Status¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2018 \n\nWe're moving at what probably looks like a slow pace, from the outside, but I'm confident we'll be able to replace Proof of Work with Proof of Stake. I can't wait to see the estimates for energy consumption reduction in the years to come!\n\nI'm proud of the many changes that lead to reproducible builds. It all started with replacing a language-specific package manager with Makefiles and Git submodules, in order to have a fine-grained control over all our dependencies. Over time, it grew into a somewhat reusable [\"build system.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-build-system)\n\nI also liked designing and implementing well-defined components like our [metrics library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-metrics/) or the [NAT traversal library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-nat-traversal). Much messier, but equally rewarding, was changing the Nim compiler and standard library to implement [efficient stack traces](https://github.com/status-im/nim-libbacktrace).\n\nI like hunting down mysterious stack corruptions. A memorable one was due to the wrong calling convention being used in a [C library wrapper](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/677#issuecomment-575636421). Another [nice one](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/issues/640#issuecomment-57008484) was triggered by a procedure parameter called \"errno\" (which the Nim compiler forgot to name-mangle).\n\n### Terence Tsao\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt has been an amazing journey, we have learned and accomplished so much along the way. Lots of great memories and friendships were formed. \n\nWith Phase 0 heading towards finish line, I'm particular excited about Phase 1 and all its cutting edge research. Go Eth2!\n\n### Victor Farazdagi\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Engineer\n- February 2020 \n\nMy Ethereum journey started in 2016, when I joined Status in building a censorship-resistant messenger. It quickly became apparent that, despite all the goodness the Ethereum platform and its decentralized network brought, in its current implementation they are relatively limited. So, getting attracted to Ethereum 2, with all its ambitious plans to revamp an already hugely innovative product, was just a matter of time for me. Right now, being part of the amazing crowd of highly motivated, even idealistic, people - with a chance to participate in delivering on the original Ethereum promises - is nothing less than a dream come true. I love the community, the leadership, and even the complexity of the software we're building. With Phase 0 behind us, we have significant momentum, so 2021 will definitely become a year of groundbreaking accomplishments!\n\nOne bit of work I am particularly proud of is the [\"initial synchronization implementation,\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/tree/develop/beacon-chain/sync/initial-sync) which absolutely every beacon-node runner relies on. So, whenever you cannot sync, or sync takes forever, you know who to blame for it now!\n\nRegarding nasty bugs, during the [\"Medalla incident\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/7039) in August 2020, we had troubles syncing back. While the fix was easy, discovering the problem wasn't.\n\nShoutout to Diederik Loerakker! (yeah, better known as protolambda)\n\n### Vitalik Buterin\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- January 2014 \n\nI'm really happy to see how far the Ethereum ecosystem has come in the last few years! In the dark old days back in 2014-2017, it was just myself, Vlad and a couple other people thinking about proof of stake and sharding, and progress was slow; since then, there has been a rapid growth, professionalization and general improvement in the ecosystem and the team. We have much more sophisticated tools, are dealing with advanced cryptography, and a much better process for creating and refining the spec and the implementations. 2020 eth2 is sooo much better than Casper in 2017!\n\nNow, of course, we enter what may perhaps prove to be the most difficult part of the whole process: getting eth2 actually out the door and running. The whole process reminds me of what we had to deal with back in 2015, except this time there's 10x the complexity, 100x more people watching and 1000x the value at stake. Good luck all :)\n\nIf I had to pick one component I'm proud of .. maybe [the entire phase 0 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md)?\n\nShoutout to Danny.\n\n### Will Villanueva\n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Researcher\n- February 2018 \n\nEth2 research was overwhelmingly fun. We explored pushing the boundaries on how the execution layer could operate. We prototyped, researched, and implemented a simpler version of advanced execution (Execution Environments) on eth1, also known as account abstraction.\n\nA lot of the work Quilt pursued is covered in the post titled [\"Ethereum 2.0 Phase 2 Progress.\"](https://medium.com/@william.j.villanueva/ethereum-2-0-phase-2-progress-7673b57eabff) \n\nAdditionally, some of our account abstraction work can be found on Ethresear.ch as [\"DoS Vectors in Account Abstraction (AA) or Validation Generalization, a Case Study in Geth.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/dos-vectors-in-account-abstraction-aa-or-validation-generalization-a-case-study-in-geth/7937)\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan, all the way!\n\n[Onward [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=32)\n\n---\n\n*Kudos for reading to the end!

I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn‚Äôt meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you‚Äôd think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend‚Äôs living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn‚Äôt just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it‚Äôs not just a technology. It‚Äôs a philosophy. It‚Äôs a belief system. It‚Äôs a way of viewing the world. It‚Äôs about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you‚Äôre batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood. I remember the ‚Äúaha moment‚Äù when I wrote my first smart contract. With just a few lines of code and a private key, I was able to transfer an internet-native currency anywhere in the world in seconds. \n\nI didn‚Äôt have to sign up for Stripe. I didn‚Äôt have to use the Plaid API to connect a bank account. I didn‚Äôt have to check if TransferWise supported payments for a specific country. There was no centralized party. Just a peer-to-peer cryptonetwork called Ethereum. It was pretty damn mindblowing.\n\nAfter the first few weeks at Dharma, I was confident that DeFi and crypto were the future. But I also got the itch to work on some of my own ideas. I wanted to build software for creative people. Writers. Artists. Musicians. Online teachers. I strongly believe our world depends on these types of people having the tools they need to serve their communities as best they can.\n\nFrankly, I also thought it would take a couple years before the crypto industry had the infrastructure in place for a mainstream consumer app to be built.\n\n\nSo I ended up leaving Dharma to take some time off and explore a few startup ideas. But a couple months ago I read a [manifesto](https://cryptomedia.wtf/) by [Zora](https://zora.co/) that changed how I thought about crypto.\n\nIt described a world where crypto could be used to give any digital media file (eg an image, a song, an essay, digital art, etc.) property rights. It explained how cryptonetworks could turn digital media into liquid financial assets, secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts.\n\nAlthough the individual ideas weren‚Äôt new, they were combined and articulated in a way that just made sense. And not just to me.\n\n[Digital artists](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9), [athletes](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html), [social media influencers](https://cryptoslate.com/logan-paul-nfts-sell-3-5-million-worth-on-first-day-of-release/), [tech executives](https://scottbelsky.medium.com/the-furry-lisa-cryptoart-the-new-economy-of-digital-creativity-6cb2300ea081), [media executives](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI), and [journalists](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1366554892035219462) that never took the crypto weirdos seriously, seem to be taking notice.\n\nBut let‚Äôs be real. Is this latest NFT craze a bubble? Probz. Yet, is there at least a kernel of value in the idea of ownership over creative work? I think so.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell, there‚Äôs been a lot of talk about high transaction fees and lack of scalability in these systems. Although I do think these problems should and will get fixed, a lack of technical scalability is kinda the point.\n\nCryptonetworks trade off technical scalability for social scalability.\n\nFacebook is technically scalable because it‚Äôs a social network that processes millions of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is socially scalable because it‚Äôs a trillion dollar economic network without a centralized authority.\n\nCrypto isn‚Äôt just a technological revolution. It‚Äôs also a revolution in capital formation and human coordination. How creative projects are funded. How groups of people are incentivized. How organizations are structured.\n\nYears from now, when I‚Äôm old and senile, I believe we‚Äôll look back at this period as an [Internet Renaissance](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1343210395704541189) of sorts. \n\nA time where we dared to fight back against systems that have been designed for centuries to elevate certain groups and keep others disenfranchised.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe all this crypto stuff really is just an intellectual ideal that‚Äôll never work in practice. Regardless, I think it‚Äôs at least worth trying.\n", "timestamp": 1625670118, "digest": "pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

And not just to me.\n\n[Digital artists](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9), [athletes](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html), [social media influencers](https://cryptoslate.com/logan-paul-nfts-sell-3-5-million-worth-on-first-day-of-release/), [tech executives](https://scottbelsky.medium.com/the-furry-lisa-cryptoart-the-new-economy-of-digital-creativity-6cb2300ea081), [media executives](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI), and [journalists](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1366554892035219462) that never took the crypto weirdos seriously, seem to be taking notice.\n\nBut let‚Äôs be real. Is this latest NFT craze a bubble? Probz. Yet, is there at least a kernel of value in the idea of ownership over creative work? I think so.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell, there‚Äôs been a lot of talk about high transaction fees and lack of scalability in these systems. Although I do think these problems should and will get fixed, a lack of technical scalability is kinda the point.\n\nCryptonetworks trade off technical scalability for social scalability.\n\nFacebook is technically scalable because it‚Äôs a social network that processes millions of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is socially scalable because it‚Äôs a trillion dollar economic network without a centralized authority.\n\nCrypto isn‚Äôt just a technological revolution. It‚Äôs also a revolution in capital formation and human coordination. How creative projects are funded. How groups of people are incentivized. How organizations are structured.\n\nYears from now, when I‚Äôm old and senile, I believe we‚Äôll look back at this period as an [Internet Renaissance](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1343210395704541189) of sorts. \n\nA time where we dared to fight back against systems that have been designed for centuries to elevate certain groups and keep others disenfranchised.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe all this crypto stuff really is just an intellectual ideal that‚Äôll never work in practice. Regardless, I think it‚Äôs at least worth trying.", "timestamp": 1625670143, "digest": "pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

{"id": "WsHW7ULZhaap-4rwbcwWOJESBptq5TownnB1ZoqtCsY", "title": "A beginner‚Äôs guide to NFTs", "body": "### What are NFTs?\nNon-fungible token (NFT) is a term used to describe a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. Assets that can be represented as NFTs range from digital goods, such as items that exist within virtual worlds, to claims on physical assets such as clothing items or real estate. In the coming years, we will see NFTs used to unlock entirely new use cases that are only made possible by crypto.\n\nTokens redeemable for real world goods on Zora\n\nTokens redeemable for real world goods on Zora\nWhile the Ethereum ecosystem is where most NFT activity has taken place to date, NFTs can exist on other smart contract platforms too. This is because, at their core, NFTs are just digital abstractions used to represent assets that are one of a kind. Non-fungible token isn‚Äôt the most intuitive term since we don‚Äôt commonly refer to the fungibility of objects in the physical world, but this is an important technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain. The goal for this post is not to detail every project within the NFT space, but to give a high level overview of what NFTs are, why they are interesting, and showcase some of their potential use cases.\n\n### Why are NFTs interesting?\nNFTs are powerful because, when combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to issue, own, and trade them. This makes interacting with NFTs significantly more efficient than in traditional platforms. The same reason why cryptocurrency used in payments is more efficient than traditional payments, that it is borderless and significantly easier to transfer, applies to NFTs. For example, if you want to create tradable in-game items as a game developer, then you can instantly have them be tradable through protocols that allow for decentralized exchange of NFTs. You don‚Äôt have to create your own marketplace or go through the onboarding process of a centralized platform in order to have the items be tradable.\n\nNFT activity can go well past trading and include actions like being able to borrow and lend, support fractional ownership (e.g. NIFTEX), or use it as collateral in taking out a loan (e.g. NFTfi). The possibilities are endless when you have the ability to combine NFTs with DeFi building blocks. For example, the game Aavegotchi combines DeFi and NFT gaming where each Aavegotchi character represents a user‚Äôs collateral that is deposited within the lending platform Aave, but you can also battle the characters, level them up, and equip wearables that change their traits.\n\nAavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi\n\nAavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi\nNFTs can cover an extremely wide variety of areas given they are simply digital representations of ownership but there has been significant growth within art and gaming in particular. Note that many digital works of art and gaming items are a subset of a larger category of NFT collectibles. There is also the emerging space of social tokens, which sometimes falls into the NFT category or that is closely related to it.\n\nArt\nNFTs can make fractionalized ownership more accessible, so if there is a valuable item that otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have been accessible for someone to own, now they can own a piece of it. Custody of a physical item still requires a trustworthy custodian, but being able to issue, hold, and trade it as a cryptoasset unlocks more use cases. One can also craft an NFT such that the creator receives a percentage of all secondary sales in a completely automated way. Artists typically don‚Äôt receive a cut of secondary sales in the traditional art world.\n\nProgrammable art is another interesting concept where a piece of artwork can incorporate on-chain data to dynamically update certain features or characteristics of the work. For example, one could create a piece of programmable art whose background changes if the price of ether goes above a certain dollar-value. There are countless creative possibilities.\n\nRutger van der Tas artwork that changes based on if it‚Äôs day or night\n\nRutger van der Tas artwork that changes based on if it‚Äôs day or night\nAsync Art is a digital art marketplace known for programmable art. Many artists on Async sell artwork where someone is able to own the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù copy which consists of a number of individual layers, but other people can own the individual layers and adjust their attributes over time. Imagine groups of people being able to own art collectively, where members of the group manage attributes of the work.\n\nOsinachi artwork that includes a master and layers that can be individually adjusted\n\nOsinachi artwork that includes a master and layers that can be individually adjusted\nA common question about digital artwork is what can you do with it? These works can be displayed in digital frames in a physical setting for people to enjoy. The digital artist Beeple sold physical tokens along with his digital NFTs and made $3.5 million from sales in an auction on the Nifty Gateway marketplace.\n\nArtist Beeple‚Äôs physical token that came with the NFT sale\n\nArtist Beeple‚Äôs physical token that came with the NFT sale\nDigital artwork can also be displayed in online collections like a SuperRare profile as well as in virtual worlds. There are a number of art galleries within Cryptovoxels, a virtual world where users can buy and sell land parcels as NFTs. As virtual reality spaces become more popular, having digital art to display will become more common. This wouldn‚Äôt be much different than someone spending money on video game items to customize a character‚Äôs appearance, already a multi-billion dollar industry.\n\nDigital art gallery in Cryptovoxels\n\nDigital art gallery in Cryptovoxels\nA common skepticism is that someone can just take a screenshot of the image or get a digital file so it‚Äôs not really scarce. However, the same argument could apply to physical items as well. Anyone can take a photo of the Mona Lisa or create a replica of it, but it isn‚Äôt the real item from the artist. People are willing to pay a premium for the original work. Another interesting aspect of digital art or collectibles is that you can easily verify the item‚Äôs ownership history. Some digital items might be worth more depending on who owned it in the past.\n\nWith NFTs, you can also prove that the item is real and tamper proof. This is an issue in the physical collectibles space. For example, a T206 Honus Wagner baseball card was sold to Wayne Gretzky for $451k and sold again for several million dollars. One of the sellers of the card later admitted in court to trimming the card‚Äôs edges to make it look better. You can ensure NFT supply doesn‚Äôt change and there‚Äôs no counterfeit or continued printing. For example, there are many counterfeit Black Lotus cards in the popular game Magic: The Gathering. Common verification methods include bending the card to make sure it doesn‚Äôt crease or going through centralized grading services whose rating significantly affects the card's value.\n\nGaming\nSteam, a popular video game platform, has a Community Market where in-game items can be bought and sold. Steam‚Äôs marketplace is centralized and collects a transaction fee of 5% for each item from the buyer. Games like Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 take an additional fee of 10% for their items sold.\n\nSteam Community Market\n\nSteam Community Market\nSteam also restricts user wallet balances to $2,000 and the price of a single item to $1,800. While these cases are outliers, many in-game items can actually sell for significantly larger amounts such as the DotA 2 pink war dog courier for $38,000. Within the crypto space there have also been high priced sales such as the $170,000 CryptoKitty. Similarly Magic: The Gathering‚Äôs coveted Black Lotus card sold for $166,100. There is certainly demand for valuable in-game items. In decentralized marketplaces, there isn‚Äôt a limit imposed on what game items can be sold and for what amount.\n\nDecentralized marketplaces can significantly reduce transaction fees due to the improved efficiency of starting up and operating a marketplace. Marketplaces can also improve overall user experience and increase interest in the game. Hearthstone is a wildly popular digital collectible card game created by Blizzard Entertainment that had over 100 million players in 2018. Hearthstone opted to not have a marketplace for their cards which leaves opportunity for other digital collectible card games that allow for an open marketplace. Gods Unchained and SkyWeaver are two trading card games (TCGs) that have cards that are freely tradable. You are also able to earn cards as you level up in the game. Players that did not purchase packs of cards will still be able to improve upon the game‚Äôs default decks. It‚Äôs an exciting feeling knowing that the earned cards have real world value and can be sold or traded for other cards. Gods Unchained also lets users earn tokens for when they win a match or refer their friend. The tokens themselves unlock rare in-game items and are also freely tradable.\n\nGods Unchained\n\nGods Unchained\nOne of the most popular games in crypto is Axie Infinity. You battle with a team of pet Axies and level them up. There's no aspect of the gameplay that feels like a blockchain game but there is the added benefit of being able to openly trade the Axies on NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea. The game has become popular in the Philippines and earning tokens from the game has become a viable source of income for players even beating minimum wage in many countries. There is also a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Yield Guild Games which leases Axies to players that want to get started with the game but don‚Äôt have the funds to purchase them. Several rare Axies were even purchased for $159,000 total.\n\nAxie Infinity battle\n\nAxie Infinity battle\nThere‚Äôs another popular game Dark Forest where you can explore different planets and collect Artifact NFTs on new planets, which give bonuses when attached to the planet. Being able to discover and collect these items or even win them in a battle and then trade them in decentralized marketplaces can make the game even more fun.\n\nPlanet in Dark Forest which has an Artifact NFT\n\nPlanet in Dark Forest which has an Artifact NFT\nOne concern with making in-game items tradable is that the ability to trade items can negatively affect the gameplay as people are focused on extracting value from the system or only the players that are willing to pay a lot of money for items can enjoy the game. Diablo III had an auction house where users could trade in-game items for in-game currency and cash. It was shut down because of how it affected the game. It was no longer fun and rewarding since players would just buy the best loot. In Diablo III, having the best loot was essentially the goal of the game so having an auction house severely affected gameplay whereas other games are not set up this way. It‚Äôs important for game developers to find a balance on what should be freely traded for their game (e.g. skins rather than weapons, game time itself can be traded, etc).\n\nSocial tokens\nThe emerging area of social tokens grew significantly in 2020. Social tokens are a broad category of tokens issued by individuals and communities. This term encompasses other similar terms like personal token, community token, and creator token. So far there hasn‚Äôt been a standardized term but I will use social tokens to refer to the broader category. Social tokens enable creators and communities to have more ownership in what they are building which is extremely exciting.\n\nSocial tokens map created by Forefront and Seedclub in Social Tokens Year in Review\n\nSocial tokens map created by Forefront and Seedclub in Social Tokens Year in Review\nEarly experiments of social tokens involved people tokenizing their time. For example Reuben Bramanathan, who previously worked on legal and product at Coinbase, tokenized his time where 1 $CSNL token equaled 1 hour of his time and was freely traded. We also saw people attempting to tokenize part of their future income. Platforms like Roll and Coinvise make it easier for people to issue their own token.\n\nOne prominent example of a social token is $RAC, a community token by the Grammy award winning recording artist RAC, issued through Zora. Token holders get access to a private Discord group and receive early access to merch drops with more perks to be added in the future. The token was retroactively distributed to his supporters including Bandcamp and Patreon supporters, people who had bought merch, and will eventually be distributed to all Twitch supporters. This allows creators to directly interact with and reward their early supporters.\n\nOne of the tools that enabled a new wave of social tokens was Collab.Land, which built a Telegram and Discord bot that connects to an Ethereum wallet to verify token balance before joining a chat group. This allowed for the creation of token permissioned groups, such as $JAMM and $KARMA with their native tokens, which helped make sure that those joining the group had a certain level of skin in the game. Another feature of Collab.Land is a leaderboard that keeps track of who has contributed the most to the chat group. You could imagine token rewards distributed to those with the highest amounts of participation to reward engagement.\n\nAnother useful social token tool is Unite Community which allows for creators to easily distribute their tokens to followers through their social media channels and reward engagement.\n\nUnite.community distribution\n\nUnite.community distribution\nThe interesting part about social tokens is that it can represent anything from a person‚Äôs time to specialized access to collective ownership of a community. There is a lot of potential for social tokens and I expect many more creators to issue them in the future.\n\nFuture\nThese are just a few of the many use cases that are possible and have gotten some traction. There will likely be a significant increase in NFT adoption over the next several years. Traditional assets like equity getting tokenized seems like a clear progression in the future as it would make transferring them far more efficient. Then we‚Äôll see tokenization that bridges the traditional world but adds new possibilities such as advertising space represented as an NFT where you could sell advertising rights to a site and have that be freely tradable. This would be a form of digital real estate. These NFTs would allow people to bet that a website will get a lot of traction and that the advertising space will become more valuable. Then we‚Äôll start seeing more tokens with brand new concepts that are only made possible because of crypto which is what I‚Äôm most excited about.\n\nTable from Will Warren‚Äôs presentation at 0xpo\n\nTable from Will Warren‚Äôs presentation at 0xpo\nThere are a few aspects of the user experience that need to be improved in order for NFTs to become more accessible. We need to have improvements to scaling since transaction fees can make some transactions very expensive or infeasible. Scaling research is already in the works with many different teams in Ethereum working on scaling solutions and we also are seeing other blockchains being built that are catered specifically for this use case. Another point of friction with NFTs is that holders will need to self-custody them. However this complexity can be abstracted away with user friendly wallets that make it easy to onboard and support features such as a PIN, biometrics, and social account recovery. I‚Äôm optimistic that these will get built out over time and we will see a huge wave of creativity and experimentation in the NFT space.\n\nResources\nHere are some additional resources to understand NFTs further and keep up with developments.\n\nUnderstanding NFTs\nQuick Overview of the NFT Ecosystem by Andrew Steinwold\nThe Non-Fungible Token Bible by Devin Finzer\nSocial Tokens Year in Review by Cooper Turley\nKeeping up with NFTs\nDeFi Arts Intelligencer newsletter by William Peaster\nZima Red newsletter by Andrew Steinwold\nForefront newsletter on social tokens\nIf you want to get in touch about interesting NFT ideas or projects, I‚Äôm @ljxie on Twitter.\n\nThanks to Will Warren and Jordan Clifford for reviewing this post.\n\nDisclaimer: Linda Xie is a Managing Director of Scalar Capital Management, LLC, an investment manager focused on cryptoassets which holds ETH and Ethereum tokens.

While the content and framing has evolved over the past 6 months, the core vision has remained the same: to craft a crypto-native artifact that captures the humanity of the people building the future of Ethereum.\n\nIt contains the hopes, fears, and anticipations of the Eth2 researchers and client implementers directly responsible for bringing the Beacon Chain to life on December 1, 2020. The future of the Beacon Chain is the future of Ethereum, and we‚Äôre proud to tell part of its story this far.\n\nWe prompted contributors with a few questions - you'll find them in order in each response, some but not all answered.\n\n- Name / handle\n- Affiliated orgs\n- Primary role\n- Eth2 rough start date\n- General summary of experiences\n- Code or documentation they are particularly proud of\n- Most memorable or painful-to-discover Eth2 bug\n- Person you've come to admire or want to give a shoutout to\n\nKeep in mind that these responses were gathered both before and after the Beacon Chain launch, so references to launch expectations will vary.

Eth2 wouldn‚Äôt be what it is without the input of hundreds of community testers and code contributors - thank you.\n\n---\n\n### Ethereum = Eth1 + Eth2\n\n- Ben Edgington\n- Originally [published on eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/wnie2_210328), 28th March, 2021\n\nLet's start with a quick history of what's become known as Eth2, and where it's headed in the future.\n\nRecently, Danny Ryan has announced his [intent to deprecate](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/) the use of the terms eth1 and eth2. As the creator and curator of ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New in Eth2,‚Äù this is a bit of a blow!\n\nBut, on the whole, I agree that these terms are beginning to outlive their usefulness, and are in danger of becoming quite misleading. It‚Äôs not really about fiddling with names; it‚Äôs about capturing fundamental changes in direction, and communicating them clearly. Changes in the roadmap are confusing for the community. Clarity in naming aids clarity of understanding.\n\nHere's a brief history of naming things in Ethereum‚Äôs roadmap.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the first use of the name ‚ÄúEthereum 2‚Äù was by Vitalik in Hacker News, way back in [April 2014](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7554923). He positioned Ethereum 2 as being a future step-change in the capability of Ethereum through the use of ‚Äúfundamental cryptographic upgrades.‚Äù\n\nEthereum 2 then drops out of view, and the main narrative becomes the familiar Frontier ‚Üí Homestead ‚Üí Metropolis ‚Üí Serenity progression, first described in [March 2015](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). In this scheme, Serenity is the network upgrade to Proof of Stake; Serenity isn‚Äôt Ethereum 2 per se. Interestingly, sharding/scaling doesn‚Äôt have a clear place in that roadmap, although it was certainly discussed [around that time](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/05/blockchain-scalability-chain-fibers-redux/).\n\nProgress largely followed this plan for some years, with Homestead going live in March 2016, and Metropolis (in name at least) in a pair of upgrades in October 2017 and February 2019.\n\nSerenity was to have been delivered via a process of upgrading the existing Ethereum chain to bootstrap Proof of Stake. That upgrade was specified in [EIP-1011](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1011.md) and there was even a [testnet](https://hackmd.io/@aTTDQ4GiRVyyce6trnsfpg/Hk6UiFU7z?type=view) that went live on December 31st, 2017.\n\nHowever, the road to Serenity was found to be a dead-end, not least because of the vast amount of Ether that stakers would require - 1500 was the number back then.\n\nSo, in mid 2018, we tore up that roadmap and started afresh with Ethereum 2.0. Rather, we reverted to Vitalik‚Äôs original idea from 2014 of an Ethereum 2 that was to be a significant cryptographic step-change to the protocol. Calling this Eth 2.0 made sense: we were planning to change pretty much everything about the platform. Ethereum 1 would eventually be brought in as a kind of legacy system. This Ethereum 2.0 roadmap came with neat consecutive phases: Phase 0 for Proof of Stake; Phase 1 for data shards; Phase 2 for executable shards; and, finally, bring Eth1 over to Eth2 after all that.\n\nWe‚Äôve now delivered Phase 0, but the rest of the plan has evolved. As per the latest Eth2 pages [on the ethereum.org website](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/), ‚ÄúEth2 [now] refers to a *set of interconnected upgrades* that will make Ethereum more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable‚Äù (emphasis mine). This looks much more like the old Serenity plan! We‚Äôre upgrading the Ethereum chain in-place rather than doing the old rip-and-replace.\n\nSo, you see, the roadmap narrative has vacillated over the years between effectively doing a replacement of Ethereum 1, referred to at various times as Eth2, and doing in-place upgrades to Eth1. Today, we‚Äôre more or less back in upgrade territory.\n\nIn view of all this, applying the Ethereum 2.0 moniker to the entire project is now seen as confusing: to some it implies a different chain to today‚Äôs Ethereum; to others, even [a different coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/md75k2/will_be_eth_20_a_new_coin_or_will_be_the_same_eth/). It suggests incompatibilities and problems ahead.\n\nThe [latest naming trend](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/11/finalized-no-23/), then, is to limit Eth2 to refer only to the consensus layer upgrade of Ethereum to Proof of Stake, and to refer to all of today‚Äôs Ethereum (fka Eth1) as the execution layer.\n\nIt's good to see everything moving under a consistent terminology and a shared roadmap. I'm looking forward to a productive rest of 2021 and beyond!\n\n[Continuations [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=26)\n\n### Aditya Asgaonkar\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2019 \n\nEth2 promises to deliver a decentralized, scalable, and secure blockchain platform on which stateful applications can live. These three qualities will be the driving force towards the mass adoption of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn the quest to satisfy the design requirements, we've also seen some amazing research and engineering progress. We have pushed the frontier of computer science in areas such as Byzantine consensus, signature aggregation, and VDFs. With the launch of Phase 0, we created the largest BFT consensus network in existence, which is an awesome feat in itself!\n\nMy favorite bit of work was the [\"Weak Subjectivity Guide\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/weak-subjectivity.md) - a document that outlines the weak subjectivity safety features of the Eth2.0 network. The goal is to prevent long range attacks that appear specifically in PoS consensus.\n\nAs for favorite bug, there was a consensus (fork-choice) issue discovered right before the Beacon Chain launch. The first priority was to assess the threat level of the attack -- it was critical and could have lead to a large-scale failure, but was extremely difficult to execute. Fixing this attack vector required a comprehensive review of the fork-choice component, and we had already identified a couple of solutions. At the end, there was agreement among the spec team that the attack didn't pose a critical threat because of its difficult execution, and we decided to publish a fix after further review was completed.\n\n### Adrian Manning\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Co-Lead Developer\n- Aug 2018 \n\nThe project has always been ambitious. The early designs were well thought out, but had shortcomings which became apparent when realising them through implementation. The collaboration between researchers and developers constantly iterated on these design specs for years, finally achieving a workable version of the original concept. The process was longer than expected, but it's been amazing to see the coordination and what has been achieved by a globally distributed group of implementers and researchers.\n\nOf all the work put into the Lighthouse client, I've changed and modified various architectures and designs and I'll likely continue to do so. I'm therefore not particularly fond of any individual piece relative to another. But I'm very proud of the end result. The resulting Lighthouse code-base that came together from everyone's hard work is what I'm most proud of.\n\nAs for person to give a shoutout to, I'm sure everyone has a similar answer, but for me it's Danny and Proto. Danny for the amazing organisational role and interfacing with all the client teams (especially on contentious topics) has sped up the development immensely. Proto (Diederick) for his relentless troubleshooting, bug-finding and research endeavours. He has been invaluable in interop testing, optimisation improvements and all round improving the general state of all clients and the eth2 ecosystem in general.\n\nAlso - there's an Australian saying, which I think applies to all eth2 researchers and developers: We're not here to f$!k spiders!\n\n### Adrian Sutton\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nEth2 is this big idea that started as a seed right back when Ethereum began and then went on this crazy, messy, long journey as the details were thrashed out through open research and public collaboration. All that messiness and the length of the journey is a result of this unique, highly collaborative and distributed approach to designing it. Multiple times, concepts that had been thought settled were thrown out because a better idea came along. While that has been frustrating for on-lookers, it has led to and continues to lead to huge improvements in the resulting technology.\n\nThe interop lock-in in Canada was a major turning point in the progress of Phase 0. It forced the Beacon Chain out of that research mode. Suddenly, client development was less about translating the Python spec to another language and more about engineering all the other components that make a client actually usable. Client teams finally had a stable platform to work from and make clients interoperable. There was an explosion of tools to aid developers in debugging and testing across clients. The Beacon Chain had stopped being a research project and started being an engineering one. The road to Mainnet started to become clear.\n\nNow with the deposit contract launched and deposits flowing into it, the pressure to deliver the rest of Eth2 really amps up. Community pressure to unlock those funds again will become overwhelming and despite all the warnings that it won't be quick, people will be disappointed at how long it takes. But those locked funds will also be the equivalent of the interop lock-in, forcing work out of the research phase and into production. All that time spent researching led people to wonder if Eth2 will ever ship, but with the beacon chain launch and all that money locked in, Eth2 has almost unstoppable momentum.\n\nThe future of Ethereum is very bright.\n\nI'm quite proud of my blog post explaining the weak subjectivity period: [\"Exploring Ethereum 2: Weak Subjectivity Period.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2019/11/27/exploring-ethereum-2-weak-subjectivity-period/) It was just me trying to get my head around a concept everyone seemed to be very hand-wavy about and put off solving to the future, yet it's become one of the standard reference points to explain the concept.\n\nI'm proud to have worked with Meredith Baxter and Cem Ozer. They have both been doing all the heavy lifting for Teku, almost entirely behind the scenes. They aren't flashy Twitter personalities, they just put their heads down and do the work.\n\nA few anecdotes to conclude: \n\n1. Family commitments mean I don't travel much, so when the first 7-client interop happened and a photo was posted of people crowded around the computer watching it, everyone in the photo was quickly identified but no one had any clue who I was. For a little while I was just \"that random guy in all the eth2 photos\".\n2. Before Ethereum, Ben Edgington only ever wore button-up, collared shirts. He's now exclusively dressed in Ethereum related T-shirts and has even picked up a penchant for Ethereum hoodies.\n\n[Caravans [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=27)\n\n### Afri Schoedon\n\n- Byzantine Fault / ESP Grantee¬† \n- Testnet Engineer\n- June 2018 \n\nI was working at Parity Technologies in 2018 which managed to implement EIP 1011, the \"Hybrid Casper FFG\" in the Parity Ethereum client. It was a hybrid proof-of-stake approach to the consensus engine and literally my first memory of seeing anything Eth2 related actually being implemented and run. There was Casper testnet up and running with Harmony, Pythereum, and Parity. It was exciting to see the idea of \"Serenity\" starting to materialize. \n\nHowever, it was the same year (only a few weeks later) that the Berlin Eth2 workshop decided to completely discard the hybrid Casper ideas in favor of the beacon chain. Admittedly, it was a massive undertaking. After all the ideation and the first implementations and testnets, we basically started from scratch. \n\nPrysmatic Labs first caught my attention when they launched their first public beacon chain testnets at the end of 2019. I was wondering why we had seven Eth2 clients but none of them was able to synchronize to the other clients' testnets. I was hooked and reached out to the Ethereum Foundation and the Goerli Initiative about contributing to multi-client testnets. And that's what I did in 2020, testnet after testnet up to the mainnet launch.\n\nWhen we launched the Goerli testnet in January 2019, it was not only an important milestone for Eth1 but it was also the perfect chance for Eth2 client teams to use this for their Eth1 integration leading up to the beacon chain genesis. Prysmatic Labs seized this moment and deployed all their Eth2 testnets to date to the Goerli testnet. Coindesk wrote a feature story with the headline [\"A New Test Network Just Activated and Ethereum 2.0 Will Be Using It.\"](https://www.coindesk.com/testnet-gorli-ethereum-serenity)\n\nAll my work on Eth2 concluded with the Eth2 mainnet launch in December 2020. The eight multi-client testnets are well documented on Github and received quite some [media attention](https://github.com/goerli/medalla).\n\nAs for bugs or missing features, that would be the lack of [BLS signature verifications](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/2081) in the deposit contract.\n\nShoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang!\n\n### Alex Stokes\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2018 \n\nWhat a ride it has been! The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020 represents the culmination of years of research and development across countless contributors from every corner of the globe, reaching as far back as the Ethereum genesis block.\n\nIt has been exhilarating to watch this effort go from a collection of wild ideas (e.g. informal talks on Casper from Devcon 3) to today‚Äôs production-scale mainnet. Having been involved before the ‚Äúcasper + sharding‚Äù merge and the formation of the eth2 umbrella, I have seen time and again how a dedicated group of individuals adapts and responds to changes both inside and outside the community. It is this resilience that I find most exciting, and that gives me confidence in a very bright future for Ethereum.\n\nWe are ready to weather whatever challenges may come our way and I cannot wait as we deploy a scalable Ethereum in 2021 and beyond.\n\nI'll highlight [some of the early Casper work](https://github.com/ethereum/casper/pull/143) that got me involved directly with eth2 in mid-2018. Part of the original proof-of-stake design involved a validator registry contract hosted on the eth1 chain. As part of the deposit process, validators provided an arbitrary smart contract for signature verification. While an interesting application of account abstraction, this smart contract needed to be deterministic so that signatures could be independently verified on-chain. In order to ensure the smart contract had the desired properties, it was processed by another smart contract, the \"purity checker\" (in the sense of a pure computation), during the initial registration.\n\nAn early version of the purity checker was written in a now deprecated smart contract language called Serpent LLL. I created a Gitcoin bounty to port the Serpent LLL to a language stack used in the ethereum/casper project, Vyper LLL.\n\nMost painful bug would definitely have to be debugging cross-client interactions during the eth2 interop event in 2019. Fun times, good people and challenging bugs!\n\nShoutout to protolambda!\n\n### Alex Vlasov\n\n- TX/RX¬† \n- Applied Researcher\n- July 2019 \n\nMy predominant impression is that Eth2 poses problems, which are perhaps the most challenging from a software engineering point of view, at the moment. This is exciting from a researcher's perspective, but sometimes frustrating from a software engineer's one. We must adapt, in order to survive in the endeavor.\n\nOne aspect is that we, as software engineers, are used to optimizing for the common case, largely overlooking rare ones. But the latter ones are exactly what an attacker will thoroughly scrutinize! The habit is difficult to break, especially considering that it demands huge amounts of time to analyze and optimize the worst case behavior.\n\nI'm confident that we have to use Formal Methods, as testing is not able to explore the search space exhaustively (except for rare cases, when the space is relatively small).\n\nAnother important aspect is that modern DeFi is demanding on resources. And that is not only data throughput, but EVM/CPU throughput too. ZKP/zkRollups is an obvious example. However, asset pricing can be computation hungry too. And, as we can see now, DeFi asset pricing is an important topic. Unfortunately, EWASM turned to be a much harder idea to implement than initially expected. And it's basically for the same reason - WASM JIT compilers are optimized for a common case, while worst case scenarios can be exploited by an attacker. So, I treat it as another manifestation of the problem discussed above.\n\nWhile the problems are difficult, I am very excited to investigate and implement potential solutions.\n\nOne idea that I'm working on is a (semi-)automated transpilation of Eth2 beacon chain Python specs to Kotlin. The [resulting Kotlin code](https://github.com/ericsson49/research/blob/master/beacon_kotlin_generated/src/phase1/spec.kt) is beautiful, IMHO. Kotlin turned to be a pretty good match for (a statically-typed subset of) Python.\t\n\nAs for a specific bug, it's not yet made public (as it can turn to be a serious vulnerability). But the basic idea is that swapping two lines leaves a function 100% functionally correct, while an attacker can send the code into a practically endless loop.\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan!\n\n[Discovery [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=28)\n\n### Ben Edgington\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Chronicler of Eth2 and Teku PM\n- January 2018 \n\nI could write a book on this, and perhaps one day I will. But the tl;dr is that getting to where we are has been the most incredible journey of my career.\n\nThe technology is thrilling, and the distributed development model no less so. But the highlight above all is getting to work every day with such a brilliant, thoughtful, capable, and generous group of people. If it's true that technology reflects the people who build it, then Eth2 is going to be a superb foundation for all the systems of the world.\n\nAs for the future, the beacon chain was designed, developed and delivered astonishingly quickly, having been conceived only in June 2018. Things get harder from now on: the beacon chain already carries so much value, and we need to begin taking into account the existing value on the Eth1 chain as we work on a merge. I think our main challenges ahead may not be technical, but more governance related. But I am confident that, with the ethos we've established and momentum we have as a community, we can bring this thing to a successful conclusion.\t\n\nI've enjoyed writing up regular digests of the latest developments in the spec since October 2018 at [eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/), really with an audience of just the other Eth2 devs in mind. Over time it's grown and evolved, and now gets between three thousand and ten thousand views per edition. This amazes me.\n\nI am still happy with my one and only ethresear.ch post, co-written with Nicolas Liochon: [\"Exploring the Proposer Collator split.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/exploring-the-proposer-collator-split/1632) While more of a design bug than a code bug, some credited it with finally finishing off the old sharding design, and precipitating the move to the beacon chain. I think things may have already been heading in that direction at the time.\n\nAs for individual shoutouts, what an incredible group of people - you are all amazing!\n\n### Carl Beekhuizen\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nAlthough eth2 has taken longer to get off the ground than I think any of us imagined, the result is extremely robust, secure, and decentralised.\n\nIt is incredibly exciting to see how eth2 is evolving and maturing into the backbone of the decentralised future we all dream about.\n\nI'm most proud of the key-derivation EIPs (2333, 2334, 2335). Specifically, the quantum-secure backup keys built into EIP 2333. In the event of a quantum apocalypse, validators should be able to recover using these Lamport signatures.\n\nI'm also really proud of the Launchpad. ü¶è So many validators managed to deposit safely.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Hsiao-Wei Wang for the attention to detail and diligence she brings to everything she works on.\n\n### Cayman Nava\n\n- Chainsafe Systems¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- December 2018 \n\nThe past two years have been a blast. Looking back on the progress we've collectively made and the state of the ecosystem, I feel like we're on the cusp of something great. And I'm honored to be a part of it. I anticipate that Ethereum will be of critical importance for the future, as a rock-solid foundation that empowers ultimately successful experiments which aim to resolve many of the hardest problems facing society today.\n\nI'm proud of the [typescript implementation](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ssz) of SSZ (a copy of Proto's remerkleable). It fulfills the spec, but in an ergonomic way. You can operate on an ssz merkle tree as if it is a 'normal' javascript object. This required some exotic code, but the result is seamless [ssz <-> javascript interoperability](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/lodestar-medalla-update-59865a5cce1a).\n\nHuge thanks to Proto and his work! Many of the tools / algorithms / methods he's published are present in Lodestar: remerkleable, eth2-fastspec, protoarray fork choice, etc. the list goes on.\n\n### Celeste Seberras\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Technical Content Strategist\n- May 2018 \n\nIt has been a humbling experience to have witnessed the growth of Prysmatic from a small seedling with a dream to the robust and diverse community it harbours today; equally so for the broader Eth2 ecosystem. Hard work over the past two years has proven that, through all the speculative noise and interindustry drama, the things that truly speak are code and passion.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Prysm client usage manual.\n\nShout out to all the boys here at Prysmatic Labs. You are all fantastic to work with, here's to the future!\n\nShoot for the stars. Even if you miss, holy fuck you're in space!\n\n### Cem Ozer\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2019 \n\nI‚Äôm blown away that the Eth2.0 beacon chain is now alive and well. For me it was such a complex undertaking, and deep down I was scared it would never launch or be successful.\t\n\nWhen I first joined Teku (called Artemis back then) we were almost only working on the state transition. The spec changed pretty rapidly at the time, and as a result we had to update our state transition many times. I found myself leading these changes at Artemis, and it would almost always be a week long intense marathon where we‚Äôd change thousands of lines of code as a team, and I‚Äôd try to make sure we did not break anything.\n\nLuckily this was in the prototyping phase, this is not how it‚Äôs done today in the production phase :). I‚Äôm also pretty proud of having worked on the Eth1 Deposit Management of Teku.\n\nMy best bug discovery is luckily documented by my team lead Adrian Sutton on his blog: [\"The Curious Case of the Invisible Fork.\"](https://www.symphonious.net/2020/07/06/exploring-ethereum-2-the-curious-case-of-the-invisible-fork/)\n\nShoutout to Johnny Rhea, Adrian Sutton, and Protolambda. These three people are all geniuses in their own unique ways. It was an honor and an incredible experience working with them.\n\n[Build - Maintain [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=29)\n\n### Chih Cheng Liang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2017 \n\nI'm glad to be part of Eth2 development. There are too many people; I can't express my gratitude enough. There are lots of beautiful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nI'm excited to see what Ethereum will be with fully-fledged PoS as well as sharding.\n\nI'm most proud of introducing the Milagro BLS binding to Trinity. BLS signatures are like the steroids of Eth2. Back then, only one Python library, py_ecc, met the requirements of the Beacon Chain spec. py_ecc is great for research or education purposes, but for things like client implementations, the performance of the library is not on par. The na√Øve alternative is to find a Python binding of a fast language. Chia's Python binding to C++ code was the low hanging fruit to pursue.\n\nAs the Beacon Chain BLS requirements became more specific, and we had to interop with other clients in a short timeframe, we decided to try using Python to wrap \"milagro_bls\" - Sigma Prime's Rust library. The result is the \"milagro_bls_binding\" library. I'm proud of it because that's my first Rust-ish project, and it was used in a real use case.\n\nAs for most challenging bug, in early 2018 I worked on the [Casper prototype testnet](https://github.com/ethereum/trinity/pull/954) that Karl and Vitalik built on pyethapp. Pyethapp had many issues, but the most difficult one to debug was the peer connection issue. I got a lot of help from Dmitry from the Harmony team, he discovered many peer connection issues with the Java client's logs. One of them was pyethapp's catastrophic peer-to-peer bug.\n\nSpecial thanks to Jannik Luhn - he contributed lots of quality work in peer to peer research/simulation and Trinity.\n\n### Dankrad Feist\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- June 2018 \n\nBy historical accident, one of my first ever involvements with Ethereum was the research workshop in Berlin 2018 where the Beacon chain design (and merging of Casper and Sharding) was first decided. I had only come to the workshop because I was in Berlin at the time for my startup and my former colleague and friend, Justin Drake, had invited me to check it out. The concepts that were talked about at this workshop immediately appealed to the nerd inside me -- deep maths and computer science problems, nevertheless approachable and worth exploring to find elegant solutions. \n\nOver the next few months, I tried my luck on some of the problems that were discussed, especially the randomness problem. However, it would only be March 2019 that I left my startup and went to work on Ethereum 2.0 full time, so I would say that the concept of the beacon chain was by then fairly mature and what was left to be done was more tinkering around the edges.\n\nI think it is always worth reminding ourselves that the beacon chain itself, while only one part of Eth2.0, is a very ambitious project. As far as I am aware, Proof of Stake has never been tried on this scale: neither economically nor in the networking sense. What I mean by this is the sheer amount of funds that can be staked on the beacon chain, which due to the Ether market cap can easily approach billions of dollars in value. This is one advantage smaller projects certainly do have over Ethereum -- they can increase stake gradually, whereas Eth2.0 will very quickly go all the way.\n\nNot only that, but most other projects have refrained from actually imposing penalties on validators -- which compromises the security of PoS networks, but obviously makes designing it much easier, because literally nothing is at stake except for some very minor rewards.\n\nFinally, and this is the most important distinction, Eth2.0 is designed so that it can literally accommodate a million validators. That's pretty impressive considering that most other projects only support around 100! Not only that, but this feat is achievable using fairly modest node requirements, in fact it seems perfectly plausible to run a validator on a mobile phone or a Raspberry Pi.\n\nWhen we do launch the beacon chain, which is now truly imminent (barring extreme surprises), we should keep in mind just how ambitious this project is even on its own. \n\nThe beacon chain was essentially frozen 3 months after I joined the team full time, so I would not claim that I have made any major contributions to it. My most important contribution to Eth2.0 that is slated for inclusion so far is re-architecting the Proof of Custody construction so that it is fully suitable for SSVs (Secret Shared Validators). While we weren't too sure of the experimental cryptographic Legendre pseudo-random function (PRF) when we first came across it in March 2019, it has successively improved to a truly impressive construction on all fronts that I am now very proud of:\n\n1. Extended cryptoanalysis has improved our confidence in the Legendre PRF a lot in response to several bounties that we have set out.\n2. The combination of the Legendre PRF with the Universal Hash Function primitive, suggested by Dmitry Khovratovich, means that only a single evaluation of the PRF is needed per proof of custody, and the rest of the computation is extremely efficient and even faster than regular (sha256) hashing.\n3. Thanks to the probabilistic 0.01 bit proof of custody idea, only a small amount of information is leaked from the proof of custody, such that it would be impossible to gain access to custody secrets even if the Legendre PRF were broken outright.\n\nFinally, I have huge respect for Danny Ryan. He is phenomenal at keeping everything together and making it work.\n\n### Danny Ryan\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- 2017 \n\nSurprise! Everything is a bit harder than originally expected (at least from my perspective) - I suppose most of the things worth doing in life are. Today, I am very excited about the project and the progress. Eth2 has an incredibly strong technical background and is ready for the next wave of upgrades. Huge shout-out to the hard work from client teams, as well as to the validator community keeping this thing running.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the [beacon chain spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md).\n\nFinally, I don't want to imagine how this would have gone without protolambda's insight and technical contributions over the past couple of years.\n\n### Dmitriy Ryajov\n\n- Status¬† \n- libp2p developer\n- August 2019 \n\nSuper grueling, but rewarding in terms of overall impact on the different ecosystems, Eth2 itself, the Nim language and libp2p.\n\nI'm most proud of my work on the Nim libp2p implementation.\n\n### Hsiao-Wei Wang\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Summer 2017 \n\nMy journey started with implementing Serenity‚Ñ¢. It was an ambitious and abstract concept. We've struggled with the design trade-offs for a long time, but with more and more contributors who devoted their efforts, and years of hard work, we were finally able to divide and conquer Eth2.\n\nIt was a fantastic journey to launch Phase 0 finally. I'm so grateful for the broad community support. And, of course, the Ethereum heroes who dove into Ethereum R&D.\n\nI'm very excited about the next Eth2 milestones and the creative ideas that the community will build on Eth2.\n\nI want to mention my admiration for Virgil Griffith, a pioneer that paved the way for Ethereum research work.\n\n[Seen and Seeing [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=30)\n\n### Ivan Martinez\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Engineer\n- August 2018 \n\nWorking on Eth2 has been an amazing adventure. It went from contributing in my free time to becoming my longest running full-time job. While there have been a few blocks on the way (unstable spec, implementation problems, testnet drama), it's been an absolute blast and this is just the start! Very excited to release, and move forward with future phases!\n\nI am particularly proud of building our [end-to-end testing suite](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/3932), which has proved incredibly useful for detecting issues before changes reach the canary. I've also helped build a lot of the [slasher](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5043) and optimized it for mainnet usage.\n\nOne of the most memorable bugs I encountered would have to be: [\"Change StreamIndexedAttestations to use target root for state regen #5971.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/5971)\n\nShoutout to Terence Tsao! His ability to understand the spec has constantly amazed me (he's the largest contributor to the spec outside of the EF!).\n\nAlso.. Danny Ryan is awesome :)\n\n### Jacek Sieka\n\n- Status¬† \n- Research Lead\n- March 2018 \n\nI was fortunate to join Eth2 at the very start - having worked on many open source projects before, for fun, peer-to-peer networks like DC++, compilers like nlvm, as well as high-frequency trading. It all came together at that point like a perfect fit - a giant stroke of good luck. Here we are, years later, with the baby well on its way to being delivered.\n\nThe work I'm most proud of is managing to restore sanity and switching [Eth2 to Little Endian](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/139). It survived several high-profile attempts to swing it back to Big. I guess a more memorable, and certainly more involved feature, was the deep collaboration on the networking protocol that culminated with [what we have today](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1328) - this was quite the achievement made possible by some round-the-world collaboration with Adrian (of Sigma Prime), Ra√∫l (of libp2p) and lots of others! Less known is that me and Adrian resorted to flipping an Ethereum block hash coin to see who would get to post the PR :)\n\nI'm most proud of when Paul Hauner and I managed to run a fully independent, self-sufficient [multi-client Eth2 network](https://twitter.com/jcksie/status/1171886857908609024) for the first time, at the Canada retreat!\n\n### Jonny Rhea\n\n- Teku, TX/RX¬† \n- Client lead & TX/RX co-founder\n- November 2018 \n\n\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.\"\n\nParticularly proud of my Ethresearch post, [\"Packetology: Validator \nPrivacy.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/packetology-validator-privacy/7547) \n\nMost memorable bug: [\"DoS Attack on Prysm Stops Finality.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/public-attacknets/issues/12)\n\nShoutout to the Russians!

The equivalents of Project Gemini and Project Apollo are needed next. Rollups and Layer 2 will help improve scalability, but I believe there is much innovation that can and should continue to be done in Layer 1. There is a place for some execution, and cross-shard transactions in Layer 1. I also think that we should be careful about assumptions that we might make, like assuming that cross-shard transactions must be asynchronous. The challenges in the Ethresearch thread [‚ÄúCross-shard DeFi composability‚Äù](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-defi-composability/6268/9) need tackling with minimal assumptions.\n\nI dream of a system that is more scalable, performant, but preserves the default atomicity and synchronicity of Ethereum. I dream of shards that are transparent and automatically load-balancing. It may sound impossible, but can be used to inspire the engineers of the world to build the ambitious system that we can envision.\n\nDevelopments like Apollo and the Internet are an encouraging reminder to what humanity can accomplish: where there's a will, there's a way.\n\nWhy is this important? Why is a platform for decentralized systems important? John Perry Barlow may have answered it with his [‚ÄúDeclaration of the Independence of Cyberspace.‚Äù](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)\n\nPersonally, I'm delighted that [\"The Beacon Chain Ethereum 2.0 explainer you need to read first\"](https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain/) is usually on the first page of Google for \"beacon chain.\" I'm most proud of forming and recruiting a talented R&D group at ConsenSys that has made numerous Ethereum contributions. For Eth2, these include a review of the deposit contract and influencing an important Solidity implementation. More well known is the Quilt team, which started from R&D of Eth2 Phase 2 (execution, threads [quilting], rather than Plasma). Finally, years ago I helped connect Karl Floersch to the Casper \"team\" at EDCON Paris.\n\nShoutout to all of Ethereum Layer 0 -- its people -- without which there would be no Layer 1 or beyond. Layer 0 always welcomes you, and all contributions great and small :)\n\n### Justin Drake\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Late 2017 \n\nLooking back, the beacon chain took longer than expected to ship and there is significant work remaining in the coming years. Having said that, I am incredibly optimistic and excited about the future of Ethereum‚ÄîI could not be more bullish :)\n\nI'm pretty proud of the fact that the beacon chain spec is executable - it's pretty remarkable IMO. How many complex internet protocols have a full executable spec, not to mention four production-grade implementations on day 1?\t\n\nOne of the \"design bugs\" I was involved with early on was having PoS and sharding be separate cryptoeconomic systems as opposed to one unified design. Another big design flaw was using plain (as opposed to aggregatable) signatures. Looking back, in ~2 years we took a visionary but very rough design and made it orders of magnitude better.\n\nFolks dedicated to Eth2 are a rare breed (less than 100 of us) and I have tremendous respect for the team as a whole, as well as many individuals. I will note that, with where things are headed, we may soon have trillions of dollars running on Eth2 and we will need more manpower. So I want to give a shoutout to you‚Äîthe reader‚Äîto consider joining the Ethereum mission :) Hit me up by email, on Twitter, or on Telegram!\n\n[Traditions [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=31)\n\n### Karl Floersch\n\n- prev. Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- Winter 2017 \n\nIt has been a wild journey to scale Ethereum & we are ridiculously close to realizing the vision after all this time. It's pretty insane. I'm most proud of the early work I did on [Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/casper) and initial implementation of [Hybrid Casper](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/tree/b704a5c6577863edc539a1ec3d2620a443b950fb/ethereum/hybrid_casper). As for bugs, the pyethereum p2p layer was absolutely terrible and really crippled the testnet :'''(\n\nShoutout to Vitalik, Hsiao-Wei Wang, & Justin Drake!\n\n### Kirk Baird\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt's been a very busy two years; as only my second job working in IT, the learning curve has been massive. First and most importantly, my understanding of the core technologies around blockchains has matured from seeing them as a secure linked list to the complex beast they are. With the focus of my work being on integrating BLS into Lighthouse, a significant knowledge of pairing based cryptography was needed. The BLS signature scheme is far more complicated than the existing ECDSA used in Eth1. Luckily, there are a lot of good resources out there which explain how to progress from classical elliptic curve cryptography to pairing based cryptography.\n\nI was lucky enough to go to DevCon Osaka in 2019 which was an amazing experience! There were so many keen minds all meeting to relish and enjoy the progress Ethereum has made, but also to provide insights and ideas on how it will be improved and developed over the coming years. Japan itself is also an amazing place with so much to see, until we almost got stuck in a typhoon.\n\nI am most proud of the work done on [Milagro BLS](https://github.com/sigp/milagro_bls). This library was rough around the edges when I first inherited it, being a long way from the standardised signature scheme we have now.\n\nFinally, wanted to give a shoutout to Danny Ryan! The man is a weapon.\n\n### Mamy Andr√©-Ratsimbazafy\n\n- Status¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2018 \n\nI remember reading the \"70% ready\" spec in july 2018, that was the wild wild west. Things were on a HackMD document, changes were made every 6 hours and very hard to track - as mentioned in the EthCC 2 talk [\"Tests and Simulations of Eth2.0.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c4mQg5L6Rs&t=597s)\n\nOne of the most significant milestones was when, out of nowhere, all 7 clients at the time were able to create a testnet back in September 2019 in Muskoka. Anticipation, apprehension, will the launch work? If yes, that is definitely a huge milestone!\n\nI'm proud of my work on the [\"Auditors Handbook to Nimbus Beacon Chain.\"](https://nimbus.guide/auditors-book/01_introduction.html) Nimbus uses a dark horse language called Nim. It happens to be easily picked up, and our 3 audit teams were pleasantly surprised by its features, including those related to correctness.\n\nThe most infamous bugs we had were related to fork choice / Proof-of-Stake. The most infamous one would be this one-liner hotfix, where some votes were skipped in period of non-finality: [\"hotfix fork choice score application #2041.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/2041/files)\n\nBig respect to Protolambda! He came like the Hagibis storm.\n\n### Matt Garnett \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Researcher\n- January 2019 \n\nMy perspective on eth2 is probably very different from many people who were focused on Phase 0. Although I compartmentalized Phase 0 and Phase 1 to a large degree to allow myself to consider the possibilities of Phase 2, I never considered the possibility that eth2 wouldn't ship. To me, it was not a matter of \"if\" but \"when.\"\n\nI'm proud of the work I did writing the first Execution Environment for eth2, called [\"sheth.\"](https://github.com/quilt/sheth) It was completely stateless and allowed Ether transfers within a shard. \n\nShoutout to Proto, he has been instrumental in making eth2 happen, I don't know how he manages to be so prolific.\n\nA quick story to wrap up. On the first day of the Canada interop, the Quilt team drove up from Toronto in a 15-person passenger van. It had rained a bit so the area was sort of wet. The venue was tucked away off on a gravel road, right beside the lake. We pulled the van up next to the parked cars and headed in to visit with the eth2 teams. \n\nAfter catching up with everyone, we returned to the van to drive over to the airbnb we were sharing with the ewasm team. Will Villanueva had driven us there, so he hopped in the driver's seat and began orienting the van forwards to head out. The area we had parked in was sort of a T-intersection and there were small drop-offs (0.5m maybe) into a heavily wooded ditch anywhere there wasn't road. Will backed into one of the legs of the T and started to drive forward to leave. Unfortunately, the exit path was a rather steep gravel hill. The 2WD van didn't have the traction climb out and now we were positioned at an awkward angle in the T. The van was perilously close to tipping over into the ditch. Will backed up to a flatter part to regroup. I offered to give it a shot and he obliged. \n\nAt this point, we had drawn a bit of a crowd. I recall having people at each corner of the van, keeping an eye out to help avoid falling off into the ditch. I gave it a few attempts, but realized how difficult of a situation we were in. At this point, it was unclear if we could even return to our starting place, as the front left and back right of the van were less than a foot away from falling into the ditch - a ditch that would no doubt require a tow truck to collect the van from. There was no other option than making it up the hill. Fortunately, there was a bit of flatter ground between the van and the beginning of the hill. Although it would be a tight fit, likely inches on either side into the wooded ditch, I thought that with speed we should be able to build enough momentum to get past the steep portion of the hill. I shared my plan with the spectators. Unsurprisingly, the uninvested patrons were eager to fill me with confidence so they could enjoy the spectacle. I backed up the van as far as the gravel road would allow and then slammed the gas down. The van lurched forward, albeit lethargically, towards the top of the hill. The eth2 gods were almost certainly looking down on us in that moment and guided that van safely to the hill's peak. \n\nAt the top of the hill, I collected my emotions and then stepped out to enjoy the laughing and cheering. We inspected the ridiculous situation we had been in, and examined the ruts that the tires had made spinning out on the fail attempts. After the excitement died down and the spectators returned to the venue to continue working on their clients, we headed back up the hill to our van and drove home. \n\nFor the rest of the time there, we parked the van at the top of the hill and walked down to the venue.\n\n### Mehdi Zerouali\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Security Engineer, Cofounder\n- October 2018 \n\nI find it hard to believe that we're finally launching the beacon chain! So much hard work from so many different entities has gone into this over the past couple of years. I'm extremely proud of what Sigma Prime has accomplished so far and look forward to the Lighthouse crew making Phase 1, Phase 1.5 and Phase 2 a reality.\n\nThe structural differential fuzzer I've helped build as part of Beacon Fuzz is definitely something I'm proud of. Over the last few months, Beacon Fuzz helped uncover more than 40+ bugs on all major client implementations, including critical consensus related vulnerabilities.\n\nIt's hard to pick one person to recognize, but Diederik Loerakker (aka protolambda) has done such an amazing job helping the client teams navigate the optimisations required to implement the eth2 spec in production. Of course, the coordination job done by Danny Ryan is second to none. I doubt we'd be where we are today without these two exceptional individuals.\n\nFun fact: Lighthouse releases are named after Rick & Morty characters!\n\n### Meredith Baxter\n\n- Teku¬† \n- Client Implementer, Software Engineer\n- November 2019 \n\nI was fortunate to join the Teku team at an exciting time (about a year ahead of the beacon chain launch) in November of 2019. We had a lot of work ahead of us and we weren't sure whether or not we would meet launch deadline with a fully functional, production-ready client. The learning curve to understanding eth2 is also pretty steep, which only increased the pressure. Luckily, the EF and other eth2 client teams have been an incredible resource for us throughout the development process. The engineers involved across the client teams have been very open and supportive. And the EF researchers have been amazingly welcoming, approachable, and responsive. They've always been there for us to answer questions and provide insights. It has been hugely gratifying to be a part of the successful launch of the beacon chain with the help of this incredible group of people. I'm very excited to continue the work as we look forward to upcoming changes including our first hard fork, sharding, and the merge.\t\n\nOne exciting milestone was getting [Teku syncing to a live](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/1143) testnet (Prysm's Sapphire testnet).\n\nI'm also really proud of our [checkpoint sync feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz3flfj50Ig) which allows new nodes to sync up and become fully operational within minutes. See the issue as well: \"[Implement sync from a recent state #3063](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/issues/3063).\"\n\nThe instability on the Medalla testnet in the fall of 2020 was a trying moment across the client teams, but we came out stronger on the other side. We were all working overtime to improve performance and patch issues revealed by the long period of non-finalization. One big fix I managed to push during this time involved putting a hard limit on amount of work required to regenerate states that dropped out of our in-memory cache: [\"[Issue 2608] Add ability to periodically persist hot states #2611.\"](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/2611) More context on the network instability can be found here: [\"Eth2 Implementers‚Äô Call #46 - 2020-08-20.\"](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/S1b2sJhzv)\n\n### Michael Sproul\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nAfter a brief foray into the blockchain world in 2017, I developed a taste for it and knew I had to come back. When I saw a job ad from SigP on Twitter for a proof-of-stake client in Rust, I dropped what I was doing and got involved ASAP. At the beginning I got deep into Lighthouse's consensus code which was then very much in flux due to lots of spec changes, and had been written in a gargantuan solo effort by Paul! From that foothold in consensus I then branched out into the database, op pool and slashing -- all of which captured my interest in a way no other project had. \n\nWhen we ran the first testnets in September 2019 off code I'd contributed to, I was kind of shocked the thing worked at all, and awed by all the hard work done by everyone else involved. This community of researchers, programmers and enthusiasts has been nothing but amazing, and I'm optimistic for a successful Phase 0 launch and the realisation of the Eth2 dream in Phase 1 and beyond. Personally, I can't wait until we can run some transactions, and look forward to getting into the minutiae of WebAssembly execution environments.\t\n\nI'm very proud of Lighthouse's slasher. I was able to draw inspiration from great foundational research laid by Proto, and dedicate myself to building a fast, concise implementation. Testing the implementation on Medalla and watching the carnage inflicted on other validators brought a perverse form of satisfaction ;)\n\nOne of my favorite bugs: [\"DB inconsistent after restart #1488.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/1488)\n\nShoutout to Cem √ñzer!\n\nI know of at least one core dev who force pushed a commit to master in the EthDenver bathrooms...\n\n### Mikhail Kalinin\n\n- PegaSys, TX/RX¬† \n- Applied Researcher\n- April 2018 \n\nIt's been exciting to see how Hybrid Casper FFG and the Sharding proposal have been merged into what is now called the Beacon Chain. And how this research is evolving, growing, attracting a lot of new people. And finally the result is about to be shipped pretty soon. This was a big part of my life for two and a half years. I anticipate rapid movement towards Shards and the Merge when Phase 0 is shipped. Though there are many things yet to deal with.\n\nI am proud of the [Eth1 Shard Demo](https://github.com/txrx-research/eth1-shard-demo) that we made together with Guillaume from EF with decent support from EF researchers.\n\nI can give recognition to a bunch of people tbh. But, narrowing down, Danny Ryan and Ben Edgington.\n\n### Nathaniel Jensen\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Security Engineer\n- September 2019 \n\nI'd heard a bit about Ethereum before but had not developed a solid understanding.\n\nAlthough relatively new, I'm glad to play a small part in such a technically impressive undertaking. I am continually appreciative that I can work in such an interesting space, with such friendly and impressive colleagues and community, and contribute to something that has the potential to be profoundly important. I'm excited to see Phase 0 mainnet kick off, the culmination of so much effort!\n\nI look forward seeing the space continue to develop with the incorporation of the EVM chain and Layer 2 solutions, and all the interesting use-cases that I can't begin to imagine.\n\nMy primary contribution to the Eth2 ecosystem had been taking on maintenance and development of a differential fuzzer that compares state transitions across the Eth2 clients: beacon-fuzz. In September 2019, Sigma Prime was engaged by the Ethereum Foundation to continue development of Guido Vranken's previous differential fuzzing solution - comparing ZRNT and Pyspec, the Go and Python Eth2.0 executable specifications.\n\nI was primarily responsible for building out [the fuzzing framework](https://github.com/sigp/beacon-fuzz) to include comparison of other client implementations: Lighthouse, Prysm, Nimbus, Teku, Trinity, as well as adding fuzzing targets for additional state transition functions.\n\nAs for most painful bug, see the [\"Beacon Fuzz update 001\"](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/beacon-fuzz-01.html) on the Sigma Prime blog, section \"Golang Library Linking Errors.\" How to try to get multiple Go implementations running without having their dependencies clash, and dealing with arcane linking issues using existing tooling to build a Go fuzzing library that exercises cgo/C code (as Prysm depends on a C/assembly BLS library).\n\nI want to give a shoutout to Protolambda (Diederik Loerakker). He reliably gets to the bottom of really obtuse fuzzing results. He's our consistent fallback for deciphering complicated results across multiple Eth2 client implementations. From our interactions, he clearly comes across as a friendly, genuine, and technically outstanding individual.\n\n### Nishant Das\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- June 2018 \n\nIt was a very difficult endeavour to get Eth2 running smoothly. Ultimately, with teams well distributed across the globe, constant communication is always a challenge. However, despite all that, I am really proud of the fact that we have launched Phase 0 with 4 different clients running. I'm very optimistic for the future and am looking forward to the merge. There have been too many bugs to count, and I keep on finding new ones every week.\n\nShoutout to Proto - cross client compatibility would be nowhere near what it is without him constantly monitoring and working on it.\n\n### Paul Hauner\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has fostered an inclusive, open, and merit-based approach to technical collaboration. Under this environment we've seen many researchers, engineers and communicators flourish. This is a testament to what people can do when they share a common goal and are empowered to work on the things that interest them.\n\nAs Eth2 has progressed, Sigma Prime has grown steadily to include a team of talented engineers and computer scientists. I am grateful to work with these people and I learn from them every day.\n\nI hope to see Ethereum evolve into a tool that provides honest utility to everyday people, without jeopardising the sovereignty of their data or selves.\n\nRegarding work I'm proud of, I quite like the [minimal-allocation Merkle-tree hasher](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/consensus/tree_hash/src/merkle_hasher.rs) I built in 2018. It's simpler and more powerful than other algorithms I have seen.\n\nOne notable bug: [\"Manipulating deposit contract to gain an early majority #1446.\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1446)\n\n### Pawan Dhananjay\n\n- Sigma Prime¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- July 2019 \n\nI remember reading Vitalik's proof of stake blog posts in early 2018 and thinking that it sounds all good in theory, but no way we'll have a proof of stake protocol for more than a small number of participants which would work well in practice. Needless to say, it's been extremely impressive to see how far the effort has come in just a few years. Kudos to everyone involved, I'm glad to have been a part of the effort for the past year.\n\nAlso, a huge shoutout to the SigP crew! It has been an absolute blast working with these guys, learning from them and also indulging in their jolly Aussie humor :) Excited for the Phase 0 launch and geared up to begin work on Phase 1!\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be: [\"Update state before producing attestation #1596.\"](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/1596)\n\nBig thanks to protolambda for sure. All his debugging tools have saved me (and many others I'm sure) hours of effort.\n\n### Preston Van Loon\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nThe last few years have been an adventure, to say the least. At first, I had just a mild interest in Ethereum. I didn't own any cryptocurrencies or really understand how they worked. After a few months of reading, I started to realize two things: 1) Ethereum was this incredible technology that has an unlimited potential to change the world for the better, and 2) Ethereum is incredibly slow and desperately needed to scale. \n\nImmediately, I looked for ways to help contribute to the scaling effort and then I met Raul Jordan. We met together in NYC for coffee and talked about starting a project to work on sharding for Ethereum. We formed Prysmatic Labs. Since starting the company in January of 2018, I've met some of the most interesting people in the world - many have become close friends. Working in Ethereum continues to fulfill my desire to make a positive impact, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the completed roll out of Eth2.\n\nMost memorable bug would have to be that time that all of Prysm nodes thought they were 4 hours in the future and thousands of validators were slashed in a testnet: [\"Roughtime reports clock offset by 4hrs #6825.\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/6825)\n\n### Protolambda\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- November 2018 \n\nThe main theme is that we - researchers and client devs - did not make our lives easy. Spec updates have continued to improve the protocol itself, but caused instability in the process of updating implementations. A new network stack was adopted, and many difficult research and implementation problems had to be solved. In the future, I do not think this will change, as Phase 1 and later are complicated too. But the approach can be improved. Exploratory single-client implementation ahead of others could avoid duplicating work for other clients, and enable faster spec updates.\n\nMost memorable bug: [\"247120: encoding/binary: read at most MaxVarintLen64 bytes in ReadUvarint.\"](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/247120)\n\nShoutout to @Butta for his work on the beaconchain explorer.\n\n### Rados≈Çaw Kapka\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Software Engineer\n- May 2020 \n\nWhat struck me most when I joined the project was the seemingly infinite amount of good will and patience from others when onboarding a new contributor. I really appreciate it. As for the future, I fail to see how Eth2 can not succeed when there are so many great people working on it.\n\nShoutout to the whole Prysmatic team! Everyone is so cool I can't just pick one person.\n\nI planned to visit Japan in the summer of 2020 and start learning Eth2 after coming back. The pandemic ruined my plans so I joined the Prysm project in May as a contributor. Three months later I got invited to be one of the core team members. Pretty cool, huh? I guess 2020 is not that bad after all.\n\n### Raul Jordan\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nWe went from being a bunch of hobbyists and volunteers interested in Ethereum's future, to having a ton of responsibility with a client being used by a large portion of stakers today. Core dev work was indistinguishable from magic to me before starting on this, and it honestly still is. However, I am fortunate to be surrounded by people much smarter than I am, and constantly learning how to write better code. Every day, we feel the weight of the work we do and we foresee it will only keep getting more important, as Phases 1 and 2 develop and eventually Ethereum will be powering world-scale transaction volume, likely using the code we wrote. At some point, the blockchain we are building might have multinational implications, and the hard work from the research team to make it as robust as possible is very encouraging. I could not be any happier with how far it‚Äôs come along, and we'll ship it.\n\nI am most proud of our [original eth2 API](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/ethereumapis). One day I was hanging out with Preston and Terence and we‚Äôre like ‚Äúwhoa! Etherscan built a block explorer using our API for eth2??‚Äù and then beaconcha.in popped up and it was honestly mind-blowing. We spent a lot of time putting it together and it contributed to the success of the Prysm client early on.\n\nOur most memorable bug would have to be the [Medalla Testnet Incident](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-medalla-testnet-incident-f7fbc3cc934a).\n\nI admire my team at Prysmatic Labs. I look up to them every week in awe of their resourcefulness, prescience, and just overall raw software engineering knowledge.\n\nOur journey with eth2 started with a few of us posting in a go-ethereum gitter channel regarding starting a prototype implementation of Vitalik‚Äôs sharding FAQ. Little did we know that just a few months later, we would be neck deep into everything about proof of stake and sharding with Vitalik and the Ethereum Research team in Taipei. Coincidentally, I was visiting New York the same week I met Preston online via gitter, and managed to meet up in his office and start Prysmatic Labs officially within the next few days!\n\n### Robert Drost \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Project Manager\n- August 2018 \n\nLooking back, one remarkable thing that stands out to me is the unifying culture of optimism and positivity among the people who found Eth and Eth2 and dove into working on it. Kind of by self-selection over time, it's a community that wants to strive for the positive side of things. While it‚Äôs not always possible to maintain this, somehow over time it seems to always get back there again.\n\nMoving forward, two themes I look forward to will be the acceleration of innovation and delivery around Eth2, and the growth of bridging among Eth2 and most other crypto communities and protocols that matter.\n\nShoutout to Casey Detrio ‚Äî I love how he always seems to find a novel analysis angle to things!\n\n### Sam Wilson \n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Protocol Research Engineer\n- October 2019 \n\nWell, I'm a relative newcomer to Ethereum. I'd been vaguely aware of Ethereum for years, and I had (and still have) a couple hundredths of a bitcoin lying around, but Devcon V was jumping head first into the space.\n\nThe Ethereum community, once you get past all the... crap on the fringe, is full of really welcoming people who come from really diverse philosophies. I found that particularly surprising, given how many scammers and hangers on there are.\n\nEth2, which is actually where I started learning Ethereum, is a huge undertaking being built by an equally huge amorphous conglomeration. Seeing the discussions from execution environments and WASM to pure data availability and minimal execution, and the journey from where we were a year ago to actually getting the beacon chain launched has been one of the most exciting periods of my career so far.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next phases, layers, and whatever else comes with Eth2, but more importantly, I'm excited for the memes, because really, that's what this is all about.\n\nIt's hard to compare what I've contributed with the amazing other things going on in the space, but I guess I'd have to say that the write-up on dynamic state access that Ansgar Dietrichs and I put together is probably the most influential thing I've worked on: [\"State Provider Models in Ethereum 2.0.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/state-provider-models-in-ethereum-2-0/6750)\n\n### Shay Zluf\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- March 2019 \n\nLooking back on this past two years makes me feel how this space is being shaped by the people who build it, their values and their convictions. Working in Prysmatic Labs developed my skills and code quality in a way that I cannot describe. Raul Jordan and Preston van Loon make sure to lead by example. All the team members are super motivated and take eth2.0's success as their own responsibility. That kind of dedication comes only from taking part in a project that has higher purpose for each member of the team. Looking forward, I see those bright and enthusiastic figures attracting many more talented people into the eth2.0 effort, while step by step the Ethereum ecosystem becomes the collaboration infrastructure of humanity.\n\nI took part in kickstarting the slasher implementation in Prysm's code base. As context, old POS systems had a major flaw, called the \"nothing at stake problem.\" Policing the set of rules to avoid this on the massive scale of the beacon chain is a challenge. Solving this led to the design and implementation of the Prysmatic Labs slasher. Working with other team members and protolambda from the eth2.0 research team was a great privilege. I got a first hand experience of protolambda‚Äôs ingenuity in finding novel solutions to hard problems.\n\nShoutout goes to Preston Van Loon.\n\n### Stefan Talpalaru\n\n- Status¬† \n- Client Implementer\n- November 2018 \n\nWe're moving at what probably looks like a slow pace, from the outside, but I'm confident we'll be able to replace Proof of Work with Proof of Stake. I can't wait to see the estimates for energy consumption reduction in the years to come!\n\nI'm proud of the many changes that lead to reproducible builds. It all started with replacing a language-specific package manager with Makefiles and Git submodules, in order to have a fine-grained control over all our dependencies. Over time, it grew into a somewhat reusable [\"build system.\"](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-build-system)\n\nI also liked designing and implementing well-defined components like our [metrics library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-metrics/) or the [NAT traversal library](https://github.com/status-im/nim-nat-traversal). Much messier, but equally rewarding, was changing the Nim compiler and standard library to implement [efficient stack traces](https://github.com/status-im/nim-libbacktrace).\n\nI like hunting down mysterious stack corruptions. A memorable one was due to the wrong calling convention being used in a [C library wrapper](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/677#issuecomment-575636421). Another [nice one](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/issues/640#issuecomment-57008484) was triggered by a procedure parameter called \"errno\" (which the Nim compiler forgot to name-mangle).\n\n### Terence Tsao\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Cofounder, Client Implementer\n- January 2018 \n\nIt has been an amazing journey, we have learned and accomplished so much along the way. Lots of great memories and friendships were formed. \n\nWith Phase 0 heading towards finish line, I'm particular excited about Phase 1 and all its cutting edge research. Go Eth2!\n\n### Victor Farazdagi\n\n- Prysmatic Labs¬† \n- Engineer\n- February 2020 \n\nMy Ethereum journey started in 2016, when I joined Status in building a censorship-resistant messenger. It quickly became apparent that, despite all the goodness the Ethereum platform and its decentralized network brought, in its current implementation they are relatively limited. So, getting attracted to Ethereum 2, with all its ambitious plans to revamp an already hugely innovative product, was just a matter of time for me. Right now, being part of the amazing crowd of highly motivated, even idealistic, people - with a chance to participate in delivering on the original Ethereum promises - is nothing less than a dream come true. I love the community, the leadership, and even the complexity of the software we're building. With Phase 0 behind us, we have significant momentum, so 2021 will definitely become a year of groundbreaking accomplishments!\n\nOne bit of work I am particularly proud of is the [\"initial synchronization implementation,\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/tree/develop/beacon-chain/sync/initial-sync) which absolutely every beacon-node runner relies on. So, whenever you cannot sync, or sync takes forever, you know who to blame for it now!\n\nRegarding nasty bugs, during the [\"Medalla incident\"](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/7039) in August 2020, we had troubles syncing back. While the fix was easy, discovering the problem wasn't.\n\nShoutout to Diederik Loerakker! (yeah, better known as protolambda)\n\n### Vitalik Buterin\n\n- Ethereum Foundation¬† \n- Researcher\n- January 2014 \n\nI'm really happy to see how far the Ethereum ecosystem has come in the last few years! In the dark old days back in 2014-2017, it was just myself, Vlad and a couple other people thinking about proof of stake and sharding, and progress was slow; since then, there has been a rapid growth, professionalization and general improvement in the ecosystem and the team. We have much more sophisticated tools, are dealing with advanced cryptography, and a much better process for creating and refining the spec and the implementations. 2020 eth2 is sooo much better than Casper in 2017!\n\nNow, of course, we enter what may perhaps prove to be the most difficult part of the whole process: getting eth2 actually out the door and running. The whole process reminds me of what we had to deal with back in 2015, except this time there's 10x the complexity, 100x more people watching and 1000x the value at stake. Good luck all :)\n\nIf I had to pick one component I'm proud of .. maybe [the entire phase 0 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md)?\n\nShoutout to Danny.\n\n### Will Villanueva\n\n- Quilt¬† \n- Researcher\n- February 2018 \n\nEth2 research was overwhelmingly fun. We explored pushing the boundaries on how the execution layer could operate. We prototyped, researched, and implemented a simpler version of advanced execution (Execution Environments) on eth1, also known as account abstraction.\n\nA lot of the work Quilt pursued is covered in the post titled [\"Ethereum 2.0 Phase 2 Progress.\"](https://medium.com/@william.j.villanueva/ethereum-2-0-phase-2-progress-7673b57eabff) \n\nAdditionally, some of our account abstraction work can be found on Ethresear.ch as [\"DoS Vectors in Account Abstraction (AA) or Validation Generalization, a Case Study in Geth.\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/dos-vectors-in-account-abstraction-aa-or-validation-generalization-a-case-study-in-geth/7937)\n\nShoutout to Danny Ryan, all the way!\n\n[Onward [Beacon Book]](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=32)\n\n---\n\n*Kudos for reading to the end!

{"id": "0-y9AbDjh100m5uKxnjQm3IWxjEYCOawQU-m_EzCfVg", "title": "Crypto-native newsletter businesses", "body": "Three months ago, I was catching up with one of my previous engineering managers. He told me about a new startup he joined called Mirror which was building a decentralized protocol for writers.\n\nOver the past year, I saw a few failed projects try to do something similar so I was immediately skeptical. But after speaking with the team and learning about recent developments in the space, I‚Äôm now convinced that a protocol for crypto-native newsletter businesses is a really interesting opportunity.\n\nI‚Äôm so convinced that I decided to join the Mirror team to help build this future. \n\nCrypto provides new tools for *financing*, *monetization*, and *growth*, These tools can enable more creators to succeed as independents. This is what excites me most about the space. Many of these ideas can be applied not just to newsletter businesses, but any media business on the internet.\n\nIn the rest of this post, we‚Äôll explore:\n- Problems with existing tools\n- How crypto can help\n- Hard problems\n- Potential product roadmap\n\nLeggo.\n\n\n### Problems with existing tools\nLeaving the corporate world to go independent seems to be the hot new thing. But after speaking with newsletter writers and media execs, the same problems seem to crop up.\n\n\n***Problem #1: It‚Äôs risky to get started as an independent writer***\n\nMost independent writers rely on savings until they start generating significant cash flow. As a result, this limits the number of people that can take the plunge to go independent.\n\n\n***Problem #2: Writers are limited to just a few monetization channels***\n\nThe two main monetization channels for newsletter writers are: subscriptions and ads. Subscriptions are great because they provide recurring revenue but it usually takes a bit of time to build enough trust for people to pay for a subscription. Subscriptions also suffer from what I call ‚Äúthe paywall paradox‚Äù.\n\nIf you put your best content behind a paywall, it‚Äôll be harder to acquire new subscribers. But if you make your best content free, it‚Äôll be harder to retain subscribers.\n\nMeanwhile, ads allow you to monetize publicly accessible content. However, it‚Äôs a pain in the ass to constantly go through the cycle of sourcing ad partners, closing deals, and managing the relationship.\n\n\n***Problem #3: Sustainable growth is hard***\n\nI love reading newsletters but I‚Äôve found myself subscribing and unsubscribing to paid newsletters pretty frequently these days. There‚Äôs only a finite amount of time I have to read newsletters each month and I inevitably end up paying for a few that I never actually read. \n\nI try to support writers even if I‚Äôm not reading their work but I wonder how many independent newsletters will end up being successful as more get started over time. I think bundling newsletters is a potential antidote to newsletter fatigue which we‚Äôll cover in a bit.\n\n\n***Problem #4: Risk of burnout***\n\nWriting is hard. Writing every week is really hard. Writing something so good every week that people are willing to pay you is *really fucking hard*. \n\nThere needs to be better ways of helping writers collaborate so they can share the workload, make a sustainable living and feel like they‚Äôre being their best creative selves.\n\n\n### How crypto can help\n\nContrary to what many crypto people will lead you to believe, crypto can't solve all of the world's problems. But it's pretty good at a few things.\n\nHere are some ways crypto can enable new models for newsletter businesses.\n\n\n***Reduce the risk of going independent through a global permissionless crowdfund***\n\nCrowdfunding has existed on the internet for a while now. But the main issue is that it can be restrictive. Many times, crowdfunding platforms limit who can contribute based on where you live geographically or whether you‚Äôre an accredited investor.\n\n*Crypto enables global permissionless crowdfunds*. As long as you have an Ethereum address and some ETH, you can participate. This opens up the opportunity for people all over the world to raise money for any creative project.\n\nThis past summer, Stir had a cool drop where creators could spin up a landing page and build an email list of supporters before going independent. But what's the crypto-native version of this? \n\nWith crypto, creators can spin up a landing page that allows supporters to send ETH and ERC20 tokens to an escrow contract in return for a newsletter token. Once the creator is ready to go independent, the funds could be streamed to the creator and backers could reduce fraud risk by periodically voting to ensure the creator is hitting certain milestones. Early contributors can also share in the upside by receiving dividends in proportion to how many newsletter tokens they hold.\n\nIn crypto, *bits are money*. As a result, we can develop clever systems for reducing risk and aligning incentives between creators and their communities.\n\n\n***Monetize through NFTs***\n\nI‚Äôm surprised I got this far without mentioning NFTs ü•¥ Beyond the hype, I believe NFTs are a key primitive for helping creators unlock value.\n\nNFTs turn any digital media file (eg essays, songs, art, podcasts, etc.) into an economic asset that can be monetized directly. Instead of being limited to subscriptions or ad revenue, you can monetize each individual essay by minting it as an NFT and selling it to your superfans as a collectible. This enables digital media to be monetized without a paywall or ads. \n\nWe‚Äôre still super duper early, but I think this gets really interesting when tools are built to turn essays into their own IP universe. \n\nImagine you want to do an in-depth profile on Drake. You could raise money through a crowdfund, commission an artist to create digital art pieces that reflect themes in the report, mint them as NFTs and sell them as collectibles. You could also auction off access to exclusive communities and discussions.\n\nThe takeaway here is that NFTs open up an entirely new design space for monetization that we‚Äôve still barely explored.\n\n\n***Accelerate growth through community ownership***\n\nBy using crypto rails, you can issue tokens to your community to align incentives and supercharge growth. I think the coolest thing you could do with a newsletter token is give token holders a percentage of future earnings in the form of on-chain dividends. As revenue accrues to an on-chain treasury for the newsletter, token holders can periodically receive payouts.\n\nToken holders can also participate in governance decisions like what topic a writer should cover next, what media formats they should expand to, and what writers should be added to the bundle.\n\nSimilar to NFTs, the design space for newsletter tokens is still underexplored. Yet, I believe crypto's ability to align communities through economic incentives will help creators develop new models for acquisition, engagement, and retention.\n\n\n***Easily create bundles / collectives through standard smart contracts***\n\nOnly the most talented writers will be able to build a sustainable business as a one-person show. I think the majority of writers will end up joining some sort of bundle or collective. Collectives are a great way for writers to increase distribution, optimize willingness to pay, and reduce burnout risk.\n\nWe‚Äôre still early, but crypto provides powerful tools for building shared collectives around creative work. If you want to create a newsletter bundle in web2, you‚Äôll probably need to build a complex stack for tracking analytics, executing revenue share agreements, a CMS, a branded website, and more.\n\nIf you squint, these newsletter bundles start to look more like SaaS businesses than writer collectives. Talented techies can make this work, but most writers can‚Äôt. Cryptonetworks natively provide tools that make these types of collectives much easier to start, scale, and govern.\n\nThings like royalty payments and rev shares will eventually become standard smart contracts that anybody can plug into. The best part is that you don‚Äôt need to trust that the collective will compensate you fairly. As long as you use a standard smart contract, you can be pretty confident that you‚Äôll get paid based on a deterministic set of rules.\n\nOnce we build these standard smart contracts, I believe it‚Äôll eventually become the default way for creative work to be produced, shared, and owned on the internet.\n\n\n### Hard problems\nTo reiterate, this stuff is still quite speculative. We have ideas about how this could work in theory, but still need to prove them out. Here are some of the hardest problems today with building crypto-native newsletter businesses.\n\n\n***Onboarding sucks***\n\nBefore you can participate in a cryptonetwork like Ethereum, you need to install a smart wallet and turn fiat into ETH. It‚Äôs not rocket science, but it‚Äôs also not anything like signing up with an email and password. You also need to overcome the mental hurdle of trusting these decentralized systems. (*‚ÄúWhat do you mean it‚Äôs not FDIC insured?‚Äù*)\n\n\n***High gas fees***\n\nHigh gas fees price out large swathes of the population from buying ETH and minting NFTs. There are a lot of really smart people working on solutions like L2 protocols, new L1 blockchains, cross-chain bridges, Ethereum 2.0, etc., so I‚Äôm pretty confident this will get solved eventually.\n\n\n***Writing secure, composable, and powerful smart contracts***\n\nIf you‚Äôre a decent software engineer, it‚Äôs fairly easy to learn how to write smart contracts. However, it‚Äôs difficult to write secure contracts that can handle billions of dollars of volume without being exploited. The best smart contract engineers also have a deep understanding of mechanism design and domain expertise in whatever they‚Äôre building. We need more world-class engineers building these systems.\n\n\n***Regulatory compliance***\n\nIf a newsletter token just serves as a way to access exclusive content and participate in community governance, then it probably passes the [Howey Test](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets) (this determines whether a digital asset should be regulated by the SEC as a security). However, things get murky when token holders begin receiving cash flows.\n\nI believe in the importance of securities laws to protect consumers but I also believe in the power of creators building decentralized economic networks. We need more thoughtful discussions around how to reconcile the tension between regulation and decentralization.\n\n\n### Product roadmap\nHere are a few features and tools I‚Äôd love to see built for crypto-native media businesses in the next few months. These tools can also be abstracted in a way that they can be reused to support any sort of creative work. Whether that's a collective for musicians, digital artists, podcasters, etc.\n\n\n***Moar smart contracts***\n\nCrypto-native media businesses have a few components: tokenized crowdfunding, publications, ability to mint NFTs, community governance, a treasury, etc. There are some smart contracts that perform these functions but we‚Äôll need standards and audits around these contracts so developers can compose and remix these features as they please. \n\n\n***Developer tools***\n\nOne of the common complaints with existing newsletter products is that they don‚Äôt offer enough customization. Crypto-native newsletter products should be easy to customize like a SquareSpace site or Webflow. To do this, there needs to be easy to use tools like subgraphs and SDKs for 3rd-party developers to build their own interfaces for on-chain data. \n\n\n***Better writing experience***\n\nMirror has already added the ability to include crypto-native features like crowdfunding and NFTs into essays but what are other ways we could make writing more expressive and multimedia? What does a crypto-native version of Notion look and feel like?\n\n\n***Build an economic social graph***\n\nIn Web2, social graphs are weighted based on engagement metrics such as likes, retweets, shares, etc. In Web3, bits are money. Therefore, we can build social graphs weighted based on economic engagement. For example, what if I could go to your Mirror profile and see all the projects you contributed to, how much you contributed, how early you were, and how much money you made?\n\nFood for thought - what would a ‚ÄúCrunchbase for Creators‚Äù look like using crypto rails?\n\n\n***Marketplaces***\n\nThere really is no such thing as an independent writer. All creative work is collaborative. Maybe you have an editor, or a researcher, or a graphic designer. \n\nSo how do we build crypto-native marketplaces that allow people to easily find jobs they‚Äôre suited for and get compensated fairly? \n\n\n***Community-driven capital allocation***\n\nHow do we build tools for people to post bounties for creative work they'd like to see, get it crowdfunded, let contributors decide who gets to perform the bounty, and allow supporters to share in the earnings? \n\nHow do we help products spin up crypto-native creator funds where the community decides who gets to receive investment? How do we help the community receive a share of the earnings produced by the selected creators?\n\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nFrom the outside looking in, a lot of stuff in crypto looks like overengineering.\n\nYet, I think we‚Äôre just starting to understand the importance of helping creators tap into a global permissionless economic network. The importance of helping creators monetize their work in new and creative ways. The importance of helping creators build economically incentivized communities.\n\nCrypto isn‚Äôt just a new technology, it‚Äôs a new philosophy for how creative work is produced, shared, and owned on the internet.

I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn‚Äôt meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you‚Äôd think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend‚Äôs living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn‚Äôt just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it‚Äôs not just a technology. It‚Äôs a philosophy. It‚Äôs a belief system. It‚Äôs a way of viewing the world. It‚Äôs about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you‚Äôre batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood. I remember the ‚Äúaha moment‚Äù when I wrote my first smart contract. With just a few lines of code and a private key, I was able to transfer an internet-native currency anywhere in the world in seconds. \n\nI didn‚Äôt have to sign up for Stripe. I didn‚Äôt have to use the Plaid API to connect a bank account. I didn‚Äôt have to check if TransferWise supported payments for a specific country. There was no centralized party. Just a peer-to-peer cryptonetwork called Ethereum. It was pretty damn mindblowing.\n\nAfter the first few weeks at Dharma, I was confident that DeFi and crypto were the future. But I also got the itch to work on some of my own ideas. I wanted to build software for creative people. Writers. Artists. Musicians. Online teachers. I strongly believe our world depends on these types of people having the tools they need to serve their communities as best they can.\n\nFrankly, I also thought it would take a couple years before the crypto industry had the infrastructure in place for a mainstream consumer app to be built.\n\n\nSo I ended up leaving Dharma to take some time off and explore a few startup ideas. But a couple months ago I read a [manifesto](https://cryptomedia.wtf/) by [Zora](https://zora.co/) that changed how I thought about crypto.\n\nIt described a world where crypto could be used to give any digital media file (eg an image, a song, an essay, digital art, etc.) property rights. It explained how cryptonetworks could turn digital media into liquid financial assets, secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts.\n\nAlthough the individual ideas weren‚Äôt new, they were combined and articulated in a way that just made sense. And not just to me.\n\n[Digital artists](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9), [athletes](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html), [social media influencers](https://cryptoslate.com/logan-paul-nfts-sell-3-5-million-worth-on-first-day-of-release/), [tech executives](https://scottbelsky.medium.com/the-furry-lisa-cryptoart-the-new-economy-of-digital-creativity-6cb2300ea081), [media executives](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI), and [journalists](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1366554892035219462) that never took the crypto weirdos seriously, seem to be taking notice.\n\nBut let‚Äôs be real. Is this latest NFT craze a bubble? Probz. Yet, is there at least a kernel of value in the idea of ownership over creative work? I think so.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell, there‚Äôs been a lot of talk about high transaction fees and lack of scalability in these systems. Although I do think these problems should and will get fixed, a lack of technical scalability is kinda the point.\n\nCryptonetworks trade off technical scalability for social scalability.\n\nFacebook is technically scalable because it‚Äôs a social network that processes millions of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is socially scalable because it‚Äôs a trillion dollar economic network without a centralized authority.\n\nCrypto isn‚Äôt just a technological revolution. It‚Äôs also a revolution in capital formation and human coordination. How creative projects are funded. How groups of people are incentivized. How organizations are structured.\n\nYears from now, when I‚Äôm old and senile, I believe we‚Äôll look back at this period as an [Internet Renaissance](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1343210395704541189) of sorts. \n\nA time where we dared to fight back against systems that have been designed for centuries to elevate certain groups and keep others disenfranchised.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe all this crypto stuff really is just an intellectual ideal that‚Äôll never work in practice. Regardless, I think it‚Äôs at least worth trying.", "timestamp": 1625676927, "digest": "pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

We‚Äôre looking for thoughtful, kind, and compassionate members with an operational background.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8615428c-fc33-46cd-8c38-41a831cef153.jpeg?height=726&width=1334)\n\n### Treasury \n\nAs the FWB DAO matures in operations and begins to explore revenue streams, having an experienced treasury management team becomes paramount for cost control and transparency for the community.\n\nThe Treasury team will help set budgets for various teams ranging from Editorial to Product, as well as continue to provide quarterly financial recaps on runway, success metrics, and revenue. \n\nJoin the [Treasury team](https://airtable.com/shrFKE83fThjmffDU) to help define the future of DAO processes and strategies.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/499a55a3-e103-4c0a-ad94-7a8f64a42658.jpeg?height=726&width=1334)\n\n------\n\nTying it all together, these four teams set the stage for the first round of many to come.\n\nWe‚Äôll be tracking engagement through active participation in a team, ultimately building on the evolution of FWB to build more verticals for members of all disciplines to get involved in the ways they see fit.\n\nMore on this front coming SoonTM!\n\n## Season Three Membership\n\nStarting on July 9th, the membership threshold will be raised to 75 $FWB.\n\nThis threshold was decided through governance and finalized through a [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmRQiMmyfAFD8DxhGGyFMYZecLcGGCS5wQQVBPqRjTA2a8).\n\nWe‚Äôve [distributed 2000 FWB](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1r555SU_CAb5-rMIl2y3stpwx8_YvR6RLENczLMoWPHE/edit?usp=sharing) (or twice as much as last Season) through SourceCred across all members who have linked their wallet to earn FWB from their contributions to Discord.\n\nWhile the last two Seasons featured a 5 FWB increase, this Season's 15 FWB increase should create an active push for members to engage with a team of their choice.\n\nAs we create deeper relationships, so too should the ability to get involved.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt done so already, please [consider applying](https://airtable.com/shrFKE83fThjmffDU) for a team of your choice. While still in its early stages, there‚Äôs no better way to add value to the DAO than by working with your Friends.\n\nRegardless, we‚Äôre thrilled to be pioneering what it means to work in a decentralized world and look forward to curating the next wave of culture for all to enjoy.\n\nWith each passing Season, the FWB family grows stronger.\n\nThank you to each and every loyal contributor and we look forward to expanding what it means to be a [Friend with Benefits](https://discord.gg/4Sk79s)", "timestamp": 1625678017, "digest": "TvKSPfZqHNXRZVYFYyJuziCMIZ8fZ34q585YcUYRGtc", "contributor": "0xCaCEa967ae0d35d2A006Bb63ec557Fd8A6F013db"}

They transcend platforms, geographic locations, and language. NFTs are slowly becoming the economic infrastructure behind the internet's content and creators. Recent demand for meme NFTs has proven memes are more valuable when minted as NFTs. Here we explore minting memes as NFTs, arguing that soon most memes will be minted as NFTs due to advantages in monetization, provenance, attribution, and platform-agnosticism. \n\nWe define *meme* in this piece not by its broad definition as \"a passing element of a culture or system of behavior\" but by its media-focused definition of \"a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by internet users.\" This makes the argument easier to comprehend, though many of the fundamentals argued in this piece may apply to memes more broadly.\n\n## First Classic Memes, then Fresh Memes\n\nMost memes that have recently auctioned as NFTs have been mostly pre-existing memes, meaning they were initially created off-chain and have been circulating the internet pre-minting. Some examples of pre-existing memes minted as NFTs are Doge, Nyan Cat, Disaster Girl, Bad Luck Brian, and more by the day. \n\n[Memes turned NFTs | Yupcollections](https://app.yup.io/collections/memes-turned-nfts/CguHLel)\n\nThe minting of classic memes as NFTs serves as a precursor for genuine 'fresh memes' that originate as NFTs.

For example, as the graphic highlights below, the Nyan Cat NFT is showcased and displayed on various marketplaces and platforms. The famous meme GIF is linked to the address of the NFT so when someone shares the original NFT in their article, they can pull the on-chain address. This is powerful for memes because it allows them to maintain attribution and context in every platform. So any action on a meme NFT is accessible, readable, and usable in almost all platforms. Every bid, swap, and transaction is added to the metadata of that specific NFT.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/951f5a64-ff12-4881-a4fb-d6504f4995fe.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\n\nAs Web3 social continues to evolve, the engagement data associated with an NFT also becomes platform agnostic. With [Yup](http://yup.io), for example, the likes and comments given across the web are tied directly to an NFT. This is quite different than web2 social. For example, if a meme is shared on both FB and Twitter, there's no relationship between those two memes so hard to attribute the relationship between the two.

Users will mint images that they don't own -- there are no rights and copyright for commercial use but they are getting rewarded for it.

But seeing improvements in layer 1 and layer 2, it's becoming cheaper and cheaper to mint any graphics as an NFT\n\nWhat we expect to see next is price of NFTs will drop to a cent or less than a cent. Once it's cheap enough to casually mint NFTs, people will.

{"id": "bojK0DFuT6_xUF37YisdpbogkeeTIbDZv6cBPBH86Mc", "title": "Sketch for a NFT-based Media Company", "body": "### The Brand\nThe publication is voice-driven digital content that inspires loyalty in readers: arriving every day, reaching them where they are, communicating about things they need to know about or identify with closely. The publication serves a self-selecting demographic of cultural consumers who are obsessive, and either need or want to know about the content.\n\nThe brand needs to be specific and identifiable, standing out in the media landscape of heritage brands, somewhat interchangeable newsletters, and voices on Twitter. It has to be distinct, recognizable from only a few elements wherever it is found. The editorial voice is part of that brand, but it also must be (audio)visual. (\"Content\" is not solely writing, or even information.)\n\n### The Format\nNewsletters deliver longform content and close relationships with writers. The real-time delivery is also useful, but closer to real-time can be found on Twitter. More intimacy can be found in podcasts or tight communities online, the interactive fandoms of organizations like Chapo Trap House or $FWB. The publication must prioritize its community of consumers by giving them intimacy with the creators and with the brand, less a newspaper or information service than a space in which to participate, feeling nonhierarchical. It needs a sense of digital belonging.\n\nUnlike many newsletters, the publication cannot be tied to a singular voice because that voice is not its only value proposition. Many contributors should participate in the brand and want to be a part of it, as creators and consumers. The identity of both writing for and reading the publication should be aspirational. For that quality, the publication also has to be relatively visual, able to function as a marker for itself, like the provenance label on a bottle of wine ‚Äî Denominazione di Origine Controllata of content.\n\n### The Structure\nThe staff of the publication can be low-weight at first, with one editor, one or several staff writers, an array of freelance contributors, and contributing artists and designers for visual content, which is given equal priority to textual content, creating a framework. Content is delivered in whichever formats the audience grows to prefer, from text to audio to graphics.\n\nWhat matters more than the platform the content is delivered on is its ability to stay consistent, always calling back to the voice and community of the publication. Like a cryptocurrency, it should be able to stay itself wherever it goes or whoever is consuming it. This is not the decentralization of mainstream publications posting links on Facebook; it's the decentralization of file piracy or crypto mining.\n\nThe publication is not a magazine but an architectural structure, an art gallery, a fashion brand, a sports team, a video game, a flower that blooms at a specific time ‚Äî something you inhabit and watch evolve.\n\n### The Business Model\nThe publication is funded by NFTs and social tokens. NFTs require specific relationships and consumers to function: A small number of NFTs need to attract high-value buyers or a large number of NFTs (expensive to mint) need to attract mid-value buyers in order to sustain an entire publication, paying for staff and freelancers.\n\nWhat makes NFTs valuable is provenance: in the case of visual art, the artist is credible and the art is compelling, or, in the case of a novel, the author's previous work and novel proposal is compelling. What would make publication NFTs compelling is strong art, a connection to the brand (provenance), and context, building a coherent body of NFT production that functions alongside and through the publication. It's important that the NFTs have a logic just as the editorial has a logic.\n\nSocial tokens ($PUBLICATION) can raise money for a publication or fund new efforts, giving holders a proxy for equity in the overall project that exists more on the back-end. NFTs can monetize social tokens for the holders and give readers / consumers a way to interact with the brand, as well as to participate in its economics.

{"id": "btHa11iPJl4ykwto2biqRvJcCHYUGhz5X9suQejoQPQ", "title": "Sketch for a NFT-Based Media Company", "body": "### The Brand\nThe publication is voice-driven digital content that inspires loyalty in readers: arriving every day, reaching them where they are, communicating about things they need to know about or identify with closely. The publication serves a self-selecting demographic of cultural consumers who are obsessive, and either need or want to know about the content.\n\nThe brand needs to be specific and identifiable, standing out in the media landscape of heritage brands, somewhat interchangeable newsletters, and voices on Twitter. It has to be distinct, recognizable from only a few elements wherever it is found. The editorial voice is part of that brand, but it also must be (audio)visual. (\"Content\" is not solely writing, or even information.)\n\n### The Format\nNewsletters deliver longform content and close relationships with writers. The real-time delivery is also useful, but closer to real-time can be found on Twitter. More intimacy can be found in podcasts or tight communities online, the interactive fandoms of organizations like Chapo Trap House or $FWB. The publication must prioritize its community of consumers by giving them intimacy with the creators and with the brand, less a newspaper or information service than a space in which to participate, feeling nonhierarchical. It needs a sense of digital belonging.\n\nUnlike many newsletters, the publication cannot be tied to a singular voice because that voice is not its only value proposition. Many contributors should participate in the brand and want to be a part of it, as creators and consumers. The identity of both writing for and reading the publication should be aspirational. For that quality, the publication also has to be relatively visual, able to function as a marker for itself, like the provenance label on a bottle of wine ‚Äî Denominazione di Origine Controllata of content.\n\n### The Structure\nThe staff of the publication can be low-weight at first, with one editor, one or several staff writers, an array of freelance contributors, and contributing artists and designers for visual content, which is given equal priority to textual content, creating a framework. Content is delivered in whichever formats the audience grows to prefer, from text to audio to graphics.\n\nWhat matters more than the platform the content is delivered on is its ability to stay consistent, always calling back to the voice and community of the publication. Like a cryptocurrency, it should be able to stay itself wherever it goes or whoever is consuming it. This is not the decentralization of mainstream publications posting links on Facebook; it's the decentralization of file piracy or crypto mining.\n\nThe publication is not a magazine but an architectural structure, an art gallery, a fashion brand, a sports team, a video game, a flower that blooms at a specific time ‚Äî something you inhabit and watch evolve.\n\n### The Business Model\nThe publication is funded by NFTs and social tokens. NFTs require specific relationships and consumers to function: A small number of NFTs need to attract high-value buyers or a large number of NFTs (expensive to mint) need to attract mid-value buyers in order to sustain an entire publication, paying for staff and freelancers.\n\nWhat makes NFTs valuable is provenance: in the case of visual art, the artist is credible and the art is compelling, or, in the case of a novel, the author's previous work and novel proposal is compelling. What would make publication NFTs compelling is strong art, a connection to the brand (provenance), and context, building a coherent body of NFT production that functions alongside and through the publication. It's important that the NFTs have a logic just as the editorial has a logic.\n\nSocial tokens ($PUBLICATION) can raise money for a publication or fund new efforts, giving holders a proxy for equity in the overall project that exists more on the back-end. NFTs can monetize social tokens for the holders and give readers / consumers a way to interact with the brand, as well as to participate in its economics. The NFTs have to be desirable in a variety of ways, both as high-end patronage and as casual affiliation, like New Yorker tote bags.\n\nThe NFTs are not iterations of the text content, or symbolic of the content (a la the New York Times column), but are a form of content in themselves. Think of a publication that is inextricable from and funded by a marketplace of NFTs like Cryptopunks, where the publication is the only authority that can create more.
