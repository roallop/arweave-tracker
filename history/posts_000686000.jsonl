The attention economy is booming, and people are becoming comfortable spending money on high quality digital media. Although the last several decades have seen us earning mostly as independent agents, people are increasingly joining forces to earn money together under shared group identities.\n\nThe challenge that we're facing is that the internet isn't built for group users. This means that everything that a group does, it does via its individual members who act on its behalf. In order for high levels of control to be placed in the hands of key individuals, these groups either need a high degree of structure or a high degree of trust for one another.\n\nFaced with this tradeoff, more and more people are choosing the latter— working with people they already trust, starting with their friends. Even the uncharted territory of mixing business and friendship seems to be an improvement over the stale bureaucratic structures of the last century, which clearly no longer reflect the way that we coordinate with one another. \n\nNonetheless, here is a guide to avoiding trouble when making money with friends online. We're far too early for this list to be exhaustive, but I hope it can be a useful starting point if you're thinking about diving into the deep end yourself.\n\n## 1. Respect People's Ideas \nThe best way to validate any idea is to talk about it with smart people that you already know — the friends of yours who hopefully know at least a little bit about your chosen domain. The idea stage is an extremely sensitive time in any project's formation, especially for the people doing the ideating. Naturally, things can get uncomfortable if individuals begin to use other peoples' insights from these conversations on their own. Sometimes this looks like explicitly stealing ideas, but more often it's much more indirect. \n\nUltimately 2 good rules of thumb here are:\n\n- if someone is using you as a sounding board for a new idea, err on the side of remaining an external voice, and don't assume your own inclusion in the project unless you're explicitly invited\n- if you're actively ideating, err on the side of under-sharing with people you don't fully trust not to cut you out of your own project\n\nComplications can arise as each new perspective molds an idea into being increasingly valuable, so it's important that ideas are valued, and that the people who come up with them are given fair credit.\n\n## 2. Set Expectations Early with a Friend-Prenup\nOnce it becomes clear that what you're building has the potential to be valuable, you should have a conversation to set up some formal structure to help enable the collaboration.\n\nSome some basic details think about are:\n\n- how are you splitting the ownership and money you'll earn together?\n- how are you accounting for costs that you might incur?\n- which decisions do each of you have a say over?\n- what is each person doing to earn their fair share?\n- what specific guidelines are needed based on your unique project domain?\n\nTo do this right, it's usually worth putting this in writing — emails are good, signed documents are even better. Although it may feel awkward at first, these agreements will eventually become the bedrock of your relationship, and will allow trust to more easily flourish between you all. The added benefit to doing this with explicit signatures is that it will force everyone to speak up early about what they think is fair, recognizing that it'll be much more difficult to change these details later on.\n\nThis process can sometimes get messy or uncomfortable, because of the subjective nature of valuing each other's work. In these negotiations, power is rarely distributed evenly between contributors, so arriving at a fair deal will usually require those with more power to be kind, and have foresight about the future of the project. The goal should be to retain this core team for a long time, **which means that the deal needs to be fair for everyone involved**. Importantly, the \"fairness\" of a given deal is highly subjective — a fair deal is one which participants *believe* is fair in perpetuity. If you find that this conversation gets stuck, it can also be useful to have impartial 3rd parties add their perspectives on market standards.\n\nOver time these agreements will be forced to evolve, usually in the direction of stability and legitimacy. That's why it's important to have an expectation of good-faith from all parties involved. **If you don't trust your friends to act in good faith, through good times or bad, then you probably shouldn't be trying to earn money together in this manner.**\n\n## 3. Be Open to Change\n\nAny fixed expectations that you have going into the endeavour will almost certainly have to evolve as the project responds to its environment. Unless people are willing to be cooperative and adjust based on what's fair for the group over time, your operations will end up grinding to a halt. **This is why it's important for everyone involved to understand the compounding effect of collaboration, so your focus can stay on growing the pie, instead of splitting it.**\n\nJames P. Carse talks about this in his book *Finite and Infinite Games*, where finite games are played to be won by individual players, while infinite games are played so that they may continue to be played — the game's self perpetuation being the shared goal among all players:\n\n> The rules of an infinite game must change in the course of play. The rules are changed when the players of an infinite game agree that the play is imperiled by a finite outcome — that is, by the victory of some players and the defeat of others. The rules of an infinite game are changed to prevent anyone from winning the game and to bring as many persons as possible into the play.\n\nIf the friends you want to work with believe that keeping people happy matters more than what they stand to gain from \"winning\" on each others' behalf, then these evolutions will be flawless. If however people are continuously stretching the fairness of the arrangement in their own favour, relationships will weaken and the trust that you started with will evaporate.\n\n## 4. Remember the Stakes\n\nOne of the things that's tricky about working with friends is that the stakes are much higher than in normal business situations. Working together, you will inevitibly face tradeoffs based on the way that responsibilities and value are split up. If members approach each moment remembering what they have to lose, they will avoid making the mistake of sacrificing a friendship or their reputation for a short-term gain.\n\nThis is a high risk/high reward environment, which if played right can allow you to move as a cohesive group with ease, responding to the world much faster than any individual or traditional organization could ever dream of. However, if played incorrectly, what's at stake is a history that is increasingly impossible to wipe clean.\n\n## 5. Stick To Your Word\n\nWhen doing business with friends, integrity is extremely important. Reputations matter, because the entire premise of the game is that the heightened trust between you enables new ways of making money together. This means that in these arrangements, one must care *even more* about their integrity than in traditional business engagements (which don't normally require such high degrees of trust between members).\nMy personal guideline here is to avoid ever making promises I can't keep, to follow through on all of the promises that I *do* make, and in situations where that's impossible, to approach people as early and often as I can to make sure everyone remains happy. By approaching situations with an honest positive intention, you'll find your friends will come through for you when you need them to. The absence of transparency will have the opposite effect though, and will leave your friends feeling taken advantage of. Staying proactive is key.\n\n## 6. Be Transparent\n\nAt the end of the day, the top requirement for friends to be able to make money together is being open with each other about all of the important details of the arrangement. Sharing information builds goodwill, and over time establishes trust as everyone sees that no one has anything to hide. This will become less and less necessary as your project matures, but early on a high level of transparency is a must. \n\nSome examples of important things which should actively be shared are:\n\n- any ways that members are benefiting from the arrangement (either directly or indirectly)\n- any conflicts of interest that members might have (because of activities they do outside of the arrangement)\n- any changes that might occur with each member's expected contributions\n\nYou should also aim to have a culture of regularly providing feedback to each other, remembering that constructive feedback should always be shared 1-1 first (to make sure no one ever feels unfairly called out). For that reason, it's important that everyone feels comfortable talking to each other directly, rather than just in group forums.\n\nUltimately, being transparent is most often characterized as not hiding things. Keeping important information to yourself is sketchy, mostly because doing so creates the conditions for people to take advantage of each other. If you want people to enjoy working with you, transparency is a must for making that happen.\n\n---\n\nAside from these formalities, it's important to find a healthy balance between seriousness and play. The whole power of the internet is that it gives us a freedom to experiment, to be silly, to make mistakes, and to support your friends while they do the same. Making the experience of working together itself enjoyable ensures that there's at least one benefit gained if the project doesn't outright succeed — you had fun with your friends!\n\nAs people continue to realize that they're tired of working with people they wouldn't be friends with, we're going to be forced to create new sets of rules to shape how we coordinate together more fluidly. If the last century's businesses were marked by bureaucracy and structure, the next century's will be built on trust and dynamic bonds between people— unlocking the latent human potential from leftover unfair deals.\n\n---\n\nSpecial thanks to [Jordan Kutzer](https://twitter.com/JordanKutzer), [Li Jin](https://twitter.com/ljin18), and [Arya Soltanieh](https://twitter.com/LostCod3r) for their help crafting this piece.", "timestamp": 1620964697, "digest": "HNRZ7nbcR-lMpmLfYLbNysDs8ubVXB3FTitMyF6dlNY", "contributor": "0xbfDb50Dc66C8Df9fd9688D8fe5A0C34126427645"}

{"id": "_3YJzu9H7s1WZoBpzBSJK1UxkQiYckYIp2PWxEyVdFo", "title": "The journey to releasing my first NFT", "body": "After more than 7 months of checking out the Web3 (crypto) space — reading on how blockchain tech works, and projects being made here and there — I recently minted my first NFT.\n\n***Note:** Everything mentioned here are my experiences in the Ethereum blockchain. Always remember to check whether the wallet and the platform you're minting on are on the same blockchain network.*\n\n-----\n\n### How did I find out about NFTs, Web3, and stuff\nBefore I share how I got to mint my first NFT, let me share how the fuck did I get in to this wild world of crypto and Web3.\n\nI don't recall exactly how, but I'm sure it's because of how [**RAC**](https://twitter.com/rac) — a Grammy-award winning producer — has back-to-back projects happening in the space. I think this was around October 2020, but I'd like to assume I've heard of these even earlier.\n\nFrom NFTs, the super wild [**$TAPE**](https://zora.co/rac/tape) project — a token representing a physical cassette tape, — to issuing his own social token, [**$RAC**](https://blog.ourzora.com/introducing-rac), where token holders can have access to a private area in his Discord server, get discounts to merch, or even get to interact with him more.\n\nI also was introduced to Audius because of one stream he did on Twitch! [**Audius**](https://audius.co/feed) is like Soundcloud, except you (the artist) have a say on what happens to the platform. You want to have a subscription feature? Vote using the tokens given to you every time you post! **The platform's future is in the artists' hands.**\n\nAll these projects were so fascinating to see. With more focus on NFTs, the mere fact that digital artists can make a living out of JUST doing things digitally is amazing to me. No need to print your digital works as stickers, prints, posters, etc. Blockchain technology made it possible for one specific file to be called THE official one. Because of that, all the other copies scattered around the internet, and the ones to be made by saving a copy of the same file, are worthless. **The original file gets value.**\n\n### How I was able to mint my first NFT\n\nMinting (*making*) an NFT can cost around US$40-$100 in gas (*transaction*) fees on a good day, and a disgusting $400-$800 on a bad one (although why would you mint during a bad day, lol). Gas fees don’t go to the platform, but rather the people running the whole Ethereum network.\n\nIn the Philippines, $40 is already 10+% of what an entry level employee is making monthly, while $100 is like 1/3 of the same salary. **Anyway, bottomline, it's just so fucking expensive for people here.**\n\nI honestly considered saving up for a mint fund, in hopes that I can get my money back and more. That doesn't mean I'm just here for the money. I'm also here for people to validate that my work has value, maybe even greater than what I would've expected.\n\nPosting on Instagram and Twitter, getting likes for my posts, and I can't make a living out of it because all the money goes to the platforms?! **I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THIS LOGIC AFTER KNOWING ABOUT NFTs.** Did I mention that if your NFT is resold in the secondary market, you get a cut of the resale???!!!\n\nThen, while I was looking around the Creator x Crypto side of Twitter, I discovered Mint Fund.\n\n[**Mint Fund**](https://twitter.com/themintfund) is a community project that helps artists in being able to mint their first NFT by giving a grant that's enough to cover for gas fees. **They prioritize funds to BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ artists especially outside North America and Europe.** They are also working on great projects for the space like making a crowdfund for an open-source protocol.\n\nI signed up for the grant a week after they launched, but sadly didn't get in the first batch. It just meant that I was still on the waitlist! I got an email around mid or late April saying that I got in the second batch. GURL, I WAS SHOOKT. I SAW THE EMAIL WHEN I WOKE UP. Now THAT's how you start a good day!\n\n***Side Note:** For artists in South East Asia, you might also want to apply at [**First Mint Fund**](https://twitter.com/firstmintfund)! It's another community project giving grants to artists so that they can mint their first NFT.*\n\n### Minting process\n\nY'all... minting an NFT is ***EASY AS FUUUUUUUCK.*** Uploaded the file, entered some details, clicked \"Proceed\", set up a price, and I'm done. No complicated shit!\n\nBut if you're starting from nowhere, you should get an Ethereum wallet (like [**Metamask**](https://metamask.io/)) first, AND WRITE THAT SEED PHRASE DOWN (YES, THE 12 RANDOM WORDS). The seed phrase is like the ultimate password. Lose it, lose everything in your wallet.\n\nNow with that wallet, you can start connecting it to platforms like Zora, Rarible, Foundation, and more. If the platform is open to the public to mint on it, then go ahead!\n\nFor NFT platforms on the Tezos blockchain, like *hic et nunc* and Kalamint, I think Temple is one of the most used wallets there.\n\nAgain, EZ SHIT! But I do understand that it can get, or it looks overwhelming. If that's the case, just shoot me a DM on Twitter ([**@belgiangwaffles**](https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles))! I'll be happy to help you out. 😊\n\n### And here it is...\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3003)\n\nI'll be posting soon what the piece is about.\n*But for now... you might wanna... you know... make a bid or sumn...* 🥺👉👈\n\n### Zora as my chosen platform\n\nI chose [**Zora**](https://zora.co/) as the platform where I'll mint my first NFT for various reasons.\n- I feel like it's not as saturated as other open platforms.\n- They don't get a cut from my sale.\n- I have the option to not have a timed auction being started when somebody bids with my asking price.\n\n    I just feel like that it hypes the price more than the artwork itself, which I don't want to be the case. Also, I want to be able to pick who gets my piece, and not just someone because it was automated. The owner is as important as the piece, IMO.\n\n- Also, from my understanding, I can sell the same NFT on other platforms with the creator share still attached to it, so I am not stuck with Zora.\n\n    I have to verify if I understood this correctly. 💀\n\n- Lastly, I don't want to set my asking price with ETH. Speaking of...\n\n### Fun Fact: I'm not selling it for money.\n\n~~Now this, I think, is what the locals don't know, especially the outsiders hating on all of this, lmao.~~ Depending on where you mint your NFT, you can choose to sell your works NOT for money — ETH, or stablecoins (crypto that will forever be worth $1) like DAI or USDT — but for social tokens.\n\nRemember the $RAC token I was talking about earlier? I'm asking for something like that.\n\nIt's like exchanging a print, postcard, painting, whatever, for access to someone's Netflix account for a period of time, or live in the buyer's house for a month. Sure, these things have monetary value, and so does FWB, but I'm not interested in that.\n\nMy asking price is **60 $FWB** ([**Friends with Benefits**](https://fwb.help/)) which is enough for me to enter the FWB Discord server and apply to be a member. The membership, for me, is a way to widen my network especially with fellow creators in the crypto space. I want to get to know more people, see what kind of crazy projects they're up to, learn from them, exchange ideas, and maybe just chill with them as well. That's what I wish to get in exchange for my NFT.\n\nActually, you can swap your crypto to FWB. My asking price could've been the ETH or DAI equivalent of 60 FWB, but I think that's an easier route. For me, it means way more if someone from FWB sees my work and actually bids on it with their FWB tokens. It's like a cosign from a member, **legitimizing that I SHOULD be with them.**\n\n### What's next?\n\n~~Win the fuckin’ $WRITE Race!!!~~\n\nMy next goal is to join a social token community or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)! I want to know how these things work in a member's perspective, especially if I have a say on the governance of the community or organization.\n\nTHE MONEY SIDE OF CRYPTO IS TOO BORING FOR ME. The People side of crypto is where the fun is all at.\n\nI already got some $FF by [**Forefront**](https://forefront.market/). So I think I'm about to experience some of that soon.\n\nBut for now, let's **#GetGianInFWB** LMAOOOOOOO. (Yeah, tweet that hashtag.)\n## 😂 😂 💀 💀\n\n[](https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles/status/1392969582449598465?s=20)\n\n*Me when I got access to Mirror's member-only Discord...*\n\nBTW, huge thank you to [**Jackson Dame**](https://dame.mirror.xyz/) who edited my work.

Gas fees don’t go to the platform, but rather the people running the whole Ethereum network.\n\nIn the Philippines, $40 is already 10+% of what an entry level employee is making monthly, while $100 is like 1/3 of the same salary. **Anyway, bottomline, it's just so fucking expensive for people here.**\n\nI honestly considered saving up for a mint fund, in hopes that I can get my money back and more. That doesn't mean I'm just here for the money. I'm also here for people to validate that my work has value, maybe even greater than what I would've expected.\n\nPosting on Instagram and Twitter, getting likes for my posts, and I can't make a living out of it because all the money goes to the platforms?! **I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THIS LOGIC AFTER KNOWING ABOUT NFTs.** Did I mention that if your NFT is resold in the secondary market, you get a cut of the resale???!!!\n\nThen, while I was looking around the Creator x Crypto side of Twitter, I discovered Mint Fund.\n\n[**Mint Fund**](https://twitter.com/themintfund) is a community project that helps artists in being able to mint their first NFT by giving a grant that's enough to cover for gas fees. **They prioritize funds to BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ artists especially outside North America and Europe.** They are also working on great projects for the space like making a crowdfund for an open-source protocol.\n\nI signed up for the grant a week after they launched, but sadly didn't get in the first batch. It just meant that I was still on the waitlist! I got an email around mid or late April saying that I got in the second batch. GURL, I WAS SHOOKT. I SAW THE EMAIL WHEN I WOKE UP.

Always remember to check whether the wallet and the platform you're minting on are on the same blockchain network.*\n\n-----\n\n### How did I find out about NFTs, Web3, and stuff\nBefore I share how I got to mint my first NFT, let me share how the fuck did I get in to this wild world of crypto and Web3.\n\nI don't recall exactly how, but I'm sure it's because of how [**RAC**](https://twitter.com/rac) — a Grammy-award winning producer — has back-to-back projects happening in the space. I think this was around October 2020, but I'd like to assume I've heard of these even earlier.\n\nFrom NFTs, the super wild [**$TAPE**](https://zora.co/rac/tape) project — a token representing a physical cassette tape, — to issuing his own social token, [**$RAC**](https://blog.ourzora.com/introducing-rac), where token holders can have access to a private area in his Discord server, get discounts to merch, or even get to interact with him more.\n\nI also was introduced to Audius because of one stream he did on Twitch! [**Audius**](https://audius.co/feed) is like Soundcloud, except you (the artist) have a say on what happens to the platform. You want to have a subscription feature? Vote using the tokens given to you every time you post! **The platform's future is in the artists' hands.**\n\nAll these projects were so fascinating to see. With more focus on NFTs, the mere fact that digital artists can make a living out of JUST doing things digitally is amazing to me. No need to print your digital works as stickers, prints, posters, etc. Blockchain technology made it possible for one specific file to be called THE official one.

{"id": "Ryk7tqP5oKzGuEegFhYNfA4we9kVzdS-LEySRfDqMoI", "title": "The Rise of Micro-Economies", "body": "*Co-authored with [Kinjal Shah](https://twitter.com/_kinjalbshah)*\n\nWe’ve entered a new chapter of investing.\n\nOne where trading is social, and banking profits is an MMORPG game.\n\nLook at DOGE, SHIB or GME and it’s easy to see this chapter as nothing more than a game of roulette.\n\nHowever, within the midst of these experiments is the rise of something far more promising - **micro-economies**.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/mewn21/status/1390118496722309125?s=20)\n\nBy intertwining financial assets with social capital, we’re now witnessing a new type of asset class dominated by online community coordination.\n\nThis is the rise of micro-economies.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/71ac7dfe-c19b-425c-976e-ff8f7170f8ae.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nIn this post, we’ll make the case for a creator middle class, how it captures value, and why crypto primitives set the stage for the renaissance of micro-economies.\n\nLet’s dive in.\n\n## What are Micro-economies?\n\nMicro-economies are communities:\n\n- With a total market cap of less than $1,000,000\n- With under 100 active members.\n- Working for sweat equity\n- That lack legal incorporation (LLC, corp, etc.)\n\nMicro-economies have a shared mission, are pre-product and have little to no revenue. They’re in the earliest stages of hiring and resemble structures like co-ops or committees. \n\nEarly contributors carve out their own roles and compensations - loosely resembling [Teal organizations](https://workology.com/what-is-a-teal-organization/) in which every member defines their scope and value to the group.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1390357136815779845?s=20)\n\nThanks to the advent of social tokens and DAOs, communities now have the ability to create shared financial resources.\n\nA DAO provides open access and a vehicle representing ownership. Think of this as a community bank. More times than not, that community will have a shared currency representing ownership of that bank - i.e., a social token.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ljxie/status/1370459278407049223?s=20\n\nAll together, this foundation creates a unique position for a new business class to emerge.\n\n## Enter the Creator Middle Class\n\nThe [creator middle class](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class) are future mom and pop shops. For the past three decades, the internet enabled thousands of communities to emerge. But, the primary beneficiaries continue to be the top 1% while [~97% of YouTube creators](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/02/27/youtube-top-creators-revenue/) make less than the national poverty line.\n\nNiche communities are what make the internet a vibrant and open ecosystem. Within online communities, creators are evolving into SMBs, designed to activate their [1000](https://a16z.com/2021/02/27/nfts-and-a-thousand-true-fans/) or even [100 true fans](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/).\n\nNow the real question becomes - *how do we make the long tail of creators a viable path?*\n\n**In order for a niche community to become a meaningful business, they need to earn income and capture value.**\n\n## Tooling for Micro-Economies\n\nCreator tools enable micro-economies. The shift from Web2 to Web3 create revenue streams which prioritize community ownership over individual ownership. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b1b1d3dc-e3e3-46de-9882-a9b3b23d7971.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nIn Web2, creators monetize their work via a SaaS model, where they’re paid for a newsletter, artwork, or craft on a regular basis. \n\nIn Web3, creators monetize through the issuance of a social token or NFTs, with non-fungible tokens acting as digital media ownership. \n\nTokenization offers a path to crowdfund work, while also ensuring early supporters are rewarded. It prioritizes community ownership, best seen in early Mirror campaigns like [$VALUE](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/b3_zJsOv8vvvJsaOKyCM-KcCeA_zEbn6K1yrmnRSK8Q) and [$ESSAY](https://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0).\n\nMonetization becomes non-linear, meaning the derivative value of tokens are often multiples of the value created from recurring revenue streams.\n\nThese tools offer a direct way for communities to earn income, while also providing mediums to share (and multiply) the value with its members.\n\n**While Web2 is passive, web3 makes it active, thus turning communities into functioning micro-economies. **\n\n## Why Should I Care?\n\nMicro-economies give the long-tail of creators a path forward. \n\nThanks to platforms like [Coinvise](https://www.coinvise.co/) and [Rally](https://rally.io/), micro-economies can be created in an instance. They allow creators to distribute liquid instruments (in the form of tokens) to better monetize intangible contributions and sweat equity. \n\nTo contributors, it offers an unconventional path to work on what you love, and get paid in assets with exponential upside in the process.\n\nAdoption will not happen through gambling, it will happen through 100,000 niche communities teaching ten of their closest friends how crypto can make a fundamental difference in their social life today.\n\n## Key Players\n\nThe most prominent micro-economies are seen with young guns like [Anish Agnihotri](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri) - spending nights and weekends outside a degree and working full time at Polychain to build communities like PartyDAO using Mirror and Zora. Nice work, boss!\n\n[](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1389793340057694213?s=20)\n\n[Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq), [Six](https://twitter.com/sixnft) and CRE8 Club are building systems to manage the next generation of micro-economies - offering best practices to take creators from 0 to 1.\n\nCrypto-media outlets like Bankless are now [transitioning to a DAO](https://medium.com/bankless-dao/announcing-bankless-dao-133220f5efd8). This comes alongside [Forefront](https://forefront.news/blog/ff-community-incentives), and [Global Coin Research](https://globalcoinresearch.com/how-to-submit-contributor-posts/) who are all incentivizing writing contributions using their native tokens! (plus more coming SoonTM)\n\n[](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1390724377227022339?s=20)\n\n[PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO), [SongCamp](https://twitter.com/songcampdotband), [SquiggleDAO](https://twitter.com/squiggledao), Gremlins and [CypherDAO](https://twitter.com/cypherdao) are all starting to collect together. While most micro-economies won’t have [$5M to purchase Edward Snowden’s first NFT](https://foundation.app/Snowden/stay-free-edward-snowden-2021-24437), it’s exciting to highlight the power of what’s possible when resources are shared to follow an agreed upon mission.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sirsuhayb/status/1389040288006512643?s=20\n\n## How Micro-Economies Evolve\n\nAs micro-economies find their footing, it’s common to see the community band together to scale.\n\nThis is done through Treasury Diversification - a way to exchange tokens directly from the treasury with capital contributors keen to purchase sizable stakes in the group. Not only does it provide a community with working capital, but it gives the token more confidence as it’s now socially backed by world-class investors.\n\nCommunities like [Friends With Benefits](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmesG4qENC7CtAQRi5KAQbKucqRjPqGh8nJx4aR2G6mran), [Badger](https://forum.badger.finance/t/bip-37-treasury-diversification-through-strategic-partnerships/3262), [Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-ldo-treasury-diversification-part-2/506) and [Index Co-op](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-32-index-sale/1214) all successfully executed Treasury Diversification proposals.\n\nOnce working capital is available, we start to see a migration from [token-only compensation](https://magnethq.io/) to more standard payment structures and roles akin to traditional companies. This hybrid mix between a community token and USDC rivals Silicon Valley compensation packages with the added benefit of tokenized equity being liquid by default, tradable 24/7 on global DEXs like Uniswap. \n\nThis flow allows revenue generation to have a more direct tie to contributors. As micro-economies earn income, they’re incentivized to route it through a community treasury as token price *should* increase as a multiple of the growth of the treasury.\n\nTools like [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) and [SoureCred](https://sourcecred.io/docs) allow micro-economies to better rank contributions - ultimately building towards organizations in which compensation is tied to value created, rather than time spent.\n\nThanks to projects like [Parcel](https://beta-mainnet.parcel.money/dashboard), it’s never been easier to track, distribute and account for payments to and from a community treasury.\n\n**Put together, crypto offers the foundation for a sustainable creator middle class.**\n\n## Get Involved\n\nThis post is an open call to those building micro-economies.\n\nIt’s evident that a creator middle class is emerging, and that there is now a clear path to create and capture value. While the tools exist, it’s up to us to write the playbook for the next million micro-economies.\n\nIf you’re working on micro-economies and are interested in sharing your ideas, please [reach out](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa).\n\nTogether, we’ll build the creator middle class into a force to be reckoned with.\n\nSpecial thanks to Li Jin for the feedback and to Carlos Gomes for the graphics!\n\n*If you liked this post, be sure to leave a tip.

We don’t want employees to feel locked in at Coinbase based on grants awarded 3 or 4 years prior. We want to earn our employees’ commitment every year and, likewise, expect them to earn their seat at Coinbase.\n\nWe operate in an open market for talent. We all know that.

The attention economy is booming, and people are becoming comfortable spending money on high quality digital media. Although the last several decades have seen us earning mostly as independent agents, people are increasingly joining forces to earn money together under shared group identities.\n\nThe challenge that we're facing is that the internet isn't built for group users. This means that everything that a group does, it does via its individual members who act on its behalf. In order for high levels of control to be placed in the hands of key individuals, these groups either need a high degree of structure or a high degree of trust for one another.\n\nFaced with this tradeoff, more and more people are choosing the latter— working with people they already trust, starting with their friends. Even the uncharted territory of mixing business and friendship seems to be an improvement over the stale bureaucratic structures of the last century, which clearly no longer reflect the way that we coordinate with one another. \n\nNonetheless, here is a guide to avoiding trouble when making money with friends online. We're far too early for this list to be exhaustive, but I hope it can be a useful starting point if you're thinking about diving into the deep end yourself.\n\n## 1. Respect People's Ideas \nThe best way to validate any idea is to talk about it with smart people that you already know — the friends of yours who hopefully know at least a little bit about your chosen domain. The idea stage is an extremely sensitive time in any project's formation, especially for the people doing the ideating. Naturally, things can get uncomfortable if individuals begin to use other peoples' insights from these conversations on their own. Sometimes this looks like explicitly stealing ideas, but more often it's much more indirect. \n\nUltimately 2 good rules of thumb here are:\n\n- if someone is using you as a sounding board for a new idea, err on the side of remaining an external voice, and don't assume your own inclusion in the project unless you're explicitly invited\n- if you're actively ideating, err on the side of under-sharing with people you don't fully trust not to cut you out of your own project\n\nComplications can arise as each new perspective molds an idea into being increasingly valuable, so it's important that ideas are valued, and that the people who come up with them are given fair credit.\n\n## 2. Set Expectations Early with a Friend-Prenup\nOnce it becomes clear that what you're building has the potential to be valuable, you should have a conversation to set up some formal structure to help enable the collaboration.\n\nSome some basic details think about are:\n\n- how are you splitting the ownership and money you'll earn together?\n- how are you accounting for costs that you might incur?\n- which decisions do each of you have a say over?\n- what is each person doing to earn their fair share?\n- what specific guidelines are needed based on your unique project domain?\n\nTo do this right, it's usually worth putting this in writing — emails are good, signed documents are even better. Although it may feel awkward at first, these agreements will eventually become the bedrock of your relationship, and will allow trust to more easily flourish between you all. The added benefit to doing this with explicit signatures is that it will force everyone to speak up early about what they think is fair, recognizing that it'll be much more difficult to change these details later on.\n\nThis process can sometimes get messy or uncomfortable, because of the subjective nature of valuing each other's work. In these negotiations, power is rarely distributed evenly between contributors, so arriving at a fair deal will usually require those with more power to be kind, and have foresight about the future of the project. The goal should be to retain this core team for a long time, **which means that the deal needs to be fair for everyone involved**. Importantly, the \"fairness\" of a given deal is highly subjective — a fair deal is one which participants *believe* is fair in perpetuity. If you find that this conversation gets stuck, it can also be useful to have impartial 3rd parties add their perspectives on market standards.\n\nOver time these agreements will be forced to evolve, usually in the direction of stability and legitimacy. That's why it's important to have an expectation of good-faith from all parties involved. **If you don't trust your friends to act in good faith, through good times or bad, then you probably shouldn't be trying to earn money together in this manner.**\n\n## 3. Be Open to Change\n\nAny fixed expectations that you have going into the endeavour will almost certainly have to evolve as the project responds to its environment. Unless people are willing to be cooperative and adjust based on what's fair for the group over time, your operations will end up grinding to a halt. **This is why it's important for everyone involved to understand the compounding effect of collaboration, so your focus can stay on growing the pie, instead of splitting it.**\n\nJames P. Carse talks about this in his book *Finite and Infinite Games*, where finite games are played to be won by individual players, while infinite games are played so that they may continue to be played — the game's self perpetuation being the shared goal among all players:\n\n> The rules of an infinite game must change in the course of play. The rules are changed when the players of an infinite game agree that the play is imperiled by a finite outcome — that is, by the victory of some players and the defeat of others. The rules of an infinite game are changed to prevent anyone from winning the game and to bring as many persons as possible into the play.\n\nIf the friends you want to work with believe that keeping people happy matters more than what they stand to gain from \"winning\" on each others' behalf, then these evolutions will be flawless. If however people are continuously stretching the fairness of the arrangement in their own favour, relationships will weaken and the trust that you started with will evaporate.\n\n## 4. Remember the Stakes\n\nOne of the things that's tricky about working with friends is that the stakes are much higher than in normal business situations. Working together, you will inevitibly face tradeoffs based on the way that responsibilities and value are split up. If members approach each moment remembering what they have to lose, they will avoid making the mistake of sacrificing a friendship or their reputation for a short-term gain.\n\nThis is a high risk/high reward environment, which if played right can allow you to move as a cohesive group with ease, responding to the world much faster than any individual or traditional organization could ever dream of. However, if played incorrectly, what's at stake is a history that is increasingly impossible to wipe clean.\n\n## 5. Stick To Your Word\n\nWhen doing business with friends, integrity is extremely important. Reputations matter, because the entire premise of the game is that the heightened trust between you enables new ways of making money together. This means that in these arrangements, one must care *even more* about their integrity than in traditional business engagements (which don't normally require such high degrees of trust between members).\nMy personal guideline here is to avoid ever making promises I can't keep, to follow through on all of the promises that I *do* make, and in situations where that's impossible, to approach people as early and often as I can to make sure everyone remains happy. By approaching situations with an honest positive intention, you'll find your friends will come through for you when you need them to. The absence of transparency will have the opposite effect though, and will leave your friends feeling taken advantage of. Staying proactive is key.\n\n## 6. Be Transparent\n\nAt the end of the day, the top requirement for friends to be able to make money together is being open with each other about all of the important details of the arrangement. Sharing information builds goodwill, and over time establishes trust as everyone sees that no one has anything to hide. This will become less and less necessary as your project matures, but early on a high level of transparency is a must. \n\nSome examples of important things which should actively be shared are:\n\n- any ways that members are benefiting from the arrangement (either directly or indirectly)\n- any conflicts of interest that members might have (because of activities they do outside of the arrangement)\n- any changes that might occur with each member's expected contributions\n\nYou should also aim to have a culture of regularly providing feedback to each other, remembering that constructive feedback should always be shared 1-1 first (to make sure no one ever feels unfairly called out). For that reason, it's important that everyone feels comfortable talking to each other directly, rather than just in group forums.\n\nUltimately, being transparent is most often characterized as not hiding things. Keeping important information to yourself is sketchy, mostly because doing so creates the conditions for people to take advantage of each other. If you want people to enjoy working with you, transparency is a must for making that happen.\n\n---\n\nAside from these formalities, it's important to find a healthy balance between seriousness and play. The whole power of the internet is that it gives us a freedom to experiment, to be silly, to make mistakes, and to support your friends while they do the same. Making the experience of working together itself enjoyable ensures that there's at least one benefit gained if the project doesn't outright succeed — you had fun with your friends!\n\nAs people continue to realize that they're tired of working with people they wouldn't be friends with, we're going to be forced to create new sets of rules to shape how we coordinate together more fluidly. If the last century's businesses were marked by bureaucracy and structure, the next century's will be built on trust and dynamic bonds between people— unlocking the latent human potential from leftover unfair deals.\n\n---\n\nSpecial thanks to [Jordan Kutzer](https://twitter.com/JordanKutzer), [Li Jin](https://twitter.com/ljin18), and [Arya Soltanieh](https://twitter.com/LostCod3r) for their help crafting this piece.", "timestamp": 1621008828, "digest": "HNRZ7nbcR-lMpmLfYLbNysDs8ubVXB3FTitMyF6dlNY", "contributor": "0xbfDb50Dc66C8Df9fd9688D8fe5A0C34126427645"}

Making the experience of working together itself enjoyable ensures that there's at least one benefit gained if the project doesn't outright succeed — you had fun with your friends!\n\nAs people continue to realize that they're tired of working with people they wouldn't be friends with, we're going to be forced to create new sets of rules to shape how we coordinate together more fluidly. If the last century's businesses were marked by bureaucracy and structure, the next century's will be built on trust and dynamic bonds between people— unlocking the latent human potential from leftover unfair deals.\n\n---\n\nSpecial thanks to [Jordan Kutzer](https://twitter.com/JordanKutzer), [Li Jin](https://twitter.com/ljin18), and [Arya Soltanieh](https://twitter.com/LostCod3r) for their help crafting this piece.", "timestamp": 1621009425, "digest": "HNRZ7nbcR-lMpmLfYLbNysDs8ubVXB3FTitMyF6dlNY", "contributor": "0xbfDb50Dc66C8Df9fd9688D8fe5A0C34126427645"}

What about mental health? Physical health? That overall feeling of underlying joy or systemic stress? These are all things that don’t show up with a ruler or scale but we know are important to be a whole, thriving person. \n\nTools for measuring self health are getting smarter. A friend recently gave me a home pee stick to try weekly, looking at things like cortisol and Vitamin C. There are devices and apps to track movement, sleep, food consumption, and more. While helpful, they are simply data points. Small pieces of a bigger picture of your health and wellbeing, which is something that you simply just know and feel in your heart and gut. It’s hard to quantify (and sometimes pointless trying) the things that you feel—the yin to your yang.\n\n### Communities are alive with two halves creating one whole\nCommunities, like humans, are things that live and breathe. They are never stagnant—always in a state of growth or decline. To be honest, this is much like [my tumor](https://tinyhealer.substack.com/p/coming-soon), and all living organisms for that matter.\n\nFor communities, our tools are even more rudimentary than for ourselves. Without the language, tools, and systems to look at the whole picture, we default to known entities around external growth, for example: new newsletter subscribers, Twitter followers, developers and increasing asset prices. \n\n(Note: While not yet widely adopted in crypto, [the Orbit Model](https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model) gets us part of the way there in that it unpacks some of the ways to understand and quantify community growth in novel and new ways.) \n\nExternal numbers are the benchmark for the Web3 world—they are also the benchmark for the stock market and a country’s economy (GDP). People who hold and buy crypto assets want to be able to quickly assess the winners from the losers. See which projects will likely fly “to the moon” and which will fall.\n\nMy yoga teacher once said, “you have to teach people how to treat you.” I believe that for crypto, there is an education gap in how we measure and assess a project’s viability, and thus it’s worthiness of our investment in terms of resources like time and financial capital.\n\nIs there a way we can find space in our awareness for both community health and community growth?\n\nThere is a lot we can learn from the self that we can apply to communities. I want to offer a framework that may begin to unpack how we look at community health, and thus measure the other half of a project’s worthiness.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/254e57b0-73a0-48bd-ab4d-c2bbfdd1a743.png?height=786&width=1432)\n\n\n### The concept of Yin and Yang\nYin and yang can be described as “the universe is governed by a cosmic duality, sets of two opposing and complementing principles or cosmic energies that can be observed in nature” ([source](https://www.thoughtco.com/yin-and-yang-629214)). It presents us with a reality in which complementary and interdependent forces live together in harmony.\n\nApplied here, Yin is life inside the community. The growth in things like social connections, play, mutual trust, and organic contributions, with which a health community can thrive and are hard to quantify. Yang is the counterpart that shows the results of a thriving, “sticky” community and can be shown in tracking things like marketing metrics. \n\nKeeping an eye on both community health and community growth will lead to sustainable, thriving projects.\n\n## The Wheel of Life as a tool for measuring community health\n[The Wheel of Life](https://coachcampus.com/resources/coaching-101/the-wheel-of-life/) is a tool from coaching and looks at the satisfaction one has with their own life. This reflection tool takes into account key verticals, which may be defined by the participant, that are important for a well-balanced and fulfilled life.\n\nI’ve adapted The Wheel of Life for community. On the first pass, I tried to tie metrics to each of these—to force some yang. However upon reflection, I recognized we need to honor it for what it is—a tool, a feeling, a ritual (and sometimes a metric) that community teams and organizers could use to decide where to place their focus and find alignment. \n\n### How to use the tool\nInstead of being overly prescriptive about how to measure each of these, I suggest filling it out in under 10 minutes, perhaps before each sprint or planning cycle. Rate each slide from 1 (low) to 10 (high) and then step back and look at what is out of balance; what needs tending to. Most community leaders will have a pulse on what’s happening and this tool could be a way to align priority and focus to community needs. Perhaps examples and stories from the community could contextualize this and bring it to life.\n\nIf you’re on the outside of a project, you could make your own assessment based on your interactions with the project and its participants.\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5407fcb9-3e1d-499f-a525-8151a0976e8e.jpg?height=1702&width=2220)\n\nOn the Wheel of Community, possible verticals could include:\n\n- **Fulfillment of a shared purpose**. For Celo, work and projects that align to the [Theory of Change](https://medium.com/celoorg/celos-theory-of-change-b916de44945d) and mission of prosperity for all.\n\n- **Organic contributions**. The virality, people referring others to the project or generating content without an explicit intent to “shill”. People building on Celo as self-starters (building something without initial funding). Github commits from independent developers.\n\n- **Ecosystem maturity**. Projects spinning out of other projects. Continued development in current projects.\n\n- **Sense of ownership**. Community members participate as owners of the community, including receiving member benefits and being able to meaningfully influence the project’s direction. Solutions built by people for the communities they are a part of (versus, for example, the Global North building for the Global South).\n\n- **Diversity**. Community member variety in terms of identities, backgrounds, geographies that make for a resilient community.\n\n- **Self-regulation**. Owners of CELO not only voting in governance proposals but participating in the discussions leading up to the vote. Information transparency is a precursor to this. Community enforces shared norms and values and weeds out toxic energy.\n\n- **Play & civility**. “Play as exploration without expectations”, Amy Jung :). Laughter, friendly jokes, memes. New creative use cases being developed on Celo. The sense of psychological safety, respectful disagreement, lack of trolls.\n\n- **Social connections**. New members making connections, working together, and helping each other. Organic social events and new rituals. Community members helping one another in public / private forums.\n\n- **Asset velocity**. Celo Dollars and Celo Euros being spent, shared; the movement of money.\n\n- **Asset distribution**. Distribution of the CELO native asset across individuals and geographies.\n\n## How would you assess the health of your community?\nI hope this framework and concepts provide a new, more holistic way to think about your community-building efforts.

{"id": "xtlibszJbGYlEh2HbtDD0kYbopKAlXtJDD7Ph-9mTkg", "title": "The journey to releasing my first NFT", "body": "After more than 7 months of checking out the Web3 (crypto) space — reading on how blockchain tech works, and projects being made here and there — I recently minted my first NFT.\n\n***Note:** Everything mentioned here are my experiences in the Ethereum blockchain. Always remember to check whether the wallet and the platform you're minting on are on the same blockchain network.*\n\n-----\n\n### How did I find out about NFTs, Web3, and stuff\nBefore I share how I got to mint my first NFT, let me share how the fuck did I get in to this wild world of crypto and Web3.\n\nI don't recall exactly how, but I'm sure it's because of how [**RAC**](https://twitter.com/rac) — a Grammy-award winning producer — has back-to-back projects happening in the space. I think this was around October 2020, but I'd like to assume I've heard of these even earlier.\n\nFrom NFTs, the super wild [**$TAPE**](https://zora.co/rac/tape) project — a token representing a physical cassette tape, — to issuing his own social token, [**$RAC**](https://blog.ourzora.com/introducing-rac), where token holders can have access to a private area in his Discord server, get discounts to merch, or even get to interact with him more.\n\nI also was introduced to Audius because of one stream he did on Twitch! [**Audius**](https://audius.co/feed) is like Soundcloud, except you (the artist) have a say on what happens to the platform. You want to have a subscription feature? Vote using the tokens given to you every time you post! **The platform's future is in the artists' hands.**\n\nAll these projects were so fascinating to see. With more focus on NFTs, the mere fact that digital artists can make a living out of JUST doing things digitally is amazing to me. No need to print your digital works as stickers, prints, posters, etc. Blockchain technology made it possible for one specific file to be called THE official one. Because of that, all the other copies scattered around the internet, and the ones to be made by saving a copy of the same file, are worthless. **The original file gets value.**\n\n### How I was able to mint my first NFT\n\nMinting (*making*) an NFT can cost around US$40-$100 in gas (*transaction*) fees on a good day, and a disgusting $400-$800 on a bad one (although why would you mint during a bad day, lol). Gas fees don’t go to the platform, but rather the people running the whole Ethereum network.\n\nIn the Philippines, $40 is already 10+% of what an entry level employee is making monthly, while $100 is like 1/3 of the same salary. **Anyway, bottomline, it's just so fucking expensive for people here.**\n\n![Sees how much I need to mint an NFT](https://media.giphy.com/media/Y4JE51QwzefMLfknfq/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\nI honestly considered saving up for a mint fund, in hopes that I can get my money back and more. That doesn't mean I'm just here for the money. I'm also here for people to validate that my work has value, maybe even greater than what I would've expected.\n\nPosting on Instagram and Twitter, getting likes for my posts, and I can't make a living out of it because all the money goes to the platforms?! **I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THIS LOGIC AFTER KNOWING ABOUT NFTs.** Did I mention that if your NFT is resold in the secondary market, you get a cut of the resale???!!!\n\nThen, while I was looking around the Creator x Crypto side of Twitter, I discovered Mint Fund.\n\n[**Mint Fund**](https://twitter.com/themintfund) is a community project that helps artists in being able to mint their first NFT by giving a grant that's enough to cover for gas fees. **They prioritize funds to BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ artists especially outside North America and Europe.** They are also working on great projects for the space like making a crowdfund for an open-source protocol.\n\nI signed up for the grant a week after they launched, but sadly didn't get in the first batch. It just meant that I was still on the waitlist! I got an email around mid or late April saying that I got in the second batch. GURL, I WAS SHOOKT. I SAW THE EMAIL WHEN I WOKE UP. Now THAT's how you start a good day!\n\n![Walking out of my bedroom after seeing the email](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT1R9ZbWoZgo0leM5G/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\n***Side Note:** For artists in South East Asia, you might also want to apply at [**First Mint Fund**](https://twitter.com/firstmintfund)! It's another community project giving grants to artists so that they can mint their first NFT.*\n\n### Minting process\n\nY'all... minting an NFT is ***EASY AS FUUUUUUUCK.*** Uploaded the file, entered some details, clicked \"Proceed\", set up a price, and I'm done. No complicated shit!\n\nBut if you're starting from nowhere, you should get an Ethereum wallet (like [**Metamask**](https://metamask.io/)) first, AND WRITE THAT SEED PHRASE DOWN (YES, THE 12 RANDOM WORDS). The seed phrase is like the ultimate password. Lose it, lose everything in your wallet.\n\nNow with that wallet, you can start connecting it to platforms like Zora, Rarible, Foundation, and more. If the platform is open to the public to mint on it, then go ahead!\n\nFor NFT platforms on the Tezos blockchain, like *hic et nunc* and Kalamint, I think Temple is one of the most used wallets there.\n\nAgain, EZ SHIT! But I do understand that it can get, or it looks overwhelming. If that's the case, just shoot me a DM on Twitter ([**@belgiangwaffles**](https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles))! I'll be happy to help you out. 😊\n\n### And here it is...\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3003)\n\nI'll be posting soon what the piece is about.\n*But for now... you might wanna... you know... make a bid or sumn...* 🥺👉👈\n\n### Zora as my chosen platform\n\nI chose [**Zora**](https://zora.co/) as the platform where I'll mint my first NFT for various reasons.\n- I feel like it's not as saturated as other open platforms.\n- They don't get a cut from my sale.\n- I have the option to not have a timed auction being started when somebody bids with my asking price.\n\n    I just feel like that it hypes the price more than the artwork itself, which I don't want to be the case. Also, I want to be able to pick who gets my piece, and not just someone because it was automated. The owner is as important as the piece, IMO.\n\n- Also, from my understanding, I can sell the same NFT on other platforms with the creator share still attached to it, so I am not stuck with Zora.\n\n    I have to verify if I understood this correctly. 💀\n\n- Lastly, I don't want to set my asking price with ETH. Speaking of...\n\n### Fun Fact: I'm not selling it for money.\n\n~~Now this, I think, is what the locals don't know, especially the outsiders hating on all of this, lmao.~~ Depending on where you mint your NFT, you can choose to sell your works NOT for money — ETH, or stablecoins (crypto that will forever be worth $1) like DAI or USDT — but for social tokens.\n\n![Yes. I'm not asking for money.](https://media.giphy.com/media/SXeezvYc8uRUc/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\nRemember the $RAC token I was talking about earlier? I'm asking for something like that.\n\nIt's like exchanging a print, postcard, painting, whatever, for access to someone's Netflix account for a period of time, or live in the buyer's house for a month. Sure, these things have monetary value, and so does social tokens, but I'm not interested in that.\n\nMy asking price is **60 $FWB** ([**Friends with Benefits**](https://fwb.help/)) which is enough for me to enter the FWB Discord server and apply to be a member. The membership, for me, is a way to widen my network especially with fellow creators in the crypto space. I want to get to know more people, see what kind of crazy projects they're up to, learn from them, exchange ideas, and maybe just chill with them as well. That's what I wish to get in exchange for my NFT.\n\nActually, you can swap your crypto to FWB. My asking price could've been the ETH or DAI equivalent of 60 FWB, but I think that's an easier route. For me, it means way more if someone from FWB sees my work and actually bids on it with their FWB tokens. It's like a cosign from a member, **legitimizing that I SHOULD be with them.**\n\n### What's next?\n\n~~Win the fuckin’ $WRITE Race!!!~~\n\nMy next goal is to join a social token community or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)! I want to know how these things work in a member's perspective, especially if I have a say on the governance of the community or organization.\n\nTHE MONEY SIDE OF CRYPTO IS TOO BORING FOR ME. The People side of crypto is where the fun is all at.\n\nI already got some $FF by [**Forefront**](https://forefront.market/). So I think I'm about to experience some of that soon.\n\nBut for now, let's **#GetGianInFWB** LMAOOOOOOO. (Yeah, tweet that hashtag.)\n## 😂 😂 💀 💀\n\n[](https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles/status/1392969582449598465?s=20)\n\n*Me when I got access to Mirror's member-only Discord...*\n\nBTW, huge thank you to [**Jackson Dame**](https://dame.mirror.xyz/) who edited my work.

Into hospitals which are so expensive that it's cheaper to die. Into lawyers who charged so much, it's cheaper to plead guilty...Born into this, walking and living through this—dying because of this.\"\n*[Charles Bukowski — Dinosauria, We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDiLfQUBnyA)*\n\nIf I think about my own community, as a Black American, our traditions are mostly oral being barred from reading or writing for over 200 years in American history. While we since have developed the most global cultural zeitgeist through literature, music, language, and other cultural markers that document our experiences, for a long time, we were the property of America. Undocumented human labor dying en masse for the benefits of the estranged Britons, and subject to the experimentation of bizarre proportions under other European countries. To be Black is to live in a transient truth; unknowing of our past selves and thrust in a world built from our backs we cannot claim nor own as our own. \n\nUntil today.\n\nI had the pleasure of being [interviewed by George Howard](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgehoward/2021/04/30/creative-immortality-ameer-carters-mint-fund-helps-bipoc-and-lgbtqia-creators-mint-their-first-nfts/?sh=2bac2bb94fa6), a passionate writer, educator, and lawyer who preaches “purpose not product” in a post in Forbes about [Mint Fund](https://themint.fund). We talked at length about black culture and the exploitation we’ve endured for centuries. One of his points stood out to me:\n\n\n> *“This is something so near and dear to me...Black culture has had their voices silenced, their art appropriated by white people, with no or little-to-no credit, and certainly no financial benefit. You know for me the thing that absolutely destroys me is the South Bronx, in the late seventies, and DJ Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash actually taking Rock’n’Roll records — which were obviously built upon Black people’s rhythms — and Grandmaster Flash pulling the record backwards. To me, that was the gesture of reclamation. But even to this day, people kind of know Grandmaster Flash, but nobody knows Kool Herc, right? But everyone knows Eminem. Again, all props to Eminem, but this is why [Blockchain tech, social tokens, NFTs are] interesting to me: **The provenance of creation, and particularly as it resonates to the actual creators.** Not the rent seekers, not the people who just steal the ideas.”*\n\n\nThe provenance of creation. Tracking value to and from the source transparently. Or what I like to call, “Creative Immortality”. With the advent of decentralized applications, **we have the opportunity to build a framework of perpetual wealth redistribution through attribution, patronage, community, and culture capital.** \n\nAs a participant in this space, my goal is to activate and engage Black Culture into crypto. To document and record our cultural past, and build our cultural future at the same time. In order to achieve that level of creative immortality, we need to be able to reconcile with the things we’ve already made. It doesn’t necessarily mean it has to be in the same form of an NFT, but it does mean that we should have all of our references available and easily accessible. I am reminded of institutions like our HBCUs that are constantly fighting for resources to preserve and teach our history. Or institutions like Yale or the MOMA who have profited from us without retribution. \n\nHow much of our work has been purchased over the years that has never seen the light of day? That has never been exhibited before, that hasn’t been intellectualized, that doesn't have the type of attention or appeal that centralized institutions are looking for.

While we since have developed the most global cultural zeitgeist through literature, music, language, and other cultural markers that document our experiences, for a long time, we were the property of America. Undocumented human labor dying en masse for the benefits of the estranged Britons, and subject to the experimentation of bizarre proportions under other European countries. To be Black is to live in a transient truth; unknowing of our past selves and thrust in a world built from our backs we cannot claim nor own as our own. \n\nUntil today.\n\nI had the pleasure of being [interviewed by George Howard](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgehoward/2021/04/30/creative-immortality-ameer-carters-mint-fund-helps-bipoc-and-lgbtqia-creators-mint-their-first-nfts/?sh=2bac2bb94fa6), a passionate writer, educator, and lawyer who preaches “purpose not product” in a post in Forbes about [Mint Fund](https://themint.fund). We talked at length about black culture and the exploitation we’ve endured for centuries. One of his points stood out to me:\n\n\n> *“This is something so near and dear to me...Black culture has had their voices silenced, their art appropriated by white people, with no or little-to-no credit, and certainly no financial benefit. You know for me the thing that absolutely destroys me is the South Bronx, in the late seventies, and DJ Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash actually taking Rock’n’Roll records — which were obviously built upon Black people’s rhythms — and Grandmaster Flash pulling the record backwards. To me, that was the gesture of reclamation. But even to this day, people kind of know Grandmaster Flash, but nobody knows Kool Herc, right? But everyone knows Eminem. Again, all props to Eminem, but this is why [Blockchain tech, social tokens, NFTs are] interesting to me: **The provenance of creation, and particularly as it resonates to the actual creators.** Not the rent seekers, not the people who just steal the ideas.”*\n\n\nThe provenance of creation. Tracking value to and from the source transparently. Or what I like to call, “Creative Immortality”. With the advent of decentralized applications, **we have the opportunity to build a framework of perpetual wealth redistribution through attribution, patronage, community to build and sustain our culture capital.** \n\nAs a participant in this space, my goal is to activate and engage Black Culture into crypto. To document and record our cultural past, and build our cultural future at the same time. In order to achieve that level of creative immortality, we need to be able to reconcile with the things we’ve already made. It doesn’t necessarily mean it has to be in the same form of an NFT, but it does mean that we should have all of our references available and easily accessible. I am reminded of institutions like our HBCUs that are constantly fighting for resources to preserve and teach our history. Or institutions like Yale or the MOMA who have profited from us without retribution. \n\nHow much of our work has been purchased over the years that has never seen the light of day? That has never been exhibited before, that hasn’t been intellectualized, that doesn't have the type of attention or appeal that centralized institutions are looking for.

soft launch a mirror.xyz community publishing channel for Uniswap on mirror\n\n> - create a place for community members to get a spotlight and get paid for their creative works\n\n> - make governance fun and interesting\n\nright now, much of this process is active research but we will be building prototypes soon, here is very rough mockup\n\nUniversal Editions / Clout Universe / _TBD_ \n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8bd350e7-0f5a-4d52-9319-1a3f28ae5172.png?height=1566&width=1096)\n\n\n\nthe concept is that curators get to vote in a [write race](https://mirror.xyz/race) type format but for their own publications or posts, the process is entirely open to the public\n\nthere is a set time period between each curator/community vote, and authors are encouraged to submit whatever they want (or respond to themes and prompts)\n\nfor simplicity, the user experience could feel as easy as writing a blog on medium or posting photos to instagram, or even just embedding a collection of tweets with some opinions\n\nsimilar to mirror, but simpler, to encourage ease of use for everyone and to not burden mirror's small team with thousands of new users lol\n\neach post could scale up to be large as a collaborative zine where editorial art is commissioned NFTs, embedded playlists of songs from [zora](https://zora.co/) or [catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/) or something as incredibly connected and layered as [Ezzzra's](https://twitter.com/ezzzrrra?lang=en) recent [Solvency](https://ezra.mirror.xyz/)\n\nit would be amazing to enable independent squads work to create these and be able to use [splits](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw) to divide up the bounty\n\nit would be equally cool if this initial block could help us prototype the future [community blog](https://uniswap.org/blog/) for Uniswap.\n\npersonally my experience with FWB and even the Uniswap have really solidified how tokens and incentives can really motivate people curiosity and create some structure in a very limitless space\n\nif somewhat successful, other crypto ecosystems seeking community hubs could spin up their own versions using this mirror block\n\nI see direct parallels to this with many current DAOs and recently with the work zora is doing here with *Auction House*\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1392491120937086979?s=20\n\n\nas a designer and a researcher i see massive potential and a a surplus of available funding in this space (apply!)\n\ni believe a good spend of these treasuries could be more human centered experiments, more public goods, more use cases\n\ni am interested in building ideas that reach people who may not understand the basics of crypto at all, or may be scared to explore a realm that feels \"sketchy\" or unfamiliar to them\n\nif you like any of this, plz let me know (buy my NFT) or if you have any conceptual feedback (or have a good name for the community hub) - please hmu!\n\n[the weird headline is a reference to this](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/6QHwPO4q4grNtA)\n\nthis blog post is what i would consider a \"throw-away\" but you have to start somewhere \n\n✲\n\n:^)\n\ntalk soon\n\n✌️\n\nCM", "timestamp": 1621039455, "digest": "IuJ1MpoYggEK1XkyLTuEsHpHMQaYjK0EERlQhUYT2W0", "contributor": "0x224e69025A2f705C8f31EFB6694398f8Fd09ac5C"}

Micah Johnson's first Aku drop on Nifty Gateway, and the DAO Clash to acquire the work of Ix_Shells x TOR collaboration are the ONLY examples of black artists in the space (notwithstanding celebrities) that have had their works sold for over $1mm. \n\nThat's two fingers. The other 8? \n\n- (50 ETH)* $77.7k high for Carlos Marcial;\n- (22 ETH) $55k high for Cory Van Lew; \n- (11 ETH) $44k high for Osinachi;\n- (10 ETH) $28k high for DIGITAL + Mighty33; \n- (4 ETH) $16.4k high for Yatreda;\n- (9.7 ETH) $16.1k high for Blacksneakers; \n- (4 ETH) $11.6k high for Yosnier;\n- (2.68 ETH) $11.1k high for Latasha (collab);\n\n\nNow if we take these 10 artists out of the equation, for black artists, **our average HIGH ETH sale is roughly 1.79 ETH.**** \n\nThat sucks. \n\nEven if these artists manage to hodl their assets for as long as they can, as the cost of ETH rises, their holdings do not rise at the same rate making it increasingly harder for us to participate in other projects.

While we have this \"early access\" to crypto, we must work toward broader redistribution of assets to prevent the same issues that plague us: income disparity, low wealth accrual, lack of access to funding, etc.\n\n---\n\n### Archivism—Defining Ethical Digital Archeology + Cultural Preservation\n\nWe are at an inflection point in the digital art age where the same mistakes in traditional institutions are being made in cryptospaces:\n\nCultural erasure. \n\nThere’s this push and pull between folks who are really about the provenance of the blockchain versus folks who are wanting to predispose themselves as first because they have more visibility.\n\nBlack artists like Connie Digital, Harrison First and others who were some of the first people to institute social tokens for their fans on the blockchain. Unfortunately, after the release of 3LAU's album, media articles were declaring he’s the first to sell an album. And without pause, had done the same for Kings of Leon (which they've since corrected to 'first band' but how accurate is that really?) And it’s not true. At all. But what has continued to contribute to erasing us has been the attention around that sale, becoming the formative marker as being first because it’s the one that’s made the most noise (and most $$$). I find it interesting because the blockchain doesn't lie—we can literally go back tangibly, and there’s verifiable hash proof that none of those works are first. Frustratingly, it's also hard to go back further than 2017 because the NFT standard contract ERC-721 wasn't invented prior to the launch of CryptoPunks.

Into hospitals which are so expensive that it's cheaper to die. Into lawyers who charged so much, it's cheaper to plead guilty...Born into this, walking and living through this—dying because of this.\"\n*[Charles Bukowski — Dinosauria, We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDiLfQUBnyA)*\n\nIf I think about my own community, as a Black American, our traditions are mostly oral being barred from reading or writing for over 200 years in American history. While we since have developed the most global cultural zeitgeist through literature, music, language, and other cultural markers that document our experiences, for a long time, we were the property of America. Undocumented human labor dying en masse for the benefits of the estranged Britons, and subject to the experimentation of bizarre proportions under other European countries. To be Black is to live in a transient truth; unknowing of our past selves and thrust in a world built from our backs we cannot claim nor own as our own. \n\nUntil today.\n\nI had the pleasure of being [interviewed by George Howard](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgehoward/2021/04/30/creative-immortality-ameer-carters-mint-fund-helps-bipoc-and-lgbtqia-creators-mint-their-first-nfts/?sh=2bac2bb94fa6), a passionate writer, educator, and lawyer who preaches “purpose not product” in a post in Forbes about [Mint Fund](https://themint.fund). We talked at length about black culture and the exploitation we’ve endured for centuries. \n\n\n> *“This is something so near and dear to me...Black culture has had their voices silenced, their art appropriated by white people, with no or little-to-no credit, and certainly no financial benefit. You know for me the thing that absolutely destroys me is the South Bronx, in the late seventies, and DJ Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash actually taking Rock’n’Roll records — which were obviously built upon Black people’s rhythms — and Grandmaster Flash pulling the record backwards. To me, that was the gesture of reclamation. But even to this day, people kind of know Grandmaster Flash, but nobody knows Kool Herc, right? But everyone knows Eminem. Again, all props to Eminem, but this is why [Blockchain tech, social tokens, NFTs are] interesting to me: **The provenance of creation, and particularly as it resonates to the actual creators.** Not the rent seekers, not the people who just steal the ideas.”*\n\n\nThe provenance of creation. Tracking value to and from the source transparently. Or what I like to call, “Creative Immortality”. With the advent of decentralized applications, **we have the opportunity to build a framework of perpetual wealth redistribution through attribution, patronage, community to build and sustain our culture capital.** \n\nAs a participant in this space, my goal is to activate and engage Black Culture in crypto to document and record our past, and build our future simultaneously. In order to achieve creative immortality, we need to be able to reconcile with the things we’ve already made. It doesn’t necessarily mean it has to be in the same form of an NFT, but it does mean that we should have all of our references available and easily accessible. I am reminded of institutions like our HBCUs that are constantly fighting for resources to preserve and teach our history. Or institutions like Yale or the MOMA who have profited from us without retribution. \n\nHow much of our work has been purchased over the years that has never seen the light of day? That has never been exhibited before, that hasn’t been intellectualized, that doesn't have the type of attention or appeal that centralized institutions are looking for. What if the artists of our past could have flourished had we seen ourselves in those galleries, publicly supported, and paid equitably?\n\nCrypto can enable that level of patronage at scale, if we anchor ourselves to act inclusively. \n\n\n---\n\n### “Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow/ It's a number game, but shit don't add up somehow/ Like I got, sixteen to thirty-two bars to rock it/ But only 15% of profits, ever see my pockets like—” \n*[Mos Def, Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ir-zFC9nFE)*\n\n\nLet's face it: Out of the the $MM that have touched the hands of NFT artists, cultural communities can count on their fingers the amount of artists that have seen any significant portion of that. Micah Johnson's first Aku drop on Nifty Gateway, and the DAO Clash to acquire the work of Ix_Shells x TOR collaboration are the ONLY examples of black artists in the space (notwithstanding celebrities) that have had their works sold for over $1mm. \n\nThat's two fingers. The other 8? \n\n- (50 ETH)* $77.7k high for Carlos Marcial;\n- (22 ETH) $55k high for Cory Van Lew; \n- (11 ETH) $44k high for Osinachi;\n- (10 ETH) $28k high for DIGITAL + Mighty33; \n- (4 ETH) $16.4k high for Yatreda;\n- (9.7 ETH) $16.1k high for Blacksneakers; \n- (4 ETH) $11.6k high for Yosnier;\n- (2.68 ETH) $11.1k high for Latasha (collab);\n\n\nNow if we take these 10 artists out of the equation, for black artists, **our average HIGH ETH sale is roughly 1.79 ETH.**** \n\nThat sucks. \n\nEven if these artists manage to hodl their assets for as long as they can, as the cost of ETH rises, their holdings do not rise at the same rate making it increasingly harder for us to participate in other projects. Perhaps this speaks to a larger issue about ETH becoming more of a store of value than token to be exchanged—but ultimately, the disparity of asset accrual is not foreign to the black experience. While we have this \"early access\" to crypto, we must work toward broader redistribution of assets to prevent the same issues that plague us: income disparity, low wealth accrual, lack of access to funding, etc.\n\n>> Mention MintFund + other grants\n>> Mention SyndicateDAO + DAO groups \n\n---\n\n### Archivism—Defining Ethical Digital Archeology + Cultural Preservation\n\nWe are at an inflection point in the digital art age where the same mistakes in traditional institutions are being made in cryptospaces:\n\nCultural erasure. \n\nThere’s this push and pull between folks who are really about the provenance of the blockchain versus folks who are wanting to predispose themselves as first because they have more visibility.\n\nBlack artists like Connie Digital, Harrison First and others who were some of the first people to institute social tokens for their fans on the blockchain. Unfortunately, after the release of 3LAU's album, media articles were declaring he’s the first to sell an album. And without pause, had done the same for Kings of Leon (which they've since corrected to 'first band' but how accurate is that really?) And it’s not true. At all. But what has continued to contribute to erasing us has been the attention around that sale, becoming the formative marker as being first because it’s the one that’s made the most noise (and most $$$). I find it interesting because the blockchain doesn't lie—we can literally go back tangibly, and there’s verifiable hash proof that none of those works are first. Frustratingly, it's also hard to go back further than 2017 because the NFT standard contract ERC-721 wasn't invented prior to the launch of CryptoPunks. So unless you have already documented this work (largely being part of the scene pre-ICOs), you wouldn't even know what to look for.\n\nRelated to this, the convo with @boop  (reference MoonCats)\n\nWe need to instill ethics in our works, projects, and practices.

{"id": "SMj7SBfWKvL6TbXJj9GuTL-Nj2RCCEubZwuyBH35HA8", "title": "The journey to releasing my first NFT", "body": "After more than 7 months of checking out the Web3 (crypto) space — reading on how blockchain tech works, and projects being made here and there — I recently minted my first NFT.\n\n***Note:** Everything mentioned here are my experiences in the Ethereum blockchain. Always remember to check whether the wallet and the platform you're minting on are on the same blockchain network.*\n\n-----\n\n### How did I find out about NFTs, Web3, and stuff\nBefore I share how I got to mint my first NFT, let me share how the fuck did I get in to this wild world of crypto and Web3.\n\nI don't recall exactly how, but I'm sure it's because of how [**RAC**](https://twitter.com/rac) — a Grammy-award winning producer — has back-to-back projects happening in the space. I think this was around October 2020, but I'd like to assume I've heard of these even earlier.\n\nFrom NFTs, the super wild [**$TAPE**](https://zora.co/rac/tape) project — a token representing a physical cassette tape, — to issuing his own social token, [**$RAC**](https://blog.ourzora.com/introducing-rac), where token holders can have access to a private area in his Discord server, get discounts to merch, or even get to interact with him more.\n\nI also was introduced to Audius because of one stream he did on Twitch! [**Audius**](https://audius.co/feed) is like Soundcloud, except you (the artist) have a say on what happens to the platform. You want to have a subscription feature? Vote using the tokens given to you every time you post! **The platform's future is in the artists' hands.**\n\nAll these projects were so fascinating to see. With more focus on NFTs, the mere fact that digital artists can make a living out of JUST doing things digitally is amazing to me. No need to print your digital works as stickers, prints, posters, etc. Blockchain technology made it possible for one specific file to be called THE official one. Because of that, all the other copies scattered around the internet, and the ones to be made by saving a copy of the same file, are worthless. **The original file gets value.**\n\n### How I was able to mint my first NFT\n\nMinting (*making*) an NFT can cost around US$40-$100 in gas (*transaction*) fees on a good day, and a disgusting $400-$800 on a bad one (although why would you mint during a bad day, lol). Gas fees don’t go to the platform, but rather the people running the whole Ethereum network.\n\nIn the Philippines, $40 is already 10+% of what an entry level employee is making monthly, while $100 is like 1/3 of the same salary. **Anyway, bottomline, it's just so fucking expensive for people here.**\n\n![Sees how much I need to mint an NFT](https://media.giphy.com/media/Y4JE51QwzefMLfknfq/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\nI honestly considered saving up for a mint fund, in hopes that I can get my money back and more. That doesn't mean I'm just here for the money. I'm also here for people to validate that my work has value, maybe even greater than what I would've expected.\n\nPosting on Instagram and Twitter, getting likes for my posts, and I can't make a living out of it because all the money goes to the platforms?! **I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THIS LOGIC AFTER KNOWING ABOUT NFTs.** Did I mention that if your NFT is resold in the secondary market, you get a cut of the resale???!!!\n\nThen, while I was looking around the Creator x Crypto side of Twitter, I discovered Mint Fund.\n\n[**Mint Fund**](https://twitter.com/themintfund) is a community project that helps artists in being able to mint their first NFT by giving a grant that's enough to cover for gas fees. **They prioritize funds to BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ artists especially outside North America and Europe.** They are also working on great projects for the space like making a crowdfund for an open-source protocol.\n\nI signed up for the grant a week after they launched, but sadly didn't get in the first batch. It just meant that I was still on the waitlist! I got an email around mid or late April saying that I got in the second batch. GURL, I WAS SHOOKT. I SAW THE EMAIL WHEN I WOKE UP. Now THAT's how you start a good day!\n\n![Walking out of my bedroom after seeing the email](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT1R9ZbWoZgo0leM5G/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\n***Side Note:** For artists in South East Asia, you might also want to apply at [**First Mint Fund**](https://twitter.com/firstmintfund)! It's another community project giving grants to artists so that they can mint their first NFT.*\n\n### Minting process\n\nY'all... minting an NFT is ***EASY AS FUUUUUUUCK.*** Uploaded the file, entered some details, clicked \"Proceed\", set up a price, and I'm done. No complicated shit!\n\nBut if you're starting from nowhere, you should get an Ethereum wallet (like [**Metamask**](https://metamask.io/)) first, AND WRITE THAT SEED PHRASE DOWN (YES, THE 12 RANDOM WORDS). The seed phrase is like the ultimate password. Lose it, lose everything in your wallet.\n\nNow with that wallet, you can start connecting it to platforms like Zora, Rarible, Foundation, and more. If the platform is open to the public to mint on it, then go ahead!\n\nFor NFT platforms on the Tezos blockchain, like *hic et nunc* and Kalamint, I think Temple is one of the most used wallets there.\n\nAgain, EZ SHIT! But I do understand that it can get, or it looks overwhelming. If that's the case, just shoot me a DM on Twitter ([**@belgiangwaffles**](https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles))!

{"id": "InJfeFgznnYuC_Phy8ib_r0Ar6YMFaSi9pgOFL5gpdM", "title": "The journey to releasing my first NFT", "body": "After more than 7 months of checking out the Web3 (crypto) space — reading on how blockchain tech works, and projects being made here and there — I recently minted my first NFT.\n\n***Note:** Everything mentioned here are my experiences in the Ethereum blockchain. Always remember to check whether the wallet and the platform you're minting on are on the same blockchain network.*\n\n-----\n\n### How did I find out about NFTs, Web3, and stuff\nBefore I share how I got to mint my first NFT, let me share how the fuck did I get in to this wild world of crypto and Web3.\n\nI don't recall exactly how, but I'm sure it's because of how [**RAC**](https://twitter.com/rac) — a Grammy-award winning producer — has back-to-back projects happening in the space. I think this was around October 2020, but I'd like to assume I've heard of these even earlier.\n\nFrom NFTs, the super wild [**$TAPE**](https://zora.co/rac/tape) project — a token representing a physical cassette tape, — to issuing his own social token, [**$RAC**](https://blog.ourzora.com/introducing-rac), where token holders can have access to a private area in his Discord server, get discounts to merch, or even get to interact with him more.\n\nI also was introduced to Audius because of one stream he did on Twitch! [**Audius**](https://audius.co/feed) is like Soundcloud, except you (the artist) have a say on what happens to the platform. You want to have a subscription feature? Vote using the tokens given to you every time you post! **The platform's future is in the artists' hands.**\n\nAll these projects were so fascinating to see. With more focus on NFTs, the mere fact that digital artists can make a living out of JUST doing things digitally is amazing to me. No need to print your digital works as stickers, prints, posters, etc. Blockchain technology made it possible for one specific file to be called THE official one. Because of that, all the other copies scattered around the internet, and the ones to be made by saving a copy of the same file, are worthless. **The original file gets value.**\n\n### How I was able to mint my first NFT\n\nMinting (*making*) an NFT can cost around US$40-$100 in gas (*transaction*) fees on a good day, and a disgusting $400-$800 on a bad one (although why would you mint during a bad day, lol). Gas fees don’t go to the platform, but rather the people running the whole Ethereum network.\n\nIn the Philippines, $40 is already 10+% of what an entry level employee is making monthly, while $100 is like 1/3 of the same salary. **Anyway, bottomline, it's just so fucking expensive for people here.**\n\n![Sees how much I need to mint an NFT](https://media.giphy.com/media/Y4JE51QwzefMLfknfq/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\nI honestly considered saving up for a mint fund, in hopes that I can get my money back and more. That doesn't mean I'm just here for the money. I'm also here for people to validate that my work has value, maybe even greater than what I would've expected.\n\nPosting on Instagram and Twitter, getting likes for my posts, and I can't make a living out of it because all the money goes to the platforms?! **I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THIS LOGIC AFTER KNOWING ABOUT NFTs.** Did I mention that if your NFT is resold in the secondary market, you get a cut of the resale???!!!\n\nThen, while I was looking around the Creator x Crypto side of Twitter, I discovered Mint Fund.\n\n[**Mint Fund**](https://twitter.com/themintfund) is a community project that helps artists in being able to mint their first NFT by giving a grant that's enough to cover for gas fees. **They prioritize funds to BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ artists especially outside North America and Europe.** They are also working on great projects for the space like making a crowdfund for an open-source protocol.\n\nI signed up for the grant a week after they launched, but sadly didn't get in the first batch. It just meant that I was still on the waitlist! I got an email around mid or late April saying that I got in the second batch. GURL, I WAS SHOOKT. I SAW THE EMAIL WHEN I WOKE UP. Now THAT's how you start a good day!\n\n![Walking out of my bedroom after seeing the email](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT1R9ZbWoZgo0leM5G/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\n***Side Note:** For artists in South East Asia, you might also want to apply at [**First Mint Fund**](https://twitter.com/firstmintfund)! It's another community project giving grants to artists so that they can mint their first NFT.*\n\n### Minting process\n\nY'all... minting an NFT is ***EASY AS FUUUUUUUCK.*** Uploaded the file, entered some details, clicked \"Proceed\", set up a price, and I'm done. No complicated shit!\n\nBut if you're starting from nowhere, you should get an Ethereum wallet (like [**Metamask**](https://metamask.io/)) first, AND WRITE THAT SEED PHRASE DOWN (YES, THE 12 RANDOM WORDS). The seed phrase is like the ultimate password. Lose it, lose everything in your wallet.\n\nNow with that wallet, you can start connecting it to platforms like Zora, Rarible, Foundation, and more. If the platform is open to the public to mint on it, then go ahead!\n\nFor NFT platforms on the Tezos blockchain, like *hic et nunc* and Kalamint, I think Temple is one of the most used wallets there.\n\nAgain, EZ SHIT! But I do understand that it can get, or it looks overwhelming. If that's the case, just shoot me a DM on Twitter ([**@belgiangwaffles**](https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles))! I'll be happy to help you out. 😊\n\n### And here it is...\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3003)\n\nI'll be posting soon what the piece is about.\n*But for now... you might wanna... you know... make a bid or sumn...* 🥺👉👈\n\n### Zora as my chosen platform\n\nI chose [**Zora**](https://zora.co/) as the platform where I'll mint my first NFT for various reasons.\n- I feel like it's not as saturated as other open platforms.\n- They don't get a cut from my sale.\n- I have the option to not have a timed auction being started when somebody bids with my asking price.\n\n    I just feel like that it hypes the price more than the artwork itself, which I don't want to be the case.

{"id": "DzbzvdifxnWTVDYZR-C_NHF6aXs8LJkVUyjUVLx6WtI", "title": "INTERIOR 1", "body": "When was the first time you can remember being transported somewhere by a piece of art?\n\nThis November, I’ll be releasing my eighth full length record, called Interior, and it’s about this very thing.\n\nI have this memory of lying on a hotel bed in this tiny town in Saskatchewan, Canada. I was sixteen, tagging along with my parents while they drop my older brother off at college. One night while we were hanging in our hotel room, I loaded up my Discman with Discovery by Daft Punk. I had been obsessed with them since Homework, and while I had seen the video for One More Time countless times, I had yet to really dive into the whole album.\n\nWhile my parents watched TV in that hotel room, I was becoming immersed by this record. I had never had this experience before, it felt so much more than just the simple act of listening to music. I was visualizing this world, created within my own imagination. Listening to this record made me feel like I was living in this new space.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/48ddd3b4-c4e7-4fd1-8d24-5f9a8640aace.png?height=1348&width=1946)\n\nI'm about a month or so into this release process. The album is due out in November, but there's lots of prep work that has to be done so that everything can run smoothly in the fall. Here’s a quick list of some of the things that are being worked on at the moment:\n\n- The art for the record (the cover, the back, and several digital singles) is in the process of being made. First sketches are in, and they're stunning.\n- A live concert film to coincide with the release of the record is being developed and imagined.\n- Press photos are being arranged.\n- Music video treatments are being written.\n- Single edits are being cut.\n- Songs are being mastered.\n- Vinyl is just about to start being manufactured.\n- A publicist is being chosen, and hired soon.\n- Digital promos for DJs (both club and radio) are being prepped.\n- A biography writer is being chosen, and I'll be sitting down to chat with them in the next few months.\n- Conversations with agents are starting. Shows in 2022?\n- Lots, and I mean lots, of conversations about releasing a music in the time of web3 are happening.\n\nThis is truly the most involved and intensive album release I’ve orchestrated (alongside my manager, and the label I’ll be releasing the record with). I’ve released my last several records on my own label, [Flora](https://helloflora.bandcamp.com), and while it’s been an incredibly rewarding process, there’s an energy and excitement in all this that my last few releases just didn't have.\n\nIt all just makes me feel like this is going to be a significant release.\n\nThis is actually kind of terrifying to me. But we'll get into my artistic insecurities another time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5801288f-c667-47d8-973f-e6805306969c.JPG?height=1600&width=1980)\n\nI guess it's worth addressing why I would want to write about this process. \n\nI want to journal through these upcoming months for my own sake, but also on the off chance that it could be of some benefit to someone else. Maybe you're a musician as well, and you're curious to see how the process works for someone else. Maybe you've been following my music for a while, and you're excited to get a sneak peak into an album you're anticipating. Regardless, I'm honestly just excited to get to share all of this with some other people.\n\nThere's also a specific reason for why I've chosen Mirror as the platform to publish these journals. This is the first time I'll be involving any sort of web3 aspect to an album release. Like I noted above, I'm having lots of conversations with a lot of smart people about the most interesting ways to go about doing that. Mirror just feels like the right place for me to document that specific journey, and hopefully lay out some groundwork for how an artist might be able to work in this space in the future.\n\nLooking forward to spending some time with you. Be back soon.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/28d0e92a-ee5b-4385-b3f3-4992c2cf4925.png?height=764&width=1580)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1621057733, "digest": "hdKPyGp8HM6nIMbR1QAdbF-FB3-NCqd2tUMN7TFDrI0", "contributor": "0xEa83321A41c69070C971CD9Ca193366d6Be8DDC4"}
