{"id": "CPV7d3qBEWxq6TlfzVVfvvwdLT7MDzYZFdS_8uoTr78", "title": "Grit, Resilience and Determination", "body": "I am returning to a topic that I have talked a lot about on this blog.\n\nA number of years ago at our annual CEO Summit, we had Angela Duckworth speak to our portfolio about Grit, the topic of [her excellent book on the subject](https://www.amazon.com/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth/dp/1501111108). In Angela’s research, she determined that the single greatest determinant of success was not talent. It was grit.\n\nI was reminded of that last night as I watched Derek Rose lead the New York Knicks to a must win in game two of their series against the Atlanta Hawks. The Knicks were a mess for the first half of the game and Derek Rose singlehandedly kept them in the game.\n\nDerek Rose was the first pick in the 2008 draft and by 2011 he became the youngest NBA player to win the Most Valuable Player award, something he accomplished at age 23. A year later he tore his ACL and he has struggled with injuries ever since.\n\nIn the middle of this season, the Knicks acquired Derek Rose from the Detroit Pistons and soon thereafter he came down with Covid and missed several weeks.\n\nBut after Derek Rose came back from Covid in the last seventeen games of the season, the Knicks won thirteen of those games and landed in fourth place in the East.\n\nAnd last night, he was the heart and soul of the Knicks. He kept them in the game until his teammates woke up, and he led the team in scoring in a must-win.\n\nDerek Rose will never be the player he was at 23 when he could beat anyone off the dribble and score at will. He could have called it quits many times in the last nine years since he won his MVP. But he hasn’t quit, he’s worked his way back and he is leading an NBA team in the playoffs. It is really something to behold.\n\nNot everything goes the way we are expecting it to go. We get dealt bad hands and have to play them. That is way things are in life. There are people out there, like Derek Rose, who show that you can make the best of a tough situation, keep going, and win anyway. That’s grit.\n", "timestamp": 1622123808, "digest": "UVLmic3T2spwLxZehkBR-zpA-hZ3CIMcNonjVCT0Q4o", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn’t meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you’d think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend’s living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn’t just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it’s not just a technology. It’s a philosophy. It’s a belief system. It’s a way of viewing the world. It’s about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you’re batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood. I remember the “aha moment” when I wrote my first smart contract. With just a few lines of code and a private key, I was able to transfer an internet-native currency anywhere in the world in seconds. \n\nI didn’t have to sign up for Stripe. I didn’t have to use the Plaid API to connect a bank account. I didn’t have to check if TransferWise supported payments for a specific country. There was no centralized party. Just a peer-to-peer cryptonetwork called Ethereum. It was pretty damn mindblowing.\n\nAfter the first few weeks at Dharma, I was confident that DeFi and crypto were the future. But I also got the itch to work on some of my own ideas. I wanted to build software for creative people. Writers. Artists. Musicians. Online teachers. I strongly believe our world depends on these types of people having the tools they need to serve their communities as best they can.\n\nFrankly, I also thought it would take a couple years before the crypto industry had the infrastructure in place for a mainstream consumer app to be built.\n\n\nSo I ended up leaving Dharma to take some time off and explore a few startup ideas. But a couple months ago I read a [manifesto](https://cryptomedia.wtf/) by [Zora](https://zora.co/) that changed how I thought about crypto.\n\nIt described a world where crypto could be used to give any digital media file (eg an image, a song, an essay, digital art, etc.) property rights.

It follows the guidelines I described in my [previous sketch on Mirror](https://air.mirror.xyz/bTAwqOAe2vG6UIq5KSPrEho_VbrfDxcswm0ZuUtPGAc). The plan is to turn [Dirt](https://dirt.substack.com), a daily newsletter on streaming and entertainment that I've been developing, into a major voice on digital culture. \n\nTo participate, you can buy Dirt’s new animated NFTs of the [newsletter’s mascot, Dirty](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-introducing-dirty-lockdown-blues). You’ll get the NFT art as well as an airdropped commensurate number of $DIRT-S1 tokens. There are three versions of NFT: a Pea Green edition of 100, a Pearl Pink edition of 30, and a special Rainbow Wave, which is a single NFT. The 100 edition will get 50 $DIRT-S1 tokens, the 30 edition 200, and the unique NFT will be auctioned off and the winner will receive 1000 tokens. \n\nThe goal is to raise about 10-15ETH total with NFT edition sales. The funding will go toward paying for editors, writers, artists, and environmental offsets for the entire project. At the end of season 1 of Dirt, we’ll release another round of Dirty NFTs and the proceeds will go toward $DIRT-S1 holders. Funders will also get transparent reports on the publication's growth and progress, as well as input on what to cover, writing opportunities, and early access to later funding rounds or NFT drops, with conversations held over a listserv. The NFT editions are below, with a detailed explanation of the plan. \n\nBy supporting this project, you’ll fund the first NFT-driven newsletter and help demonstrate what is possible with NFT culture, with a front-row seat to the results.\n\n## **Join in**\n\n### Dirty S1 Rainbow Wave\n*1/1 — Auction at 1ETH*\nReceives 1000 $DIRT-S1 tokens\n\n### Dirty S1 Pearl Pink\n*30/30 — 0.2ETH*\nEach NFT receives 200 $DIRT-S1 tokens\n\n### Dirty S1 Pea Green\n*100/100 — 0.05ETH*\nEach NFT receives 50 $DIRT-S1 tokens\n\n[Token #3309](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3309)\n\n[Dirty S1 Pearl Pink](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=3)\n\n[Dirty S1 Pea Green](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=2)\n\n\n## **What is Dirt?**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c25ede72-4603-4ba2-b487-34402cfd07a0.jpg?height=1074&width=4400)\n\n[Dirt](dirt.substack.com) is a free daily morning newsletter about entertainment broadly, covering streaming TV; YouTube and TikTok; and any kind of interesting digital culture, including NFTs and digital assets. Popular past editions include [TikTok and suburban aesthetics](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-tiktok-and-suburban-gothic) and a [review of a podcast about pasta](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-the-pasta-is-content). The newsletter is anchored by me ([Kyle Chayka](http://kylechayka.com), author and writer for The New Yorker and many other publications as well as co-founder of [Study Hall](studyhall.xyz), a small media company) with contributions from writer [Daisy Alioto](https://www.daisyalioto.com/) (Vox, Paris Review, Longreads) and other freelance writers.\n\nSince launching in December 2021, Dirt has gained 3,600+ organic newsletter subscribers and has been linked to by websites from the Financial Times to Axios and Slate. It is now an established publication in the media landscape, tweeted and shared by influential writers. It has a 40%+ open rate and gets 3,000+ views daily. Readers include executives from Netflix and HBO.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa2f806d-33bf-4614-a4b0-e7aed6de8fb5.png?height=1150&width=1490)\n\n*Dirt's subscriber growth*\n\nDirt’s tone is accessible and educational, building a broader awareness of digital culture through smart criticism and analysis. It’s about creating engaged entertainment consumers and hosting good dialogue in a digestible format. It is developing an active community of both writers and readers — imagine [The Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/) of digital / streaming culture. Traditional subscription funding supports content that many people already agree on; NFT patronage systems will support more radical and innovative content like Dirt. \n\nThe archive of Dirt posts can be [found here](https://dirt.substack.com/). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f9c17e0a-3474-4662-9c59-18a44a7d276f.png?height=1348&width=1582)\n\n## Dirt growth plan\n\nWith the new NFT sales, Dirt will commission new freelance contributors, grow the email list, and aggressively cover digital culture, including NFTs, video games, [Metaverse topics](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse), and the evolving nature of entertainment on the internet as we move toward Web3.0. This content will create dialogue and education around these topics, developing connoisseurship of digital assets and an aspirational culture. \n\nAt the same time, Dirt will produce a growing content range of NFTs, based on branding assets like our new mascot, Dirty, who was previously commissioned from the artist [Jason Adam Katzenstein](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jason-adam-katzenstein) (cartoonist for The New Yorker, author, and illustrator). Here is one of our initial art pieces: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/469c62cd-d9b8-416c-80a5-c5012020675c.png?height=500&width=500)\n\nDirty is like the avatar of Dirt: they’re a formless, muddy blob that floats around the internet. What will Dirty do next? Dress up like a TV show character? Become animated or CGI? Imagine a kind of Pokemon or Cryptopunks-esque culture around the publication’s mascot, which gets translated into NFTs and other assets, which fund the publication over time, accruing value. (It’s like if The New Yorker’s [Eustace Tilley](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/mystery-man-2) were an NFT.)\n\nOur new animated NFTs, which come in several colorways, are created by the interactive designer [Mark Costello](http://markalancostello.squarespace.com/), who will produce more animations in the future. \n\nDirt’s content will roll out in seasons: periods of a month or a few months in which the content is fully funded and is branded as such. This first Mirror NFT sale and token creation won’t fund Dirt in perpetuity, but it’s an experiment to see how NFTs can be used to create a specific batch of content and create equity in a publication for anyone who wants to participate — a sense of [digital belonging](https://air.mirror.xyz/5A16bvvS2IJK7fVVNb2GwrrEcyey2B4UiH2l1DI_Y2I) for supporters, as I wrote about previously on Mirror, and a chance to pioneer a publication from NFT culture. \n\n— For previous examples of how crowdfunding editorial projects works, see Emily Segal’s $NOVEL and $GENERALIST. An explanation of [token holder options post-NFT sale is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XO65q7UjVePv7XOu5DEvksaEJTXPozjsTc_toJLmh3A/edit). A clear overall description of the model [is here](https://twitter.com/mariodgabriele/status/1378032448664170505). \n\nFunders will have active stakes in the success of the project and will be encouraged to participate, give feedback, grow the email list, write for the publication, etc. \n\n## **NFT sales and $DIRT-S1 token**\n\nDirt NFTs are available now in two editions, one of 100 for .05 ETH and one of 30 for .2 ETH. The auction for the singular NFT starts at 1 ETH. Each NFT is in a different colorway: Pea Green, Pearl Pink, and Rainbow Wave. These colors and this animation will never be reused. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5ed927b1-a2ba-4777-a43c-1d0e6bcc7e78.png?height=208&width=884)\n\nSeparately, the **$DIRT-S1 token** will be created and distributed to backers in proportion to their participation. Tokens will be minted at a rate of 1000 $DIRT-S1 to 1 ETH raised and airdropped to the NFT buyers after the crowdfund ends. On top of that, 25% extra $DIRT-S1 will be minted to stay with Dirt to reward contributors. \n\nThe total 10 ETH goal will fund Dirt’s first season of content, including writing, editing, freelancers, marketing, and NFT art.

It follows the guidelines I described in my [previous sketch on Mirror](https://air.mirror.xyz/bTAwqOAe2vG6UIq5KSPrEho_VbrfDxcswm0ZuUtPGAc). The plan is to turn [Dirt](https://dirt.substack.com), a daily newsletter on streaming and entertainment that I've been developing, into a major voice on digital culture. \n\nTo participate, you can buy Dirt’s new animated NFTs of the [newsletter’s mascot, Dirty](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-introducing-dirty-lockdown-blues). You’ll get the NFT art as well as an airdropped commensurate number of $DIRT-S1 tokens. There are three versions of NFT: a Pea Green edition of 100, a Pearl Pink edition of 30, and a special Rainbow Wave, which is a single NFT. The 100 edition will get 50 $DIRT-S1 tokens, the 30 edition 200, and the unique NFT will be auctioned off and the winner will receive 1000 tokens. \n\nThe goal is to raise about 10-15ETH total with NFT edition sales. The funding will go toward paying for editors, writers, artists, and environmental offsets for the entire project. At the end of season 1 of Dirt, we’ll release another round of Dirty NFTs and the proceeds will go toward $DIRT-S1 holders. Funders will also get transparent reports on the publication's growth and progress, as well as input on what to cover, writing opportunities, and early access to later funding rounds or NFT drops, with conversations held over a listserv. The NFT editions are below, with a detailed explanation of the plan. \n\nBy supporting this project, you’ll fund the first NFT-driven newsletter and help demonstrate what is possible with NFT culture, with a front-row seat to the results.\n\n## **Join in**\n\n### Dirty S1 Rainbow Wave\n*1/1 — Auction at 1ETH*\nReceives 1000 $DIRT-S1 tokens\n\n### Dirty S1 Pearl Pink\n*30/30 — 0.2ETH*\nEach NFT receives 200 $DIRT-S1 tokens\n\n### Dirty S1 Pea Green\n*100/100 — 0.05ETH*\nEach NFT receives 50 $DIRT-S1 tokens\n\n[Token #3309](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3309)\n\n[Dirty S1 Pearl Pink](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=3)\n\n[Dirty S1 Pea Green](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=2)\n\n\n## **What is Dirt?**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c25ede72-4603-4ba2-b487-34402cfd07a0.jpg?height=1074&width=4400)\n\n[Dirt](dirt.substack.com) is a free daily morning newsletter about entertainment broadly, covering streaming TV; YouTube and TikTok; and any kind of interesting digital culture, including NFTs and digital assets. Popular past editions include [TikTok and suburban aesthetics](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-tiktok-and-suburban-gothic) and a [review of a podcast about pasta](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-the-pasta-is-content). The newsletter is anchored by me ([Kyle Chayka](http://kylechayka.com), author and writer for The New Yorker and many other publications as well as co-founder of [Study Hall](studyhall.xyz), a small media company) with contributions from writer [Daisy Alioto](https://www.daisyalioto.com/) (Vox, Paris Review, Longreads) and other freelance writers.\n\nSince launching in December 2021, Dirt has gained 3,600+ organic newsletter subscribers and has been linked to by websites from the Financial Times to Axios and Slate. It is now an established publication in the media landscape, tweeted and shared by influential writers. It has a 40%+ open rate and gets 3,000+ views daily.

It’s about creating engaged entertainment consumers and hosting good dialogue in a digestible format. It is developing an active community of both writers and readers — imagine [The Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/) of digital / streaming culture. Traditional subscription funding supports content that many people already agree on; NFT patronage systems will support more radical and innovative content like Dirt. \n\nThe archive of Dirt posts can be [found here](https://dirt.substack.com/). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f9c17e0a-3474-4662-9c59-18a44a7d276f.png?height=1348&width=1582)\n\n## Dirt growth plan\n\nWith the new NFT sales, Dirt will commission new freelance contributors, grow the email list, and aggressively cover digital culture, including NFTs, video games, [Metaverse topics](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse), and the evolving nature of entertainment on the internet as we move toward Web3.0. This content will create dialogue and education around these topics, developing connoisseurship of digital assets and an aspirational culture. \n\nAt the same time, Dirt will produce a growing content range of NFTs, based on branding assets like our new mascot, Dirty, who was previously commissioned from the artist [Jason Adam Katzenstein](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jason-adam-katzenstein) (cartoonist for The New Yorker, author, and illustrator). Here is one of our initial art pieces: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/469c62cd-d9b8-416c-80a5-c5012020675c.png?height=500&width=500)\n\nDirty is like the avatar of Dirt: they’re a formless, muddy blob that floats around the internet. What will Dirty do next? Dress up like a TV show character? Become animated or CGI? Imagine a kind of Pokemon or Cryptopunks-esque culture around the publication’s mascot, which gets translated into NFTs and other assets, which fund the publication over time, accruing value. (It’s like if The New Yorker’s [Eustace Tilley](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/mystery-man-2) were an NFT.)\n\nOur new animated NFTs, which come in several colorways, are created by the interactive designer [Mark Costello](http://markalancostello.squarespace.com/), who will produce more animations in the future. \n\nDirt’s content will roll out in seasons: periods of a month or a few months in which the content is fully funded and is branded as such. This first Mirror NFT sale and token creation won’t fund Dirt in perpetuity, but it’s an experiment to see how NFTs can be used to create a specific batch of content and create equity in a publication for anyone who wants to participate — a sense of [digital belonging](https://air.mirror.xyz/5A16bvvS2IJK7fVVNb2GwrrEcyey2B4UiH2l1DI_Y2I) for supporters, as I wrote about previously on Mirror, and a chance to pioneer a publication from NFT culture. \n\n— For previous examples of how crowdfunding editorial projects works, see Emily Segal’s $NOVEL and $GENERALIST.

A clear overall description of the model [is here](https://twitter.com/mariodgabriele/status/1378032448664170505). \n\nFunders will have active stakes in the success of the project and will be encouraged to participate, give feedback, grow the email list, write for the publication, etc. \n\n## **NFT sales and $DIRT-S1 token**\n\nDirt NFTs are available now in two editions, one of 100 for .05 ETH and one of 30 for .2 ETH.

These colors and this animation will never be reused. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5ed927b1-a2ba-4777-a43c-1d0e6bcc7e78.png?height=208&width=884)\n\nSeparately, the **$DIRT-S1 token** will be created and distributed to backers in proportion to their participation. Tokens will be minted at a rate of 1000 $DIRT-S1 to 1 ETH raised and airdropped to the NFT buyers after the crowdfund ends. On top of that, 25% extra $DIRT-S1 will be minted to stay with Dirt to reward contributors. \n\nThe total 10 ETH goal will fund Dirt’s first season of content, including writing, editing, freelancers, marketing, and NFT art. If the net funding is higher, season 1 will last for a longer time and accrue more value for the publication. \n\nAt the end of the season of content, another wave of NFT editions will be released to wrap up season 1.

I have written for many major [magazines and websites](kylechayka.com) (New Yorker, New York Times, Vox, etc) and also co-founded and run [Study Hall](studyhall.xyz), a subscription media newsletter company and community with 6,000+ paid subscribers and a staff of 5. It will be simple for me to take this initial funding and execute the season of content, as well as lead the publication as a business going forward. \n\nSome of my popular past essays: \n\n- [Ambient Television](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/emily-in-paris-and-the-rise-of-ambient-tv) (The New Yorker)\n- [How Do You Describe TikTok?](https://kylechayka.substack.com/p/essay-how-do-you-describe-tiktok) (personal newsletter) \n- [Welcome to AirSpace](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification) (The Verge) \n\nI’m excited to use my experience in traditional media spaces to pioneer something new and different in the NFT ecosystem. \n\n## Platform Approach\n\nDirt has already grown on Substack, which is useful for its email functionality and fully developed CMS, as well as its familiarity for readers — Dirt now has organic growth there. Future Dirt content will be cross-posted on Substack and Mirror, where it will also come with updates about the publication and NFT business models. \n\nOn Mirror, I’ll develop approaches for integrating NFTs into editorial and creating a connection between NFTs and storytelling, with the goal of eventually moving the entire project onto Mirror. Traditional paywalls will be avoided in favor of patronage and community investment. The content will also create more context for NFT adoption, exposing Substack readers to the mechanics and culture of NFTs and social tokens. \n\n## Business Model Going Forward\n\n1. Crowdfund ETH via NFT editions.\n2. Create editorial and more NFT content.\n3. Grow subscriber base.\n4. Drive more demand for Dirt digital assets.\n5. Sell representative NFTs.\n6. Create value for token holders.\n7. Repeat until market for Dirt assets is self-sustaining.\n\nIf this initial NFT model doesn’t work I am committed to developing other options and distributing the proceeds to token holders. \n\n## Contact\n\nEmail me at [chaykak@gmail.com](mailto:chaykak@gmail.com) if you have any questions or feedback about the project!", "timestamp": 1622145757, "digest": "lmV9Dxeos9HvKSu0BKY9pqARK2vAlPXhrNMt68E4GkI", "contributor": "0x25cbCFA16e43e58517f80D583087Ea89241293E6"}

It follows the guidelines I described in my [previous sketch on Mirror](https://air.mirror.xyz/bTAwqOAe2vG6UIq5KSPrEho_VbrfDxcswm0ZuUtPGAc). The plan is to turn [Dirt](https://dirt.substack.com), a daily newsletter on streaming and entertainment that I've been developing, into a major voice on digital culture. \n\nTo participate, you can buy Dirt’s new animated NFTs of the [newsletter’s mascot, Dirty](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-introducing-dirty-lockdown-blues). You’ll get the NFT art as well as an airdropped commensurate number of $DIRT-S1 tokens. There are three versions of NFT: a Pea Green edition of 100, a Pearl Pink edition of 30, and a special Rainbow Wave, which is a single NFT. The 100 edition will get 50 $DIRT-S1 tokens, the 30 edition 200, and the unique NFT will be auctioned off and the winner will receive 1000 tokens. \n\nThe goal is to raise about 10-15ETH total with NFT edition sales. The funding will go toward paying for editors, writers, artists, and environmental offsets for the entire project. At the end of season 1 of Dirt, we’ll release another round of Dirty NFTs and the proceeds will go toward $DIRT-S1 holders. Funders will also get transparent reports on the publication's growth and progress, as well as input on what to cover, writing opportunities, and early access to later funding rounds or NFT drops, with conversations held over a listserv. The NFT editions are below, with a detailed explanation of the plan. \n\nBy supporting this project, you’ll fund the first NFT-driven newsletter and help demonstrate what is possible with NFT culture, with a front-row seat to the results.\n\n## **Join in**\n\n### Dirty S1 Rainbow Wave\n*1/1 — Auction at 1ETH*\nReceives 1000 $DIRT-S1 tokens\n\n### Dirty S1 Pearl Pink\n*30/30 — 0.2ETH*\nEach NFT receives 200 $DIRT-S1 tokens\n\n### Dirty S1 Pea Green\n*100/100 — 0.05ETH*\nEach NFT receives 50 $DIRT-S1 tokens\n\n*All NFT art by [Mark Costello](http://markalancostello.squarespace.com/)*\n\n[Token #3309](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3309)\n\n[Dirty S1 Pearl Pink](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=3)\n\n[Dirty S1 Pea Green](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=2)\n\n\n## **What is Dirt?**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c25ede72-4603-4ba2-b487-34402cfd07a0.jpg?height=1074&width=4400)\n\n[Dirt](dirt.substack.com) is a free daily morning newsletter about entertainment broadly, covering streaming TV; YouTube and TikTok; and any kind of interesting digital culture, including NFTs and digital assets. Popular past editions include [TikTok and suburban aesthetics](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-tiktok-and-suburban-gothic) and a [review of a podcast about pasta](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-the-pasta-is-content). The newsletter is anchored by me ([Kyle Chayka](http://kylechayka.com), author and writer for The New Yorker and many other publications as well as co-founder of [Study Hall](studyhall.xyz), a small media company) with contributions from writer [Daisy Alioto](https://www.daisyalioto.com/) (Vox, Paris Review, Longreads) and other freelance writers.\n\nSince launching in December 2021, Dirt has gained 3,600+ organic newsletter subscribers and has been linked to by websites from the Financial Times to Axios and Slate. It is now an established publication in the media landscape, tweeted and shared by influential writers. It has a 40%+ open rate and gets 3,000+ views daily. Readers include executives from Netflix and HBO.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa2f806d-33bf-4614-a4b0-e7aed6de8fb5.png?height=1150&width=1490)\n\n*Dirt's subscriber growth*\n\nDirt’s tone is accessible and educational, building a broader awareness of digital culture through smart criticism and analysis. It’s about creating engaged entertainment consumers and hosting good dialogue in a digestible format. It is developing an active community of both writers and readers — imagine [The Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/) of digital / streaming culture. Traditional subscription funding supports content that many people already agree on; NFT patronage systems will support more radical and innovative content like Dirt. \n\nThe archive of Dirt posts can be [found here](https://dirt.substack.com/). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f9c17e0a-3474-4662-9c59-18a44a7d276f.png?height=1348&width=1582)\n\n## Dirt growth plan\n\nWith the new NFT sales, Dirt will commission new freelance contributors, grow the email list, and aggressively cover digital culture, including NFTs, video games, [Metaverse topics](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse), and the evolving nature of entertainment on the internet as we move toward Web3.0. This content will create dialogue and education around these topics, developing connoisseurship of digital assets and an aspirational culture. \n\nAt the same time, Dirt will produce a growing content range of NFTs, based on branding assets like our new mascot, Dirty, who was previously commissioned from the artist [Jason Adam Katzenstein](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jason-adam-katzenstein) (cartoonist for The New Yorker, author, and illustrator). Here is one of our initial art pieces: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/469c62cd-d9b8-416c-80a5-c5012020675c.png?height=500&width=500)\n\nDirty is like the avatar of Dirt: they’re a formless, muddy blob that floats around the internet. What will Dirty do next? Dress up like a TV show character? Become animated or CGI? Imagine a kind of Pokemon or Cryptopunks-esque culture around the publication’s mascot, which gets translated into NFTs and other assets, which fund the publication over time, accruing value. (It’s like if The New Yorker’s [Eustace Tilley](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/mystery-man-2) were an NFT.)\n\nOur new animated NFTs, which come in several colorways, are created by the interactive designer [Mark Costello](http://markalancostello.squarespace.com/), who will produce more animations in the future. \n\nDirt’s content will roll out in seasons: periods of a month or a few months in which the content is fully funded and is branded as such. This first Mirror NFT sale and token creation won’t fund Dirt in perpetuity, but it’s an experiment to see how NFTs can be used to create a specific batch of content and create equity in a publication for anyone who wants to participate — a sense of [digital belonging](https://air.mirror.xyz/5A16bvvS2IJK7fVVNb2GwrrEcyey2B4UiH2l1DI_Y2I) for supporters, as I wrote about previously on Mirror, and a chance to pioneer a publication from NFT culture. \n\n— For previous examples of how crowdfunding editorial projects works, see Emily Segal’s $NOVEL and $GENERALIST. An explanation of [token holder options post-NFT sale is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XO65q7UjVePv7XOu5DEvksaEJTXPozjsTc_toJLmh3A/edit). A clear overall description of the model [is here](https://twitter.com/mariodgabriele/status/1378032448664170505). \n\nFunders will have active stakes in the success of the project and will be encouraged to participate, give feedback, grow the email list, write for the publication, etc. \n\n## **NFT sales and $DIRT-S1 token**\n\nDirt NFTs are available now in two editions, one of 100 for .05 ETH and one of 30 for .2 ETH. The auction for the singular NFT starts at 1 ETH. Each NFT is in a different colorway: Pea Green, Pearl Pink, and Rainbow Wave. These colors and this animation will never be reused. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5ed927b1-a2ba-4777-a43c-1d0e6bcc7e78.png?height=208&width=884)\n\nSeparately, the **$DIRT-S1 token** will be created and distributed to backers in proportion to their participation. Tokens will be minted at a rate of 1000 $DIRT-S1 to 1 ETH raised and airdropped to the NFT buyers after the crowdfund ends. (The winner of the auction will receive 1000 $DIRT-S1 no matter what the final price is.) On top of that, 25% extra $DIRT-S1 will be minted to stay with Dirt to reward contributors. \n\nThe total 10 ETH goal will fund Dirt’s first season of content, including writing, editing, freelancers, marketing, and NFT art. If the net funding is higher, season 1 will last for a longer time and accrue more value for the publication. \n\nAt the end of the season of content, another wave of NFT editions will be released to wrap up season 1. The sale of those NFTs will flow back to the token holders if they desire to exchange it and it will also fund the development of the next round of Dirt NFT expansion: editorial planning, commissioning more art, and environmental offsets. \n\nFuture rounds of funding will be based on season-themed tokens, like $DIRT-S2, etc (similar to magazine volumes, which are numbered by year and edition). When the publication is on solid footing, I will create a final $DIRT token as an authoritative representation of equity and airdrop it proportionally to all holders of all previous tokens. Early token holders will be given preference in all Dirt token and NFT transactions.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1aed684b-ee11-4a10-91e0-b0e2b531992b.jpg?height=500&width=500)\n\n*Art by Jason Adam Katzenstein*\n\n\nThe purpose of Dirt is to create both an editorial and a visual universe. The publication will coexist with the body of Dirty-focused artwork, which will expand as we keep publishing, collaborating with new artists and designers. This is what will drive the Dirt NFT market and continue funding the publication, plus creating a fun new form of content. \n\n## **10-15ETH Budget**\n\n- **`40%`** commissioning freelance content\n- **`25%`** founders editing and writing \n- **`25%`** art & NFT development\n- **`10%`** marketing & partnerships\n\n**Season 1 runtime**: 1-3 months\n\n## **About the founders**\n\nI am well-equipped to run Dirt as a small publication having already executed it for several months, using my own media-industry background.

It will be simple for me to take this initial funding and execute the season of content, as well as lead the publication as a business going forward. \n\nSome of my popular past essays: \n\n- [Ambient Television](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/emily-in-paris-and-the-rise-of-ambient-tv) (The New Yorker)\n- [How Do You Describe TikTok?](https://kylechayka.substack.com/p/essay-how-do-you-describe-tiktok) (personal newsletter) \n- [Welcome to AirSpace](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification) (The Verge) \n\nI’m excited to use my experience in traditional media spaces to pioneer something new and different in the NFT ecosystem. \n\n## Platform Approach\n\nDirt has already grown on Substack, which is useful for its email functionality and fully developed CMS, as well as its familiarity for readers — Dirt now has organic growth there. Future Dirt content will be cross-posted on Substack and Mirror, where it will also come with updates about the publication and NFT business models. \n\nOn Mirror, I’ll develop approaches for integrating NFTs into editorial and creating a connection between NFTs and storytelling, with the goal of eventually moving the entire project onto Mirror. Traditional paywalls will be avoided in favor of patronage and community investment. The content will also create more context for NFT adoption, exposing Substack readers to the mechanics and culture of NFTs and social tokens. \n\n## Business Model Going Forward\n\n1. Crowdfund ETH via NFT editions.\n2. Create editorial and more NFT content.\n3. Grow subscriber base.\n4. Drive more demand for Dirt digital assets.\n5. Sell representative NFTs.\n6. Create value for token holders.\n7. Repeat until market for Dirt assets is self-sustaining.\n\nIf this initial NFT model doesn’t work I am committed to developing other options and distributing the proceeds to token holders. \n\n## Contact\n\nEmail me at [chaykak@gmail.com](mailto:chaykak@gmail.com) if you have any questions or feedback about the project!", "timestamp": 1622151157, "digest": "lmV9Dxeos9HvKSu0BKY9pqARK2vAlPXhrNMt68E4GkI", "contributor": "0x25cbCFA16e43e58517f80D583087Ea89241293E6"}

It follows the guidelines I described in my [previous sketch on Mirror](https://air.mirror.xyz/bTAwqOAe2vG6UIq5KSPrEho_VbrfDxcswm0ZuUtPGAc). The plan is to turn [Dirt](https://dirt.substack.com), a daily newsletter on streaming and entertainment that I've been developing, into a major voice on digital culture. \n\nTo participate, you can buy Dirt’s new animated NFTs of the [newsletter’s mascot, Dirty](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-introducing-dirty-lockdown-blues). You’ll get the NFT art as well as an airdropped commensurate number of $DIRT-S1 tokens as a reward. There are three versions of NFT: a Pea Green edition of 100, a Pearl Pink edition of 30, and a special Rainbow Wave, which is a single NFT. The 100 edition will get a reward of 50 $DIRT-S1 tokens, the 30 edition 200, and the unique NFT will be auctioned off and the winner will be rewarded 1000 tokens. \n\nThe goal is to crowdfund about 10-15ETH total with NFT edition sales. The funding will go toward paying for editors, writers, artists, and environmental offsets for the entire project. At the end of season 1 of Dirt, we’ll release another round of Dirty NFTs as prizes for $DIRT-S1 holders. Crowdfunders will also get transparent reports on the publication's growth and progress, as well as input on what to cover, writing opportunities, and early access to later NFT and token drops, with conversations held over a listserv. The NFT editions are below, with a detailed explanation of the plan. \n\nBy supporting this project, you’ll help create the first NFT-driven newsletter and demonstrate what is possible with NFT culture, with a front-row seat to the results.\n\n## **Join in**\n\n### Dirty S1 Rainbow Wave\n*1/1 — Auction at 1ETH*\nReceives 1000 $DIRT-S1 tokens\n\n### Dirty S1 Pearl Pink\n*30/30 — 0.2ETH*\nEach NFT receives 200 $DIRT-S1 tokens\n\n### Dirty S1 Pea Green\n*100/100 — 0.05ETH*\nEach NFT receives 50 $DIRT-S1 tokens\n\n*All NFT art by [Mark Costello](http://markalancostello.com/)*\n\n[Token #3309](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3309)\n\n[Dirty S1 Pearl Pink](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=3)\n\n[Dirty S1 Pea Green](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=2)\n\n\n## **What is Dirt?**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c25ede72-4603-4ba2-b487-34402cfd07a0.jpg?height=1074&width=4400)\n\n[Dirt](dirt.substack.com) is a free daily morning newsletter about entertainment broadly, covering streaming TV; YouTube and TikTok; and any kind of interesting digital culture, including NFTs and digital assets. Popular past editions include [TikTok and suburban aesthetics](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-tiktok-and-suburban-gothic) and a [review of a podcast about pasta](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-the-pasta-is-content). The newsletter is anchored by me ([Kyle Chayka](http://kylechayka.com), author and writer for The New Yorker and many other publications as well as co-founder of [Study Hall](studyhall.xyz), a small media company) with contributions from writer [Daisy Alioto](https://www.daisyalioto.com/) (Vox, Paris Review, Longreads) and other freelance writers.\n\nSince launching in December 2021, Dirt has gained 3,600+ organic newsletter subscribers and has been linked to by websites from the Financial Times to Axios and Slate. It is now an established publication in the media landscape, tweeted and shared by influential writers. It has a 40%+ open rate and gets 3,000+ views daily. Readers include executives from Netflix and HBO.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa2f806d-33bf-4614-a4b0-e7aed6de8fb5.png?height=1150&width=1490)\n\n*Dirt's subscriber growth*\n\nDirt’s tone is accessible and educational, building a broader awareness of digital culture through smart criticism and analysis. It’s about creating engaged entertainment consumers and hosting good dialogue in a digestible format. It is developing an active community of both writers and readers — imagine [The Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/) of digital / streaming culture. Traditional subscription funding supports content that many people already agree on; NFT crowdfunding patronage systems will support more radical and innovative content like Dirt. \n\nThe archive of Dirt posts can be [found here](https://dirt.substack.com/). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f9c17e0a-3474-4662-9c59-18a44a7d276f.png?height=1348&width=1582)\n\n## Dirt growth plan\n\nWith the funding from the new NFT sales, Dirt will commission new freelance contributions, grow the email list, and aggressively cover digital culture, including NFTs, video games, [Metaverse topics](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse), and the evolving nature of entertainment on the internet as we move toward Web3.0. This content will create dialogue and education around these topics, developing connoisseurship of digital assets and an aspirational culture. \n\nAt the same time, Dirt will produce a growing content range of NFTs, based on branding assets like our new mascot, Dirty, who was previously commissioned from the artist [Jason Adam Katzenstein](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jason-adam-katzenstein) (cartoonist for The New Yorker, author, and illustrator). Here is one of our initial art pieces: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/469c62cd-d9b8-416c-80a5-c5012020675c.png?height=500&width=500)\n\nDirty is like the avatar of Dirt: they’re a formless, muddy blob that floats around the internet. What will Dirty do next? Dress up like a TV show character? Become animated or CGI? Imagine a kind of Pokemon or Cryptopunks-esque culture around the publication’s mascot, which gets translated into NFTs and other assets, which fund the publication over time, accruing value. (It’s like if The New Yorker’s [Eustace Tilley](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/mystery-man-2) were an NFT.)\n\nOur new animated NFTs, which come in several colorways, are created by the interactive designer [Mark Costello](http://markalancostello.com/), who will produce more animations in the future. \n\nDirt’s content will roll out in seasons: periods of a month or a few months in which the content is fully funded and is branded as such. This first Mirror NFT sale and token creation won’t fund Dirt in perpetuity, but it’s an experiment to see how NFTs can be used to create a specific batch of content and create community in a publication for anyone who wants to participate — a sense of [digital belonging](https://air.mirror.xyz/5A16bvvS2IJK7fVVNb2GwrrEcyey2B4UiH2l1DI_Y2I) for supporters, as I wrote about previously on Mirror, and a chance to pioneer a publication from NFT culture. \n\n— For previous examples of how crowdfunding editorial projects works, see Emily Segal’s [$NOVEL](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) and [$GENERALIST](https://generalist.mirror.xyz/1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw). An explanation of [token holder options post-NFT sale is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XO65q7UjVePv7XOu5DEvksaEJTXPozjsTc_toJLmh3A/edit). A clear overall description of the model [is here](https://twitter.com/mariodgabriele/status/1378032448664170505). \n\nFunders will be able to contribute to the success of the project and will be encouraged to participate, give feedback, grow the email list, write for the publication, etc. \n\n## **NFT sales and $DIRT-S1 token**\n\nDirt NFTs are available now in two editions, one of 100 for .05 ETH and one of 30 for .2 ETH. The auction for the singular NFT starts at 1 ETH. Each NFT is in a different colorway: Pea Green, Pearl Pink, and Rainbow Wave. These colors and this animation will never be reused. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5ed927b1-a2ba-4777-a43c-1d0e6bcc7e78.png?height=208&width=884)\n\nSeparately, the **$DIRT-S1 token** will be created and rewarded to backers based on their NFT purchases. Tokens will be minted at a rate of 1000 $DIRT-S1 to 1 ETH of crowdfunding and airdropped to the NFT buyers after the crowdfund ends. (The winner of the auction will receive 1000 $DIRT-S1 no matter what the final price is.) On top of that, 25% extra $DIRT-S1 will be minted to stay with Dirt to reward contributors. \n\nThe total 10 ETH goal will provide funding for Dirt’s first season of content, including writing, editing, freelancers, marketing, and NFT art. If the net funding is higher, season 1 will last for a longer time and grow the publication further.\n\nAt the end of the season of content, another wave of NFT editions will be released to wrap up season 1. Token holders will have access to rewards from those NFTs if they desire to exchange the tokens, and more NFT sales will fund the development of the next round of Dirt NFT expansion: editorial planning, commissioning more art, and environmental offsets. \n\nFuture rounds of crowdfunding will be based on season-themed tokens, like $DIRT-S2, etc (similar to magazine volumes, which are numbered by year and edition). When the publication is on solid footing, I will create a final $DIRT token and airdrop it proportionally to all holders of all previous tokens as a reward. Early token holders will be given preference in all Dirt token and NFT releases.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1aed684b-ee11-4a10-91e0-b0e2b531992b.jpg?height=500&width=500)\n\n*Art by Jason Adam Katzenstein*\n\nThe purpose of Dirt is to create both an editorial and a visual universe. The publication will coexist with the body of Dirty-focused artwork, which will expand as we keep publishing, collaborating with new artists and designers.

It follows the guidelines I described in my [previous sketch on Mirror](https://air.mirror.xyz/bTAwqOAe2vG6UIq5KSPrEho_VbrfDxcswm0ZuUtPGAc). The plan is to turn [Dirt](https://dirt.substack.com), a daily newsletter on streaming and entertainment that I've been developing, into a major voice on digital culture. \n\nTo participate, you can buy Dirt’s new animated NFTs of the [newsletter’s mascot, Dirty](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-introducing-dirty-lockdown-blues). You’ll get the NFT art as well as an airdropped commensurate number of $DIRT-S1 tokens as a reward. There are three versions of NFT: a Pea Green edition of 100, a Pearl Pink edition of 30, and a special Rainbow Wave, which is a single NFT. The 100 edition will get a reward of 50 $DIRT-S1 tokens, the 30 edition 200, and the unique NFT will be auctioned off and the winner will be rewarded 1000 tokens. \n\nThe goal is to crowdfund about 10-15ETH total with NFT edition sales. The funding will go toward paying for editors, writers, artists, and environmental offsets for the entire project. At the end of season 1 of Dirt, we’ll release another round of Dirty NFTs as prizes for $DIRT-S1 holders. Crowdfunders will also get transparent reports on the publication's growth and progress, as well as input on what to cover, writing opportunities, and early access to later NFT and token drops, with conversations held over a listserv. The NFT editions are below, with a detailed explanation of the plan. \n\nBy supporting this project, you’ll help create the first NFT-driven newsletter and demonstrate what is possible with NFT culture, with a front-row seat to the results.\n\n## **Support the project**\n\n### Dirty S1 Rainbow Wave\n*1/1 — Auction at 1ETH*\nReward of 1000 $DIRT-S1 tokens per NFT\n\n### Dirty S1 Pearl Pink\n*30/30 — 0.2ETH*\nReward of 200 $DIRT-S1 tokens per NFT\n\n### Dirty S1 Pea Green\n*100/100 — 0.05ETH*\nReward of 50 $DIRT-S1 tokens per NFT\n\n*All NFT art by [Mark Costello](http://markalancostello.com/)*\n\n[Token #3309](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3309)\n\n[Dirty S1 Pearl Pink](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=3)\n\n[Dirty S1 Pea Green](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=2)\n\n\n## **What is Dirt?**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c25ede72-4603-4ba2-b487-34402cfd07a0.jpg?height=1074&width=4400)\n\n[Dirt](dirt.substack.com) is a free daily morning newsletter about entertainment broadly, covering streaming TV; YouTube and TikTok; and any kind of interesting digital culture, including NFTs and digital assets. Popular past editions include [TikTok and suburban aesthetics](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-tiktok-and-suburban-gothic) and a [review of a podcast about pasta](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-the-pasta-is-content). The newsletter is anchored by me ([Kyle Chayka](http://kylechayka.com), author and writer for The New Yorker and many other publications as well as co-founder of [Study Hall](studyhall.xyz), a small media company) with contributions from writer [Daisy Alioto](https://www.daisyalioto.com/) (Vox, Paris Review, Longreads) and other freelance writers.\n\nSince launching in December 2021, Dirt has gained 3,600+ organic newsletter subscribers and has been linked to by websites from the Financial Times to Axios and Slate. It is now an established publication in the media landscape, tweeted and shared by influential writers. It has a 40%+ open rate and gets 3,000+ views daily. Readers include executives from Netflix and HBO.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa2f806d-33bf-4614-a4b0-e7aed6de8fb5.png?height=1150&width=1490)\n\n*Dirt's subscriber growth*\n\nDirt’s tone is accessible and educational, building a broader awareness of digital culture through smart criticism and analysis. It’s about creating engaged entertainment consumers and hosting good dialogue in a digestible format. It is developing an active community of both writers and readers — imagine [The Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/) of digital / streaming culture. Traditional subscription funding supports content that many people already agree on; NFT crowdfunding patronage systems will support more radical and innovative content like Dirt. \n\nThe archive of Dirt posts can be [found here](https://dirt.substack.com/). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f9c17e0a-3474-4662-9c59-18a44a7d276f.png?height=1348&width=1582)\n\n## Dirt growth plan\n\nWith the funding from the new NFT sales, Dirt will commission new freelance contributions, grow the email list, and aggressively cover digital culture, including NFTs, video games, [Metaverse topics](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse), and the evolving nature of entertainment on the internet as we move toward Web3.0. This content will create dialogue and education around these topics, developing connoisseurship of digital assets and an aspirational culture. \n\nAt the same time, Dirt will produce a growing content range of NFTs, based on branding assets like our new mascot, Dirty, who was previously commissioned from the artist [Jason Adam Katzenstein](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jason-adam-katzenstein) (cartoonist for The New Yorker, author, and illustrator). Here is one of our initial art pieces: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/469c62cd-d9b8-416c-80a5-c5012020675c.png?height=500&width=500)\n\nDirty is like the avatar of Dirt: they’re a formless, muddy blob that floats around the internet. What will Dirty do next? Dress up like a TV show character? Become animated or CGI? Imagine a kind of Pokemon or Cryptopunks-esque culture around the publication’s mascot, which gets translated into NFTs and other assets, which fund the publication over time, accruing value. (It’s like if The New Yorker’s [Eustace Tilley](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/mystery-man-2) were an NFT.)\n\nOur new animated NFTs, which come in several colorways, are created by the interactive designer [Mark Costello](http://markalancostello.com/), who will produce more animations in the future. \n\nDirt’s content will roll out in seasons: periods of a month or a few months in which the content is fully funded and is branded as such. This first Mirror NFT sale and token creation won’t fund Dirt in perpetuity, but it’s an experiment to see how NFTs can be used to create a specific batch of content and create community in a publication for anyone who wants to participate — a sense of [digital belonging](https://air.mirror.xyz/5A16bvvS2IJK7fVVNb2GwrrEcyey2B4UiH2l1DI_Y2I) for supporters, as I wrote about previously on Mirror, and a chance to pioneer a publication from NFT culture. \n\n— For previous examples of how crowdfunding editorial projects works, see Emily Segal’s [$NOVEL](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) and [$GENERALIST](https://generalist.mirror.xyz/1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw). An explanation of [token holder options post-NFT sale is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XO65q7UjVePv7XOu5DEvksaEJTXPozjsTc_toJLmh3A/edit). A clear overall description of the model [is here](https://twitter.com/mariodgabriele/status/1378032448664170505). \n\nFunders will be able to contribute to the success of the project and will be encouraged to participate, give feedback, grow the email list, write for the publication, etc. \n\n## **NFT sales and $DIRT-S1 token**\n\nDirt NFTs are available now in two editions, one of 100 for .05 ETH and one of 30 for .2 ETH. The auction for the singular NFT starts at 1 ETH. Each NFT is in a different colorway: Pea Green, Pearl Pink, and Rainbow Wave. These colors and this animation will never be reused. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5ed927b1-a2ba-4777-a43c-1d0e6bcc7e78.png?height=208&width=884)\n\nSeparately, the **$DIRT-S1 token** will be created and rewarded to backers based on their NFT purchases. Tokens will be minted at a rate of 1000 $DIRT-S1 to 1 ETH of crowdfunding and airdropped to the NFT buyers after the crowdfund ends. (The winner of the auction will receive 1000 $DIRT-S1 no matter what the final price is.) On top of that, 25% extra $DIRT-S1 will be minted to stay with Dirt to reward contributors. \n\nThe total 10 ETH goal will provide funding for Dirt’s first season of content, including writing, editing, freelancers, marketing, and NFT art. If the net funding is higher, season 1 will last for a longer time and grow the publication further.\n\nAt the end of the season of content, another wave of NFT editions will be released to wrap up season 1. Token holders will have access to rewards from those NFTs if they desire to exchange the tokens, and more NFT sales will fund the development of the next round of Dirt NFT expansion: editorial planning, commissioning more art, and environmental offsets. \n\nFuture rounds of crowdfunding will be based on season-themed tokens, like $DIRT-S2, etc (similar to magazine volumes, which are numbered by year and edition). When the publication is on solid footing, I will create a final $DIRT token and airdrop it proportionally to all holders of all previous tokens as a reward. Early token holders will be given preference in all Dirt token and NFT releases.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1aed684b-ee11-4a10-91e0-b0e2b531992b.jpg?height=500&width=500)\n\n*Art by Jason Adam Katzenstein*\n\nThe purpose of Dirt is to create both an editorial and a visual universe. The publication will coexist with the body of Dirty-focused artwork, which will expand as we keep publishing, collaborating with new artists and designers. This is what will drive the Dirt NFT market and continue funding the publication, plus creating a fun new form of content. \n\n## **10-15ETH Budget**\n\n- **`40%`** commissioning freelance content\n- **`25%`** founders editing and writing \n- **`25%`** art & NFT development\n- **`10%`** marketing & partnerships\n\n**Season 1 runtime**: 1-3 months\n\n## **About the founders**\n\nI am well-equipped to run Dirt as a small publication having already executed it for several months, using my own media-industry background.

A season to celebrate the more personal moments of our ETH history. SAGA introduces a ton of new features and experiences:\n\n*   The SAGA generative algorithm, inspired by GENESIS and other artists\\~\n*   The #MYSAGA experience, a customized gallery experience to highlight your best and most historic moments of your address (or really any address for that matter)\n*   Checkout experience, like shopping on a traditional website. Qe have introduced a checkout style experience: add txns to cart and mint them all in one go!\n*   Larger and discounted supply of txns to offer $HASH at accommodating prices for all kind of collectors!\n\nSAGA is jam packed with new features and experiences. The new supply and pricing mechanic\n\nIn GENESIS, we introduced a novel pricing curve that is dependent to the number of mints that came before. We believe that the pricing curve introduced is fascinating in so many ways and hope to continue to use it, while addressing some of its weaknesses.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a923df2-3791-43bd-ac1e-a18ec8bd1f0c\\_2650x1368.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a923df2-3791-43bd-ac1e-a18ec8bd1f0c\\_2650x1368.png)\n\nOne of the largest issues we noted with the linear price curve, was how fast it priced out a number of users. This was, in the case of GENESIS, by design; we wanted the txns minted as $HASH NFTs to be symbolic and carry weight, and the pricing increase did just that. While it did this part of its job well, we soon realized that $HASH has much more to offer than just capturing our broader history, and to best allow users to capture such nuances of history we needed a slightly better pricing model.\n\nWith that, we decided to introduce in SAGA a new discounted pricing model around minting:\n\n*   Personal txns, ones sent or received by the minting address will be priced at a flat 0.125 ETH.\n\n    *   There will be a supply of 23333 $HASH NFTs reserved for the discounted price.\n\n*   Historic txns, any txn sent by anyone and not related to the minting address will be priced like the GENESIS linear pricing curve. It will start at 0.5 ETH and grow 0.001 ETH a mint.\n\n    *   There will be a supply of 2303 $HASH NFTs reserved for the historic pricing.\n\nIn total, there will be 23333 + 2303 = 25636 SAGA txns minted. Some of them minted via the personal pricing, and some via the historic. How the NFT was minted will be defined in the token metadata, viewable on Opensea and other NFT platforms.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F179ff5dd-5647-4bba-bda7-bc209509b8aa\\_1012x506.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F179ff5dd-5647-4bba-bda7-bc209509b8aa\\_1012x506.png)\n\nWe hope that this new pricing and larger supply will draw a large audience to POB’s $HASH, energizing the community and our spirit to collect our ETH history. Our main goal with season 1 is to celebrate PERSONAL history, the much larger supply of discounted personal txns was chosen in hopes to offer a ton of opportunity for net new people to join the project.\n\n## #MySaga\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b3d7ed-0e2f-4f8f-a4c5-d1acf720ec24\\_2068x1528.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b3d7ed-0e2f-4f8f-a4c5-d1acf720ec24\\_2068x1528.png)\n\nWith a pricing mechanic that emphasizes personal txns, we wanted to offer a unique experience around the story of you and the blockchain.

Dependent to your addresses’s activity, we populate the #MySaga gallery with varying txns: your first contract deploy, largest trade, first uniswap trade, etc. Each #MySaga gallery is curated for each address on the ETH blockchain, so enjoy!\n\n## Batch Minting\n\nWe at POB have a deep passion in building strong experiences around our NFTs; we are product people at heart. With that, we see an opportunity to innovate upon how we mint NFTs via a new batch minting experience inspired by traditional e-commerce checkout flows.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e730323-bbe3-458e-893e-8a1dc44b8bc4\\_642x436.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e730323-bbe3-458e-893e-8a1dc44b8bc4\\_642x436.png)\n\nAdd multiply txns into the cart and decide later, in one go, to mint all of them with one transaction. This hopefully makes it easier for users to collect and curate what they want to see minted, before minting.\n\nDue to some technical + UX limitations, we are only allowing personal txns, with the discounted price, to be added to the cart.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nSAGA has been the product of blood, sweat, tears from the POB team. We put a ton of love into making SAGA unique among the NFT projects and hopefully the exciting new features and SAGA experience reflects our ambition.

By no means are these labels ‘visually’ accurate and only represent what the traits numerically represent. I hope that the following quick read will help explain, in layman terms what these traits suggest about the artwork.\n\n## Texture\n\nPOB leverages a comic book inspired ‘dot texture’ to provide visual complexity to the quarter circles. The effect helps to introduce subtle color changes, noise, and visual focus to the artworks.\n\nTexture in the artwork is loosely derived with the following formula:\n\n    const texture = gasUsed / gasLimit;\n\nWhen gas used is closer to the gas limit, the dot grid is denser and creates a visually ‘smooth’ grain texture.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3df51ac8-afb7-4ee7-9fb0-6b3888cd0b97\\_371x278.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3df51ac8-afb7-4ee7-9fb0-6b3888cd0b97\\_371x278.png)\n\nA smoother grain texture created with the dot texture\n\nHere is an artificially induced ‘low’ texture artwork to help highlight the contrast.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e1b93ad-70af-458c-928e-2c68923bd5a0\\_455x287.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e1b93ad-70af-458c-928e-2c68923bd5a0\\_455x287.png)\n\nSo much SPAAAACE\n\nWith this trait design, hopefully artworks with lower texture values are rarer and more valuable.\n\n## Grid\n\nThe ‘grid’ trait perhaps is the most influential trait.

The lower the gas price, the smaller the grid, and vice-versa.\n\nWith this trait design, hopefully larger more visually ‘strong’ artworks are rarer as high gas price transactions are fewer.\n\n## Complexity\n\nComplexity is a very ambiguous trait. It generally describes the compositional design of the artworks. Should this area be left empty, or that area? Higher complexity doesn’t imply an artwork is visually better, but offers opportunities for more unique outputs.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0c96a96-0b54-4379-94b4-e2b6e18cbd1c\\_1743x985.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0c96a96-0b54-4379-94b4-e2b6e18cbd1c\\_1743x985.png)\n\nComplexity is linearly related to the nonce. The higher the nonce, the higher the complexity value.\n\nWhile complexity value doesn’t tie to an artworks visual quality, it does allow for more interesting artworks. It is left to art speculators and collectors to be the judge of its quality.\n\n## Size Diversity\n\nFor each color palette, the quarter circles are drawn in a number of varying sizes. The chance for larger size circles to occur is linearly related to the amount of ETH transferred in the transaction.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa91a8486-c502-499a-bccb-5576a6d1c532\\_1743x985.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa91a8486-c502-499a-bccb-5576a6d1c532\\_1743x985.png)\n\nThe higher the ETH, the higher the chance you see a diverse collection of quarter circle sizes in the artwork.\n\n## Number of palettes\n\nTo pay homage to proof of work, POB uses a similar mechanism to determine the number of palettes in the artwork.\n\nAll artworks will have two palettes at the minimum. Each palette dictates a layer of quarter circles seen in the artwork. Some transactions will have more palettes. The number of palettes is largely dictated by the number of leading zeros in the hexadecimal hash string.\n\n    // 2 color palettes\n    0x5FC0F...\n    // 3 color palettes\n    0x0AB15...\n    // 8 color palettes ???\n    0x00000...\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b4befda-a0ae-411f-a25a-9c52c1e6dc12\\_940x1514.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b4befda-a0ae-411f-a25a-9c52c1e6dc12\\_940x1514.png)\n\nArtwork with 3 palettes\n\nThe next question to ask: how are the palette colors chosen?\n\nEach color palette is deterministically picked with an address; as in, an Ethereum address maps to a color palette.\n\n    colorPalleteDeterminer(address) => 4 colors;\n\nSome popular addresses are mapped to their own brand colors while most other addresses map to POB’s own collection of palettes.\n\nThe final part: which addresses are used to select the **x** palettes used in the artwork?\n\nThe art process uses this format of addresses:\n\n    [ toAddress, fromAddress, addressFromLogs[0] ... addressFromLogs[x] ]\n\nIf there is one leading zero, then the addresses used would be:\n\n    [ toAddress, fromAddress, addressFromLogs[0]]\n\nColor palette for an address can be easily viewed by the following link:\n\nhttps\\://pob.studio/palette/0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d\n\nInput any address in the place of 0x7a250… to see what color palette you would expect from a transaction that interacts with the address in the link.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cfb83a-52b7-4589-8d13-2ac6b4c7193b\\_681x385.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cfb83a-52b7-4589-8d13-2ac6b4c7193b\\_681x385.png)\n\nTo note, I glanced over some of the design details with how color palettes are selected, consult the code to learn more.\n\nHopefully the trait designs spurs collectors to ‘mine’ and collect artworks that are historically relevant and visually interesting. Some visual features are rarer and may be assessed at a higher value. Getting the ‘just right’ amount of each trait to create a desired aesthetic will be a unique skill developed by a few in the community. These specialists, like historians, can be unique speculators at play in the POB ecosystem.\n\nAgain, this post highlights the general patterns you should expect; to learn about it more in detail, I urge you to skim the IPFS gateway codebase.\n\nFollow us on twitter to learn more about POB, the thinking behind the project, and what is next on the horizons.\n", "timestamp": 1622174085, "digest": "MU9tqPtQBQYnL8Razw5HjF1koltdJDEp9-N6Z6P0AXY", "contributor": "0x9428ca8b5fe52C33BD0BD7222d719d788B6467F4"}

The number of palettes is largely dictated by the number of leading zeros in the hexadecimal hash string.\n\n    // 2 color palettes\n    0x5FC0F...\n    // 3 color palettes\n    0x0AB15...\n    // 8 color palettes ???\n    0x00000...\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b4befda-a0ae-411f-a25a-9c52c1e6dc12\\_940x1514.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b4befda-a0ae-411f-a25a-9c52c1e6dc12\\_940x1514.png)\n\nArtwork with 3 palettes\n\nThe next question to ask: how are the palette colors chosen?\n\nEach color palette is deterministically picked with an address; as in, an Ethereum address maps to a color palette.\n\n    colorPalleteDeterminer(address) => 4 colors;\n\nSome popular addresses are mapped to their own brand colors while most other addresses map to POB’s own collection of palettes.\n\nThe final part: which addresses are used to select the **x** palettes used in the artwork?\n\nThe art process uses this format of addresses:\n\n    [ toAddress, fromAddress, addressFromLogs[0] ... addressFromLogs[x] ]\n\nIf there is one leading zero, then the addresses used would be:\n\n    [ toAddress, fromAddress, addressFromLogs[0]]\n\nColor palette for an address can be easily viewed by the following link:\n\nhttps\\://pob.studio/palette/0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d\n\nInput any address in the place of 0x7a250… to see what color palette you would expect from a transaction that interacts with the address in the link.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cfb83a-52b7-4589-8d13-2ac6b4c7193b\\_681x385.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cfb83a-52b7-4589-8d13-2ac6b4c7193b\\_681x385.png)\n\nTo note, I glanced over some of the design details with how color palettes are selected, consult the code to learn more.\n\nHopefully the trait designs spurs collectors to ‘mine’ and collect artworks that are historically relevant and visually interesting.

Getting the ‘just right’ amount of each trait to create a desired aesthetic will be a unique skill developed by a few in the community.

Come back with the context of the platform in mind.\n\n**TLDR **POB stands for Proof of Beauty, a crypto art experiment where each artwork ($HASH token) represents a transaction hash. The community mints the artworks they deem ‘beautiful’ culturally, historically, or visually.\n\nSo go mint some artworks.\n\nGo mint your first transaction on Ethereum as an artwork.\n\nGo hunting for vitalik’s recent transactions.\n\nGo find the DAO hack transaction.\n\nIt is all up to you, you are part of the artistic process. I, as the creator of POB, have no final say of what becomes a token or not. You mint what is ‘beautiful’.\n\nSo go mint some artworks.\n\nGo mint the transactions of your most successful trade.\n\nGo hunting for the first Eth2 deposits.\n\nGo find the first pool created on Uniswap.\n\n$HASH artworks are generated from the transactions metadata. The gas price controls artistic details, the event logs controls the colors, the nonce controls the ‘visual complexity’ of the artwork. Find, hunt, mine for unique and rare transactions that have specific transaction metadata to perfect your perfect artwork.\n\nSo go mint some artworks.\n\nGo mint the transaction of your first transfer out of Coinbase.\n\nGo hunting for the highest gas price transaction to date.\n\nGo find the first NFT minted.\n\nA minting curve sets a predictable pricing system for minting artworks. The first 1000 artwork are priced at 0.05 ETH. The next costs 0.001 ETH more, then 0.002 ETH, then so on. What does this mean to you? As POB grows and matures as a project, minting new artworks costs more and more (like the block difficulty curve in POW). Jump in early and find meaningful transactions.\n\nSo go mint some artworks.\n\nGo mint the transaction of your largest DEX trade to date.\n\nGo hunting for transactions from side-chain bridge contracts.\n\nGo find the first transaction on Superrare.\n\nPOB’s algorithm is open sourced and stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Fret not, an [IPFS gateway](https://bafybeibzxnahlim2dvxxudfhriajjijm323gv3gvy7g3zpcws5ky4353ye.ipfs.dweb.link/) exists if [pob.studio](https://pob.studio/) were to go down. As long as the Ethereum community stands, POB will exist in one form or another.\n\nSo go mint some artworks.\n\nGo mint your most face-palming, embarrassing transaction.\n\nGo hunting for the first transactions from A16z.\n\nGo find the largest RARI swap on Uniswap.\n\nPOB is a community of many voices and perspectives. Are you an ETH historian collecting the most pivotal transactions in ETH history? Or are you an art miner finding the rarest attributes in $HASH to sell? Or do you want to simply remember your own history in Ethereum? You mint the artworks that mean the most to you.\n\nSo go mint some artworks.\n", "timestamp": 1622174165, "digest": "ayyvOn-5avDzqVZ__0UZOVQSaiWFWnid099Jim0t6Fc", "contributor": "0x9428ca8b5fe52C33BD0BD7222d719d788B6467F4"}

There is no declaration made, no blood boiling war cries against the corporate internet, or some list of commandments about POB culture. \n\nJust a stream of thoughts on what is POB, what to expect in the future, and what not to.\n\nPOB studio is a continual experiment around the intersection of art, culture, and value. $HASH is just the beginning. \n\nThe Ethereum blockchain enables not just financial value or provenance of art tokens, but also something more nuanced. Artists like Pak have pushed this boundary; POB seeks to do the same.\n\nThe blockchain is our communities’ canon, our story, our journey. Data minded folks have revealed a numerical glimpse of the majesty of this cypherpunk experiment through SQL queries and beautiful graphs. \n\nBeyond the multiples of fields, structs, and accounts to analyze, stored between the transactions and blocks is a full spectrum of emotions.\n\nEyes lit up when they saw the UNI or 1INCH token drops withdrawals.\n\nNervous laughter echoed when an ETH crash liquidated their maker vaults.\n\nSighs of relief when a white hack withdrawal kept their portfolio safe for another day.\n\nMoments of curiosity when Beeple’s artwork was sold for record breaking profits.\n\nProof of beauty is a project to capture these moments.\n\nProof of beauty is a project to celebrate our history.\n\nProof of beauty is a project to record our history in emotion.\n\nProof of beauty is a project to question what this chain of blocks mean to us.\n\n—-\n\n$HASH is the first of many tokens under the POB project. As the POB project continues, the $HASH token will evolve into an experience token.\n\nExperience tokens hope to expand the collection of verbs one can use to complete the sentence: I can \\__\\__\\__ with a token.\n\nExpect interesting experiments of what a token can represent from POB. Each their own commentary on our crypto-culture.\n\n—-\n\nPOB is a project crafted by the very community that experiences its creations. POB hopes to continue to create new and novel interactions between the community and its tokens, contracts, and experiences. In many ways, a community interacting with POB is an affirmation of something important worth remembering and experiencing in a new way. One can say every interaction with POB is a ‘proof’ something is ‘beautiful’. (Is that why its named POB???)\n\n—-\n\nDo not expect a perfect POB; as I said earlier, this is an experiment. An experiment-oriented mindset will do well when observing new things coming from POB.\n\nSome tokens or features may anger you, or misalign with certain groups of incentives. (As the recent change to $HASH [exhibits](https://twitter.com/prrfbeauty/status/1356327344085086208?s=20)) \n\nKnow that POB is a project created with empathy, and I (David Sun) hope to do what I can do in my power to make this a project representative of what Ethereum is and aspires to be.\n\nGuess this ended up being a manifesto.\n", "timestamp": 1622174251, "digest": "1VCy2kucDwvPhDnlnZB6O_APFSR5zHsbvkCKf1Fnx3U", "contributor": "0x9428ca8b5fe52C33BD0BD7222d719d788B6467F4"}

What kind of magical complexion of assets, the likes of DAI, the threaded paper of a US Benjamin, or the sheen of a new NFT minted do we find just so beautiful.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Madibaa08/status/1357835996918919172\n\nA conversation on value can go on forever, no amount of time can truly capture this lifelong debate among our human minds.\n\nIn the NFT space, value is a constantly reminded topic. Almost, annoyingly brought up on each corner of the winding street that is crypto-twitter. How does one discover its value? What does time do to its value? Will others see it as valuable, if not more than I do?\n\nInstinctually, we raise our answers to these thoughts with a few parameters:\n\n“Woah, its minted by \\__\\__ famous 3d artist.”\n\n“Damn, that’s a lot of likes and retweets, it must be worth something”\n\n“Ooooo, the rarity of the piece is very high.”\n\n“Good, there is only 100 editions of these pieces.”\n\nAs we process through this loose cacophony of if statements, our minds computes (that may be too generous of a verb) some value, beauty if you will, in this NFT piece.\n\nIn many ways, this internal dialogue is a common one, a conversation we can’t help put on shuffle and repeat.\n\n…\n\nLet’s start over.\n\n…\n\nWhat is value? What is beauty?\n\nIs beauty not just an empathy towards the abstract, the physical, the lustful? Is value not just a vehicle to quantify, dissect such beauty?\n\nWe must return to our self, what is truly beautiful in our lives?\n\nIn many ways, it is the stories we tell and the ones we believe. They give us faith, give us a rubric to view this world and judge what is beautiful, and empower us with the continued breath to fight for change in a universe ever hellbent towards entropy.\n\nWhat is ETH’s story?\n\nThe blockchain.\n\nOur blockchain.\n\n…\n\nThis is our canon, our story, a story unwilling to put up a season finale. One that shaped our beliefs, our world views, and filled us endlessly with emotion.\n\nOur story is beautiful. Our story has value.\n\n“Woah, its minted by \\__\\__”\n\nDoes it matter who minted it? The story is imbued in $HASH already. The transaction it cradles.\n\n“Damn, that’s a lot of likes and retweets, it must be worth something”\n\nYea, it is worth something but also so much more than the digital dopamine kicks social media abuses. Somebody believed this part of our grand story was worth capturing. Either due to greed or sheer awe of our past, somebody took the time to make it come to form as a token.\n\n“Ooooo, the rarity of the piece is very high.”\n\nRarity of $HASH lies in its capacity to be the canon of Ethereum history. As $HASH grows, so do its capacity to honorably represent our history.\n\n“Good, there is only *infinite* pieces”\n\nOur history is every growing and ever evolving. To cap the supply of $HASH feels disingenuous; a sly tactic by the artist to provide stimulus to the $HASH token value. $HASH is valuable. Not because $HASH is. Because our story is.\n\n…\n\n$HASH is an interesting project. One that asks us to look at NFTs, something we thought we are starting to familiarize ourselves with, in a new, potentially uneasy, light.\n\nWhat must we do to hold a $HASH in our private keys?\n\n…\n\nGo on unrelenting rabbit holes on Etherscan?\n\nScrape twitter for the spiciest transactions tucked in replies?\n\nWait patiently for history to be made?\n\nOh, the effort we must summon to capture our history.\n\n$HASH is not beautiful.

A season to celebrate the more personal moments of our ETH history. SAGA introduces a ton of new features and experiences:\n\n*   The SAGA generative algorithm, inspired by GENESIS and other artists\\~\n*   The #MYSAGA experience, a customized gallery experience to highlight your best and most historic moments of your address (or really any address for that matter)\n*   Checkout experience, like shopping on a traditional website. Qe have introduced a checkout style experience: add txns to cart and mint them all in one go!\n*   Larger and discounted supply of txns to offer $HASH at accommodating prices for all kind of collectors!\n\nSAGA is jam packed with new features and experiences. The new supply and pricing mechanic\n\nIn GENESIS, we introduced a novel pricing curve that is dependent to the number of mints that came before. We believe that the pricing curve introduced is fascinating in so many ways and hope to continue to use it, while addressing some of its weaknesses.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a923df2-3791-43bd-ac1e-a18ec8bd1f0c\\_2650x1368.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a923df2-3791-43bd-ac1e-a18ec8bd1f0c\\_2650x1368.png)\n\nOne of the largest issues we noted with the linear price curve, was how fast it priced out a number of users. This was, in the case of GENESIS, by design; we wanted the txns minted as $HASH NFTs to be symbolic and carry weight, and the pricing increase did just that. While it did this part of its job well, we soon realized that $HASH has much more to offer than just capturing our broader history, and to best allow users to capture such nuances of history we needed a slightly better pricing model.\n\nWith that, we decided to introduce in SAGA a new discounted pricing model around minting:\n\n*   Personal txns, ones sent or received by the minting address will be priced at a flat 0.125 ETH.\n\n    *   There will be a supply of 23333 $HASH NFTs reserved for the discounted price.\n\n*   Historic txns, any txn sent by anyone and not related to the minting address will be priced like the GENESIS linear pricing curve. It will start at 0.5 ETH and grow 0.001 ETH a mint.\n\n    *   There will be a supply of 2303 $HASH NFTs reserved for the historic pricing.\n\nIn total, there will be 23333 + 2303 = 25636 SAGA txns minted. Some of them minted via the personal pricing, and some via the historic. How the NFT was minted will be defined in the token metadata, viewable on Opensea and other NFT platforms.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F179ff5dd-5647-4bba-bda7-bc209509b8aa\\_1012x506.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F179ff5dd-5647-4bba-bda7-bc209509b8aa\\_1012x506.png)\n\nWe hope that this new pricing and larger supply will draw a large audience to POB’s $HASH, energizing the community and our spirit to collect our ETH history.

With that, we see an opportunity to innovate upon how we mint NFTs via a new batch minting experience inspired by traditional e-commerce checkout flows.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e730323-bbe3-458e-893e-8a1dc44b8bc4\\_642x436.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e730323-bbe3-458e-893e-8a1dc44b8bc4\\_642x436.png)\n\nAdd multiply txns into the cart and decide later, in one go, to mint all of them with one transaction. This hopefully makes it easier for users to collect and curate what they want to see minted, before minting.\n\nDue to some technical + UX limitations, we are only allowing personal txns, with the discounted price, to be added to the cart.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nSAGA has been the product of blood, sweat, tears from the POB team.

Check out our new studio page at [pob.studio](https://pob.studio/).\n\n$HASH, our first token project will live on [hash.pob.studio](https://hash.pob.studio/)\n\nThis doesn’t change things internally, we are clarifying our studio brand to the public and our relationship with our projects.\n\nPeople seem to interchange POB <> $HASH, this is technically not the case as Proof of Beauty is the studio that creates projects like $HASH.\n\n…\n\nProof of Beauty studios started as a vision, a dream to create a creative vehicle to deliver unique and thoughtful crypto <> culture <> art experiments. This idea initially came to form little over a year ago.\n\nFast forward to now, POB studios released our first project, $HASH. A project to revel in the beauty that is our history. With this release, and its reception from the NFT community, it seems clear to us that our vision for POB has a ton more potential and appears unique in the bustling NFT space.\n\nBefore explaining our philosophy / vision at Proof of Beauty, let’s make this point clear: POB, Proof of Beauty, is NOT $HASH. You will see me refer to $HASH as POB’s $HASH. That is the relation of POB to our projects, we plan to have many sister projects to $HASH as the studio grows. A $HASH NFT is NOT a POB NFT, Proof of Beauty studios has no non-fungible token, or fungible token. When we chat with the community on proposals like [HCIP-2](https://github.com/proofofbeauty/HCIPs/issues/2), we refer to us as another party in the proposal process: POB studios.\n\nAs we continue to release new projects, seasons, and grow as a brand; we hope this distinction becomes clearer and clearer.\n\nBack to our philosophy. It can be best highlighted via 4 overarching principles:\n\n*   Quality art experiences\n*   Novel token mechanics\n*   Well executed project experiences\n*   Strong memetics\n\n**Quality art experiences**\n\nAs a studio, we are first and foremost artists; we love the creation of something that can evoke something more than the strictly pragmatic. This doesn’t mean we will always do generative art, but whatever future medium we choose to leverage, we choose to use such mediums because of the capabilities it enable for us as artists.\n\nTo this, we believe that our art can stand on its own, sans token mechanics, delivery mechanism, or brand. We believe in creating good art first; something that is sensorily impressive and unique. Such a quality rubric is anchored by our principles and world view as art lovers.\n\nWe are ever interested in new and unique mediums, as implied later; we will become a blockchain-agnostic token studio; using varying blockchains for what they can offer to our work. We will explore other mediums, from videography, games, VR+AR, to more traditional tools.\n\n**Novel token mechanics**\n\nAs a token experience studio, we are fundamentally interested in the blockchain as a medium of art. We believe this is an unexplored vector; the blockchain has so much more to offer and believe we can tap into these aspects of our blockchain culture via unique token mechanics.\n\nTo this, we are interested in how token mechanics and the act of tokenizing ELEVATES the experience; this doesn’t mean each new NFT we release re-invents the wheel. More so, I am highlighting the deliberate nature of how we create NFTs and how we deeply ingrain the token itself into the art experience.\n\n**Well executed project experiences**\n\nThe team at POB (small, but a crack team) are at heart front end/product engineers. We love the act of creating unique and fun experiences that people can enjoy. This means that for each project, we place a ton of attention to delivering it to the community in a novel, delightful, and approachable way. This also enables us to react fast to feedback; ever mindful of our time, we can deploy fixes and improvements asked by the community as engineers.\n\nAs our projects get increasingly novel, it is apparent to us we must be good product engineers and work to deliver our ideas and communicate it in the best way possible.\n\n**Strong memetics**\n\nArt and a studio is very much so dependent to the brand it carries and how the community interpret it. To this, at POB studios, we are very interested in exploring what more we can do as a NFT studio. NFTs, in large part are confined to the digital boxes that they are presented in; we are interested in how we can go beyond that. We have ton of interesting and ambitious ideas to bring our NFTs out into the real world; ranging from physical renders to large ambitious projects like a mural. We want our NFTs to be experienced in ways not quite explored by other NFT projects yet.\n\nBeyond the physicality; we are interested in what the NFT represents. We refer to our projects in many ways as units of stories: ways to capture emotions, time, expertise, thought and create a way for communities to come together and share such human moments. To this, it is very important to us to have a vibrant and thoughtful community.\n\nThis deeply affects how we build new projects; we are ever thoughtful of how we can build a community around these projects. We have considered some token-mechanics but some were shot down on the principle of the undesired effects. We believe a good thoughtful and well-intentioned community is more valuable than any quick cash-grab that can be enabled via some fungible token mechanic.\n\nThis doesn’t mean we don’t value our early supporters; we are always thankful and looking at ways to enable and lift up our early supporters of this token experiment. This may mean many things, so stay tuned.\n\nWith these four pillars, we believe that POB studios is in a unique position to offer something unique to the crypto-art community. I am confident to say that we have the focus, interest, motivation, and capacity to execute upon these principles with the exciting roadmap we have planned.\n\nThis doesn’t mean we are correct, better than others, or come with some spirit of crusading. More so, we are excited about what we can offer to the mindshare in the crypto-art space. We are ever inspired by other projects and hop to earn our spot among these ground breaking projects in our community.\n\n…\n\nTo summarize:\n\nProof of Beauty is a studio; we are a creative token studio interested in how we can push tokens further. While Defi projects have pushed the utility of tokens and the capacity to appraise them, we are focused on the emotional, experiential, cultural aspect of tokens.\n\nOur vision + roadmap for POB is filled with new exciting projects, and interesting seasons for different projects. We have some seriously cool things lined up for you all to enjoy. These projects will introduce new ways to relate to our wallets, addresses, assets, the blockchain, and culture.\n\nIf you want to guess what we have in store for the next year (potentially longer):\n\nWE BEGIN BY REMEMBERING HOW WE GOT HERE\n\nNEXT, WE WILL DECIDE WHAT TO SACRIFICE\n\nMAYBE THEN, IT'S TIME TO FIGHT\n\nIS IT ALL JUST A GAME?\n\nMAKE A LEAP OF FAITH\n\n\\-\n\n**PROVING YOU ARE A BEAUTY**\n\nStay excited; POB is just getting started.\n", "timestamp": 1622177171, "digest": "gP7eRro3RFv1LOnNva2fCCRr3qlr7Z3m-aTMicpTzbE", "contributor": "0x9428ca8b5fe52C33BD0BD7222d719d788B6467F4"}

Each NFT derives its visual attributes from the transaction itself.\n\nSAGA, our second season of $HASH, improves upon the design of our previous visual experience employed in GENESIS. For GENESIS holders, you will find the experience familiar but different and in many ways.\n\nTo learn more about how $HASH draws the artworks from the txn, read [this](https://pobstudio.substack.com/p/deciphering-pobs-artistic-process).\n\nBefore going further, GENESIS holders, you can enjoy the new visuals of SAGA by going to your $HASH collection on [hash.pob.studio](https://hash.pob.studio/).\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87972934-1545-4b9c-a123-4b2e50f1ca67\\_1240x618.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87972934-1545-4b9c-a123-4b2e50f1ca67\\_1240x618.png)\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7acbfce-a174-4758-af2d-162e09879d2e\\_1068x472.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7acbfce-a174-4758-af2d-162e09879d2e\\_1068x472.png)\n\nThe same $HASH NFT, but experiencing its visuals in BOTH SAGA and GENESIS.\n\nThrough this blog, I will break down the nuances of the new algorithm, and its implied rarities.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F331c81cd-72b8-470a-a9b6-29974def2cca\\_926x1348.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F331c81cd-72b8-470a-a9b6-29974def2cca\\_926x1348.png)\n\nThe “nutritional label” of SAGA\n\n## Color palettes\n\nAs SAGA is largely designed to celebrate “personal history” we wanted an algorithm that put weight to the addresses that was sending and receiving the txn.\n\nUnlike GENESIS, where we employed a number of colors and color palettes, dependent to number of leading zeros in txn hash, SAGA uses defined palettes of 4 colors, some correlating to the brand color of the addresses, some selected via a pseudo random function.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe743ca83-343a-4b22-ba51-055259501b7b\\_1020x286.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe743ca83-343a-4b22-ba51-055259501b7b\\_1020x286.png)\n\nSAGA’s color palette are determined from the \\`to\\` address field in a txn. This means all txns sent to uniswap will have the signature pink in the artwork, txns with the 0x protocol are green and black, compound finance with rich greens. Hopefully this really allows for the celebration of the txn and the parties involved with it. This interplays deeply to how we want the visual experience itself to suggest the beauty that lies within the txn.\n\n## Num Circles\n\nIn season 0: GENESIS, we introduced a novel rarity mechanic that payed homage to POW consensus via the leadings zeros of a txn hash. We continue this celebration via a new visual attribute: the number of circles drawn in the artwork. All artworks will default to have two circles drawn, for each leading zero a new circle will be added.\n\n    // 2 circles\n    0x5FC0F... \n    // 3 circles\n    0x0AB15... \n    // 6 circles\n    0x0000...\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81c015f2-57a9-4b55-9932-114dda6b8406\\_1908x1342.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81c015f2-57a9-4b55-9932-114dda6b8406\\_1908x1342.png)\n\nA txn minted in season 0, rendered in SAGA\n\nThese circles will not necessarily be visually prioritized, possibly overlapped by other forms. This is left to the whims of the algorithm and how it creates the artworks.\n\n## Texture\n\nLike before, the ‘texture’ you see on the artwork is largely kept the same, with some minor tuning for the new visual look.\n\n    const texture = gasUsed / gasLimit;\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa94f0a49-1686-4fb7-ba0d-85c0446a2169\\_1012x506.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa94f0a49-1686-4fb7-ba0d-85c0446a2169\\_1012x506.png)\n\n## Complexity\n\nSimilar to GENESIS, the txn nonce controls compositional complexity. The higher the nonce, the more likely the artwork will be unique and unlike what we have seen before. Higher txn nonce doesn’t guarantee uniqueness, more so, it guarantees that it is more likely to happen.\n\nSAGA’s algorithm has been designed to be more unique than before, so this trait now is more subjective than ever.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cc9d624-a159-4826-b070-8771428c5fe1\\_1012x506.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cc9d624-a159-4826-b070-8771428c5fe1\\_1012x506.png)\n\n## Shading\n\nThis is a new attribute, one that controls the complexity of the texture seen on the artworks. Higher ‘shading’ values would mean the likelihood of more gradients and interesting gradient effects to occur. The \\`value\\` transferred by the txn controls this attribute. This attribute is extremely subtle, but in some artworks, a defining aspect of its beauty.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd19fe136-0137-40a4-91bb-76bcb275d5c9\\_1012x506.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd19fe136-0137-40a4-91bb-76bcb275d5c9\\_1012x506.png)\n\n## Circle Diversity\n\nA new attribute specific to SAGA, circle diversity is controlled by the gas price. The higher the gas price, the more likely the chance for larger and smaller circles in the piece. This attribute, with leading zeros, can result in stunning and 1-in-a-million chances compositions to occur. Hunting for these txns will likely result in some truly stunning pieces.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66b50876-66ff-418a-90ca-8e6f78a7ac2a\\_730x1168.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66b50876-66ff-418a-90ca-8e6f78a7ac2a\\_730x1168.png)\n\nWoah, a circle in a circle perfectly? That is quite rare!\n\nLike GENESIS, hopefully these attributes, both new and old, will spur collectors to go ‘mine’ for unique artworks that are both historic and rare. Such behavior is the core tenet of $HASH. It has brought so many people together in the celebration of our history. We hope that SAGA does the same and finds new stories untold.\n\nFollow the newsletter to learn more about POB, the thinking behind the project, and what is next on the horizons.\n", "timestamp": 1622177244, "digest": "Ep7nUgI52SGreSLE2-wVEEDZ8wF3wEOkaZDMURl__VU", "contributor": "0x9428ca8b5fe52C33BD0BD7222d719d788B6467F4"}

We believe it would improve it:**\n\n*   Earlier seasons, like a gen 0 cryptokitty, will be increasingly rare in the POB community with future seasons.\n*   Capping the supply should induce some amount of token scarcity to the GENESIS season\n*   New seasons will drive continue growth to $HASH and create a larger community willing to appraise the value of $HASH tokens.\n*   Finally, PRICING DOES NOT change in GENESIS season. The pricing curve stays, its just shut off after 2500 mints.\n\n**Will previous seasons enjoy later seasons experiences with their hashes?**\n\nYes. I can’t say for certain how this will be implemented, but we fully intend to allow earlier seasons to experience later seasons new experiences. The other way around WILL NOT be the case.\n\n**How will the system be decentralized?**\n\nEach season has its corresponding permissions to mint $HASH nfts. After each season is launch, we will revoke our permissions to the season. However, we will continue to retain control of the capacity to create new seasons.\n\n…\n\nIf any of you folks have questions/concerns please DM us on discord, happy to address them.\n\n…\n\nWe believe these changes to $HASH will make a high potential project to a high growth project. We at POB are working to make that come to truth.

Check out our new studio page at [pob.studio](https://pob.studio/).\n\n$HASH, our first token project will live on [hash.pob.studio](https://hash.pob.studio/)\n\nThis doesn’t change things internally, we are clarifying our studio brand to the public and our relationship with our projects.\n\nPeople seem to interchange POB <> $HASH, this is technically not the case as Proof of Beauty is the studio that creates projects like $HASH.\n\n…\n\nProof of Beauty studios started as a vision, a dream to create a creative vehicle to deliver unique and thoughtful crypto <> culture <> art experiments. This idea initially came to form little over a year ago.\n\nFast forward to now, POB studios released our first project, $HASH. A project to revel in the beauty that is our history. With this release, and its reception from the NFT community, it seems clear to us that our vision for POB has a ton more potential and appears unique in the bustling NFT space.\n\nBefore explaining our philosophy / vision at Proof of Beauty, let’s make this point clear: POB, Proof of Beauty, is NOT $HASH. You will see me refer to $HASH as POB’s $HASH. That is the relation of POB to our projects, we plan to have many sister projects to $HASH as the studio grows. A $HASH NFT is NOT a POB NFT, Proof of Beauty studios has no non-fungible token, or fungible token. When we chat with the community on proposals like [HCIP-2](https://github.com/proofofbeauty/HCIPs/issues/2), we refer to us as another party in the proposal process: POB studios.\n\nAs we continue to release new projects, seasons, and grow as a brand; we hope this distinction becomes clearer and clearer.\n\nBack to our philosophy. It can be best highlighted via 4 overarching principles:\n\n*   Quality art experiences\n*   Novel token mechanics\n*   Well executed project experiences\n*   Strong memetics\n\n**Quality art experiences**\n\nAs a studio, we are first and foremost artists; we love the creation of something that can evoke something more than the strictly pragmatic. This doesn’t mean we will always do generative art, but whatever future medium we choose to leverage, we choose to use such mediums because of the capabilities it enable for us as artists.\n\nTo this, we believe that our art can stand on its own, sans token mechanics, delivery mechanism, or brand. We believe in creating good art first; something that is sensorily impressive and unique. Such a quality rubric is anchored by our principles and world view as art lovers.\n\nWe are ever interested in new and unique mediums, as implied later; we will become a blockchain-agnostic token studio; using varying blockchains for what they can offer to our work. We will explore other mediums, from videography, games, VR+AR, to more traditional tools.\n\n**Novel token mechanics**\n\nAs a token experience studio, we are fundamentally interested in the blockchain as a medium of art. We believe this is an unexplored vector; the blockchain has so much more to offer and believe we can tap into these aspects of our blockchain culture via unique token mechanics.\n\nTo this, we are interested in how token mechanics and the act of tokenizing ELEVATES the experience; this doesn’t mean each new NFT we release re-invents the wheel. More so, I am highlighting the deliberate nature of how we create NFTs and how we deeply ingrain the token itself into the art experience.\n\n**Well executed project experiences**\n\nThe team at POB (small, but a crack team) are at heart front end/product engineers. We love the act of creating unique and fun experiences that people can enjoy. This means that for each project, we place a ton of attention to delivering it to the community in a novel, delightful, and approachable way. This also enables us to react fast to feedback; ever mindful of our time, we can deploy fixes and improvements asked by the community as engineers.\n\nAs our projects get increasingly novel, it is apparent to us we must be good product engineers and work to deliver our ideas and communicate it in the best way possible.\n\n**Strong memetics**\n\nArt and a studio is very much so dependent to the brand it carries and how the community interpret it. To this, at POB studios, we are very interested in exploring what more we can do as a NFT studio. NFTs, in large part are confined to the digital boxes that they are presented in; we are interested in how we can go beyond that. We have ton of interesting and ambitious ideas to bring our NFTs out into the real world; ranging from physical renders to large ambitious projects like a mural. We want our NFTs to be experienced in ways not quite explored by other NFT projects yet.\n\nBeyond the physicality; we are interested in what the NFT represents. We refer to our projects in many ways as units of stories: ways to capture emotions, time, expertise, thought and create a way for communities to come together and share such human moments. To this, it is very important to us to have a vibrant and thoughtful community.\n\nThis deeply affects how we build new projects; we are ever thoughtful of how we can build a community around these projects. We have considered some token-mechanics but some were shot down on the principle of the undesired effects. We believe a good thoughtful and well-intentioned community is more valuable than any quick cash-grab that can be enabled via some fungible token mechanic.\n\nThis doesn’t mean we don’t value our early supporters; we are always thankful and looking at ways to enable and lift up our early supporters of this token experiment. This may mean many things, so stay tuned.\n\nWith these four pillars, we believe that POB studios is in a unique position to offer something unique to the crypto-art community. I am confident to say that we have the focus, interest, motivation, and capacity to execute upon these principles with the exciting roadmap we have planned.\n\nThis doesn’t mean we are correct, better than others, or come with some spirit of crusading. More so, we are excited about what we can offer to the mindshare in the crypto-art space. We are ever inspired by other projects and hop to earn our spot among these ground breaking projects in our community.\n\n…\n\nTo summarize:\n\nProof of Beauty is a studio; we are a creative token studio interested in how we can push tokens further. While Defi projects have pushed the utility of tokens and the capacity to appraise them, we are focused on the emotional, experiential, cultural aspect of tokens.\n\nOur vision + roadmap for POB is filled with new exciting projects, and interesting seasons for different projects. We have some seriously cool things lined up for you all to enjoy. These projects will introduce new ways to relate to our wallets, addresses, assets, the blockchain, and culture.\n\nIf you want to guess what we have in store for the next year (potentially longer):\n\nWE BEGIN BY REMEMBERING HOW WE GOT HERE\n\nNEXT, WE WILL DECIDE WHAT TO SACRIFICE\n\nMAYBE THEN, IT'S TIME TO FIGHT\n\nIS IT ALL JUST A GAME?\n\nMAKE A LEAP OF FAITH\n\n\\-\n\n**PROVING YOU ARE A BEAUTY**\n\nStay excited; POB is just getting started.\n", "timestamp": 1622177780, "digest": "gP7eRro3RFv1LOnNva2fCCRr3qlr7Z3m-aTMicpTzbE", "contributor": "0x9428ca8b5fe52C33BD0BD7222d719d788B6467F4"}

Come back with the context of the platform in mind.\n\n**TLDR **POB stands for Proof of Beauty, a crypto art experiment where each artwork ($HASH token) represents a transaction hash. The community mints the artworks they deem ‘beautiful’ culturally, historically, or visually.\n\nSo go mint some artworks.\n\nGo mint your first transaction on Ethereum as an artwork.\n\nGo hunting for vitalik’s recent transactions.\n\nGo find the DAO hack transaction.\n\nIt is all up to you, you are part of the artistic process. I, as the creator of POB, have no final say of what becomes a token or not. You mint what is ‘beautiful’.\n\nSo go mint some artworks.\n\nGo mint the transactions of your most successful trade.\n\nGo hunting for the first Eth2 deposits.\n\nGo find the first pool created on Uniswap.\n\n$HASH artworks are generated from the transactions metadata. The gas price controls artistic details, the event logs controls the colors, the nonce controls the ‘visual complexity’ of the artwork. Find, hunt, mine for unique and rare transactions that have specific transaction metadata to perfect your perfect artwork.\n\nSo go mint some artworks.\n\nGo mint the transaction of your first transfer out of Coinbase.\n\nGo hunting for the highest gas price transaction to date.\n\nGo find the first NFT minted.\n\nA minting curve sets a predictable pricing system for minting artworks. The first 1000 artwork are priced at 0.05 ETH. The next costs 0.001 ETH more, then 0.002 ETH, then so on. What does this mean to you? As POB grows and matures as a project, minting new artworks costs more and more (like the block difficulty curve in POW). Jump in early and find meaningful transactions.\n\nSo go mint some artworks.\n\nGo mint the transaction of your largest DEX trade to date.\n\nGo hunting for transactions from side-chain bridge contracts.\n\nGo find the first transaction on Superrare.\n\nPOB’s algorithm is open sourced and stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Fret not, an [IPFS gateway](https://bafybeibzxnahlim2dvxxudfhriajjijm323gv3gvy7g3zpcws5ky4353ye.ipfs.dweb.link/) exists if [pob.studio](https://pob.studio/) were to go down. As long as the Ethereum community stands, POB will exist in one form or another.\n\nSo go mint some artworks.\n\nGo mint your most face-palming, embarrassing transaction.\n\nGo hunting for the first transactions from A16z.\n\nGo find the largest RARI swap on Uniswap.\n\nPOB is a community of many voices and perspectives. Are you an ETH historian collecting the most pivotal transactions in ETH history? Or are you an art miner finding the rarest attributes in $HASH to sell? Or do you want to simply remember your own history in Ethereum? You mint the artworks that mean the most to you.\n\nSo go mint some artworks.\n", "timestamp": 1622177717, "digest": "ayyvOn-5avDzqVZ__0UZOVQSaiWFWnid099Jim0t6Fc", "contributor": "0x9428ca8b5fe52C33BD0BD7222d719d788B6467F4"}

What kind of magical complexion of assets, the likes of DAI, the threaded paper of a US Benjamin, or the sheen of a new NFT minted do we find just so beautiful.\n\nA conversation on value can go on forever, no amount of time can truly capture this lifelong debate among our human minds.\n\nIn the NFT space, value is a constantly reminded topic. Almost, annoyingly brought up on each corner of the winding street that is crypto-twitter. How does one discover its value? What does time do to its value? Will others see it as valuable, if not more than I do?\n\nInstinctually, we raise our answers to these thoughts with a few parameters:\n\n“Woah, its minted by \\__\\__ famous 3d artist.”\n\n“Damn, that’s a lot of likes and retweets, it must be worth something”\n\n“Ooooo, the rarity of the piece is very high.”\n\n“Good, there is only 100 editions of these pieces.”\n\nAs we process through this loose cacophony of if statements, our minds computes (that may be too generous of a verb) some value, beauty if you will, in this NFT piece.\n\nIn many ways, this internal dialogue is a common one, a conversation we can’t help put on shuffle and repeat.\n\n…\n\nLet’s start over.\n\n…\n\nWhat is value? What is beauty?\n\nIs beauty not just an empathy towards the abstract, the physical, the lustful? Is value not just a vehicle to quantify, dissect such beauty?\n\nWe must return to our self, what is truly beautiful in our lives?\n\nIn many ways, it is the stories we tell and the ones we believe. They give us faith, give us a rubric to view this world and judge what is beautiful, and empower us with the continued breath to fight for change in a universe ever hellbent towards entropy.\n\nWhat is ETH’s story?\n\nThe blockchain.\n\nOur blockchain.\n\n…\n\nThis is our canon, our story, a story unwilling to put up a season finale. One that shaped our beliefs, our world views, and filled us endlessly with emotion.\n\nOur story is beautiful. Our story has value.\n\n“Woah, its minted by \\__\\__”\n\nDoes it matter who minted it? The story is imbued in $HASH already. The transaction it cradles.\n\n“Damn, that’s a lot of likes and retweets, it must be worth something”\n\nYea, it is worth something but also so much more than the digital dopamine kicks social media abuses. Somebody believed this part of our grand story was worth capturing. Either due to greed or sheer awe of our past, somebody took the time to make it come to form as a token.\n\n“Ooooo, the rarity of the piece is very high.”\n\nRarity of $HASH lies in its capacity to be the canon of Ethereum history. As $HASH grows, so do its capacity to honorably represent our history.\n\n“Good, there is only *infinite* pieces”\n\nOur history is every growing and ever evolving. To cap the supply of $HASH feels disingenuous; a sly tactic by the artist to provide stimulus to the $HASH token value. $HASH is valuable. Not because $HASH is. Because our story is.\n\n…\n\n$HASH is an interesting project. One that asks us to look at NFTs, something we thought we are starting to familiarize ourselves with, in a new, potentially uneasy, light.\n\nWhat must we do to hold a $HASH in our private keys?\n\n…\n\nGo on unrelenting rabbit holes on Etherscan?\n\nScrape twitter for the spiciest transactions tucked in replies?\n\nWait patiently for history to be made?\n\nOh, the effort we must summon to capture our history.\n\n$HASH is not beautiful. We are.\n", "timestamp": 1622177889, "digest": "gTXiEDXWmEFQdtrmsduNul63Wpk6Ipe8-soeN_86QtU", "contributor": "0x9428ca8b5fe52C33BD0BD7222d719d788B6467F4"}

We couldn’t be happier with how people are exploring our history and finding the most important bits of our, your, history worth tokenizing.\n\nIn many ways, $HASH is a project that reflects ourselves. If you are a NFT collector, you are naturally drawn to the visual rarities of the artwork and historic NFT events. If you have created your own projects, you are drawn to the history you have created. To say that $HASH is just a non-fungible token doesn’t do justice to what it truthfully captures about its owner.\n\nWith this all in mind, we believe that $HASH has a ton of potential in growing well beyond its current scale. We also hope to tap into a huge cache of creative ideas/generative algorithms ideas we have in mind at POB to create cooler experiences for the POB community.\n\n## Enter seasons.\n\nPreviously, $HASH was designed with a limited vision in mind; one visual algorithm, infinite supply of one visual experience.\n\nWe are moving to a different model around ‘seasons’, inspired by the seasonality seen in fashion brands.\n\nWe are making a few changes to the current $HASH experience:\n\n*   This is season 0, GENESIS.\n*   The pricing curve has not changed one bit.\n*   Only 2500 GENESIS edition $HASH NFTs will ever exist.\n\nAfter each season reaches its max mintable supply, we will be heads down working/releasing the next season for the community to enjoy.

{"id": "2HtshrqszEC5Fr0V9Vhu-0e4Vxwpofto7wcf53nejd4", "title": "Introducing JPG: the New Media Curation protocol", "body": "\n[JPG ![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/85921601-538b-4eb6-8a8e-993b94d7824a.png?height=622&width=1194)\n\nWe are happy to introduce Juried Protocol Galleries (JPG), a registry-based curation protocol that brings together collectors, curators, and artists. The JPG registry is a new primitive for the NFT ecosystem, allowing owners to make their NFTs available for sale and display in partnership with curators. Designed as an open protocol, JPG provides the foundation for a community-generated network of galleries and a new, decentralized marketplace for both primary and secondary sales.\n\n## The Protocol/The What\n\nThe core of the JPG protocol consists of a main registry, populated by NFT owners, and sub-registries, created by curators, that serve as exhibitions. Anyone can add their NFTs to the JPG registry by submitting proof of ownership and accompanying token data. The NFT never leaves the owner's wallet. Curators can then select works from the main registry to include in their exhibitions via sub-registries.\n\nThe JPG protocol also offers marketplace functionality that allows NFT owners to list their works for sale through the gallery system. If a curator sells a work in their exhibition, they earn a commission on that sale, similar to traditional art galleries and existing NFT platforms but now open to all.\n\nJPG allows NFT owners to give a specific curator address or list of addresses the sole rights to curate their work. If no 'allow list' is set, an NFT can be included on multiple sub-registries simultaneously. This allows owners to choose whether they want wide distribution or exclusivity. It also enables curators to build unique, high quality offerings and work directly with artists to organize primary sales exhibitions.\n\n## The Curation/The Why\n\nAn opt-in, on-chain NFT registry has many valuable use cases, but the JPG team is most excited about its potential to expand the possibilities for curation in the NFT ecosystem. The platforms that exist today generally exhibit one of two models: either they follow a high quality, high exclusivity approach which gives them curatorial control, or they take a more open, inclusive path that eschews curation altogether. JPG offers a third way, handing tools directly to the community so that anyone can curate exhibitions and become a tastemaker.\n\nCuration is an integral part of every cultural economy, conferring meaning and value on objects through the thoughtful use of context and display. While the past decade has liberated curation from its status as a specialist practice, the growth of the NFT market has caused an ever greater blurring between the roles of the curator and the private collector. At JPG we believe that curators don't have to be collectors, and that a truly decentralized culture is only possible when everyone, regardless of what they own, can share new perspectives and experiences through the exhibition medium. The JPG protocol has been developed with precisely this in mind.\n\n## The Future\n\nWe foresee JPG growing into a vibrant network of galleries that serves every corner of the NFT ecosystem. Since the JPG registry is a flexible primitive, we are building in an open and permissionless way so that other applications will grow on top of us. Some of these, such as curation DAOs that vote on exhibited works, will tie in more closely with the original gallery framework, while others might include aggregated interfaces, ranked lists, second-layer registries, plug-and-play experiences, and more.\n\nOver the coming days and weeks, we will be deploying the JPG protocol, accepting submissions for our first exhibition, DEEP TIME, and launching curator beta testing.\n\nIn the meantime, join the JPG community on Discord [here](https://discord.gg/dna65t9rNP), and stay tuned for contract deployment and 'Add to Registry' functionality.\n\n## The Team\n\nThe JPG team is led by [Trent Elmore](https://twitter.com/_trente_), [María Paula Fernandez](https://twitter.com/MPtherealMVP), and [Sam Spike](https://twitter.com/jpegyguggenheim), with smart contracts developed by [Sam Bauch](https://twitter.com/sammybauch).\n\nWe are currently seeking Designers, Front End Engineers, and Smart Contract Engineers to join the JPG team.

It happened in 1747, when James Lind ran a controlled scientific study — maybe the first ever — and discovered that citrus fruits cured scurvy. \n\nIn Lind’s day, scurvy killed more British sailors than **\"shipwreck, storms, all other diseases, and enemy action combined”**. Which is to say that Lind's cure was not just going to save countless lives; it was an incomparably powerful *military technology*. The stakes couldn't have been higher. And yet, despite having been proven with the most advanced scientific methods the world had ever seen, **it was promptly lost** for many decades after. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/336e837a-bf15-493c-a3fd-c6703670af85.jpeg?height=512&width=1254)\n\nAccording to British Historian [C.C. Lloyd](https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/hemila/history/Lloyd_1963.pdf), the British might have “lost the American War of Independence thirty years [after Lind’s study] because his cure was not adopted”. If Lloyd’s suggestion is correct, the discounted net assets of America is what gives you a roughly $1,000,000,000,000 bill that the British may have just left lying on the ground.\n\nWe will return to why and how this happened later. But for now let’s just observe that **the incentives for the production and dissemination of scientific truths are often really, really poor.** And so, as a result, humanity can lose even the most consequential truth. \n\n## Enter NFTs\n\nThe idea that NFTs could help rescue enormous scientific truths from obscurity might strike you as a little fanciful. You might even think... \"aren't NFTs just some hyped-up blockchain art thing? Why should they help science funding at all?\" So to start with let's take the simplest argument, and here we'll just quote it from our [2018 essay on NFTs for Science](https://glyphx.medium.com/post-venture-capital-and-the-crypto-nobel-prize-29847faf3f08):\n\n> Historically, great knowledge is valued like great art. Bill Gates paid $40 million for Leonardo Da Vinci’s Codex Leicester. Einstein’s manuscripts sell for millions. And a single page of Darwin’s writing fetches hundreds of thousands of dollars[...] People buy Darwin’s original pages because they are connected to his idea — the fact that information from The Origin of Species is freely available is not a bug for its high value; it’s a feature. Today’s Darwin would type The Origin of the Species in a Google Doc or a versioned LaTeX file... But now with Planck, and the digital scarcity blockchain enables, she would create a unique Glyph [NFT] that serves as that first manuscript copy.\n\nThis \"science as art\" argument received some validation last month when we sold the first scientific result NFT (for $24,000). But we believe that this is just the beginning, and have been testing ways in which funds and proceeds from NFTs can be channeled to improve science funding more broadly. The aim, ultimately, is to enable progress and to try to help save some of the consequential ideas we might otherwise lose.\n\nWithin this essay we are auctioning off an NFT as a small  test of the SplitStream, and incentive design for funding science through citations. To explain, let us first outline the project this NFT is a part of. Last month, after designing and crowdsourcing the first ever randomized control test of a long-untested theory, Planck sold the result as [the aforementioned first science NFT](https://twitter.com/stephensonhmatt/status/1377316537950932992). These funds will help us run a replication of the study we ran. Here is something nice that a very smart person said about the project:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3a5983a6-915e-4fa7-997c-3a8a8c47a3db.jpeg?height=742&width=1178)\n\nBecause we are interested in incentives for consequential ideas that it seemed possible we might lose, we looked for a promising candidate for the test. The most promising candidate we found was the late Berkeley Professor Seth Roberts' appetite theory.\n\n## Testing Seth Roberts' Appetite Theory\n\nIn 2004, Berkeley Professor Seth Roberts discovered that consuming flavorless calories reduced his appetite. Consuming flavorless or unfamiliar calories made his eating habits more consciously controllable and helped him lose weight. And beyond weight loss, such a tool for conscious eating seemed to have the potential to help people eat more nutritious food, more easily go vegan, etc. Though preliminary, it was an enormous discovery.\n\nSeth was a serious empirical scientist and the [evidence he published for his theory was intriguing, if unorthodox](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866). But some very credible sources recognized the merit of his work and he was featured positively in the [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/magazine/does-the-truth-lie-within.html). His book became a bestseller. \n\nGlowing anecdotes appeared, including [a notable one from Reddit co-founder Aaron Swartz](https://5shz4jubhf5ju22lobejiotjv36et7td242q7nz6tx3puyuilcba.arweave.net/7I-eJoE5epprS3BIlDpprvxJ_mPXNQ-3Pp32-mKIWII). In that essay, Swartz confidently alludes to the \"clinical trials\" that would surely be carried out on Seth's Theory. **His essential optimism, his confidence that the world would obviously figure out a way to run a clinical test on something so promising, is striking**. \n\nBut the lab studies never came.\n\nWithin 5 years of its publication Seth’s idea had become little-discussed, never having undergone a single clinical trial. Some important outlets like [Marginal Revolution](https://zt3lipqi5yc4exoyclfunv7v2ws7hdmfmx6aeczs4hi2fzsgpaja.arweave.net/zPa0PgjuBcJd2BLLRtf11aXzjYVl_AILMuHRouZGeBI) [LessWrong](https://44zxnconwtyyk4ulw3bmvfq5fl5eeeyjft5yltiq3fdrsrt7kxqa.arweave.net/5zN2ic208YVyi7bCypYdKvpCEwks-4XNENlHGUZ_VeA), and [StatModeling](https://sbwt4p5ujwzqpk3543m24cn7wgrgrpmzvhcmg4u6fmpnkf55v2nq.arweave.net/kG0-P7RNswerfebZrgm_saJovZmpxMNynise1Re9rps) kept the flame alive, but the discussion of Seth's theory all but vanishes:\n\n![Google Searches for Seth Roberts' Theory over time](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/27863775-b21c-4641-a1c3-dd9a6ad63131.jpeg?height=664&width=2284)\n\nBy 2017, a few years after Seth had passed away, Neurobiologist Stephan Guyenet wrote that he expected to remain forever “puzzled” by Seth’s theory because “some sort of research” on it was “unlikely to ever happen.” Stephan’s answer reads more than a bit tragic; obesity kills [millions each year](https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/6-facts-on-obesity), interest in using conscious eating to help improve the world, as in vegetarianism, is skyrocketing. Failing to follow up on a promising theory in such a world feels a bit like an echo of our tragic failure to follow up on James Lind's scurvy cure. \n\n## Why Do We Lose Ideas?\n\n> \"Show me the incentive and I'll show you the result.\" - Charlie Munger\n\nJames Lind's scurvy cure [didn't mesh well with the science of 1747](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312313920). Science was then 150 years away from discovering vitamins and so, naturally, it would have been hard to understand how it was the vitamin C in citrus that was the cure. The top minds of the day, viewing Lind's results, quickly came to believe that the acid in the juice must be melting some big black scurvy blob that sailors got in their stomachs. \"Great!\" they said, \"let's boil the juice to make it more acidic and work even better!\"\n\nUnfortunately, as we now understand, boiling the juice just destroys the Vitamin C content. Which means the boiled \"cure\" was no cure at all. Now there is nothing wrong about this; it's just good old normal science seeking understanding and trying out hypotheses. And 150 years later this did give us understanding, and that understanding was bigger than a simple cure for scurvy. The problem is that **somehow for the intervening 150 years everyone didn't just go back to using the limes that were proven to work**. \n\nIf Seth’s Theory proves out I think the story will be much the same as Lind's. Theories, like those of Seth Roberts and James Lind, which happen to integrate poorly with existing science of their day are bound to suffer. By failing to integrate into science they lose out on what is surely humanity's best protocol for rewarding, preserving, and developing openly shared knowledge. Patents might offer an alternative, but Seth's and Lind's theories were also hopelessly unpatentable. Citrus fruits are freely available and \"flavorless calories\" are easier to come by still; like a good scientist, Seth even set about demonstrating that a person could just [hold their nose](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/shangrila-diet-phenomenol_b_58958) as they ate and get the desired effect. Good luck writing that patent. \n\n## Demonstrating How NFTs can Help Fund Unpatentable Science\n\nWhen we first wrote about using NFTs as a unique way to fund science, Seth's was one of the major motivating cases. Here's how the simplest mechanism was intended to help fund such research:\n\n1. NFTs of high-potential scientific work are sold\n2. These NFTs, like a collectible, could grow in stature and value as the scientific work was validated\n3. Prospective NFT sales of early scientific results could thereby profitably fund the validation of that research\n\nAs mentioned earlier, our current project is bearing this out: Planck crowdsourced the first ever randomized control trial of Seth Roberts' appetite theory, sold an NFT of the result, and are now using the proceeds to run an independent lab replication of the findings. \n\nIt's important to keep in mind the bigger picture here though. We hope Seth's theory is true (who wouldn't?), but our fundamental concern regards the incentives themselves. To become a full-fledged scientific truth a theory needs to be exposed to falsification. So it's worth remembering that, while our preliminary results on Seth's Theory are promising, every step along the journey is important, as are the incentives to take those steps.\n\nIn this essay, we are introducing a novel incentive structure for scientific funding that uses citations as a channel for funding. We were calling this a \"CitationStream\" but piggybacking on [Jon-Kyle's terminology in his excellent essay](https://jk.mirror.xyz/3iLll7F39DjeVlJo4XNlfunl-C0xD3l2X8sjIJoB9vc), we are going to call it a “SplitStream”. The SplitStream is a system in which portions of an NFT sale may flow to some or all of the works the NFT cites, with those cited works then sending some of their funds further along to the works they cite, and so on. \n\n## The SplitStream\n\nYou might know the quote “If I have seen further, it is from standing on the shoulders of giants”. You might also know that it’s from Isaac Newton, a giant if there ever was one. So **in science, giants tend to look down and see other giants**. Citations, when they work, map those dependencies backwards through time. \n\nCitations on citations. \n\nGiants all the way down.\n\nIf you send funds through these citations, you get a cascade. A stream of splits. A SplitStream. \n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9dfd5cba-c828-461c-b0d5-2be765a465bb.jpeg?height=684&width=592)\n\nWe ran a test of this with an NFT of an independent data analysis of Seth’s Appetite Theory, selling for $4,200. We suspect this was the first ever funding of an independent data analysis! As a part of this independent analysis we were able to demo a powerful cryptographic technology from [Aleo](https://www.aleo.org/) which we believe will be very useful to further open science. We used a Zero-knowledge Proof in Leo to enable independent statisticians to effectively \"query\" our dataset and see certain results without revealing the data itself. \n\nIndependent Analysis is a really valuable thing, and it is a [cutting edge Open Science best practice](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646). The analysis was conducted by two esteemed professors of statistics, Harry Crane and Ryan Martin, and thus the NFT was theirs with proceeds directed according to them. We requested that they keep 50% of the NFT sale but they agreed to test the SplitStream and, for the purposes of this incentive test, their analysis “cites” two NFTs:\n\nThe NFT of the Open Science Test of Seth’s Appetite Theory (currently owned by [Molecule](https://opensea.io/accounts/Molecule_to))\nThe NFT of the Splitstream Protocol (owned by Planck) \n\nPlanck then split our proceeds further to what we are citing:\n1. Mirror because we are using their amazing platform and tech. \n2. [This Artwork is Always on Sale](https://thisartworkisalwaysonsale.com/), suggested by Simon De La Rouvier as the proper target for the citation of his shared idea of Harberger taxes for NFT ownership (which is an important aspect of our protocol.)\n\nWe encourage the recipients of these proceeds, if they are at all substantial, to split back to those they would cite. Let's also note that this is a simple test of the mechanism and certainly does not represent the full range of actual citations we would use. Here is the NFT, an elegant violin plot of the results from the study we ran:\n\n[Token #2837](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2837)\n\n## Design Challenges for the SplitStream\n\nAs a trained academic, I could hardly discuss a mechanism like the SplitStream without noting some potential pitfalls. Properly done, this has great potential to reward an effective division of labor in for open science and more. But it does not create obligations, or promises, or contracts, or anything like that. Participants are playing, roughly speaking, [a live trust game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PO3MTV0ZeA).\n\nAnd in fact, these incentives cannot become too enshrined and formal because citations are a fragile system. **A person’s inspiration is purely their private knowledge and thus it *must* be shared voluntarily.** A system which can't elicit honest attributions will fail.\n\nFor example, you could imagine that many people might appreciate being credited as the essential inspiration for a new Nobel-prize winning discovery in physics. Someone with sufficient resources, some prestige-hungry Jeff Bezos, might even be willing to pay for that honor. And then, of course, there’s nothing to stop our Nobel-winning physicist from claiming that her passing conversation with the dear leader Bezos was the fundamental inspiration for everything. Who could say otherwise? This sort of thing is absolutely going to happen sometimes, just as it sometimes happens in academia. \n\nI’m going to call these types of behaviors “Mao effects”: the seeking of favor from those with status or power by over-attributing to them. Mao of course was named the “great helmsman”, the “great leader”, etc. and anything good that happened was often attributed to him. **A network overtaken by these Mao effects breaks down, a Ponzi-scheme for those who claim complete originality.**\n\nIn an evolutionary simulation it roughly looks like this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3ba8b293-998f-4069-8c0c-d95e7ea9d006.jpeg?height=850&width=1100)\n\nThese effects can get more subtle as well. I can’t do much more here than sort of gesture at this and signal that I take these ideas seriously (e.g. [I actually coauthored a Behavioral Economics literature review called “When Do Monetary Incentives Backfire”](https://vr24zefnxcqg7hctadpx7dzmv3zq64oqodfcaiv2zwskewovtlna.arweave.net/rHXMkK24oG-cUwDff48srvMPcdBwyiAius2kolnVmto)). But a simple step toward preventing Mao Effects is observing the following two rules:\n\n1. Favor citing things which are publicly shared.\n2. Favor citing things which also cite. \n\nThe first condition helps provide a level of transparency and sense-making to the system. So, for instance, you can understand why I cite Mirror because you can clearly see that I'm using their tech. The second condition helps ensure that cited works offer further attribution to the work they've built on. Together these rules help ensure that a would-be Mao openly shares their knowledge while also citing that which contributed to it. More is needed if we are to one day get this right, but we hope it's a start.\n\nTwitter @stephensonhmatt\np1anck.com", "timestamp": 1622224288, "digest": "vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg", "contributor": "0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6", "nft": "{\"nftTransactionHash\": \"0xa7d518b7a12a005c4941a88709349ace127f2e37efa3467a7ddef9b7ffa6a852\"}"}

However, the smart contracts are only the first piece of the puzzle, and we're setting out to fill in the blueprints for anyone to spin up and remix their own auction house experience.\n\nCreators and curators can now seamlessly create their own permissionless, customizable auction house experiences. Zora has created a suite of technical tools for accessing, rendering, and contextualizing both auction information and media information. \n\nThese libraries are open for the world to use and improve – MIT-licensed and developed in public. \n\nThis code is free to use, inspect, remix, and to make your own.\n\n## Foundation + Scaffolding: Accessing the data\n\nFetching blockchain data is difficult – we have wrapped all the difficult work of fetching and organizing blockchain data of the Zora Auction House and Media into our `@zoralabs/nft-hooks` library. This library makes fetching media and auctions a one-line React or Javascript library call. [This library](https://docs.zora.co/zoraos/dev/media-rendering/nft-hooks) will allow for rapid building of auction houses that have a strong, shared foundation.\n\nhttps://github.com/ourzora/nft-hooks\n\n## Key features of `nft-hooks`:\n\n- 🌐 Decodes blockchain auction data status and pricing information\n- 💰 USD and ETH values are associated from Uniswap\n- ✨ Intelligently handles caching and batching\n- 🌈 Gracefully handles rendering and loading states\n- ⚙️ Configuration-optional: works out of the box\n- 🧰 Works both in server and client-side environments\n- 🛠 Allows for server-side cached data rehydration and revalidation\n\n## Finishings: Building the user interface\n\nEven with all the data, web3 is about interaction with user interfaces in browsers. We've followed up the `nft-hooks` library with `nft-components`. These libraries go hand in hand - components show data that is fetched from NFT hooks. `nft-components` creates an accessible design language and flexible auction-focused components to seamlessly integrate NFTs and marketplaces into community and artist's spaces.\n\nThese components work with minimal code to get started and provide a full suite of features to render all the details found on the Zora's full data page and all the information shown on the Zora thumbnail view as well.\n\n[This library](http://ourzora.github.io/nft-components/) is also open and owned by the community, pulling in as few external dependencies as possible. The theming, text, styles, and media supported are completely configurable by the user while also working with zero configuration out-of-the-box.\n\n**Features:**\n- 🖼 Handles displaying text, audio, video, and image content types\n    - Includes play/pause/mute/un-mute functionality\n- ⏳ Handles partially loaded content gracefully\n- 💅 Supports theming, translation, and complete styling\n- 🎁 Full preset components can be used or broken down elements with custom data display elements are available.\n\n## Make it your own\n\nMuch like how Uniswap gave anyone the ability to create their own exchange, Zora gives anyone the ability to create their own Auction Houses. You can create an Auction House that can curate and auction any and all ERC721 tokens. \n\nThis means there is an entirely new universe of experiences that can be created. \n\nHere are some Auction House ideas:\n- Generative art\n- Decentralized Land\n- Fonts\n- AR Objects\n- DAO-owned\n- Anything, really ✨\n\nLooking ahead, we're planning on removing further barriers for individuals to participate in the NFT ecosystem. Soon, to make your own auction house, coding will be optional. \n\n### Resources\n\n**Javascript SDK**\nhttps://docs.zora.co/zoraos/dev/zdk/auction-house\n\n**Smart Contracts**\nhttps://github.com/ourzora/auction-house\n\n**NFT Hooks**\nhttps://github.com/ourzora/nft-hooks\n\n**Subgraph**\nhttps://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/ourzora/zora-v1\n\n### Join the Community\n\nAs you’re building, we’re here to help!

The JPG registry is a new primitive for the NFT ecosystem, allowing owners to make their NFTs available for sale and display in partnership with curators. Designed as an open protocol, JPG provides the foundation for a community-generated network of galleries and a new, decentralized marketplace for both primary and secondary sales.\n\n## The Protocol/The What\n\nThe core of the JPG protocol consists of a main registry, populated by NFT owners, and sub-registries, created by curators, that serve as exhibitions. Anyone can add their NFTs to the JPG registry by submitting proof of ownership and accompanying token data. The NFT never leaves the owner's wallet. Curators can then select works from the main registry to include in their exhibitions via sub-registries.\n\nThe JPG protocol also offers marketplace functionality that allows NFT owners to list their works for sale through the gallery system. If a curator sells a work in their exhibition, they earn a commission on that sale, similar to traditional art galleries and existing NFT platforms but now open to all.\n\nJPG allows NFT owners to give a specific curator address or list of addresses the sole rights to curate their work. If no 'allow list' is set, an NFT can be included on multiple sub-registries simultaneously. This allows owners to choose whether they want wide distribution or exclusivity. It also enables curators to build unique, high quality offerings and work directly with artists to organize primary sales exhibitions.\n\n## The Curation/The Why\n\nAn opt-in, on-chain NFT registry has many valuable use cases, but the JPG team is most excited about its potential to expand the possibilities for curation in the NFT ecosystem. The platforms that exist today generally exhibit one of two models: either they follow a high quality, high exclusivity approach which gives them curatorial control, or they take a more open, inclusive path that eschews curation altogether. JPG offers a third way, handing tools directly to the community so that anyone can curate exhibitions and become a tastemaker.\n\nCuration is an integral part of every cultural economy, conferring meaning and value on objects through the thoughtful use of context and display. While the past decade has liberated curation from its status as a specialist practice, the growth of the NFT market has caused an ever greater blurring between the roles of the curator and the private collector. At JPG we believe that curators don't have to be collectors, and that a truly decentralized culture is only possible when everyone, regardless of what they own, can share new perspectives and experiences through the exhibition medium. The JPG protocol has been developed with precisely this in mind.\n\n## The Future\n\nWe foresee JPG growing into a vibrant network of galleries that serves every corner of the NFT ecosystem. Since the JPG registry is a flexible primitive, we are building in an open and permissionless way so that other applications will grow on top of us. Some of these, such as curation DAOs that vote on exhibited works, will tie in more closely with the original gallery framework, while others might include aggregated interfaces, ranked lists, second-layer registries, plug-and-play experiences, and more.\n\nOver the coming days and weeks, we will be deploying the JPG protocol, accepting submissions for our first exhibition, DEEP TIME, and launching curator beta testing.\n\nIn the meantime, join the JPG community on Discord [here](https://discord.gg/dna65t9rNP), and stay tuned for contract deployment and 'Add to Registry' functionality.\n\n## The Team\n\nThe JPG team is led by [Trent Elmore](https://twitter.com/_trente_), [María Paula Fernandez](https://twitter.com/MPtherealMVP), and [Sam Spike](https://twitter.com/jpegyguggenheim), with smart contracts developed by [Sam Bauch](https://twitter.com/sammybauch).\n\nWe are currently seeking Designers, Front End Engineers, and Smart Contract Engineers to join the JPG team.

It follows the guidelines I described in my [previous sketch on Mirror](https://air.mirror.xyz/bTAwqOAe2vG6UIq5KSPrEho_VbrfDxcswm0ZuUtPGAc). The plan is to turn [Dirt](https://dirt.substack.com), a daily newsletter on streaming and entertainment that I've been developing, into a major voice on digital culture. \n\nTo participate, you can buy Dirt’s new animated NFTs of the [newsletter’s mascot, Dirty](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-introducing-dirty-lockdown-blues). You’ll get the NFT art as well as an airdropped commensurate number of $DIRT-S1 tokens as a reward. There are three versions of NFT: a Pea Green edition of 100, a Pearl Pink edition of 30, and a special Rainbow Wave, which is a single NFT. The 100 edition will get a reward of 50 $DIRT-S1 tokens, the 30 edition 200, and the unique NFT will be auctioned off and the winner will be rewarded 1000 tokens. \n\nThe goal is to crowdfund about 10-15ETH total with NFT edition sales. The funding will go toward paying for editors, writers, artists, and environmental offsets for the entire project. At the end of season 1 of Dirt, we’ll release another round of Dirty NFTs as prizes for $DIRT-S1 holders. Crowdfunders will also get transparent reports on the publication's growth and progress, as well as input on what to cover, writing opportunities, and early access to later NFT and token drops, with conversations held over a listserv. The NFT editions are below, with a detailed explanation of the plan. \n\nBy supporting this project, you’ll help create the first NFT-driven newsletter and demonstrate what is possible with NFT culture, with a front-row seat to the results.\n\n## **Support the project**\n\n### Dirty S1 Rainbow Wave\n*1/1 — Auction at 1ETH*\nReward of 1000 $DIRT-S1 tokens per NFT\n\n### Dirty S1 Pearl Pink\n*30/30 — 0.2ETH*\nReward of 200 $DIRT-S1 tokens per NFT\n— *Pearl Pink buyers will also have their name listed and Twitter handle or website linked in the footer of all Dirt newsletters as Season 1 supporters.*\n\n### Dirty S1 Pea Green\n*100/100 — 0.05ETH*\nReward of 50 $DIRT-S1 tokens per NFT\n\n*All NFT art by [Mark Costello](http://markalancostello.com/)*\n\n[Token #3309](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3309)\n\n[Dirty S1 Pearl Pink](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=3)\n\n*Pearl Pink buyers will also have their name listed and Twitter handle or website linked in the footer of all Dirt newsletters as Season 1 supporters.*\n\n[Dirty S1 Pea Green](edition://0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175?editionId=2)\n\n\n## **What is Dirt?**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c25ede72-4603-4ba2-b487-34402cfd07a0.jpg?height=1074&width=4400)\n\n[Dirt](dirt.substack.com) is a free daily morning newsletter about entertainment broadly, covering streaming TV; YouTube and TikTok; and any kind of interesting digital culture, including NFTs and digital assets. Popular past editions include [TikTok and suburban aesthetics](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-tiktok-and-suburban-gothic) and a [review of a podcast about pasta](https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-the-pasta-is-content). The newsletter is anchored by me ([Kyle Chayka](http://kylechayka.com), author and writer for The New Yorker and many other publications as well as co-founder of [Study Hall](studyhall.xyz), a small media company) with contributions from writer [Daisy Alioto](https://www.daisyalioto.com/) (Vox, Paris Review, Longreads) and other freelance writers.\n\nSince launching in December 2021, Dirt has gained 3,600+ organic newsletter subscribers and has been linked to by websites from the Financial Times to Axios and Slate. It is now an established publication in the media landscape, tweeted and shared by influential writers. It has a 40%+ open rate and gets 3,000+ views daily. Readers include executives from Netflix and HBO.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa2f806d-33bf-4614-a4b0-e7aed6de8fb5.png?height=1150&width=1490)\n\n*Dirt's subscriber growth*\n\nDirt’s tone is accessible and educational, building a broader awareness of digital culture through smart criticism and analysis. It’s about creating engaged entertainment consumers and hosting good dialogue in a digestible format. It is developing an active community of both writers and readers — imagine [The Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/) of digital / streaming culture. Traditional subscription funding supports content that many people already agree on; NFT crowdfunding patronage systems will support more radical and innovative content like Dirt. \n\nThe archive of Dirt posts can be [found here](https://dirt.substack.com/). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f9c17e0a-3474-4662-9c59-18a44a7d276f.png?height=1348&width=1582)\n\n## Dirt growth plan\n\nWith the funding from the new NFT sales, Dirt will commission new freelance contributions, grow the email list, and aggressively cover digital culture, including NFTs, video games, [Metaverse topics](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse), and the evolving nature of entertainment on the internet as we move toward Web3.0. This content will create dialogue and education around these topics, developing connoisseurship of digital assets and an aspirational culture. \n\nAt the same time, Dirt will produce a growing content range of NFTs, based on branding assets like our new mascot, Dirty, who was previously commissioned from the artist [Jason Adam Katzenstein](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jason-adam-katzenstein) (cartoonist for The New Yorker, author, and illustrator). Here is one of our initial art pieces: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/469c62cd-d9b8-416c-80a5-c5012020675c.png?height=500&width=500)\n\nDirty is like the avatar of Dirt: they’re a formless, muddy blob that floats around the internet. What will Dirty do next? Dress up like a TV show character? Become animated or CGI? Imagine a kind of Pokemon or Cryptopunks-esque culture around the publication’s mascot, which gets translated into NFTs and other assets, which fund the publication over time, accruing value. (It’s like if The New Yorker’s [Eustace Tilley](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/mystery-man-2) were an NFT.)\n\nOur new animated NFTs, which come in several colorways, are created by the interactive designer [Mark Costello](http://markalancostello.com/), who will produce more animations in the future. \n\nDirt’s content will roll out in seasons: periods of a month or a few months in which the content is fully funded and is branded as such. This first Mirror NFT sale and token creation won’t fund Dirt in perpetuity, but it’s an experiment to see how NFTs can be used to create a specific batch of content and create community in a publication for anyone who wants to participate — a sense of [digital belonging](https://air.mirror.xyz/5A16bvvS2IJK7fVVNb2GwrrEcyey2B4UiH2l1DI_Y2I) for supporters, as I wrote about previously on Mirror, and a chance to pioneer a publication from NFT culture. \n\n— For previous examples of how crowdfunding editorial projects works, see Emily Segal’s [$NOVEL](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) and [$GENERALIST](https://generalist.mirror.xyz/1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw). An explanation of [token holder options post-NFT sale is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XO65q7UjVePv7XOu5DEvksaEJTXPozjsTc_toJLmh3A/edit). A clear overall description of the model [is here](https://twitter.com/mariodgabriele/status/1378032448664170505). \n\nFunders will be able to contribute to the success of the project and will be encouraged to participate, give feedback, grow the email list, write for the publication, etc. \n\n## **NFT sales and $DIRT-S1 token**\n\nDirt NFTs are available now in two editions, one of 100 for .05 ETH and one of 30 for .2 ETH. The auction for the singular NFT starts at 1 ETH. Each NFT is in a different colorway: Pea Green, Pearl Pink, and Rainbow Wave. These colors and this animation will never be reused. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5ed927b1-a2ba-4777-a43c-1d0e6bcc7e78.png?height=208&width=884)\n\nSeparately, the **$DIRT-S1 token** will be created and rewarded to backers based on their NFT purchases. Tokens will be minted at a rate of 1000 $DIRT-S1 to 1 ETH of crowdfunding and airdropped to the NFT buyers after the crowdfund ends. (The winner of the auction will receive 1000 $DIRT-S1 no matter what the final price is.) On top of that, 25% extra $DIRT-S1 will be minted to stay with Dirt to reward contributors. \n\nThe total 10 ETH goal will provide funding for Dirt’s first season of content, including writing, editing, freelancers, marketing, and NFT art. If the net funding is higher, season 1 will last for a longer time and grow the publication further.\n\nAt the end of the season of content, another wave of NFT editions will be released to wrap up season 1. Token holders will have access to rewards from those NFTs if they desire to exchange the tokens, and more NFT sales will fund the development of the next round of Dirt NFT expansion: editorial planning, commissioning more art, and environmental offsets. \n\nFuture rounds of crowdfunding will be based on season-themed tokens, like $DIRT-S2, etc (similar to magazine volumes, which are numbered by year and edition). When the publication is on solid footing, I will create a final $DIRT token and airdrop it proportionally to all holders of all previous tokens as a reward. Early token holders will be given preference in all Dirt token and NFT releases.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1aed684b-ee11-4a10-91e0-b0e2b531992b.jpg?height=500&width=500)\n\n*Art by Jason Adam Katzenstein*\n\nThe purpose of Dirt is to create both an editorial and a visual universe. The publication will coexist with the body of Dirty-focused artwork, which will expand as we keep publishing, collaborating with new artists and designers. This is what will drive the Dirt NFT market and continue funding the publication, plus creating a fun new form of content. \n\n## **10-15ETH Budget**\n\n- **`40%`** commissioning freelance content\n- **`25%`** founders editing and writing \n- **`25%`** art & NFT development\n- **`10%`** marketing & partnerships\n\n**Season 1 runtime**: 1-3 months\n\n## **About the founders**\n\nI am well-equipped to run Dirt as a small publication having already executed it for several months, using my own media-industry background. I have written for many major [magazines and websites](kylechayka.com) (New Yorker, New York Times, Vox, etc) and also co-founded and run [Study Hall](studyhall.xyz), a subscription media newsletter company and community with 6,000+ paid subscribers and a staff of 5. It will be simple for me to take this initial funding and execute the season of content, as well as lead the publication as a business going forward. \n\nSome of my popular past essays: \n\n- [Ambient Television](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/emily-in-paris-and-the-rise-of-ambient-tv) (The New Yorker)\n- [How Do You Describe TikTok?](https://kylechayka.substack.com/p/essay-how-do-you-describe-tiktok) (personal newsletter) \n- [Welcome to AirSpace](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification) (The Verge) \n\nI’m excited to use my experience in traditional media spaces to pioneer something new and different in the NFT ecosystem. \n\n## Platform Approach\n\nDirt has already grown on Substack, which is useful for its email functionality and fully developed CMS, as well as its familiarity for readers — Dirt now has organic growth there. Future Dirt content will be cross-posted on Substack and Mirror, where it will also come with updates about the publication and NFT business models. \n\nOn Mirror, I’ll develop approaches for integrating NFTs into editorial and creating a connection between NFTs and storytelling, with the goal of eventually moving the entire project onto Mirror. Traditional paywalls will be avoided in favor of patronage and crowdfunding. The content will also create more context for NFT adoption, exposing Substack readers to the mechanics and culture of NFTs and social tokens. \n\n## Business Model Going Forward\n\n1. Crowdfund ETH via NFT editions.\n2. Create editorial and NFT content.\n3. Grow subscriber base.\n4. Drive more demand for Dirt digital assets.\n5. Sell new NFTs and tokens in future crowdfunds.\n6. Repeat until market for Dirt assets is self-sustaining.\n\nIf this initial NFT model doesn’t work I am committed to developing other options and continuing the relationship with token holders.\n\n## Contact\n\nEmail me at [chaykak@gmail.com](mailto:chaykak@gmail.com) if you have any questions or feedback about the project!\n\n*Disclaimer: $DIRT NFTs and tokens do not represent any form of legal equity in any financial entity; they are crowdfunding rewards for contributing the funds to pay for future Dirt newsletter content and development. No financial gain is implied or guaranteed, only ownership of the NFTs and tokens for supporters.*", "timestamp": 1622234018, "digest": "lmV9Dxeos9HvKSu0BKY9pqARK2vAlPXhrNMt68E4GkI", "contributor": "0x25cbCFA16e43e58517f80D583087Ea89241293E6"}

Traditional paywalls will be avoided in favor of patronage and crowdfunding. The content will also create more context for NFT adoption, exposing Substack readers to the mechanics and culture of NFTs and social tokens. \n\n## Business Model Going Forward\n\n1. Crowdfund ETH via NFT editions.\n2. Create editorial and NFT content.\n3. Grow subscriber base.\n4. Drive more demand for Dirt digital assets.\n5. Sell new NFTs and tokens in future crowdfunds.\n6. Repeat until market for Dirt assets is self-sustaining.\n\nIf this initial NFT model doesn’t work I am committed to developing other options and continuing the relationship with token holders.\n\n## Contact\n\nEmail me at [chaykak@gmail.com](mailto:chaykak@gmail.com) if you have any questions or feedback about the project!\n\n*Disclaimer: $DIRT NFTs and tokens do not represent any form of legal equity in any financial entity; they are crowdfunding rewards for contributing the funds to pay for future Dirt newsletter content and development. No financial gain is implied or guaranteed, only ownership of the NFTs and tokens for supporters.*", "timestamp": 1622233967, "digest": "lmV9Dxeos9HvKSu0BKY9pqARK2vAlPXhrNMt68E4GkI", "contributor": "0x25cbCFA16e43e58517f80D583087Ea89241293E6"}
