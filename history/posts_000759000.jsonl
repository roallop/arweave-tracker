{"id": "FWygycYJ4fHZNfR8X1SMWHg5y1ksvn-eB1N2UlbFXZ0", "title": "Fractional", "body": "[Fractional](http://fractional.art) is a protocol for splitting the value of a single NFT across many accounts. In its first 2 months it has created $450 million of fractionalized liquidity from NFTs.\n\nThe protocol follows these steps:\n\n1. An account tells the protocol to **exchange their NFT for ERC20 tokens**. They specify a name and symbol for the ERC20, the number of ERC20 tokens to mint, and a reserve price for the NFT.\n2. The owner is now referred to as a **curator**, and should **distribute the ERC20 tokens** (usually by putting it on a DEX like Uniswap)\n3. ERC20 token holders **vote to update auction's reserve price**\n4. After sufficient voting to negotiate price, bidding starts in **an auction to purchase the NFT**\n5. After the auction ends, ERC20 holders can cash out by **exchanging their tokens for ETH** from the sale\n6. The original owner gets a curation fee through an innovative inflation model\n\nQuick notes: \n\n* ERC20 holders should cash out as soon as the auction closes, to prevent dilution from curator-fee inflation.\n* The protocol is currently governed by a 3-5 Gnosis Safe multisig and is not taking any governance fee, but this is subject to change. \n\nThe rest of this essay breaks down the Fractional's technical components: how NFTs become ERC20 tokens, how voting, auctioning, and cashing out works, and how governance is structured.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/372ba397-cc97-4ec6-99b2-ba9a2a285c6b.png?height=506&width=1012)\n\n## Exchange an NFT for ERC20 Tokens\n\nThe game starts when the NFT owner creates a *TokenVault,* which is both an auction and an ERC20 token. This happens through a special factory contract that transfers the NFT into the TokenVault.\n\nThe original NFT owner becomes the curator of the auction, and can specify the initial reserve price and the number of ERC20 tokens that will exist. The curator receives all of these ERC20 tokens, and will need to distribute them manually (e.g. on Uniswap).\n\nThe Fractional UI integrates with Uniswap (yay integration!), which will allow end users to purchase the ERC20s directly from their website.\n\n![Fractional lets users purchase the fractional ERC20 tokens via Uniswap from their website](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5096a72d-e3e6-4862-8d36-ef16a99e5ce5.png?height=1066&width=1376)\n\nThe auction runs for 7 days by default, but can be set by the curator to a minimum of 3 days and a maximum of 2 weeks.\n\nWith each block, the total supply will inflate by a small percentage set by the curator, and the curator can claim these tokens. The token supply can also inflate by a percentage set by the protocol's governance, and these tokens go to an address controlled by governance (this address will receive ERC20 tokens for all NFTs that are fractionalized) - but the governance fee is currently set to 0%. Anyone can call the function that mints and distributes these tokens to the curator and governance address.\n\n## Auctioning the NFT\n\nOnce the ERC20 tokens are distributed, participants vote on the reserve price of the auction, with 1 vote per token. When 50% of more of the tokens have voted on the price, then bidding can start on the auction.\n\nWhen the auction is won, the NFT is transferred to the auction winner, and the ETH sits in the vault. ERC20 tokens can then be exchanged for this ETH.\n\n![Fractional ERC20 token holders can vote to update the NFT auction's reserve price](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/882c6150-0dc5-4792-ab0d-56010b378fb4.png?height=892&width=1186)\n\n## Cashing Out\n\nOnce the auction is complete, the token holders can cash out by burning their ERC20 tokens in exchange for the ETH from the auction sale. There is an incentive to cash out as early as possible, otherwise the curator fee will inflate the ERC20 supply over time and dilute the value of the other holders.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Fractional protocol gives a 3-of-5 multisig authority all parameters of the protocol. In the early days of the protocol, this is a good way to structure governance, because it allows a small group to take quick action to improve operation. In the long run, governance and ownership should decentralized to a group of users (via airdrop to early users?), which will slow modifications to the protocol’s functionality.\n\nMost of the accounts on the multisig are anonymized via Tornado cash, except for @john_c_palmer who is using an account linked to his other web3 accounts. This creates a small target for him if Fractional continues to grow quickly - but hopefully they can decentralize governance before that becomes a problem.", "timestamp": 1630298358, "digest": "q1455MBwJYtgSC3knhfnIOsCl2w9GUIZO2PQuH3DAm8", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

OpenSea is where most NFT collectors go to discover almost any project.\n\n## How to Purchase an NFT on Opensea\n\n### Step 1: Choose your NFT on OpenSea.\n\nGo to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) and choose which NFT you want to buy.\n\nFor the purposes of this tutorial, simply **choose an NFT on OpenSea that you love** and would be happy holding on to for the long term.\n\n***Note***\\*: you may need to pay additional gas fees if it’s your first time purchasing on OpenSea.\\*\n\n### Step 2: Click “Buy Now” or “Place Bid”\n\nSome NFTs are on auction while others can be bought right away.\n\nFor this tutorial, we will buy an NFT that is ready for immediate purchase.\n\nClick “Buy Now” and agree to OpenSea’s Terms of Service.\n\n### Step 3: Agree to OpenSea’s Terms of Service and Checkout.\n\nOnce you check the box, and click “Checkout\", you will be prompted to pay ETH gas fees for your NFT. Set the amount of gas fees and confirm your NFT purchase.\n\n### Step 4: Wait for confirmation.\n\nNow you wait! Depending how much gas you used, it could take up to 30 minutes or longer for the payment to confirm.\n\nOnce confirmed, your NFT will be in your wallet and displayed on your OpenSea profile.\n\n### That’s all you need!\n\nCongratulations on buying an NFT on OpenSea. You can now show your NFT off to all of your friends.\n\nPlease let me know if this tutorial was helpful (I could have gone into more detail but wanted to keep this short and sweet) or if you have any questions whatsoever in the RabbitHole Discord.\n\nSee you on the other side of the RabbitHole!", "timestamp": 1630342182, "digest": "dtnLfXMABVnUBKIiP55T1l6PTHwOJs6Vb2uBQpwL2l4", "contributor": "0xF69EFCc2dECE59Fbc75B23aE75f51DD7Be3bb1E1"}
{"id": "blorJzPZWg--DvjPxI-DRVyumJ3NtlUZasTxJENxNMo", "title": "How to Launch a Creator DAO?", "body": "Creator DAOs are on the rise, and we're seeing new ones being created every day. DAOs are a new way to finance projects, govern communities, and share value. For every Creator, for anyone on the internet, it's now possible to collaborate, trust each other and join forces toward a joint project.\n\nEvery audience will turn into a community, and every fan will turn into a partner. With Social tokens and Creator DAOs, you'll have the power to incentivize anyone to help you achieve broader goals, meet new people and collaborate with others. DAOs, compared to traditional companies, are open, global, and transparent.\n\nEvery DAO is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all to create a successful Creator DAO. There are, however, good practices that have shown their efficiency in the past. This essay aims to give you some basic insights into how to launch a Creator DAO.\n\n## STEP 1 - Create a small group and gather strong engagement around a common goal.\n\nTo build a Creator DAO, the first thing you'll have to do is gather a small group toward a joint project. T**he goal at this stage is to gather a small community (\\~20 members) that genuinely believes in the project, and that is ready to help accomplish this vision without monetary rewards.** You can start by inviting your friends interested in the same niche that you are, post on forums, share your vision on socials or talk directly to your community if you already have one from previous projects.\n\n**The best way to attract top talent is to create a DAO with a strong culture, efficient onboarding, and well-designed incentives.** With a strong culture, you'll attract high-quality talents that will be intrinsically motivated to provide support over a sustained period.\n\n**The easiest way to onboard your first community members is to create a Telegram or a Geneva group.** Discord and Slack are also reasonable solutions but are more useful at a later stage when you need to create different channels around different subjects. Think thoroughly about all the onboarding steps to make sure anyone wanting to contribute can do it easily. Be proactive in onboarding community members and split the onboarding responsibilities with other key members of the DAO.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about gathering a solid community toward a joint project, you can [read this article ](https://www.notion.so/Setting-up-Treasury-Management-Governance-02cd796ad05b49cc856697a68da73bcf)sharing the best resources about the subject.\n\n## STEP 2 - Design Tokenomics\n\n*Once you have gathered a small and tight community around a shared vision, the next step is to design the Tokenomics of your project.*\n\nWe call Tokenomics all the things that enable participants to earn more tokens by contributing positively. Basically, setting up Tokenomics for your project means \"What can we put in place to incentivize my community to participate in my project.\"\n\n**To incentivize your community, there are several aspects you should dig into:**\n\n* **Token Distribution - How do you plan to reward contributors?** How much of the supply will be reserved for the DAO treasury? Do you want to do a retroactive airdrop (reward contributor for their past contributions) or everyone's winning Token from a starting point? The challenge with Token Distribution is to create efficient distribution mechanisms that would put the tokens in the hands of people willing to produce work for the network.\n* **Token design - How do you design the financial aspects of your Token?** What will be the total initial supply? Should you mint your Token on a [Fixed supply or on a Bonding curve](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)? If it's on a Bonding Curve, do you want your supply to be capped or uncapped? With Token design, you have to think about the technical and financial aspect of your Token to make sure it reflect what you want to achieve with your DAO.\n* **Price Stability - How do you manage the stability of your Token, so people are still motivated to collaborate?** What will be the anchor exchange rate with Ethereum (1ETH = 10?100?1000? of your Token)? Do you want to create an inflationary or deflationary token (monetary policy)? With which tokens do you want to bond your token (Collateral volatile or stable coin)? Price stability is an important aspect to consider as with a higher price comes speculators and with lower price comes more difficulty to incentivize community members.\n* **Governance - How do you assure fair governance and ensure the funds are distributed to the right projectS?** What rights do you give to token holders? What will be the Internal economics of your project? Governance is key to create a truly decentralized Organization.\n\nAll of the above elements will play a major role in how people collaborate in your DAO. Take the time to reflect thoroughly on the Tokenomics of your project, as it can make it skyrocket or plummet.\n\n## STEP 3 - Create a personal / community Token.\n\n*Once you’ve gathered a small knit community and have figured out the Tokenomics of your Token, the logical next step is to create a Token.*\n\nThe Token will primarily serve as social recognition as the Token doesn't have financial value at this point but will still be very effective to incentivize potential contributors. With the previous step, you should now have the answers to all the Tokenomics of your Token. The process of actually creating a token is fairly easy and pretty straightforward on Coinvise.\n\n**Here a several tutorials to help you go through these steps:**\n\n* [Create a Crypto Wallet](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Sign up on Coinvise](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Buy your first ETH](https://www.notion.so/How-to-buy-your-first-ETH-86873d84278c4495a752a6930f969f8d)\n* [Create a Personal / community Token](https://www.notion.so/How-to-mint-a-Personal-Community-Token-424196cb6f204f38b94faed3e0db301f)\n\n## STEP 4 - Design great bounties and grow your community\n\n*With a Token and early traction, the next step is to incentivize community members to be active and do tasks to help grow the project.*\n\nSocial tokens have shown their efficiency to incentivize individuals to share their skills with others. Well-designed incentives are more than crucial as they can make your project tremendously grow. They are best used when they scale or incentivize coordination and engagement between community members. Incentives are ideal when it's mutually beneficial to you and your community. This will create positive-sum games, where everyone has an aligned economic interest.\n\n**There are three main types of incentives:**\n\n* **Social incentives -** It's more of a social, collectible value that people are proud to own. Social Tokens create status within a community. Think of Airline miles that generate status within a specific sphere (Airline lounge, first to enter the plane, etc..) or special perks in Discord servers\n* **Vision Incentives -** Members aren't participating \"for-profit\" (aka economic incentives) but are driven by a specific ideology. Community members will exchange your Token without a monetary value because they sincerely believed in the vision.\n* **Economic Incentives -** It doesn't require a particular strategy, and you can simply ask community members to achieve a mission in exchange for economic value. By creating a “pay-for-performance incentive scheme” (a program where you pay contributors depending on how hard they work), you allow anyone to participate and help grow the project.\n\n**A Framework to design great incentives:**\n\n* **Step 1: Determine what would drive each party to use your Token -** The first step to do so is to clearly define what members of your community are chasing by joining your community. What are their inner motivations? What would they earn by participating in the community? Why have they decided to join? You have to deeply understand their interest in collaborating with the community before creating incentives.\n* **Step 2: Determine how you can align each parties' interest -** Now that you know what you need and what other community members want, your goal is to align those interests and design targeted rewards schemes. it's all about considering the trade-offs, which balance costs and benefits. (EX: Grades at school)\n* **Step 3: Prevent bad token behaviors by disincentivizing those -** Some bad behaviors could be speculative investments, for example, where community members would buy your Token (try to raise its value) without having a positive impact on the project. One way to beat this is to provide “lock-up periods” for token-holders. Basically, you lock their token for a certain period and contributors can’t withdraw them to their wallet. Another to disincentivize bad behaviors is t reward token holders for holding your Token for a long period of time. Instead of locking their tokens, you simply tell them they’ll receive a bonus for holding the token (every 3 or 6 months for example). Great onboarding is also key to prevent those bad behaviors.\n* **Step 4: Incorporating effective performance metrics and optimizing the size of rewards -** The goal of defining clear performance metrics is to measure participants' contributions to reward them relative to their efforts. (defining clear outcomes for projects, think Forefront's bounties, and leverage web3 tools like source.cred) \n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects:**\n\n* [Forefront](https://forefront.market/) - [Forefront's bounties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dt5KxK5QmOyPAHBfj81nmY-btyTd0mbPlqJByOmkSR4/edit#gid=196077105)\n* [GlobalCoinResearch](https://globalcoinresearch.com/) - [GCR’s Bounties](https://globalcoinresearch.com/2021/04/14/gcr-media-mining/)\n\nYou can [Create Bounties](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Token-Reward-Bounty-on-Coinvise-abfc94a17ebc44c6a6f4affeec779113) (incentives) on Coinvise and [integrate the Coinvise Bot on Discord](https://www.notion.so/How-to-integrate-Discord-Tipping-NFT-Bot-ce49b396acbd48309db170eae362aca1) to automate sending out the rewards.\n\n## STEP 5 - Crowdfund your project\n\n*With a growing community, some traction, a Token, and the initial contributors that have achieved the first milestones, it's now time to open the community to a broader audience and crowdfund your project to achieve bigger goals.*\n\n**There are two main ways to crowdfund a project: through Social Tokens and NFTs.**\n\n* **Through Social Token -** A creator can crowdfund money by creating a Liquidity Pool, which means letting anyone buy its token. However, the Creator will need an already strong community (otherwise no one will buy its Token), and he will lose control over its Token (as anyone can buy token, anyone can buy a large amount of Token and vote for bad decision over the future of the project.\n* **Through NFTs -** A creator can mint an NFT or a collection of NFT and its fans can then buy it. NFT can give access to gated channels for example.\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects :**\n\n* [Ethereum: The Infinite Garden](https://twitter.com/EthereumFilm) - $INFINITE\n* [Burn Alpha Novel](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) - $NOVEL\n* [Alex Masmej](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej) - $ALEX\n* [Elektra by Songcamp](https://elektra.camp/#/) - $ELEKTRA\n* [Creator Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) - $CABIN\n\nIf you're interested in knowing more about crowdfunding, you should [read this essay](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/crowdfunding-projects-through-social) that gives more insight into Web3 crowdfunding.\n\n## STEP 6 - Setting up Treasury Management & Governance\n\n*With some money in the bank from your successful crowdfunding, you'll now have to manage the Treasury and let token holders choose for the community's future.*\n\nThe purpose of any decentralized community is to capitalize on itself in such a way as to ensure its ongoing operations can continue and invest in the future growth and success of the community and projects. **Right after the crowdfunding, as a community leader, you'll have three primary missions: Distribute ownership to community members, manage the Treasury of your community and create governance mechanisms.**\n\nHere are few actions you should take during this period to achieve your missions:\n\n* **Diversify your tokens -** The diversification of your tokens is an important area to focus on. A priority for many communities' treasuries is to convert a portion of their assets into Stablecoins. With the entirety of your Treasury held in your native Token, if the price of your token falls, let's say by 40%, your balance sheet will also shrink by 40%.\n* **Create a Multisig Wallet with Gnosis.** A multi-signature wallet allows you to define an access/control scheme through multiple users that need to confirm transactions before executing them. It secures your Treasury in the hand of multiple contributors and decentralizes your community a bit more.\n* **Create Guilds/Working groups -** Creating a Multisig is not the only way to distribute ownership. Another good practice is to develop Guilds or working groups in charge of specific missions within your community. By creating these working groups, you'll be able to allocate funds to specifics teams and organize your community more thoughtfully.\n* **Manage your Treasury -** You can use [Llama](https://llama.community/), an easy tool that helps DeFi protocols, DAOs, and Social Token communities manage their treasuries, as you'll have to make payments, financial reporting, and asset allocation. You'll also have to define how the supply allocated to the Treasury would be used for. Do you want to reward members for ongoing work and activities? Provide liquidity for the secondary token market if needed (e.g. via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/))? Potentially conduct a second crowdfund?\n* **Give voting power to your community** - The easiest way to give voting power to your community is to set up a [Snapshot](http://snapshot.org/) for governance mechanisms. Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results. Anyone can submit a proposal on Snapshot, and Token holders can then vote for or against the proposal, depending on if they judge it will benefit the project. The more token you hold, the more voting power you have.\n* **Setup tools for your Discord Server -** You can use tools such as [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) or [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/) that helps you determine how much value a contribution or contributor added to a project overall and reward them easily. With Collab.Land, it’s also possible to tip your contributor and create token-gated channels according to roles and how much token someone has. You can also set up the Coinvise Bot, which allows you to automatize the process of tipping.\n* **Generate multiple income streams -** Treasury management is an essential tool for aligning and incentivizing stakeholders to work for DAOs. Competition for talented contributions is fierce, so it's vital to ensure communities are well-capitalized regardless of market conditions. DAOs & communities ought to generate multiple income streams that can cover operating expenses and make sure to attract the best talents. An option for generating multiple income streams is yield farming. This is when you lend out a cryptocurrency and earn interest in it. It serves as an investment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLaunching a Creator DAO is one small step toward building a whole new economy where every individual can thrive. Making a Creator DAO isn't just making a token, it’s thinking about the different aspects of it, thinking about the Tokenomics and the incentives you’ll create.\n\nWe're still at the beginning of Creator DAOs, and there is still so much to discover and build. The entire crypto community is experimenting with new ways to improve Creator DAOs, and the space is rapidly evolving.\n\nHowever, with this guide, you should now be more aware of launching your Creator DAO and using crypto mechanisms to achieve your high ambition goals.\n\n\n---\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234)\n\n\n---\n\n**Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  **[Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en)**and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/8jaQB5CZ) 🔥**\n\n\n---\n\n**Further Resources on Tokenomics:**\n\n* [Designing Internet-Native Economies: A Guide to Crypto Tokens](https://future.a16z.com/a-taxonomy-of-tokens-distinctions-with-a-difference/)\n* [Great example of how CabinDAO chose their Tech Stack](https://creators.mirror.xyz/862A5rBtKX3BC8eEircDnGwPIJJTJ33hn-MvnukByPc) \n* [Social Token as Financial Assets (Blue Version)](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)\n* [Token Supply 101: Fundamentals of token supply — and monetary policy](https://adrienbe.medium.com/token-supply-101-fundamentals-of-token-supply-and-monetary-policy-a20cc761f6ec)\n* [FLOW Token Economics](https://www.onflow.org/flow-token-economics)\n\n**Further Resources on Treasury:**\n\n* [How DAOs should approach treasury management](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-daos-should-approach-treasury)\n* [How to Structure a Protocol’s Treasury](https://shreyashariharan.com/2021/03/14/how-to-structure-a-protocols-treasury/)", "timestamp": 1630344957, "digest": "0f9g1E0Lx0uirTo61UuahYDHb3v3O-qz9Y9hBGpnYJM", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

DAOs are a new way to finance projects, govern communities, and share value. For every Creator, for anyone on the internet, it's now possible to collaborate, trust each other and join forces toward a joint project.\n\nEvery audience will turn into a community, and every fan will turn into a partner. With Social tokens and Creator DAOs, you'll have the power to incentivize anyone to help you achieve broader goals, meet new people and collaborate with others. DAOs, compared to traditional companies, are open, global, and transparent.\n\nEvery DAO is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all to create a successful Creator DAO. There are, however, good practices that have shown their efficiency in the past. This essay aims to give you some basic insights into how to launch a Creator DAO.\n\n## STEP 1 - Create a small group and gather strong engagement around a common goal.\n\nTo build a Creator DAO, the first thing you'll have to do is gather a small group toward a joint project. T**he goal at this stage is to gather a small community (\\~20 members) that genuinely believes in the project, and that is ready to help accomplish this vision without monetary rewards.** You can start by inviting your friends interested in the same niche that you are, post on forums, share your vision on socials or talk directly to your community if you already have one from previous projects.\n\n**The best way to attract top talent is to create a DAO with a strong culture, efficient onboarding, and well-designed incentives.** With a strong culture, you'll attract high-quality talents that will be intrinsically motivated to provide support over a sustained period.\n\n**The easiest way to onboard your first community members is to create a Telegram or a Geneva group.** Discord and Slack are also reasonable solutions but are more useful at a later stage when you need to create different channels around different subjects. Think thoroughly about all the onboarding steps to make sure anyone wanting to contribute can do it easily. Be proactive in onboarding community members and split the onboarding responsibilities with other key members of the DAO.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about gathering a solid community toward a joint project, you can [read this article ](https://www.notion.so/Setting-up-Treasury-Management-Governance-02cd796ad05b49cc856697a68da73bcf)sharing the best resources about the subject.\n\n## STEP 2 - Design Tokenomics\n\n*Once you have gathered a small and tight community around a shared vision, the next step is to design the Tokenomics of your project.*\n\nWe call Tokenomics all the things that enable participants to earn more tokens by contributing positively. Basically, setting up Tokenomics for your project means \"What can we put in place to incentivize my community to participate in my project.\"\n\n**To incentivize your community, there are several aspects you should dig into:**\n\n* **Token Distribution - How do you plan to reward contributors?** How much of the supply will be reserved for the DAO treasury? Do you want to do a retroactive airdrop (reward contributor for their past contributions) or everyone's winning Token from a starting point? The challenge with Token Distribution is to create efficient distribution mechanisms that would put the tokens in the hands of people willing to produce work for the network.\n* **Token design - How do you design the financial aspects of your Token?** What will be the total initial supply? Should you mint your Token on a [Fixed supply or on a Bonding curve](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)? If it's on a Bonding Curve, do you want your supply to be capped or uncapped? With Token design, you have to think about the technical and financial aspect of your Token to make sure it reflect what you want to achieve with your DAO.\n* **Price Stability - How do you manage the stability of your Token, so people are still motivated to collaborate?** What will be the anchor exchange rate with Ethereum (1ETH = 10?100?1000? of your Token)? Do you want to create an inflationary or deflationary token (monetary policy)? With which tokens do you want to bond your token (Collateral volatile or stable coin)? Price stability is an important aspect to consider as with a higher price comes speculators and with lower price comes more difficulty to incentivize community members.\n* **Governance - How do you assure fair governance and ensure the funds are distributed to the right projectS?** What rights do you give to token holders? What will be the Internal economics of your project? Governance is key to create a truly decentralized Organization.\n\nAll of the above elements will play a major role in how people collaborate in your DAO. Take the time to reflect thoroughly on the Tokenomics of your project, as it can make it skyrocket or plummet.\n\n## STEP 3 - Create a personal / community Token.\n\n*Once you’ve gathered a small knit community and have figured out the Tokenomics of your Token, the logical next step is to create a Token.*\n\nThe Token will primarily serve as social recognition as the Token doesn't have financial value at this point but will still be very effective to incentivize potential contributors.

The entire crypto community is experimenting with new ways to improve Creator DAOs, and the space is rapidly evolving.\n\nHowever, with this guide, you should now be more aware of launching your Creator DAO and using crypto mechanisms to achieve your high ambition goals.\n\n\n---\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234)\n\n\n---\n\n**Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  \\*\\*[Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en)\\*\\*and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/8jaQB5CZ) 🔥**\n\n\n---\n\n**Further Resources on Tokenomics:**\n\n* [Designing Internet-Native Economies: A Guide to Crypto Tokens](https://future.a16z.com/a-taxonomy-of-tokens-distinctions-with-a-difference/)\n* [Great example of how CabinDAO chose their Tech Stack](https://creators.mirror.xyz/862A5rBtKX3BC8eEircDnGwPIJJTJ33hn-MvnukByPc)\n* [Social Token as Financial Assets (Blue Version)](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)\n* [Token Supply 101: Fundamentals of token supply — and monetary policy](https://adrienbe.medium.com/token-supply-101-fundamentals-of-token-supply-and-monetary-policy-a20cc761f6ec)\n* [FLOW Token Economics](https://www.onflow.org/flow-token-economics)\n\n**Further Resources on Treasury:**\n\n* [How DAOs should approach treasury management](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-daos-should-approach-treasury)\n* [How to Structure a Protocol’s Treasury](https://shreyashariharan.com/2021/03/14/how-to-structure-a-protocols-treasury/)", "timestamp": 1630345012, "digest": "0f9g1E0Lx0uirTo61UuahYDHb3v3O-qz9Y9hBGpnYJM", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

DAOs are a new way to finance projects, govern communities, and share value. For every Creator, for anyone on the internet, it's now possible to collaborate, trust each other and join forces toward a joint project.\n\nEvery audience will turn into a community, and every fan will turn into a partner. With Social tokens and Creator DAOs, you'll have the power to incentivize anyone to help you achieve broader goals, meet new people and collaborate with others. DAOs, compared to traditional companies, are open, global, and transparent.\n\nEvery DAO is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all to create a successful Creator DAO. There are, however, good practices that have shown their efficiency in the past. This essay aims to give you some basic insights into how to launch a Creator DAO.\n\n## STEP 1 - Create a small group and gather strong engagement around a common goal.\n\nTo build a Creator DAO, the first thing you'll have to do is gather a small group toward a joint project. T**he goal at this stage is to gather a small community (\\~20 members) that genuinely believes in the project, and that is ready to help accomplish this vision without monetary rewards.** You can start by inviting your friends interested in the same niche that you are, post on forums, share your vision on socials or talk directly to your community if you already have one from previous projects.\n\n**The best way to attract top talent is to create a DAO with a strong culture, efficient onboarding, and well-designed incentives.** With a strong culture, you'll attract high-quality talents that will be intrinsically motivated to provide support over a sustained period.\n\n**The easiest way to onboard your first community members is to create a Telegram or a Geneva group.** Discord and Slack are also reasonable solutions but are more useful at a later stage when you need to create different channels around different subjects. Think thoroughly about all the onboarding steps to make sure anyone wanting to contribute can do it easily. Be proactive in onboarding community members and split the onboarding responsibilities with other key members of the DAO.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about gathering a solid community toward a joint project, you can [read this article ](https://www.notion.so/Setting-up-Treasury-Management-Governance-02cd796ad05b49cc856697a68da73bcf)sharing the best resources about the subject.\n\n## STEP 2 - Design Tokenomics\n\n*Once you have gathered a small and tight community around a shared vision, the next step is to design the Tokenomics of your project.*\n\nWe call Tokenomics all the things that enable participants to earn more tokens by contributing positively. Basically, setting up Tokenomics for your project means \"What can we put in place to incentivize my community to participate in my project.\"\n\n**To incentivize your community, there are several aspects you should dig into:**\n\n* **Token Distribution - How do you plan to reward contributors?** How much of the supply will be reserved for the DAO treasury? Do you want to do a retroactive airdrop (reward contributor for their past contributions) or everyone's winning Token from a starting point? The challenge with Token Distribution is to create efficient distribution mechanisms that would put the tokens in the hands of people willing to produce work for the network.\n* **Token design - How do you design the financial aspects of your Token?** What will be the total initial supply? Should you mint your Token on a [Fixed supply or on a Bonding curve](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)? If it's on a Bonding Curve, do you want your supply to be capped or uncapped? With Token design, you have to think about the technical and financial aspect of your Token to make sure it reflect what you want to achieve with your DAO.\n* **Price Stability - How do you manage the stability of your Token, so people are still motivated to collaborate?** What will be the anchor exchange rate with Ethereum (1ETH = 10?100?1000? of your Token)? Do you want to create an inflationary or deflationary token (monetary policy)? With which tokens do you want to bond your token (Collateral volatile or stable coin)? Price stability is an important aspect to consider as with a higher price comes speculators and with lower price comes more difficulty to incentivize community members.\n* **Governance - How do you assure fair governance and ensure the funds are distributed to the right projectS?** What rights do you give to token holders? What will be the Internal economics of your project? Governance is key to create a truly decentralized Organization.\n\nAll of the above elements will play a major role in how people collaborate in your DAO. Take the time to reflect thoroughly on the Tokenomics of your project, as it can make it skyrocket or plummet.\n\n## STEP 3 - Create a personal / community Token.\n\n*Once you’ve gathered a small knit community and have figured out the Tokenomics of your Token, the logical next step is to create a Token.*\n\nThe Token will primarily serve as social recognition as the Token doesn't have financial value at this point but will still be very effective to incentivize potential contributors. With the previous step, you should now have the answers to all the Tokenomics of your Token. The process of actually creating a token is fairly easy and pretty straightforward on Coinvise.\n\n**Here a several tutorials to help you go through these steps:**\n\n* [Create a Crypto Wallet](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Sign up on Coinvise](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Buy your first ETH](https://www.notion.so/How-to-buy-your-first-ETH-86873d84278c4495a752a6930f969f8d)\n* [Create a Personal / community Token](https://www.notion.so/How-to-mint-a-Personal-Community-Token-424196cb6f204f38b94faed3e0db301f)\n\n## STEP 4 - Design great bounties and grow your community\n\n*With a Token and early traction, the next step is to incentivize community members to be active and do tasks to help grow the project.*\n\nSocial tokens have shown their efficiency to incentivize individuals to share their skills with others. Well-designed incentives are more than crucial as they can make your project tremendously grow. They are best used when they scale or incentivize coordination and engagement between community members. Incentives are ideal when it's mutually beneficial to you and your community. This will create positive-sum games, where everyone has an aligned economic interest.\n\n**There are three main types of incentives:**\n\n* **Social incentives -** It's more of a social, collectible value that people are proud to own. Social Tokens create status within a community. Think of Airline miles that generate status within a specific sphere (Airline lounge, first to enter the plane, etc..) or special perks in Discord servers\n* **Vision Incentives -** Members aren't participating \"for-profit\" (aka economic incentives) but are driven by a specific ideology. Community members will exchange your Token without a monetary value because they sincerely believed in the vision.\n* **Economic Incentives -** It doesn't require a particular strategy, and you can simply ask community members to achieve a mission in exchange for economic value. By creating a “pay-for-performance incentive scheme” (a program where you pay contributors depending on how hard they work), you allow anyone to participate and help grow the project.\n\n**A Framework to design great incentives:**\n\n* **Step 1: Determine what would drive each party to use your Token -** The first step to do so is to clearly define what members of your community are chasing by joining your community. What are their inner motivations? What would they earn by participating in the community? Why have they decided to join? You have to deeply understand their interest in collaborating with the community before creating incentives.\n* **Step 2: Determine how you can align each parties' interest -** Now that you know what you need and what other community members want, your goal is to align those interests and design targeted rewards schemes. it's all about considering the trade-offs, which balance costs and benefits. (EX: Grades at school)\n* **Step 3: Prevent bad token behaviors by disincentivizing those -** Some bad behaviors could be speculative investments, for example, where community members would buy your Token (try to raise its value) without having a positive impact on the project. One way to beat this is to provide “lock-up periods” for token-holders. Basically, you lock their token for a certain period and contributors can’t withdraw them to their wallet. Another to disincentivize bad behaviors is t reward token holders for holding your Token for a long period of time. Instead of locking their tokens, you simply tell them they’ll receive a bonus for holding the token (every 3 or 6 months for example). Great onboarding is also key to prevent those bad behaviors.\n* **Step 4: Incorporating effective performance metrics and optimizing the size of rewards -** The goal of defining clear performance metrics is to measure participants' contributions to reward them relative to their efforts. (defining clear outcomes for projects, think Forefront's bounties, and leverage web3 tools like source.cred)\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects:**\n\n* [Forefront](https://forefront.market/) - [Forefront's bounties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dt5KxK5QmOyPAHBfj81nmY-btyTd0mbPlqJByOmkSR4/edit#gid=196077105)\n* [GlobalCoinResearch](https://globalcoinresearch.com/) - [GCR’s Bounties](https://globalcoinresearch.com/2021/04/14/gcr-media-mining/)\n\nYou can [Create Bounties](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Token-Reward-Bounty-on-Coinvise-abfc94a17ebc44c6a6f4affeec779113) (incentives) on Coinvise and [integrate the Coinvise Bot on Discord](https://www.notion.so/How-to-integrate-Discord-Tipping-NFT-Bot-ce49b396acbd48309db170eae362aca1) to automate sending out the rewards.\n\n## STEP 5 - Crowdfund your project\n\n*With a growing community, some traction, a Token, and the initial contributors that have achieved the first milestones, it's now time to open the community to a broader audience and crowdfund your project to achieve bigger goals.*\n\n**There are two main ways to crowdfund a project: through Social Tokens and NFTs.**\n\n* **Through Social Token -** A creator can crowdfund money by creating a Liquidity Pool, which means letting anyone buy its token. However, the Creator will need an already strong community (otherwise no one will buy its Token), and he will lose control over its Token (as anyone can buy token, anyone can buy a large amount of Token and vote for bad decision over the future of the project.\n* **Through NFTs -** A creator can mint an NFT or a collection of NFT and its fans can then buy it. NFT can give access to gated channels for example.\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects :**\n\n* [Ethereum: The Infinite Garden](https://twitter.com/EthereumFilm) - $INFINITE\n* [Burn Alpha Novel](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) - $NOVEL\n* [Alex Masmej](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej) - $ALEX\n* [Elektra by Songcamp](https://elektra.camp/#/) - $ELEKTRA\n* [Creator Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) - $CABIN\n\nIf you're interested in knowing more about crowdfunding, you should [read this essay](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/crowdfunding-projects-through-social) that gives more insight into Web3 crowdfunding.\n\n## STEP 6 - Setting up Treasury Management & Governance\n\n*With some money in the bank from your successful crowdfunding, you'll now have to manage the Treasury and let token holders choose for the community's future.*\n\nThe purpose of any decentralized community is to capitalize on itself in such a way as to ensure its ongoing operations can continue and invest in the future growth and success of the community and projects. **Right after the crowdfunding, as a community leader, you'll have three primary missions: Distribute ownership to community members, manage the Treasury of your community and create governance mechanisms.**\n\nHere are few actions you should take during this period to achieve your missions:\n\n* **Diversify your tokens -** The diversification of your tokens is an important area to focus on. A priority for many communities' treasuries is to convert a portion of their assets into Stablecoins. With the entirety of your Treasury held in your native Token, if the price of your token falls, let's say by 40%, your balance sheet will also shrink by 40%.\n* **Create a Multisig Wallet with Gnosis.** A multi-signature wallet allows you to define an access/control scheme through multiple users that need to confirm transactions before executing them. It secures your Treasury in the hand of multiple contributors and decentralizes your community a bit more.\n* **Create Guilds/Working groups -** Creating a Multisig is not the only way to distribute ownership. Another good practice is to develop Guilds or working groups in charge of specific missions within your community. By creating these working groups, you'll be able to allocate funds to specifics teams and organize your community more thoughtfully.\n* **Manage your Treasury -** You can use [Llama](https://llama.community/), an easy tool that helps DeFi protocols, DAOs, and Social Token communities manage their treasuries, as you'll have to make payments, financial reporting, and asset allocation. You'll also have to define how the supply allocated to the Treasury would be used for. Do you want to reward members for ongoing work and activities? Provide liquidity for the secondary token market if needed (e.g. via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/))? Potentially conduct a second crowdfund?\n* **Give voting power to your community** - The easiest way to give voting power to your community is to set up a [Snapshot](http://snapshot.org/) for governance mechanisms. Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results. Anyone can submit a proposal on Snapshot, and Token holders can then vote for or against the proposal, depending on if they judge it will benefit the project. The more token you hold, the more voting power you have.\n* **Setup tools for your Discord Server -** You can use tools such as [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) or [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/) that helps you determine how much value a contribution or contributor added to a project overall and reward them easily. With Collab.Land, it’s also possible to tip your contributor and create token-gated channels according to roles and how much token someone has. You can also set up the Coinvise Bot, which allows you to automatize the process of tipping.\n* **Generate multiple income streams -** Treasury management is an essential tool for aligning and incentivizing stakeholders to work for DAOs. Competition for talented contributions is fierce, so it's vital to ensure communities are well-capitalized regardless of market conditions. DAOs & communities ought to generate multiple income streams that can cover operating expenses and make sure to attract the best talents. An option for generating multiple income streams is yield farming. This is when you lend out a cryptocurrency and earn interest in it. It serves as an investment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLaunching a Creator DAO is one small step toward building a whole new economy where every individual can thrive.

Entire new genres born from mashups of mashups.\n\ni co-founded a startup that finances solar-powered drip irrigation in Africa and can confirm labor intensity (even with productivity-enhancing tech like drip irrigation). personally wouldn’t look at investing in traditional agri without robotics or hydro/aeroponics. too much opex chasing too little margin that only makes sense at massive scale\n\nare we buying next to kanye?\n\nCenturies ago, explorers sailed the seas to discover lands unknown. In the 2020s, earth's continents have been charted, but a new frontier exists - the missing connection between land and a digital ledger. That's why we are building CityDAO.\n\nI subdivided land in Hawaii. It gets complex. You have to not only collect fees for maintenance but handle disputes. For example one person may just drive a small car on the road, but a neighbor farm has big heavy dump trucks (commercial) causing significantly more wear.\n\nI'm a Gitcoin Kernel fellow and VC\n\nCities are made up of a ton of people, each doing their own thing to make it function, somewhat autonomous, can create their own laws, regulation, strategies, and organized under a single banner of identity with defined limits, I mean it ain’t perfect...\n\nWe need more CityDAO IRL meetups.\n\n“private keys to the city”\n\nall funds will go to buying our first parcel and shipping the web3 and solidity parcel minting app\n\nThe 791 voting system is a cool concept but it doesn’t solve the issue of fake identities, it simply just makes it harder\n\npretty cool, I think NFTs are just getting started and will probably get used for land as well\n\nSo far the path has been subdividing. People will buy (choose) an actual parcel. My understanding of other methods (shares) is more effort needs to be done with securities laws. Lots of approaches have been discussed in the other channels\n\nHonestly might be better off building hydroponics and automating crop production.

You can grow them pretty much anywhere, although energy costs vary based on location.\n\nthe weekend is for DAO exploration eh?\n\nSo many ideas! It’s just about building up to them, and not going bankrupt trying to do one at the start.\n\nMay be far in ideology but solving the Byzantine General's problem, alongside reading the Ottoman Empire book could yield something connected to DAOs\n\nReady for DAOCon summer 2022\n\nDidn't imagine folks to know about Seoul but yeah, Heabanchon is the place obviously.

DAOs are a new way to finance projects, govern communities, and share value. For every Creator, for anyone on the internet, it's now possible to collaborate, trust each other and join forces toward a joint project.\n\nEvery audience will turn into a community, and every fan will turn into a partner. With Social tokens and Creator DAOs, you'll have the power to incentivize anyone to help you achieve broader goals, meet new people and collaborate with others. DAOs, compared to traditional companies, are open, global, and transparent.\n\nEvery DAO is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all to create a successful Creator DAO. There are, however, good practices that have shown their efficiency in the past. This essay aims to give you some basic insights into how to launch a Creator DAO.\n\n## STEP 1 - Create a small group and gather strong engagement around a common goal.\n\nTo build a Creator DAO, the first thing you'll have to do is gather a small group toward a joint project. T**he goal at this stage is to gather a small community (\\~20 members) that genuinely believes in the project, and that is ready to help accomplish this vision without monetary rewards.** You can start by inviting your friends interested in the same niche that you are, post on forums, share your vision on socials or talk directly to your community if you already have one from previous projects.\n\n**The best way to attract top talent is to create a DAO with a strong culture, efficient onboarding, and well-designed incentives.** With a strong culture, you'll attract high-quality talents that will be intrinsically motivated to provide support over a sustained period.\n\n**The easiest way to onboard your first community members is to create a Telegram or a Geneva group.** Discord and Slack are also reasonable solutions but are more useful at a later stage when you need to create different channels around different subjects. Think thoroughly about all the onboarding steps to make sure anyone wanting to contribute can do it easily. Be proactive in onboarding community members and split the onboarding responsibilities with other key members of the DAO.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about gathering a solid community toward a joint project, you can [read this article ](https://www.notion.so/Setting-up-Treasury-Management-Governance-02cd796ad05b49cc856697a68da73bcf)sharing the best resources about the subject.\n\n## STEP 2 - Design Tokenomics\n\n*Once you have gathered a small and tight community around a shared vision, the next step is to design the Tokenomics of your project.*\n\nWe call Tokenomics all the things that enable participants to earn more tokens by contributing positively. Basically, setting up Tokenomics for your project means \"What can we put in place to incentivize my community to participate in my project.\"\n\n**To incentivize your community, there are several aspects you should dig into:**\n\n* **Token Distribution - How do you plan to reward contributors?** How much of the supply will be reserved for the DAO treasury? Do you want to do a retroactive airdrop (reward contributor for their past contributions) or everyone's winning Token from a starting point? The challenge with Token Distribution is to create efficient distribution mechanisms that would put the tokens in the hands of people willing to produce work for the network.\n* **Token design - How do you design the financial aspects of your Token?** What will be the total initial supply? Should you mint your Token on a [Fixed supply or on a Bonding curve](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)? If it's on a Bonding Curve, do you want your supply to be capped or uncapped? With Token design, you have to think about the technical and financial aspect of your Token to make sure it reflect what you want to achieve with your DAO.\n* **Price Stability - How do you manage the stability of your Token, so people are still motivated to collaborate?** What will be the anchor exchange rate with Ethereum (1ETH = 10?100?1000? of your Token)? Do you want to create an inflationary or deflationary token (monetary policy)? With which tokens do you want to bond your token (Collateral volatile or stable coin)? Price stability is an important aspect to consider as with a higher price comes speculators and with lower price comes more difficulty to incentivize community members.\n* **Governance - How do you assure fair governance and ensure the funds are distributed to the right projectS?** What rights do you give to token holders? What will be the Internal economics of your project? Governance is key to create a truly decentralized Organization.\n\nAll of the above elements will play a major role in how people collaborate in your DAO. Take the time to reflect thoroughly on the Tokenomics of your project, as it can make it skyrocket or plummet.\n\n## STEP 3 - Create a personal / community Token.\n\n*Once you’ve gathered a small knit community and have figured out the Tokenomics of your Token, the logical next step is to create a Token.*\n\nThe Token will primarily serve as social recognition as the Token doesn't have financial value at this point but will still be very effective to incentivize potential contributors. With the previous step, you should now have the answers to all the Tokenomics of your Token. The process of actually creating a token is fairly easy and pretty straightforward on Coinvise.\n\n**Here a several tutorials to help you go through these steps:**\n\n* [Create a Crypto Wallet](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Sign up on Coinvise](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Buy your first ETH](https://www.notion.so/How-to-buy-your-first-ETH-86873d84278c4495a752a6930f969f8d)\n* [Create a Personal / community Token](https://www.notion.so/How-to-mint-a-Personal-Community-Token-424196cb6f204f38b94faed3e0db301f)\n\n## STEP 4 - Design great bounties and grow your community\n\n*With a Token and early traction, the next step is to incentivize community members to be active and do tasks to help grow the project.*\n\nSocial tokens have shown their efficiency to incentivize individuals to share their skills with others. Well-designed incentives are more than crucial as they can make your project tremendously grow. They are best used when they scale or incentivize coordination and engagement between community members. Incentives are ideal when it's mutually beneficial to you and your community. This will create positive-sum games, where everyone has an aligned economic interest.\n\n**There are three main types of incentives:**\n\n* **Social incentives -** It's more of a social, collectible value that people are proud to own. Social Tokens create status within a community. Think of Airline miles that generate status within a specific sphere (Airline lounge, first to enter the plane, etc..) or special perks in Discord servers\n* **Vision Incentives -** Members aren't participating \"for-profit\" (aka economic incentives) but are driven by a specific ideology. Community members will exchange your Token without a monetary value because they sincerely believed in the vision.\n* **Economic Incentives -** It doesn't require a particular strategy, and you can simply ask community members to achieve a mission in exchange for economic value. By creating a “pay-for-performance incentive scheme” (a program where you pay contributors depending on how hard they work), you allow anyone to participate and help grow the project.\n\n**A Framework to design great incentives:**\n\n* **Step 1: Determine what would drive each party to use your Token -** The first step to do so is to clearly define what members of your community are chasing by joining your community. What are their inner motivations? What would they earn by participating in the community? Why have they decided to join? You have to deeply understand their interest in collaborating with the community before creating incentives.\n* **Step 2: Determine how you can align each parties' interest -** Now that you know what you need and what other community members want, your goal is to align those interests and design targeted rewards schemes. it's all about considering the trade-offs, which balance costs and benefits. (EX: Grades at school)\n* **Step 3: Prevent bad token behaviors by disincentivizing those -** Some bad behaviors could be speculative investments, for example, where community members would buy your Token (try to raise its value) without having a positive impact on the project. One way to beat this is to provide “lock-up periods” for token-holders. Basically, you lock their token for a certain period and contributors can’t withdraw them to their wallet. Another to disincentivize bad behaviors is t reward token holders for holding your Token for a long period of time. Instead of locking their tokens, you simply tell them they’ll receive a bonus for holding the token (every 3 or 6 months for example). Great onboarding is also key to prevent those bad behaviors.\n* **Step 4: Incorporating effective performance metrics and optimizing the size of rewards -** The goal of defining clear performance metrics is to measure participants' contributions to reward them relative to their efforts. (defining clear outcomes for projects, think Forefront's bounties, and leverage web3 tools like source.cred)\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects:**\n\n* [Forefront](https://forefront.market/) - [Forefront's bounties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dt5KxK5QmOyPAHBfj81nmY-btyTd0mbPlqJByOmkSR4/edit#gid=196077105)\n* [GlobalCoinResearch](https://globalcoinresearch.com/) - [GCR’s Bounties](https://globalcoinresearch.com/2021/04/14/gcr-media-mining/)\n\nYou can [Create Bounties](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Token-Reward-Bounty-on-Coinvise-abfc94a17ebc44c6a6f4affeec779113) (incentives) on Coinvise and [integrate the Coinvise Bot on Discord](https://www.notion.so/How-to-integrate-Discord-Tipping-NFT-Bot-ce49b396acbd48309db170eae362aca1) to automate sending out the rewards.\n\n## STEP 5 - Crowdfund your project\n\n*With a growing community, some traction, a Token, and the initial contributors that have achieved the first milestones, it's now time to open the community to a broader audience and crowdfund your project to achieve bigger goals.*\n\n**There are two main ways to crowdfund a project: through Social Tokens and NFTs.**\n\n* **Through Social Token -** A creator can crowdfund money by creating a Liquidity Pool, which means letting anyone buy its token. However, the Creator will need an already strong community (otherwise no one will buy its Token), and he will lose control over its Token (as anyone can buy token, anyone can buy a large amount of Token and vote for bad decision over the future of the project.\n* **Through NFTs -** A creator can mint an NFT or a collection of NFT and its fans can then buy it. NFT can give access to gated channels for example.\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects :**\n\n* [Ethereum: The Infinite Garden](https://twitter.com/EthereumFilm) - $INFINITE\n* [Burn Alpha Novel](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) - $NOVEL\n* [Alex Masmej](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej) - $ALEX\n* [Elektra by Songcamp](https://elektra.camp/#/) - $ELEKTRA\n* [Creator Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) - $CABIN\n\nIf you're interested in knowing more about crowdfunding, you should [read this essay](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/crowdfunding-projects-through-social) that gives more insight into Web3 crowdfunding.\n\n## STEP 6 - Setting up Treasury Management & Governance\n\n*With some money in the bank from your successful crowdfunding, you'll now have to manage the Treasury and let token holders choose for the community's future.*\n\nThe purpose of any decentralized community is to capitalize on itself in such a way as to ensure its ongoing operations can continue and invest in the future growth and success of the community and projects. **Right after the crowdfunding, as a community leader, you'll have three primary missions: Distribute ownership to community members, manage the Treasury of your community and create governance mechanisms.**\n\nHere are few actions you should take during this period to achieve your missions:\n\n* **Diversify your tokens -** The diversification of your tokens is an important area to focus on. A priority for many communities' treasuries is to convert a portion of their assets into Stablecoins. With the entirety of your Treasury held in your native Token, if the price of your token falls, let's say by 40%, your balance sheet will also shrink by 40%.\n* **Create a Multisig Wallet with Gnosis.** A multi-signature wallet allows you to define an access/control scheme through multiple users that need to confirm transactions before executing them. It secures your Treasury in the hand of multiple contributors and decentralizes your community a bit more.\n* **Create Guilds/Working groups -** Creating a Multisig is not the only way to distribute ownership. Another good practice is to develop Guilds or working groups in charge of specific missions within your community. By creating these working groups, you'll be able to allocate funds to specifics teams and organize your community more thoughtfully.\n* **Manage your Treasury -** You can use [Llama](https://llama.community/), an easy tool that helps DeFi protocols, DAOs, and Social Token communities manage their treasuries, as you'll have to make payments, financial reporting, and asset allocation. You'll also have to define how the supply allocated to the Treasury would be used for. Do you want to reward members for ongoing work and activities? Provide liquidity for the secondary token market if needed (e.g. via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/))? Potentially conduct a second crowdfund?\n* **Give voting power to your community** - The easiest way to give voting power to your community is to set up a [Snapshot](http://snapshot.org/) for governance mechanisms. Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results. Anyone can submit a proposal on Snapshot, and Token holders can then vote for or against the proposal, depending on if they judge it will benefit the project. The more token you hold, the more voting power you have.\n* **Setup tools for your Discord Server -** You can use tools such as [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) or [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/) that helps you determine how much value a contribution or contributor added to a project overall and reward them easily. With Collab.Land, it’s also possible to tip your contributor and create token-gated channels according to roles and how much token someone has. You can also set up the Coinvise Bot, which allows you to automatize the process of tipping.\n* **Generate multiple income streams -** Treasury management is an essential tool for aligning and incentivizing stakeholders to work for DAOs. Competition for talented contributions is fierce, so it's vital to ensure communities are well-capitalized regardless of market conditions. DAOs & communities ought to generate multiple income streams that can cover operating expenses and make sure to attract the best talents. An option for generating multiple income streams is yield farming. This is when you lend out a cryptocurrency and earn interest in it. It serves as an investment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLaunching a Creator DAO is one small step toward building a whole new economy where every individual can thrive. Making a Creator DAO isn't just making a token, it’s thinking about the different aspects of it, thinking about the Tokenomics and the incentives you’ll create.\n\nWe're still at the beginning of Creator DAOs, and there is still so much to discover and build. The entire crypto community is experimenting with new ways to improve Creator DAOs, and the space is rapidly evolving.\n\nHowever, with this guide, you should now be more aware of launching your Creator DAO and using crypto mechanisms to achieve your high ambition goals.\n\n\n---\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234)\n\n\n---\n\n**Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  [Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en)and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/8jaQB5CZ) 🔥**\n\n\n---\n\n**Further Resources on Tokenomics:**\n\n* [Designing Internet-Native Economies: A Guide to Crypto Tokens](https://future.a16z.com/a-taxonomy-of-tokens-distinctions-with-a-difference/)\n* [Great example of how CabinDAO chose their Tech Stack](https://creators.mirror.xyz/862A5rBtKX3BC8eEircDnGwPIJJTJ33hn-MvnukByPc)\n* [Social Token as Financial Assets (Blue Version)](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)\n* [Token Supply 101: Fundamentals of token supply — and monetary policy](https://adrienbe.medium.com/token-supply-101-fundamentals-of-token-supply-and-monetary-policy-a20cc761f6ec)\n* [FLOW Token Economics](https://www.onflow.org/flow-token-economics)\n\n**Further Resources on Treasury:**\n\n* [How DAOs should approach treasury management](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-daos-should-approach-treasury)\n* [How to Structure a Protocol’s Treasury](https://shreyashariharan.com/2021/03/14/how-to-structure-a-protocols-treasury/)", "timestamp": 1630347416, "digest": "0f9g1E0Lx0uirTo61UuahYDHb3v3O-qz9Y9hBGpnYJM", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

Be proactive in onboarding community members and split the onboarding responsibilities with other key members of the DAO.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about gathering a solid community toward a joint project, you can [read this article ](https://www.notion.so/Setting-up-Treasury-Management-Governance-02cd796ad05b49cc856697a68da73bcf)sharing the best resources about the subject.\n\n## STEP 2 - Design Tokenomics\n\n*Once you have gathered a small and tight community around a shared vision, the next step is to design the Tokenomics of your project.*\n\nWe call Tokenomics all the things that enable participants to earn more tokens by contributing positively. Basically, setting up Tokenomics for your project means \"What can we put in place to incentivize my community to participate in my project.\"\n\n**To incentivize your community, there are several aspects you should dig into:**\n\n* **Token Distribution - How do you plan to reward contributors?** How much of the supply will be reserved for the DAO treasury? Do you want to do a retroactive airdrop (reward contributor for their past contributions) or everyone's winning Token from a starting point? The challenge with Token Distribution is to create efficient distribution mechanisms that would put the tokens in the hands of people willing to produce work for the network.\n* **Token design - How do you design the financial aspects of your Token?** What will be the total initial supply? Should you mint your Token on a [Fixed supply or on a Bonding curve](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)? If it's on a Bonding Curve, do you want your supply to be capped or uncapped? With Token design, you have to think about the technical and financial aspect of your Token to make sure it reflect what you want to achieve with your DAO.\n* **Price Stability - How do you manage the stability of your Token, so people are still motivated to collaborate?** What will be the anchor exchange rate with Ethereum (1ETH = 10?100?1000? of your Token)? Do you want to create an inflationary or deflationary token (monetary policy)? With which tokens do you want to bond your token (Collateral volatile or stable coin)? Price stability is an important aspect to consider as with a higher price comes speculators and with lower price comes more difficulty to incentivize community members.\n* **Governance - How do you assure fair governance and ensure the funds are distributed to the right projectS?** What rights do you give to token holders? What will be the Internal economics of your project? Governance is key to create a truly decentralized Organization.\n\nAll of the above elements will play a major role in how people collaborate in your DAO. Take the time to reflect thoroughly on the Tokenomics of your project, as it can make it skyrocket or plummet.\n\n## STEP 3 - Create a personal / community Token.\n\n*Once you’ve gathered a small knit community and have figured out the Tokenomics of your Token, the logical next step is to create a Token.*\n\nThe Token will primarily serve as social recognition as the Token doesn't have financial value at this point but will still be very effective to incentivize potential contributors. With the previous step, you should now have the answers to all the Tokenomics of your Token. The process of actually creating a token is fairly easy and pretty straightforward on Coinvise.\n\n**Here a several tutorials to help you go through these steps:**\n\n* [Create a Crypto Wallet](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Sign up on Coinvise](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Buy your first ETH](https://www.notion.so/How-to-buy-your-first-ETH-86873d84278c4495a752a6930f969f8d)\n* [Create a Personal / community Token](https://www.notion.so/How-to-mint-a-Personal-Community-Token-424196cb6f204f38b94faed3e0db301f)\n\n## STEP 4 - Design great bounties and grow your community\n\n*With a Token and early traction, the next step is to incentivize community members to be active and do tasks to help grow the project.*\n\nSocial tokens have shown their efficiency to incentivize individuals to share their skills with others. Well-designed incentives are more than crucial as they can make your project tremendously grow. They are best used when they scale or incentivize coordination and engagement between community members. Incentives are ideal when it's mutually beneficial to you and your community. This will create positive-sum games, where everyone has an aligned economic interest.\n\n**There are three main types of incentives:**\n\n* **Social incentives -** It's more of a social, collectible value that people are proud to own. Social Tokens create status within a community. Think of Airline miles that generate status within a specific sphere (Airline lounge, first to enter the plane, etc..) or special perks in Discord servers\n* **Vision Incentives -** Members aren't participating \"for-profit\" (aka economic incentives) but are driven by a specific ideology. Community members will exchange your Token without a monetary value because they sincerely believed in the vision.\n* **Economic Incentives -** It doesn't require a particular strategy, and you can simply ask community members to achieve a mission in exchange for economic value. By creating a “pay-for-performance incentive scheme” (a program where you pay contributors depending on how hard they work), you allow anyone to participate and help grow the project.\n\n**A Framework to design great incentives:**\n\n* **Step 1: Determine what would drive each party to use your Token -** The first step to do so is to clearly define what members of your community are chasing by joining your community. What are their inner motivations? What would they earn by participating in the community? Why have they decided to join? You have to deeply understand their interest in collaborating with the community before creating incentives.\n* **Step 2: Determine how you can align each parties' interest -** Now that you know what you need and what other community members want, your goal is to align those interests and design targeted rewards schemes. it's all about considering the trade-offs, which balance costs and benefits. (EX: Grades at school)\n* **Step 3: Prevent bad token behaviors by disincentivizing those -** Some bad behaviors could be speculative investments, for example, where community members would buy your Token (try to raise its value) without having a positive impact on the project. One way to beat this is to provide “lock-up periods” for token-holders. Basically, you lock their token for a certain period and contributors can’t withdraw them to their wallet. Another to disincentivize bad behaviors is t reward token holders for holding your Token for a long period of time. Instead of locking their tokens, you simply tell them they’ll receive a bonus for holding the token (every 3 or 6 months for example). Great onboarding is also key to prevent those bad behaviors.\n* **Step 4: Incorporating effective performance metrics and optimizing the size of rewards -** The goal of defining clear performance metrics is to measure participants' contributions to reward them relative to their efforts. (defining clear outcomes for projects, think Forefront's bounties, and leverage web3 tools like source.cred)\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects:**\n\n* [Forefront](https://forefront.market/) - [Forefront's bounties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dt5KxK5QmOyPAHBfj81nmY-btyTd0mbPlqJByOmkSR4/edit#gid=196077105)\n* [GlobalCoinResearch](https://globalcoinresearch.com/) - [GCR’s Bounties](https://globalcoinresearch.com/2021/04/14/gcr-media-mining/)\n\nYou can [Create Bounties](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Token-Reward-Bounty-on-Coinvise-abfc94a17ebc44c6a6f4affeec779113) (incentives) on Coinvise and [integrate the Coinvise Bot on Discord](https://www.notion.so/How-to-integrate-Discord-Tipping-NFT-Bot-ce49b396acbd48309db170eae362aca1) to automate sending out the rewards.\n\n## STEP 5 - Crowdfund your project\n\n*With a growing community, some traction, a Token, and the initial contributors that have achieved the first milestones, it's now time to open the community to a broader audience and crowdfund your project to achieve bigger goals.*\n\n**There are two main ways to crowdfund a project: through Social Tokens and NFTs.**\n\n* **Through Social Token -** A creator can crowdfund money by creating a Liquidity Pool, which means letting anyone buy its token. However, the Creator will need an already strong community (otherwise no one will buy its Token), and he will lose control over its Token (as anyone can buy token, anyone can buy a large amount of Token and vote for bad decision over the future of the project.\n* **Through NFTs -** A creator can mint an NFT or a collection of NFT and its fans can then buy it. NFT can give access to gated channels for example.\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects :**\n\n* [Ethereum: The Infinite Garden](https://twitter.com/EthereumFilm) - $INFINITE\n* [Burn Alpha Novel](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) - $NOVEL\n* [Alex Masmej](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej) - $ALEX\n* [Elektra by Songcamp](https://elektra.camp/#/) - $ELEKTRA\n* [Creator Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) - $CABIN\n\nIf you're interested in knowing more about crowdfunding, you should [read this essay](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/crowdfunding-projects-through-social) that gives more insight into Web3 crowdfunding.\n\n## STEP 6 - Setting up Treasury Management & Governance\n\n*With some money in the bank from your successful crowdfunding, you'll now have to manage the Treasury and let token holders choose for the community's future.*\n\nThe purpose of any decentralized community is to capitalize on itself in such a way as to ensure its ongoing operations can continue and invest in the future growth and success of the community and projects. **Right after the crowdfunding, as a community leader, you'll have three primary missions: Distribute ownership to community members, manage the Treasury of your community and create governance mechanisms.**\n\nHere are few actions you should take during this period to achieve your missions:\n\n* **Diversify your tokens -** The diversification of your tokens is an important area to focus on. A priority for many communities' treasuries is to convert a portion of their assets into Stablecoins. With the entirety of your Treasury held in your native Token, if the price of your token falls, let's say by 40%, your balance sheet will also shrink by 40%.\n* **Create a Multisig Wallet with Gnosis.** A multi-signature wallet allows you to define an access/control scheme through multiple users that need to confirm transactions before executing them. It secures your Treasury in the hand of multiple contributors and decentralizes your community a bit more.\n* **Create Guilds/Working groups -** Creating a Multisig is not the only way to distribute ownership. Another good practice is to develop Guilds or working groups in charge of specific missions within your community. By creating these working groups, you'll be able to allocate funds to specifics teams and organize your community more thoughtfully.\n* **Manage your Treasury -** You can use [Llama](https://llama.community/), an easy tool that helps DeFi protocols, DAOs, and Social Token communities manage their treasuries, as you'll have to make payments, financial reporting, and asset allocation. You'll also have to define how the supply allocated to the Treasury would be used for. Do you want to reward members for ongoing work and activities? Provide liquidity for the secondary token market if needed (e.g. via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/))? Potentially conduct a second crowdfund?\n* **Give voting power to your community** - The easiest way to give voting power to your community is to set up a [Snapshot](http://snapshot.org/) for governance mechanisms. Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results. Anyone can submit a proposal on Snapshot, and Token holders can then vote for or against the proposal, depending on if they judge it will benefit the project. The more token you hold, the more voting power you have.\n* **Setup tools for your Discord Server -** You can use tools such as [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) or [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/) that helps you determine how much value a contribution or contributor added to a project overall and reward them easily. With Collab.Land, it’s also possible to tip your contributor and create token-gated channels according to roles and how much token someone has. You can also set up the Coinvise Bot, which allows you to automatize the process of tipping.\n* **Generate multiple income streams -** Treasury management is an essential tool for aligning and incentivizing stakeholders to work for DAOs. Competition for talented contributions is fierce, so it's vital to ensure communities are well-capitalized regardless of market conditions. DAOs & communities ought to generate multiple income streams that can cover operating expenses and make sure to attract the best talents. An option for generating multiple income streams is yield farming. This is when you lend out a cryptocurrency and earn interest in it. It serves as an investment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLaunching a Creator DAO is one small step toward building a whole new economy where every individual can thrive. Making a Creator DAO isn't just making a token, it’s thinking about the different aspects of it, thinking about the Tokenomics and the incentives you’ll create.\n\nWe're still at the beginning of Creator DAOs, and there is still so much to discover and build. The entire crypto community is experimenting with new ways to improve Creator DAOs, and the space is rapidly evolving.\n\nHowever, with this guide, you should now be more aware of launching your Creator DAO and using crypto mechanisms to achieve your high ambition goals.\n\n\n---\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234)\n\n\n---\n\n**Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  [Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en)and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/8jaQB5CZ) 🔥**\n\n\n---\n\n**Further Resources on Tokenomics:**\n\n* [Designing Internet-Native Economies: A Guide to Crypto Tokens](https://future.a16z.com/a-taxonomy-of-tokens-distinctions-with-a-difference/)\n* [Great example of how CabinDAO chose their Tech Stack](https://creators.mirror.xyz/862A5rBtKX3BC8eEircDnGwPIJJTJ33hn-MvnukByPc)\n* [Social Token as Financial Assets (Blue Version)](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)\n* [Token Supply 101: Fundamentals of token supply — and monetary policy](https://adrienbe.medium.com/token-supply-101-fundamentals-of-token-supply-and-monetary-policy-a20cc761f6ec)\n* [FLOW Token Economics](https://www.onflow.org/flow-token-economics)\n\n**Further Resources on Treasury:**\n\n* [How DAOs should approach treasury management](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-daos-should-approach-treasury)\n* [How to Structure a Protocol’s Treasury](https://shreyashariharan.com/2021/03/14/how-to-structure-a-protocols-treasury/)", "timestamp": 1630347649, "digest": "0f9g1E0Lx0uirTo61UuahYDHb3v3O-qz9Y9hBGpnYJM", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

Entire new genres born from mashups of mashups.\n\ni co-founded a startup that finances solar-powered drip irrigation in Africa and can confirm labor intensity (even with productivity-enhancing tech like drip irrigation). personally wouldn’t look at investing in traditional agri without robotics or hydro/aeroponics. too much opex chasing too little margin that only makes sense at massive scale\n\nare we buying next to kanye?\n\nCenturies ago, explorers sailed the seas to discover lands unknown. In the 2020s, earth's continents have been charted, but a new frontier exists - the missing connection between land and a digital ledger. That's why we are building CityDAO.\n\nI subdivided land in Hawaii. It gets complex. You have to not only collect fees for maintenance but handle disputes. For example one person may just drive a small car on the road, but a neighbor farm has big heavy dump trucks (commercial) causing significantly more wear.\n\nI'm a Gitcoin Kernel fellow and VC\n\nCities are made up of a ton of people, each doing their own thing to make it function, somewhat autonomous, can create their own laws, regulation, strategies, and organized under a single banner of identity with defined limits, I mean it ain’t perfect...\n\nWe need more CityDAO IRL meetups.\n\n“private keys to the city”\n\nall funds will go to buying our first parcel and shipping the web3 and solidity parcel minting app\n\nThe 791 voting system is a cool concept but it doesn’t solve the issue of fake identities, it simply just makes it harder\n\npretty cool, I think NFTs are just getting started and will probably get used for land as well\n\nSo far the path has been subdividing. People will buy (choose) an actual parcel. My understanding of other methods (shares) is more effort needs to be done with securities laws. Lots of approaches have been discussed in the other channels\n\nHonestly might be better off building hydroponics and automating crop production. Full disclosure I’m the founder of a startup that’s 3D printing vertical towers, so I am biased towards an option like that. You can grow them pretty much anywhere, although energy costs vary based on location.\n\nthe weekend is for DAO exploration eh?\n\nSo many ideas!

DAOs are a new way to finance projects, govern communities, and share value. For every Creator, for anyone on the internet, it's now possible to collaborate, trust each other and join forces toward a joint project.\n\nEvery audience will turn into a community, and every fan will turn into a partner. With Social tokens and Creator DAOs, you'll have the power to incentivize anyone to help you achieve broader goals, meet new people and collaborate with others. DAOs, compared to traditional companies, are open, global, and transparent.\n\nEvery DAO is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all to create a successful Creator DAO. There are, however, good practices that have shown their efficiency in the past. This essay aims to give you some basic insights into how to launch a Creator DAO.\n\n## STEP 1 - Create a small group and gather strong engagement around a common goal.\n\nTo build a Creator DAO, the first thing you'll have to do is gather a small group toward a joint project. T**he goal at this stage is to gather a small community (\\~20 members) that genuinely believes in the project, and that is ready to help accomplish this vision without monetary rewards.** You can start by inviting your friends interested in the same niche that you are, post on forums, share your vision on socials or talk directly to your community if you already have one from previous projects.\n\n**The best way to attract top talent is to create a DAO with a strong culture, efficient onboarding, and well-designed incentives.** With a strong culture, you'll attract high-quality talents that will be intrinsically motivated to provide support over a sustained period.\n\n**The easiest way to onboard your first community members is to create a Telegram or a Geneva group.** Discord and Slack are also reasonable solutions but are more useful at a later stage when you need to create different channels around different subjects. Think thoroughly about all the onboarding steps to make sure anyone wanting to contribute can do it easily. Be proactive in onboarding community members and split the onboarding responsibilities with other key members of the DAO.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about gathering a solid community toward a joint project, you can [read this article ](https://www.notion.so/Setting-up-Treasury-Management-Governance-02cd796ad05b49cc856697a68da73bcf)sharing the best resources about the subject.\n\n## STEP 2 - Design Tokenomics\n\n*Once you have gathered a small and tight community around a shared vision, the next step is to design the Tokenomics of your project.*\n\nWe call Tokenomics all the things that enable participants to earn more tokens by contributing positively. Basically, setting up Tokenomics for your project means \"What can we put in place to incentivize my community to participate in my project.\"\n\n**To incentivize your community, there are several aspects you should dig into:**\n\n* **Token Distribution - How do you plan to reward contributors?** How much of the supply will be reserved for the DAO treasury? Do you want to do a retroactive airdrop (reward contributor for their past contributions) or everyone's winning Token from a starting point? The challenge with Token Distribution is to create efficient distribution mechanisms that would put the tokens in the hands of people willing to produce work for the network.\n* **Token design - How do you design the financial aspects of your Token?** What will be the total initial supply? Should you mint your Token on a [Fixed supply or on a Bonding curve](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)? If it's on a Bonding Curve, do you want your supply to be capped or uncapped? With Token design, you have to think about the technical and financial aspect of your Token to make sure it reflect what you want to achieve with your DAO.\n* **Price Stability - How do you manage the stability of your Token, so people are still motivated to collaborate?** What will be the anchor exchange rate with Ethereum (1ETH = 10?100?1000? of your Token)? Do you want to create an inflationary or deflationary token (monetary policy)? With which tokens do you want to bond your token (Collateral volatile or stable coin)? Price stability is an important aspect to consider as with a higher price comes speculators and with lower price comes more difficulty to incentivize community members.\n* **Governance - How do you assure fair governance and ensure the funds are distributed to the right projectS?** What rights do you give to token holders? What will be the Internal economics of your project? Governance is key to create a truly decentralized Organization.\n\nAll of the above elements will play a major role in how people collaborate in your DAO. Take the time to reflect thoroughly on the Tokenomics of your project, as it can make it skyrocket or plummet.\n\n## STEP 3 - Create a personal / community Token.\n\n*Once you’ve gathered a small knit community and have figured out the Tokenomics of your Token, the logical next step is to create a Token.*\n\nThe Token will primarily serve as social recognition as the Token doesn't have financial value at this point but will still be very effective to incentivize potential contributors. With the previous step, you should now have the answers to all the Tokenomics of your Token. The process of actually creating a token is fairly easy and pretty straightforward on Coinvise.\n\n**Here a several tutorials to help you go through these steps:**\n\n* [Create a Crypto Wallet](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Sign up on Coinvise](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Buy your first ETH](https://www.notion.so/How-to-buy-your-first-ETH-86873d84278c4495a752a6930f969f8d)\n* [Create a Personal / community Token](https://www.notion.so/How-to-mint-a-Personal-Community-Token-424196cb6f204f38b94faed3e0db301f)\n\n## STEP 4 - Design great bounties and grow your community\n\n*With a Token and early traction, the next step is to incentivize community members to be active and do tasks to help grow the project.*\n\nSocial tokens have shown their efficiency to incentivize individuals to share their skills with others. Well-designed incentives are more than crucial as they can make your project tremendously grow. They are best used when they scale or incentivize coordination and engagement between community members. Incentives are ideal when it's mutually beneficial to you and your community. This will create positive-sum games, where everyone has an aligned economic interest.\n\n**There are three main types of incentives:**\n\n* **Social incentives -** It's more of a social, collectible value that people are proud to own. Social Tokens create status within a community. Think of Airline miles that generate status within a specific sphere (Airline lounge, first to enter the plane, etc..) or special perks in Discord servers\n* **Vision Incentives -** Members aren't participating \"for-profit\" (aka economic incentives) but are driven by a specific ideology. Community members will exchange your Token without a monetary value because they sincerely believed in the vision.\n* **Economic Incentives -** It doesn't require a particular strategy, and you can simply ask community members to achieve a mission in exchange for economic value. By creating a “pay-for-performance incentive scheme” (a program where you pay contributors depending on how hard they work), you allow anyone to participate and help grow the project.\n\n**A Framework to design great incentives:**\n\n* **Step 1: Determine what would drive each party to use your Token -** The first step to do so is to clearly define what members of your community are chasing by joining your community. What are their inner motivations? What would they earn by participating in the community? Why have they decided to join? You have to deeply understand their interest in collaborating with the community before creating incentives.\n* **Step 2: Determine how you can align each parties' interest -** Now that you know what you need and what other community members want, your goal is to align those interests and design targeted rewards schemes. it's all about considering the trade-offs, which balance costs and benefits. (EX: Grades at school)\n* **Step 3: Prevent bad token behaviors by disincentivizing those -** Some bad behaviors could be speculative investments, for example, where community members would buy your Token (try to raise its value) without having a positive impact on the project. One way to beat this is to provide “lock-up periods” for token-holders. Basically, you lock their token for a certain period and contributors can’t withdraw them to their wallet. Another to disincentivize bad behaviors is t reward token holders for holding your Token for a long period of time. Instead of locking their tokens, you simply tell them they’ll receive a bonus for holding the token (every 3 or 6 months for example). Great onboarding is also key to prevent those bad behaviors.\n* **Step 4: Incorporating effective performance metrics and optimizing the size of rewards -** The goal of defining clear performance metrics is to measure participants' contributions to reward them relative to their efforts. (defining clear outcomes for projects, think Forefront's bounties, and leverage web3 tools like source.cred)\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects:**\n\n* [Forefront](https://forefront.market/) - [Forefront's bounties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dt5KxK5QmOyPAHBfj81nmY-btyTd0mbPlqJByOmkSR4/edit#gid=196077105)\n* [GlobalCoinResearch](https://globalcoinresearch.com/) - [GCR’s Bounties](https://globalcoinresearch.com/2021/04/14/gcr-media-mining/)\n\nYou can [Create Bounties](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Token-Reward-Bounty-on-Coinvise-abfc94a17ebc44c6a6f4affeec779113) (incentives) on Coinvise and [integrate the Coinvise Bot on Discord](https://www.notion.so/How-to-integrate-Discord-Tipping-NFT-Bot-ce49b396acbd48309db170eae362aca1) to automate sending out the rewards.\n\n## STEP 5 - Crowdfund your project\n\n*With a growing community, some traction, a Token, and the initial contributors that have achieved the first milestones, it's now time to open the community to a broader audience and crowdfund your project to achieve bigger goals.*\n\n**There are two main ways to crowdfund a project: through Social Tokens and NFTs.**\n\n* **Through Social Token -** A creator can crowdfund money by creating a Liquidity Pool, which means letting anyone buy its token. However, the Creator will need an already strong community (otherwise no one will buy its Token), and he will lose control over its Token (as anyone can buy token, anyone can buy a large amount of Token and vote for bad decision over the future of the project.\n* **Through NFTs -** A creator can mint an NFT or a collection of NFT and its fans can then buy it. NFT can give access to gated channels for example.\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects :**\n\n* [Ethereum: The Infinite Garden](https://twitter.com/EthereumFilm) - $INFINITE\n* [Burn Alpha Novel](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) - $NOVEL\n* [Alex Masmej](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej) - $ALEX\n* [Elektra by Songcamp](https://elektra.camp/#/) - $ELEKTRA\n* [Creator Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) - $CABIN\n\nIf you're interested in knowing more about crowdfunding, you should [read this essay](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/crowdfunding-projects-through-social) that gives more insight into Web3 crowdfunding.\n\n## STEP 6 - Setting up Treasury Management & Governance\n\n*With some money in the bank from your successful crowdfunding, you'll now have to manage the Treasury and let token holders choose for the community's future.*\n\nThe purpose of any decentralized community is to capitalize on itself in such a way as to ensure its ongoing operations can continue and invest in the future growth and success of the community and projects. **Right after the crowdfunding, as a community leader, you'll have three primary missions: Distribute ownership to community members, manage the Treasury of your community and create governance mechanisms.**\n\nHere are few actions you should take during this period to achieve your missions:\n\n* **Diversify your tokens -** The diversification of your tokens is an important area to focus on. A priority for many communities' treasuries is to convert a portion of their assets into Stablecoins. With the entirety of your Treasury held in your native Token, if the price of your token falls, let's say by 40%, your balance sheet will also shrink by 40%.\n* **Create a Multisig Wallet with Gnosis.** A multi-signature wallet allows you to define an access/control scheme through multiple users that need to confirm transactions before executing them. It secures your Treasury in the hand of multiple contributors and decentralizes your community a bit more.\n* **Create Guilds/Working groups -** Creating a Multisig is not the only way to distribute ownership. Another good practice is to develop Guilds or working groups in charge of specific missions within your community. By creating these working groups, you'll be able to allocate funds to specifics teams and organize your community more thoughtfully.\n* **Manage your Treasury -** You can use [Llama](https://llama.community/), an easy tool that helps DeFi protocols, DAOs, and Social Token communities manage their treasuries, as you'll have to make payments, financial reporting, and asset allocation. You'll also have to define how the supply allocated to the Treasury would be used for. Do you want to reward members for ongoing work and activities? Provide liquidity for the secondary token market if needed (e.g. via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/))? Potentially conduct a second crowdfund?\n* **Give voting power to your community** - The easiest way to give voting power to your community is to set up a [Snapshot](http://snapshot.org/) for governance mechanisms. Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results. Anyone can submit a proposal on Snapshot, and Token holders can then vote for or against the proposal, depending on if they judge it will benefit the project. The more token you hold, the more voting power you have.\n* **Setup tools for your Discord Server -** You can use tools such as [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) or [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/) that helps you determine how much value a contribution or contributor added to a project overall and reward them easily. With Collab.Land, it’s also possible to tip your contributor and create token-gated channels according to roles and how much token someone has. You can also set up the Coinvise Bot, which allows you to automatize the process of tipping.\n* **Generate multiple income streams -** Treasury management is an essential tool for aligning and incentivizing stakeholders to work for DAOs. Competition for talented contributions is fierce, so it's vital to ensure communities are well-capitalized regardless of market conditions. DAOs & communities ought to generate multiple income streams that can cover operating expenses and make sure to attract the best talents. An option for generating multiple income streams is yield farming. This is when you lend out a cryptocurrency and earn interest in it. It serves as an investment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLaunching a Creator DAO is one small step toward building a whole new economy where every individual can thrive. Making a Creator DAO isn't just making a token, it’s thinking about the different aspects of it, thinking about the Tokenomics and the incentives you’ll create.\n\nWe're still at the beginning of Creator DAOs, and there is still so much to discover and build. The entire crypto community is experimenting with new ways to improve Creator DAOs, and the space is rapidly evolving.\n\nHowever, with this guide, you should now be more aware of launching your Creator DAO and using crypto mechanisms to achieve your high ambition goals.\n\n\n---\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234)\n\n\n---\n\n**Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  [Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en)and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/8jaQB5CZ) 🔥**\n\n\n---\n\n**Further Resources on Tokenomics:**\n\n* [Designing Internet-Native Economies: A Guide to Crypto Tokens](https://future.a16z.com/a-taxonomy-of-tokens-distinctions-with-a-difference/)\n* [Great example of how CabinDAO chose their Tech Stack](https://creators.mirror.xyz/862A5rBtKX3BC8eEircDnGwPIJJTJ33hn-MvnukByPc)\n* [Social Token as Financial Assets (Blue Version)](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)\n* [Token Supply 101: Fundamentals of token supply — and monetary policy](https://adrienbe.medium.com/token-supply-101-fundamentals-of-token-supply-and-monetary-policy-a20cc761f6ec)\n* [FLOW Token Economics](https://www.onflow.org/flow-token-economics)\n\n**Further Resources on Treasury:**\n\n* [How DAOs should approach treasury management](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-daos-should-approach-treasury)\n* [How to Structure a Protocol’s Treasury](https://shreyashariharan.com/2021/03/14/how-to-structure-a-protocols-treasury/)", "timestamp": 1630346629, "digest": "0f9g1E0Lx0uirTo61UuahYDHb3v3O-qz9Y9hBGpnYJM", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

(defining clear outcomes for projects, think Forefront's bounties, and leverage web3 tools like source.cred)\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects:**\n\n* [Forefront](https://forefront.market/) - [Forefront's bounties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dt5KxK5QmOyPAHBfj81nmY-btyTd0mbPlqJByOmkSR4/edit#gid=196077105)\n* [GlobalCoinResearch](https://globalcoinresearch.com/) - [GCR’s Bounties](https://globalcoinresearch.com/2021/04/14/gcr-media-mining/)\n\nYou can [Create Bounties](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Token-Reward-Bounty-on-Coinvise-abfc94a17ebc44c6a6f4affeec779113) (incentives) on Coinvise and [integrate the Coinvise Bot on Discord](https://www.notion.so/How-to-integrate-Discord-Tipping-NFT-Bot-ce49b396acbd48309db170eae362aca1) to automate sending out the rewards.\n\n## STEP 5 - Crowdfund your project\n\n*With a growing community, some traction, a Token, and the initial contributors that have achieved the first milestones, it's now time to open the community to a broader audience and crowdfund your project to achieve bigger goals.*\n\n**There are two main ways to crowdfund a project: through Social Tokens and NFTs.**\n\n* **Through Social Token -** A creator can crowdfund money by creating a Liquidity Pool, which means letting anyone buy its token. However, the Creator will need an already strong community (otherwise no one will buy its Token), and he will lose control over its Token (as anyone can buy token, anyone can buy a large amount of Token and vote for bad decision over the future of the project.\n* **Through NFTs -** A creator can mint an NFT or a collection of NFT and its fans can then buy it. NFT can give access to gated channels for example.\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects :**\n\n* [Ethereum: The Infinite Garden](https://twitter.com/EthereumFilm) - $INFINITE\n* [Burn Alpha Novel](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) - $NOVEL\n* [Alex Masmej](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej) - $ALEX\n* [Elektra by Songcamp](https://elektra.camp/#/) - $ELEKTRA\n* [Creator Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) - $CABIN\n\nIf you're interested in knowing more about crowdfunding, you should [read this essay](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/crowdfunding-projects-through-social) that gives more insight into Web3 crowdfunding.\n\n## STEP 6 - Setting up Treasury Management & Governance\n\n*With some money in the bank from your successful crowdfunding, you'll now have to manage the Treasury and let token holders choose for the community's future.*\n\nThe purpose of any decentralized community is to capitalize on itself in such a way as to ensure its ongoing operations can continue and invest in the future growth and success of the community and projects. **Right after the crowdfunding, as a community leader, you'll have three primary missions: Distribute ownership to community members, manage the Treasury of your community and create governance mechanisms.**\n\nHere are few actions you should take during this period to achieve your missions:\n\n* **Diversify your tokens -** The diversification of your tokens is an important area to focus on. A priority for many communities' treasuries is to convert a portion of their assets into Stablecoins. With the entirety of your Treasury held in your native Token, if the price of your token falls, let's say by 40%, your balance sheet will also shrink by 40%.\n* **Create a Multisig Wallet with Gnosis.** A multi-signature wallet allows you to define an access/control scheme through multiple users that need to confirm transactions before executing them. It secures your Treasury in the hand of multiple contributors and decentralizes your community a bit more.\n* **Create Guilds/Working groups -** Creating a Multisig is not the only way to distribute ownership. Another good practice is to develop Guilds or working groups in charge of specific missions within your community. By creating these working groups, you'll be able to allocate funds to specifics teams and organize your community more thoughtfully.\n* **Manage your Treasury -** You can use [Llama](https://llama.community/), an easy tool that helps DeFi protocols, DAOs, and Social Token communities manage their treasuries, as you'll have to make payments, financial reporting, and asset allocation. You'll also have to define how the supply allocated to the Treasury would be used for. Do you want to reward members for ongoing work and activities? Provide liquidity for the secondary token market if needed (e.g. via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/))? Potentially conduct a second crowdfund?\n* **Give voting power to your community** - The easiest way to give voting power to your community is to set up a [Snapshot](http://snapshot.org/) for governance mechanisms. Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results. Anyone can submit a proposal on Snapshot, and Token holders can then vote for or against the proposal, depending on if they judge it will benefit the project. The more token you hold, the more voting power you have.\n* **Setup tools for your Discord Server -** You can use tools such as [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) or [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/) that helps you determine how much value a contribution or contributor added to a project overall and reward them easily. With Collab.Land, it’s also possible to tip your contributor and create token-gated channels according to roles and how much token someone has. You can also set up the Coinvise Bot, which allows you to automatize the process of tipping.\n* **Generate multiple income streams -** Treasury management is an essential tool for aligning and incentivizing stakeholders to work for DAOs. Competition for talented contributions is fierce, so it's vital to ensure communities are well-capitalized regardless of market conditions. DAOs & communities ought to generate multiple income streams that can cover operating expenses and make sure to attract the best talents. An option for generating multiple income streams is yield farming. This is when you lend out a cryptocurrency and earn interest in it. It serves as an investment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLaunching a Creator DAO is one small step toward building a whole new economy where every individual can thrive. Making a Creator DAO isn't just making a token, it’s thinking about the different aspects of it, thinking about the Tokenomics and the incentives you’ll create.\n\nWe're still at the beginning of Creator DAOs, and there is still so much to discover and build. The entire crypto community is experimenting with new ways to improve Creator DAOs, and the space is rapidly evolving.\n\nHowever, with this guide, you should now be more aware of launching your Creator DAO and using crypto mechanisms to achieve your high ambition goals.\n\n\n---\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234)\n\n\n---\n\n**Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  [Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en)and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/8jaQB5CZ) 🔥**\n\n\n---\n\n**Further Resources on Tokenomics:**\n\n* [Designing Internet-Native Economies: A Guide to Crypto Tokens](https://future.a16z.com/a-taxonomy-of-tokens-distinctions-with-a-difference/)\n* [Great example of how CabinDAO chose their Tech Stack](https://creators.mirror.xyz/862A5rBtKX3BC8eEircDnGwPIJJTJ33hn-MvnukByPc)\n* [Social Token as Financial Assets (Blue Version)](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)\n* [Token Supply 101: Fundamentals of token supply — and monetary policy](https://adrienbe.medium.com/token-supply-101-fundamentals-of-token-supply-and-monetary-policy-a20cc761f6ec)\n* [FLOW Token Economics](https://www.onflow.org/flow-token-economics)\n\n**Further Resources on Treasury:**\n\n* [How DAOs should approach treasury management](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-daos-should-approach-treasury)\n* [How to Structure a Protocol’s Treasury](https://shreyashariharan.com/2021/03/14/how-to-structure-a-protocols-treasury/)", "timestamp": 1630347444, "digest": "0f9g1E0Lx0uirTo61UuahYDHb3v3O-qz9Y9hBGpnYJM", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

Entire new genres born from mashups of mashups.\n\ni co-founded a startup that finances solar-powered drip irrigation in Africa and can confirm labor intensity (even with productivity-enhancing tech like drip irrigation). personally wouldn’t look at investing in traditional agri without robotics or hydro/aeroponics. too much opex chasing too little margin that only makes sense at massive scale\n\nare we buying next to kanye?\n\nCenturies ago, explorers sailed the seas to discover lands unknown. In the 2020s, earth's continents have been charted, but a new frontier exists - the missing connection between land and a digital ledger. That's why we are building CityDAO.\n\nI subdivided land in Hawaii. It gets complex. You have to not only collect fees for maintenance but handle disputes. For example one person may just drive a small car on the road, but a neighbor farm has big heavy dump trucks (commercial) causing significantly more wear.\n\nI'm a Gitcoin Kernel fellow and VC\n\nCities are made up of a ton of people, each doing their own thing to make it function, somewhat autonomous, can create their own laws, regulation, strategies, and organized under a single banner of identity with defined limits, I mean it ain’t perfect...\n\nWe need more CityDAO IRL meetups.\n\n“private keys to the city”\n\nall funds will go to buying our first parcel and shipping the web3 and solidity parcel minting app\n\nThe 791 voting system is a cool concept but it doesn’t solve the issue of fake identities, it simply just makes it harder\n\npretty cool, I think NFTs are just getting started and will probably get used for land as well\n\nSo far the path has been subdividing. People will buy (choose) an actual parcel. My understanding of other methods (shares) is more effort needs to be done with securities laws. Lots of approaches have been discussed in the other channels\n\nHonestly might be better off building hydroponics and automating crop production. Full disclosure I’m the founder of a startup that’s 3D printing vertical towers, so I am biased towards an option like that. You can grow them pretty much anywhere, although energy costs vary based on location.\n\nthe weekend is for DAO exploration eh?\n\nSo many ideas! It’s just about building up to them, and not going bankrupt trying to do one at the start.\n\nMay be far in ideology but solving the Byzantine General's problem, alongside reading the Ottoman Empire book could yield something connected to DAOs\n\nReady for DAOCon summer 2022\n\nDidn't imagine folks to know about Seoul but yeah, Heabanchon is the place obviously. Definitely should contact me whenever you visit Seoul\n\nStarting to think local DAO concierge service might actually be an interesting play for City DAO business model\n\n# ☕️ Resources shared in CityDAO\n\n☕️ Shout-out to @jasminew and @scottfits for sharing this super inspiring project:\n\n[https://rewilder.xyz/](https://rewilder.xyz/)\n\n☕️ I know I know I know I’m biased, but @0xYeurri & @Iamjason shared this article in CityDAO and it’s a great read!

DAOs are a new way to finance projects, govern communities, and share value. For every Creator, for anyone on the internet, it's now possible to collaborate, trust each other and join forces toward a joint project.\n\nEvery audience will turn into a community, and every fan will turn into a partner. With Social tokens and Creator DAOs, you'll have the power to incentivize anyone to help you achieve broader goals, meet new people and collaborate with others. DAOs, compared to traditional companies, are open, global, and transparent.\n\nEvery DAO is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all to create a successful Creator DAO. There are, however, good practices that have shown their efficiency in the past. This essay aims to give you some basic insights into how to launch a Creator DAO.\n\n## STEP 1 - Create a small group and gather strong engagement around a common goal.\n\nTo build a Creator DAO, the first thing you'll have to do is gather a small group toward a joint project. T**he goal at this stage is to gather a small community (\\~20 members) that genuinely believes in the project, and that is ready to help accomplish this vision without monetary rewards.** You can start by inviting your friends interested in the same niche that you are, post on forums, share your vision on socials or talk directly to your community if you already have one from previous projects.\n\n**The best way to attract top talent is to create a DAO with a strong culture, efficient onboarding, and well-designed incentives.** With a strong culture, you'll attract high-quality talents that will be intrinsically motivated to provide support over a sustained period.\n\n**The easiest way to onboard your first community members is to create a Telegram or a Geneva group.** Discord and Slack are also reasonable solutions but are more useful at a later stage when you need to create different channels around different subjects. Think thoroughly about all the onboarding steps to make sure anyone wanting to contribute can do it easily. Be proactive in onboarding community members and split the onboarding responsibilities with other key members of the DAO.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about gathering a solid community toward a joint project, you can [read this article ](https://www.notion.so/Setting-up-Treasury-Management-Governance-02cd796ad05b49cc856697a68da73bcf)sharing the best resources about the subject.\n\n## STEP 2 - Design Tokenomics\n\n*Once you have gathered a small and tight community around a shared vision, the next step is to design the Tokenomics of your project.*\n\nWe call Tokenomics all the things that enable participants to earn more tokens by contributing positively. Basically, setting up Tokenomics for your project means \"What can we put in place to incentivize my community to participate in my project.\"\n\n**To incentivize your community, there are several aspects you should dig into:**\n\n* **Token Distribution - How do you plan to reward contributors?** How much of the supply will be reserved for the DAO treasury? Do you want to do a retroactive airdrop (reward contributor for their past contributions) or everyone's winning Token from a starting point? The challenge with Token Distribution is to create efficient distribution mechanisms that would put the tokens in the hands of people willing to produce work for the network.\n* **Token design - How do you design the financial aspects of your Token?** What will be the total initial supply? Should you mint your Token on a [Fixed supply or on a Bonding curve](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)? If it's on a Bonding Curve, do you want your supply to be capped or uncapped? With Token design, you have to think about the technical and financial aspect of your Token to make sure it reflect what you want to achieve with your DAO.\n* **Price Stability - How do you manage the stability of your Token, so people are still motivated to collaborate?** What will be the anchor exchange rate with Ethereum (1ETH = 10?100?1000? of your Token)? Do you want to create an inflationary or deflationary token (monetary policy)? With which tokens do you want to bond your token (Collateral volatile or stable coin)? Price stability is an important aspect to consider as with a higher price comes speculators and with lower price comes more difficulty to incentivize community members.\n* **Governance - How do you assure fair governance and ensure the funds are distributed to the right projectS?** What rights do you give to token holders? What will be the Internal economics of your project? Governance is key to create a truly decentralized Organization.\n\nAll of the above elements will play a major role in how people collaborate in your DAO. Take the time to reflect thoroughly on the Tokenomics of your project, as it can make it skyrocket or plummet.\n\n## STEP 3 - Create a personal / community Token.\n\n*Once you’ve gathered a small knit community and have figured out the Tokenomics of your Token, the logical next step is to create a Token.*\n\nThe Token will primarily serve as social recognition as the Token doesn't have financial value at this point but will still be very effective to incentivize potential contributors. With the previous step, you should now have the answers to all the Tokenomics of your Token. The process of actually creating a token is fairly easy and pretty straightforward on Coinvise.\n\n**Here a several tutorials to help you go through these steps:**\n\n* [Create a Crypto Wallet](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Sign up on Coinvise](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Buy your first ETH](https://www.notion.so/How-to-buy-your-first-ETH-86873d84278c4495a752a6930f969f8d)\n* [Create a Personal / community Token](https://www.notion.so/How-to-mint-a-Personal-Community-Token-424196cb6f204f38b94faed3e0db301f)\n\n## STEP 4 - Design great bounties and grow your community\n\n*With a Token and early traction, the next step is to incentivize community members to be active and do tasks to help grow the project.*\n\nSocial tokens have shown their efficiency to incentivize individuals to share their skills with others. Well-designed incentives are more than crucial as they can make your project tremendously grow. They are best used when they scale or incentivize coordination and engagement between community members. Incentives are ideal when it's mutually beneficial to you and your community. This will create positive-sum games, where everyone has an aligned economic interest.\n\n**There are three main types of incentives:**\n\n* **Social incentives -** It's more of a social, collectible value that people are proud to own. Social Tokens create status within a community. Think of Airline miles that generate status within a specific sphere (Airline lounge, first to enter the plane, etc..) or special perks in Discord servers\n* **Vision Incentives -** Members aren't participating \"for-profit\" (aka economic incentives) but are driven by a specific ideology. Community members will exchange your Token without a monetary value because they sincerely believed in the vision.\n* **Economic Incentives -** It doesn't require a particular strategy, and you can simply ask community members to achieve a mission in exchange for economic value. By creating a “pay-for-performance incentive scheme” (a program where you pay contributors depending on how hard they work), you allow anyone to participate and help grow the project.\n\n**A Framework to design great incentives:**\n\n* **Step 1: Determine what would drive each party to use your Token -** The first step to do so is to clearly define what members of your community are chasing by joining your community. What are their inner motivations? What would they earn by participating in the community? Why have they decided to join? You have to deeply understand their interest in collaborating with the community before creating incentives.\n* **Step 2: Determine how you can align each parties' interest -** Now that you know what you need and what other community members want, your goal is to align those interests and design targeted rewards schemes. it's all about considering the trade-offs, which balance costs and benefits. (EX: Grades at school)\n* **Step 3: Prevent bad token behaviors by disincentivizing those -** Some bad behaviors could be speculative investments, for example, where community members would buy your Token (try to raise its value) without having a positive impact on the project. One way to beat this is to provide “lock-up periods” for token-holders. Basically, you lock their token for a certain period and contributors can’t withdraw them to their wallet. Another to disincentivize bad behaviors is t reward token holders for holding your Token for a long period of time. Instead of locking their tokens, you simply tell them they’ll receive a bonus for holding the token (every 3 or 6 months for example). Great onboarding is also key to prevent those bad behaviors.\n* **Step 4: Incorporating effective performance metrics and optimizing the size of rewards -** The goal of defining clear performance metrics is to measure participants' contributions to reward them relative to their efforts. (defining clear outcomes for projects, think Forefront's bounties, and leverage web3 tools like source.cred)\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects:**\n\n* [Forefront](https://forefront.market/) - [Forefront's bounties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dt5KxK5QmOyPAHBfj81nmY-btyTd0mbPlqJByOmkSR4/edit#gid=196077105)\n* [GlobalCoinResearch](https://globalcoinresearch.com/) - [GCR’s Bounties](https://globalcoinresearch.com/2021/04/14/gcr-media-mining/)\n\nYou can [Create Bounties](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Token-Reward-Bounty-on-Coinvise-abfc94a17ebc44c6a6f4affeec779113) (incentives) on Coinvise and [integrate the Coinvise Bot on Discord](https://www.notion.so/How-to-integrate-Discord-Tipping-NFT-Bot-ce49b396acbd48309db170eae362aca1) to automate sending out the rewards.\n\n## STEP 5 - Crowdfund your project\n\n*With a growing community, some traction, a Token, and the initial contributors that have achieved the first milestones, it's now time to open the community to a broader audience and crowdfund your project to achieve bigger goals.*\n\n**There are two main ways to crowdfund a project: through Social Tokens and NFTs.**\n\n* **Through Social Token -** A creator can crowdfund money by creating a Liquidity Pool, which means letting anyone buy its token. However, the Creator will need an already strong community (otherwise no one will buy its Token), and he will lose control over its Token (as anyone can buy token, anyone can buy a large amount of Token and vote for bad decision over the future of the project.\n* **Through NFTs -** A creator can mint an NFT or a collection of NFT and its fans can then buy it. NFT can give access to gated channels for example.\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects :**\n\n* [Ethereum: The Infinite Garden](https://twitter.com/EthereumFilm) - $INFINITE\n* [Burn Alpha Novel](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) - $NOVEL\n* [Alex Masmej](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej) - $ALEX\n* [Elektra by Songcamp](https://elektra.camp/#/) - $ELEKTRA\n* [Creator Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) - $CABIN\n\nIf you're interested in knowing more about crowdfunding, you should [read this essay](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/crowdfunding-projects-through-social) that gives more insight into Web3 crowdfunding.\n\n## STEP 6 - Setting up Treasury Management & Governance\n\n*With some money in the bank from your successful crowdfunding, you'll now have to manage the Treasury and let token holders choose for the community's future.*\n\nThe purpose of any decentralized community is to capitalize on itself in such a way as to ensure its ongoing operations can continue and invest in the future growth and success of the community and projects. **Right after the crowdfunding, as a community leader, you'll have three primary missions: Distribute ownership to community members, manage the Treasury of your community and create governance mechanisms.**\n\nHere are few actions you should take during this period to achieve your missions:\n\n* **Diversify your tokens -** The diversification of your tokens is an important area to focus on. A priority for many communities' treasuries is to convert a portion of their assets into Stablecoins. With the entirety of your Treasury held in your native Token, if the price of your token falls, let's say by 40%, your balance sheet will also shrink by 40%.\n* **Create a Multisig Wallet with Gnosis.** A multi-signature wallet allows you to define an access/control scheme through multiple users that need to confirm transactions before executing them. It secures your Treasury in the hand of multiple contributors and decentralizes your community a bit more.\n* **Create Guilds/Working groups -** Creating a Multisig is not the only way to distribute ownership. Another good practice is to develop Guilds or working groups in charge of specific missions within your community. By creating these working groups, you'll be able to allocate funds to specifics teams and organize your community more thoughtfully.\n* **Manage your Treasury -** You can use [Llama](https://llama.community/), an easy tool that helps DeFi protocols, DAOs, and Social Token communities manage their treasuries, as you'll have to make payments, financial reporting, and asset allocation. You'll also have to define how the supply allocated to the Treasury would be used for. Do you want to reward members for ongoing work and activities? Provide liquidity for the secondary token market if needed (e.g. via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/))? Potentially conduct a second crowdfund?\n* **Give voting power to your community** - The easiest way to give voting power to your community is to set up a [Snapshot](http://snapshot.org/) for governance mechanisms. Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results. Anyone can submit a proposal on Snapshot, and Token holders can then vote for or against the proposal, depending on if they judge it will benefit the project. The more token you hold, the more voting power you have.\n* **Setup tools for your Discord Server -** You can use tools such as [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) or [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/) that helps you determine how much value a contribution or contributor added to a project overall and reward them easily. With Collab.Land, it’s also possible to tip your contributor and create token-gated channels according to roles and how much token someone has. You can also set up the Coinvise Bot, which allows you to automatize the process of tipping.\n* **Generate multiple income streams -** Treasury management is an essential tool for aligning and incentivizing stakeholders to work for DAOs. Competition for talented contributions is fierce, so it's vital to ensure communities are well-capitalized regardless of market conditions. DAOs & communities ought to generate multiple income streams that can cover operating expenses and make sure to attract the best talents. An option for generating multiple income streams is yield farming. This is when you lend out a cryptocurrency and earn interest in it. It serves as an investment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLaunching a Creator DAO is one small step toward building a whole new economy where every individual can thrive. Making a Creator DAO isn't just making a token, it’s thinking about the different aspects of it, thinking about the Tokenomics and the incentives you’ll create.\n\nWe're still at the beginning of Creator DAOs, and there is still so much to discover and build. The entire crypto community is experimenting with new ways to improve Creator DAOs, and the space is rapidly evolving.\n\nHowever, with this guide, you should now be more aware of launching your Creator DAO and using crypto mechanisms to achieve your high ambition goals.\n\n\n---\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234)\n\n\n---\n\n**Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  [Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en)and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/8jaQB5CZ) 🔥**\n\n\n---\n\n**Further Resources on Tokenomics:**\n\n* [Designing Internet-Native Economies: A Guide to Crypto Tokens](https://future.a16z.com/a-taxonomy-of-tokens-distinctions-with-a-difference/)\n* [Great example of how CabinDAO chose their Tech Stack](https://creators.mirror.xyz/862A5rBtKX3BC8eEircDnGwPIJJTJ33hn-MvnukByPc)\n* [Social Token as Financial Assets (Blue Version)](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)\n* [Token Supply 101: Fundamentals of token supply — and monetary policy](https://adrienbe.medium.com/token-supply-101-fundamentals-of-token-supply-and-monetary-policy-a20cc761f6ec)\n* [FLOW Token Economics](https://www.onflow.org/flow-token-economics)\n\n**Further Resources on Treasury:**\n\n* [How DAOs should approach treasury management](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-daos-should-approach-treasury)\n* [How to Structure a Protocol’s Treasury](https://shreyashariharan.com/2021/03/14/how-to-structure-a-protocols-treasury/)", "timestamp": 1630354539, "digest": "0f9g1E0Lx0uirTo61UuahYDHb3v3O-qz9Y9hBGpnYJM", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

It's been quite a fun journey, and I'd love to share the path I took and some of the lessons learned.\n\n![First Bankless Receipt](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/faf4ac13-404e-4e31-bb87-7c76d3470569.png?height=200&width=567)\n\n## Life Before Crypto:\n\nBefore I entered crypto, I worked at a large investment bank in their rotational grad program. Over two years, I worked with different teams on everything from managing the bank's liquidity to our commercial real estate portfolio.\n\nWhen I started there in the Summer of 2019, I saw there was a lot of unstructured data both public and internal that could be leveraged with the right tools. I quickly decided I needed to upskill from just Excel, and immediately began learning Python to do some time series forecasting for [liquidity risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidityrisk.asp). I would read every day about [autoregressive and moving average models](https://machinelearningmastery.com/arima-for-time-series-forecasting-with-python/), try to implement them for some basic dataset, and then do a presentation to my few coworkers to get their feedback. That feedback would lead to lessons learned on how I could better apply and communicate my findings, but also would usually end with \"here's this other person who you can learn from about this\". This would create multiple avenues of learning to then go down again, repeating the process. I eventually called this a `learn-build-teach` cycle, and it helped me stay motivated and keep momentum.\n\n![\"present\" was probably more accurate than \"teach\" in the early days](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/be19ff03-d6e8-4a3b-9ead-4da757578bf2.png?height=569&width=1756)\n\nAfter a while, I realized that I did most of my learning through reading other peoples' presentations on what they had already built (mostly on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/)). Around May of 2020, I wanted to try and give back to the data science community and write about the skills and projects I'd developed over time. This was a great way to learn in the open where I would get comments or messages giving me feedback, and also led to many new connections on LinkedIn who were farther out from my usual network.\n\nI was heavily reliant on developer communities when learning various Python packages, and could clearly tell the difference between a product that was loved by its community versus one that didn't really connect as well with newer developers. Seeing the stark differences, I decided to go deep down the community software-as-a-service rabbit hole to find out what tools were being built to help dev tool product teams with building their communities. This research led me to conversations with builders like John Yen (Yeniverse), and Patrick Woods (orbit.love). They inspired me to try and improve the developer onboarding experience for dev tooling communities.\n\nThis started with building an NLP analysis product that could help with three things:\n\n1. identify the most commonly asked questions to enhance or auto-generate an FAQ page.\n2. match questions and answers to create an auto-response discord bot. The idea here was just to try and save the team time.\n3. identity the questions developers ask over time in the discord to map out when users try and develop with different features. This could help with user research and also product road mapping.\n\nWhile that endeavor of mine didn't get too far, this had planted a seed in me to continue observing and thinking about community building. Fall of 2020 came along, and I began to tap into one of the most well-connected and vibrant communities out there: Ethereum. Right away I could see that everything was open, from the data to the code to the people. This was a large departure from traditional finance, *where it often takes months just to get a conversation or data partnership going within the same bank*.\n\n## How I Got Started:\n\nIt took many many tries over the years to start \"getting into\" Ethereum. In July of 2020 I took a more serious stab at it; I tried reading and re-reading the Ethereum and Uniswap whitepapers, digesting my transactions on Etherscan, and listening to various podcast interviews. Bankless helped me understand the people and ideas to follow, but things didn't fully click until I started learning Solidity. Some helpful soul linked me to a tweet from Linda Xie mentioning an Ethereum developer onboarding session happening over the weekend, and that one-hour session led by Linda, Trent, and Austin probably contributed a lot to me changing my career path.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCk9-KG9cJA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCk9-KG9cJA)\n\nI barely knew what \"full-stack development\" meant, since most of my experience up to then was purely analytics of financial statements (writing scripts that didn't even remotely resemble building an app). But in that short session, we were all walked through the smart contract dapp development process and tools, and then given a clear guide to start with. The exact path I took during that September to November period looked like this:\n\n1. Watch all of [eth.build](http://eth.build) to understand wallets, transactions, and proof of work/authority consensus mechanisms in an interactive way\n2. Go through all six lessons of [Cryptozombies.io](http://cryptozombies.io) (the web3.js chapter may be a bit dated, so skipping it and learning to use ethers.js could be better instead)\n3. Go through [Austin's Bowtie Friday videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAc2FtC0_s) to learn scaffold-eth basics.\n4. Go through all of [solidity-by-example](https://solidity-by-example.org/) to understand common use cases like transferring ETH and working with ERC20 and ERC721 tokens. This is also a good intro to some common security risks in smart contracts such as reentrancy.\n5. Participate in ETHOnline 2020 Hackathon (by the way [ETHOnline 2021 is kicking off soon](https://ethglobal.online/)), [creating a full-stack dapp in under 30 days](https://github.com/LucidityDev/DFTP-core) while also [pitching the final product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaDzifphaLc) to a panel of judges.\n   1. I asked tons of questions in the hardhat discord to help me learn test suites and ethers.js concepts (thank you bunches @alcuadrado and @fvictorio)\n   2. the hackathon sponsor list is helpful for both using bounties to define the project and also to motivate studying the various products and tooling available (I remember [setting up this page](https://www.notion.so/7904bf1ccd294aa286f3fec7fb0cfde4) at the start)\n   3. after [winning the Gnosis prize](https://twitter.com/gnosisPM/status/1322240602369597443), my partner Diego and I ended up [taking this to a UNICEF MVP](https://app.gitbook.com/@ath310/s/lucidity/) over the following months.\n   4. I wrote about my [first Ethereum hackathon experience](https://medium.com/coinmonks/six-lessons-learned-as-a-prize-winner-from-the-ethonline-2020-hackathon-4c291ed49738) to cap it all off\n\nAfter this experience, I was convinced that crypto was indeed the future and I needed to go much deeper into the ecosystem. This was very exhausting though, with about 6-7 hours of learning and coding every day after work during that period.\n\n*As a side note, if I was to go back in time I would have started by looking at Dune dashboards before diving into solidity development since I think looking at data from events and function calls is a much easier starting point for learning Ethereum than reading contracts on Etherscan or trying to understand the protocol level elements right away.*\n\n## The Compounding Power of Learning and Contribution\n\nI continued with on-off momentum through the rest of November and December, until I joined Kernel Block 2 in January. @KERNEL0x has an element of referrals/applications - but getting noticed happens largely through contributing publicly. @sm_judge reached out to me because I'd started participating more in hackathons with @ethglobal:\n\n![On LinkedIn, since that's where I networked for traditional finance](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/18cb8e41-cc4e-40bc-a11a-5cefd3113603.png?height=529&width=453)\n\nShortly after KB2 started, [Sishir](https://twitter.com/__sishir) found me in the KB2 slack channel and asked if I wanted to join [Spectral team](https://spectral.finance/) to do solidity research and architecture - on-chain credit scoring sounded pretty interesting and close to my finance knowledge domain, so I joined them part-time. Around the same time, I took up a business analyst role at Consensys both to learn product management and to see how enterprises really thought about blockchain. By early March I was fairly comfortable with the basics of Ethereum/Solidity and was getting more familiar with the teams of many larger projects in the space.\n\nThis career shift from an investment bank to crypto/tech kicked off a three-month full ecosystem mapping period, which was formative for helping me figure out what problems there were to solve and which communities I vibed with the most.\n\nThere were three main reasons I needed to spend the time doing this:\n\n1. *It isn't clear how things got to where they are today.* For example, what are the different parts of the crypto wallet, and which were built first and why? How have certain communities form around or leave behind different problems?\n2. *It isn't clear where things are going in the short or medium term.* There are so many different solutions proposed and attempted every day that it's hard for a generalist to understand things at a glance. This was especially true for me when I was studying interchain bridges.\n3. *I had no idea what I wanted to do within crypto, but I knew it likely wasn't going to be in defi.* Spectral was much closer to the identity side of defi, which is what had initially piqued my interest.\n\nThe big idea I kept hearing about since day one was \"composability\", so I decided to dive in and see just how composable every part of the Ethereum ecosystem was. I think things were already loosely clear to me, but researching and writing it out helped me really understand [which elements of the product stack were composable](https://medium.com/coinmonks/crypto-and-web-3-0-are-the-future-of-product-and-work-3d19e3733181), how [open communities means fractals form elegantly around problem spaces](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-network-and-make-friends-in-crypto-796e123e9584), and the incredible importance of infrastructure composability when it comes to both [wallets](https://medium.com/coinmonks/1the-importance-of-composable-wallets-for-users-and-developers-accb2aadff49) and [interchain bridges](https://ath.mirror.xyz/Y2XBh3HRu5B0S3qw974txvIv0JDz7Tu-yIKVTes7DUU). All this exploration culminated in my research on the [composability of identity](https://ath.mirror.xyz/mDu_nGsWpjvF-KaPLADwxeAMfze3UJOtTAQi2CwPwWc), where I connected my thinking across all of the previous dimensions.\n\nAlong the way, I had many helpful conversations across a dozen communities and leaders, who gave me insight into how they thought about problems (or how they didn't). As I watched these communities grow, I started to notice a strong trend with their hires. Oftentimes, these new hires were already strong contributors within the community. This went against my notion that you should build up your resume first and then apply to a company/job. This is a very important frame of mind that anyone trying to break into crypto needs to quickly build up: **contribute, don't apply.**\n\nOne good example is @artblocks, which has one of the strongest and most vibrant communities in crypto. Their hires of @ponyo and @druid are perfect examples of contributors who were always present.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/557f2d9f-7332-44f9-a7cd-f8d13f784aa7.png?height=428&width=1272)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f5e907f4-f1df-455b-af79-7ab1774db0e5.png?height=294&width=1333)\n\nAnother obvious shill for me is @DuneAnalytics. Becoming a @DuneAnalytics wizard 🧙🏼‍♂️ requires consistently showing up in the discord, making helpful dashboards or queries, and otherwise contributing to the community in a meaningful way. Over time, you'll be exposed to many bounty opportunities, get reached to by other companies looking for data/crypto experts, and maybe get tapped for hire by the Dune team. You can tell that the community and team are closely aligned and working together, purely based on the fact that outsiders have trouble separating the two:\n\n[https://twitter.com/drakedanner/status/1415327134143426567](https://twitter.com/drakedanner/status/1415327134143426567)\n\n[My recent collaboration](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297/status/1420775190724755460) and constant engagement with the Mirror community led directly to my eventual hire. It all started with a single tweet analyzing the $WRITE race.\n\n[https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297/status/1415055142928490500](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297/status/1415055142928490500)\n\nI want to stress that contributing can be literally anything: engineering product 🏗️, data analytics 📊, shipping memes 🍍, coordinating the masses ☎️, etc. Don't overcomplicate the task, but do take the time to find the missing links within or between communities 🔗.  Once this contribution lightbulb clicks, you'll start to see opportunities everywhere and the whole crypto space will start to open up to you. From finding your way into a community to eventually joining the team, it's all about finding a way to contribute. Contributions may sound a little too transactional, so I like to think about it as community building.\n\n## Community, Community, Community\n\nEarlier I called `learn-build-teach` a cycle, but it looks more like a branching tree because the work is spread over a wide breadth of topics and audiences (most of whom you never really interact with repeatedly). However, once you understand the connection between contribution and community you can build a learning flywheel that brings you closer to the community and its mission. In a great [0xSTATION article](https://station.mirror.xyz/xlPSC6PYsazGxjo-pqyaV8M4ujtWapxhCmVQfBjmN9o), this product flywheel came up in relation to a person's lifecycle in a community:\n\n![https://station.mirror.xyz/xlPSC6PYsazGxjo-pqyaV8M4ujtWapxhCmVQfBjmN9o](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/097b5e6e-6b27-4036-a136-6c885ab4113d.png?height=651&width=713)\n\nThe new community-contribution driven flywheel is a linear and actionable version of the `contribution <> consumption` portion in the flow above:\n\n![Thanks to Emily for helping me put this together](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2689ef8d-f3f1-4d0e-9e5d-4c5bd6c26379.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\nOne example of this cycle is the story *behind* how I became a Dune Wizard. When I first started learning about Dune and hopping around the Discord in April, I noticed that most people were struggling with learning SQL, Ethereum, or both. Pointing to guides that taught only one of the two domains led to a large learning friction. So, I decided to learn Dune with some simple example queries, and then use those to write articles on how to learn SQL and Ethereum at the same time on Dune. I started with [a beginner](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-guide-to-basic-sql-while-learning-ethereum-at-the-same-time-9eac17a05929) and then [an advanced](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-guide-to-intermediate-sql-while-learning-ethereum-at-the-same-time-7b25119ef1e2) guide, which together has now garnered over 20k views on Medium (expert guide coming later this year). I've continued using and improving this teaching-as-contribution methodology over the last few months, doing deep dives with my friend 0xkowloon on interesting new protocols like [barnbridge](https://towardsdatascience.com/learning-sql-and-ethereum-part-3-5422f080ad36) and [fractional_art](https://medium.com/coinmonks/dissecting-the-fractional-protocol-dc3867584bdb).\n\n**The larger point here I want to make about contributions is that what you create doesn't have to be crazy innovative or even tackle the core product/problem of a community.** Building an intrapreneur skillset and perspective will serve you much better 90% of the time instead of focusing on an entrepreneurial approach when trying to contribute to a community for the first time. Since in crypto we see innovations every day, I think this creates a pressure that makes it hard for most people (me included) to balance the two ways of thinking. If this feels abstract, then think about it as building something for the ease of use or building of a product rather than just extending the use of the product itself. Intrapreneurs are usually born from environments where there are lots of silos and collective improvements that can be made. This is typically found at a large enterprise company, where a lot of your efforts are around making collaboration and knowledge sharing more accessible by creating a mix of solutions such as clearer standards, working groups, or dashboards/applications. Open communities in Ethereum make intrapreneurship a lot easier to learn as there is usually less bureaucracy around budgets and more political will to chase and implement changes, even though the communities are large in size.\n\n## Looking Forward and Joining Mirror\n\nJoining Mirror means that for the first time in my professional life, I'll be devoting all my efforts to one thing instead of multitasking many projects at once. It's a big decision for me, one that's driven by my interest to understand exactly what community building looks like over time and how the process can be made more fluid or fun.\n\nI've thought for almost a year now about the kinds of issues communities face while growing, starting from developer communities and now more recently on DAOs. Over time, my goal has become more refined: I want to build tools that enable and incentivize contributions within a community, and also make it easier to see the full context of and leverage a community's social graph. These are key elements to strong community building, and I believe will be core to Mirror's mission. Having the opportunity to build up a strong community around this tooling is a huge motivator for my move as well.\n\nThose are some pretty dense sentences, so let me break down my decision to join Mirror further:\n\n* **The Product:**\n  * So far I've only worked on/with various defi protocols, and seeing/using the creator block contracts produced by the team (such as edition crowdfund and splits) felt like such a breath of fresh air. I'm excited to see further iterations leverage what has been built in defi already.\n  * There's a lot of creative space in NFTs and transactions that build connections to people instead of pools. This includes variations on the NFTs themselves, auction mechanisms, ownership structures, and much more.\n* **The Team:**\n  * I've spoken with Patrick, Graeme, Jon-Kyle, and Denis over the past few months, and I found myself constantly inspired by our conversations. They have a lot more experience than me in building and thinking about products (especially in consumer), so I greatly look forward to learning more from them and the rest of the team.\n  * The team has a rare balance I haven't seen that often, which is a willingness to think big but the ability to still execute quickly. I experienced this firsthand while working with them on the $WRITE token airdrop.\n* **The Community:**\n  * Sybil resistance methods can be useful for a lot more than just unique identities, and I think the $WRITE race is a perfect example of this. When what you're signaling is much more than just \"I think this is a real person,\" the implications on the strength of a community are tenfold. I still remember those who gave me even just one vote in the race, and I'm sure others feel the same. It's also probably one of the only \"governance\" functions that have an active voting participation of greater than 30% (without using delegation).\n  * While right now I think the community is already very strong on Twitter and Discord, I'm very excited by how the physical world will eventually play a role in this too. I'd imagine one day we'd have a coworking space, and be able to work together with DAOs and creators who want to sit in for a day or two. I see Mirror as being a natural fit for this, given the product and community ethos.\n* **The Data:**\n  * It goes without saying that the possibilities within the data played a huge factor in my decision. First and foremost that lies in the potential applications of [graph data science](https://ath.mirror.xyz/aYOJc8pihb9wxI___QR9qmM5mQ4caUyQhHJIlevspjw), essentially analyzing our interaction networks on various levels for insights that further collaboration and contribution. The fact that the data could easily drive new products or economic distributions is extremely exciting to me.\n  * [Crypto-native UX research](https://ath.mirror.xyz/l_-4fQ08cpxUZpn9V9S5R27wfKvNgdnrXlZAWZWvdlg) is also a fairly unexplored field, I think there are some very creative data and user group applications we can make here. For one, user behaviors can be put together from across various platforms (instead of just studying behaviors on my platform like you would in Web2). I can understand auction behaviors using Artblocks, Mirror, and Opensea data to get even stronger user personas to drive product development. I do hope to collaborate with other teams across crypto to collectively improve the UX of Web3.\n  * Lastly, the creative space within [data-driven design of tokenomics](https://ath.mirror.xyz/CdU80CItQr-qTZgTzymfFDEBSnz2YbgnwXGYgkQJfCs) (with a focus on continual distributions) cannot be understated. Closely studying the repeated game theory and micro-economies that will come from Mirror should lead to some innovative token mechanisms and tools. I'm keen to explore how protocol token distributions can inform different approaches for creator/DAO tokens on the platform (and vice versa).\n\nNow I want to emphasize that there is no single path through crypto, but I hope that sharing my experiences and how my thinking/methods of navigating the space led me to my dream job will be helpful to someone out there. I want to give a huge thank you to everyone who has supported me and come along on this journey thus far!\n\n*Thank you to [Elena](https://twitter.com/VirtualElena) for proofreading and providing very helpful comments* 🙂", "timestamp": 1630362652, "digest": "NyefDE67rJEvcM9tAJkf3zHptN7vuaO1MJlpSaSc7O0", "contributor": "0x2Ae8c972fB2E6c00ddED8986E2dc672ED190DA06"}

{"id": "d0i-CVWAovnVl6y16iOjxzmc6QTPmyL7UnQBqtIITKc", "title": "What I talk about when I talk about autonomy", "body": "### During the last ten years I've watched myself grow more and more depressed about my options and operational possibilities as an artist in the digital realm. I felt like spending time and ressources on writing, recording and producing the music I wanted to was to no avail.\n\nI've often used the term autonomy when I've tried to describe what it is about Web3 that excites me so. Autonomy to me is the ability to act, to evolve and react to the things around you. In music it means being able to change modes, have new ideas and test them, work on new styles and explore novel approaches to your praxis.

DAOs are a new way to finance projects, govern communities, and share value. For every Creator, for anyone on the internet, it's now possible to collaborate, trust each other and join forces toward a joint project.\n\nEvery audience will turn into a community, and every fan will turn into a partner. With Social tokens and Creator DAOs, you'll have the power to incentivize anyone to help you achieve broader goals, meet new people and collaborate with others. DAOs, compared to traditional companies, are open, global, and transparent.\n\nEvery DAO is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all to create a successful Creator DAO. There are, however, good practices that have shown their efficiency in the past. This essay aims to give you some basic insights into how to launch a Creator DAO.\n\n## STEP 1 - Create a small group and gather strong engagement around a common goal.\n\nTo build a Creator DAO, the first thing you'll have to do is gather a small group toward a joint project. T**he goal at this stage is to gather a small community (\\~20 members) that genuinely believes in the project, and that is ready to help accomplish this vision without monetary rewards.** You can start by inviting your friends interested in the same niche that you are, post on forums, share your vision on socials or talk directly to your community if you already have one from previous projects.\n\n**The best way to attract top talent is to create a DAO with a strong culture, efficient onboarding, and well-designed incentives.** With a strong culture, you'll attract high-quality talents that will be intrinsically motivated to provide support over a sustained period.\n\n**The easiest way to onboard your first community members is to create a Telegram or a Geneva group.** Discord and Slack are also reasonable solutions but are more useful at a later stage when you need to create different channels around different subjects. Think thoroughly about all the onboarding steps to make sure anyone wanting to contribute can do it easily. Be proactive in onboarding community members and split the onboarding responsibilities with other key members of the DAO.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about gathering a solid community toward a joint project, you can [read this article ](https://www.notion.so/Setting-up-Treasury-Management-Governance-02cd796ad05b49cc856697a68da73bcf)sharing the best resources about the subject.\n\n## STEP 2 - Design Tokenomics\n\n*Once you have gathered a small and tight community around a shared vision, the next step is to design the Tokenomics of your project.*\n\nWe call Tokenomics all the things that enable participants to earn more tokens by contributing positively. Basically, setting up Tokenomics for your project means \"What can we put in place to incentivize my community to participate in my project.\"\n\n**To incentivize your community, there are several aspects you should dig into:**\n\n* **Token Distribution - How do you plan to reward contributors?** How much of the supply will be reserved for the DAO treasury? Do you want to do a retroactive airdrop (reward contributor for their past contributions) or everyone's winning Token from a starting point? The challenge with Token Distribution is to create efficient distribution mechanisms that would put the tokens in the hands of people willing to produce work for the network.\n* **Token design - How do you design the financial aspects of your Token?** What will be the total initial supply? Should you mint your Token on a [Fixed supply or on a Bonding curve](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)? If it's on a Bonding Curve, do you want your supply to be capped or uncapped? With Token design, you have to think about the technical and financial aspect of your Token to make sure it reflect what you want to achieve with your DAO.\n* **Price Stability - How do you manage the stability of your Token, so people are still motivated to collaborate?** What will be the anchor exchange rate with Ethereum (1ETH = 10?100?1000? of your Token)? Do you want to create an inflationary or deflationary token (monetary policy)? With which tokens do you want to bond your token (Collateral volatile or stable coin)? Price stability is an important aspect to consider as with a higher price comes speculators and with lower price comes more difficulty to incentivize community members.\n* **Governance - How do you assure fair governance and ensure the funds are distributed to the right projectS?** What rights do you give to token holders? What will be the Internal economics of your project? Governance is key to create a truly decentralized Organization.\n\nAll of the above elements will play a major role in how people collaborate in your DAO. Take the time to reflect thoroughly on the Tokenomics of your project, as it can make it skyrocket or plummet.\n\n## STEP 3 - Create a personal / community Token.\n\n*Once you’ve gathered a small knit community and have figured out the Tokenomics of your Token, the logical next step is to create a Token.*\n\nThe Token will primarily serve as social recognition as the Token doesn't have financial value at this point but will still be very effective to incentivize potential contributors. With the previous step, you should now have the answers to all the Tokenomics of your Token. The process of actually creating a token is fairly easy and pretty straightforward on Coinvise.\n\n**Here a several tutorials to help you go through these steps:**\n\n* [Create a Crypto Wallet](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Sign up on Coinvise](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Buy your first ETH](https://www.notion.so/How-to-buy-your-first-ETH-86873d84278c4495a752a6930f969f8d)\n* [Create a Personal / community Token](https://www.notion.so/How-to-mint-a-Personal-Community-Token-424196cb6f204f38b94faed3e0db301f)\n\n## STEP 4 - Design great bounties and grow your community\n\n*With a Token and early traction, the next step is to incentivize community members to be active and do tasks to help grow the project.*\n\nSocial tokens have shown their efficiency to incentivize individuals to share their skills with others. Well-designed incentives are more than crucial as they can make your project tremendously grow. They are best used when they scale or incentivize coordination and engagement between community members. Incentives are ideal when it's mutually beneficial to you and your community. This will create positive-sum games, where everyone has an aligned economic interest.\n\n**There are three main types of incentives:**\n\n* **Social incentives -** It's more of a social, collectible value that people are proud to own. Social Tokens create status within a community. Think of Airline miles that generate status within a specific sphere (Airline lounge, first to enter the plane, etc..) or special perks in Discord servers\n* **Vision Incentives -** Members aren't participating \"for-profit\" (aka economic incentives) but are driven by a specific ideology. Community members will exchange your Token without a monetary value because they sincerely believed in the vision.\n* **Economic Incentives -** It doesn't require a particular strategy, and you can simply ask community members to achieve a mission in exchange for economic value. By creating a “pay-for-performance incentive scheme” (a program where you pay contributors depending on how hard they work), you allow anyone to participate and help grow the project.\n\n**A Framework to design great incentives:**\n\n* **Step 1: Determine what would drive each party to use your Token -** The first step to do so is to clearly define what members of your community are chasing by joining your community. What are their inner motivations? What would they earn by participating in the community? Why have they decided to join? You have to deeply understand their interest in collaborating with the community before creating incentives.\n* **Step 2: Determine how you can align each parties' interest -** Now that you know what you need and what other community members want, your goal is to align those interests and design targeted rewards schemes. it's all about considering the trade-offs, which balance costs and benefits. (EX: Grades at school)\n* **Step 3: Prevent bad token behaviors by disincentivizing those -** Some bad behaviors could be speculative investments, for example, where community members would buy your Token (try to raise its value) without having a positive impact on the project. One way to beat this is to provide “lock-up periods” for token-holders. Basically, you lock their token for a certain period and contributors can’t withdraw them to their wallet. Another to disincentivize bad behaviors is t reward token holders for holding your Token for a long period of time. Instead of locking their tokens, you simply tell them they’ll receive a bonus for holding the token (every 3 or 6 months for example). Great onboarding is also key to prevent those bad behaviors.\n* **Step 4: Incorporating effective performance metrics and optimizing the size of rewards -** The goal of defining clear performance metrics is to measure participants' contributions to reward them relative to their efforts.\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful incentives programs from existing projects:**\n\n* [Forefront](https://forefront.market/) - [Forefront's bounties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dt5KxK5QmOyPAHBfj81nmY-btyTd0mbPlqJByOmkSR4/edit#gid=196077105)\n* [GlobalCoinResearch](https://globalcoinresearch.com/) - [GCR’s Bounties](https://globalcoinresearch.com/2021/04/14/gcr-media-mining/)\n\nYou can [Create Bounties](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Token-Reward-Bounty-on-Coinvise-abfc94a17ebc44c6a6f4affeec779113) (incentives) on Coinvise and [integrate the Coinvise Bot on Discord](https://www.notion.so/How-to-integrate-Discord-Tipping-NFT-Bot-ce49b396acbd48309db170eae362aca1) to automate sending out the rewards.\n\n## STEP 5 - Crowdfund your project\n\n*With a growing community, some traction, a Token, and the initial contributors that have achieved the first milestones, it's now time to open the community to a broader audience and crowdfund your project to achieve bigger goals.*\n\n**There are two main ways to crowdfund a project: through Social Tokens and NFTs.**\n\n* **Through Social Token -** A creator can crowdfund money by creating a Liquidity Pool, which means letting anyone buy its token. However, the Creator will need an already strong community (otherwise no one will buy its Token), and he will lose control over its Token (as anyone can buy token, anyone can buy a large amount of Token and vote for bad decision over the future of the project.\n* **Through NFTs -** A creator can mint an NFT or a collection of NFT and its fans can then buy it. NFT can give access to gated channels for example.\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects :**\n\n* [Ethereum: The Infinite Garden](https://twitter.com/EthereumFilm) - $INFINITE\n* [Burn Alpha Novel](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) - $NOVEL\n* [Alex Masmej](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej) - $ALEX\n* [Elektra by Songcamp](https://elektra.camp/#/) - $ELEKTRA\n* [Creator Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) - $CABIN\n\nIf you're interested in knowing more about crowdfunding, you should [read this essay](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/crowdfunding-projects-through-social) that gives more insight into Web3 crowdfunding.\n\n## STEP 6 - Setting up Treasury Management & Governance\n\n*With some money in the bank from your successful crowdfunding, you'll now have to manage the Treasury and let token holders choose for the community's future.*\n\nThe purpose of any decentralized community is to capitalize on itself in such a way as to ensure its ongoing operations can continue and invest in the future growth and success of the community and projects. **Right after the crowdfunding, as a community leader, you'll have three primary missions: Distribute ownership to community members, manage the Treasury of your community and create governance mechanisms.**\n\nHere are few actions you should take during this period to achieve your missions:\n\n* **Diversify your tokens -** The diversification of your tokens is an important area to focus on. A priority for many communities' treasuries is to convert a portion of their assets into Stablecoins. With the entirety of your Treasury held in your native Token, if the price of your token falls, let's say by 40%, your balance sheet will also shrink by 40%.\n* **Create a Multisig Wallet with Gnosis.** A multi-signature wallet allows you to define an access/control scheme through multiple users that need to confirm transactions before executing them. It secures your Treasury in the hand of multiple contributors and decentralizes your community a bit more.\n* **Create Guilds/Working groups -** Creating a Multisig is not the only way to distribute ownership. Another good practice is to develop Guilds or working groups in charge of specific missions within your community. By creating these working groups, you'll be able to allocate funds to specifics teams and organize your community more thoughtfully.\n* **Manage your Treasury -** You can use [Llama](https://llama.community/), an easy tool that helps DeFi protocols, DAOs, and Social Token communities manage their treasuries, as you'll have to make payments, financial reporting, and asset allocation. You'll also have to define how the supply allocated to the Treasury would be used for. Do you want to reward members for ongoing work and activities? Provide liquidity for the secondary token market if needed (e.g. via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/))? Potentially conduct a second crowdfund?\n* **Give voting power to your community** - The easiest way to give voting power to your community is to set up a [Snapshot](http://snapshot.org/) for governance mechanisms. Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results. Anyone can submit a proposal on Snapshot, and Token holders can then vote for or against the proposal, depending on if they judge it will benefit the project. The more token you hold, the more voting power you have.\n* **Setup tools for your Discord Server -** You can use tools such as [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) or [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/) that helps you determine how much value a contribution or contributor added to a project overall and reward them easily. With Collab.Land, it’s also possible to tip your contributor and create token-gated channels according to roles and how much token someone has. You can also set up the Coinvise Bot, which allows you to automatize the process of tipping.\n* **Generate multiple income streams -** Treasury management is an essential tool for aligning and incentivizing stakeholders to work for DAOs. Competition for talented contributions is fierce, so it's vital to ensure communities are well-capitalized regardless of market conditions. DAOs & communities ought to generate multiple income streams that can cover operating expenses and make sure to attract the best talents. An option for generating multiple income streams is yield farming. This is when you lend out a cryptocurrency and earn interest in it. It serves as an investment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLaunching a Creator DAO is one small step toward building a whole new economy where every individual can thrive. Making a Creator DAO isn't just making a token, it’s thinking about the different aspects of it, thinking about the Tokenomics and the incentives you’ll create.\n\nWe're still at the beginning of Creator DAOs, and there is still so much to discover and build. The entire crypto community is experimenting with new ways to improve Creator DAOs, and the space is rapidly evolving.\n\nHowever, with this guide, you should now be more aware of launching your Creator DAO and using crypto mechanisms to achieve your high ambition goals.\n\n\n---\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234)\n\n\n---\n\n**Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  [Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en)and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/8jaQB5CZ) 🔥**\n\n\n---\n\n**Further Resources on Tokenomics:**\n\n* [Designing Internet-Native Economies: A Guide to Crypto Tokens](https://future.a16z.com/a-taxonomy-of-tokens-distinctions-with-a-difference/)\n* [Great example of how CabinDAO chose their Tech Stack](https://creators.mirror.xyz/862A5rBtKX3BC8eEircDnGwPIJJTJ33hn-MvnukByPc)\n* [Social Token as Financial Assets (Blue Version)](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)\n* [Token Supply 101: Fundamentals of token supply — and monetary policy](https://adrienbe.medium.com/token-supply-101-fundamentals-of-token-supply-and-monetary-policy-a20cc761f6ec)\n* [FLOW Token Economics](https://www.onflow.org/flow-token-economics)\n\n**Further Resources on Treasury:**\n\n* [How DAOs should approach treasury management](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-daos-should-approach-treasury)\n* [How to Structure a Protocol’s Treasury](https://shreyashariharan.com/2021/03/14/how-to-structure-a-protocols-treasury/)", "timestamp": 1630365699, "digest": "0f9g1E0Lx0uirTo61UuahYDHb3v3O-qz9Y9hBGpnYJM", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

{"id": "fnSfdbGGJJ0GL8giJDmCp74kBqD6Iafq2DqA5AFGgY0", "title": "thoughts from my first year in crypto and on joining mirror", "body": "It's been almost one year since I really entered crypto, which I count as the day I first subscribed to @bankless. It's been quite a fun journey, and I'd love to share the path I took and some of the lessons learned.\n\n![First Bankless Receipt](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/faf4ac13-404e-4e31-bb87-7c76d3470569.png?height=200&width=567)\n\n## Life Before Crypto:\n\nBefore I entered crypto, I worked at a large investment bank in their rotational grad program. Over two years, I worked with different teams on everything from managing the bank's liquidity to our commercial real estate portfolio.\n\nWhen I started there in the Summer of 2019, I saw there was a lot of unstructured data both public and internal that could be leveraged with the right tools. I quickly decided I needed to upskill from just Excel, and immediately began learning Python to do some time series forecasting for [liquidity risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidityrisk.asp). I would read every day about [autoregressive and moving average models](https://machinelearningmastery.com/arima-for-time-series-forecasting-with-python/), try to implement them for some basic dataset, and then do a presentation to my few coworkers to get their feedback. That feedback would lead to lessons learned on how I could better apply and communicate my findings, but also would usually end with \"here's this other person who you can learn from about this\". This would create multiple avenues of learning to then go down again, repeating the process. I eventually called this a `learn-build-teach` cycle, and it helped me stay motivated and keep momentum.\n\n![\"present\" was probably more accurate than \"teach\" in the early days](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/be19ff03-d6e8-4a3b-9ead-4da757578bf2.png?height=569&width=1756)\n\nAfter a while, I realized that I did most of my learning through reading other peoples' presentations on what they had already built (mostly on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/)). Around May of 2020, I wanted to try and give back to the data science community and write about the skills and projects I'd developed over time. This was a great way to learn in the open where I would get comments or messages giving me feedback, and also led to many new connections on LinkedIn who were farther out from my usual network.\n\nI was heavily reliant on developer communities when learning various Python packages, and could clearly tell the difference between a product that was loved by its community versus one that didn't really connect as well with newer developers. Seeing the stark differences, I decided to go deep down the community software-as-a-service rabbit hole to find out what tools were being built to help dev tool product teams with building their communities. This research led me to conversations with builders like John Yen (Yeniverse), and Patrick Woods (orbit.love). They inspired me to try and improve the developer onboarding experience for dev tooling communities.\n\nThis started with building an NLP analysis product that could help with three things:\n\n1. identify the most commonly asked questions to enhance or auto-generate an FAQ page.\n2. match questions and answers to create an auto-response discord bot. The idea here was just to try and save the team time.\n3. identity the questions developers ask over time in the discord to map out when users try and develop with different features. This could help with user research and also product road mapping.\n\nWhile that endeavor of mine didn't get too far, this had planted a seed in me to continue observing and thinking about community building. Fall of 2020 came along, and I began to tap into one of the most well-connected and vibrant communities out there: Ethereum. Right away I could see that everything was open, from the data to the code to the people. This was a large departure from traditional finance, *where it often takes months just to get a conversation or data partnership going within the same bank*.\n\n## How I Got Started:\n\nIt took many many tries over the years to start \"getting into\" Ethereum. In July of 2020 I took a more serious stab at it; I tried reading and re-reading the Ethereum and Uniswap whitepapers, digesting my transactions on Etherscan, and listening to various podcast interviews. Bankless helped me understand the people and ideas to follow, but things didn't fully click until I started learning Solidity. Some helpful soul linked me to a tweet from Linda Xie mentioning an Ethereum developer onboarding session happening over the weekend, and that one-hour session led by Linda, Trent, and Austin probably contributed a lot to me changing my career path.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCk9-KG9cJA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCk9-KG9cJA)\n\nI barely knew what \"full-stack development\" meant, since most of my experience up to then was purely analytics of financial statements (writing scripts that didn't even remotely resemble building an app). But in that short session, we were all walked through the smart contract dapp development process and tools, and then given a clear guide to start with. The exact path I took during that September to November period looked like this:\n\n1. Watch all of [eth.build](http://eth.build) to understand wallets, transactions, and proof of work/authority consensus mechanisms in an interactive way\n2. Go through all six lessons of [Cryptozombies.io](http://cryptozombies.io) (the web3.js chapter may be a bit dated, so skipping it and learning to use ethers.js could be better instead)\n3. Go through [Austin's Bowtie Friday videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAc2FtC0_s) to learn scaffold-eth basics.\n4. Go through all of [solidity-by-example](https://solidity-by-example.org/) to understand common use cases like transferring ETH and working with ERC20 and ERC721 tokens. This is also a good intro to some common security risks in smart contracts such as reentrancy.\n5. Participate in ETHOnline 2020 Hackathon (by the way [ETHOnline 2021 is kicking off soon](https://ethglobal.online/)), [creating a full-stack dapp in under 30 days](https://github.com/LucidityDev/DFTP-core) while also [pitching the final product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaDzifphaLc) to a panel of judges.\n   1. I asked tons of questions in the hardhat discord to help me learn test suites and ethers.js concepts (thank you bunches @alcuadrado and @fvictorio)\n   2. the hackathon sponsor list is helpful for both using bounties to define the project and also to motivate studying the various products and tooling available (I remember [setting up this page](https://www.notion.so/7904bf1ccd294aa286f3fec7fb0cfde4) at the start)\n   3. after [winning the Gnosis prize](https://twitter.com/gnosisPM/status/1322240602369597443), my partner Diego and I ended up [taking this to a UNICEF MVP](https://app.gitbook.com/@ath310/s/lucidity/) over the following months.\n   4. I wrote about my [first Ethereum hackathon experience](https://medium.com/coinmonks/six-lessons-learned-as-a-prize-winner-from-the-ethonline-2020-hackathon-4c291ed49738) to cap it all off\n\nAfter this experience, I was convinced that crypto was indeed the future and I needed to go much deeper into the ecosystem. This was very exhausting though, with about 6-7 hours of learning and coding every day after work during that period.\n\n*As a side note, if I was to go back in time I would have started by looking at Dune dashboards before diving into solidity development since I think looking at data from events and function calls is a much easier starting point for learning Ethereum than reading contracts on Etherscan or trying to understand the protocol level elements right away.*\n\n## The Compounding Power of Learning and Contribution\n\nI continued with on-off momentum through the rest of November and December, until I joined Kernel Block 2 in January. @KERNEL0x has an element of referrals/applications - but getting noticed happens largely through contributing publicly. @sm_judge reached out to me because I'd started participating more in hackathons with @ethglobal:\n\n![On LinkedIn, since that's where I networked for traditional finance](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/18cb8e41-cc4e-40bc-a11a-5cefd3113603.png?height=529&width=453)\n\nShortly after KB2 started, [Sishir](https://twitter.com/__sishir) found me in the KB2 slack channel and asked if I wanted to join the [Spectral team](https://spectral.finance/) to do solidity research and architecture - on-chain credit scoring sounded pretty interesting and close to my finance knowledge domain, so I joined them part-time. Around the same time, I took up a business analyst role at Consensys both to learn product management and to see how enterprises really thought about blockchain. By early March I was fairly comfortable with the basics of Ethereum/Solidity and was getting more familiar with the teams of many larger projects in the space.\n\nThis career shift from an investment bank to crypto/tech kicked off a three-month full ecosystem mapping period, which was formative for helping me figure out what problems there were to solve and which communities I vibed with the most.\n\nThere were three main reasons I needed to spend the time doing this:\n\n1. *It isn't clear how things got to where they are today.*   For example, what are the different parts of the crypto wallet, and which were built first and why? How did certain communities form around or leave behind different problems?\n2. *It isn't clear where things are going in the short or medium term.*  There are so many different solutions proposed and attempted every day that it's hard for a generalist to understand things at a glance. This was especially true for me when I was studying interchain bridges.\n3. *I had no idea what I wanted to do within crypto, but I knew it likely wasn't going to be in defi.*  Spectral was much closer to the identity side of defi, which is what had initially piqued my interest.\n\nThe big idea I kept hearing about since day one was \"composability\", so I decided to dive in and see just how composable every part of the Ethereum ecosystem was. I think things were already loosely clear to me, but researching and writing it out helped me really understand [which elements of the product stack were composable](https://medium.com/coinmonks/crypto-and-web-3-0-are-the-future-of-product-and-work-3d19e3733181), how [open communities means fractals form elegantly around problem spaces](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-network-and-make-friends-in-crypto-796e123e9584), and the incredible importance of infrastructure composability when it comes to both [wallets](https://medium.com/coinmonks/1the-importance-of-composable-wallets-for-users-and-developers-accb2aadff49) and [interchain bridges](https://ath.mirror.xyz/Y2XBh3HRu5B0S3qw974txvIv0JDz7Tu-yIKVTes7DUU). All this exploration culminated in my research on the [composability of identity](https://ath.mirror.xyz/mDu_nGsWpjvF-KaPLADwxeAMfze3UJOtTAQi2CwPwWc), where I connected my thinking across all of the previous dimensions.\n\nAlong the way, I had many helpful conversations across a dozen communities and leaders, who gave me insight into how they thought about problems (or how they didn't). As I watched these communities grow, I started to notice a strong trend with their hires. Oftentimes, these new hires were already strong contributors within the community. This went against my notion that you should build up your resume first and then apply to a company/job. This is a very important frame of mind that anyone trying to break into crypto needs to quickly build up:  **contribute, don't apply.**\n\nOne good example is @artblocks, which has one of the strongest and most vibrant communities in crypto. Their hires of @ponyo and @druid are perfect examples of contributors who were always present.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/557f2d9f-7332-44f9-a7cd-f8d13f784aa7.png?height=428&width=1272)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f5e907f4-f1df-455b-af79-7ab1774db0e5.png?height=294&width=1333)\n\nAnother obvious shill for me is @DuneAnalytics. Becoming a @DuneAnalytics wizard 🧙🏼‍♂️ requires consistently showing up in the discord, making helpful dashboards or queries, and otherwise contributing to the community in a meaningful way. Over time, you'll be exposed to many bounty opportunities, get reached to by other companies looking for data/crypto experts, and maybe get tapped for hire by the Dune team. You can tell that the community and team are closely aligned and working together, purely based on the fact that outsiders have trouble separating the two:\n\n[https://twitter.com/drakedanner/status/1415327134143426567](https://twitter.com/drakedanner/status/1415327134143426567)\n\n[My recent collaboration](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297/status/1420775190724755460) and constant engagement with the Mirror community led directly to my eventual hire. It all started with a single tweet analyzing the $WRITE race.\n\n[https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297/status/1415055142928490500](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297/status/1415055142928490500)\n\nI want to stress that contributing can be literally anything: engineering product 🏗️, data analytics 📊, shipping memes 🍍, coordinating the masses ☎️, etc. Don't overcomplicate the task, but do take the time to find the missing links within or between communities 🔗.  Once this contribution lightbulb clicks, you'll start to see opportunities everywhere and the whole crypto space will start to open up to you. From finding your way into a community to eventually joining the team, it's all about finding a way to contribute. Contributions may sound a little too transactional, so I like to think about it as community building.\n\n## Community, Community, Community\n\nEarlier I called `learn-build-teach` a cycle, but it looks more like a branching tree because the work is spread over a wide breadth of topics and audiences (most of whom you never really interact with repeatedly). However, once you understand the connection between contribution and community you can build a learning flywheel that brings you closer to the community and its mission. In a great [0xSTATION article](https://station.mirror.xyz/xlPSC6PYsazGxjo-pqyaV8M4ujtWapxhCmVQfBjmN9o), this product flywheel came up in relation to a person's lifecycle in a community:\n\n![https://station.mirror.xyz/xlPSC6PYsazGxjo-pqyaV8M4ujtWapxhCmVQfBjmN9o](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/097b5e6e-6b27-4036-a136-6c885ab4113d.png?height=651&width=713)\n\nThe new community-contribution driven flywheel I leverage is a linear and actionable version of the `contribution <> consumption` portion in the flow above:\n\n![Thanks to Emily for helping me put this together](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2689ef8d-f3f1-4d0e-9e5d-4c5bd6c26379.png?height=3000&width=4000)\n\nOne example of this cycle is the story *behind* how I became a Dune Wizard. When I first started learning about Dune and hopping around the Discord in April, I noticed that most people were struggling with learning SQL, Ethereum, or both. Pointing to guides that taught only one of the two domains led to a large learning friction. So, I decided to learn Dune with some simple example queries, and then use those to write articles on how to learn SQL and Ethereum at the same time on Dune. I started with [a beginner](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-guide-to-basic-sql-while-learning-ethereum-at-the-same-time-9eac17a05929) and then [an advanced](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-guide-to-intermediate-sql-while-learning-ethereum-at-the-same-time-7b25119ef1e2) guide, which together has now garnered over 20k views on Medium (expert guide coming later this year). I've continued using and improving this teaching-as-contribution methodology over the last few months, doing deep dives with my friend 0xkowloon on interesting new protocols like [barnbridge](https://towardsdatascience.com/learning-sql-and-ethereum-part-3-5422f080ad36) and [fractional_art](https://medium.com/coinmonks/dissecting-the-fractional-protocol-dc3867584bdb).\n\n**The larger point here I want to make about contributions is that what you create doesn't have to be crazy innovative or even tackle the core product/problem of a community.**  Building an intrapreneur skillset and perspective will serve you much better 90% of the time instead of focusing on an entrepreneurial approach when trying to contribute to a community for the first time. Since in crypto we see innovations every day, I think this creates a pressure that makes it hard for most people (me included) to balance the two ways of thinking. If this feels abstract, then think about it as building something for the ease of use or building of a product rather than just extending the use of the product itself. Intrapreneurs are usually born from environments where there are lots of silos and collective improvements that can be made. This is typically found at a large enterprise company, where a lot of your efforts are around making collaboration and knowledge sharing more accessible by creating a mix of solutions such as clearer standards, working groups, or dashboards/applications. Open communities in Ethereum make intrapreneurship a lot easier to learn as there is usually less bureaucracy around budgets and more political will to chase and implement changes, even though the communities are large in size.\n\n## Looking Forward and Joining Mirror\n\nJoining Mirror means that for the first time in my professional life, I'll be devoting all my efforts to one thing instead of multitasking many projects at once. It's a big decision for me, one that's driven by my interest to understand exactly what community building looks like over time and how the process can be made more fluid or fun.\n\nI've thought for almost a year now about the kinds of issues communities face while growing, starting from developer communities and now more recently on DAOs. Over time, my goal has become more refined: I want to build tools that enable and incentivize contributions within a community, and also make it easier to see the full context of and leverage a community's social graph. These are key elements to strong community building, and I believe will be core to Mirror's mission. Having the opportunity to build up a strong community around this tooling is a huge motivator for my move as well.\n\nThose are some pretty dense sentences, so let me break down my decision to join Mirror further:\n\n* **The Product:**\n  * So far I've only worked on/with various defi protocols, and seeing/using the creator block contracts produced by the team (such as edition crowdfund and splits) felt like such a breath of fresh air. I'm excited to see further iterations leverage what has been built in defi already.\n  * There's a lot of creative space in NFTs and transactions that build connections to people instead of pools. This includes variations on the NFTs themselves, auction mechanisms, ownership structures, and much more.\n* **The Team:**\n  * I've spoken with Patrick, Graeme, Jon-Kyle, and Denis over the past few months, and I found myself constantly inspired by our conversations. They have a lot more experience than me in building and thinking about products (especially in consumer), so I greatly look forward to learning more from them and the rest of the team.\n  * The team has a rare balance I haven't seen that often, which is a willingness to think big but the ability to still execute quickly. I experienced this firsthand while working with them on the $WRITE token airdrop.\n* **The Community:**\n  * Sybil resistance methods can be useful for a lot more than just unique identities, and I think the $WRITE race is a perfect example of this. When what you're signaling is much more than just \"I think this is a real person,\" the implications on the strength of a community are tenfold. I still remember those who gave me even just one vote in the race, and I'm sure others feel the same. It's also probably one of the only \"governance\" functions that have an active voting participation of greater than 30% (without using delegation).\n  * While right now I think the community is already very strong on Twitter and Discord, I'm very excited by how the physical world will eventually play a role in this too. I'd imagine one day we'd have a coworking space, and be able to work together with DAOs and creators who want to sit in for a day or two. I see Mirror as being a natural fit for this, given the product and community ethos.\n* **The Data:**\n  * It goes without saying that the possibilities within the data played a huge factor in my decision. First and foremost that lies in the potential applications of [graph data science](https://ath.mirror.xyz/aYOJc8pihb9wxI___QR9qmM5mQ4caUyQhHJIlevspjw), essentially analyzing our interaction networks on various levels for insights that further collaboration and contribution. The fact that the data could easily drive new products or economic distributions is extremely exciting to me.\n  * [Crypto-native UX research](https://ath.mirror.xyz/l_-4fQ08cpxUZpn9V9S5R27wfKvNgdnrXlZAWZWvdlg) is also a fairly unexplored field, I think there are some very creative data and user group applications we can make here. For one, user behaviors can be put together from across various platforms (instead of just studying behaviors on my platform like you would in Web2). I can understand auction behaviors using Artblocks, Mirror, and Opensea data to get even stronger user personas to drive product development. I do hope to collaborate with other teams across crypto to collectively improve the UX of Web3.\n  * Lastly, the creative space within [data-driven design of tokenomics](https://ath.mirror.xyz/CdU80CItQr-qTZgTzymfFDEBSnz2YbgnwXGYgkQJfCs) (with a focus on continual distributions) cannot be understated. Closely studying the repeated game theory and micro-economies that will come from Mirror should lead to some innovative token mechanisms and tools. I'm keen to explore how protocol token distributions can inform different approaches for creator/DAO tokens on the platform (and vice versa).\n\nNow I want to emphasize that there is no single path through crypto, but I hope that sharing my experiences and how my thinking/methods of navigating the space led me to my dream job will be helpful to someone out there. I want to give a huge thank you to everyone who has supported me and come along on this journey thus far!\n\n*Thank you to [Elena](https://twitter.com/VirtualElena) for proofreading and providing very helpful comments* 🙂", "timestamp": 1630373857, "digest": "NyefDE67rJEvcM9tAJkf3zHptN7vuaO1MJlpSaSc7O0", "contributor": "0x2Ae8c972fB2E6c00ddED8986E2dc672ED190DA06"}

DAOs are a new way to finance projects, govern communities, and share value. For every Creator, for anyone on the internet, it's now possible to collaborate, trust each other and join forces toward a joint project.\n\nEvery audience will turn into a community, and every fan will turn into a partner. With Social tokens and Creator DAOs, you'll have the power to incentivize anyone to help you achieve broader goals, meet new people and collaborate with others. DAOs, compared to traditional companies, are open, global, and transparent.\n\nEvery DAO is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all to create a successful Creator DAO. There are, however, good practices that have shown their efficiency in the past. This essay aims to give you some basic insights into how to launch a Creator DAO.\n\n## STEP 1 - Create a small group and gather strong engagement around a common goal.\n\nTo build a Creator DAO, the first thing you'll have to do is gather a small group toward a joint project. T**he goal at this stage is to gather a small community (\\~20 members) that genuinely believes in the project, and that is ready to help accomplish this vision without monetary rewards.** You can start by inviting your friends interested in the same niche that you are, post on forums, share your vision on socials or talk directly to your community if you already have one from previous projects.\n\n**The best way to attract top talent is to create a DAO with a strong culture, efficient onboarding, and well-designed incentives.** With a strong culture, you'll attract high-quality talents that will be intrinsically motivated to provide support over a sustained period.\n\n**The easiest way to onboard your first community members is to create a Telegram or a Geneva group.** Discord and Slack are also reasonable solutions but are more useful at a later stage when you need to create different channels around different subjects. Think thoroughly about all the onboarding steps to make sure anyone wanting to contribute can do it easily. Be proactive in onboarding community members and split the onboarding responsibilities with other key members of the DAO.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about gathering a solid community toward a joint project, you can [read this article ](https://www.notion.so/Setting-up-Treasury-Management-Governance-02cd796ad05b49cc856697a68da73bcf)sharing the best resources about the subject.\n\n## STEP 2 - Design Tokenomics\n\n*Once you have gathered a small and tight community around a shared vision, the next step is to design the Tokenomics of your project.*\n\nWe call Tokenomics all the things that enable participants to earn more tokens by contributing positively. Basically, setting up Tokenomics for your project means \"What can we put in place to incentivize my community to participate in my project.\"\n\n**To incentivize your community, there are several aspects you should dig into:**\n\n* **Token Distribution - How do you plan to reward contributors?** How much of the supply will be reserved for the DAO treasury? Do you want to do a retroactive airdrop (reward contributor for their past contributions) or everyone's winning Token from a starting point? The challenge with Token Distribution is to create efficient distribution mechanisms that would put the tokens in the hands of people willing to produce work for the network.\n* **Token design - How do you design the financial aspects of your Token?** What will be the total initial supply? Should you mint your Token on a [Fixed supply or on a Bonding curve](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)? If it's on a Bonding Curve, do you want your supply to be capped or uncapped? With Token design, you have to think about the technical and financial aspect of your Token to make sure it reflect what you want to achieve with your DAO.\n* **Price Stability - How do you manage the stability of your Token, so people are still motivated to collaborate?** What will be the anchor exchange rate with Ethereum (1ETH = 10?100?1000? of your Token)? Do you want to create an inflationary or deflationary token (monetary policy)? With which tokens do you want to bond your token (Collateral volatile or stable coin)? Price stability is an important aspect to consider as with a higher price comes speculators and with lower price comes more difficulty to incentivize community members.\n* **Governance - How do you assure fair governance and ensure the funds are distributed to the right projectS?** What rights do you give to token holders? What will be the Internal economics of your project? Governance is key to create a truly decentralized Organization.\n\nAll of the above elements will play a major role in how people collaborate in your DAO. Take the time to reflect thoroughly on the Tokenomics of your project, as it can make it skyrocket or plummet.\n\n## STEP 3 - Create a personal / community Token.\n\n*Once you’ve gathered a small knit community and have figured out the Tokenomics of your Token, the logical next step is to create a Token.*\n\nThe Token will primarily serve as social recognition as the Token doesn't have financial value at this point but will still be very effective to incentivize potential contributors. With the previous step, you should now have the answers to all the Tokenomics of your Token. The process of actually creating a token is fairly easy and pretty straightforward on Coinvise.\n\n**Here a several tutorials to help you go through these steps:**\n\n* [Create a Crypto Wallet](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Sign up on Coinvise](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-7dd6371acf874c9db184f78467abc2fd)\n* [Buy your first ETH](https://www.notion.so/How-to-buy-your-first-ETH-86873d84278c4495a752a6930f969f8d)\n* [Create a Personal / community Token](https://www.notion.so/How-to-mint-a-Personal-Community-Token-424196cb6f204f38b94faed3e0db301f)\n\n## STEP 4 - Design great bounties and grow your community\n\n*With a Token and early traction, the next step is to incentivize community members to be active and do tasks to help grow the project.*\n\nSocial tokens have shown their efficiency to incentivize individuals to share their skills with others. Well-designed incentives are more than crucial as they can make your project tremendously grow. They are best used when they scale or incentivize coordination and engagement between community members. Incentives are ideal when it's mutually beneficial to you and your community. This will create positive-sum games, where everyone has an aligned economic interest.\n\n**There are three main types of incentives:**\n\n* **Social incentives -** It's more of a social, collectible value that people are proud to own. Social Tokens create status within a community. Think of Airline miles that generate status within a specific sphere (Airline lounge, first to enter the plane, etc..) or special perks in Discord servers\n* **Vision Incentives -** Members aren't participating \"for-profit\" (aka economic incentives) but are driven by a specific ideology. Community members will exchange your Token without a monetary value because they sincerely believed in the vision.\n* **Economic Incentives -** It doesn't require a particular strategy, and you can simply ask community members to achieve a mission in exchange for economic value. By creating a “pay-for-performance incentive scheme” (a program where you pay contributors depending on how hard they work), you allow anyone to participate and help grow the project.\n\n**A Framework to design great incentives:**\n\n* **Step 1: Determine what would drive each party to use your Token -** The first step to do so is to clearly define what members of your community are chasing by joining your community. What are their inner motivations? What would they earn by participating in the community? Why have they decided to join? You have to deeply understand their interest in collaborating with the community before creating incentives.\n* **Step 2: Determine how you can align each parties' interest -** Now that you know what you need and what other community members want, your goal is to align those interests and design targeted rewards schemes. it's all about considering the trade-offs, which balance costs and benefits. (EX: Grades at school)\n* **Step 3: Prevent bad token behaviors by disincentivizing those -** Some bad behaviors could be speculative investments, for example, where community members would buy your Token (try to raise its value) without having a positive impact on the project. One way to beat this is to provide “lock-up periods” for token-holders. Basically, you lock their token for a certain period and contributors can’t withdraw them to their wallet. Another to disincentivize bad behaviors is t reward token holders for holding your Token for a long period of time. Instead of locking their tokens, you simply tell them they’ll receive a bonus for holding the token (every 3 or 6 months for example). Great onboarding is also key to prevent those bad behaviors.\n* **Step 4: Incorporating effective performance metrics and optimizing the size of rewards -** The goal of defining clear performance metrics is to measure participants' contributions to reward them relative to their efforts.\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful incentives programs from existing projects:**\n\n* [Forefront](https://forefront.market/) - [Forefront's bounties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dt5KxK5QmOyPAHBfj81nmY-btyTd0mbPlqJByOmkSR4/edit#gid=196077105)\n* [GlobalCoinResearch](https://globalcoinresearch.com/) - [GCR’s Bounties](https://globalcoinresearch.com/2021/04/14/gcr-media-mining/)\n\nYou can [Create Bounties](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Token-Reward-Bounty-on-Coinvise-abfc94a17ebc44c6a6f4affeec779113) (incentives) on Coinvise and [integrate the Coinvise Bot on Discord](https://www.notion.so/How-to-integrate-Discord-Tipping-NFT-Bot-ce49b396acbd48309db170eae362aca1) to automate sending out the rewards.\n\n## STEP 5 - Crowdfund your project\n\n*With a growing community, some traction, a Token, and the initial contributors that have achieved the first milestones, it's now time to open the community to a broader audience and crowdfund your project to achieve bigger goals.*\n\n**There are two main ways to crowdfund a project: through Social Tokens and NFTs.**\n\n* **Through Social Token -** A creator can crowdfund money by creating a Liquidity Pool, which means letting anyone buy its token. However, the Creator will need an already strong community (otherwise no one will buy its Token), and he will lose control over its Token (as anyone can buy token, anyone can buy a large amount of Token and vote for bad decision over the future of the project.\n* **Through NFTs -** A creator can mint an NFT or a collection of NFT and its fans can then buy it. NFT can give access to gated channels for example.\n\n**Here are a few examples of successful crowdfunding from existing projects :**\n\n* [Ethereum: The Infinite Garden](https://twitter.com/EthereumFilm) - $INFINITE\n* [Burn Alpha Novel](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) - $NOVEL\n* [Alex Masmej](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej) - $ALEX\n* [Elektra by Songcamp](https://elektra.camp/#/) - $ELEKTRA\n* [Creator Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) - $CABIN\n\nIf you're interested in knowing more about crowdfunding, you should [read this essay](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/crowdfunding-projects-through-social) that gives more insight into Web3 crowdfunding.\n\n## STEP 6 - Setting up Treasury Management & Governance\n\n*With some money in the bank from your successful crowdfunding, you'll now have to manage the Treasury and let token holders choose for the community's future.*\n\nThe purpose of any decentralized community is to capitalize on itself in such a way as to ensure its ongoing operations can continue and invest in the future growth and success of the community and projects. **Right after the crowdfunding, as a community leader, you'll have three primary missions: Distribute ownership to community members, manage the Treasury of your community and create governance mechanisms.**\n\nHere are few actions you should take during this period to achieve your missions:\n\n* **Diversify your tokens -** The diversification of your tokens is an important area to focus on. A priority for many communities' treasuries is to convert a portion of their assets into Stablecoins. With the entirety of your Treasury held in your native Token, if the price of your token falls, let's say by 40%, your balance sheet will also shrink by 40%.\n* **Create a Multisig Wallet with Gnosis.** A multi-signature wallet allows you to define an access/control scheme through multiple users that need to confirm transactions before executing them. It secures your Treasury in the hand of multiple contributors and decentralizes your community a bit more.\n* **Create Guilds/Working groups -** Creating a Multisig is not the only way to distribute ownership. Another good practice is to develop Guilds or working groups in charge of specific missions within your community. By creating these working groups, you'll be able to allocate funds to specifics teams and organize your community more thoughtfully.\n* **Manage your Treasury -** You can use [Llama](https://llama.community/), an easy tool that helps DeFi protocols, DAOs, and Social Token communities manage their treasuries, as you'll have to make payments, financial reporting, and asset allocation. You'll also have to define how the supply allocated to the Treasury would be used for. Do you want to reward members for ongoing work and activities? Provide liquidity for the secondary token market if needed (e.g. via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/))? Potentially conduct a second crowdfund?\n* **Give voting power to your community** - The easiest way to give voting power to your community is to set up a [Snapshot](http://snapshot.org/) for governance mechanisms. Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results. Anyone can submit a proposal on Snapshot, and Token holders can then vote for or against the proposal, depending on if they judge it will benefit the project. The more token you hold, the more voting power you have.\n* **Setup tools for your Discord Server -** You can use tools such as [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) or [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/) that helps you determine how much value a contribution or contributor added to a project overall and reward them easily. With Collab.Land, it’s also possible to tip your contributor and create token-gated channels according to roles and how much token someone has. You can also set up the Coinvise Bot, which allows you to automatize the process of tipping.\n* **Generate multiple income streams -** Treasury management is an essential tool for aligning and incentivizing stakeholders to work for DAOs. Competition for talented contributions is fierce, so it's vital to ensure communities are well-capitalized regardless of market conditions. DAOs & communities ought to generate multiple income streams that can cover operating expenses and make sure to attract the best talents. An option for generating multiple income streams is yield farming. This is when you lend out a cryptocurrency and earn interest in it. It serves as an investment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLaunching a Creator DAO is one small step toward building a whole new economy where every individual can thrive. Making a Creator DAO isn't just making a token, it’s thinking about the different aspects of it, thinking about the Tokenomics and the incentives you’ll create.\n\nWe're still at the beginning of Creator DAOs, and there is still so much to discover and build. The entire crypto community is experimenting with new ways to improve Creator DAOs, and the space is rapidly evolving.\n\n\n---\n\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=234)\n\n\n---\n\n**Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  [Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en)and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/8jaQB5CZ) 🔥**\n\n\n---\n\n**Further Resources on Tokenomics:**\n\n* [Designing Internet-Native Economies: A Guide to Crypto Tokens](https://future.a16z.com/a-taxonomy-of-tokens-distinctions-with-a-difference/)\n* [Great example of how CabinDAO chose their Tech Stack](https://creators.mirror.xyz/862A5rBtKX3BC8eEircDnGwPIJJTJ33hn-MvnukByPc)\n* [Social Token as Financial Assets (Blue Version)](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)\n* [Token Supply 101: Fundamentals of token supply — and monetary policy](https://adrienbe.medium.com/token-supply-101-fundamentals-of-token-supply-and-monetary-policy-a20cc761f6ec)\n* [FLOW Token Economics](https://www.onflow.org/flow-token-economics)\n\n**Further Resources on Treasury:**\n\n* [How DAOs should approach treasury management](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-daos-should-approach-treasury)\n* [How to Structure a Protocol’s Treasury](https://shreyashariharan.com/2021/03/14/how-to-structure-a-protocols-treasury/)", "timestamp": 1630374196, "digest": "0f9g1E0Lx0uirTo61UuahYDHb3v3O-qz9Y9hBGpnYJM", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

To learn more about Pathfinders and our role in the decentralization of RabbitHole, check out [last week’s newsletter.](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/2aWOCnFgLTRePfJn4C2P8RgmYh_I0VbPcColjQTtcJ8)***\n\nPathfinders are the guiding lights through the nebulous crypto rabbit hole. Every week, we meet to discuss the web3 frontier, where it is today, and where it’s going. **This week's musings: the Metaverse–what it is and where we are in it.**\n\n### What is the Metaverse and where are we in its evolution?\n\nFrom Zoom chats, to the Minecraft world, to our Twitter feeds, the Metaverse is taking shape all around us. However, as so eloquently described by venture capitalist and prolific essayist Matthew Ball, there is no finite beginning or end to this always-on digital space where people can congregate to socialize, work, learn, entertain, express themselves, and create. Instead, [as described by Ball](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse), the Metaverse is a “sort of successor state to the mobile internet” that will “slowly emerge over time as different products, services, and capabilities integrate and meld together.”\n\nSo, while the [12.3 million Fortnite players that tuned into Travis Scott’s virtual performance](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/travis-scott-fortnite-record-viewers-live-1234589033/) may have *felt* like they were experiencing the Metaverse, [using Ball’s framework](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/forwardtothemetaverseprimer), it’s clear that we’re decades away from the interconnected innovation needed to achieve an idealistic vision of this space—defined by characteristics like “infinite persistency, ubiquitous synchrony, unlimited concurrency, \\[and\\] wide interoperability,” [says Ball](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/forwardtothemetaverseprimer).\n\n### The battle between a “closed” versus “open” Metaverse\n\nWhile we may be many years away from the Metaverse, more specifically, an [“Open Metaverse”](https://crucible.network/open-metaverse/) where you’ll be able to move through different “places” with relative ease, maintaining your purchased goods and avatars, it’s important to recognize that [the Metaverse isn’t a destination, but a journey](https://outlierventures.io/research/the-open-metaverse-os/).\n\nThrough this lens, we can more aggressively challenge the decisions and design choices that are currently being made. For example, if Facebook wins with Oculus and other Facebook Reality Labs projects, we could find ourselves in a *[Ready Player One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One)* “Closed Metaverse” controlled by one or a handful of companies. Think the centralized, propriety, and extractive systems of web2 that value shareholder supremacy over user centricity, but on steroids.\n\n### An Internet inflection point\n\nHistory doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme, and to avoid the pitfalls of the transformation of web1 to web2 (i.e. techno-deterministic turned attention-sucking, data-collecting misinformation machinery), we must walk wide-eyed into the future.\n\nThe work we do now to hard-code web3 principles of user centricity, decentralization, and sovereignty could make the difference between an open and closed Metaverse.\n\nWe shouldn’t wait and watch for this mysterious Metaverse future to unfold. It's here, and it’s up to us to positively define and create it.\n\n*This exploration of the Metaverse, web3, and open systems was written by [@anay_sim](https://twitter.com/anay_sim).*\n\n### Pathfinder update: Introducing workstreams\n\nIn last week’s [post](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/2aWOCnFgLTRePfJn4C2P8RgmYh_I0VbPcColjQTtcJ8), we wrote about “*giving Pioneers a more open directive to explore web3,*” and now it’s our time to run with that directive.\n\nAs RabbitHole moves closer and closer towards a DAO, the Pathfinder cohort will begin to take on more responsibility. In our eyes, one of the most important first steps towards this progressive decentralization is to form working groups that allow Pathfinders to align and execute on goals within a defined scope.\n\nThat’s why we added two new working groups and met for the first time last week:\n\n1. Editorial Workstream: content production and publishing on Mirror and Twitter\n2. Treasury Workstream: treasury management and bounty budgeting\n\nIn the weeks and months to come, expect more content on Mirror, memes on Twitter, and maybe a few surprises from Pathfinders–this is just the beginning.\n\n### New pathfinder guides\n\nPioneers published five tutorials this week, producing crucial content for users exploring the Metaverse and the wider crypto landscape. Whether you’re questing on RabbitHole or just exploring crypto, Pathfinder guides help walk you through web3.\n\n* [How to Mint an NFT on OpenSea](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/JxnMhWII3AmZPEt7fiTSY19cXsLSVpfLpXkosngiiIc) ([Vajresh](https://twitter.com/bvajresh))\n* [How to Swap Tokens on QuickSwap](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/IlhYlBpI0oxMV8W4Vw1gORICVAAWZk1HXae0JPah6lA) ([Vajresh](https://twitter.com/bvajresh))\n* [How to Swap Tokens on 1inch](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/Az4z69YCC3EnbPdrzdX7qTedClA1bDMXjpDUvfQVt2Y) ([zachdavidson.eth](https://twitter.com/NotZachDavidson))\n* [How to Stake on Synthetix](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/iiSoIGvwUJKWfhz7DAleKkHxxEvMySD_6IGEzJgiVmU) ([Accelerated Capital](https://twitter.com/accel_capital))\n* [How to Vote on Snapshot](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/6_ktnT68o9LyIbgnJdFzaNijiZDS-JIujkyVsktfmPs) ([Accelerated Capital](https://twitter.com/accel_capital))\n\nIf you get value out of our guides, make sure to collect an edition of the NFT (that accompanies each one!).

I think it’s important I do this before I get much deeper and become ‘one of them’ (“one of us… one of us…”), so that I can provide my best layman’s take for the 99% of the planet that isn’t DAO-native.\n\nI decided I’d write about my three main learnings from my involvement with DAOs to date, but as usual with my writing, this got real long real quick – so I’m splitting it into three parts to really dig into each and discuss its implications.\n\nThe three things I’ve learned are:\n\n1. DAO is an ethos\n2. The transparency is wild\n3. You gotta hustle\n\nLet’s dig into #1.\n\n## Part 1: DAO is an ethos\n\nDAO, as you probably know if you’re reading this, stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization.\n\nThis piece assumes baseline knowledge on what DAOs are - so if the term is completely new to you, start with [@ljxie](https://twitter.com/ljxie)’s [‘A beginner’s guide to DAOs’](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o) & [@Pet3rpan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_)’s [‘What is a DAO?’](https://pet3rpan.medium.com/an-introduction-to-daos-782e3817e2cd).\n\nTo state the blatantly obvious, the acronym ‘DAO’ clearly conveys two things:\n\n1. DAOs are decentralized\n2. DAOs are autonomous\n\nBut most DAOs today are not totally decentralized, nor are they totally autonomous. This, in my opinion, is totally fine – but let’s call it like it is: *DAO is an ethos, not a specific construct.*\n\n### Decentralization & autonomy are nebulous\n\nTo start, how one defines the terms ‘decentralization’ and ‘autonomy’ in the context of an organization altogether is, well, mildly inconsistent depending who you ask, to put it politely.\n\nAs I wrote in [Decentralization is not Binary](https://annikalewis.medium.com/decentralization-is-not-binary-45bbb9946fad), there are many dimensions on which a project may or may not be decentralized – governance, org structure, tech, to name a few – and on each of those dimensions, the level of centralization is a spectrum. \n\n![Inspo: Will Murphy, Drawing: Me](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/003581ba-071f-4176-939a-6de84ca61f22.png?height=312&width=700)\n\nCertain people will fight to the death for one specific dimension, yet not care about others, but we still talk about decentralization as a catch-all, as a one-dimensional *thing*. I’ve yet to find a project that is 100% decentralized on all dimensions – and, frankly, I’m not sure it would be desirable.\n\nSo, I struggle with the term DAO because it *feels* more prescriptive/specific than it actually is. \n\nDAOs are often framed as the antithesis of traditional ‘centralized’ organizations. And yet, I’d make the case that traditional organizations themselves are typically not fully centralized – your typical pyramid org structure, for example, is a form of decentralization – so, to me, our shared terminology and our framing of these constructs as distinct opposites (and as binary outcomes: DAO vs. traditional organization) feels a little off.\n\n### Articulating the ethos\n\nMost importantly, to me, DAOs reflect a certain ethos. *A* *vibe*, if you will.\n\nThere is a shared culture, a shared set of cultural norms amongst DAOs, that holds true regardless of where exactly a specific DAO sits on the decentralization/autonomy spectrums. For this reason, after being in a few DAO Discords, jumping into a new one tends to feel familiar. \n\nThe ethos is, by and large, one of individuals collectivizing to create something bigger, together, absent of a highly prescribed and fixed structure. Of openness & collaboration. Of work that, well, *works* for people. \n\n[https://twitter.com/agorismlabs/status/1427009765075570696 ](https://twitter.com/agorismlabs/status/1427009765075570696 )\n\nI firmly believe DAOs offer the best peek you can get into how knowledge work will evolve over the coming decade. \n\nIf I’m right, and if DAOs are any indication, here’s a glimpse at that future based on what I see inside of them today:\n\n**On recruiting:**\n\n* Companies will need to open their doors to the general public to compete for talent (a lot more on this coming in Part 2)\n* Geographical location will cease to be a constraint\n* Employees will be able to ‘try-before-they-buy’ with prospective employers of theirs\n\n[https://twitter.com/chaserchapman/status/1429870422401691659 ](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman/status/1429870422401691659 )\n\n**On operating a company:**\n\n* Top-down governance will undergo a massive shift; employees will have a say in who the Board is (if there is a Board, at all)\n* Employees will have a much greater voice in company decision-making; identity-based voting mechanisms will play a formal role in governance\n* Broad-based & transparent equity ownership will be the norm, rather than a right reserved for senior employees\n* Employees will be evaluated not by just one direct manager, but by the organization at-large\n\n**On having a job:**\n\n* Fans of a specific project will be able to jump right in and not just consume, but contribute to the growth of that project – or multiple projects – themselves and share in the upside\n* Full-time, monogamous work at one company may well become the exception, not the rule\n\nIt’s the creator economy, for knowledge workers.\n\n[https://twitter.com/divine_economy/status/1423674134685388805 ](https://twitter.com/divine_economy/status/1423674134685388805 )\n\nAll of this is what it’s worth focusing on when it comes to the promise of DAOs. This ethos is still in its infancy, and the execution is happening on such a small relative scale today.\n\nAnd while I’m definitely excited by the tangible revenue traction and real dollars we’re seeing flow into areas like DeFi and NFTs, frankly it’s the early glimmers of what I’m seeing inside these collectives today that get me super jazzed about the future of people’s lives as it pertains crypto, as a whole. \n\nWhile there are many kinks to sort out and growing pains to be experienced, this first principles approach to re-thinking how groups self-organize and build together is likely to define the next era of work. \n\nCreators & employers, keep watch. 👀", "timestamp": 1630381596, "digest": "9yxmN8Sh3_i43zgFWxQjNVMaL3vqNHGJ_JERr_sgEmk", "contributor": "0x894Aa5F1E45454677A8560ddE3B45Cb5C427Ef92"}

Many of these projects, using this new Internet logic, will become the building blocks for a new economy. But social tokens today still have yet to adopt the latest mental model.

Let’s work backwards: if you want your community to be valuable, you need your community’s token to go up in price. This makes sense, sure. But to make the token go up in price, you have two choices: you can either **increase** the price of the token, or you can **decrease** the number of tokens available to prospective members.

Many of these projects, using this new Internet logic, will become the building blocks for a new economy. But social tokens today still have yet to adopt the latest mental model. If the goal of web3 is to overturn the Internet status quo, then the structure of social tokens today is fundamentally flawed from the ground up.

Let’s work backwards: if you want your community to be valuable, you need your community’s token to go up in price. This makes sense, sure. But to make the token go up in price, you have two choices: you can either **increase** the price of the token, or you can **decrease** the number of tokens available to prospective members. Either way, this restricts access to the community, promotes exclusivity, and generally takes us in the opposite direction of where we want web3 to go.\n\n[https://twitter.com/parisrouz/status/1432389714468802566?s=20](https://twitter.com/parisrouz/status/1432389714468802566?s=20)\n\nSo how do we solve the Social Token Paradox? As an ecosystem, we need to rethink the value of a token from the ground up. The decentralized communities of tomorrow will be centered around what we *do*, instead of what we *have*.

I believe you must take significant risk to earn significant returns.\n\nBut I also am a huge fan of diversification when holding a lot of risky assets. It has been easier for USV to get into new sectors, like crypto and climate for example, knowing that we also have large positions in other parts of the early stage tech sector.\n\nWhen crypto went crazy in 2017 and then blew up, it was mostly a blip in our portfolio values. The same was true in the second quarter of this year when crypto had a big pullback.\n\nThis is not an argument against crypto only funds. USV has invested in a number of them and so have the Gotham Gal and I. But I would not be comfortable with a portfolio that was only crypto funds. I like to have a mix of assets, ideally uncorrelated, in our portfolio.\n\nAn asset class that I really like as a hedge against early stage tech sector risk is real estate. The Gotham Gal and I own a lot of income producing real estate and it feels very uncorrelated to early stage tech.\n\nBut there are many ways to get diversification. If you don’t want to think about your investments, something I cannot bring myself to do, then a stock index fund or a portfolio of stock index funds, and some fixed income funds can get you the diversification you need. But the level of risk taking in that strategy is a lot lower.\n\nBut regardless of how you get there, it is very important that you not have all of your eggs in one basket. That basket can drop and then you have a mess.\n", "timestamp": 1630406814, "digest": "faBcvoVeiVWSRqqVKGiKFFUfQJnILhRsHnAR0HB0iC8", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}
