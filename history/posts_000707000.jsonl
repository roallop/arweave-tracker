I thought “what is he doing?” and dismissed it as something silly and or crazy.\n\nDogecoin was initially introduced in late 2013 and 7 1/2 years later it has amassed a market cap of $43bn and is one of the most popular crypto assets in the world. It may be silly and crazy, but it has also been a good investment for my friend and anyone who bought it in the early years.\n\nFor those that don’t know, [Doge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_\\(meme\\)) is an internet meme that became popular around that same time. The combination of memes and investing is a powerful cocktail that I have been ignoring for a long time, probably incorrectly.\n\nMore recently we have seen meme investing move into public market stocks like Gamestop, AMC Theaters, Wendy’s, and more. The community that drives these “meme stocks” is based in Reddit and the combined purchasing power of this community is substantial, particularly in illquid stocks (and crypto assets).\n\nIt is easy to dismiss meme investing. The market capitalizations that these meme assets trade at makes no sense on any fundamental analysis. But, as I’ve come to understand, that is not the point.\n\nMemes are fun and memes are also something to come together around. Speculating on the popularity of memes and their staying power is no different than any other form of speculation. And it can be very powerful.\n\nBut more than that, and this is where my head has been going on this topic, the market caps of these memes are also economically powerful. If the board and management teams of the companies with meme stocks chose to issue more shares at these prices, they can raise a lot of capital to transform these companies. Similar opportunities could exist with meme tokens. AMC recently did this with their “meme stock.”\n\nI’ve decided that I am going to stop ignoring and dismissing meme investing and start trying to understand it better. I think it is not something that is going away anytime soon and may turn into something even more interesting.\n\nThat said, I am not suggesting that anyone invest their retirement money or their savings for their kids’ eduction into memes. I believe it is more appropriate for speculating right now. That may change. Or it may not.

Contributors are compensated based on their level of contribution via social graphs and collective allocations.\n\n## How do these teams interact with each other?\n* Community members have clear calls to action to join a team based on their skill sets and interests.\n\n* Leads meet weekly with one another and relevant board advisors to share priorities, challenges, and KPIs. \n\n* Leads and the Board report to Governance at large through monthly Town Halls providing all members progress updates and community discourse. \n\n* Each team is given a seasonal budget based on Snapshot proposals. More value generated equates to bigger budgets for teams to hire and invest. \n\n* Each team lead is assigned a fixed salary, while contributors share the remaining funds pro-rata based on their relative contributions.\n\n* Contributors are compensated based on their value, using tools such as Coordinape or Sourcecred.\n\n* New teams are proposed through governance by aspiring team leads.\n\n* Success is measured by growth of community members that join and actively contribute to a team.\n\n## What improvements will this make? \n\n**Onboarding Funnels**\nCommunity members will have clearer lanes to participate in and contribute to the organization at large. \n\n**Better Proposal Creation Processes**\nThe process and caliber of proposal creation improves due to a better understanding of localized team objectives and specialized contributors who can bring that proposal to life. \n\n**More Accountability** \nTeam Leads drive more value over fractionalized contributors because of focus and a feeling of ownership. \n\n**Currency vs Equity**\nTokens serve as transparent equity while USDC serves as a currency. Contributors can cash out USDC similar to a “real world job”.\n\n## What’s Next?\nFWB finds itself in a unique position to explore the cutting edge of decentralized community coordination. \n\nBy remixing historical Cooperative Organization models with decentralized Web3 needs, we hope this framework provides a good starting point for other communities going through similar hurdles when it comes to empowering and mobilizing members eager to get involved.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we’ll share a full blueprint on Season 3, including calls to action for new teams as well as proposals and tokenomics that underpin the FWB ecosystem. \n\nIf you’re eager to play a Team Lead role in Season 3, send us a DM.\n\nUntil then, we’ll see you in Discord.\n\n---\n\nEndless appreciation for @coopahtroopah, @hospitaltapes, @mikebodge, @ariellebeau, @josemejia, @fakepixels, @raihan_, @fullyallocated for the inspiring conversations.\n\n[Evolution of the FWB DAO](split://0x6EAdcde6dDbf3B5f4754097A221C32e84A011529?network=mainnet)\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1623703841, "digest": "9sRa2kNDUpkWoQkWw67bJ8PczFyTSX8fotf7JOddxew", "contributor": "0xf35880094DC18Df096891E4ccb51212d00311B86"}

{"id": "K68wxjOpUWQSSByJX88ak5Si_N6Ye7LpnkHJAK14EHI", "title": "SF Story: Long Life Administration 长生管理局", "body": "## Preface\nThis science fiction story, written during a Hackathon-like event, is an attempt starting from scratch. The protype for the protagonist of the story is based on a French science fiction writer before Verne, Nicolas Edme Restif de La Bretonne. I was his only researcher in China.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0bee1467-c1a3-44de-bf68-76574d4c731f.jpg?height=643&width=500)\n\n\n\nIn China, this name is rarely mentioned. Even when he is mentioned, he is usually referred to as a pornographic writer, or an early example of foot fetishism. Few Chinese readers know that he once worked in the printing industry and wrote some extraordinary science fiction novels. For example, in his space opera *Les Posthumes*, there is a scene similar to the dimensional collapse in Liu Cixin's  *The Three-Body Problem*.\n\nIn short, it is a communication between a Chinese author born at the end of the 20th century and a French author born at the beginning of the 18th century, across time and space. Almost no one in the world except the author herself and a few researchers, knows the difficulty of this intertext and the joy of its completion. However, even if readers know nothing about these, they can still gain something else from the work.\n\nThanks to the printing press, Restif de la Bretonne's works have been preserved to this day.\n\nToday, blockchain creates new possibilities for the delivery and storage of literature. I think it has unique significance to publish this short story on Mirror, which is also the first Chinese story on Mirror and Arweave.\n\n\n## 前言\n这篇科幻小说，是在一次类似黑客松的活动中限时完成，完全从零开始的尝试。故事的主角原型是凡尔纳之前的法国科幻作家，Nicolas Edme Restif de la Bretonne。我曾是他在在国内唯一的研究者。\n\n在中文世界中，鲜有人提及这个名字。即使有人提起，通常也是称他为情色作家，或是恋足癖的始祖。很少有中文使用者知道，他曾从事过印刷业，并撰写过一些超凡脱俗的科幻小说，比如他的《遗作》中，曾出现和刘慈欣《三体》中降维打击类似的场景。\n\n总而言之，这是一位出生于20世纪末的中国作者和另一位生于18初的法国作者之间跨越时空的交流。除了作者自己和少数研究者，这世上再无人知晓这种互文的难度和完成后的快乐。然而，读者即使不知道这些，也还是能从这部作品中收获其他东西。\n\n幸亏有印刷术的存在，Restif de la Bretonne 的作品得以保存至今。\n\n如今，区块链为内容的传递和存储创造了新的可能。我认为将其发布在 Mirror，让它成为 Mirror 和 Arweave 生态的第一篇中文作品，有着独特的意义。\n\n## 正文\n\n*”本是颁布给生命的律令，我发现其实是颁布给死亡的。”*\n\n### 0\n\n雷蒂夫拔下脑后连接线，推开了操作舱的门。用汗涔涔的双手抵住陶瓷质地的舱沿，向前摩擦，爬起，如同自一次意犹未尽的神经交欢中抽离。\n\n他稳步走向对面的蛋形培养皿，望着里面侧躺的造物。\n\n她体表的温热阵阵向上，凝成隔离膜内细密的水珠，又顺着膜面微导管流走。那道弧线再次显现，从最坚硬的一小片尖端生发，延至刚刚好的部位就戛然而止，没有一丝多余。\n\n雷蒂夫屏住呼吸，将脸凑近那层膜，舌头不由在口腔内打旋。\n\n如同无数次调试完毕后那样，他想将嘴唇贴在那世间最完美的弧面上，给她一个出于敬意的吻。但每个毛孔蓄势待发的费洛蒙只会聚作利刃，捅穿那层微薄的敬意，让她化作一滩黏稠的黑红色琼浆。\n\n系统比他更明白这种危险，警报大作。实验室的门开启，一双机械脚出现在眼前。\n雷蒂夫咬紧下唇。\n\n“您的累计违规次数已达临界值，请随我前往社工处服务。”冷冽的电子音终于响起。 \n\n又是社工处的小惩罚，记不清多少次了。雷蒂夫松开发白的下唇，呼出一团燥热。\n\n自从有人定制了她，雷蒂夫大半时间都在与她轻声对话。日以继夜，夜以继日，模拟芯片组转化的胎教语言直抵她的神经。等她出落得更完美，他再将她拱手交给未曾谋面的主人。\n\n如今已经是第二个了，他却从来没有突破过那层膜。雷蒂夫回望培养皿，炽热的视线再次被隔离膜内新生的水汽截断。\n\n### 1\n“Lung! Lung!” 李喊道。\n\n“Liver! Liver!” 雷蒂夫喊道。\n\n长生管理局门前人头攒动，刻意压低的笑声此起彼伏，还有电子眼不时对准他们拍摄，但很快就转向他们之间的电子广告板：长生局的蓝色主题光依次勾勒出最新款产品的投影，从有“长寿药”之称的抗衰老药丸，到人造血液置换套餐，再到各种义体的指定组合，统统由红光明码标价，再划上巨大的叉号，用更夸张的字体标出季度优惠价。\n\n “Long Life! Long Life!” 他们一起扭动身体，从嗓子里扯出最后一句，转身走进门内，将肝肺人偶套脱下，和广告板一并扔进消毒间。\n\n李是全星系数一数二的操刀医师，负责长生管理局的义体移植手术，虽然经常做出违反公职条规的脱轨行为，但总和雷蒂夫一样被管理层从轻处理，只用扮演管理局吉祥物在门口扭扭屁股了事。\n\n“老家伙，你又亲那只脚了？”李问。\n\n“嗯。”雷蒂夫不禁皱眉。李最初这么问的时候，他还会为“那只脚”解释一通，但对方不仅露出意味不明的微笑，还重施故技，乐此不疲。久而久之，雷蒂夫索性放弃了挣扎，只是简单回复一个单字了事。\n\n“你猜我这次去了哪？——通天塔！”李自问自答，滔滔不绝讲起勇闯禁地的感悟，完了还要挑眉发问：“你就不想知道塔里有什么吗，老家伙？”\n\n雷蒂夫摇头，在李的叹气声中离开。\n\n对于通往地面世界的那座塔，他这个出生于那里的老家伙并无过多好奇。他的大半生都扎根于管理局提供的安稳土壤，将毕生的热爱和向往倾注于一个又一个她，以致她们之外的部分都尽数坍缩，变成没有画面和声音的纯粹描述，哪怕有一日想起，也分不清哪些是现实，哪些是梦和虚妄。\n\n他还能找到一丁点印象，比如以往每年这个时候，他都会随人群前往通天塔，准确而言是裹挟其中，不得不朝所谓的“神”长跪不起。直至地面环境恶化，人群中的优选体进入地下城，这种一年一度的陋习还在少数管理层中延续。\n\n他从不相信塔顶有神的存在。真正的神应该在实验室的培养皿里，在他的意识游走于她神经末梢的欢愉中，抑或在此时此刻每一个路人举手投足之间的端倪里。每当在回家路上看到一个装有义肢的人，他觉得自己就是那个神。\n\n雷蒂夫目光触及对街穿着低帮鞋的女人。脚踝处那一小块异常突起暴露了她的贫穷，她用了造价最低的光能机械义足。即使是寒风阵阵的冬日，她也必须裸露脚踝，让地下城微弱的模拟光照经由电池内活体病毒增强，勉强支持不间断的行走。\n女人身后，通天塔高耸入云。鱼鳞般的塔面，反射的白光自上而下流动，和雷蒂夫记忆中地面的部分并无不同。\n\n他改变了心意，转向通天塔走去。\n\n那层蓝天白云的电子帷幕，似乎已经很久没有因故障显示红蓝色的马赛克。糟糕的造物似乎拥有与生俱来的一致性：有序，僵硬，且残缺。美好的造物大部分时候不在这里，除了今天。\n\n“看，伊瑟！伊瑟！”人群骚动起来，裹着雷蒂夫向声音的源头聚拢。他们眼里充溢着兴奋、好奇，还有某种类似于多年前地面朝圣者的古怪虔诚。\n\n“伊瑟是谁？”雷蒂夫忍不住问。\n\n“全星系最高等的超级优选体。”身着黑色礼服的小男孩奶声奶气地说，声音很快就被流动的喧嚣吞没。\n\n黑压压的人群化作巨兽，舞动不断扩张的触手，如双手合十般，拢住通天塔。\n\n巨兽的五脏六腑变成人头攒动的舞池，一只只形色各异的她纷至沓来，任由雷蒂夫在其中飘飘欲仙。不远处那点隐隐闪耀的光终于爆发，顷刻间刺破大地与苍穹，亦如地面以上那颗发出源源不断光与热的星，仿佛太过靠近就会被吞没。\n\n雷蒂夫跟着人们成群倒塌，屏住呼吸，倒在光源——那只在薄纱下若隐若现的她身边。\n\n “牲人！有一个牲人！地面来的牲人！”人群再次兴致勃勃。\n\n一道黑影穿过人们用克制与敬畏开出的路，直直冲向她。\n\n雷蒂夫想要扑过去，但一切已经来不及。\n\n薄纱扬起，白皙的弧面，贴上去的干裂嘴唇，一同映入众人的眼帘。\n\n是她！一股熟悉感击中了雷蒂夫。\n\n待他用颤抖的手揉过眼睛，妄图把对方看个真切时，薄纱已在黑影和机械兵毫无悬念的打斗中落下。\n\n透过机械兵络绎不绝的脚，雷蒂夫找到了始作俑者。不是另一个她，而是一双从未换过义足的普通老男人的脚，皮肤黝黑粗糙，拇指外侧磨出焦黄色厚茧。褴褛衣衫下，新旧伤痕影影绰绰。新添的那道伤痕最长，来自和机械兵的打斗，一直蔓生至男人的脖颈，还有……\n\n——还有那张和自己几乎一模一样的脸！\n\n雷蒂夫愣在原地，直至她领着机械兵退回远方的塔里，人群消散，他才冲回家。\n\n找到她了！一年前移交手术部还给定制人的那个她，终于找到了！虽然她已经有了施号发令的主人，但那种致命的熟悉感，他绝对不会记错！\n\n雷蒂夫捧出储藏柜内那只高仿真女性义足，浑身战栗地跌坐到床上。他将她抱得更紧了一些，仿佛只有依赖温感模拟的抚慰，才能找回平日里俯拾皆是的安逸感。\n\n可是，一旦回想起那个男人的脸，仍免不了倒吸一口凉气。哪怕对方浑身腥臭，满脸血污，他也能从那同样迷恋的眼神中找到另一个自己。\n\n众目睽睽之下，一个牲人做出了自己一直以来没敢做的事。\n\n牲人，牲人……他努力回想这个词却一无所获，只好接入管理局通用信息库搜寻。\n\n按照地下城新词库解释，牲人泛指未能获批进入地下城的所有地面人，不享有任何合法权利；地面世界又称牲人世界，自优选体定居地下以来，牲人世界已逐渐退回人吃人的蛮荒时代。\n\n他是谁？为什么一个牲人会和自己长着同一张脸？为什么他眼里有着和自己类似的渴望？为什么他可以碰她……雷蒂夫切换了无数关键词，也没能弄明白这些问题。一定是选的词不对，这些她之外的东西，或许还须请教李。\n\n他想起那个牲人因饱经风霜而变形的双足，脑中闪过如今的她安静躺在培养皿里的画面。不！她还不够完美！必须考虑外界受力，必须考虑任何干扰！他要把属于未来的指令也融进芯片里，和她一起去面对外面的世界，让她在如同通天塔前的另一个她一样自如。\n\n可是，又有什么用呢？他曾在交付第一个她前，暗自装载了追踪硬件，但追踪信号最终消失在通天塔内，至今也没再出现过。融入他人身体的她也好，培养皿里的她也好，她们注定不属于他。\n\n雷蒂夫躺在单人床上，来回抚摸怀里的义足，将嘴唇贴在人造皮上摩挲，感受着电子动脉的微弱搏动，以及经由唾液传递的苦涩。如果是她们中的任何一个，该多好。可惜最美好的事物总是生长在精贵的环境中，一旦强行脱离，便注定在血与腐败中窒息。\n\n### 2\n\n“是你？！我没认错人吧？”李瘦削的身子罩在白大褂内，嘴巴张大的同时，正在远程操控手术的双手丝毫没停。\n\n雷蒂夫接入李的手术频道，欣赏高频手术刀瞬间焊合切口、留下平滑的接面，缓缓说：“我想知道牲人和伊瑟的事。” \n\n“没想到一辈子扑在人造脚丫子上的老顽固，竟然想了解这些！”李按照程序般的惯性，完成又一起人造胆囊移植，然后看着雷蒂夫，“说实话，我不知道。” 如同面对不费一招一式就驯服的老蛮牛，李的眼里闪过狡黠的光亮。\n\n雷蒂夫默不作声，陷入思索。李生于斯，长于斯，三十多年光阴大半在医学院度过，等到好奇心觉醒，已是受长生管理局条条框框束缚的公职人。照理说，李不懂这些很正常。\n\n“不过，我听说机械兵昨天在通天塔抓了个牲人，就关在伊瑟住的地方——塔的地下。”李跺脚示意，“我指的是我们的地下。如果你想去瞅瞅的话，我说不定可以帮忙。”\n\n“还有地下？”\n\n“嗯，据说塔的最深处掩埋了不少冒犯超选体的牲人。”李一本正经地说，没等雷蒂夫做出任何回应，就爆发出一阵大笑，“骗你的！都市传说而已。我也不知道塔底有什么，因为突破安全检查没下几层就被逮住了。”\n\n“但我听说你消失了整整一天。”\n\n“谁知道！我印象中只是放风半天而已。或许欢乐的时光从来不能被完整回想，只是在一个又一个当下，一边经历，一边消亡。”\n\n“会不会塔里的时间比外面更慢？”\n\n“难不成像那些地球传说似的，还能用塔把人给定住？”李噗嗤一笑，“现实是你跑得越快，就越能甩开机械兵，抵达更深的地下，但没有谁比系统跑得更快，系统可以在任何一层拦截你。我的记录是第7层，系统用一道巨门把路封死，我只能束手就擒。或许你可以打破记录，回来跟我说说门后面是什么。” \n\n“我不能长时间离开这里……”\n\n“哦，又是为了那只脚。”\n\n“有没有可能，我躺进操作舱，你帮我黑进通天塔系统？我能随时切换到培养皿芯片组的频道……”\n\n“别逗了，老家伙！”李打断了雷蒂夫的畅想，“我仅仅是个略通程序编码的操刀师傅，你也只和连接那些足部神经的芯片器官组打过交道，我们的舞台仅在这里。通天塔的主程序就是一道高不可攀的厚墙，可以将你可怜的意识如摁蚂蚁一样摁死在任何地方。听我的，尽快把工作做完，然后跟我去找一个人。”\n\n“那好，听你的。”雷蒂夫话一说出口，就开始懊恼陷进了李的陷阱，但昨天那张亲吻她的脸仿佛有着无穷的魔力，让他不惜脱轨也要刨根究底。\n\n### 3\n\n雷蒂夫再次从操作舱爬起，已是晚上。\n\n他走向培养皿向她告别，如同即将上前线的丈夫，竭尽全力背过身，生怕多看一眼就情不自禁沦为逃兵。他刚刚通过他们之间的语言，给她写了五封很长的“信”，储存在芯片器官组的预置库。如果他明天没能归来，她仍会依次收到那些，并以更新的生长回应他。\n\n恋恋不舍离开长生管理局，跟随李前往通天塔附近的黑诊所。\n\n李为雷蒂夫的四肢外接了最轻便的机械强化组件。\n\n“这是K，曾是长生局的面部修复师，提前退休后开了这家诊所。”李指着拄手杖走向他们的老头说。\n\nK为雷蒂夫的脸部做了电子易容，接着拿出两片透明薄膜，给他双手的拇指覆上：“这是指纹膜，很贵，只能给你两个。进入通天塔之后，不要用双手其他部位触碰任何指纹识别的东西！”他初看不过是个老年劳工，白发蓬在脑后，精明溢于言表。\n\n雷蒂夫换上李扔过来的西装，再接入对方的视觉系统回看自己。眼前已然是一位风度翩翩的地下城老绅士，正准备去通天塔享受观景台的景致。\n\n“我还想要一款您的手杖，”雷蒂夫转向K，露出意味深长的微笑，“没猜错的话，这是根本没有量产的测试款，整个地下城仅有您手中这一支而已，功能千奇百怪，初衷是将肢体受损者武装成能够自我修复的战士。如果您愿意满足我的小小愿望，我可以为您的诊所无偿服务，直至死亡。”\n\nK拧眉，搭在飞龙形态复古杖柄的双手越握越紧。\n\n一个超过最低退休年限的长生局员工说出“直至死亡”，往往意味着 “直至永远”。他们漫漫余生中所有与生命相关的议题，都将在无限期的公职人长生关怀协定中迎刃而解。\n\nK松开了手。瓷白色的飞龙跃至雷蒂夫手中。\n\n“这些东西只能在迫不得已时帮你应付，”K补充说，“如果丢了，十个你加起来也赔不起。”\n\n“放心！只要不过分，那些机械兵不会真的伤害长生局的人。毕竟我们之中少了任何一个，那些靠长生局续命的混蛋都会痛不欲生——是真的痛，也是真的会死！” \n\n李永远是局里骂得最凶却也最卖命的那一个，唯有卖命，才能撑起他肆意生长的好奇心，让它们在庞杂的信息流之中穿针引线，织出天罗地网。\n\n按照李的指示，雷蒂夫绕过九曲十八弯的小巷回到主干道，一路大摇大摆走向通天塔，正视机械兵的电子眼，将大拇指小心翼翼摁在识别器上。踏进观光升降梯，一笔不菲的观光费用已从身份所有者的账户扣除。\n\n通天塔地面部分共有177层，如同一把竖起的尖刀，直指空中那颗源源不断供能的光点。自从“神”消失，地面环境恶化，优选体成群搬进地下城市，塔的地下部分才正式进入人们的视野，成为连接地面世界的唯一通道。\n\n雷蒂夫的目光在全透明的空间内游走，拂过平滑的纳米疏水涂层，锁定弧顶的一小块凸起：∞，代表无限的符号，李没提过。\n\n“先生，那是177层的象征，神的场域。”引导员对雷蒂夫说完，转向所有人，“我们即将前往地面127层的观景台……在那里，您可以和友人举杯畅饮，欣赏难得一见的地面景象。您还可以下至2层——这是另一个对外开放楼层，设有虚拟实境舞厅，请和舞伴尽情享受美好的夜晚……”观光梯上行，塔的透视模型以蓝白色投影显现在眼前，红光和数字在所在楼层间耀动。\n\n地下城的街道建筑向脚下坠落，脱焦成黄白光点。很快，光点也跌落深渊。观光梯穿过电子帷幕，如气泡般在地层内上浮，历经漫长的黑暗，破土而出，重见光明。\n\n人们在空荡荡的塔内加速上升，直达127层，踏进静候多时的观景台。\n\n雷蒂夫要了一杯香槟，走向观景台佯装欣赏外景。\n\n周围大多数人被外面的世界吸引，仅有少数人提到被抓起来的那个牲人，津津乐道于那个都市传说：塔的最深处掩埋了不少违规的牲人。\n\n塔外是无尽的永昼，一旦拆掉塔身的滤光保护层，地下居民脆弱的皮肤将在赤裸的光照下晒伤。想要看清外景，只能付费连接塔外的监控系统，它们可以清晰捕捉到方圆百里内大街小巷行走的任何一个人。\n\n先在这一层消磨时间，然后回到2层的咖啡厅，沿楼梯向下突破机械兵，“跑得越快，越能深入地下。”雷蒂夫一边回想李的提醒，一边盘算接下来的行动。\n\n“我的天！原来那些传说都是真的！”身侧的陌生女人尖叫着退出付费监控，瘫坐在地，双肩止不住颤抖。\n\n服务生仿佛司空见惯，上前递给女人一杯凉水，一言不发回到吧台。\n\n地面世界又称牲人世界，自优选体定居地下以来，牲人世界已逐渐退回人吃人的蛮荒时代。雷蒂夫想到昨天查到的解释，没等女人开口就关闭了自己的听觉系统。\n\n世界遁入无声，女人双唇不断张合，裸露在外的双臂汗毛倒立，她继而掩面呜咽，脚趾用力向地面收拢，引领众人一同跪倒在地。\n\n“……万幸生活在地下，感谢神！感谢伊瑟！”雷蒂夫只听见他们说出这些话。\n\n“感谢神！感谢伊瑟！”他将杯子拿回吧台，朝服务生喃喃道，“对我这个老头来说，这些太刺激了。”\n\n“出门进升降梯，下到二楼，虚拟实境舞池已经开放，您可以在那找回放松的感觉。”调酒师提醒说，与此同时仍专注于瓶瓶罐罐之间。\n\n雷蒂夫向对方道谢，撑着拐杖健步走出观景台。升降梯极速下落，他感到一阵轻松。\n\n走近舞池，立刻接入手杖的视觉系统，视角从习以为常的俯视地面抬升至胸部左右。旋转杖柄的龙头，让视线在红蓝光影间来回穿梭。\n\n换作平日，他定会低头寻觅一个又一个她，找出长生管理局流出的造物们。但此时此刻，成为伊瑟一部分的那个她，还有昨日公然亵渎她的那个牲人，早已吸走他所有的注意力。他只想找到他们，弄明白一切，而不是日复一日遥望培养皿里的她，干等着那一天来临，将她送走，被迫切断所有联系，独自在空虚中开始新的背叛。\n\n如同工作时为客制化肢体建模那样，雷蒂夫根据李和现场提供的信息，绘制出2层的三维结构草图，定位出通往下层的出口。拨开人群前，他试图接通她的追踪器，但照旧一无所获。\n\n离开舞池，在机械兵伸手拦住自己之前，雷蒂夫手杖内的工具组就弹出又收回，让对方保持了缄默。他太熟悉它们了，早在长生局开发义体之前，他和李就在拿这些家伙练手，如今只需要看一眼外观，就能判定机体型号，找出要害。\n\n雷蒂夫沿着楼梯向下跑，掠过一个个机械兵，越跑越快。\n\n在这场以突围为名的拆卸实战中，手杖是武器也是指挥棒，他不像战士，而似这些东西的创造者。不论是一版接一版的设计图纸，还是一次又一次的组装拼接，都毫无保留地印刻在他脑海里。现在，他将它们抽调出来，和眼前的实物重叠，通过外部机械强化的力量，将拆卸动作演绎得行云流水，细致到每一颗螺丝钉的旋转，每一道切割的位置、深浅和弧度。\n\n楼梯呈螺旋状向下，两侧墙壁平滑，不时用手杖敲击也试探不出任何机关。楼道内静得出奇，双方的脚步声和交锋时的金属摩擦声此消彼长。\n\n不要沉湎于演出！你的目的是向下，找到那个牲人和她，弄清真相。雷蒂夫再次关闭听觉系统，集中注意力回想李的话。\n\n“没下几层就被逮住了……”\n\n“我印象中只是放风半天而已……”\n\n“你跑得越快，就越能……深入地下……没有谁比系统跑得更快……我的记录是第7层……一道门把路封死……门后面是什么……”\n\n“只要不过分，那些机械兵不会真的伤害长生局的人……”\n\n现在位于第4层，距离李的第7层记录还有一段距离，攻略即将结束。面对全然的未知，雷蒂夫能做的只是减少体能消耗，让自己保持平静。\n\n穿过最后一个拐角，恰好看见那道封死去路的白色巨门。雷蒂夫深吸气，拆下手杖内的工具，装载至四肢，和它们融为一体。\n\n第一个机械兵出现了。跃至它身后，伸出右手，从颈后开始，沿脊柱一路下切至尾椎。然后，利刃换成旋动的起子，自下而上，仿佛用力按下一个个琴键，螺钉一颗接一颗落地，叮咚、叮咚、叮咚。另一只手对付新的来敌，并找准空隙收回，配合右手切出缺口，足以供单手没入。在密集线路中穿袭的手，仍在反复轮转，连剥带切，突破一层层的钢铁皮囊，直到紧握住机器人胸腔中仍在发热的能量棒，将其完好无损地抽出。\n\n拆卸队列最后一个机械兵时，雷蒂夫已经站在一座钢筋铁骨堆砌而成的小山丘上。\n只是片刻，山丘摇身一变，化作一道由机械零件构成的防护墙，死死堵在了拐角处。战斗已不再是突围，而是彻彻底底的改造。无需创造者发号施令，墙面就能通过连接线从能量棒汲取力量，对曾经的同类发出致命光束。\n\n雷蒂夫背过身，快步走向伫立在道路尽头的白色巨门。\n\n他站在它面前，宛如一个满怀好奇的孩子，小心翼翼抬起手杖敲击它，将耳朵贴向它，而它只是回以静默无声和庄严肃穆，以及他目光所及之处那没有一丁点瑕疵的表面。\n\n长生局接到第一张生物性义足订单时，他也是面对着空无一物的培养皿，将毕生所学和热爱倾注其中。等到终于造出新的生命，已是满头花白，哪怕不间断服用长生局最新的抗衰老药剂，定期换人造血液，都无济于事。\n\n然而，眼前平滑如镜的陌生让他不知所措，头脑一片空白。\n\n伴随轰隆的巨响，机械防护墙倒塌，机械兵冲了过来。\n\n希望无缝可钻，逐渐凋零，绝望顺着他未解的疑惑，肆意蔓生。 \n\n要放弃吗？可是，根本不存在不放弃的选项，不是吗？雷蒂夫的右手不甘地拍在巨墙上——是和实验室操作舱边沿类似的陶瓷触感。\n\n墙面以他稀薄的手汗为润滑剂，极速向下滑动。雷蒂夫整个人跌了进去，手杖被抛至更远的墙面，发出一声闷响后，横躺在地面。\n\n机械兵愣在外面，巨门重新闭合。\n\n他打破了李的记录，如愿以偿来到了所谓的“门”后面，但眼前只有比外面更加无懈可击的陌生：整个空间形如一滴水的内部，一成不变的纯白色铺天盖地，举目四望，只有地面巨大的“－∞”符号引人瞩目。\n\n如果说∞代表177层神的场域，那么－∞是否象征着距离神最远的地狱？雷蒂夫来不及多想，越来越强烈的失重感就直接给了他答案：水滴在极速下降！\n\n原本横在地面的手杖，散落的零件，连同雷蒂夫本人，都在180度旋转倒置后，陪同水滴共同演绎无声的下落。雷蒂夫伸腿将手杖拨到身旁，重新握紧。\n\n印有－∞的地面褪去白色的视觉层，深渊在雷蒂夫头顶暴露无遗，仿佛随时能吞噬所有的光亮。咔啦咔啦，如同钝刀剁骨般的声响穿透耳膜，水滴自弧面中心向尾端开裂。\n\n咔啦——音量最大的一声过后，雷蒂夫的左下方出现了一道缺口，柔光照射进来，一只手握住了他的脚，不分由说将他向下拉。待他整个人几近脱离水滴，一股自下而上的冲击力却将手杖从他手中卷走。\n\n手杖直奔上方的深渊，雷蒂夫则经过180度倒置，重返塔内。\n\n“我救了你！”拉他的男人说，“那是通往外宇宙的通道，星系需要修复引力须时才会启用。你不是专业的修理师，没穿任何防护装备，一旦冲出去，就会像刚刚那根手杖一样，只在监控录影中留给世人被拉长的残影。”\n\n雷蒂夫准备搜索对方口中的各类陌生名词，但尚未平复的疯狂心跳让他无法发出任何指令，只能乖乖趴在地上大口喘气。\n\n“喔！我忘记了，长生局的人往往两耳不闻窗外事。”\n\n男人强行接进雷蒂夫的视觉系统，为他展示动态模型：首先是一颗耀眼的恒星，一颗颗行星围绕它运动；然后，仿佛有一只无形的手指将行星颗颗捻碎，又将研磨过后的齑粉和成泥，以恒星为核，造出包裹它的壳；紧接着，壳内出现一座座高塔，壳外长出无数条根须，根须从塔尖向下的根系中汲取能量，转化成向外拉直的作用力，支撑外壳稳定；最终，生命和建筑以塔为圆心向四周生长，连成新的文明。\n\n雷蒂夫摇摇头。这些都是学校《创世纪》课程教的东西，他不信这些，在毕业那天就将那些文件全部从储存库粉碎删除。\n\n“如果你读过一些老祖宗的东西，我是说地球先祖的东西，你应该知道一个叫弗里曼•戴森的家伙，他曾提出过我们这种包裹母恒星的球形星系。而根据他的一位同行——卡尔达肖夫的定义，我们这种能够百分百利用恒星能源的星系，理应属于最高级的文明——只有神才能造出这种完美的文明！”男人指向上方。\n\n雷蒂夫抬头，瞥见一张和自己一样的脸，写满虔诚，兴致高昂。\n\n没等他表现出任何诧异，那道熟悉的白皙弧面再次出现在他面前——是她！\n\n“他是夏尔，来自地面世界，”她如今的主人说，“昨天我赦免了他，现在他和你一样是为这个世界默默付出的公职人，只不过在塔里效力。”\n\n“可是……”雷蒂夫盯着夏尔细滑无痕的肌肤，怎么也无法相信他就是那个冒犯她的牲人，但他余光拂过她时的那种迷恋，又分明和自己不分高下。\n\n“没有可是，”伊瑟扶起雷蒂夫，轻声细语地解释，“我知道你想说什么。人们总喜欢对眼前的美好视而不见，转而去相信阴谋论和都市传说，比如什么塔的最深处埋了所谓的牲人，但刚才你也看到了，这里只有用来维护引力须的通道而已。”\n\n“心中没有热爱的家伙，才会孜孜不倦，无中生有，借此填补自己空虚的心灵。”夏尔补充道。\n\n雷蒂夫脑中闪过李的脸，不由为自己闯进通天塔的行为感到羞愧。\n\n“但你和夏尔不一样，你们不仅长得相似，还拥有热爱的事物。在神的眼中，所有的热爱平等如一，只需稍加引导，它们就会像引力须一样，汲取光明，变成这个世界不可或缺的支撑力。所以我赦免了夏尔，让他享用长生局的修复手术，以更好的状态继续热爱这个世界。唯有热爱，才能浇灌出自然界最美丽的花朵。”\n\n雷蒂夫匍匐在地，双手接过伊瑟的右脚，印上一个颤抖的吻。\n\n这一次，不再是对于“造物”的觊觎，而是一位信徒摈弃杂念后最纯净的吻。\n\n### 4\n雷蒂夫怎么也想不到，伊瑟竟会像赦免夏尔那样，原谅自己违规的行为，还让自己留宿通天塔。\n\n“很晚了，你就住这吧，看看是不是如你想象的那样神秘叵测。”回想着伊瑟打趣说的话，他躺在床上辗转反侧。\n\n培养第一个她的时候，他就在想，定制她的那个人到底是谁。\n\n长生管理局的产品中，最受欢迎的是半机械性人造器官，虽然也需要定期维护，但属于多数人踮脚就可以够得着的价位；其次是体外功能性人造器官，比如人造子宫和乳房，这类器官可以降低人体承受伤害的风险，进而间接延寿，还可以流进二手市场，造福那些买不起一手产品的人。\n\n她所属的产品类型叫做生物性人造器官，因为排异反应相对较弱而受到管理层和富豪们的欢迎，但这些人更换的都是内脏，鲜有人会订制一只生物性义足，还要求外观细节。这不仅是造价高昂和极易失败的问题，还涉及足部的复杂构造：骨骼数量占据人体骨骼总数的八分之一，弯曲度和排列各不相同，难以如其他器官一样精准建模成像，加上丰富的肌肉、韧带和神经分布，即使成功造出来，当事人接受移植手术时，也将遭受难以想象的痛苦和排异。\n\n交付她的时候，雷蒂夫仍然忧心忡忡，生怕她一脱离手术室就腐烂生疮，告别人间。当追踪器的信号消失在通天塔的位置时，他的担忧抵达顶峰，化为夜里绵延不绝的噩梦。\n\n直至看到伊瑟昨天在通天塔前的人群间走过，直至今天亲吻她的时候，被皮下温柔的脉搏击中心脏，所有的噩梦才烟消云散。她找到了最高尚且神圣的主人，不需要他的千叮万嘱也能优雅自如。\n\n雷蒂夫闭上眼，准备迎接一场空前的美梦，但没几秒整个人又从床上弹起来。\n\n不，还可以做的更好！必须考虑外界受力，必须考虑任何干扰！如果能将伊瑟睡眠期间的信息集成进芯片组，下次手术她或许能少遭点罪。\n\n唯有热爱，才能浇灌出自然界最美丽的花朵。雷蒂夫默念伊瑟的话，爬下床开门，赤着脚挪移。\n\n他看到她了！赤裸裸的她，在伊瑟身披的薄纱下踮起，足面青筋轻微突出，和胫部一起拉出一条略带弧度的直线。\n\n她无声行进着，踏过冰凉的地面，钻进一扇门，向一张床靠近，然后爬上那张床。接着是人的手臂，她的五指上下起伏，从那只手臂的腕部攀爬至肱二头肌的部位，再是肩膀，最后是脸——那张和雷蒂夫长得一模一样的夏尔的脸。\n\n雷蒂夫屏住呼吸，看着她在那张脸上来回磨蹭，没多久就被一只手抓住。那只手在她的心口搔弄着，几小时前，它曾握过雷蒂夫的脚，还救了他的命。\n\n“哈——”她的主人终于笑出声，整个人蜷进夏尔的怀里。\n\n“今天真是吓了我一跳，那家伙竟然打开了流放舱的门。”夏尔握住她，贴在自己脸上，“要不是发现及时，他就和昨天流放的那个牲人一样，被冲击波拍出临界面，一路坠到外宇宙，成为吸附在引力须上的尸体。”\n\n“毕竟你们都是0代复制人，他也不用像那个牲人一样风餐露宿，有部分生物信息重合很正常。”伊瑟说，“放心，明天我就把所有识别器的容差降到最低，决不让这种事再发生。”\n\n夏尔低头，在她的脊背轻轻吻了一下：“来，你说说，接受两个同源复制人亲吻的滋味，有什么不同？”\n\n“还不是为了实验室里那一只！得和长生局打声招呼，留那家伙住一夜，外面的时间足够他们准备一套新说辞，关于如何将牲人修复成细皮嫩肉的地下城居民之类……我每说一句话都是对身体的损耗，而我竟然对他说了那么多鬼话，过阵子也该去长生局更新声带和喉腔了。”\n\n“不用换那些，太痛苦，”夏尔修长的手指在那道弧面上来回游走，“只要有她，你就是我最完美的爱人。”\n\n伊瑟不再说话，任由夏尔把玩那只在他看来美轮美奂的义足。以往，她偶尔会因连接面弯折过度引起的剧痛而蹙眉，但久而久之，她已经学会用更灿烂的笑容，将这些微表情掩盖得越来越不着痕迹。\n\n“想听听故事吗？”\n\n伊瑟点头，等待夏尔开讲。每当他捧起她的义足，总会讲同一个故事，仿佛是想生造出两个平行世界，让她闭嘴聆听，成全他在另一个世界里对她的义足尽情耳鬓斯磨。\n\n“自从被我们称为神的高级文明创造这个星系，将最初的7个人类采集样本无限复制，投放到这个实验场，迫使复制人之间近亲繁殖，分化出优选体，又从优选体中选拔管理者。而我有幸成为其中一员，从诞生之日起，就在与神对话，认识人类，认识这个宇宙，维护整个社会的稳定，并凭借基因优势，成为最长寿的管理层。等神无故消失，世界陷入混乱，我理所当然成了统辖地下城的代理神，设立了长生管理局，保留文明的火种，接着在一个朝圣日遇到你，我完美的爱人，我恒久的代理人……”\n\n伊瑟依偎在夏尔怀中，感受着那颗人造心脏均匀跳动。被夏尔选中前，她还是通天塔外患有早衰症的牲人，哪怕日日逃命，也逃不过烙进基因里的短命；直到被选中，焕然一新的身体，关于人类历史和宇宙的种种美妙图景，跪拜在她脚下的地下城民，还有夏尔在她脚下迷离的眼神，都让她感到快乐。她庆幸自己长出这样一双无与伦比的脚，也庆幸夏尔迷恋的是脚，庆幸神选择了夏尔。这个星系就是一个巨大的实验场，身为最低微的实验品，如果有机会享用最高权限，为什么不呢？\n\n“我可以问你一个问题吗，夏尔？”\n\n“嗯？”\n\n“既然0代人已经所剩无几，为什么还要流放那些和你同源的牲人？”\n\n“美也是一种资源，而她是这里最稀缺的资源，”夏尔用舌尖在义足上划出一道濡湿的弧线，“最原始的7个人类样本中，无人拥有一双完美的脚；地下城所有人中，也无人拥有一双完美的脚。你是这个星系的奇迹，伊瑟，我不允许任何人亵渎奇迹。我最初看到她的时候，就能穿透那些薄茧和伤痕，看见写入你骨骼和神经里的美……”\n\n### 5\n雷蒂夫一夜未眠，失魂落魄回到长生局，没和李打招呼，没听系统的任何废话，就钻进了实验室的操作舱。\n\n“那你也流放我吧！” 他忘不了昨夜那句愚蠢的开场台词，还有扑向她时被夏尔一拳打趴在地的怂样。\n\n自从她的主人说出“还不是为了实验室里那一只”，并送气至鼻腔，哼出那声傲慢的笑，那个神圣无比的女神形象就如水滴形流放舱一样，突然褪去纯白无害的视觉层，渐趋崩裂，将受害者拍向没有归途的深渊。\n\n“回去做好你的事，我不会流放你，也不会让你有任何机会寻死。一个人能在安稳的环境中坚持一生热爱，受到尊敬和厚待，这在任何时代、任何地方都不是件容易事，你应该感到幸运。”夏尔说这些的时候，目光仍倾注在她身上，连一丝余光都不肯瞥向他。\n\n夏尔甚至没有抬手，伊瑟就将他的意志转达给了通天塔的系统。机械兵包围了没有任何武器的雷蒂夫，毕恭毕敬地将他抬出塔外。\n\n他想要救她，想将她从那个满嘴谎话的女人身上卸下，带离夏尔充满控制欲的视域，放回实验室的培养皿里。她理应躺在这里，如这个她一样平静安详，经由贴片和细密的连接线，从模拟器官芯片组里读取他对她源源不断的爱意。这里没有朝拜的城民，没有崇尚虐恋和暴力的控制者，没有恒星，也没有浩渺无垠的宇宙，只有愉悦的生长。\n\n就如那个骗子女人讲的，唯有热爱，才能浇灌出自然界最美丽的花朵。\n\n雷蒂夫平躺在操作舱内，在空荡荡的黑暗中朝她絮絮叨叨，讲述在通天塔里的遭遇。他实在太累了，讲着讲着，不由自主合上了眼，掉进一个瑰丽的梦里。\n\n梦境中，他和李站在长生管理局门口扮演肝肺吉祥物人偶，声嘶力竭喊出最后一句广告词，将人偶套和广告板扔回消毒间。\n\n李开始向他讲述自己受罚的原因：一场擅自闯进通天塔的违规冒险。“你呢，老家伙？又是因为那张脸？”李开口，说出与他记忆中截然不同的问句。\n\n“那张脸？”\n\n“是啊，又搞砸手术了吧？我明白你的感受，面对枯燥无味的工作，忍无可忍就容易出差错，哪怕是地球先祖早已熟练的整容手术……”\n\n没等李说完，他就冲回了实验室。\n\n实验室里，没有操作舱，没有蛋形培养皿，没有她，只有站在空间中央的老头，不时伸手调整周围的投影模型：无数张千篇一律的女人的脸。\n\n“她呢？”雷蒂夫问。\n\n“什么？”老头不情愿地抬头。他长着黑诊所老板K的脸，头发却乌黑光亮。\n\n“那只……脚？”\n\n“你在说些什么鬼话？交代你的事情做完了吗？如果下次再搞砸我的手术，我就申请换助手！”老头怒气冲冲抛下话，不再看他。\n\n画面碎裂重组，一切回到了宣告神消失的那一年。他放弃所有娱乐，每日沉浸式研究面部修复，终于如期通过公职人测试，加入长生管理局，和其他优选体一起涌进通天塔，迈向地下城的新生活。\n\n他沿着塔内楼道向下，行囊和同伴消失。他竭力奔跑，看到那扇白色巨门，接着被一群机械兵摁在上面。掌心紧贴巨门，但门纹丝不动。\n\n一个没有换过义足的女人走过来，她的脸和实验室里那些投影模型分毫不差。\n\n女人身后，走来另一个面部表情更加凝重的K。\n\n另一个K捏住他的下巴，仔细端详后，打开了巨门，像对待一个牲人那样，将他一脚踢了进去。\n\n巨门闭合，水滴徒然下落。头脚倒置。白色落幕，－∞消失，深渊在头顶显现，无形的推力擒住了他。\n\n意识脱壳弥散，望着他的躯体一路向上飞升，逐渐被拉长成一条直线，如磁针般穿透外地表，最终吸附在那根向宇宙深处拉直的引力须表面，跟随整个星系，在没有一丁点星光的外宇宙流浪。\n\n……\n\n不落的恒星照耀着内地表，它的光芒如雨水般渗入地面，化作电子帷幕上面缓缓升起的旭日。他起身，发现她还在他的手中侧身沉睡，窗外漏进的光线恰好落在她脊背上，描摹出那条奇迹的弧线。\n\n“这是世界上最美的生命。”他感叹道。\n\n她的主人醒来，迫不及待将这句话昭告天下。\n\n很快，长生管理局义体研发部接到了无数新订单。\n\n他接进长生局的监控系统，透过摄像头观察着实验室里一筹莫展的夏尔，看他头发由黑变灰。终于有一天，对方露出了自信满满的笑容，日夜留守实验室，几乎忘记了家里那只高仿真的温感义足。\n\n不久之后，整个地下城都将成为让他们飘飘欲仙的舞池……\n\n雷蒂夫扯掉连接线，撑住操作舱单侧边沿，一个踉跄跌倒在地。\n\n他爬向培养皿，等待隔离膜内面的水雾散去，看清她安然无恙的容颜。\n\n还是那个世界。雷蒂夫松了一口气。霎时间，他竟真的感到一丝侥幸。\n\n一滴浓稠的泪水落在隔离膜外表面。警报大作。\n\n雷蒂夫关掉听觉系统，呜咽声转化为小腹和软腭的痉挛，以及自喉腔内喷薄而出的震颤。\n\n为什么？为什么是这样的世界？内心有一个声音回响。\n\n他走出长生局，同行尸走肉般走进通天塔，如同打开结局被攻略写尽的单线游戏。\n\n会有答案吗？他望着观光升降梯顶部象征神之场域的∞。\n\n他离开观光梯，回到楼道向塔顶奋力奔跑，像是从地狱跑向神明，又像是从家冲向实验室的培养皿。他越跑越快，如同覆风而上，将那些机械兵和无意义的战斗全都远远甩在身后。\n\n通天塔的177层，被称为神的场域，也是距离那颗恒星最近的楼层。\n\n那扇轻掩的门出现在他眼前，只需抬手，不动用任何增强组织，就能将它轻易推开。\n\n强光倾泻于建筑物表面，几经转化流进塔内，成为电，成为光，成为门缝间摇曳生姿的纯白色。\n\n雷蒂夫抬手推门。那道白光也覆上他的手背，像抚摸造物一样抚摸着他。\n\n门推开了，白光漫射开去，偌大的水滴状空间清晰可见，什么都没。\n\n世界终究还是那个世界，空空落落，落落空空，不论神来没来过。\n\n雷蒂夫迫不及待背过身，倒进观光梯，盯着穹顶的∞符号出神，直至眼前闪过她的侧颜。\n\n至少每次从操作舱爬起、走向她的那一刻，他是快乐的，也是幸运的。\n\n观光梯下行……\n\n第二天早上，他又准时出现在长生管理局的义足实验室。\n\n### 尾声\n雷蒂夫归来后，继续每天在泡在实验室，经常和李一起受罚，在长生管理局门口扮成肝肺人偶扭屁股，喊出来自地球某个年代通用语的愚蠢口号。\n\n没多久，地下城所有安保设备都调低了识别容差。李再也不能借助黑诊所的道具混进通天塔。每次问雷蒂夫巨门之后的东西，对方也只是回复一个个单字敷衍过去。\n\n偶尔，李会悄悄跟踪雷蒂夫回家，却发现他再也没在下班后直接回家，而是辗转于地下城的阴暗街头，不断在街道墙面刻下令人匪夷所思的数据，符号，图像，或者不属于任何已知语言的词句，仿佛那些可以承载他未能说出口的一切。\n\n于是，雷蒂夫为什么要写这些，变成李所有好奇心的目标，支撑起他干瘪的生活。\n直到有一天，他忍不住潜入雷蒂夫家中，发现储藏柜的义足上刻着一句话：\n\n*“对于    我做过神奇的研究，至今没有人能将它猜透。”*\n\n他调高电子眼的清晰度，仔细钻研那处空白周围划掉的东西，根据划痕从深到浅，依次为：\n\n*爱，\n神，\n∞，\n她，\n以及空白自身。*\n\n（**Author：** K Erica）", "timestamp": 1623721284, "digest":

{"id": "V9H9ElcjTVDZOOC4mqTnrY7DE7F2yRIAwFPbdmnq2j0", "title": "The Composability of Identity across Web2 and Web3", "body": "A decade or two ago, your digital identity didn't mean very much. It was represented more by your email address than any social media account you had. Fast forward to today, and we've seen an increased focus on how we appear in online media by everyone: yourself, your friends, and your employers. Most of our day-to-day interactions exist in digital accounts on someone's database. \n\nYet all-in-all, your digital worth is measured by the engagement (and advertising revenue) garnered. Sometimes you get a share of that revenue, but for 99% of us, the value of our digital identity is locked within the platform. This doesn't just apply to Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit - the \"platform\" can be our workplace as well. \n\nLet's say you've worked at a company for a few years, and you've decided to move on. When you leave the company, your reputation still stands with individuals you've worked with and in the many programs/emails you've created, but otherwise, the company's reputation is your reputation. This dynamic has slowly changed with the rise of the internet - hence the rise of the personal brand. However, your personal brand is still built off of your own word (which may or may not have much value when first starting out). \n\nOur digital identity exists in fragments, it isn't flexible past the platform it was built on, and it has little reusability other than cross-platform authentication. We don't own our digital identity, and it's not composable at all. Now, what if you could **own all of the pieces of your digital identity permanently**, while also **controlling who you reveal that data to** and **how it's represented**? This would enable us to tell more compelling stories and have a [user-controlled value function](https://medium.com/hackernoon/richard-stallman-future-of-software-innovation-4e591fa93d7f) for identity. I think we're (finally) not so far off from a future where all of that is possible.\n\nBut the phrase \"digital identity\" is really complex and abstract. Let's start by sorting it into a treemap of `identity type -> platform type -> transaction type -> action type`. \n\n## Hierarchy of Digital Identity\n\n![I know, it's a thicc chart. Desktop viewing is best for easier zooming.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fd111bed-0b7d-4714-98bf-0ff8c3a1283b.jpeg?height=541&width=1847)\n\nFor identity types, I've split it into physical and digital identity (physical is hidden for this article). The next layer is platform types, which I've just split into Web2 and Web3 for now. In the future, it may not be so simple to separate which platform different types of transactions are coming from. Now for the meat and potatoes of this breakdown, transaction and action types:\n\n**Social Transactions**: These are transactions where you have a set individual or group of individuals you know you want to interact with. \n&nbsp;&nbsp; - *Individual*: This is just like Venmo when you pay or interact with someone for any number of reasons\n&nbsp;&nbsp; - *Community*: These are actions that go towards some group cause, and can be anything from funding a treasury to governing actions for spending from that treasury.\n&nbsp;&nbsp; - *Gaming*: This is another way of saying actions where the result/end party of the action isn't always known. In many games, this is common, like going on raids or adding to/interacting with some city on your journey.\n\n**Protocol Transactions**: These are transactions where you interact with a product for its specific benefits or utility. \n&nbsp;&nbsp;- *Selling/Acquiring*: These are marketplace actions, where the protocol is used to conduct a peer-to-peer interaction. \n&nbsp;&nbsp;- *Staking*: This is an action where you are staking your belief in a protocol, acting as a core member of the product community. The actual use of the stake may vary, but the signaling is the same. \n&nbsp;&nbsp;- *Use*: I'm defining \"use\" here as the primary use case action of the protocol. Sometimes that may be \"selling/acquiring\" or \"staking.\"\n\n**Conversations**: These are transactions where you are trying to work with (or against) others to directly push towards some goal or understanding (in a friendly and sustainable way). In the context of this article, these conversations are focused on the growth and governance of communities/products/protocols. \n&nbsp;&nbsp; - *Proposals*: These are like Ethereum Improvement Proposals, but can be much more general too. \n&nbsp;&nbsp; - *Moderation*: Some examples are Reddit mods and Twitch chat mods, where they enforce rules set by proposals. \n&nbsp;&nbsp; - *Feedback*: This is usually in direct response to proposal or moderation actions. A lot of this is providing a larger context and bridging the conversation between old and new users.\n\n**Contributions**: These are transactions where you either create something or engage (without conversation) with something someone created. \n&nbsp;&nbsp; - *Consumption*: Actions here include liking or saving an article, or running `npm install` on someone's `node js` package. \n&nbsp;&nbsp; - *Creation*: This includes creating new ideas, products, integrations, and much more.\n&nbsp;&nbsp; - *Sharing*: These actions contribute directly to network effects, and typically act as bridges across platforms and communities.\n\nOur web of actions ultimately forms our digital identity. I know that even this is still pretty abstract, so let's look at how this could be realistically represented and used.\n\n## Representing Digital Identity in Practice\n\nHere's the structure I've been working with on what digital identity on a more technical level:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/77c22bf6-e54b-4b6e-9826-121670c3d3de.jpeg?height=524&width=1908)\n\nThe first layer is comprised of transaction types (the four we talked about) and social graphs. I didn't include social graphs as part of the identity breakdown since the graph's nodes are each their own digital identity, connected by lines that represent transactions. I've labeled this whole layer as \"not composable,\" meaning I can't detach them from an identifier or really move them around from platform to platform to form a single identity. While transaction data is immutable, it is typically exportable and can be represented in tokens. Social graphs are more difficult to manage in a portable way, first and foremost because current platforms limit the ability to export that data. This has been [a heated topic of discussion](https://stratechery.com/2021/the-webs-missing-interoperability/) for years now, so there's a large lack of transparency on what they actually look like and how to break them down. However, new products and approaches allow you to build up and represent the nodes closest to you in the social graph - which can then also be stored into tokens. That representation as tokens brings us to the second layer of the chart.  \n\nThe second layer (and onwards) highlights categories and products that allow us to represent that transaction data and/or social graph as **tokens**. Since tokens have the qualities of existence, flexibility, and reusability - then by the transitive property - our digital identity now does as well. I can move around these tokens at will to different accounts and in different combinations. If we add on the [permission/connection rules](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2255) wallets already have to the tokens' data, we're coming very close to the picture I painted at the start. \n\nLet's talk about what's behind the tokens of this composable digital identity layer => \n\nTokens built off of transaction data will likely rely on different models and algorithms that may start centralized and then transition to community-governed. These models will take different combinations of transaction and action types depending on what they want to represent. SourceCred allows custom-set rules for measuring [\"contributions\"](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/cred/#calculating-cred). [Spectral.finance](https://docs.spectral.finance/macro-score/on-chain-credit-score) creates machine learning credit score models that may take on a Numerai style many-model architecture in the future. I'd expect [Rabbithole.gg](https://www.notion.so/RabbitHole-Manifesto-75477a7e03634336bba77c4a7b43ee3b) to have some token(s) representing levels of different skills in the future, where the levels are calculated with different models. How we tokenize web2 account transaction data probably won't be that different in structure `data => model => token`. They may rely on existing web2 aggregators like orbit.love and their [model for calculating reputation by community](https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model).\n\nThe fungible versus non-fungible identity token approach here reflects what kind of identity economies will be generated. Fungible tokens act as a standard and stable reputation coin that holds regardless of the type of community or contribution. These may help facilitate creative cross-community collaboration and creative talent acquisition, leading to new treasury management strategies and considerations. Non-fungible tokens are identity bonds that can be staked or lent out, which growing in value over time as an individual's actions continue to evolve. Identity forges (a protocol where you and I place our creditworthiness NFT to create a new representative token) will increase the utility and complexity of this token. Multiply this across all proof tokens and we have the beginnings of an \"identity marketplace.\" \n\nEarlier I said that social graph tokens would likely be represented by your closest nodes instead of the full graph. This comes from the two popular approaches I've seen today:\n1. Sybil Resistant: The theory here is that if I am verified by enough other \"people\" who are real, then I am real. BrightID's health score reflects this, and it seems to be working well. \n2. Tiered Entry: Let's start with 100 people who we know are real and trusted, and then bring in more people based on the selection/voting of those 100 people\n\nWith both of these approaches, your social graph is the people who verified or voted for you. Whether or not these decentralized identities (DIDs) aggregate under addresses or the other way around largely depends on how we interface with the digital world - I believe it will be the former for the same reasons we don't \"login\" to pages with our ENS. The tokenization of these graph shards could take many forms and will likely be layered upon by proof tokens.\n\nAll of these identity tokens represent the earliest primitives, and I'm sure they will be built upon with additional complexity as our mental and technical understanding of \"trust\" and \"digital identity\" evolve. With that as the expectation, our digital identity becomes more like a portfolio, requiring a new set of tools. We've seen community SaaS tools grow over the last few years that help product teams increase engagement with their community of users across platforms, but what I'm pushing for here is an **identity management tool** for the users themselves.\n\n## Building an Identity Management tool\n\nWhile we have asset management tools like Zerion and Zapper, there is no \"identity management tool\" yet. This isn't too surprising as proof tokens are largely still under development for the Ethereum transaction data side, and most protocols still link web2 accounts independently (like mirror.xyz does when you sign up for the $WRITE race). For now, I view the product stack as follows: \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/409338d6-d112-4847-8aee-8922a09975a9.jpeg?height=1017&width=983)\n\nThe data aggregation layer should be managed by other protocols, where each protocol will have decentralized governance of standards and usage. An identity management tool would play with everything in blue, starting as a specialized SDK between all our identity tokens interactions/metadata for wallets to use. While there are many features required for managing identity, I want to start with the actions of verification and permissioning. \n\nLet's focus on connecting unique web2 identifiers (i.e., Github and Twitter accounts) to Ethereum address(es). There is a growing list of tools ([Ceramic IDX](https://idx.xyz/) and [Serto/Veramo Agents](https://veramo.io/docs/veramo_agent/introduction/#:~:text=A%20Veramo%20Agent%20is%20an,in%20the%20verifiable%20data%20space.)) for representing identifiers and action data in standard ways ([DIF](https://lists.identity.foundation/g/sds-wg/wiki), [W3](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)). We can build a verification process users have to pass once and then issue a [verifiable credential](https://docs.serto.id/docs/main-concepts/vcs/) using existing tools onto a decentralized database. Then we build the plugin that fits into a wallet to allow users to manage data sharing with apps. I recently built a proof of concept for this:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cbe8d2e2-de59-4e76-bb4b-b84ee027fb5d.jpeg?height=680&width=1470)\n\n*[tech demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4FoO7Ph5lI)*\n\n*You also may be wondering what a \"snap\" is - this is like a plugin/API built directly into the Metamask wallet. I believe that an identity management tool should be controlled by the user in the most decentralized and private way possible, so building it into a wallet makes the most sense.*\n\nOther added benefits of this approach are:\n\n1. Developers can stop reinventing the wheel and save on AWS overhead/privacy concerns, requiring just one provider request to the wallet instead (no API key or sign-up process required).\n2. Users can stop going through the `input account -> sign -> post sig -> refresh` flow once every few weeks when a new social dapp launches. \n3. Users can start to manage who has access to their identity branches/data since it isn't on a centralized/controlled database.\n\nThis third point is critical, as it opens up a whole new world of applications in terms of verifiable storytelling and data ownership/economies. I think that's the ultimate goal - anyone should be able to curate an identity for the story they want to tell, and if they don't have the pieces then they can build (through transactions) or borrow (through a marketplace) up to it. \n\nIf you like the vision and want to see this built out more, then pick up some $IMAG to bootstrap the project (I'll also create a group for further discussion about this with supporters - maybe make this a DAO if there's enough interest): \n\n[Identity Curators](crowdfund://0x85625B4983E6A54eDA7E237f1a64e0CFB4408c6D?network=homestead)\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1623758649, "digest": "mDu_nGsWpjvF-KaPLADwxeAMfze3UJOtTAQi2CwPwWc", "contributor": "0x2Ae8c972fB2E6c00ddED8986E2dc672ED190DA06"}

For this reason, the Brazilian artist creates unruly images and sounds in a place of disobedience and makes their works a counter-hegemonic fissure, liberating themself in subjectivities.\n\nFind them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/occult3d), [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@occulted) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/occulted/).\n\n***\n\n## About MintFund\n\nMintFund is a community project created with the sole purpose to build a support network for artists interested in bringing their art into the world of NFTs/cryptomedia.

{"id": "1oRKIAJr7uDmiWgta7GowkpXgKmM7uLIajM9CwqiKxU", "title": "Evolution of the FWB DAO\n", "body": "FWB has quickly become one of the most exciting social experiments on the internet. \n\n[Friends with Benefits](https://fwb.help) started as a private Discord server populated by our favorite thinkers and has since evolved into a global community bound together by shared values, shared incentives ([$FWB](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/friends-with-benefits-pro)) and shared IRL + URL experiences – all at the intersection of culture and crypto. \n\n## FWB Today\nThis is how the FWB DAO has developed to date.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hXtIzjx.png)\n\n* FWB was created by a core instigator who had a vision and began inviting close friends to a Discord.\n* As friends brought more friends in, certain contributors began to step up and play lead roles to support growth.\n* Those contributors became the first layer of Staff, incentivized by responsibility, status, and token grants.\n* The group gradually transitioned to a DAO to manage a community treasury.\n* Opportunities to get involved began to plateau as primary functions became filled and weren’t set up to scale. \n* More one-off projects were proposed, but became difficult to manage.\n\n\n## FWB Tomorrow\nAs we head into Season 3, we’ve taken these learnings and built them into a clear **participation framework**. It prioritizes leads and active contributors, making it easier for community members to get involved.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hgfOVfe.png)\n\nThis is reflected in four notable teams. \n\n* Governance\n* Board\n* Team Leads \n* Contributors\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/trWj4IH.png)\n\n\n**Governance** consists of *all* $FWB holders who vote to ratify changes to the DAO through Snapshot and engage with our governance channel and forums. Any $FWB holder is eligible to vote on changes.\n\nThe **Board** is a mix of staff, community members, and advisors who focus on strategy as well as community participation and education. Advisors are incentivized by token holdings as well as community nominations with on-chain salaries. \n\n**Team** **Leads** are specialized leaders that manage teams of contributors. Leads are selected based on track record of contribution for executing projects over sustained periods of time. Leads are empowered to set key priorities, allocate budgets for bounties or rewards, and ultimately are responsible for that team’s success. Leads are paid a USDC salary as well as a vested token grant to ensure accountability and reward innovation. \n\n**Contributors** are the members that power each team – specialized token holders that join based on skills and interest. The teams that currently exist within FWB are Product, Editorial, and Membership. Contributors are compensated based on their level of contribution via social graphs and collective allocations.\n\n## How do these teams interact with each other?\n* Community members have clear calls to action to join a team based on their skill sets and interests.\n\n* Leads meet weekly with one another and relevant board advisors to share priorities, challenges, and KPIs. \n\n* Leads and the Board report to Governance at large through monthly Town Halls providing all members progress updates and community discourse. \n\n* Each team is given a seasonal budget based on Snapshot proposals. More value generated equates to bigger budgets for teams to hire and invest. \n\n* Each team lead is assigned a fixed salary, while contributors share the remaining funds pro-rata based on their relative contributions.\n\n* Contributors are compensated based on their value, using tools such as Coordinape or Sourcecred.\n\n* New teams are proposed through governance by aspiring team leads.\n\n* Success is measured by growth of community members that join and actively contribute to a team.\n\n## What improvements will this make? \n\n**Onboarding Funnels**\nCommunity members will have clearer lanes to participate in and contribute to the organization at large. \n\n**Better Proposal Creation Processes**\nThe process and caliber of proposal creation improves due to a better understanding of localized team objectives and specialized contributors who can bring that proposal to life. \n\n**More Accountability** \nTeam Leads drive more value over fractionalized contributors because of focus and a feeling of ownership. \n\n**Currency vs Equity**\nTokens serve as transparent equity while USDC serves as a currency. Contributors can cash out USDC similar to a “real world job”.\n\n## What’s Next?\nFWB finds itself in a unique position to explore the cutting edge of decentralized community coordination. \n\nBy remixing historical Cooperative Organization models with decentralized Web3 needs, we hope this framework provides a good starting point for other communities going through similar hurdles when it comes to empowering and mobilizing members eager to get involved.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we’ll share a full blueprint on Season 3, including calls to action for new teams as well as proposals and tokenomics that underpin the FWB ecosystem. \n\nIf you’re eager to play a Team Lead role in Season 3, send us a DM.\n\nUntil then, we’ll see you in Discord.\n\n---\n\nEndless appreciation for @coopahtroopah, @hospitaltapes, @mikebodge, @dazuck, @ariellebeau, @josemejia, @fakepixels, @raihan_, @fullyallocated for the inspiring conversations.\n\n[Evolution of the FWB DAO](split://0x6EAdcde6dDbf3B5f4754097A221C32e84A011529?network=mainnet)\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1623772567, "digest": "9sRa2kNDUpkWoQkWw67bJ8PczFyTSX8fotf7JOddxew", "contributor": "0xf35880094DC18Df096891E4ccb51212d00311B86"}

As specific archaeologist build their reputation as expert hunters, their services can be potentially commissioned, such cases already happening.\n\n[](http://pobnfts.com/)\n\nTo continue to empower the role in our community, we are revisiting **core pricing and supply mechanics of $HASH**. Hopefully with the new changes we lower the bar for new archaeologists to join the community. Stay tuned.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1d8031a2-1516-4b0d-bfb9-2f3351e039cb.png?height=1526&width=2802)\n\nWe are also working on dedicated profiles and galleries to highlight some of our most accomplished archaeologists. \n\n## Archivist + Historians\n\nOwners of $HASH NFTs can annotate them with a title and description. This feature being typically used to document the moment of history that is captured. This arises a need to validate these NFTs.\n\nAs annotations can be subjective and malicious to a future buyer, we believe it important to establish a reputable body that the community can rely on as a reliable voice of opinion on the history captured.\n\nWe have already seen quite a few community members informally step up to this role in our discord.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ce6fd3ae-d485-4a5d-ab9e-ba733066ca29.png?height=1070&width=1602)\n\n[](https://github.com/proofofbeauty/HCIPs/issues/2)\n\nTo take this informal verifying a step further, we are working on the $HASH DAO, a DAO of historians and archivist working to validate, study, and categorize NFTs.\n\n\nA few community members have already been selected to be part of the inaugural group of historians in this DAO. They are working hard right now verifying annotations for a few $HASH NFTs as we speak. Stay tuned for the broad launch of the DAO!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ee09cd22-f7cb-457b-a835-a3ce5e51f4a6.png?height=880&width=2074)\n\n\nWe envision this DAO growing in a multitude of ways to help best serve the community and the new demands of the $HASH-verse. The DAO can appoint new historians or establish sub-committees of historians that specialize in specific genres of history. They will act as both an informal and formal resource the community can tap into.\n\nAs demand of their verification of annotations outstrip the capacity of historians, we foresee the DAO creating an economic layer for their services. Collectors of $HASH can commission the DAO to validate annotations which increase the value of their $HASH NFTs. \n\nThe $HASH DAO is in its early stages but we believe there is a ton of opportunity for it to grow and expand its role in archiving history. In the future the DAO can potentially add 'tags' to $HASH NFTs, and individual historians can be commissioned to write the annotations themselves.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d256ca56-453e-4ea8-97f0-06773061a7ef.png?height=430&width=754)\n\n## Artists + Storytellers\n\nHumans are innate storytellers, and $HASH provides a perfect opportunity to tell the stories of ETH.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3476)\n\nEach $HASH represents a single, indivisible, atomic building block for grander story telling. Weave together all the txns involved with a hack into a gallery and you can retell the story like never before.\n\nWe see this creative layer of content on top of $HASH NFT especially interesting; the goal is to make $HASH the Vox of ETH, a repository of interesting and powerful stories of this grand experiment that is Ethereum.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/57cc616b-6197-4036-8698-ef9be6196abe.png?height=1400&width=1400)\n\nTo realize this vision, we are working on creating unique curated galleries, stories written on mirror, zine NFTs, and other content on top of $HASH NFTs. We have also been reaching out to other talented artists and community members.\n\nThese stories will show off the $HASH NFTs and the history they represent. The zine being the first of our experimentations.\n\n---\n\nAs we continue to define these roles in the $HASH-verse, it will become clearer that these roles synergize deeply. Curators/writers can work with historians to write/curate their stories. Artists can work with archaeologists to find the coolest history to reinterpret. Historians can work with with curators to verify and annotate $HASH NFTs that will be used in a new gallery.\n\nWith these networks effects, we believe $HASH can fulfill the role as the 'library of ETH'. As a studio we hope to empower these roles to exist. \n\n  \n\n", "timestamp": 1623774751, "digest": "3Os_kduyxwC9hjqCDjV4LMPKZ-4RrkYW64m5i5iYNcc", "contributor": "0x9428ca8b5fe52C33BD0BD7222d719d788B6467F4"}

For this reason, the Brazilian artist creates unruly images and sounds in a place of disobedience and makes their works a counter-hegemonic fissure, liberating themself in subjectivities.\n\nFind them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/occult3d), [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@occulted) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/occulted/).\n\n***\n\n## About MintFund\n\nMintFund is a community project created with the sole purpose to build a support network for artists interested in bringing their art into the world of NFTs/cryptomedia.
