{"id": "7scC5PJD7nEtI0qWWrcz1WlfavfrXR3MiaRnvbP9Vf4", "title": "Tutorial: How to Stake on Synthetix ", "body": "# What is Synthetix? ⚔️\n\n[Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) is a decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol on Ethereum that enables the creation of synthetic assets (Synths) through its staking mechanism. Traders are able to acquire on-chain exposure to a variety of assets, including fiat currencies, stocks, commodities, and crypto, using the Synthetix platform. \n\nAll Synths on Synthetix are backed by $SNX tokens that holders have staked as collateral into the application. With a high collateralization ratio and a unique minting/burning mechanism, Synthetix offers traders the ability to trade synthetic assets in a decentralized manner with deep liquidity and zero slippage, unlike traditional decentralized exchanges. \n\n# Why Stake on Synthetix? 💰\n\n$SNX holders are incentivized to stake their tokens in order to receive a portion of exchange fees and staking rewards. \n\n* **Exchange Fee Rewards** - Whenever a trader places a trade on Synthetix, they pay a small exchange fee between 10-100 bps that is distributed pro-rata each week to stakers. \n* **Staking Rewards** - The existing $SNX monetary policy is inflationary in perpetuity. The weekly inflation is distributed to stakers as $SNX tokens that vest over a one-year period.\n\n# How do you Stake on Synthetix? 📘\n\nFor this tutorial, you will need:\n\n* A web3 wallet (e.g. Metamask)\n* $SNX tokens\n* $ETH for gas fees\n\n### Minting $sUSD / Staking\n\nFirst, head over to <https://staking.synthetix.io/> and click ‘**STAKE**’ in the center of the page. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/85d6899b-70fb-49b8-ac53-4070ee5f61ca.png?height=343&width=622)\n\nNext, connect your wallet that is holding your $SNX tokens. You can connect your wallet by pressing the dropdown box in the upper right corner labeled ‘**NOT CONNECTED**’. Be sure you are connected to the network you’d like to use (e.g. Mainnet, [Optimism](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/u4qNFL7G5lmhEI7txECyFcsbfQi4rHGHPGdnBNI73pE)).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d41a1538-f22f-4f42-8932-c1919271848b.png?height=256&width=1403)\n\nNow that you are connected, select ‘**MINT MAX**’ in the center of the page (note: you can also mint a custom amount if you’d prefer to try a specific [staking strategy](https://synthetix.community/docs/staking-strategies)). This will populate the maximum amount of $sUSD you’ll be able to mint given your total available $SNX holdings. Once ready to proceed, click ‘**MINT sUSD**’ and confirm the transaction with your wallet. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/618d20fc-2340-4388-82b9-bc7845d2ac00.png?height=299&width=611)\n\nAfter the transaction is complete, you should now have $sUSD in your wallet that you can use to purchase Synths or utilize elsewhere in DeFi. You are now officially staking your $SNX.\n\n### Claiming Rewards\n\nEvery Wednesday, a snapshot is taken of all $SNX stakers, and fees and rewards are distributed accordingly. To claim the rewards, you will need to make sure your collateralization ratio (C-Ratio) is relatively close to the target ratio. You can see your current C-Ratio on the top-center of the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/39a89d54-3c30-450b-8176-4c8824a262c6.png?height=248&width=1316)\n\nAt the time of this writing, the target C-Ratio on Mainnet is 400%, and the target on Optimism is 900%. If you need to adjust your ratio back to the target, you can do this on the ‘**BURN**’ tab by selecting ‘**BURN TO X%**’ and confirming the transaction (note: you will need to make sure you have enough $sUSD in your wallet, which means you might have to purchase additional $sUSD if you are using it elsewhere).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11c6b8d4-48ca-487e-8974-4cc1f95cb5e3.png?height=449&width=605)\n\nNow that your C-Ratio is properly adjusted, it is time to claim your rewards. Hover over ‘**STAKING**’ on the left side-bar and select ‘**EARN**’.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f43cfe91-b3ac-4d7f-9253-b7b8f4e64452.png?height=599&width=629)\n\nSelect the Synthetix Staking Rewards pool. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d33c73c4-9209-4fb9-88a4-90d2a07574a9.png?height=114&width=616)\n\nThe screen that pops up will show you how much you have earned in $sUSD from trading fees and how much $SNX you have received from staking rewards. Press the claim button and confirm the transaction in your wallet to finalize the claim. \n\nCome back each week to claim your rewards (note: rewards do not roll over from week to week).\n\n### Unstaking\n\nWhen you are ready to unstake your $SNX, head back to the ‘**BURN**’ tab and select ‘**BURN MAX**’. Similar to reward redemptions, you’ll need to make sure you have enough $sUSD in your wallet to burn your debt. Click ‘**BURN sUSD**’ and confirm the transaction to unstake. \n\n### Other Considerations\n\n* Make sure to [read up](https://synthetix.community/docs/claiming-rewards#managing-debt) and understand how to properly manage your $sUSD debt. It typically makes sense to [mirror the global debt portfolio](https://blog.synthetix.io/debt-hedging-refresher-for-snx-stakers/). \n* There are [multiple strategies](https://synthetix.community/docs/staking-strategies) for how much debt to mint depending on your risk tolerance. \n\n## Congratulations! 🎉\n\nYou’ve officially staked on Synthetix and claimed your rewards. Your stake is helping to provide the liquidity necessary to create advanced synthetic assets on Ethereum, enabling permissionless trading of derivatives for anyone across the globe.

After riding through the rise and fall of the 2017-2018 period in crypto they had landed on a strong value proposition: *collateralize streaming data for an artist on Spotify and use that to create synthetic assets on-chain that can be immediately paid to the artist.*\n\n**This solved a big problem: slow royalty payments**\n\nSpotify is well known for not producing much income in the way of royalties for artists. What it is not as well known for is how slow those royalty payments can be - sometimes taking as much as 75 days. That is slow, but other sources are even slower. Paperchain recognized this as an issue DeFi was uniquely positioned to solve.\n\nWhat if NFTs weren’t just collectibles or art or token gates? What if NFTs could be programmable collateral?\n\n![High-level diagram of how Paperchain uses NFTs, Tinlake, and DAI for providing immediate royalties on Ethereum.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e3b21906-182b-4a4a-b0fd-2107c345abc8.png?height=666&width=1358)\n\nPaperchain has now been at this for awhile - first announcing their plans to leverage NFTs and DeFi [publicly in 2019 in a partnership with Centrifuge](https://medium.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-tinlake-and-paperchain-join-forces-to-accelerate-music-streaming-revenues-c83324d116e7).\n\nHow it works: Paperchain provides the data from a music distributor, gives a market rate for the per stream of the individual artist, and use Centrifuge’s Tinlake to mint DAI that could be paid to the artist the same day the streams happened.\n\n> Paperchain is leveraging a unique combination of NFTs x DeFi to unlock the creator economy with a web3 layer that makes content interoperable with digital assets and community monetization models.\n\n**This solves a bigger problem: On-chain music royalties**\n\nLast week Paperchain [announced that they are now available to select United Masters customers](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/unitedmasters-advances-real-time-royalty-payments-beatbread-paperchain-1213546/), now making a crypto wallet available with an incumbent music distributor.\n\nPaperchain is now an App + Debit Card that creators can use to access daily partners, and is partnering with music distributors to help them pay their artists daily. More significantly, they are moving towards giving artists a wallet to interact with crypto. You can use the debit card to spend your DAI at the store, sure, but maybe in the future you could also use the app to buy NFTs or Social Tokens of another artist.\n\n![Paperchain app](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/48b241e0-e289-4bac-ad47-46b80e34f3dd.png?height=1400&width=1210)\n\nThis is all part of a grander vision for Dan Dewar, CEO of Paperchain. He notes that royalty payments may not add up to much today but aggregating them in one place will lead to wealth accumulation. Dan also noted that Paperchain surveyed users for new features and that they found that artists were more interested in buying crypto with their streaming payments as opposed to things like cash back rewards with the card.\n\nGiving artists the tools to bring their work into parity with the payments they receive for that work has been a large value proposition of web3. The problem has been that payments have not been on-chain and artists didn’t have identity on-chain. Paperchain has now augmented legacy payment systems to realize on-chain royalty payments for music - in a way that bridges legacy media to web3 layers. When music can be distributed to Spotify + all other DSPs and those royalties can be brought on-chain - artists can then explore ways to give value back to their fans in more novel ways. Royalties from streaming can flow to NFTs, social token holders, early followers, and anyone who has a record of interacting with that artist on-chain.\n\n**Paperchain can expedite streaming payments for artists now but I think that will be one of the smaller achievements in comparison to what else they have unlocked in the process.**\n\n*Special thanks to Dan Dewar for helping make this piece happen.

A who’s who of Hollywood stars, musicians, and movie executives watch live as the man they call “Magic” is knocked off the proverbial pedestal. Millions more stare at their TVs in awe.\n\nMichael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls just defeated Magic Johnson’s L.A. Lakers to win the NBA championship. The first of six titles for the man better known as “Air Jordan”. Basketball is on the precipice of becoming a global phenomenon, and the NBA is on its way to eventually [earning $8.76 billion in annual revenue.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/071415/how-nba-makes-money.asp)\n\nYet, 100 years earlier, basketball was just an idea.\n\nIn 1891, [Dr. James Naismith](https://www.biography.com/scholar/james-a-naismith) was a P.E. instructor at the local YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts. One day, he was asked to create an indoor sport to keep athletes in shape during the frigid winter months. With a set of 13 rules, two peach baskets as goals, and a ball with twine lace stretched across the inseams, the game we know today as basketball was born.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/10f0a2ca-5e57-4522-89c3-0519f3fb1458.png?height=1620&width=2880)\n\n> I am sure that no man can derive more pleasure from money or power than I do from seeing a pair of basketball goals in some out of the way place.\n>\n> \\- Dr. James Naismith\n\nThe game of basketball has always been predicated on groups of self-organizing squads coming together to participate. As the years went on, the popularity of the game grew and participation quickly found its lifelong partner, fandom. Now watched by billions of people all over the globe, basketball has quickly become one of the most beloved games in the world.\n\nFandom, whether manifested from players or teams, gives a sense of belonging that’s seldom seen in day-to-day life. To be a fan is to be part of something larger. To feel belonging to a community that shares a common identity. To ride the [rollercoaster of ups and downs](https://www.youtube.com/embed/jNAeoNDsG30), all while staying dedicated to the cause. To be a fan is to love.\n\nAlthough, there's a part of the game that's been missing amongst fans since it’s inception. A level of integration we could share as fans that even Dr. Naismith couldn't have predicted. Ownership.\n\nBefore we dive into who we are and the mission we set to achieve, it's important to define what ownership means. Is ownership merely symbolism for more influence? A state of possession? Means of authority?\n\nAs we usher in a new era of new institutions and collective commons, ownership will take on a new meaning. We’ve seen the internet transition over the decades from read, to read-write, and now read-write-execute. This makes the internet a place not only for transactions, but for connection, thought, and programmable democracy. Agreements can now be automated on the application and organizational level, where the players can define business logic and behavioral rulesets for all participants. For all intents and purposes, products and organizations can be owned by the players that built them.\n\nIf Web 2.0 was defined as the frontend revolution, Web 3.0 is the execution revolution. Squads, up until now, have been dependent on centralized monoliths for communication, participation, and transactions.  The atomic unit of the internet is the individual, yet corporations hold majority of the power.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4b257805-3378-4878-8cc8-af46de03c9ef.jpeg?height=433&width=628)\n\nWeb 3.0 fundamentally changes that…\n\n* What does a group chat bank account or cap table look like?\n* What kind of superpowers does a native squad currency unlock?\n* How can collectives come together to glean upside, reciprocity, and socialized risk?\n* How can online teams band together to do the unimaginable?\n\n## \\* Krause House has entered the chat \\*\n\n[The Krause House](https://krausehouse.club/) is a community of hoop fanatics that are *just* crazy enough to buy an NBA team. To our members, being a fan isn’t enough. This is a squad made of wet jumpers and saucy crossovers that refuse to sit on the sidelines.\n\nTeam ownership shouldn’t be limited to a handful of billionaires, but rather a movement of individuals that want to be a part of the greatest professional league in the world. Fans breed life to the organizations in which they attach, so isn't it reasonable to accept a shared portion of the ownership and upside? We don't think it's merely acceptable, but mandatory.\n\nThe Krause House is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governed by the community, the fans, the basketball lovers and purists. Together we will write the consensus rules that will bring the first fan-governed team to the game as first participants, then fans, and now owners. The collective of ambitious contributors whose goal is to own an NBA team describes the underlying mission of DAOs in its purest form: *Difficult by one, achievable by many*.\n\nWe will allow our members to participate in decisions affecting the operating procedures of a National Basketball Association (NBA) team including but not limited to ticketing, merchandising, partnerships, and general management of players and coaches.\n\nAs a DAO, we embrace the label of an online cooperative with open arms. We champion evolving organizational mechanics and practices from that of traditional hierarchies.  We prioritize ownership and autonomy. We value culture over structure. As the membership grows, so does the interdependence. Building confidence brought forth by the consistency of socialization and self-actualization. Put simply, we’re a tribe with a vibe.\n\n## Who’s got next?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8248a5f8-54a7-42eb-a4a7-4ea921784db8.jpeg?height=500&width=956)\n\nIn the weeks to come, Krause House will launch its inaugural Season 1. We’re scouting contributors who want to actively participate in our mission to own and operate an NBA team as a DAO. All skill sets and skill levels are welcome.\n\nWe believe championship teams are defined by the role players. The first ones in the gym, but the last to leave. Ones who celebrate making free throws as much as breaking ankles. Ones who think in terms of we, not me.\n\nWe’re looking for [The Mamba Mentality.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gi9y3sTrXE)\n\nTo be the world’s first fan-owned and operated NBA team is no small feat.

Write and share a thread on Twitter explaining who you are and what you'd do with a month at the cabins\n2. Tag [@creatorcabins](https://twitter.com/creatorcabins) #Cohort3 in the first tweet\n3. Confirm that you are: vaccinated against COVID-19, able to attend for the entire duration of the cohort, and able to focus full-time on the residency program\n\nWe’ll gather these threads and coordinate a vote among our members to determine the four creators to be selected for the cohort. Voting will open for $CABIN holders from September 1st - September 2nd, at which time the four proposals with the most votes will be selected to participate in the cohort.\n\n## What to Include in Your Proposal\n\nUse this as an opportunity to be creative. It would be good to introduce yourself to the community and share some of your past work. We would also love to see some rough, initial thoughts on how you would like to spend the time in Texas. You don’t need to provide a fully fleshed-out plan. Just the kernel of a promising idea that’s been bouncing around your head.\n\nA good proposal will include:\n\n* An introduction to who you are and what you do\n* Some past work samples\n* An idea for how you’d like to spend your time while at the cabins\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ZFleischmann/status/1405588160365596680\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mnirPRJCTS/status/1405620335253278720\n\n## The Cohort\n\nIf your proposal is accepted, you’ll receive a free 1-month stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) in the Hill Country of Texas outside Austin (valued at $2,800). You will have your own private bedroom, bathroom, and workspace in the [Residency Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/cabins), with access to a communal workspace, living room, dining room, and kitchen. The cabins also have a fire pit, floating pool, and 28 acres to roam around on.\n\nA Camp Counselor will be there to coordinate the logistics of your stay, including getting to the cabins from the airport, group outings, and grocery runs.\n\n**Most importantly, you’ll have one month of uninterrupted time to bring a project into the world.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/422c55ba-cf7e-4f48-a33f-f20f3aa011e5.jpg?height=2400&width=3600)\n\n## FAQs\n\n### What is Creator Cabins?\n\n[Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) is an online and IRL community committed to helping independent online creators. We operate a residency program run by a [DAO (decentralized autonomous organization)](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw).\n\nThe DAO brought together people from across the internet to fund [12 month-long residencies for creators](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ). We have an active [token-gated discord community](https://discord.gg/N6hVmFygjR) and bring people together IRL at the Creator Cabins location in the Texas Hill Country outside of Austin, TX:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\n\n### What are the requirements to apply?\n\nWe ask that all residents be:\n\n1. Vaccinated against COVID-19\n2. Able to attend for the entire duration of the cohort\n3. Able to focus full-time on the residency program\n4. At least 18 years old\n\nBeyond that, the program is open to anyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, writers, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders, and more.\n\nIf you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n### What skills are we looking for?\n\nCreativity, collaboration, dedication, and diversity. We love the idea of bringing people from wildly different backgrounds together and seeing what happens. What will the conversation be like around the firepit? How will people end up collaborating and supporting each other?\n\n### How do I know I should apply?\n\nThe little voice inside of you telling you your idea is great and you can do it. Believe that voice. Channel it into a Twitter thread for a chance to spend a month working on that project you’ve been itching to build.\n\n### What’s included?\n\nThe residency program includes the following:\n\n* A free, 1-month stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) (valued at $2,800) with your own private bedroom, bathroom, and workspace\n* A 0.25 ETH (or equivalent USDC) stipend for food and other essentials\n* Access to a Camp Counselor to coordinate logistics of your trip\n* One month of uninterrupted time to create with a community of collaborators to support you\n* Your own $CABIN tokens and membership in the CabinDAO community\n\n### Can I work on other work (e.g. remote work) while I’m there?\n\nThe goal of this residency program is to unlock the time and space to work on projects you wouldn’t otherwise be able to focus on. We want to support people who will be spending most of their time focused on these projects. While we understand that people may have other commitments, if you aren’t able to dedicate a month to independent creative work, this program is probably not the right fit. We trust the members of this community to use their best judgment based on the goal of this program.\n\n### When will I know if I was selected?\n\nVoting will close on September 2nd, at which point we will reach out on Twitter and/or via email to make sure you meet the requirements and can accept the residency.\n\n### Is this just for US citizens?\n\nNo, this is open to anyone who can travel to the US and will be vaccinated at the start of the program.\n\n### Do I have to submit on Twitter?\n\nWe would prefer applications to be submitted through Twitter so that the broader community can provide feedback.

{"id": "cUAIv1GhWP2DQlDd8Zazpu3QH48o3AYt3V0OkHHuQ5o", "title": "The Fat CryptoPunks Thesis", "body": "\\*This essay appears as it was originally published in February 2021 with minor edits\n\nAs the non-fungible token (NFT) universe grows — both on Ethereum and across different blockchains — I think CryptoPunks will capture more value than any other set of digital art or collectibles. Before I explore why I think this is the case let’s define some terms.\n\nNon-fungible tokens are a type of crypto asset that represent unique (or “non-fungible”) digital goods like pieces of art or video game items. As with Bitcoin or Ether, these crypto-assets are held in a non-custodial and censorship resistant manner where proof of ownership exists on public blockchains.\n\nCryptoPunks are a set of 10,000 digital characters that have a variety of attributes with different levels of rarity based on their type (alien, ape, zombie) and attributes like tiaras, luxurious beards, hoodies, and so on. As one of the original NFT collectibles, punks were a seminal step in the development of the ERC-721 standard, which is the “file type” most NFT projects use today.\n\n![CryptoPunk 8348](https://miro.medium.com/max/1248/1\\*c8thAfkcYI4Y-aXE2QhEew.png)\n\nInitially, it may seem crazy that there are people willing to pay big money for what critics say are just PNG files of pixel art. If someone likes one of these punks, can’t they just right click and save the image? While I understand people who hold this view, it misses some important nuance around how art is valued. Let’s consider “real” art for a minute as a comparison.\n\nPaintings by Vincent van Gogh are expensive and many of his pieces have sold for millions of dollars over the past decade. At the same time, I grew up with a printed copy of one of van Gogh’s Sunflowers hanging above my kitchen table… and even though *I* think it’s beautiful, I wouldn’t be able to sell it. It’s worthless, it’s a print.\n\nWhat this shows is fine art has value — at least financially speaking — based on verifiable ownership of an original, not because of aesthetic beauty alone. If someone owns an original work by a famous artist, they gain a level of status. Wealthy people store value in fine art based on the assumption that this will hold true. That status persists. This is in part why so much art sits in freeports around the world and gets traded without the owners ever bothering to go see the pieces in person.\n\n![Side-by-side copies of Sunflowers, Fourth Version, Vincent van Gogh, 1888](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4eccbe08-e960-492e-9687-3c57b66163b2.png?height=404&width=642)\n\nOk, back to CryptoPunks. What is novel about CryptoPunks is they are among the first pieces of digital art on Ethereum that have a built in means of verifying unique ownership. This is done through cryptographic hashing such that a wallet address on Ethereum can have ownership rights over a CryptoPunk in a secure manner. As people have caught on to this, there has been a surge of interest in buying punks. In the last quarter of 2020 and the first few months of 2021 there have been tens of millions of dollars in sales volume surrounding CryptoPunks and a few purchases of over one million dollars each for the rarest ones. See below for a visual of the price action over the past three months from nonfungible.com:\n\n![CryptoPunk trading data from nonfungible.com](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*aKyoylvmGHXsN7ZA)\n\nSeveral people have laid out investment theses around why punks will hold value over time. A good one to read if you’re interested in exploring this further can be found [here](https://punk.substack.com/p/cryptopunks-digital-collectibles). To me, the value proposition comes down to two things. Punks as a store of value and punks as a reflexive asset with a great narrative. On the store of value side, there are only 10,000 punks and with all the new money in crypto there aren’t enough to go around. It’s a supply-side crisis. On the narrative side, punks have a great story: they had a fair launch so anyone could claim them for free back in the day, the founders behind the project are brilliant, they’re the rookie card of NFTs, etc.\n\nWhile some people see the current run up in punk prices as a bubble — and it may be, in part — I see it more as the repricing of an asset that many people (myself included) missed for a long time. Further, I expect to see the market cap of punks combined continue to grow significantly in the next five years, potentially even in proportion to the size of the NFT market as a whole.\n\nHere’s the theory: NFTs will be massive for the digital art and collectibles category. There will be billions of them. As this growth happens, certain NFTs will capture a majority of the value and punks are a good candidate to capture that value because capital will flow into them from *both* large and small investors.\n\nLet’s look at small collectors first. As new people come into the crypto space they tend to want to collect what is already valuable… and there’s nothing more valuable than punks: they’re persistent, they have a great community, they are used by important people as Twitter and Discord profile pictures, and so on.\n\nWhile punks are too pricey for everyday collectors — the lowest one on offer at the time of writing is $26,000 or 13.5 ETH — projects like NFTX and Niftex have made it possible for smallholders to participate. Both of those protocols use different mechanics to allow people to own a small portion of a punk, either through a set of index funds backed by real punks (NFTX) or fractional ownership of a single punk (Niftex). Together, these protocols allow ownership of punks to disperse in a way that’s never been true of any high-end collectible category. And there are liquid secondary markets for these tokens too.\n\nWhile value will pour into punks from normal collectors, wealthy NFT collectors will cause a surge in punk market cap as well. When I think of wealthy NFT collectors, I break them into two categories. There’s non-crypto money and crypto-native money.\n\nThe wealthy new investors will come into NFTs from outside crypto and want what is the most highly valued asset. Punks. For example, last week I was in the CryptoPunks Discord, which has a bot that reports on recent punk sales, and I saw a new Ethereum wallet drop a million dollars on a dozen punks in a single hour. How many people can do that before the prices go bananas?\n\nThen there’s the crypto-native people who denominate a portion of their net worth in punks. What does that even mean? In the same way that a lot of people who are OGs in Bitcoin play with and trade altcoins then take those gains back into Bitcoin… OG NFT collectors dabble in other NFT projects and when they make money there, they often take those gains back to punks as their numéraire (by buying more or rarer punks with that capital). As the NFT category expands, these people will be taking more and more profit back into punks.

{"id": "RTBS6Ry8Wcjj-y3Lb8PupQLeXQJPmcNWMgjvv9DnHFw", "title": "Programmable Collateral: Bringing Music Royalties On-Chain", "body": "The exciting ways to use Ethereum stretch far beyond financial applications - as NFTs are currently showing, but a less-than-sexy area of music, royalties, are already being paid faster and more efficiently today using DeFi and NFTs.\n\nPaperchain is a company that was formed in 2017 and founded by Dan Dewar. After riding through the rise and fall of the 2017-2018 period in crypto they had landed on a strong value proposition: *collateralize streaming data for an artist on Spotify and use that to create synthetic assets on-chain that can be immediately paid to the artist.*\n\n**This solved a big problem: slow royalty payments**\n\nSpotify is well known for not producing much income in the way of royalties for artists. What it is not as well known for is how slow those royalty payments can be - sometimes taking as much as 75 days. That is slow, but other sources are even slower. Paperchain recognized this as an issue DeFi was uniquely positioned to solve.\n\nWhat if NFTs weren’t just collectibles or art or token gates? What if NFTs could be programmable collateral?\n\n![High-level diagram of how Paperchain uses NFTs, Tinlake, and DAI for providing immediate royalties on Ethereum.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e3b21906-182b-4a4a-b0fd-2107c345abc8.png?height=666&width=1358)\n\nPaperchain has now been at this for awhile - first announcing their plans to leverage NFTs and DeFi [publicly in 2019 in a partnership with Centrifuge](https://medium.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-tinlake-and-paperchain-join-forces-to-accelerate-music-streaming-revenues-c83324d116e7).\n\nHow it works: Paperchain provides the data from a music distributor, gives a market rate for the per stream of the individual artist, and use Centrifuge’s Tinlake to mint DAI that could be paid to the artist the same day the streams happened.\n\n> Paperchain is leveraging a unique combination of NFTs x DeFi to unlock the creator economy with a web3 layer that makes content interoperable with digital assets and community monetization models.\n\n**This solves a bigger problem: On-chain music royalties**\n\nLast week Paperchain [announced that they are now available to select United Masters customers](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/unitedmasters-advances-real-time-royalty-payments-beatbread-paperchain-1213546/), now making a crypto wallet available with an incumbent music distributor.\n\nPaperchain is now an App + Debit Card that creators can use to access daily partners, and is partnering with music distributors to help them pay their artists daily. More significantly, they are moving towards giving artists a wallet to interact with crypto. You can use the debit card to spend your DAI at the store, sure, but maybe in the future you could also use the app to buy NFTs or Social Tokens of another artist.\n\n![Paperchain app](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/48b241e0-e289-4bac-ad47-46b80e34f3dd.png?height=1400&width=1210)\n\nThis is all part of a grander vision for Dan Dewar, CEO of Paperchain. He notes that royalty payments may not add up to much today but aggregating them in one place will lead to wealth accumulation. Dan also noted that Paperchain surveyed users for new features and that they found that artists were more interested in buying crypto with their streaming payments as opposed to things like cash back rewards with the card.\n\nGiving artists the tools to bring their work into parity with the payments they receive for that work has been a large value proposition of web3. The problem has been that payments have not been on-chain and artists didn’t have identity on-chain. Paperchain has now augmented legacy payment systems to realize on-chain royalty payments for music - in a way that bridges legacy media to web3 layers.  \\n  \\n When music can be distributed to Spotify + all other DSPs and those royalties can be brought on-chain - artists can then explore ways to give value back to their fans in more novel ways. Royalties from streaming can flow to NFTs, social token holders, early followers, and anyone who has a record of interacting with that artist on-chain.\n\n**Paperchain can expedite streaming payments for artists now but I think that will be one of the smaller achievements in comparison to what else they have unlocked in the process.**\n\n*Special thanks to Dan Dewar for helping make this piece happen.

Before I explore why I think this is the case let’s define some terms.\n\nNon-fungible tokens are a type of crypto asset that represent unique (or “non-fungible”) digital goods like pieces of art or video game items. As with Bitcoin or Ether, these crypto-assets are held in a non-custodial and censorship resistant manner where proof of ownership exists on public blockchains.\n\nCryptoPunks are a set of 10,000 digital characters that have a variety of attributes with different levels of rarity based on their type (alien, ape, zombie) and attributes like tiaras, luxurious beards, hoodies, and so on. As one of the original NFT collectibles, punks were a seminal step in the development of the ERC-721 standard, which is the “file type” most NFT projects use today.\n\n![CryptoPunk 8348](https://miro.medium.com/max/1248/1\\*c8thAfkcYI4Y-aXE2QhEew.png)\n\nInitially, it may seem crazy that there are people willing to pay big money for what critics say are just PNG files of pixel art. If someone likes one of these punks, can’t they just right click and save the image? While I understand people who hold this view, it misses some important nuance around how art is valued. Let’s consider “real” art for a minute as a comparison.\n\nPaintings by Vincent van Gogh are expensive and many of his pieces have sold for millions of dollars over the past decade. At the same time, I grew up with a printed copy of one of van Gogh’s Sunflowers hanging above my kitchen table… and even though *I* think it’s beautiful, I wouldn’t be able to sell it. It’s worthless, it’s a print.\n\nWhat this shows is fine art has value — at least financially speaking — based on verifiable ownership of an original, not because of aesthetic beauty alone. If someone owns an original work by a famous artist, they gain a level of status. Wealthy people store value in fine art based on the assumption that this will hold true. That status persists. This is in part why so much art sits in freeports around the world and gets traded without the owners ever bothering to go see the pieces in person.\n\n![Side-by-side copies of Sunflowers, Fourth Version, Vincent van Gogh, 1888](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4eccbe08-e960-492e-9687-3c57b66163b2.png?height=404&width=642)\n\nOk, back to CryptoPunks. What is novel about CryptoPunks is they are among the first pieces of digital art on Ethereum that have a built in means of verifying unique ownership. This is done through cryptographic hashing such that a wallet address on Ethereum can have ownership rights over a CryptoPunk in a secure manner. As people have caught on to this, there has been a surge of interest in buying punks. In the last quarter of 2020 and the first few months of 2021 there have been tens of millions of dollars in sales volume surrounding CryptoPunks and a few purchases of over one million dollars each for the rarest ones. See below for a visual of the price action over the past three months from nonfungible.com:\n\n![CryptoPunk trading data from nonfungible.com](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*aKyoylvmGHXsN7ZA)\n\nSeveral people have laid out investment theses around why punks will hold value over time. A good one to read if you’re interested in exploring this further can be found [here](https://punk.substack.com/p/cryptopunks-digital-collectibles). To me, the value proposition comes down to two things. Punks as a store of value and punks as a reflexive asset with a great narrative. On the store of value side, there are only 10,000 punks and with all the new money in crypto there aren’t enough to go around. It’s a supply-side crisis. On the narrative side, punks have a great story: they had a fair launch so anyone could claim them for free back in the day, the founders behind the project are brilliant, they’re the rookie card of NFTs, etc.\n\nWhile some people see the current run up in punk prices as a bubble — and it may be, in part — I see it more as the repricing of an asset that many people (myself included) missed for a long time. Further, I expect to see the market cap of punks combined continue to grow significantly in the next five years, potentially even in proportion to the size of the NFT market as a whole.\n\nHere’s the theory: NFTs will be massive for the digital art and collectibles category. There will be billions of them. As this growth happens, certain NFTs will capture a majority of the value and punks are a good candidate to capture that value because capital will flow into them from *both* large and small investors.\n\nLet’s look at small collectors first. As new people come into the crypto space they tend to want to collect what is already valuable… and there’s nothing more valuable than punks: they’re persistent, they have a great community, they are used by important people as Twitter and Discord profile pictures, and so on.\n\nWhile punks are too pricey for everyday collectors — the lowest one on offer at the time of writing is $26,000 or 13.5 ETH — projects like NFTX and Niftex have made it possible for smallholders to participate. Both of those protocols use different mechanics to allow people to own a small portion of a punk, either through a set of index funds backed by real punks (NFTX) or fractional ownership of a single punk (Niftex). Together, these protocols allow ownership of punks to disperse in a way that’s never been true of any high-end collectible category. And there are liquid secondary markets for these tokens too.\n\nWhile value will pour into punks from normal collectors, wealthy NFT collectors will cause a surge in punk market cap as well. When I think of wealthy NFT collectors, I break them into two categories. There’s non-crypto money and crypto-native money.\n\nThe wealthy new investors will come into NFTs from outside crypto and want what is the most highly valued asset. Punks. For example, last week I was in the CryptoPunks Discord, which has a bot that reports on recent punk sales, and I saw a new Ethereum wallet drop a million dollars on a dozen punks in a single hour. How many people can do that before the prices go bananas?\n\nThen there’s the crypto-native people who denominate a portion of their net worth in punks. What does that even mean? In the same way that a lot of people who are OGs in Bitcoin play with and trade altcoins then take those gains back into Bitcoin… OG NFT collectors dabble in other NFT projects and when they make money there, they often take those gains back to punks as their numéraire (by buying more or rarer punks with that capital). As the NFT category expands, these people will be taking more and more profit back into punks. Again, punk numbers go up.\n\nUltimately then, with capital flowing in both from the bottom (everyday investors) and the top (high net worth people) punks will be bursting at the seams with value capture.

Earlier this week, we launched the [“Heavy is the HVND” crowdfund initiative](https://blvkhvnd.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930) to raise funds standup our HVND DAO and aggressively acquire assets of the most anticipated crypto-native trading card game [Parallel](https://parallel.life) before their card holding snapshot. **We could not have been more lit.** Within the first 1 minute we reached our funding goal of 100 ETH. Within hours, we eclipsed 200 ETH. In the final stretch, we ended with **337.75 ETH—a $1m seed round.**\n\nOur raise told us a few things, but the most glaring fact was the recognition that the gaming industry needs something different. Something that blends culture + gaming, something that equitably distributes value through competition, content creation, and career pathways that touch all areas of the gaming industry. They are betting on BLVKHVND’s success and we know that we’ll make it because of our community and partners like [Lemniscap](https://lemniscap.com/) whose impact in crypto and gaming is well established.\n\nAs we kick off our first season, we want to thank each and everyone of our backers, supporters, and fans looking forward to seeing our community grow. Nothing is done in a silo and we are forever grateful—we could not have written a better story.\n\n## Season 1 - Roadmap + Immediate Actions\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/02f32681-6e80-484f-aa47-6b05e82fc3b8.jpg?height=1001&width=2000&size=large)\n\n### August 2021\n\n**Parallel Asset Acquisition**\n\nImmediately after the crowdfund’s closing we went to work purchasing roughly 130 ETH of Parallel Assets to complete 4 Parasets to obtain Galaxy Keys before the set snapshot. Our treasury is now sitting on over a half a million in asset value. With the addition of the Galaxy Keys and new Rug Poll \\[SE\\] assets, we are squarely positioned to make an impact in the Parallel community.\n\n[https://zapper.fi/account/blvkhvnd.eth/nft](https://zapper.fi/account/blvkhvnd.eth/nft)\n\n> *Please note that Zapper.fi does not account for multiples, so for a more accurate account, we will release a spreadsheet in the coming days for a better look into our asset pool.

While we do not have an active crowdfund, on Sunday Aug 29, we will be dropping our “HVND OF ACCESS” NFT. This NFT is an edition of 200, available first come, first serve,  never to be minted again. Supporters will receive the NFT, access to our discord role *“The HVND”*, a reward of 100 $HVND tokens, and a special thanks for being an early supporter of BLVKHVND.\n\n> *Unfortunately we cannot recover any other NFTs that were lost during the crowdfund. As such, the ACCESS NFT will be airdropped to the 7 backers who did not receive a HVND OF AFFLUENCE.*\n\nFor those who did get NFTs from the crowdfund, we will mint and airdrop S*pecial Edition* versions of the claimed number of NFTs. We are excited to see all of our holders rock their favorite pieces. In due time, we will display a collection of our NFTs in a virtual gallery.\n\n**LP on Uniswap**\n\nOn August 31st, any participant in the crowdfund or purchases the ACCESS NFT on Sunday will be eligible to become a LIQUID HVND. Liquid Hvnds are liquidity providers that help give the token an open market to be bought, sold, traded amongst community members and speculators.\n\n### September 2021 — October 2021\n\n**Player Recruitment + Coaching Staff**\n\nTeams are more than just the *players*, good teams have coaches, analysts, and trainers at the highest competitive level. For us, serving casual, amateur, and pro-level players is no easy task, but one we are eager to tackle. Our focus will be recruiting for enthusiastic, coachable players that have the propensity to learn and experiment with their gameplay. Knowledge and experience of the game titles a player is interested in forming a team is important as is some level of competitive experience.\n\nWe will issue two signup forms in our discord on September 3rd for players and coaches with tryouts slated for September 15th.\n\n**The New BLVKHVND Web3 Setup**\n\nIn the coming weeks as we enter September, three bounties will be released: \n\n* Support for Stream Animations + Interactions\n* Support for BLVKHVND main site + auction house\n* Support for Intra-team Branding\n\nWe have many of the moving pieces to get us geared up for pushing consistent live and async content, but it’s not as fun if the HVND community doesn’t get involved. This is an opportunity to earn HVND by doing and putting your touch on what will be a global brand. More information will be released soon in our discord.\n\n**BLVKHVND Monster Mash Invitational**\n\nOur goal is to host our first tournament of the year and bring a mixture of crypto-native games like Axie Infinity to our community to discover and play with the communities they are apart of. We also want to test our newly formed dSports team and compete. More information related to this tournament will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n## LIQUID HVND: Introducing $HVND\n\n$HVND will launch on August 31st, 2021.\n\n**The [contract address](https://etherscan.io/token/0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930) of $HVND is 0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930**\n\nThe supply of $HVND is 1,350,620 tokens, with 337,655 in circulation from the initial crowdfund.\n\n*Please exercise extreme caution when interacting with this token and triple check that the contract address matches the one above. $HVND represents membership in the BLVKHVND gaming community and should not be regarded as an investment.*\n\nBelow lists everything you need to know about $HVND:\n\n* 100 $HVND is required for full membership into the BLVKHVND gaming community\n* Voting rights can be delegated to other community members, and 25-50% of a strategic partner or outside capital (VC, Angel, etc) is required to delegate to the broader community.\n* Governance is done through Snapshot and will employ delegation and quadratic voting toward proposals. Over time, we seek to refine our proposal process and develop key criteria to reach a sufficient quorum when voting occurs.\n* $HVND can be earned through active participation in events, bounties, and projects.\n* $HVND can be purchased through Uniswap or through specific NFT drops wherever specified.\n* $HVND will offer liquidity rewards for members who lend game assets to the Treasury for the community to use and play\n\n### $HVND Distribution\n\nAll $HVND tokens were minted through the Mirror Crowdfund Contract with 25% already distributed to the community and 75% withheld for further distribution.\n\nAt inception the DAO will be operated as a 2/3 Gnosis Safe Multisig operated by the BLVKHVND Staff and governed by the HVND community. The address to the multisig is: 0x4763cfa50311729B65815E5Ae9EbBefDB94EC112 (blvkhvnd.eth).\n\nThe initial signers of the sig are:\n\n* [Sirsu](https://twitter.com/sirsuhayb)\n* [ATM](https://twitter.com/dillonatm)\n* [Blvk0ut](https://twitter.com/blvk0ut0426)\n\nThe distribution of the remaining tokens is as follows:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7c917b78-2dcb-431f-b333-a5ae66b06b22.png?height=445&width=686)\n\n### Circulating — 40%\n\n$HVND held by members and receivers of any future airdrops. These tokens are fully liquid and free to be used by the community at their choosing.\n\n*Season 1 will feature an entry balance of 100 HVND.*\n\n### Community Treasury — 35%\n\n$HVND retained by the DAO to be used at the community’s discretion and distributed through governance proposals. There’s no vesting on the community treasury, meaning the entire allocation is available at launch at the discretion of HVND community governance.\n\nMore details on the future of HVND and how to make a proposal on Snapshot will be provided early next week.\n\n### Team — 15%\n\n$HVND retained by the staff, subject to a one year vesting with a 6 month cliff followed by monthly unlocks. These tokens are used as long-term incentives for existing staff, and includes an options pool for future contributors.\n\n### Strategic Partners — 5%\n\n$HVND given to strategic partners in the form of VC, Angel Investors, or other large contributors, subject to a one year cliff + 2 year linear release starting from end of year 1 followed by monthly unlocks. At the one year cliff,  25% of the allotted HVND will unlock, followed by 6.25% each quarter for the remaining two years. Participating firms will be asked to delegate \\~25-50% of their votes.\n\n### Liquid HVNDs — 5%\n\nBLVKHVND will launch a whitelisted HVND/ETH liquidity mining program on August 31st, open exclusively to HVND members who have been activated on Discord who participated in the crowdfund or purchased the HVND SEASON ONE NFT.\n\n5064\\.825 $HVND (0.5% of the total supply) will be allocated to the first month of liquid hvnds, and a detailed tutorial for members will be shared in the coming weeks.\n\n*Please exercise extreme caution when participating in liquidity provision as tokens can be highly volatile. We encourage anyone considering joining this program to read about impermanent loss and recognize that there are inherent risks to providing liquidity.*\n\nLiquid HVNDs is expected to run as an ongoing program, alongside a suite of other **community-based** distribution programs instituted for Seasons One and beyond.\n\nBelow shows the expectation of $HVND distributed over the course of the next 4 years.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f35c0a04-eace-463f-a20a-aaa952ed44da.png?height=507&width=905)\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nA follow up will be posted after $HVND tokens have been made available on Uniswap.\n\nWe want to ensure that there is a fair entry for new HVND members, and want to spend the coming weeks solidifying a foundation for sustainability for years to come. If you are eager to join us, we are happy to have you!\n\nIn the meantime, the HVND staff will be heads down working on a number of tools and tutorials to guide the community and set ourselves up for competition.\n\nBe on the lookout for a number of governance proposals to reward those who have help to bring $HVND to life, and to introduce a number of strategic partners to the fold like Lemniscap, which we are proud to announce their involvement with BLVKHVND as we strive to radically change esports, one HVND at a time!\n\n### Get Involved\n\nOur [Discord](https://community.blvkhvnd.com/) is open to all. With our upcoming crowdfund, we will create a token-permissioned ecosystem that add a new set of tools and channels for the community to participate in.\n\nOur [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blvkhvnd) will in conjunction with the Discord drop important announcements and info related to the BLVKHVND community.", "timestamp": 1630088641, "digest": "ZbaiH73szr-vD-ystrI4aW2Q52OhbLx5KHETEVS8VhM", "contributor": "0xEB95ff72EAb9e8D8fdb545FE15587AcCF410b42E"}

Today, we are excited to add Polygon network support for all users. \n\n**With Polygon, Dharma users can:**\n\n* **Buy thousands of tokens, directly from a US-bank account**\n* **Sell tokens for dollars in your bank account without leaving Polygon**\n* **Swap thousands of tokens with near-instant confirmation**\n* **Transfer tokens to other Polygon users around the globe**\n\n… all with zero\\* network fees.  No expensive Ethereum transactions or tricky cross-chain bridges to navigate — the barrier to entry is *gone*.\n\n\\*Dharma will cover network fees up to $0.50, which covers the *vast majority* of transactions on Polygon. Users will pay for transaction fees only if the network fee exceeds $0.50.\n\n\n---\n\nSince launching the Dharma mobile application in January 2020, the #1 piece of feedback we’ve gotten is “why are network fees so high?”. Initially, we attempted to address this feedback by subsidizing user transactions. But as DeFi Summer raged on, this practice became infeasible, and the volume of feedback increased. \n\n**No more. Today, users around the world can experience the magic of DeFi, through a beautiful and intuitive user experience, with zero network fees.** \n\nSo buy that DeFi token that you were priced out of because of network fees; trade daily and pay zero gas; pay your friends, family members, or business associated in crypto. And if you need to cash out to your bank account, you can do it directly from your Polygon wallet.  \n\nNo more shuffling money between Ethereum, Polygon, and your cryptocurrency exchange. It’s all possible now that Dharma is on Polygon.\n\n\n---\n\n## Buying Tokens from Your Bank Account on Polygon\n\nBuying and selling on Polygon is easy! Simply tap the network toggle at the top of your screen:\n\n\\[Insert screenshot\\]\n\nThen tap “Buy Crypto” at the bottom of your screen:\n\nSelect your bank account from the top-dropdown and the token you want to purchase from the bottom-dropdown:\n\nAnd then confirm your purchase:\n\n\\[insert screenshot\\]\n\n## Selling Tokens to Your Bank Account on Polygon\n\nSelling tokens is easy too! Select the token you want to sell from the top-dropdown and your bank account in the bottom-dropdown:\n\n\\[insert screenshot\\]\n\nConfirm your sale, and *voila*!\n\n\\[insert screenshot\\]** \\n **\n\nGive it a try today — it couldn’t be easier.\n\n** \\n  \\n **\n\n\\---\n\n** \\n **\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\n**Q: How are the network fees free? \\n **A: The Polygon network was built to support high-throughput, low-latency, low-fee transactions. As such, Dharma can submit the vast majority of transactions on Polygon for less than $0.10. With fees this low, we’re happy to cover the cost for you :)\n\n**Q: What fees does Dharma charge for buying / selling crypto on Polygon? \\n **A: For buying / selling crypto on Polygon, there is a minimum Dharma fee of $1.99. For trades larger than $400 the fee is 50bps and decreases with the size of your trade (eg. trading >$10,000 decreases your fee to 15bps).\n\n**Q: What tokens can I buy on Dharma’s Polygon wallet? \\n **A: You can buy any token on the top 30 decentralized exchanges on Polygon.\n\n**Q: Is my Polygon address the same as my Dharma address? \\n **A: Yes, your Polygon address should be the same as your Dharma address. If your addresses are not the same, please reach out to our support team ([support@dharma.io](mailto:support@dharma.io)), and we will rectify this for you. \n\n**Q: How do I send tokens from my Ethereum wallet to my Polygon Wallet? \\n **A: To move tokens from your Ethereum wallet to your Polygon wallet, you will need to use the Ethereum-Polygon Bridge. We recommend you proceed with extreme caution, and that you read our walkthrough here \\[insert link\\].\n\n** \\n **Have any more questions?  Come say hi on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5nhNjM2) — we promise we won’t bite :)\n\n \\n ", "timestamp": 1630088925, "digest": "1wryGNYs_SkLjR789eLOyu6CTqKDEzCS8mnE7_8gZdw", "contributor": "0x67e1b186e6dA49917922C040FD07bE1827978CE7"}

When a user mints an ERC-721 from the platform, a provably unique seed determines the variables in the generative script, ultimately defining the appearance of the output.\n\n  Since the beginning of this summer, daily volumes have skyrocketed, with \\~$25M in sales volume traded on Wednesday across Curated, Playground, and Factory series.\n\n![Dune Analytics - @rantum](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c336edd-8968-48e3-b978-c69cfb669bf9_2048x836.png)\n\n* The total count of wallet addresses that hold Art Blocks is similarly rising in an exponential fashion, with over 14,800 unique owners as of Wednesday. Over the last week alone, the project has seen an influx of more than 2000 new accounts that own a piece.\n\n![Dune Analytics - @rantum](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bd0592f-355d-4e4b-9d4c-7c11aab0c638_2048x892.png)\n\n* The table below displays the top 10 Art Blocks series ranked by all-time historical sales volume in ETH, with much of this volume originating over the last week. With the [Fidenza](https://artblocks.io/project/78) by Tyler Hobbs, for example, more than 86% of the \\~23,400 ETH all-time sales volume was traded within the last 7 days. If you take the average 3-day sale price for each series (a naive proxy) and multiply by edition size, you can back out a total estimated market cap for the full Art Blocks collection at \\~842,000 ETH or \\~$2.5B.\n\n![Dune Analytics - @rantum](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcedc4fdb-a403-4413-8cb7-7d8f5cbfe2c0_1346x766.png)\n\n* *Editor’s Note: Variant did an Art Blocks drop last year, which you can find [here](https://artblocks.io/project/5). I’d like to think we’ve been tracking this space before it was cool* 😏\n\n\n***\n\n## ② CryptoPunks\n\n**👥 [Elias Simos](https://twitter.com/eliasimos)**\n\n**📈 Punks continue to lead as NFTs explode higher**\n\n**👉 [Community Page](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)   🔎 [Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/eliasimos/cryptopunks-)**\n\n* If you don't know what CryptoPunks (CP hereon) are by now, you must have been living under a...rock?! The OG pfp NFT continues to explode higher, with a total of Ξ 365k of volume processed through the CP contract this year. The last Ξ 150K has come through in the past 40 days. This is a cool 24x in volume YTD and it's only August. Average tx price has followed suit, 6x-ing YTD and 26x-ing in the past year.\n\n![Dune Analytics — eliasimos](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60291545-edbf-4f21-8954-270017beaf7c_2256x1062.png)\n\n* One of the more interesting observations worth zooming in on, is the trend in total sales and unique buyers. Since Dec 2019, there is a consistent trend of hype-cycle waves around the CP contract that tops out every 5 months. Every cycle top sees more unique buyers come in than the one before it.\n\n![Dune Analytics](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb863bc0-95e7-496a-bd02-4b32dd71b47f_1698x716.png)\n\n* And now, for some alpha (maybe)! CPs have different attributes; some more numerous or rare, some less. Granted that for the lifetime of txs there is a loose +ve correlation (35%) between rarity and avg_tx_price, are Buck Teeth and Pink With Hat undervalued, or are they unloved because they...ugly?\n\n![Dune Analytics](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0db1d76-7859-4e06-9182-83a5eb1329b0_1954x1144.png)\n\n\n***\n\n## ③ Parallel\n\n**👥 [Kinjal Shah](https://twitter.com/_kinjalbshah)**\n\n**📈 Parallel, sci-fi trading game, has done \\~$100M GMV**\n\n**👉 [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/parallelalpha)  📌 [Job Board](http://parallel.life/)   🔎 [Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/rantum/NFT-Collection-Dashboard?contract_address=x76be3b62873462d2142405439777e971754e8e77)**\n\n* Parallel is a sci-fi trading card game that's a cross between Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering. The game has quickly become one of the most anticipated as the community builds out its sets in preparation for launch. Without doing any marketing, Parallel has done nearly $93M (31K ETH) in volume in the last 30 days across only 7K users.\n\n![Dapp Radar](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9234a2d7-77cc-409d-b443-edb0797a97b4_1176x444.png)\n\n* The first drop occurred in March, followed by one in July. The breakdown of cards ranges from 0.5 ETH to 0.025 ETH, however the prices have accelerated quickly. While the floor hovers around 0.17 ETH, the all-time-high sale went for 360 ETH.\n\n![Dune Analytics - @rantum](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9caf5bf9-cb9b-4801-94b3-179d3234e49d_1354x752.png)\n\n* The project has completed nearly 80K sales, with anticipation of the next card drop in October. The excitement for the game is rooted in the unique storyline, fantastic artwork, and the community support which has been rapidly growing.\n\n![Dune Analytics - @rantum](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb09b449e-b9b4-454e-9a20-a13fdb3cb9a7_970x374.png)\n\n\n***\n\n## ④ Pudgy Penguins\n\n**👥 [Guy Stewart](https://twitter.com/wholisticguy)**\n\n**📈 Pudgy Penguin NFTs returns 1000x in 10 days**\n\n**👉 [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/MHYSQd6JhF)   🔎 [Dashboar](https://dune.xyz/guystewart/Pudgy-Penguins-Degen-Dashboard)d**\n\n* Pudgy Penguins were the fastest 1000x project ( 0.003 ETH -> 3 ETH ) so far in the history of NFTs. There is currently limited native tools for NFT market analysis. To validate the authenticity of the movement, confirm my trading thesis, and better manage the risk while still capturing the fast moving opportunity, I created a Dune Analytics dashboard to track the most essential metrics. My key metrics were unique wallets/distribution, hourly floor price, moving average, and volume.\n\n![Dune Analytics](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5f6d915-1ea4-4a96-bb98-a579d2d03e63_2502x1886.jpeg)\n\n* Participants are influenced by viral memes and fear of missing out (FOMO), thus vulnerable to social influence and direct price manipulation. One key metric proving broad market appeal and resistance to dumping was the largest wallet size (less than 1%) and high ratio of unique address 4400:8888.\n\n![Nansen](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F729add92-109f-421d-a3ed-876d0469e973_2550x894.jpeg)\n\n* Illiquidity risk (to the point of no buyers) and thin floor price points (1-2 trades) can result in parabolic price movement, or inability to exit. I managed this by wrapping the unique non-fungible ERC-721 into fractional ERC-20 tokens with NFTx tools and staking a liquidity pool on SushiSwap.\n\n![SushiSwap.vision](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa65164e2-c730-4b7c-9aba-e74eacf3a1df_2064x1370.jpeg)\n\n\n***\n\n## ⑤ Deafbeef\n\n**👥 [RantumBits](https://twitter.com/RantumBits)**\n\n**📈 Deafbeef floor rises \\~800% to 100+ ETH in past month**\n\n**👉 [Community Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ZEWCVTpuPV)   🔎 [Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/rantum/NFT-Collection-Dashboard?contract_address=xd754937672300ae6708a51229112de4017810934)**\n\n* [Deafbeef](https://deafbeef.com/), a groundbreaking generative audio-visual art project consisting of 221 pieces, has seen a rise in floor price to over 100 ETH over the past month. After a first sale of 5 ETH shortly after the project's inception in March, the floor price steadily rose to \\~12 ETH in late July. Over the past 30 days, the floor price skyrocketed with 11 sales of over 100 ETH.\n\n![Dune Analytics — Rantum](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a75ffe2-a09b-4b8a-a91b-68c2a01022d7_951x409.png)\n\n* There are now 100 wallets holding a Deafbeef piece, and that number has mostly increased over time with few owners selling all Deafbeef pieces. Ownership of the collection is well-distributed, with the largest holding owning \\~8% of the collection.\n\n![Dune Analytics — Rantum](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb3027a2-7175-4440-a807-9eeae962c5af_1257x401.png)\n\n* Collectors of this project also hold NFTs from projects like Cryptopunks and ArtBlocks, as well as from the Foundation, SuperRare, and ArtBlocks.

Something that blends culture + gaming, something that equitably distributes value through competition, content creation, and career pathways that touch all areas of the gaming industry. They are betting on BLVKHVND’s success and we know that we’ll make it because of our community and partners like [Lemniscap](https://lemniscap.com/) whose impact in crypto and gaming is well established.\n\nAs we kick off our first season, we want to thank each and everyone of our backers, supporters, and fans looking forward to seeing our community grow. Nothing is done in a silo and we are forever grateful—we could not have written a better story.\n\n## Season 1 - Roadmap + Immediate Actions\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/02f32681-6e80-484f-aa47-6b05e82fc3b8.jpg?height=1001&width=2000&&size=large)\n\n### August 2021\n\n**Parallel Asset Acquisition**\n\nImmediately after the crowdfund’s closing we went to work purchasing roughly 130 ETH of Parallel Assets to complete 4 Parasets to obtain Galaxy Keys before the set snapshot. Our treasury is now sitting on over a half a million in asset value. With the addition of the Galaxy Keys and new Rug Poll \\[SE\\] assets, we are squarely positioned to make an impact in the Parallel community.\n\n[https://zapper.fi/account/blvkhvnd.eth/nft](https://zapper.fi/account/blvkhvnd.eth/nft)\n\n> *Please note that Zapper.fi does not account for multiples, so for a more accurate account, we will release a spreadsheet in the coming days for a better look into our asset pool. We are also still receiving Parallel Assets from HVND holders. To view all assets currently owned, check out our [OpenSea Account.](https://opensea.io/0x4763cfa50311729b65815e5ae9ebbefdb94ec112)*\n\n**1/1 NFT For Patron Winners**\n\nOn Sunday Aug 29, we will distribute the NFTs for the Patron Winners. These NFTs were minted on Zora from our BLVKHVND proxy address (the same address that created this mirror publication). We will also like to take this opportunity to reveal that the largest contribution was made by [Lemniscap](https://lemniscap.com/), a forward looking venture fund, and we are proud to have their support. We are excited and welcome their involvement with BLVKHVND as we strive to radically change esports, one HVND at a time!\n\n**NFT Drop**\n\nWe’ve gotten such a positive response to the crowdfund that more of you want in! While we do not have an active crowdfund, on Sunday Aug 29, we will be dropping our “HVND OF ACCESS” NFT. This NFT is an edition of 200, available first come, first serve,  never to be minted again. Supporters will receive the NFT, access to our discord role *“The HVND”*, a reward of 100 $HVND tokens, and a special thanks for being an early supporter of BLVKHVND.\n\n> *Unfortunately we cannot recover any other NFTs that were lost during the crowdfund. As such, the ACCESS NFT will be airdropped to the 7 backers who did not receive a HVND OF AFFLUENCE.*\n\nFor those who did get NFTs from the crowdfund, we will mint and airdrop S*pecial Edition* versions of the claimed number of NFTs. We are excited to see all of our holders rock their favorite pieces. In due time, we will display a collection of our NFTs in a virtual gallery.\n\n**LP on Uniswap**\n\nOn August 31st, any participant in the crowdfund or purchases the ACCESS NFT on Sunday will be eligible to become a LIQUID HVND. Liquid Hvnds are liquidity providers that help give the token an open market to be bought, sold, traded amongst community members and speculators.\n\n### September 2021 — October 2021\n\n**Player Recruitment + Coaching Staff**\n\nTeams are more than just the *players*, good teams have coaches, analysts, and trainers at the highest competitive level. For us, serving casual, amateur, and pro-level players is no easy task, but one we are eager to tackle. Our focus will be recruiting for enthusiastic, coachable players that have the propensity to learn and experiment with their gameplay. Knowledge and experience of the game titles a player is interested in forming a team is important as is some level of competitive experience.\n\nWe will issue two signup forms in our discord on September 3rd for players and coaches with tryouts slated for September 15th.\n\n**The New BLVKHVND Web3 Setup**\n\nIn the coming weeks as we enter September, three bounties will be released:\n\n* Support for Stream Animations + Interactions\n* Support for BLVKHVND main site + auction house\n* Support for Intra-team Branding\n\nWe have many of the moving pieces to get us geared up for pushing consistent live and async content, but it’s not as fun if the HVND community doesn’t get involved. This is an opportunity to earn HVND by doing and putting your touch on what will be a global brand. More information will be released soon in our discord.\n\n**BLVKHVND Monster Mash Invitational**\n\nOur goal is to host our first tournament of the year and bring a mixture of crypto-native games like Axie Infinity to our community to discover and play with the communities they are apart of. We also want to test our newly formed dSports team and compete. More information related to this tournament will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n## LIQUID HVND: Introducing $HVND\n\n$HVND will launch on August 31st, 2021.\n\n**The [contract address](https://etherscan.io/token/0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930) of $HVND is 0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930**\n\nThe supply of $HVND is 1,350,620 tokens, with 337,655 in circulation from the initial crowdfund.\n\n*Please exercise extreme caution when interacting with this token and triple check that the contract address matches the one above. $HVND represents membership in the BLVKHVND gaming community and should not be regarded as an investment.*\n\nBelow lists everything you need to know about $HVND:\n\n* 100 $HVND is required for full membership into the BLVKHVND gaming community\n* Voting rights can be delegated to other community members, and 25-50% of a strategic partner or outside capital (VC, Angel, etc) is required to delegate to the broader community.\n* Governance is done through Snapshot and will employ delegation and quadratic voting toward proposals.

{"id": "KrXZY5zvAJkKOIzochTQulbxgwAhK_Ayw8UXIUQGnCc", "title": "The Future of DAO Law: Building Beyond the States", "body": "*Three key aspects could shape the regulatory landscape of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): recognition of legal personhood to a purely digital entity, granting limited liability to its members and establishing a pass-through status with regard to taxation. This methodological approach could foster innovation in governance and also avoid obstacles with respect to technological developments.*\n\n![@Abstrucked](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/db091ddb-edee-4e59-9b3b-ce9a7f808759.jpg?height=576&width=1152)\n\n### DAOs are all around us\n\nThe number and size of digital organizations in which members work together in sharing common missions and values is [growing](https://consensys.net/blog/codefi/daos/). DAOs are testing innovative technological tools and developing best practices to coordinate efforts in the digital environment. [DAOs can be categorized](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw) according to their specific activities, as for instance investing, protocol, social, service, media, etc. Contributing to a DAO is becoming the ultimate frontier for working opportunities inside of the crypto industry. Such organizations seem able to shape the [future of work](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-future-of-work).\n\nRegulatory risks and the potential liability of contributors are a looming shadow which in the long run may hinder, if not stop, innovation. There are many reasons for which DAOs are not corporations in a traditional sense:\n\n* They are not settled in a given jurisdiction and are potentially able to involve thousands of members all over the world\n* Their inner organizational structure does not necessarily resemble a traditional company\n* They are usually composed of different teams, which coordinate their activities based on incentives and fluid consensus mechanisms\n* Their lack of legal personhood (as a purely digital organization) makes simple legal questions concerning liability for a failure of a service or taxation duties difficult to answer\n\nIn this framework, the **Coalition of Automated Legal Applications (COALA)**, which describes itself as a global, multidisciplinary blockchain research and development initiative, has drafted a [model legislation](https://coala.global/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DAO-Model-Law.pdf) for governments to recognize DAOs as legal persons.\n\n[https://twitter.com/coalaglobal/status/1405918673433513986?s=20](https://twitter.com/coalaglobal/status/1405918673433513986?s=20)\n\nAccording to the drafters, principles encompassed in the model law may serve as a basis for a future international convention. Currently the aim seems overambitious, because only a very limited number of states have tackled regulatory problems concerning DAOs. Nevertheless, the draft relies on an important assumption, which makes it different from other proposed DAO legislation: A digital entity could be recognized as a legal entity. This differs from the legislation in the [Wyoming bill](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/93800/wyoming-law-dao-registration), which requires an LLC be tied to an “agent” in a physical location. Three aspects in this model law deserve particular attention.\n\n### 1. No legal wrapper\n\nThe “classical” way of addressing DAO legal issues is to set up a legal wrapper that rolls up members of the organization to create a liability shield. In particular, the DAOs dealing with financial investments have tested the [legal framework of the LLC](https://medium.com/lexdaoism/ricardian-llc-limited-liability-nft-f64a162f751b).\n\nThe solution has some drawbacks as the DAO loses parts of its more distinctive features. The DAO ceases to be a pure decentralized organization to become a traditional legal entity, ascribable to one particular State. This is particularly evident in looking at the content of the straightforward Wyoming bill, according to which “*A decentralized autonomous organization is a limited liability company whose articles of organization contain a statement that the company is a decentralized autonomous organization*”. In addition, the bill states that “*The secretary of state shall not issue a certificate of authority for a foreign decentralized autonomous organization*”. This separation between a local DAO and a foreign DAO simply does not exist on the blockchain.\n\n![@Perchy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a6556f93-ecae-4d31-ba5d-44b780bb59d5.webp?height=667&width=1000)\n\nCOALA model law offers a different solution. **The DAO does not have a registered office in the off-chain world.** The so-called legal representatives provide for relationships with the non-digital world. The DAO appoints them in order to “undertake tasks that cannot be achieved On-Chain” (Art. 14). The authorization to act on behalf of the DAO should be verifiable by cryptographic proof and a simultaneous post in the public forum. In not requiring a legal wrapper, the provision clearly shows the willingness to treat DAOs as something different from traditional companies. In particular, it does not challenge the decentralized nature of the organization. According to the model law, DAOs only live on permissionless blockchains, whereas legal representatives are just needed for relationships in the off-chain world.\n\n### 2. Limited liability\n\nIn the U.S., the main threat for DAO members are the general partnership legal rules that could make contributors [personally liable]() for debts incurred by the DAO, if the latter is not able to repay creditors. Thus, the LLC is often considered a viable solution to limit members’ liability, as the abovementioned wrapper should work as a shield to guard the members’ personal assets.\n\nAlso in the field of liability the COALA model law follows consistently a different path **in directly recognizing limited liability to DAO members** (without the need of a “legal wrapper”).\n\nAccording to Art. 5(1), “*Members will only be responsible for providing the On-Chain Contributions that they have committed to the DAO, as required by the By-Laws. If the DAO exhausts its Assets, the Members will not be liable for excess liability*”.\n\nArt. 5(2) further clarifies that “*Members will not be held liable for any obligations incurred by the DAO, including, but not limited to, labor and tax obligations*”.\n\nBut the model law also provides two somewhat uncertain situations in which the limitation of liability does not operate:\n\n* Art. 5(3) establishes that if “*the DAO refuses to comply with an enforceable judgment, order or award entered against it, the Members who voted against compliance will be liable for any monetary payments ordered in the judgment, order or award in proportion to their share of governance rights in the DAO*”.\n\n  It is questionable whether the provision contains a workable solution, as it assumes a voting on the compliance issue. It's not inherently true that any particular DAO member would have voted. Some don't. Plus, if they voted to abstain, it's unclear if that kind of vote involves liability.\n* Pursuant to Art. 5(4) the limitation of liability does not affect the personal liability of a member in tort for their own wrongful act or omission. The same provision further indicates that a member cannot be personally liable for the wrongful act or omission of any other member of the DAO.\n\n  The scope of the liability in tort is not clear. For instance, what happens if due to the mistake of a developer the funds of a liquidity provider get lost? The wise answer seems not to consider the developer personally liable.\n\nThe COALA model law demonstrates awareness that liability is a sensitive topic, which is a critical step forward for DAO-related legal issues, and also that people whom enter into relationships with DAOs deserve protection. The concerns regarding “abuses of limited liability” are addressed by suggesting the introduction of a requirement for members to make a financial contribution to a reserve fund or towards the premiums of an appropriate insurance policy for the benefit of limited liability. From a different perspective, the model law does not apply a minimum capital requirement to the DAO. Currently, it seems difficult to frame an insurance scheme able to cover the activity of a DAO exposed to hacks and others program-related risks of losses. In some cases the only guarantee for creditors would be the funds in the treasury.\n\n### 3. Taxation\n\nThe last point worthy of consideration is the treatment of taxation. Taxes pose tricky legal issues to DAOs, as it is hardly conceivable to tax an entity that is — by definition — decentralized. Moreover, DAOs are digital entities that should not be conventionally connected to an agent or a location on earth. Until now, no clear [answers]() exist and it is therefore typically advisable to keep detailed records on DAO shares and its profits.\n\nEven when a legal wrapper is set up, things remain problematic. Is there a correspondence between “digital” profits and profits from the off-chain legal entity? What should be taxed? The profits of the DAO, the profits of the off-chain entity or both?\n\nIn this regard, the model law respects the decentralized nature of the DAO, in expressly recognizing the **status of a “pass-through entity” for tax purposes** (Art. 20). What this means is that the DAO is not charged by an entity-level tax. Any realized gains will pass through to the DAO’s members in proportion to their token holdings. In other words, the responsibility of paying tax on gains falls on members and participants, not the DAO. Members are anchored to a meat space jurisdiction, and each according to his own.\n\n### Outlook\n\nSome of the matters addressed require additional clarification, but the model law is coherent with the idea that DAOs exist on-chain and that their legal recognition does not require a registered office located in a particular jurisdiction. The underlying assumption here is that blockchain features may provide for functional and regulatory equivalents compared to measures that are usually adopted by the law.\n\nThe methodological approach of the COALA model law seems correct, shining more light into a currently ambiguous area of the law. It does not harm the peculiarities of DAOs nor the autonomy of its members. As such, members remain free to determine the by-laws of the DAO and develop new forms of governance as deemed relevant.\n\nIf we continue heading in this direction, states' law merely sets some general requirements, but DAOs can shape their future in an on-chain world.\n\nDAO law would grow and prosper beyond the states, setting new precedents for organization, creativity, and commerce.\n\n\n---\n\n*eaglelex is a Law Professor interested in blockchain technology and DAO governance*\n\n*Twitter: @EaglelexE*\n\n*Thanks to* *@thefrankamerica* *for his review and his comments*", "timestamp": 1630102752, "digest": "nCRNjYBAxup4Ye0-k8BB_kNPCz7L1XI5l3XkiGWqx3Y", "contributor": "0x75cD58A01883C6A115A1293C4Dd4CE67D11928f0"}

Before I explore why I think this is the case let’s define some terms.\n\nNon-fungible tokens are a type of crypto asset that represent unique (or “non-fungible”) digital goods like pieces of art or video game items. As with Bitcoin or Ether, these crypto-assets are held in a non-custodial and censorship resistant manner where proof of ownership exists on public blockchains.\n\nCryptoPunks are a set of 10,000 digital characters that have a variety of attributes with different levels of rarity based on their type (alien, ape, zombie) and attributes like tiaras, luxurious beards, hoodies, and so on. As one of the original NFT collectibles, punks were a seminal step in the development of the ERC-721 standard, which is the “file type” most NFT projects use today.\n\n![CryptoPunk 8348](https://miro.medium.com/max/1248/1\\*c8thAfkcYI4Y-aXE2QhEew.png)\n\nInitially, it may seem crazy that there are people willing to pay big money for what critics say are just PNG files of pixel art. If someone likes one of these punks, can’t they just right click and save the image? While I understand people who hold this view, it misses some important nuance around how art is valued. Let’s consider “real” art for a minute as a comparison.\n\nPaintings by Vincent van Gogh are expensive and many of his pieces have sold for millions of dollars over the past decade. At the same time, I grew up with a printed copy of one of van Gogh’s Sunflowers hanging above my kitchen table… and even though *I* think it’s beautiful, I wouldn’t be able to sell it. It’s worthless, it’s a print.\n\nWhat this shows is fine art has value — at least financially speaking — based on verifiable ownership of an original, not because of aesthetic beauty alone. If someone owns an original work by a famous artist, they gain a level of status. Wealthy people store value in fine art based on the assumption that this will hold true. That status persists. This is in part why so much art sits in freeports around the world and gets traded without the owners ever bothering to go see the pieces in person.\n\n![Side-by-side copies of Sunflowers, Fourth Version, Vincent van Gogh, 1888](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4eccbe08-e960-492e-9687-3c57b66163b2.png?height=404&width=642)\n\nOk, back to CryptoPunks. What is novel about CryptoPunks is they are among the first pieces of digital art on Ethereum that have a built in means of verifying unique ownership. This is done through cryptographic hashing such that a wallet address on Ethereum can have ownership rights over a CryptoPunk in a secure manner. As people have caught on to this, there has been a surge of interest in buying punks. In the last quarter of 2020 and the first few months of 2021 there have been tens of millions of dollars in sales volume surrounding CryptoPunks and a few purchases of over one million dollars each for the rarest ones. See below for a visual of the price action over the past three months from nonfungible.com:\n\n![CryptoPunk trading data from nonfungible.com](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*aKyoylvmGHXsN7ZA)\n\nSeveral people have laid out investment theses around why punks will hold value over time. A good one to read if you’re interested in exploring this further can be found [here](https://punk.substack.com/p/cryptopunks-digital-collectibles). To me, the value proposition comes down to two things. Punks as a store of value and punks as a reflexive asset with a great narrative. On the store of value side, there are only 10,000 punks and with all the new money in crypto there aren’t enough to go around. It’s a supply-side crisis. On the narrative side, punks have a great story: they had a fair launch so anyone could claim them for free back in the day, the founders behind the project are brilliant, they’re the rookie card of NFTs, etc.\n\nWhile some people see the current run up in punk prices as a bubble — and it may be, in part — I see it more as the repricing of an asset that many people (myself included) missed for a long time. Further, I expect to see the market cap of punks combined continue to grow significantly in the next five years, potentially even in proportion to the size of the NFT market as a whole.\n\nHere’s the theory: NFTs will be massive for the digital art and collectibles category. There will be billions of them. As this growth happens, certain NFTs will capture a majority of the value and punks are a good candidate to capture that value because capital will flow into them from *both* large and small investors.\n\nLet’s look at small collectors first. As new people come into the crypto space they tend to want to collect what is already valuable… and there’s nothing more valuable than punks: they’re persistent, they have a great community, they are used by important people as Twitter and Discord profile pictures, and so on.\n\nWhile punks are too pricey for everyday collectors — the lowest one on offer at the time of writing is $26,000 or 13.5 ETH — projects like NFTX and Niftex have made it possible for smallholders to participate. Both of those protocols use different mechanics to allow people to own a small portion of a punk, either through a set of index funds backed by real punks (NFTX) or fractional ownership of a single punk (Niftex). Together, these protocols allow ownership of punks to disperse in a way that’s never been true of any high-end collectible category. And there are liquid secondary markets for these tokens too.\n\nWhile value will pour into punks from normal collectors, wealthy NFT collectors will cause a surge in punk market cap as well. When I think of wealthy NFT collectors, I break them into two categories. There’s non-crypto money and crypto-native money.\n\nThe wealthy new investors will come into NFTs from outside crypto and want what is the most highly valued asset. Punks. For example, last week I was in the CryptoPunks Discord, which has a bot that reports on recent punk sales, and I saw a new Ethereum wallet drop a million dollars on a dozen punks in a single hour. How many people can do that before the prices go bananas?\n\nThen there’s the crypto-native people who denominate a portion of their net worth in punks. What does that even mean? In the same way that a lot of people who are OGs in Bitcoin play with and trade altcoins then take those gains back into Bitcoin… OG NFT collectors dabble in other NFT projects and when they make money there, they often take those gains back to punks as their numéraire (by buying more or rarer punks with that capital). As the NFT category expands, these people will be taking more and more profit back into punks. Again, punk numbers go up.\n\nUltimately then, with capital flowing in both from the bottom (everyday investors) and the top (high net worth people) punks will be bursting at the seams with value capture. Over the coming years, we’re going to see some fat punks.\n\n*Credit to the many people whose thinking directly influenced this essay, specifically Aaron Wright, Scott Lewis, Alex Gausman, Snowfro, ddaavvee, gmoney, and JUSTIN.*\n\n*End Note: 100% of the proceeds from The Fat CryptoPunks Thesis will be donated to charity though Mirror’s “Split” functionality: 25% on-chain to GiveWell’s Maximum Impact Fund, 25% on-chain to SaveArtSpace, 25% on-chain to Coin Center, and 25% off-chain through me to charities in British Columbia.*\n\n[split://0x2cB6f19F64e76751DeFc6462852D4728CB0FDDda?network=mainnet](split://0x2cB6f19F64e76751DeFc6462852D4728CB0FDDda?network=mainnet)\n\n", "timestamp": 1630116387, "digest": "dlHilXGUBmVuy0OFtClII4Tr1WMakyh7HZrjoM2xDv8", "contributor": "0x47ec58D5704082527a90362a6293029d7Ed5fc4E"}

As with Bitcoin or Ether, these crypto-assets are held in a non-custodial and censorship resistant manner where proof of ownership exists on public blockchains.\n\nCryptoPunks are a set of 10,000 digital characters that have a variety of attributes with different levels of rarity based on their type (alien, ape, zombie) and attributes like tiaras, luxurious beards, hoodies, and so on. As one of the original NFT collectibles, punks were a seminal step in the development of the ERC-721 standard, which is the “file type” most NFT projects use today.\n\n![CryptoPunk 8348](https://miro.medium.com/max/1248/1\\*c8thAfkcYI4Y-aXE2QhEew.png)\n\nInitially, it may seem crazy that there are people willing to pay big money for what critics say are just PNG files of pixel art. If someone likes one of these punks, can’t they just right click and save the image? While I understand people who hold this view, it misses some important nuance around how art is valued. Let’s consider “real” art for a minute as a comparison.\n\nPaintings by Vincent van Gogh are expensive and many of his pieces have sold for millions of dollars over the past decade. At the same time, I grew up with a printed copy of one of van Gogh’s Sunflowers hanging above my kitchen table… and even though *I* think it’s beautiful, I wouldn’t be able to sell it. It’s worthless, it’s a print.\n\nWhat this shows is fine art has value — at least financially speaking — based on verifiable ownership of an original, not because of aesthetic beauty alone. If someone owns an original work by a famous artist, they gain a level of status. Wealthy people store value in fine art based on the assumption that this will hold true. That status persists. This is in part why so much art sits in freeports around the world and gets traded without the owners ever bothering to go see the pieces in person.\n\n![Side-by-side copies of Sunflowers, Fourth Version, Vincent van Gogh, 1888](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4eccbe08-e960-492e-9687-3c57b66163b2.png?height=404&width=642)\n\nOk, back to CryptoPunks. What is novel about CryptoPunks is they are among the first pieces of digital art on Ethereum that have a built in means of verifying unique ownership. This is done through cryptographic hashing such that a wallet address on Ethereum can have ownership rights over a CryptoPunk in a secure manner. As people have caught on to this, there has been a surge of interest in buying punks. In the last quarter of 2020 and the first few months of 2021 there have been tens of millions of dollars in sales volume surrounding CryptoPunks and a few purchases of over one million dollars each for the rarest ones. See below for a visual of the price action over the past three months from nonfungible.com:\n\n![CryptoPunk trading data from nonfungible.com](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*aKyoylvmGHXsN7ZA)\n\nSeveral people have laid out investment theses around why punks will hold value over time. A good one to read if you’re interested in exploring this further can be found [here](https://punk.substack.com/p/cryptopunks-digital-collectibles). To me, the value proposition comes down to two things. Punks as a store of value and punks as a reflexive asset with a great narrative. On the store of value side, there are only 10,000 punks and with all the new money in crypto there aren’t enough to go around. It’s a supply-side crisis. On the narrative side, punks have a great story: they had a fair launch so anyone could claim them for free back in the day, the founders behind the project are brilliant, they’re the rookie card of NFTs, etc.\n\nWhile some people see the current run up in punk prices as a bubble — and it may be, in part — I see it more as the repricing of an asset that many people (myself included) missed for a long time. Further, I expect to see the market cap of punks combined continue to grow significantly in the next five years, potentially even in proportion to the size of the NFT market as a whole.\n\nHere’s the theory: NFTs will be massive for the digital art and collectibles category. There will be billions of them. As this growth happens, certain NFTs will capture a majority of the value and punks are a good candidate to capture that value because capital will flow into them from *both* large and small investors.\n\nLet’s look at small collectors first. As new people come into the crypto space they tend to want to collect what is already valuable… and there’s nothing more valuable than punks: they’re persistent, they have a great community, they are used by important people as Twitter and Discord profile pictures, and so on.\n\nWhile punks are too pricey for everyday collectors — the lowest one on offer at the time of writing is $26,000 or 13.5 ETH — projects like NFTX and Niftex have made it possible for smallholders to participate. Both of those protocols use different mechanics to allow people to own a small portion of a punk, either through a set of index funds backed by real punks (NFTX) or fractional ownership of a single punk (Niftex). Together, these protocols allow ownership of punks to disperse in a way that’s never been true of any high-end collectible category. And there are liquid secondary markets for these tokens too.\n\nWhile value will pour into punks from normal collectors, wealthy NFT collectors will cause a surge in punk market cap as well. When I think of wealthy NFT collectors, I break them into two categories. There’s non-crypto money and crypto-native money.\n\nThe wealthy new investors will come into NFTs from outside crypto and want what is the most highly valued asset. Punks. For example, last week I was in the CryptoPunks Discord, which has a bot that reports on recent punk sales, and I saw a new Ethereum wallet drop a million dollars on a dozen punks in a single hour. How many people can do that before the prices go bananas?\n\nThen there’s the crypto-native people who denominate a portion of their net worth in punks. What does that even mean? In the same way that a lot of people who are OGs in Bitcoin play with and trade altcoins then take those gains back into Bitcoin… OG NFT collectors dabble in other NFT projects and when they make money there, they often take those gains back to punks as their numéraire (by buying more or rarer punks with that capital). As the NFT category expands, these people will be taking more and more profit back into punks. Again, punk numbers go up.\n\nUltimately then, with capital flowing in both from the bottom (everyday investors) and the top (high net worth people) punks will be bursting at the seams with value capture. Over the coming years, we’re going to see some fat punks.\n\n*Credit to the many people whose thinking directly influenced this essay, specifically Aaron Wright, Scott Lewis, Alex Gausman, Snowfro, ddaavvee, gmoney, and JUSTIN.*\n\n*End Note: 100% of the proceeds from The Fat CryptoPunks Thesis will be donated to charity though Mirror’s “Split” functionality: 25% on-chain to GiveWell’s Maximum Impact Fund, 25% on-chain to SaveArtSpace, 25% on-chain to Coin Center, and 25% off-chain through me to charities in British Columbia.*\n\n[split://0x2cB6f19F64e76751DeFc6462852D4728CB0FDDda?network=mainnet](split://0x2cB6f19F64e76751DeFc6462852D4728CB0FDDda?network=mainnet)\n\n", "timestamp": 1630117366, "digest": "dlHilXGUBmVuy0OFtClII4Tr1WMakyh7HZrjoM2xDv8", "contributor": "0x47ec58D5704082527a90362a6293029d7Ed5fc4E"}

Earlier this week, we launched the [“Heavy is the HVND” crowdfund initiative](https://blvkhvnd.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930) to raise funds standup our HVND DAO and aggressively acquire assets of the most anticipated crypto-native trading card game [Parallel](https://parallel.life) before their card holding snapshot. **We could not have been more lit.** Within the first 1 minute we reached our funding goal of 100 ETH. Within hours, we eclipsed 200 ETH. In the final stretch, we ended with **337.75 ETH—a $1m seed round.**\n\nOur raise told us a few things, but the most glaring fact was the recognition that the gaming industry needs something different. Something that blends culture + gaming, something that equitably distributes value through competition, content creation, and career pathways that touch all areas of the gaming industry. They are betting on BLVKHVND’s success and we know that we’ll make it because of our community and partners like [Lemniscap](https://lemniscap.com/) whose impact in crypto and gaming is well established.\n\nAs we kick off our first season, we want to thank each and everyone of our backers, supporters, and fans looking forward to seeing our community grow. Nothing is done in a silo and we are forever grateful—we could not have written a better story.\n\n## Season 1 - Roadmap + Immediate Actions\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/02f32681-6e80-484f-aa47-6b05e82fc3b8.jpg?height=1001&width=2000&&&size=large)\n\n### August 2021\n\n**Parallel Asset Acquisition**\n\nImmediately after the crowdfund’s closing we went to work purchasing roughly 130 ETH of Parallel Assets to complete 4 Parasets to obtain Galaxy Keys before the set snapshot. Our treasury is now sitting on over a half a million in asset value. With the addition of the Galaxy Keys and new Rug Poll \\[SE\\] assets, we are squarely positioned to make an impact in the Parallel community.\n\n[https://zapper.fi/account/blvkhvnd.eth/nft](https://zapper.fi/account/blvkhvnd.eth/nft)\n\n> *Please note that Zapper.fi does not account for multiples, so for a more accurate account, we will release a spreadsheet in the coming days for a better look into our asset pool.

These NFTs were minted on Zora from our BLVKHVND proxy address (the same address that created this mirror publication). We will also like to take this opportunity to reveal that the largest contribution was made by [Lemniscap](https://lemniscap.com/), a forward looking venture fund, and we are proud to have their support. We are excited and welcome their involvement with BLVKHVND as we strive to radically change esports, one HVND at a time!\n\n**NFT Drop**\n\nWe’ve gotten such a positive response to the crowdfund that more of you want in! While we do not have an active crowdfund, on Sunday Aug 29, we will be dropping our “HVND OF ACCESS” NFT. This NFT is an edition of 200, available first come, first serve,  never to be minted again. Supporters will receive the NFT, access to our discord role *“The HVND”*, a reward of 100 $HVND tokens, and a special thanks for being an early supporter of BLVKHVND.\n\n> *Unfortunately we cannot recover any other NFTs that were lost during the crowdfund. As such, the ACCESS NFT will be airdropped to the 7 backers who did not receive a HVND OF AFFLUENCE.*\n\nFor those who did get NFTs from the crowdfund, we will mint and airdrop S*pecial Edition* versions of the claimed number of NFTs. We are excited to see all of our holders rock their favorite pieces. In due time, we will display a collection of our NFTs in a virtual gallery.\n\n**LP on Uniswap**\n\nOn August 31st, any participant in the crowdfund or purchases the ACCESS NFT on Sunday will be eligible to become a LIQUID HVND. Liquid Hvnds are liquidity providers that help give the token an open market to be bought, sold, traded amongst community members and speculators.\n\n### September 2021 — October 2021\n\n**Player Recruitment + Coaching Staff**\n\nTeams are more than just the *players*, good teams have coaches, analysts, and trainers at the highest competitive level. For us, serving casual, amateur, and pro-level players is no easy task, but one we are eager to tackle. Our focus will be recruiting for enthusiastic, coachable players that have the propensity to learn and experiment with their gameplay. Knowledge and experience of the game titles a player is interested in forming a team is important as is some level of competitive experience.\n\nWe will issue two signup forms in our discord on September 3rd for players and coaches with tryouts slated for September 15th.\n\n**The New BLVKHVND Web3 Setup**\n\nIn the coming weeks as we enter September, three bounties will be released:\n\n* Support for Stream Animations + Interactions\n* Support for BLVKHVND main site + auction house\n* Support for Intra-team Branding\n\nWe have many of the moving pieces to get us geared up for pushing consistent live and async content, but it’s not as fun if the HVND community doesn’t get involved. This is an opportunity to earn HVND by doing and putting your touch on what will be a global brand. More information will be released soon in our discord.\n\n**BLVKHVND Monster Mash Invitational**\n\nOur goal is to host our first tournament of the year and bring a mixture of crypto-native games like Axie Infinity to our community to discover and play with the communities they are apart of. We also want to test our newly formed dSports team and compete. More information related to this tournament will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n## LIQUID HVND: Introducing $HVND\n\n$HVND will launch on August 31st, 2021.\n\n**The [contract address](https://etherscan.io/token/0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930) of $HVND is 0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930**\n\nThe supply of $HVND is 1,350,620 tokens, with 337,655 in circulation from the initial crowdfund.\n\n*Please exercise extreme caution when interacting with this token and triple check that the contract address matches the one above. $HVND represents membership in the BLVKHVND gaming community and should not be regarded as an investment.*\n\nBelow lists everything you need to know about $HVND:\n\n* 100 $HVND is required for full membership into the BLVKHVND gaming community\n* Voting rights can be delegated to other community members, and 25-50% of a strategic partner or outside capital (VC, Angel, etc) is required to delegate to the broader community.\n* Governance is done through Snapshot and will employ delegation and quadratic voting toward proposals.

Earlier this week, we launched the [“Heavy is the HVND” crowdfund initiative](https://blvkhvnd.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930) to raise funds standup our HVND DAO and aggressively acquire assets of the most anticipated crypto-native trading card game [Parallel](https://parallel.life) before their card holding snapshot. **We could not have been more lit.** Within the first 1 minute we reached our funding goal of 100 ETH. Within hours, we eclipsed 200 ETH. In the final stretch, we ended with **337.75 ETH—a $1m seed round.**\n\nOur raise told us a few things, but the most glaring fact was the recognition that the gaming industry needs something different. Something that blends culture + gaming, something that equitably distributes value through competition, content creation, and career pathways that touch all areas of the gaming industry. They are betting on BLVKHVND’s success and we know that we’ll make it because of our community and partners like [Lemniscap](https://lemniscap.com/) whose impact in crypto and gaming is well established.\n\nAs we kick off our first season, we want to thank each and everyone of our backers, supporters, and fans looking forward to seeing our community grow. Nothing is done in a silo and we are forever grateful—we could not have written a better story.\n\n## Season 1 - Roadmap + Immediate Actions\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/02f32681-6e80-484f-aa47-6b05e82fc3b8.jpg?height=1001&width=2000&&&&size=large)\n\n### August 2021\n\n**Parallel Asset Acquisition**\n\nImmediately after the crowdfund’s closing we went to work purchasing roughly 130 ETH of Parallel Assets to complete 4 Parasets to obtain Galaxy Keys before the set snapshot. Our treasury is now sitting on over a half a million in asset value. With the addition of the Galaxy Keys and new Rug Poll \\[SE\\] assets, we are squarely positioned to make an impact in the Parallel community.\n\n[https://zapper.fi/account/blvkhvnd.eth/nft](https://zapper.fi/account/blvkhvnd.eth/nft)\n\n> *Please note that Zapper.fi does not account for multiples, so for a more accurate account, we will release a spreadsheet in the coming days for a better look into our asset pool. We are also still receiving Parallel Assets from HVND holders. To view all assets currently owned, check out our [OpenSea Account.](https://opensea.io/0x4763cfa50311729b65815e5ae9ebbefdb94ec112)*\n\n**1/1 NFT For Patron Winners**\n\nOn Sunday Aug 29, we will distribute the NFTs for the Patron Winners. These NFTs were minted on Zora from our BLVKHVND proxy address (the same address that created this mirror publication). We will also like to take this opportunity to reveal that the largest contribution was made by [Lemniscap](https://lemniscap.com/), a forward looking venture fund, and we are proud to have their support. We are excited and welcome their involvement with BLVKHVND as we strive to radically change esports, one HVND at a time!\n\n**NFT Drop**\n\nWe’ve gotten such a positive response to the crowdfund that more of you want in! While we do not have an active crowdfund, on Sunday Aug 29, we will be dropping our “HVND OF ACCESS” NFT. This NFT is an edition of 200, available first come, first serve,  never to be minted again. Supporters will receive the NFT, access to our discord role *“The HVND”*, a reward of 100 $HVND tokens, and a special thanks for being an early supporter of BLVKHVND.\n\n> *Unfortunately we cannot recover any other NFTs that were lost during the crowdfund. As such, the ACCESS NFT will be airdropped to the 7 backers who did not receive a HVND OF AFFLUENCE.*\n\nFor those who did get NFTs from the crowdfund, we will mint and airdrop S*pecial Edition* versions of the claimed number of NFTs. A snapshot will be taken Sunday morning at 9am EST to determine who gets these SE NFTs. We are excited to see all of our holders rock their favorite pieces. In due time, we will display a collection of our NFTs in a virtual gallery.\n\n**LP on Uniswap**\n\nOn August 31st, any participant in the crowdfund or purchases the ACCESS NFT on Sunday will be eligible to become a LIQUID HVND. Liquid Hvnds are liquidity providers that help give the token an open market to be bought, sold, traded amongst community members and speculators.\n\n### September 2021 — October 2021\n\n**Player Recruitment + Coaching Staff**\n\nTeams are more than just the *players*, good teams have coaches, analysts, and trainers at the highest competitive level. For us, serving casual, amateur, and pro-level players is no easy task, but one we are eager to tackle. Our focus will be recruiting for enthusiastic, coachable players that have the propensity to learn and experiment with their gameplay. Knowledge and experience of the game titles a player is interested in forming a team is important as is some level of competitive experience.\n\nWe will issue two signup forms in our discord on September 3rd for players and coaches with tryouts slated for September 15th.\n\n**The New BLVKHVND Web3 Setup**\n\nIn the coming weeks as we enter September, three bounties will be released:\n\n* Support for Stream Animations + Interactions\n* Support for BLVKHVND main site + auction house\n* Support for Intra-team Branding\n\nWe have many of the moving pieces to get us geared up for pushing consistent live and async content, but it’s not as fun if the HVND community doesn’t get involved. This is an opportunity to earn HVND by doing and putting your touch on what will be a global brand. More information will be released soon in our discord.\n\n**BLVKHVND Monster Mash Invitational**\n\nOur goal is to host our first tournament of the year and bring a mixture of crypto-native games like Axie Infinity to our community to discover and play with the communities they are apart of. We also want to test our newly formed dSports team and compete. More information related to this tournament will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n## LIQUID HVND: Introducing $HVND\n\n$HVND will launch on August 31st, 2021.\n\n**The [contract address](https://etherscan.io/token/0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930) of $HVND is 0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930**\n\nThe supply of $HVND is 1,350,620 tokens, with 337,655 in circulation from the initial crowdfund.\n\n*Please exercise extreme caution when interacting with this token and triple check that the contract address matches the one above. $HVND represents membership in the BLVKHVND gaming community and should not be regarded as an investment.*\n\nBelow lists everything you need to know about $HVND:\n\n* 100 $HVND is required for full membership into the BLVKHVND gaming community\n* Voting rights can be delegated to other community members, and 25-50% of a strategic partner or outside capital (VC, Angel, etc) is required to delegate to the broader community.\n* Governance is done through Snapshot and will employ delegation and quadratic voting toward proposals.

{"id": "NZrGr5kqCaXcEhDz4nhhDY0AO191pak62waebk2otB4", "title": "Tutorial: How to Stake on Synthetix ", "body": "# What is Synthetix? ⚔️\n\n[Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) is a decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol on Ethereum that enables the creation of synthetic assets (Synths) through its staking mechanism. Traders are able to acquire on-chain exposure to a variety of assets, including fiat currencies, stocks, commodities, and crypto, using the Synthetix platform. \n\nAll Synths on Synthetix are backed by $SNX tokens that holders have staked as collateral into the application. With a high collateralization ratio and a unique minting/burning mechanism, Synthetix offers traders the ability to trade synthetic assets in a decentralized manner with deep liquidity and zero slippage, unlike traditional decentralized exchanges. \n\n# Why Stake on Synthetix? 💰\n\n$SNX holders are incentivized to stake their tokens in order to receive a portion of exchange fees and staking rewards. \n\n* **Exchange Fee Rewards** - Whenever a trader places a trade on Synthetix, they pay a small exchange fee between 10-100 bps that is distributed pro-rata each week to stakers. \n* **Staking Rewards** - The existing $SNX monetary policy is inflationary in perpetuity. The weekly inflation is distributed to stakers as $SNX tokens that vest over a one-year period.\n\n# How do you Stake on Synthetix? 📘\n\nFor this tutorial, you will need:\n\n* A web3 wallet (e.g. Metamask)\n* $SNX tokens\n* $ETH for gas fees\n\n### Minting $sUSD / Staking\n\nFirst, head over to <https://staking.synthetix.io/> and click ‘**STAKE**’ in the center of the page. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/85d6899b-70fb-49b8-ac53-4070ee5f61ca.png?height=343&width=622)\n\nNext, connect your wallet that is holding your $SNX tokens. You can connect your wallet by pressing the dropdown box in the upper right corner labeled ‘**NOT CONNECTED**’. Be sure you are connected to the network you’d like to use (e.g. Mainnet, [Optimism](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/u4qNFL7G5lmhEI7txECyFcsbfQi4rHGHPGdnBNI73pE)).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d41a1538-f22f-4f42-8932-c1919271848b.png?height=256&width=1403)\n\nNow that you are connected, select ‘**MINT MAX**’ in the center of the page (note: you can also mint a custom amount if you’d prefer to try a specific [staking strategy](https://synthetix.community/docs/staking-strategies)). This will populate the maximum amount of $sUSD you’ll be able to mint given your total available $SNX holdings. Once ready to proceed, click ‘**MINT sUSD**’ and confirm the transaction with your wallet. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/618d20fc-2340-4388-82b9-bc7845d2ac00.png?height=299&width=611)\n\nAfter the transaction is complete, you should now have $sUSD in your wallet that you can use to purchase Synths or utilize elsewhere in DeFi. You are now officially staking your $SNX.\n\n### Claiming Rewards\n\nEvery Wednesday, a snapshot is taken of all $SNX stakers, and fees and rewards are distributed accordingly. To claim the rewards, you will need to make sure your collateralization ratio (C-Ratio) is relatively close to the target ratio. You can see your current C-Ratio on the top-center of the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/39a89d54-3c30-450b-8176-4c8824a262c6.png?height=248&width=1316)\n\nAt the time of this writing, the target C-Ratio on Mainnet is 400%, and the target on Optimism is 900%. If you need to adjust your ratio back to the target, you can do this on the ‘**BURN**’ tab by selecting ‘**BURN TO X%**’ and confirming the transaction (note: you will need to make sure you have enough $sUSD in your wallet, which means you might have to purchase additional $sUSD if you are using it elsewhere).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11c6b8d4-48ca-487e-8974-4cc1f95cb5e3.png?height=449&width=605)\n\nNow that your C-Ratio is properly adjusted, it is time to claim your rewards. Hover over ‘**STAKING**’ on the left side-bar and select ‘**EARN**’.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f43cfe91-b3ac-4d7f-9253-b7b8f4e64452.png?height=599&width=629)\n\nSelect the Synthetix Staking Rewards pool. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d33c73c4-9209-4fb9-88a4-90d2a07574a9.png?height=114&width=616)\n\nThe screen that pops up will show you how much you have earned in $sUSD from trading fees and how much $SNX you have received from staking rewards. Press the claim button and confirm the transaction in your wallet to finalize the claim. \n\nCome back each week to claim your rewards (note: rewards do not roll over from week to week).\n\n### Unstaking\n\nWhen you are ready to unstake your $SNX, head back to the ‘**BURN**’ tab and select ‘**BURN MAX**’. Similar to reward redemptions, you’ll need to make sure you have enough $sUSD in your wallet to burn your debt. Click ‘**BURN sUSD**’ and confirm the transaction to unstake. \n\n### Other Considerations\n\n* Make sure to [read up](https://synthetix.community/docs/claiming-rewards#managing-debt) and understand how to properly manage your $sUSD debt. It typically makes sense to [mirror the global debt portfolio](https://blog.synthetix.io/debt-hedging-refresher-for-snx-stakers/). \n* There are [multiple strategies](https://synthetix.community/docs/staking-strategies) for how much debt to mint depending on your risk tolerance. \n\n## Congratulations! 🎉\n\nYou’ve officially staked on Synthetix and claimed your rewards. Your stake is helping to provide the liquidity necessary to create advanced synthetic assets on Ethereum, enabling permissionless trading of derivatives for anyone across the globe.

If you need to adjust your ratio back to the target, you can do this on the ‘**BURN**’ tab by selecting ‘**BURN TO X%**’ and confirming the transaction (note: you will need to make sure you have enough $sUSD in your wallet, which means you might have to purchase additional $sUSD if you are using it elsewhere).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11c6b8d4-48ca-487e-8974-4cc1f95cb5e3.png?height=449&width=605)\n\nNow that your C-Ratio is properly adjusted, it is time to claim your rewards.

Traders are able to acquire on-chain exposure to a variety of assets, including fiat currencies, stocks, commodities, and crypto, using the Synthetix platform. \n\nAll Synths on Synthetix are backed by $SNX tokens that holders have staked as collateral into the application. With a high collateralization ratio and a unique minting/burning mechanism, Synthetix offers traders the ability to trade synthetic assets in a decentralized manner with deep liquidity and zero slippage, unlike traditional decentralized exchanges. \n\n# Why Stake on Synthetix? 💰\n\n$SNX holders are incentivized to stake their tokens in order to receive a portion of exchange fees and staking rewards. \n\n* **Exchange Fee Rewards** - Whenever a trader places a trade on Synthetix, they pay a small exchange fee between 10-100 bps that is distributed pro-rata each week to stakers. \n* **Staking Rewards** - The existing $SNX monetary policy is inflationary in perpetuity. The weekly inflation is distributed to stakers as $SNX tokens that vest over a one-year period.\n\n# How do you Stake on Synthetix? 📘\n\nFor this tutorial, you will need:\n\n* A web3 wallet (e.g. Metamask)\n* $SNX tokens\n* $ETH for gas fees\n\n### Minting $sUSD / Staking\n\nFirst, head over to <https://staking.synthetix.io/> and click ‘**STAKE**’ in the center of the page. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/85d6899b-70fb-49b8-ac53-4070ee5f61ca.png?height=343&width=622)\n\nNext, connect your wallet that is holding your $SNX tokens.

Click ‘**BURN sUSD**’ and confirm the transaction to unstake.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n* Make sure to [read up](https://synthetix.community/docs/claiming-rewards#managing-debt) and understand how to properly manage your $sUSD debt. It typically makes sense to [mirror the global debt portfolio](https://blog.synthetix.io/debt-hedging-refresher-for-snx-stakers/).\n* There are [multiple strategies](https://synthetix.community/docs/staking-strategies) for how much debt to mint depending on your risk tolerance.\n\n## Congratulations! 🎉\n\nYou’ve officially staked on Synthetix and claimed your rewards.

The importance of this change goes way beyond the kinds of things that are currently popular in the crypto space. It’s not contained to art markets, collectibles, or even gaming. The existence of programmable, interoperable digital objects will fundamentally change the logic of the Internet. \n\nIt’s true that many digital objects will be purely cosmetic, like a rare avatar or piece of art you can display within different applications. But if digital objects are as versatile as physical objects (how many different things can “objects” do?), many NFTs will provide functional benefits to their owners. Digital items will move with their owners across the Internet and allow them to perform special actions across independent pieces of software.\n\nAs the implications of this reorganize how people use the Internet, many valuable companies will be created and destroyed. This doesn’t mean companies need to “get into NFTs” by selling digital collectibles or buying them. It means they need to build their companies on a mental model of the Internet that acknowledges all of the second order effects of digital objects.\n\nFor entire broad categories of software, if an application doesn’t recognize that people hold inventories, it won't be compelling to users. As we move into the future, more people on the Internet will be accumulating their own inventories of digital objects and won't want to spend time in software that forces them \"start over.”\n\nSome of most valuable software of the coming years will be software that grasps and quickly adapts to the logical combination of scarcity and interoperability that NFTs bring to the Internet.", "timestamp": 1630130642, "digest": "k0yCgq0bjgn2X0AujhwjKIYk4SDBpdNayjU5_E8Wm4I", "contributor": "0xB0623C91c65621df716aB8aFE5f66656B21A9108"}
